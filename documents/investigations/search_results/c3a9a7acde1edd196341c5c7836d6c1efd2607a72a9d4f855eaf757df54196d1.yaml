    to increasing global water scarcity pressure, researchers, policy makers and industry
    are looking for innovative solutions to increasing agricultural water productivity.
    Motivated by recent success within complex decision-making environments, Deep
    Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is being proposed as a method for optimizing irrigation
    strategies. Early research has hinted towards increased profits with DRL compared
    to heuristic approaches such as soil-moisture thresholds or fixed schedules. However,
    an assessment of the value of DRL for irrigation scheduling that incorporates

    learningEconomicScheduling Introduction Agriculture is the main consumptive user
    of freshwater in many water-scarce regions, and thus a sector that is a both a
    cause and a victim of water scarcity. Improving agricultural water productivity
    is therefore an essential component of efforts to address water scarcity worldwide,
    as well as meeting food insecurity challenges [11,13]. Efforts to improve agricultural
    water productivity are fundamentally focused on tailoring irrigation to the crop-water
    needs as well as minimizing non-beneficial losses of water. Effective scheduling
    of irrigation during the growing season, alongside other interventions such as
    improved irrigation technologies or land management practices, are critical to
    achieving improvements in agricultural water productivity. Commonly, farmers schedule
    irrigation based on rules or heuristics, such as soil-moisture levels or crop
    conditions [35], which may be constant throughout the season or vary depending
    on crop growth stage. However, while irrigation strategies based on simple rules
    and heuristics are an intuitive and agronomically logically way to schedule irrigation,
    they may lead to sub-optimal irrigation decisions if the underlying assumptions
    on which the heuristic is designed change or vary unexpectedly. For example, an
    unexpected rainstorm or longer than usual period of drought may render farmers’
    fixed irrigation heuristic sub-optimal in a given year. Similarly, an unanticipated
    change in water availability (e.g., due to equipment failure, emergency drought
    measures) may mean that farmers irrigation heuristics are now sub-optimal given
    altered water supply risks. One solution to this challenge is to adapt irrigation
    scheduling heuristics by re-optimizing decision rules and triggers at various
    points within the season as the farmer begins to observe more of the seasonal
    weather conditions. Research has demonstrated that combining crop simulation models
    with field monitoring, weather forecast, and other data can be used to support
    adaptation of irrigation scheduling and improve yields, water productivity, and
    profitability [7,15,18,37]. However, this approach adds additional computational
    overhead during the season, especially if re-optimizing frequently throughout
    the season, thereby increasing costs for producers or irrigation scheduling service
    providers. In the case of service providers or farmers managing large land areas,
    re-optimizing strategies for tens of thousands of different cropping systems in
    near real-time may not be economically or technically feasible. Furthermore, as
    well as these issues with in-season adaptation, incorporating the increasing amounts
    of data available to farmers into heuristics will require large numbers of complex,
    interconnected rules that will be difficult to design and optimize. For example,
    it is not obvious how best to build an irrigation heuristic around short-term
    weather forecasts (e.g., irrigate if no rain is forecasted for the next five days),
    and how to combine this data with soil-moisture or canopy cover measurements to
    make the best decision possible. Addressing these issues, artificial intelligence
    based approaches such as Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) [33] have been suggested
    as way to automatically and flexibly adjust and adapt decisions during the season
    in response to any relevant information. DRL approaches have successfully surpassed
    the best human benchmarks in other complex decision making environments such as
    video and board games [5,23,31,36]. Recent research has explored the viability
    of using DRL for irrigation scheduling [2,8,38]. In comparison with non-optimized
    schedules and heuristics, DRL methods were found to deliver improvements in water
    productivity and profits, highlighting their potential value as a tool for real-world
    irrigation management. However, in all of these works the DRL agent was evaluated
    on a limited number of unseen test seasons (less than 3 for all the studies referenced
    above), which is insufficient to assess performance across diverse and uncertain
    weather scenarios faced by farmers in real-world production environments. Additionally,
    trained DRL agents were compared only to handpicked schedules (i.e., a set of
    dates and depths chosen by researchers), fixed time intervals (i.e., irrigate
    25 mm every N days), or single value heuristics (i.e., irrigate if the soil-water
    content drops a specified value), where this value was chosen by researchers rather
    than optimized for the specific production environment. These choices of benchmark
    irrigation strategy limit our understanding of the added value of using DRL compared
    to the optimized heuristics commonly used in irrigation scheduling research [16,19,20].
    In this article, we conduct a more systematic assessment of the value of DRL approaches
    to irrigation scheduling in comparison to conventional optimized heuristics, across
    a range of climate conditions. We assess how design choices, such as when and
    how often the DRL agent makes irrigation decisions, as well as assumptions about
    water use restrictions, impacts estimates of productivity and profitability gains
    from DRL. Through these analyses, we provide new insights into how best to evaluate
    the benefits of DRL for irrigation scheduling, as well as discussions about the
    conditions under which DRL may be a powerful tool in improving irrigation water
    productivity. Method In this section we describe the framework used to train and
    evaluate DRL agents for irrigation scheduling. First, we give a brief overview
    of DRL (Section 2.1), then describe how we apply DRL to irrigation scheduling
    within a crop-simulation model (Section 2.2). The chosen case study, as well as
    experimental details are then described (Section 2.3), followed by a discussion
    on overfitting and how to report DRL performance (Section 2.4). Finally, we describe
    the optimized heuristic that we will use to assess the added value of DRL (Section
    2.5). Deep reinforcement learning A typical reinforcement learning problem is
    framed as the interaction between an agent and an environment (Fig. 1). At each
    timestep, the agent receives some observation of the environment O, and makes
    action A in response. This action has some impact on the environment which then
    returns a reward R along with the next observation O. This loop continues until
    a terminal state of the environment is reached, after which point the episode
    has finished. The goal of the reinforcement learning agent is to learn a mapping
    of observation to action that maximizes the sum of future rewards [33]. Download

    Typical framing for a reinforcement learning problem, where a DRL agent aims to
    maximize the sum of future rewards. In Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), the
    mapping of observation to action is an artificial neural network, with the weights
    of that neural network being continually updated in response to the rewards received
    by the agent. In this analysis we use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) [29],
    which is one of the most popular DRL algorithms and has been used in a wide variety
    of environments such as robotics [3], video games [23] and flow control [24].
    PPO also has the advantage that it can be easily used for both continuous and
    discreet action spaces, allowing us to define many different types of irrigation
    strategies. Early experimentation found PPO provided the fastest and most stable
    training performance for this analysis compared to other algorithms tested. The
    code implementation of PPO that we use is from the DRL Python library ray-rllib
    [17]. This library is an actively maintained, production-ready framework that
    is currently used within several industries (https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/rllib/index.html).
    Applying DRL to irrigation scheduling To train DRL agents to make irrigation decisions,
    a crop-simulation environment is needed to rapidly test different irrigation strategies.
    Moreover, this environment needs to follow the Observation, Action, Reward, next
    Observation (O–A–R–O) framework outlined in the previous section. For this analysis,
    we use AquaCrop-OSPy [16] to represent the cropping system, and serve as the environment
    with which the DRL agent can interact with, make irrigation decisions, and receive
    feedback on how these decisions impact seasonal profits. AquaCrop-OSPy is an open
    source Python implementation of the crop-water productivity model AquaCrop [32].
    Developed by the UN-FAO, AquaCrop is one of the most widely used crop simulation
    models available, featuring in over 334 peer reviewed publications in the ten
    years since its launch [26]. AquaCrop aims to accurately represent crop response
    to water stress, whilst also reducing complexity and input data requirements,
    enabling it to be used in data scarce environments. AquaCrop-OSPy has been designed
    to allow flexible and complex irrigation decisions to be made outside of the model,
    allowing straightforward integration with DRL Python libraries or optimization
    algorithms. To facilitate this interaction between DRL agent and AquaCrop-OSPy,
    we created the aquacrop-gym open-source Python library (https://github.com/aquacropos/aquacrop-gym).
    To train a DRL agent within aquacrop-gym, a DRL agent is first initiated with
    random neural network weights. To gather information with which to learn from,
    the agent then performs a number of training rollouts (Fig. 2). For each training
    rollout a weather year is randomly sampled from the training set and an AquaCrop-OSPy
    simulation is initialized. Every N number of days within the simulation, AquaCrop-OSPy
    will pass to the agent a set of observations (e.g., current soil-moisture content).
    These observations are then processed by the agent and an action is recommended
    (e.g., irrigation depth). The simulation then runs for another N days after which
    the agent will output another action based on the latest observation. At the end
    of the season, the final reward (e.g., seasonal profits) is calculated and sent
    back to the agent. Download : Download high-res image (548KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 2. Flow diagram detailing how training data is collected
    by the DRL agent, then used to update the agent''s decision making. After updating
    the new strategy is evaluated on the validation set. After the training rollout
    is complete, all of the saved (O–A–R–O) transitions are used to update the weights
    of the agent''s internal neural network. Once the agent''s strategy has been updated,
    a validation rollout (Fig. 2) is performed. The validation rollout evaluates the
    agent against all of the unseen validation years and calculates the mean profit
    achieved by the agent. Since none of the (O–A–R–O) transitions are saved during
    this validation rollout, no learning occurs and only the mean reward is saved
    to track the learning progress of the agent. This loop of: collect training data,
    update strategy, validate strategy will continue for a specified number of iterations
    or until manually stopped. Case study, DRL design choices and experimental details
    For the case study for this analysis, we use AquaCrop-OSPy to simulate irrigated
    maize production in southwest Nebraska. Maize is the most commonly grown and irrigated
    crop within Nebraska, which itself contains more irrigated acres than any other
    state in the United States [35]. Irrigation water in Nebraska is primarily sourced
    from the High Plains aquifer, which has experienced severe declines in aquifer
    storage as a result of over abstraction [22,28]. In many parts of Nebraska, farmers’
    water use is restricted by local management agencies to minimize groundwater over-pumping
    and associated externalities such as streamflow depletion [39]. To train and validate
    our model, we utilize historic weather data for southwest Nebraska from a monitoring
    station in Champion, Nebraska [14]. This weather station provides 37 years (1982–2018)
    of observational data (daily minimum and maximum temperature, precipitation, and
    solar radiation), which we subsequently input to the weather generator LARS-WG
    [30] to generate a longer 100-year synthetic time series for our analysis. This
    weather generator determines the statistical characteristics of a given daily
    weather time series and uses these characteristics to generate new time series
    of daily weather data with the same statistical properties in terms of weather
    variability within and across years. LARS-WG has been shown in multiple recent
    studies to successfully represent the weather characteristics (e.g., monthly mean
    and variance of temperature or precipitation) of the input time-series [1,4].
    Using this method, we greatly increase the number of weather years for training
    (70 years) and validating (30 years) whilst still adequately representing the
    observed historical weather conditions (Figure S1). Other inputs, including crop
    and soil parameters, for AquaCrop simulations are drawn from the literature, specifically
    from previous studies that use the model to simulate maize production in the central
    United States [12,20,27], For calculation of seasonal profits at the end of each
    simulation, we assume a crop price of $180 per tonne [34], irrigation costs of
    $1 per ha-mm [9], and fixed non-irrigation production costs of $1728 ha−1 [9].
    Main DRL hyperparamaters are specified in Table S1, and full details of source
    code, model and DRL parameters are all available at (https://github.com/aquacropos/aquacrop-gym).
    We focus on seasonal profit as our metric of performance as profit represents
    the primary motivation of farmers operating in high-productivity technologically-advanced
    farming systems such as the central United States. Moreover, maximisation of profit
    also provides greater opportunity (e.g. compared to maximisation of yield) to
    assess benefits of DRL scheduling, due to the complexity of managing trade-offs
    between costs of water use and economic returns from crop yield. Determining what
    observations the agent should receive, which actions it is allowed to take, and
    what reward it will maximize are critical design choices that will depend on the
    cropping system being simulated. Examining all possible combinations of observation
    and action sets is out of the scope of this analysis. However, our aim is to test
    several of the most common and likely combinations that are applicable for our
    study area in the central United States. The range of action sets chosen for our
    analysis are displayed in Table 1. For depth discreet, the agent choses an irrigation
    depth to apply on the following day from a set of choices (0, 2.5, 5, …, 22.5,
    25 mm ha−1). For depth continuous, the agent can choose any depth to apply the
    following day within the specified bounds [0, 25 mm ha−1]. For binary, the agent
    decides whether or not to apply 25 mm of irrigation the following day. For soil-moisture
    threshold, the agent decides the soil-moisture threshold to use until the next
    decision step. If the soil-moisture content ever drops below this threshold, irrigation
    is triggered to fill the soil back to field capacity (subject to the maximum irrigation
    application of 25 mm ha−1). Finally, for all of these action sets, we compare
    four different decision intervals (i.e., the number of days between actions) 1,
    3, 5 and 7 days. Table 1. The action sets this case study compares. Action set
    Bounds Example action discreet depth [0,25] mm ha−1 0, 2.5, … 22.5, 25 mm ha−1
    continuous depth [0,25] mm ha−1 8.43 mm ha−1 Binary [0,25] mm ha−1 0, 25 mm ha−1
    soil moisture threshold [0,100]% TAW 63.2 %TAW In each case, observations provided
    to the agent before each irrigation decision are as follows: mean daily reference
    evapotranspiration and precipitation for the season so far; and for the past 7
    days only, current root-zone soil-moisture content, canopy cover, biomass growth,
    cumulative irrigation, water supply remaining, crop growth stage, and the total
    number of days since the season began. These variables are either obtained through
    the input weather time series or outputted by the AquaCrop-OSPy model. This choice
    of variables represents a range of weather, soil, and crop condition information
    that could plausibly be monitored or collected by farmers to support a DRL based
    scheduling approach, and could be extended or reduced depending on the monitoring
    capabilities of the individual production system being modelled. As discussed
    in the previous section, DRL agents will be trained on 70 years of training data
    and evaluated on 30 years of validation data. The mean and standard deviation
    in seasonal rainfall (May–September) for the training and validation sets were
    closely comparable, equal to 309.6 ± 93.7 and 306±93.2 mm ha−1 respectively. Although
    both the training and validation sets were drawn from the same statistical distribution,
    the individual time series will be different, and thus provides a way for us to
    assess how well the agent might perform if deployed in the real world under uncertain
    weather conditions. To assess the impact of this local variability on DRL performance,
    an additional experiment was therefore conducted where the rainfall was removed
    completely from the training and validation sets. We hypothesise that by removing
    this important source of weather variability, and hence reduce the difference
    between the training and validation time series, the performance of DRL should
    improve compared to when rainfall is present. Previous assessments of DRL for
    irrigation scheduling have assumed unrestricted water supplies for irrigation,
    whereby the DRL agent can irrigate as much as required. However, this assumption
    is not realistic to our case study region of Nebraska, or even other regions globally
    where water use may be restricted due to regulatory policies such as yearly or
    multi-yearly quotas and allocations or physical supply and capacity constraints
    [6,39]. Given that the marginal gains from applying additional water are greatest
    in times of water scarcity, we hypothesise that more complex strategies such as
    DRL may be more valuable when water resources are limited. To assess the impact
    of water use restrictions on the value of DRL, the framework presented so far
    is repeated and water use limits of 75, 100, 125 mm ha−1 are imposed on all simulation
    years. This restriction will prevent any further irrigation once the cap has been
    reached in any given growing season. To summarise, four DRL agents will be trained
    initially to compare the action sets described in Table 1. The best performing
    action set will be used to train an additional four DRL agents to compare the
    four decision intervals 1, 3, 5 and 7 days. With this chosen DRL configuration
    (i.e., action set and decision interval), two more experiments will be conducted
    – one with no change to local rainfall and one with rainfall set to zero. Finally,
    with the same DRL configuration, three experiments will be conducted for each
    seasonal water use limit 75, 100, 125 mm ha−1. In total this will result in 13
    experiments. Learning curves, evaluation criteria and overfitting One of the downsides
    of using an artificial neural network based irrigation strategy is that neural
    networks, if trained for long enough, will often overfit to training data. When
    overfitting occurs, the training set performance continues to increase but the
    performance on the unseen validation set begins to decrease. This divergence occurs
    as the neural network begins to find patterns that apply only to the training
    set, rather than general patterns that apply also to the validation set. As a
    result of this overfitting, it is often desirable to stop training before reaching
    an optimum score on the training set – by which point the model has very likely
    overfit. To track learning process, throughout training the DRL agent will be
    continually evaluated on both the training and validation years, allowing us to
    monitor when and if overfitting occurs. Fig. 3 displays these evaluation results
    for a DRL agent that makes discreet depth decisions every 7 days. Fig. 3a is generally
    referred to as the learning curve and tracks the agent''s performance as a function
    of training steps (i.e., number of irrigation decisions made and learned from).
    Performance on the training set continues to increase throughout. However, the
    validation set performance declines after approximately 500,000 training steps.
    The divergence between training and validation performance highlights an important
    decision that needs to be made regarding how to report the final DRL performance,
    with which to compare against other irrigation strategies. Once choice is to report
    the highest validation profits achieved by the agent, which would give an indication
    of the potential of DRL if training is stopped at the right moment. However, this
    choice would overestimate the performance of DRL as it assumes knowledge of the
    validation years, which would not be available to a farmer as the validation set
    represents future unknown weather. Another choice is to use the final validation
    set profit after training has stopped, which would not assume any knowledge of
    the validation years. However, as shown in Fig. 3a, there can be large variation
    in validation profits between learning updates, and so choosing just one evaluation
    result may be misleading. Therefore, we instead calculate the rolling mean across
    the previous 10 validation set evaluations (Fig. 3b). When comparing the performance
    of DRL on the validation set, we will report the highest 10-evaluation average.

    The highest point on this rolling average calculation will be reported as the
    validation profit. Comparison with an optimal benchmark irrigation heuristic Previous
    assessments of DRL for irrigation scheduling have only compared DRL agents with
    handpicked schedules or one-value non-optimized heuristics [2,8,38]. A common
    irrigation scheduling heuristic used by farmers in this region is to schedule
    irrigation based on soil-moisture target thresholds. In this approach, irrigation
    is triggered on any day when the soil-water content drops below a threshold level,
    which itself can be varied to account for the changing sensitivity of a crop to
    water deficits during the season. As a benchmark to compare our DRL agent against,
    we consider a farmer who uses a set of four soil-moisture target thresholds corresponding
    to the four main growth stages within AquaCrop. We use aquacrop-gym to identify
    to define a set of four soil-moisture thresholds that maximize average profit
    over the 70 training years. This set of thresholds will then be evaluated against
    the unseen 30 validation years and thus provide the benchmark against which to
    assess the added value of DRL. This benchmark achieves $513 ha−1 on the training
    years and $521 ha−1 on the validation years. The benchmark also achieves $503
    ha−1 when evaluated on the 37 years of historical data that was originally imputed
    into LARS-WG. By comparing these profits to those that could be achieved by directly
    optimizing the heuristic on those 37 historical years ($506 ha−1), we can be confident
    that our approach of using generated data to train and optimize strategies – as
    well as the choice of weather generator – produces robust strategies for the case
    study region. Optimising the heuristic benchmark as well as running DRL training
    experiments were all conducted on a single AMD Ryzen 7 3700X, 3.60 GHz, 8 core
    computer, with a GeForce RTX 3070 GPU. Training 1 million DRL training steps on
    this machine took approximately 4 h, whereas optimizing a set of four soil-moisture
    thresholds took approximately 20 min. Results This section begins by assessing
    how the performance of DRL varies depending on choices of action sets and decision
    frequencies (Section 3.1). Next, the effect of climate variability on DRL performance
    will be assessed (Section 3.2), followed by the introduction of restrictive caps
    on irrigation water use (Sections 3.3). Comparing DRL configurations Table 2 shows
    the mean seasonal profits achieved by different irrigation scheduling methods
    after 1 million training steps. DRL approaches, independent of these choices for
    how irrigation could be triggered, achieved higher profits on the training set
    than the fixed optimized irrigation scheduling heuristic. However, the fixed heuristic
    achieved marginally higher profits than the DRL approaches over the validation
    set. This result illustrates that deep learning algorithms are able to learn complex
    irrigation strategies (as evidenced by the superior training set performance),
    but may not be able to easily transfer those superior strategies into improved
    performance in out-of-sample production scenarios (i.e., the validation set).
    The differences in profit between all strategies are extremely marginal and so
    these results alone cannot be used to definitively rule out any approach as a
    viable method of scheduling irrigation. The discreet depth action set achieved
    the highest validation profit of all DRL scheduling strategies, and so will be
    used as the basis for comparison with fixed soil-moisture threshold (SMT) heuristics
    for the rest of the analysis presented. Table 2. Reported seasonal profits (highest

    depth), we train the DRL agent with decision intervals (1, 3, 5, 7 days) for 1
    million training steps and compare the validation set performance. This comparison
    showed that a decision interval of 3 days resulted in the highest profits over
    both the training and validation set (Table 3). The variation in profits between
    different decision intervals was greater than the profit variations found between
    different action sets (Table 2). This result could indicate that how often the
    DRL agent makes decisions is more important than how the amount of irrigation
    to apply is determined when an irrigation event is triggered, at least for our
    specific crop model environment and case study. Table 3. Reported seasonal profits
    (highest mean profits over 10 evaluations) for different decision intervals using
    the discreet depth action set defined in Section 2.3. Decision Interval Training

    520.1 5 days 515.1 511.0 7 days 510.4 504.0 Climate variability Despite the range
    and distribution of weather scenarios in model training and validation being comparable,
    the results presented in Section 3.1 show that complex DRL scheduling algorithms
    have thus far only been able outperform simpler optimized soil-moisture thresholds
    on the training set. One reason for this underperformance is that specific weather
    scenarios encountered in the validation period are inherently different (e.g.,
    in terms of specific sequencing of rainfall events), despite still having same
    overall statistical distribution (e.g., in terms of total seasonal rainfall).
    By setting the rainfall to zero, and hence reducing the difference between the
    training and validation time series, we expect the performance of DRL to improve
    on the validation set. To test this hypothesis, we removed the rainfall from both
    the training and validation weather dataset used within AquaCrop-OSPy, and retrained
    the DRL agent as well as re-optimized the fixed heuristic benchmark. Table 4 shows
    the difference in profits between the DRL agent and the optimized soil-moisture
    thresholds when rainfall is included or removed. When rainfall was removed, optimized
    fixed soil-moisture thresholds achieved a profit of $300.6 ha−1 on the validation
    set, with reduced profit relative to that found in Section 3.1 due to larger irrigation
    amounts needed to meet crop water requirements across all years. In contrast,
    the DRL agent taking discreet depth actions every 3 days achieved $307 ha−1. This
    result indicates that removing one of the main drivers of variability and uncertainty
    affecting farmers irrigation decisions altered the added value of DRL scheduling
    relative to fixed SMT heuristics from a reduction of $1.27 ha−1 to an increase
    of $6.38 ha−1, the latter a 2.1 % increase in profits compared to the optimized
    heuristic. Table 4. Increase in seasonal profits compared to optimized soil-moisture

    % Water use restrictions The DRL and heuristic strategies evaluated so far have
    operated under unrestricted irrigation, whereby the DRL agent can irrigate as
    much as required. However, this assumption is not realistic to our case study
    region of Nebraska, which imposes yearly or multi-year restrictions on irrigation
    water abstractions. Given that the marginal gains from applying additional water
    are greatest in times of water scarcity, we hypothesise that more complex strategies
    such as DRL may be more valuable when water resources are limited. To assess the
    impact of water use restrictions on the value of DRL, the framework presented
    so far was repeated and water use limits of 75, 100, 125 mm ha−1 were imposed
    on all simulation years. This restriction will prevent any further irrigation
    once the cap has been reached in any given growing season. Table 5 shows the difference
    in profits between the DRL agent and the optimized soil-moisture thresholds for
    these different water use restrictions. Despite only small profit increase, DRL
    does provided added value in these water restricted scenarios compared to optimized
    heuristics. By introducing the most restrictive cap evaluated (75 mm ha−1), the
    value of DRL increased from -$1.3 ha−1 to +$12.2 ha−1, which equates to a 5.6
    % increase in profits compared to the optimized heuristic. Table 5. The effect
    of water use restrictions on validation set profits and added value of DRL compared

    – 0.2 % Discussion Despite the success of optimized heuristics within irrigation
    scheduling, incorporating the increasing amounts of data available to farmers
    into heuristics will require large numbers of complex, interconnected rules that
    will be difficult to design and optimize. Addressing these issues, artificial
    intelligence based approaches such as Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) [33] has
    been suggested as way to automatically and flexibly adjust and adapt decisions
    during the season in response to any relevant information. Recent publications
    have found Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) can be used to learn irrigation strategies
    within crop-simulation frameworks [2,8,38]. In this article we assessed the added
    value of using DRL for irrigation scheduling in comparison to optimized soil-moisture
    thresholds. The first part of the analysis found that allowing the DRL agent to
    choose between a range of discreet irrigation depths (i.e., 0, 2.5, … 22.5, 25
    mm) with frequent irrigation (every 3 days) lead to the highest profits when assessed
    in validation years. More (e.g. 1 every day) or less (e.g. every 5 or 7 days)
    frequent irrigation decision intervals resulted in marginally lower crop profits.
    We attribute this finding to the fact that daily irrigation decisions create the
    most complex irrigation schedules, increasing potential for maladaptive irrigation
    decisions (e.g. irrigation shortly before a rainfall event) to be made by the
    DRL agent as the irrigation schedule solution space grows, whereas longer irrigation
    decision intervals increase risks of crop water stress occurring between days
    when the DRL agent makes choices about irrigation scheduling. Despite performing
    the best compared to other DRL design choices, this was still not enough to surpass
    the profits achieved by a conventional optimized irrigation heuristic in the same
    validation years. When rainfall was removed from the weather data, thereby decreasing
    the difference in weather time series between training and validation sets, the
    DRL agent was now able to increase validation year profits by 2.1 % compared to
    optimized heuristics. Finally, when restrictive irrigation caps were introduced
    (e.g., 75 mm ha−1), the DRL agent was able to increase validation year profits
    by 5.6 % compared to the optimized heuristics. Our analysis found that under normal
    climate variability for the case study region and unrestricted water use, optimized
    soil-moisture thresholds achieved a higher average profit over the validation
    years than the DRL agent. This result broadly agrees with [2]), who found that
    even a non-optimized fixed heuristic achieved higher profits than their DRL agent
    during one of their two test years. This marginal difference in validation year
    profits (from our analysis) found between DRL and optimized heuristic (– $1.3
    ha−1) cannot be taken as an exact quantitative comparison on its own, as another
    set of validation years could cause this value to vary. Differences between how
    DRL performance is reported – i.e., when training is stopped, how validation set
    profits are calculated, and how many training repetitions are performed – can
    also lead to this difference in profits to vary slightly. However, the qualitative
    result that DRL agents struggle to surpass optimized thresholds is likely to remain,
    an insight that has been largely neglected in previous DRL assessments [2,8,38].
    This finding that fixed soil-moisture heuristics perform well compared to DRL
    – given the simplicity and intuitive nature of these heuristics – should indicate
    that fixed optimized heuristics are good first step towards increasing productivity
    that producers would be more likely to adopt and implement. Our finding that the
    value of DRL increases with the introduction of restrictive water use caps provides
    important insights about where DRL is best implemented in real world cropping
    systems. As water resources become scarce and demands over them increase [10,25],
    water managers and policy makers may introduce restrictions on total water use
    – as some regions already do [6,39]. Our analysis indicates that DRL may help
    farmers to more effectively schedule limited irrigation water supplies as water
    restrictions become more stringent and variable, with producers potentially being
    able to use these intelligent methods to mitigate impacts of increasing water
    insecurity. Our other finding that increased value in DRL for no-rain scenarios
    implies that DRL may also be better placed in arid areas where there is very little
    rainfall, and thus more limited differences in crop irrigation demands and their
    intra-seasonal distribution from year to year. Although we have been able to evaluate
    different action sets, decision frequencies, water use restrictions and climate
    variability, computational constraints mean we have only mean able to evaluate
    some combinations of these factors in this paper. For example, we assess the effects
    of irrigation decision intervals for discreet depth actions, but further work
    should also explore the interactions between irrigation intervals and other scheduling
    actions or constraints. Additionally, we have neglected comparing other important
    design choices such as different DRL algorithms, hyperparamaters, neural network
    architectures and input observations. For example, using larger neural networks
    or expanding the number of input observations will lead to more complex irrigation
    strategies, and hence potentially increased profits, though at the expense of
    longer training times and higher risk of overfitting. Investigating the effect
    of these and other DRL design choices in the value of DRL will be an important
    area of future work. Applying DRL to irrigation scheduling, as we have done in
    this analysis, presents several issues for DRL that are not seen to the same extent
    in the typical environments DRL has been previously applied in. Assuming deployment
    within a real-world field, the agent will have to make decisions for several months
    or even years before receiving a reward signal (e.g., profits calculated after
    harvesting). This is because the outcome (e.g. crop production or profit) from
    an individual irrigation event is not immediately observed, with a DRL agent only
    observing an outcome and associated reward at harvest based on the combined effects
    of multiple irrigation decisions or choices during the growing season. This issue
    is partly circumvented by training the agent within crop-simulation environments,
    which can simulate whole seasons within seconds. However, the costly and time-consuming
    work of field trials will still have to be conducted eventually to test if model-optimized
    strategies will work as intended. This challenge of transferring simulated learning
    to real-world systems is receiving attention within robotics research [40]. However,
    the months needed to evaluate a single irrigation strategy is unique to irrigation
    scheduling. Another inherent difficulty of applying DRL to irrigation scheduling
    is that there are an arbitrarily large number of environment configurations (e.g.,
    crop, soil, climate, management constrains) that dramatically impact optimal decision-making.
    This issue either requires separate DRL agents to be trained on each configuration
    – which may be too computationally expensive or time consuming, as with optimized
    heuristics – or instead training one agent to make decisions for all configurations
    – which may be too difficult to learn good strategies. Moreover, for farmers to
    adopt a DRL irrigation strategy, the added value will have to be demonstrated
    for their particular configuration, the value of DRL may have to be demonstrated
    in the field for many configurations in order for producers to adopt this new
    scheduling approach. Therefore, this issue of configuration agnostic DRL irrigation
    strategies will be an essential area of future work. Similarly, the irrigation
    scheduling problem specified in this work, and much of the previous literature
    [2,7,8,15,21,38], centres around scheduling irrigation for a single homogenous
    field over a number of seasons. This specification, although simple to implement,
    does favour an optimized heuristic approach (i.e., optimization algorithms can
    comfortably find a set of values that maximize average profits in one field over
    a set of N seasons). However, heuristics do not scale well with increasing complexity,
    for example, if the seasonal water limit changes during the season, the fixed
    heuristics would have to remain sub-optimal or be re-optimized each time the situation
    changes. Another example is in the case of multiple fields or crops, where decisions
    may have to be made about which field or crop to prioritize with the limited water
    supply available. Finally, an example from our case study region is dealing with
    a 5-year allocation of irrigation water supply, meaning decisions must be made
    in the knowledge of how much water needs to be kept for future years. In these
    more complex – and more realistic – modelling scenarios, it is possible that DRL
    will demonstrate increased additional value. Conclusions Due to the increase in
    water scarcity issues globally, researchers are looking for innovative solutions
    to increase agricultural water productivity. One of the methods being investigated
    is Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) which has had recent success inside complex
    decision-making environments. In this article we assess the value of DRL for irrigation
    scheduling in comparison to optimized heuristics for a case study of irrigated
    maize production in southwest Nebraska. By designing a framework for DRL agents
    to interact with the AquaCrop-OSPy crop-simulation model, DRL agents were trained
    and evaluated over separate sets of climate data. Under normal climate variability
    and unrestricted irrigation, DRL failed to increase profits on the validation
    years compared to optimized soil-moisture thresholds. When rainfall was removed,
    and hence the biggest source of climate variability, DRL was able to surpass the
    performance soil-moisture thresholds. With the addition of restrictive irrigation
    caps, DRL was also able to achieve higher profits on the validation years than
    optimized thresholds. Our work firstly highlights that DRL is a promising avenue
    for improving irrigation scheduling, but DRL''s additional value over optimized
    heuristics has yet to be demonstrated for all cases, especially given their increased
    complexity and data requirements. Conversely, optimized heuristics – given their
    relative simplicity – should be seen as an important first step to improving water
    productivity, before making large investments in AI based approaches. Ethics statement

    To support research into these areas of future work, we created aquacrop-gym,
    an open-source python library that supports the training of DRL agents and comparisons
    between irrigation strategies within AquaCrop-OSPy. Training materials have been
    developed that guide the user to training their own DRL agents and duplicate the
    analysis presented in this work. The intention of this library is to be an actively
    developed framework that future researchers can test new irrigation strategies
    and compare them to the current best approaches. This framework will accelerate
    progress in optimized and intelligent irrigation scheduling research, as well
    as how rapidly this research can be converted to production. All code used in

  description: Attaining sustainable agriculture requires water consumption management.
    A water allocation optimization model was developed for the Moghan irrigation
    network (northwest of Iran) based on the AquaCrop plug-in model. The genetic algorithm
    was applied to optimize water allocation for five main crops, including wheat,
    first-cultivation maize, second-cultivation maize, soybeans, and alfalfa. The
    heuristic economic utility (EU) function was used as the objective function to
    optimize water allocation. In this function, drained water salinity was applied
    as a penalty factor to the total benefit, and soil salinity deterioration due
    to irrigation was also considered as a factor in each crop’s benefit. The results
    showed that the optimal allocated water depth was 17% less than the normal water
    consumption. Moreover, the application of soil water salinity coefficients did
    not affect the ratio of EU to EB (economic benefits) for wheat and alfalfa. However,
    first-cultivation maize, second-cultivation maize, and soybeans cultivation led
    to a reduction in EU within the study area. A combination of the crops cultivation
    led to a change in river water quality and an 8.2% reduction in the ratio of EU
    to EB function.

    optimization of regional agricultural water use by developing a two-level optimization
    model Article 06 February 2020 Introduction Since agriculture is the largest consumer
    of water among different sectors, optimal water usage in agriculture has the most
    significant effect on water management. To overcome the water shortage and make
    maximum use of the limited available water, the allocation and scheduling of irrigation
    water should be done optimally (Kanooni & Monem, 2014). The optimal allocation
    and irrigation scheduling have been conducted based on two approaches: fixed demand
    (Monem and Namdariyan., 2005; Mathur et al., 2009) and variable demand (Kanooni
    & Monem, 2014; Oad et al., 2009). In the first approach, irrigation is scheduled
    with the assumption of constant demand and without knowing the water needs of
    the irrigation unit and based on the consumers’ request. However, in the second
    approach, crop type, climatic conditions, and soil moisture are influential, and
    optimal irrigation scheduling is determined based on actual demands (Li et al.,
    2020). The simulation models used in irrigation programs provide the possibility
    of checking and predicting the system’s behavior in the face of various variables,
    saving costs and making more appropriate decisions. They also reduce the limitations
    of field research, including time-consuming and lack of human resources (Bastiaanssen
    et al., 2007). The AquaCrop model has been evaluated for irrigation scheduling
    in different climatic conditions (Guo et al., 2021; Li et al., 2018; Linker et
    al., 2016). In recent years, irrigation scheduling has been optimized using plant
    simulation models such as AquaCrop instead of extracting experimental production
    functions (Kheir et al., 2021; Martinez-Romero et al., 2021). Meta-heuristic algorithms,
    such as genetic algorithm, has been used for various optimizations, including
    irrigation scheduling. The Genetic algorithm has led to reasonable outcomes in
    different fields (Rath et al., 2018; Wabela et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2019). The
    single-objective optimization for irrigation scheduling has been gradually replaced
    by multi-objective procedures, which have conflicting objectives without a unique
    optimal solution (Guo et al., 2021). The AquaCrop model was used to optimize the
    winter wheat irrigation schedule under dry, normal, and wet hydrological scenarios.
    The optimization objectives in their research included crop yield, irrigation
    water use efficiency (WUE), and economic benefit (EB). The results showed that
    the optimal irrigation scheduling performed better than the usual farmers’ schedule.
    It also led to an increase in crop yield, EB, and WUE (Guo et al., 2021). This
    study was conducted only for one crop in various hydrological scenarios. García-Vilaa
    and Fereres (2012) used AquaCrop and a farm-scale optimization model to optimize
    the water consumption of some selected crops. They showed that using crops with
    lower water consumption freed up water to produce crops with more water consumption
    and higher economic value. They used the AquaCrop model to extract the production
    functions of the crops, and the AquaCrop model was not combined with the optimization
    model for successive executions. The crop yield, EB, and water charge were among
    determining factors for irrigation scheduling and water resource allocation that
    should be considered during optimization (Rath et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2008).
    Past research shows that the drained water salinity of rivers (Somlyody, 1998;
    McBride, 2002), and soil salinity (Connor et al., 2012; Nemoto & Sasakuma, 2002)
    are factors that affect crop yield and optimal water resources allocation. The
    increase in the environmental pollutants loaded into rivers through industrial,
    urban, and agricultural activities has resulted in changing the rivers’ water
    quality indices (Jahin et al., 2020). Salinity is one of the primary indices of
    rivers’ water quality, which quantifies water-soluble salts (Quinn, 2011). Enhancing
    water quality and reducing its salinity requires efficacious efforts to manage
    water resource utilization (Somlyody, 1998; McBride, 2002). To this end, managing
    farms drained water entering the rivers is one of the most effective practices
    to preserve long-term cropping yield benefits. Water and soil salinity are environmental
    hazards leading to soil deterioration and a reduction in agricultural efficiency,
    especially in arid and semi-arid regions such as Iran (Connor et al., 2012; Alizade
    Govarchin Ghale et al., 2017). Furthermore, salinity is a major factor in limiting
    crop growth by reducing root water and nutrient uptake (Wilkinson, 2000). The
    increase in soil electrical conductivity brings about salt stress and crop biochemical
    and physiological changes, which reduces crop growth and yield (Nemoto & Sasakuma,
    2002). Hence, soil physical and chemical properties, irrigation water quality,
    and their management play an important role in long-term farm management (Douaik,
    2006). The EB function is considered the main objective function in most studies
    related to irrigation scheduling (Rath et al., 2018; Kumar & Yadav., 2019), while
    the economic utility function (EU), which in addition to EB, considers the long-term
    environmental effects and the production sustainability, has not been evaluated.
    In this study, the heuristic EU function is used instead of the EB for optimal
    irrigation water allocation. This heuristic function is proposed instead of the
    EB function by applying two coefficients of soil salinity and the salinity of
    drained water to the river. By applying the two coefficients, in addition to maximizing
    the EB in the same year, the long-term environmental effects caused by the cultivation
    of different crops, soil quality preservation, river water quality variation,
    sustainable agriculture, and long-term benefits are also evaluated. To evaluate
    crop yield response to water, the AquaCrop plug-in model has been used instead
    of experimental production functions such as Doorenbos and Kassam (Doorenbos et
    al., 1979). Therefore, the present study aims to maximize the EU and optimal water
    and land allocation for five main crops in a part of the Moghan irrigation network
    in the northwest of Iran using the genetic algorithm optimization method incorporated
    with the AquaCrop model. Materials and Methods Study Area The Moghan Plain is
    located in the northwest of Iran. The Moghan irrigation network is fed by the
    Aras River and irrigates 72,000 ha of the Moghan Plain agricultural lands, as
    shown in Fig. 1. According to the statistics and information of the regional water
    company of Ardabil, a part of Aras River water extracted by the Moghan network,
    the other part enters the Mil network of Azerbaijan, and the rest overflows the
    diversion dam and flows back to the Aras River and finally leads to the Caspian
    Sea. The volume of and salinity of water transferred back to the Aras River, for
    the years 2011–2020 are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. The study site is part of
    this network, located in the Pars-Abad region and irrigated by canal M with a
    covered area of about 2000 ha and 3 m3/s capacity. This area was considered an
    irrigation analysis unit (IAU). In the 2020 agricultural year (Sep. 2020–Aug.
    2021), the main cultivated crops in the study area were wheat, grain maize (first
    cultivation maize, second cultivation maize), soybeans, and alfalfa. In this research,
    mean long-term data (20 years) of the Pars-Abad weather station were used to prepare
    meteorological information (Fig. 4). Table 1 shows some information related to
    the studied crops. The information about the crops in the region was obtained
    from the Agricultural Organization of Ardabil Province. The unit price of the
    crops was also collected from the reports of the Iranian Statistics Center. According
    to the Agricultural Water Price Stabilization Law, average water charge from modern
    networks is 3% of the crop yield. Fig. 1 Location of Moghan irrigation network

    irrigation network in 2020 Full size table AquaCrop Model The AquaCrop model is
    an advanced program published by the World Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
    The development of this model is based on biophysical interactions in the plant-soil-atmosphere
    system (Sandhu & Irmak, 2019). Evapotranspiration calculation in this program
    is based on the dual crop coefficient method (Steduto et al., 2012). This model
    simulates the crop yield as a function of water consumption in different irrigation
    regimes. It also connects crop yield to crop water consumption and estimates the
    amount of biomass resulting from actual crop transpiration through normalized
    water productivity, which is the core of AquaCrop’s growth engine (Steduto et
    al., 2012). In the AquaCrop model, the yield is calculated based on the product
    of crop dry matter (B) and the harvest index (HI) (Eq. 1). Separation of yield
    (Y) into the dry matter and harvest index distinguishes the relationship between
    environment and dry matter production with the relationship between environment
    and harvest index. Therefore, the effect of water stress on dry matter and harvest
    index is investigated separately. The applied changes have led to the development
    of the following Eq. in this model: $$\\text{B=WP}\\sum {\\text{Tr}}$$ (1) $$Y
    = HI \\times B$$ (2) where WP is water productivity (in units of kg (biomass)
    m−2 (land area) mm−1 (water transpired)) and Tr is plant transpiration (mm). AquaCrop
    Plug-in Program FAO has developed the AquaCrop plug-in program, whose calculation
    methods are similar to the standard AquaCrop program (Raes et al., 2012). It provides
    the simulation possibility without a user interface. The plug-in program runs
    consecutive projects and saves each project’s simulation results (daily, 10-day,
    monthly, and quarterly) of each project in an output file that includes information
    about the simulation period, climate, soil, and water balance, and crop yield.
    (Raes et al., 2012). The plug-in program makes it possible to include the AquaCrop
    model in other programs and makes consecutive runs possible without a user interface.
    The AquaCrop plug-in version 6.0 was used in this research. In this study, the
    AquaCrop model was run for each crop in net irrigation water requirement mode
    to find the potential crop yields. The agricultural year was divided into 36 periods
    of 10 days to allocate water to the different crops. The potential yield and the
    corresponding amount of water calculated from the model simulation were then entered
    into the optimization model. The optimization code (i.e., AquaCrop plug-in for
    irrigation scheduling) uses a specified irrigation depth based on the water content
    at field capacity and irrigation time based on the irrigation interval (Generation
    of irrigation schedule). There are some studies in the Moghan Plain for the calibration
    and validation of the AquaCrop model for important crops (Adabi et al., 2020;
    Izadfard et al., 2021). In this research, to determine the calibration parameters
    for the main cultivated crops in the study area, the results of Izadfard et al.
    (2021) were used. The calibrated parameters are shown in Table 2. For forage crops
    such as alfalfa, the average effect of cuttings in the growing season was considered.
    A standard crop coefficient curve was considered, in which only a single value
    for crop coefficient mid needs to be employed for the whole growing season (Allen
    et al., 1998). Table 2 AquaCrop model calibration parameters for the main cultivated
    crops in the study area (Izadfard et al., 2021) Full size table Objective Function
    and Decision Variables The optimal irrigation water management was carried out
    in the IAU under different water requirements conditions on a ten-day scale. The
    decision variables in this model were the amount of irrigation water depth in
    each of the 36 periods as well as the crop cultivation area. Equation 3 represents
    the EB for each crop: $$EB = {\\text{ benefitper crop per hectare }} = \\, \\left(
    {{\\text{crop sales per hectare }} - {\\text{ costs per hectare}}} \\right) =
    \\left( {Y_{i} \\times P_{i} } \\right) - \\left( {C_{i} + P_{w} \\times IR_{i}
    } \\right)$$ (3) where Yi is the yield of crop i (kg/ha), Pi is the market price
    (Rial/kg), Ci represents production cost (Rial/ha), Pwi is water charge (Rial/m3)
    and IR is irrigation depth (mm). The meaning of the production costs is: land
    preparation, planting, cultivating and harvesting. These costs are different for
    each product and for each agricultural year. The amount of IR is calculated by
    dividing the net irrigation depth by the irrigation efficiency (IR = NIR/E). In
    Eq. 4, the EB function for the crop pattern is shown: $$EB = \\left( {\\mathop
    \\sum \\limits_{i = 1}^{n} A_{i} \\times \\left( {Y_{i} \\times P_{i} - C_{i}
    - P_{w} \\times NIR_{i} /E} \\right)} \\right)$$ (4) where NIRi is net irrigation
    depth (mm), E is irrigation efficiency, and Ai is the cultivated area (ha). Water
    allocation in this model was performed to maximize the IAU’s EU for five main
    crops. The selected option for the objective function was assumed to include the
    drainage water salinity as a penalty factor in the total benefit and the effect
    of soil water salinity as a factor in each crop’s benefit. Therefore, considering
    the soil water salinity and drainage water salinity, the EU function can be calculated
    as follows, $$EU = \\alpha \\prime \\left( {\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^{n} {\\gamma_{i}
    \\times A_{i} } \\times \\left( {Y_{i} \\times P_{i} - C_{i} - P_{wi} \\times
    NIR_{i} /E} \\right)} \\right)$$ (5) The coefficient ɣ represents changes in benefit
    due to the soil water salinity effects, and α′ is a coefficient to consider the
    effect of drained water salinity in the total benefit. By applying these coefficients,
    the benefit obtained will not be the net benefit of that year, but the long-term
    environmental effects are also considered. Conditions Governing the Optimization
    Model Using the optimization model, the appropriate combination of cultivation
    is selected among the common crops of the region. The crops’ sowing date, harvest
    date, total cost, and market price are entered into the optimization model. The
    following constraints limit the optimization: 1- The total cultivated area of
    different crops in each period should not exceed the area of arable land in the
    region (Eq. 6). $$\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^{i} {A_{i,d} } \\le AT$$ (6) where Ai,d,
    and AT are the cultivated area of crop i in period d and the total area of arable
    land in the region. d is considered to be ten days in this study. 2- A mild water
    deficit is optimal and can reduce water consumption without reducing yield (Wang
    et al., 2022). In this study, deficit irrigation of less than 25% and over-irrigation
    of more than 25% (to meet the leaching requirement) were prohibited. The net irrigation
    depth variation was limited to: $$0.75 \\times NetIrri_{id} \\le NIR_{id} \\le
    1.25 \\times NetIrri_{id}$$ (7) where, NetIrrii,d and NIRi,d are, the crop irrigation
    requirement and the irrigation depth for crop i in period d. 3- The total volume
    of irrigation water used for crops in each period should not exceed the available
    water volume in that period (Eqs. 8 and 9). $$V_{d} = \\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^{i}
    {IR_{i,d} } \\times A_{i}$$ (8) $$V_{d} \\le W_{d}$$ (9) where IRi,d, and Vd are
    the depth of gross irrigation water for plant i in period d and the total volume
    of water used for all crops in period d. Wd is the volume of available irrigation
    water in period d. 4- The discharge of drainage water should not lead to an increase
    in the salinity of the river water more than the permissible limit. Drained water
    volume and salinity for each crop can be derived from AquaCrop outputs. Thus,
    the salt amount coming from certain irrigation for each period of IAU which enters
    the river can be obtained from the average cultivated crops’ salinity in that
    period (Eq. 10). Furthermore, the river water salinity at output location in a
    certain period before the entrance of drainage water and its volume is available.
    Therefore, the river water salinity after the entrance of the drained water derives
    as follows: $$ECdrain_{d} = \\frac{{\\mathop \\sum \\nolimits_{i = 1}^{i} ECdrain_{i,d}
    \\times Vdrain_{i,d} }}{{\\mathop \\sum \\nolimits_{i = 1}^{i} Vdrain_{i,d} }}$$
    (10) $$ECriver_{d} - \\bmod = \\frac{{\\left( {ECriver_{d} \\times Vriver_{d}
    } \\right) + \\left( {ECdrain_{d} \\times Vdrain_{d} } \\right)}}{{Vriver_{d}
    + Vdrain_{d} }}$$ (11) In these equations, ECdraind is the average electrical
    conductivity of the drained water in period d, ECriverd –mod represents the river
    EC after receiving the drained water, ECdraini,d is the contribution of crop i
    to the salinity of drained water in period d, Vdraini,d is the volume of the drained
    water due to irrigation of crop i, ECriverd is the salinity of the river at the
    outlet before receiving drained water, Vriverd is the volume of the river water
    in period d at the outlet before receiving drained water, and Vdraind is the total
    drained volume in period d. To consider the drained water salinity as a penalty
    factor in the benefit, the coefficient C is calculated every day by Eq. 12. $$C
    = \\frac{{ECriver_{d} - \\bmod - ECriver}}{ECriver}$$ (12) In case the river water
    salinity after the entrance of the drainage water is lower than the river water
    salinity at the output location before the entrance of drainage water, C is lower
    than or equal to zero. In such cases, there is no need to apply a punishment coefficient
    (α′) (i.e., α′ equals one). In contrast, if the entered drainage water increases
    the river water salinity, C exceeds zero, and α′ can be applied. Moreover, the
    punishment coefficient intensifies according to the salinity increment. The α′
    is calculated daily, and an average yearly coefficient applies to the objective
    function. α′ values for the Moghan region were derived based on local experts’
    observations and suggestions, as shown in Table 3. Noteworthy, α′ regional coefficients
    can be modified depending on the initial river water salinity and its environmental
    effects. Table 3 Suggested values for determining the α′ coefficient Full size
    table 5- Cultivation should not drastically affect soil salinity in the root zone
    to achieve sustainable agriculture and maintain soil quality. Therefore, in this
    study, the soil water salinity coefficient (ɣ) was determined by multiplying two
    salinity change coefficients in the range of in-class coefficient (ɣ1) and the
    class change coefficient (ɣ2) (Eq. 13). If initial soil salinity (ECso) and soil
    water salinity after irrigation of plant i (ECswi) are known (which are outputs
    of the AquaCrop model), salinity classes are also considered based on the Wilcox
    diagram (Table 5), and each class changes between ECmin and ECmax, ɣ1 and ɣ2 can
    be obtained from Table 4. It should be mentioned that the coefficient within the
    class is applied exponentially (Table 5). $$\\gamma = \\gamma_{1} \\times \\gamma_{2}$$

    lower than one, and vice versa. Furthermore, if the amount of reduction or increase
    in the soil water salinity in the root zone after the end of the irrigation does
    not exceed ECmin and ECmax of the Wilcox index, ɣ2 equals one, which shows no
    change in the soil salinity class. Otherwise, ɣ2 is considered lower (ECswi > ECmax)
    or higher than one (ECswi < ECmin), which leads to a change in the soil salinity
    class. ɣ1 and ɣ2 values for the Moghan region were suggested in Table 4 based
    on an engineering judgment. Undoubtedly these values could be enhanced with more
    experience and based on economic evaluations. Applying these coefficients (ɣ1
    and ɣ2) to the objective function accounts for the crop cultivation effects on
    production stability and long-term benefit. To this end, an increase in soil salinity
    destabilizes the production and reduces the long-term benefit while a reduction
    in soil salinity improves the production stability and long-term benefit (although
    it may not affect the current year''s benefit). Genetic Optimization Algorithm
    Researchers developed algorithms to optimize any alternative issue in the agriculture
    (Osroosh et al., 2016), being stochastic or deterministic among the most accepted
    algorithms. The evolutionary algorithms allow changing a result to change until
    receiving the optimal solution by seeking a process that simulates living beings
    in nature, such as genetic algorithms (Villacampa et al., 2019). Since AquaCrop
    software is needed to calculate the crop yield without any provided formula, it
    is not feasible to use the optimization software and solve the mathematical model.
    Genetic algorithm has been used in many studies to generate irrigation data and
    crop area (Guo et al., 2021; Rabie et al., 2015; Shen et al., 2021). Hence, in
    this research, the genetic algorithm optimization method was used to allocate
    water to crops in the Moghan network. A genetic algorithm is one of the intelligent
    methods for optimization problems. This algorithm is based on repetition. In this
    method, a set of decision variables or chromosomes that are effective on the objective
    function forms the initial population (possible solutions). Maintaining genetic
    operators such as selection, cross and mutation on the decision variables of the
    initial population leads to the production of a more competent generation. This
    process is repeated in different generations (Goldberg, 1989). Thus, members or
    better solutions evolve over generations. Then, based on the value of the objective
    function, it categorizes the best answers among the answers in the form of the
    new generation. This process is repeated until a new generation is not produced.
    The produced irrigation data is used as an input to AquaCrop, and the crops’ yield
    is derived as an output from the model. In addition to the yield, drainage water
    salinity for each crop is also calculated by AquaCrop. To this end, C# coding
    was done in Visual Studio. Results and Discussion Water Optimal Allocation The
    optimal cultivated area of the studied crops was obtained by running the optimization
    program. Figure 5 shows the cultivated area of the IAU in the current conditions
    compared to the optimal allocation conditions. The numbers in the figure demonstrate
    the difference between the existing cultivated crop areas compared to the optimal
    allocation conditions. The model prioritized crops with more EU and less water
    requirement than other crops by reducing costs and complying with restrictions.
    In the optimal cropping pattern, the cultivated areas of wheat, first-cultivation
    maize, and alfalfa have increased by 2.5%, 3.2%, and 3.4%, respectively, compared
    to the initial cultivated area. Among the crops, wheat requires less water than
    other crops, whereas first-cultivation maize and alfalfa have a higher water requirement.
    Their cultivation area has increased more due to their higher yield and, as a
    result, greater economic value than the other crops. The cultivated areas of second-cultivation
    maize and soybean experienced a reduction of 2.3 and 1.8 percent. Fig. 5 Comparison
    of the existing and optimal cultivated area of the Moghan irrigation network crops
    Full size image The AquaCrop model was run for each crop in the net irrigation
    water requirement mode. Therefore, the maximum crop yield and the water depth
    calculated from the implementation of this model were considered normal conditions.
    Table 6 compares the allocated crops'' water depth in two normal and optimal conditions.
    According to Table 6, the allocated water depth in the optimal conditions for
    all crops is lower than the allocated water depth in the normal conditions. The
    highest percentage of reduction in the allocated water depth is related to the
    alfalfa by 24%, and the lowest is related to the first-cultivation maize by 10%.
    A fraction of the first-cultivation maize’s water requirement, during the growing
    season, is supplied with rainfall. Alfalfa, a crop that grows and develops throughout
    the year, has received less water than other crops. For all the investigated crops,
    the allocated water depth in the optimal condition compared to the normal condition
    has saved water consumption by 17%. The optimal distribution of water in different
    growth periods of each crop is shown in Fig. 6. The model can run a deficit irrigation
    of less than 25% and an over-irrigation of less than 25%. For soybean (Fig. 6d),
    first-cultivation maize (Fig. 6b), and second-cultivation maize (Fig. 6c), the
    optimal water depth distribution in the entire growth stages has been less than
    the normal water depth. However, for the wheat (Fig. 6a) in the 34th and 35th
    growth stages (the last ten days of February and the first ten days of March),
    7 and 17% over-normal water were considered. For the alfalfa (Fig. 6e) in the
    fourth growth stage (last ten days of April), 15% over-normal was considered.
    Since in the previous irrigation periods, the optimum water depth was lower than
    the normal water depth, it caused a decrease in the soil moisture content in the
    root zone. Therefore, to compensate water content, the model has chosen over-irrigation,
    which, in addition to compensating the soil moisture, it also helps to leaching.
    In the remains of the growth stages of wheat and alfalfa, the optimal water depth
    distribution was lower than the normal water depth. Table 6 Comparison of the
    crops allocated water depth in normal and optimal conditions Full size table Fig.
    6 Comparison of normal and optimal water depth distribution in growth stages of
    wheat (a), first-cultivation maize (b), second-cultivation maize (c), soybean
    (d), and alfalfa (e) Full size image EB The volume of water consumed by the IAU
    and the amount of EB for two normal and optimal conditions are given in Table
    7. In the conditions of optimal water allocation, the volume of allocated water
    decreases by 14.7%, while EB increases by only 5.7%. Therefore, the optimal water
    allocation in this area encourages saving water consumption more than increasing
    benefit. Saving water consumption causes a slight increase in EB due to the small
    water charge in the Moghan network. As a result, water users consider water a
    worthless commodity and use it without economic considerations. Meanwhile, if
    the correct price for water is determined, the EB will increase to a greater extent.
    The former researchers'' findings have shown that a water charge is an important
    option for saving water for farmers (Chu and Grafton., 2020). Also, if the water
    charge is set correctly, the farmers will be sensitive to it (Huang et al., 2010).
    The study by Cortignani and Severini (2009), conducted in Italy, showed that increasing
    water charges by 200 and 300 percent and applying five to ten percent water reduction
    policies are effective in reducing water consumption. Table 7 Comparison of the
    EB and the volume of water consumed in normal and optimal conditions Full size
    table Water Productivity Table 8 shows the potential crop yield values after optimization
    and the water productivity for each crop. The results indicate that the water
    productivity index has increased after optimization for all crops. Alfalfa has
    the most significant increase in water productivity (by 35%), with a 24% decrease
    in the allocated water depth. Kanooni (2013) also presented similar results for
    the current study area. Table 8 Water productivity values in normal and optimal
    conditions Full size table The Effect of Soil Water Salinity Coefficient on EU
    It has been shown that the AquaCrop model could be a feasible tool to predict
    the soil salinity change trend (Mohammadi et al., 2016; Pourgholam-Amiji et al.,
    2021). The soil water salinity values (ECSW) after the completion of irrigation
    of each crop, which are the outputs of the AquaCrop model in the optimization
    model, are presented in Table 9. Based on detailed soil studies, the studied area
    has different types of soils. However, according to the detailed soil science
    report of the canal a area, the dominant soil of the Pars-Abad series has a salinity
    of 1.8 ds/m, which is placed in the medium class of salinity (Table 5), according
    to Wilcox''s classification. The results of Table 9 indicate that the soil water
    salinity for first and second-cultivation maize and soybean after the completion
    of irrigation has increased from the initial soil salinity. However, this value
    did not exceed the maximum salinity of the Wilcox classification. Therefore, the
    coefficient of change of class ɣ2 (Table 4) equals 1. For the wheat, due to the
    insignificant difference between the initial soil salinity and soil water salinity
    after irrigation (the difference is less than 0.1), the value of the in-class
    coefficient (ɣ1) and class change (ɣ2) is equal to 1. The crop yield and soil
    salinity could be significantly affected by rainfall conditions (Liu et al., 2019;
    Zhai et al., 2022). In the study area, during the growth period of crops such
    as wheat and the first-cultivation maize, rainfall distribution is higher, and
    crops obtain part of their water requirement from rainfall. During the summer
    season, rainfall is reduced, and the crops’ rainwater usage, such as second-cultivation
    maize and soybeans, which are part of their growth period in summer, is reduced.
    For alfalfa, the soil water salinity after irrigation is equal to the initial
    soil salinity, so for this crop, both the in-class coefficient (ɣ1) and class
    change coefficient (ɣ2) are equal to 1. Crops such as developed alfalfa that have
    extensive roots can be beneficial in lowering the average salinity in the root
    zone (Minhas & Gupta, 1993; Hanks et al., 1990). The roots of an established alfalfa
    can extend to a depth of 2.5 m (Vaughan et al., 2002). Therefore, the results
    indicate that, except for alfalfa and wheat, inappropriate crop rotation and neglect
    of soil salinity management (e.g., using certain fertilizers to prevent and eliminate
    soil salinity) increase the soil salinity over time. (The values of the soil water
    salinity coefficient (γ) for all the studied crops are given in Table 10). Table
    9 Salinity of soil water after completion of irrigation for studied crops Full
    size table Table 10 EB and EU for the studied crops Full size table EU Table 10
    presents the obtainable EB for each crop, the obtainable total EB for the entire
    IAU, and the amount of IAU’s EU. The results show that the IAU’s EB is equal to
    790,821 million Rials. For wheat and alfalfa, the amount of EU (excluding α′)
    is equal to the amount of EB, but the amount of EU (excluding α′) for the first
    and second-cultivation maize and soybeans is 10% is lower than the value of EB.
    The reason for this reduction is the increase of soil salinity in the root zone
    due to the irrigation of these crops. The annual average value of α′ coefficient
    was calculated as 0.97. The value of α′ less than 1 indicates that the inflow
    of drained water produced by the IAU will enter the Aras River in the long term,
    increasing the river water’s salinity. By applying the α′ coefficient as a penalty
    factor in the total benefit, the EU value of the IAU was reduced by 8.2% compared
    to EB. Resultantly, the combination of planting the studied crops will be beneficial
    for the farmers in the same growing season, but in case of choosing incompatible
    plants for the local climate, and not considering the proper measures to prevent
    soil salinity and river water salinity, the EU of the IAU decreases. Furthermore,
    the EU can be increased by planting crops such as alfalfa and wheat, which reduce
    soil water salinity. Conclusions Sustainable agriculture should be environmentally
    compatible with nature and economically beneficial, and this benefit should continue
    in the long term. In this regard, optimization models are valuable tools that
    not only increase benefits but also assess the feasibility of extending the cultivation
    area and can be used for economic analyses. Therefore, in this study, a combination
    of the AquaCrop plug-in model with the genetic algorithm optimization model was
    used for the optimal water allocation in the Moghan irrigation network. The objective
    function in this study was set to maximize the EU heuristic function instead of
    the EB function. The results indicated that the allocated water depth to the IAU
    decreased by 17% in the optimal condition compared to the normal condition while
    the water productivity increased after optimization for all crops. Alfalfa had
    the highest increase in water productivity compared to other crops by reducing
    the allocated water depth by 24%, followed by wheat with a 20% reduction. The
    values of soil water salinity coefficient (γ) showed that in case of mismanagement
    in soil salinity prevention, maize and soybeans increase soil salinity in the
    long term. The α′ coefficient of 0.97 indicated that the combination of five major
    crop cultivation in this area increases the river water salinity in the long term.
    By applying all two mentioned coefficients, the EU value in the IAU was reduced
    by 8.2% compared to EB. Therefore, using the proposed EU, it is possible to identify
    crops that reduce soil salinity and river water salinity, and not only EB but
    also EU is increased. The result of this study can be used by the network managers
    for selecting the best crop pattern in a network scale. Utilizing this approach
    can protect the country’s limited water resources to obtain sustainable agriculture.

    of about 10% was obtained just by scheduling irrigation based on actual crop water
    needs in a very dry agricultural season, while water conservation reached up to
    60% in a wetter season. On average, an additional 7% of water conservation was
    achieved over the agricultural season when the irrigation duration was correctly
    applied to each border of the experimental plots, while approximately 20% of water
    was conserved when the border width was correctly designed based on inflow availability.
    These results provide useful information for improving the management of border
    irrigation in practice, both under current conditions and in prospective of increasing
    freshwater scarcity in the future.

    Agriculture in Changing Climate: A Transboundary Watershed Between Iraq and Iran
    Article 08 March 2016 Introduction The consequences of climate change are being
    experienced globally (Ison 2010), and one of the main areas affected by changes
    in temperature and precipitation leading to an increase in drought events is irrigated
    agriculture (Esteve et al. 2015; Worqlul et al. 2019). Irrigated agriculture is
    particularly vulnerable in areas historically characterized by an abundance of
    freshwater, such as the Padana Plain, the largest irrigated plain in Europe (Nikolaou
    et al. 2020). For example, the 2022 agricultural season was the worst drought
    in the region in the past 70 years, with about 50% less rainfall than the average
    of the past two decades, and storage—including mountain hydroelectric reservoirs
    and natural lakes—was 53% less than the 2006–2020 reference average. As a result,
    the General Confederation of Italian Agriculture declared a 30% loss in crop production
    (especially rice and fodder crops) in 2022, with hundreds of millions of euros
    in damages in the agri-food sector (The New York Times—July 12, 2022, The Guardian—July
    10, 2022). In addition, the presence in the Padana Plain of large areas cultivated
    with intensively irrigated crops such as rice and maize, mainly irrigated with
    surface methods, exacerbates the effects of this water shortage. The modernization
    of surface irrigations (e.g., laser levelling systems, automatic water distribution
    systems in upstream fields) has contributed to improve the efficiency of these
    irrigation methods, which are considered to be water-intensive. Nevertheless,
    due to its low investment cost and the possibility of delivering a significant
    amount of water to a given field in a few times, surface irrigation managed with
    its traditional operation is still widely practiced worldwide (Playàn et al. 2018).
    However, since not all farmers can benefit from a substantial amount of water
    at the same time, a water rotation is usually applied at the irrigation district
    level. This situation significantly reduces the flexibility of this irrigation
    system, i.e. the farmer cannot irrigate when he decides to do so. This lack of
    flexibility is considered one of the main barriers to water savings in surface
    irrigation (Maihlol and Merot 2008, Mailhol et al. 2004). Data from the International
    Commission on Irrigation and Drainage, published on the Food and Agriculture Organization’s
    Aquastat website, show that surface irrigation is used on 97% of the irrigated
    area in India, 94% in China, 44% in the United States, and 100% in Pakistan (i.e.,
    the 58% of the world’s total irrigated area). In general, among the different
    types of surface irrigation, border irrigation is the most common method for watering
    row crops worldwide (Fadul et al. 2020), especially in Australia (Kohec and Langat
    2018), northern China (Liu et al. 2020), and southern Europe (Masseroni et al.
    2017). Despite its low energy costs (compared to pressurized systems), the practice
    of border irrigation is often accused of high inefficiency due to overwatering
    and poor application uniformity (Gillies and Smith 2015; Morris et al. 2015; Chari
    et al. 2019). To address these allegations, EU policies at various levels (from
    regional to national irrigation authorities) are allocating funds for the modernization
    of surface irrigation infrastructure, favoring the transition to new irrigation
    methods rather than increasing the operational efficiency of traditional methods.
    An example was the case of the Spanish government, which launched the National
    Irrigation Modernization Plans (MAPAMA and MAPAMA 2002, 2010) to address deficiencies
    in irrigation projects, water scarcity problems, EU water directives, and changes
    in social structure. These plans took advantage of new information and communication
    technologies for a broad transition to pressurized systems (Playan et al. 2018;
    Zapata et al. 2023). A new plan to improve the efficiency and sustainability of
    irrigated areas in Spain was implemented as part of the European Union’s post-COVID
    recovery and resilience plan (BOE 2021). Similar experiments aimed at modernizing
    surface irrigation practices were carried out in southern France, where models
    were developed to test the impact of a decision rule on hay production at the
    plot scale and for a given climatic scenario (Mailhol and Merot 2008). In Italy,
    a practical example of this transition, which is linked to a preference for switching
    to new irrigation methods rather than improving the operational efficiency of
    traditional one, is demonstrated by the recent approval of 149 projects to “maintain
    the resilience of irrigated agricultural systems to improve the management of
    water resources”, for a total of 1.6 billion euros. Only 10% of these projects
    funded under Mission 2 of the Italian Recovery Plan have in their title a clear
    reference to the implementation of systems to improve the irrigation management
    of existing infrastructures (e.g. monitoring systems, automation and telecontrol)
    rather than the construction of new ones. Since only a few and often isolated
    experiences on surface  irrigation in the EU have been carried out so far to understand
    (i) the current irrigation efficiency of these practices and (ii) the expected
    performance of new management solutions, the above-mentioned policy oriented towards
    a radical conversion of traditional irrigation pratices  really be blamed. In
    light of these considerations, there is an urgent need for studies in this context
    to understand whether alternative solutions to the substitution of traditional,
    gravitational irrigation methods with pressurized systems are actually feasible
    and sustainable. New soft-path strategies aimed at improving traditional irrigation
    techniques and increasing their efficiency are emerging through bottom-up initiatives
    in the form of “information and pilot project actions” with the aim of assessing
    the potential of novel approaches to marginal irrigation management (Masseroni
    et al. 2021). In particular, in this work we go a step further than the results
    obtained by Masseroni et al. (2022) to develop a comprehensive analysis of the
    water conservation potential of optimized surface irrigation management. Specifically,
    this work examines the results of an extensive experimental campaign carried out
    in the years 2021 and 2022, aimed at (i) analyzing the actual performance of border
    irrigation in case studies located in the Padana plain, (ii) testing and simulating
    the effects on water consumption of a more flexible scheduling of irrigation interventions
    and (iii) exploring to which extent optimizing the intervention management variables
    (discharge per unit width and cut-off time) and the field layout can contribute
    to increasing the efficiency of border irrigation. This work focuses on a specific
    case study, but we believe that its results provide indications for improving
    border irrigation that are valid in general. Material and methods The study domain
    The irrigation performances and the new irrigation management were studied and
    tested on two different fields located in the Padana plain during the agricultural
    seasons 2021 and 2022. The two fields (fields A and B), each about 1.5 ha in size,
    are located 2 km from each other in the area south of Lake Garda, within the same
    130 ha irrigation district (i.e. the Ponte Trento irrigation district) (Fig. 1).
    The Padana plain has traditionally been characterized by an abundance of freshwater
    resources resulting from a favorable system of mountains, natural reservoirs ,
    rivers and canals that, respectively, generate, store, and then distribute water
    throughout the plain. The study area is characterized by a humid subtropical climate
    according to the Köppen-Geiger classification system (Kottek et al. 2006) and
    the characteristics of the irrigation district can be found in Masseroni et al.
    (2021). Regarding the rainfall pattern, the average value of total rainfall during
    the agricultural season (from 1st April to 30th September) in the past 27 years
    (from 1993 to 2020) was about 230 mm. In the 2021 agricultural season, the total
    rainfall in the study area was about 241 mm (i.e. very close to the historical
    average between April and September), while in 2022 it was about 144 mm (i.e.
    60% less than in 2021), showing that the year 2022 was very dry compared to the
    average of past seasons. Fig. 1 Ponte Trento irrigation district with focus on
    the two experimental fields  (i.e. Field  A at top and Field B at bottom). The
    image shows the land use and type over the district, while for the two experimental
    plots, the location of the soil moisture and water level sensors are shown Full
    size image In the Ponte Trento district, irrigation water is supplied by the Virgilio
    canal (the main canal diverting up to 24 m3 s−1 from the Mincio River) and distributed
    to the fields through a dense and ramified network of irrigation ditches. On average,
    the irrigation season begins each year on April 1 and ends on September 30. The
    nominal flow diverted from the Virgilio Canal and delivered to each field in the
    district is 360 l/s, according to a rigid rotation of 7 days. Therefore, farmers
    are limited to using water for irrigation once a week. All fields in the Ponte
    Trento irrigation district are border irrigated (including Field A and B).  Water
    flows onto the field through a series of steel gates that are manually opened
    in sequence to supply water to each strip, starting from the main supply canal
    located at the upper end of the field. During irrigation, water is distributed
    in the longitudinal direction of the field (i.e., following the field slope) until
    the strip is fully irrigated. Both fields are well leveled, but not laser leveled.
    The water is completely gravity driven from the diversion point to the field with
    zero energy cost for irrigation. No surface runoff is observed during irrigation
    because both fields are closed-ended. Both fields are planted with maize. First
    and second harvest maize were sown in Field A and B, respectively. In field A,
    the maize sowing date corresponded to the literature standards (i.e. around the
    end of March), while in field B, the maize was sown 20 days in delay than in 2021
    (i.e. in mid-June—which is the standard). This was due to the very peculiar dry
    season that occurred in 2022, which drastically limited the availability of surface
    freshwater for irrigation in a large part of the Padana plain. As a result of
    a series of water supply restrictions imposed by irrigation agencies, many farmers
    decided to abandon the second harvest or to postpone the sowing date so that the
    moment of maximum water demand of the plant would fall back to the late summer
    or in autumn, i.e. when rainfall events should be more frequent in the mid-latitudes.
    Additional information on the characteristics of Field A and B (e.g. geometries,
    soil type, crop, sowing and harvesting dates, etc.) is reported in Masseroni et
    al. (2022) and briefly summarized in Table 1. Table 1 Details on the characteristics
    of the experimental fields Full size table Instrumentation and monitoring activity
    A weather station (ATMOS 41, Meter Group®, USA) equipped with a rain gauge, a
    radiometer, an anemometer, and thermo-hygrometer was installed nearby the experimental
    fields (about 500 m from Field A and 1.5 km from the Field B) at the beginning
    of the 2021 agrarian season to continuously monitor agro-meteorological variables.
    In addition, three soil moisture monitoring points were installed within each
    experimental field for evaluating soil water status during the whole irrigation
    season (Fig. 1). Each point was equipped with five soil moisture probes (Teros
    12, Meter Group®, USA) at a depth of 10, 30, 50 and 70 cm for detecting the water
    content down to the lower limit of the root zone. Five soil samples were collected
    at 0–5, 10–15, 30–35, 50–55 and 70–75 cm (i.e., roughly where soil moisture probes
    were installed) to evaluate soil texture and, indirectly, soil hydrological proprieties—these
    latter using pedo-transfer functions implemented within the agro-hydrological
    models used for estimating crop water requirements (see Section “Crop water requirement
    modelling and settings”). The soil, in the sampling points, resulted to have morainic
    terrain proprieties: its texture was predominantly sandy, sandy-loam with a skeleton
    higher than 30%. For each irrigation event, the real flow rate and duration of
    irrigation intervention were monitored for determining the average irrigation
    depth in each strip and onto the field. In all cases, data were collected with
    an hourly time resolution and were aggregated to a daily scale to be used for
    modeling (see Section “Crop water requirement modelling and settings”). The monitoring
    of the border irrigation water depth evolution onto the field (in terms of waterfront
    advance and recession) was performed during two irrigation events, ion 23 March
    2021 for Field A and on 27 July 2021 for Field B. The water depth was detected
    through ten homemade water level devices (ArduHydro—Galli et al. (2022)), which
    were installed along the longitudinal direction of the field as shown in Fig.
    1. The water depth values over the field during the irrigation event were obtained
    as the difference between the distance from the ground surface and from the water
    surface measured by the sensor, respectively, before and during the irrigation
    event. The sensors were installed just before the beginning of the irrigation
    intervention and removed right after the water depth across the field was completely
    depleted. In Field A, the water level sensors were installed at 5, 10, 15, 20,
    30, 50, 75, 105, 140 and 175 m from the head of the field; in Field B they were
    located at 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 85, 100 m. More information on the
    instrumentations and monitoring procedures adopted in both experimental fields
    can be found in Masseroni et al. (2022) and Costabile et al. (2023). Crop water
    requirement modelling and settings Irrigation requirements were estimated by AquaCrop-OS
    (model version 6.0 of Foster et al. (2017) and Steduto et al. (2012)) and used
    to make in-season irrigation scheduling decisions in both fields. Specifically,
    the model was calibrated on the study fields using soil moisture probe measurements,
    and then used to support irrigation decisions.  The model calculates the values
    of total available water (TAW), readily available water (RAW) and critical soil
    moisture (CMC) in addition to estimating the temporal evolution of soil water
    content (SWC). The CMC represents a threshold of soil water content under which
    the soil moisture deficit could affect crop health. A detailed description of
    the features of the model has already been reported in Masseroni et al. (2022)
    and is presented here in Supplementary Material—Supplement 1. Modelling parameterization
    Daily time series of the relevant meteorological variables (i.e. air temperature,
    relative humidity, solar radiation, wind speed and precipitation) needed to simulate
    the gross irrigation demand on Fields A and B were obtained from the weather station
    included in the study area for both years of the experimental campaign. Regarding
    AquaCrop, in addition to the rainfall data, the model requires two sets of calibration
    parameters that include soil and crop characteristics. Regarding the crop characteristics,
    the model estimates the different stages of canopy cover development according
    to Raes et al. (2012). In particular, for fields A and B, the canopy cover parameters
    were calibrated using the leaf area index (LAI) derived from Sentinel-2 images
    (10 × 10 m resolution) using the Biophysical 10 mOp tool of the Copernicus Snap
    software. Specifically, the canopy was derived from the LAI information using
    the method proposed by Hsiao et al. (2009). Figure 2 shows the calibrated canopy
    cover curve compared to satellite observations for each experimental plots in
    both years. Fig. 2 Observed and simulated canopy cover evolution during the two-year
    experiment. The observed canopy cover was derived from Sentinel-2 satellite observations.
    Sowing date and theoretical flowering date (i.e. about 80 days after sowing date
    for the early harvested maize and about 50 days for the late harvested maize according
    to Bonhomme et al. 1994) are indicated in the images Full size image Once the
    canopy cover parameters were obtained, the soil hydrological properties (water
    retention at saturation, at field capacity, at permanent wilting point and saturated
    hydraulic conductivity) were also adjusted by fitting the simulated soil moisture
    patterns from AquaCrop to those observed by the soil moisture probes. For this
    purpose, the rooted soil layer was divided into two layers as folows: an upper
    one, 10 cm deep, where most of the evaporative processes take place, and a lower
    one, of variable depth according to root growth, where most of the root water
    uptake for plant transpiration takes place. The water content of the first layer
    was assumed to be equal to the value measured by the most superficial sensor,
    while that of the lower layer was calculated as the average of the values measured
    by the sensors located inside the layer itself. Roots were assumed to be able
    to explore a maximum of 1 m at full plant growth. The model calibration, performed
    with measurements carried out in the year 2021, resulted in a good fit between
    simulated and observed soil water content, especially during the peaks following
    rain or irrigation events (Fig. 3). The goodness of fit was evaluated by the Root
    Mean Square Error (RMSE), which was found to be very small in both experimental
    fields and in both layers: specifically, about 0.1 m3 m−3 in the evaporative layer
    and approx. 0.04 m3 m−3 in the transpirative layer. Fig. 3 Comparison between
    simulated and observed soil water content (SWC) in the evaporative and transpirative
    layer of the Field A and B. Agricultural season 2021 Full size image Good guideline
    values for the soil physical properties required by AquaCrop (i.e. water retention
    at field capacity, water retention at permanent wilting point, water retention
    at saturation, etc.) have been derived from the hydraulic property calculator
    developed by the USDA Agricultural Research Service in collaboration with Washington
    State University (and already included in the AquaCrop model). These parameters
    were then slightly adjusted to match the simulated soil moisture measurements.
    The calibrated soil and crop model parameters are presented in Table 2, while
    additional information on model parameterization for this specific case study
    can be found in Masseroni et al. (2022). Table 2 AquaCrop soil and crop calibrated
    parameters on the case studies Full size table Dynamics of the border irrigation
    event Dynamics of the irrigation events were investigated using WinSRFR 5.1 model
    (Bautista et al. 2009) developed by the United State Department of Agriculture
    (USDA). It represents a new generation of software for analyzing surface irrigation
    systems. Founded on an unsteady one-dimensional flow hydraulic model, the software
    integrates event analysis, design, and operational analysis functionalities, in
    addition to simulation. The software has a user-friendly interface, from which
    the user can edit data, run the analysis, and view outputs. Performance indicators
    generated by the software include the application efficiency (AE), low-quarter
    irrigation adequacy (ADlq), minimum irrigation adequacy (ADmin), low-quarter distribution
    uniformity (DUlq), minimum distribution uniformity (DUmin), runoff (RO) and deep
    percolation (DP) fractions (Burt et al. 1997). In both experimental fields (i.e.,
    Field A and Field B), the model was applied in the simulation mode, operation,
    and design analysis. These simulation environments can simulate unsteady surface–subsurface
    flow for individual strips. Flow rate, irrigation duration, strip geometries,
    and downstream conditions (i.e., blocked borders) were introduced into the model
    prior to simulation. Contrary to the other irrigation systems, the irrigation
    operation in the border irrigation methods is strongly influenced by the waterfront
    advance process. The latter is itself influenced by the soil water status (soil
    water deficit) just before the start of irrigation. Consequently, the irrigation
    decision should not only be based on the soil water deficit, but also take into
    account the impact of this water deficit on the advance process. Therefore, infiltration
    process was described by the Green-Ampt equation (Green and Ampt 1911), where
    saturated water content, wetting front pressure head, and saturated hydraulic
    conductivity were derived from soil texture characteristics using literature information
    and then adjusted as appropriate after the calibration step. Instead, the initial
    volumetric water content was determined from the soil moisture probes installed
    in the fields. Manning resistance was also calibrated, while the average longitudinal
    slope of the strip was used to describe the soil. Model calibration consisted
    of finding a unique set of infiltration and roughness parameters that provided
    a good description of the waterfront advance and recession curves. This was achieved
    by comparing the model predictions of the waterfront evolution with the ArduHydro
    measurements along the longitudinal direction of the field. The best fit obtained
    between the observed and simulated advance and recession curves in the two monitored
    irrigation events of May 23, 2021 (in Field A) and July 27, 2021 (in Field B)
    is presented in Fig. 4, while the best infiltration and roughness parameters obtained
    through a manual trial-and-error calibration are presented in Table 3. Fig. 4

    design and simulations The experimental campaign at field scale was organized
    in two successive moments: the first year was mainly dedicated to the field observations
    and the second year was dedicated to the implementation of new border irrigation
    management strategies. The field observations consisted in studying the farmers’
    attitudes during irrigation, i.e. monitoring the number of irrigation interventions,
    water consumption and the dynamics of waterfront evolution on the field. In the
    second year, flexible irrigation scheduling was tested on both experimental plots.
    Specifically, each experimental field was divided into two different sectors as
    follows: the first one (including the first and second strips of Field A and B)
    was managed with “on-demand” irrigation (i.e., irrigation was triggered when the
    observed soil water content—SWC—reached a critical soil moisture condition—CMC—corresponding
    approximately to about 70% of the readily available water—RAW), while the second
    (including the third, fourth and fifth strips of field A and the third and fourth
    strips of field B) was irrigated according to the experience of the farmers and
    following the 7-day rigid rotation (hereafter “rigid rotation”) imposed by the
    irrigation agency. In the “on demand” sectors, the calibrated AquaCrop model was
    used to decide on the triggering of the irrigation intervention. Specifically,
    each day the weather information registered by the weather station was sent to
    a dedicated personal computer where the Matlab version of the AquaCrop model (the
    latter customized for Field A and B) was launched. Daily SWC (simulated by the
    model) was compared with CMC threshold to decide whether or not to irrigate. The
    decision was additionally supported by rainfall forecasts of a few days beyond
    that provided by free weather services, but in this work rainfall forecasts were
    not included in the AquaCrop model. In both sectors, the duration of each irrigation
    event (and thus the applied irrigation depth) was decided by the farmers according
    to their experience, without any intervention by the researchers. In the agricultural
    season 2021 (i.e. when the irrigation is triggered according to the “rigid-rotation”
    scheduling), potential scenarios of “on-demand” irrigation were studied using
    the AquaCrop model with daily weather data recorded by the agro-meterological
    station in the study area, with the aim of investigating their impact on the soil–water
    balance, reduction of the number of irrigation interventions and water conservation.
    In this case, the gross irrigation depth at each irrigation intervention was considered
    equal to the mean of the irrigation depths applied by the farmers in the 2021
    irrigation season. Finally, two modelling exercises to evaluate how different
    irrigation durations (cut-off times) and boundary geometric layouts can affect
    irrigation performance and water consumption were carried out on Field A and B
    using the WinSRFR model. In Field A, the model was used in the “operational analysis”
    mode to optimize irrigation durations as a function of the observed range of inflow
    rates provided by the irrigation agency during the 2021 and 2022 agricultural
    seasons. The analysis was performed using performance contours, which show the
    variation of irrigation performance indices as a function of inflow rate and irrigation
    duration. In Field B, instead, WinSRFR was used in the “design analysis” mode
    to find optimal values of strip width and field slope for given infiltration and
    hydraulic roughness characteristics, target infiltration depth, and available
    inflow rate (the latter occurring during the July 27, 2022 calibration event).
    In Table 4 summarizes the list of experiments conducted on Fields A, B. Table
    4 List of tests and simulations carried out on the experimental fields Full size
    table Performance indicators The performance of flexible irrigation scheduling
    was evaluated through different parameters such as number of irrigation interventions,
    water consumption, quantity and quality of crop production. Regarding the performance
    of the irrigation operation, they were evaluated through the minimum irrigation
    adequacy (ADmin) indicator as follows: $$AD_{\\min } = \\frac{Minimum \\,infiltrated
    \\,depth}{{Water\\, required\\, in\\, the\\, root \\,zone}} = \\frac{{D_{\\min
    } }}{{D_{req} }},$$ (1) where Dmin is the minimum infiltrated depth (i.e. minimum
    infiltration value along the final infiltration profile in accordance with WinSRFR
    5.1 Manual). AD provides an estimate of irrigation adequacy (under-irrigation,
    adequate irrigation, over-irrigation), i.e. it indicates the ability of an irrigation
    intervention to deliver the right amount of water in the effective root zone to
    meet the irrigation demand (Dreq). In general, the required depth of application
    is chosen based on the expert judgment of the user, and in our study, we found
    it reasonable to assume that it is equal to the readily available water. Returning
    to AD characteristics, Burt et al. (1997) reported that a field is under-irrigated
    if ADmin < 1, adequately irrigated if ADmin = 1, and over-irrigated if ADmin > 1.
    In our work, the ADmin indicator was preferred to application efficiency (AE)
    (which is considered the linchpin indicator for evaluating the performance of
    irrigation operations—Zerihun et al. 2005) because the latter has recently been
    criticized as being highly dependent on the choice of Dreq (Anwar et al. 2016),
    and the possibility of achieving high AE but inadequate irrigation performance
    by applying less water than the irrigation requirement to minimize losses to deep
    percolation (Irmak et al. 2011). Similarly, ADmin was preferred to the distribution
    uniformity indicator because the latter could reach high values, but at the cost
    of excessive irrigation. Nevertheless, in our work, application efficiency (AE)
    and distribution uniformity (DU) were considered as additional indicators to discuss
    the performance of irrigation operations. Analysis of crop production Laboratory
    analyses were carried out to understand whether the two irrigation management
    practices tested in Field A and B in 2022 (i.e., “on-demand” and “rigid-rotation”)
    had affected the quantity and quality of crop production. First, maize was harvested
    separately for the two sectors and then weighed. Second, three silage samples
    from each sector were randomly collected and analyzed separately in the laboratory
    to determine the level of nutrients, fiber and digestibility of the crop production.
    The differences in silage quality between the two irrigation practices were evaluated
    using a significance test with a p-value threshold of 0.05. Aflatoxins were also
    analyzed as they are the major family of toxins produced when the crop is under
    potential water stress (Chauhan et al. 2008). Details of the forage quality variables
    measured, and the methodology used for laboratory analysis are reported in the
    Supplementary Material—Supplement 2. Results Irrigation performance under the
    flexible watering management The observed number of irrigation events and the
    amount of water applied (i.e., the average depth of water applied to the fields)
    are shown in Fig. 5 for both irrigation seasons (i.e., 2021 under rigid rotation
    only and 2022 under rigid rotation and on demand). Details of the monitored flow
    rate, duration of each irrigation intervention, and irrigation depths for each
    strip and irrigation event are reported in the Supplementary Material—Supplement
    3. Fig. 5 Observed number of irrigation interventions and amounts of water delivered
    during the 2021 and 2022 agricultural seasons in Field A and B. In 2022, the number
    of irrigation interventions and irrigation depths are divided between the sector
    served by an “on-demand” irrigation scheduling and the sector served by a “rigid-rotation”
    irrigation scheduling Full size image During the 2021 agricultural season, the
    farmers carried out 10 irrigation interventions in Field A and 11 in Field B.
    In Field A, the average irrigation depth for each intervention was between 150
    and 200 mm, while in Field B, the irrigation depth ranged between 200 and 300
    mm. In the year 2022, when the “on demand” irrigation scheduling was tested, the
    irrigation interventions in the “on demand” sector of Field A were 7 compared
    to the 9 in the “rigid rotation” sector, while in Field B, 3 irrigation interventions
    were made in the “on demand” sector compared to 5 interventions in the “rigid
    rotation” sector. On average, the irrigation depth for each irrigation intervention
    in both sectors was within the same range of the year 2021 (i.e. about 150 and
    200 mm for the Field A and 200 and 300 mm for the Field B, although with peaks
    of 400 mm in some Field B borders). Comparing the number of irrigation events
    in Field B between the years 2021 and 2022, the farmer’s decision to postpone
    the sowing date was found to be successful, since the late summer and autumn rainfall
    events well supported the satisfaction of the crop water requirements, as shown
    in the water balance described in Section “Soil water balance”. Soil water balance
    The effect of input fluxes (irrigation and rainfall) on the daily soil water content
    (SWC) in the root zone is shown in Fig. 6. The SWC was compared with both the
    Total Available Water (TAW) and the Critical Soil Moisture Content (CMC) and analyzed
    in the two experimental fields during the agricultural seasons of 2021 and 2022.
    Specifically, in 2021 (as already mentioned in Section “Experimental design and
    simulations”), the irrigation depth of each simulated “on demand” irrigation event
    was considered equal to the average of the irrigation depths applied under “rigid
    rotation” in the same year. In 2022, instead, irrigation depths in both sectors
    were those really observed during each intervention. Fig. 6 Seasonal variation
    of Soil Water Content (SWC) for Field A, Field B in the years 2021 and 2022 associated
    with rainfall and irrigation water applied. In the year 2021, the irrigation depths
    under the “on demand” simulation were evaluated as being equal to the average
    of the irrigation depths applied under the “rigid rotation” in the same year.
    The SWC is also compared to the patterns of Total Available Water (TAW) and Critical
    Soil Moisture Content (CMC) Full size image In general, irrigation was triggered
    at both sites before total available water was depleted in both 2021 and 2022.
    On average, the threshold below which irrigation was triggered was about 85% of
    TAW in both fields A and B in 2021 (i.e., when the deficit to field capacity was
    only about 25 mm in field A, 18 mm in B). This shows that farmers have an extremely
    risk-averse attitude when operating under a “rigid-rotation” irrigation schedule,
    preferring to irrigate even when soil water content is still much higher than
    the CMC. This was particularly evident in both fields in 2021 and during two irrigations
    in field B in the first week of September 2022, when the deficit to field capacity
    was only a few millimeters. In these cases, a significant portion of the water
    supplied for irrigation is lost through percolation, which exceeds 900 mm on average
    over the seasons. It is interesting to note that the loss of water from the soil
    by this process was faster than that achieved by root uptake (as shown by the
    change in the slope of the SWC depletion curve when it is found above or below
    the TAW level). The “on demand” irrigation scenario provided for the year 2021
    showed that 5 and 6 irrigation interventions could be saved in Field A and B,
    respectively, if the triggering of the irrigation interventions occurred when
    the soil moisture reached the CMC. The benefits of “on-demand” irrigation scheduling
    are also reflected in the reduction of percolation fluxes. Specifically, the reduction
    in percolation fluxes for each irrigation intervention was proportional to the
    difference between the soil water content at the time of irrigation and the CMC.
    Over the course of a season, simulations show that cumulative water losses due
    to percolation can be reduced by up to 70% by adopting “on-demand” irrigation
    scheduling. In 2022, the farmers’ irrigation management was very different from
    that in 2021, as a direct consequence of the drought situation that occurred in
    the first part of the 2022 agricultural season. This was particularly evident
    in Field A, where a large part of the maize growing season (especially the development
    and maturity stages—i.e. between mid-May and August) was characterized by very
    limited rainfall (about 60 mm of rainfall compared to crop evapotranspiration
    of about 450 mm). This led the farmer of Field A to irrigate the sector under
    “rigid rotation”, using any intervention allowed by the rigid irrigation schedule
    (i.e. once a week). In terms of water balance, the SWC at the time of each irrigation
    intervention was almost always included in the CMC confidence interval (which
    was defined as ± 5% of the CMC value to allow a margin of flexibility—i.e. about
    1–2 days—in the application of the irrigation intervention). Therefore, the differences
    in the number of irrigation interventions between the sector under “rigid rotation”
    and that under “on-demand” irrigation scheduling were very limited, showing that
    under these circumstances (i.e., dry seasons), the rigid irrigation scheduling
    provided by the irrigation agency (i.e., 7-day rotation) was well calibrated.
    Differences in irrigation interventions between “on demand” and “rigid rotation”
    sectors were found only in the first part of the agricultural season (i.e. between
    April and May), where two fewer irrigation interventions were made in the “on
    demand” sector than in the “rigid rotation” one. In Field B, the water balance
    was influenced by the delay of the maize sowing by about twenty days compared
    to the one applied in the year 2021, which allowed to take advantage of the late
    summer/autumn rainfall of about 200 mm in the maize maturity stage (i.e. between
    mid-August to October), compared to the crop evapotranspiration of about 300 mm.
    During this period, the soil was well hydrated, with a deficit from the field
    capacity of a few millimeters. Only three irrigation interventions were carried
    out in the “on-demand” sector, two less than in the “rigid-rotation” one. The
    seasonal volumes of cumulative irrigation, rainfall and crop evapotranspiration
    are reported in Table 5. The values refer to the period from seeding to harvest
    for all experimental fields. Since the cropping periods are different, the total
    amounts of rainfall (R) and evapotranspiration (ETc) also differ between the two
    fields for the same years. Table 5 Seasonal cumulative water balance fluxes (irrigation,
    rainfall, crop evapotranspiration, percolation) for Field A, Field B and in the
    years 2021 and 2022 Full size table In both years, evapotranspiration ranged between
    400 and 500 mm, while rainfall was only able to satisfy a part of the potential
    crop evapotranspiration ETc, ranging between 30 and 50%. The remaining part was
    supplied by irrigation, which ranged between 1000 and 2700 mm. These values are
    about three times higher than those obtained using sprinkler systems (e.g. traveling
    rain gun system), a device widely used for watering maize in alternative to the
    border method (Mayer et al. 2022). Most of the water applied during irrigation
    is lost to percolation, mainly due to the drainage characteristics of the sandy
    soil. It can reach up to 2000 mm over the season. The seasonal irrigation volume
    decreased significantly with the “on-demand” irrigation scheduling. The simulations
    showed that in an average wet year (like 2021), the irrigation volume can be reduced
    by up to 60% if the on-demand irrigation scheduling is implemented (see field
    B in 2021). The reduction in irrigation volume under “on-demand” scheduling is
    most evident in 2021, but is still significant in the dry year 2022, where observations
    revealed that the reduction in irrigation volume between “on-demand” and “rigid-rotation”
    sectors is between 10 and 25%. It follows that the farmer’s decision to postpone
    the sowing date in Field B allowed him to take advantage of a significant amount
    of rainfall during the growing season (about 240 mm), which limited the use of
    irrigation interventions (and therefore the amount of irrigation water) to meet
    crop needs. This behavior was also reflected in the percolation fluxes (i.e.,
    the transition to flexible irrigation scheduling allows a better control of hydrological
    losses). In fact, the water balance components show that there is a strong relationship
    between the irrigation and percolation depths (as shown in Table 5). On average,
    the percolation in both fields (characterized by a very draining sandy soil) exceeded
    the 500 mm during the season with a peak of about 2000 mm in Field B (year 2021)
    under \"rigid rotation\". In this case, an irrigation depth of about 2600 mm (the
    maximum registered in both experimental years) was provided over the season. On
    the contrary, the minimum irrigation depth recorded in 2022 in Field B (i.e. about
    800 mm) resulted in minimum percolation (i.e. 590 mm). Quantity and quality of
    crop production The results of the weighing operations show that the different
    irrigation management did not significantly (p < 0.05) affect the quantity of
    crop production. Specifically, in Field A, 58 t/ha of silage were obtained in
    the sector under “on-demand” irrigation scheduling, while 55 t/ha were obtained
    in the sector under “rigid-rotation”. They are in good agreement with the world
    average yield of 57 t/ha (FAO 2022). In Field B, 29.5 t/ha were obtained in the
    on-demand irrigation sector, while 33 t/ha were obtained in the rigid rotation
    sector. The ratio between silage production and irrigation amount revealed a water
    productivity of about 2.5 kg/m3 in both fields in good agreement with the results
    of Salamati and Abbasi (2022) on surface irrigated maize. The results point out
    significant differences in crop production between field A and B. In particular,
    the crop production in field B was about 40% lower than that obtained in field
    A. This was probably due to the different cultivars and also to the excessive
    delay in the planting date (about 20 days later than in the previous year), which
    hindered the crop development and led to a lower biomass production, as shown
    by the reduced canopy cover in Fig. 2. Regarding the quality of the production,
    the chemical composition and digestibility of the silages obtained in the two
    sectors of field A and B are presented in Table 6. In general, the quality composition
    of the silage in both fields was within the standards registered in 2022 in the
    geographical area of the case study (Gallo et al. 2022). In addition, no evidence
    of Aflatoxin B1 contamination was found in both fields and sectors under the different
    irrigation management (i.e. Aflatoxin B1 < 0.5 ppb). A noteworthy observation
    can be made by analysing the indices that are significantly different between
    the sectors, in particular NDF, NDFD, ADL and starch, which are parameters closely
    related to the digestibility of silage. In general, a good silage product should
    have more starch and less NDF, so that it is more energetic and less fibrous for
    the same dry matter at harvest. In addition, the NDFD, which represents the digestibility
    of NDF, should be high. In field A, these proportions are respected and, in particular,
    in the “on-demand” sector, starch and NDFD are higher than those observed in the
    “rid-rotation” sector. On the contrary, ADL and NDF are lower in the ‘on demand’
    sector than in the ‘rigid rotation’ sector. In area B, significant differences
    were also found in terms of NDFD, with a 6% lower NDFD in the ‘rigid-rotation’
    than in the ‘on-demand’ one. These results, although based on a single experimental
    campaign, show that the adoption of on-demand irrigation management, based on
    triggering irrigation events at the right level of soil water content, has a positive
    effect on crop production quality. Table 6 Comparison between the forage quality
    of silage in the two irrigation management sectors of Field A and B Full size
    table Irrigation performances under different irrigation durations Figure 7a,
    b show the contour plots of two irrigation performance indicators (application
    efficiency and minimum distribution uniformity) in the case of Field A, obtained
    by simulating the irrigation applications with the WinSRFR software under different
    values of inflow rate and irrigation duration. The red area represents the range
    of variation of inflow rate and irrigation duration registered during all the
    irrigation events that occurred in the years 2021 and 2022. Specifically, the
    observed inflow rate ranged between 318 and 350 ls−1, while the irrigation duration
    ranged between 18 and 35 min (0.3–0.58 h) for each strip. The former depends on
    the water supply provided by the irrigation agency and is strictly limited, while
    the latter depends on the farmer’s choice and can be optimized. The dotted line
    represents combinations of inflow rate and irrigation duration that satisfy the
    irrigation requirement everywhere in the irrigated strip (i.e. Dmin = Dreq). In
    general, as expected, AE is maximized in the lower left corner of the graph (Fig.
    7a) and decreases with increasing inflow rate and irrigation duration. Inflow
    rate-irrigation duration combinations to the right and above the dotted line produce
    Dmin > Dreq and represent excessive irrigation of the field. Proper irrigation
    (for an inflow rate between 318 and 350 l/s) can be achieved if the irrigation
    duration is between 26 and 29 min (0.42–0.48 h) (i.e., solution along the Dmin = Dreq
    line). In this case, AE is equal to minimum distribution uniformity (DUmin) (since
    the field has no runoff) and AE is between 70 and 77%. The increase of the AE
    can be obtained only at the expense of a decrease of the DUmin (Fig. 7b) and under
    severe irrigation conditions (especially suffered at the end of the field). In
    fact, uniformity decreases rapidly at irrigation durations lower than 25 min (0.4
    h). In this region of the contour plot, small changes in irrigation duration can
    cause large differences in distribution uniformity (i.e., from 0 to 50%), making
    irrigation operations very delicate. In contrast, on the right side of the dotted
    line, distribution uniformity is less sensitive to changes in irrigation duration
    because the field is overwatered and irrigation demand is more than met. Fig.

    on the contours represents the range of inflow rates and cut-off times observed
    in 2021 and 2022. The dotted line represents the Dmin = Dreq solutions Full size
    image Irrigation performances under different border geometries Figure 8 shows
    the contour plots of application efficiency in the case of Field B, obtained by
    simulating the irrigation applications with the WinSRFR software under different
    values of border width and length. In this simulation, the inflow rate was fixed
    and equal to the one that occurred during the July 27, 2021 irrigation event (i.e.,
    355 ls−1), while the slope is equal to the average slope of the field (i.e., 6.1
    ‰). The graph shows only solutions that satisfy the condition Dmin = Dreq (i.e.,
    where the application efficiency values match those of the distribution uniformity),
    and for this reason the contours of the minimum distribution uniformity are similar
    to those shown in the application efficiency graph and are not shown here. The
    red dotted lines represent the actual border width and length (30 and 113 m, respectively).
    Figure 8 suggests that high application efficiency and distribution uniformity
    (~ 80%) can be obtained in a range of border widths between 16 and 20 m (i.e.
    discharge per unit field width of 18–22 ls−1 m−1), while both indicators appear
    less sensitive to variation in border length. Fig. 8 Contour plot of application
    efficiency as a function of border width and length. The intersection of dotted
    lines represents the application efficiency and cut-off ration of the actual configuration
    Full size image The analysis of the influence of the longitudinal slope on the
    irrigation performance indices (in terms of application efficiency and cut-off
    time) is presented in Fig. 9. The graph was obtained by successive simulations
    with WinSRFR from a range of allowable slopes between 1‰ and 10‰, as proposed
    by Gonzales et al. (2011). The inflow rate and boundary width were kept constant
    and equal to the experimental values (355 l/s and 33 m). The results show that
    the maximum AE is obtained in a range of slopes between 3‰ and 6‰, associated
    with a minimum irrigation duration of about 33 min (0.55 h) (very close to that
    applied during the event of July 27, 2021). The trend of AE decreases both before
    and after this range, due to the excess of percolation water found in the first
    part of the field (when the slope is close to zero) and in the last part of the
    field (when the slopes exceed 6‰). Conversely, at the extremes of the slope range
    (i.e., below 3‰ and above 6‰), irrigation durations increase up to 36 min. Therefore,
    the actual longitudinal slope (i.e. slope 6.1‰) seems to provide a good balance
    between application efficiency and cut-off time. Fig. 9 Influence of the longitudinal
    slope on application efficiency, irrigation duration and profile of infiltration
    depth in the Field B Full size image Discussion Effect of flexible irrigation
    scheduling on water conservation The differences in the number of irrigation interventions
    and seasonal irrigation volumes between rigid and flexible irrigation management
    on Field A, B and at the irrigation district scale are summarized in Table 7.
    The results show that the application of a flexible irrigation management, following
    the real crop water needs, can significantly reduce the number of irrigation interventions
    and irrigation volumes, especially when significant rainfall occurs during the
    agricultural season, such as in 2021 on Field A and B and in 2022 on field B only.
    These results are in good agreement with the findings of Therani et al. (2023),
    Grant et al. (2009), and Gu et al. (2020), which show how, for different crops
    and soils, effective irrigation scheduling can help increase water conservation
    and profits while minimizing over-irrigation, percolation, and potential negative
    environmental impacts. However, the observations in our case study clearly show
    that farmers tend to avoid irrigation when they consider the amount of rainfall
    to be adequate to meet crop water needs, even under a rigid irrigation schedule.
    This is evident in the graph of SWB of Field B in the year 2022 (Fig. 6), where
    a well-distributed series of rainfall events with a depth greater than the critical
    soil water deficit (about 20 mm, which is on average the difference between TAW
    and CMC in the full development stage of the crop) occurred from about 20 days
    after sowing until harvest. In this case, the farmer decided to avoid some irrigation
    interventions with a significant reduction in water consumption compared to the
    previous year. In addition, the delay in the sowing date (20 days with later than
    in 2021), played favourably for the rainfall satisfaction of the water needs of
    the crop (i.e. allowing to take advantage of the autumn rainfalls that are typical
    of the mid-latitude where the study area is located). Table 7 Differences between
    rigid and flexible/on-demand irrigation management reported in terms of number
    of irrigation interventions and seasonal irrigation volumes Full size table Examining
    the differences in irrigation volumes shown in Table 7, between 10 and 60% of
    water conservation could be obtained if a transition to flexible irrigation scheduling
    is implemented. These values are very interesting when compared with the reduction
    of freshwater deliveries imposed by the irrigation districts agencies of the Padana
    plain area in the 2022 dry season. In some parts of the plain, the restriction
    of water deliveries reached up to 70%, while in the area where the study domain
    is located, the restrictions were around 10%. This confirms the assumption that
    by working on the scheduling of surface irrigation interventions it is possible
    to achieve the objectives of savings that could be required during dry seasons.
    An additional multi-year scenario was run to confirm the water saving results
    obtained in the experimental plots and presented in Table 7. 30 years of data
    (from 1992 to 2022) registered by an official agro-meterological station 5 km
    away from the study area (managed by the Lombardy Environmental Protection Agency)
    were used in the AquaCrop model (properly calibrated) to simulate the irrigation
    scheduling of Field A (but very similar results were also obtained for Field B
    and therefore they are not reported) under a rigid and flexible water supply.
    Specifically, in the ‘rigid rotation’ scenario, watering was performed every 7
    days after the sowing dates, the latter assumed equal for each year and in both
    scenarios, as confirmed by the experimental evidence. On the contrary, in the
    “on demand” scenario, irrigation was only applied when the soil deficit was between
    75 and 85% of the TAW (as observed in both experimental fields). The irrigation
    depth for each irrigation event in both scenarios was randomly varied between
    150 and 200 mm (as duly observed in the experimental fields). Figure 10 shows
    the daily cumulative irrigation depths over the multiple agricultural seasons,
    as well as the total sum of irrigation volumes over 30 years. The daily pattern
    of irrigation events reflects expectations, i.e., in the “rigid rotation” scenario,
    irrigation demand is approximately constant throughout the season as a result
    of a rigid calendar of irrigation interventions, whereas in the “on demand” scenario,
    the irrigation pattern more closely follows the actual crop water demand, which
    is mainly concentrated in the early and mid growing season. Fig. 10 Cumulative
    daily pattern of irrigation depths over 30 agricultural seasons (from 1992 to
    2022) in the Field A. ''Irrigation depth'' represents the cumulative daily irrigation
    depth for that day over 30 years. ''Cumulative irrigation depths'' represents
    the sum of ''irrigation depth'' over 30 years. Full size image If the cumulative
    irrigation volumes of the two scenarios are considered, the implementation of
    a flexible irrigation scheduling allows to conserve about 45% of water in respect
    to the rigid-rotation one. These results are in good agreement with those observed
    in the two experimental years (2021 and 2022) and presented in Table 7. Logically,
    in this simulation, the 45% should be considered as the upper limit of water conservation,
    since the rigid-rotation scenario does not take into account some dynamics that
    the farmer implements for deciding whether or not to irrigate (e.g., the possible
    presence of rainfall in the days close to the irrigation event scheduled in the
    calendar, or the presence of favourable antecedent soil moisture condition before
    the irrigation intervention). Although the results strongly confirm that the transition
    to flexible irrigation scheduling can provide significant benefits in terms of
    water conservation and crop quality, the implementation of flexible irrigation
    scheduling could have a significant impact on water distribution planning at the
    irrigation district level. Assuming that changes to the water distribution infrastructure
    network should be minimized to limit costs, the transition will require irrigation
    district agencies to adopt computerized software and algorithms to manage concurrent
    demands, especially in monoculture irrigation districts. The use of telemetry,
    remotely controlled (and coordinated) systems of gates within the canal network
    could facilitate coordination operations and reduce the inertia of moving water
    masses from one point to another in the irrigation network. At the field level,
    different planting dates between fields should be encouraged to differentiate
    irrigation needs in the early stages of crop growth. In addition, the use of early
    or late developing maize varieties should be promoted to take advantage of the
    spring and fall rains typical of the mid-latitudes. Effect of irrigation duration
    on water conservation The potential water conservation expected from optimizing
    irrigation duration are shown in Fig. 11a, b for each strip and irrigation event
    of the years 2021 and 2022. In addition, Fig. 11c, d shows the percentage of water
    conservation of all irrigation interventions averaged over each strip. Positive
    percentages represent a margin of reduction in water consumption, while negative
    percentages indicate insufficient irrigation duration and therefore under-irrigation
    by the farmer. Fig. 11 Potential water conservation calculated for each strip
    and irrigation intervention that occurred in Field A during the 2021 and 2022
    agricultural seasons Full size image The results of the WinSRFR simulations show
    that, on average, an additional 7% of water conservation could be expected if
    the irrigation duration is correctly applied on each strip of Field A. However,
    this percentage, although reasonable, could be affected by a series of hardly
    quantifiable uncertainties related to the structure of the WinSRFR hydrodynamic
    model used to simulate the waterfront advance during each irrigation intervention.
    In particular, the model is one-dimensional and does not take into account the
    2D microtopography, which has a relevant influence on the accuracy with which
    both water advance times and water depths on the field can be reproduced (Costabile
    et al. 2022). Moreover, specific variations in soil hydraulic properties within
    the sector, not detected in the three soil sampling points, could affect local
    infiltration processes and thus the duration of each irrigation intervention.
    In addition, the real inflow rate is distributed across the entire strip width
    by the model, while in the case study the inflow is applied through a narrow gate
    at the head of the strip, approximately in the middle of the strip width. Finally,
    the model calibration was performed considering measurements of waterfront advance
    and recession in a single strip and during a single irrigation intervention, while
    it can be expected that hydrological properties may vary slightly during the agricultural
    season (Mazarei et al. 2021) and between strips. The analysis of the potential
    water conservation between irrigation interventions shows that in the first irrigation
    interventions (approximately from the first to the fourth event), the water conservation
    are more evident than in the following interventions, which are associated with
    the last part of the agricultural season. This was confirmed by the farmers, since
    at the beginning of each irrigation season they use the first irrigation interventions
    to roughly calibrate the irrigation duration in each strip, which would then be
    kept approximately constant during the irrigation season. The results show that
    within the field, the first three strips are generally over-irrigated, while the
    last two are under-irrigated. The third strip is the most over-irrigated in both
    years, with a potential water saving of about 25%, while the fifth strip was largely
    under-irrigated in 2022, probably due to the inability of the model to simulate
    potential water exchange between the ridges (especially lower towards the end
    of the strips) and thus the potential backflow from the adjacent over-irrigated
    strips. Nevertheless, in general, the water supply between the strips seems to
    be quite balanced, showing that on average the farmer has good control over the
    irrigation of the fields during each intervention. Effect of border layout on
    water conservation The potential water consumption expected by changing the strip
    width of field B is shown in Fig. 12. Eighteen different values of strip width
    between 6 and 40 m were tested and for each of them the WinSRFR model was applied
    to find the optimal irrigation duration (i.e. the irrigation duration that allows
    to obtain AD = 1). The flow rate (assumed constant in time and equal to that monitored
    during the irrigation intervention of July 27, 2021) was multiplied by the optimal
    irrigation duration to obtain the irrigation volume of the single strip. Then,
    the volume of the single strip was multiplied by the new potential number of strips
    (obtained by dividing the field width—about 120 m—by the new strip width) to determine
    the total irrigation volume of the field. Fig. 12 Evolution of the total irrigation
    volume of field B by varying the strip width while optimizing the cut-off time
    (i.e. AD = 1) Full size image Considering the current strip width (about 30 m),
    the total irrigation volume was 2600 m3, while a reduction of about 25% (i.e.
    about 1900 m3) was obtained with a strip width of 17 m. These results reflect
    the nature of the speed with which the waterfront propagates along the strip in
    the current situation and in the modified one. Calculating the mean flow velocity
    as the ratio between the field length and the time elapsed from the start of irrigation
    to the instant when the waterfront reaches the end of the strip (equal to the
    irrigation duration), resulted in approximately 4 m min−1 with a strip width of
    30 m, while it increased to 9 m min−1 with a strip width of 17 m. Reducing the
    strip widths of field B to 17 m, the flow rate per unit field width during the
    irrigation interventions becomes very close to that found in field A (about 20
    l s−1 m−1) and the irrigation depth is also similar (about 150 mm). Conclusion
    In this study, an experimental campaign was designed and implemented in the agricultural
    seasons 2021 and 2022 to understand what margin water conservation that could
    be achieved by transitioning from a rigid to a flexible irrigation schedule and
    by customizing the application management variables and the field layouts. The
    results obtained on two maize fields in northern Italy show that there is a relevant
    potential to improve the irrigation performance of traditional border irrigation
    maintaining the same crop yield and possibly increasing its quality. Using AquaCrop
    model for supporting irrigation scheduling and WinSRFR for reproducing border
    irrigation operations, our analysis confirms the evidence that border irrigation
    performance is strongly related both to the water management strategy adopted
    by farmers during irrigation events and to the field layout. Despite that the
    models were subject of some simplifications, significant percentages of water
    conservation were found in both wet and dry years when irrigations were triggered
    when the soil water content was properly depleted, while a well-designed field
    layout (border width and slope) with respect to the available flow rate could
    significantly increase application efficiency and distribution uniformity. The
    duration of irrigation applications can also be optimized as a function of border
    size and available flowrate. We believe that these results provide useful insights
    to help implement new water management strategies aimed at improving the efficiency
    of border irrigation. In addition, the results show that the water conservation
    achieved through the management of irrigation strategies could match the reductions
    in water deliveries potentially imposed by irrigation agencies in dry seasons
    (such as those that occurred in 2022). This confirms the priority of the actions
    that should be implemented in the programs of modernization of the irrigation
    systems, i.e. put first the improvement of the irrigation management strategies
    and then the modification of the irrigation methods and infrastructures. In conclusion,
    this study can help farmers in adapting to changes in water availability as a
    result of policy decisions and/or changing climate patterns. A key challenge will
    be to translate these findings into operational guidelines and best practices
    that will allow the tradition of border irrigation to be maintained, while increasing
    its efficiency. Data availability The data reported in this paper are available

  description: Precision irrigation is becoming more and more important in agricultural
    crop production due to the limited water resources resulting from the negative
    effects of climate change. Modeling of irrigation can support decision makers
    in the maintenance of the quantitative and qualitative parameters of the cultivated
    crops, while improving the efficiency of water consumption. In the present paper,
    a 3D hydrodynamic model was created in the HYDRUS environment to support the modeling
    of the temporal changes and spatial variations in the water balance (WB) of a
    maize cultivated Hungarian study site, thereby providing inputs for irrigation
    scheduling and variable rate irrigation for stakeholders. Beside soil physical
    parameters, crop evapotranspiration (ETc) values were also considered as model
    inputs for the phenological crop development stages of the maize from the sowing
    to the harvesting. This period was between the 3rd of May and the 10th of September
    in 2020 and the 20th of May and 14th of September for the year 2021. The performance
    of the model for soil moisture conditions were validated by on-field soil moisture
    measurements. The overall performance (full vegetation period) of the model was
    good (r2 = 0.88 for 2020 and r2 = 0.91 for 2021), but slightly varied among different
    phenological stages. Based on the model, the water balance of the investigated
    area was determined without any irrigation, alongside the cumulative water fluxes
    (CWF) through the boundaries including the root water uptake (RWU) of the maize
    as well. The results revealed that the incoming precipitation was not sufficient
    to supplement the water content in the soil to the optimal soil moisture range,
    except when the precipitation level is high enough to balance it. It was concluded
    that the water balance was negative for the investigated time periods without
    any irrigation. The specific water deficit (WD) values were calculated considering
    the area of the study site, which is 1439 m3/ha for 2020 and 2068 m3/ha for 2021.
    From the obtained results, optimal irrigation schedules were presented to keep
    the soil moisture content in the optimal range (20.92–14.41 V/V%) in the modeled
    area for two different vegetation periods. It was found that due to the irrigation
    the crop water productivity (CWP) increased by 6% and 4% in 2020 and 2021. Overall,
    the model is able to cope with changing circumstances that could help to mitigate
    the negative effects of climate change with the reasonable use of limited water
    resources in the future.

    ModelingWater balanceMaizeIrrigation schedulingRoot water uptake 1. Introduction
    Nowadays, climate change is one of the biggest challenges that humanity is facing
    in the agricultural sector (Dorward and Giller, 2022, Faye and Braun, 2022). Climate
    change has a significant effect on the available water resources (Aliyari et al.,
    2021, Marques et al., 2022). Moreover, water belongs to the finite natural resources,
    so preserving its quantity and quality is of paramount importance, in which water
    management plays a key role. In order to reduce the negative effects of climate
    change, adaptation to the changing circumstances is inevitable (Zizinga et al.,
    2022). In parallel, scientists forecast that the probability of La Niña condition
    is 77% in 2023, projecting an extreme drought and intense convective precipitation
    – which may as well increase the risks of agricultural damages by hailstorms –
    in the northern hemisphere (Rojas et al., 2019, NOAA-ENSO, 2022). Furthermore,
    the world is facing serious food security problems due to the ongoing global political
    and economic processes. Cereal prices show a significant increase on global stock
    exchanges according to the FAO Cereal Price Index (FAO, 2022) and reached a record
    value in March 2022 since 1990, while tensions between the two key food exporters
    of Eastern Europe are escalating, leading to a potential socio-economic crisis
    in the Middle East and Central Africa. According to Somlyódy, 2000, Várallyay,
    2002, in the future decades, water will be the determining factor of food security
    and environmental safety in the Carpathian Basin as well. The extremities in the
    amount and distribution of precipitation are showing an increasing tendency in
    Hungary (Várallyay, 2005), which often causes problems in crop production. As
    a result, the stress of climatic conditions on agriculture further intensifies,
    and the optimal usage of limited water resources are becoming more and more important
    in food security (Mwambo et al., 2020). According to the above-mentioned, the
    proper planning of precision irrigation scheduling can be a promising solution,
    making irrigation an essential component of agricultural crop production, which
    also contributes to the maintenance of the quantitative and qualitative parameters
    of the cultivated crops, while improving the efficiency of water consumption.
    Modern data collection technologies such as digital sensors, wireless data communication,
    etc. contribute to the continuous environmental monitoring on plant health and
    water availability in the crop root zone (Haghverdi et al., 2015, Helman et al.,
    2019). The high precision real-time kinematic global positioning system (RTK GPS)
    can provide a cm-scale navigation on the fields (Murley et al., 2018). The changes
    on plant health can be detected by high-resolution multispectral satellite images
    at a plot level (Zhu et al., 2022). In conventional irrigation management, the
    soil textural variability can decrease the effectiveness of irrigation with respect
    to its uniformity, scheduling and water use efficiency, therefore accurate irrigation
    scheduling is required to meet the depth of application to the crop water requirement
    (Vories et al., 2021). Proper irrigation scheduling requires actual crop water
    use data in relation to the potential water use (evapotranspiration) as a function
    of plant development (Ayars et al., 2003). Furthermore, variable rate irrigation
    can address soil variability; however, users need guidance to prepare prescriptions
    for optimal water and energy application (Sharma and Irmak, 2020, Kayad et al.,
    2021, Vories et al., 2021). Decision support models for irrigation are typically
    computer simulations over a crop season, based on complex modeling of hydrometeorological
    conditions, vegetation development and thermal stress on vegetation as well as
    the saturated and unsaturated subsurface (Car, 2018, Gallardo et al., 2020). Near-real-time
    computer-aided mathematical models can provide useful information for farmers
    and decision-makers about the optimal amount of irrigation water (Pacco, 2022),
    fertilizer (Gallardo et al., 2020), and pesticide consumption to maximize crop
    yields (Kayad et al., 2021) and food security (Rahmani et al., 2023). However,
    these models need to be calibrated to the environmental conditions of the specific
    field with the consideration of computation power and data availability. Running
    irrigation models requires the knowledge of appropriate initial and boundary conditions,
    such as soil moisture content at different depths, groundwater table, and canopy
    characteristics. Lv et al. (2014) calibrated HYDRUS-1D using soil moisture measurements
    from a network of time-domain transmissometry (TDT) probes and then compared both
    measured and modeled water content values against cosmic-ray neutron probe estimates.
    These models can be used to evaluate numerous irrigation schemes (Dabach et al.,
    2013), root water uptake (Turkeltaub et al., 2014), groundwater recharge (Neto
    et al., 2016), and agricultural contaminant transport (Engelhardt et al., 2015).
    Gärdenäs et al. (2005) used HYDRUS (2D/3D) to evaluate water and nitrogen leaching
    scenarios for three different micro-irrigation systems (surface and subsurface
    drip and sprinkler irrigation) and five different fertigation strategies. Siyal
    et al. (2012) and Šimůnek et al. (2016a) evaluated the effect of alternative fertigation
    strategies and furrow surface treatments on plants water and nitrogen use. Dash
    et al. (2015) and Li et al. (2015) assessed water flow processes and the nitrogen
    balance of rice paddy fields. Others evaluated the effects of various irrigation
    practices on soil salinization and sodification (Corwin et al., 2007, Hanson et
    al., 2008, Ramos et al., 2011). Recent irrigation support models aim to determine
    the amount of water to be applied and the dynamics of irrigation within agricultural
    plots. However, to do this, the scale of the more coarse resolution models have
    to be upscaled properly. Regional models representing atmospheric processes and
    subsurface flow regimes can be built up from millions of modeling units, or hundreds
    of layers depending on the model, not to mention the models of the vegetation.
    Modelling of agroecosystems can notably contribute to higher yield and more sustainable
    water management even at the regional scale or basin level. Liu and Song (2020)
    reported that water wastage could be reduced while water use efficiency could
    be improved by performing on-demand irrigation in crops such as oilseed rape,
    wheat, barley at the Heihe River Basin of China. Farm-level irrigation scheduling
    can benefit from such solutions considering some key parameters such as meteorological,
    soil, and plant conditions. Hence, their monitoring is crucial in the method where
    farmers and precision irrigation specialists can cooperate to have a better management
    of water resources while supporting the crop needs. This is a smart alternative
    compared to the traditional irrigation solutions when farmers irrigate based on
    the experiences of the past years on their croplands. Kersebaumand and Wallor
    (2023) help to comprehend how soil–plant-atmosphere system modelling can contribute
    to understanding the plant needs and what the field provides for them and what
    interventions are needed. Moreover, the need for numeric modelling in agro-ecosystem
    activities of which soil–water simulation modelling solutions are a specific part
    (Heinen, 2023). Today’s state-of-the-art complex models are running 3D simulations,
    typically using results from other, external, complex models (groundwater flow,
    hydrometeorological conditions) at regional or catchment scales. In 2008, Šimůnek
    et al. (2008) reviewed the early history of the HYDRUS and STANMOD software packages
    and related programs and modeling tools such as RETC, ROSETTA, UNSODA, UNSATCHEM,
    and HP1. Šimůnek et al. (2016b) reviewed various specialized add-on modules (e.g.
    C-Ride, DualPerm, Fumigant, and UnsatChem) developed for HYDRUS (2D/3D). In summary,
    the following unresolved scientific questions should be further explored to improve
    the accuracy and applicability of irrigation scheduling models under changing
    circumstances: • Crop water requirements: Determining the precise crop water requirements
    is critical for effective irrigation scheduling. There are several factors influencing
    the crop water demand, such as evapotranspiration rates, crop coefficients, and
    phenological stages (Parmar et al., 2023). Their accurate determination is essential.
    • Soil-water dynamics: Understanding soil–water interactions is crucial in irrigation
    schedule modeling. Factors like soil type, moisture retention characteristics,
    infiltration rates, and root water uptake patterns have a significant influence
    on irrigation decisions (Deng et al., 2021). • Crop response to deficit irrigation:
    Deficit irrigation aims to optimize the water use with minimized yield loss. However,
    further researches should be carried out for a better understanding of different
    crops response to deficit irrigation considering the growth stages as well (Gloriose
    et al, 2022). • Integration of crop and hydrological models: Combining these models
    can provide a more comprehensive understanding of irrigation scheduling (Paul
    et al., 2021). Developing robust frameworks for such integration as well as their
    validation under changing conditions is challenging. • Incorporating real-time
    data: Real-time data, such as weather forecasts, soil moisture sensors, and remote
    sensing information, can greatly improve irrigation scheduling models. The effective
    integration of these data sources into the models to obtain real-time information
    for irrigation decision-making is a key factor (Nakabuye et al., 2022). The main
    goal of the current study was to develop a validated 3D hydrodynamic model for
    the soil water content (SWC) prediction for a continental climate, based on the
    example of a Hungarian study site. The 3D hydrodynamic model aims to support the
    modeling of the temporal changes and spatial variations in the water balance (WB)
    of a maize field, providing inputs for irrigation scheduling and variable rate
    irrigation for stakeholders, thereby helping to mitigate the negative effects
    of climate change with the reasonable use of limited water resources. 2. Materials
    and methods 2.1. Description of the study site The study area is located in the
    Pannonian region (latitude: 47°48′18.60″N, longitude: 22°9′43.89″E, altitude:
    144 m), on the edge of a moderately warm and moderately cool climate belt (continental)
    in the Northern Great Plain (Fig. 1). The study site is situated at an alluvial
    cone plain and covered mainly with sand. It is an irrigated arable land of 87.5
    ha equipped with a linear irrigation system. Nowadays, its active water network
    is sparse and the horizontal fragmentation of the landscape is low, due to melioration
    and drainage activities performed in the previous century. The study site declared
    to be a nitrate vulnerable area (European Commission, 2010). Download : Download
    high-res image (119KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Location of
    the study site. In the last decade, the value of annual sunshine hours is between
    1900 and 2000 (800 h for the summer season, 170 h for the winter season) (Hungarian
    National Weather Service, 2022). The average annual temperature is between 9.6℃
    and 12.6℃. The daily maximum temperature can exceed 34℃ in the summer season,
    while the minimum temperature of the winter usually drops below −17.0°C. The annual
    rainfall is 570–600 mm, of which approx. 350–360 mm comes in the summer season.
    The most common wind directions are the northeast and southeast, with an average
    speed of 2.5 m/s. In summary, the climate is suitable for agricultural crop production.
    Regionally the most important crops are wheat and maize. At this particular site,
    maize is the main crop and used as a forage for cattle. KWS Kleopatras type of
    maize was sown on the 3rd of May 2020 with a grain density of 72,000 grains/hectare
    and a 76.2 cm row spacing while on the 20th May 2021 with a grain density of 76,000
    grains/hectare with the same row spacing, both resulting approx. 20–21 cm of plant
    spacing. The average yield was 40.67 tonnes/hectare and 34.14 tonnes/hectare in
    the irrigated fields, respectively. 2.2. Sampling A precision grid-based soil
    sampling has been carried out on the study area, to which different databases
    and maps (for example ESDAC (2021), digital aerial photo archive, geological map
    by the Mining and Geological Survey of Hungary (2021) were used to elaborate the
    soil sampling strategy (Fig. 2). Download : Download high-res image (261KB) Download

    soil samples were taken at 82 points in two different layers (0–30 cm and 30–60
    cm), representing 1.07 samples/hectare on average. The texture of the soil samples
    was determined by a standard sieving test method, where the median particle size
    is 160 µm (Fig. 3). There is no significant difference on the particle size distribution

    layer (0–30 cm) is between 4.01 and 25.86 V/V% with an average of 11.36 ± 4.23
    V/V%. In the deeper layer (30–60 cm), the values are in the range of 2.42–25.94
    V/V% with an average of 11.13 ± 4.63 V/V%. The average field capacity for 0–30
    cm and 30–60 cm depth is 21.3 V/V% and 20.53 V/V%, respectively. Fig. 4 shows

    The HYDRUS 2D/3D is a finite element model for simulating the spatio-temporal
    movement of water, heat and multiple solutes in variably saturated media (Šimůnek
    et al., 2008, Šimůnek et al., 2016b) by solving the Richards equation (Baoqing
    and Junye, 2017). (1) where, θ is the water content [-], t the time [s], h the
    pressure head [m], Kij(h) the anisotropic hydrological conductivity tensor [m-s−1],
    xi the Cartesian coordinate [m], S the source and sink term due to the water uptake
    of plant, rainfall or geochemical reaction [s−1]. The flow equation incorporates
    a sink term to account for the water uptake by plant roots. The heat transport
    equation considers movement by conduction, as well as convection with flowing
    water. The HYDRUS software and its related packages, add-on modules are widely
    used for irrigation scheduling purposes (Karandish and Šimůnek, 2017, Karandish
    and Šimůnek, 2018), alongside other similar modeling software, like SALTMED (Alkhasha
    and Al-Omran, 2019) and STANMOD (Šimůnek et al., 2008). 2.4. Setup and parametrization
    of the model 2.4.1. Description of the model The HYDRUS-3D model has a modular
    design including a pre-processing section for configuring the base parameters,
    a calculation section for carrying out iterative modeling of soil water transport,
    and a post-processing section providing run results and process information (Yu
    et al., 2022) (Fig. 5). The presented model considers a source term of water like
    precipitation (P) or irrigation (I) for the top (atmospheric) boundary of the
    domain, as well as a deep drainage boundary at the bottom. The length (x) and
    the width (y) of the transport domain are 2,200 m and 415 m, respectively, covering
    an area of 875,793 m2. The depth (z) of the transport domain is 60 cm. Download

    Overview of the HYDRUS-3D model soil moisture and boundary fluxes simulation process.
    In hydraulic parameters, hydraulic conductivity (k), water retention (Ψm), bulk
    density (ρB), particle density (ρp), particle size distribution (PSD) and porosity
    (θP) are used as model inputs (Table 1). As a first step of post-processing, a
    validation procedure has been carried out on the simulated soil water content,
    using the data collected from 30 cm depth of a reference soil moisture probe.
    The model simulates the input and output water fluxes through the boundaries as
    well as root water uptake. From these fluxes, cumulative values were calculated.
    Moreover, the water deficit (WD) values can be determined easily for the studied
    time periods which are between the 3rd of May and the 10th of September for the
    year 2020 and between the 20th and 14th September for 2021 (from sowing to harvesting)
    in the modeled area. By knowing the validated soil water content variation in
    the maize root zone as well as the water deficit, an optimal irrigation scheduling
    was presented for the modeled area to keep the soil moisture content in the optimal
    range providing the water demand for crop growth. Table 1. The average results

    Firstly, the 3D general geometry was selected, and then water flow and root water
    uptake as main processes had been activated. The solute transport module had not
    been activated yet (in the current model scenario, the solute concentration is
    considered to be 0), however it can be activated afterwards and the solute transport
    of plant conditioners sprinkled with irrigation water could also be investigated.
    The modeling time period was 131 and 116 days for the two studied years, elapsed
    from the sowing to the harvesting of maize, thus the number of time-variable boundary
    records are 131 and 116, accordingly. Among several approaches, the van Genuchten-Mualem
    soil-hydraulic model was selected (with no hysterisesis) to represent the shapes
    of the water retention curves (van Genuchten, 1908). (2) where, θ(ψ) is water
    retention curve [L3·L−3], |ψ| is suction pressure [L], θs is saturated water content
    [L3·L−3], θr is residual water content [L3·L−3], α is related to the inverse of
    the air entry suction, α > 0 ([L−1] or [cm−1]), and n is a measure of the pore-size
    distribution, n > 1 [-]. According to the above parametrization, a prediction
    model for the shape of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity – saturation – pressure
    relationship can be developed. Based on Assefa and Woodbury (2013), Rosetta Lite
    v1.1. in-built module of the HYDRUS software was used to provide reliable groundwater
    recharge estimations in the unsaturated zone. The required soil physical parameters
    were predicted based on the average values of the major soil physical properties
    measured in the depth of 0–30 and 30–60 cm layers, such as particle size distribution,
    hydraulic conductivity and bulk density. The input data for the prediction is
    indicated in Table 1. A database of various crop types is included in the HYDRUS
    software for the simulation of root water uptake. From this predefined database,
    the corn (Wesseling, 1991, Assouline, 2002) was selected. Table 2 indicates the
    values of parameters used to calculate the root water uptake (RWU). Table 2. The
    values of parameters used for the prediction of RWU in the HYDRUS software (Yu

    initial water content was set up based on the measurement data of the soil moisture
    probe (see below 2.4.6. chapter). On the top of the transport domain, an atmospheric
    boundary condition was applied, whereas on the bottom of the domain, a deep drainage
    condition was used, corresponding to the groundwater level at 140 cm. Groundwater
    level data originated from a groundwater monitoring well, located at a distance
    of 1.9 km from the investigated area. 2.4.4. Calculation of reference crop evapotranspiration
    (ET0) Reference crop evapotranspiration (ET0) values were calculated and set up
    for 2020 and 2021 based on the measurements of a hydro-meteorological station
    located at the test site. The FAO-endorsed Penman-Monteith parameterization was
    used for estimating reference crop evapotranspiration, which calculates reference
    crop evapotranspiration (Allen et al., 1998). The albedo used was 0.23, whilst
    the aerodynamic resistance was 70 s m−1. (3) where, ET0 is reference evapotranspiration
    [mm∙day−1], Rn is net radiation at the crop surface [MJ∙m−2∙day−1], G is soil
    heat flux density [MJ∙m−2∙day−1], T is air temperature at 2 m height [°C], u2
    is wind speed at 2 m height [m∙s−1], es is saturation vapour pressure [kPa], ea
    is actual vapour pressure [kPa], es-ea is saturation vapour pressure deficit [kPa],
    Δ is slope vapour pressure curve [kPa∙°C−1], and g is psychrometric constant [kPa∙°C−1].
    2.4.5. Calculation of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) The crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc) was calculated based on the daily values of ET0 and Kc (crop coefficient).
    The basis of Kc values for the different phenological stages were set in accordance
    with FAO56 paper (Allen et al., 1998). The length of the phenological stages for
    the investigated years, were determined based on the local conditions of in-situ
    phenological observations of the Biologische Bundesanstalt, Bundessortenamt und
    Chemische Industrie (BBCH) (Meier, 2001) and satellite-based aerial average of
    leaf area index (LAI) data provided by Vultus Ltd. (2022). Kc values were set
    proportional to LAI; whereas maximum LAI is referred to the maximum Kc, and LAI
    at the initial phase was set to the initial value of Kc. Then the Kc was calculated
    proportionally with LAI measured at different times (Table 3). Table 3. Kc ranges
    according to the phenological crop development stages for the years 2020 and 2021.

    22rd of August 2021 – 14th of September 2021 0.9–0.6 It is challenging to generalize
    the rates of evaporation from soil surfaces due to variations in soil texture
    and probable soil water movement. The evaporation from saturated soils may be
    anticipated to reflect that from an open, free-water surface. The rate of evaporation
    will significantly decrease as the water table descends below the soil’s surface.
    At water contents below field capacity, prolonged evaporation from the soil surface
    is typically negligible because soil water movement is extremely slow when the
    soil surface is relatively dry (Huffman et al., 2013). Daily ETc data were used
    as an input parameter in HYDRUS since there were no separate data for evaporation
    and transpiration. On the other hand Wei et al. (2014) measured the ratio E and
    ETc separately for phenological stages of maize in case of similar growing (soil
    and climatic) conditions, therefore transpiration and evaporation were separated
    in accordance of their study in HYDRUS. 2.4.6. Validation of the 3D hydrodynamic
    model Climatic parameters for the soil moisture prediction models ware set up
    based on ETc values and measured precipitation data for the studied periods. To
    evaluate the performance of the HYDRUS model, reference soil moisture data was
    used for the validation of simulated soil moisture data at 30 cm depth. A Sentek
    Drill and Drop probe (2022) was set at the maize site and data was collected from
    the depth of 30 cm. The model validation was carried out based on the dataset
    for the entire investigated time period using the accuracy metrics coefficient
    of determination (R2), root means square error (RMSE) and normalized root mean
    square error (NRMSE). RMSE is commonly used to measure the accuracy of the prediction
    models and NRMSE is useful to reflect the relative error between the modeled and
    measured soil moisture (Darvishzadeh et al., 2008). In order to assess overall
    forecasting accuracy, the relative deviations and absolute deviations of the predicted
    values from the observed values were calculated to assess the accuracy of the
    predictions. The mean absolute error (MAE) was used to assess how close the measured
    moisture values were to the modeled values. The mean bias error (MBE) reflects
    the estimation accuracy of soil moisture, whereby the potential and rate of under
    or overestimation of the model can be indicated. (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) where, is
    the modeled soil moisture data, is the observed soil moisture data, is the average
    of the measured soil moisture, and n is the number of data used for validation.
    In order to highlight those periods in which the model performs the best, validation
    calculations were done for the phenological periods as well. Based on the validated
    model, the potential irrigation scheduling was also assessed carried out in an
    iterative process. 3. Results 3.1. Crop evapotranspiration (ETc) Fig. 7 represents

    can be observed around the second half of the crop development stage 70 and 65
    days after sowing, where the ETc values are 6.34 mm/day and 6.41 mm/day, for the
    studied years 2020 and 2021, respectively. 3.2. Performance of 3D hydrodynamic
    model A good correlation (R2 = 0.78–0.96) was found between the predicted and
    measured soil moisture content in 30 cm depth of soil layer over the investigated
    time period (Fig. 8 and Table 4). RMSE, NRMSE, absolute (MAE) and the relative
    deviation (MBE) (difference in percentage) of modeled versus measured moisture
    data were also calculated. The seasonal accuracy of the model was 1.630 V/V% (12.304%)
    in 2020 and 1.090 V/V% (8.734%) in 2021, varying between 0.36 and 2.803 V/V% (2.709%-21.103%)
    among phenological stages based on the RMSE and NRMSE of the prediction models
    in 2020. Based on the mean bias errors (-0.373 V/V%) for 2020 the model slightly
    underestimated the observed moisture values especially in the crop development
    stage (MBE = -1.041). On the other hand model is slightly overestimated (MBE =
    0.332) the soil moisture content in 2021, especially in the initial phenological
    stage. The mean absolute error in moisture was ranging between 0.731 and 0.819
    V/V%, but with the highest error in the crop development stage in 2021. The strongest
    correlations were found in the initial (R2 = 0.91–0.94) and the mid-season (R2
    = 0.96) stages. It can be seen in Fig. 8 and Table 4 that where high gradients
    were measured on the soil water content, the predicted values are underestimated,
    especially in the crop development stage. The results suggest that the model built
    in HYDRUS is suitable for the modeling of water content changes at the case study
    site. On the other hand, in the crop development stage in 2020, extreme intensive
    rainfalls were experienced. The simulation underestimated the soil moisture of
    the soil, which is probably due to the higher infiltration rate of the model compared
    to the reality. The reason for the difference is probably due to the compaction
    of the soil at the reference soil probe (compaction 4.4 MPa), which was characteristic
    for the whole field, but to a different extent. Download : Download high-res image

    and the third hottest June since 1901 (Hungarian National Weather Service, 2022).
    3.3. Water fluxes through the boundaries In Fig. 9, the water fluxes through the
    top and bottom boundaries are given as a function of time elapsed after sowing.
    After heavy precipitation events, elevated deep drainage values can be observed
    for both years in the model with a few days of delay. The water balance is negative
    almost over the entire time period, except when precipitation level is high enough
    to balance it. Based on the hydro-meteorological data of 2020 and 2021 (Hungarian
    National Weather Service, 2022), the highest precipitation events occurred in
    the crop development stages, but evapotranspiration was also higher in these stages
    as a consequence of higher radiation and elevated temperatures. Download : Download

    through the boundaries and the calculated water balance for 2020 and 2021. 3.4.
    Cumulative water fluxes and the water balance Cumulative water fluxes are presented
    in Fig. 10. Infiltration takes on positive values, because the incoming precipitation
    increases the water content in the soil. Deep drainage and evapotranspiration
    have negative values, since they decrease the water content in the soil. By the
    end of the former investigated time period of 2020, the total infiltration (I)
    was 267,000 m3, while evapotranspiration (ET) and deep drainage (DD) totaled to
    321,000 m3 and 72,000 m3, respectively. Water balance can be calculated for the
    given area from the 3rd of May 2020 to the 10th of September 2020 based on the
    exact values of these fluxes. For the latter time period 2021, the total infiltration
    (I) was 155,000 m3, while the evapotranspiration (ET) and the deep drainage (DD)
    totaled to 305,000 m3 and 31,200 m3 (Fig. 10). Notice that ET includes root water
    uptake in the calculations. Download : Download high-res image (927KB) Download

    (atmospheric and deep drainage) for 2020 and 2021. In conclusion, the model results
    reveal a lack of 126,100 m3 of water for the year 2020 and a lack of 181,200 m3
    of water for 2021 in the investigated agricultural land. Considering, that the
    area of the site is 875,793 m2, the specific water deficit (WD) values are calculated
    as 0.143 m3/m2, which is equal to 143.9 mm/m2 or 143.9 l/m2 or 1439 m3/ha in 2020
    and as 0.206 m3/m2, which is equal to 206.8 mm/m2 or 206.8 l/m2 or 2068 m3/ha
    in 2021. 4. Discussion The soil conditions essentially determine the water movements,
    thus its proper representation in the model is crucial. The exploratory analysis
    proved that sand is the predominant fraction, on the other hand, water retention
    curves show higher variability which could have been caused by the mechanical
    and chemical compaction due to the fermentation sludge utilization with an extreme
    high colloid content (Kiss et al., 2020). The current model considers the groundwater
    level as a static depth; meanwhile its annual variability can exceed 50 cm in
    the area (Fehér and Rakonczai, 2019). In order to get a comprehensive view of
    the soil water content distribution of the area, the temporal water content was
    investigated by using the measured data of the soil moisture probe as an initial
    value. Fig. 11 shows the water content in the soil as a function of time. The
    difference between the field capacity (20.92 V/V%) and the wilting point (7.9
    V/V%) represents the available soil moisture range, which is 13.02 V/V%. Based
    on practical experiences, irrigation should be carried out when the available
    moisture range drops to 50%, which corresponds to soil moisture content of 14.41
    V/V%. It can also be seen that the incoming precipitation is not sufficient to
    supplement the water content in the soil to the optimal soil moisture range, thus
    the resultant water balance is expected to be negative for the investigated time
    period without any irrigation. During the summer of 2020, there were two heavy
    precipitation events on the 16th of June 2020 and the 3rd of July 2020, where
    47.8 mm and 62.2 mm of incoming precipitation were recorded, respectively. These
    high amounts of precipitation events were able to increase the soil water content
    to the optimal moisture range however, their effects lasted only for 10 and 8
    days, then the water content decreased below 15 V/V% from the 72nd day. Download

    Water content in the soil as a function of time with and without irrigation in
    the studied time period of 2020. The average field capacity value (20.92 V/V%)
    was aimed for in case of the first irrigation event as initial soil moisture content.
    This study used the FAO56 approach (Allen et al., 1998) to determine ETc. Three
    constant Kc values can be used in the conventional FAO56 technique, one for each
    of the three different fixed duration of crop phenological stages. However due
    to the difference in planting dates and crop growing times as well as differences
    in climate conditions, cropping cycles, and farm management factors, using Kc
    values for defined length periods recommended in Allen et al. (1998) is not optimally
    suited and fit to crops in a specific area. Therefore there are several other
    methods for calculating Kc values such as thermal time, in-situ measured LAI data,
    crop canopy cover or LAI using remote sensing, NDVI or field sensors (Baille et
    al., 1994, Grattan et al., 1998, Li et al., 2019). In our study, Sentinel based
    LAI and on site BBCH data were used for the determination of the lengths of phenological
    stages and to define the dynamic changes in Kc in accordance with several studies
    (Soudani et al., 2021, Zhang et al., 2022). The calculated ET was found to be
    321,000 m3 (366.52 mm) (Fig. 10), which fits with the European calculations for
    the evapotranspiration under maize crop: 373 ± 73 mm conducted in 1992–2012 by
    Gobin et al. (2017) using Aquacrop model. Present results in correspondence with
    other Hungarian results as well, since crop evapotranspiration of maize was between
    267 and 425 mm based on also Aquacrop model (Rakotoarivony et al., 2020). Fiala
    et al. (2014) also found that the evapotranspiration of maize is 300–340 mm in
    the vegetation period in Serbia. To achieve considerably enhanced irrigation and
    nutrient management, numerous quantitative decisions must be taken on a regular
    basis throughout a crop; typically, each demands complicated decision-making.
    Furthermore, as the study site is a nitrate vulnerable area with intensive agricultural
    production, farmers are required to improve N and irrigation management in order
    to reduce regional NO3− leaching loss (Kiss et al., 2020). Numerous elements such
    as climate, soil and crop characteristics, and field infrastructure must all be
    considered for effective irrigation and fertilizer management (Gallardo et al.,
    2020, Rodney et al., 2020). The set model in this present study considers several
    aspects of irrigation modeling as well. Therefore, irrigation was simulated in
    accordance with 50% depletion of total available water content using the developed
    model. Fig. 11 represents the results of an iterative process for the modeled
    period of the year 2020, where the irrigation dates and irrigation water quantities
    were determined in order to keep the moisture content in the optimal soil moisture
    range (20.92–14.41 V/V%) considering 40 mm/m2 of irrigation water in the first
    case, then 20 mm/m2 of irrigation water for maintenance in every other cases (Table
    5). Table 5. Optimal irrigation scheduling based on the results of the model for

    could be replenished into the soil out of the 143.9 mm/m2 of lack of water. The
    same iterative process had been carried out for the year 2021. Fig. 12 shows the
    optimal irrigation scheduling according to the model, considering 25 mm/m2 of
    irrigation water in each cases (Table 6). Download : Download high-res image (692KB)

    According to this scenario, the 206.8 mm/m2 of water shortage could be solved
    by adding 200 mm/m2 of irrigation water into the soil. The simulation model presented
    offers site and crop specific assessment, and the possibility for dynamic adaptations
    to climate fluctuations to achieve considerably enhanced irrigation. To evaluate
    the overall performance of irrigation on the maize yield, crop water productivity
    (CWP) values were calculated for non-irrigated and irrigated fields (Table 7).
    Crop water productivity was defined as the yield obtained per unit of water consumed
    (Akhter et al., 2017). In 2020 and 2021, 1400 m3 ha−1 and 2000 m3 ha−1 of water
    were irrigated in accordance with the results of the model. The non-irrigated
    and irrigated fields are adjacent, and their yield data was reported by the field
    owner. Table 7. Comparison of the crop water productivity of non-irrigated and

    in non-irrigated fields with the yield of 27,370 kg ha−1, and 1,770 m3 ha−1 with
    15,460 kg ha−1 of fresh biomass yield in 2021, respectively. It means that + 46%
    of irrigation water was used in the irrigated fields in addition to the total
    water input of non-irrigated fields in 2020, and + 113% in 2021 due to the severe
    drought. In both studied years, irrigation led to a significant increase in maize
    yields (+49% in 2020 and + 121% in 2021). The crop water productivity values were
    8.64 kg m−3 and 8.73 kg m−3 in non-irrigated fields for the years of 2020 and
    2021. In case of the irrigated fields, CWP values were higher with + 6% and +
    4%. Nevertheless, CWP values can vary in a wide range across the different regions
    in Europe due to variations in climate, soil, and management practices. Local
    conditions and specific farm-level factors also play a significant role in CWP
    values that could be achieved in maize production (Edreira et al., 2018, Letseku
    and Grové, 2022). The presented model is a suitable tool for SWC modeling in a
    continental climate and contributes to an improved irrigation scheduling. The
    adaptation of the model to other soil types or climate conditions requires the
    recalibration of the model. Proper model validation and sensitivity analysis are
    essential for ensuring the reliability and robustness of simulation results. However,
    the lack of comprehensive and detailed experimental data can hinder the thorough
    validation and sensitivity assessment of the model. 5. Conclusion The current
    article presents a modeling workflow in order to support the development of precision
    irrigation in a Hungarian study site where maize is cultivated. The cross-validation
    of the model with field sensor data ensures that the model is suitable for the
    prediction of soil water content during the investigated time periods. The accuracy
    of the moisture simulation model was ranged between 0.36 and 2.803 V/V% (2.709%-21.103%)
    based on the RMSE and NRMSE. The mean bias errors varied between −1.041 – 0,926
    V/V% which did not reflect significant over or underestimations. The mean absolute
    error were found to be between 0.261 and 1.816 V/V%. Modeling also revealed that
    the site suffers from a lack of water in 2020 and 2021, but irrigation can be
    optimally scheduled by using the water balance model. The continuation of the
    current modeling scenario might be the extension of the model into a stochastic
    framework, and the improvement of either the observation network of the soil humidity
    as well as the joint environmental models of evapotranspiration, the hydrodynamics
    and the root water and nutrient uptake. Irrigation and nutrient management are
    increasingly being coupled as fertigation becomes more widespread. In further
    studies fermentation sludge used as a potential nutrient source at the study site
    is planned to be investigated in the fertigation modeling in sprinkler irrigation.
    Moreover, since the model is able to cope with changing circumstances, the near
    term, mid-term and long-term effects of climate change scenarios could be predicted
    for the estimation of future water demand. CRediT authorship contribution statement

  description: Using crop models to develop reasonable irrigation and nitrogen schedules
    (INSs) is critical for achieving high yields and maximizing water use efficiency
    (WUE) and nitrogen use efficiency. However, the INSs developed based on crop parameters
    determined through field experiments have low robustness at the regional scale.
    Remote sensing data indicate the growth conditions of regional crops, and representative
    regional crop parameters can be determined using remote sensing data. The objective
    of the present study was to develop a regional INS by adopting a crop model with
    crop parameters calibrated using the remotely sensed leaf area index (LAI). First,
    the crop parameters of a field-scale crop model were calibrated on the basis of
    field-scale trial data for four summer maize growing seasons. Sensitive crop parameters
    at the regional scale were then identified using an assimilation algorithm based
    on the remotely sensed LAI. The rationality of using the remotely sensed LAI for
    determining regional crop parameters was demonstrated by simulating regional maize
    growth. Finally, a regional-scale crop model was developed and coupled with a
    multiobjective genetic algorithm to optimize the regional INS for different typical-rainfall
    years. The results indicated that the regional-scale crop model was more accurate
    than was the field-scale crop model in simulating the regional LAI, plant height,
    soil water content, and yield and the corresponding RMSE decreased by 0.50 m2/m2,
    0.15 m, 0.02 cm3/cm3, 344.11 kg/ha. Compared with the INSs currently used by farmers,
    the optimized INS was associated with a marginally higher irrigation quantity
    (average increase of 2.66%) but a significantly lower nitrogen application rate
    (average decrease of 31.6%). The crop yield, WUE, and partial factor productivity
    for nitrogen were 6.35–12.51%, 2.64–10.41%, and 61.8–66.2% higher, respectively,
    in different typical-rainfall years when using the optimized INS than when using
    an unoptimized INS. The results of this study indicate that a regional INS established
    on the basis of regional crop model parameters estimated using remote sensing
    data can aid irrigation and nitrogen application scheduling.

    factor productivity of nitrogenMultiobjective optimization 1. Introduction Water
    and nitrogen are crucial factors that affect crop growth and yield. Water scarcity
    has become a global systemic risk (Sun et al., 2016) that challenges the sustainability
    of traditional agricultural practices and is a major factor limiting agricultural
    production (Dadrasan et al., 2015). Although reliable nitrogen supply for plant
    growth has made significant contributions to increasing crop yields over the past
    century (Zhang et al., 2015), the application of nitrogen fertilizers higher than
    the nitrogen requirements of crops can cause nitrogen loss from arable lands to
    the environment (Ronaghi and Ghasemi-Fasaei, 2013). Such over-fertilization not
    only decreases nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and increases environmental problems
    (Nosheen et al., 2021) but also does not significantly increase crop yield (Li
    et al., 2016). Under conditions of limited water supply, nitrogen fertilizers
    are crucial in increasing water use efficiency (WUE) (Waraich et al., 2011). Moreover,
    water and nitrogen must be rationally allocated to improve nitrogen fertilizer
    effectiveness and reduce environmental pollution (Li et al., 2009). Therefore,
    suitable measures for rational irrigation and nitrogen management must be identified.
    The development of crop growth models has enabled researchers to simulate crop
    growth under different irrigation and nitrogen fertilization conditions. A variety
    of models, such as CERES–Maize (Jones and Kiniry, 1986), CERES–Wheat (Ritchie,
    1985a), and AquaCrop (Steduto et al., 2009), have been widely used to simulate
    crop growth with specific regard to crop yield, WUE, and NUE under different irrigation
    and nitrogen application conditions (Amouzou et al., 2018, Malik et al., 2019,
    Steduto et al., 2009). The models used in these researches have performed excellently
    in simulating field-scale water and nitrogen consumption, crop yield, WUE, and
    NUE. Rational water and nitrogen allocation strategies are crucial for regional
    agricultural water and fertilizer management, and the use of crop models for the
    development of irrigation and nitrogen schedules (INSs) has become an active research
    area. Many scholars have used crop models to simulate crop yields under different
    water and nitrogen allocation scenarios to determine appropriate measures for
    irrigation and nitrogen application management; however, optimal solutions cannot
    be obtained using this approach (Linker and Kisekka, 2017, Malik et al., 2019,
    Shen et al., 2020). Optimization algorithms can output optimal solutions for a
    given set of constraints (Deb and Jain, 2013). Several efforts have been made
    to combine crop growth models with optimization algorithms for water and nitrogen
    management (Wu et al., 2007, Brown et al., 2010, Wen et al., 2017). Among them,
    many multiobjective Pareto optimization methods have been developed. Roy et al.
    (2019) used DSSAT model to find the best irrigation schedules for maximizing crop
    yield with the highest plant water use efficiency. Kropp et al. (2019) further
    increased the number of optimization objectives by maximizing yield and minimizing
    irrigation amount, nitrogen application rate, and nitrogen leaching to achieve
    the optimization of INSs. Obtaining reliable crop parameters is crucial when using
    crop models to simulate crop growth and establish an INS. The CERES–Maize model
    distinguishes between different maize varieties according to their cultivar coefficients
    (Jones and Kiniry, 1986), and the accuracy of this model depends on the cultivar
    coefficients of crops (Jin et al., 2016, Wang et al., 2021). Shen et al. (2020)
    used the CERES–Maize model calibrated using field-scale trial data to obtain the
    yield and WUE of summer maize under different sowing dates and INSs. They compared
    the obtained data with each other to determine the optimal sowing date and INS;
    the results of the comparison were then used to guide the management of summer
    maize planting in a large region. However, the direct application of the results
    of a field-scale crop model to the regional scale can lead to a host of errors
    when large spatial differences exist between the cultivars and growth environments
    of crops (Mo et al., 2005). Another problem in using crop models to simulate regional
    crop growth conditions and establish a regional INS is the heterogeneity of regional
    soil, meteorological, and field management conditions. Therefore, the University
    of Florida developed the CCAFS Regional Agricultural Forecasting Toolbox (Shelia
    et al., 2019), which enables the division of spatial heterogeneity in the inputs
    and outputs of the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT)
    and Agricultural Production Systems Simulator models to improve the effectiveness
    of these models at the regional scale. Gyawali et al. (2018) used the aforementioned
    toolbox for seasonal crop yield forecasting in Nepal. In addition, Kim and Kisekka
    (2021) demonstrated how the DSSAT (Jones et al., 2003, Hoogenboom et al., 2010)
    software program can be transformed into a usable Web-based decision support tool
    for real-time simulations conducted using open-source geographic information system
    technology. However, the crop cultivar coefficients in the aforementioned studies
    have been derived from a single crop variety in a single field-scale trial, and
    spatial underrepresentation is likely to be present when such cultivar coefficients
    are applied directly to the regional scale. The development of remote sensing
    technology has enabled the clear spatial representation of some simulation results
    of crop models [e.g., leaf area index (LAI)] (Mandal et al., 2019, Kayad et al.,
    2022); thus, the spatial representation of cultivar coefficients can be improved
    by coupling remote sensing information with crop models. Data assimilation methods
    that combine crop growth models with remote sensing observations have been rapidly
    developed to increase the spatial simulation accuracy of crop models. Curnel et
    al. (2011) argued that assimilating LAI into the WOFOST crop model could improve
    the accuracy of simulating winter wheat yield. Huang et al. (2015) conducted research
    at the regional scale, further confirming this conclusion. Additionally, Jin et
    al. (2016) assimilated remotely sensed LAI into the CERES-Maize model and found
    a significant improvement in the spatiotemporal continuity of LAI for summer maize.
    However, the last two studies have estimated the crop model parameters for each
    pixel from the remotely sensed LAI of each pixel. Factors such as a small quantity
    of remotely sensed LAI data for a single pixel and errors in the remotely sensed
    LAI can cause instability in crop model parameters. In summary, spatial underrepresentation
    is present when crop parameters determined from field-scale trials are used at
    regional scales, and parameter instability occurs when the pixel-by-pixel LAI
    is used to derive pixel-by-pixel crop model parameters at the regional scale.
    Therefore, we developed a framework that involves the use of a crop model with
    crop parameters calibrated using remotely sensed LAI data to establish a regional
    INS. The main objectives of this study were (1) to explore the feasibility of
    estimating the LAI of maize from backward scattering information extracted from
    microwave remote sensing images; (2) to investigate the feasibility of assimilating
    the remotely sensed LAI and crop models to determine regionally representative
    crop parameters and to assess the ability of the crop models to simulate regional-scale
    summer maize growth; (3) to study the use of multiobjective optimization algorithms
    in establishing an INS that simultaneously achieves high WUE, high partial factor
    productivity of nitrogen (PFPN), and high crop yield; and (4) to analyze the rationality
    of the established INS. In addition, we defined the regional-scale CERES–Maize
    model as a crop model that considers the spatial variability in soil and meteorological
    parameters, and the crop parameters used in this model were calibrated using the
    remotely sensed LAI (i.e., data assimilation method). Our field-scale CERES–Maize
    model is a crop model that does not account for the spatial variability in soil
    and meteorological parameters; the crop parameters used in this model were calibrated
    using field-scale experimental data. 2. Materials and methods This study consisted
    of two parts. The first part involved determining the crop parameters of the regional-scale
    CERES–Maize model by using data assimilation methods. We estimated the LAI of
    summer maize in the study area in different growth stages by using the field-scale
    measured LAI and microwave remote sensing data obtained from the Sentinel-1 satellite.
    Subsequently, the SCE-UA algorithm was used for iteratively updating the sensitive
    crop parameters of the regional-scale CERES–Maize model until the gap between
    the LAI simulated by the crop model and the remotely sensed LAI was minimized.
    The second part of this study involved combining NSGA-III and the regional-scale
    CERES–Maize model for the multiobjective optimization of the INS for summer maize
    in three typical-rainfall years (dry, normal, and wet years). Finally, the optimal
    INS was determined according to the Pareto solution set. The overall research

    plain (34.42–35.72°N and 109.26–111.48°E; Fig. 2) and includes 16 irrigation districts.
    The climate of this area is semiarid; its average annual precipitation is 550 mm;
    its average annual air temperature is 14.4 °C; and its altitude is 350–800 m.
    The land in the study area is mostly used for agriculture, with wheat and maize
    being planted in rotation in the winter and summer seasons, respectively. The
    sowing and harvesting dates of summer maize are early June and early October,
    respectively. Download : Download high-res image (268KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Study area and sampling point distribution. Obtaining information
    on the summer maize varieties selected by each farmer in a large region is very
    difficult. A survey we conducted revealed that farmers within a certain geographical
    area tend to select similar maize varieties. Therefore, the study area can be
    divided into several subregions according to the growth characteristics and growth
    environment of maize, and farmers in the same subregion can be assumed to adopt
    the same maize varieties (Guo et al., 2018). Because the X-means algorithm can
    estimate the number of clusters (Pelleg and Moore, 2000), we used this algorithm
    to divide the study area into three subregions, namely MZ1, MZ2, and MZ3, according
    to the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of summer maize as well as
    the clay and silt contents of the soil (Fig. 2). Soil data were obtained from
    the National Earth System Science Data Center (http://www.geodata.cn). The process
    for determining the NDVI of summer maize is described in Section 2.2.2. The black
    dots in Fig. 2 represent regional sampling areas, and the yellow dots represent
    field-scale experiment stations. 2.2. Data collection 2.2.1. Field data We selected
    the DSSAT–CERES–Maize model to simulate maize growth. To achieve satisfactory
    simulation accuracy at the field scale, we conducted field experiments in the
    summer maize growing seasons of 2016, 2017, 2020, and 2021. The field experiments
    performed in 2016 and 2017 were conducted at Wugong station (Fig. 2). In these
    experiments, the common cultivar Zhengdan 958 in the study area was planted, and
    the planting density was 60,000 plants per hectare. The aforementioned experiments
    were replicated thrice, had a two-factor design (three nitrogen application rates
    and three levels of irrigation), and were conducted in a split–split plot arranged
    in randomized blocks. The experiments performed in 2020 and 2021 were conducted
    at Yangling Station (Fig. 2) with the Zhengdan 958 cultivar. These experiments
    were replicated thrice, had a two-factor design (four nitrogen application rates
    and three planting density levels), and were conducted in split–split plot arranged
    in randomized blocks. In all the experiments, the plot area was 24 m2. Weeds were
    eradicated, and insecticide was sprayed in accordance with local agricultural
    practices. Data from the 2016 and 2020 trials [LAI, soil water content (SWC),
    and yield] were used to calibrate the field-scale CERES–Maize model, and data
    from the 2017 and 2021 trials were used to validate this model. We measured the
    LAI seven times during each growing season by using a gauge with a precision of
    1 mm. The length (from the collar to the tip) and width (widest point of the leaf)
    of all leaves of the selected plants were measured. The areas of individual leaves
    and LAI were calculated using (1), (2), respectively. (1) (2) where ASA is the
    area of a single leaf (m2); L and W are the length and width of the leaf in meters,
    respectively; 0.75 is a coefficient; TA is the area of all leaves of a single
    maize plant in square meters; and PD is the planting density (in plants per hectare).
    SWC was measured every 10–15 days during each growing season by using the gravimetric
    method. The SWC was measured every 20 cm over a depth of 0–100 cm by using the
    center of each plot as an observation point. The volumetric water content was
    obtained by multiplying the gravimetric water content by the bulk density. The
    cylindrical core method (Casanova et al., 2016), which is widely used in agricultural
    soils, was used to measure the soil bulk density. Yield was measured after the
    planted maize was harvested. To determine the crop parameters of the regional-scale
    CERES–Maize model, we estimated the LAI of summer maize at different growth stages
    across the study area by constructing a model by using remote sensing data and
    the measured LAI. In 2021, 56 sampling areas with a size of 10 m × 10 m were established
    in the study area to monitor the regional-scale growth of summer maize (Fig. 2).
    We selected areas that were located away from roads and trees to prevent roads
    and trees from influencing the obtained satellite signals. The central location
    of the sampling areas was determined using a global positioning system. Three
    independent sampling points with a size of 1 m × 1 m were randomly selected in
    each sampling area, and the value of each sampling index (i.e., LAI, SWC, plant
    height, and yield) for each sampling area was the average of the values obtained
    for the three sampling points. LAI, plant height, and SWC at a depth of 0–20 cm
    were measured at the V5 (fifth leaf collar), V7 (seventh leaf collar), V10 (tenth
    leaf collar), and R1 (silking) stages, and yield was measured at maize maturity.
    In addition, data on planting date, planting depth, plant spacing, row spacing,
    irrigation time, irrigation quantity, irrigation method, fertilizer application
    time, fertilizer application rate, and fertilizer application method were collected
    for each sampling area. 2.2.2. Remote sensing data To determine the distribution
    of summer maize, we used Sentinel-2 data with high spatial resolution (the resolution
    for this data set is 10 m in the blue, green, red, and near-infrared bands and
    20 m in the short-wave infrared and red-edge bands) to calculate vegetation indices
    (i.e., normalized difference vegetation index, normalized difference water index,
    and normalized difference built-up index). Sentinel-2 provides data for all land
    surfaces and coastal areas for every 5-day period. The measured spectral range
    extends from the visible spectrum to the short-wave infrared region (Richter et
    al., 2012). The Sentinel-2 top-of-atmosphere data archived in the Google Earth
    Engine have been radiometrically and geometrically corrected; therefore, we extracted
    the maize growing areas in the study area by using a random forest classifier
    (Pal, 2005) and the vegetation indices calculated from Sentinel-2 top-of-atmosphere
    data that were captured during the maize growing season in the summer of 2021.
    On the basis of the extracted summer maize growing areas, we estimated the LAI
    of maize by using backscatter information from Sentinel-1 data. The measurements
    of the microwave sensing system of Sentinel-1 were marginally affected by solar
    radiation, and this system has all-weather working capability with a revisit period
    of 12 or 6 days. Thus, Sentinel-1 images are suitable for estimating the LAI of
    maize in cloudy and rainy areas (Hosseini et al., 2021). We used the Sentinel-1
    Ground Range Detected (GRD) product provided by Google Earth Engine. This product
    has been subject to preprocessing, radiometrically calibration, and topographical
    correction (Veci et al., 2014). To reduce coherent speckle noise, the Lee method
    (Lee et al., 1999) was used to filter the GRD product. Backscatter intensities
    and incidence angles were extracted from the GRD product for vertical transmit–vertical
    receive polarization (cross-polarization) and vertical transmit–horizontal receive
    polarization (like-polarization). 2.3. Data-assimilation-based determination of
    the crop genetic coefficient of the CERES–Maize model Data assimilation, which
    was proposed by Charney et al. (1969), is a scientific method for integrating
    intermittent observations and models to reduce the uncertainty of experimental
    observation errors in model parameter determination. We used this method to integrate
    intermittent satellite observations with the CERES–Maize crop model to obtain
    high-precision crop model parameters. Many data assimilation methods are available
    (Curnel et al., 2011, Agyeman et al., 2021, Wu et al., 2021), and the data assimilation
    method based on the minimization of the cost function is widely used (Curnel et
    al., 2011). In this method, data assimilation is achieved by iteratively adjusting
    the parameters of a crop model through an assimilation algorithm to minimize the
    difference between the estimated values obtained using remote sensing data and
    the simulated values obtained using the crop model. Therefore, we estimated the
    regional LAI through support vector regression (SVR) modeling and then assimilated
    the estimated LAI into the CERES–Maize crop model to obtain the regional-scale
    crop model parameters. 2.3.1. SVR-based estimation of the regional LAI To estimate
    the LAI of summer maize in the study area, SVR (Joachims, 1998) was used to fit
    the relationships among backscatter intensity, incident angle, date of LAI measurement,
    and measured LAI in 2021. We transformed date of LAI measurement into the day
    of year format. SVR has been widely used to estimate the LAI of maize (Mandal
    et al., 2019, Hosseini et al., 2021). SVR is a statistical machine learning method
    where variables are mapped to a high-dimensional space to transform a low-dimensional
    nonlinear problem into a high-dimensional linear regression problem. We derived
    the code of the SVR algorithm from the LIBSVM online library (https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/∼cjlin/libsvm/index.html).
    An SVR model maps nonlinear data from a low-dimensional space to a high-dimensional
    space by using kernel functions. The Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) kernel
    has strong approximation properties because of its few hyperparameters and high
    accuracy. Therefore, the RBF kernel was selected as the kernel function for constructing
    an SVR model in this study. Cost (C) and gamma (γ) are two key hyperparameters
    in the training of an SVR model. In this study, the grid search method (Hsu et
    al., 2003) and five-fold cross-validation were used to find the best combination
    of hyperparameters. After the optimal hyperparameters were determined, 224 field-scale
    LAI observations from 56 sampling areas and the corresponding remote sensing data
    were randomly divided into training and testing data sets. The training data set
    contained 140 sets of remote sensing data and the corresponding field-scale LAI
    measured; it was used to train the SVR-based LAI model. The testing data set contained
    84 sets of remote sensing data and the corresponding field-scale LAIs that were
    obtained through measurement. The performance of the LAI estimation model was
    evaluated in terms of coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean square error
    (RMSE), which were calculated as (3), (4). 2.3.2. CERES–Maize model The CERES–Maize
    model (Jones and Kiniry, 1986) embedded in the DSSAT (Hoogenboom et al., 2010)
    was used to simulate the temporal variation in the LAI of maize. In addition,
    the CERES–Maize model can describe the daily growth and development of maize under
    temperature stress, water stress, and nitrogen fertilizer stress (Ritchie, 1998).
    To calculate the daily soil water balance, this model uses a one-dimensional,
    \"tipping-bucket\" soil water balance method to predict soil water flow and root
    water uptake in up to 10 soil horizons (Ritchie, 1985b). To run the field-scale
    CERES–Maize model, meteorological data, soil data, cultivar coefficients, and
    field management information must be input into it. The minimum meteorological
    data required for this model include daily precipitation, maximum daily air temperature,
    minimum daily air temperature, and daily solar radiation. The aforementioned meteorological
    data for the Wugong and Yangling experimental stations were obtained from the
    China Meteorological Data Service Center (http://data.cma.cn/) and Yangling meteorological
    station, respectively. We used the method of Angstrom (1924) to calculate daily
    solar radiation from daily data on sunshine duration. The basic soil data required
    for the CERES–Maize model were those on bulk weight, organic carbon content, clay
    content, silt content, field capacity, wilting point, saturated water content,
    and soil pH, all of which were obtained through laboratory measurements. Field
    management information was obtained from our experiments at the Wugong and Yangling
    stations. Six cultivar coefficients (Table 1) were obtained by calibrating the
    field-scale CERES–Maize model. The 2016 and 2020 field-scale trial data (LAI,
    SWC, and yield) were used to calibrate this model, and the 2017 and 2021 field-scale
    trial data were used to validate the model. The performance of the field-scale
    CERES–Maize model was evaluated using determination (R2) and root mean square
    error (RMSE), and average relative error (ARE), which were calculated as follows:
    (3) (4) (5) where n is the number of observed values; Oi and Si are the observed
    and simulated values for the ith data pair, respectively; and.. and are the observed
    average and simulated average, respectively. An R2 value close to 1 and RMSE and
    ARE values close to 0 indicate high agreement between the observed and simulated
    values. Table 1. Ranges of cultivar coefficients in the CERES–Maize model. Variable

    30 90 Crop model regionalization was achieved by running the crop model for each
    simulation unit of the study area. Therefore, the input parameters of the crop
    model also had to be regionalized. Considering the study purpose and to minimize
    computational cost, we used a grid of size 5 km × 5 km to divide the study area
    into different simulation units. We used ordinary kriging interpolation to estimate
    the meteorological station data for each grid. As for soil data, a study by Han
    et al. (2015) obtained gridded soil data with a resolution of 5′. To ensure consistency
    between the resolution of the soil and meteorological data, we generated gridded
    values of soil data at a scale of 5 × 5 km2 through inverse distance weighted
    interpolation. We obtained field management information through field measurements
    and interviews with local farmers (Section 2.2.1). Different cultivars of the
    same crop usually exhibit some similarity, which indicates that the crop parameters
    calibrated for a field-scale crop model can act as a reference for calibrating
    crop parameters for a regional-scale crop model (Lu et al., 2021b). However, sensitivity
    analysis had to be conducted in this study to determine which cultivar parameters
    had to be spatialized and which cultivar parameters could be obtained from a calibrated
    field-scale crop model. 2.3.3. Sensitivity analysis Because the CERES–Maize model
    contains many crop parameters and the irrigation and fertilization data for the
    sampling area were obtained through surveys, a certain degree of uncertainty existed
    in the model. To accurately obtain the crop parameters, we conducted sensitivity
    analysis to identify sensitive and insensitive parameters. Insensitive parameters
    were identified using the relatively refined field-scale experimental results,
    and sensitive parameters were identified using the LAI estimated from remote sensing
    data for the entire study area. The extended Fourier amplitude sensitivity test
    (EFAST; Saltelli et al., 1999) was used to identify the sensitive parameters.
    The EFAST is a global sensitivity analysis method based on variance decomposition.
    In this test, the variance of the model simulation results is decomposed to obtain
    the sensitivity index of each parameter. The higher the sensitivity index of a
    parameter, the stronger is its influence on the model output. 2.3.4. Integration
    of the shuffled complex evolution method developed at The University of Arizona
    (SCE-UA) for data assimilation The sensitive parameters of the CERES–Maize model
    were iteratively adjusted using assimilation algorithms to minimize the difference
    between the LAI estimated from microwave remote sensing data and the LAI simulated
    using the regional scale CERES–Maize model. To quantify this difference, the following
    cost function was constructed: (6) where J is the cost function, X is a vector
    composed of the parameters to be calibrated, is the LAI simulated using the regional
    scale CERES–Maize model, is the LAI estimated using remote sensing data, Q is
    the number of LAI observations, and K is the number of simulation units. The parameter
    represents the average LAI of all maize pixels within each simulation unit. To
    identify sensitive cultivar coefficients for maize, we used the SCE-UA optimization
    algorithm (Duan et al., 1993) to minimize the cost function presented in Eq. (6).
    This algorithm is a global optimization algorithm that combines the advantages
    of deterministic search, stochastic search, and competitive evolution and is insensitive
    to the initial values of optimization parameters (Huang et al., 2019). If the
    optimized parameter values are within a predefined normalized geometric range
    (0.001) (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/7671-shuffled-complex-evolution-sce-ua-
    method) and the decrease in the cost function does not exceed 0.01% after 10 iterations,
    then the SCE-UA algorithm is considered to have converged. 2.4. Irrigation schedule
    optimization Through the use of calibrated regional-scale CERES–Maize model, the
    INSs for summer maize in subregions MZ1, MZ2, and MZ3 were optimized for each
    typical-rainfall year by using a multiobjective optimization algorithm. 2.4.1.
    Identification of typical-rainfall years Multiyear historical precipitation data
    for the crop growing season are essential for identifying typical-rainfall years
    (Guo et al., 2021). To determine the typical-rainfall years at the regional scale,
    we used the ordinary kriging interpolation method to generate daily rainfall data
    with a spatial resolution of 5 km × 5 km for the study area for 51 years from
    1970 to 2020. We then obtained the daily average rainfall data for the MZ1, MZ2,
    and MZ3 subregions. Subsequently, the daily rainfall data were used accumulated
    to determine the precipitation in 51 summer maize growing seasons in each subregion,
    and these precipitation data were used to identify typical-rainfall years. Through
    empirical frequency analysis, we identified that 25%, 50%, and 75% of the cumulative
    frequency curve of precipitation for each subregion represented wet, normal, and
    dry years, respectively. 2.4.2. Irrigation schedule optimization model The multiobjective
    optimization of the INSs was conducted by maximizing yield, WUE, and PFPN, which
    reflected the objectives of pursuing high crop yield, saving water, improving
    NUE, and reducing pollution. Irrigation frequency, irrigation time, irrigation
    quantity, nitrogen application time, and nitrogen application rate were used as
    decision variables in the adopted multiobjective optimization algorithm. The yield,
    WUE, and PFPN can be achieved using the regional-scale CERES–Maize model. (7)
    (8) where Y is the average crop yield (kg/ha); K is the number of simulation units
    in subregion MZ1, MZ2, or MZ3; and j is the irrigation frequency. The units of
    WUE and PFPN in Eq. (8) are kg/m3 and kg/kg, respectively. According to farmers
    in the study area, the irrigation frequency was such that j ∈ {1, 2, 3}. During
    the maize growing season, a part of the nitrogen quantity used was applied as
    a base dose during sowing, and the remaining quantity was distributed equally
    according to the irrigation frequency. The parameters t1–tj represent the irrigation
    dates, w1–wj represent the irrigation quantities, f1–fj denote the nitrogen application
    rates, and fb is the base nitrogen dose during sowing. When j = 1, w2 = w3 = 0
    and f2 = f3 = 0. Moreover, when j = 2, w3 = 0 and f3 = 0. We solved the aforementioned
    multiobjective optimization problem by using NSGA-III (Deb and Jain, 2013), which
    combines the principles of evolutionary optimization and multiobjective optimization.
    This algorithm is useful for optimizing complex nonlinear objectives, which makes
    it a powerful tool for multiobjective decision-making. NSGA-III uses specific
    encoding to convert the decision variable data in the solution space into data
    with a genotype string structure in a genetic space, and the converted data are
    analogous to chromosomes (Kumar, 2013). To reduce coding redundancy, the genes
    j, a1, a2, a3, w1, w2, w3, β, and fT were used as constituents of the chromosomes
    (Fig. 3). The meaning of each gene is presented in Table 2. Download : Download

    the duration of the irrigation interval. The numbers in parentheses represent
    the irrigation quantity or nitrogen application rate for the corresponding gene.
    With regard to irrigation quantity, 1, 2, …, and 7 represent values of 60, 65,
    …, and 90 mm, respectively. With respect to nitrogen application rate, 1, 2, …,
    and 9 represent values of 90, 120, …, and 330 kg/ha, respectively. Before calculating
    the objective function by using the CERES-Maize model, the chromosome data had
    to be decoded into decision variables (i.e., irrigation date, irrigation quantity,
    and nitrogen rate). To avoid conflicts between previous and subsequent irrigation
    times, (9), (10), (11) were used for decoding to determine the irrigation date.
    A diagram of irrigation dates is displayed in Fig. 4. (9) (10) (11) where pd is
    the planting date of summer maize, lGP is duration of the growth period, and hd
    is the harvest date. The harvest date of summer maize in each subregion was set
    as October 1. The ration factors (a1, a2, and a3) reflect the duration of the
    irrigation interval, and t1, t2, and t3 denote the irrigation dates. In addition,
    given the level of local irrigation technology, the irrigation quantity and nitrogen
    application rate were set as multiples of 5, and the irrigation time (i.e., top
    dressing time) was rounded off to the nearest whole number for the DSSAT. Download

    of irrigation dates. The meaning of each parameter is the same as that in (9),
    (10), (11). PlatEMO (Tian et al., 2017) is a MATLAB platform (MathWorks, Natick,
    MA, USA) that can be used to execute NSGA-III. We wrote a MATLAB program for the
    input and output of the DSSAT. This program generates an experiment file (. MZX
    file) in the standard format of the DSSAT, and this file includes details on the
    irrigation date, irrigation quantity, nitrogen application date, and nitrogen
    application rate. The executable file named DSCSM047. EXE is used by the MATLAB
    program to obtain the yield, WUE, and PFPN for an experiment. Thus, the objective
    function of NSGA-III can be simply and elegantly integrated into the DSSAT. NSGA-III
    is considered to have converged when the hypervolume is visually smooth (Emmerich
    et al., 2005, Kropp et al., 2019). In addition, to improve the computational efficiency,
    the INS optimization process was run on an AMD Ryzen 7 1700 eight-core processor
    with the support of a MATLAB parallel computing toolbox. 2.4.3. Determination
    of the optimal irrigation schedule NSGA-III is a multiobjective optimization algorithm
    that obtains a Pareto solution set by determining the best trade-off between multiple
    conflicting objectives. Because the optimal solution in the solution set cannot
    maximize all the objectives simultaneously, Technique for Order of Preference
    by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) was used to determine the optimal INS
    in this study. The weights of each objective greatly affect the decision results
    of the TOPSIS. Each objective can be assigned a weight by using subjective or
    objective weighting methods. Obtaining subjective preferences regarding the importance
    of the three objectives in this study (i.e., maximizing yield, WUE, and PFPN)
    was difficult. Therefore, the objective weighting method was used to determine
    the weights of these objectives. Researchers have developed many objective weighting
    methods, including the entropy method (Rani et al., 2019), principal component
    analysis (PCA) (Peng et al., 2020), the coefficient of variation (CV) method (El-Santawy,
    2015), and the Criteria Importance Though Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC) method
    (Diakoulaki et al., 1995). In the entropy and CV methods, the discreteness of
    solutions is used to describe the importance of each objective while ignoring
    the correlations between objectives. In PCA, multiple correlated variables are
    converted into several integrated uncorrelated variables; however, PCA does not
    reflect the discreteness of solutions. Some discreteness and correlation existed
    among the three objectives of this study. By contrast, in the CRITIC method, standard
    deviation and correlation coefficient are used to measure the discreteness and
    correlation between two objectives, respectively. (12) where wu is the weights
    of the uth objective, σu is the standard deviation of the uth objective, ruv is
    the correlation coefficient between the uth and vth objective, and V (= 3) is
    the number of objectives. After the weights of each objective were determined,
    the TOPSIS (Yoon and Hwang, 1995) was used to determine the optimal INS. The basic
    idea of the TOPSIS is to rank solutions by calculating their distance from the
    positive and negative ideal solutions. The best solution is closest to the positive
    ideal solution and farthest from the negative ideal solution. In the TOPSIS, the
    information of the original data can be fully used. Moreover, the TOPSIS can fully
    reflect the gap between solutions and has the advantages of being accurate, reliable,
    and universal. By using the TOPSIS, we normalized the Pareto solution sets of
    yield, WUE, and PFPN to eliminate their dimensional differences. The normalized
    objectives were then multiplied by their respective weights to construct a weighted
    objective matrix Z. The matrix Z is a M × V matrix, where M is the number of Pareto
    solutions, and V is the number of objectives. The positive ideal solution Zbest
    and negative ideal solution Zworst were determined according to Z. These solutions
    were row vectors that reflected the optimal and worst values, respectively, of
    yield, WUE, and PFPN. The relative closeness RCi was calculated according to the
    Euclidean distance of the Pareto solution from the positive and negative ideal
    solutions. (13) (14) where and are the positive and negative ideal solutions of
    the vth objective, respectively; is the Euclidean distance between the mth Pareto
    solution and the positive ideal solution; is the Euclidean distance between the
    mth Pareto solution and the negative ideal solution (m = 1, …, M); and RCm represents
    the relative closeness of the mth Pareto solution. The closer RCm is to 1, the
    closer is the corresponding Pareto solution to the positive ideal solution and
    the farther is this solution from the negative ideal solution. Moreover, Pareto
    solutions can be ranked according to their RCm values to determine the optimal
    solution. 3. Results 3.1. Estimation of the regional LAI LAI and plant height

    to the R1 stage, plant height [Fig. 5(a)] and LAI [Fig. 5(b)], which are represented
    by the medians of the box plots in Fig. 5, gradually increased. The R1 stage was
    the turning point from vegetative growth to reproductive growth for summer maize
    (Fang et al., 2021), with the peak plant height and LAI occurring in this stage.
    In the aforementioned stage, approximately 75% of the summer maize plants had
    a height exceeding 2.6 m and approximately 75% of the summer maize plants had
    an LAI higher than 4.8. On the basis of the measured LAI of summer maize for 56
    sampling areas, an SVR model was developed using backscatter intensity, incidence
    angle, and date when the LAI was measured to estimate the LAI of summer maize.

    close to the 1:1 line. The developed LAI estimation model could predict the LAI
    with acceptable accuracy. Therefore, we used this model to estimate the LAI at
    the regional scale (Fig. 7). Download : Download high-res image (159KB) Download

    obtained through spatial interpolation after the LAI of each maize pixel was calculated.
    As displayed in Fig. 7, the LAI of each subregion (MZ1, MZ2, and MZ3) gradually
    increased with the progress of summer maize growth. In the V5 stage, the differences
    in the LAI values of MZ1 and MZ2 were not obvious, and the LAI of these subregions
    was mainly concentrated between 0.4 and 1. The LAI of MZ3 was higher than that
    of the other two subregions and was mainly concentrated between 0.6 and 1.59.
    In the V7 and V10 stages, the LAI of maize exhibited obvious differences among
    the subregions. In the R1 stage, the LAI of MZ1, MZ2, and MZ3 reached the maximum
    value, and the LAI of MZ3 was marginally smaller than that of the other two subregions.
    3.2. Performance evaluation of the field- and regional-scale CERES–Maize models
    On the basis of the results of sensitivity analysis, the P2, P5, and sowing date
    (Jin et al., 2016, Wang et al., 2021), which had the highest sensitivity index
    values, were re-estimated during data assimilation, and the other parameters,
    including P1, G2, G3, and PHINT, were derived from the calibrated field-scale
    CERES–Maize model. To obtain the parameters of the field-scale CERES–Maize model
    (Table 3), this model was calibrated using field data for 2016 and 2020 (Fig.
    8) and then validated using field data for 2017 and 2021 (Fig. 8). Table 3. Estimated

    black dots represent the calibration results of the CERES–Maize model using the
    field data from 2016 and 2020, and the red dots represent the validation results
    of the CERES–Maize model using the field data from 2017 and 2021. During the calibration
    stage, the LAI (Fig. 8(a)) and yield (Fig. 8(b)) simulated using the calibrated
    field-scale CERES–Maize model matched well with the measured LAI and yield, respectively.
    The corresponding R2 and RMSE for LAI were 0.97 and 0.21 m2/m2, and for yield
    they were 0.95 and 178.80 kg/ha, respectively. During the validation stage (Fig.
    8(b)), the field-scale crop model also performed well in simulating LAI and yield.
    The corresponding R2 and RMSE for LAI were 0.94 and 0.29 m2/m2, and for yield
    they were 0.94 and 316.03 kg/ha, respectively. Subsequently, the EFAST was used
    to identify sensitive parameters (sowing date, P2, and P5) that affect daily LAI.
    Three sensitive parameters were re-estimated for the MZ1, MZ2, and MZ3 subregions
    and the entire region by using data assimilation methods (Table 3). Differences
    in cultivar coefficients and sowing dates were found between the regional and
    field scales and among subregion MZ1, subregion MZ2, subregion MZ3, and the entire
    study area. The aforementioned parameters in Table 3 were used to simulate LAI,
    plant height, SWC (depth of 0–20 cm), and yield for the 56 sampling areas (Fig.
    9). Download : Download high-res image (655KB) Download : Download full-size image

    model obtained through data assimilation and calibration when the entire study
    area was divided into subregions MZ1, MZ2, and MZ3. As displayed in Fig. 9, the
    simulation performance of the regional-scale CERES–Maize model was better than
    that of the field-scale CERES–Maize model in terms of the R2, RMSE, and MRE of
    the growth indicators of summer maize (LAI, plant height, SWC, and yield). In
    addition, the simulation performance of the regional-scale CERES–Maize model was
    better when the study area was divided into three subregions than when the study
    area was not divided into subregions. The R2 values for LAI, plant height, SWC
    and yield increased by 0.02, 0.04, 0.10, and 0.15, respectively, while the RMSE
    values decreased by 0.36 m2/m2, 0.04 m, 0.01 cm3/cm3, and 203.33 kg/ha, and the
    MRE values decreased by 33.12%, 2.67%, 5.23%, and 1.67%, respectively. In summary,
    the regional-scale crop model in which the crop parameters and sowing date are
    determined through the data assimilation method better reflected the growth characteristics
    of summer maize at the regional scale when the study area was divided into three
    subregions than when the area was not divided into subregions. Therefore, we used
    the regional-scale CERES–Maize model to determine the optimal INS for each subregion.
    3.3. Irrigation schedule optimization Before using the regional-scale CERES–Maize
    model to establish an INS for the MZ1, MZ2, and MZ3 subregions, typical-rainfall
    years (dry, normal, and wet years) were identified according to the rainfall during
    the summer maize growing season in each subregion. Table 4 presents the average
    air temperature and total rainfall during the summer maize growing season for
    each typical-rainfall year in each subregion. Fig. 10 depicts the maximum daily
    air temperature, minimum daily air temperature, and daily rainfall for each typical-rainfall
    year in each subregion. Table 4. Average air temperature and total precipitation

    The meaning of other strings can be derived from this. The method described in
    Section 2.4.2 was used for the multiobjective optimization of the INS for each
    subregion in three typical-precipitation years, and Pareto solution sets for maximizing
    yield, WUE, and PFPN were obtained (Fig. 11). WUE increased with yield up to a
    certain point before decreasing. The objective of maximizing PFPN conflicted with
    the objectives of maximizing WUE and yield. Therefore, the weights of yield, WUE,
    and PFPN for different subregions in three typical-rainfall years were determined
    separately by using the CRITIC method. We found that the differences in weights
    were small in each case. To reflect the overall relevance of and conflict among
    the three objectives in different typical-rainfall years in different subregions,
    we integrated the Pareto solution sets in nine cases to determine the weights.
    The final determined weights for yield, WUE, and PFPN were 0.41, 0.28, and 0.31,
    respectively. After the weights were determined, the optimal solutions for different
    subregions in a dry year, normal year, and wet year were determined using the
    TOPSIS (black triangles in Fig. 11). The corresponding optimal INSs are presented
    in Table 5. For comparison, the current INSs used by farmers are also included

    in terms of days after sowing. The numbers outside the parentheses are the relevant
    parameters for the optimized INSs obtained in this study, and the numbers in parentheses
    are the relevant parameters for the current INSs used by farmers. The current
    INSs were obtained from two reports (Administration, 2020, Shaanxi Provincial
    Market Supervision and Administration Bureau, 2020) and from a survey of farmers
    at the 56 sampling areas. The mean nitrogen application rates in MZ1, MZ2, and
    MZ3 were 283, 265, and 242 kg/ha, respectively, with the corresponding standard
    deviations being 43, 62, and 55 kg/ha, respectively. As presented in Table 5,
    compared with the current INSs used by farmers, the optimized INSs were associated
    with marginally higher irrigation quantities (average increase of 2.66%) but considerably
    lower nitrogen application rates (average decrease of 31.6%). Except for the dry
    year in MZ1 and the dry and normal years in MZ2, the optimized INSs were associated
    with more frequent irrigation than were the currently used INSs. In the currently
    used INSs, nitrogen is applied during the maize jointing stage, whereas in the
    optimized INSs, nitrogen is applied during irrigation, which increases the frequency
    of nitrogen application, reduces the nitrogen application rate in each instance
    of nitrogen application, and reduces the total nitrogen application rate. The
    average ratio of base fertilizer to top dressing corresponding to the currently
    used INSs was 2:3, and the ratio of base fertilizer to top dressing corresponding
    to the optimized INSs varied in different subregions and typical-rainfall years.
    Fig. 12 depicts the yield, WUE, and PFPN of summer maize under the optimal INS
    in each subregion in different typical-rainfall years. The maize yield was lower
    in MZ2 than in MZ1 and MZ3 in different typical-rainfall years because of the
    higher rainfall, higher number of cloudy days, and lower temperature in MZ2 (Table
    4; Fig. 10). Therefore, the WUE for MZ2 was lower than that for MZ1 and MZ3 in
    the wet year. The PFPN for MZ1 was generally lower than that for MZ2 and MZ3 because
    of the sandy soils in MZ1, which exhibited low effectiveness in retaining fertilizer.
    In general, yield and WUE were high in most cases, and PFPN was higher than 45 kg/kg
    in most cases. For the dry, normal, and wet years, the average yields in the study
    area were 9429, 9465, and 10218 kg/ha, respectively; the average WUEs were 2.48,
    2.53, and 2.31 kg/m3, respectively; and the average PFPNs were 54.46, 55.23, and
    58.49 kg/kg, respectively. Download : Download high-res image (365KB) Download

    percentage changes in yield, WUE, and PFPN between the optimum and currently used
    INSs. Yield and WUE increased in the majority of the areas, with the average increases
    in yield being 12.51%, 6.35%, and 8.93% during the dry, normal, and wet years,
    respectively, and the average increases in WUE being 10.41%, 2.64%, and 5.58%
    during the dry, normal, and wet years, respectively. In particular, yield and
    WUE increased more in MZ1 than in the other subregions in the dry year. PFPN increased
    in all cases, with the average increase being 66.17%, 62.35%, and 61.81% for the
    dry, normal, and wet years, respectively. The MZ2 subregion exhibited the highest
    overall increase in PFPN, the MZ1 subregion exhibited the highest increase in
    PFPN in the dry year, and some areas in the MZ3 subregion exhibited the highest
    increase in PFPN in the normal and wet years. Certain areas exhibited increases
    in PFPN but decreases in yield and WUE. The percentages of the study area that
    exhibited a decrease of more than 3% in yield were 13.89%, 8.53%, and 2.80% in
    the dry, normal, and wet years, respectively. Moreover, the percentages of the
    study area that exhibited a decrease of more than 3% in WUE were 9.39%, 6.53%,
    and 3.41% for the dry, normal, and wet years, respectively. In the dry, normal,
    and wet years, the maximum yield reduction rates were 14.12%, 11.31%, and 11.47%,
    respectively, and the maximum reduction rates of WUE were 13.11%, 6.35%, and 8.86%,

    after the relative changes in yield, WUE, and PFPN were calculated for each maize
    pixel. 4. Discussion 4.1. Increase in the regional simulation accuracy of the
    regional-scale CERES–Maize model when using remotely sensed LAI The calibrated
    field-scale CERES–Maize model performed well in simulating field-scale yield and
    LAI (Fig. 8) because this model is developed for fields with a single maize cultivar
    and homogeneous maize growing environment (Jones and Kiniry, 1986). The CERES–Maize
    model can reproduce maize growth as long as the user can accurately input soil
    data, meteorological data, field management data, and cultivar coefficients into
    the model (Amouzou et al., 2018, Malik et al., 2019). The regional-scale CERES–Maize
    model calibrated using remotely sensed LAI performed much better in the simulation
    of regional-scale maize growth than did the field-scale CERES–Maize model calibrated
    using field-trial data (Fig. 9). This result was obtained because the spatial
    variability in the soil and meteorological conditions in each sampling area considerably
    decreased when the study area was divided into multiple simulation units. Guo
    et al. (2021) and Shelia et al. (2019) have demonstrated that decreases in the
    spatial variability of soil and meteorological conditions cause an increase in
    the regional simulation accuracy of a crop model. When the study area was not
    divided into three subregions, the regional-scale crop model could not simulate
    the regional crop growth well. This result indicates that a single set of crop
    parameters cannot accurately represent a large area; therefore, large study regions
    must be divided into different subregions and crop parameters must be determined
    for each subregion. Therond et al. (2011) conducted a study using crop models
    to simulate the growth of maize and wheat in 12 regions of the European Union,
    which also confirmed the necessity of this approach. Consequently, we re-estimated
    the satisfactory maize cultivar coefficients and sowing dates for the MZ1, MZ2,
    and MZ3 subregions by using the LAI estimated from microwave remote sensing data
    (Table 3). NDVI and soil characteristics should be considered when dividing a
    large region into subregions because these parameters reflect the combined effect
    of the crop growth environment and cultivar (Guo et al., 2018). Further exploration
    is required on how large areas can be reasonably subdivided when simulating regional
    crop growth. 4.2. Irrigation schedule optimization Compared with the current INSs
    used by farmers in the study area, the optimized INSs were associated with a marginally
    higher irrigation quantity (average increase of 2.66%) but considerably lower
    nitrogen application rate (average decrease of 31.6%). When the optimized INSs
    were used, yield and WUE increased in the majority of areas and PFPN increased
    in all areas. These results indicate that the optimized schedules are effective
    and increase yield, WUE, and PFPN. In this study, the nitrogen application rate
    was 150–210 kg/ha. Yang et al. (2017) compared the effects of different nitrogen
    rates on summer maize yield, NUE, nitrogen leaching, and nitrogen residue through
    field trials and recommended a nitrogen application rate of 180–200 kg/ha. This
    is because the nitrogen application rates derived using a regional-scale crop
    model can account for the crop yield, WUE, and NUE at a regional scale, whereas
    the nitrogen application rates derived through field trials can only reflect the
    situation at a point scale and for a limited number of years. Thus, we believed
    that the optimized INSs were reasonable. The optimized INSs resulted in an increase
    in PFPN but decreases in yield and WUE in some areas (Fig. 11), which might be
    attributed to a combination of soil and climatic conditions. Additional detailed
    studies are required to improve yield and WUE in these locations. The results
    of this study suggest that regional-scale crop models can adequately characterize
    regional soil, meteorological, and crop cultivar differences to reflect the effects
    of irrigation and fertilization on crop yield; thus, these models can be used
    to develop optimized INSs that are suitable for the regional scale. The irrigation
    quantity was marginally higher in the optimized INSs than in the presently used
    INSs because we reduced the nitrogen application rate to reduce environmental
    pollution. This step was not performed when developing the presently used INSs.
    Compared with the currently used INSs, the optimized INSs exhibited marginally
    higher irrigation quantities, considerably lower nitrogen application rates, and
    higher yields and WUEs; thus, the optimized schedules are reasonable. The objectives
    of saving water and fertilizer and increasing yield can be achieved by changing
    their weights. In the currently used INSs, nitrogen is applied only once after
    sowing, and in the optimized INSs, nitrogen is applied during irrigation, which
    increases irrigation frequency, reduces the nitrogen application rate during each
    instance of nitrogen application, reduces total nitrogen application rate, and
    thus increases PFPN. The aforementioned results are obtained because split nitrogen
    application can effectively reduce nitrogen leaching and increase nitrogen uptake
    by crops (Mueller et al., 2017). The current practice of applying nitrogen only
    during the sowing and jointing stages of maize growth can cause nitrate nitrogen
    to move downward in the soil because of rainfall and irrigation; thus, the nitrogen
    fertilizer needs of maize cannot be met during the later stages of growth, and
    soil contamination occurs (Zhao et al., 2006, Lu et al., 2021a). Overall, the
    constructed regional-scale crop models can characterize regional soil, meteorological,
    and crop cultivar differences to reflect the effects of irrigation and nitrogen
    on crop yield. It should be pointed out that when formulating INSs at the regional
    scale, we have taken special consideration of the spatial representativeness of
    crop parameters, which has been rare in previous studies. Therefore, regional-scale
    crop models can be used to develop INSs that are suitable for the regional scale.
    5. Conclusions We developed a framework for optimizing regional INSs that consists
    of the CERES–Maize model, microwave remote sensing data, and a multiobjective
    optimization algorithm. This framework can be used to optimize the INS for crops
    grown over a large area. The conclusions of this study are as follows. First,
    microwave backscatter intensity, microwave incidence angle, and date of LAI measurement
    can be input into an SVR model to obtain accurate predictions of the LAI of summer
    maize. Microwave remote sensing data are less affected by cloud and rain than
    are optical remote sensing data; thus, microwave remote sensing data can be feasibly
    used to estimate LAI in areas with high cloud cover and rainfall. Second, the
    estimated regional LAI was input into an assimilation algorithm to determine the
    key cultivar coefficients of the CERES–Maize model. The crop model parameters
    determined using remote sensing data enabled more accurate simulations of LAI,
    plant height, SWC, and yield at the regional scale than did the crop model parameters
    determined using field-scale experiments. Third, the regional-scale CERES–Maize
    model was coupled with a multiobjective genetic algorithm to optimize the INSs
    for summer maize in different typical-rainfall years in different subregions.
    Compared with the INSs currently used by farmers, the optimized INSs were associated
    with an average increase of 2.66% in the irrigation quantity; an average decrease
    of 31.6% in the nitrogen application rate; and increases of 6.35–12.51%, 2.64–10.41%,
    and 61.8–66.2% in the yield, WUE, and PFPN, respectively, depending on the typical-rainfall
    year. The aforementioned results indicate that the optimized INSs increased maize
    yield, WUE, and PFPN. This phenomenon occurred mainly because the developed regional-scale
    CERES–Maize model fully accounts for the spatial variability in meteorological
    and soil parameters and the spatial representativeness of crop parameters in the
    study area. Optimized INSs established using regional-scale crop model parameters
    and remote sensing data can provide guidance to irrigation management departments.
    Based on the irrigation amounts identified in this paper, the government can encourage
    farmers to reduce nitrogen application and adopt a split nitrogen application
    approach to provide nitrogen nutrition to maize. However, this study did not directly
    address the costs associated with irrigation, nitrogen application, crop yield
    and environmental impacts. Further research is needed to explore these aspects.

  description: The crop coefficient (Kc) is a scaling factor to calculate crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc). Accurate prediction of Kc affects planning to allocate water resources,
    especially in arid and semi-arid areas with limited water sources availability.
    The conventional FAO approach has some limited applications due to using plant
    characteristics. However, existing artificial intelligence approaches have high
    performances, but encounter some instability in prediction. In the present study,
    the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) approach was applied
    to assess uncertainties arising from both model structure and input parameters.
    In addition, this study aims to derive the explicit predictive and usable equation
    for calculating the monthly Kc of maize. The equations were developed from the
    best hybrid MLP model using minimal meteorological data in four regions of Egypt.
    For this, the predictive utility of MLP-based models that hybridized with meta-heuristic
    optimization algorithms was examined. The rat swarm optimization (RSO), firefly
    algorithm (FFA), bat algorithm (BA), and genetic algorithm (GA) hybridized with
    MLP (MLP-RSO, MLP-FFA, MLP-BA, and MLP-GA) are used as equation derivation tools.
    The results showed that a unique hybrid Gamma Test-RSO is a powerful approach
    for determining the optimal combination (Tmax, Tmin, Rs) as the best input vector.
    The results showed that the hybrid MLP-RSO model decreased the average RMSE by
    13.87, 39.95, 45.68, and 53.09% than MLP-BA, MLP-FFA, MLP-GA, and MLP models,
    respectively. In addition, the uncertainty results showed that the Kc predictions
    were more stable and confident in MLP-RSO, while the average of 95PPU covered
    94.5 and 91.5% of actual Kc for input parameters and model structure uncertainties,
    respectively. In conclusion, the developed hybrid model and the techniques illustrated
    in the current study suggest substantial benefits for other researchers to derive
    mathematical equations from easily available meteorological variables in different
    regions and climates. Also, the findings provide a fundamental guideline for the
    local water users and agricultural development planners to achieve accurate and
    fast irrigation scheduling.

    uncertainties, respectively. In conclusion, the developed hybrid model and the
    techniques illustrated in the current study suggest substantial benefits for other
    researchers to derive mathematical equations from easily available meteorological
    variables in different regions and climates. Also, the findings provide a fundamental
    guideline for the local water users and agricultural development planners to achieve
    accurate and fast irrigation scheduling. Similar content being viewed by others

    11 March 2022 1 Introduction Providing food for the growing population is a major
    challenge, especially in regions with limited water resources that are already
    facing continuous drought. Hence, optimizing water management in different fields,
    particularly for agriculture and irrigation, is necessary to gain optimal yield
    without water loss [1]. In hydrological research and field management, accurate
    prediction of crop water requirements is required for agricultural water supervision
    and irrigation planning while also conserving water resources, especially in arid
    and semi-arid regions with high agricultural water consumption [2, 3]. A significant
    aspect in the development of irrigation water scheduling is crop coefficient (Kc),
    which is principally affected by the characteristics such as crop height, leaf
    area index, and greenness degree [4]. Therefore, the ability to accurately predict
    Kc at various crop development periods will further enhance the water-use efficiency
    of a crop to manage the irrigation water consumption [3]. According to Allen et
    al. [5], crop coefficients describe the one-of-a-kind variations between the reference
    evapotranspiration (ET0) and studied crops in terms of crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc). Because of its simplicity, the single crop coefficient technique is employed
    for most irrigation planning, design, and management applications, as addressed
    and summarized in the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) publication. Several
    methods were developed to calculate crop coefficient, including FAO-56 standard
    [5], hydraulic weighing lysimeter [6,7,8], FAO dual Kc methodologies [9,10,11],
    water balance [12,13,14], mathematical equations involving climatic, crop, and
    soil moisture variables [15], and watermarks and an atmometer [16]. The lysimeter
    and soil water balance approaches can be used to measure Kc directly [17]. Still,
    they are time-consuming, costly for applying technologies in large regions, and
    provide poor spatial representativeness of measurements. However, many researchers
    used lysimetric tests to evaluate the crop coefficients and to correlate them
    to those testified by FAO-56 reports [2, 18]. After that, for decades, remote
    sensing approaches have been enhanced to calculate crop coefficients at various
    locations [19, 20]. An artificial neural network (ANN) is the most common machine
    learning system that is widely used in different studies related to water requirement
    researches, such as transpiration [21], evapotranspiration [22,23,24], Pan evaporation
    [25,26,27,28], and crop coefficient [29, 30]. It can model complex and nonlinear
    systems due to self-organization, self-adaptation, and self-learning characteristics
    without the need to understand their existing internal control structure [31,
    32]. Elbeltagi et al. [30] assessed the Kc of maize crop using ANN models from
    2006 to 2016 at four Egyptian governorate locations. The findings indicated that
    the best model and correlation coefficients for prediction Kc have an accuracy
    close to one. Saggi and Jain [33] used fuzzy-genetic (FG) and regularization random
    forest (RRF) models to create an innovative multilevel model for estimating Kc.
    The findings from this study can be helpful to other locations with similar Kc
    for crop selection and optimal water use. This study aim is to explore the predictive
    capability of the multilayer perceptron (MLP) model by applying it to Kc and meteorological
    data. Also, the present study further aims to extract a helpful equation from
    the hybrid MLP-optimization algorithms prediction of the monthly Kc. The review
    of available studies reveals any effort was not made to find equations fitting
    Kc curves in all growth stages of plants. This objective can be easily expressed
    using the ANN model. Therefore, it is vital to develop robust, stable, and accurate
    approaches for the explicit derivation of novel predictive Kc equations in optimized
    ANN models regarding the readily accessible meteorological variables. This study
    makes an effort to derive a unique and exact tansig-based equation for calculating
    monthly Kc in different maize growth stages. This equation has the advantage to
    easily used by everyone while includes more effective meteorological variables
    which are readily available. It will extend our technical knowledge into the applicability
    of the white-box status of the optimized ANN model over the black-box to compute
    an intelligence-based Kc [34]. With the development of meta-heuristic optimization
    algorithms, hybridizing procedures of machine learning-optimization algorithms
    have increasingly been utilized in different studies to enhance model predictions.
    It is evident from the literature that hybrid models have a high capability to
    give the most accurate models’ parameters. Derivation of complex nonlinear equations
    between output and input variables has become possible and simple by using the
    ANN model [35]. The hybrid machine learning-optimization algorithm models have
    a complex structure and can produce some uncertainty in predictions. The reliability
    of predictions by hybrid models is affected by model and parameter uncertainties
    [36, 37]. Despite the popularity of hybrid optimization models for hydrological
    processes prediction, to the best of our knowledge, the assessment of hybrid model
    accuracy in predicting monthly Kc and uncertainty associated with those has been
    disregarded. With this viewpoint, the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation
    (GLUE) was used for model structure uncertainty and parameter uncertainty analysis
    to quantify the reliability and stability of the models. In light of the above
    explanations, the major contributions and novelty of the developed framework in
    the current study are summarized as follows: 1- Applying new intelligent optimized
    hybrid models (MLP-RSO, MLP-BA, MLP-FFA, MLP-GA) for modeling crop coefficient
    in the semi-arid region in Egypt. 2- The innovation is providing explicit model
    equations for calculating Kc using the most important and readily accessible meteorological
    variables via the best optimal GT solution. 3- Analyzing the developed models’
    parameters and models’ structure uncertainties for predicting Kc using the GLUE
    technique. 4- Develop hybrid gamma test (GT)-RSO for selecting the best input
    combination from eight input meteorological variables. 2 Materials and methods
    2.1 Study area The research region was in Egypt''s Nile Delta. The Egyptian Nile
    Delta is located in northern Egypt, where the Nile River empties into the Mediterranean
    Sea. The Nile Delta encompasses approximately 2% of Egypt''s land area but accounts
    for almost 63% of its agricultural land. The average yearly maximum air temperature
    is 24 °C, while the annual average lowest air temperature is 16 °C. Wind speeds
    ranged from 3.8 to 5.2 m/s, the rainy season began in October, and around 75%
    of the total rainfall fell between November and February. The rainiest months
    are December and January [38, 39]. As indicated in Fig. 1, four governorates are
    chosen in the Nile Delta. In this study, the maize crop was used. According to
    FAO, the maize crop was planted and harvested from May to October. Fig. 1 Map
    of the study area Full size image 2.2 Datasets Monthly data (from May to October)
    of minimum air temperature (Tmin), maximum air temperature (Tmax), mean air temperature
    (Tmean), solar radiation (Rs), wind speed (WS), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD),
    including 720 data for each governorate (study location), were extracted from
    open access data using ESRI''s ArcGIS software with latitude/longitude of 4 km
    grid cell center from 2000 to 2020 (Table 1). In addition, data on sunshine hours
    (SH) and relative humidity (RH), including 240 data for each governorate, were
    gathered from World Weather Online (WorldWeatherOnline.com) and Wunderground (wunderground.com)
    sites [40, 41]. Data for the worldwide land surface''s average maximum and minimum
    temperatures were obtained in NetCDF format from Climatic Research Unit Ts 4.0
    on a 0.5° grid [42]. Furthermore, Rs, WS, and VPD data were obtained in NetCDF
    format from the Japanese 55-year Reanalysis JRA-55 at a 1.25° grid [43]. Standard
    monthly Kc values, including 120 data for each governorate, were obtained from
    FAO-56 documentation. Overall, the datasets provided in this study consist 4320
    records of nine variables for all governorates. For exploring the impact of resolution
    differences on prediction, we have performed quantitative assessment and comparison
    for the different studied locations. The nonuniform data resolution did not affect
    the prediction. First, all the climatic variables from a specific (uniform) climate
    data station (world weather online) were adopted to estimate the deviation between
    these obtained data and those with different spatial resolution such as CRU and
    AJR. Several statistical approaches (descriptive analysis, analysis of variance
    (ANOVA), and model summary) were conducted for quantitative assessment. Second,
    these analyses were carried out for the four locations in the study area. It is
    shown that there is a high significance between the remote sensing-based values
    with different resolutions and those with uniform stations, which is proved by
    the lowest standard deviation and a high coefficient of determination for each
    climate variable. In fact, the nonuniform data resolution has not been proved
    to significantly affect the prediction in this study. Table 1 Meteorological variables
    characteristics of study locations Full size table According to FAO-56''s standard
    conditions (sufficient water supply, good management practices, and good growth),
    the crop coefficients of summer maize were suggested as Kcini(Tab) = 0.45 (the
    initial stage), Kcmid(Tab) = 1.2 (the middle stage), and Kcend(Tab) = 0.5 for
    initial, middle, and late stages, respectively. A linear difference was used to
    calculate the median. The values of Kcmid and Kcend can be adjusted according
    to different local climatic conditions as [3, 5, 44]: $${K}_{\\mathrm{cmid}-\\mathrm{FAO}56}={K}_{\\mathrm{cmid}(\\mathrm{Tab})}+\\left[0.04\\left({u}_{2}-2\\right)-0.004\\left({\\mathrm{RH}}_{\\mathrm{min}}-45\\right)\\right]{\\left(h/3\\right)}^{0.3}$$
    (1) $${K}_{\\mathrm{cend}-\\mathrm{FAO}56}={K}_{\\mathrm{cend}(\\mathrm{Tab})}+\\left[0.04\\left({u}_{2}-2\\right)-0.004\\left({\\mathrm{RH}}_{\\mathrm{min}}-45\\right)\\right]{\\left(h/3\\right)}^{0.3}$$
    (2) where u2 is the wind speed in 2 m height over grass during the growth stage
    and h is the average height of the plant in the two stages of middle and late.
    From Table 1, the Ad Dakahliyah and Al-Ismailiyah have the lowest and highest
    temperature variations (based on the Tmax, Tmin, and Tmean variables), respectively.
    Ash sharkiyah experienced the lowest average WS = 1.48 m s−1, which was more than
    2 m s−1 in other studied locations. The average SH of the Al-Gharbiyah (equal
    to 10.49 h) was almost one hour more than other studied locations. Also, the correlation
    matrixes between the input variables and output (Kc) are given in Appendix. As
    seen from Table 10, the highest correlation is obtained between Kc and Tmin in
    all studied locations, followed by Tmean. The VPD had the lowest correlation with
    Kc, and the correlation between Kc and WS was negative. For this study, different
    datasets were designed randomly and exanimated for the modeling process. The results
    showed that the subset of 70% for training and 30% for testing provides the lowest
    error in developing predictive models. 2.3 Generalized likelihood uncertainty
    estimation (GLUE) Uncertainty analysis of models is an appropriate tool to investigate
    predictive model stability and reliability. The GLUE analysis used in the present
    study has four main stages [36, 45]: 1- Numerous random sets are generated using
    Monte Carlo simulation from prior distributions. 2- The model is run using datasets,
    and a likelihood value is calculated for each parameter using Eq. 3. For this,
    the initial simulations from prior distributions are divided into two categories
    behavioral and nonbehavioral. If the variable’s value is more than the threshold
    likelihood, it recognizes behavioral. Behavioral simulations are used to evaluate
    the models. $$L\\left({\\theta }_{i}|{K}_{c}\\right)=\\mathit{exp}\\left[\\frac{-N{\\sigma
    }_{i}^{2}}{{\\sigma }_{{K}_{c}\\mathrm{obs}}^{2}}\\right]$$ (3) where \\({\\theta
    }_{i}\\) is the parameter set, \\({K}_{\\mathrm{c}}\\) is actual crop coefficients,
    \\(L\\left({\\theta }_{i}|{K}_{c}\\right)\\) is the likelihood measure for the
    ith model that is calculated using actual Kc, N is the shaping parameter, \\({\\sigma
    }_{i}^{2}\\) is the error variance for the ith model, and \\({\\sigma }_{{K}_{c}\\mathrm{obs}}^{2}\\)
    is the variance of actual Kc. 3- Simulation weights are rescaled for behavioral
    parameter sets, and the likelihood weight is calculated by Eq. 4 for uncertainty
    prediction:where \\({\\vartheta }_{i}\\) is a likelihood weight, and n is the
    number of data. $${\\vartheta }_{i}=\\frac{L\\left({\\theta }_{i}\\right)}{{\\sum
    }_{k=1}^{n}L\\left({\\theta }_{k}\\right)}$$ (4) The uncertainty of models was
    assessed using two indices of p and r for investigating the percentage of observed
    data bracketed by 95% prediction uncertainty (95PPU) and the mean 95PPU range
    (distance between upper and lower 95PPU), respectively, as following equations:
    $$p=100\\frac{c\\mathrm{ount}\\left({K}_{\\mathrm{c}}|{{K}_{\\mathrm{c}}}_{\\mathrm{L}95\\mathrm{PPU}}\\le
    {K}_{\\mathrm{c}}\\le {{K}_{\\mathrm{c}}}_{\\mathrm{U}95\\mathrm{PPU}}\\right)}{N}$$
    (5) $$r=\\frac{1}{n\\times \\sigma }\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{({{K}_{\\mathrm{c}}}_{\\mathrm{U}95\\mathrm{PPU}}-{{K}_{\\mathrm{c}}}_{\\mathrm{L}95\\mathrm{PPU}})}_{i}$$
    (6) where n is the number of observed data points, \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard
    deviation of observed Kc, and \\({{K}_{c}}_{L95\\mathrm{PPU}}\\) and \\({{K}_{c}}_{U95\\mathrm{PPU}}\\)
    are the upper and lower boundary of the 95PPU, respectively. 2.4 Machine learning
    and optimization models used 2.4.1 Multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithm A neural
    network takes the form of multiple layers, each of which has a certain number
    of neurons, where the minimum number of layers is three: the input layer, the
    output layer, and the hidden layer (or layers). Each neuron in each layer communicates
    with the neurons of the previous and subsequent layers. Any neuron in these layers
    expresses a mathematical function that calculates a specific value. MLP is one
    of the most popular ANN models [46]. MLP has multi-layers and uses backpropagation
    algorithm for adjusting its parameters. The backpropagation algorithms find the
    proper values of parameters based on minimizing difference between observed and
    estimated data. In the current study, the optimization methods were chosen based
    on their novelty, which is classified among the new meta-heuristics methods that
    made a successful revolution in resolving engineering problems in the last decade
    [47,48,49,50]. In addition, the efficiency of powerful optimization algorithms
    such as RSO [51] was not assessed in the agriculture field, especially for crop
    coefficient prediction. In addition, the proposed algorithms of the RSO, BA, and
    FFA are not greedy algorithms. The individuals (rats, microbats, fireflies) move
    to the new position even if the new position is not better than its current position.
    Non-greedy algorithms can lead to a greater variety of solutions [52]. This study,
    as the first step of the authors'' research, will open a new path to show hybridizing
    optimization algorithms and machine learning methods for predictions appearing
    more potent than standalone machine learning models. 2.4.2 Rat swarm optimization
    (RSO) Rat swarm optimization (RSO) is a nature-inspired algorithm first proposed
    by Dhiman et al. [51]. RSO constructed based on the behaviors of attacking and
    chasing rats in nature. It used a simple conceptual mode, which makes it easy
    to implement. RSO can give the fittest solutions for challenging optimization
    problems based on the ‘trial-and-error’ criterion (Fig. 2). RSO depends on the
    behavior of chasing and fighting with prey. In the first step, the model assumes
    that the rats hunt the prey as a group with social agonistic behavior, and one
    of the rats (search agent) has the best knowledge of the position of target. The
    other rats can update their location according to the best search agent (first
    rat) obtained so far [51]. Chasing the prey formulation is given by: $$\\overrightarrow{P}=A
    . \\overrightarrow{{P}_{i}}\\left(x\\right)+C. (\\overrightarrow{{P}_{r}}\\left(x\\right)-\\overrightarrow{{P}_{i}}\\left(x\\right))$$
    (7) where \\(\\overrightarrow{{P}_{i}}\\left(x\\right)\\) is the rat position
    and \\(\\overrightarrow{{P}_{r}}\\left(x\\right)\\) is the best and optimal solution,
    where \\(x=\\mathrm{1,2},\\dots ,{\\mathrm{Max}}_{\\mathrm{iteration}}\\). Fig.
    2 Schematic diagram representing the general approaches of the developed method
    Full size image In addition, C and A are parameters calculated as follows: $$A=R-x
    \\times \\left[\\frac{R}{{\\mathrm{Max}}_{\\mathrm{Iteration}}}\\right]$$ (8)
    where C and R are random numbers responsible for best exploitation and exploration
    during the iterations process ranging [0, 2] and [1, 5], respectively [51]. In
    the next step, fighting with prey is given by the following mathematics formula:
    $${\\overrightarrow{P}}_{i}(x+1)=\\left|{\\overrightarrow{P}}_{r}(x)-\\overrightarrow{P}\\right|$$
    (9) where \\({\\overrightarrow{P}}_{i}\\left(x+1\\right)\\) defines the updated
    next position of the rat. It will record as optimal solution and updates the locations
    of other rats (search agents) according to the best search agent. 2.4.3 Bat algorithm
    (BA) BA can quickly arrive at a local optimum based on the premature convergence
    problem characteristic. The algorithm was first introduced by Yang [53]. BA concept
    is based on microbats echolocation, which uses solar-emitted waves. This process
    helps bats to find their prey and distinguish any form of obstacles that are facing
    in complete darkness (Fig. 2). According to the BA, the bats have a velocity flying
    Vi and position Xi; each Vi and Xi have a specific frequency (f) and loudness
    (ai) to get prey, where pulse emission r characterizes each frequency f [54].
    When the bat is close to the target, loudness decreases, and pulse increases.
    The mathematical equations of BA are given as follows: $${f}_{i}= {f}_{\\mathrm{min}}+\\left({f}_{\\mathrm{max}}-{f}_{\\mathrm{min}}\\right)\\upbeta$$
    (10) $${v}_{i}^{t}= {v}_{i}^{t-1}+\\left({x}_{i}^{t}-{x}_{*}\\right) {f}_{i}$$
    (11) where t is the max iteration (limit), \\(\\beta\\) is a random vector ranging
    between [0, 1], \\({f}_{\\mathrm{min}}\\) and \\({f}_{\\mathrm{max}}\\) are the
    maximum and minimum frequency for each bat, respectively, and \\(x\\) is the best
    solution (global) obtained by comparing the position of all the bats to the prey
    at each iteration. Before updating the positions of all bats, a new random number
    \\(\\beta\\) will be generated with respect to \\(\\beta\\) that must be less
    than pulse emission ri, $${x}_{new}= {x}_{old}+\\xi {A}^{t}$$ (12) where \\(\\xi\\)
    is a random number in the range of [-1, 1] and \\({A}^{t}\\) is the average amplitude
    of all bats at time t. 2.4.4 Firefly algorithm (FFA) In FFA, fireflies generate
    light to protect themselves from enemies, select their mates, and exchange information
    with them (Fig. 2). The first basic of the FFA is the attraction of flies that
    is based on their genders. To get the best results, all flies must be unisex.
    According to the light intensity, the flies will attract them (second rule). In
    the last rule, the brightness or the light intensity of the fireflies is decided
    [55,56,57]. The main task for developing FFA is calculating two factors of light
    intensity I(r), the attractiveness (β) as well as the distance between two fireflies
    of i and j (rij): $$I\\left(r\\right)={I}_{0}\\mathrm{exp}\\left(-\\gamma {r}^{2}\\right)$$
    (13) $$\\beta \\left(r\\right)={\\beta }_{0} \\mathrm{exp}\\left(-\\gamma {r}^{2}\\right)$$
    (14) $${r}_{ij}=\\Vert {x}_{i}-{x}_{j}\\Vert =\\sqrt{\\sum_{k=1}^{d}({x}_{i}^{k}-{x}_{j}^{k})}$$
    (15) where \\({x}_{i}^{k}\\) is the kth component of the spatial coordinate \\({x}_{i}\\)
    of the ith firefly, γ is the light absorption coefficient, r is the distance,
    k is a random number of the flies, and d is the dimensionality of a given problem,
    \\({I}_{0}\\) is the initial light intensity, \\({\\beta }_{0}\\) is the attractiveness
    at distance r = 0. The next movement of firefly i is given by the following equations:
    $${x}_{i}^{k}\\left(t+1\\right)={x}_{i}^{k}\\left(t\\right)+{\\beta }_{0}\\mathrm{exp}\\left(-{\\gamma
    r}_{ij}^{2}\\right)\\left({x}_{j}^{k}-{x}_{i}^{k}(t)\\right)+\\alpha {\\in }_{i}$$
    (16) where α is the randomization parameter in the range of (0, 1), and \\( {\\in
    }_{i}\\) is the random number vector derived from a Gaussian distribution. 2.5
    Gamma test for selecting the most influential input combination Selecting appropriate
    input variables for modeling is a challenging process, especially for nonlinear
    dynamic systems. For model development, it has been challenging to determine which
    inputs to use and how long the training data should be. Gamma test (GT) is a nonparametric
    and feature selection method that most used as a pre-processing procedure to determine
    a suitable input combination for nonlinear and complex models. The GT would reduce
    the workload for developing nonlinear models since the models would take an enormous
    number of trial-and-error iterations [58]. Ahmadi et al. [58] reported that conventional
    input selection model of AIC/BIC failed to recognize solar radiation functionality
    than the GT and entropy theory methods. Noori et al. [59] showed that the GT-ANN
    model could effectively reduce the number of input variables for predicting solid
    waste, while producing more effective results than ANN. The selected models with
    the least Vratio (close to zero) and gamma value (Γ) (close to zero) are considered
    better for the model [60]. The main steps of GT describe as follows: (1) For the
    input set of x and corresponding output data of y, the data sample considers as
    \\(\\left\\{{x}_{i}\\left(i\\right),\\dots ,{x}_{m}\\left(i\\right),{y}_{i}\\right\\}=\\left\\{\\left({x}_{i},{y}_{i}\\right)|1\\le
    i\\le M\\right\\}\\) with m input variables and M patterns. (2) The delta function
    calculates as \\({\\Delta }_{M}\\left(k\\right)=\\frac{1}{M}\\sum_{i=1}^{M}{\\left|{x}_{N[i,k]}-{x}_{i}\\right|}^{2}
    \\left(1\\le k\\le p\\right)\\), where |…| is the Euclidean distance and \\(N{\\left[i,k\\right]}_{1\\le
    k\\le p}\\) is the kth nearest neighbors for each \\({x}_{i}\\) vector. (3) The
    gamma function calculates as \\({\\gamma }_{M}\\left(k\\right)=\\frac{1}{2M}\\sum_{i=1}^{M}{\\left|{y}_{N[i,k]}-{y}_{i}\\right|}^{2}
    \\left(1\\le k\\le p\\right)\\), where \\({y}_{N[i,k]}\\) is corresponding yi
    value for the kth nearest neighbors of xi. (4) The gamma value of Γ calculates
    by drawing the least-square regression line of \\(\\gamma =A\\Delta +\\Gamma\\)
    for points of \\([{\\Delta }_{M}\\left(k\\right),{\\gamma }_{M}\\left(k\\right)]\\),
    where A is the least-square regression line slope. (5) The Vratio index calculates
    as \\({V}_{\\mathrm{rati}o}=\\frac{\\Gamma }{{\\sigma }^{2}(y)}\\), where \\({\\sigma
    }^{2}(y)\\) denotes the target outputs variance. The input meteorological variables
    of Tmax, Tmin, Tmean, RH, Rs, WS, SH, and VPD are used for constructing the input
    data matrix. With eight input variables, there are \\({2}^{N}-1={2}^{8}-1=255\\)
    meaningful input combinations, and also the \\(\\varGamma\\) values should be
    calculated for four studied locations (\\(255\\times 4=1020\\)). Calculating \\(\\varGamma\\)
    values for 255 input combinations and selecting the lowest \\(\\varGamma\\) need
    extra effort. Hence, the GT integrated with the RSO technique (GT-RSO) to automatically
    select the best input vector for each region. 2.6 Statistical performance metrics
    In order to evaluate the performance of each scenario, four criteria were used.
    The quantitative criteria were mean absolute error (MAE), percent bias (PBIAS),
    root-mean-square error (RMSE), and Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE). In addition,
    the time-series plot, scatter heat plot, and Taylor diagram were used for the
    graphical interpretation of the results. $$\\mathrm{MAE}=\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left|{K}_{c,\\mathrm{Obs}}-{K}_{c,\\mathrm{Sim}}\\right|,
    0<\\mathrm{MAE}<\\infty ,\\,\\,\\mathrm{ Optimal\\,\\,value}=0$$ (17) $$\\mathrm{PBIAS}=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left({K}_{c,\\mathrm{Obs}}-{K}_{c,\\mathrm{Sim}}\\right)}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left({K}_{c,\\mathrm{Obs}}\\right)},
    -\\infty <\\mathrm{RMSE}<\\infty ,\\mathrm{ Optimal \\,\\,value}=0$$ (18) $$\\mathrm{RMSE}=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{\\mathrm{i}=1}^{\\mathrm{N}}{\\left({K}_{\\mathrm{c},\\mathrm{Obs}}-{K}_{\\mathrm{c},\\mathrm{Sim}}\\right)}^{2}}{N}},
    0<\\mathrm{RMSE}<\\infty ,\\mathrm{ Optimal\\,\\,value}=0$$ (19) $$\\mathrm{NSE}=1-\\frac{\\sum_{\\mathrm{i}=1}^{\\mathrm{N}}{\\left({K}_{\\mathrm{c},\\mathrm{Obs}}-{K}_{\\mathrm{c},\\mathrm{Sim}}\\right)}^{2}}{\\sum_{\\mathrm{i}=1}^{\\mathrm{N}}{\\left({K}_{\\mathrm{c},\\mathrm{Obs}}-\\overline{{K
    }_{\\mathrm{c},\\mathrm{Obs}}}\\right)}^{2}}, -\\infty <\\mathrm{NSE}\\le 1,\\mathrm{
    Optimal\\,\\,value}=1$$ (20) where \\({K}_{c,\\mathrm{Obs}}\\) is the ith observed
    crop coefficient data, \\(\\overline{{K }_{c,\\mathrm{Obs}}}\\) is the mean of
    the observed crop coefficient data, \\({K}_{c,\\mathrm{Sim}}\\) is the ith simulated
    crop coefficient data, N is the total number of observations. 2.7 The framework
    of the study The GT-RSO selects random input combinations from Tmax, Tmin, Tmean,
    RH, Rs, WS, SH, and VPD variables and calculates the objective function of \\(\\varGamma\\).
    Finally, the GT-RSO model ranks the input combinations by minimizing an objective
    function using the outputs of the GT technique (Γ and Vratio). Four optimization
    algorithms of RSO, FFA, BA, and GA were used to robust train of MLP model. In
    previous studies, these algorithms were successfully used. The RSO has been suggested
    by Salgotra and Singh [61] to find optimal values of parameters of soft computing
    models. The BA was used by Milosevic et al. [62] to find the optimal weight connection
    values. Based on finding optimal values of ANN parameters, the BA could improve
    the accuracy of ANN models. Bui et al. [63] reported that FFA was capable of finding
    optimal ANN parameters. Tamilarasan et al. [64] recommended RSO to determine optimal
    hyperparameter values. The values of bias and weight connections for the MLP model
    were optimized using RSO, BA, FFA, and GAs with a random selection of agents and
    determined each individual’s position. The input vectors were trained using hybrid
    models. The initial values of the parameters were considered as the initial positions
    of individuals. The RMSE was used as an objective function to verify model accuracy
    and find optimal values of model parameters. The accuracy of developed hybrid
    models is sensitive to control parameter values of optimization algorithms [65].
    The random parameters of optimization algorithms are designed and determined using
    sensitivity analysis to enhance model performance. The sensitivity analysis is
    performed for accessing optimal values of optimization parameters. For this, the
    objective function of RMSE is calculated to select the final value. A smaller
    value of RMSE indicates that the value of the corresponding optimization parameter
    has a more important degree for improving the hybrid models. In this study, the
    decision variables were weight connections, bias values, number of hidden layers,
    and number of hidden neurons. For each of the decision variables, a population
    matrix is defined. The location of optimization agents shows the decision variables.
    The MLP parameters are encoded before starting the optimization process. The algorithm
    operators are used to update the location of agents. By updating the location
    of agents, the values of parameters are updated. The MLP parameters were decoded
    when the stop condition was met. The optimal number of hidden neurons and layers
    was determined using optimization algorithms and objective functions. As a result,
    the modeling process achieves the optimal network size so that its structure will
    not be too large. After constructing standalone and hybrid models of MLP, MLP-RSO,
    MLP-BA, MLP-FFA, and MLP-GA and estimating monthly Kc using simple available meteorological
    variables, the GLUE was investigated, and evaluation criteria were calculated.
    The best model was selected and the equations were constructed using those for
    all studied regions. Modeling was carried out using MATLAB software in this study.
    A detailed methodological framework is given in Fig. 2. 3 Results and discussion
    In this section, the accuracy of developed hybrid and standalone models is assessed
    as follows. 3.1 Input combination selection using hybrid GT-RSO Four top input
    combinations based on the hybrid GT-RSO method for each region are given in Table
    2. It is clear that Tmax, Tmin, Rs with the lowest \\(\\varGamma\\) and Vratio
    values are the best input combination in all studied regions. Low values of \\(\\varGamma\\)
    and Vratio (close to zero) demonstrate a high level of predictability of the Kc
    by a smooth model [66]. It is evident that these variables considerably influence
    the Kc prediction in all studied regions. The variable of air temperature is considered
    the main and essential meteorological parameter of Kc prediction. The results
    of this study are in agreement with Elbeltagi et al. [30] that presented Tmin,
    Tmax, and Rs are the best input combination to predict Kc. In the next rank, Tmean,
    RH are an accurate alternative for Kc prediction in the Al-Ismailiyah and Ash
    sharkiyah regions, especially when there were no Rs data for several months. Also,
    in the Al-Gharbiyah, the meteorological variable of WS is an alternative for Rs.
    The variables of RH and WS can be easily measured in any region. Table 2 The best
    input combinations in studied regions Full size table 3.2 Identifying the optimization
    parameters There are four parameters in the RSO, FFA, and GA models that need
    to be optimized. In the BA optimization algorithm, six parameters should be optimized.
    Four different values of each optimization parameter are evaluated using sensitivity
    analysis. To assess the effect of each optimization parameter on the RMSE, optimizations
    are performed by varying one random parameter relative to other constant parameters
    [67]. The optimization results for the RSO algorithm are shown in Table 3, and
    the best results are recognized when the objective function of RMSE is minimized.
    For the RSO, FFA, and GA, four values of population size parameters are set as
    150, 300, 450, and 600. For the RSO, the population size of 300 produces better
    results for all studied regions than the other values, where the objective function
    of RMSE is obtained equal to 0.110, 0.115, 0.112, and 0.116 in Al-Gharbiyah, Ad
    Dakahliyah, Al-Ismailiyah, and Ash sharkiyah regions, respectively. The optimal
    random parameters of R, C, and the maximum number of iterations for the RSO algorithm
    are presented in Table 3. Consequently, the results of sensitivity analysis for
    determining the optimal value of random parameters of BA, FFA, and GA optimization
    are shown in Tables 4, 5, and 6, respectively. Table 7 displays the properties
    of the model setting for developed standalone and hybrid MLP. All models were
    constructed using one hidden layer, and the tangent sigmoid was used as an activation
    function. The MLP-RSO was trained with the highest hidden neurons (equal to 5)
    than other applied models. Table 3 The sensitivity analysis of random parameters

    best version of MLP models Full size table 3.3 Comparison of developed models
    As mentioned above, the input combination of Tmax, Tmin, Rs was used to predict
    Kc using the standalone MLP model and developed hybrid models by RSO, BA, FFA,
    and GAs. The performance results of developed models for predicting Kc in training
    and testing phases are given in Tables 8 and 9, respectively. It is evident from
    Table 8 that the MLP-RSO provides adequate precision for training over all other
    models due to low error criteria (RMSE, MAE, and PBIAS) and high NSE metric. In
    the testing phase, the MLP-RSO has the most accurate performance, locating a perfect
    range based on the NSE and PBIAS criteria. Based on the average PBIAS criteria
    in all studied locations, the Kc were underestimated using MLP-RSO (12%) and MLP
    (23%) models. The prediction error of MLP-RSO based on the RMSE (MAE) was obtained
    equal to 0.119 (0.1), 0.121 (0.11), 0.119 (0.117), and 0.119 (0.115) against those
    for MLP model equal to 0.278 (0.256), 0.276 (0.224), 0.221 (0.202), and 0.235
    (0.224) in Al-Gharbiyah, Ad Dakahliyah, Al-Ismailiyah, and Ash sharkiyah, respectively.
    Table 8 The performance comparison of different developed models in the training
    phase for the best input vector in each region Full size table Table 9 The performance
    comparison of different developed models in the testing phase for the best input
    vector in each region Full size table To evaluate the performance of the MLP-RSO
    model over other hybrid models, the percentage of improvement in predictions has
    been calculated. The RSO algorithm improved the performance of MLP more than the
    other meta-heuristic optimization algorithms. The RMSE metric of MLP-BA, MLP-FFA,
    and MLP-GA models increased in all regions by 11.2–16.6%, 37–43.9%, and 40.2–55.4%,
    respectively. The most improvement is obtained for MLP-RSO compared with MLP-BA,
    MLP-FFA, and MLP-GA by an increase of 3.4–18%, 32.8%- 40.1%, and 40.1%- 57.4%
    in MAE in four regions, respectively. It is clear that hybrid models performed
    better than the standalone MLP model in all regions. In comparison with MLP-RSO,
    the RMSE of the MLP model increased 58.5%, 56.2%, 46.2%, and 49.4% in Al-Gharbiyah,
    Ad Dakahliyah, Al-Ismailiyah, and Ash sharkiyah regions, respectively. Similar
    results are acquired in comparing MLP to the other hybrid MLP-BA, MLP-FFA, and
    MLP-GA models. The PBIAS of MLP-BA is increased by 12.5%-44% than the MLP-RSO
    model, and the NSE is reduced. Similarly, the accuracy of the hybrid MLP-RSO model
    considering PBIAS and NSE was higher than the other hybrid and standalone models.
    The Taylor diagram is plotted for evaluating developed hybrid and standalone models
    against the reference point (observed values). This diagram provides a graphical
    display of the location of developed models in prediction Kc against the actual
    Kc by considering the values of correlation coefficient (R), standard deviation
    (STD), and root-mean-square deviation (RMSD). In the Taylor diagram, the yellow
    radial lines show the R values, the red circular arcs indicate the STD, and the
    dash blue circular arcs show the RMSD values. The closer location of each developed
    model to that of the specific reference point represents the better efficiency
    of that model. According to Fig. 3, all models have almost similar and high accuracy
    in predicting Kc in the studied regions. However, the hybrid models are more successful
    than the standalone MLP model. The predictions were located between R lines of
    0.98 and 1, STD lines of 0.35 and 0.36, and RMSD lines of 0.005 and 0.1 for the
    Al-Gharbiyah. Also, the Kc predictions were grouped within the 0.98 and 1 of R
    lines, 0.34 and 0.35 of STD lines, 0.03 and 0.06 of RMSD lines at Ad Dakahliyah,
    within the 0.98 and 1 of R lines, 0.34 and 0.36 of STD lines, 0.03 and 0.07 of
    RMSD lines et al.-Ismailiyah, and within the 0.96 and 1 of R lines, 0.34 and 0.36
    of STD lines, 0.01 and 0.1 of RMSD lines at Ash sharkiyah. Among developed hybrid
    models, the results for the location of the MLP-RSO and MLP-BA with R > 0.99,
    RMSD < 0.05, and 0.34 < STD < 0.36 are close to the reference points of all regions.
    The hybrid model of MLP-RSO makes some improvement in the accuracy of standalone
    MLP for predicting Kc. Fig. 3 The Taylor diagrams of developed models for prediction
    of Kc in the studied regions Full size image For better visualization of the prediction
    performance of developed models, the trends of Kc for the year 2012 are given
    in Fig. 4. It can be observed from Fig. 4 that the MLP-RSO model included the
    actual growth status of the crop for modeling Kc. Hence the accuracy of the MLP-RSO
    predictions is higher than the other hybrid models in all regions. Compared with
    the MLP-RSO, the performances of MLP-FFA, MLP-BA, MLP-GA, and MLP models for predicting
    Kc trend are slightly low. Overall, the fitting accuracy of MLP-RSO model can
    be considered for the precision prediction of Kc. This model took into account
    the dynamic change of crop coefficient in the studied area. In the case of Kc,
    the values vary based on the crop development stages and climate conditions [68].
    So, this study confirms the capability of the hybrid MLP-RSO model for improved
    prediction of Kc. The model recognizes nonlinear and complex relationships between
    meteorological variables as input and Kc as output. In addition, the MLP-RSO model
    gives less restrictive functional forms assumptions for modeling the Kc process
    [3, 62]. Fig. 4 Compare predictive models and actual Kc values for studied regions
    in 2012 Full size image However, the results of Farg et al. [4] showed that the
    prediction of Kc by remote sensing can provide accurate values, but the performances
    were lower than developed models in the current study. Also, the comparison of
    the results of the current study against the results of Pôças et al. [20] showed
    a higher accuracy of the hybrid MLP-RSO model. In agreement with the results of
    the present study, Elbeltagi et al. [30] predicted accurate values of Kc by the
    ANN model, where the performance of the best ANN model based on the R2 was close
    to 1. Pereira et al. [70] and Pereira et al. [71] estimated Kc from the crop height
    and fraction of ground cover parameters for different trees, vine crops, vegetables,
    field crops, and grassland. The results showed good agreement between A&P [72]
    predictions with those values obtained from field measurements and remote sensing
    data. However, those results were not better than the MLP-RSO model performance
    obtained in the current study. In addition, prediction Kc using meteorological
    variables that can be measured easily in any studied location and region is more
    applicable than those models that use leaf area index (LAI) and crop height variables.
    Similarly, Mobe et al. [73] evaluated the A&P approach for estimating Kc using
    several measured variables, including transpiration, evapotranspiration, soil
    attributes, weather, and tree physiological in 12 apple orchards located in the
    Western Cape Province of South Africa. The results showed that the original A&P
    approach significantly overestimated the basal crop coefficients. The prediction
    performance was enhanced by defining the canopy resistance factor in the A&P method.
    After selecting the best model to predict Kc, the scatter density diagrams as
    an innovation-colored scatter are plotted between the measured and predicted Kc
    for the MLP-RSO model in all regions (Fig. 5). This scatter diagram is colored
    by a normalized density spectrum and used to determine over-estimation and under-estimation
    [74]. From Fig. 5, the high correlation between the monthly predicted and actual
    Kc is obvious in four studied regions by the hybrid MLP-RSO model. Fig. 5 Density
    scatter diagram and linear regression between actual Kc and estimated by hybrid
    MLP-RSO model in different regions Full size image The ‘hot spots’ of the Kc are
    more concentrated between 0.5 and 0.8 in the Al-Gharbiyah, 0.5 and 0.6 in the
    Ad Dakahliyah, and 0.5 and 0.9 in the Al-Ismailiyah. In the Ash sharkiyah, the
    ‘hot spots’ are concentrated in two positions between 0.35 to 0.6 and 0.9 to 1.1.
    Regarding Fig. 5, the predicted Kc by the MLP-RSO model follows the actual Kc
    with many small disagreements at high values of Kc (more than 1). However, many
    predicated Kc data display a good correlation with actual data and conflicts are
    not substantial at higher ranges. The color spectrum shows that the hybrid MLP-RSO
    model is slightly under-predicting the monthly Kc data in the Al-Gharbiyah, while
    data are slightly over-predicting in the Ad Dakahliyah and Ash sharkiyah regions.
    In the Al-Ismailiyah, the color spectrum suggests over-predicting at high values
    of Kc and under-predicting at low values. In Al-Gharbiyah, the color spectrum
    is more uniformly distributed around the data than in other regions, suggesting
    a precise correlation between predicted and actual Kc. 3.4 Uncertainty analysis
    of models using GLUE The GLUE framework is used to quantify input and models’
    parameters uncertainty. The parameters distribution and statistical characteristics
    of the hybrid and standalone models are driven by 3000 number of simulations runs.
    The simulations were generated randomly with GLUE to obtain the impact of input
    and model structure uncertainties on model output. Figure 6 shows the values of
    p and r to investigate models’ uncertainty in four regions. As it is shown in
    Fig. 6, the highest p values related to input uncertainty and model structure
    uncertainty belong to the MLP-RSO in all regions, while the MLP and MLP-GA have
    the smallest values of p. Therefore, regarding the p values, the MLP-RSO has the
    most bracketed actual Kc data in all regions. The 95% confidence interval (95%
    CI) was obtained at 2.5% and 97.5% of the accumulative distribution from input
    parameters and model structure. As expected, the 95% CI of the MLP-RSO covers
    94%, 95%, 93%, and 96% of actual Kc for input parameters uncertainty, while it
    covers 91%, 89%, 92%, and 94% of actual Kc for model structure uncertainty in
    Al-Gharbiyah, Ad Dakahliyah, Al-Ismailiyah, and Ash sharkiyah regions, respectively.
    The average p value obtained from both input parameters uncertainty and model
    structure uncertainty for the MLP-RSO model was almost 5.7%, 13.6%, 6.9%, and
    10.4% more than the MLP model in Al-Gharbiyah, Ad Dakahliyah, Al-Ismailiyah, and
    Ash sharkiyah regions, respectively. So, it is evident from the results that hybrid
    models (especially MLP-RSO) have a high capability to bracket more actual Kc data.
    Hence, the prediction stability of the MLP-RSO model is guaranteed based on the
    evaluation criteria and uncertainty analysis. Also, the calculated r values for
    input parameters and model structure uncertainties reveal the superiority of the
    hybrid MLP-RSO model over the other models. As shown in Fig. 6, the 95PPU region
    from the MLP-RSO is narrower than other applied models for both conditions of
    model structure and input parameters. The corresponding r values related to the
    model structure (input parameter) of the MLP-RSO were calculated equal to 0.15
    (0.12), 0.16 (0.14), 0.17 (0.12), and 0.15 (0.12) for Al-Gharbiyah, Ad Dakahliyah,
    Al-Ismailiyah, and Ash sharkiyah, respectively. The r values of the MLP-RSO model
    for input parameters and model structure were 50% and 44.4% in the Al-Gharbiyah,
    41.7% and 33.3% in the Ad Dakahliyah, 42.8% and 22.7% in the Al-Ismailiyah, and
    42.8% and 40% in the Ash sharkiyah lower than those for MLP model, respectively.
    The results of the r and p values demonstrate that the hybridizing meta-heuristic
    optimization algorithm with machine learning methods can improve the actual Kc
    predictions in Nile Delta, Egypt, where hybrid models achieve high stability compared
    to traditional models. Also, the high ability of hybrid models for finding an
    optimal global solution is proved in the case of Kc prediction. The r and p results
    showed that the Kc predictions are more sensitive to the model structure than
    input parameters due to higher values of p and lower values of r for input parameters
    for all models. In other words, the selection of model parameters affects Kc prediction
    more than inputs. The uncertainty that origin from model parameters is higher
    than those from inputs. Thus, the results indicate that developing a robust model
    with the highest accuracy and slightest uncertainty is difficult and complicate.
    Fig. 6 Uncertainty analysis of developed models based on the p and r parameters
    for the best input vector Full size image The prediction uncertainty of the Kc,
    including input uncertainty and model parameters uncertainty, along with the best
    estimation by MLP-RSO is shown in Figs. 7, 8, 9, and 10 for four studied regions.
    It is clear that the uncertainty regions cover most Kc data in three stages of
    initial, mid-season, and late season. But many upper bounds are located beyond
    the Kc data line, and the MLP-RSO has a small limitation to bracket high Kc data
    in all regions. Fig. 7 a Input uncertainty (p:0.94, r:0.12) and b parameter uncertainty

    r:0.12) and b parameter uncertainty (p:0.94, r:0.15) for the MLP-RSO model at
    the Ash sharkiyah Full size image 3.5 Region-based explicit equations for Kc Derivation
    of a simple equation to quantify the Kc using readily accessible meteorological
    variables under different regions will be of extensive benefit for agriculture
    and research. Therefore, developing explicit equations of Kc for four studied
    regions as a function of meteorological variables is considered as a major contribution
    for the current study. The black-box form of the standalone MLP model is complicated.
    Hence, the optimized weights in the MLP-RSO structures were used to find an explicit
    equation. By obtaining optimized weights and biases and by applying the tangent-sigmoid
    transfer function for the hybrid MLP-RSO model, the Kc equation of maize is provided
    for each studied region in Nile Delta, Egypt. The algebraic form of the MLP-RSO
    for estimating Kc based on the best input combination is written: (a) Al-Gharbiyah

    The above-proposed equations are explicit forms of optimized black-box MLP model
    that are applicable to each region in this study. Also, these equations are valid
    for the Kc dataset with ranges between the minimum and maximum values similar
    to the dataset in this study. Ayars et al. [75] extended a linear relationship
    between Kc and noon intercepted solar radiation, but Girona et al. [76] presented
    that confirming and applying this relationship is difficult due to the heterogeneity
    of the canopy. Marsal et al. [77] reported that CropSyst can improve Kc prediction
    for apple trees when considering changes in canopy shape and porosity. Also, the
    normalization formula can be used to alter the structure of a database. The purpose
    of the normalization is to remove redundant data from a database and to store
    data that are nonredundant. By normalization, unused data are removed from the
    database, and redundancy and inconsistency are reduced. Data are normalized when
    they are scaled between 0 and 1. The formula for normalization is: $${X}_{\\mathrm{normalized
    }}= \\frac{X-{X}_{\\mathrm{min}}}{{X}_{\\mathrm{max}}-{X}_{\\mathrm{min}}}$$ (21)
    where X is the observed value, Xmin is the minimum value of data, and Xmax is
    the maximum value of data. 4 Conclusion Crop coefficient (Kc) is an important
    and critical component in calculating crop evapotranspiration that is an essential
    factor for irrigation planning, water management, and water saving in agriculture.
    In this research, hybrid models were developed using machine learning approach
    and meta-heuristics optimization algorithms. The hybrid MLP-RSO, MLP-FFA, MLP-BA,
    and MLP-GA models were assessed to predict the monthly crop coefficient (Kc) of
    maize and to derive an explicit predictive equation in four regions in Nile Delta,
    Egypt. Since selecting the best input combination is complex, a novel hybrid gamma
    test (GT)-RSO was applied to automatically identify the optimal input combination
    from monthly meteorological variables of Tmax, Tmin, Tmean, RH, Rs, WS, SH, and
    VPD. Also, the uncertainties related to model structure and input parameters in
    the Kc prediction were quantified using the GLUE approach. The main results of
    this research are summarized in the following points: The results indicated the
    effectiveness of the hybrid GT-RSO as a robust method for identifying the best
    input combination. The lowest values of \\(\\varGamma\\) were obtained using Tmax,
    Tmin, and Rs input combination in all studied regions. The optimal values of optimization
    algorithms parameters were obtained by a sensitivity analysis that had a high
    potential to produce more accurate predictive results without great effort in
    finding random parameters. The results of the evaluation criteria and the Taylor
    diagram illustrated the superiority of the hybrid MLP-RSO model in predicting
    Kc over the other hybrid and standalone models. The standalone MLP model was the
    least performing model, although it provided reasonably accurate Kc prediction.
    The MLP-RSO model decreased the average RMSE by 13.87%, 39.95%, 45.68%, and 53.09%
    than MLP-BA, MLP-FFA, MLP-GA, and MLP models, respectively. The density scatter
    diagram showed a large number of Kc data were predicted using the MLP-RSO model
    by robust correlation with the actual Kc data, indicating low error density. From
    an uncertainty viewpoint, by considering both model structure and input parameters,
    the results showed the advantage of using the MLP-RSO model in the current study.
    The MLO-RSO model showed high accuracy and had the best coverage of actual data
    (p factor) with reasonably narrow uncertainty bound (r factor). The uncertainty
    results confirmed some instability in the Kc prediction by the standalone model
    to find a global solution. Four explicit equations were derived by hybrid MLP-RSO
    model for Kc predicting using the most effective meteorological variables of Tmin,
    Tmax, and Rs. The derivation equation was considered as a major contribution of
    this study in agriculture science. The proposed derived equations could potentially
    provide reliability and applicability technique to compute Kc of maize in the
    Nile Delta and in different crop development stages with less computationally
    efforts. However, it is worth noting that the selection of the methodology from
    MLP-RSO represents a possible solution path to make a comparative study for Kc
    predicting based on other techniques such as random forest and XGBoost. Also,
    the feature selection based on the feature importance (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
    would be an interesting comparison. It is desired to carry out further research
    to make similar efforts for assessing other uncertainty analysis methods. 5 Appendix

  description: The soil water content at the condition of field capacity (θFC) is
    a key parameter in irrigation scheduling and has been suggested to be determined
    by running a synthetic drainage experiment until the flux rate (q) at the bottom
    of the soil profile achieves a predefined negligible value (qFC). We question
    the impact of qFC on the assessment of field capacity. Moreover, calculating θFC
    as the integral mean of the water content profile when q is equal to qFC is strictly
    valid only for uniform soil profiles. By contrast, this practice is ambiguous
    and biased for stratified soil profiles due to the soil water content discontinuity
    at the layer interfaces. In this study, the concept of field capacity was revisited

    of root-zone water storage capacity (W), we envision field capacity as a functional

    minimize drought stress, drainage, and nitrate leachate below the root zone. A
    functional analysis was carried out on a 135-cm-thick layered soil profile beneath
    maize in eastern Nebraska. On-farm irrigation scheduling applications and agricultural
    practices were recorded for 20 years (2001–2020) at a daily time step. Hydrus-1D
    was calibrated and validated with direct measurements of the soil water retention
    curve and soil water content data, respectively, in each soil layer. A set of
    functional field capacity values was derived from 24 irrigation scheduling scenarios,
    and the optimal water storage capacity at field capacity (WFC) was approximately
    50 cm (corresponding to about 80% saturation in the soil profile). An average
    irrigation amount of 217.5 mm distributed over 21 events was obtained by using
    optimal irrigation scheduling, which was initiated when the matric pressure head
    took on a value of −700 cm and the irrigation rate was set at 1.0 cm d−1. This
    irrigation practice ensured water storage at approximately the same level (ideally
    at WFC) by sustaining only evapotranspiration fluxes in the uppermost portion
    of the root zone and by limiting excessive drainage. This protocol can be transferred
    to other agricultural fields.

    The active rooting zone of a soil profile acts, from a functional viewpoint, as
    a reservoir that stores incoming water from precipitation or irrigation events
    and makes it available for crop use over longer periods of water shortage (Romano
    and Santini, 2002). Therefore, soil provides a critical interplay between crop
    and atmospheric demand since soil water storage supplies potential root water
    uptake (RWU), which is reduced under water stress conditions. In agricultural
    fields, drought stress is mitigated by irrigation applications to keep RWU at
    its potential level during the crop growing season. From an operational viewpoint,
    the main challenge is to set the irrigation schedule and the optimal water amount
    to improve the design of irrigation-based water management strategies. A widely-used
    global indicator for governing irrigation scheduling is the root zone soil water
    storage capacity available for plant use, or simply, plant available water capacity
    (PAWC), representing the maximum amount of soil water that can be stored in a
    soil profile to sustain optimal crop growth and yield. A pragmatic but very simplistic
    way to determine PAWC is to compute the difference between the water storage capacity
    at field capacity (WFC) and the permanent wilting point (WWP). Commonly, PAWC
    is expressed as the difference between the soil water content values at field
    capacity (θFC) and permanent wilting point (θWP), multiplied by the thickness
    of the root zone (zr), i.e., PAWC= (θFC – θWP)× zr (Allen et al., 1998). When
    the profile-average soil water content in the rooting zone is less than the wilting
    point θWP, then it is commonly assumed that the plant wilts permanently. Although
    the condition of permanent wilting depends not merely on soil type but especially
    on plant species (Thomasson, 1995, Garg et al., 2020, Wiecheteck et al., 2020,
    Torres et al., 2021), a common value for θWP is the soil water content at the
    matric pressure of − 1.5 MPa (i.e., a matric head of −15,296 cm of water), based
    on data from sunflowers used as a reference plant species (Taylor and Ashcroft,
    1972). Field capacity is defined as “the volumetric water content remaining in
    a soil profile two or three days after having been completely wetted with water
    and after free drainage beyond the root zone has become negligible” (Veihmeyer
    and Hendrickson, 1949; Soil Science Society of America, 2008). The field drainage
    experiment is considered a benchmark method for determining θFC, which is certainly
    not exempt from criticism and appears a bit vague (Romano and Santini, 2002, Assouline
    and Or, 2014, de Jong van Lier and Wendroth, 2016). The tacit assumption is that
    the soil profile is uniform, initially fully saturated, and subject only to gravity-driven
    drainage, regardless of the evapotranspiration flux which is assumed as zero.
    Even though definitions exist for θFC (or WFC) and θWP (or WWP), the concepts
    underlying these variables and their physical meanings are still a matter of debate
    (Gardner, 1965, Ritchie, 1981, Minasny and McBratney, 2003, Garg et al., 2020;
    Torres et al., 2021; Turek et al., 2022; Cousin et al., 2022). In-situ drainage
    experiments are notoriously cumbersome, although representative of actual field
    conditions, and the condition of field capacity is attained when the drainage
    flux at the lower boundary of the soil profile is virtually null (Romano and Santini,
    2002). Synthetic drainage experiments can be used when the soil hydraulic properties
    are known beforehand, and the zero flux and the unit (or, fixed) total hydraulic
    gradient are set as the upper and lower boundaries of the flow domain, respectively.
    The θFC value is computed when the water flux (q) at the bottom of the flow domain
    is equal to a predefined negligible drainage flux (qFC) (Twarakavi et al., 2009,
    Assouline and Or, 2014, Reynolds, 2018; Inforsato and de Jong van Lier, 2021).
    When this condition is attained, the simulated profile-average soil water content
    is often referred to as the flux-based field capacity (Meyer and Gee, 1999, Nasta
    and Romano, 2016; Inforsato and de Jong van Lier, 2021). Choosing a negligible
    value for qFC is obviously arbitrary, but another limitation arises when the synthetic
    drainage process is simulated in a layered (heterogeneous) soil profile, which
    exhibits contrasting vertical textural properties and hydraulic characteristics.
    When using field capacity as a hydraulic parameter in a bucket-type hydrological
    model, the soil component of the system is often conceptualized as a uniform (homogeneous)
    flow domain, and this oversimplification can be considered acceptable if one is
    interested in computing the lumped water budget (Romano et al., 2011). However,
    when the concept of PAWC is used to resolve agronomic problems, water dynamics
    in layered soil profiles should be properly characterized by using a process-oriented
    hydrological model based on the Richards equation. Under these circumstances,
    the determination of θFC as a profile average value is not trivial and is rather
    weak as well, so it becomes convenient to resort to the assessment of WFC (Nasta
    and Romano, 2016). Irrigated agriculture in the High Plains Region of the United
    States mostly relies on aquifer depletion, especially for maize production, as
    this crop has high irrigation requirements to achieve maximum yield. The average
    groundwater levels have declined significantly in the Southern and Central High
    Plains (i.e., Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas) and parts of Nebraska (Scanlon et al.,
    2012). Over the last decades, excessive groundwater depletion has been exacerbated
    by frequent droughts induced by climate change (Rudnick et al., 2019). Overapplication
    of nitrogen fertilizers and pesticides is the primary source of groundwater contamination,
    which further decreases the amount of water available for irrigation. The challenge
    of irrigated agriculture is to identify a functional value for soil water storage
    at field capacity by preserving optimal root-zone water contents so to avoid,
    or at least minimize, the onset of drought stress and excessive drainage (and
    related contaminant transport towards the aquifer). In this study, Hydrus-1D was
    used to simulate water flow and solute transport across a 135-cm-thick agronomic
    layered soil profile beneath irrigated maize in eastern Nebraska (Šimůnek et al.,
    2016). In Hydrus-1D, irrigation timing is controlled by a depth-specific user-specified
    soil pressure head while the irrigation rate is set at prescribed values (Lena
    et al., 2022). Therefore, the target of this synthetic approach was to perform
    a sensitivity analysis using different values of the user-specified irrigation
    rate for maize and soil matric pressure head at a soil depth of 67.5 cm (half
    of maize’s maximum root depth). A total of 24 values for water storage capacity
    at field capacity (WFC) were estimated, and the optimal value was selected to
    minimize drought stress, drainage flux (to avoid local water waste), and nitrate
    leachate (to reduce contaminant vulnerability) below the root zone. The “functional”
    field capacity has been compared with the conventional synthetic drainage experiment,
    and the challenge of estimating θFC is discussed. 2. Experimental work and methods
    2.1. Environmental settings and data collection The study site is in eastern Nebraska,
    USA, at the University of Nebraska Eastern Nebraska Research and Extension Center
    (ENREC) near Mead. The field site (US-Ne1, 41.1651 N, −96.4779 W; Fig. 1) is part
    of the AmeriFlux (Baldocchi et al., 2001) and Long-Term Agricultural Research
    Networks and has been operating since 2001. The regional climate is of a continental
    semiarid type with a mean annual precipitation of 784 mm yr−1 (according to the
    AmeriFlux US-Ne1 website). According to the Web Soil Survey data (http://websoilsurvey.nrcs.usda.gov/),
    the soils at the site are comprised mostly of silt loam and silty clay loam. Download

    soil profile with four layers (0–18, 18–38, 38–75, 75–135 cm); root depth (zr)
    changes over time during the growing season, and the maximum root depth is 135 cm;
    c) in-situ measurements of leaf area index (LAI) at the specified day of the year
    (DOY) (gray line) in each year and daily-mean LAI used for missing years (red
    line); the vertical dashed lines distinguish between vegetative (VGS) and reproductive
    (RGS) growth stages for maize. Maize (Zea mays L.) has been grown at the site
    under overhead sprinkler irrigation, with the growing season beginning in early
    May and ending in October (Kalfas et al., 2011). Since 2001, crop management practices
    (i.e., planting density, cultivars, irrigation, and herbicide and pesticide applications)
    have been applied according to standard management practices prescribed for production-scale
    maize systems (Suyker and Verma, 2008). More detailed information about site conditions
    can be found in Suyker et al. (2004) and Verma et al. (2005). Destructive measurements
    of the leaf area index (LAI) were carried out approximately every two weeks during
    the growing season from 2003 to 2020 at specific days of the year (DOY) (Fig.
    1c), together with other plant characteristics such as height (cm) and dry above-ground
    biomass (kg ha−1). After planting (typically the last week of April to the first
    week of May), the vegetative stage includes plant emergence and tasseling between
    the second half of April (DOY = 110) and the first half of July (DOY = 200) while
    the reproductive stage includes silking, blister, milk, dough, dent, and maturity
    between the first half of July (DOY = 200) and last week of September (DOY = 275).
    The maximum root depth was 135 cm; therefore, we considered a 135-cm-thick soil
    profile. Soil layers are predominantly classified as Ap, Bt1, Bt2, and BC (Soil
    Survey Division Staff, 2017). Consequently, four soil layers were established
    with thicknesses of 0–18 cm, 18–38 cm, 38–75 cm, and 75–135 cm, centered on the
    sampling depths of 10 cm, 25 cm, 50 cm, and 100 cm, respectively (see Fig. 1b).
    Soil samples were collected to determine seven soil water retention data pairs,
    namely the soil water contents at the prescribed pressures of 0 cm, 339.9 cm,
    1019.7 cm, 2039.5 cm, 3059.2 cm, 4078.9 cm, and 15,296.1 cm in the pressure plate
    apparatus (Dane and Hopmans, 2002). The soil samples were dried in the oven for
    at least 24 h at the standard temperature of 105 °C to measure the oven-dry soil
    bulk density (ρb, in g cm3). The soil texture was predominantly classified as
    silty clay. ThetaProbes (Delta-T Devices, Cambridge, UK) were installed at four
    locations in the study field with measurement depths of 10, 25, 50, and 100 cm
    to monitor hourly soil water content in the root zone (Suyker and Verma, 2008).
    A flux tower station (Ameriflux and LTAR networks) is located at the same site
    as the experiment. Hourly/daily values of rainfall (R), minimum, mean, and maximum
    air temperatures, air relative humidity, wind speed, and net solar radiation are
    available from 1 January 2001–31 December 2020 (a total of 7305 days corresponding
    to a 20-year long time series). Daily values of grass-reference potential evapotranspiration
    (ET0) were calculated using the physically-based method of Penman-Monteith (Allen
    et al., 1998). Assuming a uniform land cover of maize (Zea mays L.), crop-specific
    potential evapotranspiration (ETc) under standard conditions and without water
    limitations was calculated by multiplying ET0 by the specific crop (maize) coefficient,
    Kc (i.e., ETc = ET0 × Kc). The LAI was used to partition ETc into potential evaporation
    (Ep) and potential transpiration (Tp) using the following equation: (1) Potential
    transpiration, Tp (corresponding to potential root water uptake), was obtained
    by subtracting potential evaporation (Eq. (1)) from ETc. The crop coefficient
    (Kc ranging between 0.20 and 1.06), and the root depth (zr ranging between 0 cm
    and 135 cm) were time-variable and were modeled according to the protocol given
    in Nasta and Gates (2013) and Nasta et al. (2021). Rainfall interception (IR)
    was calculated using the following formula: (2) where a (cm d−1) was assumed equal
    to 0.025 cm d−1 and b= 1-e−0.463LAI. Interception was subtracted from R to obtain
    net rainfall (Rnet). Descriptive statistics of annual mean sums of the aforementioned
    weather components are reported in Table 2. In eastern Nebraska, the 100-day-long
    irrigation season ranges from mid-June (mid-vegetative growth stage) to mid-September
    (end of reproductive growth stage). Producers usually start irrigating when soil
    water storage is at the minimum allowable balance in the active root zone (i.e.,
    at the lowest tolerated water storage before the stress begins), which is assumed
    to be 50% of field capacity, and when no significant rainfall (greater than about
    12.7 mm) is expected in the following two-three days. The irrigation amount is
    given by the difference between water storage at field capacity and the minimum
    allowable balance over the active root zone and is further subjected to the mechanical
    system (i.e., well capacity, pumping-curve, field size, and nozzle package). Producers
    supplied irrigation totals with a mean value of 290 mm to mitigate crop stress.
    Fertilizer nutrient requirements for maize are based on expected yield and soil
    nutrient availability. Nitrogen (N) was mostly applied as urea, (NH2)2CO, and
    ammonia, NH3. Heterotrophic bacteria hydrolyze urea to form ammonium (NH4+), which
    is sequentially nitrified by autotrophic bacteria to nitrite (NO2-) and nitrate
    (NO3-). The following three solute species are considered in this study: (NH2)2CO
    → NH4+ → NO3-. Given the recorded fertilizer applications, we assumed an annual
    average fertilization amount and timing of 195 kg N ha−1 applied on April 1. 2.2.
    Simulation of water flow and solute transport in Hydrus-1D Water flow was simulated
    by numerically solving the Richards equation (Richards, 1931) through the one-dimensional
    layered soil profile: (3) where t is time, expressed in units of days (d), ψ is
    the matric pressure head (cm), z (cm) is the vertical axis (positive upward from
    the soil surface), θ (cm3 cm−3) is the volumetric soil water content, and ξ (z,
    ψ, Tp) is the sink term (d−1) describing the actual plant RWU rate function depending
    on z, ψ, and potential transpiration (Tp). The flow domain consisted of a heterogeneous
    (four soil layers) 135-cm-thick soil profile, discretized in 200 nodes with a
    denser discretization near the soil surface. Hydrus-1D numerically solves the
    partial-differential equation (Eq. (3)) by using a finite element scheme for spatial
    discretization and a finite difference scheme for time discretization. The soil
    water retention, θ(ψ), and hydraulic conductivity, K(Se), functions (the so-called
    soil hydraulic properties) in each soil layer are described by van Genuchten’s
    equations (van Genuchten, 1980): (4) (5) where θs (cm3 cm−3) and θr (cm3 cm−3)
    are the saturated and residual volumetric soil water contents, α (cm−1), n (-)
    and m = 1–1/n (Mualem restriction) are empirical curve-fitting shape parameters,
    Ks (cm d−1) is the saturated hydraulic conductivity, and τ (-) is a tortuosity
    parameter that is assumed to be τ = 0.5 (Mualem, 1976). The degree of saturation,
    Se, varies between 0 (when θ = θr) and 1 (when θ = θs). Hydrus-1D considers the
    fate and transport of multiple solutes subjected to first-order degradation reactions.
    Urea, (NH2)2CO, degrades to ammonium, NH4+, which is subsequently transformed
    into nitrate, NO3-, by the process of nitrification. NO3- is then subject to denitrification.
    The partial differential equations governing the one-dimensional transport of
    N involved in sequential first-order decay chain reactions during transient water
    flow in a variably saturated rigid porous medium are taken as: (6) (7) (8) where
    C is the solute concentration in the liquid phase (mg L−1), S is the solute concentration
    in the solid phase (mg g−1), g is the solute concentration in the gas phase (mg
    L−1), θ is the volumetric water content (cm3 cm−3), av is the air content (cm3
    cm−3), q is the volumetric flux density (cm d−1), μw is the first-order rate constant
    for the solute in the liquid phase (d−1), μ′w is the first-order rate constant
    providing the connection between individual nitrogen species in the liquid phase
    (d−1), ra is the root nutrient uptake term (mg L−1 d−1), Dw is the dispersion
    coefficient (cm2 d−1) for the liquid phase, and Dg is the diffusion coefficient
    (cm2 d−1) for the gas phase. The subscripts 1, 2, and 3 represent (NH2)2CO, NH4+,
    and NO3-, respectively. The dispersion coefficient in the liquid phase, Dw, is
    given as: (9) where Dw is the molecular diffusion coefficient in free water (cm2
    d−1), τw is a unitless tortuosity factor in the liquid phase, |q| is the absolute
    value of the Darcian fluid flux density (cm d−1), and DL is the longitudinal dispersivity
    (cm). 2.3. Model parameterization In a preliminary step, the parameters (θr, θs,
    α, n, and Ks) controlling water flow in Hydrus-1D need to be assessed. The simulated
    water balance requires validation using soil water content values monitored at
    different soil depths along the profile. The lower boundary condition is set to
    free drainage (downward water flux at the bottom of the soil profile, q) as the
    mean annual depth to water is about 10 m and has minimal impact on the top few
    meters of soil (https://snr.unl.edu/data/water/groundwater/realtime/default.aspx).
    The upper boundary condition depends on the atmospheric fluxes occurring at the
    soil surface (Rnet and Ep). When the superficial matric pressure head is less
    than a default threshold value, then the flux boundary condition at the soil surface
    automatically switches to a constant pressure head boundary condition, resulting
    in a reduction of potential evaporation (Ep) into actual evaporation (Ea). A proportion
    of net rainfall is turned into runoff when the superficial matric pressure head
    exceeds the maximum soil surface matric head value, representing the nominal depth
    of surface water ponding allowable before runoff generation. Initial conditions
    were set by interpolating the measured soil water content values in the soil profile
    on January 1st, 2001. Plant potential transpiration, Tp, occurs through the roots,
    which are linearly distributed along the soil profile, varying from a maximum
    at the soil surface to a minimum at the time-variant maximum rooting depth. Tp
    is reduced by water stress to actual transpiration (Ta). The actual RWU rate corresponding
    to Ta, i.e., the sink term (ξ) in Eq. (3), is modeled using the method proposed
    by Feddes et al. (1978). Maize Tp is reduced between ψ = −325 cm (if Tp > 0.5 cm
    d−1) or ψ = −600 cm (if Tp < 0.1 cm d−1) and the wilting point that corresponds
    to ψwp = −8000 cm (Wesseling et al., 1991). Unlimited passive uptakes of both
    NH4+ and NO3- were allowed in the root solute uptake model by specifying the maximum
    allowed uptake concentration exceeding NO3- concentrations in the root zone. More
    details are provided in the Hydrus manual (Šimůnek et al., 2006). Fertilization
    was given in the form of urea (solute 1), and a total annual amount of 195 kg N
    ha−1 (corresponding to a solute mass per unit area of 1.95 mg cm−2) was applied
    on the soil surface in a single treatment on April 1st. The solute parameters
    featured in the urea–ammonium–nitrate fertigation system subject to nitrogen (N)
    transformation processes were taken from Hanson et al. (2006), as done by other
    authors (Ramos et al., 2012, Bradshaw et al., 2013, Nasta et al., 2021). For each
    soil layer, the soil hydraulic parameters θs, α, and n were fitted to the measured
    soil water retention data pairs (Eq. (4)). To reduce the number of fitting parameters,
    we assumed θr = 0 cm3 cm−3 (Leij et al., 2005). The Levenberg-Marquardt type parameter
    optimization algorithm embedded in Hydrus-1D was used to estimate the Ks values
    of each layer by minimizing the difference between simulated and observed soil
    water content values at the soil depths of 10 cm, 25 cm, 50 cm, and 100 cm during
    the growing season (N = 3603). The comparison between observations and model simulations
    in the dormant season (N = 3702) was ignored in the inverse modeling since information
    on snow accumulation, snow melting, and soil freezing-defrosting processes was
    missing. In Hydrus-1D, four observation points were placed at each of these soil
    depths. Model performance measures are based on the root mean square error (RMSE)
    and coefficient of determination (R2), defined as: (10) (11) ̅ where O, ̅ , and
    P are the observed, mean of observed, and predicted values of soil water content
    at time step i expressed in days (n is the total number of time steps). For an
    optimum prediction, values should be as low as possible for RMSE and as close
    as possible to 1 for R2. In addition, the performance metric Kling-Gupta efficiency
    (KGE) is defined as (Gupta et al., 2009): (12) where r is Pearson’s correlation
    coefficient, β is the ratio of estimated and observed means, and γ indicates the
    ratio of estimated and observed coefficients of variation. Optimal predictions
    are diagnosed by KGE = 1 as well as by r = 1, β = 1, γ = 1. 2.4. Synthetic approaches
    to estimate field capacity Soil water storage at field capacity (WFC) was estimated
    by using two synthetic approaches (Fig. 2): 1) Synthetic drainage experiment scenarios
    were used to estimate the flux-based field capacity (WFC) by considering eight
    negligible drainage fluxes (qFC) (qFC = 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4,
    0.49 cm d−1) proposed in the literature (red box in Fig. 2; Section 2.4.1) (Nachabe,
    1998, Romano and Santini, 2002, Twarakavi et al., 2009, de Jong van Lier and Wendroth,
    2016, Reynolds, 2018, Turek et al., 2020); 2) Synthetic irrigation scheduling
    scenarios were used to estimate 24 functional field capacity (WFC) values by considering
    local on-farm practices (Payero et al., 2008, Rudnick et al., 2016); the WFC value
    that results in minimum drought stress (or maximum percentage of Ta/Tp), minimum
    drainage flux (q) and nitrate leaching at the lower boundary (blue box in Fig.
    2; Section 2.4.2) was selected as the optimal functional field capacity. Download

    Schematic overview of the proposed methodology to assess: a) flux-based field
    capacity with eight synthetic drainage experiment scenarios depending on prescribed
    negligible fluxes, qFC (red box), and b) functional field capacity with 24 synthetic
    irrigation scheduling scenarios depending on the combination of four prescribed
    matric pressure head values, ψp, and six user-specified irrigation rates, Irrs
    (blue box). These prescribed values originate from site-specific farming practices
    reported in the field and in the body of literature. R, Rnet, Ep, Tp, q, Ea, Ta,
    and NO3- indicate gross rainfall, net rainfall, potential evaporation, potential
    transpiration, drainage flux, actual evaporation, actual transpiration, and nitrate
    concentration, respectively. 2.4.1. Estimation of flux-based field capacity from
    drainage experiment scenarios The synthetic drainage experiment assumes an initially
    saturated soil profile, one-dimensional vertical gravity-driven flow (no lateral
    flow), null water flux across the soil surface (evaporation and rainfall set to
    zero), and no water uptake by roots (ξ = 0). Solute transport is neglected in
    this simulation, and the soil hydraulic parameters (θs, α, n, and Ks) in each
    soil layer were assessed in Section 2.3. The initial and boundary conditions were
    the following: (13) ψ(z,t) = 0 for 0 ≥ z ≥ zr at t=0 (14) q(z,t) = q0 = 0 at z
    = 0, ∀ t ≥ 0 (15) where zFC is the depth of the model flow domain corresponding
    to the bottom of the active root zone (zr = −135 cm), and H is the total hydraulic
    head (H = z + ψ). Conditions (14)–(15) impose: (i) zero soil matric head (ψ = 0)
    throughout the soil profile at the beginning of the simulation (i.e., an initially
    saturated, gravity-draining soil profile); (ii) zero water flux at the soil surface
    (q0 = 0 at z = 0) for t ≥ 0; and (iii) free drainage (∂H/∂z = +1) at the lower
    boundary (z = zr). The water storage at field capacity (WFC) in the root zone
    is defined as (Romano and Santini, 2002): (16) where θi is soil water content
    at each i-th node and N is the total number of nodes within the selected zr, Δzi
    is nodal spacing, and . WFC is determined (Eq. (16)) when the flux at the bottom
    of the root zone (q) reaches a prescribed threshold value, qFC (qFC = 0.01 cm
    d−1, 0.025 cm d−1, 0.05 cm d−1, 0.1 cm d−1, 0.2 cm d−1, 0.3 cm d−1, 0.4 cm d−1,
    and 0.49 cm d−1) at drainage time, tFC (Inforsato and de Jong van Lier, 2021,
    Turek et al., 2022). It is worth noting that, due to the discontinuity of the
    soil water contents across the interface of the soil layers, the value of θFC
    cannot be computed as the integral mean of the water content profile recorded
    at a certain time. 2.4.2. Estimation of a functional field capacity condition
    from irrigation scheduling scenarios The initial and boundary conditions are the
    same as described in Section 2.3. The soil hydraulic parameters (θs, α, n, and
    Ks) of each soil layer were assessed according to the criteria described in Section
    2.3. To mitigate excessive crop water stress during the growing season, Hydrus-1D
    has the option to trigger a user-specified irrigation rate (Irrs) when a prescribed
    pressure head (ψp) is reached at a given observation node. Irrigation starts after
    a user-specified lag period at a user-specified irrigation rate. The duration
    of irrigation is also specified. The irrigation scheduling scenarios were obtained
    by running Hydrus-1D repeatedly by changing: i) the prescribed matric pressure
    head values at which irrigation is initiated (ψp = −300 cm, ψp = −500 cm, ψp =
    −700 cm, ψp = −900 cm) at an observation node located at the soil depth of 67.5 cm,
    i.e., half of the maximum root depth (blue square in the soil profile in Fig.
    2), ii) the specified irrigation rates (Irrs = 0.5 cm d−1, Irrs = 1.0 cm d−1,
    Irrs = 1.5 cm d−1, Irrs = 2.0 cm d−1, Irrs = 2.5 cm d−1, Irrs = 3.0 cm d−1). For
    simplicity, both the lag period and duration of irrigation were set to 1 day.
    The functional field capacity as the water storage (WFC) in the active root zone
    (Eq. (16)) was determined at the end of the synthetic irrigation event (after
    1 day, as we set both duration and lag equal to 1 day). The water and solute balance
    components were stored for each model simulation. 3. Results 3.1. Model parameterization
    and water and nitrate balance in the irrigated plot Whereas the Hydrus-1D model
    uses the basic units of length in cm, for convenience, the water balance components
    are presented here as units of length in mm. The optimized soil water retention
    parameters for each soil layer are reported in Table 1, whereas Fig. 3 shows the
    comparison between observed and simulated soil water content values at the four
    soil depths of z = 10 cm, z = 25 cm, z = 50 cm, and z = 100 cm. The shape of the
    water retention curve is mostly influenced by the values of n and α featured in
    Eq. (4). The soil water retention function of the deepest soil layers (z = 75–135 cm)
    has the lowest values of n and α, and is characterized by a smooth decay in soil
    water content with increasing pressure head values. The optimized values of θs
    and Ks show a decreasing pattern towards the deeper layers, and this behavior
    is mainly induced by soil compaction (Turkeltaub et al., 2020). The prediction
    performance (RMSE and R2) metrics reported in Table 1 are fair despite the fact
    that we suspect the model was ill-informed by the sensors located at two soil
    depths. The removal of observed soil water content values in the last five years
    (N = 1098) at soil depths of 10 cm and 100 cm for suspicious malfunctioning (especially
    the deepest layer, see Fig. 3e) enhanced the RMSE and R2 values (Table 1) and
    proved to be satisfactory if compared to previous studies in agricultural fields
    (Wollschläger et al., 2009, Wöhling and Vrugt, 2011, Ket et al., 2018, Sao et
    al., 2021). The best KGE was obtained in the deepest layer, where soil water content
    was kept constantly near fully saturated conditions (Fig. 3e). In contrast, the
    seasonal variability of the observed soil water content was difficult to match
    in the first three soil layers (Fig. 3b-d), and this is depicted by relatively
    lower KGE values (Table 1). This was corroborated by a scrutiny of the three KGE
    scores (r, β, and γ, not reported in Table 1). The correlation coefficients passed
    the 0.05 significance test in all layers and ranged between 0.435 in the second
    layer and 0.473 in the fourth layer. The β values were close to unity for all
    layers, indicating unbiased predictions. While on the one hand, r and β values
    were similar in all layers, on the other hand, γ values controlled KGE along soil
    depth, with the farthest (γ = 1.492) and the closest (γ = 0.984) from optimum
    (γ = 1) for the second and fourth layer, respectively. Table 1. Optimized soil

    of simulated water content values (standard deviations of 0.0609 cm3 cm−3, 0.0618 cm3
    cm−3, 0.0415 cm3 cm−3, and 0.0097 cm3 cm−3 at soil depths of 10 cm, 25 cm, 50 cm,
    and 100 cm, respectively) was higher than the one of corresponding observations
    in the first three soil depths (standard deviations of 0.0542 cm3 cm−3, 0.0489 cm3
    cm−3, 0.0383 cm3 cm−3, and 0.0113 cm3 cm−3 at soil depths of 10 cm, 25 cm, 50 cm,
    and 100 cm, respectively). The impact of tillage operations on soil porosity was
    ignored, but we are aware that it might influence the soil hydraulic properties
    of the uppermost soil layer (Schlüter et al., 2018, Hu et al., 2018, Fu et al.,
    2021, Talukder et al., 2022). The mean water balance in the irrigation seasons
    (corresponding to the 100-day-long period ranging from mid-June to mid-September)
    in 2001–2020 is reported in Table 2. The inter-annual variability of water balance
    components was mainly controlled by rainfall variability, which ranged from 50.4 mm
    to 248.6 mm with a mean value of 146.7 mm. The amount of water supplied by rainfall
    in the irrigation season was not sufficient to meet the average crop-specific
    potential evapotranspiration demand (ETc =236.8 mm). Table 2. Mean, standard deviation
    (SD), minimum (Min), and maximum (Max) of annual net rainfall (Rnet), potential

    supplied by precipitation and irrigation exceeded the crop water requirement during
    the irrigation season, ETa represented 92% of ETc when using simulations with
    irrigation. Average annual drainage represented about 20% of precipitation and
    irrigation by inducing on average 0.376 mg cm−2 (corresponding to 37.6 kg N ha−1
    or 19.2% of applied fertilizer) nitrate leachate. The mean annual drought stress,
    namely the difference between potential (Tp) and actual (Ta) transpiration, was
    19.1 mm and 36.0 mm with or without irrigation scheduling, respectively. Reductions
    in drainage (−8.5 mm) and nitrate leaching (−0.075 mg cm−2 or −7.5 kg N ha−1)
    are reported when removing the irrigation events (Table 2). 3.2. Estimation of
    flux-based field capacity from drainage simulation scenarios The decrease in water
    storage over time derived from the simulation of the draining process across the
    layered soil profile is presented in Fig. 4a. Theoretically, water storage and
    the corresponding drainage flux, q, at the bottom of the active root zone (Fig.
    4b), decrease for very long periods. We report the field capacity (WFC) at which
    q is equal to a predefined negligible flux, qFC (Table 3). Download : Download

    eight prescribed negligible drainage fluxes, qFC, given in the literature (qFC

    60.4 cm and 39.2 cm at the maximum (qFC = 0.49 cm d−1) and minimum (qFC = 0.01 cm
    d−1) qFC-values, respectively. Only the first prescribed negligible flux provides
    a drainage time that is consistent with the classical definition given by, i.e.,
    “the amount of water held in soil after excess water has drained away and the
    rate of downward movement has materially decreased, which usually takes place
    within 2–3 days after a rain or irrigation in pervious soils of uniform structure
    and texture”. Fig. 5 shows the vertical distribution of soil matric head and soil
    water content values at the eight drainage times listed in Table 3. Note that,
    during the evolution of the drainage process, soil matric head profiles are continuous
    in the entire flow domain, whereas soil water content profiles are discontinuous
    across the interface of layers characterized by contrasting soil hydraulic properties
    (Romano et al., 1998). In other words, at a fixed drainage time (tFC), one can
    compute the profile-averaged matric head, but the discontinuity of water content
    profiles hinders the calculation of the integral mean for function θ(z,tFC) in
    the entire flow domain. This drawback raises further vagueness when assessing
    the soil water content at the condition of field capacity in the case of stratified
    soil profiles. Nevertheless, due to similar soil hydraulic functions of the first
    three soil layers (−75 cm < z < 0 cm; see the hydraulic parameters in Table 1),
    Fig. 5b shows that the resulting soil water contents across the soil layer boundaries
    vary little, and therefore an average θ-value can be assumed to be roughly representative
    from the soil surface (z = 0) to the soil depth of 75 cm, especially for the times
    around 59 days after the initiation of the simulation (Nasta and Romano, 2016).

    from irrigation scheduling scenarios The results of the 24 synthetic irrigation
    scheduling scenarios are shown in Fig. 6. We calculated the water and nitrate
    balance components in the 100-day-long irrigation season: total irrigation amount

    and cumulative nitrate flux (NO3- flux). Download : Download high-res image (371KB)

    nitrate flux (NO3- flux) for user-specified irrigation rates (Irrs) and prescribed
    matric pressure head values (ψp = −300 cm, ψp = −500 cm, ψp = −700 cm, ψp = −900 cm,
    indicated by the green, blue, red, and yellow bars, respectively). Horizontal
    dashed lines indicate reference values obtained from simulations without irrigation.
    The four prescribed matric pressure heads (ψp) are distinguished by different
    colors in Fig. 6 and control the number of irrigation events (Fig. 6b). Triggering
    irrigation at a low matric head value (ψp = −900 cm, yellow bars) induced the
    lowest number of irrigation events (N = 5) and the lowest amount of total irrigation
    (Irr ranging from 27 mm to 162 mm). In contrast, triggering irrigation at a pressure
    head (ψp = −300 cm, green bars) close to the beginning of drought stress induced
    the highest number of irrigation events (N ranging from 14 to 30) and the largest
    amount of irrigation sums (Irr ranging from 154 mm to 423 mm). Ta and q were correlated
    with the total amount of irrigation (Fig. 6a-c-d). Frequent irrigation applications
    (green bars in Fig. 6a) induced the largest Ta and q sums (green bars in Fig.
    6c-d). The water (q) and nitrate leachate fluxes obtained by fixing Irrs = 0.5 cm
    d−1 and ψp = −300 cm were similar to those obtained without irrigation scheduling.
    The irrigation management based on Irrs > 0.5 cm d−1 and ψp = −300 cm prevented
    the initiation of crop stress but would require many irrigation applications at
    the cost of obtaining the largest drainage and high nitrate contamination. When
    irrigation was initiated under sub-optimal water conditions (ψp = −700 cm and
    ψp = −900 cm), simulated Ta and q were lower than those obtained with ψp = −300 cm.
    Nevertheless, Ta was quite insensitive to irrigation rates higher than 1.0 cm
    d−1 (Fig. 6c-d). The nitrate leachate was correlated to drainage but also depended
    on the reaction parameters (transforming urea into ammonium and ammonium into
    nitrate), root nitrate uptake dynamics, and fertilization timing and amount. Generally,
    nitrate leachate ranged between 0.121 mg cm−2 (or 12.1 kg N ha−1) and 0.611 mg cm−2
    (or 61.1 kg N ha−1) obtained when Irrs = 0.5 cm d−1 and for ψp = −700 cm and Irrs
    = 2.5 cm d−1 and for ψp = −500 cm, respectively (Fig. 6e). The range of nitrate
    leachate presented in Table 2 and Fig. 6e compares well to a similar field measurement-based
    study in the region, where measured nitrate leaching represented up to 27% of
    input for continuous maize (Klocke et al., 1999). Fig. 7 shows the distribution
    of field capacity (WFC) values by considering all irrigation scheduling scenarios.
    The mean of all field capacity values was 51.2 cm, whereas the 25th, 50th, and
    75th percentiles were 48.1 cm, 51.4 cm, and 54.6 cm, respectively. The median
    of field capacity values tended to increase with increasing prescribed pressure
    heads (from 55.3 cm to 47.9 cm for ψp = −300 cm and ψp = −900 cm, respectively)
    and with increasing irrigation rates. Download : Download high-res image (207KB)

    = −500 cm, c) ψp = −700 cm, d) ψp = −900 cm. The horizontal dashed line indicates
    the water storage at saturation (Ws = 63.6 cm). The pillar of “more irrigation,
    less drought stress, more drainage, and more nitrate leaching” was generally valid
    and the choice of the best irrigation practice depended on the maximum amount
    of water the producers were willing to supply, on the maximum crop yield (which
    in turn depends on the relationship with actual RWU), and on the maximum nitrate
    leachate allowed by local regulations. When nitrate concentration in groundwater
    is above 10 mg L−1, the maximum contaminant level (MCL) and hazardous health effects
    become a concern among humans and animals (https://extensionpublications.unl.edu/assets/pdf/g1784.pdf).
    In light of these conditions, the best irrigation scheduling (Irr = 217.5 mm distributed
    in 21 events per irrigation season) was determined when fixing ψp = −700 cm and
    Irrs = 1.0 cm d−1. This synthetic irrigation scenario ensured a rise in Ta from
    174.0 mm (Table 2) to 200.9 mm (Fig. 6c), in q from 38.6 mm (Table 2) to 59.9 mm
    (Fig. 6d), and in nitrate flux from 0.101 mg cm−2 (Table 2) to 0.253 mg cm−2 (Fig.
    6e). The best irrigation scheduling scenario relied on a 217.5 mm irrigation amount
    by saving 72.5 mm in each season (when compared to the 290 mm supplied by local
    producers) and obtained Ta representing about 96% of Tp. The simulated drainage
    (q = 59.9 mm) and nitrate leaching (0.253 mg cm−2) were lower than those (q =
    87.0 mm and 0.376 mg cm−2) simulated by using observed agronomic practices (Table
    2). A range of plausible values for the functional root-zone water storage was
    calculated using the Student’s t distribution for a 95% confidence interval, obtaining
    average values between 49.7 and 50.3 cm (corresponding approximately to 80% of
    saturation condition). Fig. 8 shows an illustrative example of the irrigation
    application in 2002 by fixing ψp = −700 cm and supplying water at the rate Irrs
    = 1.0 cm d−1. On day 613 (5 September 2002), ETa was 0.24 cm d−1 and the profile-average
    matric head ψ = −741.1 cm. Therefore, the irrigation event started because ψp
    reached the threshold value of − 700 cm at the soil depth of 67.5 cm. Then, the
    irrigation application ended on day 614 (6 September 2002), and both soil water
    content and matric pressure head values increased in the upper layers of the soil
    profile by sustaining ETa = 0.297 cm d−1. On day 615 (7 September 2002), the uppermost
    portion of the root zone (i.e., z between 0 cm and 40 cm) rapidly desaturated
    under dry conditions (as visualized by retreating orange curves in Fig. 8). Nevertheless,
    the soil water storage capacity ranged between 49.6 cm and 50.2 cm (approximately
    at the field capacity condition) by limiting drought stress and downward flux.

    agriculture relies on efficient irrigation scheduling to apply water to crops
    at the right time and in the right amount (Graham et al., 2022, Srinivasan et
    al., 2022, Kumar et al., 2022). Smart irrigation enables farmers to save water
    without subjecting crops to moisture deficiency and adverse environmental impacts
    (Bwambale et al., 2022). The functional field capacity (blue box in Fig. 2b) was
    derived from the optimal irrigation scheduling scenario by minimizing crop water
    stress, excessive drainage, and nitrate leaching in an agronomic layered soil
    profile beneath maize in eastern Nebraska. In this study, we found a mean seasonal
    irrigation total of 217.5 mm distributed over 21 daily events. On average, simulated
    irrigation water was supplied every five days at a rate of 1 cm d−1. In Mead,
    irrigation usually ranges between 230 mm and 350 mm and is applied with a rate
    of 0.65 cm d−1 per 3-day-long period to ensure a full rotation of the pivot due
    to its speed (Suyker and Verma, 2009, Gibson et al., 2017). Frequent irrigation
    applications with relatively low rates are beneficial for crop growth but in practice
    might be affected by evaporation loss from the sprinklers, therefore, future studies
    should consider the tradeoff between maintenance factors and optimal irrigation
    scheduling. Nitrate leaching is controlled by fertilization timing and amount,
    nitrogen transformations, root nitrate uptake dynamics, and water movement, which,
    in turn, are influenced by the soil hydraulic properties of each soil layer, atmospheric
    boundary conditions, and irrigation management (Weitzman et al., 2022). In this
    study, nitrate leachate (0.252 mg cm−2 or 25.2 kg N ha−1) derived from the best
    irrigation scheduling scenario represents 13% of the fertilizer amount (1.95 mg cm−2
    or 195 kg N ha−1). High transpiration fluxes favored by irrigation supply during
    the irrigation season induce root nitrate uptake rates at their maximum level
    by limiting nitrate migration below the root zone. Samani et al. (2020) found
    mean annual nitrate leaching of 52 kg N ha−1 and 91 kg N ha−1 for continuous corn
    and for corn-soybean rotation at Mead (NE). We neglected the economic criterion
    of efficiency because costs and prices are volatile and fluctuate rapidly from
    year to year, whereas the relationship between drought stress and crop yield needs
    to be carefully assessed in a follow-up study (Sharma and Irmak, 2020, Zhang et
    al., 2021a, Zhang et al., 2021b). Crop yield was ignored in this study because
    it would require specific on-farm measurements and a detailed crop growth model
    (Létourneau et al., 2015, Vogeler et al., 2019, Kelly et al., 2023). The other
    model simulation (red box in Fig. 2a) refers to a synthetic drainage experiment
    enabling the flux-based field capacity to be assessed. The determination of the
    flux-based field capacity is a non-trivial task and should follow a standard protocol
    by removing, as much as possible, all vague criteria related to the duration of
    the synthetic drainage process (Veihmeyer and Hendrickson, 1949, Ritchie, 1981,
    Wilcox, 1959, Assouline and Or, 2014, Armindo and Wendroth, 2016). A further difficulty
    arises because real-world soil profiles are layered rather than uniform (Nasta
    and Romano, 2016). That said, we pose the following questions: what is the negligible
    flux rate at which simulated drainage is assumed null? What is the corresponding
    drainage time? A first attempt is to take advantage of the information on soil
    water storage depletion over time. This task can be performed using quantitative
    or qualitative techniques based on the soil water storage decay over time simulated
    during the synthetic drainage process. A qualitative and somewhat subjective technique
    has been illustrated by Zotarelli et al. (2019), who reported a very practical,
    but rather subjective way of detecting the condition of field capacity in actual
    agronomic soils as the point of intersection of the two tangents at the curve
    depicting the water storage depletion: one tangent drawn some hours or a few days
    (fast-drainage slope) and the other tangent drawn several days or even several
    months (slow-drainage slope) after the start of drainage. By applying this empirical
    approach to the soil water storage depletion curve shown in Fig. 4, it was found
    that the root-zone water storage capacity at field capacity (WFC) is 53.7 cm,
    about 25 days after the beginning of the model simulation. A rough quantitative
    estimation of the drainage time (tFC) at the condition of field capacity was obtained
    by using the analytical method developed by Ogata and Richards (1957) and verified
    by Wilcox (1959). The soil water storage depletion curve of Fig. 4 was interpolated
    with a power function [W(t) = 78.7 × t−0.117, for t greater than 1 day] whose
    derivative enabled us to obtain tFC = 57.2 d by fixing the negligible drainage
    flux dW/dt = qFC = 0.10 cm d−1 as suggested by Meyer and Gee (1999), and hence
    to obtain WFC= 49.1 cm. Furthermore, in most cases, smart irrigation systems rely
    on low-cost capacitance sensors to monitor soil water content at different soil
    depths across the soil profile. Therefore, a convenient and practical rule to
    ascertain the condition of field capacity in the soil profile is to refer to the
    resolution of a sensor that expresses the extent to which the target variable
    can change to be recorded by the datalogger. New-generation capacitance sensors
    have a resolution of approximately 0.001 cm3 cm−3 and, accounting for the simulation
    results, this entails that the soil water storage depletion can no longer be detected
    at approximately 50 days after the initiation of the synthetic drainage process.
    As a conclusive comment on the multiple aspects covered in this discussion section,
    we point out that the flux-based water storage at field capacity obtained from
    the synthetic drainage process is quite similar to the functional value of water
    storage capacity (WFC = 50 cm) reported in Table 3 at qFC = 0.10 cm d−1 and tFC
    = 59 days. Yet, the drainage time at field capacity obtained from the synthetic
    drainage process should only be considered a fictitious parameter that allows
    comparing the two simulation scenarios used in this study (see the schematics
    in Fig. 2), but certainly cannot correspond to the maximum interval allowed between
    irrigations (i.e., the so-called irrigation frequency) if water is supplied at
    the rate Irrs = 1.0 cm d−1. 5. Conclusions Efficient irrigation scheduling optimizes
    the application of water at the right time and in the right amount. Field capacity
    represents the threshold storage needed to control the optimal irrigation amount
    by limiting the negative effects related to underwatering and overwatering. Applying
    more than the required irrigation water triggers excessive drainage and nitrate
    leaching. By contrast, supplying inadequate irrigation amounts may lead to crop
    stress and a reduction in crop yield. In this study, we assessed the functional
    water storage at field capacity by minimizing crop water stress and potential
    negative effects on the environment such as excessive drainage and nitrate leaching
    in a layered soil profile beneath maize in eastern Nebraska. We tested 24 irrigation
    scheduling scenarios by changing irrigation timing and rate. The lowest drought
    stress, drainage, and nitrate leachate were obtained by triggering irrigation
    near optimal conditions (ψp = −300 cm) for irrigation rates higher than 0.50 cm
    d−1. By contrast, increasing the irrigation rates and amounts is detrimental in
    terms of drainage and groundwater contamination without further benefits for root
    water uptake. Therefore, an optimal compromise was found when fixing Irrs = 1.0 cm
    d−1 and ψp = −700 cm. The functional water storage field capacity (WFC) derived
    from this irrigation practice was between 49.70 and 50.30 cm, but this value cannot
    be directly converted into soil water content at field capacity (θFC) for the
    layered soil profile. The synthetic drainage experiment is used for assessing
    the flux-based field capacity that is obtained when the drainage flux at the lower
    boundary of the soil profile is approximately null. The functional analysis carried
    out in this study is useful to correct the vagueness in the synthetic drainage
    process when the field capacity concept was adapted to practical agronomic heuristics.
    This protocol can be transferred to other agricultural fields under different
    climates, soil, and crop characteristics. Moreover, the implementation of improved
    irrigation scheduling schemes can help minimize adverse tradeoffs between water
    quality and water quantity that exist throughout the Midwest USA. Declaration

    Optimization of irrigation scheduling is a widely proposed solution to enhance
    agricultural water productivity and mitigate water scarcity. However, there is
    currently a lack of knowledge about how to most effectively optimize and adapt
    irrigation decisions under weather and climate uncertainty, or about how the benefits
    of adaptive irrigation scheduling compare to fixed heuristics commonly used by
    farmers. In this article, we assess the added value of in-season adaptation of
    irrigation strategies in comparison to a fixed irrigation strategy that maximizes
    average profits over a range of plausible weather outcomes, but is not adjusted
    year-to-year. To perform this assessment, the AquaCrop-OSPy crop-water model is
    used to simulate a case study of irrigated maize production in a water scarce
    region in the central United States. Irrigation strategies are defined that maximize
    mean seasonal profit over a range of historical years. This baseline profit is
    then compared to the case of adaptive strategies, where the irrigation strategy
    is re-optimized at multiple stages within each season. Our analysis finds that
    fixed irrigation heuristics on average achieve over 90 % of potential profits
    attained with perfect seasonal foresight. In-season adaptation marginally increased
    agricultural profitability, with greater benefits found when re-optimization occurs
    more frequently or is accompanied by reliable forecasts of weather for the week

    1. Introduction Increasing pressures on global freshwater resources are a concern
    for policy-makers worldwide (Molden and FAO, 2020). As irrigation accounts for
    over 70 % of this global freshwater use, many regions are exploring ways to reduce
    agricultural water use in order to mitigate current and future water scarcity
    and conflicts. Given the simultaneous need to increase food production to meet
    needs of growing populations and their changing dietary preferences, reducing
    or stabilizing agricultural water demands requires a focus on improving agricultural
    water productivity (i.e., generating more crop output per unit of water input
    or consumption). Strategies to achieve this goal come in the form of explicit
    policy restrictions on abstractions such as quotas (e.g., Leathes et al., 2008;
    López-Morales and Duchin, 2011; FAO, 2020; Loch et al., 2020; Young et al., 2021),
    as well as efforts to incentivize greater water use efficiency and productivity
    by improving how irrigation is scheduled and applied during the growing season
    (e.g., Adeyemi et al., 2017; Berbel et al., 2019; Kukal et al., 2019; Taghvaeian
    et al., 2020). An extensive body of research exists that focuses on developing
    optimal irrigation scheduling strategies and rules to enable farmers to maximize
    profits or water productivity (e.g., Schütze et al., 2012; Kloss et al., 2014;
    Linker et al., 2016; Linker and Kisekka, 2017; Kelly and Foster, 2021). An issue
    faced when seeking to develop optimal irrigation management strategies is that
    optimal rules or decisions must hedge across multiple potential weather scenarios
    as farmers have at best only partial foresight of weather conditions in the upcoming
    growing season. A common approach in research and practice to address this uncertainty
    is to optimize a single irrigation management strategy that maximizes the average
    profit over a range of potential weather outcomes such as observed in a historical
    record (Linker and Kisekka, 2017, Kelly et al., 2021). Alternatively, other studies
    have focused on selecting a single ‘average’ year from a collection of years (e.g.,
    in terms of total rainfall), and optimizing irrigation management rules for that
    specific average year (Kloss et al., 2014). One potential means of increasing
    productivity and profitability of agricultural water use would be to identify
    mechanisms to adapt average irrigation strategies during the season as more information
    is gained about weather patterns in a specific year. In this context, several
    studies have used adaptive simulation-optimization frameworks to evaluate potential
    benefits of using weather forecasts to adapt irrigation schedules intraseasonally,
    concluding that such approaches can generate substantial increases in profits
    for producers (Wang and Cai, 2009, Cai et al., 2011, Jamal et al., 2019). Similarly,
    Linker (2021) also used an adaptive simulation-optimization framework to evaluate
    benefits of in-season re-optimization of irrigation decision rules, showing that
    this approach yielded irrigation schedules that were close to those that would
    be achievable with perfect seasonal weather foresight. However, a common limitation
    of these studies is that they do not assess or quantify the benefits of adaptive
    irrigation strategies in comparison with fixed irrigation heuristics that are
    commonly used by farmers and have been widely developed by researchers. As a result,
    these studies provide insufficient insights about the potential benefits and costs
    of adaptive irrigation scheduling, including potential risks of maladaptation.
    Better understanding of these trade-offs is critical to support improved agricultural
    water management decisions, in particular given the extensive data requirements
    and associated costs that adaptive scheduling may entail relative to use of fixed
    or average irrigation rules. For example, re-optimizing irrigation schedules may
    require additional knowledge of the current state of the crop (e.g., rooting depth,
    plant height, leaf-area index), which may be costly to collect alongside the time
    and resources required to setup and implement optimization approaches during the
    season (Trout et al., 2008, Lozoya et al., 2016, Herrmann et al., 2019). In this
    study, we address the abovementioned gaps in understanding about the benefits
    of adaptive intraseasonal scheduling as a means of improving agricultural water
    use productivity and profitability under weather and climate uncertainty. Specifically,
    this article will aim to answer the following questions: 1. What is the economic
    value of adapting irrigation strategies within the season in response to the unfolding
    weather? 2. Does this value change depending on adaptation frequency, water-use
    restrictions, and the presence of perfect short term weather forecasts? To answer
    these questions, we develop a simulation-optimization approach – using the crop-water
    model AquaCrop-OSPy – to evaluate the economic benefits of adaptive irrigation
    scheduling compared with fixed irrigation decision heuristics. We focus on a case
    study of irrigated maize production in the central United States where there are
    significant pressures to improve crop water productivity in response to aquifer
    drawdown and streamflow depletion (Scanlon et al., 2012, McGuire, 2017). Our analysis
    explores how the value of adapting irrigation scheduling rules within the season
    varies as a function of factors that have been largely neglected in past studies,
    including different weather scenarios, regulatory water abstraction rules, adaptation
    frequency and short-term weather forecasts. Our findings provide guidance to researchers,
    producers, and water management stakeholders on how adaptive irrigation scheduling
    impacts agricultural water use and farm profits. This guidance includes the role
    adaptive scheduling approaches can play in addressing water scarcity challenges
    in regions experiencing chronic or growing water scarcity pressures. 2. Method
    In this section, we first describe how we link a crop-growth model, AquaCrop-OSPy,
    to an optimization algorithm to determine a profit-maximizing irrigation strategy
    over a set of climate years. We then discuss how we adapt this approach to allow
    irrigation strategies to be re-optimized within the season to assess the added
    value of adaptive irrigation scheduling. We present our methods in five subsections
    that describe the choice of crop simulation model (Section 2.1), approach for
    identifying profit maximizing irrigation strategies (Section 2.2), re-optimization
    of these irrigation strategies within the season (Section 2.3), details of the
    specific case study chosen (e.g., location, crop choice and model parameters)
    (Section 2.4), and an outline of sensitivity analyses performed to assess the
    influence of key model assumptions and production characteristics (Section 2.5).
    2.1. Crop simulation model Crop simulation models are powerful tools that simulate
    crop growth using biophysical equations (Jones et al., 2003, Steduto et al., 2009,
    Adeyemi et al., 2017). These models can be used to help design and identify strategies
    to enhance the productivity of water use in crop production at a much lower time
    and monetary cost than field experiments (Jiang et al., 2016, Araya et al., 2016,
    Goosheh et al., 2018). As well as the ability to compare more combinations of
    climate, management and irrigation scenarios, these models can be linked to optimization
    algorithms to more effectively discover potential scheduling strategies (Kloss
    et al., 2014, Linker et al., 2016, Linker and Kisekka, 2017, Kelly et al., 2021).
    A wide variety of crop simulation models exist, each designed with specific use
    cases in mind and thus with their own strengths and weaknesses. Most come in the
    form of a Graphical User Interface, allowing users to alter crop, soil and management
    parameters and then run simulations for a given weather time series and production
    environment (Ragab, 2002, Jones et al., 2003, Steduto et al., 2009). AquaCrop,
    developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (UN-FAO),
    is a water-driven model that aims to quantify the response of crops to water stress
    (Steduto et al., 2009). It contains relatively few parameters compared with other
    models, allowing it to be used in data-scarce environments. Due to its popularity,
    AquaCrop has been successfully implemented in Matlab/Octave (Foster, Brozović,
    Butler et al., 2017), R (Rodriguez and Ober, 2019), and Python (Kelly and Foster,
    2021). Given the flexibility of both the model implementation (allowing us to
    easily integrate the model with optimization libraries) and of the Python language
    itself, the Python version of the model – AquaCrop-OSPy – was selected for use
    in this analysis. 2.2. Identifying optimal non-adaptive strategies The goal of
    optimal irrigation management is to manage the water content in the soil to facilitate
    maximum crop growth with minimal water application. For farmers, optimal irrigation
    management typically involves defining and optimizing one or more thresholds that
    specify the level of soil-moisture to maintain over the season. Given that crop-water
    requirements vary with growth stage (Çakir, 2004), separate soil-moisture thresholds
    are often defined for each stage. AquaCrop-OSPy defines four such soil-moisture
    thresholds corresponding to emergence, early-season canopy development, mid-season
    crop growth, and late-season canopy senescence. The optimal set of thresholds
    will be those that maximize a particular value (e.g., profits or water productivity)
    for a given production environment (e.g., combination of crop type, soil type,
    climate conditions). This approach is similar to previous research that found
    profit-maximizing soil-moisture thresholds in AquaCrop either by optimization
    or direct search (Linker et al., 2016, Young et al., 2021, Kelly et al., 2021).
    For our analysis, the seasonal profit resulting from strategy is calculated at
    the end of each season via (1) where M is a crop market price [$ per tonne], is
    crop yield [tonne per ha], C is a constant irrigation cost [$ per ha-mm], is total
    seasonal irrigation applied [ha-mm], and is fixed production costs [$ per ha].
    The first stage of the analysis is to define the irrigation scheduling strategy
    (set of four soil-moisture thresholds) that maximizes seasonal profit (Eq. 1)
    for each weather year considered for a given case study. This process produces
    an optimal set of soil-moisture thresholds for each year, which we will refer
    to as the potential strategy. The resulting profits and water use from the potential
    strategy provides an estimate of what the farmer could achieve if they knew the
    weather perfectly in advance in all years, and adjusted their irrigation strategy
    accordingly based on this information. These potential profits therefore represent
    an estimated upper limit for the benefits of adapting irrigation scheduling during
    the season, comparable to prior studies that have optimized irrigation scheduling
    under perfect weather foresight (e.g., Schütze et al., 2012; Linker et al., 2016).
    In reality, farmers do not know the seasons’ weather with perfect foresight and
    irrigation scheduling decisions therefore have to be made under climate uncertainty.
    One way to deal with this uncertainty is to define a single strategy (i.e., a
    set of thresholds) that maximizes the average profit across all possible years
    (e.g., as observed in the historic weather record). In the second part of the
    analysis, we identify this single average-profit maximizing strategy for our climate
    years by maximizing the expected (i.e., average) value of P over a set of weather
    years. This average-profit maximizing strategy will be referred to as the fixed
    strategy for the remainder of the article. Applying this same fixed strategy across
    all years provides a baseline for the profits that can be achieved without adapting
    irrigation strategies during the season. The difference between the potential
    profits and fixed profits thus gives an estimated upper bound on the value of
    adaptive irrigation strategies. For both the single fixed strategy and the multi-year
    potential strategy, the differential evolution global optimizer within the scipy.optimize
    python package (Virtanen et al., 2020) will be used to find the optimal set of
    soil-moisture thresholds. Although any algorithm can be used in principle, differential
    evolution was chosen due to its superior performance during initial tests against
    other optimizers within the scipy.optimize package. 2.3. Re-optimizing irrigation
    strategies within the season The goal of adaptive intraseasonal irrigation scheduling
    is to close the gap between fixed (same strategy used for all years) and potential
    (perfect adjustment to each year’s weather) management strategies. To assess the
    value of adapting irrigation strategies within season, we define an adaptive simulation-optimization
    framework (Fig. 1) similar to that used in previous research (Cai et al., 2011,
    Jamal et al., 2019, Linker, 2021). In this framework, the simulation is paused
    at various points within the season, and the irrigation strategy is re-optimized
    from this starting point. Weather up to the current date is known with certainty
    as it has already been observed by the farmer, and expectations of future weather
    for the remainder of the season are specified based on the full ensemble of historic
    weather years. Download : Download high-res image (201KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. Adaptation and re-optimization framework. For each climate
    year, a crop model is initialized for the chosen cropping system. The previously
    optimized fixed strategy is then implemented during the first stage of crop growth.
    The model’s current state is then saved, and a new irrigation strategy is optimized
    that results in the highest average profits over all the climate years, assuming
    the model starts at its current starting point. After finding the strategy that
    maximizes average profit, this new strategy will be implemented for the next growth
    stage and the process is repeated again. Once the end of the season has been reached,
    seasonal profits will be calculated using Eq. 1. We assume that irrigation decisions
    are re-optimized at the start of each growth stage to match the temporal disaggregation
    of decision heuristics commonly used by farmers and agronomists. Therefore, we
    first simulate crop development from planting to the end of the first crop growth
    stage implementing the fixed irrigation strategy for each weather year. At the
    start of the next growth stage, a new profit maximizing irrigation strategy is
    then found for the remainder of the season using the optimization procedure described
    in Section 2.2. The resulting strategy is implemented over the second growth stage,
    after which the optimization is performed again. This process is repeated until
    the end of the season is reached, at which point the final profit is calculated
    using Eq. 1. 2.4. Case study We apply the framework presented above to the case
    study of center-pivot irrigated maize production in Nebraska, United States. Nebraska
    has the largest number of irrigated acres in the United States, with maize being
    the most dominant crop cultivated in the state (USDA-NASS, 2018). Irrigation water
    in the region primarily comes from the High Plains Aquifer, which has experienced
    drawdown over recent decades (McGuire, 2017). Associated environmental externalities,
    such as streamflow depletion (Szilagyi, 2000) and damage to freshwater ecosystems
    (Palazzo and Brozović, 2014, Perkin et al., 2019), along with concerns about long-term
    sustainability of groundwater-dependent rural economies (Foster et al., 2017,
    Deines et al., 2020, Butler et al., 2020) mean improving agricultural water productivity
    is a key priority for policymakers and water managers. These local characteristics
    make this case study an ideal choice to examine the value of adaptive irrigation
    decisions. As described in Section 2.2, we first use the differential evolution
    optimization algorithm to find the set of soil-moisture thresholds that maximize
    average profit over a set of climate years. For this analysis, we use 37 years
    (1982–2018) of historical weather data recorded at a monitoring station in Champion,
    southwest Nebraska (HPRCC, 2016). The resulting optimal strategy (i.e., a set
    of thresholds) will be referred to as the fixed strategy. For each of the 37 years,
    the optimal irrigation strategy for each individual year (referred to as potential
    strategy) will also be calculated to provide an upper limit on what profits could
    be achieved in a given year with perfect seasonal foresight of weather conditions.
    By taking the difference between the profits achieved by the potential and fixed
    strategy, we can evaluate how well the fixed strategy performs in each year as
    well as the possible increases that can be made by re-optimizing within the season.
    To ensure the fixed and potential strategies were as close to the global optimum
    as possible, 50 repetitions of each optimization were performed, and we selected
    the strategy achieving maximum profits across all repeat optimizations (Table
    S1). The number of repetitions was selected to balance computational burden with
    optimization convergence (Figure S1). During initial tests, we found that use
    of irrigation was never optimal during the final growth stage (i.e., crop senescence)
    for our case study crop and climate. To simplify the solution space for the optimization
    problem, this final soil-moisture threshold was therefore set to zero for fixed,
    potential and adaptive irrigation strategies. As a result, only two re-optimizations
    were performed in the season (at the start of growth-stage two and three) when
    re-optimizing on a growth stage basis. The adaptation framework (Fig. 1) for each
    climate year was repeated 25 times to ensure that a single sub-optimal optimization
    did not affect results. However, we still included the results from all of these
    adaption repetitions as it captures the reality that a producer will never know
    ahead of time what the true optimum strategy is. AquaCrop-OSPy crop-growth parameters
    for maize are summarized in Foster et al. (2015), and are re-stated in Table 1.
    The soil was chosen to be a clay loam, a dominant soil type in the region (CropWatch,
    2018) with soil hydraulic parameters taken from the AquaCrop-OSPy default parameters.
    When calculating profits with Eq. 1, a constant crop price of $180 per tonne was
    used based on a 10-year average of US maize grain prices (USDA, 2019). Irrigation
    costs were set at $1 per ha-mm ($10.28 per acre-inch) based on estimates from
    the 2019 Nebraska Crop Budget Report (CropWatch, 2019). This report also provides
    estimates for non-irrigation production costs (e.g., labour, materials, taxes),
    which allows us to set the fixed production cost in Eq. 1 to $1728 ha−1. Further
    details on model parameters and code implementation can be found by viewing the
    full source code available at (https://github.com/thomasdkelly/adaptive-irrigation).

    The value of adapting irrigation decisions within the growing season may be influenced
    by several factors. First, in regions experiencing water scarcity for regulatory
    restrictions, the amount of water farmers are able to extract for irrigation purposes
    is increasingly being restricted as part of water conservation and sustainability
    initiatives and policies. These restrictions pose issues for producers globally
    including our case study region. For example, the Upper Republican Natural Resource
    District (where our case study location resides) has imposed a five-year (2018–2022)
    groundwater allocation of 65 acre-inches per hectare (URNRD, 2019). These sorts
    of restrictions could reduce the value of adaptive irrigation strategies as producers
    will be less able to flexibly react to the unfolding season. We therefore repeated
    the main analysis (growth-stage adaptation) including a cap on the amount of irrigation
    that can be applied in a given season. This cap was applied in all years, preventing
    any further irrigation events if the total application within the current season
    reached the cap. This additional analysis was performed over a range of seasonal
    caps from 75 to 550 mm ha−1. For each cap, new optimal fixed strategies were determined,
    and then these were used to assess the value of adapting the strategies within
    the season (Table S2). Another factor that may influence the value of adaptive
    irrigation scheduling is the frequency with which farmers are able to re-optimize
    decisions. As stated in Section 2.4, there are only three opportunities – two
    when considering no irrigation is allowed in the final stage for our case study
    system – to re-optimize the strategy during the season within our growth-stage
    adaptation framework. We hypothesize that being able to adapt at more frequent
    intervals would lead to further increases in profits compared to the few opportunities
    allowed by our framework. We therefore conducted an additional analysis where
    our simulation-optimization framework was adjusted to allow re-optimizations to
    occur every seven days. Although other frequencies could also be evaluated, seven
    days was chosen to balance the complexity of the strategy with additional computational
    demand, as well as matching previous work that used similar simulation-optimization
    frameworks (Cai et al., 2011, Jamal et al., 2019). The first re-optimization will
    therefore occur on day 7 of each season and re-optimizations will stop after day
    120, resulting in 17 different sets of thresholds being implemented throughout
    the season. Note that the choice of day 120 of the season as the final date for
    re-optimization was because this day falls after the start of the final growth
    stage (when irrigation is always zero), but this date could be varied to any other
    value in alternative model case studies or applications. Finally, as noted earlier,
    the ability to effectively update irrigation decisions may also be influenced
    by the quality of information available to a farmer about weather conditions in
    the days or weeks ahead. In our main analysis, re-optimization is performed over
    the same set of weather years used in the fixed strategy. Producers must therefore
    hedge the irrigation strategy against all 37 potential weather scenarios for the
    remainder of the season. In reality, some of these years will be more probable
    than others given weather so far and available forecasts. The seven-day adaptation
    framework described above was therefore further adjusted to include a seven-day
    perfect forecast. Beyond those seven days, the producer must again hedge across
    all 37 weather years. The seven-day lead time for the perfect forecast was chosen
    to match previous work (Jamal et al., 2019). We hypothesize that including the
    seven-day perfect forecast will increase profits compared to the standard seven-day
    adaptation due to the greater ability to tune irrigation decisions to the weather
    ahead for a given season. 3. Results 3.1. Differences between fixed and potential
    strategies The first part of this analysis used the differential evolution optimization
    algorithm to find a set of soil-moisture thresholds that maximized average profits
    over 37 climate years, with the resulting set of thresholds being referred to
    as the fixed strategy. The potential strategies (i.e., profit-maximizing strategies
    for each individual year) were also calculated to give an estimated upper limit
    for what profits could be achieved with perfect seasonal information (Table S1).
    A comparison between the average profits achieved by the fixed ($426/ha) and potential
    ($459/ha) strategies finds that the fixed strategy achieved 92.7 % of the average
    potential profit (Fig. 2a). In other words, having perfect foresight of weather
    conditions in each year results in a 7.7 % increase in farm profits. Download

    Seasonal profits achieved by the fixed strategy expressed as a percentage of the
    potential profits for that year: (a) for all 37 years, (b) as a function of total
    rainfall (excluding the year 2012). Comparable results (not shown) were also obtained
    when using the seasonal water balance (precipitation minus crop evapotranspiration)
    as a predictor. Looking more closely at each individual climate year, there is
    only one year (2012) in which the fixed strategy does not achieve at least 80
    % of the potential profits (Fig. 2a). This year was one of extreme drought (less
    than 43 mm of rainfall during the growing season) and so appears to be sacrificed
    by the optimizer in favour of maximizing average profits across all remaining
    years. Focusing instead on the other 36 non-drought years, regression analysis
    indicates that 40 % of the variation in the performance of the fixed strategy
    can be explained by the total seasonal rainfall (Fig. 2b). The fixed strategy
    performs better (in terms of percentage of potential profits) in the wetter years
    than the drier years. Using the fixed strategy as a starting point, the framework
    described in Section 2.3 aims to assess whether adapting the strategy within the
    season will increase these fixed profits towards the potential profits. 3.2. The
    value of within-season adaptation To assess the value of re-optimizing irrigation
    strategies within the season, the fixed irrigation strategy (set of soil-moisture
    thresholds) was re-optimized at the start of each growth stage following the re-optimization
    approach described in Section 2.3. After running this framework for all 37 climate
    years, the profits from this adaptive strategy can be compared to the fixed profits
    to determine the added value of this adaptive approach to scheduling. On average,
    our analysis found a $4.87 ha−1 increase in profits with adaptation, which translates
    to a 1 % increase in average profit compared to the fixed strategy that does not
    incorporate any adaptation of irrigation management rules during the growing season.
    However, we also observe that growth-stage adaptation also increased the minimum
    profits by 106 % and decreased the standard deviation in profits by 2.95 %. The
    large increase in minimum profits can be attributed to the drought year 2012,
    where in-season adaptation increases the soil-moisture thresholds, causing additional
    irrigation events and profit increases. By inspecting the irrigation schedule
    time series for this year, we see the impact of this change in soil-moisture thresholds
    on the soil-water content and the timing of irrigation events (Fig. 3). Changes
    to the minimum profits and profit variance may have important implications for
    some farmers, in particular where there is a need to minimize risks associated
    with extremely low yields in individual years as opposed to simply looking to
    maximize average profits over multiple years. These implications will be further
    discussed later in Section 4.1. Download : Download high-res image (596KB) Download

    (c) growth-stage adaptation strategy. When the soil-moisture content drops below
    the irrigation threshold, irrigation is triggered. The depth of irrigation and
    rainfall events are shown in purple and brown bars respectively. This season represents
    one of the 25 repetitions. Several factors are important drivers of the value
    added from in-season adaptation of irrigation scheduling rules. First, we find
    that the quality of the starting strategy – defined as how close the fixed strategy
    mean profit is to the potential strategy in a given year – explains 39 % of the
    variation in adaptation value (Fig. 3a). This relationship shows that adaptation
    value is lower in years where the fixed strategy is already close to the potential
    optimal for that year. In addition, by assessing the relationship between seasonal
    rainfall and adaptation value, we find that adaptation value is inversely proportional
    to the total seasonal rainfall. However, our analysis indicates that seasonal
    rainfall only explains 14 % of the variation in adaptation value (Fig. 3b). As
    well total rainfall, how the rainfall is distributed over the season is also shown
    to impact optimal irrigation strategies. Specifically, we find that the coefficient
    of variation (CV) in daily rainfall (i.e., standard deviation in daily rainfall
    / mean daily rainfall) explains 19 % of the variation in adaptation value (Fig.
    3c). Both of these relationships indicate that when rainfall is scarce or more
    variable, the value of within-season adaptation is greater. Inspecting irrigation
    schedule time series for specific individual years also provides additional insights
    about why in-season adaption is beneficial in some years and not in others. For
    example, Fig. 5 compares the irrigation events triggered by the fixed (Fig. 5a),
    potential (Fig. 5b) and growth-stage adaptation (Fig. 5c) strategies during the
    1999 growing-season simulation, where adaptation decreased seasonal profits by
    $30 ha−1 (the largest decrease for any year). Overall, during both the second
    and third growth stage, the adaptive strategy made minor adjustments to the soil-moisture
    threshold towards the potential threshold. One would expect that such an adjustment
    (towards the perfect information strategy) would increase profits – as it does
    for the year 2012 – however this does not occur in the year 1999. This slightly
    counterintuitive result can likely be attributed to having to optimize decisions
    under future weather uncertainty, as one can never know what the exact optimal
    set of thresholds are until the entire season has passed. Changes to the soil
    moisture thresholds are unable to perfectly replicate irrigation schedules under
    the potential strategy with perfect foresight, with two extra irrigation events
    being triggered on days 89 and 90 for the adaptive strategy. This reduces overall
    profits for the season, demonstrating that, without perfect knowledge of the full
    seasons’ weather beforehand, there will always be the possibility for maladaptive
    behavior (e.g., the adjustments made in 1999) during some years. Download : Download

    and forecast information on adaptation value As described in Section 2.5, two
    further analyses were conducted to test whether adaptation frequency and quality
    of forecast information impacted the value of re-optimization. Allowing re-optimization
    of irrigation strategies every seven days lead to a $2.25 ha−1 increase in profits
    compared to growth-stage re-optimization, achieving 93.69 % of the potential profits
    over the 37 climate years (Fig. 6a). By including a perfect seven-day weather
    forecast within this seven-day re-optimization framework, average profits were
    increased by a further $13.4 ha−1 compared to the standard seven-day re-optimization,
    achieving 97.28 % of potential profits. Download : Download high-res image (216KB)

    37 climate years for each adaptation strategy. This quantity is also displayed
    as a percentage of average potential profits. (b) Seasonal profits for each climate
    year expressed as a percentage of the potential profits for each adaptation strategy.
    These analyses confirmed our hypothesis that re-optimizing more frequently, in
    particular when combined with better information about weather conditions in the
    days ahead, increases the benefits that can be derived from in-season adaptation.
    As well as changes to average profits, we also see changes in profit variance
    with adaptation. Switching from the growth-stage adaptation to seven-day adaptation
    increases the minimum profits by 15.8 % and reduces the standard deviation in
    profits by 2.56 % compared to growth-stage adaptation (Fig. 6b). Adding a perfect
    seven-day weather forecast to the seven-day adaptation strategy further increases
    the minimum profits by 29.2 % compared to the seven-day adaptation strategy without
    perfect weekly forecasts. An additional notable effect of introducing perfect
    weekly forecasts to the seven-day adaptation strategy is that there are eight
    years where the seven-day adaptation with perfect weekly forecast outperforms
    the potential strategy. This result indicates the limitations of how we have chosen
    to define the potential strategy, which – despite having perfect seasonal weather
    information – still only contains one fixed set of thresholds for the season.
    In comparison, the seven-day adaptation strategy contains 17 sets of thresholds
    that are calculated as the season progresses. The ability to vary soil moisture
    targets within – rather than just between – growth stages allows for more complex
    irrigation management strategies to emerge, sometimes resulting in higher profits
    despite the farmer not having access to perfect information about weather for
    the entire season. To demonstrate an example of when the seven-day strategy with
    perfect weekly forecast outperformed the potential strategy, we compare the individual
    irrigation events triggered by the fixed (Fig. 7a), potential (Fig. 7b) and seven-day
    adaptation with perfect weekly forecast (Fig. 7c) strategies for the climate year
    1992. The flexibility enabled by the seven-day adaptation period initially allows
    an increase in the first growth-stage threshold (Fig. 7c), meaning that irrigation
    events for the potential and adaptive strategies were identical for the first
    45 days (Fig. 7b, c). After this initial period, the two strategies diverge as
    the adaptive strategy sticks closer to the fixed strategy (with the flexibility
    to adjust as required), whereas the potential thresholds diverge massively during
    the second growth stage in particular. Download : Download high-res image (561KB)

    thresholds across the 1992 growing season for (a) fixed strategy, (b) potential
    strategy, (c) seven-day adaptation strategy with perfect weekly forecast. When
    the soil-moisture content drops below the irrigation threshold, irrigation is
    triggered. The depth of irrigation and rainfall events are shown in purple and
    brown bars respectively. Although the seven-day adaptation strategy with perfect
    weekly forecast occasionally outperformed the potential strategy, there are still
    a handful of years where it also performed worse than the fixed strategy (Figure
    S2). As stated in the previous section, this effect is the result of having to
    optimize irrigation strategies under uncertainty about weather beyond the seven-day
    forecast, and is not the result of the optimization approach or choice of strategy.
    However, switching from the growth-stage adaptation to the seven-day adaptation
    increased does profits in these years. This result implies that more complex irrigation
    strategies that also incorporate more accurate weather information can help reduce
    the risk of profit losses from these maladaptive events, even when knowledge of
    weather conditions for the remainder of the season remains unknown or uncertain.
    3.4. The impact of water constraints on adaptation value Regulatory or hydrologic
    restrictions on irrigation water supply are a common consequence of water scarcity
    and conflict in many regions, including our study area in the central United States.
    We therefore explored how the value of adaptation was affected by the introduction
    of annual caps on total seasonal irrigation that, once reached, would prevent
    any further irrigation being applied during the season. By introducing a seasonal
    irrigation cap of 300 mm ha−1, average seasonal profits achieved by the fixed
    strategy decrease by $82 ha−1 in comparison to the $426 ha−1 achieved when water
    use was unrestricted. As annual water quotas increase, profits increase towards
    the unrestricted fixed profits. For the 300 mm ha−1 limit, the average value of
    adaptation was $1.49 ha−1. This value increases linearly with an increasing seasonal
    water allocation reaching a benefit of $4.87 ha−1 achieved when water use is unrestricted
    (Fig. 8a). These results imply that restrictions on yearly water use actually
    decrease the value of adaption. A possible intuition for this result is that having
    more water available during the season allows greater flexibility for the re-optimization
    process to adapt within the season. Download : Download high-res image (257KB)

    standard deviation between years. (b) Distribution of adaption value between years
    for each irrigation cap. Each point represents a single year averaged over multiple
    simulation repetitions. For more severe restrictions on water use (i.e., quotas
    less than 300 mm ha−1), impacts of adaptation begin to vary significantly from
    year to year as well on average, with large benefits in some years and large costs
    in others (Fig. 8b). These results show that while some benefits may still be
    derived from adaptation under highly restrictive water use limits, the variation
    in outcomes and potential for maladaptive responses is large. In contrast to the
    analyses without water use restrictions presented previously (Fig. 4), we find
    no relationship between adaptation value and weather conditions under severe water
    use restrictions. Specifically, the r2 between adaptation value and total rainfall
    for the most restrictive caps (75, 100, 125 mm ha−1) were all found to be less
    than 0.02. Similarly, the r2 between adaptation value and CV in daily rainfall
    for these caps were also found to be less than 0.02. Therefore, whether or not
    adaptation leads to extreme benefits or costs appears to be mostly down to luck
    for these extreme water use limits. 4. Discussion Optimization of irrigation scheduling,
    including through in-season adaptation of scheduling rules based on weather forecasts
    and other data, have been widely proposed as a means of improving agricultural
    water productivity in water-scarce regions globally (e.g., Wang and Cai, 2009;
    Cai et al., 2011; Hejazi et al., 2014; Jamal et al., 2018, Jamal et al., 2019;
    Linker, 2021). By linking a crop model to our re-optimization framework, this
    article aimed to assess the value of adapting irrigation strategies within the
    season, and how this value is affected by typical information constraints (e.g.,
    in-season weather) and management constraints (e.g., abstraction restrictions)
    commonly faced by farmers but not adequately considered in past research (e.g.,
    Wang and Cai, 2009; Cai et al., 2011; Jamal et al., 2019). For a case study of
    maize production in a water stressed region of south-west Nebraska in the United
    States, our analysis demonstrated that a farmer adopting a fixed irrigation strategy
    (i.e., where rules are the same for each year) was able to achieve 92.7 % of the
    average potential profit achievable with perfect seasonal weather foresight. In-season
    re-optimization of fixed irrigation strategies based on information gained about
    weather conditions as the seasonal unfolds was able to marginally increase average
    profits to 93.8 % or 94.3 % of potential profits depending on how frequently farmers
    choose, or are able to, adapt irrigation strategies within the season. We demonstrate
    that value of in-season adaptive re-optimization of irrigation heuristics is enhanced
    when farmers have access to perfect weather forecasts for the week ahead, for
    which the producer is able to achieve 97.2 % of potential profits. Adaptive scheduling
    also universally reduced risks of crop loss or failure events (e.g., during extreme
    drought years such as 2012 in our study area), but with greatest risk reduction
    benefits found when re-optimization is supported by in-season forecasts. By introducing
    seasonal water quotas, our analysis showed that the variability in adaptation
    value between years increased dramatically for extremely restrictive water quotas.
    4.1. Implications for research, producers and industry Our results build upon
    previous work that aimed to optimize irrigation strategies within crop models
    using adaptive re-optimization during the growing season (e.g., Wang and Cai,
    2009; Cai et al., 2011; Hejazi et al., 2014; Jamal et al., 2018, Jamal et al.,
    2019; Linker, 2021). These works did not include an optimized fixed strategy with
    which to compare the value of adaptive irrigation strategies. As a result, these
    studies are likely to have overstated the true potential benefits of adaptive
    in-season irrigation scheduling, with our results demonstrating that the majority
    of potential profits can be achieved with simpler optimal average irrigation heuristics.
    Our findings are also consistent with other evidence about the value of adaptive
    agricultural decision making in the literature. For example, Jones et al. (2000)
    showed that optimization of crop management practices for maize (e.g., planting
    date, crop density, nitrogen application) based on seasonal climate forecasts
    increased average seasonal profits by only $16–26 ha−1 (3–4 %) depending on the
    case-study region when compared with fixed management rules based on a range of
    historic weather years. Our findings thus highlight the importance of comparing
    adaptive strategies to similarly optimized fixed strategies, which may provide
    a more efficient means of scheduling irrigation when technological, logistical
    and cognitive costs associated with implementing more complex data-driven adaptive
    scheduling practices are taken into account. A key finding of our analysis is
    that there is likely to be substantial heterogeneity in the economic benefits
    of adaptive irrigation scheduling across years, with some years potentially experiencing
    declines in profits when strategies are re-optimized within the season. This type
    of maladaptation was also found in Hejazi et al. (2014) and occurs as a result
    of underlying uncertainty about future weather, along with the complex non-linear
    responses of crop growth and yield development to soil-moisture patterns during
    the season. Unless the entire season’s weather is known with a high degree of
    certainty in advance, it is extremely challenging for a farmer to determine which
    irrigation strategy will reliably lead to the largest profits. Even if one strategy
    is superior on average, there will be some years where an alternative strategy
    results in higher profits. The season-to-season variability in profits also highlights
    that instead of evaluating irrigation strategies on as few as 5 climate years
    – as is common in previous work (Wang and Cai, 2009, Cai et al., 2011, Hejazi
    et al., 2014, Jamal et al., 2018, Jamal et al., 2019) – researchers must use quantities
    approaching 30 in order to fully capture local weather characteristics and thus
    accurately evaluate outcomes of adaptive decision-making or the value of data
    (e.g., forecasts). Our analysis found that some of the year-to-year variability
    in benefits from adaptive irrigation scheduling could be explained by the quality
    of the starting strategy, total rainfall during the season, and the coefficient
    of variation of daily rainfall during the season. These relationships suggested
    that in years with less rainfall, or where rainfall is unevenly distributed during
    the season, the economic value of adaptive scheduling will be higher. This is
    particularly relevant given climate change is predicted to increase the frequency
    of weather extremes in many regions (IPCC, 2022). Our analysis also found that
    adaptive strategies did cause an increase in minimum profits and decrease in profit
    variance over the 37 years. For more risk-averse farmers who cannot simply seek
    to maximize average profits, this reduction may provide enough motivation to invest
    in adaptive strategies. However, the presence of other safety nets, for example
    crop insurance schemes, could decrease the value of adaptive scheduling practices
    as farmers will be financially protected against some of the consequences in the
    driest years. The strong performance of both fixed and adaptive irrigation strategies
    relative to theoretical potential profits is in part due to specifying a strategy
    made up of four soil-moisture thresholds, one for each major growth stage. Kelly
    et al. (2021) found that choosing a simpler strategy made up of just one soil-moisture
    threshold for the entire growing season led to a $120 ha−1 decrease in profits
    compared to the four soil-moisture threshold strategy as done in our analysis.
    This decrease is three times larger than the profit difference found between the
    fixed and potential strategies in our analysis. Crop models and simulation-optimization
    frameworks such as that used in the present article are vital for designing and
    optimizing these irrigation strategies, which can also be replicated for many
    crops and production environments. Over time, however, these optimal strategies
    will need to be updated to ensure the historical weather years used to optimize
    the strategy reflect changes in the likely range of weather scenarios that will
    occur in the upcoming season. For example, changes in the variability of expected
    weather outcomes due to climate change will likely reduce the performance of fixed
    strategies and enhance benefits of adaptive scheduling if these shifts in climate
    variability are not accounted for when designing fixed irrigation management rules.
    4.2. Framework limitations and future directions While our analysis provides valuable
    insights about the potential value of adaptive in-season irrigation scheduling
    for improving agricultural productivity and profitability, it is important to
    highlight several key simplifications in our analysis. First, an assumption made
    in our analysis is that the re-optimization framework considers the hypothetical
    farmer to have perfect knowledge of the current state of the soil water balance
    and crop growth (e.g., yield, canopy cover, rooting depth). However, in the real
    world, farmers may not have perfect information about current field conditions,
    or be able to predict with certainty how crop development will be affected by
    different potential weather scenarios. As a result, the real-world value of within-season
    adaptation is likely to be even lower than found in our analysis as the re-optimization
    of irrigation strategies will be influenced not only by uncertainty in weather
    conditions for the days and weeks ahead, but also by uncertainties in the current
    status of crop growth and soil moisture. These additional uncertainties are likely
    to increase the potential for maladaptive irrigation scheduling responses to occur,
    in particular where capacity for irrigation water use is limited by regulatory,
    hydrologic, or socio-economic constraints. However, further research is needed
    to quantify the magnitude of this effect, as previous research (e.g., Kelly et
    al., 2021) has found that perfect knowledge of the field and climate conditions
    is not required for near-optimal irrigation scheduling. To balance computational
    time and resources, our analysis focused on a selection of key factors (adaptation
    frequency, foresight of near-future weather, abstraction restrictions) that we
    hypothesized may be important determinants of the value of adaptive irrigation
    scheduling approaches. Nonetheless, other factors not analysed in the present
    paper may also influence the value of adaptive scheduling. For example, if the
    baseline fixed irrigation strategy is sub-optimal or poorly defined (Kelly et
    al., 2021), there may be greater value in updating this strategy throughout the
    season. The presence of multi-year quotas, rather than the single-year quotas
    considered in the present article, may also affect the value of adaptation as
    in-season decisions have implications for water availability in later years and
    thus make the optimization process both an intra- and inter-seasonal problem (Young
    et al., 2021). Furthermore, the presence of financial safety nets such as crop
    insurance (USDA, 2022, Suchato et al., 2022) may reduce the value of adaptation
    as outlier drought years, in which the largest benefits of adaptation are observed
    in this study, will result in profit losses that are less severe for farmers.
    Finally, it is important to acknowledge that results presented in this study are
    dependent on the ability of the underlying crop-water model to accurately represent
    real-world crop responses to soil moisture deficits, weather conditions, and irrigation
    management practices. AquaCrop has been shown to adequately capture maize yield
    responses to water stress within our study area and the United States generally
    (Heng et al., 2009, Sandhu and Irmak, 2019). Further research should extend the
    analysis presented here to consider how the value of adaptive irrigation scheduling
    is influenced by the choice of underlying crop model and parameterization, including
    to consider potentially important differences that may exist across different
    crop varieties (e.g., more/less drought tolerant), soil types (e.g., higher/lower
    water holding capacity), or climatic regimes (e.g., greater/lesser rainfall variability).
    5. Conclusions The aim of this manuscript was to assess the potential added value
    of in-season adaptation of irrigation scheduling practices for improving productivity
    and profitability of agricultural water use under climate uncertainty. For a case
    study of maize production in Nebraska, our analysis demonstrates the vast majority
    of the potential profits can be achieved by adopting a fixed irrigation strategy
    that is optimized pre-season to account for expected variability in weather outcomes
    but which is not adjusted within each year. Increases in average profit, as well
    as decreases in profit variance, are possible by re-optimizing this strategy within
    the season, with the size of this increase dependent on the potential frequency
    of adaptation and foresight of weather for the days ahead. However, the overall
    magnitude of these increased returns are small, even in the presence of restrictions
    on total seasonal water use by farmers. As a result, our findings suggest that
    farmers and water managers may be better to prioritize the adoption of simpler
    average irrigation scheduling heuristics that are well optimized to local production
    conditions and constraints. In doing so, farmers are likely to achieve the majority
    of the potential gains in crop yields and water use savings, while also minimizing
    costs associated with implementing more complex adaptive scheduling approaches
    and avoiding potential risks of maladaptive outcomes. Declaration of Competing

    II 1. Introduction The depletion of water resources gradually reduces the amount
    of water available for agricultural irrigation, which seriously impedes sustainable
    socioeconomic development (Dadrasan et al., 2015, Sun et al., 2016). Therefore,
    creating an irrigation schedule to increase crop yield and water use efficiency
    (WUE) is essential for mitigating the problem of limited water supply under high
    irrigation requirements. Allocating limited water resources during crop growth
    periods to maximize benefits (e.g., crop yields, WUE) is the key to determining
    irrigation schedules (Abrishambaf et al., 2020). Both crop yield and WUE are affected
    by environmental and managerial factors (Amouzou et al., 2018). Field experiments
    play an integral role in the monitoring of crop yield and WUE (Gheysari et al.,
    2015). However, they are often time-consuming and labor-intensive. Combining crop
    growth simulation models with field experiments is a powerful means of exploring
    such management measures. Once a crop model has been parameterized and validated,
    it can be employed to support the analysis and interpretation of field experiments.
    It can also be used to extrapolate experimental results under a wider range of
    managerial practices and weather conditions, as well as to derive efficient irrigation
    management strategies (He et al., 2012, Linker and Kisekka, 2017, Malik et al.,
    2019). These studies in which crop models are employed for irrigation scheduling
    are generally based on orthogonal tests or on several established irrigation schedules,
    making it difficult to derive the optimal irrigation schedule. This problem can
    be solved by pairing crop growth models with optimization algorithms. Employing
    the AquaCrop model, calibrated at the field scale, Li et al. (2018) developed
    a simulation and optimization model for crop irrigation scheduling and net income
    maximization. Similarly, Mwiya et al. (2020) presented a multiobjective irrigation
    scheduling optimization problem that was solved based on AquaCrop and the nondominated
    sorting genetic algorithm version II (NSGA-II). The objectives were to maximize
    net income and WUE and to minimize the risk of total gross margin reduction attributable
    to in-season weather variations. To maximize maize yield and minimize nitrogen
    leaching, (Kropp et al., 2019) optimized irrigation and fertilization schedules
    by combining the unified nondominated sorting genetic algorithm version III with
    the CERES-Maize model. These crop models calibrated according to field experiments
    can accurately simulate the growth of crops at a single point. However, crop models
    calibrated on the basis of field-scale experiments lack the ability for spatial
    representation; they are unable to fully consider the spatial variability of crops,
    soil, meteorological conditions, and field management options. This limits the
    ability of such models to generate reasonable irrigation schedules at the regional
    scale. Geographic information system (GIS) technology has provided opportunities
    for the regional application of crop models. This technology can comprehensively
    analyze spatial changes in factors such as soil and climate and divide the nonuniform
    growth environment of crops into homogeneous units (Kim and Kisekka, 2021, Wang
    et al., 2021b). Kim and Kisekka (2021) demonstrated how to transform the Decision
    Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) software program (Hoogenboom
    et al., 2010, Jones et al., 2003) into an available web-based decision support
    tool for near real-time simulation with the aid of open-source GIS technology.
    Wang et al. (2021b) developed a distributed AquaCrop framework for irrigation
    water resource management under uncertain conditions to overcome the difficulty
    of accurately simulating regional crop yield. This problem is attributable to
    the effects of spatial heterogeneity in soil, weather conditions, crop types,
    and other factors. Based on future climate scenario data, Jabeen et al. (2017)
    used the CERES-Wheat model to simulate wheat yields in the Pothwar Plateau of
    Pakistan from 2011 to 2090. They then imported the CERES-Wheat simulation results
    into ArcGIS software to assess the impact of climate change on wheat yields at
    the spatial scale. These studies have reduced the uncertainty of crop models in
    spatial simulations ascribable to the spatial variability in soil, meteorology,
    and field management in environments supporting crop growth. However, the variability
    of crop-related parameters can also affect the simulation accuracy of crop models
    (Han et al., 2019, Jin et al., 2016). Therefore, incorporating these parameters
    into the construction of distributed crop models is necessary. The development
    of remote sensing technology has enabled surface information to be characterized
    in detail; these characteristics serve as spatially continuous input data (e.g.,
    planting structure, and crop growth indicators) for the regional application of
    crop models. Therefore, the coupling of remote sensing information and crop models
    may make the crop models more accurate when used in regional applications. Approaches
    for such coupling can be categorized into drive methods and data assimilation
    methods (Gaso et al., 2019, Han et al., 2019, Pique et al., 2020). The cost function–based
    parameter optimization method is a prominent data assimilation method (Huang et
    al., 2015, Jin et al., 2020, Wu et al., 2021). It minimizes the cost function
    in a time window through the optimization algorithm and iteratively determines
    the input parameters of the crop model (e.g., genetic coefficients) for the simulation
    unit. Using maize cultivar coefficients and field management parameters as optimization
    parameters, Jin et al. (2016) designed a variational assimilation scheme. They
    employed the very fast simulated annealing optimization algorithm to assimilate
    reflectance products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer into
    the CERES-Maize model and estimate the LAI at a regional scale. With the genetic
    parameters and field management parameters of winter wheat as optimization parameters,
    Li et al. (2015) used particle swarm optimization to integrate remote sensing
    data into the CERES-Wheat model for estimating the grain yield and protein content
    of winter wheat. Crop parameters determined by assimilating remote sensing data
    and crop growth models have been extensively applied in crop yield estimation
    and crop growth monitoring but have yet to be applied to irrigation schedule generation.
    The development of irrigation schedules for crops grown in specific regions requires
    an understanding of local soil conditions, meteorological conditions, and field
    management measures (Guo et al., 2021). Although meteorological variables contain
    high spatiotemporal heterogeneity, they typically conform to a specific probability
    distribution (Li et al., 2018). Therefore, some researchers have determined representative
    meteorological scenarios on the basis of precipitation probability distributions
    and then designed irrigation schedules accordingly (Guo et al., 2021, Mwiya et
    al., 2020). Notably, the design of such irrigation schedules hinges not only on
    precipitation during crop growth but also on the crop evapotranspiration (Liu
    and Yang, 2021). In other words, precipitation and crop evapotranspiration information
    should be comprehensively considered to determine meteorological scenarios such
    that the generated irrigation schedule reflects water supply and crops’ water
    demand. This study focuses on the following work: (1) explore the feasibility
    of estimating the LAI of maize from backscattering information extracted from
    microwave remote sensing imagery; (2) examine the feasibility of assimilating
    the remote sensing data and the crop model for parameter determination and evaluate
    the crop model’s ability to simulate summer maize growth at a regional scale;
    (3) investigate the feasibility of using the copula function to quantify the two-dimensional
    joint probability distribution of precipitation and ETo; and (4) assess the ability
    of the distributed crop model to formulate irrigation schedules for maize at a
    regional scale under various meteorological scenarios. Our main objective was
    to explore a framework integrating remote sensing data with crop models to determine
    crop parameters for distributed crop models and to develop methods for determining
    irrigation schedules at regional scale. 2. Materials and methods To clearly show
    the research process, the flowchart of this study is shown in Fig. 1. This study
    consisted of two parts. The first part involved the determination of crop parameters
    in the CERES-Maize model through data assimilation technology. We estimated the
    LAI of maize at various growth stages in the study area according to the measured
    LAI and microwave remote sensing data from the Sentinel-1 satellite. Subsequently,
    according to the existing calibration results of the CERES-Maize model, the Shuffled
    Complex Evolution University of Arizona (SCE-UA) algorithm was run to iteratively
    update the crop parameters in the CERES-Maize model until the gap between the
    LAI simulated by the crop model and the LAI estimated from the microwave remote
    sensing data was minimized. In the second part of the study, maize irrigation
    schedules were generated by the distributed CERES-Maize model under various meteorological
    scenarios. Nine meteorological scenarios were first established according to the
    marginal probability distribution of precipitation and ETo during the growth period
    of maize. Subsequently, the occurrence probabilities of these scenarios were calculated
    using the copula function. Finally, the NSGA-II algorithm was executed to obtain
    the irrigation schedule under each meteorological scenario. Details on the data
    and methods used are described in the following sections. Download : Download

    and ETo, respectively. L, M, and H refer to low, moderate, and high, respectively.
    Thus, PL-EL represents the scenario in which both precipitation and ETo are low.
    The meanings of the other scenario names can be determined according to this rationale.
    2.1. Study area The coordinates of the study area, located in Xianyang City, Shaanxi
    Province, China, are 107°64′ E–109°17′ E and 33°20′ N–35°54′ N (Fig. 2a). In Xianyang,
    which has a temperate and monsoonal climate, the average annual temperature is
    6–13 °C, and the average annual precipitation is 500–800 mm. The soil primarily
    has a silt loam texture. The average field capacity of the soil layer at 0–20
    m is 0.294 cm3/cm3, the permanent wilting point is 0.085 cm3/cm3, and the soil
    bulk density is 1.31 g/cm3. The cultivated soil (depth: 0–25 cm) has a pH value
    of 8.14, with an organic carbon content of 10.2 g/kg and total nitrogen content
    of 0.96 g/kg. Flood irrigation is the main irrigation method, and the groundwater
    depth is 5 m. Irrigated summer maize is the principal summer crop, and its sowing
    and harvesting periods are early June and early October, respectively. Download

    Study area and sampling plot distribution. Obtaining information on summer maize
    varieties in a large region is very difficult. However, according to our field
    survey in the study area, farmers whose fields are located within a certain geographical
    area often select similar crop varieties. Therefore, areas with relatively consistent
    crop growth conditions and growth environments can be divided into subregions,
    after which the parameters of subregional units can be determined (Guo et al.,
    2018). Considering the ability of the x-means algorithm to estimate the number
    of clusters (Pelleg and Moore, 2000), we used it to divide the study area into
    two subregions (MZ1 and MZ2) according to the normalized difference vegetation
    index (NDVI) of summer maize at the jointing stage and according to the silt and
    clay content (Fig. 2b). The soil data were sourced from the National Earth System
    Science Data Center (http://www.geodata.cn), which is managed by the National
    Science and Technology Infrastructure. The NDVI of summer maize was determined
    from Sentinel-2 data (see section 2.2.2 for details). Table 1 lists the descriptive
    statistics for the entire study area and for each subregion. The variation coefficients
    of silt content, clay content, and NDVI in each subregion were lower than the
    variation coefficients of each parameter in the entire study area, demonstrating
    the validity of dividing the study area into two subregions. Table 1. Descriptive

    2.2.1. Field data In this study, we chose DSSAT-CERES-Maize model to simulate
    maize growth. To obtain satisfactory simulation accuracy of the crop model at
    the field scale, field experiments were conducted during the summer maize growing
    season (June to October) in 2016 and 2017 at the Wugong experimental station (108°
    04′ E, 34° 17′ N; Fig. 2c). The variety of summer maize most commonly grown in
    the study area, Zhengdan 958, was planted. The planting density was 60,000 plants
    per hectare. Regarding the experimental setup, we employed a two-factor randomized
    complete block design with three replicates (involving three N rates and three
    irrigation levels). All 27 plots were kept free of weeds, insects, and disease
    with pesticide treatments based on the practices of local farmers. Data (LAI,
    soil water content, and yield) from the 2016 experiment were used to calibrate
    the CERES-Maize model at the field scale, and the same data from the 2017 experiment
    were used to validate the crop model. For more detailed information regarding
    the experiment, please refer to a study by (Wang et al., 2021a). The measured
    plant factors were the plant height, LAI, soil water content, and yield. We measured
    the plant height and LAI seven times during each growing season by using a meter
    with a precision of 1 mm. The length (collar to tip) and width (the widest point
    of the leaves) of all the leaves of the selected plant were measured. The area
    of a single leaf and the LAI were calculated using Eqs. (1) and (2): (1) where
    ASA is the area of a single leaf (m2); L and W are the length and width of the
    leaf in meters, respectively; and 0.75 is the regression coefficient of the leaf
    area as a function of the leaf shape. (2) where TA is the total area of a single
    maize plant in square meters and PD is the planting density (in plants per hectare).
    The soil water content was examined every 10–15 days during each of the two growing
    seasons through the use of the gravimetric method. With the center of each plot
    as the observation point, the soil water content was measured every 20 cm across
    a depth of 0–100 cm. The gravimetric soil water content was converted into the
    volumetric soil water content through multiplication by the bulk density of the
    soil (on a dry basis). The experimental plots were harvested after the maize had
    fully ripened, and yields were corrected to 14 % of the grain moisture content.
    Further, to calibrate the CERES-Maize model and determine the growth conditions
    of summer maize during different growth stages at a regional scale, we established
    25 sampling areas throughout Wugong County (Fig. 2c), which were located away
    from roads and trees, and monitored the maize plants from June to October 2020.
    The central position of each area was obtained from the global positioning system.
    Each area had three independent measurement points covering a 1 m × 1 m area,
    distributed over a 30 m × 30 m area. The LAI, plant height, and soil water content
    at a depth of 0–20 cm were measured at the jointing stage (July 16–18), late jointing
    stage (July 30–August 1), silking stage (August 20–22), early filling stage (September
    6–8), and filling stage (September 14–16). Yield was measured at maturity. The
    average of these variables at the three independent measurement points in each
    area was taken as the final value of those variables in that area. Because the
    LAI was used as an assimilation variable to link the remote sensing data with
    the crop model, the measured LAI was employed in constructing the LAI estimation
    model of the entire study area (see section 2.3.3 for details). The data on the
    LAI, soil water content, and yield were used to evaluate the accuracy of the distributed
    CERES-Maize model. Furthermore, data were collected on crop management in each
    field. This information included the irrigation time, irrigation amount, irrigation
    method, planting date, planting depth, plant spacing, plant density, and soil
    characteristics. 2.2.2. Remote sensing data The summer maize planted area was
    extracted based on the NDVI, normalized difference water index, and normalized
    difference built-up index derived from Sentinel-2 data. The Sentinel-2 mission
    delivers data from all land surfaces and coastal zones every 5 days. The Sentinel-2
    top-of-atmosphere (S2-TOA) data archived in Google Earth Engine have been subjected
    to radiometric and geometric correction. Based on the S2-TOA data, the random
    forest classifier (Pal, 2005) was used to extracted the maize planting area in
    the study area. Using the extracted maize planting area, we further estimated
    the LAI of the maize with the aid of backscattering information from the Sentinel-1
    data. Sentinel-1 data are provided in the form of global C-band Synthetic Aperture
    Radar (SAR) imagery (5.4 GHz) with either a 12-day or 6-day revisit cycle, depending
    on the availability of imagery from Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B. The fact that
    the operation of the all-weather-capable microwave sensing system is noncontingent
    on solar irradiation makes SAR images particularly applicable to crop growth monitoring
    in cloudy and rainy regions (Kuenzer and Knauer, 2013). We used Level-1 Ground
    Range Detected (GRD) products processed to extract a backscatter coefficient (σ°)
    in decibels. These GRD products have been generated by preprocessing the scenes
    for thermal noise removal, radiometric calibration, and terrain correction (Veci
    et al., 2014). To reduce the coherent speckle noise, the Refined Lee filter was
    applied to the images (Lee et al., 1999). We extracted the backscatter intensities
    for both vertical transmit–vertical receive (VV) and vertical transmit–horizontal
    receive (VH) events, respectively, and calculated the ratio of these two backscatter
    intensities. 2.3. Data assimilation–based determination of the crop genetic coefficient
    of the CERES-Maize model Data assimilation was first conceptualized by Charney
    et al. (1969). This approach integrates the two basic scientific methods of observation
    and modeling. It can integrate incomplete, multisource spatiotemporal observations
    into an evolutionary crop model such that crop growth can be simulated with satisfactory
    accuracy. The main types of data assimilation methods are cost function–based
    parameter optimization (Huang et al., 2015) and estimation theory–based ensemble
    filtering (De Wit and Van Diepen, 2007). In parameter optimization, the parameters
    in the crop model are iteratively adjusted to minimize the difference between
    the remote sensing–derived values and the model simulation values. The principal
    components of the present data assimilation framework are the crop model, remote
    sensing data, and assimilation algorithm. 2.3.1. CERES-Maize model DSSAT (Hoogenboom
    et al., 2010, Jones et al., 2003) is a widely used crop model system. Compared
    to other empirical models that simulate crop growth, the models in this system
    provide a more accurate description of the crop growth process from a crop physiological
    perspective. Moreover, the DSSAT-embedded CERES-Maize model (Jones and Kiniry,
    1986) has been extensively validated in our study area (Saddique et al., 2019,
    Shen et al., 2020, Wang et al., 2021a). Therefore, the calibrated regional-scale
    CERES-Maize was used to simulate the temporal variation of maize LAI in data assimilation
    (Section 2.3). In developing irrigation schedules, it was used to simulate the
    growth and development of maize in response to different field management measures
    (Section 2.4). Running the CERES-Maize model requires the input of basic meteorological
    data (precipitation, daily maximum temperature, daily minimum temperature, and
    daily solar radiation). The meteorological data of the Wugong experimental station
    in 2016 and 2017 were sourced from the China Meteorological Data Service Centre
    (http://data.cma.cn/). We used the method of Angstrom (1994) to calculate daily
    solar radiation from daily sunshine duration. The basic soil data of the Wugong
    experimental station required by the CERES-Maize model include bulk density, organic
    carbon, clay and silt content, and soil PH. These data were sourced from the laboratory
    measurements. Soil hydraulic properties that are critical for simulating crop
    growth (e.g., saturated hydraulic conductivity and the soil water content at field
    capacity, wilting point, and saturation) were determined using the pedotransfer
    function (Gijsman et al., 2002, Saxton et al., 1986) in the CERES-Maize model.
    Percentage of sand, clay, and organic matter (converted from organic carbon) were
    used as inputs in the pedotransfer function. To regionalize the CERES-Maize model,
    spatializing meteorological data at a single point scale (http://data.cma.cn/)
    is necessary. Therefore, we conducted ordinary Kriging interpolation to estimate
    the value of the aforementioned meteorological variables in each 2 km × 2 km grid.
    Gridded soil data with a resolution of 5 arc minutes were obtained from a study
    by Han et al. (2015). To ensure consistency between the resolution of the soil
    data and that of the meteorological data, we generated the grid values of the
    soil data through inverse distance weighted interpolation at a 2 km × 2 km scale.
    2.3.2. Sensitivity analysis and calibration of the CERES-Maize model Genetic coefficient
    calibration is typically performed before crop model simulation and can be time-consuming.
    Therefore, regarding the six genetic coefficients in the CERES-Maize model (Table
    2), we first used the extended Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (EFAST) to identify
    the key parameters affecting daily LAI. We then conducted data assimilation to
    determine the key parameter values. Table 2. Genetic coefficient parameters and
    their ranges in the CERES-Maize model. Variables Acronym Unit Min Max Thermal

    decomposition–based method for global sensitivity analysis, is widely used in
    the parameter sensitivity analysis of various crop models. The variance of the
    model simulation results is decomposed to obtain the sensitivity index of each
    parameter. The greater the sensitivity index of the parameters is, the greater
    the impact of the parameters on the model output is. According to our previous
    study (Wang et al., 2021a), the sensitivity indexes of P2, P5, and G3 were high.
    Thus, we used them as further correction parameters in data assimilation. The
    values of P1, G2 and PHINT were obtained from the calibration of the CERES-Maize
    model based on the field scale experiments conducted in 2016 and 2017. 2.3.3.
    Support vector regression–based estimation of regional LAI LAI was used as an
    assimilation variable to connect the remote sensing data and the crop model. Considering
    that support vector regression (SVR; Joachims, 1998) has been widely used to estimate
    the LAI of crops (Hosseini et al., 2021, Yuan et al., 2017). Moreover, SVR has
    shown robustness in the presence of outliers and SVR can perform well even when
    few training samples are available (Mandal et al., 2019). Therefore, SVR was performed
    to fit the relationship between the backscattered signals (backscatter intensities
    for both VV and VH events, the ratio of these two backscatter intensities) derived
    from the Sentinel-1 imagery and the field-measured LAI data from 2020. The SVR
    model used herein was derived from the LIBSVM machine learning library (https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/∼cjlin/libsvm/index.html).
    The kernel function of the model was the radial basis function, and the penalty
    factor c and parameter g were determined through a grid search. The field datasets
    were organized into a training set (n = 85) and a test set (n = 35) for training
    and testing the SVR-based LAI estimation model, respectively. 2.3.4. Integration
    of the SCE-UA algorithm for data assimilation Assimilation algorithm accuracy
    mainly depends on the assimilation variables, optimization algorithm, and the
    form of the objective function. To quantify the difference between the LAI (assimilation
    variable) simulated by the CERES-Maize model and the LAI estimated by the Sentinel-1
    data, we construct the objective function shown in Eq. (3): (3) where J is the
    cost function, X is the vector composed of parameters to be calibrated, LAIqsim
    is the LAI simulated by the CERES-Maize model, LAIqobs is the LAI estimated according
    to the Sentinel-1 data, and Q is the number of LAI observations collected over
    the entire growing season. To obtain the genetic coefficient of the maize, we
    employed the SCE-UA optimization algorithm (Duan et al., 1993) to minimize the
    objective function in Eq. (3). A global optimization algorithm that combines the
    advantages of deterministic search, random search, and competitive evolution,
    the SCE-UA algorithm is not sensitive to the initial values of optimized parameters.
    Therefore, when applying this algorithm to the assimilation of remote sensing
    data and crop models, only a limited amount of prior knowledge is required (Huang
    et al., 2019). Herein, the SCE-UA algorithm was considered to have converged if
    the optimized parameter value was within the predetermined normalized geometric
    range (0.001) (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/7671-shuffled-complex-evolution-sce-ua-method)
    and if, after 10 iterations, the cost function value had not decreased by more
    than 0.01 %. 2.4. Irrigation schedule optimization According to the distributed
    CERES-Maize model calibrated through data assimilation, we used the NSGA-II algorithm
    to optimize the maize irrigation schedules in subregions MZ1 and MZ2 under various
    meteorological scenarios. 2.4.1. Determination of typical meteorological scenarios
    Historical precipitation data in the crop growing season for multiple years are
    essential for the determination of typical meteorological scenarios (Guo et al.,
    2021). Moreover, typical meteorological scenarios should also take into account
    the crop water needs (Liu and Yang, 2021). Consequently, precipitation and crop
    water needs must be jointly analyzed through bivariate models. Considering that
    the actual evapotranspiration of crops is also related to conditions such as growth
    stage, irrigation, and fertilization. Meanwhile, to clearly reflect the influence
    of meteorological factors on crop water consumption, ETo was used as an indicator
    of crop water needs in this study. Copula theory (Sklar, 1959) has the advantage
    of not requiring the assumption that the variables are independent or have the
    same type of marginal distribution. We therefore utilized the copula function
    to fit a joint distribution function for precipitation and ETo to determine typical
    meteorological scenarios. For a bivariate case, let observations , , ……, be drawn
    from the bivariate population of (X, Y), with the marginal distributions as and
    . Using the copula, the joint distribution can be expressed as. (4) where Cθ is
    the copula and θ is the function parameter. Cθ is a unique mapping when and are
    continuous, capturing the dependence between random variables X and Y. The formulation
    of the copula function Cθ is based on the marginal cumulative distributions, which
    can be estimated nonparametrically. Specifically, we employed the nonparametric
    method of kernel density estimation to determine the nonparametric marginal distribution
    functions of random variables (Hasan et al., 2016). Various types of copula functions
    can be adopted, such as the t copula, Frank copula, and Gaussian copula. Each
    type of copula function has corresponding structural characteristics and parameters.
    We conducted maximum likelihood estimation to establish the parameters of each
    copula function, and to evaluate copula functions, we considered the squared Euclidean
    distance between each copula function and the empirical copula function (Li et
    al., 2017), where a smaller distance indicates a more suitable copula function.
    After the joint distribution function (i.e., copula function) of random variables
    is determined, the joint probability of random variables under various conditions
    can be calculated. Precipitation and ETo were divided into three scenarios representing
    low, moderate, and high levels. We used the assurance rate to differentiate these
    scenarios. The thresholds of the cumulative probability of the low and moderate
    scenarios and of the moderate and high scenarios were plm = 37.5 % and pmh = 62.5
    %, respectively. The corresponding thresholds of the random variables were alm
    and amh, respectively. For the high scenario, Ai ≥ amh; for the low scenario,
    Ai ≤ alm; and for the moderate scenario, alm < Ai ≤ amh, where Ai denotes the
    precipitation or ETo in the ith year. Values of precipitation and ETo are denoted
    as A1 and A2, respectively. Table 3 presents the joint probability P of the combination
    of low, moderate, and high scenarios for precipitation and ETo. For the method
    by which the joint probability P of each scenario was calculated, please refer
    to the study by Li et al. (2017). Table 3. Nine meteorological scenarios of precipitation
    and ETo. Meteorological scenario PL-EL PL-EM PL-EH Calculation formula Meteorological
    scenario PM-EL PM-EM PM-EH Calculation formula Meteorological scenario PH-EL PH-EM
    PH-EH Calculation formula Note: In the scenario names, “P” and “E” refer to precipitation
    and ETo, respectively, and L, M, and H refer to low, moderate, and high, respectively.
    Thus, PL-EL represents the scenario in which both precipitation and ETo are low.
    Furthermore, values of precipitation and ETo are denoted as A1 and A2, respectively.
    The meanings of the other scenario names can be determined according to this rationale.
    2.4.2. Establishment of an irrigation schedule optimization model The use of the
    CERES-Maize model to determine irrigation schedules for summer maize under each
    of the meteorological scenarios listed in Table 3 relies on the input of year-specific
    meteorological data. We use subregion MZ1 as an example to demonstrate the selection
    of a specific year in the PL-EL scenario, in which both precipitation and ETo
    are low (precipitation < a1lm, ETo < a2lm). We denoted the set of years in which
    precipitation < a1lm as B, that in which ETo < a2lm as C, and the intersection
    of B and C as D. If D contains more than one year, calculate dv as shown in Eq.
    (5), (5) where Pv and Ev are the precipitation and ETo, mm, corresponding to each
    year in D, respectively; v is the number of elements in D; and are the mean values
    of precipitation and ETo, mm, corresponding to all years in B and C, respectively.
    It is worth noting that we conducted ordinary Kriging interpolation to estimate
    the value of the meteorological variables in each 2 km × 2 km grid (section 2.2.1).
    Therefore, the meteorological data used to drive the crop model was the meteorological
    data for the year corresponding to the minimum value of dv in the subregion MZ1.
    Meteorological data used to drive crop models in other meteorological scenarios
    were determined in the similar way. In irrigation schedule optimization, the objective
    is to maximize crop yield and minimize the irrigation amount. The decision variables
    are the irrigation date and amount of water dispensed during each irrigation.
    The objectives and constraints of optimization are presented in Eqs. (6), (7),
    and (8). (6) (7) subject to: (8) where Ym is the average crop yield (in kilograms
    per hectare), K is the number of maize pixels, S = [s1, s2,…, sp] is a vector
    composed of irrigation dates, T = [t1, t2, …, tp] is a vector consisting of each
    irrigation amount, the number of irrigations (p∈{1, 2, 3}) within a growing season
    is typically decided by producers, W is the total irrigation volume (in millimeters),
    and tmin and tmax are the maximum and minimum irrigation amounts in a single irrigation
    (in millimeters). The NSGA-II algorithm (Deb et al., 2002) was run to solve the
    optimization problem. In the case of genetic algorithms, the larger the population
    is and the greater the number of genetic algebras is, the more accurate the optimization
    results are but the higher the computational costs are. Considering the computational
    accuracy and efficiency, we established 100 and 50 as the number of genetic algebras
    and populations, respectively. To further improve computational efficiency, the
    MATLAB Parallel Computing Toolbox (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) was run on an AMD
    Ryzen 7 1700 eight-core processor. 2.4.3. Determination of the optimal irrigation
    schedule The NSGA-II algorithm can only provide a Pareto solution set; therefore,
    some decision-making methods must be used to determine the final irrigation schedule.
    In this study, the exponential efficacy coefficient (EEC) method (Guo et al.,
    2021) was employed for decision-making regarding the optimization results presented
    in Section 2.4.2. This method was designed on the basis of the multiobjective
    programming principle. Users are required to set the acceptable and unacceptable
    values of each index according to the optimization problem; subsequently, the
    efficacy coefficient of each index is calculated. The greater the efficacy coefficient
    is, the more favorable the solution effect becomes. Moreover, the larger the amount
    of water applied I is, the smaller the efficiency coefficient becomes; conversely,
    the greater the yield Y is, the greater the efficacy coefficient becomes. The
    calculations are presented as follows: (9) (10) (11) where gY and gI are the yield
    efficiency coefficient and irrigation efficiency coefficient of a single pixel,
    respectively; gYS and gIS are the regional average yield efficiency coefficient
    and average irrigation efficiency coefficient, respectively; and Y, Y0, and Y1
    are the yield, unacceptable yield, and acceptable yield of each pixel, respectively.
    I, I0, and I1 are the irrigation amount, unacceptable irrigation amount, and acceptable
    irrigation amount of each pixel, respectively. K is the number of maize pixels;
    and g is the total efficacy coefficient. Acceptability and unacceptability are
    based on the perspectives of farmers. Specifically, the maximum and minimum yield
    of maize in Xianyang City were taken as the acceptable and unacceptable yields,
    respectively. The acceptable and unacceptable values of the irrigation amount
    were established according to the experience of local farmers. 2.5. Accuracy evaluation
    To evaluate the performance of the LAI estimation model and the CERES-Maize model,
    the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), mean relative
    error (MRE), and relative error (RE) were used as indicators to assess the agreement
    between the observed and simulated values. These measures can be expressed as
    follows: (12) (13) (14) (15) where is the observed value, is the estimated value,
    is the average value of the observed data, is the average value of the simulated
    data, and n represents the number of samples. The closer R2 is to 1, the closer
    the model fit is. The smaller the RMSE and MRE are, the smaller the difference
    between the measured and simulated values is. The positive and negative of RE
    represent the direction in which the simulated value deviates from the observed
    value. 3. Results 3.1. Regional LAI estimation LAI and plant height accurately
    reflect the growth and development status of maize (Jin et al., 2016). Fig. 3

    the (a) plant height, (b) LAI of summer maize across 25 sampling points. Over
    the entire sampling area, the plant height first increased and then essentially
    remained unchanged over time, whereas the LAI first increased and then decreased
    (Fig. 3a and 3b). These results are consistent with the established growth trends
    of maize (Fang et al., 2021). The silking stage of summer maize, which marks the
    crop’s turning point from vegetative to reproductive growth, is characterized
    by peaks in the plant height and LAI. The maximum and minimum plant height values
    were 299 and 275 cm, respectively, and the corresponding LAI values were 4.82
    and 2.87, respectively. These large variations are attributable to the joint effects
    of maize varieties, field management methods, soil fertility, and meteorological
    conditions. On the basis of the LAI measurements, an LAI estimation model with
    backscattered signals from microwave remote sensing data as inputs was established
    through SVR. The prediction performance of the model on the training and test
    sets is displayed in Fig. 4. Download : Download high-res image (209KB) Download

    model on the (a) training and (b) test sets. *: p ≤ 0.01. Regarding the training
    set (Fig. 4a), the simulated LAI agreed well with the measured LAI, as indicated
    by an R2 of 0.97, RMSE of 0.23, and MRE of 7.54 %. Regarding the test set (Fig.
    4b), the R2, RMSE, and MRE were 0.94, 0.27, and 11.53 %, respectively. The measured
    and estimated LAI were close to the 1:1 line. Overall, the results demonstrate
    that the LAI estimation model provides accurate predictions. Thus, we could further
    employ the model in estimating LAI dynamics at a regional scale (Fig. 5). Download

    Dynamic spatiotemporal changes in the LAI of summer maize. As displayed in Fig.
    5, across the entire study area, the LAI first increased and then decreased as
    the growing period progressed; moreover, the LAI peaked at 3.99 in the silking
    stage. In addition, the spatial heterogeneity in LAI was notable. In all four
    growth stages (jointing, late jointing, silking, and filling), the LAI was higher
    in subregion MZ2 than in subregion MZ1. In the late jointing stage, low LAI values
    in this area were distributed across a greater range than were those in subregion
    MZ1. By contrast, at the silking stage, high LAI values were distributed across
    a greater range in subregion MZ2 than in subregion MZ1. These results may be explained
    by subregional differences in maize varieties and field management measures. Specifically,
    at the filling stage, LAI values should be lower in subregion MZ1 than in subregion
    MZ2, but the opposite results were observed. This is because most of the stems
    and leaves of maize varieties grown in subregion MZ1 remain green when approaching
    maturity, whereas the stems and leaves of maize varieties grown in subregion MZ2
    change from green to yellow during the same period. Considering the scale of the
    study area, we postulate that variations in maize varieties are the main reason
    for the spatial differences in LAI. 3.2. Performance evaluation of the distributed
    CERES-Maize model The CERES-Maize model was initially calibrated and validated
    using field data in 2016 and 2017, respectively, and the crop parameters of the
    Wugong experimental station—that is, crop parameters at the field scale (Table
    4; (Wang et al., 2021a)—were obtained. Subsequently, EFAST was employed to identify
    the key parameters (P2, P5, and G3) affecting the daily LAI. Finally, the three
    parameters of subregion MZ1, subregion MZ2, and the entire study area were determined
    through data assimilation (Table 4). Genetic coefficient differences between the
    regional and field scales as well as among subregion MZ1, subregion MZ2, and the
    entire study area were detected. The model parameters determined through field
    experiments of the Wugong experimental station in 2016 and 2017, along with those
    obtained through data assimilation based on the 2020 regional experiment, were
    used to simulate LAI, soil water content (at a depth of 0–20 cm), and yield at
    25 sampling points in subregion MZ2 (Fig. 6). Table 4. Estimated genetic coefficients

    ≤ 0.01. When the study area was divided into subregions MZ1 and MZ2, the R2 values
    of the LAI, soil water content, and yield simulated by the distributed CERES-Maize
    model were 0.73, 0.62, and 0.77 respectively. The RMSEs were 0.53, 0.02 cm3/cm3,
    and 1070.73 kg/ha, respectively; the MREs were 17.97 %, 8.25 %, and 9.35 %, respectively;
    and the REs were 5.41 %, −1.48 %, and 3.13 %, respectively. Regarding the simulation
    performance of the CERES-Maize model under field-scale calibration, the R2 values
    of LAI, soil water content, and yield were 0.56, 0.37, and 0.61 respectively;
    the RMSEs were 0.69, 0.03 cm3/cm3, and 1384.69 kg/ha, respectively; the MREs were
    25.99 %, 10.26 %, and 11.68 %, respectively; and the REs were 2.17 %, −1.92 %,
    and −2.97 %, respectively. When the study area was divided into two management
    zones (subregions MZ1 and MZ2), the simulation performance of the CERES-Maize
    model surpassed that of the crop model based on field-scale calibration as well
    as that of the crop model when the entire study area was regarded as one management
    zone (Fig. 6). In summary, the crop model parameters determined based on the data
    assimilation method better reflect the growth characteristics of summer maize
    at the regional scale when the study area was divided into two sub-regions. Therefore,
    we further used the distributed CERES-Maize model to determine the irrigation
    schedule at the regional scale. 3.3. Determination of meteorological scenarios
    The first step in generating the irrigation schedule according to the distributed
    CERES-Maize model was to determine the meteorological scenario according to the
    characteristics of precipitation and ETo distribution. Fig. 7 presents the serial
    changes of precipitation and ETo in subregions MZ1 and MZ2 between 1970 and 2020.

    Fig. 7. Serial changes in precipitation and ETo in subregions (a) MZ1 and (b)
    MZ2 (1970–2020). As indicated in Fig. 7, in most years, the ETo considerably exceeded
    the precipitation, and the difference between annual precipitation and ETo varied
    widely. These results are indicative of between-year variability in the water
    demand of maize and in the water supply. Therefore, selecting the representative
    year correspondent with the meteorological scenario according to the precipitation
    and ETo is pivotal for determining the optimal irrigation schedule. The marginal
    distribution of precipitation was determined through kernel density estimation
    according to the average precipitation during the summer maize growing periods
    from 1970 to 2020. Similarly, the marginal distribution of ETo was established
    through kernel density estimation on the basis of the mean ETo during the same
    periods. The fitted shapes of both precipitation and ETo in subregion MZ1 (Fig.
    8a and Fig. 8b) and subregion MZ2 (Fig. 8d and Fig. 8e) were comparable with the
    empirical cumulative distribution functions of precipitation and ETo. Under the
    division of low, moderate, and high scenarios, a1lm and a1mh (corresponding to
    subregion MZ1) were 365.2 and 440.1 mm, respectively, with the corresponding probabilities
    of 0.37 and 0.61, respectively. As for subregion MZ2, a2lm and a2mh were 474.9
    and 521.9 mm, respectively, with the corresponding probabilities of 0.37 and 0.61,
    respectively. For subregion MZ2, a1lm and a1mh were 316.8 and 405.9 mm, respectively,
    with corresponding probabilities of 0.36 and 0.65, respectively. As for a2lm and
    a2mh, they were 503.8 and 541.0 mm, with corresponding probabilities of 0.36 and
    0.63, respectively. Download : Download high-res image (487KB) Download : Download

    of the cumulative distribution function of precipitation; (b) and (e) Estimation
    of the cumulative distribution function of ETo; (c) and (f) joint distribution
    function of precipitation and ETo. The three copula functions (t copula, Frank
    copula, and Gaussian copula) were determined on the basis of the marginal distribution
    functions of precipitation and ETo and through maximum likelihood estimation.
    Next, each copula function was further evaluated with reference to the squared
    Euclidean distance between each copula function and the empirical copula function.
    For subregion MZ1, the squared Euclidean distances corresponding to the t copula,
    Frank copula, Gaussian copula were 0.0245, 0.0250, and 0.0255, respectively. The
    corresponding squared Euclidean distances in subregion MZ2 were 0.0248, 0.0251,
    and 0.0260, respectively. Given that it has the smallest square Euclidean distance,
    the t copula function was selected to calculate the joint probabilities. Fig.
    8c and Fig. 8f present the joint distribution of precipitation and ETo, from which
    the joint probability was obtained. Through the use of the joint probability formulas
    of the combinations of low, moderate, and high scenarios, the joint probabilities
    of the PL-EL, PL-EM, PL-EH, PM-EL, PM-EM, PM-EH, PH-EL, PH-EM, PH-EH scenarios
    in subregion MZ1 (Fig. 9a) were determined to be 5.81 %, 9.35 %, 22.39 %, 7.80
    %, 7.12 %, 7.66 %, 24.40 %, 9.60 %, and 5.87 %, respectively. The corresponding
    joint probabilities in subregion MZ2 (Fig. 9b) were 5.70 %, 9.47 %, 22.27 %, 7.80
    %, 7.25 %, 7.43 %, 24.60 %, 9.80 %, and 5.68 %, respectively. Download : Download

    In the scenario names, “P” and “E” refer to precipitation and ETo, respectively.
    L, M, and H represent low, moderate, and high, respectively. Thus, PL-EL represents
    the scenario in which both precipitation and ETo are low. The meanings of the
    other scenario names can be determined according to this rationale. 3.4. Irrigation
    schedule optimization After the NSGA-II algorithm had obtained the irrigation
    schedules of subregions MZ1 and MZ2 under various meteorological scenarios, the
    EEC method was employed to determine the optimal irrigation schedule. We set Y0
    and Y1 as 5355 and 5931 kg/ha, respectively, and I0 and I1 as 210 and 170 mm,
    respectively. Table 5 lists the optimized and local current summer maize irrigation
    schedules under various meteorological scenarios in the two subregions. Table

    irrigation schedules was sourced from the agricultural water quota standards of
    Shaanxi Province (Shaanxi, 2020) and from field surveys. The two schedules were
    relatively similar, with the exception being the irrigation times in the optimized
    irrigation schedule were slightly earlier than those in the local current irrigation
    schedule. The differences were mainly reflected in the amount of irrigation (Table
    5). Compared to the local current irrigation schedule, the optimized irrigation
    schedule has a reduced irrigation amount. Consider the scenarios with a moderate
    level of precipitation. For subregion MZ1, the total irrigation amounts in the
    local current irrigation schedule exceeded those in scenarios PM-EL, PM-EM, and
    PM-EH by 40, 28, and 10 mm, respectively. As for subregion MZ2, the total irrigation
    amounts in the local current irrigation schedule exceeded those in the same scenarios
    by 16, 9, and 2 mm, respectively. Fig. 10, Fig. 11 present crop yield and WUE

    The dashed line is the dividing line between subregions MZ1 and MZ2. Overall,
    yield was higher in subregion MZ2 than in subregion MZ1 (Fig. 10). Scenarios involving
    high precipitation (e.g., PH-EL, PH-EM, and PH-EH) resulted in higher yields than
    did scenarios with low precipitation (e.g., PL-EL, PL-EM, and PL-EH). As indicated
    in Fig. 11, the WUE and yield patterns were similar. The WUE was higher under
    scenarios with high precipitation (e.g., PH-EL, PH-EM, and PH-EH) than under scenarios
    with low precipitation (e.g., PL-EL, PL-EM, and PL-EH). For scenarios involving
    the same level of precipitation (e.g., PH-EL, PH-EM, and PH-EH), the greater the
    ETo was, the greater the WUE was. Fig. 12, Fig. 13 present the incremental spatial

    and WUE increments of subregion MZ1 were greater than those of subregion MZ2.
    Furthermore, compared with the scenarios involving high amounts of precipitation
    (e.g., PH-EL, PH-EM, and PH-EH), the scenarios with moderate and low amounts of
    precipitation (PM-EL, PM-EM, PM-EH, PL-EL, PL-EM, and PL-EH) left more room for
    such increases, even when the yield was low in scenarios with low precipitation
    (e.g., PL-EL, PL-EM, and PL-EH; Fig. 10). Regarding the scenarios with the same
    precipitation levels but varying ETo levels (e.g., PM-EL, PM-EM, and PM-EH), the
    yield and WUE increased considerably in the scenario with moderate ETo. 4. Discussion
    4.1. Increasing the accuracy of the regional-scale CERES-Maize models by assimilating
    the remotely sensed LAI The SVR model was trained on the backscatter intensities,
    with LAI as the response. The SVM model performed well in estimating the LAI of
    maize (Fig. 4). Hosseini et al. (2021) also trained a good SVR to estimate the
    LAI for maize from backscatter intensities. Mandal et al. (2019) compared the
    performance of SVR and random forest (RF) algorithms in estimating the maize LAI
    from backward scattered signals. Although SVR and RF performed similarly, RF was
    more sensitive to the size of the training data set, and SVR was more efficient
    and robust when the training data set was smaller. Estimating the maize LAI by
    using SVM is effective and yields robust results. We evaluated the accuracy of
    the field-scale CERES-Maize model before calibrating the regional-scale model
    by using the remotely sensed LAI. The calibrated field-scale model performed well
    in simulating the field-scale soil water content, LAI, and yield (Fig. 6) because
    it was designed for a single variety of maize that has a homogeneous growing environment
    (Jones and Kiniry, 1986). This result indicates that the field-scale model is
    highly applicable to our study area (Saddique et al., 2019). The regional-scale
    model calibrated using the remotely sensed LAI performed considerably better in
    the simulation of regional-scale maize growth than did the field-scale model calibrated
    using field trial data (Fig. 8) because the summer maize cultivar coefficients
    determined through field-scale trials were not representative of the overall regional
    cultivar coefficients. Thus, we re-estimated the satisfactory maize cultivar coefficients
    for the MZ1 and MZ2 subregions by using the LAI estimated from microwave remote
    sensing data (Table 4). Assimilation of the remotely sensed LAI into the CERES-Maize
    model can increase the accuracy of the model in simulating regional-scale maize
    growth in summer. 4.2. Optimization of the irrigation schedule Precipitation and
    ETo are key hydrological variables in irrigation schedules and are correlated
    (Zhang et al., 2017). Traditionally, precipitation is analyzed through frequency
    analysis to explore various meteorological scenarios, and the irrigation schedules
    of crops are then determined (Guo et al., 2021). However, irrigation schedules
    depend on the amount of rainfall during crop growth and are related to ETo (Zhang
    et al., 2017). Therefore, meteorological scenarios must be determined using a
    two-dimensional joint probability distribution of rainfall and ETo (Liu et al.,
    2021). The advantage of the copula method over the classical families of bivariate
    distributions is that it does not require the assumption that the variables are
    independent or have the same type of marginal distribution (Sklar, 1959). This
    advantage enables the fitting of the copula function to a two-dimensional joint
    probability distribution model of precipitation and ETo. By analyzing nine meteorological
    scenarios identified using a two-dimensional joint probability distribution model,
    we identified nine summer maize irrigation schedules that can help decision makers
    develop comprehensive irrigation water allocation schemes. The optimized irrigation
    schedule reduced the amount of irrigation water required by 2–60 mm compared with
    the current local irrigation schedule (Table 5). For the current irrigation schedule,
    experts determined three meteorological scenarios by using rainfall data and then
    identified three irrigation schedules in each scenario through the water balance
    method (Shaanxi, 2020). This method involves using a water production function
    to quantify the relationship between maize yield and water, which lacked knowledge
    and description of soil and crop mechanisms and had some limitations in application.
    We employed a mechanistic model to simulate the growth and yield of summer maize,
    providing a better reflection of the response of summer maize growth to soil moisture.
    Summer maize must be irrigated once in the PH-EL, PH-EM, and PH-EH scenarios and
    twice in the other scenarios. The first irrigation should be performed during
    the jointing stage, and the second irrigation should be performed during the tasseling
    stage (Table 5); for summer maize, these stages are crucial in terms of water
    demand (Fang et al., 2021). In the scenario of low precipitation and high ETo
    (PL-EH), producers should increase the amount of irrigation according to the local
    water resources conditions. Although the optimized irrigation schedule resulted
    in higher yield in subregion MZ2 than in subregion MZ1, the yield increase in
    subregion MZ2 was smaller than that in subregion MZ1 (Fig. 10, Fig. 12) because
    subregion MZ2 had more favorable environmental conditions (in terms of precipitation,
    temperature, and soil fertility) and because the current local irrigation schedule
    in subregion MZ2 was similar to the optimized irrigation schedule (Table 5); little
    room remained for an increase in yield. In addition, the increase in yield was
    smaller in the scenario with low rainfall than in the scenario with moderate rainfall
    (Fig. 12). Although the distribution of water resources during the growth period
    can be improved using the optimized irrigation schedule, crop growth depends not
    only on water supply but also on soil fertility, crop management, and solar irradiation
    (Jones and Kiniry, 1986). Therefore, the optimal irrigation schedule can increase
    crop yield in scenarios of low precipitation but only to a certain extent. The
    WUE and yield exhibited similar characteristics (Fig. 10, Fig. 11). Sun et al.
    (2010) reported that as the amount of irrigation water increased, both the yield
    and WUE increased and then decreased and that the WUE reached its maximum before
    the yield did. Therefore, in the optimized irrigation schedule, the WUE corresponding
    to the maximum yield is also high (Zhang et al., 2003). For scenarios with the
    same precipitation level but varying ETo level (PM-EL, PM-EM, and PM-EH), the
    yield and WUE were considerably higher in the scenario with moderate ETo (Fig.
    10, Fig. 11). This may have been because neither an excessively high nor excessively
    low ETo level is conducive to photosynthesis. Overall, our irrigation schedules
    increased the maize yield and WUE and reduced water consumption compared with
    the current local irrigation schedule. We did not consider the local water resources
    available for irrigation when determining the irrigation schedule. This may have
    caused uncertainty in the optimized irrigation schedule. The results obtained
    by including this constraint in the future optimized systems may be more applicable
    to agricultural practice than those obtained when the constraint is not included.
    In addition, fertilizer is a crucial factor affecting the crop yield and WUE and
    should thus be considered in future studies on optimization. Scholars should also
    test the applicability of our irrigation schedule framework to other crops and
    ecological regions. 5. Conclusions To improve the accuracy of the distributed
    CERES-Maize model in simulating crop growth at a regional scale, we first integrated
    the remote sensing data and crop growth model through data assimilation. Thereafter,
    nine meteorological scenarios were established according to the joint distribution
    of precipitation and ETo. Finally, on the basis of the distributed CERES-Maize
    model and using the NSGA-II algorithm, the irrigation schedule was optimized under
    various meteorological scenarios. The main conclusions of this study are summarized
    as follows. First, use of the backscattering intensities extracted from microwave
    remote sensing imagery yields accurate LAI estimates. Second, compared with the
    crop model parameters calibrated at the field scale, the crop model parameters
    determined by data assimilation can more accurately reflect the spatial variability
    of yield and LAI. Third, the copula function is an effective tool for quantifying
    the joint probability of precipitation and ETo. The irrigation schedule established
    under various meteorological scenarios comprehensively reflects maize water demand
    and rainfall ability to meet maize water requirements. Finally, the irrigation
    schedule based on the distributed crop model improves the yield and WUE of summer
    maize and reduces the amount of irrigation. The proposed method, which involves
    the assimilation of remotely sensed LAI and the CERES-Maize model to determine
    the parameters of the distributed crop model, can be used to generate irrigation
    schedules over large areas. CRediT authorship contribution statement Yongqiang

    OptimizationLarge-Scale Sparse Optimization 1. Introduction The current global
    agricultural production system struggles to meet food and nutrition security (El
    Bilali et al., 2019). This is primarily due to the 30% expected increase in world
    population by 2050, which will elevate food demand by 50% and require a 70% increase
    in food production (van Dijk et al., 2021). In addition, food accessibility will
    be further threatened by adverse climate conditions and volatile food prices,
    especially in developing and underdeveloped regions of the world (Richardson et
    al., 2018). Therefore, food production systems, being sensitive to abiotic and
    biotic shocks, need timely decisions in optimizing resource use. To mitigate these
    shocks, breeders have developed high yielding resistant crop cultivars. These
    modern cultivars require optimization of water and nutrient management to minimize
    yield gaps and to ensure the sustainability of agroecosystems (Tian et al., 2018).
    Despite being a critical resource in food production, water also faces scarcity
    due to population growth and climate change. The latest Intergovernmental Panel
    on Climate Change (IPCC) report highlights increased water-related food scarcity
    due to the increased frequency of droughts and poor water management (Arias et
    al., 2021). Maize (Zea mays L.) is the third most important crop after rice and
    wheat, due its stable global productivity. This is primarily attributed to high-yielding
    seeds and modern management practices (Ricciardi et al., 2021). Despite continuous
    efforts in developing high yielding cultivars, many regions of the world are experiencing
    a stagnation in yield improvement over last two decades (Kucharik et al., 2020).
    One critical component of this stagnation is interannual variation in yield, which
    is primarily attributed to crop-climate feedback (Coffel et al., 2022, Kukal and
    Irmak, 2018). To address this variability in yield, a data-driven resource optimization
    approach is more feasible with the constrained resources availability (Eeswaran
    et al., 2021, Kropp et al., 2019). For example, in the United States Corn Belt,
    farmers were able to boost productivity over the last few decades by optimizing
    irrigation and nitrogen management (Jin et al., 2019, Wortmann et al., 2017, Zheng
    et al., 2019). The traditional method of optimizing agricultural management practices
    is through field experiments, which are constrained by time and monitory resources
    (Vilayvong et al., 2015). However, computer modeling, monitoring, and optimization
    now allow farmers to optimize management practices at greater spatiotemporal scales
    (Abbasi et al., 2014, Tyagi, 2016). This is critical since managing or sustaining
    the agroecosystem under short, and long-term climatic variability requires a system
    approach with complex data handling (da Fonseca et al., 2020). Crop simulation
    models have been used to investigate the impact of management practices on crop
    growth and development (Araya et al., 2021, Jha et al., 2018). Additionally, data-driven
    simulation studies have developed novel methods of resource optimization for management
    practices at both farm (Kropp et al., 2019) and regional levels (Ban et al., 2019).
    These advancements are already paying off, considering that precision agriculture
    and information technology have significantly increased agricultural productivity
    (Ahmed et al., 2018, Basso, 2020, Monzon et al., 2018). However, system complexity
    and multi-dimensional data reduce optimization speed (Sabarina & Priya, 2015).
    In fact, it is impossible to exhaustively examine all management practices to
    find an optimum. However, optimization techniques efficiently find near-optimal
    solutions among all possible management practices. Classical optimization techniques,
    such as gradient descent (Curry, 1944) and linear programming (Chvatal, 1983),
    efficiently solve simple optimization problems, but perform poorly with more complex
    problems such as multi-modal, non-convex, and nonlinear problems (Deb, 2009).
    Agricultural optimization falls in the latter category, making it a good candidate
    for evolutionary optimization (Kropp et al., 2019). This study chose evolutionary
    optimization because it offers a less specialized but an overall more capable
    optimization than the classical techniques (Goldberg, 1989). Research has repeatedly
    demonstrated the efficacy of evolutionary algorithms in developing more optimal
    crop management practices (Akbari et al., 2018, Groot et al., 2012, Kropp et al.,
    2019, Mello et al., 2013, Sarker and Ray, 2009). In addition to evolutionary optimization,
    the utility of multi-objective (MO) optimization techniques has been widely examined
    for agriculture management. MO problems contain no single solution that simultaneously
    satisfies all objectives in the problem (Miettinen, 2012). For example, suppose
    a farmer aims to minimize irrigation while maximizing their yield. In that case,
    there are two equally optimal solutions: Solution A maximizes yield with considerable
    irrigation losses, and Solution B that minimizes irrigation by not irrigating
    at all. Each of these solutions is equally optimal, and no better solution exists
    that outperforms each solution in both categories at once. And between these two
    extreme solutions typically lie a group of solutions, known as a Pareto front,
    that are also equally optimal and offer different tradeoffs to the problem (Censor,
    1977). In the above example, one solution may use a moderate amount of irrigation
    while attaining modest yields, which wastes less water than Solution A but gets
    higher yields than Solution B. Evolutionary multi-objective (EMO) optimization
    algorithms specialize in solving multi-objective problems with highly complex
    and irregular search spaces (Goldberg, 1989), which is why they were the method
    of choice in the study. The primary difficulty in optimizing an agricultural system
    is predicting the weather (Jones et al., 2017). Without proper management, unpredictable
    meteorological events (e.g., precipitation, minimum air temperature, maximum air
    temperature, solar radiation) can either help the plant, kill the plant, or produce
    middling yields. One way to address these uncertainties is to widen the scope
    of optimization, since it is better to search innovations that are true for all
    possible weather patterns than to improve specific management actions for a given
    year. A data-driven approach to discovering such innovations entails data mining
    massive datasets of irrigation schedules to determine the defining characteristics
    of good management practices. Such datasets are hard to obtain through the traditional
    agronomic literature due to the time and costs required to run agronomic experiments
    (Vilayvong et al., 2015). However, the combination of crop models and optimization
    can produce such a dataset (Kropp et al., 2019, Saravi et al., 2021). Given a
    fixed weather pattern, MO algorithms can generate effective management practices
    for a given year (Kropp et al., 2019), which can then be data mined for their
    successful characteristics. This process, known as innovization, uses optimization
    results to mine data for new innovations in a given system (Deb & Srinivasan,
    2006). This study carefully examines weather patterns and their impacts on an
    agricultural system over 30 years to prescribe (i.e., innovize) new management
    actions that achieve sustainable intensification. Sustainable intensification
    is defined as increasing agricultural yields with no additional impact on environment
    or land use (Pretty and Bharucha 2014). This innovization procedure is novel because
    long-term optimization results are transformed into best practice recommendations
    without requiring new optimization for future climatic scenarios. Also, innovization
    has never before been applied to an agricultural application. This study hypothesizes
    that innovization will generate new knowledge of maize production within a given
    region. These data-driven innovations will then be translated to easy-to-understand
    management actions for regional farmers and weather patterns. In order to test
    these hypotheses, the following objectives were examined against the current best
    practices that are recommended by the local extension publications (herein called
    common practices): 1) evaluate the productivity and sustainability of long term
    innovization-based irrigation scheduling under the regional weather patterns;
    2) gauge the productivity and sustainability of long term innovization-based fertilizer
    applications under regional weather patterns; and 3) gauge the productivity and
    sustainability of long term innovization-based coordinated irrigation and fertilizer
    management under regional weather patterns. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Modeling
    overview Overall, the innovization platform generates optimized management actions
    for the study site, compares them to management actions following common practices,
    and finally makes recommended amendments to the common practices accordingly (Fig.
    1). We chose a study area with complete meteorological (1989–2018) and soil data
    to generate the optimized management actions and the management actions following
    common practices data (Sections 2.2). Using a calibrated crop model for the study
    site, an optimization platform generates the near-optimal management actions for
    the 30 years of weather data (2.3 Experiment setup, 2.6 Innovization framework)
    (Appendix A Supplementary material, Bao et al., 2017, Bolstad and Curran, 2016,
    He et al., 2009, Hunt et al., 1993, Ines and Mohanty, 2008, Jha et al., 2021,
    Jones and Kiniry, 1986, Jones, 2011, Liu et al., 2011, Lizaso et al., 2011, Sun
    et al., 2016). Then, an algorithm representing farmers following common practices
    was established and ran with the same 30 years of weather data (Section 2.5).
    The 30 years of optimized and common practice management actions are then statistically
    compared (Section 2.6). Specifically, the analysis compares the amount of irrigation
    applied in each physiological growth stage and the timing of a second nitrogen
    fertilizer application during the growing season (Section 2.6). Finally, a validation
    routine measures the performance of the new amended practices and the original
    common practices to confirm or reject the efficacy of the innovization procedure.
    The validation is performed on 14 climatologically similar study sites around
    the primary study site (Figure S1). Download : Download high-res image (291KB)

    The study area is a field in the village of Cassopolis within Cass County, Michigan,
    USA (42° 1′ 29.64′'' N, 86° 10′ 15.6′'' W) (Fig. 2). The location is in the humid
    temperate region of the Midwest USA Corn belt. The long-term (1989–2018) average,
    minimum, and maximum temperature of the location is 9.81 °C, 3.1 °C, and 16.6
    °C, respectively, and the average annual precipitation is 1002.52 mm (Prism, 2015).
    About 60 percent of the annual rainfall occurs during the crop growing season
    of May-October. Although Michigan seems to have abundant freshwater resources,
    precipitation is low during critical crop growing summer months. Additionally,
    crops often suffer from water deficits during the peak growing season (Andresen
    et al., 2011). The major soil type is shallow sandy loam with moderate drainage.

    Fig. 2. Study Site. 2.3. Experiment setup 2.3.1. Crop model This study employs
    crop simulation models to create the optimized management practices needed for
    innovization. The crop model selected for this study was the Decision Support
    System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) version 4.7.5 (Hoogenboom et al., 2017,
    Jones et al., 2003). DSSAT is a collection of computer modules that are integrated
    to simulate crop growth for varying soil, weather, and genotype databases. DSSAT
    is also easily integrated into different modeling packages to consider climate
    variability and change (Han et al., 2017), remote sensing data (Li et al., 2015,
    Richetti et al., 2019), and advanced machine learning techniques (B. Singh et
    al., 2019). Its modules are reconfigurable and reusable, permitting users to modulate
    the code that connects the state and rate variables (de Abreu Resenes et al.,
    2019). These sets of capabilities make DSSAT a clear choice for this study. 2.3.2.
    Soil and weather data Based on the soil type classification of the web soil survey
    webpage, the dominant soil for the study area was identified as sandy loam (NRCS,
    2019). Sub-surface tile drain depth and spacing were kept at 75 cm and 10 m, respectively.
    Initial soil water content was held at 75% (0.145 cm3/cm3), based on soil sampling
    results from 2018 (Jha, 2019). Daily weather data (i.e., solar radiation, maximum
    and minimum temperature, and rainfall) were obtained from Dowagiac, MI, the nearest
    Enviroweather station. Enviroweather is a weather station network developed and
    supported by Michigan State University (MSU Enviroweather, 2019). Since the weather
    station was established in 2014, historical weather data prior to 2014 (1989–2013)
    were collected from the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) for Cassopolis
    to complete the 30-year climatological datasets (Menne et al., 2012). We used
    these daily weather data to calculate the growing degree days (GDD), a surrogate
    for crop phenological development. The Maize growing season is May through October.
    2.4. Prediction of developmental stages based on growing degree days Maize expresses
    a determinate growth habit with distinct vegetative and reproductive phases. Maize
    developmental stages are first based on vegetative development (V) and then on
    reproductive development (R). The most adopted method for determining vegetative
    stages is the Leaf Collar method (Ritchie et al., 1986) which can vary with hybrid,
    initial soil and planting conditions, and location. However, most of the Corn
    Belt hybrids produce 19–20 leaves. The appearance of consecutive leaves is driven
    by air temperature and hence can be predicted or tracked by estimating degree
    days or heat accumulation. The most recommended method of predicting heat accumulation
    is GDD, popularly known as 30/10 method (Abendroth et al., 2010). The optimal
    growing temperature for maize starts at 10° C and ends at 30 °C. Using 30-year
    historical weather data, we calculated the degree days (Equation (1)) in each
    year and estimated developmental stages. (1) where, is growing degree day in Celsius,
    is the minimum daily air temperature, and is the maximum daily air temperature.
    Note that if temperatures are lower than 10° C, is kept constant at 10° C, if
    temperatures are greater than 30 °C, is kept constant at 30 °C. Temperature based
    crop vegetative and reproductive development stages were used to optimize irrigation
    and nitrogen management strategies. Predicted stages based on air temperature
    can be seen in Table S1. These average values for each predicted stage and day
    were used in setting up the constants and constraints for optimization, including
    when to irrigate (30-year minimum of V6 through 30-year maximum of R2) and when
    to apply nitrogen (30-year minimum of V6 through 30-year maximum of V14) (Table
    1). Table 1. Optimization variables and constants. Variables Empty Cell Parameter

    period 1989–2018 All of the innovization years (1989–2018) were divided into dry,
    normal, and wet years of precipitation. Dry years are the driest 1/3 of the innovization
    years, wet years were the wettest 1/3 of the innovization years, and the final
    1/3 were the normal years (Table S1). These categories were also used to characterize
    the precipitation for the validation scenarios (Table 1). 2.5. Common practice
    at the study site Agronomic management of maize is primarily driven by specific
    developmental stages determined by the heat accumulation in plants (Abendroth
    et al., 2010). Growers in Cassopolis determine initial crop water requirement
    by measuring the accumulated soil moisture before the growing season. As the maize
    develops physiologically, growers irrigate after the midpoint of the vegetative
    stage (V6-V8) in addition to supplemental rainfall. Physiologically, crops need
    more water for biomass growth during critical growth stages, and hence this requirement
    is met through irrigation. Based on these growth stages and in order to optimize
    water use efficiency, farmers in Cassopolis generally plant on May 15. The irrigation
    source is groundwater pumping and the method is sprinkler irrigation. Under normal
    weather conditions, the common practice is to irrigate 10 mm after 50 days of
    planting (V6-V8 stage) at 5 days intervals up to the tasseling stage (60–70 days
    after planting (DAP)). For reproductive stages (i.e., from the tasseling stage
    onwards), growers irrigate 20 mm at 5 days intervals up to the R2 stage (i.e.,
    blistering stage, or 100–110 DAP) (Fig. 3) (Kelley, 2016, Kelley and Hall, 2020,
    Kranz et al., 2008). In the case of heavy rainfall (i.e., greater than 20 mm),
    farmers typically wait ten days before resuming irrigation (Fig. 3). Similarly,
    nitrogen application time and amount are important to yield production and potential
    groundwater contamination. The common practice of applying nitrogen for Southwest
    Michigan’s sandy to sandy loam soils is 200–210 Kg N/ha. This is based on the
    tool Maximum Return to Nitrogen (MRTN) recommendation, which growers adopt in
    the Corn Belt of the USA (Gramig et al., 2017). This application is split into
    two doses: pre-plant incorporation (75%) and another side-dressed dose (25%) between
    V6 and V14, depending on weather conditions. However, nitrogen requirement increases
    rapidly after the V8 growth stage (8-leaf collar stage), i.e., 55–60 DAP. The
    vigorous biomass growth during mid to late vegetative stages requires a large
    amount of nitrogen. Growers usually confine their side-dress application to V8-V10.
    Since rain negatively affects the application of nitrogen, the common practice
    is to delay the application until five days after heavy rainfall events (i.e.,
    greater than 20 mm), three days after moderate rainfall events (i.e., greater
    than 10 mm), and two days after any other rainfall event (Fig. 4). These are the
    practices that this study aims to improve through the process of innovization.

    Flow chart of common nitrogen practices in Cass County, Michigan. 2.6. Innovization
    framework The first task in agricultural innovization is to generate many near-optimal
    irrigation and nitrogen schedules for a vast number of weather scenarios. These
    schedules are ideally generated using numerous optimizations runs over the entire
    span of potential weather conditions; a wide breadth of initial conditions ensures
    that we are analyzing the widest range of possible meteorological scenarios. The
    agronomical literature recommends 30 years of weather representative to better
    understand the cropping systems (Deshcherevskaya et al., 2013). Therefore, from
    1989 to 2018, 30 independent optimization runs improved the common management
    practices (i.e., irrigation and nitrogen applications) for each growing season.
    All MO runs optimized three objectives: maximizing maize yield, minimizing water
    usage, and minimizing nutrient leaching. The decision variables (i.e., the management
    practices to optimize) included when and how much to irrigate during the growing
    season, and when to apply the second nitrogen application (Table 1). The first
    nitrogen application, 150 kg/ha at DAP 0, remains constant throughout all scenarios
    (Table 1). Formally, the optimization is defined by: (2) where, represents the
    30-year minimum start date of V6 (DAP 46), represents the 30-year maximum end
    date of R1 (DAP 118), and is the entire irrigation schedule ( ). In other words,
    each represents the amount of irrigation for day-after-planting in the irrigation
    schedule. The total irrigation applied on DAP is between 0 and 30 mm ( ). , which
    represents the date of the second nitrogen application, falls between the minimum
    V6 and the maximum V14 ( ) for the 30 years of study (Table S1) and involves applying
    50 kg/ha of nitrogen. , , and are yield, total irrigation usage, and total nitrogen
    leached into the soil, respectively. Each of these objectives is a function of
    the irrigation schedule and nitrogen application variables, as well as the fixed
    soil, weather, and cultivar for each year. DSSAT provides the total irrigation,
    yield, and leaching ( , , and ) by simulating maize growth for the given soil
    conditions, cultivar genotype, weather, and management practices at the study
    site. The EMO algorithm chosen for this study was the non-dominated sorted genetic
    algorithm III (NSGA-III), a powerful, many-objective optimization algorithm that
    simultaneously prioritizes solution convergence and diversity (Deb & Jain, 2014).
    Because of the stochastic nature of EMO algorithms, the optimization was repeated
    30 times for each year with different random seeds. Due to the long run time of
    the optimization in preliminary runs, thirty repetitions were determined to be
    the ideal balance between run time and sample size. This lowers the odds that
    a single optimization with poor convergence is included in the results. Every
    irrigation solution ran during the optimization, regardless of fitness, was saved
    for analysis during the innovization. All solutions for 30 runs for a given year
    were then combined into a single set and sorted into non-dominated fronts (another
    term for a Pareto front). Non-dominated sorting takes all solutions from all 30
    optimization runs and sorts them into Pareto fronts with increasing optimality.
    For example, the first front is globally optimal for the three objectives; the
    second front is globally optimal if the first front is removed, and so on. Traditional
    optimization algorithms tend to struggle to optimize large-scale optimization
    problems. Luckily, expert knowledge of irrigation helps simplify the optimization
    procedure: irrigation schedules are known to be sparse (Kropp et al., 2019). In
    simpler terms, plants physiologically only need irrigation during a minority of
    days in the growing season. Formally, the optimal is always a vector of values
    that are mostly zero. This class of problems are known as large-scale sparse multi-objective
    problems LSSMOP (Zille & Mostaghim, 2017). There are a several options to take
    advantage of this knowledge. Kropp et al. (2022) demonstrated that NSGA-II, a
    version of NSGA-III for lower objective spaces (Deb et al., 2002), solves sparse
    problems effectively with sparse population sampling (SPS). SPS consists of modifying
    the initial population of evolutionary algorithms to enforce a target sparsity,
    which starts the initial population off on advantageous footing during the first
    generation. The target sparsity for this study was set to 80%, or an irrigation
    schedule with 80% of days without irrigation based on the sparsity of common practice
    irrigation schedules in preliminary runs. Once the 30 repetitions for the 30 years
    of optimization are completed, we are left with a large dataset of 489,614 unique
    irrigation schedules, their respective yields, leaching levels, and water usages.
    However, this dataset still poses a challenge to innovization: no attributes in
    the dataset are relevant to improving common practices (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4). Firstly,
    the raw attributes include the days of the growing season and how much irrigation
    was applied during those days, which is directly tied to the weather of that given
    year. Thus, the irrigation schedules must be first transformed into a weather-independent
    format. In addition, a raw irrigation schedule holds little meaning for a farmer
    in the study area and transforming the results into relevant attributes will simplify
    the results. Therefore, the optimization results were run through a process that
    transformed the raw irrigation schedules into what we will refer to as a knowledge
    attribute table. The knowledge attribute table includes the irrigation schedule
    transformed into variables that describe how much water is applied during each
    physiological stage. For example, one attribute describes how much irrigation
    water was applied during the V8 stage of growth. Transforming yearly optimal irrigation
    schedules into physiological terms standardizes the irrigation schedules across
    all weather patterns. In addition, it makes the data more understandable to farmers,
    who can easily determine the current physiological stage of a plant in the field.
    See the complete list of physiological attributes in Table 2. The final attributes
    are the threshold of heavy, moderate, and light rain rainfall in the context of
    nitrogen application. These values correspond to the common practices in the study
    site to delay the second nitrogen application by five days after heavy rainfall,
    three days after a moderate rainfall, and one day after light rainfall (Fig. 4).
    To determine the heavy rain threshold from raw irrigation schedules, we select
    the total rainfall from the day with the greatest amount of rainfall within five
    days before the second nitrogen application. This represents the amount of rain
    the optimized nitrogen management was able to tolerate. The same process calculated
    the moderate and light rain thresholds, but within three and one day(s) before
    the second nitrogen application, respectively. Table 2. Knowledge attributes.

    V7 Total water during V8 Total water during V9 Total water during V10 Total water
    during V11 Total water during V12 Total water during V13 Total water during V14
    Total water during R1 Threshold for heavy rainfall Threshold for moderate rainfall
    Threshold for light rainfall With knowledge attributes calculated, we next search
    for ways to innovate the common practices of Cass County farmers (Fig. 3 and Fig.
    4). Looking for innovations in the common practices of producers makes recommendations
    easy and understandable for existing practitioners to follow. One area for improvement
    in the existing system is how much irrigation is applied during each application.
    As described in Fig. 3, farmers in Cass County currently irrigate 10 mm of water
    during the vegetative phases of maize, and 20 mm during the reproductive stages
    of maize. These fixed application amounts are excellent targets for innovization
    since they only consider whether the plant is in the vegetative or reproductive
    stages. Optimizing irrigation application amount for individual growth stages
    (i.e., V6 through V14, and R1) would give the farmer better control to manage
    the water use of their crop. Additionally, an optimized set of application amounts
    per growth phase would be simple to communicate with farmers. To discover targeted
    application amounts for each physiological phase, we compared the optimized median
    values of through from the 30 years of optimized practices to the values of through
    brought about by 30 years of common practices in Cass County. These 30 years of
    common practices were realized by first designing an algorithm that simulates
    the decision-making of a farmer following common practices as described in Fig.
    3. Let this simulated farmer be known as . Then, the simulated farmer runs for
    all 30 years of weather data, and the of through are calculated from their management
    decisions. With the computer-optimized and the common-practice-based medians for
    through , the percentage difference is calculated between the two as follows:
    (3) where, , is the median water usage during physiological phase for either common
    practices ( ) or optimized practices ( ), and is the median difference between
    common practices and optimized practices ( ). With the set of recommended percentage
    differences , we can then advise the farmer to alter the default irrigation application
    amount in common practices (i.e., either 10 mm in vegetative stages or 20 mm in
    reproductive stages) according to . Formally speaking, we would recommend: (4)
    where, is the amount of irrigation applied during the physiological phase according
    to common practices (i.e., ), and is the new recommended irrigation amount for
    this physiological growth phase. The timing of irrigation would remain intact
    from common practices. In summary, our recommended irrigation practice would take
    the form , where each element in the vector is the amount of irrigation that is
    applied during the given physiological phase. A similar innovization procedure
    occurs for improving the second nitrogen application. According to the common
    practices, before irrigating, farmers will wait for five consecutive days after
    a heavy precipitation event (i.e., greater than 20 mm), three days for a moderate
    precipitation event (i.e., greater than 10 mm), and two days after any light precipitation
    events. We hypothesized that these thresholds, denoted as , , and , can be innovated.
    To test this hypothesis, we examined the precipitation of the days leading up
    to the optimal fertilizer applications. For each optimal result, we search for
    what has constituted a heavy, moderate, and light precipitation event in that
    optimal result, or , , and . In other words, we record the most extreme weather
    events (i.e., the amount of precipitation on the day with the most rain) five
    days before the second application, three days before the second application,
    and two days before the second application. We then take the medians of these
    three sets to obtain , , and . Then, the percentage difference between , , and
    in common practices ( , , and ) and in the optimized results ( , , and ) will
    define the deviation between all thresholds as follows: (5) (6) (7) where, , ,
    are the percentage difference between the optimized rain thresholds and the common
    practices. From , , , recommendations can be made for an innovative threshold
    for what constitutes heavy, moderate, and light rain as follows. Together, these
    three recommendations will be known as the set . (8) (9) (10) 2.7. Validation
    To validate the innovativeness of and , we measure the performance of four strategies.
    The first strategy represents farmers following common practices, denoted as the
    common practice strategy. The other three strategies are innovization based: 1)
    farmers only following irrigation recommendations (irrigation recommendation strategy),
    2) farmers only following nitrogen application recommendations of (nitrogen recommendation
    strategy), and 3) farmers following both irrigation and nitrogen application recommendations
    ( and ) (all recommendation strategy). These strategies will measure the performance
    of and individually, as well as the recommendations enacted simultaneously. Performance
    is measured in yield, water efficiency, and nitrogen leaching, which DSSAT simulates,
    given the weather for the season. These strategies will also demonstrate the sensitivity
    of the irrigation and nitrogen parameters on our agricultural objectives. We measured
    these performance metrics under as many validation seasons of weather as possible
    to ensure statistical rigor. Since there are plentiful weather records in Southwest
    Michigan, we gathered 420 validation seasons of weather available. This included
    30 years of historical weather data (1989–2018), and 14 weather stations in Southwest
    Michigan (Figure S1) ( ). These climatologically similar sites are in Allegan,
    Bainbridge, Benton Harbor, Berrien Springs, Dowagiac, Fennville, Grand Junction,
    Hart, Keeler, Lawrence, Lawton, Oshtemo, Scottdale, and South Haven counties.
    All weather data was retrieved from MSU Enviroweather and the GHCN. Of these 420
    validation seasons, 159 are climatologically dry, 135 are climatologically normal,
    and 126 are climatologically wet. With these 420 validations seasons, three statistical
    tests measure the efficacy of the amended practices: versus , versus , and versus
    . Under each test, 420 DSSAT simulations of the common practice strategy are compared
    to 420 DSSAT simulations of amended practices according to yield, water efficiency,
    and leaching. Since the data did not consistently follow a normal distribution,
    the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test was used (Hollander et al., 2013) to test whether these
    three-performance metrics were different between the two runs. 3. Results and
    discussions 3.1. Performance of irrigation recommendation strategy Overall, the
    irrigation recommendation strategy (Table 3) increased yields over the common
    practice strategy, with a mean increase of 271.11 kg/ha per year (Table 4). This
    increase was statistically significant, with a p-value of 3.5% (i.e., < 5%) (Table
    S2). Of the validation seasons, 78.83% of seasons saw gains in yield, and the
    gains far outweighed the losses. The average gain in yield was 364.64 kg/ha per
    year compared to the common practice strategy, as opposed to an average loss in
    yield of 93.03 kg/ha (Fig. 5). Thus, on a yearly basis, the benefits of the irrigation
    recommendation strategy far outweighed the costs. This is further illustrated
    when considering how much a farmer is expected to gain over the course of 30 years.
    To do so, we calculated the average cumulative net increase in yields across all
    study sites over thirty years (Fig. 6). To summarize, a farmer can expect an average
    increase in yield between 6964.18 kg/ha and 7904.82 kg/ha by the end of 30 years
    (Fig. 6) over the common practice strategy. Encouragingly, no farmer experienced
    an increase below 6288 kg/ha over the common practice strategies during the thirty-year
    period, and one scenario even experienced a 9720 kg/ha increase in yield. These
    increases imply that yield is highly sensitive to the irrigation parameters in
    the innovization framework. In summary, despite a minority of validation seasons
    with minor decreases in yield, the irrigation recommendation strategy consistently
    results in significantly increased yields compared to the common practice strategy.
    Furthermore, Nandan (2021) supports these assertions by demonstrating the potential
    impacts of designed irrigation scheduling on corn yields in the Midwest USA under
    interannual precipitation variability. Table 3. Knowledge attributes recommendations.

    Overall, there was a mean decrease in water use efficiency of 66.45 kg/mm‧ha across
    all scenarios compared to the common practice strategy. This decrease was statistically
    significant, with a p-value of 0.3% (i.e., < 5%) (Table S2). Furthermore, 80.67%

    worse) than the improved scenarios (on average 4.57 kg/mm‧ha improved) (Table
    4). These outcomes suggest that water use efficiency is sensitive to the irrigation
    parameters in the innovization model. Though not the desired result, such a decrease
    in water use efficiency in the Midwest is an arguably worthwhile tradeoff for
    the increased yields brought about by the irrigation recommendation strategy (Andresen
    et al., 2011). The irrigation recommendation strategy improved leaching slightly
    over the common practice strategy, with the mean leaching improving by 0.9 kg/ha
    per year (Table 4). However, this improvement is not statistically significant
    since the decrease in leaching had a p-value of 64% (i.e., greater than 5%) (Table
    S2), suggesting that leaching is only minimally sensitive to the set irrigation
    parameters in our innovization framework. And even if leaching is not significantly
    changed, as the p-value suggests, this is still a promising outcome since it suggests
    that the irrigation recommendation strategy can increase yields with no impacts
    on nitrogen leaching. Also, two years (2001 and 2008) had sizeable decreases in
    leaching, which resulted in an average cumulative net decrease of 26.96 kg/ha
    in leaching over 30 years (Fig. 7). This was most likely caused by the difference
    in irrigation applications around the second nitrogen application. In the years
    with significantly decreased leaching, the irrigation recommendation strategy
    consistently applied less irrigation when the irrigation application date was
    near the second nitrogen application date. This also would explain why yields
    jumped up on these years as increased nitrogen uptake would help improve yields
    during this critical physiological phase. However, beyond 2001 and 2008, the cumulative
    net decrease was relatively unstable, with a maximum reduction in yield of 61.57
    kg/ha and a minimum reduction of 8.87 kg/ha. In summary, despite minor improvements,
    leaching did not significantly change under the irrigation recommendation strategy,
    which is a good outcome considering the significant improvements in yield. This
    contrasts with the literature, which clearly states that the amount and timing
    of irrigation greatly influences the nitrate leaching. Altering the irrigation
    schedule to avoid coincidental N application helps crops in uptaking N during
    critical crop growth stages and hence lessen leaching (Singh, 2021). Gheysari
    (2009) have highlighted the impact of different levels of irrigation on nitrate
    leaching in corn and emphasized that if irrigation and nitrogen application timing
    can be managed efficiently on the field, the impact on nitrate leaching will be
    less without comprising corn yields. Therefore, the irrigation recommendation
    strategy failed to achieve potential statistically significant improvements in
    leaching. The climate of the validation season affected the performance of the
    irrigation recommendation strategy. With regards to yield, there is no statistically
    significant change from the common practice strategy during dry and normal years,
    while there is a statistically significant increase in yield during wet years
    (Table 4, S2). This suggests that there may have been a deficiency in the common
    practice strategy during wet years that the irrigation recommendation strategy
    addressed. It also emphasizes the relative sensitivity of yield to the irrigation
    parameters of the innovization model during wet years compared to dry and normal
    years. Concerning leaching, climate variabilities brought about little change
    in the performance of the irrigation recommendation strategy: dry, wet, and normal
    years all had no significant change in leaching from the common practice strategies
    (Table 4, S2). Finally, though there was a drop in mean water use efficiency during
    dry years, the change was not statistically significant (i.e., a p-value of 15%)
    (Table S2). However, water use efficiency significantly decreased from the common
    practice strategy for normal and wet years. Overall, the innovizations had the
    least amount of impact during dry years and the most amount of impact during wet
    years. Download : Download high-res image (166KB) Download : Download full-size

    strategy, nitrogen recommendation strategy, and all recommendation strategy from
    common practice strategy. The lines’ transparent margins represent the 95% confidence
    intervals of that average value. 3.2. Performance of nitrogen recommendation strategy
    Compared to the irrigation recommendation strategy, the nitrogen recommendation
    strategy (Table 3) offered no clear benefits or drawbacks. With respect to yield,
    though there are minor drops in yield between the mean yield of the nitrogen recommendation
    strategy and the common practice strategy (Table 4), the two strategies are statistically
    nearly identical (p-value of 90%) (Table S2). The gains of the strategy were smaller
    in comparison to the losses (40.7 kg/ha in gains versus 57.5 kg/ha in losses)
    (Fig. 5), and only 30% of the scenarios were gains. The above findings demonstrate
    that yield is insensitive to nitrogen application timing in our innovization framework.
    Finally, the cumulative 30-year yield across the 14 study sites hovered around
    0 kg/ha change from the common practice strategies (Fig. 6). In summary, despite
    consistent losses, there was no statistical change in yield between the nitrogen
    recommendation strategy. The nitrogen recommendation strategy also had very little
    change in water use efficiency or leaching from the common practice strategy.
    Nominally, there is a minor mean increase in water use efficiency (1.92 kg/mm‧ha)
    (Table 4), but not enough to be statistically significant (p-value of 91%) (Table
    S2). Leaching similarly had a mean increase between the common practice and the
    nitrogen recommendation strategies (23.28 versus 23.24 kg/ha) (Table 4), but not
    to a statistically significant extent (p-value of 96%) (Table S2). Therefore,
    there is no significant change in environmental impact between the two strategies
    and leaching and water efficiency were largely insensitive to nitrogen application
    timing in our framework. Considering this lack of improvements, the irrigation
    recommendation strategy is a clear better option than the nitrogen recommendation
    strategy. Finally, climate has no statistical impact on the performance of the
    nitrogen recommendation strategy. Though minor differences exist in performance
    across dry, normal, and wet years, none of them are statistically significant.
    Across the board, the nitrogen recommendation strategy has no statistical effect
    on yield, water use efficiency, or nitrogen leaching. 3.3. Performance of all
    recommendation strategy The all recommendation strategy differs from the common
    practice strategy similarly to the irrigation only strategy. There is a statistically
    significant (p-value of 3.2%) (Table S2) mean increase in yield of 279.18 kg/ha
    per year over the common practice strategy (Table 4), and 77% of scenarios resulted
    in an increase of yields. Of this 77%, the average increase was 349.4 kg/ha, which
    is slightly lower than the increases from the irrigation recommendation strategy
    at 364.6 kg/ha (Fig. 5). On the other hand, the 23% of scenarios resulting in
    yield losses from the common practice strategy were on average lower than the
    irrigation recommendation strategy at 67.57 kg/ha (Fig. 5). Cumulatively over
    the 30-year study period, the all recommendation strategy modestly outpaces the
    irrigation only strategy by 348.9 kg/ha (Fig. 6). However, despite these differences
    between the all recommendation strategy and the irrigation only strategy, there
    no significant difference between the yields of both strategies (p-value of 94%).
    Overall, the performance of the all recommendation strategy is statistically identical
    to the irrigation recommendation strategy with respect to yield. Similar to the
    irrigation recommendation strategy, the all recommendation strategy suffered from
    setbacks in water use efficiency compared to the common practice strategy. Specifically,
    there was a mean decrease in water use efficiency by 66.21 kg/mm‧ha (Table 4),
    which was statistically significant (p-value of 0.3%) (Table S2). Compared to
    the setbacks in the irrigation recommendation strategy, the mean water use efficiency
    in the all recommendation strategy was nominally worse (by 0.30 g/mm‧ha) (Table
    4). However, the two strategies both had identical rates of water use efficiency
    decrease from the common practice strategy (p-value of 96%). As described before,
    this is an arguably worthwhile tradeoff for the increase in yield in the Midwest.
    With respect to leaching, the lack of improvements or setbacks in the all recommendation
    strategy are identical to the irrigation recommendation strategy by all statistical
    measures (i.e., same means, p-value of 97%) (Table S2). The effects of climate
    on performance are similarly identical to the effects of climate on the irrigation
    recommendation strategy. Compared to the current best-performing strategy, irrigation
    recommendation strategy, the changes in yield, leaching, and water use efficiency
    are statistically identical, despite nominal differences between the two. However,
    if one considers the complexity of the proposed practice and, subsequently, its
    appeal to farmers, the irrigation recommendation strategy is the better choice.
    Therefore, though they are statistically identical, the irrigation recommendation
    strategy is arguably the practice worth adopting. Meanwhile, the nitrogen recommendation
    strategy offers no statistical improvement to the common practice strategy and
    thus should not be recommended to farmers. 3.4. Study implications The gains in
    the irrigation recommendation and all recommendation strategies are also financially
    worthwhile improvements over the common practice strategy. For the irrigation
    recommendation strategy, a farmer in Cass County would gain on average 6,900 kg/ha
    in yield over 30 years (with negligible changes in leaching) just by slightly
    altering their irrigation amounts according to the vegetative stage. To grasp
    the impact of a 6,900 kg/ha improvement in yield, consider the following example.
    The average price of corn in the US was ¢12 per kg between 1989 and 2018 (FarmDoc,
    2021), and thus a farmer with a 500-hectare farm would gain $427,612.86 over a
    thirty-year period. This is a sizable amount increase with a very minimal shift
    from common practices in the region. Though the efficacy of this study is bounded
    by the study area, it can be easily expanded on a regional scale. To do so, Extension
    Educators would collect the common practices of different regions for different
    cultivars and soil types. Then, the Extension Educators would search for ways
    to optimize the common practices for each specific combination of region, cultivar,
    and soil types. Next, an innovization software platform would analyze how those
    variables could be improved for the study region. All of these individual rules
    could then be aggregated into a single decision support tool for a region, where
    farmers could easily access simple amendments to their common regional practices.
    Alternatively, in areas with low internet connectivity, Extension Educators could
    distribute the recommendations through simple pamphlets. Such an optimization
    platform excellently melds human decision-making and computer optimization, and
    outputs results that farmers can actually apply to their fields. 4. Conclusions
    This study examined the efficacy of agricultural innovization under three different
    strategies: the irrigation recommendation strategy, the nitrogen recommendation
    strategy, and the all recommendation strategy. Two of the three strategies (i.e.,
    the irrigation recommendation strategy and all recommendation strategy) both statistically
    significantly improved yields with no impact on nitrogen leaching. However, both
    strategies resulted in loss in water use efficiency. Though the drop was not critically
    significant for the Midwest, it is an area of improvement in future studies. Future
    studies should add a water efficiency objective to ensure that the innovization
    outputs solutions that are near-optimal in water efficiency as well as in yield,
    total water use, and leaching. Overall, the irrigation recommendation strategy
    is the best option to recommend to farmers, due to its high yield, lack of nitrogen
    leaching, and relative simplicity. Another room for growth is finding innovations
    that are specific to climate variabilities. In this study, the irrigation recommendation
    strategy only improved irrigation during wet seasons (Table 4), with normal and
    dry seasons exhibiting no statistically significant change from the common practice
    strategy. Though this is a promising outcome, there is room for improvement. Future
    studies should seek to perform innovizations on specific climate scenarios, which
    can then be designed into more intelligent amendments to the common practice strategy.
    This is well within reason, since seasonal climate forecasts are skillful enough
    to predict whether a growing season will be wet, normal, or dry climatologically.
    Other areas of future work include ground truth studies and different agricultural
    conventions. Specifically, though the model was thoroughly calibrated and validated
    on the study site, future work should attempt to implement the recommended practices
    in the field in order to validate their efficacy in the real world. Finally, the
    framework can and should be applied to other agricultural conventions, such as
    organic or regenerative farming. This is well within the capacity of our proposed
    framework and would entail changing the decision variables and objectives to those
    unique to the given agricultural system. In summary, this study demonstrates the
    efficacy of agricultural innovization. By considering the common practices of
    real farmers in a study region and optimizing the practices for 30 years of weather
    data, we generate practical and effective recommendations for farmers. By following
    our recommendations, simulated farmers were able to gain a 6,900 kg/ha increase
    in yield over thirty years of management. Moreover, these gains only incurred
    negligible changes in leaching levels and increased water use. Such methods are
    promising within a food system that needs to sustainably increase yields to feed
    an increasingly large and affluent global population. CRediT authorship contribution

  description: The crop-water production function (CWPF) is widely used to quantitatively
    describe relationships between crop water deficit and yield, and evaluate the
    effects of different irrigation strategies in agro-hydrological models. In order
    to reasonably and reliably estimate crop yield and optimize irrigation scheduling,
    a novel CWPF was proposed by combining the plant water deficit index (PWDI), estimated
    based on root-weighted soil water availability, with a daily water sensitivity
    index derived from a sigmoidal cumulative function. Parameterized using data from
    a two-year winter wheat field lysimetric experiment conducted in the North China
    Plain and from a previously published two-year spring maize field drip irrigation
    experiment in Inner Mongolia, China, the CWPFs provided reasonable estimation
    of different crop yields with different water stress response characteristics
    under different field environments. Through coupling the genetic algorithm with
    the integrated simulations of soil water dynamics, PWDI and CWPF in the soil-wheat
    system, an optimization procedure was developed to determine PWDI threshold combinations
    to timely trigger irrigation according to pre-designed crop water deficit status.
    Crop yield and water use efficiency (WUE) of winter wheat were estimated and compared
    under different optimized constant and variable PWDI threshold combinations. In
    addition, the effects of climate change on the optimized variable PWDI threshold
    combinations were investigated using 38 years of historic meteorological data.
    The results showed that regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) with a variable threshold
    combination, in which the sensitivity characteristics to water deficit were considered
    for the crop at different growth stages, was superior to a constant threshold
    in enhancing crop yield and WUE. Irrespective of the number of irrigation events
    (1, 2, 3 or 4) during the growing season, the coefficients of variation (CV) of
    optimized PWDI thresholds for different combinations of irrigation sequence and
    events were not very large under the same kind of hydrological year (wet, normal
    or dry), with CV < 0.39 and a median of 0.21. When the mean (MN) of the optimized
    PWDI threshold combinations for different irrigation sequence and events was used
    to schedule RDI of winter wheat in terms of various hydrological years, up to
    91% of the estimated relative yield was found to be higher than 90% of the corresponding
    maximum values. Therefore, the MN can be valuable in formulating rational irrigation
    management strategies of winter wheat to achieve relatively high yields with limited
    water under changing climatic conditions.

    Introduction Due to growing competition from cities, industry, and the environment
    for limited fresh water resources, scarcity of water for agriculture is becoming
    an increasingly serious problem in arid and semiarid regions (Elliott et al.,
    2014). Efficient water use in crop production, which is greatly dependent on proper
    irrigation scheduling to influence water use by the crop and its final yield,
    is vital for the development of sustainable agriculture. To pursue relatively
    high crop yield and water use efficiency (WUE) with a limited water supply, irrigation
    scheduling is often determined based on time-consuming and costly large-scale
    field irrigation experiments. However, results of such experiments are often only
    suitable for the specific soil and climatic conditions in which they were conducted
    (Arora et al., 1987). Numerical simulations offer an alternative more efficient
    and economic method to schedule irrigation by quantifying the relationship between
    crop yield/WUE and irrigation water. Such use of numerical simulations to optimize
    irrigation scheduling has gained popularity over the last decades (Shi et al.,
    2020, Shi et al., 2021, Dabach et al., 2013). Models, including those driven by
    radiation, carbon, and/or water, have been developed to simulate crop growth and
    yield formation under various irrigation regimes (Diepen et al., 1989, Jones et
    al., 2003, Steduto et al., 2009). These models often require comprehensive and
    complicated, and quite difficult to determine, input parameters associated with
    various physiological processes (e.g. photosynthesis, transpiration, and respiration).
    In comparison, through directly and empirically relating crop yield to water availability,
    a crop-water production function (CWPF) greatly simplifies the estimation of crop
    yield by using a readily obtained variable such as irrigation amount (Stewart
    and Hagan, 1973), soil water storage (Morgan et al., 1980; Huang, 2004), evapotranspiration
    (Jensen, 1968, Igbadun et al., 2007) or transpiration (Hanks and Hill, 1980, Woli
    et al., 2014). CWPFs have been extensively employed by different agro-hydrological
    models to evaluate pre-designed irrigation strategies (Oweis and Hachum, 2009,
    Smilovic et al., 2016). Among the variables used to represent water availability,
    transpiration (Ta) should be one of the most appropriate parameters for assessing
    crop yield since Ta is closely related to photosynthetic assimilation (essentially
    a physiological water-consuming process) and yield formation (Ben-Gal et al.,
    2003). Generally, Ta is estimated by taking into account information such as meteorological
    data, leaf area index and average root-zone soil water content (SWC) or potential,
    as demonstrated by the classic Penman-Monteith formula (Allen et al., 1998, Lai
    and Katul, 2000). In this method, only the effect of soil water amount on crop
    water use is considered, while the effect of relative distribution pattern of
    soil water to roots is ignored, likely resulting in inaccurate estimation of Ta
    (Lai and Katul, 2000, Shi et al., 2015). In order to overcome this shortcoming,
    Ta can be estimated using a root water uptake (RWU) model based on root distribution
    (Jarvis, 1989, Šimůnek and Hopmans, 2009). Thereupon, different forms of CWPFs
    are constructed according to the relationship between relative yield and relative
    Ta during the whole growth season or by stages. Compared to season-based CWPF,
    stage-based functions better capture the differences in water sensitivity of crops
    at different growing periods and more reasonably describe the relationship between
    crop yield and Ta (Ben-Gal et al., 2003; Foster and Brozovi, 2018). Nevertheless,
    the application of stage-based CWPFs in agricultural production is still subject
    to some critical limitations as follows. First, root information, usually characterized
    by root length density (RLD) distribution, while indispensable for a RWU model
    to estimate crop transpiration and to evaluate crop water deficit, is difficult
    and time-consuming to acquire reliably, especially in the field. It is fortunate
    to find that the distribution of normalized RLD (NRLD) vs. normalized root depth
    for a number of specific crops (e.g. wheat, cotton, maize, and rice) could be
    statistically described using a general function, independent of soil properties,
    crop species, growing stages, climate, and other environmental conditions (Wu
    et al., 1999, Zuo et al., 2013, Ning et al., 2015). By introducing NRLD as a weighting
    factor for available soil water in the root zone, a root-weighted plant water
    deficit index (PWDI) was put forward to characterize the extent of crop water
    deficit (Shi et al., 2015). The index was reliable in estimating Ta conveniently
    and accurately, and thus should be helpful for constructing a CWPF to predict
    crop yield under various water deficit scenarios. Moreover, the sensitivity index
    (λ) for each growth stage is an important parameter in stage-based CWPFs. Its
    optimization often depends on laborious field experiments with various irrigation
    treatments. The accuracy of λ is susceptible to the artificial division of growth
    stages, which is usually subjective or even arbitrary. More specifically, too
    few growth stage divisions (i.e. long intervals) may be detrimental to capture
    the water sensitive response dynamics of crops, which likely results in the lack
    of sensitivity information in some key growth periods, and makes the triggering
    or scheduling of irrigation untimely or irrational. However, too many growth stage
    divisions (short intervals) can easily lead to instability, non-unique or even
    exceeding the reasonable range (such as negative values) of the optimized λ. A
    few research results showed that a cumulative function would be useful to determine
    λ at different timescales (Shang and Mao, 2006, Han et al., 2010). A typically
    low-high-low bell-shaped distribution of λ changing with time has been observed
    over the whole growth period for a variety of crops such as wheat, maize, cotton,
    soybean and rice. Its cumulative process over time was roughly in line with an
    S-shaped curve and able to be well described using a sigmoidal or logistic cumulative
    function (Kipkorir and Raes, 2002, Georgiou and Papamichail, 2008). The effect
    of water deficit on yield formation is a continuous process with crop growth.
    Therefore, the employment of a sigmoidal cumulative function should be physically
    sound and enable robust estimation of λ at a small timescale (e.g. daily) on the
    basis of solving problems such as missing sensitivity information and instability
    of optimization caused by artificial growth stage divisions. In summary, it would
    be wise to establish a novel CWPF combining a PWDI (used to indicate the degree
    of crop water deficit) estimated based on root-weighted soil water availability
    and a sigmoidal cumulative function (used to evaluate the daily water sensitivity
    index λ). However, the accuracy and reliability of this method in estimating crop
    yield awaits further research. CWPFs have been widely used for optimizing the
    irrigation quota in each pre-designed growth stage, but rarely for determining
    the specific irrigation frequency, which should be dependent on the degree of
    crop water deficit or PWDI. Undoubtedly, choosing a reasonable PWDI threshold
    is critical for initiating each irrigation event. Both crop yield and WUE are
    found to change with changing PWDI thresholds. The relationships, usually obtained
    through irrigation experiments (Irmak et al., 2000, Emekli et al., 2007, Candogan
    et al., 2013, Shi et al., 2020) or numerical simulations (Shi et al., 2021), can
    be used to optimize the PWDI threshold, whether chosen as constant throughout
    the growth season or variable according to artificially pre-designed growth stages.
    However, due to the limited experimental conditions or simulation scenarios, the
    thresholds would represent a local optimum under those pre-designed conditions
    or scenarios, but not a global optimum for all possible situations. In addition,
    optimized PWDI thresholds, whether constant or variable, often originate from
    a specific seasonal climatic condition, without any consideration of the impact
    of climate change. Influenced by intra and inter seasonal climatic variability,
    the root-zone soil water availability for PWDI estimation is likely to change
    continuously and significantly, thus resulting in constantly changing PWDI thresholds
    optimized during various seasons, which are hard to be applied to trigger irrigation
    in practice. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate and evaluate the effect
    of changing climatic conditions on PWDI threshold optimization. A truly global
    optimum PWDI threshold acquired from the proposed CWPF necessitates the incorporation
    of optimization algorithms (Singh and Panda, 2013, Singh, 2014). The genetic algorithm
    (GA) is a global search optimization procedure based on the mechanism of natural
    selection and genetics combining artificial survival of the fittest with genetic
    operators (Holland, 1975). With the significant advantages of high efficiency
    and strong robustness in parallel computation, the GA has become a powerful tool
    for highly complex optimization problems (Wang et al., 2010, Sotomayor et al.,
    2018) and should be more suitable for optimizing PWDI thresholds based on CWPF
    than other traditional optimization algorithms such as linear programming, dynamic
    programming or Simplex method (Wen et al., 2017, Li et al., 2018). In summary,
    accurate evaluation of crop water deficit and water sensitivity is critical for
    reasonably constructing a CWPF and thereby for optimization of irrigation scheduling
    through a global search optimization algorithm like GA. It would be helpful to
    delineate the extent of crop water deficit using a PWDI based on available soil
    water weighted by the NRLD distribution and to derive water sensitivity dynamics
    from the cumulative function of a water sensitivity index. Therefore, the main
    objectives of this study were to (1) construct a novel CWPF by combining root-weighted
    soil water availability based PWDI with a cumulative function of sensitivity index,
    and to evaluate its accuracy and reliability in predicting crop yield using two
    multi-year field experiments on different crops (winter wheat and spring maize)
    under different climatic zones (Beijing and Inner Mongolia), soil types (loam
    and sandy), and irrigation methods (surface and drip irrigation); and (2) develop
    an optimization procedure of PWDI threshold determination and use by coupling
    GA into the integrated model including the simulations of soil water dynamics,
    PWDI and CWPF, and apply it to investigate and analyze the differences of crop
    yield and WUE resulting from irrigation scheduling controlled by either constant
    or variable PWDI irrigation thresholds or from the effects of changes in meteorological
    conditions due to climate change. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Field lysimetric
    experiment 2.1.1. Experimental site and design Data from a two-year field lysimetric
    experiment conducted in the North China Plain from September 2014 and 2015 to
    June the next year were used to parameterize and evaluate a CWPF based on root-weighted
    soil water availability. The field work was carried out at the National Experimental
    Station for Precision Agriculture in Changping District, Beijing (40°10′31′ N,
    116°26′10′′ E, altitude 50.1 m), a warm temperate continental monsoon climate
    zone with 185 annual mean frost-free days, sunshine duration of 2600 h, and precipitation
    of 543 mm, of which 70% falls in the period between June and September. Supplemental
    irrigation is necessary in the region for agricultural production of winter wheat
    sown at the end of September and harvested in early June of the next year. Additional
    details regarding the experimental site were presented in Wu et al. (2017). On
    29 September 2014 and 2015, winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L. Nongda 212) was
    sown in 14 weighing lysimeters (230 cm high × 75 cm wide × 100 cm long, 0.05 mm
    in precision) at a density of 6.7 × 106 plants ha−1. Space around the lysimeters
    was also planted at the same density to avoid margin effects. Layout of lysimeters
    in the field was detailed in Wu et al. (2020). Before sowing, all lysimeters were
    uniformly watered in order to maintain optimal soil water conditions for the growth
    of winter wheat during seedling stage. The steel box of each lysimeter was filled
    in by excavating original soil monoliths taken from a nearby field, with three
    undisturbed distinct loam soil layers (Table 1). Soil physical properties were
    measured using the following standard methods: the gravitational liquid sedimentation
    technique for soil particle composition (Gee and Or, 2002); constant head method
    for saturated hydraulic conductivity (Klute and Dirksen, 1986); and pressure membrane
    plate for soil water retention characteristics (Soil Moisture Equipment Co., USA),
    fitted through the closed-form equation of van Genuchten (1980) and used to obtain
    the field capacity as the SWC corresponding to the soil matric potential of −
    300 cm (Romano and Santini, 2002). Totally six (T1, T2, T3, T4, T5 and T6, 2014–2015)
    and seven (T7, T8, T9, T10, T11, T12 and T13, 2015–2016) irrigation treatments
    were respectively designed for the two growth seasons of winter wheat. The dates
    and amount of irrigation for each treatment are detailed in Table 2. For treatments
    T1 and T7, irrigation was applied every 1–3 d from 203 and 191 days after sowing
    (DAS), respectively, to maintain sufficient water supply for the growth of winter
    wheat. Treatments T6 and T13 were fully covered by plastic film and did not receive
    any irrigation during the season. Rainfall was completely prevented by a movable
    rain-shelter from greening until harvest. Table 1. Soil properties: texture (content

    lysimetric experiment included meteorological data, SWC and crop information,
    which were obtained through the methods or procedures respectively described as
    follows. (1) Meteorological data: Meteorological data at study site (including
    air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed) were monitored
    and recorded by an automatic agro-meteorological station (WeatherHawk 500, Campbell
    Scientific, USA). (2) SWC: At the wheat turning green stage (168 DAS), the SWC
    was measured by a calibrated capacitance probe (Diviner 2000, Sentek, Australia)
    at 10 cm intervals from soil surface to 160 cm depth. This was used as the initial
    condition to verify the soil water transport model. From heading (2015) or jointing
    (2016) to maturity (198–244 DAS; 188–244 DAS), the SWC in each lysimeter was measured
    daily to estimate PWDI dynamics. (3) Crop information: ● Leaf area: Five winter
    wheat plants from each lysimeter were randomly pre-selected to measure the length
    and width of green leaves at a 5–7 d interval, and then leaf area was calculated
    as a product of the measured length, width and a measured conversion coefficient
    of 0.77 (Wu et al., 2017). ● Transpiration: Daily actual transpiration rate under
    each treatment was determined by deducting actual soil evaporation rate (under
    the treatments other than film mulched T6 and T13), estimated according to weather
    data, leaf area index and surface SWC using the modified Penman equation (Ritchie,
    1972, Wu et al., 1999), from actual evapotranspiration rate obtained through weighing.
    The actual soil evaporation rate was assumed to be negligible for the film mulched
    treatments of T6 and T13. ● Grain yield: All the winter wheat plants in each lysimeter
    were removed to measure grain yield at harvest. 2.2. Theoretical background 2.2.1.
    Crop-water production function (CWPF) A multiplicative approach proposed by Rao
    et al. (1988) was employed to relate relative yield (Ya/Yp) to relative transpiration
    rates (Ta/Tp) of different growth stages, viz. (1) where Ya and Yp are actual
    and potential yields, respectively (kg ha−1); Ta and Tp are averages of actual
    and potential transpiration rates during the ith (i = 1, 2, 3, …, n) growth stage
    (mm d−1), respectively, and n is the number of growth stage divisions; 1 - Ta/Tp
    is the plant water deficit index (PWDI) representing the extent of crop water
    deficit (Woli et al., 2012, Shi et al., 2015); λi is the sensitivity index of
    the ith stage. As aforementioned, the application of Eq. (1) suffers from lack
    of consideration regarding the effect of root distribution on Ta estimation, and
    subjective or even arbitrary division of specific growth stages. A recently proposed
    root-weighted PWDI was useful to improve the estimation accuracy of the extent
    of crop water deficit by taking both soil water amount and relative distribution
    of soil water to roots into account (Shi et al., 2015). A sigmoidal cumulative
    function of sensitivity index provided an effective way to describe the response
    of yield formation to continuous water deficit dynamics and allowed the acquisition
    of sensitivity index at a daily timescale, which should be helpful for mitigating
    the adverse effects caused by the artificial division of growth stages (Shang
    and Mao, 2006, Han et al., 2010). Hence, root-weighted PWDI and cumulative function
    of sensitivity index were combined to revise Eq. (1) as: (2) where t is the day
    after sowing (d); T is the number of days between sowing and maturity; PWDIt is
    the root-weighted soil water availability based PWDI on the tth day (as described
    in Section 2.2.2); λt is the λ on the tth day, estimated with a sigmoidal cumulative
    function (as described in Section 2.2.3). 2.2.2. Root-weighted PWDI estimation
    The PWDI based on root-weighted soil water availability was estimated as (Shi
    et al., 2015, Wu et al., 2017): (3) where h is the soil matric potential (cm);
    zr (= z/Lr) is the normalized soil depth, i.e. the ratio of soil depth z (cm)
    to the maximum rooting depth Lr (cm), in which Lr is simulated by a root growth
    model relating the root penetration rate with the soil water content, sand content,
    bulk density and temperature as proposed by Asseng et al. (1997); Lnrd(zr) is
    the normalized root length density (NRLD); γ(h) is the soil water stress response
    function quantifying the effect of soil water stress on RWU or transpiration,
    which can be expressed in linear (Feddes et al., 1978) or nonlinear (van Genuchten,
    1987, Musters and Bouten, 1999, Homaee et al., 2002) forms. For the sake of simplicity,
    a piecewise linear function was chosen in this study (Feddes et al., 1978): (4)
    where hH, hL and hW are the thresholds of anaerobiosis point, optimal soil water
    condition and wilting point (cm), adopted according to the recommended values
    of − 50, − 400 and − 15,000 cm, respectively (Feddes et al., 1976). The parameters
    appearing in Section 2.2 and their values are summarized in Table 3 together with
    source references. Table 3. Overview of the parameters contained in Section 2.2
    and their sources. Parameters Unit Meaning Value Source hH cm Anaerobiosis point

    et al. (2017) k – Fitting parameter 23.38 Calibrated b – Fitting parameter 3.53
    Calibrated m – Fitting parameter 1.04 Calibrated Since it was impossible to destructively
    sample roots during the growing season of winter wheat, a generalized function
    was utilized to estimate NRLD as (Zuo et al., 2013): (5) where p is a shape parameter
    denoting the NRLD at the soil surface, recommended as 3.85 for wheat by Zuo et
    al. (2013). The generalized function was established and tested using a large
    amount of measured NRLD data for wheat from published papers and their own experiments
    (1179 data points in total). The statistical analysis showed that the prediction
    uncertainty interval of the generalized function along the profile was within
    ± 0.16 under a confidence level of 95%, indicating that it should be feasible
    and reliable to be utilized in most cases (Wu et al., 2021). 2.2.3. Cumulative
    function of sensitivity index (λ) The cumulative sensitivity index of λ can be
    (and has often been) expressed as a sigmoidal function of physical time such as
    days after emergence or sowing. However, due to the fact that the crop growth
    cycle (i.e. phenological phase) is highly dependent on changing environments (including
    meteorological conditions), the function is prone to be unstable and inapplicable
    especially when conditions fluctuate drastically. A normalized heat unit index
    (Ht, ranging between 0 and 1) calculated based on growing degree days (GDD) describes
    the crop growth cycle more stably than physical time (Ojeda-Bustamante et al.,
    2004). Thus, a more general sigmoidal curve was employed to describe the cumulative
    λ (named as Ct) as a function of Ht as follows (Han et al., 2010): (6) where k,
    b and m are the fitting parameters. When Ht → 0, Ct → 0, denoting little sensitivity
    of crop yield to water deficit at sowing; when 0 < Ht < 1, Ct increases with increasing
    Ht in an S-shape; when Ht → 1, Ct changes little (→ m), indicating crop yield
    is insensitive to water deficit at maturity. In Eq. (6), Ht was estimated as:
    (7) in which, where Tave is the average daily air temperature (°C); Hm is the
    potential heat units required for the maturation (°C), a cultivar- and environment-dependent
    parameter identified as 1750 °C for winter wheat according to the measurement
    in the lysimetric experiment; Tu and Tb are the optimal and base temperatures
    for crop growth, and set to 30 and 0 °C for winter wheat, respectively (Wang et
    al., 2013). According to Eq. (6), daily λ (named as λt) was calculated as: (8)
    2.2.4. Simulation of soil water dynamics The Richards equation was employed to
    simulate one-dimensional vertical soil water flow in a soil-wheat system (van
    Genuchten, 1987): (9) (10) (11) (12) where C(h) is soil water capacity (cm−1);
    K(h) is unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (cm d−1); h0(z) is the initial distribution
    of soil matric potential (cm); L (≥ Lr) is the simulation depth (cm); hL(t) is
    the soil matric potential at the lower boundary (cm); ε(t) is the water ﬂow rate
    from soil surface (cm d−1), i.e. the infiltration rate of irrigation/precipitation
    water (ε (t) > 0) or evaporation rate (ε (t) ≤ 0); S(z, t) is the actual RWU rate
    (cm3 cm−3 d−1), estimated using a macroscopic RWU model as: (13) where Smax(z,
    t) is the maximal RWU rate under optimal soil water condition (cm3 cm−3 d−1).
    The potential transpiration rate (Tp) was computed as (Mailhol et al., 1997):
    (14) where ETp is the potential evapotranspiration rate (mm d−1), estimated with
    the Penman-Monteith equation recommended by FAO-56 (Allen et al., 1998); LAI is
    the leaf area index (cm2 cm−2). 2.2.5. Optimization of the PWDI threshold Through
    coupling the optimization algorithm of GA with the integrated simulations including
    soil water dynamics (under various irrigation regimes), PWDI (estimated on the
    basis of simulated soil water dynamics) and CWPF (used to predict the final yields
    of different simulation scenarios), a procedure to optimize PWDI threshold was
    proposed as follows (Fig. 1): (1) Define the objective function as maximizing
    the relative yield (Yr = Ya/Yp): (15) where q is the irrigation times; PWDIv is
    a q-dimension vector of PWDI threshold. The quota for each irrigation (I, cm)
    was determined according to the difference between the simulated SWC (θ, cm3 cm−3)
    and field water capacity (θf, target water content, cm3 cm−3) (Shi et al., 2015):
    (16) where β is the designed percentage of wetting area, fixed as 100% for surface
    irrigation in this study; Dw is the designed wetting depth (cm), set as 60 cm
    to prevent deep leakage (Wu et al., 2017). Download : Download high-res image
    (184KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Flow chart for optimizing
    plant water deficit index (PWDI) thresholds based on the genetic algorithm (GA).
    PWDIv is the combination or vector of variable PWDI threshold. CWPF is the crop-water
    production function. (2) Initialize GA parameters. The population size, representing
    the number of individuals (i.e. PWDIv), was set to 50. The maximum iteration number
    of optimization was set to 80 to meet the computation requirement of stable solution.
    The crossover probability of 0.85 was chosen to ensure a relatively fast convergence
    to the global optimum. The mutation probability of 0.15 was used to avoid optimized
    results in local minima. The initial vector element values of first PWDIv generation
    were automatically generated using the \"rand\" function provided by MATLAB software
    (R2014a, MathWorks Inc., MA, USA). (3) Use the measured SWC at greening stage
    of winter wheat as the initial condition and simulate soil water dynamics ((9),
    (10), (11), (12)), estimate daily PWDI (Eq. (3)), and predict final Yr (Eq. (2)).
    This Yr was used as the initial fitness of individuals. (4) Select the individual
    with the highest fitness from the previous generation individuals and move it
    to the next generation. The remaining individuals are then adjusted through crossover
    and mutation operations and moved to the next generation as well. (5) Simulate
    the fitness (Yr) of the newest generation individuals as described in Step (3),
    and repeat Step (4) to generate new individuals and transfer them into the next
    generation. (6) Repeat Steps (4) and (5) until the real-time iteration number
    reached designed maximum value, and then output optimal PWDIv and the corresponding
    Yr (Fig. 1). 2.2.6. Simulation scenarios The numerical simulation lasted from
    greening to maturity of winter wheat, with the measured SWC at greening stage
    in 2016 used as the initial condition of the scenario simulation. Two scenarios
    were set considering the effects of intra and inter seasonal climatic variability
    on the optimization of PWDI threshold, respectively. For the specific intra-season
    weather conditions observed at the field experimental station in 2016, two kinds
    of PWDI thresholds, constant and variable, were designed as follows: • Constant
    threshold: During the simulation period, the PWDI threshold was kept as a constant,
    and increased from 0.01 to 0.99 with an interval of 0.01 to generate 99 cases.
    In each case, the SWC, PWDI, Yr, and IWUEr (relative irrigation water use efficiency,
    i.e. the ratio of simulated IWUE to its maximum value) were simulated, respectively.
    The irrigation water use efficiency IWUE (kg m−3) was calculated to evaluate the
    practical productivity of total irrigation water input as: (17) where Ii is the
    quota of the ith irrigation (cm). • Variable threshold: Considering that there
    are usually no more than four irrigation events for winter wheat after the greening
    stage in the North China Plain, we designed four irrigation schemes with winter
    wheat irrigated 1, 2, 3 and 4 times, and then utilized the optimization procedure
    to determine the optimal PWDI threshold combination as well as the corresponding
    Yr and IWUEr. The impact of inter seasonal meteorological variability was explored
    according to the local hydrological year (i.e., wet, normal, and dry year with
    precipitation frequency P = 0–25%, 25–75%, and 75–100%, respectively), which was
    based on 38 years (1981–2018) of historic daily meteorological data (e.g. maximum
    and minimum air temperature, relative air humidity, precipitation, wind speed,
    and solar radiation) from a nearby meteorological observation station of the experimental
    station. The numerical simulation also started from the measured SWC distribution
    at greening stage in 2016, and optimized variable PWDI threshold under four irrigation
    schemes with 1–4 irrigation events. 3. Results 3.1. Estimation of PWDI According
    to measured soil matric potential distributions and a generalized NRLD function
    (Eq. (5)), daily PWDI under each deficit irrigation treatment (T2-T6 in 2015 and
    T8-T13 in 2016) during the post-greening period of winter wheat was estimated
    with Eq. (3), and compared to the measured value in Fig. 2. As defined, the measured
    PWDI was computed as the ratio of water deficit (Tp - Ta) and water demand Tp
    (Woli et al., 2012, Shi et al., 2015), in which Ta under each deficit irrigation
    treatment was identified as the difference between measured actual evapotranspiration
    rate from lysimeters and calculated evaporation rate by the modified Penman equation
    (Ritchie, 1972, Wu et al., 2017). Tp was determined by calibrating the measured
    transpiration rate under sufficient irrigation (T1 in 2015 and T7 in 2016) to
    consider the effect of differences in growth levels (reflected using the effective
    leaf area index) of plants exposed to different water stresses (Wu et al., 2017,
    Wu et al., 2020). The estimated PWDI under each deficit irrigation treatment decreased
    immediately following irrigation, and then increased gradually due to the loss
    of soil water by evapotranspiration until the next irrigation (Fig. 2), in good
    agreement with the measured value with an overall determination coefficient (R2),
    Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) and root mean squared error (RMSE)
    of 0.78, 0.77 and 0.10, respectively (Table 4). Download : Download high-res image

    greening, sufficient water was supplied for winter wheat in the field lysimetric
    experiment. The CWPF was constructed for the duration between greening and maturity.
    The estimation of PWDI in 2015 and 2016 started from 198 and 188 DAS, respectively,
    due to the lack of some SWC measurements at the early greening period (166–197
    DAS in 2015 and 166–187 DAS in 2016). The missing estimated daily PWDIs, which
    were needed for constructing CWPF, were supplied by their corresponding measured
    values (Fig. 2). In CWPF (Eq. (2)), the potential yield (Yp) was approximated
    to be the average (10.7 × 103 kg ha−1) of the measured yields under sufficient
    irrigation treatments T1 and T7. Daily sensitivity index (λt) was estimated according
    to (6), (7), (8), where three fitting parameters k, b and m in Eq. (6) were optimized
    by a nonlinear least-squares method as: k = 23.38, b = 3.53 and m = 1.04 (Table
    3). The changing processes of cumulative (Ct) and daily (λt) sensitivity index

    Ct naturally generated a low-high-low bell shape of λt. The value of λt reached
    its peak of 0.023 at Ht = 0.71, with corresponding Ct = 0.56. With the optimized
    parameters, Ya under different irrigation treatments were estimated using the
    CWPF and compared well with the measured values (Fig. 4), with a R2 of 0.84, NSE
    of 0.79, RMSE of 776 kg ha−1, and a normalized RMSE of 0.098, respectively. Download

    wheat 3.3.1. Simulation of soil water flow in the soil-wheat system The information
    on soil water dynamics, simulated through (9), (10), (11), (12), is necessary
    for calculating PWDI. To test the reliability of the model, treatments T3 and
    T5 from the first growing season, and T9 and T11 from the second growing season
    were chosen to simulate the dynamics of SWC distributions during the period from
    greening to maturity of winter wheat. (9), (10), (11), (12) were solved numerically
    using the implicit finite difference scheme (Wu et. al, 2021). In the simulation,
    the SWC profile measured at greening (168 DAS) was used as the initial condition;
    the upper boundary condition was specified as the evaporation or infiltration
    rate; the lower boundary condition (L = 100 cm) was determined by the linear interpolation
    of two successive soil water measurements during the simulation process. The results
    showed that, whether in soil layer of 0–30 cm or 30–60 cm, under various irrigation
    treatments, the simulated average SWCs were found to match the measurements well
    (Fig. 5a – d), with the RMSE consistently less than 0.03 cm3 cm−3, and R2 and
    NSE greater than 0.86 and 0.53, respectively. The established model therefore
    appeared to be reliable and reasonable for simulating soil water flow in the soil-wheat
    system. Download : Download high-res image (331KB) Download : Download full-size

    and (d) T11 in 2016. DAS = days after sowing. 3.3.2. Effects of the irrigation
    schemes controlled by constant and variable PWDI threshold When constant PWDI
    thresholds were maintained over the period from greening to maturity, gradual
    increase in their values from 0.01 to 0.99 with an interval of 0.01 led to decrease
    in the number of simulated irrigation events (and total irrigation depth) from
    86 times (52.7 cm) to zero (Fig. 6a). Under the fixed irrigation events (corresponding
    to different PWDI thresholds, as shown by the dashed rectangle in Fig. 6a), total
    irrigation depth was found to increase with increasing PWDI threshold. Simulated
    relationships between PWDI threshold and relative yield (Yr), and relative irrigation
    water use efficiency (IWUEr) are shown in Fig. 6b. Increasing PWDI threshold (corresponding
    to gradually more serious crop water stress) caused Yr to decline from a maximum
    close to 1 to a minimum of 0.39 when PWDI threshold = 0.99. Changes in IWUEr were
    more complicated. The changing process of IWUEr vs. PWDI threshold could generally
    be divided into two stages. At the first stage when the threshold was less than
    0.90, IWUEr increased gradually from a minimum of 0.39 (corresponding IWUE = 2.26 kg m−3)
    at threshold of 0.01 to a maximum of 1.00 (5.79 kg m−3) at threshold of 0.90.
    At the second stage IWUEr rapidly decreased to 0.69 (3.99 kg m−3) at threshold
    of 0.94 (no calculation required for IWUEr at the threshold of > 0.94 due to the
    lack of irrigation event (Fig. 6a)). Additionally, IWUEr was observed to change
    periodically with irrigation events, showing a gradual deceasing trend with increasing
    PWDI threshold in each cycle with fixed irrigation events. Download : Download

    value. The labels \"low\" and \"high\" represent the relatively low and high PWDI
    thresholds for fixed number of irrigation events (e.g. 3 events), respectively.
    Through the procedure based on GA, the variable PWDI threshold combinations for
    triggering irrigation events were optimized, and thereupon a corresponding irrigation
    quantity for each event (Eq. (16)), final Yr (Eq. (2)) and IWUEr (Eq. (17)) was
    obtained (Table 5). In general, both total irrigation depth (the sum of each irrigation
    quantity) and Yr increased, but IWUEr decreased with increasing number of irrigation
    events due to gradually improved water supply and thus reduced water deficit.
    Specifically, for a single irrigation event, the PWDI threshold {irrigation quantity}
    was optimized as 0.90 {11.19 cm} at Ht = 0.70 (corresponding to around flowering-filling
    stage), leading to a Yr of 0.53 and an IWUEr of 1.00. For two irrigation events,
    the PWDI threshold {irrigation quantity} combination was optimized as [0.86, 0.36]
    and {[10.08, 9.20 cm]}, corresponding to around late jointing stage (Ht = 0.55)
    and flowering-filling stage (0.68), and a Yr of 0.77 and an IWUEr of 0.84 were
    obtained. Note that square brackets [] are used to denote PWDI threshold and irrigation
    quota combinations or vectors, and curly brackets {} distinguish irrigation quota
    from PWDI threshold. For three irrigation events, the PWDI threshold combination
    was optimized as [0.80, 0.46, 0.35] {[9.25, 8.69, 8.60 cm]}, corresponding to
    around middle jointing stage (Ht = 0.47), booting-heading stage (0.57) and flowering-filling
    stage (0.70), and Yr increased to a higher level of 0.84 but IWUEr decreased to
    a smaller value of 0.67. For four irrigation events, the PWDI threshold combination
    was optimized as [0.55, 0.48, 0.19, 0.25] {[8.02, 8.05, 7.37, 7.62 cm]}, corresponding
    to around early jointing stage (Ht = 0.41), late jointing stage (0.51), booting-heading
    stage (0.59) and flowering-filling stage (0.71), which generated the highest Yr
    of 0.88 but lowest IWUEr of 0.60 among four designed irrigation scenarios. Table

    results from variable PWDI thresholds, corresponding Yr, IWUEr, and other related
    optimization parameters such as the value of PWDI threshold, Ht, and irrigation
    quantity based on a constant PWDI threshold including both low and high values
    for a fixed number of irrigation events are also shown in Table 5. When the number
    of irrigation events was fixed as 2, 3, and 4, Yr (IWUEr) was 24–26% (33–40%),
    22–38% (31–68%) and 9–22% (22–58%) higher than those with low-high constant threshold,
    respectively. 3.3.3. Optimization of variable PWDI threshold combinations under
    different climatic conditions The effects of varying meteorological conditions
    due to climate change on the optimization results of variable PWDI threshold combinations
    were investigated and evaluated by numerical simulation using the optimization
    procedure according to the historic meteorological data in the study area from
    1981 to 2018. The numerical simulation for each growth season included four irrigation
    schemes with 1–4 irrigation events starting from the field measured SWC distribution
    at greening stage in 2016. By running the optimization procedure repeatedly as
    presented in Fig. 1, maximum relative crop yield (Yr, max) and corresponding optimal
    PWDI threshold (PWDIopt) combinations for four different irrigation schemes were
    simulated for all the 38 growing seasons. The Yr, max and precipitation (Pr) during
    the growing season (between greening and maturity) of winter wheat over the 38
    years from 1981 to 2018 are shown in Fig. 7. The changing tendency of Yr, max
    was found to be positively correlated to Pr with the Pearson correlation coefficient
    varying between 0.69 and 0.77 (P < 0.01), independent of number of irrigation
    events. In addition, Yr, max increased with increasing number of irrigation events,
    but its increasing rate tended to slow down gradually. For example, the average
    Yr, max (0.70) for a single irrigation over the 38 years was 15.7%, 20.5% and
    23.9% respectively lower than those for two (0.83), three (0.88) or four (0.92)
    irrigation events. Download : Download high-res image (152KB) Download : Download

    precipitation (Pr) during the growth season (between greening and maturity) of
    winter wheat over the 38 years from 1981 to 2018. Frequency analysis results of
    precipitation data showed that the 38 years were comprised of nine wet years (e.g.
    1987, 1998, 2008) with precipitation frequency P = 0–25%, 20 normal years (e.g.
    1991, 2002, 2018) with P = 25–75% and nine dry years (e.g. 1982, 1986, 2013) with
    P = 75–100%. The relationship between optimized PWDI threshold (PWDIopt) and frequency
    P was influenced by both irrigation sequence and number of irrigation events (Fig.
    8a–j). For each combination of irrigation sequence and number of irrigation events,
    all the values of PWDIopt in the same type of hydrological year were averaged
    and shown in Fig. 8a–j with a dashed line. Irrespective of how many irrigation
    events winter wheat received after the greening stage, the mean PWDIopt of the
    1st irrigation increased to a higher level when P rose from 0% to 25% to 25–75%
    (viz. with decreasing precipitation and increasing drought degree), and then tended
    to be approximately stable at the second rising round of P from 25% to 75% to
    75–100% (Figs. 8a, 8b, 8d, 8g). A similar trend was observed for the mean PWDIopt
    of the 2nd irrigation but the increment of its first rising round was greatly
    reduced (Figs. 8c, 8e, 8h), while little change was observed for the mean PWDIopt
    of the 3rd or 4th irrigation with P value (Figs. 8f, 8i, 8j). In addition, when
    irrigated with 2, 3 or 4 events, the mean PWDIopt of the 1st irrigation (Figs.
    8b, 8d and 8g) was much higher than those of other sequential irrigations (Figs.
    8c, 8e–f and 8h–j). Download : Download high-res image (380KB) Download : Download

    and CWPF evaluation Root-weighted PWDI estimation seems to provide a reliable
    method to evaluate the extent of crop water deficit (Fig. 2, Table 4). One explanation
    for its success probably lies in its rigorous consideration of the effect of relative
    distribution patterns of soil water to roots on crop water use (Shi et al., 2015,
    Wu et al., 2017). Nevertheless, the estimated PWDI failed to match a few fluctuations
    of measured PWDI, likely resulting from occasionally sharp changes of a meteorological
    variable such as solar radiation (Wu et al., 2017) or the unavoidable hysteresis
    effect of previous water stress on transpiration (Wu et al., 2020, Wu et al.,
    2021). For example, the measured PWDIs under treatment T12 on 211 and 228 DAS
    (0.25 and 0.26) were observed to be obviously lower than their estimated values
    (0.60 and 0.67, Fig. 2j). This is presumably explained by the sudden decrease
    of solar radiation from 11.7 and 15.1 MJ m−2 d−1 on the previous days to 2.9 and
    2.2 MJ m−2 d−1, respectively, leading to the lowest R2 of 0.42 among all the irrigation
    treatments (Table 4). In addition, different from the estimated PWDIs simultaneously
    and sharply decreasing close to zero after re-watering on 216, 230 and 239 DAS
    due to abruptly improved soil water status, the measured PWDIs at the post-irrigation
    corresponding durations of 216–218, 230–233, and 239–242 DAS under treatment T2
    tended to decline gradually and deviate far from the estimated values (Fig. 2a),
    thus leading to the lowest NSE of 0.11. We attribute this phenomenon when plant
    response lags behind water status changes in soil, and is therefore hard to predict,
    mainly to the hysteresis effect of previous water stress (Anderegg et al., 2015,
    Wu et al., 2021). In order to represent crop water deficit degree more accurately,
    the effects of weather changes as well as plant hysteresis dynamics after re-watering
    resulting from drought stress should therefore be taken into account. Parameterization
    (Eq. (6)) revealed that the largest increased rate of Ct, equivalent to the highest
    λt, was situated at Ht = 0.71 (Fig. 3), corresponding to the flowering-filling
    stage of winter wheat. Such indication that the flowering-filling stage is the
    most sensitive period of winter wheat to water stress is consistent with many
    other reported results (Li, 1990, Zhang and Oweis, 1999). The root-weighted soil
    water availability based PWDI (used to represent real-time crop water deficit
    extent) combined with the daily sensitivity index generated from cumulative function
    (used to describe crop water sensitivity dynamics during crop growing season)
    established a novel CWPF providing a reasonable and reliable prediction for winter
    wheat yield under various levels of water supply (Fig. 4). In order to further
    verify the reliability of the proposed CWPF construction method under different
    conditions, we utilized data from a two-year field drip irrigation experiment
    conducted in Inner Mongolia, China published in Shi et al. (2020), to parameterize
    the CWPF for spring maize grown in a sandy soil. Eight treatments with various
    water supply levels were evaluated in the experiment. Different from the linear
    form demonstrated in Eq. (4), a nonlinear soil water stress response function
    was necessary to estimate the PWDI for each treatment in the Shi et al. (2020)
    experiment. Based on the parameterized CWPF with k = 1.47, b = 5.90 and m = 0.68
    for Eq. (6), the spring maize yields were estimated under various water supply
    treatments and compared with the measured values (Fig. 4). The results showed
    good agreement between measured and estimated actual maize yield (Fig. 4) with
    a R2 of 0.61, NSE of 0.57, and normalized RMSE of 0.11. The success of the method
    for both winter wheat and spring maize, representing crops with different water
    stress response characteristics (linear and non-linear) under different environments
    (soil type, climate zone and irrigation method) raises our confidence in the reliability
    and applicability of the proposed method of CWPF construction to accurately evaluate
    crop yields generally. 4.2. Irrigation scheduling using optimized constant and
    variable PWDI thresholds One potentially important use of the established CWPF
    is to determine optimal irrigation timing using PWDI thresholds to trigger irrigation
    events (Osroosh et al., 2015, Shi et al., 2020). When the PWDI threshold was kept
    constant throughout the growing season, the incremental PWDI threshold generally
    resulted in a smaller number of simulated irrigation events (and less total irrigation
    depth), as a function of prolonged duration between two successive irrigation
    events (Fig. 6a). For a fixed irrigation event, the positive relationship between
    total irrigation depth and PWDI threshold (Fig. 6a) can be explained by higher
    PWDI thresholds resulting in greater soil water deficit in the root zone prior
    to irrigation, and that more irrigation water was required to achieve the target
    water content (viz. field water capacity, Eq. (16)). Besides irrigation scheduling,
    crop yield and WUE are also influenced by many other factors such as weather,
    crop variety, and field management. Normalizing the yield and WUE by their respective
    maximum values may be helpful to avoid the impact from other factors to a certain
    extent and reasonably evaluate the effects of irrigation (Zheng et al., 2012,
    Shi et al., 2021). The increasing trend of relative irrigation water use efficiency
    (IWUEr) at the first stage when the threshold ≤ 0.90 (Fig. 6b) was likely due
    to the faster declining rate of total irrigation depth (Fig. 6a) relative to yield
    (Fig. 6b). At the later stage when threshold > 0.90, the rapidly declining IWUEr
    resulted conversely from the sharply dropping crop yield due to severe water deficit
    (Fig. 6b). In each cycle with fixed irrigation events, IWUEr decreased slowly
    with increasing PWDI threshold values (Fig. 6b), as a result of the incremental
    increase in total irrigation depth (Fig. 6a) but declining crop yield (Fig. 6b)
    according to Eq. (17). The main shortcoming of scheduling irrigation with a constant
    PWDI threshold is that the sensitivity of crop yield to water deficit is assumed
    to be constant throughout the growing season. Thus, the effect of the difference
    in water sensitivity of different growth stages on the optimization of PWDI threshold
    is ignored (Shi et al., 2020, Shi et al., 2021). The procedure based on GA overcame
    this shortcoming by globally optimizing the variable PWDI threshold combinations
    for triggering irrigation events. The optimization results showed that the prime
    timing for variable irrigation events occurred during the period between jointing
    and filling stages of winter wheat, especially in flowering-filling stage (Table
    5), which should be critical to yield formation of the crop (Li, 1990, Zhang et
    al., 1999). In other words, sufficient water supply during this stage is essential
    for maximizing crop yield irrespective of the number of irrigation events during
    the complete growing season. Relative to the constant threshold, there was obvious
    superiority of regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) triggered with a variable threshold
    in improving both Yr and IWUEr (Table 5). This suggests that full consideration
    of water demand characteristics of crops at different growth stages, and thus
    reasonable allocation of irrigation water is desired and possible (Foster and
    Brozovi, 2018; Shi et al., 2021). However, these conclusions may be biased due
    to being based on numerical simulation results obtained only from a controllable
    field lysimetric experiment for winter wheat during a specific growing season
    when natural rainfall was prevented by a movable rain-shelter. 4.3. Effects of
    climate change The effects of climate change on optimized variable PWDI threshold
    combinations and maximum relative yield of winter wheat (Yr, max) were investigated
    based on historic meteorological data. The positive correlation between the optimized
    Yr, max of winter wheat and Pr in the 38 growth seasons (Fig. 7) indicated that
    natural precipitation has a significant impact on the potential yield of winter
    wheat. The gradually waning increasing rate of Yr, max from one to four irrigation
    events (Fig. 7) demonstrated a significant diminishing return for irrigation (Foster
    and Brozovi, 2018; Li et al., 2018, Li et al., 2018). Whether for 2, 3 or 4 irrigation
    events, the highest mean PWDIopt (optimal plant water deficit index threshold)
    was always found under the 1st irrigation (Fig. 8b–j), mainly because the 1st
    irrigation was basically conducted during the period from erecting to jointing
    stage (with Ht of about 0.35–0.45) of winter wheat when its sensitivity to water
    was relatively low (Fig. 3). Therefore, continuous water consumption by evapotranspiration
    would inevitably lead to significant reduction of root-zone SWC and in further
    increase of PWDI. During the later period, from jointing to filling stages (with
    Ht = 0.45–0.75), the significantly enhanced crop water sensitivity (Fig. 3) resulted
    in relatively more sufficient water supply and thus lower mean PWDIopt between
    0.12 and 0.33 for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th irrigation (Figs. 8c, 8e-8f, 8h-8j). The
    values of MN and CV (Table 6) represent the statistical characteristics of PWDIopt
    under three typical types of hydrological year. For a fixed combination of irrigation
    sequence (1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th) and number of irrigation events (1−4), most MNs
    were observed to decrease with decreasing P (i.e. from dry to normal and then
    to wet years), except for the very few cases with higher irrigation sequence and
    number of irrigation events (e.g. the 3rd and 4th irrigation under four irrigation
    events), which were likely affected by local uncertainty of meteorological factors
    (e.g. precipitation, air temperature, solar radiation, etc.) among and within
    different types of hydrological years. The variability of PWDIopt for different
    combinations of irrigation sequence and events under the same kind of hydrological
    year likely originated from the uncertainty or stochasticity of hydrological elements
    such as precipitation and evapotranspiration, the important driving factors of
    soil water dynamics and PWDI estimation. Because of the inherent huge uncertainty
    of the climate, the variability represented by CV < 0.39 is generally considered
    to be small (Kassie et al., 2014). Therefore, it should be reasonable to ignore
    the differences of PWDIopt among various growth seasons under the same type of
    hydrological year, and apply the calculated MN to support local irrigation decisions
    and meet agricultural water management requirements. To examine the applicability
    of the MN listed in Table 6, all 30 values of MN for different irrigation sequence
    and number of irrigation events were used to replace the originally optimized
    variable PWDI threshold combinations (Fig. 8) of the 38 growth seasons from 1981
    to 2018 according to their classification of hydrological year. Thereafter, they
    were applied to trigger irrigation during the simulation of soil water flow and
    estimate the relative yield (Yr, est) of winter wheat using the integrated optimization
    procedure via the coupling of the Richards equation, CWPF and GA. The values of
    Yr, est from one, two, three or four irrigation events in the 38 years were compared
    with corresponding maximum relative crop yields Yr, max (Fig. 7, optimized using
    the original variable PWDI threshold combinations) in Fig. 9, in which the percentages
    (80%, 90%, 95% or 100%) represent the ratio of Yr, est to Yr, max. The results
    show that all Yr, est estimated based on the MN were above the level of 80% Yr,
    max, and the percentage of Yr, est exceeding 90% (95%) of Yr, max reached up to
    91% (85%). The degree of closeness of Yr, est to Yr, max increased significantly
    with increasing number of irrigation events. For example, the proportion of Yr,
    est exceeding 95% of Yr, max was 69%, 81%, 96% and 98% for one, two, three, and
    four events, respectively. Obviously, MN-based Yr, est was comparable with Yr,
    max in most cases, especially when three or four irrigation events were applied,
    which exactly reflects common practice in agricultural water management in the
    North China Plain (Yang et al., 2014). Therefore, the values of MN in Table 6
    can be recommended as variable PWDI threshold combinations to schedule RDI as
    a function of number of irrigation events and type of hydrological year, which
    should be helpful for maximizing water use efficiency, particularly when water
    supply is limited and deficit irrigation strategies are necessary. However, it
    should be noted that the optimized MN might be very different from its theoretical
    or true threshold as a result of the possibly dramatic variation of intra and
    inter annual meteorological conditions in practice, especially under actual field
    conditions. Further practical research is needed to introduce uncertainty estimation
    methods such as stochastic, fuzzy and interval mathematical programming into the
    optimization procedure to more rationally reflect the impact of climate change
    and the complexity of irrigation systems (Li et al., 2018, Li et al., 2018). Download

    of the relative yield (Yr, est) estimated based on combinations of the mean of
    originally optimized plant water deficit index (PWDI) thresholds and the maximum
    relative yield (Yr, max) directly estimated with combinations of the originally
    optimized PWDI thresholds. The percentage (80, 90, 95, 100%) represents the ratio
    of Yr, est and Yr, max. 5. Conclusions A novel crop-water production function
    (CWPF) was proposed by combining root-weighed soil water availability based PWDI
    with daily water sensitivity index derived from a sigmoidal cumulative function.
    Whether parameterized using data from a winter wheat field lysimetric experiment
    conducted in the North China Plain or a spring maize field drip irrigation experiment
    in Inner Mongolia, China, the CWPF reasonably estimated crop yields under various
    deficit irrigation treatments, with the R2 not less than 0.61, NSE not less than
    0.57 and normalized RMSE not more than 0.11 between the measured and estimated
    values. By coupling the genetic algorithm with the verified integrated simulations
    of soil water dynamics, PWDI and CWPF, an optimization procedure was developed
    to determine a PWDI threshold combination for winter wheat, whether constant or
    variable, and to investigate the effects of climate change on optimized variable
    PWDI threshold combinations based on 38 years of local historic meteorological
    data. Relative to the constant threshold, RDI initiated with a variable threshold
    resulted in a significant increase of 9–38% in crop yield and 31–68% in IWUE due
    to the consideration of relative sensitivity of crop yield to water deficit at
    different growth stages. Regardless of how many times winter wheat was irrigated
    after the greening stage, the variability of optimized PWDI thresholds among various
    growth seasons under the same kind of hydrological year (wet, normal or dry) was
    not very large (CV < 0.39) and might be negligible in many practical cases. When
    the mean values of optimized PWDI thresholds for different irrigation sequence
    and number of irrigation events were used to schedule RDI of winter wheat under
    the same kind of hydrological year, up to 91% of the estimated relative yields
    exceeded 90% of their corresponding maximums, with the closeness degree between
    them increased with increasing number of irrigation events. The mean values appear
    to be a valid technique for optimizing irrigation management of winter wheat in
    the North China Plain. However, further actual field studies regarding rational
    quantitative description on the uncertainty of meteorological conditions due to
    climate change and its impacts on PWDI threshold optimization are necessary. Declaration

    More than 90% consumption of groundwater resources in the agricultural sector
    is the main reason for the recent droughts in arid and semi-arid areas including
    Iran. In these areas, along with effect of climatic factors, excessive abstraction
    from groundwater has caused excessive groundwater abnormality leading to land
    subsidence in some regions. By improving water use efficiency for irrigated agriculture,
    groundwater abstraction will be reduced and will ultimately lead to drought control
    and sustainable use of water resources in areas like Iran. The performance indicator
    water productivity (WP) is a critical response to sustainability in the case of
    irrigated agriculture and water usage. Increasing WP, which offers a quantifiable
    benchmark to assess crop production relative to available water resources, maybe
    the best way to achieve efficient water use (Rodrigues & Pereira, 2009; Cetin
    & Kara, 2019; Mohtashami et al., 2020). The management of irrigation water used
    to produce a certain amount of agricultural production should be improved. Thus,
    crop WP is an important index to evaluate water saving and obtain a higher value
    for each drop of water used (Kijne et al., 2003; Amarasinghe et al., 2004; Kang
    et al., 2009; Cetin & Uzen, 2016). Rodrigues & Pereira (2009) considered the feasibility
    of deficit irrigation of maize, wheat, and sunflower through an analysis of WP
    in Vigia Irrigation District, Southern Portugal. Results show that the main bottleneck
    for adopting deficit irrigation is the presently low performance of the irrigation
    systems in the considered fields, which leads to high water use and low WP. Ahmadzadeh
    et al. (2016) applied the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model in the Zarrineh
    Rud River (the main feeding river of northwest Iran''s Lake Urmia) to simulate
    different irrigation systems considering real irrigation management variables
    such as depth and date of each irrigation event. Results show that changing the
    current irrigation to a pressurized system could increase WP by up to 15% due
    to increases in crop yield, better water distribution, and greater actual evapotranspiration
    (ET). Paredes et al. (2016) employed the combined models of the SIMDualKc soil
    water balance model and Stewart''s water-yield model to assess the impacts of
    alternative sowing dates and irrigation schedules on malting barley (Hordeum vulgare
    L. cv. Publican) yields. They concluded that in terms of water use, sowing by
    mid-November is advantageous since more rainfall is generally available, and rainfed
    barley is not economically feasible in dry years in the study area. Zou et al.
    (2020) optimized the drip irrigation and fertilization regimes for high grain
    yield, crop WP, and economic benefits of spring maize in Northwest China. In their
    research, the overall benefits of maize yield, crop WP, and net returns were maximized
    with an irrigation amount of 109% crop evapotranspiration (ETc) (474 mm) and medium-high
    fertilizer (N-P2O5-K2O) amount of 184-92-92 kg ha−1. Various irrigation scenarios
    can be applied through deficit irrigation, considering different growth stages
    in the growing season. These scenarios affect ET and yields but get a positive
    return from the irrigated crop (English & Raja, 1996; Kang, Shi, & Zhang, 2000;
    Popova & Pereira, 2008; Panigrahi et al., 2013; Darouich et al., 2014). There
    is a great need for farmers to shift their thinking from maximizing crop production
    through excessive water use to optimizing crop production with minimum irrigation
    supplies, deficit irrigation, and water harvesting (Baghaei, Kahtoonabadi, & Mousavi,
    2013). A very important parameter for the application of deficit irrigation is
    the sensitivity of different crop growth stages to water deficit. For proper management
    of water resources in irrigation districts, sensitive stages of crop growth should
    be fully irrigated or limited deficit irrigation should be applied at these stages
    as far as possible (Moghimi & Sepaskhah, 2014a). In this research, the impact
    of various on-farm water management parameters (or scenarios) on different performance
    indicators was investigated, and the optimum values of these measures related
    to dominant crops of cropping patterns were determined. 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS
    2.1 Study area and selection of different hydrological years This study was conducted
    at Gharahbolagh District in Fasa City (longitude 53.41° N, latitude 28.58° E,
    and 1,288 m above mean sea level), with an area of approximately 34,000 ha located
    in the southeast of Fars Province in the southwest of Iran. A summary of the average
    annual meteorological data of this district for different hydrological years is
    presented in Table 1. The hydrological year that was selected in this study starts
    in October and finishes in September of the next year. Winter wheat, barley, rapeseed,
    maize, and cotton are dominant in the cropping pattern of the study region, and
    the dominant soil texture in this region is clay loam. Periods of growth stages
    of the studied crops are presented in Table 2. The analyses were done in three
    hydrological years (wet, normal, and dry) that were selected among 50 hydrological
    years of available meteorological data (1969/1970 to 2018/2019). To select these
    years, the annual reconnaissance drought index (RDI) (Tsakiris & Vangelis, 2005)
    was used. The year with the maximum value of RDI (RDI > 1) was selected as the
    wet hydrological year, and the year with the minimum value of RDI (RDI < −1) was
    selected as the dry hydrological year. For selecting the normal hydrological year,
    hydrological years with a value of RDI between 0.99 and −0.99 were considered,
    and the hydrological year in which the annual precipitation was closer to the
    average annual of the study region was selected as the normal hydrological year.

    10 July 11–Sep. 3 Sep. 4–Oct. 23 2.2 Irrigation scheduling To calculate the quantity
    of irrigation requirement, the potential ETc was initially calculated daily using
    the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) dual crop coefficient method (Allen
    et al., 1998) as follows: (1) where ET0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration
    (mm d−1), Kcb is the basal crop coefficient, and Ke is the soil evaporation coefficient.
    For irrigation scheduling, soil water balance was modelled via relations presented
    in the FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper No. 56 (Allen et al., 1998). Irrigation
    schedules were conducted through full and deficit irrigation. For full irrigation
    scheduling, the quantity of net irrigation requirement (irrigation application
    efficiency [Ea] of 100%) was equal to ETc. The irrigation intervals depend on
    when the soil readily available water was depleted. 2.2.1 Deficit irrigation scheduling
    methods According to various stages of growth for different crops studied in this
    research, deficit irrigation scheduling (DIS) was applied via four methods for
    winter wheat and five methods for barley, rapeseed, maize, and cotton. In these
    methods, different levels of water consumption reduction were applied (20%, 40%,
    60%, and 80%). The DIS methods are described as follows: Method 1: For winter
    crops, the quantity of each spring season irrigation event was reduced by multiplying
    to 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, and 0.2 (relative applied water). For summer crops, the quantity
    of each irrigation event after the vegetative stage for maize and after the middle
    of the seedling stage for cotton was reduced by multiplying to relative applied
    water. Method 2: In this method, full irrigation was applied but not throughout
    the season. For winter crops, the number of spring season irrigation events was
    reduced by multiplying the total number of irrigation events to relative applied
    water. For summer crops, the number of irrigation events after the vegetative
    stage for maize and after the middle of the seedling stage for cotton was reduced
    by multiplying the total number of irrigation events to relative applied water.
    Methods 3–5 were a combination of full and deficit irrigation so that in some
    growing stages full irrigation and in others deficit irrigation was applied according
    to method 1 (these methods are presented in Table 3 for all crops). TABLE 3. Values

    methods of DIS were applied via the three irrigation systems of surface (Ea = 30%–60%),
    solid-set sprinkler (Ea = 50%–80%), and tape (Ea = 70%–90%) irrigation. 2.3 On-farm
    water management performance indicators Farm irrigation water productivity (WPI-Farm)
    and net income (NI) were deployed as on-farm water management performance indicators
    as presented in Equations 2 and 3 (Rodrigues & Pereira, 2009): (2) and (3) where
    Ya is the grain yield (actual yield) in kg, IWU is the irrigation water consumption
    regardless of precipitation in m3, GI is the gross income in Rls (1 rial is 2.38 × 10−5
    US$), and PC is the production cost in Rls. These equations resulted in calculating
    WPI-Farm in kg m−3 and NI in Rls. 2.3.1 Yield estimation Despite the availability
    of numerous generic crop models for Ya estimation, due to lack of data in the
    present study (especially for calibration and validation of these models), Equation
    5 (Rao, Sarma, & Chander, 1988; Meyer, Hubbard, & Wilhite, 1993) was applied for
    estimating Ya for winter wheat and barley and Equation 6 (Jensen, 1968) for rapeseed,
    maize, and cotton: (5) and (6) where Ya is the actual crop yield in kg, Ym is
    the potential crop yield in kg, ETai and ETpi are actual and potential evapotranspiration,
    respectively, is the yield response factor at stage i, and λi is the sensitivity
    index of stage i to water deficit in the crop growing season. Determination of
    ETa, however, requires further calculations through the soil water balance. For
    this purpose, Nairizi and Rydzewski (1977) and Meyer, Hubbard, & Wilhite (1993)
    developed an approximation of Equations 5 and 6 by substitution of ETa/ETp with
    the ratio of applied water to potential water need, Wa/Wp (Ghahraman & Sepaskhah,
    2004): (7) and (8) where Wai is the actual water used at stage i in mm and Wpi
    is the potential water requirement at stage i in mm. In this study, for better
    application of different quantities of irrigation water in different irrigation
    scenarios, Equations (7) and (8) were commissioned to estimate Ya. In this research,
    values presented by Ghahraman & Sepaskhah (2004) were used for winter wheat and
    barley. The λi values presented by Shaabani et al. (2009), Moghimi & Sepaskhah
    (2014b), and Ghahraman & Sepaskhah (1997) were used for rapeseed, maize, and cotton,
    respectively. The values of and λi for different crops at different stages are
    given in Table 4. TABLE 4. Values of crop sensitivity index to water deficit at
    different stages (λi or Kyi), crop evapotranspiration (ETc), and seasonal precipitation

    evaporation coefficient Ke presented in Shahrokhnia & Sepaskhah (2013), Shaabani
    et al. (2009), and Allen et al. (1998) were used for calculation of ETc. Potential
    yield estimation The agro-ecological zone (AEZ) method proposed by Doorenbos &
    Kassam (1979) was used for estimating potential yield (Rodrigues & Pereira, 2009).
    In this method, all of the parameters that affect the potential yield were considered.
    Using the best yields achieved in the region, the results of this method were
    validated. Actual data have been recorded from the area by field surveying. 2.3.2
    Gross income In Equation 3, GI is the value of Ya and was calculated using the
    data achieved from the Agricultural Organization of Fars Province (Iran) for different
    irrigation systems per unit area (hectare). According to this information, the
    prices of winter wheat, rapeseed, barley, maize, and cotton were 12,705, 25,300,
    10,028, 11,094, and 31,964 Rls kg−1, respectively. 2.3.3 Production cost Production
    cost was determined by using Equation 9 as follows: (9) where C is the total production
    cost in Rls ha−1. Cultivation operation cost, irrigation system equipment and
    designing costs, and land rent were used in calculating fixed costs and labour;
    yield transportation and applied water costs were used in calculating variable
    costs. The winter crop fixed costs of production on the farm, were 15.6 × 106
    for the surface, 14.5 × 106 for solid-set sprinkler, and 28.0 × 106 Rls for the
    microirrigation system. For maize, these costs were 15.6 × 106, 15.5 × 106, and
    19.0 × 106 Rls for surface, solid-set sprinkler, and microirrigation systems,
    respectively. For cotton, these costs were 15.6 × 106 and 23.0 × 106 Rls for the
    surface and microirrigation systems, respectively. According to local information,
    the labour costs were considered equal to one-seventh of GI (almost 14.3% of GI),
    and the yield transportation cost was 120 Rls kg−1. Water cost In the study region,
    the only source of water supply is groundwater, with farmers paying only the cost
    of groundwater extraction, and the water is free. Water cost calculation included
    fixed and variable costs. The investment costs were used to calculate fixed costs,
    and the operation, maintenance, and management costs were used to calculate variable
    cost. Water cost was calculated per unit of total water consumed in Rls m−3. Investment
    costs include the cost of well drilling, purchase and installation of a pump engine,
    and power supply. Variable costs include energy costs (electricity or fuel), which
    are relevant in some countries, especially in groundwater areas, and have an important
    influence on production costs. In Iran, the influence of variable costs compared
    to fixed costs is not significant. 2.4 Statistical analysis and optimization In
    this study, the aims of statistical analysis were divided into three parts: The
    first part discusses the modelling of the response variables Y1 and Y2, based
    on the continuous variables X1 and X2, and the categorical variables C1 and C2.
    The second part investigates the ranking of the importance of the predictors on
    response variables. The final part considers the optimization of the response
    variables based on predictors. Among different statistical and mathematical methods,
    the response surface methodology (RSM) is an efficient technique that can simultaneously
    cover these three parts. This methodology is a set of statistical techniques and
    mathematical tools, which can be used for modelling and optimizing processes (Khayet,
    Cojocarub, & Zakrzewska-Trznadelc, 2008). In this study, to model and optimize
    a set of response variables based on some predictors, the RSM based on the central
    composite design (CCD) was carried out. In this study, the responses were the
    performance indicators WPI-Farm and NI, where the factors Ea and water reduction
    fraction (WRF) were the continuous ones, and the factors “irrigation system” and
    “method of DIS” were the categorical ones. The optimum value of the response variable
    is the average fitted value of this variable using the RSM model over the optimum
    values of continuous factors (predictors). This model was run separately for each
    hydrological year (wet, normal, and dry). The general form of the response surface
    model is presented in Equation 10. (10) where y is the responses, and are the
    continuous factors (predictors), is a constant coefficient (intercept), and are
    the coefficients of linear effects, and are the quadratic effect regression coefficients,
    is the interaction effect regression coefficient, and ε is the statistical error.
    The reason for not using the linear relationship was to include the interaction
    effects of the continuous factors and their second-order effects. 3 RESULTS AND
    DISCUSSION The years 1978/1979, 1987/1988, and 1999/2000 with RDI values of 1.41,
    0.12, and −1.68 were selected as wet, normal, and dry hydrological years, respectively.
    For different crops, the estimated values of ETc and seasonal precipitation in
    wet, normal, and dry hydrological years are presented in Table 4. Required irrigation
    water was determined via the FAO 56 method (Allen et al., 1998). The amount of
    rainfall during the growing season directly affects the required irrigation water
    for winter crops. The depths of net irrigation requirement in the normal hydrological
    year for winter wheat, rapeseed, barley, maize, and cotton were 839, 764, 715,
    1,235, and 1851 mm. However, these values for the wet hydrological year decreased
    and increased for the dry hydrological year. The Ya for all of the crops in different
    hydrological years (wet, normal, and dry), different values of WRF, and methods
    of DIS were calculated by using Equation 7 and 8. The potential grain yields of
    these crops for the different experimental hydrological years were calculated
    by the AEZ method (Ym). In the normal hydrological year, Ym values for winter
    wheat, rapeseed, barley, maize, and cotton were 8,021, 5,960, 5,810, 9,949, and
    3,904 kg ha−1, respectively. 3.1 Effect of on-farm water management factors The
    performance indicators (WPI-Farm and NI) of cultivation pattern crops were calculated
    for different values of WRF and Ea and different DIS methods. These calculations
    were performed for different hydrological years. The effect of the predictors
    WRF and Ea on different performance indicators in different deficit irrigation
    scenarios, irrigation systems, and hydrological years was evaluated by RSM based
    on the CCD. The significant correlation coefficients (p value <.05) of the regression
    equation related to this methodology (between predictors and measured responses)
    (Equation 10) for the NI is presented in Table 5 and for WP in Table 10 (these
    results are presented only for a normal hydrological year and microirrigation
    system, and details of other scenarios are not shown to save space). TABLE 5.

    not shown in the table were not significant in the regression equation (p value
    >.05). 3.1.1 Net income Coefficients of the response surface model (Equation 10)
    related to NI were obtained for different hydrological years and irrigation systems,
    but only the results of the normal hydrological year for the microirrigation system
    are presented in Table 5 to save space. According to the results, the linear effect
    of Ea and WRF on the NI were significant for all winter (winter wheat, rapeseed,
    and barley) and summer crops (maize and cotton), except the Ea for barley and
    maize. The greater effect of WRF on NI has made the effect of Ea on NI nonsignificant,
    which originates from the collinearity effect. The mentioned linear effect was
    positive in all of the significant cases, except for WRF in barley (normal and
    dry hydrological year, sprinkler and microirrigation systems, method 1 of DIS)
    and maize (wet hydrological year, microirrigation system, method 1 of DIS). The
    negative effect for barley and maize was because of the minimum grain yield of
    these crops under method 1 of DIS. Positive and negative effect means that larger
    WRF or Ea resulted in greater and smaller NI, respectively. The linear effect
    of WRF was greater than Ea in all of the cases. Comparing methods of DIS, method
    2 for winter wheat, method 4 for rapeseed, barley, and maize, and method 3 for
    cotton resulted in maximum values of linear effect coefficients. This was because
    of satisfying water requirement of crops in sensitive stages of growth to water
    deficit in these methods. The minimum values of linear effect coefficients were
    obtained in method 1 for all of the cases because, in this method, the complete
    water requirement in the sensitive stage of growth was not met. The quadratic
    effects of these parameters (Ea and WRF) on NI were significant in all of the
    cases, except the Ea parameter for winter wheat (normal hydrological year), rapeseed
    (wet and normal hydrological year), barley (normal and dry hydrological year),
    and maize (every three hydrological years). As the results show, the number of
    cases in which the quadratic effect of Ea on NI was not significant was greater
    than the number of nonsignificant cases of the linear effect of Ea. This was due
    to the lower effect of Ea than WRF, which was more pronounced in quadratic mode.
    Also, the interaction effect of these predictors on NI was significant in all
    of the cases except for barley (normal and dry hydrological year) and maize (wet
    and dry hydrological year) due to the nonsignificance of the effect of Ea on NI
    for barley and maize. In all of the significant cases, the quadratic and interaction
    effects were negative. Considering the overall effect of each predictor of Ea
    and WRF, the quadratic equation containing these factors was plotted separately
    (i.e., b1x1 + b3x12 for Ea and b2x2 + b4x22 for WRF). Given the quadratic equation
    containing Ea and taking into account the effect of WRF, the effect of Ea on NI
    was additive in all of the significant cases, except for method 1 of DIS for winter
    wheat (wet and dry hydrological year), rapeseed (dry hydrological year), and barley
    (wet hydrological year). In method 1 of DIS, due to applying deficit irrigation
    in all of the growth stages, including stages with high sensitivity, the changes
    related to the overall effect of Ea were first incremental (for winter wheat up
    to Ea = 0.59 for wet and 0.69 for the dry hydrological year; for rapeseed up to
    Ea = 0.81, and up to Ea = 0.65 for barley) and then decreasing. Given the quadratic
    equation containing WRF, taking into account the effect of Ea in all of the methods
    of DIS, the changes related to this impact were increasing at the beginning and
    then decreasing. Accordingly, the values of the equation b2x2 + b4x22 will have
    the highest value in some factor of WRF as these WRF values are presented in Table
    6 for different crops, hydrological years, irrigation systems, and methods of
    DIS. For winter wheat, in the wet hydrological year, method 2 and in the normal
    and dry hydrological year, method 3; for rapeseed, method 4; for barley, method
    4; for maize, in wet, normal, and dry hydrological years, methods 3 and 4, respectively;
    and for cotton, in wet and normal hydrological years, method 3 and in the dry
    hydrological year, method 2 and 3 had the maximum values of WRF. According to
    the results, higher values of WRF were obtained in methods of DIS as in these
    methods, the plant''s water requirement has been fully met at stages of growth
    with higher sensitivity to water deficit. TABLE 6. Maximum values of WRF in overall

    of the response surface model (Equation 10) related to WP were obtained for different
    hydrological years and irrigation systems, but only the results of the normal
    hydrological year for the microirrigation system are presented in Table 7 to save
    space. The results show that the linear effect of Ea and WRF on WPI-Farm was significant
    for all winter and summer crops, except for rapeseed for WRF in a normal hydrological
    year, barley for WRF in wet and normal hydrological years, and maize for WRF in
    normal and dry hydrological years. In contrast to the NI, here the linear effect
    of Ea was greater than that of the WRF in all of the cases as the greater effect
    of Ea on WP resulted in the nonsignificant effect of WRF on WP, which originates
    from the collinearity effect. The mentioned linear effect was positive in all
    of the significant cases except WRF for cotton (normal and dry hydrological year,
    methods 3 and 4 of DIS). This negative effect was because of the minimum grain
    yield of cotton under methods 3 and 4 of DIS. Comparing methods of DIS, method
    2 for winter wheat, rapeseed, barley, and cotton, and method 4 for maize, resulted
    in maximum values of linear effect coefficients for both Ea and WRF. The minimum
    values of linear effect coefficients, for Ea, were obtained in methods 1, 4, 1,
    1, and 4 for winter wheat, rapeseed, barley, maize, and cotton, respectively,

    in the regression equation is kg m−3. b The coefficients not shown in the table
    were not significant in the regression equation (p value >.05). The quadratic
    effects of the predictor parameters (Ea and WRF) on WPI-Farm were significant
    in all of the cases except the WRF parameter for rapeseed (normal hydrological
    year), barley (wet and normal hydrological year), and maize (normal and dry hydrological
    years) and the Ea parameter for barley (normal hydrological year), maize (normal
    and dry hydrological years), and cotton (every three hydrological years). These
    results show that these two parameters have less effect on WP in these plants
    than other plants as these effects were greater for maize and barley. Also, the
    interaction effect of these predictors on WPI-Farm was significant in all of the
    cases except for rapeseed (normal hydrological year), barley (normal and dry hydrological
    year), maize (normal and dry hydrological year), and cotton (every three hydrological
    years). This was due to the lower effect of these parameters on WP in these plants
    than other plants. In all of the significant cases, the quadratic and interaction
    effects were negative. Considering the overall effect of each predictor of Ea
    and WRF, the quadratic equation containing these factors was plotted separately
    (i.e., b1x1 + b3x12 for Ea and b2x2 + b4x22 for WRF). Given the quadratic equation
    containing Ea and taking into account the effect of WRF, the effect of Ea on WPI-Farm
    was additive in all of the significant cases. Given the quadratic equation containing
    WRF and taking into account the effect of Ea in all of the methods of DIS, the
    changes related to this impact were either incremental or incremental and then
    subtractive. This was due to the lower effect of WRF on WP than Ea. Accordingly,
    the values of the equation b2x2 + b4x22 will have the highest value in some factor
    of WRF as these WRF values are presented in Table 8 for different crops, hydrological
    years, irrigation systems, and methods of DIS. For winter wheat, method 2; for
    rapeseed, methods 1 and 2; for barley, method 2; for maize, methods 2 and 4; and
    for cotton, in the wet hydrological year, method 1 and in normal and dry hydrological
    years, method 2 had the maximum values of WRF. The higher values of WRF were achieved
    in the methods of DIS as in these methods, at stages of growth with higher sensitivity
    to water deficit, the plant''s water requirement has been fully met. TABLE 8.

    of different variables on performance indicators NI and WP, the factors influencing
    these measures were prioritized (Figure 1). According to the results, the most
    important predictor influencing NI was WRF, and the most important predictor influencing
    WP was Ea for all of the crops. The secondary important predictor influencing
    NI was WRF2, except for the normal hydrological year for cotton as for this crop
    the secondary important predictor was Ea. For WP, the secondary important predictor
    for winter wheat was WRF, for rapeseed and barley WRF2, for maize WRF2 in the
    wet hydrological year and “irrigation system” for normal and dry hydrological
    years, and for cotton “irrigation system” for the wet hydrological year and WRF

    show that the optimum values of NI were obtained at Ea = 90% and sprinkler irrigation
    system (except for surface irrigation system for cotton). In most cases, method
    2 of DIS was the best to get the optimum value of NI. The maximum value of the

    year), for barley 0.06 (in normal and dry hydrological years), for maize 0.32
    (in dry hydrological years), and for cotton 0.13 (in the dry hydrological year).
    These maximum values of WRF were obtained in methods of DIS where the sensitive

    a The unit of net income in the regression equation is million Rls (rials). The
    optimum values of WP were obtained at Ea = 90% and in method 2 of DIS. The maximum
    value of the WRF factor to gain the optimum value of WP, for winter wheat, was
    0.6 (in the normal hydrological year), for rapeseed 0.47 (in the wet hydrological
    year), for barley 0.31 (in dry hydrological years), for maize 0.41 (in the wet
    hydrological year), and for cotton 0.62 (in normal and dry hydrological years).
    These results indicate that the higher values of WRF were permissible to achieve
    greater WP than NI. When considering multiple response prediction for simultaneous
    optimization of NI and WP, the factors of Ea = 90%, method 2 of DIS and sprinkler
    irrigation system (except for microirrigation system for maize in a normal hydrological
    year and surface irrigation system for cotton) resulted in optimum values of performance
    indicators (NI and WP). The maximum value of the WRF factor to gain the optimum
    value of WP and NI in simultaneous optimization of NI and WP, for winter wheat,
    was 0.33 (in the normal hydrological year), for rapeseed 0.29 (in the wet hydrological
    year), for barley 0.19 (in dry hydrological years), for maize 0.31 (in the wet
    hydrological year), and for cotton 0.48 (in dry hydrological years). The counterplot
    of NI and WPI-Farm versus predictor factors (Ea and WRF) for optimal conditions
    (presented in Tables 9 and 10) are presented in Figures 2, 3, and 4, respectively.
    These counterplots were plotted in terms of irrigation system and method of deficit
    irrigation in different hydrological years. As seen, the higher values of NI were
    obtained with higher values of Ea and lower values of WRF, and the higher values
    of WP were obtained with higher values of Ea and WRF. FIGURE 2 Open in figure

    4 CONCLUSIONS This research investigates the effect of WRF and Ea variables (predictors)
    on different performance indicators (WPI-Farm and NI) in different deficit irrigation
    scenarios, irrigation systems, and hydrological years using RSM based on the CCD.
    According to the results, the linear effects of Ea and WRF on NI and WPI-Farm
    were positive, and the quadratic and interaction effects were negative for all
    winter and summer crops in all of the significant cases. For NI, the linear effect
    of WRF was greater than Ea, and for WPI-Farm, the linear effect of Ea was greater
    than WRF in all of the cases. Considering the overall effect of predictor factors
    (Ea and WRF) on NI, the effect of these factors was additive and then decreasing
    in all of the significant cases, and considering the overall effect of these factors
    on WP, the effect of Ea on WPI-Farm was additive, and the effect of WRF on WPI-Farm
    was either incremental or incremental and then subtractive. The higher values
    of WRF were obtained in methods of DIS as in these methods, the plant''s water
    requirement at more sensitive stages of growth to water deficit has been fully
    met. According to the Pareto charts of the standardized effect results, the most
    important predictor influencing NI was WRF, and the most important predictor influencing
    WP was Ea for all of the crops. The optimum values of NI and WP were obtained
    at Ea = 90% and sprinkler irrigation system (except surface irrigation system
    for cotton). In most cases, method 2 of DIS was the best to get the optimum value
    of NI and WP. The maximum optimal values of NI obtained were 70.75 (WRF = 0.11),
    113.74 (WRF = 0.0), 33.1 (WRF = 0.06), 66.9 (WRF = 0.05), and 91.35 (WRF = 0.13)
    million Rls for winter wheat, rapeseed, barley, maize, and cotton, respectively.
    These values were obtained in method 2 of DIS, with the exception of winter wheat
    (method 4 of DIS). The maximum values of the WRF factor to gain the optimum value
    of NI and WP (in separate optimization) for winter wheat was 0.11 and 0.6 (in
    the normal hydrological year), for rapeseed 0.05 and 0.47 (in the wet hydrological
    year), for barley 0.06 and 0.31 (in dry hydrological years), for maize 0.32 and
    0.41 (in wet hydrological years), and for cotton 0.13 and 0.62 (in the dry hydrological
    year), respectively. In simultaneous optimization of NI and WP, these values were
    0.33, 0.29, 0.19, 0.31, and 0.48 for winter wheat, rapeseed, barley, maize, and
    cotton, respectively. Meanwhile, these values occurred in the same hydrological
    years as those obtained in separate optimization. When considering multiple response
    prediction for simultaneous optimization of NI and WP, the factors of Ea = 90%,
    method 2 of DIS and sprinkler irrigation system (except for microirrigation system
    for maize in a normal hydrological year and surface irrigation system for cotton)
    resulted in optimum values of performance indicators (NI and WP). This study has
    shown that DIS is a very useful and practical strategy for on-farm water management
    under conditions of limited water resources, especially in scenarios that consider
    the sensitivity of different crop growth stages. However, the use of the different
    DIS scenarios, irrigation systems, and WRF will result in the provision of management
    packages for on-farm water management under different conditions of water resource
    availability. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The Meteorological Organization and the Ministry

  description: '【Objective】Water scarcity is the bottleneck constraining food production
    in Xinjiang province of China, and optimizing agricultural water usage is hence
    critical to developing sustainable agriculture in this region. The purpose of
    this paper is to propose a method to optimize drip-irrigation scheduling for mulched
    maize fields.【Method】The optimization is based on the DSSAT-CERES-Maize model
    parameters; growth and yield of the maize measured under different irrigation
    levels in 2020 was used to calibrate the model. Based on meteorological data measured
    from 1979 to 2017 in the studied region, we compared 14 different irrigation schemes
    in typical years and selected the optimal irrigation schedule for maize growth
    under mulched drip irrigation.【Result】Comparison showed that the leaf area index,
    dry matter weight and the yield simulated by the model for different irrigation
    levels correctly reproduced what were measured. We found that the sensitivity
    of the maize to water stress varied with season, and based on the degree of the
    sensitivity, the growth stages can be ranked as follows in a descending order:
    tasseling period>jointing period>filling period. Considering both yield and water
    use efficiency, the optimal irrigation amount in the tasseling period should be
    80, 180 mm and 120 mm for dry, normal and wet years, respectively. The irrigation
    amount should be 120 mm in the filling stage and 60 mm for other stages. The yield
    under the optimized irrigation schedule accounted for 99.53%, 97.51% and 98.45%
    of the highest yield in dry, normal and wet years, respectively.【Conclusion】The
    CERES-Maize model is reliable. It can be used not only to optimize drip-irrigation
    schedule of maize in Xinjiang but also has an implication for optimizing irrigation
    of other crops in Xinjiang and beyond.'

  description: Optimizing irrigation strategies to increase water utilization efficiency
    and achieve higher yield is vital for balancing groundwater use and improving
    food security during water shortage in the North China Plain (NCP). Based on a
    16-year field experiment (2003–2018) using seven irrigation schedules from W0M0
    to W4M3 (numbers are irrigation times in wheat (W) and maize (M) season, 75 mm
    each) in the winter wheat–summer maize double cropping system, we analyzed annual
    total water consumption (ETa) and groundwater table change in terms of net groundwater
    depletion, annual total grain yield, water productivity (WP), irrigation water
    productivity (IWP) and marginal benefit of the whole wheat–maize system. Relationship
    between yield or WP and irrigation or ETa were also revealed. Results showed that
    (1) total ETa increased as irrigation input increased, ranging from 427.3 mm (Rainfed,
    W0M0) to 891.0 mm (W4M3). Soil water storage contributed nearly 30% to ETa for
    winter wheat under water deficit conditions. Pre-sowing soil water storage played
    an important role in improving the annual yield and WP of both wheat and maize
    by promoting germination, seedling emergence and root growth; (2) the rainfed
    treatment (W0M0) was best for mitigating the groundwater table decline (0.1 m
    yr-1), followed by W1M1 (0.5 m yr-1) and W2M1 (0.8 m yr-1). Groundwater table
    decline in M2W2 almost overlapped the observed data at the station (1.1 m yr-1).
    In W3M2, the farmers’ traditional practice, the groundwater table declined by
    1.4 m yr-1, obviously over exploitation, while W4M2 and W4M3 declined by almost
    2.0 m yr-1; (3) the relationship between total annual yield and irrigation (or
    ETa) followed a quadratic curve. Total annual yield significantly increased from
    W0M0 to M1W1 (25%) to M2M1 (5%) and then kept stable. Average annual WP decreased
    as irrigation increased, from 2.4 kg m-3 (W0M0) to 1.6 kg m-3 (W4M3). Average
    annual IWP and marginal benefit also declined as irrigation increased. These results
    over 16 years indicated that the W2M1 is the most balanced irrigation regime for
    wheat– maize rotation to mitigate groundwater decline, maintain grain production,
    and improve water use efficiency in the NCP.

    With increasing population worldwide, use of groundwater permits large and small
    scale growers to increase agricultural production and improve food security by
    overcoming rainfall limitations (Famiglietti, 2014). Groundwater provides more
    than 40% of irrigation water to produce 13% of the world’s total food (de Graaf
    et al., 2019). Groundwater over-exploitation for agricultural irrigation has received
    worldwide attention due to the rapid decline in groundwater tables and accompanying
    environmental issues (Davis et al., 2017). As the breadbasket, North China Plain
    supplies 23% of China’s grain, including 51% of its wheat and 35% of its maize
    (National Bureau of Statistics of China, 2019a). However, agriculture accounted
    for 62–70% of the region’s total water usage in the past four decades (China Water
    Resources Bulletin, 2019). Taking advantage of the abundant light and temperature
    natural resources in the NCP, the winter wheat–summer maize double cropping system
    has dominated since the 1980s, occupying 70–86% of the area’s arable land (National
    Bureau of Statistics of China, 2019b). However, this dominant cropping system
    consumes 700–1000 mm yr-1 water (Liu et al., 2001), far exceeding the annual average
    precipitation of 500–600 mm; 60–70% of the annual rainfall occurs during the summer
    maize growing season from July to September. The uneven distribution of precipitation
    results in severe water deficits in the winter wheat season, with about 70% of
    its water demand relying on the irrigation pumped from groundwater (Yang et al.,
    2015a, Yang et al., 2015b). The 100–300 mm of irrigation water required for winter
    wheat has resulted in the groundwater table declining by almost 1 m yr-1 during
    the past forty years (Kong et al., 2016). The North China Plain has become one
    of the deepest groundwater cones of depression on the planet, even surpassing
    India and the US High Plains (Pei et al., 2015). Moreover, the unwise irrigation
    scheduling, such as heavy rainfall coming after the irrigation, could cause unintended
    deep percolation, resulting in water resource waste and groundwater pollution
    (Wang et al., 2014). Therefore, it is vital to adopt water-saving irrigation modifications
    to achieve the largest possible increase in agricultural water use efficiency
    in this groundwater over-exploitation area (Sun et al., 2015). Previous studies
    have mainly focused on tactics to reduce the irrigation amount and improve water
    use efficiency (WUE) for a single crop, especially for winter wheat, covering
    variety update (Zhang et al., 2010, Sadras and Lawson, 2013), irrigation schedules
    (Xu et al., 2018, Schulthess et al., 2019), soil tillage and mulching (Zhang et
    al., 2003, Qin et al., 2015, Wang et al., 2018a, Rashid et al., 2019), and irrigation
    techniques (Li et al., 2018, Umair et al., 2019). Zhang et al. (2010) analyzed
    26 winter wheat cultivars grown in Hebei Province from 1970 to 2002 and reported
    that early flowering winter wheat cultivars produced more dry matter during grain
    filling and transferred more accumulated reserves to economic yield. Xu et al.
    (2018) reported that two irrigations, one each at jointing and anthesis (total
    150 mm), improved grain yield and WUE by increasing biomass post-anthesis, harvest
    index (HI) and grain number per m2 of winter wheat, and recommended it as the
    optimal limited irrigation practice for wheat production in the Hebei Province.
    Ma et al. (2015) recommended rotary tillage after subsoiling every two or three
    years as a desirable tillage practice for increasing yields and WUE of winter
    wheat in the NCP. Straw mulching improved WUE by 10% (Zhang et al., 2003, Qin
    et al., 2015), reduced soil evaporation by 25–40% (Wang et al., 2018a), and improved
    soil water storage by 10%, yield by 12%, and avoided soil pollution caused by
    plastic mulching (Rashid et al., 2019). Li et al. (2018) revealed that drip irrigation
    and micro-sprinkling irrigation improved grain yield by10% and 14% and increased
    WUE by 12% and 18% in winter wheat, respectively, and recommended micro-sprinkling
    irrigation with water and fertilizer to improve yield, WUE and nitrogen fertilizer
    use efficiency of winter wheat in the NCP. Despite the extensive research, few
    studies have investigated the irrigation effects on the whole year’s crop production
    and WUE of winter wheat–summer maize double cropping system using actual field
    experiments rather than modelling. Given the abundant 4500–5300 °C days of annual
    growing season temperatures, the intensive double cropping of winter wheat–summer
    maize has been a valued cropping system for guaranteeing food production and taking
    full advantage of light and heat resources. Feng et al. (2018) compared total
    water consumption, yield, and WUE of a winter wheat–summer maize system with ten
    irrigation treatments (five irrigated wheat/rainfed maize and five irrigated wheat/maize
    irrigated at sowing regimes) over two years and concluded that the W3M1 treatment
    (three irrigations for wheat/one for maize at sowing stage) produced the highest
    yield but also had the highest ETa. Wang et al. (2018b) reported that reducing
    irrigation decreased the yield but increased WUE and significantly advanced the
    harvest date of winter wheat, which caused that the summer maize sowing date advanced
    significantly, and the flowering date subsequently advanced 2–8 days, thus extending
    the summer maize grain filling stage. The yield and WUE of summer maize were higher
    under reduced irrigation than conventional irrigation, which compensated for the
    winter wheat yield loss from reduced irrigation. From these starts, it is imperative
    to investigate sustainable deficit irrigation regimes for the whole winter wheat–summer
    maize system via long-term experiments to find options that contribute to the
    permanent reduction of irrigation water use without sacrificing too much yield.
    This study systematically summarized a 16-year field experiment (2003–2018) that
    applied different irrigation schedules to the winter wheat–summer maize double
    cropping system conducted at a representative field location in the North China
    Plain. The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of the different
    irrigation schedules on annual total water consumption (ETa) and groundwater table
    decline, together with yield and water productivity (WP), thus revealing the relationship
    between yield and ETa or irrigation over time, and making strides toward an optimized
    irrigation regime for the combined wheat–maize system. Improving the WUE of the
    dominant winter wheat–summer maize system is crucial for the NCP. Further, extending
    this solution to other water-stressed agricultural regions could increase sustainable
    food production systems globally. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study site, climate,
    and soil A 16-year field experiment (Oct. 2002–Oct. 2018) evaluated different
    irrigation schedules for a typical winter wheat–summer maize double cropping system
    at the Luancheng Agro-ecosystem Experimental Station (37°50′ N, 114°40′ E, altitude
    50.1 m), Luancheng County, Hebei Province. The experimental station is one of
    36 agricultural ecosystem stations of the Chinese Ecological Research Network
    (CERN). The site is representative of agricultural production and climate conditions
    in the northern part of the NCP (Fig. 1). The groundwater table in Luancheng has
    been decreasing by 1 m yr-1 for decades (Fig. 2). Download : Download high-res

    and groundwater table at the Luancheng Experimental Station. The experimental
    site has a warm, temperate zone, semi-humid monsoon climate. The annual mean air
    temperature is 12.20 °C and the frost-free period is about 200 days. The average
    annual rainfall in the last 20 years was 536.8 mm, with sharp yearly fluctuations
    and uneven seasonal distribution. Generally, 60–70% of the yearly precipitation
    occurs from June to September. Soil pH of 0–20 cm is 7.8. The experimental site
    has loam soil with sandy loam in the surface layers of 0–40 cm, loam at 40–80 cm
    depth, and clay below 80 cm. The average water holding capacity is 36% (v/v),
    and the wilting point is 14% (v/v) for the top 2 m of the soil profile. Averaged
    across three years, the plow soil layer (0–20 cm) contains 15.10 g kg-1 organic
    matter, 1.01 g kg-1 total nitrogen, 9.33 mg kg-1 available phosphate, and 95.60 mg kg-1
    available potassium. 2.2. Experimental design The experiment commenced in Oct.
    2002, comprising seven irrigation treatments for a winter wheat–summer maize double
    cropping system in randomized complete-block design with three replicates. Each
    subplot was 32 m2 (8 × 4 m). A buffer of 1.0 m was placed around the subplots
    to minimize horizontal water movement between adjacent plots. Each treatment was
    established and continued in the same plot. The cultivars of winter wheat and
    summer maize were the local popular varieties as recommended by the local farmers,
    tracking how their preferences changed over time (winter wheat: cv. Gaoyou503;
    Nongke 2004, 2009, 2011; Xinshi 633; summer maize: cv. Zhengdan958, Xianyu 335).
    The same varieties of wheat and maize were used in all seven irrigation treatments
    within the same year. The seeding rate was 180 kg ha-1 for winter wheat and 66,667
    plants per hectare for summer maize, respectively. Winter wheat was planted following
    the local practices with four rows closely together; and between two four close
    rows there was a wide row spacing of 30 cm. The four close rows were spacing around
    12 cm. The row spacing and plant spacing of maize were 50 cm and 28 cm, respectively.
    The crop growing periods were mid-October to mid-June the following year for winter
    wheat and mid-June to early October for summer maize. There were no fallow periods
    between consecutives crops. Both winter wheat and summer maize were sown by seeding
    machinery and harvested by combined-harvester. Winter wheat straw was mulched
    on the ground and summer maize straw was plowed in to the 0–20 cm surface layer.
    The irrigation scheduling was set up at the critical growth stages of winter wheat
    and summer maize in accord with local agronomic practices. The broad irrigation
    schedule, including time and amount at each crop growth stage, is detailed in
    Table 1. Irrigation amount was monitored by controlling electricity meter. The
    seven irrigation treatments were symbolized by: W0M0, W1M1, W2M1, W2M2, W3M2,
    W4M2, and W4M3, where W is winter wheat, M is summer maize, and 0, 1, 2, 3, and
    4 are the different irrigation times. For example, W1M1 is winter wheat with one
    irrigation event (75 mm) and summer maize with one irrigation event (75 mm). W3M2
    is the local farmer irrigation strategy in the study area. Irrigation amounts
    and dates were consistent each year with only one minor adjustment: if there were
    heavy rain on the scheduled irrigation day, irrigation would be delayed. Table

    W1M1 is winter wheat with one irrigation event (75 mm) and summer maize with one
    irrigation event (75 mm). The fertilizer scheduling for winter wheat and summer
    maize under different irrigation treatments is shown in Table 2. Fertilizer was
    increased above a base amount in the higher irrigation treatments to compensate
    for leaching of N by the extra downward flow so that nitrogen scarcity would not
    come to dominate yield. The basal fertilizer was broadcast and incorporated into
    the soil. Additional N fertilizer was top-dressed either with an irrigation or
    with a rainfall event. The irrigation, fertilizer, cultivation and tillage kept
    essentially the same operations during all experimental years. This was to help
    isolate the effect of irrigation on water consumption and groundwater table prediction,
    the yearly total grain yield and water productivity of winter wheat-summer maize
    double cropping system in seven irrigations treatments during a 16 year experiment
    period. Table 2. Fertilization schedule including time and amount of winter wheat

    Daily meteorological data, including sunshine duration, maximum and minimum air
    temperatures, wind speed, relative humidity, and precipitation, from 2002 to 2018
    were obtained from an automatic weather station near the experimental plots. Monthly
    precipitation and temperature each year are shown in Fig. 3. Crops were harvested
    using a conventional combine equipped with an automated weighing system for determining
    grain yield. Soil volumetric moisture content (1.8 m profile) was regularly measured
    with a neutron probe (L520) at 20 cm increments every ten days during the wheat
    and maize growing seasons. The top 20 cm soil moisture was regularly measured
    using the thermo-gravimetric method because neutron probe measurement was inaccurate
    near the surface. The thermos-gravimetric method employed a 105 ℃ oven for drying.

    each year or each crop growth season was distinguished as wet, normal or dry according
    to Eq. (1) (Wang, 2013a) to identify crop growths responses and yields to different
    irrigation strategies in different rainfall years. Wet year: Pi＞P+0·33σ； (1) Normal
    year: P-0·33σ≤Pi≤P+0·33σ； Dry year: Pi＜P-0·33σ； where Pi is the i year’s or crop
    season’s precipitation (mm), P is average year’s or crop season’s precipitation
    from 1960 to 2018 (mm), and σ is standard deviation of P (mm). The 16 year period
    provided a very helpful variety of seasonal precipitation amounts. For winter
    wheat, the average seasonal precipitation from 1960 to 2018 was 114.2 ± 52.6 mm;
    that is, Pi > 131. 6 mm for wet wheat season, Pi < 96.9 mm for dry wheat season,
    and 96.9 ≤ Pi ≤ 131.6 mm for normal wheat season. For summer maize, the average
    seasonal precipitation from1960 to 2018 was 355.4 ± 144.5 mm; that is, Pi > 403.1 mm
    for wet maize season, Pi < 307.7 mm for dry maize season, and 307.7 ≤ Pi ≤ 403.1 mm
    for normal maize season. For the whole cropping year, the average annual precipitation
    from 1960 to 2018 was 469.6 ± 164.8 mm; that is, Pi > 524.0 mm for wet year; Pi < 415.2 mm
    for dry year, and 415.2 ≤ Pi ≤ 524.0 mm for normal year. The distribution of wet,
    normal, and dry seasons for winter wheat, summer maize, and the whole cropping

    web version of this article.) 2.5. Calculations 2.5.1. Actual evapotranspiration
    and recharge Crop actual evapotranspiration (ETa) and recharge for each plot was
    calculated by Kendy model (Kendy et al., 2003, 2004) using the observed meteorological
    data and measured soil moisture contents and crop parameters, which was developed
    based on the one-dimensional water balance model (Eq. (2)). (2) ETa = P + I –
    SWD + U – R - D) where ETa is evapotranspiration (mm); P is precipitation measured
    from the automated weather station near the experimental site (mm); I is irrigation
    amount (mm); U is the upward capillary flow into the root zone (mm); R is surface
    runoff (mm); D is downward capillary flow into the root zone (mm); SWD is the
    change in soil water storage in the 0–180 cm soil profile from sowing to maturity
    (mm). Upward and downward capillary flow were estimated using Darcy’s law (within
    Kendy’s model) and they were indicated to be negligible at the experimental site.
    Runoff was also negligible during the growing seasons. The Kendy model assumes
    that water flows vertically downward under a unit gradient; evaporation and infiltration
    are separate and sequential processes. Evapotranspiration is allocated to evaporation
    and transpiration as a function of leaf area index (LAI) and limited by soil moisture
    content. Evaporation and transpiration are distributed through the soil profile
    as exponential functions of soil and root depth, respectively (Kendy et al., 2003,
    Yang et al., 2015a, Yang et al., 2015b, Yang et al., 2019). The Kendy model uses
    a daily time step. Model inputs include basic soil properties [e.g., field capacity
    (v/v), soil wilting point (v/v), saturation (v/v), Ksat (saturated hydraulic conductivity),
    α (unsaturated conductivity parameter), soil depth (cm), theta_sat (initiating
    soil moisture content, v/v)], crop characteristics [e.g., daily root depth (cm)
    and LAI], and meteorological data [e.g., daily pan evaporation (cm), daily precipitation
    (cm) and irrigation amount (cm)], and model outputs include daily soil moisture
    content at each soil layer (v/v), daily groundwater recharge (cm) and daily ETa
    (mm) (Kendy et al., 2003). A detailed flow diagram of the model inputs and outputs
    is presented in Fig. S1 in the supplementary material. The soil physical input
    parameters were taken from the measured data and earlier studies (Kendy et al.,
    2004, Yang et al., 2015a, Yang et al., 2019) and are detailed in Table S1. The
    seasonal root zone depths and LAI of winter wheat and summer maize were derived
    from the measured data. The model performance was tested and showed good simulations
    of the daily soil moisture content, ETa, and recharge amount by comparing the
    simulated and observed soil moisture storage in our previous studies (Yang et
    al., 2015a, Yang et al., 2019). At the farmers’ irrigation level (W3M2) from 2003
    to 2015, the RMSE (root mean square error) between the simulated and observed
    soil moisture storage of 0–180 cm soil profile of the winter wheat–summer maize
    double cropping system was 4.0 cm (Yang et al., 2015a, Yang et al., 2019). Similarly,
    Kendy et al. (2003) previously reported an RMSE of 4.2 cm between simulated and
    measured soil moisture storage at 11 soil depth intervals from 0 to 200 cm in
    a winter wheat–summer maize cropping system under different irrigation treatments
    at the same site from 1998 to 2001. Sixteen other sites in Hebei Province produced
    successful simulations using the model. In addition, simulated evapotranspiration
    compared well with that measured by a large-scale lysimeter. This study applied
    the Kendy model to calculate the ETa and recharge of the winter wheat–summer maize
    double cropping system under the seven irrigation treatments in the same field
    as before, therefore, we do not repeat the comparison of measured and simulated
    soil moisture storage again in this study. 2.5.2. Groundwater table change inferred
    from net groundwater use We defined net groundwater depletion (NWD, mm/growing
    season) beneath each crop in a given plot as: (3) NWD=R-I where R is deep percolation
    (mm/ growing season) calculated by the Kendy model described above (Kendy et al.,
    2003, Yang et al., 2015a, Yang et al., 2019) and I is irrigation amount (mm/growing
    season). When NWD is negative, deep percolation < irrigation, and groundwater
    is depleted. When NWD is positive, deep percolation > irrigation, and groundwater
    increases. The recharge of the groundwater table each year is calculated from
    the percolation rate at 180 cm and a lag time to reach the groundwater. We assumed
    that any water in the soil water balance model that flows out the bottom of the
    180 cm soil profile continues as deep percolation, which eventually recharges
    groundwater. The water table was observed to respond to annual precipitation changes
    with a one-year time lag (because of the water table’s cumulative drop to many
    meters below the surface). The effect is spread over two years when overall considering
    the historical behavior of precipitation and the groundwater table data (detailed
    in Yang et al., 2015a, Yang et al., 2015b). Thus, the potential changes in groundwater
    table due to its withdrawal to irrigate for winter wheat and summer maize can
    be simply calculated over time as follows: (4) where Δh is the groundwater table
    change (m yr–1) of the winter wheat–summer maize double cropping system having
    a specified irrigation treatment, and NWD is the net groundwater use (mm yr–1)
    calculated as recharge by deep percolation minus the amount of groundwater used
    for irrigation (Eq (3)). μ is the specific yield set to 0.2 (Yang et al., 2015a,
    Yang et al., 2015b, Yang et al., 2019). We adopted 85% of the land area in Luancheng
    County being covered by irrigated winter wheat-summer maize rotation (National
    Bureau of Statistics of China, 2019a, National Bureau of Statistics of China,
    2019b). 2.5.3. Productivity indices Water productivity (WP) was calculated as
    follows: (5) where WP is water productivity for grain yield of one crop or one
    cropping system (kg m-3), Y is total grain yield of one crop or one cropping system
    (kg ha-1), and ETa is total actual evapotranspiration over the whole crop growing
    season (mm) calculated from the Kendy model (Kendy et al., 2003). Irrigation water
    productivity (IWP) and marginal benefit were calculated as follows (Sun et al.,
    2015) (6) (7) where IWP is irrigation water productivity for grain yield of one
    crop or one cropping system (kg m-3); Y and Yd are total grain yield of one crop
    or one cropping system with and without irrigation (kg ha-1), respectively; I
    is irrigation amount (mm). The grain yield of W0M0 was considered Yrainfed. The
    marginal benefit is the yield increment from increasing ETa. 2.6. Statistical
    analysis Statistical methods including analysis of variance (ANOVA), generalized
    linear models (GLM), correlation analysis, and regression analysis were carried
    out using Statistical Analysis System 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., 2011) software,
    and differences were considered significant at the 0.05 level. 3. Results 3.1.
    Water consumption and its components The average annual water consumption (ETa)
    of different irrigation treatments for the winter wheat–summer maize double cropping
    system from 2003 to 2018 increased with increased irrigation, from 427.3 to 891.0 mm
    (P < 0.05) (Fig. 5). The rainfed treatment had the lowest ETa (427 mm), significantly
    lower than all other treatments (P < 0.05). The W4M3 treatment with total annual
    irrigation of 525 mm had the highest ETa (891.0 mm). The water consumption components
    of each irrigation treatment are listed in the supplementary material (Tables
    S2-S8). Download : Download high-res image (195KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 5. Annual water consumption (ETa) of winter wheat–summer maize double
    cropping system under different irrigation treatments. Soil water storage, precipitation,
    and irrigation are important components of water consumption. Soil water storage,
    especially the pre-sowing soil water storage, plays a vital role in supplying
    water for winter wheat growth. The 16-year average for pre-sowing soil water storage
    of winter wheat in W0M0 and W1M1 were 394.1 and 390.9 mm, respectively. The corresponding
    soil water storage change from winter wheat sowing to harvest in W0M0 and W1M1
    contributed 33% (79.8 mm) and 32% (105.0 mm) of total seasonal ETa. These treatments
    were followed by W2M1, W2M2 and W3M2 with the pre-sowing soil water storage for
    winter wheat averaging 421.8, 431.8 and 450.8 mm, accounting for 21% (85.1 mm),
    27% (112.8 mm) and 16% (79.7 mm) of the total seasonal ETa, respectively. Finally,
    the lowest group was W4M2 and W4M3 with the pre-sowing soil water storage averaging
    448.9 and 478.9 mm, which only contributed 3% and 9% of the total seasonal ETa,
    respectively (Table 3). Table 3. Average soil water storage (SWS) and its contribution

    including precipitation, soil water storage in 1.8 m soil profile at sowing and
    harvest, ∆ soil water storage, ETa and recharge of winter wheat and summer maize
    in their respective growing seasons each year and each treatment are listed in
    the Supplementary material (Table S2–S8). Increasing amounts of irrigation water
    for winter wheat reduced its consumption of stored soil water. Winter wheat root
    can reach depths of 2 m (Zhou et al., 2008). Thus, increasing soil water use,
    especially the deep soil water below the reach of maize roots, could reduce the
    consumption of irrigation water by winter wheat. Deep root growth can increase
    deep soil water use, which is beneficial when there is insufficient topsoil water.
    Controlling the soil water content before the jointing stage of winter wheat could
    promote longer root growth, providing more drought resistance later (Wang et al.,
    2006). Therefore, improving the soil water use efficiency under the deficit irrigation
    is essential for reducing irrigation and seasonal ETa of winter wheat. Reducing
    the irrigation amount during later growth could induce winter wheat to absorb
    more soil water, leaving more empty soil water storage capacity at harvest stage,
    and providing more room to hold excess rainfall during the flood season after
    winter wheat harvest, for use by the following crop. 3.2. Inferred groundwater
    table change from irrigation regimes The cumulative groundwater table declined
    with increasing irrigation input in the winter wheat–summer maize double cropping
    system (Fig. 6). All irrigation treatments decreased the inferred groundwater
    table. The rainfed condition without irrigation (W0M0) was most beneficial for
    mitigating the groundwater table decline. The cumulative groundwater decline in
    W0M0 treatment was smallest, about 1.15 m from 2004 to 2018, with an average groundwater
    decline rate of 0.1 m yr-1. The W1M1 treatment had the next best result, with
    a cumulative groundwater decline of 6.7 m, averaging 0.5 m yr-1. It was followed
    by W2M1 with the cumulative groundwater table decline of 10.6 m, averaging 0.8 m yr-1.
    W2M2 exhibited a cumulative groundwater table decline of 15.1 m, averaging 1.1 m yr-1.
    The groundwater table decrease line in W2M2 nearly matched the observed decline
    measured at the Luancheng Experiment Station (Fig. 6) and had a similar value
    to those reported by others in this area (Kendy et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2015a).
    The observed groundwater value in 2018 (red dot in Fig. 6) increased, which could
    be attributed to: (1) measuring error because the rope for measuring the groundwater
    table in the deep well reportedly changed at that year, or (2) planting structure
    adjustments made by national water saving policy. Since 2016, the government has
    encouraged farmers in this region to reduce the high water consumption crop planting
    such as winter wheat and advocated crop rotation incorporating a fallow period,
    offering 500 RMB subsidies per person as compensation, especially in the serious
    groundwater over-extraction area in Hebei Province, to mitigate the groundwater
    decline (Ministry of Water Resources of the People''s Republic of China, 2019).

    measured at the experimental station. T1W0M0 denotes wheat and maize both in total
    rainfed, T2W1M1 denotes one irrigation for winter wheat and summer maize, respectively;

    denotes two irrigations for winter wheat and summer maize, respectively; T5W3M2
    denotes three irrigations for winter wheat and two for summer maize (farmer traditional
    practice); T6W4M2 denotes four irrigations for winter wheat and two for maize,
    T7W4M3 denotes four irrigations for winter wheat and three for maize; all with
    75 mm per time. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure
    legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) The traditional
    farmer irrigation regime in the winter wheat–summer maize double cropping system,
    i.e., W3M2 using 375 mm irrigation per year, contributed to a sizeable cumulative
    inferred groundwater table decline, approximately 19.1 m from 2004 to 2018 averaging
    1.4 m yr-1. The dominance of this cropping system in practice is why the groundwater
    table has persistently declined over the past 40 years. It is also the crucial
    motivator for optimizing the irrigation schedule for the whole winter wheat–summer
    maize system. Obviously, the more water generous W4M2 and W4M3 treatments both
    are even more unsustainable for groundwater use, resulting in the cumulative inferred
    groundwater table declines of 23.2 m and 26.3 m, averaging 1.7 and 1.9 m yr-1
    (Fig. 6). 3.3. Annual total grain yield and WP effects Yield and WP both had a
    quadratic relationship with ETa. Total grain yield of winter wheat–summer maize
    generally increased with increasing crop water use. After ETa reached a certain
    level, yield was maintained at a relatively stable level. Further increases in
    ETa did not improve yield. That is, moderate deficit irrigation improved yield
    and WP of winter wheat–summer maize better than the full irrigation treatments
    (Fig. 7). WP decreased with the increase in ETa. For the highest WP, ETa should
    be reduced below the ETa for the highest grain yield (Fig. 7). Zhang et al. (2017a)
    analyzed the relationship between relative winter wheat grain yield (grain yield/maximum
    grain yield in a season) and relative evapotranspiration (evapotranspiration/potential
    evapotranspiration) and reported that 86% of potential seasonal evapotranspiration
    produced the maximum grain yield in most winter wheat seasons from 1987 to 2015.

    annual total grain yield of winter wheat–summer maize in rainfed condition was
    10,092.5 kg ha-1, significantly lower than that supplied with any irrigation (P < 0.05).
    The average annual total grain yield increased with increasing irrigation input
    to a point, after which no significant extra yield occurred (Fig. 9a and earlier
    Fig. 8). The difference in annual total yield from the entirely rainfed (W0M0)
    to 150 mm irrigation annually (W1M1) was the largest one, about 25% (2492.9 kg ha-1).
    The annual total grain yield of W2M1 was also significantly higher than that of
    W1M1 treatment, being 659.3 kg ha-1 or about 5% (P < 0.05). No significantly increase
    of the total annual yield was found from W2M1 (13,244.7 kg ha-1) to W2M2 (13,878.0 kg ha-1).
    Statistical analysis also showed no significant increase of the annual total grain
    yield fromW2M2 to W3M2 to W4M2 to W4M3. The inflection point for annual total
    yield occurred at W2M2 (Fig. 9a). Download : Download high-res image (471KB) Download

    both in total rainfed, T2W1M1 denotes one irrigation for winter wheat and summer
    maize, respectively; T3W2M1 denotes two irrigations for winter wheat and one for
    summer maize; T4W2M2 denotes two irrigations for winter wheat and summer maize,
    respectively; T5W3M2 denotes three irrigations for winter wheat and two for summer
    maize (farmer traditional practice); T6W4M2 denotes four irrigations for winter
    wheat and two for maize, T7W4M3 denotes four irrigations for winter wheat and
    three for maize; all with 75 mm per time.). Annual water productivity (WP) of
    winter wheat–summer maize system under different irrigation treatments decreased
    with increasing irrigation input, ranging from 1.6 to 2.4 kg m-3 (Fig. 9b). The
    largest average annual WP was 2.4 kg m-3 under entirely rainfed condition. The
    average annual WP in W1M1 (150 mm annual irrigation) and W2M1 (225 mm annual irrigation)
    treatments were 2.3 and 2.2 kg m-3, respectively, followed by the W2M2, W3M2,
    and W4M2 treatments with 1.8–2.0 kg m-3 and the W4M3 (525 mm annual irrigation)
    treatment had the lowest (1.6 kg m-3) (Fig. 9b). The W1M1 treatment had the highest
    annual average annual IWP of 1.77 kg m-3 for the whole winter wheat–summer maize
    system, closely followed by W2M1 of 1.62 kg m-3, both of which were significantly
    greater than the other treatments. The W2M2 treatment had an average annual IWP
    of 1.27 kg m-3. The last group were W3M2, W4M2 and W4M3 with the annual average
    IWP of 1.05, 0.98 and 0.85 kg m-3, respectively (Fig. 9c). Both IWP and yield
    increase rates decreased with increasing irrigation application. The inflection
    point for average annual IWP also occurred at W2M2 treatment (Fig. 9c). Marginal
    benefit equates to the net ETa efficiency because it is based on the yield produced
    above the rainfed yield divided by the net ETa difference for the irrigated crop.
    The marginal benefit of the whole winter wheat–summer maize system also declined
    as the irrigation amount increased (Fig. 9d). The marginal benefit of W1M1 treatment
    was the highest of 2.45 kg m-3, significantly higher than the other treatments
    (P < 0.05). The W2M1 and W2M2 treatments had the next highest marginal benefits
    (1.99 and 1.48 kg m-3, respectively). The inflection point occurred at W3M2, the
    farmers’ traditional irrigation treatment (1.24 kg m-3), which did not significantly
    differ from the W3M2 to W4M2, and W4M3 treatments. When the irrigation amount
    applied reached a certain level, the grain yield would actually decrease. ETa
    was decided by the weather and crop factors. Precipitation and soil water storage
    affected these differences. An optimized irrigation schedule could be developed
    according to recent rainfall and soil water storage. In sum, considering the overall
    performance for annual total gain yield, ETa, kinds of WP and the most important
    indicator of groundwater decline, the W2M1 treatment had the highest utility for
    improving yield and maintaining higher water use efficiency. For irrigation water
    conservation purposes, the W2M1 treatment (225 mm total annual irrigation including
    two irrigations at the overwintering and jointing stages of winter wheat and one
    irrigation at sowing of summer maize) maintained relatively stable and higher
    yields—with winter wheat averaging 6297.3 kg ha-1 (± 871.7 kg ha-1) and summer
    maize averaging 6947.4 kg ha-1 (± 1130.7 kg ha-1) — high water use efficiency
    and irrigation water productivity, and mitigated the groundwater decline. 4. Discussion
    4.1. Yield, WP, and IWP of winter wheat under different irrigation regimes The
    average yield improvement of winter wheat by adding one more irrigation increment
    in the past 16 years covered was 41.3% from rainfed (3703.6 kg ha-1) to W1(5234.3 kg ha-1),
    23.6% from W1 to W2 (6469.7 kg ha-1) and 9.6% from W2 to W3 (7092.4 kg ha-1) (P < 0.05).
    W4 produced similar yields to that of W3 (P > 0.05) (Fig. S2a). The largest yield
    improvement occurred between rainfed and one irrigation, consistent with findings
    by Zhang et al. (2017a), who found that irrigation at the jointing stage significantly
    improved winter wheat yield. The average annual wheat yield of 3703.6 kg ha-1
    falls in the range of 2950 kg ha-1 (Pei et al., 2011) to 4684.1 kg ha-1 (Zhang
    et al., 2017a). The average annual WP of rainfed winter wheat was 2.20 kg m-3,
    significantly higher than the irrigated treatments (P < 0.05). No significantly
    increase occurred from W1 to W2 to W3 to W4 for winter wheat’s WP (Fig. S2b).
    For IWP, one irrigation application obtained the highest IWP (2.04 kg m-3). The
    average IWP values were 1.84, 1.61, and 1.23 kg m-3 for W2, W3, and W4, respectively
    (Fig. S2c). It is obviously that with the incremental irrigation increases all
    of yield, WP and IWP incremental increases diminished. Adding one irrigation at
    the jointing stage to the total rainfed treatment had the greatest improvements
    in yield and WP. One irrigation at the jointing stage is most important for the
    yield increment of winter wheat. Wang et al. (2018b) reported that in a three-year
    field experiment irrigation at the jointing stage of winter wheat increased yield
    by 34.5%, while adding irrigation at the jointing and booting stages only increased
    yield by 11.8% and was accompanied by an increase in ETa but no increase in WP.
    Madani et al. (2010) also reported that jointing irrigation was critical for determining
    grain numbers per area and sink capacity of winter wheat. Supplemental irrigation
    from recovery to jointing resulted in more soil water before anthesis. Biomass
    vigor also accelerated root growth, improving soil water use during the grain-filling
    stage (Zhang et al., 2003). It is important to control the water supply during
    later growth of winter wheat. Excessive irrigation during later growth promoted
    stem growth, delaying reproductive development and reducing yields (Liu et al.,
    2013). Rapid increase in temperature during grain-filling in winter wheat can
    accelerate crop maturity and reduced potential grain yield, especially with frequent
    irrigations (Zhang et al., 2017a). In the North China Plain, the grain-filling
    period of winter wheat only lasts for about one month from the beginning of May
    to early June. Dry hot wind in May and June accelerates maturity, decreasing the
    grain-filling rate, reducing grain weights and decreasing the harvest index (HI)
    of wheat (Sun et al., 2006). Water deficits would accelerate wheat growth and
    make anthesis earlier; theses advanced by days would be compensated for by longer
    grain filling duration to improve the grain-filling rate, grain weight and HI,
    and could alleviate the effect of dry hot winds during late grain-filling (Zhang
    et al., 2017a, Wang et al., 2018b). Zhao et al. (2018) also reported that it is
    important to manage wheat biomass production before anthesis and the translocation
    processes after anthesis for better production by regulating the water supply.
    Sufficient irrigation for winter wheat in the high rainfall season resulted in
    wheat later-maturing, which negatively affected normal growth and grain yield
    formation (Wang et al., 2016). 4.2. Soil water storage contributed to the crop
    growth Daily water requirement was small, with little precipitation during early
    growth of winter wheat; thus, prior soil moisture storage contributes most to
    the early crop water requirement. Winter wheat grew rapidly after winter dormancy,
    consuming topsoil water since most of the roots were restricted to this layer.
    During this stage, the soil water storage could not play the primary role. Thus,
    irrigation at the jointing stage is an important water source for crop use (Zhang
    et al., 2017a, Zhang et al., 2013). Our results showed large variations in soil
    water storage at the winter wheat harvest between the different irrigation treatments,
    as reported by Liu et al. (2013). Drier soil during the winter wheat harvest could
    make room to retain more water falling during the next rainy season, reducing
    the loss of water to deep percolation from the root zone in the following summer
    maize season. Previous studies also verified this. Lv et al. (2013) reported that
    the soil water depletion contributed up to 45% of the total season ETa for the
    maximum yield of winter wheat with high pre-sowing soil water storage. Wang et
    al. (2006) also advocated improving soil water use efficiency for winter wheat
    to 45–50% via two irrigations during spring in the NCP. Improving soil water use
    efficiency and reducing irrigation could also reduce deep N-leaching and decrease
    water pollution. The soil water deficit in the W2M1 (two irrigations in spring
    for winter wheat) treatment could accelerate the transfer of dry matter from vegetative
    organs to grain, consequently reducing N retention in the vegetative mass and
    improving the physiological availability of N (Wang et al., 2006). Zhang et al.
    (1999) also emphasized that pre-sowing available soil water made a significant
    contribution to total water use since winter wheat was planted after the monsoon
    season. About 50–180 mm stored water was available for winter wheat, depending
    on the rainfall during the monsoon season from July to September. Stored soil
    water obviously contributed most of the water used by rainfed winter wheat. However,
    winter wheat used less stored soil water as irrigation increased (Zhang et al.,
    1999, Wang et al., 2006). Moreover, the reduced availability of soil water along
    with a water-deficit induced reduction in crop leaf area and stomatal conductance
    were responsible for less ET under deficit irrigation levels for wheat and maize
    (Gheysari et al., 2017, Rathore et al., 2017, Wang, 2017, Comas et al., 2019,
    Lamptey et al., 2020, Memon et al., 2021). Thus, pre-sowing stored soil water
    and rainfall during the crop-growing season should be considered when developing
    irrigation schedules. 4.3. Yield, WP, and IWP of summer maize under different
    irrigation Rainfed summer maize had an average yield of 6394.6 kg ha-1. Irrigation
    (75 mm) at the sowing stage (M1) significantly increased yield by 12%, but additional
    irrigation did not significantly increase yields, as reported by Feng et al. (2018)
    and Fang et al. (2021). Irrigation during the summer maize sowing stage was essential
    for improving the annual yield and WP, because sufficient soil moisture at the
    sowing stage of summer maize promoted the germination, seedling emergence and
    root growth (Li et al., 2001). Then the extra increase of irrigation beyond M1
    did not play a significant role in yield increase in our study, which is consistent
    with Wang et al. (2018b) who reported that reduced irrigation increased kernel
    number per ear, thousand-kernel weight and significantly increased HI and ear
    characteristics (e.g., ear length and kernel number per row) of summer maize.
    Additional irrigation supplied the moisture required by numerous pathogens as
    well as their host crops, which potentially influenced crop growth conditions
    of crops and their yield (Rotem and Palti, 1969, Dixon, 2015). The soil water
    content at summer maize sowing is usually affected by the water consumption of
    the previous crop (winter wheat) and the distribution and amount of precipitation
    (Varvel, 1994). Therefore, irrigation at sowing could help avoid high temperature
    and the dry, hot winds, and furthermore improve seed germination and emergence
    of summer maize (Zhao et al., 2018, Wang et al., 2018b). 4.4. Optimized irrigation
    scheduling for wheat–maize system The W1M1 (one irrigation at winter wheat jointing
    stage and one irrigation at summer maize sowing stage) treatment had the largest
    yield increase of 24.7%, relative to the fully rainfed treatment (W0M0). Significantly
    yield increases also occurred from rainfed to W1M1 and W2M1 to W2M2. Feng et al.
    (2018) reported that a regime similar to W2M1 (180 mm annual irrigation including
    60 mm at wheat sowing, 60 mm at wheat elongation stage, and 60 mm at maize sowing)
    treatment exhibited relatively high grain yield, low total water consumption,
    and higher WP at Wuqiao Experiment Station in the NCP. Wang et al. (2018b) reported
    that reducing annual total irrigation in the wheat–maize system by reducing the
    irrigation amount in the wheat season could significantly reduce wheat yield but
    increased the annual total grain yield (wheat+maize) by 1–8%. This is mainly because
    reducing the irrigation in the winter wheat season advanced the winter wheat flowering
    and harvest dates by 6–7 days and 10–11 days, respectively. Consequently, the
    growth duration and grain-filling stage of winter wheat decreased, advancing the
    summer maize sowing date by approximately 10 days. As a result, maize flowered
    earlier, increasing the grain-filling duration and subsequently increasing kernel
    weight and yield; the improved maize performance compensated for the loss of winter
    wheat yield. Overall, when considering total grain yield, ETa, kinds of WP, and
    the most important index of groundwater table decline, we recommend the W2M1 regime
    as the most optimized irrigation schedule for the whole winter wheat–summer maize
    system, with significantly higher groundwater use efficiency than farmers’ traditional
    practice (W3M2). A helpful direction in more precise irrigation scheduling would
    be to combine detailed crop-water modelling with longer-term historical weather
    scenarios and future climate change scenarios featuring a range of wet, normal
    and dry years. Meanwhile, the irrigation and fertilizer coupling and their interactions
    on the grain yield and water productivity of the whole wheat-maize system as well
    as the effects on the growth characteristic at each crop growth stage should be
    deeply revealed in the future study. 4.5. Prospects for a more sustainable wheat–maize
    system It is essential to develop an optimized irrigation schedule, reduce the
    irrigation amount and improve the water use efficiency for the winter wheat–summer
    maize double cropping system in view of the fierce conflict between traditional
    cropping practices and future groundwater availability in the NCP. Such schedules
    should also include comprehensive water-saving measures to improve the whole system’s
    sustainability. Crop yield improvement is affected by the interplay of various
    factors, such as the genotype and environment (G × E). Responses of crop yield
    to water stress depend on cultivars, irrigation, management, and climatic factors.
    Genotypic variation is one of the most important factors contributing to yield
    increases (Zhang et al., 2013, D''Andrea et al., 2016). Soil physical conditions
    changes by soil tillage also affect the crop response to water stress (Zhang et
    al., 2017a, Huynh et al., 2019, Peixoto et al., 2020). Liu et al. (2015) found
    that higher than optimum subsoil bulk density negatively affected crop performance
    under deficit water conditions. Water regime and N supply strongly affected aboveground
    and belowground biomass and water productivity of winter wheat (Wang et al., 2013b,
    Hirte et al., 2018, Qi et al., 2020). Reducing the redundancy of root growth in
    the topsoil layer and enhancing root growth in deep soil layers are attractive
    characteristics for wheat under water stress (White and Kirkegaard, 2010, Nosalewicz
    and Lipiec, 2014). Straw mulching benefited summer maize growth (Akhtar et al.,
    2018, Li et al., 2020, Fang et al., 2021) by preventing the exchange of water
    and heat between soil and atmosphere and thus inhibiting excessive increases in
    soil temperature (Hu et al., 2019). An optimized N rate and irrigation quota with
    drip irrigation improved crop productivity and water use efficiency of winter
    wheat (Wang et al., 2018a, Bai et al., 2020, Si et al., 2020) and summer maize
    (Qin et al., 2016, Zhang et al., 2017b, Zhou et al., 2019). These concepts can
    be integrated into water-saving management to improve crop yields and counter
    the diminished water availability in the future. Different water-saving strategies
    should be considered in water-saving policies for different households in areas
    in the North China Plain where groundwater is over-exploited. 5. Conclusion Improving
    water use efficiency to maintain or increase grain production while reducing groundwater
    pumpage for irrigation is critical for sustainable irrigated agricultural development
    in the NCP. A 16-year field experiment from 2003 to 2018, employing seven irrigation
    schedules focused on the dominant winter wheat–summer maize double cropping system
    in the NCP. This study systematically analyzed water consumption, groundwater
    table decline, grain yield, and water productivities for the wheat–maize system
    from this long time series. Results showed that total annual ETa increased from
    427.3 mm (Rainfed, W0M0) to 891.0 mm (W4M3), with increasing irrigation input.
    Total annual grain yield significantly increased with increasing irrigation from
    W0M0 to W2M1, and further irrigation amounts did not significantly increase yield.
    WP, IWP and marginal benefit all clearly decreased with increasing irrigation
    input. The inferred groundwater table declines verified that rainfed cropping
    is most beneficial for mitigating the groundwater decline with an annual decline
    rate of 0.1 m yr-1, followed by W1M1 (0.5 m yr-1) and W2M1 (0.8 m yr-1). The groundwater
    table decline in W2M2 almost matched the observed well water levels at the experimental
    site which exhibited a decline averaging 1.1 m yr-1. The W3M2 treatment, representing
    the farmers’ traditional practice, had a groundwater decline rate of 1.4 m yr-1,
    while W4M2 and W4M3 declined by almost 2.0 m yr-1. Overall, we recommended the
    W2M1 regime as the most optimized irrigation schedule for winter wheat–summer
    maize double cropping system in this region. This findings from the long-term
    field experiment of 16 years supplied useful information for building up a groundwater-saving
    and highly efficient irrigation schedule for the whole winter wheat–summer maize
    double cropping system in the North China Plain. Author contributions Xiaolin

  description: Nowadays, water scarcity and the increase in energy demand and their
    associated costs in pressurized irrigation systems are causing serious challenges.
    In addition, most of these pressurized irrigation systems has been designed to
    be operated on-demand where irrigation water is continuously available to farmers
    complexing the daily decision-making process of the water user association’ managers.
    Know in advance how much water will be applied by each farmer and its distribution
    during the day would facilitate the management of the system and would help to
    optimize the water use and energy costs. In this work, a new hybrid methodology
    (CANGENFIS) combining Multiple input -Multiple output, fuzzy logic, artificial
    neural networks and multiobjective genetic algorithms was developed to model farmer
    behaviour and short-term forecasting the distribution by tariff period of the
    irrigation depth applied at farm level. CANGENFIS which was developed in Matlab
    was applied to a real water user association located in Southwest Spain. Three
    optimal models for the main crops in the water user association were obtained.
    The average for all tariff periods of the representability (R2) and accuracy of
    the forecasts (standard error prediction, SEP) were 0.70, 0.76% and 0.85% and
    19.9%, 22.9% and 19.5%, for rice, maize and tomato crops models, respectively.

    challenges. In addition, most of these pressurized irrigation systems has been
    designed to be operated on-demand where irrigation water is continuously available
    to farmers complexing the daily decision-making process of the water user association’
    managers. Know in advance how much water will be applied by each farmer and its
    distribution during the day would facilitate the management of the system and
    would help to optimize the water use and energy costs. In this work, a new hybrid
    methodology (CANGENFIS) combining Multiple input -Multiple output, fuzzy logic,
    artificial neural networks and multiobjective genetic algorithms was developed
    to model farmer behaviour and short-term forecasting the distribution by tariff
    period of the irrigation depth applied at farm level. CANGENFIS which was developed
    in Matlab was applied to a real water user association located in Southwest Spain.
    Three optimal models for the main crops in the water user association were obtained.
    The average for all tariff periods of the representability (R2) and accuracy of
    the forecasts (standard error prediction, SEP) were 0.70, 0.76% and 0.85% and
    19.9%, 22.9% and 19.5%, for rice, maize and tomato crops models, respectively.

    Irrigated agriculture uses nearly 70% of the total water consumption in the world
    (Conforti, 2011). This value accounts for up to 90% of the total water resources
    in arid developing countries (Bazilian et al., 2011). In Europe, irrigated agriculture
    uses around 33% of total water used although this figure may reach over 80% in
    Southern Europe countries (EEA, 2012) and in the whole Mediterranean region. Thus,
    efficient water use is essential in a sustainable agricultural system because
    of reduced water availability (Hunt, 2004) mainly in arid and semi-arid regions
    like Spain. In Spain, after a National Modernization Plan of Irrigation (MARM,
    2010) water use efficiency was improved replacing the obsolete open-channel distribution
    systems by pressurize networks (Plusquellec, 2009). However, despite of the upgrading
    of these water distribution systems allowed to reduce the water used by 21%, the
    energy consumption per unit area was risen by 657% (Corominas, 2010) which may
    lead to additional costs for farmers that may be unable to afford such expense
    if their production is devoted to low-value crops. On the other hand, because
    of this modernization processes, most of the new irrigation systems were designed
    to be operated on-demand where water is continuously available to farmers who
    are free to decide how and when irrigate. Although the increased operation flexibility
    is a positive aspect for farmers, the management of the whole water distribution
    system is a more complex task because the hydraulic systems must work under a
    wide range of operating conditions, in terms of flow and pressure. In addition,
    since the liberalization of the Spanish Electricity Market, on 1st January 2008,
    the special tariffs for irrigation disappeared and now, Water Users Associations
    (WUA) are subject to the general industrial tariffs whose prices vary along the
    day and the irrigation season. Under this scenario of water scarcity, the increase
    in energy demand of the new pressurized irrigation systems, the uncertainty associated
    with irrigation water demand and the liberalization of the electricity market
    are causing serious challenges in the daily management of the WUAs. Related to
    this, water demand forecasting could be one of the main tools to improve the management
    of the WUAs and help managers in the daily decision-making processes. The recent
    revolution of the Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), as well as
    the development of new low-cost sensors capable to automatically collect thousands
    of robust data of the whole water-soil-plant-atmosphere system, has modified the
    technological environment of the current agriculture. The available technology
    offers new possibilities for the water demand forecasting that may lead to better
    water and energy use efficiencies, making the WUAs more sustainable, in environmental,
    social and economic aspects. In addition, the Cloud computing development and
    virtual storage has reduced the storage cost of Big Data (Bin and Xin, 2013).
    Thus, the synergism of techniques of Artificial Intelligence (AI) such as Artificial
    Neural Networks (ANNs), Fuzzy Logic (FL) and Genetic Algorithms (GAs) allow soft
    computing to incorporate human knowledge effectively, deal with imprecisions and
    uncertainty, and design adaptation strategies for improve the WUA management.
    AI techniques have been applied to solve different problems of water resources
    management and planning such as: modelling monthly, daily and hourly rainfall-runoff
    process (Agarwal et al., 2006, Anctil and Rat, 2005), real-time river level and
    lake stage forecasting (Ondimu and Murase, 2007) or the optimization of the multi-crop
    pattern plan using Fuzzy Logic and Genetic Algorithms (Rezaei et al., 2017). Previous
    research also works focused on the prediction of water demand at irrigation district
    level, using neuro-genetic algorithms (González Perea et al., 2015, Pulido-Calvo
    and Gutiérrez-Estrada, 2009). However, forecasting water demand at individual
    farmer level is an extremely complex task. Forecasting of the farmer’s behavior
    was addressed by González Perea (2017) and González Perea et al. (2018). Two models
    were developed to predict the occurrence of the irrigation events (González Perea,
    2017) and the daily applied irrigation depth (González Perea et al., 2018), respectively.
    However, an optimal daily decision making in WUAs requires not only the knowledge
    of the of irrigation events occurrence and the applied irrigation depths but their
    hourly distribution. Since electricity tariffs are organized in hourly periods,
    the knowledge of the hourly distribution of water consumption would be useful
    for the optimal contracting of these tariffs. In this work, a hybrid model combining
    Multiple-input Multiple output (MIMO) of an Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System
    (ANFIS) known as Co-active Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (CANFIS) has been developed
    to forecast one-day ahead the distribution in energy tariff periods of the irrigation
    depths applied at farm level. CANFIS has been optimized by the multiobjective
    GA NSGA-II (Deb et al., 2002). The model which was developed in Matlab™ and integrated
    as toolbox was validated and tested in a real WUA. 2. Study area and data source
    Canal del Zújar Irrigation District (CZID) (Fig. 1) was selected as real WUA to
    validate and test the forecast model developed in this study. The model was trained
    and tested with data from the 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 irrigation seasons. This
    WUA, located in Southwest Spain (Extremadura region), is made up of 10 independent
    hydraulic sectors covering a total area of 21141 ha. The closest weather station
    is “Don Benito-EFA” (UTM coordinates (x, y, zone): 252468, 431917, 30). The average
    temperature in the area ranges from 7.1 °C in January to 25 °C in July, and the
    average maximum temperature ranges from 13.2 °C to 35.1 °C. The average relative
    humidity ranged from 30.06% to 99.8%, with a mean value of 66.17% and a standard
    deviation of 17.30%. The average annual rainfall is 390 mm, with an average daily
    value of 1.03 mm but with maximum daily values that reach 20 mm The average wind
    speed ranged from 0.25 m s−1 to 7.43 m s−1 for the studied seasons. The maximum
    evapotranspiration occurs in July, with a daily average value of 7.03 mm and peak
    values around 9 mm. The average annual evapotranspiration is 1296 mm. Download

    Location of Sector II of the Canal del Zújar Irrigation District (CZID). Sector
    II was selected for this work because of the high amount of available data. This
    sector covers an irrigated area of 2691 ha and is composed of 191 hydrants with
    a nominal pressure at each hydrant of 25 m. The main crops are tomato, maize and
    rice (90% of the total irrigated area). The number of samples (water depth records)
    of each crop was 54,475, 18,568 and 4451, for tomato, maize and rice, respectively.
    Drip irrigation is used for tomato and maize, while rice is flood irrigated. The
    typical annual irrigation needs for these crops of this WUA are 6110 m3 ha−1,
    5950 m3 ha−1 and 11,103 m3 ha−1, respectively. The average and standard deviation
    of the area of the farms are 1.15 ha and 2.08 ha, respectively. However, the largest
    farm covers an area of 26 ha. Sector II of the CZID has a remote telemetry system
    which records every hour the volume of water applied in each hydrant. In addition,
    for each hydrant information about supplied farm and crops are also recorded.
    The electrical tariff in this WUA is organized in six periods, being period 1
    (P1) the most expensive period and period 6 (P6) the cheapest one. Fig. 2 shows
    the temporal distribution of each period along the irrigation season. Download

    3. Methodology 3.1. Model inputs identification A previous step to generate the
    hybrid model is needed to reduce the dimension of the input space and identify
    the significant inputs from the full set of possible inputs. There are many techniques
    to achieve this inputs space reduction. Principal components analysis or partial
    least square cardinal components are two of these techniques widely used. However,
    when the significant input variables resulting from these techniques are used
    in nonlinear models, very poor results are usually got (Lin et al., 1996). Therefore,
    an adaptation of the methodology developed by Lin et al. (1996) has been used
    in this work to identify the significant inputs. Lin et al. (1996) determined
    automatically the most significant inputs for a single output variable using fuzzy
    curves and fuzzy surfaces. Because of the MIMO (Multiple input -Multiple output)
    nature of the hybrid model developed in this work, an extension N dimensional
    of the fuzzy curves and fuzzy surfaces have been developed. Thus, the fuzzy curves
    have been extended to a beam of N-fuzzy and fuzzy surfaces have been transformed
    to N-dimensional fuzzy curves. The number of output variables of the predictive
    model defined the N-dimensionality of the fuzzy curves and surfaces. For a potential
    input variable iv, PIiv, fuzzy curve beams, civ,ov,are created (Eq. (1)). Each
    curve determined the relationship between iv and the output variable ov of the
    forecasting model (DWAov, daily amount of water applied by each farmer in the
    energy tariff period ov). (1) where µiv, k:ov is the fuzzy membership function
    of point k in the space iv- DWAov which relates the potential input variable iv
    and the daily amount of water applied by each farmer in the energy tariff period
    ov and it is defined by Eq. (2); Mov is the total number of points in the space
    PIiv-DWAov; DWAk:ov is the daily amount of water applied by each farmer in point
    k of the space PIiv- DWAov and Nov is the total number of output variables of
    the forecast model. (2) where PIiv,k:ov is the value of PIiv at point k in the
    space PIiv-DWAov and b takes a value close to two (Lin et al., 1996). Hereafter,
    the mean square error values, MSE, of each civ,ov curve are computed and sorted
    in ascending order according to Eq. (3). If there is a fully random relationship
    between the input variable iv and the DWAov, the fuzzy curves is flat and the
    MSEciv,ov is large. Otherwise, MSEciv,ov takes small values when the relationship
    in the space PIiv-DWAov is more significant. (3) According to Lin et al. (1996),
    a fuzzy surface is a space with a two-dimensional fuzzy curve. In this work, a
    fuzzy surface beams, fsiv,ij:ov, defined in Eq. (4) have been used. (4) where
    PIiv:ov and PIij:ov are two potential input variables for output variable ov.
    Then, similarly to Eq. (3), the MSE is computed for each fuzzy surface, . Thus,
    fuzzy curves are initially used to rank all the potential input variables in ascending
    order. The PI variable with the smallest MSEciv,ov is the most important input
    variable for each output variable ov. Fuzzy surfaces are then used to find the
    independent input variables and to eliminate the related input in each step (20%
    eliminated according to Lin et al., 1996). Therefore, in each step new fuzzy surfaces
    are computed and 20% of the potential input variable with the largest is eliminated.
    3.2. Coactive neuro-fuzzy inference system (CANFIS) A Coactive neuro-fuzzy inference
    system (CANFIS) is an extension of an adaptative network fuzzy inference system
    (ANFIS) (Jang et al., 1997) which integrates fuzzy inference systems (FISs) and
    artificial neural networks (ANNs) linked to a MIMO system, in the same methodology.
    CANFIS model can create different regions specialized in specific tasks such as
    different amount of water applied in different tariff period. FIS recreates the
    human thinking by a nonlinear relationship between inputs and outputs based on
    a set of “IF-THEN” rules. With the aim of making understandable the input variable
    to the rule set, the input variables are converted into linguistic variables by
    membership functions (MFs). Therefore, building a FIS consist of determining the
    MFs for each input variables as well as the rule set. The rule set and MFs form
    the knowledge base of the FIS. On the other hand, the main drawback to obtain
    an optimal FIS is the lack of systematic procedures to determine its knowledge
    base. However, artificial neural networks can learn their structure from the input-output
    sets. Thus, in this work, under MIMO framework, a CANFIS model resulting from
    the combination of an ANN and a FIS was created to define the MF parameters. CANFIS
    can also find the rule base through the ANN learning ability to set the relationship
    between input and output. The typical structure of a CANFIS is made up by five
    layers (Fig. 3 where square nodes are adaptive nodes and circles nodes are fixed
    nodes) and their functions are described as follows: Download : Download high-res
    image (349KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. CANFIS structure with
    three inputs and two outputs. The first layer (Layer 1) which is known as fuzzification
    layer uses the MFs to computes the outputs Outnl (n and l are the node and layer
    indexes, respectively). Each node n of this layer is a square node with a node
    function which is shown in Eq. (5) and 6. Each Outn,il corresponds to the n-th
    linguistic term of the i-th input variable (e.g. the value of the variable evapotranspiration
    is 9.5 mm and it is turned into the linguistic term the evapotranspiration is
    HIGH) (5) Unlike previous works, in this work, the optimal typology of each MF
    will be determined by a GA. The different MF typologies considered during the
    optimization process will be described in section 2.4. Every node in Layer 2 is
    a circle node labelled Π, which multiplies all the incoming signals (coming from
    Layer 1) and sends the product out to the next. This layer is known as firing
    strength, it contains the rule nodes, and it computes the activation value of
    each fuzzy rule, wr, as Eq. (6): , for all the term nodes m connected to the r-th
    rule node. (6) r = 1, …, Nrules where Ninput is the total number of inputs and
    Nrules is the total number of rules. The third layer computes the rational firing
    strength of each nodes which is represented as circle node and labelled N. Thus,
    for convenience, outputs of this layer are called normalized firing strengths
    and they are computed according to the following equation: (7) ̅ The defuzzification
    phase is carried out by Layer 4 (consequence parameters). Thus, the output of
    each node is the output of each r-th fuzzy rule that influences the ov-th model
    output Eq. (8). (8) where , , …, , are the consequent parameters of the CANFIS
    system that represent the contribution of the r-th rule to the ov-th output. Finally,
    in Layer 5 is represented as fixed node and labelled as ∑. In this layer, each
    ov-th model output is computed as the algebraic sum of the ov-th node’s inputs
    Eq. (9). (9) Due to the complexity of the developed model and its computational
    efficiency, a first-order Takagi-Sugeno type of FIS was selected (Takagi and Sugeno,
    1985), in this work. While, the antecedent part (IF) is always fuzzy, the consequent
    part (THEN) is a crisp linear function of an antecedent variable. Thus, three
    examples of typical first-order Takagi-Sugeno FIS rules are: Rule 1.1: IF Inp1
    is A1 and Inp2 is B1 and Inp3 is C1 THEN f1,1 = a1,11 Inp1 + a2,11 Inp2 + a3,11
    Inp3 + a0,11. Rule 1.2: IF Inp1 is A1 and Inp2 is B1 and Inp3 is C1 THEN f1,2
    = a1,12 Inp1 + a2,12 Inp2 + a3,12 Inp3 + a0,12. Rule 2.1: IF Inp1 is A2 and Inp2
    is B2 and Inp3 is C2 THEN f2,1 = a1,21 Inp1 + a2,21 Inp2 + a3,21 Inp3 + a0,21.
    Both the total number of rules and consequent parameters (a1,11, a2,11, …, a0,21)
    will be automatically determined by the ANN during the training process of the
    CANFIS model. In conventional ANNs, a simple back-propagation algorithm is usually
    used to train and adjust the weights which connects the neurons of different layers.
    In CAFIS structure, the parameters of the premises and consequents play the role
    of weights. The effectiveness of the developed FIS depends on these parameters.
    Thus, with the aim to improve the training process, Recursive Least Squares Estimation
    (RLSE) (Haykin, 2002) was used in this work as training algorithm of the CANFIS
    model. RLSE is an adaptive filter algorithm that recursively finds the coefficients
    ( , , …, , ) that minimize a weighted linear least squares cost function relating
    to the model input. Although, this algorithm is computationally complex (its computational
    development has been implemented for this work), it has also extremely faster
    convergence than other training algorithm (Lewis and Hwang, 1990). 3.3. Coactive
    neuro-genetic fuzzy inference system (CANGENFIS) The rule base and the MF parameters
    which defines the MF’s shape is determined by an ANN in the CANFIS model. However,
    before defining the MF parameters, the number of MFs which defines each discourse
    universe of each input variable as well as the MF types that characterizes every
    linguistic label must be defined. CANFIS model is not able to automatically determine
    these essential variables for FIS and hence in most previous works are determined
    by trial and error without an optimization criterion. Thus, with the aim to optimize
    automatically both MFs number and the MF types, an hybrid model (CANGENFIS) which
    combines a CANFIS model and the multiobjective GA NSGA-II (Deb et al., 2002),
    has been developed in this work. Furthermore, two essential parameters must be
    considered in the training process of the CANFIS model: forgetting factor, λ,
    which reduces the influence of old data in the determination of the synaptic weights
    of the CANFIS model (Haykin, 2002) and the learning rate, lr, which defines the
    updating rate of the MFs parameters (Hagan et al., 1996). Although, these parameters
    are highly sensitive in the accuracy of the forecasted model, standard values
    of these parameters are usually considered by most of the previous works, independently
    of the problem nature. In this work, these parameters are also optimized by the
    CANGENFIS model. CANGENFIS model optimizes their decision variables (MFs number,
    MF types, λ and lr) based on two objective functions, OF1 and OF2. OF1 maximizes
    the average of the determination coefficient of the model outputs (irrigation
    depth in each tariff periods) for the testing dataset of the CANGENFIS model.
    OF2 minimizes the average and deviation of the standard error prediction (SEP)
    (Ventura et al., 1995) of the CANGENFIS. Standard deviation was considered to
    avoid the tendency to improve some specific outputs of the CANGENFIS model (e.g.,
    forecasting of the irrigation depth applied in P6). Fig. 4 shows the flow chart
    of the generation and optimization the CANGENFIS model. Initially, an initial
    population of nPop size is randomly generated. Each chromosome (Chr) or individual
    of the initial population is made up of nDec decision variables or genes that
    represent each hyperparameter of the CANGENFIS model to be optimized. In this
    work, the chromosome size is variable and depends on the number of inputs (nInp)
    to the forecasting model. Table 1 shows the decision variable (genes) considered
    in this work for nInp inputs in CANGENFIS model, as well as the value range that
    everyone can take during the optimization process. The first nInp genes determine
    the division of the discourse universe of each input variable of the predictive
    model. The next nInp genes define the type of the membership function of each
    input variable which transform the crisp input values into fuzzy input values
    and represent the activation function of the neurones of the first layer of CANGENFIS
    model. Learning rate and forgetting factor are represented by the last two genes,
    respectively. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download full-size

    process of the CANGENFIS model. a nInput: number of the input variables of the
    CANGENFIS model. Once the initial population is created (where the first nInp*2
    genes of each chromosome chr define the architecture of the chr model and the
    two last genes defines the complete chr model (architecture + learning way)),
    each individual of this population is trained and the knowledge base each forecasted
    model is obtained. After that, each of these trained models are tested and the
    objective function OF1 and OF2 are computed. Then, it is necessary to sort the
    initial population according to its aptitude, i.e., its forecast capacity (objective
    functions). The best nPop/2 individuals are then selected as the best individual
    of the initial population. In the remaining stages, the nPop/2 individuals are
    modified (crossover and mutation), and a new population of nPop individuals is
    generated. The process was repeated for several generations (nGEN). Finally, the
    set of nPop optimal individuals (optimal CANGENFIS models) obtained in the last
    generation defines the Pareto front. The computational cost, mainly in computational
    time and memory, that the training process of each individual in each population
    required is hugely high. Thus, the number of epochs during the training phase
    of each forecast model must be limited. Consequently, at the end of the optimization
    process, the best models in terms of hyperparameters is obtained. However, the
    synaptic weights of the neural network (i.e. the knowledge base) are not yet optimized
    as it has not had enough time (enough training epochs) to adjust them. Hence,
    once the optimal models have been defined on the Pareto Front, they must be retrained
    without restriction of training epochs, obtaining the optimal knowledge base of
    the model. 4. Results and discussion The methodology developed was applied to
    CZID during the 2015, 2016 and 2017 irrigation seasons to forecast one-day ahead
    the distribution in energy tariff periods of the irrigation depths applied at
    farm level by each farmer in the WUA. The complete dataset of irrigation depths
    applied contained a total of 77794 measures. Due to the differences of the irrigation
    practices for the main three crops and their impact on the applied irrigation
    depths (González Perea et al., 2018), the full dataset was classified according
    to the three main crops (rice, maize and tomato). Each of these datasets were
    randomly divided into two subsets: training dataset (80%) and testing dataset
    (20%). The hyperparameters of the forecasting models were optimized by the multiobjective
    NSGA-II genetic algorithm. The number of individuals that must make up the initial
    population is related to the number and range of each gene. Thus, the random initial
    population (random CANGENFIS models) consisted of 100 individuals or chromosomes
    (nPop=100) for each one of the main crops. The number of generations depends on
    the stabilization time of each objective function. This stabilization is related
    to each problem and should not be pre-set, allowing the genetic algorithm to achieve
    its own stabilization. Consequently, the initial population was evolved for 300,
    40 and 70 generations (nGen = 300, 40 and 70) for rice, maize and tomato, respectively
    where the values of OF1 and OF2 were stabilized. The probabilities for mutation
    and crossover were set to 10% and 90%, respectively. 4.1. Model inputs The most
    important inputs for CANGENFIS model were selected from a set of 21 potential
    inputs following the methodology described in section 2.2. Table 2 shows the potential
    inputs evaluated and Table 3 shows the most important inputs selected. After applying
    the methodology of section 2.2., the most representative inputs and therefore
    the input variables of CANGENFIS model were number of hours of P1, P2 and P6 in
    the day to forecast, weekday, applied irrigation depth (mm) and day of the year
    (DOI). The applied irrigation depth of the day to be forecasted is an essential
    input for the model. When these models are working in real time (in a WUA), this
    input can be also obtained in real time using the previous model developed by
    González Perea et al. (2018). Table 2. Potential inputs evaluated for CANGENFIS

    forecast the daily irrigation scheduling. These inputs highlight that the distribution
    in tariff period of the daily irrigation depth applied depends almost exclusively
    on hourly energy price of the tariff (Fig. 2). In other words, the distribution
    by tariff periods of the irrigation water applied depends more on the price of
    each tariff period than on the particularities or cultural habits of each farmer.
    Therefore, only information about the two expensive (P1 and P2) and the cheapest
    (P6) tariff periods (MI1, MI2 and MI3, respectively) as well as the total amount
    of the irrigation water and the day of year and week (MI4 and MI6) is required.
    4.2. Pareto front of the optimization process by GA The modified Genetic algorithm
    NSGA-II optimized the objective functions, maximizing OF1 and minimizing OF2.
    The random initial population of 100 chromosomes or individuals evolved over 300,
    40 and 70 generations for rice, maize and tomato, respectively. Each individual
    consisted of 14 genes (2∙nInput + lr +λ) because the number of input variables
    (nInput) was 6. Fig. 5 shows the Pareto fronts obtained in the last generation
    for rice (star mark), maize (cross mark) and tomato (square mark). This figure
    shows that the three crops are clearly different, obtaining the tomato model the
    best values of OF1 and OF2 (ranging from 0.647 to 0.666 and from 0.198 to 0.204
    respectively). The OF1 and OF2 values ranged from 0.512 to 0.527 and from 0.254
    to 0.26, respectively for the forecasting models developed for rice. Maize models
    obtained the widest range of values, their objective functions ranged from 0.551
    to 0.61 for OF1 and from 0.254 to 0.288 for OF2. The three pareto fronts show
    that both objective functions are clearly in conflict. Consequently, as the representativeness
    of the predictive models represented by OF1, the accuracy of the forecasting models
    represented by OF2 decreased. This sensitivity of the models between accuracy
    and representativeness is much more pronounced in the models developed for maize
    crops as the slope of this pareto front is steeper than the other two. Download

    Pareto fronts and best individuals (Ir, Im, It) for rice, maize and tomato, respectively.
    Both the larger range of the values of the objective functions and the slope of
    the pareto front for the maize crop is relate to the number of generations during
    the optimization process. The maize model needed the lower number of generations
    to stabilize their objective functions. The methodology developed considered the
    effect of the random initial population over the evolution of the optimization
    process and a clock dynamic seed was programmed to avoid this effect in the evolution
    of the population. Therefore, the differences of the nGen value in the three crops
    are related to the nature of the problem, i.e. the differences in irrigation water
    management between crops, and not to an effect associated with random initiation
    of the initial population. Consequently, the maize model was easier to obtain
    than the other two crops. In addition, as reported by González Perea et al. (2018),
    the irrigation water management in this crop is easier to reproduce and better
    results can be obtained than in the other two crops. Due to the irrigation method
    (flood irrigation), rice is the crop that needed the most nGen value to stabilise
    their objective functions and the one with the worst values of accuracy and representativeness.
    This will be discussed below where the best model for each crop is analysed. The
    architecture and the other hyperparameters of each model are defined by the values
    of each gene of each individual. The generalization ability of a model (capacity
    to reproduce previously unobserved events as in the test set) depends on these
    genes. The pareto fronts of rice and tomato did not show variation of the objective
    function values. This indicates that the number of training epochs was insufficient
    and these models did not have enough time to find the best values of their synaptic
    weights. Consequently, the values of the objective functions were insensitive
    to the different hyperparameters (genes) of each individual (each model). In order
    words, in rice and tomato’s pareto fronts, the effect of the number of training
    epochs is more restrictive than the network architecture. However, the optimization
    process of the genetic algorithm does ensure that these individuals were the best
    (w.r.t the others analysed during the optimization process) and the fastest to
    train, even if further refinement of their synaptic weights is necessary. Considering
    the values of each objective function, one individual per crop has been selected
    as the best one. Thus, Fig. 4 shows the best individual (the best forecasting
    model) from rice crop (Ir), maize crop (Im) and tomato crop (It). These individuals
    will be analysed in the next Section. 4.3. Optimal CANGENFIS models The best individual
    (CANGENFIS models) for each crop type in each pareto front was selected. Thus,
    Ir, Im and It represents the best individual for rice, maize and tomato, respectively.
    Table 4 shows the gene values that make up each CANGENFIS model as well as the
    R2 and SEP values of the test set after the refining process without limitations
    of the number of training epochs. The partition of the discourse universe (Number
    of MFs) of each input variable was clearly stablished in 3 except for MI5 in the
    rice model, MI5 and MI6 in the maize model and MI6 in the tomato model. The minimum
    and maximum values that these genes would take ranged from 2 to 5. For no input
    variable in any developed model (Ir, Im and It), these genes corresponding to
    the partitions of their discourse universe tended to their maximum values (these
    genes could range from 2 to 5). Consequently, the range of values for these genes
    during the optimization process was properly established. A tendency towards any
    of the lower or upper limits would indicate the need to modify this range and
    repeat the optimization process of the genetic algorithm. Table 4. Gene values,

    for tomato crop. Table 5 shows the linguistic variables for each one of the partitions
    of the discourse universe of each input variable for the three models assessed.
    In the three models, the number of hours in P1, P2 and P6 (MI1, MI2 and MI3, respectively)
    in the forecasted day were addressed in the same way for farmers who irrigate
    rice, maize or tomato. Thus, the linguistic variables or the reasoning that all
    farmers consider about the distribution of these hours for every day as high (HI),
    medium (M) or low (LO), i.e., the behaviour of each farmer in the WUA in deciding
    how to apply the irrigation depth on a given day is conditioned by whether the
    number of hours available is high, medium or low for the two most expensive tariff
    period (P1 and P2) and the cheapest period (P6). Similarly, for all farmers the
    week is divided into early week (LO), mid-week (M) and late week (HI). It is reasonable
    that the partition of the discourse universe for this variable would have been
    2 (weekend and all other days) since the distribution of the tariff periods is
    conditioned by weekends (Fig. 2). However, the results for this input variable
    (MI4) show that it is also important whether the farmer is at the beginning or
    in the middle of the week, possibly conditioned by his activity during the weekend
    and some other socio-cultural practices that should be studied in detail. The
    applied irrigation depth (MI5) was processed differently for rice and maize than
    for tomato. While for rice and maize considers high (H) or low (L) irrigation
    depths, for tomato high (H), medium (M) or low (L) irrigation depths are considered.
    The irrigation season was also divided differently depending on the crop type.
    The decision of the distribution of the daily applied irrigation depth is conditioned
    whether DOI (MI6) is at the beginning, middle or end of the irrigation season
    for rice. However, for maize and tomato, the irrigation season was divided into
    early or late. This way of considering the irrigation season is related to the
    irrigation system of each crop (rice is irrigated by flooding, maize and tomato
    by drip irrigation). I.e., farmers with rice irrigated by flooding and vary their
    irrigation management according to three periods of the irrigation season (beginning,
    middle and end). However, the irrigation management of farmers with tomato and
    maize is affected only by two periods along the irrigation season. This division
    of the irrigation season has not only been caused by the irrigation method but
    also the different phenological stages of each crop. Table 5. Linguistic variables

    model for tomato crop. Table 4 also shows the type of MFs for each input variable
    and each model. The crop cycle, the irrigation system and the daily irrigation
    depths to be applied in rice differ greatly from maize and tomato. Consequently,
    the way in which the knowledge base of the fuzzy inference system of each CANGENFIS
    model transforms the crisp input values into linguistic variables (fuzzy values)
    is very similar for maize and tomato, moving away from the behaviour for rice.
    Apart from the days of the week (MI4), the knowledge base of the rice model is
    totally different from the other two models. The values of learning rate were
    3.89∙10−6, 10−6 and 1.21∙10−3 for Ir, Im and It, respectively. The optimal lr
    value depends on the shape of the N-dimensional error function or cost function
    between the target value and the forecasted values during the training process.
    Thus, in those error functions, where the decreasing error path can clearly be
    found, it is possible to increase the value of lr, speeding up the training process.
    However, the error functions with more tortuous paths to their global minima cannot
    have very high lr value as they would not find this minimum value. Results show
    that the N-dimensional space of the error function of It model is less tortuous
    and easier to find an optimal point than the others due to it achieved the lower
    value of lr. Contrary, Im obtained the lower value of lr. Forgetting factor is
    a hyperparameter of the training function used in this work (RLS): This hyperparameter
    defines the amount of information which is forgotten in each step of the recursive
    training process. The smaller value of λ, the smaller is the contribution of previous
    sample to the covariance matrix of the RLS algorithm. This makes the algorithm
    more sensitive to recent samples, or recent records rather than older ones. Thus,
    the λ values for Ir, Im and It were 0.9855, 1 and 0.9775, respectively. Im model
    is the only that obtain a value of 1 for this hyperparameter. When the forgetting
    factor is 1, it is referred to as the growing window RLS algorithm. The representativeness
    and the accuracy of the three models selected are defined by the R2 and SEP values
    and it also shows in Table 4. The R2 values for Ir, Im and It were 0.70, 0.76
    and 0.85, respectively. The SEP values for these three models were 19.9%, 22.9%
    and 19.5%, respectively. Thus, the It model was the most accurate, with the highest
    representativeness and lower error than 20% for 85% of the forecasting. As González
    Perea et al. (2018) shown in their results, the rice model is the most complex,
    probably because their irrigation system and the amount of data for this crop
    type. Consequently, this work confirms these findings and also obtains the lowest
    representativeness although the accuracy was lower than 20%. However, the three
    models are MIMO, i.e. each model receives the input variable (from MI1 to MI6)
    and return the distribution the applied irrigation depth in a day d for each tariff
    period (from P1 to P6). Thus, the R2 and SEP values are an average of the six
    outputs of each model. Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8 shows the scatterplots between observed
    and estimated irrigation water for the test dataset for the models Ir, Im and
    It, respectively. For Ir, the R2 values ranged from 0.57 for P4 to 0.91 for P6.
    However, the SEP values ranged from 36.58% in P6 to 11.95% in P3. Similarly, the
    R2 values for Im and Ir models ranged from 0.64 in P4 to 0.90 in P6 and from 0.82
    in P2 to 0.94 in P6, respectively. The SEP values for these two models ranged
    from 38.86% in P6 to 12.62% in P5 and from 30.94% in P6 to 12.13% in P5, respectively.
    For the three models, the highest R2 value was obtained in P6 but with the highest
    SEP value. Contrary, the lowest SEP value was found in P5 for Im and It models
    and in P3 for Ir model. Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8 also show that most of the irrigation
    water is logically applied in the cheapest tariff period (P6). Also, larger farms
    with highest irrigation water inputs (higher volume of irrigation water applied)
    trend to maximize the input in the cheapest period. Consequently, the most expensive
    tariff period (P1) hardly exceeds 200 m3 per irrigation event with more than 95%
    of the tomato and maize farms are less than 5 ha and no rice farms are larger
    than 8 ha (only 3 farms between 5 ha and 8 ha). It is important to highlight that
    Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8 show how the second cheapest tariff period (P5) is the
    one that receives less irrigation water when intuitively it should be the second
    period receiving more water. This is a consequence of the distribution of the
    tariff periods (Fig. 2) throughout the irrigation season. While P6 is in one of
    the months of the irrigation season with highest crop water requirements, P5 is
    at the beginning and end of the irrigation season when the theoretical irrigation
    requirements are smaller. These asymmetric distribution of the irrigation water
    between the tariff periods are responsible for the variation in the R2 and SEP
    values between tariff periods. As the architecture of the three models have been
    adapted and optimized for these conditions, as more records are obtained in each
    of these tariff periods, the models will learn and improve their accuracy in an
    autonomous and automatic way. Download : Download high-res image (888KB) Download

    prediction of irrigation events occurrence and applied irrigation depths was previously
    addressed in previous works. However, the optimization of irrigation water use
    and the energy contracting requires also the knowledge of their distribution throughout
    the day. Thus, a new hybrid methodology (CANGENFIS) combining multiple-inputs
    multiple outputs, fuzzy logic, artificial neural networks and multiobjective genetic
    algorithms has been developed to forecast the intra-daily distribution of each
    irrigation event. The new methodology developed in Matlab was applied to a real
    WUA and three models were calibrated for rice, maize and tomato. Although some
    differences between tariff periods were observed, the R2 and SEP values for the
    three models were 0.70, 0.76% and 0.85% and 19.9% 22.9% and 19.5%, respectively.
    CANGENFIS also optimized the inputs of the three forecasting models following
    fuzzy logic techniques. Contrarily to the forecasting of daily water demand, the
    distribution by tariff periods did not depend on any agroclimatic variables. These
    findings highlight that the hourly distribution of the daily irrigation events
    depend almost exclusively on tariff periods according to their price. Finally,
    these models provide the amount of water that each farmer of the WUA is going
    to apply in each energy tariff period one day ahead. The aggregation of this information
    for the total number of farmers in the WUA provides the total amount of water
    one day in advance but discriminated by energy tariff period. In addition, the
    farms are geopositioned so managers will know in advance which pipes can be overloaded.
    Thus, with these models, the manager have an overview about the circulating flows
    in the network the day after but also the distribution of water demand and therefore
    the power requirements in each tariff period could be estimated. This information
    can be very valuable for the optimum contracting of the electricity tariff with
    the supplying company. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that

    decisionsIrrigation optimizationMeasurement uncertainty 1. Introduction Increases
    in irrigation water demand driven by climate change and population growth are
    expected to exacerbate water scarcity and conflict over limited freshwater resources
    in many regions around the world (e.g., Molden, 2013). To manage these challenges,
    there is a need to identify ways to improve the productivity of agricultural water
    use – commonly referred to as generating “more crop per drop”. One key pathway
    for raising agricultural water productivity is through improvements to irrigation
    scheduling, which enables farmers to target limited water supply to when the crop
    is most sensitive to water stress and thus maximize yield returns to limited freshwater
    inputs (Morison et al., 2008; Evans and Sadler, 2008; Adeyemi et al., 2017). The
    majority of the developments in irrigation scheduling come under the label of
    precision irrigation, which broadly encapsulates solutions that aim to vary the
    temporal and spatial distribution of irrigation to match crop-water demands (Adeyemi
    et al., 2017). Associated technologies to support implementation of these strategies
    include sensors to monitor soil-water content or crop growth (Jones, 2004; Dobriyal
    et al., 2012; Ihuoma and Madramootoo, 2017), field mapping that highlights heterogeneities
    in soil texture and other properties (Daccache et al., 2015), and decision-support
    tools that aid in the timing of irrigation events (McCarthy et al., 2010). The
    common goal that links these methods is the precise monitoring and management
    of soil-water content and crop-water needs. Currently, the uptake of precision-irrigation
    methods and technologies remains low, with most farmers even in developed agricultural
    systems such as the United States relying on proxies, such as the visual condition
    of the crop and soil, as well as simple water-balance calculations to determine
    when to irrigate (Fig. 1). Much like soil-moisture sensors, these traditional
    techniques aim to monitor and manage soil-water content in the crop root zone,
    and hence, the amount of water available for crop uptake. The difference between
    farmers with and without soil-moisture sensors, therefore, is the accuracy of
    this monitoring along with the associated rules and heuristics by which this information
    is used to make irrigation decisions. Download : Download high-res image (247KB)

    irrigate in the United States to schedule their irrigation events. Data is from
    the four most recent 5-yearly (2003–2018) Irrigation and Water Management Surveys
    conducted across the United States by the Department of Agriculture (USDA-NASS,
    2018). Sources of uncertainty in soil-moisture monitoring and estimation are similar
    for both traditional and precision-irrigation methods. One important source of
    uncertainty is heterogeneity in soil textural composition, which affects estimates
    of current and potential soil-water storage both laterally and vertically within
    a field (Nielsen et al., 1973; Brocca et al., 2007; Feki et al., 2018). Heterogeneity
    in soil texture means that point measurements of soil-moisture status are only
    valid for a specific location and depth, potentially leading to errors when this
    information is used in water-balance calculations across large areas (e.g., field
    or farm). Additional uncertainty in soil-moisture estimation also results from
    errors in climatological (rainfall, evapotranspiration, etc.) and irrigation data
    characterising inflows and outflows from soil-water storage. Differences in infiltration
    rates due to differences in soil texture and topography, as well as large distances
    between the measurement instruments and cropping area, are major contributors
    to this uncertainty (Chaubey et al., 1999). Moreover, the accuracy of evapotranspiration
    estimates are greatly affected by the amount of site-specific information used
    in its calculation (Sentelhas et al., 2010), including in the calculations of
    reference and actual evapotranspiration (Allen et al., 1998). The result of either
    soil-texture or water-flux errors is that a farmer may miscalculate the amount
    of water stored in the soil on any given day, leading to inaccurate estimates
    of when or how much irrigation should be applied. As a result, a farmer may apply
    insufficient or excessive amounts of water, with resulting negative impacts on
    crop yields and/or farm profits. Precision-irrigation research has focused on
    developing tools and techniques to reduce the magnitude of soil-moisture error
    (Soulis et al., 2015; Adeyemi et al., 2017; Kukal et al., 2019). Alongside this,
    when farmers invest in more accurate soil-water monitoring technology such as
    sensors or weather stations, they will often also receive advice about the best
    trigger levels and irrigation management strategies to maximize yields, profits
    or water efficiency (UNL, 2019). The relative contribution of improved scheduling
    rules versus improved soil-moisture information to farmers’ irrigation water use
    practices has not been explicitly studied. However, this distinction has important
    implications for farmers and water managers seeking to understand which interventions
    and technologies will be most effective for delivering desired improvements in
    the productivity and value of irrigation water use. In response to these gaps
    in the literature, this article presents a framework for studying the impact of
    varying levels of soil-moisture uncertainty on irrigation water use decisions
    and farm profits. The framework consists of an optimization module to generate
    irrigation strategies, a crop-growth model to assess impacts of these irrigation
    strategies on water use and crop yields, and a mechanism for applying variable
    soil-moisture measurement errors within model simulations. We apply this framework
    a case study of irrigated maize production in Nebraska, United States, using the
    AquaCrop-OS crop-water model to assess how assumptions about irrigation management
    practices, and the accuracy of soil moisture information on which these strategies
    are implemented, affect irrigation decisions and farm profits. Our findings provide
    insights on the response of irrigation water productivity to soil-moisture measurement
    uncertainty, showing that the impact of inaccurate soil-water monitoring on crop
    yields, profits and water use efficiency is low relative to the impacts of using
    sub-optimal irrigation scheduling heuristics. We discuss the implications of these
    results for local policy makers, industry and producers, and provide recommendations
    for how our results can be used to make improvements in agricultural water productivity
    at field to catchment scales. 2. Methods In this section, we describe our proposed
    framework for modelling farmer irrigation decision-making under varying levels
    of soil-moisture measurement uncertainty, and for assessing the resulting impacts
    of this measurement uncertainty on water use, crop yields and economic returns.
    We first present our generalised assessment framework in three main subsections:
    determination of farmers’ irrigation scheduling rules (Section 2.1), assessment
    of the performance of these strategies under different sources and magnitudes
    of measurement error (Sections 2.2), and the incorporation of a feedback mechanism
    to represent realistic farmer behavior (Section 2.3). We then describe the specific
    case study application of this framework, including details of model parameters
    and choice of crop-growth model, optimization algorithm, crop type, and location
    used as an illustrative example in this study (Section 2.4). 2.1. Determining
    farmers’ rules in scheduling irrigation Despite a large variation in the methods
    used by farmers to schedule irrigation (Fig. 1), the goal of most methods is to
    maintain soil-moisture levels above a pre-specified threshold chosen to meet crop-water
    needs and balance trade-offs between costs and yield benefits of water use. In
    line with these assumptions and past research (Linker et al., 2016; Foster and
    Brozović, 2018; Linker et al., 2018), we assume that a farmer''s irrigation decision-making
    can be characterized by the choice of four soil-moisture thresholds throughout
    the growing season, one for each major crop-growth stage (emergence, early-season
    canopy development, mid-season crop growth and yield formation, late-season canopy
    senescence). These four soil-moisture thresholds determine the allowable root-zone
    soil-moisture content (expressed as a percentage of total soil-water holding capacity)
    which water contents must fall below before irrigation is triggered. At the point
    irrigation is triggered, we assume that water will be applied to refill the soil
    profile back to field capacity, subject to a maximum application rate which is
    determined by the type of irrigation system and water source used by a farmer.
    The choice of soil-moisture thresholds – which we refer to as the irrigation strategy
    – can have a major impact on water use and crop growth. Setting these thresholds
    too high (i.e., irrigating at low levels of soil-moisture depletion) will result
    in over-irrigation, whereas setting thresholds too low (i.e., irrigating only
    at high levels of soil-moisture depletion) will result in under-irrigation and
    thus production losses. In line with past research showing that farmers’ input
    use decisions may be influenced by their risk preferences (Abdulkadri, 2003; Menapace
    et al., 2013), we define the optimal set of soil-moisture thresholds as those
    that maximize a farmers’ certainty equivalent (CE). The CE is defined as the amount
    of economic return that would have to be guaranteed in order for an individual
    to be indifferent towards a higher but less certain return. The CE has been used
    in previous agro-economic models of farmer input use decision-making (Lehmann
    et al., 2013; Foster et al., 2014). In the context of irrigation optimization,
    the CE for a given irrigation strategy s is defined as (1) where strategy s =
    [t1,t2,t3,t4] is made up of four soil-moisture thresholds; the expected profits
    E[P(s)] and variance Var[P(s)] will be calculated over a given set of seasons
    that characterise farmers’ expectations of potential inter-annual weather variability;
    and r is the risk coefficient representing farmer''s risk preferences. If a risk-averse
    farmer (r > 0) wishes to increase the CE, they could either increase the expected
    (average) profits or reduce the year-to-year variability in profits (Eq. (1)).
    A risk-neutral farmer (r = 0) will instead only aim to maximise expected (average)
    seasonal profits. For a given irrigation strategy s, the seasonal profit P(s)
    is calculated as (2) where M is a constant crop market price [$ per tonne], Y(s)
    is crop yield [tonne per ha], C is a constant irrigation cost [$ per ha-mm], I(s)
    is total seasonal irrigation applied [ha-mm], and F is fixed production costs
    [$ per ha]. Finding a set of soil-moisture thresholds that maximize CE is a difficult
    task due to large number of potential soil-moisture threshold combinations and
    interdependencies between the choice of threshold for each individual growth stage.
    For example, irrigating more in the early part of the season will affect the optimal
    irrigation threshold for the rest of the season. As a result, the search space
    of possible threshold combinations and their resulting outcomes is non-linear
    and discontinuous. For these types of search spaces, swarm intelligence algorithms
    have become popular in recent decades (Mavrovouniotis et al., 2017) and have been
    used previously for the purpose of optimal irrigation planning and management
    (De Paly and Zell, 2009; Noory et al., 2012). These algorithms operate on the
    principle that a group of agents scattered across the search space can search
    locally for solutions while communicating with the other agents. This combination
    ensures that the solutions found are close to the global optimum. For this analysis,
    we determine farmers’ optimal (i.e., CE-maximizing) soil-moisture thresholds using
    the particle-swarm optimization algorithm (Eberhart and Kennedy, 1995; Freitas
    et al., 2020), although in principle any optimization method could be used within
    our framework. This method starts by initializing a population of particles (i.e.,
    possible soil-moisture threshold combinations) across the search space. Each particle
    is then evaluated and updated using the best combinations found by both the particle
    and the population as a whole. This evaluate–update process repeats until a stopping
    criteria has been met (Mathworks, n.d.). Particle-swarm optimization has been
    successfully applied in a diverse array of research areas, such as control problems,
    biomedical research, robotics and distribution networks (Poli, 2008). 2.2. Quantifying
    the impact of uncertainty on irrigation decisions and profits As shown in Fig.
    1 and discussed earlier, many farmers do not measure soil moisture directly using
    sensors. Instead, most rely on proxy measures of soil-water content, such as visual
    inspection of the soil and simplified checkbook-style water-balance models. Each
    of these approaches carry uncertainties and errors in the measurement of soil
    moisture, which may influence the performance of selected irrigation scheduling
    strategies. In this study, we focus on two main sources of error: (1) the specification
    of soil textural characteristics that cause a persistent seasonal bias to water-balance
    estimation and (2) measurements of daily precipitation, irrigation, and evapotranspiration
    fluxes that cause daily unbiased errors in soil-moisture content. Our analysis
    does not consider structural model errors such as simplifications in the water-balance
    equations inherent in traditional soil-moisture monitoring approaches used by
    farmers, and our analysis assumes that the underlying soil-water balance model
    is a ‘perfect’ model of the chosen system. Focusing on these two sources of error
    allows us to examine the effects of measurement uncertainty on farmers’ irrigation
    decision-making. The framework created to study the effect of soil-moisture uncertainty
    consists of two identical crop-model simulations running in parallel. Simulation
    1 represents the farmers’ expectations about soil-moisture conditions, which will
    be impacted by any errors in soil-texture and water-flux measurements. The sources
    of uncertainty considered are errors in soil-texture inputs added at the beginning
    of each season and water-flux inputs added on each day of the simulation. Simulation
    2 represents the true status of soil-moisture conditions based on the actual soil-textural
    properties and water fluxes. Irrigation decisions are determined based on the
    soil-moisture content given by Simulation 1, as well as the farmers'' CE-maximizing
    irrigation strategy that determines the level of soil moisture at which they intend
    to trigger irrigation. Irrigation events estimated in Simulation 1 are then applied
    in Simulation 2 to determine resulting impacts on water use and crop yields. Under
    perfect information (zero errors in soil texture and water flux), the farmers’
    perception of soil-moisture conditions match the true state, and both simulations
    are identical such that the farmer is able to implement perfectly the CE-maximizing
    irrigation strategy. When the magnitudes of soil-texture errors, water-flux errors,
    or both are greater than zero, the difference between the farmer''s expectations
    of soil-moisture conditions and reality diverge. This difference potentially results
    in sub-optimal irrigation scheduling, with negative impacts on crop yields or
    profits. For example, if the farmer triggers irrigation at a lower level of soil-moisture
    than the intended CE-maximizing threshold (i.e., because their estimated soil-moisture
    levels in Simulation 1 over-estimate true soil-moisture levels given in Simulation
    2), then the crop may experience unintended water stress and a reduction in yields.
    Alternatively, if the farmer triggers irrigation at a higher soil-moisture level
    than the intended CE-maximizing threshold (i.e., because their estimated soil-moisture
    levels in Simulation 1 under-estimate true soil moisture levels given in Simulation
    2), then irrigation water may be wasted and profits reduced. Two examples of how
    the added soil-moisture uncertainty causes the two simulations to diverge are
    shown in Fig. 2 (where percentage errors drawn from a normal distribution with
    zero mean and a standard deviation of 30% have been added to the soil-texture
    and daily water-flux inputs in Simulation 1). The soil-texture errors result in
    seasonal biases towards either over or under-estimation of drainage and therefore
    soil-moisture storage, whereas the water-flux error results in random daily errors
    in the farmer''s estimate of the true daily change in water content. When this
    calculated soil-moisture content (Simulation 1) drops below the pre-defined threshold,
    irrigation is triggered. This irrigation depth is applied to both fields regardless
    of whether the true moisture content (Simulation 2) has crossed the intended irrigation
    threshold. Fig. 2a shows an example of irrigation being triggered several days
    after the true water content in Simulation 2 had dropped below the threshold,
    resulting in water stress and yield losses. In the alternative case, irrigation
    may be triggered too early, causing profit losses from excess water application
    and potentially leading to crop damage from temporary waterlogging (Fig. 2b).

    Fig. 2. Soil-moisture content (% total available water) during an example season
    where (a) the farmer is overestimating the water content, (b) the farmer is underestimating
    the water content. A soil-water content of 0% indicates wilting point whereas
    100% indicates field capacity. Irrigation events (blue circles) occur when the
    farmers’ perception of soil-moisture content (blue solid line) drops below the
    irrigation threshold (green dotted line). This irrigation event is applied to
    both simulations regardless of the true soil-moisture content (orange dashed line).
    In Fig. 2b, the added soil-texture and water-flux errors have resulted in an underestimation
    of the true soil-water content, leading to excess irrigation application and economic
    losses. This example adds a 30% standard error (meaning percentage errors are
    drawn from a normal distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation
    of 30%) to the water-flux and soil-texture measurements, which can cause unrealistically
    high measurement errors such as the irrigation depth error on day 70 of Fig. 2a.
    2.3. System feedback When incorporating error in farmers’ estimation of soil-moisture
    content, the potential exists for unrealistic irrigation behavior to occur during
    simulations that may overstate the true effects of measurement error on farmer
    irrigation decision-making, crop yields, and profits in reality. For example,
    the calculated moisture content (Simulation 1) may recommend no irrigation despite
    the true water content (Simulation 2) being sufficiently low that the crop would
    be showing visible signs of water stress (e.g., wilting or early senescence).
    Alternatively, the calculated water content may recommend irrigation despite the
    true soil profile being visibly saturated or water logged. In these instances,
    a farmer would likely adjust their irrigation application in response to these
    clear visual feedbacks from the true field, which would be readily observable
    through day to day crop management activities even if the farmer was no longer
    personally measuring the soil-moisture content in the field. This assumption is
    further supported by the fact that visible inspection of the crop and soil are
    by far the most common information sources when deciding to schedule irrigation
    (Fig. 1). To capture these behavioral feedbacks, an additional rule is added to
    our parallel simulation approach to override the daily irrigation recommendation
    from the farmers’ calculation (Simulation 1). This override occurs if, on the
    previous day, the soil-moisture conditions in the true field (Simulation 2) were
    either (i) low enough to trigger early canopy senescence, which is an indication
    of severe crop water stress, or (ii) higher than the soil''s true field capacity,
    which is indicative of visibly moist soil conditions. In these instances, an irrigation
    event within our assessment framework would be triggered or blocked, respectively.
    The altered irrigation depth is applied to both fields (Simulations 1 and 2),
    and the parallel simulations subsequently continue as described in Section 2.2.
    The added feedbacks have the effect of stopping excessive irrigation in the early
    season, while also preventing unrealistically large water stress in the late season
    (Figure S1). We hypothesize that incorporating these behavioral feedbacks will
    minimize the effects of large measurement errors, leading to less importance being
    placed on the quality of improved soil moisture information – a hypothesis we
    test in subsequent sections as part of our illustrative case study application.
    2.4. Illustrative application To illustrate our modelling framework, we apply
    the methods described in Sections 2.2 and 2.3 to the example of centre-pivot irrigated
    maize production in Nebraska, United States. Maize is the dominant irrigated crop
    type in Nebraska, which has the largest number of irrigated acres by state in
    the United States (USDA-NASS, 2018). Irrigation water is sourced primarily from
    the underlying High Plains Aquifer, and improving productivity of water use is
    a key priority for policymakers to address growing issues of aquifer depletion
    (McGuire, 2017), streamflow depletion (Szilagyi, 2000), and degradation of freshwater
    ecosystems (Palazzo and Brozović, 2014; Perkin et al., 2019). Financial incentives
    to farmers to encourage adoption of soil-moisture sensors are seen as a key mechanism
    to improve water productivity and irrigation efficiencies (CropWatch, 2019b),
    making maize production in Nebraska a logical choice for examining the impact
    of soil-moisture uncertainty on water use and farm profits. As the basis for soil-water
    balance and crop-growth simulations in our illustrative analysis, we use the crop-water
    model AquaCrop-OS (Foster et al., 2017). AquaCrop-OS is an open-source version
    of the original AquaCrop (Raes et al., 2009) developed by the Food and Agriculture
    Organization of the United Nations to simulate crop response to water stress.
    The model has been successfully applied and calibrated for maize production in
    a wide variety of environments (Hsiao et al., 2009; Abedinpour et al., 2012),
    including in our study area in the central United States (Foster et al., 2015)
    and within the United States and globally (Heng et al., 2009; Foster et al., 2015;
    Sandhu and Irmak, 2019). AquaCrop-OS captures the impacts of water stress on multiple
    aspects of crop development (expansion and senescence), transpiration, and yield
    formation through a series of water-stress thresholds and coefficients that have
    been calibrated for maize in our study areas as part of previous studies (Forster
    et al., 2015). These determine the level of soil moisture depletion at which each
    process becomes constrained by water stress, along with how resulting deficiencies
    in crop development or transpiration impact on end-of-season biomass production
    and crop yields. Further details about the simulation of water stress on crop
    growth and yields in AquaCrop are given in Steduto et al. (2009) and Raes et al.
    (2009). The first step in our analysis is to identify CE-maximizing soil-moisture
    thresholds using particle-swarm optimization as described in Section 2.1. Given
    the non-linear and discontinuous nature of the search space of possible thresholds,
    the same optimization procedure did not always produce the same set of thresholds.
    Multiple optimization repetitions were therefore required to capture the full
    distribution of CE-maximizing strategies. The number of repetitions was set to
    50 after observing that the variance between optimal threshold combinations stabilized
    for more repetitions than 50 (Figure S2). Each of these 50 sets of thresholds
    can now be thought of as a separate farmer with their own, slightly different,
    CE-maximizing irrigation strategy. Table 1 shows the top five strategies in terms
    of the resulting 30-year CE. Table 1. Top five soil-moisture threshold strategies
    and their average 30-year CE for the baseline analysis (Risk coefficient r = 0;
    Irrigation cost C = $2 per ha-mm). Each strategy consists of a set of four soil-moisture
    thresholds (for four major growth stages) which specify the allowable level of
    soil-water content below which irrigation is triggered. These strategies were
    found using Particle Swarm Optimization that aimed to maximize CE, where this
    optimization was performed 50 times (resulting in 50 ‘near optimal’ strategies)
    to explore how alternative irrigation strategies that yield very similar economic
    returns (i.e., CE''s) affect the estimated impacts of soil-moisture uncertainty
    in our modelling framework. The top five are shown here for simplicity. Threshold

    of information uncertainty, each CE-maximizing irrigation strategy was then applied
    as described in Sections 2.2 and 2.3. For each of the 50 CE-maximizing irrigation
    strategies, we conducted a 30-year simulation using our framework''s two parallel-model
    approach. The first model, representing the farmer''s expectation of soil-moisture
    status, perturbs soil-texture properties (% sand and clay content) at the start
    of the simulation by a normally distributed percentage error (Figure S3). The
    soil hydraulic properties are then estimated from this soil texture inside AquaCrop
    via pedotransfer functions (Saxton and Rawls, 2006). The true soil texture was
    defined as a silt loam (25% sand, 25% clay), which is among the common soil types
    for maize production in Nebraska (CropWatch, 2018). On each day of the simulation,
    water-flux inputs (rainfall, irrigation, and evapotranspiration) used to simulate
    farmer''s expectations (i.e., Simulation 1) were also perturbed by normally distributed
    percentage errors (Figure S4). The distributions chosen were unbiased (mean =
    0) with standard deviations of increasing magnitude from 0 to 30% for both water-flux
    and soil-texture measurements. In the real world, measurement errors in these
    quantities may be on the lower end of this range, in particular in the context
    of quantities such as irrigation depths in more controlled application systems
    (e.g., centre-pivot or drip). However, we explore variations in errors up to 30%
    to provide an estimate of how measurement errors affect resulting irrigation water
    use and crop yields for a diversity of error levels ranging from perfect information
    (0% error) to very large uncertainty (30% error). Given that the added errors
    were randomly drawn, the process was repeated 1000 times for each combination
    of irrigation strategy, water-flux error, and soil-texture error. This number
    was chosen by finding how many repetitions were required before average CE results
    stabilized (Figure S5). Simulations were conducted over a 30-year (1989–2018)
    period using weather data observed at a monitoring station in Champion, southwest
    Nebraska (High Plains Regional Climate Center, n.d.), where the number of years
    was chosen to capture the range of potential growing weather conditions experienced
    by farmers in the region. For each 30-year simulation, we determine the effects
    of soil-moisture uncertainty by comparing average annual profits and total irrigation
    water use for simulations with and without water-flux and soil-texture errors.
    Simulations consider a constant crop price used in Equation 2 of $180 per tonne
    ($4.57 per bushel) based on a 10-year average of US maize grain prices (USDA,
    2019) and an irrigation cost of $2 per ha-mm ($20.55 per acre-inch) based on typical
    costs associated with pumping and application of water (Water, 2017). Fixed production
    costs were set to $1728 based on typical average non-water production costs for
    centre pivot irrigated maize production in the 2019 Nebraska Crop Budget Report
    (CropWatch, 2019a). These costs include field operation costs including labour,
    materials and services, taxes, etc. for non-irrigation activities, and are not
    likely to change significantly if the irrigation strategy is altered. Baseline
    simulations consider a risk-neutral farmer (i.e., r = 0 in Eq. (1)). To evaluate
    the sensitivity of our results to model parameter choices, we conducted a range
    of sensitivity tests. The first sensitivity analysis was for irrigation cost,
    whereby the same analysis was conducted for two alternative costs of irrigation
    ($1, $2, $3 per ha-mm), as this cost can vary greatly due to differences in water
    source, energy price and tariffs, and labor costs (Wichelns, 2010). Higher irrigation
    costs will amplify the economic impacts of over-irrigation, potentially resulting
    in a corresponding increase in the value a farmer may place on accurate soil-moisture
    information. On the other hand, when irrigation is cheap to apply, there is less
    incentive to conserve water and risk any reductions in yield that may occur due
    to delayed irrigation. In these circumstances, the value of soil-moisture information
    therefore is expected to be lower. Subsequently, we conducted a second sensitivity
    analysis to evaluate the effects of risk-aversion on the value of more accurate
    soil-moisture information to a farmer. Risk-averse farmers were represented by
    varying the risk coefficient in Eq. (1) (r = 0, 2.5, 5) to reflect the fact that
    existing literature shows farmers often exhibit risk-averse behavior (Abdulkadri,
    2003; Menapace et al., 2013). As more weight is placed on reducing the year-to-year
    variance in profits, the optimal strategy should aim to apply more water than
    the risk-neutral case, in order to reduce water stress in the driest years. The
    desire to reduce year-to-year variation should also increase the value the farmer
    places on accurate soil-moisture information, as greater information accuracy
    would be expected to result in lower risks of crop failure all else being equal.

    The effect of soil-moisture uncertainty on water use and profits Each combination
    of water-flux and soil-texture errors (averaged over all strategies and repetitions),
    and their resulting impacts on water use and profits, is shown in Fig. 3 (for
    a risk-neutral farmer and implementing behavioral feedbacks described in Section
    2.2). The responsiveness of modelled outputs is variable depending on the underlying
    source of soil-moisture error, with water use (Fig. 3a) and profits (Fig. 3b)
    showing greater sensitivity to water-flux errors than soil-texture errors. Increasing
    magnitude of soil-moisture errors (from both sources) results in only marginal
    changes in irrigation water use and profits. For example, each contour line in
    Fig. 3a and b represents a 1% increase and 1% decrease, respectively, from the
    case of perfect information. These results indicate that a nearly 30% assumed
    standard error in the water-flux and soil-texture inputs causes only around a
    4% increase in total water use (Fig. 3a) and 14% decline in profits (Fig. 3b).
    Figure S6 shows that almost no change in crop yields is observed, even for extreme
    levels of error of up to 30%, indicating that the primary driver of profit losses
    is through this excess water application through inefficient irrigation scheduling
    as a result of soil-moisture estimation uncertainty. The results presented in
    this section and following sections are averaged over the 50 CE-maximizing strategies,
    as well as 1000 repetitions of the 30-year case study simulation. Thus, the impact
    of the stochastic measurement uncertainty may deviate from the overall trend in
    any given simulation (Figure S7). Download : Download high-res image (262KB) Download

    errors on (a) total irrigation [ha-mm], and (b) profits [$ ha–1]. The percentage
    errors are drawn from a normal distribution of mean = 0 and standard deviation
    increasing from 0–30%. The contour lines represent a 1% change from the case of
    zero added error. The effect of added uncertainty in water-flux and soil-texture
    measurements is almost no change in yields despite marginal increases in irrigation.
    This contrast implies irrigation is applied sub-optimally, leading to profit losses
    from wasted water application. (Risk coefficient r = 0; Irrigation cost C = $2
    per ha-mm.) Fig. 4 also illustrates the effect of adding the additional behavioral-feedback
    mechanisms described in Section 2.3. Behavioral feedbacks were designed to prevent
    unrealistic irrigation behavior caused by measurement error, effectively ensuring
    that irrigation events were triggered when true soil-moisture levels were sufficiently
    low to cause visible plant stress and were not triggered when true soil-moisture
    levels were sufficiently high to cause visible soil saturation. Introducing the
    feedback mechanism leads to greater increases in water use as soil-moisture errors
    become larger (Fig. 4a), but results in a reduction in the economic losses caused
    by larger measurement errors (Fig. 4b). This result reflects the fact that the
    behavioral feedbacks most commonly act to trigger irrigation when the farmer has
    underestimated soil-moisture depletion, leading to more frequent irrigation events
    but also reducing the duration and severity of crop water stress relative to simulations
    without behavioral feedbacks. In contrast, triggering of behavioral feedbacks
    for excess irrigation is relatively uncommon as the whole root-zone would have
    to have exceeded field capacity. Download : Download high-res image (236KB) Download

    of Figs. 3a, 3b). The shaded area represents the 95% confidence interval over
    all 50 strategies. The comparison with and without the feedback mechanism is also
    presented to show the effect that simple farmer behavior adjustments can have
    on the value of soil-moisture information. (Risk coefficient r = 0; Irrigation
    cost C = $2 per ha-mm.) Introducing behavioral feedbacks also results in small
    changes in water use and reductions in CE and profits even under perfect information
    (i.e., for errors equal to 0). Because CE-maximizing strategies are designed under
    the assumption of perfect information without consideration of additional behavioral
    feedbacks, introducing these feedbacks leads to permutations to these CE-maximizing
    strategies that trigger slight adjustments to final simulated outputs at the end
    of each season. These changes, however, are small, representing as little as 0.5%
    and 0.3% changes in average annual water use and CE, respectively. 3.2. Sensitivity
    analysis To assess the impact of our choice of risk preference and irrigation
    cost (r = 0 and C = $2 per ha-mm) on the estimated impacts of soil-moisture uncertainty
    on irrigation water use and farm profits, we repeat the analyses described in
    Sections 2.2 and 2.3 for combinations of three alternative risk coefficients (0,
    2.5, 5) and irrigation costs ($1, 2, 3 per ha-mm). In the absence of soil-moisture
    uncertainty, higher irrigation costs lead to reductions in average water use as
    expected (Fig. 5a). The magnitude of this reduction is also much larger than increases
    resulting from risk preferences or soil-moisture uncertainty (Fig. 5b), suggesting
    that irrigation-water costs or prices have a larger effect on water-use decisions
    than risk aversion or uncertainties in underlying data used to determine soil-moisture
    conditions for irrigation scheduling. Download : Download high-res image (583KB)

    (a). The effect of increasing water-flux and soil-texture error on (b) seasonal
    irrigation and (c) certainty equivalent for varying irrigation costs and risk
    coefficients when the magnitude of both sources are equal. This relationship between
    irrigation cost and water use is commonly analysed in the literature via the price
    elasticity of water use (also known as the price elasticity of demand), which
    is the percentage change in a farmer''s irrigation water use for a percentage
    change in irrigation cost. Previous studies have placed the price elasticity within
    a wide range 0.001–1.97 (Scheierling et al., 2006). Calculating the price elasticity
    of water use using our results in the absence of soil-moisture uncertainty yields
    a mean price elasticity of 0.23 ± 0.12 (calculated from the results presented
    in Fig. 5a). This result is comparable with past estimates that consider only
    water-use adjustments on the intensive margin (i.e., estimates that consider changes
    to per-area irrigation water use, but not changes in demand caused by adjustments
    to irrigated area or crop type). Similarly, calculating the percentage change
    in water use for a percentage change in soil-moisture error or risk coefficient
    yielded an information elasticity of 0.015 ± 0.016 and a risk elasticity of 0.012
    ± 0.016. This comparison further reinforces our finding that water use appears
    to be much more sensitive to changes in cost than either risk preference or soil-moisture
    error. The choice of irrigation cost and risk preference can also alter how soil-moisture
    uncertainty affects water use and profits in the case of farmers with an imperfect
    ability to estimate or monitor soil-moisture conditions. High irrigation costs
    will reduce the optimal amount of irrigation used over the season, meaning that
    farmers have less scope to mis-time events while still avoiding damaging water
    stress or that farmers must apply extra irrigation at significant economic cost.
    A high degree of risk aversion (represented by a larger positive value of r) will
    similarly penalize large year-to-year fluctuations in profit, meaning the negative
    economic impacts of soil-moisture errors (and hence the value of improved information
    accuracy) may be enhanced due to the increase in the variance in annual profits.
    When both high risk preferences (r = 5) and high irrigation costs (C = $3 per
    ha-mm) are combined, the economic losses resulting from uncertainty are almost
    doubled compared to the case presented throughout this analysis (r = 0 and C =
    $2 per ha-mm) (Fig. 5c). 3.3. Comparing the impacts of uncertainty with choice
    of irrigation strategy Our analysis in the previous sections has shown that a
    30% water-flux and soil-texture error results in only a 4% increase in water use
    (Fig. 3a), whereas the standard deviation in water use between 50 different ‘optimal’
    strategies was 5.7% (Fig. 4a). This comparison indicates that the choice of irrigation
    management strategy (represented in this study by a combination of four soil-moisture
    thresholds) could be more important in determining irrigation-water use than uncertainty
    in underlying soil-moisture estimates used to implement irrigation strategies.
    Since all strategies evaluated so far can be considered ‘optimal’, one would expect
    a ‘sub-optimal’ strategy to have a significantly different level of water use
    and profits if that were the case. To explore further the impacts of the choice
    of irrigation strategy relative to the effects of soil-moisture uncertainty, we
    repeated the analysis for our case study, allowing the farmer to select only a
    single optimized soil-moisture threshold throughout each season (e.g., the green
    line in Fig. 2 would be one straight line) as opposed to a set of four optimized
    thresholds disaggregated by growth stage. The top five single-threshold strategies
    in terms of 30-year average CE are displayed in Table 3. Single thresholds have
    been applied in past studies of farmer irrigation decision-making and is often
    recommended by extension and agronomic advisories (Blonquist et al., 2006; Gutierrez
    et al., 2014). However, since they do not not consider the variable sensitivity
    of crop growth to water deficits over the growing season, they are sub-optimal
    compared to the four-threshold strategies used in the baseline analysis. Table

    choice of irrigation management strategy (i.e., one versus four soil-moisture
    thresholds per season) has a much larger impact on water use (Fig. 6a) and profits
    (Fig. 6b) than added soil-moisture uncertainty. Under perfect information (zero
    added soil-moisture error), the sub-optimal strategy (one irrigation threshold)
    uses 35 ha-mm more water on average and reduces profits by $117 ha–1 compared
    with the optimal strategy (four irrigation thresholds). Conversely, adding 30%
    water-flux and soil-texture errors to the optimal strategy results in only 11
    ha-mm more water being applied and a $27 ha–1 reduction in profits, meaning that
    the accuracy of soil-moisture information appears to be much less important to
    the water-use efficiency and profitability of irrigation decision-making than
    the choices of heuristics for irrigation scheduling. Indeed, Fig. 6 suggests that
    adding a 30% standard error onto an optimal strategy can still outperform a sub-optimal
    strategy with perfect information. Download : Download high-res image (232KB)

    profits under increased uncertainty for two different types of irrigation strategy.
    The first strategy consists of four irrigation thresholds corresponding to the
    allowable level of soil moisture during four major growth stages. The second strategy
    is for one constant irrigation threshold that does not vary over the season. Particle-swarm
    optimization found both strategies to be CE maximizing (Risk coefficient r = 0;
    Irrigation cost C = $2 per ha-mm.). 4. Discussion Our findings demonstrate that
    the response of irrigation-water use and farm profits to soil-moisture uncertainty
    is non-linear, with soil-moisture uncertainty leading to reductions in both efficiency
    of irrigation water use and farm profits. However, we show that, with the addition
    of realistic farmer behavior (in the form of our feedback mechanism), the magnitude
    of these changes is much smaller than commonly assumed in policy and practice
    (Soulis et al., 2015; Adeyemi et al., 2017). In fact, our analysis suggests that
    near-optimal irrigation decisions can be made without perfect soil-moisture information.
    In contrast, we find the choice of irrigation management strategy – in this study
    given by a set of four soil-moisture thresholds – was a far more important determinant
    of water efficiency, productivity, and profitability than the accuracy of soil-moisture
    information used to implement a selected irrigation management strategy. To explain
    this counterintuitive result, it is necessary to consider how the choice of irrigation
    management strategy and the accuracy of the information used to implement that
    strategy, combine to influence risks of crop water stress and resulting yield
    losses. For our baseline analysis, the highest performing (in terms of CE) soil-moisture
    target strategy consisted of irrigation being triggered when soil-moisture levels
    were assumed to be 48, 46, 38 and 12% of soil-water holding capacity in each of
    the crop''s four main growth stages (Table 1). These assumptions compare with
    calibrated thresholds for the initiation of crop water stress affecting canopy
    expansion (86%), plant transpiration (31%), canopy senescence (31%), or pollination
    (20%). Thus, the optimal soil-moisture targets, apart from that in the final growth
    stage (canopy senescence) are above thresholds needed to trigger more severe crop
    stress effects (stomatal closure, early canopy senescence, pollination failure).
    These thresholds have been optimized to maximize profit over 30 years of climate
    data, meaning that they must incorporate a degree of headroom in order to cope
    with unexpected year-to-year weather variability, with exact weather conditions
    being unknown to farmers apriori in any given season. Therefore, errors in estimates
    of soil-moisture conditions have to be large and persist for multiple days to
    result in unintended water stress, reducing the risks posed by inaccurate soil-water
    monitoring. In contrast, the highest performing single threshold (i.e., sub-optimal)
    irrigation strategy was 38% of soil-water holding capacity (Table 3). This sub-optimal
    threshold is closer to the crop water stress thresholds – in particular in earlier
    stages of crop development – and so can result in greater increases in both the
    frequency and magnitude of water-stress occurrence. This single seasonal threshold
    also has the effect of triggering excess water use in the late season, explaining
    how the choice of irrigation strategy has a large impact on water-use efficiency
    and farm profits even in the absence of soil-moisture uncertainty. This intuition
    underlying our findings is also critical to understanding how consideration of
    behavioral feedbacks (Section 3.1) and variability in irrigation costs (Section
    3.2) influence the impacts of soil-moisture uncertainty on water use and farm
    profits in our analysis. When considering the potential for rational behavioral
    feedbacks made by farmers (e.g., to respond to visible signs of severe water deficits),
    it is logical that this feedback mitigates the effect of measurement uncertainties
    as these feedbacks further minimize any risks of erroneously falling below the
    intended irrigation trigger threshold. Similarly, the moderate increase in the
    sensitivity of water use and profits to soil moisture-uncertainty at higher water
    prices can be explained by the fact that farmers faced by higher water prices
    will irrigate at lower soil-moisture levels independent of any uncertainty in
    soil-moisture measurement (in order to reduce total irrigation applied over the
    season). Indeed, optimal soil-moisture targets for higher water price of $3 per
    ha-mm were 0, 46, 30, 2% soil-water holding capacity. As such, farmers operating
    in regions with higher water prices – whatever their cause – will have greater
    risks of triggering unintended water stress for a given level of soil-moisture
    measurement, suggesting that the value of improved soil-moisture information accuracy
    will depend in part on local water prices and costs of irrigation access. 4.1.
    Policy implications Our main finding that perfect soil-moisture information is
    not required to make near-optimal irrigation decisions is broadly consistent with
    wider literature assessing the value of soil and climate information for farmers
    (Bosch and Eidman, 1987; Botes et al., 1996; Fafchamps and Minten, 2012). For
    example, previous research found that using historical weather data to determine
    optimal irrigation strategies results in relatively minor irrigation increases
    and profit losses compared with using perfect weather forecasts (Linker et al.,
    2018; Jamal et al., 2019). Moreover, Linker and Kisekka (2017) used a similar
    parallel-model approach to the present study to show that perfect real-time soil-moisture
    measurements may not be required to implement a deficit irrigation strategy. These
    studies, along with our findings, show that the value of improved soil-moisture
    measurement data alone may have been overstated by technology providers and water
    managers. Instead, a meaningful proportion of potential gains in profit or water
    efficiency may actually be the result of improved advice or guidance about optimal
    irrigation management practices, which are commonly provided by technology providers
    or extension agents when seeking to introduce new technologies for farm-level
    decision support (whether that be a soil-moisture sensor or crop-water model).
    When compared with estimated profitability gains observed in our analysis, this
    result suggests that the benefits of improved soil-moisture data – which can cost
    hundreds of dollars (Kukal et al., 2019) – may vary substantially depending on
    farmers’ baseline soil-moisture uncertainty or irrigation scheduling practices
    and heuristics, with much of the gains in water-use productivity potentially achievable
    through improving irrigation management practices, even if soil-moisture monitoring
    remains imperfect. The greater impact of irrigation-strategy choice over information
    accuracy identified in our study has important implications for efforts to improve
    irrigation-management decision-making. For example, deficit irrigation – whereby
    irrigation is reduced below full crop-water needs while minimizing stress at sensitive
    growth stages – has been widely proposed as a key tool for improving agricultural
    water productivity (Kang et al., 2000; Blonquist et al., 2006; Fereres and Soriano,
    2007; Dukes et al., 2010). Our findings highlight the importance of these efforts,
    demonstrating that it may be more cost effective to refine irrigation-management
    strategies, for example through optimization methods, in particular where costs
    of reducing soil-moisture monitoring errors are large (e.g., if multiple sensors
    need to be installed within a single field). A focus on improving irrigation strategies
    over monitoring data could lead to potentially faster improvements in agricultural
    water productivity. Where improvements in monitoring are considered, the focus
    should be on low cost and more scalable solutions as opposed to expensive sensor
    network arrays that aim for high levels of accuracy and precision in soil-moisture
    monitoring. For example, a farmer might choose to use a smaller network of low-cost
    sensors to monitor soil moisture or instead rely on remotely observed proxies
    for soil moisture such as from Earth observation satellites. Our results, and
    those of Linker and Kisekka (2017), indicate that the lower monitoring accuracy
    of such approaches would not necessarily be detrimental to water-use efficiency
    or productivity, and in some cases may be an economically optimal solution for
    farmers. Further research, however, is required to evaluate the cost-effectiveness
    of different monitoring and sensing approaches that vary in terms of their adoption
    costs and accuracy in different types of agricultural production systems. Finally,
    our results contribute to the wider literature on the use of crop-water models
    to estimate irrigation water demand in the context of agricultural water management
    and planning. Such studies typically assume the farmer has access to perfect soil-moisture
    information (García-Vila and Fereres, 2012; Foster et al., 2014; Zellner et al.,
    2020). Our results suggest that this assumption does not have a major impact on
    results other than marginal underestimations in water use. However, our results
    do highlight that incorrectly parameterizing farmers’ irrigation strategies is
    potentially a significant source of uncertainty in irrigation demand projections.
    Previous studies have highlighted a large variability in irrigation behavior,
    even after controlling for key inputs to crop models such as crop type, soil type,
    and irrigation technology (Foster et al., 2019). Our findings thus highlight that
    the lack of information on the rules that govern farmers’ irrigation decisions
    is potentially a major source of uncertainty in irrigation water demand estimation
    and projection. This uncertainty may greatly exceed those introduced by uncertainty
    in soil, climate, or crop input parameter data that are more commonly the focus
    of parameter uncertainty studies. 4.2. Limitations and future work The analysis
    presented in this study contains a number of limitations and simplifications that
    warrant discussion here and consideration in future extensions to this paper.
    In our analysis, we have assumed a perfect model that accurately represents both
    the movement of water in soil and corresponding crop growth. This assumption has
    enabled us to focus on quantifying the effect of measurement errors, such as the
    water flux and soil texture, making the results independent of the choice of crop-growth
    model. If this assumption does not hold, there would be a larger deviation between
    the farmer''s perception and the true soil-water conditions, potentially placing
    more importance on having accurate soil-moisture information. However, the inclusion
    of the feedback mechanism in this study places limits on how wrong these perceptions
    of soil-water conditions can be, meaning that the main conclusions of this study
    should hold even under an imperfect model. Moreover, in reality, adoption of sensors
    is unlikely to guarantee perfect information about soil-moisture conditions. Sensors
    may give imprecise readings due to faults, inaccurate calibration, or where extrapolating
    point measurements to field scales (Sharma et al., 2021), meaning that our comparison
    with perfect information may be exaggerating the true benefits of technology adoption.
    The major consequences of over-irrigating in our framework have been through the
    excess cost of water applied. However, in reality, an additional impact of over-irrigation
    is waterlogging and associated damage to crops through aeration stress, pests/diseases
    and mechanical damage such as lodging. Recent research has shown that process-based
    crop models poorly capture the occurrence of waterlogging due to assumptions in
    soil-moisture drainage routines, and thus underestimate the negative impacts of
    excess water supply on crop growth and yields (Li et al., 2019). Neglecting these
    negative consequences of over-irrigation may mean that our analysis has understated
    the effects of uncertainty on crop yields and profits, in particular for crops
    that are sensitive to effects of waterlogging and excess irrigation (e.g., enhanced
    lodging risks for crops such as wheat). Nonetheless, the more severe cases of
    over-irrigation would have been prevented via the behavioral feedback mechanisms
    used in this analysis, and this point of intervention where a farmer feels that
    further irrigation would be detrimental to the crop (chosen to be field capacity
    in this case study) would likely change and reflect the risks of their specific
    crop based on their own experience. This feedback addition means that impacts
    of model simplifications of over-irrigation effects should be minimized under
    the assumption of rational farmer behavior. Conversely, for systems that apply
    significant amounts of water in one event (e.g. flood irrigation), the potential
    for crop stress caused by over-irrigation is increased compared to our study of
    pivot production. Our analysis does not explicitly consider the effects technical
    or regulatory constraints to irrigation water use on the value of more accurate
    soil-moisture information. In reality, policies constraining seasonal or intraseasonal
    rates of water use (Ifft et al., 2018) or physical limits on water use (e.g.,
    due to declining well yields) (Foster et al., 2015) may both increase incentives
    for farmers to avoid over-irrigation and thus increase the value of implementing
    optimal irrigation strategies. Combined with these limits, characteristics of
    the delivery system will impact which days and how much water can be applied in
    each event beyond the simple maximum daily limit considered in our analysis (O''Brien
    et al., 1998). Such restrictions and extraneous variables (e.g., a seasonal cap
    on irrigation) may increase the value of information as there is an additional
    cost of exceeding this cap. On the other hand, if irrigation events are largely
    determined by well yields, water delivery systems, energy regulators, and weather
    forecasts, then the number of mis-timed irrigation events due solely to inaccurate
    soil-moisture measurements will be low. In either case, we expect the value of
    improved irrigation strategies to move in the same direction as the value of soil-moisture
    information, as more freedom over the timing and quantity of water applied allows
    the farmer to better adjust irrigation to match crop-water needs. The results
    of our illustrative example are predicated on the ability of the underlying crop-water
    model (AquaCrop-OS) to accurately simulate crop responses to soil water deficits.
    The model has been calibrated and extensively applied to simulate irrigated and
    rainfed maize production in our study area and wider North American farming systems
    (Heng et al., 2009; Foster et al., 2015; Sandhu and Irmak, 2019). However, to
    ensure that our results are not being driven by any remaining uncertainty in either
    water-stress thresholds or response parameters, a sensitivity analysis was therefore
    performed. In this sensitivity analysis, we artificially altered the stress-response
    parameters in AquaCrop-OS, setting each value to 1 to maximize impacts of any
    short-duration periods of water stress on crop growth and yields. We then repeated
    our analysis described in Section 3.1 following methods outlined in Section 2.
    Water use and profits from this analysis showed the same non-linear response to
    water flux and soil-texture uncertainty as reported earlier in Section 3. A 10%
    standard error in both soil-texture and water-flux inputs led to less than 1%
    change in water use and less than 5% change in profits (Figure S8). This sensitivity
    analysis demonstrates that the results presented in this article are highly unlikely
    to be an artifact of any inability within AquaCrop to simulate the severity of
    short-duration water-stress impacts, and we expect that qualitatively identical
    results would therefore be obtained with alternative more biophysically complex
    crop models [e.g., Hybrid Maize (Yang et al., 2004)]. A key reason for this result
    is that while the model now responds more strongly to water stress, optimal soil-moisture
    targets are also adjusted to 64, 73, 39, 0% soil-water holding capacity and thereby
    greatly increasing the headroom above the critical crop-stress thresholds. Finally,
    our results are specific to the particular illustrative application chosen in
    this study: irrigated maize production in the central United States. Nonetheless,
    we expect that our general qualitative finding – that choice of irrigation scheduling
    rules is more important than the accuracy of data these rules are implemented
    based on – will apply more generally to other crops and regions. In particular,
    our sensitivity analysis (described above) suggests that, even for more drought-sensitive
    crops (e.g., soft fruits), perfect information may not be necessary to achieve
    near-optimal water efficiency and profits so long as farmers’ baseline irrigation
    heuristics are effectively representative of crop sensitivity to water deficits.
    Conversely, higher crop prices are likely to enhance the value of improved soil-moisture
    information as any yield losses will have a larger economic impact for farmers.
    The limited sensitivity of crop yields to measurement errors shown in Sections
    3.1 and 3.2 suggest that changes in crop price would have minimal impact on economic
    losses caused by soil-moisture uncertainty. This is in contrast with the larger
    effects of water prices and risk aversion that are directly affected by the greater
    magnitude of change in irrigation water use with measurement error. Nonetheless,
    we acknowledge that variations in crop yields may have a larger influence on the
    value of improved soil-moisture information, for example where a farmer''s baseline
    irrigation strategy is sub-optimal or for crops that respond strongly to either
    soil water deficits or saturation. Analyzing such alternate production environments
    is beyond the scope of this paper, but will be an important area for future research
    building on the results presented here. 5. Conclusions Effective irrigation scheduling
    is essential for improving agricultural water productivity and managing the negative
    impacts of agricultural water abstractions on other water users and the environment.
    Therefore, technology companies and researchers have focused on developing technologies
    such as soil-moisture sensors that improve the quality of farmers’ soil-moisture
    information. Implicit to this approach is an assumption that more accurate information
    is essential to enable efficient near-optimal irrigation decisions. However, this
    assumption neglects the contribution of farmers’ choice of irrigation strategy,
    which may have an equally significant or greater impact on overall efficiency
    and profitability of agricultural water use. In this article, we have developed
    a framework to assess the impacts of increasing uncertainty on water use and farm
    profits. Measurement errors in water fluxes and soil texture lead to a divergence
    between the farmers’ perception of soil moisture and the true soil-water status,
    resulting in sub-optimal irrigation decisions and reduced profitability. However,
    our results show that the magnitude of these impacts are small, with a 30% standard
    error in water-flux and soil-texture measurements – which is much larger than
    the likely real-world measurement uncertainty in these quantities, particularly
    precipitation and irrigation depth – resulting in only a 4% increase in average
    water use, meaning that near-optimal irrigation decisions can be made without
    perfect information. Contrastingly, we demonstrate that the choice of irrigation
    scheduling strategy has a larger impact on water use and profits than soil-moisture
    uncertainty. Our analysis suggests that efforts to improve irrigation water efficiency
    should therefore focus primarily on helping farmers to evaluate and develop improved
    irrigation scheduling strategies for their specific production settings. Where
    existing irrigation management strategies are poorly aligned with local agronomic
    and biophysical conditions, the potential gains in water-use productivity and
    profitability may be large and further enhance the potential benefits from complementary
    efforts to improve quality of soil-moisture information using new forms of low-cost
    and scalable sensing technologies. CRediT authorship contribution statement T.D.

    variability of physiological response to water stress, was superior to a constant
    PWDI threshold in improving WUE. A constant PWDI threshold of 0.54 and 45 threshold

    between food demand and water shortage has become increasingly prominent globally.
    Instead of traditional irrigation, more and more attention has been paid regarding
    knowledge- and technology-driven \"smart\" irrigation due to advantages such as
    automatic controllability and feasibility in optimizing crop yield and irrigation
    water use efficiency (WUE) through decision support systems (Irrigation Association,
    2011). The key task of a smart irrigation decision support system (SIDSS) is to
    promote timely supply of appropriate quantities of water to crops according to
    predetermined targets of yield and/or WUE (Shi et al., 2020). In the last decades,
    a number of SIDSSs have been developed to determine when and how much water to
    irrigate, based on data regarding either weather, plant, soil, or their combinations
    (Irrigation Association, 2011). Due to inevitable difficulties in both theory
    and practice of irrigation decision-making and application, such weather-, plant-,
    or soil-based SIDSSs have yet to become popularly adopted in commercial practice
    (Jones, 2004, Dukes, 2012). In the case of a relatively simple and convenient
    soil-based SIDSS, irrigation is triggered when an index, representing the extent
    of water availability or stress to crop, exceeds a threshold. Accurate estimation
    of crop stress according to soil water conditions and determination of suitable
    thresholds to initiate irrigation events can benefit desired yield and/or WUE
    targets. Recent studies have indicated that estimation of an available soil water-based
    plant water deficit index (PWDI), and thus irrigation precision, can be significantly
    improved by considering not only the quantity of soil water but also its relative
    distribution to roots (Shi et al., 2015, Wu et al., 2017). In order to demonstrate
    how to determine an efficient PWDI threshold within its theoretical range from
    0 to 1, Shi et al. (2020) investigated the effects of PWDI threshold on the yields
    and WUE of drip-irrigated maize and sprinkler-irrigated alfalfa through field
    experiments. To relieve the unpredictable effects of some factors (e.g. climate,
    nutrient, variety and cultivation), the measured yields and WUE were normalized
    to their corresponding potentials and then were fitted as the functions of PWDI
    threshold values. Based on this quantitative relationship, water application was
    able to be scheduled according to any attainable target of yield and/or WUE, and
    conversely, yield and WUE could be predicted according to any designed irrigation
    scheme (Shi et al., 2020). The field study in Shi et al. (2020) was limited to
    eight combinations of PWDI thresholds (between 0.21 and 0.71) and the corresponding
    relative yields and WUEs for maize, and four such combinations (between 0.15 and
    0.6) for alfalfa. Further verification under more scenarios with various PWDI
    thresholds between 0 and 1, as well as specification for different crops, environmental
    conditions and cultivation modes, is necessary. Additionally, under each experimental
    treatment in Shi et al. (2020), the PWDI threshold was kept constant throughout
    the growing season. In fact, the effects of water stress on plant water relations
    and physiological mechanisms can be significantly different at various plant phenological
    stages (Hsiao, 1973, Zhang et al., 1999). It may therefore be hypothesized that
    the soil water-based SIDSS can be further improved, achieving higher yields and/or
    WUE, if adapted to allow for regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) with a time-variable
    PWDI threshold (Shi et al., 2020). Although experimental and machine learning
    techniques are available to verify, specify or improve a SIDSS, more convenient
    and less time and resource consuming numerical simulation methods may be more
    feasible (Navarro-Hellín et al., 2016). Under specific soil, plant and climate
    conditions, to schedule irrigation or predict yield and WUE according to a constant
    or variable PWDI threshold, precise simulation of soil water flow and crop growth
    is necessary. Up to now, many models have been successfully developed to simulate
    soil water transport, crop growth and yield in soil-plant-atmosphere continuum
    systems (Feddes et al., 1978, Mailhol et al., 2007, Khaledian et al., 2009). The
    objective of this study, therefore, was to demonstrate efficient scheduling of
    data-driven smart irrigation through numerical simulation, determining a reasonable
    (constant or variable) PWDI threshold for an available soil water-based SIDSS
    according to combined yield and WUE targets. The field experimental data for maize
    in Shi et al. (2020) were adopted to establish a coupled soil water flow and crop
    growth model, and numerical simulation was conducted for each designed case with
    an alternative constant or variable PWDI threshold. 2. Materials and methods 2.1.
    Field experiment A field experiment, previously described in detail by Shi et
    al. (2020), was conducted at Wudan Village (43º 5′ 10\"N, 122º 16′ 25\"E, altitude
    275.2 m), Kezuohouqi County, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China. On 11 May
    2016, at a 20 × 50 cm2 spacing (4 rows in a 150 cm × 200 cm plot), spring maize
    (Zea mays L. Jingke 968) was planted in 12 independent plots mulched by plastic
    film. For each row, a drip tape with emitters (1.6 L h−1) every 20 cm was fixed
    under the plastic film. Diammonium phosphate was applied as base fertilizer at
    225 kg ha−1. On 72 days after planting (DAP), 450 kg ha−1 urea was top-dressed.
    From surface to 150 cm depth, 3 soil layers were described in Table 1. Meteorological
    data were recorded at 30 min intervals in a nearby agro-meteorological station
    (WeatherHawk 500, Campbell Scientific, USA). Table 1. Soil properties: contents
    of sand, silt, clay and salt, bulk density, saturated water content (θs), residual

    was installed to elude the effects of rainfall. At the center of each plot, soil
    water content under the drip tape was measured daily (16:00–18:00) through a portable
    soil moisture device (Diviner 2000, Sentek Sensor Technologies, SA, Australia)
    at 10 cm intervals from soil surface to 100 cm depth. Irrigation water was provided
    from a local well with a pH value of 7.6 and electrical conductivity value of
    0.32 ms cm−1. From planting to 36 DAP, water was applied at what were assumed
    to be sufficient levels reaching a total of 3.1 cm. Subsequently, according to
    the pre-designed PWDI thresholds (0.01, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3), four water treatments
    (W1, W2, W3 and W4) were established with 3 replications. At the seedling, jointing,
    heading, filling and mature stages (30, 51, 75, 97 and 120 DAP), leaf area, aboveground
    biomass, rooting depth, root length density and soil water content at 5 cm depth
    intervals were measured by sampling (Shi et al., 2020). Between two successive
    sampling events, leaf area under each treatment was additionally determined according
    to the width and length of leaves and a calibrated conversion coefficient of 0.75.
    On 129 DAP, crops were harvested and yield was determined. Under each treatment,
    irrigation was initiated when the daily estimated PWDI was higher than the treatment-designed
    threshold (Shi et al., 2015, Shi et al., 2020, Wu et al., 2017): (1) where zr
    is the normalized depth (= z/Lr), z is the positive downwards vertical coordinate
    (cm) originating from the soil surface, and Lr is the rooting depth (cm), fitted
    according to the measured data; Lnrd(zr) is the normalized root length density;
    h is soil matric potential (cm), estimated according to the measured soil water
    content and the corresponding soil water retention function (Table 1); is a dimensionless
    soil water stress response function, chosen as a piecewise power function (Musters
    and Bouten, 2000): (2) where hH, hL and hW are the higher and lower thresholds
    of optimal soil water condition and the soil matric potential at permanent wilting
    point (cm), adopted as the recommended values of − 50, − 400 and − 15,000 cm,
    respectively (Feddes et al., 1976); ρ is a fitting parameter (0 < ρ < 10), affected
    by soil and plant properties. In Eq. (1), the normalized root length density is
    described by a generalized function (Zuo et al., 2013): (3) where p is a fitting
    parameter representing the normalized root length density at soil surface. Since
    root data were absent until all sampling events were completed, the fitting parameters
    of ρ in Eq. (2) and p in Eq. (3) could not be obtained specifically during the
    experimental treatment period (37-129 DAP). To initiate irrigation according to
    the PWDI value estimated by (1), (2), (3), ρ was initially assumed as 1.0, providing
    a linear soil water stress response function, and p was assumed as 3.27 according
    to the statistical results from the local field experiments conducted previously
    in 2014 and 2015 (Wu et al., 2017, Shi et al., 2020). For each event, irrigation
    depth (I, cm) was determined as (Wu et al., 2017, Shi et al., 2020): (4) in which
    . where β is the designed percentage of wetting area (%), validated as 50% for
    drip irrigation in this study; Dw is the designed wetting depth (cm), set as 60 cm
    for drip irrigation to limit deep leakage with a maximum allowed depletion of
    10.4 cm; θ(z) is the real-time volumetric soil water content (cm3 cm−3); and θf
    is the field water capacity (cm3 cm−3) corresponding to soil matric potential
    of − 330 cm (Romano and Santini, 2002), set as the objective soil water content
    for irrigation (Table 1). 2.2. Soil water transport model In a drip-irrigated
    field, three-dimensional soil water transport is usually simplified and generalized
    in two-dimension perpendicular to drip line or row (Wang et al., 2014a, Wang et
    al., 2014b, Ning et al., 2015). Under some specific conditions, soil water under
    drip irrigation has been represented one-dimensionally (Ramos et al., 2011, Poch-Massegú
    et al., 2014, Márquez et al., 2017). In this study, in light of the high permeability
    of sandy soil (with saturated hydraulic conductivities higher than 15.0 cm d−1,
    Table 1) and the dense layout of emitters at 20 cm interval, the wetting zone
    was relatively deep, long and narrow with a width of about 25 cm, and thus the
    local soil water flow could be approximately described by the vertical one-dimensional
    Richards equation (Feddes et al., 1978, Wu et al., 1999): (5) (6) (7) (8) where
    C(h) is soil water capacity (cm−1); t is time (d); K(h) is soil hydraulic conductivity
    (cm d−1); h0(z) is the initial distribution of soil matric potential (cm); L is
    the simulation depth (cm), set as 100 cm in this study; hL(t) is the soil matric
    potential at the lower boundary (cm); q(t) is the water flow rate from soil surface
    (cm d−1), estimated by uniformly allocating input water on the designed wetting
    area (50% of the land area) during irrigation period and set as zero due to the
    mulch of plastic film during non-irrigation period; S(z, t) is the actual root
    water uptake rate (cm3 cm−3 d−1), described by a macroscopic model (Feddes et
    al., 1978, Wu et al., 1999): (9) where Smax(z, t) is the maximal root water uptake
    rate under the optimal soil water condition (cm3 cm−3 d−1); Tp is the potential
    transpiration rate (cm d−1), simulated with the Penman-Monteith equation as given
    in FAO-56 (Allen et al., 1998), in which the required leaf area index (LAI, cm2
    cm−2) was simulated by the following crop growth model. Upon completion of the
    field experiment, the fitting parameter p in Eq. (3) was calibrated using the
    root data measured under the four treatments in this study and those measured
    previously in 2014 and 2015 (Wu et al., 2017, Shi et al., 2020). The fitting parameter
    ρ in Eq. (2) was optimized under the W2 and W3 treatments by trial and error (Musters
    and Bouten, 2000), and validated under the W4 treatment as described in Shi et
    al. 2020. Replacing the initially assumed values (p = 3.27 and ρ = 1.0) during
    the experimental period, the calibrated p and optimized ρ were adopted to simulate
    the soil water flow by solving the vertical one-dimensional Richards equation.
    Subsequently PWDI was estimated using Eq. (1) and transpiration rate (Ta, cm d−1)
    according to (Shi et al., 2015): (10) 2.3. Crop growth model Leaf area index was
    simulated using (Mailhol et al., 2007): (11) where LAIm (cm2 cm−2) is the maximal
    LAI for maize under optimal soil water conditions; TT is the effective accumulated
    temperature from planting to simulation time (°C), calculated according to daily
    maximum and minimum air temperatures and the base temperature of 10 °C for maize
    (Stricevic et al., 2011); Te is the effective accumulated temperature for emergence
    (°C); Tm is the effective accumulated temperature corresponding to LAIm (°C)；
    is a fitting parameter, relating to the dynamic trend of LAI; R TR 10 is the relative
    transpiration rate (Ta/Tp) averaged within the 10 days before simulation；λ is
    the coefficient representing the sensitivity of LAI to water stress. Referring
    to the field experimental data in Wu et al. (2017), LAIm, Te and Tm were chosen
    as 9.7 cm2 cm−2, 63.6 °C and 868.9 °C, respectively. The dry weight of aboveground
    biomass (Wd, kg ha−1) was simulated using (Mailhol et al., 2007): (12) where 10
    is a unit conversion coefficient; RUE is the intercepted radiation use efficiency
    (g MJ−1); ts is days from planting to simulation (d); Sj is the solar radiation
    at the jth day after planting (J m−2); is the coefficient representing the sensitivity
    of biomass to water stress; and Rj is the fraction of intercepted solar radiation
    at the jth day after planting, estimated as an exponential function of LAI (Monteith
    and Moss, 1977): (13) where k is the extinction coefficient (Zaffaroni and Schneiter,
    1989): (14) Grain yield (Y, kg ha−1) was simulated using (Mailhol et al., 2007):
    (15) where Wdh is the dry weight of aboveground biomass at harvest time (kg ha−1);
    HI is the harvest index (Morgan, 1997, Mogensen et al., 1985, Talukder et al.,
    1987): (16) where HIopt is the harvest index under optimal soil water condition;
    is a fitting parameter representing the effect of LAI on harvest index; LAIts
    (cm2 cm−2) is the LAI threshold below which harvest index decreased from its potential
    value, set as 2.5 cm2 cm−2 for maize in this study (Khaledian et al., 2009); LAIac
    is the average LAI during the critical period of maize (cm2 cm−2), determined
    as the grain filling stage (Otegui et al., 1995, Pandey et al., 2000). Consequently,
    WUE (kg m−3) was calculated to evaluate the practical productivity of total water
    input (Hsiao, 1993, Sudhir et al., 2011): (17) where 0.01 is a unit conversion
    coefficient; It is the total irrigation depth applied during the growth season
    (cm); and Pt is the total precipitation (cm), ignored in this study due to the
    application of rain-shelter. To simulate crop growth, with the least-squares procedure,
    the unknown parameters ( and λ in Eq. (11), RUE and in Eq. (12), HIopt and in
    Eq. (16)) were optimized according to the measured data under W1 and W3 treatments,
    and validated under W2 and W4 treatments. 2.4. Numerical simulation Programmed
    using the platform of MATLAB (R2014a, MathWorks Inc., MA, USA), numerical simulation
    was conducted by adjusting PWDI threshold to obtain various scenarios and modeling
    soil water transport and crop growth under each scenario. The schemes and steps
    of numerical simulation were sketched as follows: (1) Choosing the experimental
    treatment period (37–129 DAP) as the numerical simulation period; (2) Designing
    two numerical experiments (Nexp.) to establish various scenarios. Nexp. 1: keeping
    PWDI threshold constant during the entire simulation period for each scenario,
    and increasing PWDI threshold from 0.01 to 0.99 at 0.01 interval to obtain 99
    scenarios; Nexp. 2: adjusting PWDI threshold during the early (37–75 DAP, seedling
    to jointing stage), middle (76–97 DAP, heading to filling stage) and later (98–129
    DAP, filling to mature stage) periods from 0.1 to 0.9 at 0.1 interval, respectively,
    to create 729 (9 × 9 × 9) scenarios; (3) According to the initial data (starting
    on 36 DAP), simulating the soil water profile on the next day by solving (5),
    (6), (7), (8) with the procedure offered by Shi and Zuo (2009); (4) Estimating
    the PWDI value and daily actual transpiration rate with (1), (10), respectively;
    (5) Simulating LAI and aboveground biomass with (11), (12), respectively; (6)
    If the estimated PWDI was higher than the scenario-designed PWDI threshold, “irrigation”
    was assumed to be carried out with the amount determined by Eq. (4); (7) Repeating
    steps (3)-(6) to continuously simulate or estimate soil water profile, daily actual
    transpiration rate, PWDI, LAI and aboveground dry weight on subsequent days (37-129
    DAP) by setting the previous simulation results as initial data, and scheduling
    “irrigation” if the estimated PWDI was higher than the scenario-designed PWDI
    threshold; (8) Predicting grain yield and WUE with (15), (17), respectively; (9)
    Repeating steps (3)-(8) to carry out numerical simulation for all the other designed
    scenarios. 2.5. Statistical analysis Microsoft Excel 2016 (Microsoft Corporation,
    USA) was used to process experimental data and conduct regression analysis. Analysis
    of variance (ANOVA) was performed with the general linear model (GLM) procedure
    of statistical software package (SPSS 20.0, International Business Machines Corporation,
    USA). When differences were found, one-way analysis of variance was performed
    to evaluate the effects on the studied parameters with the least significant differences
    (LSD) at 0.05 probability level. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Soil water transport
    and crop growth models When the field experiment was completed, the fitting parameters
    ρ in Eq. (2) and p in Eq. (3) were optimized as 0.30 and calibrated as 3.27 (Table
    2), respectively, replacing the initially assumed values, and as such, the vertical
    one-dimensional soil water transport model was validated under the W4 treatment
    (Shi et al., 2020). To reflect real water stress extent, the PWDI values under
    W1-W4 treatments were re-estimated daily, and the PWDI thresholds used to “initiate”
    the existing irrigation events were adjusted from the primary values of 0.01,
    0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 to 0.21, 0.5, 0.6 and 0.66, respectively (Shi et al., 2020).

    1.30 0.42 0.47 0.01 According to the measured data under W1 and W3 treatments,
    and λ in Eq. (11), RUE and in Eq. (12), and HIopt and in Eq. (16) were optimized
    (Table 2), corresponding to the minimal root mean square errors (RMSE) of 0.47 cm2
    cm−2 for LAI, 1332 kg ha−1 for aboveground biomass, and 285 kg ha−1 for yield.
    The crop growth model was then validated under the treatments of W2 and W4, with
    the averaged RMSE of 0.32 cm2 cm−2 for LAI (Fig. 1), 1250 kg ha−1 for aboveground
    biomass, and 240 kg ha−1 for yield. This result indicated that the model was reliable
    in catching the growth dynamics of maize cultured under various soil water conditions,
    with a determination coefficient (R2) between the measured and simulated data
    higher than 0.95. Download : Download high-res image (234KB) Download : Download

    3.2. Numerical simulation with a constant PWDI threshold The coupled model dependably
    simulated irrigation depth, plant growth and transpiration, grain yield, and WUE,
    with acceptable RMSE and R2 higher than 0.85, between the simulated and measured
    data for the four actual water treatments (W1-W4) in Nexp. 1 (Fig. 2). The relatively
    obvious deviation came from the simulation of aboveground biomass, with the largest
    relative error of 6.5% under W1 treatment and an average relative error of 5.8%
    (Fig. 2b). Besides irrigation depth, irrigation scheduling according to the coupled
    model was also comparable with the experimental data. For W1-W4 treatments, totally
    33, 7, 5 and 4 irrigation events were respectively predicted during the treatment
    period from 37 to 129 DAP, agreeing well with the actual 34, 7, 4 and 3 irrigation
    events (Fig. 3). Under W3 and W4 treatments, the predicted first irrigation event
    was respectively delayed 9 and 4 d, but did not cause significant limitation to
    plant growth or yield (Fig. 2b) due to an additional irrigation event and similar
    ultimate irrigation depth (Fig. 4). Among the 99 scenarios, almost all the applied
    water was consumed by transpiration (Fig. 2A), which should be attributed to the
    objective soil water content being set as field water capacity (Eq. (4)), deeper
    simulation depth than the soil wetting depth ((5), (6), (7), (8)), and the effect
    of film mulch limiting soil evaporation. Download : Download high-res image (412KB)

    of PWDI threshold from 0.01 to 0.99, accompanied by the reduction of irrigation
    events from 92 times to zero (Fig. 3) during the treatment period (37–129 DAP),
    less water was supplied and transpired (Fig. 2a), and plant growth and yield were
    more seriously limited (Fig. 2b). Nevertheless, WUE was generally improved until
    the occurrence of extreme water stress with a PWDI threshold higher than 0.85,
    afterwards it sharply decreased (Fig. 2c). These results regarding the simulated
    effects of water stress on plant growth, production and WUE generally accorded
    well with findings in the literature involving various soil, plant and climate
    conditions (Radin et al., 1989, Zhang et al., 1999, Kang et al., 2002, Liu et
    al., 2005, Emekli et al., 2007, Candogan et al., 2013). However, for the simulation
    of WUE, fluctuation occurred when PWDI threshold exceeded 0.45, and the fluctuation
    range expanded with the increase of PWDI threshold (Fig. 2c). This might be explained
    by the different irrigation schemes among the consecutive scenarios. After a sharp
    decrease from 92 to 9 times when PWDI threshold increased from 0.01 to 0.45, irrigation
    events subsequently were only gradually reduced. Under many scenarios, the number
    of irrigation events was identical while irrigation depth and duration were different
    (Fig. 3). For example, under each one of the 12 scenarios for PWDI threshold between
    0.66 and 0.77, irrigation was uniformly triggered four times during the treatment
    period. Compared to 0.66, the predicted total irrigation depth under the scenario
    with a PWDI threshold of 0.77 was enhanced 5.5% from 20.0 to 21.1 cm since a higher
    PWDI threshold always leads to lower soil water content before irrigation. But
    the four irrigation events were delayed by an average of 5 days, and thus transpiration
    was limited 3.8% from 20.9 to 20.1 cm (Fig. 2a). Grain yield was subsequently
    reduced 9.1% from 11120 to 10114 kg ha−1, resulting in a reduction of 14.2% in
    irrigation WUE (from 5.57 to 4.78 kg m−3). Nevertheless, it is challenging to
    accurately identify the specific optimal scenarios (e.g. with a PWDI threshold
    of 0.66) in practice due to unpredictable influences potentially coming from environmental
    conditions, management, and measurement and simulation inaccuracies. As a function
    of PWDI threshold, both yield and WUE behaved according to complicated, dynamic
    patterns (Fig. 2) that were difficult to fit using simple (i.e. linear) functions.
    In the narrow range from 0.21 under W1 to 0.66 under W4, yield and WUE were almost
    linearly proportional to PWDI threshold with very few exceptions of slight fluctuation.
    Consequently, the maximal yield of 18859 kg ha−1, interpolated by Shi et al. (2020)
    according to the fitted linear relationship, agreed well with the maximal value
    of 18752 kg ha−1 among the 99 scenarios in Nexp. 1, simulated through the coupled
    model under the scenario of full irrigation with a PWDI threshold of 0.01 (Fig.
    2b). However, among the 99 scenarios in Nexp. 1, maximal WUE was simulated as
    6.22 kg m−3 with a PWDI threshold of 0.85, which was 18.3% higher than the maximal
    value of 5.26 kg m−3 approximated by Shi et al. (2020) under the W4 treatment.
    These results suggest that numerical simulations can be favorable compared to
    other methods for irrigation scheduling due to avoidance of costly and laborious
    experimental measurements (Dabach et al., 2013, Rosenzweig et al., 2013). 3.3.
    Numerical simulation with a variable PWDI threshold Simulated results for the
    total 729 scenarios in Nexp. 2 are shown in Fig. 5a, where the PWDI thresholds
    during the early (37–75 DAP, seedling to jointing stage), middle (76–97 DAP, heading
    to filling stage) and later (98–129 DAP, filling to mature stage) periods were
    adjusted by 0.1 intervals from 0.1 to 0.9 and labeled around the abscissa axis
    with three nested scales from bottom to top, respectively. Fig. 5a indicates that
    different combinations of PWDI thresholds among various growth stages produced
    different combinations of yield and WUE, in response to the complex effects of
    soil water stress on plant growth processes such as emergence, photosynthesis
    and biomass accumulation, biomass allocation, organ construction, leaf senescence,
    transpiration, and consequently yield production (Zhang et al., 1999, Ozturk and
    Aydin, 2004, Igbadun et al., 2007, Candogan et al., 2013). The highest yield and
    lowest WUE when PWDI thresholds were a uniform 0.1 during the three periods were
    simulated as 17553 kg ha−1 and 3.26 kg m−3 by supplying 539.2 mm water via 43
    events (Fig. 5a). When the PWDI threshold increased during either the early, middle
    or later periods, yield decreased while WUE generally increased due to more serious
    water stress (Ozturk and Aydin, 2004, Igbadun et al., 2007). The highest WUE of
    6.67 kg m−3 was achieved when the PWDI thresholds during the early, middle and
    later periods were 0.9, 0.7 and 0.8 (0.9–0.7–0.8, Fig. 5a), respectively. This
    WUE was 7.2% higher than the highest value of 6.22 kg m−3 simulated in Nexp. 1
    with a constant threshold of 0.85 (Fig. 2c). The enhancement of the maximal WUE
    through RDI is likely attributed to variable physiological response mechanisms
    to water stress during different phenological growth stages (Hsiao, 1973, Zhang
    et al., 1999). Based on the PWDI threshold combination (0.9–0.7–0.8) with the
    highest WUE, trends of WUE and yield were evaluated by adjusting the PWDI threshold
    during the early, middle or later period between 0.1 and 0.9 while keeping the
    thresholds during the other two periods constant (Fig. 5a). When PWDI threshold
    increased during the early period, WUE always increased. Increasing PWDI thresholds
    during the middle and later periods led to increases followed by decreases in
    WUE, but the trend changed at a lower threshold of 0.7 when increasing thresholds
    in the middle period. This indication, that maize WUE is most sensitive to water
    stress during the middle growth season (heading and filling stages) and most insensitive
    during the early season (seedling to jointing stage), is well supported by the
    literature (Igbadun et al., 2007). Additionally, Fig. 5a indicates that yield
    is most sensitive to water stress during the early season with a biggest change
    range while most insensitive during the later season with a smallest change range
    (Doorenbos and Kassam, 1979). Download : Download high-res image (995KB) Download

    yield (a) and their corresponding relative values to the potential (b) for various
    scenarios with a variable threshold of plant water deficit index (PWDI) to trigger
    irrigation in Nexp. 2. PWDI thresholds during the early (37–75 DAP, seedling to
    jointing stage), middle (76–97 DAP, heading to filling stage) and later (98–129
    DAP, filling to mature stage) periods were adjusted according to an interval of
    0.1 from 0.1 to 0.9, and labeled around the abscissa axis with three nested scales
    from bottom to top, respectively. Based on the PWDI threshold combination (0.9–0.7–0.8)
    with the highest WUE of 6.67 kg m−3, the change trends were analyzed for WUE and
    yield when the PWDI threshold during each of the early, middle or later periods
    was adjusted between 0.1 and 0.9 at a 0.1 interval while keeping the thresholds
    during the other two periods constant. DAP, days after planting. Similar to Nexp.
    1, WUE was also found to fluctuate when the same number of irrigation events was
    accompanied by different irrigation depth and duration among the consecutive scenarios
    in Nexp. 2, particularly when the PWDI thresholds were higher than 0.5 during
    the three periods (Fig. 5a). Compared to Nexp. 1 (Fig. 2c), the fluctuations of
    WUE in Nexp. 2 were both slighter and fewer, since many intermediate scenarios
    were neglected when adopting a larger simulation interval of PWDI threshold of
    0.1 (instead of 0.01). Obviously, the advantage of numerical simulation in quantification
    could be more fully embodied by setting more detailed scenarios with smaller intervals.
    For example, if the simulation interval of PWDI threshold in Nexp. 2 was changed
    from 0.1 to 0.01 as that in Nexp. 1, the scenarios would increase from 729 to
    almost one million, leading to more comprehensive results. However, the corresponding
    numerical simulation time would increase exponentially. Relative to the relationship
    of yield or WUE as a function of a constant PWDI threshold (Fig. 2b and c), a
    more complicated and comprehensive relationship (Fig. 5a) resulted when a variable
    PWDI threshold was applied. To achieve an objective yield and/or WUE, consequently,
    an optimal scheme of RDI could be chosen from these available combinations of
    PWDI thresholds for the three simulation periods. 3.4. Scheduling irrigation through
    numerical simulation Besides irrigation, crop yield and WUE are also significantly
    influenced by many other complicated, uncontrollable or unpredictable factors
    such as climate, spatial variability of soil water and nutrients, variety and
    cultivation (Ritchie and Otter, 1985, Jalota et al., 2010). To schedule smart
    irrigation for an objective yield and/or WUE, it would be wise and reasonable
    to eliminate or relieve these unpredictable effects by normalizing yield and WUE
    based on their corresponding potential values, which are often obtained theoretically
    or experimentally in practice. To demonstrate smart irrigation scheduling, the
    potential values were simply extrapolated through the fitting relationship between
    PWDI threshold and the measured yield and WUE in Shi et al. (2020). In this study,
    the simulated maximal yield (18752 kg ha−1) and WUE (6.67 kg m−3) among all the
    scenarios in Nexps. 1 and 2 were taken as the corresponding potential values to
    obtain normalized yield and WUE. Synthesizing the above simulation results for
    maize during the treatment period, the changing processes of relative yield and
    WUE as a function of a variable or constant PWDI threshold are demonstrated in
    Fig. 5, Fig. 6, respectively. Irrigation can be scheduled for maize by choosing
    suitable PWDI thresholds according to the predesigned relative yield and/or WUE
    targets. For example, if a relative yield of 0.85 is desired or expected, a constant
    PWDI threshold in the SIDSS should be set as 0.25, resulting in a relative WUE
    of 0.53 (Fig. 6). For RDI, however, there are 20 combinations of PWDI thresholds
    corresponding to a relative yield of 0.85, with higher relative WUE in the range
    of 0.53–0.65, e.g. 0.3–0.3–0.1, 0.1–0.4–0.6, and so on, respectively for the early,
    middle and later periods (Fig. 5b). It seems that RDI with a variable PWDI threshold
    may be superior to enhance WUE and thus save more water resources for a predesigned
    yield target (Zheng et al., 2012). Download : Download high-res image (191KB)

    planting. In most arid and semiarid regions, deficit irrigation, especially RDI,
    is accompanied to some extent by sacrifice in yield (Rao et al., 1988, Singh,
    2014a). Assuming a yield reduction less than 20% (i.e. with a relative yield higher
    than 0.8) is acceptable under scenarios where there is an objective to save water
    (Zheng et al., 2012, Wang et al., 2014a, Wang et al., 2014b, Tan et al., 2018),
    the corresponding relative WUE resulting from the SIDSS with a constant PWDI threshold
    (< 0.35) would be lower than 0.57 (Fig. 6) while consuming more than 396 mm water
    (Fig. 2a). For RDI, with the requirement of relative yield higher than 0.8 and
    relative WUE not less than 0.65, 20 combinations of PWDI thresholds were screened
    out from the 729 scenarios in Nexp. 2 with total water consumption of only 329.4–367.2 mm
    (Table 3 and Fig. 5b). Specially, option 1 (PWDI threshold combination: 0.1–0.4–0.6)
    showed the highest relative yield of 0.85 with a relative WUE of 0.65, while option
    17 (0.2–0.4–0.7) provided the highest relative WUE of 0.69 with a relative yield
    of 0.81. Among the 20 options, the average PWDI threshold during the early, middle
    and later periods increased from 0.14 to 0.49 and then to 0.66 (Table 3). This
    indicates that keeping a relatively slight water stress extent during the seedling
    and jointing stages while a relatively serious stress extent during the filling
    and mature stages is beneficial for maize to obtain high yield and WUE together
    (Doorenbos and Kassam, 1979, Igbadun et al., 2007). Table 3. The thresholds of

    the principle and procedure to schedule smart irrigation were demonstrated through
    numerical simulation. The target, in practice, should be logically determined
    according to actual conditions such as availability and cost of water resources
    by optimizing crop yield and WUE. Due to the opposite trends changing with PWDI
    thresholds, the irrigation scheme which would lead to equal relative values of
    yield and WUE (i.e. the intersections of the two curves) might be the optimal,
    such as the PWDI threshold of 0.54 in Nexp.1 resulting in same relative yield
    and WUE of 0.65 (Fig. 6). In this manner, 45 optimal PWDI threshold combinations
    were found for RDI in Nexp. 2, where the relative values of yield and WUE always
    ranged between 0.64 and 0.74 (Fig. 5b). These results indicated that, based on
    a validated model coupling crop growth and soil water transport, scheduling irrigation
    to optimize crop yield and WUE through numerical simulation should be reliable
    and feasible. The numerical simulation method, in contrast to experimental or
    machine learning techniques, has been proven efficient, affordable, low labor
    requirements, and has great potential in making decisions regarding precision
    irrigation to alleviate effects of spatial variability (Navarro-Hellín et al.,
    2016, Fontanet et al., 2020). Different from previously published numerical simulation
    methods for scheduling irrigation (Dabach et al., 2013, García Morillo et al.,
    2017, Fontanet et al., 2020), the significant advantage of the method proposed
    in this study lies in supplying the direct relationships between irrigation scheduling
    (PWDI threshold, timing and amount of irrigation) and results regarding crop growth,
    yield and water use, which is the basis of knowledge-driven smart irrigation scheduling.
    Necessary for simulation of soil water transport (Eq. (6)), initial soil water
    conditions are usually measured through sampling or sensors such as in this study.
    In practice, it might be feasible to simulate soil water flow and subsequently
    schedule smart irrigation according to an estimated rather than measured initial
    soil water profile. Before a growing season, field water capacity might be assumed
    as the initial condition after a full water input event (rainfall or irrigation),
    and then the error of soil water transport simulation resulting from the assumption
    would weaken gradually or even disappear through a self-recovering duration (Raes
    et al., 2008). Nevertheless, the numerical simulation method should be further
    evaluated and improved by considering the effects of variable environmental conditions
    (Jalota et al., 2010) and agricultural production technologies such as fertigation
    and cultivation (Thomson and Ross, 1996). In this study, numerical simulation
    was conducted in only one growing season when rainfall was eluded by a movable
    rain-shelter. The effects of intra and inter annual climatic variability on simulated
    results regarding irrigation scheduling, yield and WUE should be further evaluated.
    In addition, irrigation scheduling was optimized in this study according to several
    user-defined alternatives. Although the recommended irrigation scheduling might
    be the best among the limited options, it was unlikely the global optimal (Shang
    and Mao, 2006), which would be achieved through combining the coupled soil water
    transport and crop growth model with a professional optimization model such as
    genetic algorithm (Singh and Panda, 2013, Singh, 2014b). 4. Conclusions Taking
    drip-irrigated and film-mulched maize in a field experiment as an example, a coupled
    model of crop growth and soil water transport was established, validated and applied
    to numerically simulate the quantitative relationship between PWDI threshold and
    the corresponding yield and WUE for scheduling smart irrigation. To make an efficient
    smart irrigation scheme controlled by a constant or variable PWDI threshold, both
    yield and WUE should be designed to consider actual conditions such as availability
    and cost of water resources by coordinating the two targets. Irrigation schemes
    leading to equal relative values of yield and WUE might be optimal. Compared to
    the deficit irrigation based on a constant PWDI threshold, RDI with thresholds
    that varied among growth stages was superior in enhancing WUE. The numerical simulation
    technique appears to be a strong potential alternative to experimental means or
    machine learning techniques for knowledge-based irrigation scheduling, with inherent
    advantages in alleviating the effects of spatial variability. However, further
    study is needed to enhance simulation accuracy by considering the effects of variable
    environmental conditions, physiological response mechanisms to water stress and
    agricultural production technologies, and to optimize irrigation scheduling by
    introducing a professional optimization model. Declaration of Competing Interest

    Excerpt : Water uptake coefficient per unit root length is often assumed as a
    constant in the root zone, indicating a linearly proportional relationship between
    root water uptake rate and root length density under optimal water conditions
    (Feddes et al., 1978; Wu et al., 1999). Based on this hypothesis and a large number
    of available experimental data regarding root length density, the generalized
    quantitative description of NRLD as Eq. (1) (Zuo et al., 2013; Ning et al., 2015,
    2019) was used to represent the distribution of root uptake activity in many previous
    studies (Shi et al., 2015, 2020, 2021), as well as in this study. However, research
    has shown that not all roots have uptake function, and the uptake activities of
    roots or various parts are different from each other. Show abstract Crop yield

    Excerpt : Both crop yield and WUE are found to change with changing PWDI thresholds.
    The relationships, usually obtained through irrigation experiments (Irmak et al.,

    simulations (Shi et al., 2021), can be used to optimize the PWDI threshold, whether
    chosen as constant throughout the growth season or variable according to artificially
    pre-designed growth stages. However, due to the limited experimental conditions
    or simulation scenarios, the thresholds would represent a local optimum under
    those pre-designed conditions or scenarios, but not a global optimum for all possible
    situations. Show abstract View all citing articles on Scopus View Abstract © 2021

    Abstract This paper presents a scheme for applying two-stage explicit stochastic
    optimization to seasonal irrigation scheduling. It is assumed that an ensemble
    of weather forecasts (scenarios) is available. At each decision point during the
    season up to multi-objective optimization problems are solved by assuming a specific
    scenario for the immediate decision period and all possible scenarios for the
    subsequent periods. The irrigation schedule selected for implementation during
    the immediate decision period is the one that produces the highest worst-case
    yield, which mimics the traditional risk-adverse farmers’ strategy. The procedure
    is illustrated for a maize crop at Davis, CA, modeled with DSSAT. The optimization
    was performed for ten years, using as forecasts the weather recorded on the previous
    15 years. The proposed approach yielded consistently results that were very close
    to truly optimal, i.e. results that could have been obtained if perfect weather
    forecasts were available at the beginning of the season. These results were better
    than those obtained with a deterministic approach that relied on the same data
    and decision rules but used only a single forecast that consisted of the average
    weather of the 15 previous years. However, these improved results came at the
    expense of a significant increase of the computation burden. In addition to the
    overall improved performance in terms of yield, a main advantage of the stochastic
    approach is that, since the solution for implementation is selected from an ensemble
    of solutions, it is possible to develop a selection strategy that mimics farmers’
    traditional selection strategy. This could prove a key factor toward the adoption
    of decision support tools that involve model-based optimization. Previous article

    modeling 1. Introduction Irrigation is a critical input for a wide variety of
    crops and irrigation scheduling is one of the many management decisions that farmers
    have to make while facing significant uncertainties about several factors, such
    as prices and, most importantly, weather. Farmers tend to be conservative in the
    sense that they implement strategies that reduce the risk of losses in poor years
    at the expense of overall reduced productivity (Jones et al., 2000). It is generally
    accepted that improved weather forecasts, both at the short-term and long-term
    (seasonal) levels, are keys to improving irrigation management. This claim was
    recently supported by the work of An-Vo et al. (2019) who quantified the benefit
    that could be expected from using forecasts of different quality levels for managing
    sugarcane irrigation. Optimal or sub-optimal irrigation schedules can be determined
    by the so-called simulation-optimization approach (Singh, 2014) in which weather
    forecasts are combined with a mathematical model that describes the crop response
    to water availability and other environmental variables such as temperature, sun
    radiation, fertilizer availability, etc. Most of the early works relied on custom
    models which were developed as part of the optimization study itself (e.g. Ahmed
    et al., 1976; Sunantara and Ramírez, 1997; Ganji et al., 2006; Alizadeh and Mousavi,
    2013; Vico and Porporato, 2013). These models included only very crude representations
    of crop development and response to stress. Furthermore, the validity of these
    models was not always established using experimental data. In recent years, irrigation
    optimization is increasingly conducted using much more complex soil-crop-atmosphere
    models that have been developed in unrelated studies and have been thoroughly
    tested and validated (e.g. AquaCrop (Raes et al., 2009; Steduto et al., 2009),
    RZWQM2 (Ma et al., 2006), CERES (DeJonge et al., 2012) (both embedded in DSSAT,
    Jones et al., 2003; Hoogenboom et al., 2019), STICS (Brisson et al., 1998, 2003),
    SWAP (Kroes et al., 2000, 2009))). This simulation-optimization approach can be
    implemented using either deterministic (e.g. Wang and Cai, 2009; Linker and Sylaios,
    2016; Linker et al., 2018) or stochastic forecasts (Wang and Cai, 2009; Cai et
    al., 2011; Jamal et al., 2018, 2019). Using deterministic forecasts has the obvious
    advantage of reducing drastically the computation burden and Linker and Sylaios
    (2016) and Linker et al. (2018) have shown that close-to-optimal results can be
    achieved. Still, this approach is overly simplistic and, as emphasized by Pannell
    et al. (2000), irrigation strategies that are optimal under average conditions
    may yield poor results in extreme years. Furthermore, such an approach bears little
    resemblance to the risk-advert strategies traditionally adopted by farmers. By
    contrast, as shown in the present study, stochastic approaches are suitable for
    developing risk-adverse management strategies which are conceptually much closer
    to farmers’ reasoning, and are therefore more likely to be of practical interest.
    Stochastic approaches involve an ensemble of forecasts, each forecast corresponding
    to a scenario. Jamal et al. (2018) described three types of stochastic approaches
    relevant to irrigation management: (1) The implicit approach, according to which
    each of the scenarios is optimized independently and some heuristics is used to
    choose the “best” solution. This approach is obviously the easiest to implement
    since it only requires solving deterministic problems independently of each other.
    However, this approach fails to represent adequately the true stochastic nature
    of the problem. Also, the heuristics adopted to select the “best” solution is
    a critical factor which is left completely to the user discretion; (2) The one-stage
    explicit approach, according to which a single set of decisions is sought for
    all scenarios simultaneously. In other word, this approach is seeking the solution
    that will be as good as possible regardless of which scenario actually materializes.
    Such an approach is required in applications where the user has to make all decisions
    at once and does not have the opportunity to update decisions as time unfolds.
    With respect to irrigation management this approach is overly conservative since
    it is reasonable to expect that the farmer will revise his irrigation schedule
    throughout the season based on past weather and/or updated forecasts; (3) The
    two-stage explicit approach, which addresses the drawback of the explicit one-stage
    approach by requiring that only the immediate decision be the same for all scenarios,
    while future decisions can be scenario-dependent. This approach relies on the
    (realistic) assumption that at any given point in time, although the farmer has
    an irrigation blueprint for the whole season, he only needs to implement the immediate
    decision (for instance the irrigation for the coming week) while future decisions
    will be re-adjusted at the next decision point if necessary. Jamal et al. (2018)
    illustrated the superiority of the two-stage explicit approach on a small case
    study with a chickpea crop. The present work extends the work of Jamal et al.
    (2018) in three ways: (1) while Jamal et al. (2018) considered single-objective
    optimization problems (maximizing profit), in the present work we adopt a multi-objective
    approach; (2) the selection of the best strategy is inspired from risk analysis
    rather than average performance as in Jamal et al. (2018); and (3) the present
    study involves a much larger number of scenarios (15 vs. 3) and the performance
    of the proposed approach is analyzed over 10 years rather than a single year.
    2. Description of the procedure From a computation perspective, the key element
    of the proposed procedure is a multi-objective problem which is solved repeatedly
    using different forecasts. A detailed description of the procedure can be found
    in Linker and Kisekka (2017) and only a brief description is provided here for
    completeness. It is assumed that a mathematical model describing the crop development
    and soil water content (such AquaCrop, DSSAT or SWAP) is available. The season
    is split into periods and irrigation is managed according to soil water depletion:
    whenever the water content in the root zone falls below a certain level (denoted
    for period ), a pre-defined amount of water is supplied. The irrigation thresholds
    are the decision variables of the optimization problem, the objective being to
    maximize yield while minimizing irrigation, or mathematically (1) where denotes
    the yield predicted by the model and is the number of irrigation events, which
    is a direct result of the thresholds adopted. The optimization can be repeated
    several times during the season to account for the actual weather being different
    from the forecasts (Linker and Sylaios, 2016). Compared to a simpler single-objective
    approach (e.g. profit) such as in Jamal et al. (2018), this multi-objective approach
    has the advantage that it does not require assumptions about the crop value or
    water price. However, solving (1) by itself does not provide an implementable
    solution and an additional criterion is needed for selecting one of the optimal
    solutions (Pareto combinations) as the one for implementation. As discussed in
    Linker et al. (2018) although one can select the solution corresponding to the
    highest yield or some desired target yield, it is preferable to use marginal yield
    as selection criterion: the solution selected is the one achieving the highest
    yield for which the marginal yield, defined here as additional yield per mm of
    irrigation, is above some predefined value. The procedure outlined above provides
    an implementable solution in the deterministic case, and the pseudo-code of its
    extension to the stochastic case is shown in Fig. 1. It is assumed that an ensemble
    of weather forecasts is available, corresponding to possible scenarios. The concept
    is as follows: (I) Solve Eq. (1) using some scenario as forecasts until the end
    of the season (II) Select the optimal irrigation threshold for the current decision
    period and extract the corresponding irrigation events (III) Implement the irrigation
    events obtained in II over the current decision period assuming that the actual
    weather corresponds to some scenario , and re-optimize the future decisions assuming
    this scenario until the end of the season. (IV) Store the performance index of
    combination in element of matrix (size ) whose entries can be interpreted as “performance
    if the current decision is made assuming that scenario will occur, but in practice
    scenario occurs”. The most obvious performance index consists of yield or water
    use efficiency, but other user-defined quantitative index would be equally suitable.
    The whole procedure is repeated assuming another scenario in (I) until all scenarios
    have been exhausted. (V) Analyze the performance matrix in a row-wise fashion
    to determine which is the best decision for the current period. Here, rather than
    to base the selection on mean performance, we suggest to implement a selection
    procedure inspired from risk analysis. For instance, select the decision which
    has the lowest probability of resulting in a performance index (e.g. yield) below
    a certain threshold; or Select the decision for which the cumulative probability
    corresponding to some performance index is the highest. (VI) Implement the irrigation
    events corresponding to the selected scenario for the current period and advance
    to the next decision point. In the simulation example below this Step consists
    of running a simulation with the model that represents the crop and the actual
    weather and irrigation events until the next decision point. In practice the same
    irrigation events would be implemented in the field. Download : Download high-res

    approach. The procedure described above requires solving the multi-objective optimization
    problem defined in Eq. (1) times, which may become prohibitive computation-wise
    (each optimization requires about 1 min.). However, it is possible to reduce significantly
    the number of optimizations actually performed by realizing that Step III can
    be bypassed if the current state of the system and previous decisions are similar
    to that of a scenario previously investigated. For instance, let us consider that
    when assuming scenario for the optimal decision is “no irrigation” during period
    and the expected system state at is . Let us further assume that when assuming
    scenario for the optimal decision is also “no irrigation” during period and the
    expected state at is . In such a case the optimal decisions for periods will be
    the same regardless of which weather is assumed for period . In other words, Step
    III does not need to be repeated, and one can simply copy the performance indices
    stored in the ith row of into the jth row. Strictly speaking, such bypass is valid
    only if and are strictly equal. In practice this requirement can be relaxed and
    the computations are bypassed if is similar enough to . Obviously this requires
    that the user defines a similarity metric and a corresponding similarity threshold.
    Another issue that requires attention is how to define the system state. Again,
    strictly speaking this includes all the variables described by differential equations
    in the model. Depending on the actual model this can include canopy-related variables
    such canopy cover (or leaf area index), biomass or harvestable material, as well
    as water content throughout the whole soil profile. In practice for the purpose
    of the similarity test described above, the system state can be defined in a less
    rigorous fashion, considering for instance a single variable (e.g. total available
    water content in root zone) to describe the soil state. This is further discussed
    in the example below. 3. Illustrative example 3.1. Case study description The
    procedure is illustrated for a maize crop in Davis, CA. The simulations were performed
    using DSSAT (Jones et al., 2003; Hoogenboom et al., 2019) with the crop parameter
    values corresponding to cultivar PIO3475 and a Yolo soil (See Appendix A for details).
    The sowing date was set to Julian Day 108, and 40 mm of water was applied at each
    irrigation event. The simulations were performed using weather records retrieved
    from NASA Prediction Of Worldwide Energy Resources repository (https://power.larc.nasa.gov/data-access-viewer/)
    for years 1991−2015. The proposed procedure was tested for years 2006–2015, using
    in each case the weather recorded in the previous 15 years as forecast scenarios
    ( ). After solving the multi-objective problem defined in Eq. (1), the optimal
    solution selected was that corresponding to a minimal yield of 14 t/ha and marginal
    yield of 24 kg/mm. If yield of 14 t/ha was not achievable, the combination corresponding
    to the highest yield was selected. Step III was by-passed if the biomass, soil
    extractable water and irrigation corresponding to the solution selected in Step
    II were within 5% of those obtained with a previous scenario. Yield was adopted
    as performance index in Step IV, and in Step V the irrigation schedule selected
    for implementation was that of the scenario for which the expected worst-case
    yield was the highest. More specifically, the following decision logic was implemented:
    1 Construct the matrix by reordering in increasing order the yields excepted for
    each scenario (each row of matrix ). 2 Initialize . 3 Scan the qth column of and
    extract the row(s) corresponding to the maximum value. 4 If only one row is extracted
    in Step 3, select the corresponding scenario. Otherwise, eliminate from the rows
    that do not correspond to the maximum value, increase to and go back to Step 3
    (unless the last column has been reached, in which case select any of the remaining
    scenarios). The decision points were selected by taking into account the growth
    stages defined in DSSAT as well as basic understanding of maize phenology. More
    specifically, the growth stages identifiable from the DSSAT outputs file. OPG
    are listed in Table 1. Although additional growth stages are reported in the DSSAT.
    OME file, these can not be readily identified in the. OPG file (which reports
    only switching between the growth stages listed in Table 1) and were not used
    in this study. These “switching points” between growth stages are natural candidates
    as decision points since in DSSAT a specific irrigation threshold can be specified
    for each growth stage. However, using only these would have resulted in unreasonably
    long periods between adjustments in several cases (up to ∼40 days). Therefore,
    additional decision points were included “dynamically” throughout the season so
    that the interval between adjustments never exceeded 15 days between flower initiation
    and 75 % silking (Growth stages 02 and 03) and after the beginning of grain filling
    (Growth stage 04). No optimization was performed during the last 20 days of the
    season. All computations were performed in Matlab using custom scripts that generated
    the inputs files required by DSSAT, invoked DDSAT and imported the output files
    generated by DSSAT. Technical details about the implementation can be found in
    Appendix B. The optimization problem formulated in Eq. (1) was solved using the
    procedure described in Herrero et al. (2007). Table 1. Growth stages identifiable

    Detailed results for year 2006 This section presents some of the intermediate
    results in order to illustrate the decision process and the evolution of the expectations
    over time. Until Day 142 (fourth decision point) the optimization was “no irrigation”
    regardless of the expected weather (details not shown). On Day 142, assuming Scenario
    #1 (weather of 1991) until the end of the season led to planning irrigation on
    Day 150 and Day 156 (and more beyond Day 157, which was the next decision point),
    with a corresponding seasonal irrigation of 600 mm and yield of 13.06 t/ha. The
    simulation was then advanced to Day 157 using these irrigation events and the
    weather of Scenario #2, and the optimization was re-evaluated on Day 157 assuming
    the weather of Scenario #2 until the end of the season. The expected seasonal
    irrigation and yield were 560 mm and 16.39 t/ha, respectively. This process was
    repeated using the weather of Scenarios #3-#10, leading to the results summarized
    in Table 2. After rolling-back to Day 142, the whole procedure was repeated assuming
    Scenario #2 (resp. #3, #4, … #10) from that day on. The results were concatenated
    into the matrix (expected yield), which was sorted to create the matrix shown
    in Table 3. Notice that Scenarios #11 and #15 let to decisions and states similar
    to Scenario # 7 so that the computations were by-passed and the values of Scenario
    #7 were simply copied in the corresponding rows for completeness. It can be seen
    that the worst-case scenario yield (leftmost column) was the highest if selecting
    the irrigation schedule of Scenarios #1 or #3. According to the decision logic
    described above, the analysis then progressed to the second column of (considering
    only the non greyed-out value). This second-to-worst yield was not informative
    and the analysis progressed to the third column of . Here a single maximum was
    identified (14.14 t/ha), which led to selecting for implementation the irrigation
    schedule obtained assuming the weather of Scenario #3 during the current decision
    period. Note that selecting the decision leading to the highest yield or highest
    average yield would have led to selecting a different irrigation schedule (the
    one corresponding to Scenario #14 and #4, respectively). Table 2. Yield and seasonal

    led to selecting the corresponding scenario for implementation. Table 4 shows
    the matrix created at the next decision point (Day 157). Notice that the computations
    were bypassed for five scenarios: #6, #7, #10, #14 and #15, which were similar
    to Scenarios #2, #4, #5, #3 and #12, respectively. Scanning as before led to selecting
    the irrigation schedule generated assuming the weather of Scenario #5 for this
    decision period. Table 4. Table computed on Day 157 (2006) for all possible Scenarios
    for Days 157-171 and Days 172-harvest. Fonts as in Table 3. Table 5 summarizes
    the results for the whole 2006 season and shows at each decision point the irrigation
    events that will be implemented, as well as the ranges of expected yield and seasonal
    irrigation. The actual final yield was 14.07 t/ha and the corresponding irrigation
    was 560 mm. In Fig. 2a this final result (indicated by ● symbol) is shown relative
    to the approximated crop “water productivity function” obtained by applying the
    deterministic approach described in Linker and Kisekka (2017) with the actual
    weather (◻ symbols and solid line). The * symbol indicates the [irrigation, yield]
    combination that would have been selected if perfect weather forecasts were available,
    i.e. the “perfect optimum” that corresponds to yield of 14 t/ha or more, and marginal
    yield of 24 kg/mm. The result that would be obtained by implementing the same
    deterministic procedure using as forecasts the average weather of the 15 previous
    years is shown by the ▴ symbol (the deterministic optimization was repeated at
    the same decision points as the stochastic procedure to ensure fair comparison).
    It can be seen that the stochastic approach led to a [irrigation, yield] combination
    almost identical to the “perfect optimum”, while the deterministic approach yielded
    a result that was also very close to optimal, but with a slightly lower yield.
    This can be appreciated also in Fig. 2b and c that show the evolution of total
    biomass and yield, as well as cumulative irrigation for all three cases. Non-perfect
    weather forecasts caused the irrigation to start later than if perfect forecasts
    were available. However, when using the stochastic approach irrigation was increased
    during the second half of the season, leading to closing the yield gap (notice
    that total biomass was still lower than under perfect conditions). When using
    the deterministic approach, the irrigation remained lower throughout the season,
    leading to a final lower yield. Table 5. Irrigation events to be implemented and

    types as in (b)). 3.3. Final results for all years The final results for years
    2007–2015 are presented in Fig. 3. The results of deterministic optimization using
    the average weather, and the estimated water productivity function for the same
    year are shown for comparison, similarly to Fig. 2a. The most striking feature
    is the strong influence of the actual weather on the estimated water productivity
    function, which ranges from very low yield almost regardless of irrigation in
    2013 to years in which increasing irrigation by 200 mm increases yield by almost
    40 % (e.g. 2010, 2014). Despite this wide range of environmental conditions, the
    proposed stochastic optimization scheme led consistently to results that were
    very close to optimal, albeit in most cases not the optimal combination that would
    have been selected as optimal if perfect forecasts had been available (● vs *
    symbols). Deterministic optimization using 15-year average weather as forecasts
    also yielded results that were very close to optimal, which is consistent with
    the results reported in Linker and Sylaios (2016). However, Table 6 shows that,
    compared to the benchmark solution obtained with perfect forecasts, the deterministic
    approach resulted in a ten-year average yield that was almost 1 t/ha lower (partially
    offset by an irrigation reduction of 32 mm on average). By comparison, the stochastic
    approach led to a ten-year average yield that was 0.8 t/ha higher than the benchmark
    (with on average 64 mm additional irrigation), due to both higher minimal yield
    and higher maximal yield. Download : Download high-res image (476KB) Download

    the irrigation schedule for implementation was selected automatically in order
    to enable fair comparison between the different methods, it is crucial to remember
    that in practice the farmer would be involved in the decision process. At each
    decision point the farmer would have access to the results of all the combinations
    that have been investigated (i.e. the information presented in Tables 3 and 4)
    and would be able to choose for implementation an irrigation schedule that differs
    from the recommended one if the recommendation does not seem satisfactory. He/she
    could also choose to set a different target yield and repeat the optimization
    procedure. Such decisions should be based, at least partly, on the expected outcome
    of the current strategy, and the ability to predict accurately and reliably yield
    and total irrigation as early as possible is therefore of primary importance.
    Fig. 4 shows at each decision point the range of the expected yield corresponding
    to the selected irrigation strategy (box-plot). The ● symbol on the right axis
    denotes the actual yield. For comparison, the △ symbols show the expected yield
    obtained using the deterministic approach (average weather used as forecasts)
    and the▴ symbol on the right axis denotes the final yield achieved with that approach.
    Fig. 5 presents the information relative to irrigation in a similar fashion. Together
    with Fig. 3 these Figures underscore that although in each year the final result
    obtained with the stochastic approach was very close to optimal, estimating yield
    and irrigation requirements early in the season remained much more challenging.
    Only on three years (2008, 2012, 2015) was the final yield within (or very close
    to) the 25–75 % percentiles interval predicted throughout the season. On two years
    (2009 and 2013) yield was predicted “correctly” only from the 7th decision point
    (around Julian day 180, depending on the weather), while on the other years yield
    was predicted accurately only very close to the end of the season. The uncertainty
    in terms of irrigation was lower (the extent of the 25–75 % percentiles interval
    corresponds to two irrigation events or less most of the time) but the final irrigation
    amount was rarely the one predicted early in the season. Fig. 4, Fig. 5 also show
    that, overall, the deterministic optimization (△ symbols) tended to overestimate
    yield and slightly underestimate irrigation requirements throughout the season.

    challenges The complexity of the proposed approach is without any doubt beyond
    what could be managed by even the most technology-savvy farmers. However, it could
    be readily implemented as a service provided via a web-based platform. Several
    companies already offer web-based platforms that provide farmers with irrigation
    recommendations. At the very least such platforms require that the farmer provides
    the field location and crop properties. The field location is used by the platform
    to locate nearby weather stations that can be accessed remotely, as well as to
    retrieve appropriate weather historical records and forecasts from third-party
    providers. The farmer may also be asked to provide information about the field’s
    soil or, alternatively, the field location can be used to retrieve automatically
    soil properties from soil maps available in web repositories. In order to provide
    irrigation recommendations, most current platforms combine this static information
    with dynamic information such as past irrigation events (either retrieved automatically
    from irrigation controllers or entered manually by the farmer) and the crop status,
    typically obtained by remote sensing (and in some cases proximal sensing). Integrating
    dynamic crop models in the decision process would enable replacing the current
    approach, which is purely responsive to observations, by approaches that take
    into account how the crop is expected to respond to future irrigation decisions.
    As mentioned in the Introduction, a number of dynamic crop models are available
    and these could be readily implemented in a web-based platform. These models typically
    come with sets of default parameter values for a wide variety of common crops,
    which could be retrieved automatically based on the information provided by the
    farmer. Still, such default parameter values are obviously only approximate and
    the main drawback of model-based approaches is that modeling errors affect negatively
    the performance of the overall decision-making process. While in the past this
    seemed to be an insurmountable obstacle that precluded the use of models in real
    applications, thanks to advances in sensing techniques, in particular remote sensing,
    and the development of so-called data assimilation techniques, it is now possible
    to improve models periodically throughout the season (Pauwels et al., 2007; Fang
    et al., 2008; Jégo et al., 2012; Ines et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2013; Jiang et
    al., 2014; Huang et al., 2015, 2019; Linker and Ioslovich, 2017), making model-based
    approaches much more attractive. Embedding such a data assimilation scheme within
    a model-based optimization framework was beyond the scope of the present study
    but such work is currently in progress. Conceptually, the idea is that when reaching
    the next decision point (Step VI in Fig. 1), all the soil water content and/or
    canopy measurements available till that point are used, together with the actual
    weather, to improve the model before going back to Step I and repeating the optimization.
    The second drawback of model-based approaches is that they require assumptions
    about the uncontrollable inputs that drive the system, weather in the present
    case. The present study focused on this issue, namely dealing explicitly with
    the imperfectness of the weather forecasts in a stochastic fashion. In terms of
    the information required from the farmer in order to implement a stochastic model-based
    approach rather than a deterministic one, the change would be minimal. In particular,
    the same basic input information would be required, namely the field location,
    crop type, and preferably soil profile. Most of the changes would occur “behind
    the scene” unbeknownst to the farmer and without requiring his involvement. Rather
    than accessing a single weather forecast as in the deterministic case, the platform
    would access a forecasts ensemble (a common product of weather forecasting services)
    or use several years of historical records as forecasts surrogates as done in
    the example above (or a combination of both). The farmer’s involvement would be
    required only in order to define the criterion for selecting the decision for
    implementation (Step V in Fig. 1), which should be done at least once at the beginning
    of the season. However, as noted above, the farmer would have access to the expected
    outcome of all the scenarios that were investigated and, although this is not
    strictly required, he/she should be encouraged to review the platform recommendations
    in a critical fashion, taking into account factors not included in the automated
    analysis. Compared to the deterministic approach, the main drawback of the stochastic
    approach is its high computational cost. Whereas the deterministic approach requires
    solving the optimization problem defined in Eq. 1 only once at each decision point,
    and could provide recommendations in a virtually instantaneous fashion, straightforward
    implementation of the stochastic approach would require solving the same problem
    times (225 times in the example above). The by-passing procedure described above
    reduced this number by about half, but the computing burden was still far from
    being comparable to that of the deterministic approach. Whether this additional
    complexity is justified in economic terms will have to be determined on a location/crop
    combination basis. Still, considering that the whole procedure runs unattended,
    this is not a concern for the end-user but rather for the service provider who
    should make sure that adequate computing resources are available if the platform
    is to provide the service to a large number of clients. Finally, it must be noted
    that although this study was conducted having in mind farmers as end-users, the
    proposed approach could potentially be of interest for water managing authorities
    as well. In this case the procedure could be used to estimate the water requirements
    of various crops under different weather scenarios, assuming that all farmers
    would manage irrigation according to some pre-defined strategy. The computations
    could be repeated several times during the season (not necessarily linked to specific
    crop developmental stages) in order to reassess water requirements forecasts taking
    into account actual past weather and water use. Clearly, this would be possible
    only for crops for which suitable models are available (which unfortunately does
    not include tree crops at the moment). Furthermore, having to perform the computations
    for a large number of crop/soil combinations would present significant computational
    challenges that will need to be addressed in future studies. 5. Conclusion A scheme
    for applying two-stage explicit stochastic optimization to seasonal irrigation
    scheduling has been developed and illustrated for a maize crop modeled with DSSAT.
    This approach yielded consistently results that were very close to truly optimal
    results, i.e. results that could have been obtained if perfect weather forecasts
    were available at the beginning of the season. These results were better than
    those obtained with a deterministic approach that relied on the same data and
    decision rules but considered only a single weather forecast consisting of the
    previous 15 years average. However, these improved results came at the expense
    of a significant increase of the computation burden. The trade-off between improved
    performance in terms of irrigation management and yield on the one hand, and computation
    burden on the other hand, will be a function of the crop and location (weather
    variability) and deciding whether the improved performance is worth the additional
    burden will have to be determined on a case-by-case basis. Regardless of the improved
    performance in terms of yield, a main advantage of the stochastic approach is
    that, since the irrigation schedule for implementation is selected from an ensemble
    of solutions, it is possible to develop a selection strategy that mimics farmers’
    traditional selection strategy. This could prove a key factor toward the adoption
    of decision support tools that involve model-based optimization. Funding The funding

    several modes of irrigation management, the ones relevant to the present work
    being irrigation events on specific dates supplied by the user (“D” mode) or irrigation
    triggered at specific thresholds. In the later case, the amount of water supplied
    at each irrigation can be set a priori (“W” mode) or calculated to replenish soil
    water to a desired level (“P” mode). In both cases a specific irrigation threshold
    can be supplied for each growth stage. This work used a slightly modified version
    of DSSAT provided by Dr. C. Porter in which user-specified irrigation events and
    irrigation thresholds can be combined in “P” mode or “W” mode. In this version
    the irrigation thresholds are ignored until the last user-supplied irrigation
    event. Afterward, irrigation is determined automatically based on the thresholds
    as in regular “P” and “W” modes. Since in DSSAT each threshold is associated with
    a specific growth stage but the optimization performed in this study was not restricted
    to take place at the beginning of growth stages, a dummy 1 mm irrigation event
    was included on the day preceding the optimization day unless an actual irrigation
    event took place on that day. In this manner the actual irrigation events were
    used until day while irrigation thresholds were used for the rest of the season.
    This is illustrated in Fig. A1 which shows an excerpt of a DSSAT. SNX file used
    for optimization on day 189: 40 mm irrigation events were implemented on specific
    days until Day 186, a dummy irrigation event was introduced on Day 188, and, starting
    on Day 189, 40 mm irrigation events were generated automatically according to
    the thresholds defined under the “@N IRRIGATION” header. The dummy irrigation
    event was deleted after completing the optimization. Download : Download high-res

    stochastic dynamic programming to irrigation scheduling in order to decide water
    application according to varying rain, temperature, crop growing stage, etc, though

    scheduling is necessary for sustainable development of irrigated agriculture.
    However, optimal irrigation scheduling is a nonlinear problem with many competing

    and wet year, respectively. Keywords: simulation–optimization model; climate uncertainty;
    maize; irrigation; bootstrap resampling technique 1. Introduction In the face
    of increased competition for water resources, optimal irrigation scheduling is
    necessary for the sustainable development of irrigated agriculture. Irrigated
    agriculture faces challenges of reduced water and land resources because of increased
    urbanization, industrial development, the need to protect the environment, requirements
    for a better quality of life, and many others. Therefore, agriculture must utilize
    water resources more efficiently while meeting other necessary objectives. Irrigation
    scheduling is a key element in on-farm irrigation water management and is therefore
    an important consideration in this endeavor. However, optimal irrigation scheduling
    is not a trivial problem because it is a nonlinear problem with many competing
    and conflicting objectives and constraints. It is further influenced by many factors
    in the soil–plant–atmosphere system, and the best solution for any particular
    case has to be found from a very large number of other possible solutions, thus
    requiring a systematic means for locating it [1]. Field experiments conducted
    to establish crop yield response to irrigation amount and timing require much
    time and resources. Simple empirical models such as that of Doorenbos and Kassam
    [2] have been applied to estimate crop yield response to irrigation water but
    these models are often only applicable to sites where they were derived. Dynamic
    crop simulation models which are based on current understanding of crop physiological
    responses to environmental variables can simulate crop development and yield more
    realistically than simple empirical models. After calibration, these models are
    a more cost-effective means for evaluating crop yield response to irrigation under
    various field conditions than field experiments. While field experiments are important
    and cannot be done away with, combining field experiments with dynamic crop modeling
    cannot only reduce the cost of field experiments by narrowing down viable strategies
    to test, but can also enrich the field experiment studies by introducing alternatives
    not previously considered for testing. However, many crop simulation models require
    a large number of input parameters, many of which are difficult to measure in
    the field, thereby limiting application of the models to researchers who are more
    familiar with the required input parameters and leaving out farmers and other
    stakeholders who are usually not familiar with them. The AquaCrop model [3,4,5,6]
    was developed with a view to balance simplicity, robustness, and accuracy and
    is a more suitable model for farmers to use than the more complex models available.
    Evolutionary optimization algorithms offer many advantages over traditional optimization
    techniques. Their capability to link with simulation models makes them particularly
    attractive for many applications. Genetic algorithms, a type of evolutionary optimization
    algorithm, has been applied in many optimal irrigation scheduling studies. Recent
    studies include Jamal et al. [7], who presented a real-time decision support modeling
    framework for irrigation scheduling using probabilistic seasonal weather forecasts,
    a crop simulation model, and genetic algorithms. Li et al. [8] presented a simulation–optimization
    model for irrigation scheduling of spring wheat under uncertainty using the AquaCrop
    model, genetic algorithms, and a bootstrap technique for resampling climate data.
    Wen et al. [9] used a crop water production function, a soil water balance model,
    and genetic algorithms to optimize irrigation scheduling of spring wheat in northwest
    China. Lalehzari et al. [10] combined the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm
    II (NSGA-II), particle swarm optimization algorithm, and the Doorenbos and Kassam
    [2] crop production function to evaluate optimal cropping patterns, allocation
    of surface and groundwater resources for irrigation, and irrigation scheduling.
    They expressed the problem they were solving as a constrained biobjective optimization
    problem. The value in combining an optimization algorithm with a crop simulation
    model to solve irrigation scheduling optimization problems was demonstrated by
    Ioslovich et al. [11] who showed that an optimization model consisting of a heuristic
    optimization algorithm and AquaCrop model generated an irrigation schedule that
    gave a higher crop yield than one which was generated by the AquaCrop model alone
    even though the irrigation amounts were roughly the same. Other recent studies
    on optimal irrigation scheduling include Rafiee and Shourian [12], who presented
    a simulation–optimization approach for combining the Soil and Water Assessment
    Tool (SWAT) with the harmony search algorithm to find optimal irrigation and cropping
    patterns. Linker [13] also presented a model-based optimization procedure for
    optimal allocation of cropping areas and water by utilizing the AquaCrop model
    and a constrained particle swarm optimization solver. Their procedure first determined
    optimal land and water allocations, and then optimal crop yield and irrigation
    scheduling. In that study, the AquaCrop model was not used within the main optimization
    procedure but only to generate water productivity functions which were the ones
    used in the main optimization procedure. Linker and Sylaios [14] presented an
    efficient model-based procedure for generating near-optimal irrigation schedules
    for real-time applications utilizing the AquaCrop model and the epsilon-moga evolutionary
    algorithm. Linker et al. [15] presented an optimization scheme for generating
    sub-optimal irrigation schedules for three crops using the AquaCrop model and
    the OptQuest Nonlinear Program (OQNLP) solver in combination with the qlcAssign
    procedure for global nonlinear search. Xu et al. [16] presented a procedure for
    optimal allocation of irrigation water resources to multiple crops and multiple
    agricultural subareas using a fuzzy random simulation-based particle swarm optimization
    and an empirical crop production function. In their study, the decision variables
    were the area and irrigation water volume allocated to each crop in the season,
    and the state variable was the available water stored in the reservoir at any
    period of the season. Seasonal reservoir inflow and rainfall were treated as fuzzy
    random variables. Shan et al. [17] used a water–yield–quality–benefit relationship
    to establish an irrigation scheduling optimization framework. Their model was
    designed to create a balance between yield quantity and quality, and to find optimal
    irrigation schedules for various market conditions. Pereira et al. [18] developed
    a multi-objective model to solve an optimal irrigation water resources allocation
    problem, considering economic, social, and environmental benefits as objectives.
    Nguyen et al. [1] presented a simulation–optimization framework for optimal irrigation
    and fertilizer scheduling. García-Vila and Fereres [19] presented a model to assist
    farmers’ plan cropping patterns and irrigation strategies using the AquaCrop model
    and an economic model under various scenarios of irrigation water constraints,
    agricultural policies, changes in crop product and water prices, and communication
    delays to farmers of seasonal irrigation water allocations. Sadati et al. [20]
    presented a nonlinear programming optimization model with an integrated soil water
    balance to determine optimal reservoir release policies and cropping patterns.
    They solved the model using a genetic algorithm. Li et al. [21] presented an inexact
    fuzzy stochastic simulation–optimization programming model for the optimal irrigation
    water allocation of two water sources. Their model combined a crop water model
    and a field water cycle model with an uncertainty optimization model. Zhai et
    al. [22] used the AquaCrop crop model and entropy-cloud model to develop an irrigation
    scheduling optimization model for rice. Most of the studies cited above treated
    irrigation scheduling optimization as a single objective optimization problem,
    with maximization of net benefits as the most common objective. However, in situations
    when rainfall is insufficient for crop production, achieving a high crop production
    per unit of water used might be a policy that is more likely to be followed than
    one that seeks to merely maximize crop yield or benefit [23]. In this case, optimizing
    crop production per unit of water used will involve both the production and water
    use simultaneously, requiring optimization of both the amount of water used and
    the benefit derived. Therefore, some studies (e.g., [10,14,24]) have considered
    maximization of net benefits or yield, and maximization of relative water use
    efficiency or minimization of total irrigation water used or minimization of the
    total number of irrigations, simultaneously, to achieve this aim. However, some
    risk-averse farmers may not prefer an irrigation schedule that would give them
    the highest expected net benefits and water use efficiency if the risk involved
    is very high. Such farmers may be happy to choose an irrigation schedule with
    low expected net benefits if the risk involved is also lower than one with a high
    expected net benefit but at high risk. Therefore, in such cases it would be useful
    to have risk minimization as an additional objective in the optimization problem.
    Therefore, in this study, irrigation scheduling optimization was treated as a
    multi-optimization problem with maximization of net benefits and water use efficiency
    and minimization of risk as the objectives. The aims of the current study were
    to (1) solve a multi-objective optimization problem for irrigation scheduling
    of maize in north Jiangsu Province of China using four different approaches, (2)
    determine the best performing approach, and (3) use the best approach to determine
    optimal irrigation schedules for a dry, normal, and wet year. All the approaches
    used the AquaCrop model and nondominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III).
    2. Materials and Methods 2.1. The AquaCrop Model The AquaCrop model [4,5,6] simulates
    water-driven plant growth and yield. It is suitable for evaluating the effect
    of irrigation schedules on crop yield. The model calculates the soil water balance,
    considering rainfall, irrigation, capillary rise, runoff, evaporation, transpiration,
    and deep percolation. To simulate plant growth and yield requires climate, soil,
    crop, and field management characteristics to be specified in the model. In the
    model, crop yield is determined from biomass produced via a harvest index. Biomass
    produced is related to plant transpiration via water productivity normalized for
    climate and atmospheric CO2 concentration as: bio 𝑘 =  w ′ × 𝑇 𝑟 𝑘 𝐸 𝑇 𝑜 𝑘 (1)
    where bio 𝑘 is biomass produced on day 𝑘 ; w ′ is the normalized water productivity;
    𝑇 𝑟 𝑘 is plant transpiration on day 𝑘 ; and 𝐸 𝑇 𝑜 𝑘 is reference crop evapotranspiration
    on day 𝑘 . The model calculates canopy cover instead of leaf area index. The canopy
    cover is defined as the fraction of ground covered by the crop canopy when observed
    from above the crop. During the first part of the growth season, canopy cover
    of the crop is modeled as: 𝑐= 𝑐 𝑜 e 𝐺𝐶·𝑘 (2) where 𝑐 is the canopy cover at period
    𝑘 ; 𝑐 𝑜 is canopy cover at 90% seedling emergence; and 𝐺𝐶 is the canopy growth
    coefficient (expressed as fraction per growing degree day (GDD) or per day under
    optimal conditions but adjusted for stresses). During the second half of the plant
    growth, 𝑐 is expressed as: 𝑐= 𝑐 x −( 𝑐 x − 𝑐 𝑜 ) e −𝐺𝐶·𝑘 (3) where 𝑐 x is the
    maximum canopy cover under optimal conditions. Deterioration in green canopy cover
    as a result of leaf senescence is expressed as: 𝑐= 𝑐 x [1−0.05( e 𝐷𝐶 𝑐 x 𝑘 −1)]
    (4) where 𝐷𝐶 is the canopy decline coefficient (in fraction per GDD or per day).
    Transpiration is determined from: 𝑇 𝑟 𝑘 =( 𝑐 ′ ×𝐾𝑐 𝑏 x )𝐸 𝑇 𝑜 𝑘 (5) where 𝑐 ′
    is green canopy cover adjusted for microadvective effects and 𝐾𝑐 𝑏 x is the crop
    coefficient when c = 1. Crop yield is expressed as: 𝑌=𝐻𝐼×𝑏𝑖𝑜 (6) where 𝑌 is crop
    yield; 𝐻𝐼 is harvest index; and 𝑏𝑖𝑜 is biomass. More details on the AquaCrop model
    calculation procedures can be found in the literature (e.g., Hsiao et al. [4],
    Raes et al. [5], Steduto et al. [6], Vanuytrecht et al. [25]). The AquaCrop plug-in
    model version 6.0 was used in the current study to evaluate crop yield. It has
    identical calculation procedures to the standard AquaCrop version program but
    does not have a user interface and is more ideal for applications requiring iterative
    simulations as in the current study. 2.2. The Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm
    III The NSGA-III [20,21] is a multi-objective optimization algorithm based on
    the NSGA-II [24] framework. Multi-objective optimization problems are a feature
    of many real-life problems and optimal irrigation scheduling is not an exception.
    Where the NSGA-II used crowding distance to maintain diversity among population
    members, the NSGA-III uses reference points. Reference points are placed on a
    normalized hyper-plane which is equally inclined to all objective axes, with an
    intercept of one on each axis. To move from one generation to the next, nondominated
    solutions are emphasized as well as solutions associated with the reference points.
    A wide distribution of the reference points on the hyper-plane creates diversity
    in the population members. The total number of reference points is calculated
    as: 𝑟=( 𝐺+ 𝐷 𝑖𝑣 −1 𝐷 𝑖𝑣 ) (7) where 𝑟 is the number of reference points; 𝐺 is
    the number of objectives; 𝐷 𝑖𝑣 is the number of divisions along each objective;
    and () represents the binomial coefficient. The minimum value for each objective
    function ever found in the population is identified to constitute the ideal point.
    The ideal point is then subtracted from the objective values in the population
    set. The extreme point for each objective axis is then identified to constitute
    the 𝐺 -dimensional hyper-plane. The objective values are normalized as: 𝑓 𝑛 𝑤
    (𝑥)= 𝑓 ’ 𝑤 (𝑥) 𝑐 𝑤  for 𝑤=1:𝐺; 𝑥∈ 𝑃 𝑡   (8) where 𝑓 ’ 𝑤 (𝑥)= 𝑓 𝑤 (𝑥)− 𝑣 𝑚𝑖𝑛 𝑤
    , 𝑥∈ 𝑆 𝑡 (9) where 𝑓 𝑤 is the objective value in 𝑃 𝑡 ; 𝑣 𝑚𝑖𝑛 𝑤 is the minimum
    value for each objective function ever found; 𝑃 𝑡 is the parent population at
    the 𝑡 th generation; 𝑆 𝑡 is the new population; 𝑓 𝑛 𝑤 is the normalized 𝑤 th objective;
    and 𝑐 𝑤 is the intercept of the 𝑤 th objective axis and the linear hyper-plane.
    The normalization procedure and creation of the hyper-plane is done at each generation
    using all extreme points ever found from the start of the simulation, thereby
    adaptively maintaining a diversity in the members of 𝑆 𝑡 at every generation.
    After normalizing each objective based on the extent of members in 𝑆 𝑡 , each
    population member is associated with a reference point. A reference line corresponding
    to each reference point on the hyper-plane is defined by joining the reference
    point with the origin. The perpendicular distance of each population member of
    𝑆 𝑡 from each of the reference lines is calculated and the reference point whose
    reference line is closest to a population member in the normalized objective space
    is taken to be associated with the population member. A new population 𝑃 𝑡+1 is
    formed by elitist selection of solutions and by emphasizing solutions closest
    to the reference line of each reference point. An offspring population is then
    created by the usual genetic operators of crossover and mutation, and randomly
    selecting parents from 𝑃 𝑡+1 . The NSGA-III algorithm also requires the usual
    genetic algorithm parameters such as population size, termination criteria, and
    crossover and mutation probabilities. More details on the NSGA-III can be found
    in Deb and Jain [26] and Jain and Deb [27]. 2.3. Ranking Method for Selecting
    Solutions from Pareto Optimal Front A drawback of the Pareto optimality concept
    used in multi-objective optimization algorithms is that Pareto optimal alternatives
    usually make making a selection of one solution difficult. Gogodze [25] proposed
    an approach for selecting one solution from the Pareto optimal front. The approach
    was based on ranking-theory methods used to rank participants in competitive sports
    tournaments. This approach was adopted in the current study. The approach involved
    making a count of the number of times a particular solution was better than the
    other solutions in all objectives and selecting the solution with the largest
    count. The set of all solutions was a union of all Pareto fronts ever found, i.e.,:
    𝐴= ∪ 𝑡 𝑚 𝑡=1 ( 𝐹 1 ) 𝑡 , (10) where 𝐴 is the set of all solutions ( 𝐴 = [ 𝑎 1
    ,…, 𝑎 𝑀 ] ); 𝐹 1 is a set of Pareto front solutions in the 𝑡 th generation; and
    𝑡 𝑚 is the last generation. The total count for solution 𝑎 𝑖 is given by: 𝑐 𝑖
    = ∑ 𝐺 𝑗 𝑐 𝑖𝑗  ∀ 𝑖=1:𝑀, (11) where 𝑐 𝑖 is the total count for solution 𝑎 𝑖 ; 𝑐
    𝑖𝑗 is the count of times 𝑎 𝑖 is superior to other solutions regarding objective
    𝑗 ; 𝐺 is the number of objectives; and 𝑀 is the total number of solutions. 2.4.
    Bootstrap Resampling Theoretical probability distribution functions were found
    to not fit well to reference crop transpiration and rainfall data in this study.
    This result was also observed by Prats and Picó [28]. Therefore, a bootstrapping
    technique was used to generate climate sequences for the model approaches 1 and
    2 in order to simulate climatic uncertainty. A 21-year (1999–2019) record of daily
    historical climate data of the study area was used in the current study. The climate
    data consisted of maximum and minimum temperature (°C), rainfall (mm), average
    air pressure (kPa), average wind speed (m/s), average relative humidity (%), and
    sunshine hours (h). Reference evapotranspiration (ETo) data were calculated according
    to Allen et al. [29]. The climatic data were divided into wet, normal, and dry
    years, according to the annual rainfall distribution. A wet year was considered
    to be one whose annual rainfall was above the third quartile (i.e., wet year >
    third quartile); a normal year was one whose annual rainfall was between the first
    quartile and the third quartile (i.e., first quartile < normal year < third quartile);
    and a dry year was one whose annual rainfall was below the first quartile (i.e.,
    dry year < first quartile). The probabilities of the occurrence of a dry year
    ( 𝑃 1 ), normal year ( 𝑃 2 ), and wet year ( 𝑃 3 ) were estimated using the historical
    climate data. The crop season was divided into 10-day periods. Climate data corresponding
    to each 10-day period from all years in with a particular climate (i.e., dry,
    normal, or wet year) were compiled in a set so that each 10-day period in a season
    with a particular climate had a set of possible climatic values for that climate.
    Within each set, the values were randomly shuffled. To generate dynamic climate
    data for Approaches 1 and 2, the following steps were followed: Step 1: A random
    value 𝑧 was generated from the standard uniform distribution in the open interval
    [0,1]. Step 2: If 𝑧∈[0, 𝑃 1 ] , dry year climate was selected; else if 𝑧∈[ 𝑃 1
    , 𝑃 1 + 𝑃 2 ] , normal year climate was selected; otherwise if 𝑧∈[ 𝑃 1 + 𝑃 2 ,1]
    , wet year climate was selected. Step 3: 10 random whole numbers between 1 and
    total number of values in each 10-day set for the climate selected in Step 2 were
    generated, inclusively, and values whose positions in the sets corresponded with
    these numbers were selected. Step 4: The 10-day weather sets generated in Step
    3 were joined end to end to create seasonal weather. Step 5: Steps 1 to 4 were
    repeated 20 times to create 20 seasons. 2.5. Optimal Irrigation Scheduling Approaches
    A flow chart of the proposed approaches for solving the optimal irrigation scheduling
    problem are shown in Figure 1. Following are the steps followed in each of the
    four different approaches, which are illustrated in Figure 1. Figure 1. Flow chart
    of the four proposed approaches for optimal irrigation scheduling. TMP is temperature
    file, ETo is reference evapotranspiration file, PLU is rainfall file, CLI is climate
    file, NB is net benefit, R is risk, WUE is water use efficiency, D is maximum
    allowable soil water depletion level, NSGA-III is nondominated sorting genetic
    algorithm III, N is no, and Y is yes. Approach 1 Step 1: Maximum number of iterations
    was selected. This was the number of generations through which the solutions would
    evolve to become optimal solutions by the genetic operators of selection, crossover,
    and mutation. Step 2: The population size was selected. This was the number of
    the solutions that would be evolving to become optimal solutions. Step 3: The
    reference points were created. These were used for selecting solutions when moving
    from one iteration to the next. Step 4: Percentage of crossover was selected.
    This was the percentage of the population that would undergo crossover to produce
    new population members or offspring. Step 5: Percentage of mutation was selected.
    This was the percentage of the population that would undergo mutation to produce
    new population members. Step 6: Complete climate files for 20 crop seasons were
    created by the bootstrap resampling of the original climate data and input into
    the AquaCrop model. Step 7: A population of solutions of the size from Step 2
    was randomly generated. Each population member was a vector of real numbers representing
    maximum allowable soil water depletion levels for each 10-day period in the crop
    season. Step 8: A population member from Step 7 was input into the AquaCrop model
    and the AquaCrop model was run to evaluate crop yield and total water use for
    each of the 20 crop seasons from Step 6. Step 9: Results from Step 8 were retrieved
    from the AquaCrop model and used to evaluate the objective function values corresponding
    to the population member (or solution) selected in Step 8. Step 10: Steps 8 and
    9 were repeated for all the population members from Step 7. Step 11: Some population
    members from Step 7 were randomly selected for crossover. Step 12: Steps 8 and
    9 were repeated for offspring from Step 11. Step 13: Some population members from
    Step 7 were selected for mutation. Step 14: Steps 8 and 9 were repeated for new
    members from Step 13. Step 15: Population members were sorted according to nondomination
    and selected for the next iteration. Step 16: In the next iteration, Steps 11
    to 14 were repeated but with the population from Step 15. Step 17: After 20 iterations,
    Step 6 was repeated. Step 18: Steps 11 to 17 were repeated until the total number
    of iterations from Step 1 was completed. Step 19: The ranking method was used
    to find the best solution. Approach 2 Step 1–5: Same as Steps 1–5 in Approach
    1, respectively. Step 6: Current 10-day period of the season for which irrigation
    was being determined was selected. For example, the first period considered at
    the beginning was the first 10-day period of the season. Afterwards, the second
    10-day period was considered. The periods were considered one after the other
    and the next period was not considered unless the current period’s solution was
    determined. Step 7–20: Same as Steps 6–19 in Approach 1, respectively. Step 21:
    The maximum allowable depletion level for the 10-day period from Step 6 was saved
    to a file. Step 22: The actual season climate for the 10-day period from Step
    6 was used to update climate files in Step 7. Step 23: Step 8 was repeated but
    with the allowable depletion level for the period chosen in Step 6 as the given
    value. Step 24: Step 6 was repeated by selecting the next 10-day period. Step
    25: Steps 9 to 24 were repeated until the total number of 10-day periods in the
    season was covered. Approach 3 Steps 1–5: Same as Steps 1–5 in Approach 1, respectively.
    Steps 6: Climate files were created using original climate data and were input
    into the AquaCrop model. Steps 7–16: Same as Steps 7–16 for Approach 1, respectively.
    Steps 17: Steps 11 to 16 were repeated until the total number of iterations from
    Step 1 was completed. Steps 18: The ranking method was used to find the best solution.
    Approach 4 Steps 1–5: Same as Steps 1–5 in Approach 1, respectively. Step 6: Current
    10-day period of the season for which irrigation was being determined was selected.
    Step 7: Climate files were created using original climate data and were input
    into the AquaCrop model. Steps 8–17: Same as Steps 7–16 in Approach 1, respectively.
    Step 18: Steps 12 to 17 were repeated until the total number of iterations from
    Step 1 was completed. Steps 19–24: Same as Steps 20–25 in Approach 2, respectively.
    2.6. Irrigation Scheduling Optimization Problem The multi-objective irrigation
    scheduling optimization problem considered in the paper was expressed as: Find:
    [ 𝐷 1 ,  𝐷 2 ,…, 𝐷 𝑛 ], (12) such that: [−NB,−WUE,R]→min, (13) subject to: ∑ 𝑇
    𝑘=1 𝐼 𝑘 ≤ 𝐼 𝑚 , (14) 𝜃 𝑘 ≥ 𝜃 𝐷 𝑘 𝑘  ∀ 𝑘=1:𝑇,  𝐷 𝑘 ∈[ 𝐷 1 ,  𝐷 2 ,…, 𝐷 𝑛 ], (15)
    0≤ 𝐼 𝑘 ≤ 𝐼 𝑐  ∀ 𝑘, (16) | 𝑑 𝑙 − 𝑑 𝑚 |≥𝛿 ∀  𝑑 𝑙 , 𝑑 𝑚 ∈𝑇; 𝑙≠𝑚, (17) 𝐷 𝐿 ≤ 𝐷 𝑖 ≤
    𝐷 𝑈  ∀ 𝑖=1:𝑛, (18) where [ 𝐷 1 , 𝐷 2 ,…, 𝐷 𝑛 ] are the maximum allowable depletion
    levels (% AW) in the root zone; 𝑛 is the number of 10-day periods in the crop
    season; AW is available water, defined as the difference between field capacity
    and wilting point in the root zone (mm); 𝑁𝐵 is net benefit (RMB/ha), where RMB
    is the currency of the People’s Republic of China; 𝑊𝑈𝐸 is the water use efficiency
    (kg/m3); 𝑅 is the risk (t/ha); 𝑇 is the total number of irrigation days in a season;
    𝐼 𝑘 is irrigation depth on day 𝑘 in the season (mm); 𝐼 𝑚 is the allocated seasonal
    irrigation quota (mm);  𝜃 𝑘 is the soil water content in the root zone (m3/m3);
    𝜃 𝐷 𝑘 𝑘 is the soil water content in the root zone corresponding to allowable
    depletion level 𝐷 𝑘 (m3/m3); 𝐼 𝑐 is irrigation system capacity (mm/day); 𝑑 𝑙 ,
    𝑑 𝑚 are days during the irrigation season on which irrigation is applied; 𝑙,𝑚
    are indices denoting different days in the season; 𝛿 is the allowable irrigation
    interval (days); 𝐷 𝐿 and 𝐷 𝑈 refer to lower and upper bounds set for maximum allowable
    soil water depletion (%); and 𝐷 𝑖 is the maximum allowable depletion level for
    any 10-day period of the season. Approaches 1 and 3 only use the forecasted climate
    in the optimization model. Therefore, the following constraint on climate was
    added for Approaches 1 and 3: 𝜌 𝑘 = 𝜌 𝑓 𝑘  ∀ 𝑘=1:𝑇, (19) where 𝜌 𝑘 is the climate
    used in the optimization model for day 𝑘 and 𝜌 𝑓 𝑘 is the forecasted climate.
    For Approaches 2 and 4, the additional constraints added were: 𝐼 𝑘 = 𝐼 ∗ 𝑘 , ∀𝑘=1:
    𝑘 ∗ −1, (20) 𝜌 𝑘 = ⎧ ⎩ ⎨   𝜌 ∗ 𝑘 , ∀ 𝑘=1: 𝑘 ∗ −1  𝜌 𝑓 𝑘 , ∀ 𝑘= 𝑘 ∗ :𝑇  , (21)
    where 𝑘 ∗ is current day in the season; 𝐼 ∗ 𝑘 is irrigation already applied in
    the season before day 𝑘 ∗ ; and 𝜌 ∗ 𝑘 is observed climate. For Approaches 1 and
    2, 𝑁𝐵 and 𝑊𝑈𝐸 were expressed as: 𝑁𝐵= 𝑆 𝑃 𝑌− 𝑚 0 − 𝑚 1 1000 ∑ 𝑇 𝑘=1 𝐼 𝑘 𝐸 𝑓 − 𝑚
    2 100 ∑ 𝑇 𝑘=1 𝐼 𝑘 𝐸 𝑓 , (22) 𝑊𝑈𝐸= 100 𝑌 ∑ 𝑇 𝑘=1 ( 𝐼 𝑘 + 𝑉 𝑘 ) , (23) where 𝑌 is
    the average crop yield (ton/ha); 𝑆 𝑃 is the selling price of the crop produce
    (RMB/ton); 𝑚 0 is the fixed cost of production (RMB/ha); 𝑚 1 is the cost of irrigation
    water (RMB/m3); 𝑚 2 is the fixed cost of pumping (RMB/mm·ha); 𝐸 𝑓 is the efficiency
    of the irrigation system (%); and 𝑉 𝑘 is the rainfall on day 𝑘 (mm). For Approaches
    3 and 4, 𝑁𝐵 and 𝑊𝑈𝐸 were expressed as: 𝑁𝐵= ∑ 𝑁 𝑐 𝑖=1 ∑ 𝑁 𝑠𝑖 𝑗=1 𝑃 𝑖 𝑁 𝑠𝑖 ⎛ ⎝ ⎜
    ⎜ ⎜ 𝑆 𝑃 𝑌 𝑖𝑗 − 𝑚 0 − 𝑚 1 1000 ∑ 𝑇 𝑘=1 𝐼 𝑘 𝐸 𝑓 − 𝑚 2 100 ∑ 𝑇 𝑘=1 𝐼 𝑘 𝐸 𝑓 ⎞ ⎠ ⎟
    ⎟ ⎟ , (24) 𝑊𝑈𝐸= ∑ 𝑁 𝑐 𝑖=1 ∑ 𝑁 𝑠𝑖 𝑗=1 ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ 100 𝑃 𝑖 𝑌 𝑖𝑗 𝑁 𝑠𝑖 ∑ 𝑇 𝑘=1 ( 𝐼 𝑘
    + 𝑉 𝑘 ) ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ , (25) where subscripts 𝑖,𝑗, and 𝑘 are for climate (dry year,
    normal year, and wet year), season, and day; 𝑁 𝑐 is the number of climate years
    (i.e., wet, normal, or dry year);  𝑁 𝑠𝑖 is the number of crop seasons in the climate
    𝑖 ; 𝑃 𝑖 is the probability of season 𝑗 to be of climate 𝑖 according to the climate
    data; 𝑌 𝑖𝑗 is crop yield from crop season 𝑗 in climate 𝑖 ; and 𝑉 𝑘 is precipitation
    (mm). For all the approaches, risk was expressed as [19]: 𝑅=max{(𝑁𝐵−𝑁 𝐵 𝑈 ),(𝑁𝐵−𝑁
    𝐵 𝐿 )}, (26) where R is risk (RMB) and 𝑁 𝐵 𝑈 ,𝑁 𝐵 𝐿 are net benefits corresponding
    to years with satisfactory and unsatisfactory weather, respectively. Irrigation
    schedules for dry, normal, and wet years were determined according to the following
    steps: Step 1: Optimal 𝐷 was determined for each year having a particular climate.
    Step 2: The optimal 𝐷 obtained was used to evaluate the corresponding optimal
    irrigation schedule in the AquaCrop model for that year. Step 3: The determined
    irrigation schedules were applied to other years with the same climate. Step 4:
    The irrigation schedule which resulted in the best average objective values was
    selected as the irrigation schedule for the climate. 2.7. Case Study The case
    study was of north Jiangsu Province of China (34°17′ N, 117°09′ E, elevation 41
    m). The soil was sandy loam, with mean soil dry bulk density of 1.5 gcm−3, mean
    saturated water content of 0.39 cm3cm−3, mean field capacity (FC) of 0.29 cm3cm−3,
    mean permanent wilting point of 0.12 cm3cm−3, and mean saturated hydraulic conductivity
    of 560 mmd−1 for the 0–120 cm soil layer. The applicability of the AquaCrop model
    to simulate water consumption of summer maize in China has been evaluated by Liu
    and Shen [30] who conducted field experiments at Luancheng Agricultural Ecosystem
    Experimental Station of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and concluded that the
    model could be used to evaluate the water consumption and water use efficiency
    of summer maize in the North China Plain. Ran et al. [31] and Ran et al. [32]
    also showed that with minor adjustments to the model parameters, the AquaCrop
    model could simulate the growth and yield of seed maize in northwestern China
    with acceptable accuracy. Parameter values established by Liu and Shen [30] for
    summer maize were used to calibrate the AquaCrop model used in the current study.
    The crop season considered was from May to mid-August and simulations were performed
    for this period only. The planting date was 1 May. The length of the irrigation
    season was 100 days. The decision variable was a vector of 10 real numbers representing
    maximum allowable soil water depletion levels as percentages of AW. Irrigation
    was to be applied when soil water depletion levels reached these values. The irrigation
    application depth was 25 mm per irrigation during the first 30 days of the season,
    and 50 mm per irrigation afterwards until the end of the season. A constant irrigation
    application depth instead of a variable one presents some management advantages
    for the irrigator. In genetic algorithms, a population size of ~3 times the number
    of variables is recommended, therefore, in this study, the population size was
    30. The number of iterations was 200. No attempt was made to optimize the probabilities
    of crossover and mutation, and they were both given a value of 0.3. A minimum
    irrigation interval ( 𝛿 ) of 5 days was adopted. The maximum allowable seasonal
    irrigation depth ( 𝐼 𝑚 ) was taken as 450 mm. The lower ( 𝐷 𝐿 ) and upper limits
    ( 𝐷 𝑈 ) of maximum allowable soil water depletion levels were taken as 10% and
    40% of AW, respectively. The initial soil water content was assumed to be at 80%
    of field capacity. The price of maize, fixed costs of production, fixed cost of
    irrigation water, variable cost of irrigation water, and efficiency of the irrigation
    system were assumed to be RMB33000/ton, RMB3750/ha, RMB30/ha, RMB0.157/m3, and
    75%, respectively, and were assumed constant. In the climate data, 5 years were
    dry years, 11 years were normal years, and 5 years were wet years. The simulation–optimization
    model was developed and run on the MATLAB platform (MATLAB 2016a). 3. Results
    The four approaches were applied to generate an irrigation schedule for the 2019
    crop season. Therefore, the 2019 crop season climate data were not used in Approaches
    1 and 3 completely, except in Approaches 2 and 4 for updating the climate files
    as the season progressed. Figure 2 shows the minimum and maximum air temperature
    and rainfall for the study area during the 2019 crop season. Figure 2. (a) Daily
    minimum and maximum air temperature in the study area during the 2019 crop season;
    (b) daily rainfall in the study area during the 2019 crop season. Improvement
    in objective value with iteration number for Approach 3, as an example, is shown
    in Figure 3. The shapes of the plots were typical for all the approaches. There
    were many Pareto optimal solutions at each iteration number but only one solution
    was selected at each iteration and these are the ones shown in Figure 3. Generally,
    NB and WUE values increased with iteration number while R values decreased. Pareto
    front optimal solutions are mathematically considered equivalent to each other,
    and one objective cannot improve without causing a corresponding worsening of
    the other objectives. Table 1 shows the allowable depletion levels for the 2019
    crop season as determined using the four different approaches. Figure 3. (a) Variation
    in net benefits with Approach 3 iteration number; (b) variation in risk level
    with Approach 3 iteration number; (c) variation in water use efficiency with Approach
    3 iteration number. Table 1. Optimal depletion levels ( 𝐷 ) as percentages of
    available water for the 2019 crop season. Irrigation schedules were generated
    by applying the allowable depletion levels shown in Table 1 to the 2019 crop season
    and these are shown in Figure 4. Figure 4. (a) Irrigation schedule generated by
    Approach 1 for the 2019 crop season; (b) irrigation schedule generated by Approach
    2 for the 2019 crop season; (c) irrigation schedule generated by Approach 3 for
    the 2019 crop season; (d) irrigation schedule generated by Approach 4 for the
    2019 crop season. Approaches 1–3 all resulted in eight irrigations and a total
    seasonal irrigation depth of 300 mm, while Approach 4 resulted in seven irrigations
    and a total seasonal irrigation depth of 275 mm. Corresponding values for NB,
    WUE, and R for these irrigation schedules are shown in Figure 5. Figure 5. (a)
    Net benefit values for the 2019 crop season achieved by Approaches 1–4; (b) risk
    values for the 2019 crop season achieved by Approaches 1–4; (c) water use efficiency
    values for the 2019 crop season achieved by Approaches 1–4. Approaches 2 and 4
    had the lowest value for R and Approach 4 had the highest value for WUE. Approach
    4 was the best in two objectives (WUE and R). Approach 2 and 3 were the best in
    one objective each, namely, R and NB, respectively. Therefore, under the conditions
    of this study, Approach 4 produced the best results, followed by Approaches 2
    and 3. Approach 4 was used to determine irrigation schedules for a dry, normal,
    and wet year in the study area. Since weather varied between years even among
    those with the same climate, each year’s weather resulted in a unique irrigation
    schedule for the same maximum allowable soil water depletion levels. Moreover,
    Approach 4 resulted in each year having a unique set of optimal allowable soil
    water depletion levels. Each year’s crop seasonal irrigation schedule was tested
    on the other years sharing the same climate. The irrigation schedule resulting
    in the best average objective values was selected as the irrigation schedule for
    that climate. The selection of the best irrigation schedule was done using the
    ranking method. As an example, Figure 6 shows the objective values resulting from
    five unique irrigation schedules determined for the five dry years. For this particular
    example, the irrigation schedule which resulted in the best average objective
    values was the one in the 5th position and it was selected and is shown in Figure
    7a. Shown also in Figure 7 are irrigation schedules for normal and wet year climates,
    determined in a similar manner. Figure 6. (a) Net benefit value for each irrigation
    schedule under a dry year climate; (b) risk value for each irrigation schedule
    under a dry year climate; (c) water use efficiency value for each irrigation schedule
    under a dry year climate. Figure 7. (a) Selected irrigation schedule for the dry
    year climate; (b) selected irrigation schedule for the normal year climate; (c)
    selected irrigation schedule for the wet year climate. A dry year required 11
    irrigations with a total seasonal irrigation depth of 400 mm. A normal year required
    nine irrigations with a total seasonal irrigation depth of 325 mm. A wet year
    required six irrigations with a total seasonal irrigation depth of 200 mm. 4.
    Discussion In this study, a multi-objective irrigation scheduling optimization
    problem was solved using four approaches. The crop which was investigated was
    maize. Figure 3 confirmed the ability of the optimization model to search for
    more optimal solutions as there was a clear trend of objective value improvement
    with an increase in iteration number. The large dip in WUE between iterations
    0 and 10 was due to sub-optimal solutions which applied more water than was necessary.
    As a result, crop yields were adversely impacted because there was poor soil aeration,
    causing a high risk of total crop failure. Figure 2b showed that most of the rainfall
    for the 2019 crop season occurred towards end of July and in August. As a result,
    in Figure 4, none of the approaches recommended irrigation after about July 20.
    This was to maximize the effectiveness of rainfall since maximization of WUE was
    one of the objectives of the optimization problem. The optimal depletion levels,
    such as the ones shown in Table 1, varied with crop season for Approaches 2 and
    4 because of adaption, but were constant for all seasons under Approaches 1 and
    3. These optimal depletion levels were used in the AquaCrop model to determine
    irrigation dates. These depletion levels, as well as preferred irrigation application
    depths, were specified in AquaCrop and, with this information and that of the
    climate, field management, the soil, and the crop, the model was able to generate
    irrigation schedules. The AquaCrop model has a daily time step and simulates the
    soil water balance to determine crop development and final yield. Considering
    Figure 6, Approach 4, which was employed, involved adaption. As a result, for
    each dry year, there was a unique set of optimal depletion levels. This fact,
    and because of weather variation among the dry years, resulted in a different
    irrigation schedule for each year. This was the case for normal and wet years
    as well. The authors hope that this study has demonstrated the usefulness of the
    presented framework for solving a multi-objective optimization problem of irrigation
    scheduling. Only three objectives were considered, namely, maximizing NB and WUE
    and minimizing R. However, other objectives could also have been considered or
    added, such as minimizing end-of-season soil salinity in the root zone, minimizing
    the total number of irrigations in a season, minimizing water losses through runoff
    and deep percolation, etc. The AquaCrop model, which was utilized to represent
    the complex interactions of the soil–water–plant–atmosphere system, could also
    have been replaced by another suitable crop model. This study borrowed from other
    studies and attempted to develop a unique approach for solving a multi-objective
    irrigation scheduling optimization problem. Garg and Dadhich [33] also developed
    a model to optimize deficit levels for a number of crops. However, their study
    incorporated a multiplicative crop water production function of the Doorenbos
    and Kassam [2] type to simulate crop response to water, and only one value of
    the allowable maximum depletion level was determined for the whole season for
    each crop they considered. Li et al. [8] bootstrapped climate data to fit theoretical
    probability distributions to the data. They used the probability distribution
    functions to find parameter intervals. In the current study, Approaches 1 and
    2 utilized the bootstrap resampling technique to generate climate data, but theoretical
    probability distributions were not fitted to the generated data as they were not
    found to fit well to the climate data used, a result also observed by Prats and
    Picó [28]. Interval mathematical programming was also not used to handle uncertainties
    in the climate data. Instead, the approach of Prats and Picó [28] was adopted
    in the current study. Prats and Picó [28] generated climate data by bootstrapping
    original climate data in a Monte Carlo simulation and did not fit a theoretical
    probability distribution function to the generated data. Linker and Kisekka [24]
    presented an approach for optimal irrigation scheduling by optimizing the maximum
    allowable soil water depletion levels. They used CERES-Maize as a surrogate crop
    and the AquaCrop model in the optimization procedure to determine the optimal
    soil water depletion levels, but only used static climate data. Jamal et al. [7]
    also used static climate data in their optimization models. Xu et al. [16] used
    a dynamic simulation model approach to optimize water resource allocation for
    irrigation but they utilized an empirical crop water production function to express
    the relationship between irrigation water amount and crop yield. In the current
    study, Approaches 3 and 4 are similar to the explicit single-stage and explicit
    two-stage approaches presented by Jamal et al. [7] though that study used genetic
    algorithms, the Soil Water Atmosphere Plant (SWAP) model, the concept of aggregation
    periods, and only considered the single objective of maximizing net benefits.
    Anvari et al. [34] presented an approach for optimal irrigation scheduling using
    stochastic dynamic programming. They also divided the crop season into 10-day
    periods and their study considered uncertainty in crop evapotranspiration during
    the season, but they applied a crop water production function of the type presented
    by Doorenbos and Kassam [2] to simulate crop yield response to irrigation. In
    the current study, Approaches 2 and 4 used adaption and historical weather as
    forecasted weather. If reasonably accurate weather forecasts for the next few
    days were available, these could have been incorporated into the model. Approaches
    1 and 3 required much less time to produce results for the whole season than Approaches
    2 and 4. However, since the irrigator would only be concerned with the next few
    days and not the whole season at any given time, Approaches 2 and 4 would be comparable
    with Approaches 1 and 3 in terms of time required to produce results. Moreover,
    for Approaches 2 and 4, historical climate data, which were used as forecast climate
    data for the next 10 days, could be replaced with actual weather forecasts. The
    results obtained in this study for Approach 4, when compared to Approach 3, are
    consistent with what [7] found in that the approach involving adaption produced
    better results than the one without adaption. Approaches 1 and 2 in the current
    study used climate data obtained by resampling original climate data and only
    200 iterations were conducted. In future studies, the effect of the number of
    iterations on the performance of Approaches 1 and 2 should be established. The
    results of the study are limited by the accuracy of the crop model in representing
    the soil–plant–atmosphere system. However, the developed framework can be used
    with any crop model. Furthermore, results of the study were only tested by simulation.
    Future studies can test the results in the field. Future studies can also explore
    the usefulness of utilizing more than one crop model in the optimization model
    in comparison to using only one crop model. 5. Conclusions A multi-objective optimization
    problem of irrigation scheduling was presented and solved using four different
    approaches. All the approaches utilized the AquaCrop model and nondominated sorting
    genetic algorithm III in a simulation–optimization framework. Approach 1 used
    dynamic climate data without adaption. Approach 2 used dynamic climate data with
    adaption. Approach 3 used static climate data without adaption. Approach 4 used
    static climate data with adaption. The bootstrap technique was used for resampling
    original climate data to create the dynamic climate data. The results showed that
    Approach 4 produced the best results and that 400, 325, and 200 mm of irrigation
    water were required in a dry, normal, and wet year to produce a maize crop. The
    study demonstrated the usefulness of the presented simulation–optimization framework
    in solving a multi-objective optimization problem of irrigation scheduling. While
    the results of the study were limited by the accuracy of the crop model in representing
    the soil–water–plant–atmosphere system, the developed framework can be utilized
    with any other crop model. Furthermore, the results of the study were only tested
    by simulation. Future studies can test the results in the field. Future studies
    can also explore the usefulness of utilizing more than one crop model in the optimization
    model in comparison to using only one crop model. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

    Highlights • We used Sentinel 2 NDVI time-series to delineate dynamic management
    zones (MZ). • Changes in MZ patterns were consistent with soil moisture spatiotemporal
    variability. • Data variance fragmentation was used for daily evaluation of the

    MZ irrigation. Abstract Irrigation scheduling decision-support tools can improve

    agriculture is essential to global food production, especially because of projected
    population growth (Döll, 2002). Irrigation water is commonly applied uniformly
    over an entire field. Yet, field soil water content is typically non-uniform because
    of spatial variability in soil hydraulic properties (Hawley, 1983), topography
    (Burt and Butcher, 1985), and vegetation growth (Le Roux et al., 1995). When field
    spatial variability is significant (Baveye and Laba, 2014; Thorp, 2019), differential
    irrigation water management that accounts for variability may improve the cost-effectiveness
    of irrigation (Liang et al., 2016; Martini et al., 2017) by increasing for instance
    water use efficiency and productivity as well as decreasing nutrient leaching.
    Precision agriculture seeks to optimize farming operations via site-specific management
    plans that vary the application of nutrients and water across a field based on
    variations in soil and crop conditions (Zhang et al., 2002). Field management
    is prescribed over contiguous areas that have homogeneous soil properties and
    crop conditions. These areas are called management zones (MZ). Different clustering
    methods, including k-mean, ISODATA, and Gaussian Mixture, are available for delineating
    MZs based on different data sources (Galambošová et al., 2014; Martinez-Casasnovas
    et al., 2012; Schepers et al., 2004). Commonly, yield maps, topography, remote
    sensing data, and soil apparent electrical conductivity are used to delineate
    MZs (Bellvert et al. 2012, Liu et al., 2018; Scudiero et al., 2018; Ohana-levi
    et al., 2019). Recently, open access or low cost remote sensing data are being
    used in agriculture to obtain spatiotemporal information on biophysical parameters
    of vegetation (Fontanet et al., 2018). Several researchers have defined MZs in
    specific fields with the goal of increasing yield and decreasing water use. Inman
    et al. (2008) and Schenatto et al. (2015) used NDVI and other spectral vegetation
    indices to delineate MZs with NDVI data and different crop indices. Liu et al.
    (2018) delineated MZs based on yield and maps of different vegetation indices.
    Scudiero et al. (2013) argued that spatial information of soil properties known
    to affect plant growth should guide MZ delineation. They modeled maize yield spatial
    variability as a function of salinity, texture, carbon content and bulk density,
    using geospatial apparent soil electrical conductivity and bare soil reflectance
    measurements as proxies for these soil properties. A similar study was presented
    by Reyes et al. (2019), in which MZs were defined using information of both NDVI
    and soil properties. Georgi et al. (2018) developed an algorithm to delineate
    MZs automatically based on remote sensing data. However, one of the disadvantages
    of this algorithm is that it does not work properly in fields with strong time-dependent
    spatial patterns. All the above-mentioned studies consider MZs to be static and
    assume no dynamic pattern during the growing season. However, in fields where
    crop spatial patterns change over time, some researchers have advocated for MZ
    delineation to also be dynamic (Cohen et al., 2016; Evans et al., 2013; Haghverdi
    et al., 2015; Scudiero et al., 2018). Soil moisture sensors constitute a vital
    tool for real-time monitoring of soil water content dynamics in the field. Although
    sensors monitor soil water content at a single point, spatial and temporal variations
    of soil water content and their interactions with crops can be analyzed if several
    sensors are installed across the field (Biswas, 2014; Biswas and Si, 2011; Huang
    et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2016). These measurements can provide information about
    the source of variability between different MZs and aid in their delineation.
    In this study, we integrate crop spatial and temporal information from high-resolution
    remote sensing, soil water sensor data, and numerical model simulations to investigate
    irrigation scheduling for dynamic management zones. Specifically, we: i.) characterize
    the spatial and temporal dynamics of crop-soil-water relations of a maize field,
    ii.) delineate and evaluate temporally dynamic management zones for variable rate
    irrigation, and iii.) provide a workflow for in-season optimization of irrigation
    scheduling and water delivery management. 2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1. Study
    Site The study was carried out in a 5.8-ha maize (Zea mays L.) field located in
    Raïmat (Lleida, Spain) (Fig. 1). The study region has a typical semi-arid Mediterranean
    climate, with an average summer temperature and rainfall of 24 °C and 45 mm. The
    local climate was Mediterranean, with an average annual rainfall and reference
    evapotranspiration ( of 341 mm and 1.060 m, respectively. Download : Download

    location, soil moisture station locations, and maize variety plantings. The blue
    area represents maize variety p0937 (a combination of 500 and 600 series), the
    red area is variety d6980 (700 series), the yellow area is p1524 (700 series),
    and the green area is d6780 (600 series). Land use at the study site has changed
    over the years (Fig. A.1 of Appendix A). Originally, the site was a forest where
    no tillage occurred. Approximately 30 years ago, the land was converted to a vineyard.
    The topography of the field was modified, with soil being added or removed in
    various sections, such that the site can now be regarded as having an anthropogenic
    soil. In 2016, two years year before this study, grapevines were removed and maize
    was grown at the site. 2.2. Sowing and Irrigation All agronomic management and
    design at the field site was implemented by cooperators without our input. The
    field was sectioned into four plots that were each sowed with a different maize
    variety (Fig. 1). The varieties were, from west to east: p0937 (DuPont Pioneer,
    Johnston, IA), d6980 (DEKALB Genetics Corporation, Dekalb, IL), p1524 (DuPont
    Pioneer), and d6780 (DEKALB). All plots were sown on May 3, 2018, at a sowing
    density of 90000 seeds·ha-1. Plants started to emerge on May 12, 2018. Data from
    the seed companies indicated that the varieties sowed on the west and east edges
    (p0937 and d6780) had a faster vegetative growth than d6980 and p1524. However,
    all varieties were anticipated to reach full maturity between 125 to165 days after
    sowing. All the varieties were harvested on September 22, 2018. The field was
    irrigated with a solid set sprinkler system (Nelson Irrigation Corporation, Walla
    Walla, WA), with sprinklers located at a 15 x 15 m spacing. Water was delivered
    at a rate of 6.5 L m-2 h-1. Irrigation was uniformly applied over the field with
    scheduling and depths determined using a crop coefficient approach (FAO56). For
    most of the site, irrigation ended 115 days after sowing. But, in two 0.3-ha sections
    at the north-east end of the site, irrigation was halted 74 days after sowing
    due to soil waterlogging. 2.3. Soil, Environment, and Crop Measurements Field
    data were collected between May and September 2018. Soil moisture, soil and crop
    parameters, environmental variables, and NDVI time-series were measured. In May
    2018, 33 capacitive EC-5 soil moisture sensors (METER Group, Pullman, WA, USA)
    were installed at 11 locations named P1, P2, …, and P11 (Fig. 1). The sensors
    were installed at 15, 35, and 50 cm depths. Water content data were registered
    every 30 minutes using an EM5b data logger (METER Group). The manufacturer’s generic
    sensor calibration was used, which has a reported accuracy ± 0.03 cm3 cm−3 (Campbell
    and Devices, 1986) At each soil moisture station, three disturbed soil samples
    were collected at 0-5, 5-35, and 30-60 cm depth for organic matter (OM) and soil
    texture analyses. The Walkley-Black method was used to measure OM (Nelson and
    Sommers, 1996), whereas soil particle size distribution was measured according
    to the hydrometer method (Gee and Bauder, 1986). Particles were categorized into
    the following size classes: clay (soil particle diameter, D < 0.002 mm), fine
    silt (0.002 < D < 0.02 mm), coarse silt (0.02 < D < 0.05 mm) and sand (0.05 <
    D < 2 mm). Undisturbed soil cores were also collected at the same locations and
    depths for measuring soil hydraulic properties. Saturated hydraulic conductivity
    was measured with a KSat device (METER Group). Soil water retention measurements
    were obtained using Hyprop and WP4C instruments (METER Group). The Hyprop device
    utilizes an evaporation method (Schelle et al., 2013) and was used to obtain retention
    data from 0 to −85 kPa, whereas the WP4C device implements a chilled mirror dew
    point technique and was used to obtain measurements down to −300 MPa. The van
    Genuchten equations (van Genuchten, 1980v) were used to model the retention data
    and the soil unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. In the van Genuchten model, the
    Ks parameter was set to the saturated conductivity measured with the KSat device,
    the saturated water content parameter ( ) was set to the soil porosity estimated
    by the Hyprop device, and the residual water content parameter ( ) was set to
    the minimum water content recorded by the WP4C device. The van Genuchten shape
    parameters and were determined by fitting the model retention function to the
    measured data using the RETC software package (van Genuchten et al., 1991v). Principal
    component analysis (PCA) (Abdi and Williams, 2013; Martini et al., 2017) was used
    to investigate the relationships between soil texture, OM, bulk density, and hydraulic
    parameters. The PCA calculations were done with Statistica 12 (StatSoft Inc. Tulsa,
    OK, USA). A weather station consisting of an ECRN-100 rain gauge (METER Group),
    a cup anemometer (Davis Instruments, Hayward, CA, USA), and PYR pyranometer and
    VP-4 relative humidity and temperature sensors (METER Group) was installed 150
    m from the north-east corner of the field. The measured temperature, wind speed,
    relative humidity, and solar radiation were used to calculate daily reference
    evapotranspiration ( ) using the Penman Monteith equation as specified in FAO
    Irrigation and Drainage Paper No. 56 (Allen et al, 1998; hereafter “FAO56”). The
    estimated was converted into daily water requirements or potential evapotranspiration
    ( ) using the maize crop coefficient ( ) from FAO56. Maximum and minimum daily
    temperature measurements were used to calculate growing degree days (GDD) according
    to FAO56 and to determinate reference maize growing stages (Ritchie et al., 1997).
    Remote sensing data obtained from Sentinel 2 were used to determine normalized
    difference vegetation index ( ) Eq. (1) (Rouse et al., 1974), (1) where and are
    measured reflectance values in the near-infrared and visible red regions, respectively.
    was used to evaluate spatial variability in the field. Remote sensing data were
    downloaded with 10-m spatial resolution every 5 days unless there was cloud coverage.
    The first and last images downloaded were the 15th and 135th day after sowing.
    Remote sensing data were downloaded from Google Earth Engine web page (https://earthengine.google.com).
    2.4. Management Zones Delineation NDVI was used to characterize the spatial variability
    of crop vigor through the growing season. A k-means (also known as “fuzzy c-means”)
    unsupervised clustering algorithm (Odeh et al., 2010) was used to classify the
    NDVI data into temporally dynamic MZs. The Grouping Analysis tool in ArcMap 10.4.1
    (ESRI, Redlands, CA) was used for the MZ delineation. Anytime a new Sentinel 2
    NDVI scene was available at the site, a new MZ scheme was delineated. Designs
    having 2 to 6 MZs were considered. The Calinski–Harabasz criterion ( ) (Harabasz
    et al., 1974), Eq. (2), was used to evaluate the clusters and MZ delineations
    and select the optimum number of MZs. The CHC, also known as a pseudo F-statistic,
    measures the ratio of between-MZ differences and within-MZ similarity. It is formulated
    as: (2) where is the number of pixels, is the number of considered zones, is the
    between-zones sum of squares, and is the within-zone sum of squares. Large values
    indicate high within-MZ homogeneity and between-MZ heterogeneity. The averages
    and maximum and minimum values within each MZ were calculated for further comparison
    between different MZs. MZs were not defined for the beginning of the season (0-20
    day after sowing) because plants had not yet germinated or were not big enough
    to influence , and for the end of the season (beyond 130 days after sowing) because
    in that period the crop is in a late phenological stage and not irrigated. Differences
    in soil properties across MZs over time were assessed using a Kruskal-Wallis (Kruskal
    and Wallis, 1952) rank test (i.e., a non-parametric analysis of variance), calculated
    with Statistica 12. Additionally, we considered an alternative static delineation
    scheme, subdividing the site into four contiguous fields corresponding to the
    planted maize varieties. The was calculated for each available scene to compare
    the variety-based MZ approach to the dynamic -based MZ delineation. 2.5. Management
    Zone Available Water Soil-water status for the MZs was modeled as plant available
    water ( ) Eq. (3) (Liang et al., 2016; Vellidis et al., 2016; Zurweller et al.,
    2019): (3) where is the profile average available water at monitoring station
    and time , indexes the measurement depths, (cm) is the depth increment associated
    with the moisture sensor at depth , (cm) is the total soil profile depth, (cm3
    cm-3) is soil water content, (cm3 cm-3) is the wilting point (water content at
    −1500 kPa), and (cm3 cm-3) is field capacity (determined using the simulated soil
    drainage method of Twarakavi et al. (2009)). The for a MZ was defined to be the
    average for all monitoring stations located within the MZ. Note that the MZ design
    changed over the growing season, so the MZ membership of some stations also changed.
    In addition to the calculation on the data, the spatiotemporal variability of
    was also used for in-season evaluation of the dynamic MZ-design. Following Fraisse
    et al. (2001), we calculated the daily weighted within-MZ variance (4), (4) where
    is the daily weighted variance within management zone i; j indicates the monitoring
    stations within management zone i; k indicates the measurement times during the
    current day; is the number of stations in management zone i; is the total number
    of stations in the field; is the number of measurements per day (every 30 min),
    is defined by (3), and is the average profile AW across monitoring stations in
    management zone i and measurement times in the current day. The total within-zone
    variance is equal to the sum of the weighted within-zone variances, . By comparing
    with the total daily field-wide variance, it is possible to determine how much
    was gained in terms of AW uniformity by dividing the field into MZs (Fraisse et
    al., 2001). 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 3.1. Soil Properties Soil texture, organic
    matter (OM) content and bulk density ( ) values measured at each station are reported
    in Table 1. The soil texture classes (USDA system) of samples taken from the 11
    locations were clay loam (42.4% of samples), loam (42.4%), and silty clay loam
    (15.2%). Locations on the east side (P1, P6, P7, P11) of the field had, on average,
    lower sand and higher silt and clay contents than those on the west side. Average
    OM contents ranged between 0.57 and 1.96 %, which is typical for agricultural
    soils in this region (Romanyà and Rovira, 2011). Fitted and measured parameters
    for the soil hydraulic properties at each station are reported in Table 2. Consistent
    with the spatial trend in soil texture noted previously, the SWRCs measured on
    the east side of the study site (stations P1, P6, P7, P11) had lower fitted n
    values than in the rest of the site. On the wet end of a retention curve, a lower
    n value corresponds to a more gradual transition in water content as pressure
    head changes. Fig. A.2 of Appendix A compares SWRCs observed at the locations
    on the west (P9) and east (P11) sides of the field. Table 1. Soil samples texture,

    11.00 0.350 0.250 The principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that eight
    principal components were needed to explain 95% of the variability in the soil
    dataset. The first three components, PC1 (30.9%), PC2 (18.6%), and PC3 (15.9%),
    explained around two thirds of the variance in the soil dataset. Particularly,
    PC1 indicated that clay content clustered (was positively correlated) with θwp,
    θfc, and α. The PC1 also indicated that clay content was negatively correlated
    with sand content, θr, and n. Further detail about PC1, PC2, and PC3 are reported
    in Fig. A.3 of Appendix A. 3.2. Remote Sensing and Dynamic Management Zones Delineation
    The site average, minimum, and maximum values for each available Sentinel 2 scene
    are reported in Fig. 2a. Changes in averaged generally corresponded to the evolution
    of at the site, consistent with reports for maize grown in Mediterranean climates
    in other studies (Segovia-Cardozo et al., 2019; Toureiro et al., 2017). Fig. 2b

    those observed in other studies on maize (Viña et al., 2004). In the early vegetative
    stages (V0 to V5), the range of each Sentinel 2 scene was narrow. In later vegetative
    stages and early reproductive stages, the ranges were much larger, indicating
    considerable variability in crop status (greenness, health) at the site. Download

    3a shows the spatiotemporal changes of at the sites. Areas with high and low were
    observed at the site throughout the growing season. However, the spatial patterns
    changed over time, suggesting that homogeneous or static site-specific irrigation
    management may be inadequate to address crop needs over time at this site. Fig.
    3b shows the dynamic MZ delineation obtained with unsupervised clustering of the
    data. The number of MZ and its spatial distribution changed throughout the growing
    season. At the beginning of the season, until 50 days after sowing, it seems that
    the optimal number of homogeneous MZ was three. The MZ1 covered the north-west
    side of the site and had the highest values; the MZ2 had intermediate and spanned
    across the south of the site until the 45th day after sowing and after that over
    the south-west only. The MZ3 had lower values and was initially the north-eastern
    side of the site, then covered the entire western side of the field at 45 days
    after sowing. From the 50th day after sowing, the indicated that four clusters
    were best at identifying areas with homogeneous . MZ1 and MZ2 remained relatively
    similar to their early season delineations. The MZ4 identified an area of moderately
    low at the south-eastern portion of the site, whereas MZ3, on the north-eastern
    side of the site, was characterized by the lowest values. The spatial patterns
    of the four MZs changed only slightly over time, until the 130th day after sowing,
    when the size of MZ3 increased remarkably while MZ4 decreased. The unsupervised
    clustering was compared to dividing the site into four blocks, one for each maize
    variety. Fig. 3c shows the values for clustering into dynamic MZ and into varietal-based
    blocks through the growing season. The dynamic MZ-design strategy had larger values
    for the entire growing season than the variety-block strategy, indicating that
    the dynamic MZs identified by unsupervised clustering had more homogeneous than
    the varietal blocks. Download : Download high-res image (514KB) Download : Download

    between the eastern and western side of the field, especially visible along the
    boundary between the d6980 and p1524 varieties. The boundary between the d6980
    and p1524 varieties seemed to be a big factor in the determination of the boundary
    between eastern (MZ1 and MZ2) and western (MZ3 and MZ4) zones from 55 to 120 days
    after sowing (Fig. 3b). Fig. A.1.f of Appendix A shows the p1524 and d6780 varieties
    doing relatively poorly in July 2018. Therefore, in addition to different soil
    hydraulic properties on the east side of the field, crop genetics (e.g., pest
    resistance, germination rate between the varieties) and uneven management (e.g.,
    mechanical sowing, fertilization, soil tillage) could have been contributing factors
    to the poor performance of the p1524 and d6780 varieties. Changes in MZ delineation
    over time led to some changes in MZ membership for certain soil-water monitoring
    stations (Table 3). These changes occurred frequently in the early vegetative
    stages (until 54 days after sowing). No MZ membership change occurred in the late
    vegetative and reproductive stages. The MZs were characterized by contrasting
    soil properties throughout the season. The MZ had significantly (p < 0.05) different
    PC1 scores throughout the season according to the Kruskal Wallis test: MZ1 and
    MZ2 were characterized by low PC1 scores, whereas MZ3 and MZ4 were characterized
    by the highest PC1 scores (Fig. A.3 of Appendix A). Table 3. Periods where one

    Water Applied Changes in and across MZs are depicted in Fig. 4a (MZ1), 4b (MZ2),
    4c (MZ3), and 4d (MZ4). Through the growing season, in MZ1 and MZ2 was higher
    than in MZ3 and MZ4. Furthermore, was slightly higher in MZ1 than in MZ2. Average
    in MZ1 was close to 1 (i.e., water content was near θfc) throughout the entire
    growing season. Average in MZ2 was greater than 1 at the beginning of the season
    (until 45 days after sowing) and then very close to 1 through the end of the growing
    season. Portions of MZ3 and MZ4 had lower values than MZ1 and MZ2. In these areas,
    irrigation was likely excessive. was considerably higher than 1 for the entire
    vegetative growth of maize and during the early reproductive stages. Once irrigation
    was halted in the northeastern corner of the site (i.e., approximately over the
    area comprised by MZ3) at 74 days after sowing, the in MZ3 gradually decreased
    until the end of the season, while in MZ3 remained stable. Halting irrigation
    in the northeastern corner of the site had little-to-no effect on the spatial
    extent of MZ3 and the other MZs, as shown in Fig. 3b. The analysis of the daily
    total within-MZ variance ( ) provided further support for the use of to identify
    areas with similar conditions at the site. In Fig. 4e, the calculated total MZ
    variance is normalized by the daily whole-site variance. Especially beyond 45
    days after sowing (the beginning of the VT growth stage), the normalized within-MZ
    variance is much less than 1, showing that a large part of the total variance
    was explained by splitting the site into dynamic MZs delineated based on an analysis
    of . Fraisse et al. (2001) used yield within-zone variance to evaluate soil-derived
    MZs at the end of the season. Our results suggest that daily could also be used
    for in-season evaluation of management zone designs. Download : Download high-res

    vegetative growth, and several studies have found positive correlations between
    , , and canopy vigor in different crops (Scudiero et al., 2014; West et al., 2018).
    However, those studies were for water scarce conditions. It is well known that
    crop water stress and reductions in canopy growth can occur due to either deficit
    of water or excess of water (Feddes et al., 1978). In the current study, where
    maize was grown under nearly waterlogged conditions for most of the growing season
    (Fig. 4), changes in and between consecutive Sentinel 2 scenes were negatively
    correlated, with Pearson r equal to -0.64 (MZ1), -0.87 (MZ2), -0.79 (MZ3), and
    -0.83 (MZ4) (all significant at p < 0.05). Thus, as reported in previous studies
    (Long et al., 2015; Quebrajo et al., 2018; Scudiero et al., 2018; Shanahan et
    al., 2008), data alone should not be used to make irrigation management decisions;
    (and/or other plant canopy information) should be integrated with soil information
    to properly understand plant processes at a site. 3.4. Irrigation Scheduling Simulations
    With respect to within-season management decisions, one way to make a connection
    between -based dynamic management zone delineation and soil conditions would be
    to use a simulation model to make within-season forecasts of soil and crop conditions
    for different management options. Several authors have simulated different irrigation
    strategies, for different purposes, in order to define the most appropriate irrigation
    strategy (Autovino et al., 2018; Haj-Amor and Bouri, 2020; Sakaguchi et al., 2019).
    In the remainder of this paper, we determine a hypothetical optimal irrigation
    schedule for each growing stage using the simulation/optimization approach developed
    by Fontanet (2019).We first show that a physically based simulation model, Hydrus-1D
    (Šimůnek et al., 2016), is consistent with NDVI-based zoning by simulating the
    field experiment and demonstrating agreement between measured AW and simulated
    available water ( , as well as showing a correspondence between simulated transpiration
    ( ) rates and . Next, we use the calibrated model to investigate what-if irrigation
    scenarios, calculating a hypothetical irrigation scheduling table for each dynamic
    MZ that could have been generated from NDVI within season to guide irrigation.
    3.4.1. Hydrus 1-D available water and transpiration simulations The well-known
    Hydrus-1D model solves the Richards Equation numerically to simulate variably
    saturated water flow and root water uptake in soils. The model inputs and parameterizations
    used in our simulations are detailed in Appendix B. Simulations of the experiment
    for differing monitoring locations all used the same inputs and parameters except
    for (i.) the soil hydraulic properties, which were measured at each station during
    the field campaign (Table 2), and (ii.) the irrigation boundary condition, which
    differed only for stations P10 and P11 because irrigation was stopped during the
    experiment. In Fig. 5, daily observed for each station is compared with daily-simulated
    available water ( . Generally good agreement between and existed for all stations,
    although it is acknowledged that the time courses were relatively non-dynamic.
    Still, the simulations were done using independently measured hydraulic properties
    and without any calibration, so the agreement is quite good (modeling details
    can be found in Appendix B). Missing data towards the end of the season in P7
    was due to rodents chewing on the sensor cables. Download : Download high-res

    actual transpiration ( at each MZ and the potential transpiration ( ) at the site.
    At MZ1 and MZ2, weekly averages were always equal or near the potential transpiration.
    At MZ3 and MZ4, weekly values were remarkably lower than the potential. There
    was good correspondence between and at each MZ, with a Pearson r of 0.6 (MZ1),
    0.51 (MZ2), 0.69 (MZ3), and 0.82 (MZ4). In agreement with the results discussed
    for and AW data (section 3.2. Remote Sensing and Dynamic Management Zones Delineation),
    low values at MZ3 and MZ4 were due to waterlogging (root water uptake and transpiration
    is reduced in the model whenever simulated soil water content exceeds a threshold
    value; see Appendix B). Stations in MZ3 and MZ4 (see Table 3) had and over 1 for
    most of the growing season (Fig. 4). Download : Download high-res image (143KB)

    scheduling for within-season decision making We adopted the method of Fontanet
    (2019) to investigate optimal irrigation scheduling for dynamic MZs In this method,
    irrigation of duration [T] is prescribed whenever the soil moisture content decreases
    below a critical threshold level ( ) as indicated by readings from a soil water
    pressure head sensor(s). The irrigation rate is assumed to be a fixed constant
    for a given irrigation system. The recommended duration and threshold are determined
    using a simulation/optimization procedure. Simulations are made using forecasted
    daily or weekly crop water demand (reference ET0) and a range of values for the
    irrigation scheduling parameters, and . The optimal parameter values are those
    that maximize seasonal transpiration in the simulations (transpiration being,
    for many agronomically important crops, proportional to marketable yield). In
    adapting the simulation/optimization method, we make separate recommendations
    for each MZ, and update them whenever there is a change in MZ station membership.
    The recommended values of and for a given MZ are the average values determined
    for monitoring stations within the zone. For simplicity, we use in this example
    the known daily potential ET0 for the forecasted model boundary condition (rather
    than historical data which would be necessary for actual within-season forecasts).
    Haghverdi et al. (2015) and Liang et al. (2016) proposed calculating crop water
    requirements as a function of root growth since the soil depth to refill increases
    as roots grow deeper. Similarly, in our simulations, we triggered irrigation based
    on readings from progressively deeper sensors as the season progressed. In principle,
    when multiple sensor depths are available, the sensor depth could be treated as
    an additional optimization parameter. Full details on our implementation of the
    Fontanet (2019) procedure are given in Appendix C. Although the Fontanet (2019)
    method prescribes an optimized irrigation schedule, in practice a grower may not
    be able to irrigate exactly according to a schedule and sensor readings, particularly
    when there are multiple management zones. Therefore, we also calculated recommended
    irrigation durations (or, equivalently, irrigation amounts) for soils that have
    become dryer than the “optimal” irrigation trigger point. The resulting irrigation
    scheduling calendar for dynamic-MZ irrigation is presented in Table 4. Optimal
    irrigation strategies for each growth stage are shown in bold. The other table
    entries show irrigation recommendations for field sections that are dryer than
    the optimal trigger point. Across all MZs, the optimal irrigation durations were
    in the range of 1.9 to 2.6 h. However, the triggering thresholds varied by location.
    Thresholds for MZ1 and MZ2 were in the range of -18.3 to -30 kPa, whereas the
    range for MZ3 and MZ4 was -10 to -20 kPa. In general, the recommendations are
    for more frequent and slightly shorter irrigations in MZ3 and MZ4, which are located
    on the east side of the field and feature finer textured soils. With the specific
    Hydrus-1D model parameterization used in the current study, uptake and transpiration
    are penalized whenever any portion of the soil approaches saturation. The recommendation
    of somewhat shorter, more frequent irrigations on the east side is due to optimization’s
    aversion to creating overly wet soil conditions near the surface, such as may
    occur (albeit briefly) during a longer irrigation. Table 4. Irrigation scheduling

    MZ3, 29 % less water was recommended, with an increase in transpiration of 24
    %. And for MZ4, a 17 % reduction in irrigation corresponded to a massive 53% increase
    in transpiration. These results are consistent with our earlier findings and discussion
    indicating the field was over-irrigated, especially in MZ3 and MZ4. Table 5. Comparisons

    due to the spatial and temporal variability of a number of variables and parameters.
    In this work, we investigated a workflow for improved precision irrigation scheduling
    using data from a field where four maize varieties were sown. The workflow is
    based on dynamic MZ delineation with unsupervised clustering. This study demonstrates
    that delineation of MZs based on NDVI clustering was able to statistically represent
    within-field spatial variability better than delineating MZs only based on maize
    varieties. Additionally, the optimal number and spatial configuration of the MZs
    were found to change over the growing season. The highest number of MZs was four.
    The MZ1 and MZ2 corresponded to field sections where NDVI values reflected a typical
    maize crop performance, whereas MZ3 and MZ4 featured relatively low values indicative
    of poor maize growth. Soil water content showed that the variation in crop performance
    was attributable to soil hydraulic properties, soil available water, and over-irrigation.
    Further, a relationship existed between NDVI and soil available water. The results
    indicated that soil available water could potentially also be used for, or incorporated
    into, in-season evaluation of management zone designs. Lastly, we proposed a method
    of combining dynamic management zone delineation with Hydrus 1-D model forecasts
    for irrigation scheduling. The field experiment was first simulated to confirm
    the model parameterization and demonstrate its consistency with the obtained NDVI
    and soil water content data. We then used model simulations to determine an optimal
    zonation and irrigation calendar for different crop growth stages that could have
    been generated and updated in real time during the season. Simulations with the
    optimized irrigation schedule produced an increase in transpiration and a decrease
    in water use as compared to the field trial (which, again, was over-irrigated).
    The improvement was especially remarkable for MZ3 and MZ4, where irrigation was
    reduced by 28.5 and 16.6 %, and transpiration increased by 23.9 and 52.6 %, respectively.
    In summary, we note that although NDVI is useful for dynamically delineating management
    zones, for irrigation scheduling it is recommended that NDVI be combined with
    some additional measure of soil conditions. Low NDVI values may be indicative
    of poor crop performance, but without other information it is not possible to
    determine the cause nor recommend a remedial irrigation or management practice.

    Appendix B. Hydrus -1D Simulations Hydrus-1D (Šimůnek et al., 2016, 2008) was
    used to simulated soil moisture dynamics and water balance components at each
    monitoring station. Each simulation spanned 105 days, from the 18th to the 123rd
    day after sowing. The 60 cm soil profile consisted of three layers/materials,
    as specified in Table 2. Soil hydraulic properties were specified using the van
    Genuchten-Mualem model (van Genuchten, 1980) Eq B.1 and B.2 as follows: (B.1)
    and (B.2) where (cm3 cm-3) is the volumetric water content; h is the soil water
    pressure head (cm); (cm3 cm-3) is saturated water content; (cm3 cm-3) is residual
    water content; (cm·d-1) is saturated hydraulic conductivity; and are shape parameters;
    ; and . In Hydrus, root water uptake Eq. (B.3) is simulated using a sink term
    which has three parts, the potential transpiration rate (Tp) (cm·d-1), the root
    density distribution (β) (cm-1), and the dimensionless water stress function (
    (h)): (B.3) The actual transpiration rate (Ta) Eq (B.4) (cm·d-1) is calculated
    by integrating Eq. (B.3) over the root zone LR: (B.4) Root depth was measured
    twice a month during the field campaign at P9 station. This information was used
    to parameterize the Hydrus root growth module. Water stress Eq (B.5) was modeled
    using the Feddes et al. (1978) function: (B.5) Parameterized by four critical
    values of pressure head, Eq. (B.5) defines maximal uptake ( ) when the soil water
    pressure head is . Water uptake decreases linearly above or below that range (
    ). And uptake is zero when . According to the Hydrus-1D database, the parameter
    values for maize are h1 = -1.5, h2 = -3.0, h3 = -60. and h4 = -800. kPa, respectively.
    The value of h3 was allowed to vary as a function of evaporative demand as modeled
    by Hyrdurs-1D. Three observation nodes were inserted in the domain at the same
    depths as the soil moisture sensors, 15, 35 and 50 cm. Soil moisture values simulated
    at the observation nodes were used to determine the simulated available water
    ( ), using the same procedure as with the field data. The potential evaporation
    and transpiration rates were calculated by partitioning ETc into potential evaporation
    (Ep) and transpiration (Tp) based on the canopy cover fraction (α) according to
    Raes et al. (2009). An atmospheric boundary condition was imposed at the surface
    and a free drainage condition was used at the bottom. Simulated actual transpiration
    ( ) and simulated applied irrigation ( ) results from each station were extracted.
    and were calculated by averaging stations located with the dynamic MZs. Appendix
    C. Irrigation Scheduling Irrigation scheduling was optimized using the methodology
    developed by Fontanet (2019). All soil, environmental and crop inputs are the
    same as described previously for the Hydrus-1D simulations (Appendix B). Possible
    values for the irrigation scheduling parameters were constrained to be {-10, -20,
    …, −100 kPa} and {1, 2, 3, 4 h·d-1}. The irrigation rate was constant (6.5 l·h-1
    m-2). The soil depth used to trigger irrigation ( ) changed during the growing
    season, becoming deeper as the season progressed. Irrigation parameters have been
    defined at each station and at different crop growing stages (V0-V5, V6-V10, V11-V15,
    VT, R1-R6). The optimal irrigation at each grow stage and MZ are the average values
    obtained for the stations located in the MZ. Appendix A. Supplementary data The

  description: In arid regions, irrigation scheduling optimization is efficient in
    coping with the shortage of agricultural water resources. This paper developed
    a simulation-optimization model for irrigation scheduling optimization for the
    main crop in an arid oasis, aiming to maximize crop yield and minimize crop water
    consumption. The model integrated the soil water balance simulation model and
    the optimization model for crop irrigation scheduling. The simulation model was
    firstly calibrated and validated based on field experiment data for maize in 2012
    and 2013, respectively. Then, considering the distribution of soil types and irrigation
    districts in the study area, the model was used to solve the optimal irrigation
    schedules for the scenarios of status quo and typical climate years. The results
    indicated that the model is applicable for reflecting the complexities of simulation-optimization
    for maize irrigation scheduling. The optimization results showed that the irrigation
    water-saving potential of the study area was between 97 mm and 240 mm, and the
    average annual optimal yield of maize was over 7.3 t/ha. The simulation-optimization
    model of irrigation schedule established in this paper can provide a technical
    means for the formulation of irrigation schedules to ensure yield optimization
    and water productivity or water saving.

    irrigation scheduling optimization is efficient in coping with the shortage of
    agricultural water resources. This paper developed a simulation–optimization model
    for irrigation scheduling optimization for the main crop in an arid oasis, aiming
    to maximize crop yield and minimize crop water consumption. The model integrated
    the soil water balance simulation model and the optimization model for crop irrigation
    scheduling. The simulation model was firstly calibrated and validated based on
    field experiment data for maize in 2012 and 2013, respectively. Then, considering
    the distribution of soil types and irrigation districts in the study area, the
    model was used to solve the optimal irrigation schedules for the scenarios of
    status quo and typical climate years. The results indicated that the model is
    applicable for reflecting the complexities of simulation–optimization for maize
    irrigation scheduling. The optimization results showed that the irrigation water-saving
    potential of the study area was between 97 mm and 240 mm, and the average annual
    optimal yield of maize was over 7.3 t/ha. The simulation–optimization model of
    irrigation schedule established in this paper can provide a technical means for
    the formulation of irrigation schedules to ensure yield optimization and water
    productivity or water saving. Keywords: maize; irrigation scheduling; simulation;
    optimization; simulation–optimization model 1. Introduction Agriculture is the
    biggest consumer of the world’s water resources by far, as irrigated agriculture
    uses about 70% of the world’s freshwater withdrawals [1,2]. This amount is already
    insufficient to fulfil actual irrigation needs and is expected to decrease in
    the next few years due to the intensifying competition with other users, especially
    in arid and semi-arid regions. In the arid land of northwest China, agricultural
    water consumption accounts for approximately 90% of the total water use [3]; however,
    the average available of water is only 5.8% of the average level in China. The
    second largest inland river basin of China, the Heihe River Basin, located in
    the arid zones of northwest China, is the main food production zone, producing
    a quarter of Chinese corn seed. Agricultural water use in the middle-reaches accounts
    for 96% of the total water use, with 86% of the irrigation water coming from Heihe
    River [4,5]. The amount of water diverted from Heihe River to the middle-reaches
    should be reduced by one third since the year 2001 with the implementation of
    the Water Diversion Plan, since severe ecological problems downstream were caused
    by water scarcity [6]. Thus, effective irrigation water management, such as irrigation
    scheduling optimization, will be very helpful in coping with the shortage of agricultural
    water resources in those regions [7,8]. Generally, the impacts of different irrigation
    strategies can be understood by using agro-hydrological simulation models. Simulation
    models can vividly describe the dynamics of crop growth and soil water balance
    under various irrigation schedules and meteorological factors. After proper calibration
    and validation, these simulation models can be adopted to do scenario analysis
    for searching preferable management strategies. For example, AquaCrop, SWAP, the
    soil water balance simulation model, Hydrus, etc., are popular simulation models
    used to simulate farmland crop growth or water consumption/supply [9,10,11,12].
    Such simulation models are good at quantitatively describing the effects of various
    irrigation water management strategies on the hydrological processes in farmland.
    However, they could only be used to answer the “What if?” question [13]. This
    means that the better irrigation water management strategy is based on scenario
    analysis of several user-defined alternative scenarios. In scenario simulation,
    a number of pre-specified water management strategies are firstly evaluated by
    comparing the simulation results. Then, the strategy with better results is recommended.
    The recommended strategy is generally the best one among the chosen options, but
    it is unlikely to be the globally optimal one [14]. To get a truly global optimum,
    optimization methods must be combined with simulation models to derive optimal
    irrigation strategies [13,15]. Aside from simulation modeling, optimization methods
    are another effective way to solve the problems of irrigation water management
    [16]. Optimization methods describe and generalize the irrigation system by establishing
    a series of mathematical equations, and using optimization solution technology
    to get the optimal solution [17]. Optimization objectives, constraints, and solution
    methods are the three basic elements for optimization models. A multitude of optimization
    models for water allocation or irrigation scheduling have been developed, using
    such optimization techniques as linear programming, non-linear programming, and
    dynamic programing, etc. [18,19,20,21,22]. However, optimization models cannot
    reflect the process of crop growth or water movement as simulation models. To
    break the limitations of both simulation modeling and optimization methods, they
    can be internally or externally linked together [23]. The genetic algorithm (GA)
    is one of the most famous artificial intelligence search methods and it has been
    frequently used to solve optimization problems in water management. Compared with
    other traditional optimization methods, GA is more likely to be used in solving
    the simulation–optimization model and it has been widely used in irrigation water
    allocation [24]. Taking into account the considerations above, the main objective
    of this study is to develop a simulation–optimization model of irrigation scheduling
    optimization for the main crop in an arid oasis, aiming to maximize crop yield
    and minimize crop water consumption. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Area
    and Data Collection The area of interest is the middle-reaches of the Heihe River
    Basin with 17 irrigation districts and its geographic location is shown in Figure
    1. It covers an area of 11,352 km2, 23% of which is irrigated farmland [25]. The
    typical crop in this region is maize, which accounts for 48% of the irrigated
    land [25]. The study area has a temperate arid climate with the mean annual temperature
    varying from 273.15 K to 278.15 K. The average annual precipitation is 136.5 mm
    and the average annual potential evaporation is 1154 mm [26]. The groundwater
    level is in the range of 1300 m to 1690 m [26]. Due to the limited precipitation,
    irrigation is required during the whole crop growing season (from April to October)
    with water diverted from either the Heihe River or pumped from the aquifer [27].
    Figure 1. Geographic location of the study area and distribution of maize. The
    collected data mainly contains irrigation data, soil characteristics, meteorological
    data and field observation data of soil moisture. Soil moisture was sampled at
    20 cm intervals down to 110 cm below ground surface using the gravimetric sampling
    method every 10 days during the crop growing period in 2012 and 2013, with three
    replicates. The irrigation data for crops in different irrigation districts were
    collected from the Zhangye Statistics Yearbook. For details, the irrigation amounts
    for maize in different irrigation districts ranged from 360 mm to 1184 mm during
    2001 to 2010. The classification map of soil textural classes was based on our
    survey in 2014. The sampling units for the data were about 5 km. The details of
    the samplings can be found in a previous study [25]. Here, we used the main soil
    types in the farmland, and the details are shown in Figure 2 and Table 1. Meteorological
    data during 1963 to 2016, (i.e., precipitation, relative humidity, sunshine hours,
    average temperature, air temperature, and wind speed at Zhangye weather station
    (38°56′ E, 100°26′ N, 1482.7 m)) were obtained from the China Meteorological Data
    Sharing Service System (http://data.cma.cn/). Figure 2. Distribution of the soil
    samples and soil types. Table 1. The soil types along the soil profile. 2.2. Soil
    Water Balance Simulation Model Maize land is divided into various maize units
    according to different soil types and irrigation districts. The items of water
    balance in the root zone of each maize unit include the water input, output, and
    changes of soil water storage. The water balance equation can be described by
    Equation (1) [11]: Δ𝑊= 𝑊 𝑡+1 − 𝑊 𝑡 = 𝑃 𝑡 + 𝐼 𝑡 −𝐸 𝑇 𝑡 − 𝑄 𝑠𝑡 (1) where ΔW is the
    change of water storage in the root zone at the tth day (mm) (positive means increase),
    Wt+1 and Wt are the soil water storage at the beginning of the (t + 1)th and tth
    day (mm), Pt, It, ETt, and Qst are precipitation, irrigation depth, evapotranspiration,
    and water flux at the bottom of the root zone at the tth day (mm). Qst can be
    calculated by Equation (2) [28], with positive values referring to deep percolation
    from the root zone to the lower zone and negative values indicating upward recharge
    from the lower zone to the root zone: 𝑄 𝑠𝑡 =𝑎⋅ ( 𝑊 𝑡 𝑊 𝑓 ) 𝑏 ⋅( 𝑊 𝑡 − 𝑊 𝑐 ) (2)
    where Wf = θf∙L is the field water capacity (mm), θf is soil moisture at field
    capacity (m3/m3), L is the depth of root zone (mm), Wc= θc∙L is the critical value
    of water storage corresponding to zero flux at the bottom of the root zone (mm),
    θc is the critical rate of water storage (m3/m3), and a and b are empirical coefficients
    (dimensionless). Values of θf, θc, a, and b are obtained through model calibration.
    The evapotranspiration ETt can be calculated by Equation (3) [29]: 𝐸 𝑇 𝑡 = 𝐾 𝑠𝑡
    ⋅ 𝐾 𝑐𝑡 ⋅𝐸 𝑇 0𝑡 (3) where ET0t is the reference evapotranspiration at the tth day
    (mm) and can be calculated by Penman–Monteith equation, recommended in Allen et
    al. [29]. Kct is the crop coefficient at the tth day (dimensionless), which varies
    with specific crop characteristics and growing stages, and is normally obtained
    through field experiments. The values of Kct for maize in this study are obtained
    according to previous research in the same study area [30]. Kst is the soil water
    stress coefficient at the tth day (dimensionless) and can be described by Equation
    (4) [31]: ⎧ ⎩ ⎨     𝐾 𝑠𝑡 = ln( 𝐴 𝑤𝑡 +1) ln101 𝐴 𝑤𝑡 = 𝜃 𝑡 − 𝜃 𝑤 𝜃 𝑓 − 𝜃 𝑤 (4)
    where θt is the average soil moisture (m3/m3), and θw is the wilting soil moisture
    (m3/m3). In this study, normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) and the coefficient
    of determination (R2) were used to evaluate the performance of the simulation
    model. These indexes can be calculated as: NRMSE= 100 𝑀 ave 1 𝑁 ∑ 𝑛=1 𝑁 ( 𝑀 𝑛
    − 𝑆 𝑛 ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − − − − −  ⎷   (5) 𝑅 2 = ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ∑ 𝑛=1 𝑁 ( 𝑀 𝑛 −
    𝑀 ave )( 𝑆 𝑛 − 𝑆 ave ) ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ 2 ∑ 𝑛=1 𝑁 ( 𝑀 𝑛 − 𝑀 ave ) 2 ∑ 𝑛=1 𝑁 ( 𝑆 𝑛 − 𝑆 ave
    ) 2 (6) where N is the number of the measurement points, Sn is the simulated value,
    Mn is the measured value, Mave and Save are the average of the measured values
    and the simulated values, respectively. The performance of the simulation model
    was firstly calibrated based on the field experiment data for maize under various
    soil types in the Yingke Irrigation District in the Heihe River Basin in 2012,
    and then validated using the data in 2013. 2.3. Optimization Model for Irrigation
    Scheduling In the optimization model for irrigation scheduling, crop yield is
    targeted to be maximized and crop water consumption to be minimized, with constraints
    of irrigation data and irrigation amount. The objective functions and constraint
    functions are as follows: Objectives: { max𝑌=max(𝛼𝐸 𝑇 2 +𝛽𝐸𝑇+𝐶) min𝐸𝑇 (7) Subject
    to: { 𝑑 𝑖 < 𝑑 𝑖+1 (𝑖≤𝑛−1, 𝑖∈ 𝑁 ∗ ) 𝐼 min ≤ 𝐼 𝑖 ≤ 𝐼 max (𝑖≤𝑛, 𝑖∈ 𝑁 ∗ ) (8) where
    Y is the crop yield (t/ha), which is calculated by the water production function
    (αET + βET + C). α, β, and C are the empirical parameters obtained from the previous
    research [32] in the same study area. For details, α = −0.0148, β = 16.99, C =
    2468.67. ET is crop water consumption simulated by the soil water balance simulation
    model (mm). d is a vector composed by irrigation data di listed in sequence. n
    is the total irrigation times during the crop growing season. Ii is the irrigation
    depth of the ith irrigation (mm). Imin and Imax are the minimum and maximum irrigation
    depths (mm); minimal irrigation depth is set to be zero and maximal irrigation
    depth is the irrigation amount obtained from the Zhangye Statistics Yearbook for
    each irrigation district. The optimal model for irrigation scheduling is solved
    by the improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) [33]. There
    are six steps in NSGA-II (i.e., population initialization, non-dominated sorting,
    crowding distance calculation, selection, crossover and mutation, and recombination
    and selection). In this study, the initial irrigation scheduling is generated
    randomly, and then the irrigation dates are sequenced to generate the initial
    solution with normal irrigation sequence. By using the initial solution for genetic
    operations, such as crossover and variation, the Pareto optimal solution set is
    finally obtained. In total, 50 individuals were used for 200 generations of genetic
    optimization in this study. 2.4. Framework of Simulation–Optimization Model The
    framework of the simulation–optimization model for irrigation scheduling contains
    two parts (i.e., the simulation part and the optimization part), as shown in Figure
    3. In the first part, the soil water balance simulation model was calibrated and
    validated with the experimental data of soil moisture. Then, the simulation model
    was combined with water production functions to simulate the items of soil water
    balance and calculate the crop yield for the optimization part. Finally, the optimal
    irrigation scheduling was solved by NSGA-II under different scenarios. Figure
    3. Framework of Simulation–Optimization Model for irrigation scheduling. 2.5.
    Scenario Designs In this study, two types of scenarios (status quo and scenarios
    of different typical climate years) were set to find out the optimal irrigation
    scheduling to maximize crop yield and minimize crop water consumption. In status
    quo, the meteorological data during 2001 to 2010 were used to get the optimal
    irrigation scheduling. Typical climate years, including wet, normal, and dry years,
    were determined according to 25%, 50%, and 75% precipitation assurance by the
    optimum curve-fitting method based on the historical meteorological data (1963–2016)
    at Zhangye Weather Station. The daily precipitation and reference evapotranspiration
    in different scenarios are shown in Figure 4. Figure 4. Reference evapotranspiration
    (ET0) and precipitation (P) under different climate years. 3. Results and Discussion
    3.1. Model Calibration and Validation The soil water balance simulation model
    was calibrated by the field observations of averaged soil moisture in 0–110 cm
    depths in 2012, and further calibrated by observation data in 2013. The comparisons
    of simulated and measured soil moistures under different soil types for model
    calibration and validation are shown in Figure 5, and the calibrated parameters
    are presented in Table 2. The results show that the simulated values were in accordance
    with the observations, with the sharp increase in soil moisture responding to
    water input through irrigation/precipitation, followed by a gradual decrease due
    to continuous evapotranspiration. The values of NRMSE were all less than 6.5%
    and R2 were all above 0.76, which indicated a good performance of this model,
    which was capable of being used for predicting the soil moisture and water balance
    of maize during the crop growth season in the study area. Figure 5. Results of
    soil water balance simulation model calibration (a) and validation (b). Note that
    DAP means “days after planting”. Table 2. Calculated parameters of soil water
    balance simulation model. 3.2. Optimal Irrigation Schedulings under Status Quo
    3.2.1. Optimal Irrigation Scheduling for Different Maize Units The simulation–optimization
    model was used to optimize the irrigation schedules for maize under different
    soil types in different irrigation districts from 2001 to 2010 with the objective
    of maximum crop yield and minimum crop water consumption. The results of optimal
    irrigation schedules under the same soil types in different irrigation districts
    were similar. In this section, the results of maize units in the Daman Irrigation
    District were chosen as an example to be listed and discussed. Figure 6 shows
    Pareto solution curves between maximal crop yield and the minimal crop water consumption
    of maize under different crop types during 2001 to 2010. Figure 6. Relationship
    curves between maximal crop yield and minimal crop water consumption during 2001
    to 2010. It can be seen from Figure 6 that the Pareto solution curves showed a
    trend of inclining to the top right, indicating the obvious conflict relationship
    between the two objectives. This means that, with the improvement of the crop
    water consumption target (decrease in water consumption), the crop yield target
    deteriorated (decrease in production). In other words, with the increase in water
    consumption, the optimal crop yield would show a gradual increase trend. However,
    the optimal crop yield would not increase but would decrease slightly with the
    increase in crop water consumption, when the crop water consumption increased
    to a certain extent (564 mm in T1, 552 mm in T2, 570 mm in T3, and 594 mm in T4).
    The Pareto solution curves in different years almost coincided. The reason was
    that the yield model (water production function) is a quadratic water production
    function, and the shape of the Pareto curves would be similar to those of water
    production curves. For different years, the meteorological data (precipitation
    and reference evapotranspiration) and the maximum irrigation depths of different
    irrigation districts were different. If the irrigation depths for constrains of
    the optimization model were appropriate, the maximum crop yield (the highest point
    of the Pareto curve) would be obtained. Pareto curves under different soil types
    showed that all the curves had the same shapes and different curvatures. Different
    curvatures of the Pareto curves were mainly caused by the differences in soil
    water transformation in various soil types under the same irrigation conditions.
    The recommended irrigation schedule for different soil types was the schedule
    at the highest point of the Pareto curve, (i.e., the irrigation schedule with
    the highest crop yield). Table 3 lists the results of the irrigation schedule
    recommendation in 2010. Table 3. Optimal irrigation schedules under different
    soil types in Danman Irrigation District in 2010. 3.2.2. Water Balance under Optimal
    Irrigation Scheduling Figure 7 shows the terms of water balance and crop yields
    before and after irrigation scheduling optimization under different soil types
    in the Daman Irrigation District from 2001 to 2010. The results show that the
    amount of irrigation water in each year would be significantly reduced with the
    amount of reduction in soil water storage, and the amount of evapotranspiration
    would not change much after the optimization of irrigation scheduling. This indicates
    that soil water storage in farmland would be fully utilized and finally converted
    into evapotranspiration, and then the irrigation water resources could be saved
    after irrigation scheduling optimization. The optimal irrigation depth ranged
    from 147 mm to 341 mm with the highest irrigation water saving potential being
    281 mm after optimization, which was under the T4 soil type in 2003. The highest
    crop yield after irrigation scheduling optimization was about 7.32 t/ha. The results
    of the crop yields showed that the effect of irrigation optimization on crop yield
    was little under the T1 and T2 soil types. While, under the T3 and T4 soil types,
    the crop yields obviously increased after irrigation scheduling optimization from
    2003 to 2005. Crop yield was calculated by the water production functions in this
    paper. If there were little differences in evapotranspiration before and after
    irrigation scheduling optimization, the final crop yield would not change much.
    From 2003 to 2005, the evapotranspiration before irrigation optimization was relatively
    low under the T3 and T4 soil types, so the crop yields were relatively small before
    optimization. The crop yields were also nearly 7.28 t/ha under this condition,
    so the increase in the space of the crop yield is relatively small, and the improvement
    of crop yield was not obvious. However, the main significance of this work is
    to save irrigation water resources and to ensure crop yields by irrigation scheduling
    optimization. Figure 7. Mean values of soil water consumption and supply (positive
    means supply, negative means consumption, ET means evapotranspiration, Q means
    deep percolation, ΔW means changes of water storage, Pre and Aft mean before and
    after optimization) during 2001 to 2010. 3.2.3. Spatial Distribution of Soil Water
    Consumption, Supply and Crop Yield Figure 8 shows the distributions of average
    values of annual evapotranspiration (ET), deep percolation, irrigation depths,
    and the crop yields during the crop growth seasons from 2001 to 2020, before and
    after irrigation scheduling optimization. It can be seen that the spatial distribution
    of ET was more uniform after optimization than before optimization, ranging from
    558 mm to 617 mm before optimization and 541 mm to 575 mm after optimization.
    The deep percolation was less after irrigation scheduling optimization than that
    before optimization (i.e., the amount of water exchange between the root zone
    and the subsoil was 99 mm upward recharge and 147 mm deep percolation); while
    after irrigation scheduling optimization, it was 70 mm upward recharge and 110
    mm deep percolation, indicating that the inefficient water consumption of deep
    percolation would be reduced in the process of maize growth after irrigation scheduling
    optimization. The irrigation depths obviously changed after irrigation scheduling
    optimization. For details, irrigation depth would decrease to 218–337 mm after
    optimization from 315–625 mm before irrigation scheduling optimization. The crop
    yield was both above 7.3 t/ha before and after irrigation scheduling optimization,
    but after optimization the spatial distribution of the crop yield was more uniform.
    The crop yield in the northwest was slightly lower than it in other places before
    and after optimization, because the irrigation quota was relatively lower than
    it in other places. Under the lower irrigation quota, the final optimization solution
    of the Pareto curve would not reach the highest yield point, resulting in the
    lowest optimization yield. Figure 8. Distribution of annual evapotranspiration
    (ET), deep percolation, irrigation amount and crop yield during 2001 to 2010 in
    maize land before and after irrigation optimization conditions. Figure 9 shows
    the average values of annual evapotranspiration (ET), deep percolation, irrigation
    depths, and the crop yields of different irrigation districts during the crop
    growth seasons from 2001 to 2020 before and after irrigation scheduling optimization.
    The results show that the spatial distribution of water consumption and yield
    for the irrigation district was highly variable, which was caused by greatly differing
    maize planting areas of different irrigation districts. The total crop water consumption
    of each irrigation district ranged from 2.91 × 105 m3 to 1.65 × 108 m3 before
    irrigation scheduling optimization, and from 2.71 × 105 m3 to 1.57 × 108 m3 after
    optimization. The total yield of each irrigation district was between 300 tons
    and 310,000 tons before and after optimization, which indicated that the irrigation
    scheduling optimization in this study mainly contributed to decreasing crop water
    consumption. Figure 9. Annual evapotranspiration and crop yields of maize for
    different irrigation districts during 2001 to 2010 before and after irrigation
    optimization conditions. 3.3. Optimal Irrigation Schedulings under Different Climate
    Years 3.3.1. Water Balance under Optimal Irrigation Scheduling Figure 10 shows
    the soil water balance and crop yield of different soil types in the Daman Irrigation
    District after irrigation scheduling optimization under different climate years.
    It can be seen that there was only one term of water consumption during wet year
    (i.e., evapotranspiration). Under wet conditions, precipitation, irrigation and
    soil water in both the root zone and soil below the root zone were all used for
    evapotranspiration. Under the normal year, evapotranspiration was the main consumption
    item of soil water balance. Under the T2, T3, and T4 soil types, there would be
    a small amount of deep percolation under normal conditions. There would also be
    a small amount of deep percolation in the T2 soil during the dry year, while in
    the other soil types there would be only evapotranspiration as water consumption
    under dry conditions. The results of irrigation scheduling optimization show that
    the optimization could help in making full use of water resources and ensuring
    crop yield. Table 4 shows the specific irrigation schedules for maize of different
    soil types. It can be seen from the table that the optimal irrigation schedules
    for different soil types were quite different, which was caused by the solution
    algorithm of this optimization model. In the process of solving the optimization
    model, the genetic algorithm was constantly searching out the solution set that
    meets the conditions, so there would be a large difference in the solution under
    the same situation. However, the simulation–optimization model for irrigation
    scheduling developed in this paper was aimed at providing a means to solve the
    optimal irrigation schedule in different situations. When solving practical problems
    in the future, this model can be used to solve the optimization of irrigation
    schedules according to the actual meteorological conditions and irrigation demands.

    schedules under different soil types in Danman Irrigation District under different
    climate changes. 3.3.2. Spatial Distribution of Soil Water Consumption, Supply,
    and Crop Yield Figure 11 shows the distributions of evapotranspiration (ET) and
    yield under different climate years after irrigation scheduling optimization.
    The results show that the spatial variability of ET in the dry year was the largest,
    ranging from 527 mm to 578 mm, followed by the normal year ranging from 559 mm
    to 585 mm, and the smallest was the wet year, ranging from 563 mm to 575 mm. The
    maximal irrigation quota of the maize in the same irrigation district was the
    same, and the input data of meteorological factors in the same meteorological
    year were the same, so the ET difference was mainly caused by soil types. After
    irrigation scheduling optimization, the maximal yield was similar under different
    climate years, ranging from 7.3 t/ha to 7.34 t/ha. This indicated that the highest
    crop yield can be obtained if irrigation scheduling is optimized. Figure 11. Distribution
    of minimal evapotranspiration (ET) and maximal crop yield under different climate
    years after irrigation optimization conditions. The simulation–optimization model
    built in this study was coupled by the soil water balance simulation model and
    optimization model. The crop yield was calculated by water production function,
    which was related with the parameters. When other researchers use the model to
    solve problems in other study areas, the parameters in water production function
    should be selected carefully or obtained based on field experiments. 4. Conclusions
    To optimize the irrigation scheduling for maize in an arid oasis, we established
    an irrigation scheduling optimization model based on simulation and optimization.
    The simulation part is the soil water balance simulation model and it was calibrated
    and validated by the monitoring data of soil water in maize land of the Yingke
    Irrigation District from 2012 to 2013. The empirical water production function
    is jointed to the optimization model, with the maximum crop yield and the minimum
    water consumption as the objectives, and the maximum irrigation quotas of the
    maize fields in the study area as the constraints. NSGA-II was used to solve the
    optimization model, with the optimal irrigation schedules of the maize in different
    soil types of different irrigation districts under historical meteorological years
    (2001–2010) and different typical climate years (wet year, normal year, dry year).
    The main conclusions are as follows: (1) The simulation model can reflect the
    soil water movement of maize filed during the crop growth period in the study
    area well, with NRMSE less than 6.5% and R2 more than 0.76. (2) The Pareto solution
    curve after irrigation scheduling optimization showed a trend of inclining to
    the upper right, which shows that the yield objective is deteriorating (yield
    reduction) with the improvement of the water consumption objective (water consumption
    reduction). The irrigation schedule with the highest point of the Pareto curve
    (when the yield is the highest) can be selected as the recommended optimal irrigation
    schedule. (3) From 2001 to 2010, the irrigation water-saving potential of the
    study area was between 97 mm and 240 mm, and the average annual optimal yield
    of maize was over 7.3 t/ha, which indicated that the yield of maize could be obtained
    after reasonable irrigation scheduling optimization. (4) The optimal irrigation
    schedules varied greatly in different typical meteorological years, but the crop
    yield can be guaranteed between 7.3t/ha and 7.34t/ha. The simulation–optimization
    model of irrigation schedule established in this paper can provide a technical
    means for the formulation of irrigation schedules to ensure crop yield and save
    irrigation water consumption. Author Contributions Conceptualization, J.L. and

    Abstract Precision agriculture has been increasingly practised in recent years.
    Under precision management, farmland is divided into several management zones
    to implement different strategies and improve irrigation water productivity and
    revenues. In this research, six soil properties (silt, sand, soil moisture content,
    available nitrogen, electrical conductivity and elevation) were selected, and
    fuzzy c-means clustering was used to delineate management zones. The field was
    divided into three zones. The differences in the mean of the soil properties among
    the zones were large and within a zone were small. The coefficient of variation
    of the properties and yield were also smaller than that before classification.
    The optimization was carried out by using a genetic algorithm based on the Jensen
    model. Three objective functions were set as maximum yield, maximum irrigation
    water productivity (IWP) and maximum revenue, and the weights were kept equal
    to 1/3. The WHCNS (soil water heat carbon nitrogen simulator) model was used to
    simulate the maize yield under optimized irrigation schedule for the three management
    zones and to calculate IWP and revenue. Compared with uniform management, IWP
    and revenue were increased by 0.6 kg m−3 and $61 ha−1, respectively. The optimized
    irrigation schedule can be used as a reference for the actual irrigation management.
    It can increase the IWP and revenue under the premise of achieving the target
    yield. The results show that the method can guide precision agricultural production
    and management in large-scale farmland. Similar content being viewed by others

    2014 Introduction High spatial variability is usually found in soils. In consequence,
    uniform management of fields does not take into account the spatial variability,
    and it is not the most effective management strategy (Marques da Silva 2006; Moral
    et al. 2010). Nowadays, farm areas are rapidly increasing in China due to the
    implementation of the land transfer policy. Farming is becoming more mechanized
    and less labor-intensive. However, uniform and extensive management without considering
    spatial variability of soil properties does not support the sustainable development
    of agriculture (Marques da Silva and Silva 2008; Moral et al. 2010). Precision
    agriculture is considered to be a feasible way to achieve sustainable agriculture
    (Corwin et al. 1999; Moral et al. 2010). According to the distribution of various
    soil properties and different water and nutrition requirement patterns of crops
    in different regions, farmland may be partitioned into different zones to “adjust
    measures to varied conditions”. Spatial variability of soil properties such as
    soil water content, nutrients and topographical features result in variable crop
    yields (Basso et al. 2009; Li et al. 2016; Zhao et al. 2018). Fuzzy c-means clustering
    (FCM) (Bezdeck et al. 1984; Jaynes et al. 2003; Bragato 2004) is an effective
    clustering technique in pattern recognition that has been widely implemented in
    applications, such as Management Zone Analyst (MZA) (Fridgen et al. 2004; Li et
    al. 2007). In MZA software, Fuzziness Performance Index (FPI) and Normalized Classification
    Entropy (NCE) are available to determine the optimal number of management zones
    (Li et al. 2007; Albornoz et al. 2017; Kyaw et al. 2008). A number of variables
    have been analyzed and filtered to extract the soil properties that have a greater
    impact on yield and are used as the basis for zoning and fuzzy clustering by using
    MZA with FCM as the algorithm core (Shukla et al. 2004; Guastaferro et al. 2010;
    Moharana et al. 2019). Some studies have addressed apparent electrical conductivity
    (ECa) as a potential estimator of soil properties and nutrients (Corwin and Lesch
    2003), and the division of homogeneous zones based on the spatial distribution
    of ECa (Corwin and Lesch 2003; Peralta and Costa 2013; Peralta et al. 2013). In
    northwest China, agriculture accounts for about 90% of total water consumption
    (Kang et al. 2017). Regulated deficit irrigation is based on the relationship
    between the crop and water, and applies a suitable water deficit during given
    growth stages. Regulated deficit irrigation saves water, produces higher yields
    and improves water use efficiency of crops. Studies have shown that irrigating
    at 60–80% of potential evapotranspiration did not significantly affect maize yield
    (Domínguez et al. 2012a, b; Zhang et al. 2012), and water stress imposed on maize
    during low-sensitive growth stages had less significant impact on yield reduction
    than during high-sensitive growth stages (Mansourifar et al. 2010). Therefore,
    regulated deficit irrigation has both economic and ecological benefits, especially
    in areas where water resources are scarce and water price is relatively high (Kang
    et al. 2000; Du et al. 2010). The water production function based on regulated
    deficit irrigation theory can well describe the relationship between crop yield
    and the amount of irrigation water or evapotranspiration during each growth stage.
    Many studies have shown that a quasi-empirical model between crop yield and irrigation
    water amount can simulate crop yields for different water allocations under diverse
    irrigation schedules (Botes et al. 1996; Kipkorir and Raes 2002; Wen et al. 2017).
    Solving the water production function with the aid of mathematical methods (such
    as genetic algorithm, dynamic programming algorithm) may produce an optimal solution
    for actual irrigation management based on the optimal irrigation schedule (Anwar
    and Haq 2013; Sadati et al. 2014). However, most studies have focused on variation
    of parameters of soil and crops in specific small size experimental fields and
    not on the establishment of irrigation schedules in large-scale farmland with
    variable soil textures. While empirical models such as the Jensen model are very
    effective, they cannot reflect the dynamic processes affecting crop water requirement
    and growth in a realistic manner (Nguyen et al. 2017). To evaluate the impact
    of different irrigation management strategies, a number of process-based crop
    models, such as EPIC (Ko et al. 2009), DSSAT (Corbeels et al. 2016), RZWQM (Ma
    et al. 2012), APSIM (Keating et al. 2003), and AquaCrop (Abedinpour et al. 2012),
    can effectively simulate crop yields, soil water movement and transport under
    different management strategies, soil and climate conditions. Recently, an integrated
    soil-crop model, WHCNS, was developed by Liang et al. (2016a). It has been successfully
    adapted to analyze and evaluate the effects of various field management practices
    on soil water movement, soil heat transfer, soil N transport, crop growth and
    yield (Li et al. 2015b; Liang et al. 2016b, 2017). This model has been proved
    to be suitable for current highly intensive agricultural management in North China,
    such as conservation tillage, film mulching, annually double-crop rotation, high-density
    planting and high water and fertilizer inputs (Liang et al. 2017; Li et al. 2015b).
    A model-independent parameter estimation (PEST) program was coupled to easily
    determine and verify the parameters of the WHCNS model (Liang et al. 2016a, c)
    and improve the modeling accuracy. Revenue analysis was used to obtain the potential
    of economic upgrading to provide scientific advice for agricultural production
    (Dejonge et al. 2007). The main objectives of this study were to (1) delineate
    management zones for farmland based on the six major properties obtained by correlation
    analysis, (2) optimize irrigation schedule by coupling the Jensen model with a
    genetic algorithm in each management zone, and (3) analyze the promotion potential
    of yield, IWP and revenue in the whole region under an optimized irrigation schedule
    by the WHCNS model. Materials and methods Experimental site description, sampling
    and measurements The study was conducted on a 54-ha maize field in Huangyanghe
    Farm, located in Wuwei City, Gansu Province, China (102°55′E, 37°49′N). The experiment
    was carried out from April to September during 2016 and 2017. The experimental
    site is in an arid inland desert climate where light and heat resources are abundant.
    Mean annual sunshine duration is about 3000 h, mean frost-free days are more than
    150 days, mean annual temperature is 8.8 °C and annual accumulated temperature
    (> 0 °C) of 3550 °C. Water resources are scarce, with a mean annual precipitation
    of 164 mm and mean annual pan evaporation of approximately 2000 mm. Groundwater
    is the main source of irrigation, and the water table was below 40–50 m (Li et
    al. 2015a). In 2016, the experiment area was 6.8 ha (120 × 570 m). The distribution
    of sampling points is shown in Fig. 1b in the red line frame area. A uniform grid
    of 30 × 30 m was evenly divided over the study area and 15 extra points were added
    to improve the accuracy of determining the spatial variability of soil properties;
    there were 91 sampling observation points. In view of the practical difficulty
    of machinery operation (such as farmland levelling, weeding, harvesting, etc.)
    in the sub-area of the field, the study area was expanded in 2017 to the whole
    field. In 2017, the experimental area was 54 ha with a uniform grid of 70 × 70
    m divided evenly over the test field. There were a total of 110 sampling observation
    points to measure maize yield and soil attributes (Fig. 1a). The position and
    elevation of each sample location were recorded by a hand-held GNSS receiver.
    The accuracies of elevation and position measurements were 5.0 mm + 0.5 mm and
    3 mm + 0.5 mm, respectively. ArcGIS 10.2 (ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA) was used to
    draw the spatial distribution maps of soil properties (Figs. 1, 3). The experimental
    field was irrigated with a total amount of 480 mm and 460 mm in 2016 and 2017,
    respectively. Drip irrigation was adopted to deliver water in the field. The irrigation
    and effective precipitation during the growth stage of maize in 2016–2017 are
    shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 1 The sampling location and elevation map produced by ArcGIS
    10.2 of the field in 2016 (b) and 2017 (a) Full size image Fig. 2 Precipitation
    and irrigation during the period of maize in 2016–2017 Full size image Soil samples
    were collected by using 20-mm-diameter soil sampling tubes in the 0–200, 200–400,
    400–600, 600–800 and 800–1000 mm depths at each GNSS location before sowing (on
    29th March 2016 and 2nd April 2017). Soil water content (SWC) was determined using
    oven drying method (O’Kelly 2004). Soil samples were collected by cutting rings
    (with a volume of 103 mm3) for measurements of bulk density (BD) by oven drying
    method (Blake 1965). The air-dried soil samples were divided into two sub-samples.
    One was sieved through a 2-mm mesh for particle-size analysis by using a MasterSizer
    2000 laser particle size analyzer (Malvern Instruments Ltd., Worcestershire, UK)
    (Ryzak and Bieganowski 2011). The other was passed through a 0.25-mm mesh for
    the measurement of available nitrogen (AN) and electrical conductivity (EC1:5).
    AN was determined using a continuous flow analyzer (AutoAnalyzer 3, Bran + Luebbe,
    SEAL Analytical GmbH, Norderstedt, Germany) (Kamphake et al. 1967; Garten et al.
    2007). EC1:5 was determined in a 1:5 (soil:water) suspension using the electrometric
    method (Slavich and Petterson 1993). During the growth period of maize, SWC and
    AN were measured before and after irrigation and after effective precipitation
    (> 5 mm) using oven drying method and a continuous flow analyzer, respectively,
    to calibrate the WHCNS model parameters. Leaf area index (LAI) was measured by
    Sunscan canopy analyzer (Delta-T Devices Ltd., Cambridge, UK) at the five critical
    growth stages (seedling, jointing, heading, filling and harvesting) of maize,
    and was corrected by manual measurement. Yield (grain yield) was measured in 100
    m2 square area centered on each sampling location after the maize maturity, then
    100-seed sample was selected randomly, weighed, and further dried for 72 h at
    85 °C to determine the seed moisture (Li and Shao 2014). Finally, all sampling
    yields were converted into the grain weight with 13% moisture content using the
    seed moisture data. Geostatistical analyses The spatial characteristics of soil
    properties were analyzed by geostatistical methods which characterize and determine
    distribution patterns such as randomness, uniformity and spatial trend (Rossi
    et al. 1992; Warrick and Nielsen 1980). The semivariogram was estimated using
    the following equation (Isaaks and Srivastava 1989): $$\\gamma (h) = \\frac{1}{2N(h)}\\sum\\limits_{i
    = 1}^{N(h)} {\\left[ {z(x_{i} + h) - z(x_{i} )} \\right]^{2} }$$ (1) where γ(h)
    is the semivariance value at distance interval h, h is the sample spacing, N(h)
    indicates the total number of samples with a distance h, z(xi) and z(xi+ h) is
    expressed as the distance h for the value of two sampling points, xi and xi+ h.
    The semivariograms were used to interpolate the soil properties by ordinary kriging
    after checking geo-statistical common assumptions (Isaaks and Srivastava 1989),
    using ArcGIS 10.2 (ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA). Management zone classification Through
    screening the parameters that influenced the yield by correlation analysis, soil
    properties significantly related to yield were identified as the major ones for
    management zone classification. Management Zone Analyst software (Fridgen et al.
    2004) was used to cluster these properties. The core of MZA software was the FCM
    algorithm. Essentially, FCM is an iterative process. At first, the continuous
    classification is carried out to find the cluster centre, and then reclassified
    to obtain different clusters based on the membership degree. Two performance indices,
    FPI and NCE, determined the optimal number of clusters. FPI was an index to represent
    the number of membership sharing (fuzziness) among classes, which is used to measure
    the degree of separation between different classes. The range of FPI was from
    0 to 1, the values close to 0 indicating greater differences between the management
    zones. NCE determined the amount of disorganization created after the division
    of the region, and ranged from 0 to 1. NCE values approaching 0 indicate that
    the decomposition of the clustering is large and the clustering effect is good.
    The best classification was determined when NCE and FPI were at a minimum, representing
    the least membership sharing (FPI) and greatest amount of organization (NCE) as
    an optimal result of the clustering process (Fridgen et al. 2004). The measure
    of similarity (Euclidean distance) and the fuzziness exponent (1.30) were set
    at the default values (Odeh et al. 1992; Fridgen et al. 2004). Description of
    models Jensen model The Jensen model is a static model that describes the macro
    relationship between yield and water (Jensen 1968) without considering the micro-mechanism
    of how dry matter accumulates in the process of crop growth and development. The
    Jensen model can consider the effect of irrigation time and amount on the yield
    in each stage, and the calculated water sensitive index (Tsakiris 1982) reflects
    the sensitivity of water deficit to crop yield in each stage (Zhang et al. 2006).
    The Jensen model is expressed as follows: $$y = \\frac{Y}{{Y_{m} }} = \\prod\\limits_{i
    = 1}^{n} {\\left( {\\frac{{ET_{ai} }}{{ET_{mi} }}} \\right)}^{{\\lambda_{i} }}$$
    (2) where y is relative yield, Y is actual yield (kg ha−1), Ym is the adequate
    maximum yield of a crop when the water supply is adequate (kg ha−1), i is each
    growth stage in the growth period of maize, ETai is the actual evapotranspiration
    in the crop growth stage i (mm), ETmi is the maximum evapotranspiration in the
    crop growth stage i (mm), and λi is the water sensitivity index in the crop growth
    stage i. In this study, ETa was calculated by the water balance formula based
    on the measured data. Deep percolation, groundwater recharge and surface runoff
    were neglected, and the water balance formula simplified as: $$ET_{ai} = I_{i}
    + P_{i} - \\Delta W_{i}$$ (3) where \\(\\Delta W_{i} { = }z \\cdot (\\theta_{i
    + 1} - \\theta_{i} )\\), Ii and Pi are irrigation and precipitation in growth
    stage i (mm) respectively, ∆Wi is the change in soil water content from growth
    stage i to i + 1 (mm), θi is the volumetric water content in day i (cm3 cm−3),
    and z is the depth of soil layer (mm). According to the data obtained from the
    field experiment in 2015 at Shiyanghe Experimental Station (Zhou 2016), the growth
    period of maize was divided into five stages: seedling, jointing, heading, filling
    and harvesting. Equation (2) can be rewritten as: $$Z_{i} (t) = \\sum\\limits_{i
    = 1}^{n} {\\lambda_{i} } x_{i}$$ (4) where t represents the number of days after
    sowing. Zi(t) is the cumulative function, and λi can be calculated using Eq. (5):
    $$\\lambda_{i} { = }Z_{i}^{{}} (t) - Z_{i - 1}^{{}} (t)$$ (5) The water sensitivity
    index of each growth stage can be calculated (Table 1) (Guo et al. 1996). A logistic
    curve could describe the change in the cumulative value of λ over time (Wang et
    al. 1997): $$Z(t) = \\frac{K}{{1 + e^{b - mt} }}$$ (6) where K, b, and m are empirical
    parameters. λ is calculated according to the variation of the logistic curve (Guo
    et al. 1996; Wang et al. 1997). Table 1 Maximum evapotranspiration (ETm) calculated
    using water balance, precipitation (P), and water sensitivity index (λ) value
    in the critical growth stages of maize in 2015 Full size table Genetic algorithm
    As a global optimization search algorithm, a genetic algorithm has strong robustness
    and is suitable for parallel processing and efficient application. A genetic algorithm
    simulates a very effective optimization model, which evolves naturally to deal
    with large and highly complex systems (Reca and Martinez 2006). It has a “survival
    and detection” iterative search algorithm, which effectively solves the optimization
    problem. Reproduction, crossover and mutation constitute the basic operation of
    a genetic algorithm. The computational procedure of the genetic algorithm can
    be globally divided into the following steps: (1) receive input data, (2) user
    interface to enter genetic algorithms, (3) define chromosome to represent problem,
    (4) decode chromosome into real number, (5) set constraints, (6) fitness value
    from object function, and (7) reproduction, crossover, and mutation (Kuo et al.
    2000). Calculating the maximum or minimum value of function is the optimization
    process of a genetic algorithm. It can be described as (Georgiou and Papamichail
    2008): $$\\hbox{max} :f(x){\\kern 1pt} {\\kern 1pt} {\\kern 1pt} {\\kern 1pt}
    {\\kern 1pt} {\\kern 1pt} {\\kern 1pt} {\\kern 1pt} {\\kern 1pt} {\\kern 1pt}
    {\\kern 1pt} {\\kern 1pt} {\\kern 1pt} {\\kern 1pt} s.t.:\\,a_{j} \\le x_{j} \\le
    b_{j}$$ (7) where x = {xj} is the optimal set of variables, [aj, bj] is the range
    of xj, and f(x) is the objective function. Three objective functions were set,
    including maximum yield, maximum irrigation water productivity (IWP, kg m−3),
    and maximum revenue (R, $ ha−1): $$\\begin{aligned} \\hbox{max} \\,{\\text{y}}
    & = \\frac{{Y_{a} }}{{Y_{m} }} \\cdot \\prod\\limits_{i = 1}^{n} {\\left( {\\frac{{ET_{ai}
    }}{{ET_{mi} }}} \\right)}^{{\\lambda {\\text{i}}}} \\\\ \\hbox{max} \\,IWP & =
    {{Y_{a} } \\mathord{\\left/ {\\vphantom {{Y_{a} } {{{\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^{n}
    {I_{i} } } \\mathord{\\left/ {\\vphantom {{\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^{n} {I_{i} }
    } {10}}} \\right. \\kern-0pt} {10}}}}} \\right. \\kern-0pt} {{{\\sum\\limits_{i
    = 1}^{n} {I_{i} } } \\mathord{\\left/ {\\vphantom {{\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^{n}
    {I_{i} } } {10}}} \\right. \\kern-0pt} {10}}}} \\\\ \\hbox{max} \\,R & = P_{\\text{m}}
    \\cdot Y_{a} - 10 \\times P_{w} \\cdot \\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^{n} {I_{i} } - \\sum
    C \\\\ \\end{aligned}$$ (8) where Pm is the price of maize grain ($0.36 kg−1),
    Pw is the price of irrigation water ($0.05 m−3), R is revenue ($ ha−1), and ∑C
    is the rest of costs about $906 ha−1, including fertilizer, pesticides, harvest,
    transport and field pipe costs (according to 2013–2017 record data provided by
    Administration Department of Huangyanghe Farm). The relationship between crop
    yield and irrigation volume was described by the Jensen model. Based on the deficit
    irrigation theory, irrigation can be described as: $$I_{i} = ET_{ai} - P_{i}$$
    (9) Constraint condition setting in GA: $$\\begin{aligned} I_{i\\hbox{min} } &
    \\le I_{i} \\le I_{i\\hbox{max} } \\\\ I_{\\hbox{min} } & \\le I \\le I_{\\hbox{max}
    } \\\\ Y_{\\text{a}} & \\ge Y_{\\hbox{min} } \\\\ \\end{aligned}$$ (10) where
    Ymin is the minimum yield (kg ha−1); Iimax and Iimin are the maximum and minimum
    value of the irrigation water in the growth stage of i (mm), respectively; and
    Imax and Imin are the maximum and minimum amount of irrigation in the whole growth
    period (mm), respectively. According to the experimental data and research data
    in 2016, Ymin= 4000 kg ha−1, Iimax= 200 mm, Imax= 500 mm, Iimin= 0 mm, and Imin= 0
    mm were set in this study. WHCNS model The WHCNS model consists of five main modules,
    including soil water, soil heat, soil C, soil N and crop growth modules. The model
    integrates key processes, including soil evaporation, crop transpiration, soil
    water movement, runoff, soil temperature, mineralization of fresh crop residue
    and soil organic N, soil inorganic N immobilization in biomass, nitrification,
    ammonia volatilization, denitrification and nitrous oxide emissions, and crop
    growth. In the model structure, the reference crop evapotranspiration (ET0) was
    estimated using the Penman–Monteith equation for standard grass 0.12 m tall and
    a surface resistance of 70 s m−1. The crop coefficient (Kc) was used to calculate
    actual crop potential evaporation. Potential crop transpiration and potential
    soil evaporation were separated using leaf area index (LAI). The soil water movement
    and heat conduction were simulated using Hydrus-1D (Šimůnek 2008; Šimůnek et al.
    2016). C and N cycling was simulated by using Daisy model (Hansen et al. 1991),
    and the crop module was used by the improved version of PS123 model (Liang et
    al. 2016c). A detailed model description is available in the literature (Liang
    et al. 2016a). The model inputs required were site location (latitude and elevation),
    basic soil physical and chemical properties, crop data (sowing and harvesting
    time, planting density, planting depth and crop varieties), field management,
    initial soil water and available nitrogen contents, and daily meteorological data
    (maximum and minimum air temperature, air humidity, solar radiation, wind speed
    and precipitation). Model performance criteria The crop parameters were calibrated
    using measured data in 2016. Calibration was performed using a ‘trial-and-error’
    approach to adjust the crop parameters to achieve the best possible agreement
    between simulated and measured LAI and yield. After calibration, field data measured
    in 2017 was used to validate the model. The soil C and N transformation in the
    model was obtained using default parameters of the model. The calibrated crop
    parameters are shown in Table 2. The simulation results were evaluated by normalized
    root mean square error (nRMSE), agreement index (d) and modeling efficiency index
    (E): $$nRMSE = \\frac{{\\sqrt {\\sum\\nolimits_{i = 1}^{n} {\\left( {S_{i} - O_{i}
    } \\right)^{2} /n} } }}{{\\overline{O} }} \\times 100$$ (11) $$d = 1 - \\frac{{\\sum\\nolimits_{i
    = 1}^{n} {\\left( {S_{i} - O_{i} } \\right)^{2} } }}{{\\sum\\nolimits_{i = 1}^{n}
    {\\left( {\\left| {S_{i} - \\overline{O} } \\right| + \\left| {O_{i} - \\overline{O}
    } \\right|} \\right)^{2} } }}$$ (12) $$E = 1 - \\frac{{\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^{n}
    {\\left( {S_{i} - O_{i} } \\right)^{2} } }}{{\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^{n} {\\left(
    {O_{i} - \\overline{O} } \\right)^{2} } }}$$ (13) where n is the number of samples,
    Si and Oi are simulated and measured values, respectively, and \\(\\overline{\\text{O}}\\)
    is the mean of the measured value. For the most accurate prediction, nRMSE was
    close to 0. Agreement index (d) represents the ratio of the mean square error
    and the potential error. The simulated value agreed well with the measured value
    when d = 1 (Willmott 1982). E ranged from − ∞ to 1, and when E = 1 it corresponds
    to a perfect match between the simulated values and measured data (Nash and Sutcliffe
    1970). Previous research showed an acceptable simulation should have E > 0.36
    and d > 0.7 (van Liew and Garbrecht 2003). Table 2 Calibrated crop parameters
    used in WHCNS model Full size table Results and discussion Conventional statistics,
    correlation analysis and geostatistical analysis The descriptive statistics of
    yield, topography (elevation, slope and aspect), soil particle size (sand, clay
    and silt), SWC, AN and EC1:5 (in 0–600 and 600–1000 mm layer) are summarized in
    Table 3. Particle size measured in 2016 was similar to those in 2017. The BD decreased
    with increasing depth because the surface layer had been compacted by agricultural
    machinery. Each layer of BD showed weak variability with coefficient of variation
    (CV) < 10%. According to the classification of variability (Warrick and Nielsen.
    1980), the silt content showed weak variability but clay and sand showed moderate
    variability (sand > clay > silt) in each layer. For the topography in the area
    in 2016, CV of elevation was 0.09%, which showed weak variability. CV was 21%
    and 48% for slope and aspect, respectively, and both showed moderate variability.
    In the study area in 2017, the lowest CV value of 0.17% was for elevation and
    showed weak variability. CV was 41% and 58% for slope and aspect, respectively,
    and both showed moderate variability. CV of the properties measured in 2017 was
    higher than those in 2016. Table 3 Descriptive statistics of soil properties,
    soil water content, available nitrogen, electrical conductivity and topography
    of the whole field measured in 2017 Full size table Nitrogen in soil is more mobile
    than phosphorus and potassium (Xue et al. 2017), and the effect of soil salinity
    on crops should not be ignored, so the spatial distribution of AN and EC1:5 should
    be considered (Qi et al. 2018; Yang et al. 2019). The EC1:5 value of each layer
    was about 0.2 dS m−1, indicating that there was no soil salinization in the study
    area. The variability of AN was larger than that of the SWC and EC1:5. This was
    caused by variation of soil texture, unevenness of fertilization during the management
    of previous crop, and the obvious differences of nitrogen uptake by crop (Deng
    and Tabatabai 1997; Khorsandi and Nourbakhsh 2008). Furthermore, with increasing
    soil depth, CV of all properties decreased. This was because precipitation and
    other external conditions have little influence on deeper soil. Table 4 shows
    the correlation between the properties and maize yield. For this field, maize
    yield was significantly and positively correlated to silt content, SWC and AN,
    while elevation, sand content and EC1:5 were significantly and negatively correlated
    with yield. These properties mainly affected maize growth. Properties such as
    slope, aspect and clay were not significantly correlated to yield. These results
    were similar to other research (Cambardella et al. 1994; Timlin et al. 1998; Machado
    et al. 2002). The spatial distribution map of each property (Fig. 3) shows that
    the distribution was similar to the yield. With high yield in the northern region,
    the clay content, SWC and AN were higher, while the elevation, EC1:5 and sand
    content were lower than other regions. Table 4 Correlation between topography,
    soil properties, soil water content, available nitrogen, electrical conductivity
    and maize yield in 2017 Full size table Fig. 3 Spatial distribution maps produced
    by ordinary Kriging for silt, sand, soil water content (SWC), available nitrogen
    (AN), electrical conductivity (EC1:5) and yield Full size image The semivariogram
    model of EC1:5 and yield are spherical, while elevation, silt, sand, SWC and AN
    were exponential respectively (Table 5). The range of the properties varied between
    83.2 and 233.1 m. SWC had a moderate spatial dependency, and others had a strong
    spatial dependency. In order to intuitively reflect the spatial distribution of
    yield and soil properties, the semivariogram models were used in an ordinary kriging
    procedure to estimate values in non-measured areas as interpolated values for
    mapping (Figs. 1, 3). Table 5 Semivariogram models and spatial distribution parameters
    of yield and key soil properties in the whole field Full size table Delineation
    of management zones Variability of factors requires delineation of zones for better
    management. Six properties significantly correlated to the yield were silt, sand,
    SWC, AN, EC1:5 and elevation based on the results of correlation analysis (Table
    4), and they were used to obtain clusters by the FCM algorithm. Six clusters to
    be the maximum were considered, and the optimal partition number was determined
    when FPI and NCE were minimum at the same time. In this study, the number of clusters
    of three was obtained when both FPI and NCE were minimum at the same time (Fig.
    4). Therefore, the field was divided into three management zones, namely Z1, Z2
    and Z3. Fig. 4 Calculated Fuzziness Performance Index (FPI) and Normalized Classification
    Entropy (NCE) for the field Full size image Considering the elevation, sand, silt,
    SWC, AN and EC1:5, the map with three delineated zones had obvious regional differences
    from the spatial distribution. The yield in Z1 corresponded to the high yield
    area, while Z3 corresponded to the region with low yield by comparing the distribution
    map of management zones and the measured yield (Fig. 5). After delineation, the
    areas of Z1, Z2 and Z3 were 10.8, 26.0 and 17.2 ha, respectively. Main properties
    controlling yield in each delineated area were analyzed statistically. The yield
    in Z1 was the highest, and the corresponding SWC and AN were the highest in the
    three zones. SWC and AN decreased with decreasing yield in Z2 and Z3. For the
    soil texture, sand content was low and silt content was high in Z1, but Z3 had
    an opposite trend, while variation in sand and silt content in Z2 was in between
    Z1 and Z3 (Table 6). Fig. 5 Management zones map (left) and spatial distribution
    of maize yield (right) in the field Full size image Table 6 Mean, coefficient
    of variation statistics and one-way variance analysis of yield and key properties
    in different management zones in 2017 Full size table After delineating the three
    management zones, several differences between regions were observed. The degree
    of variability of most properties, expressed as CV, was smaller after delineation
    for each management zone than that of the entire field. The average of the mean
    sand, SWC, AN and EC1:5 within each management zone were significant at P < 0.01
    probability level, for silt and yield, at P < 0.05 probability level (Table 6).
    There were significant differences in the values of properties among the management
    zones, as well as decreased differences within zones. Clusters consolidated regions
    with similar characteristics and made delineated zones more homogenized. Therefore,
    delineation results in management zones (Table 6) are acceptable. Optimization
    of irrigation schedule Water sensitivity index is an important parameter reflecting
    the sensitivity of the degree of water deficit in different growth stages of a
    crop. Water sensitivity index is related to the growth stage and development,
    and the exchange of energy between crops and the environment. Table 1 shows that
    the water sensitivity index at filling, jointing and heading stages was higher
    (λ > 0.19) than mature and seedling stages (λ < 0.14), which indicated a high
    level of water sensitivity at those stages. The appropriate degree of water deficit
    at seedling and harvesting stages would not suppress maize growth (Kang et al.
    2000). The minimum water sensitivity index at the seedling stage was 0.043, which
    indicated that the effect of water deficit on maize yield at seedling stage was
    the lowest. These results were consistent with other literature (Pandey et al.
    2000; Çakir 2004). Comparison of measured and simulated yields showed that the
    Jensen model predicted maize yield well with R2 of 0.95 (Fig. 6). Fig. 6 Comparison
    of measured yield with simulated yield (relative yield) obtained by the Jensen
    model based on the data from Zhou (2016) Full size image ETa at each stage of
    maize growth was calculated to optimize the reasonable irrigation schedule in
    each zone. In different zones, the water consumption of maize during the whole
    growth period was different (Table 7). The yield in Z1 was higher than that in
    Z3 because their soil textures are different, and that impacted the soil water
    holding capacity and infiltration (Mamedov et al. 2001; Wakindiki 2002). Table
    7 Maximum evapotranspiration (ETm) in different management zones and precipitation
    (P) during the entire growth period of maize in 2017 Full size table In this study,
    the Jensen model was established based on the calculated water sensitivity index
    (Table 1). An optimal irrigation schedule was obtained by the Jensen model (Eq.
    7) with genetic algorithm (Table 8). Most of the irrigation was applied during
    the period of jointing, heading and filling; in particular, about 70% of the total
    irrigation was applied at the jointing and heading stages. These three stages
    were critical for maize and were sensitive to water deficit, and the results also
    agreed with the water sensitivity index values. Compared with the measurements,
    the simulated yield by the Jensen model under the optimized irrigation schedule
    changed from − 0.88 to 1.88% but, in Z3, the simulated yield increased by 136
    kg ha−1 compared to the measured yield. In Z1 and Z2, the target yield of the
    field was achieved (≥ 6800 kg ha−1). In 2016 and 2017, the optimal irrigation
    amounts calculated by the Jensen model were 130 mm and 140 mm lower than the uniform
    managed by farmers during the entire growth period of maize, respectively. However,
    the difference between measured and simulated yields were very small, and the
    range of change was less than 2%. Consequently, IWP improved further. The simulated
    IWP increased to about 0.60 kg m−3 compared with the measurement, and demonstrated
    that the optimized irrigation schedule reduces the water loss and improves irrigation
    water use efficiency. Table 8 Comparison of simulated maize yield by the Jensen
    model, calculated irrigation water productivity (IWP) and revenue (R) under optimal
    irrigation schedule in different management zones with that obtained by measurement
    Full size table Analysis of improvement potential WHCNS model calibration and
    validation Measurements in 2016 were used to calibrate the parameters and, in
    2017, were used as validation and simulation. By comparing the measured and simulated
    values, it was found that WHCNS simulated crop LAI and the yield well (Fig. 7).
    The variation of LAI was consistent with time, and differences between measured
    and simulated LAI at each growth period were small, with d > 0.96 and E > 0.8.
    The correlation between simulated and measured yields was high in both years,
    with R2 of 0.91 and 0.88, respectively (Fig. 7). Values of d and E of simulated
    yields were greater than 0.93 and 0.81, respectively, which indicated that the
    simulated yields were all in good agreement with the measured values (Fig. 7).
    However, for areas with yield more than 8500 kg ha−1, simulated yield was lower
    than the measured, while for areas with yield less than 6000 kg ha−1, the model
    overestimated the measured yields. Fig. 7 WHCNS calibration and validation based
    on measured yield and leaf area index (LAI) in 2016 (a) and 2017 (b) Full size
    image Yield, irrigation water productivity and revenue improvement In practical
    irrigation management, timing of irrigation is not easy to change for large-scale
    farmland with drip irrigation because of the irrigation rotation schedule and
    design flow rate of motor-pumped wells. So, the optimal irrigation amount was
    used in the simulations under optimized irrigation schedule by using WHCNS, while
    the original timing was used. Revenue is an important factor to be considered
    with efficient water use and water saving. Figure 8 showed the spatial distribution
    of simulated yield, IWP and revenue (R). The simulated revenue after optimization
    was $71 ha−1 more than the actual revenue ($1394 ha−1) in 2016. In the three management
    zones, Z1, Z2 and Z3, the revenue after optimization increased by $3 ha−1, $49
    ha−1, and $95 ha−1 in 2017, respectively. In most regions, revenue under optimization
    was $1.88 to $132.81 ha−1 higher than the revenue under uniform management. In
    Z1 and most areas of Z2, the improvement of revenue was lower than $40 ha−1 because
    high yields under uniform management generated high revenue. Fig. 8 The improvement
    of the simulated yield, irrigation water productivity (IWP), and revenue (R) relative
    to the measurement in 2017 Full size image In Z3 and some parts of Z2, yield simulated
    by the crop model under-optimized irrigation schedule was 40 to 130 kg·ha−1 higher
    than measured yield, although irrigation applied was significantly less than uniform
    management. As a result, optimized revenues were higher than uniform irrigation
    management because lower irrigation costs increased revenue significantly. In
    contrast, maize yield decreased in some parts of the delineated zones. The largest
    decline was about 806 kg ha−1 when the irrigation amount was reduced by 130 mm
    compared with uniform management; however, there was a small increase in revenue
    (< $5 ha−1) based on lower irrigation costs. The two objective functions selected
    were to maximize IWP and economic benefits. It was inefficient to use excessive
    amounts of irrigation application to achieve high yield. Instead, more rational
    decision-making was taken into consideration. Optimized IWP improved from 0.02
    to 0.77 kg m−3 in the whole field, and among delineated zones, it increased by
    0.55, 0.61 and 0.65 kg m−3 in Z1, Z2, and Z3, respectively (Fig. 8), indicating
    that water use efficiency also improved. In summary, under the optimized irrigation
    management based on different management zones, while yield changed from − 11.51
    to 1.89%, IWP and revenue increased by 0.13–45.29% and 0.13–9.23%, respectively.
    Conclusions For large areas of farmland, excessive and uniform irrigation schedules
    often fail to produce an optimal combination of yield, IWP and revenue, but zoning
    management can effectively achieve the goal. Implementing different management
    methods in delineating management zones is an effective way to improve IWP and
    revenue with a good trade-off between yield and water consumption. Based on the
    spatial variability of soil properties, simulations by the calibrated model showed
    that an optimal irrigation schedule in different zones increased IWP and revenue
    with decreases in irrigation compared with uniform management. Although yield
    in some areas decreased slightly, the target yield was achieved in most areas.
    Results showed that the combination of algorithm and crop model could provide
    an acceptable irrigation schedule and save time and labour, and guide the agricultural
    production and management in large-scale farmland, such as how to classify the
    management zones, and how to make a suitable irrigation schedule in different
    zones. Integrating algorithm and crop model to advance knowledge of these combinations
    will go some way to addressing these knowledge gaps. References Abedinpour, M.,

  description: Determining the best management practices (BMPs) under different initial
    soil mineral N (ISMN) levels is helpful to improve water and N use efficiencies
    (WUE, NUE) and protect the environment. In this study, a two-year field experiment
    of spring maize was conducted from 2014 to 2015 in northwest China. Five treatments
    were designed, including one local farmer practice (I480-4N280, 280 kg N ha−1
    fertilizer and irrigated 480 mm with four irrigation events) and four conservation
    treatments (I420-4N200, I420-5N200, I420-6N200 and I420-7N200, standing for 200
    kg N ha−1 fertilizer and irrigated 420 mm with four to seven irrigation events,
    respectively). Measured yield, leaf area index, soil water content and soil nitrate
    concentration were used to evaluate a soil-crop model (WHCNS, soil Water Heat
    Carbon Nitrogen Simulator), which was then used to simulate the effects of water
    and N management practices on water consumption, N fates, and crop growth. Then,
    the integrated index considering the agronomic, economic, and environmental impacts
    was simulated using 35,100 combinations of irrigation and fertilizer N scenarios,
    which were designed to develop BMPs under different ISMN levels (ranging from
    0 to 625 kg N ha-1 in a 1.8 m-soil profile) and seasons of weather data (from
    2001 to 2015). Results showed I420-5N200 was the best with a high yield, WUE and
    NUE, and low N loss among five treatments. The optimal irrigation amount (ranging
    from 350−600 mm) was related to precipitation amount. The optimal N rate decreased
    linearly with the increase of ISMN when ISMN was <384 kg ha−1, and reached a plateau
    (0 kg N ha−1) when ISMN was >384 kg ha−1. In this study, we developed a simple
    linear model to determine the best N application rates under different ISMNs.
    This method is important to help farmers achieve multiple goals of high yield,
    resource conservation and reduced environmental impacts simultaneously.

    model 1. Introduction With the increase of agricultural water consumption and
    fertilization, water shortage and nitrate pollution in groundwater have become
    common problems in the desert oasis. The Shiyang River Basin is a typical irrigated
    desert oasis in northwest China (Fang et al., 2007). In this region, approximately
    480–960 mm of irrigation (typically as flood irrigation) are needed to meet crop
    water requirements (Fang and Su, 2019). Usually irrigation water comes from groundwater
    (Jiang et al., 2016). In the past several decades, the groundwater level has declined
    at a rate of 9 cm per year and up to 2 m in some years due to over exploitation
    of groundwater for irrigation (Liu et al., 2018). Additionally, excessive fertilizer
    application has led to a large amount of residual N in the soil after harvest,
    which increases the risk of nitrate contamination in the groundwater (Huang et
    al., 2018). Therefore, determining optimal water and N management is essential
    to improve water and N use efficiencies (WUE, NUE), reduce environmental pollution
    and maintain sustainable agricultural development in arid areas. In order to improve
    grain yield, WUE, and NUE, as well as reduce environmental pollution caused by
    improper irrigation, a number of studies have been conducted to optimize irrigation
    practices in arid areas. Regulated deficit irrigation is an effective method to
    improve WUE without reducing yield (Farré and Faci, 2009). Fu et al. (2017) found
    that alternate partial root-zone drip irrigation, supplying alternate wetting
    and drying cycling to the root-zones, could increase N uptake, WUE and NUE for
    maize. Ran et al. (2017) found that an irrigation level of 65 %–70 % of soil field
    capacity and an N rate of 100−300 kg N ha−1 was proper for hybrid maize in arid
    Northwest China. Yang and Su (2009) also reported that reducing the irrigation
    amount by 10–25 % combined with 225 kg N ha−1 fertilizer can reduce the groundwater
    contamination in the Heihe Oasis. However, previous research has mainly focused
    on the determination of the total amount of irrigation, and few studies have considered
    the effect of irrigation frequencies on water percolation and N leaching. Additionally,
    over-fertilization is another serious problem in this region, N application rates
    for spring maize has reached 500 kg N ha−1 in this district (Liang et al., 2016b),
    which leads to high residual soil N (RSN) after crop harvest. Residual soil N
    can be used as a N resource for the next crop, but high RSN also likely becomes
    the resource for groundwater and atmosphere pollution (Huang et al., 2018). A
    key issue is to reduce N loss by improving the residual N use efficiency. Therefore,
    various N management systems based on different initial soil mineral N (ISMN)
    levels have been developed. Pre-plant soil N test (PPNT) systems are based on
    the difference between the N requirement for a target yield and ISMN (Wehrmann
    and Scharpf, 1979), but it has a fatal shortcoming by considering SMN static.
    An improved system, the pre-side-dress soil nitrate-N test (PSTN), was recommended
    by testing soil mineral N content before each N application during the crop growth
    season (Magdoff et al., 1984). Cui et al. (2008a, 2008b) evaluated the system
    and found it could improve NUE and reduce environmental risk in the North China
    Plain (NCP). However, it is difficult to adopt in China because of highly fragmented
    farmland, and higher labor, equipment, and soil sampling costs. Soil-crop system
    models can simulate the dynamic processes of crop growth and N fates under different
    climate, soil types, and field management practices, providing insight into optimum
    management that compliments field experiments. Different models have been used
    to simulate crop growth, N leaching and optimum water and N management practices.
    Li et al. (2018) used the Hydrus-1D model to simulate N fates in paddy fields
    in Taihu Lake in China and found that deficit irrigation combined with deep application
    of N fertilizer could effectively reduce N losses. Zhang et al. (2015) used the
    DNDC model to optimize the N application rate for summer maize in the NCP. Their
    results showed that when the N application rate was 180 kg N ha−1, the yield reached
    the maximum and the nitrate leaching was <18.4 kg N ha−1. Hu et al. (2010) evaluated
    more than 1700 scenarios of various irrigation and fertilizer practices using
    the WNMM model to obtain the best management practices (BMPs). Results showed
    that 600 mm of water in eight applications with a single N application of 75 kg
    N ha-1 was the BMP for the specific desert oasis conditions. Jiang et al. (2019)
    simulated maize yield under different scenarios of fertilizer N rates using the
    DNDC and DSSAT models. The results showed that a N application rate of 180−210
    kg N ha-1 with two splits was suitable in northeast China. However, these studies
    ignored the effect of different ISMN levels on crop yield, N leaching, and fertilizer
    N recommendations. The objectives of this study were to: (1) evaluate crop yield,
    N leaching, WUE and NUE under different irrigation schedules in the oasis spring
    maize system in northwest China; (2) optimize the water and N management under
    different ISMNs and weather conditions based on the WHCNS model, aiming to provide
    management guidance for farmers in the arid regions in northwest China. 2. Materials
    and methods 2.1. Research site description A two-year field experiment was conducted
    at the Agricultural and Ecological Water Saving Experimental Station of China
    Agricultural University (102°50′E, 37°52′N) in the Shiyang River Basin, Gansu
    Province, from 2014 to 2015. The study area has a continental temperate arid climate,
    at an altitude of 1580 m, with average annual temperature of 7.8 °C, and average
    annual precipitation of 164 mm. This area has an annual evaporation rate >2000
    mm. The groundwater depth ranges from 40 to 50 m. The soil parent material comes
    from the depression of the Shiyang River alluvial fan, and soil properties show
    a high degree of spatial heterogeneity. The physical and chemical properties of

    7 60 06-18, 07-25 120,80 305 Note: The underlined irrigation dates in 2014 represented
    that the irrigation amount was reduced by 20 mm compared with other irrigation
    amount each time for the same treatment. The values in brackets represent the
    corresponding irrigation amount after irrigation reduction. The amounts and frequencies
    of irrigation were set based on the local farmers’ practice and previous study
    results (Hu et al., 2011). Irrigation was usually carried out at the critical
    crop growth stages. For the I480-4 and I420-4 treatments, irrigation was applied
    four times at jointing, V12 (12th leaf), silking and filling stages. For I420-5,
    I420-6 and I420-7, additional irrigations were applied at flowering, jointing
    to tasseling, and silking to filling stage, respectively. The irrigation water
    came from groundwater, using flooding irrigation. Considering the precipitation
    during the crop growth period (206 mm) in 2014 was higher than previous years
    (average 131 mm), the amount of irrigation for five treatments in 2014 was reduced
    by 40 mm in the later growth stages. After maize harvest, straw was crushed directly
    and returned into the soil for all the treatments every year. Fertilizer N was
    applied as urea at the V12 and silking stages. The fertilizer date was adjusted
    appropriately according to the irrigation date (Table 2). Before the experiment,
    the basic physical and chemical properties in each layer of the soil profile were
    measured, including soil texture, bulk density, pH and organic matter (Table 1).
    The soil water content was measured once each week at 0.20 m intervals to a depth
    of 1.80 m in the soil profile using a TDR (TRIME-IPH, IMKO, Germany) probe. Soil
    samples down to 1.80 m were collected at 0.20 m intervals at key crop development
    stages (seedling, jointing, V12, tasseling, filling and maturity) and harvest
    to measure the soil nitrate concentrations using a continuous flow analyzer (Auto
    Analyzer 3, Bran + Luebbe, Germany). The ISMN before sowing was calculated by
    the following equation: (1) where BD is the bulk density of the ith soil layer
    (g cm−3), Ci is the nitrate N concentration in the ith soil layer soil (mg kg-1).Ammonium
    was not considered because of very low concentration. Hi is the thickness of the
    ith soil layer (cm). The measured ISMN for different treatments in 2014 and 2015
    are shown in Table 2. Plant samples were taken to measure leaf area index (LAI)
    and aboveground biomass at key development stages and yield was measured at harvest.
    Meteorological data were obtained from a weather station located at the experimental
    site, including daily rainfall, maximum, minimum and average temperature, relative
    humidity and average daily wind speed. Detailed field management, measurement
    procedures and methods are available in the literature Shi et al. (2018). 2.3.
    WHCNS model The WHCNS model includes five main modules: soil water, soil temperature,
    soil carbon, soil N, and crop growth. The model is driven by daily meteorological
    data and crop biology parameters, and computes daily processes including soil
    evaporation, crop transpiration, soil water movement, runoff, soil temperature,
    soil net mineralization, nitrification, ammonia volatilization, denitrification,
    and crop growth. The potential evapotranspiration is calculated using the Penman-Monteith
    method (Allen et al., 1998). Water infiltration and redistribution in the soil
    profile is described by the Green-Ampt method (Hachum and Alfaro, 1980) and Richards
    equation (Pachepskya et al., 2003), respectively. The soil heat transfer simulation
    was taken from the HYDRUS-1D model, using the convection-dispersion equation Šimůnek
    et al. (2008). Soil C and N cycling concepts were taken from the DAISY model (Hansen
    et al., 2012). The crop model was taken from the PS123 model which simulates crop
    growth processes, including crop development stage, LAI, photosynthate accumulation
    and allocation, maintenance respiration and growth respiration (Driessen and Konjin,
    1992). The water stress factor is calculated by the actual transpiration divided
    by the potential transpiration. The N stress factor is computed based on the simulation
    of the crop N demand, crop N uptake, and actual soil N supply. More detailed information
    about the model is available in Liang et al. (2016a). The model has been successfully
    applied to analyze the effects of various field management practices (irrigation,
    fertilization, mulching, crop rotation, straw return, etc.) on water consumption
    and N fates, organic matter turnover and crop growth in farmland ecosystem in
    China (Li et al., 2015; Liang et al., 2016b, 2018, 2019; He et al., 2018; Shi
    et al., 2020). 2.4. Model evaluation statistics Three statistical indices including
    root mean square error (RMSE), normalized RMSE (nRMSE) and index of agreement
    (d) were used to evaluate model performance (Willmott, 1981; Liang et al., 2016a).
    The RMSE represents the mean difference between observed and simulated values,
    while nRMSE indicates the relative size of the mean difference as an unbounded
    percentage. The index of agreement (0 ≤ d ≤ 1) is intended to be a descriptive
    measure, and is both a relative and bounded measure. The closer the value of d
    is to 1, the better the model performance (Yang et al., 2014). 2.5. Integrated
    index method The integrated index was used to quantitatively analyze the model
    outputs, including yield, water drainage, N leaching, and gaseous N loss, to evaluate
    the performance of each water and N fertilizer management strategy. In this study,
    three factors including the agronomy factor (AF), environment factor (EF) and
    economy factor (the value to cost ratio, VCR) were computed to evaluate each management
    strategy, and their weights were 0.7, -0.2, and 0.5, respectively (Sun et al.,
    2019). AF was calculated using three variables including yield, WUE, and NUE.
    Each variable was normalized to 0–1 and multiplied using weights of +0.6, +0.2,
    and +0.2 respectively (Hu et al., 2010). EF was calculated using nitrate leaching
    and gaseous N loss (ammonia volatilization and denitrification), and their weights
    were set as +0.5 and +0.5. The AF, EF and VCR were calculated using the following
    equations (Li et al., 2015): (2) (3) (4) where Y is the grain yield (kg ha−1),
    Nlea is nitrate leaching amount (kg N ha−1), Ngas is gaseous N loss amount (kg
    N ha−1), and YP is the grain price (¥ kg−1). W is the irrigation amount (mm) and
    WP is the water price (¥ m-3). F is the N fertilizer rate (kg), and FP is the
    fertilizer price (¥ kg−1). The prices of water, fertilizer, and maize were assumed
    to be 0.35 ¥ m-3, 5 ¥ kg −1 and 2 ¥ kg−1, respectively (Sun et al., 2019). Finally,
    the integrated index (II) was calculated by the values of the three factors and
    their corresponding weights. The higher the integrated index, the better the management
    practice. (5) 2.6. Simulation scenarios In order to explore the relationship of
    yield and nitrate leaching with different water and fertilizer management practices,
    9 ISMN scenarios were set up in the model in 2015. The ISMN scenarios were 625
    (S1), 468 (S2), 390 (S3), 343 (S4), 312 (S5), 234 (S6), 156 (S7), 78 (S8), and
    0 kg N ha−1 (S9). Each ISMN scenario had 20 irrigation amounts and 13 N fertilizer
    levels, giving a total of 2340 water and fertilizer scenarios. The water and N
    management practice in each scenario was consistent with the best treatment of
    five treatments selected in 2015. The specific water and N input scenarios were
    as follows: (1) The total amount of irrigation ranged from 50 to 1000 mm, at 50
    mm intervals. (2) The rate of N fertilizer ranged from 0 to 480 kg N ha−1, at
    40 kg N ha−1 intervals. To consider weather variability over different seasons,
    the WHCNS model was run from 2001 to 2015 to obtain the simulated crop yield,
    water drainage, nitrate leaching, gaseous N loss, WUE and NUE for each scenario.
    A total of 35,100 water and fertilizer scenarios were simulated. 3. Results 3.1.
    Model calibration and evaluation The measured data (soil water content, nitrate
    N concentration, dry matter weight, and crop yield) from the I480-4N280 treatment
    in 2015 was used to calibrate the model. All other treatments for two years were
    used to evaluate the model. Model input parameters were adjusted by trial-and-error
    until the simulated values agreed well with the measured data (Shi et al., 2018).
    The RMSE of soil water content, nitrate N concentration and LAI of I480-4N280
    in 2015 were 0.04 cm3 cm−3, 6.43 mg kg-1 and 0.60 m2 m-2, respectively, while
    the nRMSE values were 14.61 %, 45.56 % and 1.84 %, respectively. The agreement
    index (d) for each model output was 0.91, 0.81 and 0.99, respectively (Table S1),
    indicating that the model calibration results were good. After the calibration,
    all parameters were fixed, and the model was evaluated using the measured data
    of the other four treatments in 2015 and all five treatments in 2014. Fig. S1
    compares the simulated and measured data of soil water content, nitrate concentration,
    LAI and yield for the evaluation treatments. The correlation coefficients (r)
    were 0.70, 0.52, 0.98 and 0.82, respectively, and P values were <0.01. Except
    for nRMSE values of soil nitrate concentration, the statistical indices for each
    treatment were within a reasonable range (Table S1). Considering the complexity
    of soil N transport and transformation and comparing to previous studies (Yang
    et al., 2014; Liang et al., 2016b), the simulation results of soil nitrate concentration
    were acceptable (Fig. S2). Thus, the model can be used to simulate the crop growth,
    water movement and N transport under different water and N fertilizer management
    in the region. 3.2. Crop yield, water consumption and N fates under different
    irrigation schedules According to the measured yields (Table 3), I420-6N200 in
    2014 and I420-5N200 in 2015 gave the highest yield at 16,230 and 17,077 kg ha−1,
    respectively. The lowest performing treatment over both years was the I420-4N200,
    which gave yields of about 15,300 kg ha−1, which was lower than that of I480-4N280.
    This indicates that reducing the irrigation and fertilization amounts led to decreased
    yield using the same irrigation strategies. Increasing the irrigation frequency
    can offset the negative effect of the reduction of water and fertilizer amounts.

    Water drainage decreased with the increase of irrigation times. In 2014, the water
    drainage in the I480-4N280 treatment was significantly higher than that of 2015,
    mainly due to the higher rainfall in 2014. The order of water drainage amount
    for both years was I480-4N280>I420-4N200>I420-5N200>I420-6N200>I420-7N200, showed
    increasing irrigation frequency can decrease the water drainage. The WUE was improved
    with an increase of irrigation frequency, with an order of I420-5N200>I420-7N200>I420-6N200>I480-4N280>I420-4N200.

    N. * N balance, Nbal = Nfer + Nmin - Nvol -Nden -Nlea - Nup. # N use efficiency,
    NUE = Measured yield / (Nvol +Nden +Nlea + Nup). N output in farmland mainly includes
    crop utilization, N leaching and gaseous N loss. Crop utilization accounted for
    83 % of the N output (Table 4). With the increase of irrigation times, the N uptake
    by crops increased. N leaching was the main source of N loss. The N leaching in
    each treatment was similar to the trend of water percolation (Fig. S3). Increasing
    the irrigation times can significantly reduce N leaching and improve NUE. The
    gaseous N loss mainly included ammonia volatilization and denitrification, which
    only accounted for 8.6 % of the N output. The five treatments were evaluated based
    on the integrated indices. Table 4 shows that the order of the average index value
    of each treatment for two years was I420-5N200>I420-7N200>I420-6N200>I420-4N200>I480-4N280.
    This indicated that I420-5N200 was the best management practice among the five
    treatments. 3.3. Optimization of irrigation and N management under different ISMNs
    The I420-5N200 treatment had the highest integrated index and was selected to
    further optimize water and N management practices. The WHCNS model was used to
    simulate the crop yield, water and N balances for different water and N management
    under various ISMN scenarios in 2015. We only showed the two extreme ISMN scenarios
    (S1 and S9) because of space limitations. 3.3.1. High ISMN scenario (S1) In the
    high ISMN scenario (S1, 625 kg N ha−1) for the 2015 season, the simulated maize
    yield increased with an increase in water input and reached the maximum of 22,184
    kg ha-1 (Fig. 1a). This indicated that there was potential for further improvement
    in crop yield. Simulated yield slightly decreased with an increasing amount of
    irrigation water over the critical water input (about 650 mm). The N application
    rate had no effect on yield for the high ISMN level. Little water drainage (32
    mm) occurred when the irrigation amount was <500 mm. However, drainage increased
    as irrigation water increased above 500 mm (Fig. 1c). The amount of nitrate leaching
    was positively related to the amount of water drainage and N fertilizer rate (Fig.
    1e), and the N leaching increased quickly with increasing N application rates
    when the irrigation amount was >500 mm (Fig. 1e). WUE increased linearly when
    the irrigation amount was <450 mm (Fig. 1b), however, when the irrigation amount
    exceeded 450 mm, no obvious change was observed. The NUE showed a rapidly increasing
    trend with increasing irrigation amounts and reached the maximum when the irrigation
    amount was approximately 450 mm, and then decreased as the irrigation amount increased
    (Fig. 1d). The response of WUE to N inputs was not significant, but NUE decreased
    slightly as the increase of N application rate. Download : Download high-res image

    Low ISMN scenario (S9) The simulated yield, water drainage, N leaching, WUE and
    NUE under the S9 scenario (ISMN = 0 kg N ha−1) for the 2015 season are shown in
    Fig. 2. Compared with S1, N application rate had significant effects on these
    indices except for water drainage. Most of N uptake by the crop came from N fertilizer,
    so the yield significantly increased as N rate increased. As the N fertilizer
    increased, more water was needed to obtain the maximum yield (Fig. 2a). Water
    drainage was the same as the S1 scenario (Fig. 2c). N leaching was similar to
    the S1 scenario, but was significantly lower than S1 (Fig. 2e). Compared with
    S1, the effect of different N fertilizer rates on WUE and NUE in S9 scenario was
    significant (Fig. 2b and 2d). Download : Download high-res image (886KB) Download

    of water and N managements under different scenarios The aforementioned results
    showed that with the increasing input of water and N fertilizer, the yield and
    N loss both increased. It was difficult to determine the BMPs. We applied the
    integrated index to evaluate the appropriateness of each water and N management
    under different scenarios. Table 5 shows the results of two ISMN scenarios. The
    higher the integrated index, the better the water and N management practice. Table

    for both scenarios, I50N480 (50 mm irrigation and 480 kg N ha−1 fertilization)
    had the lowest integrated indices, and the yield was about 1745 kg ha−1. Under
    the high ISMN scenario (S1), I450N0 was the BMP with simulated yield of 19,992
    kg ha−1, high WUE and NUE, and low N loss. In the low ISMN scenario (S9), I500N360
    was the BMP and gave a simulated yield of 19,870 kg ha−1. The optimal irrigation
    amount was similar for two ISMN scenarios, but the optimal N rate was different.
    3.4. Relationships of ISMN and optimal irrigation and fertilization amount under
    different weather conditions Based on the simulation results in 2015, we obtained
    the optimal irrigation amounts and N rates that maximized the integrated indices
    for 9 ISMN scenarios. To consider the influence of different weather years and
    precipitation levels on the optimal irrigation amount and N fertilizer rate, the
    WHCNS model was run from 2001 to 2015, and the results are showed in Fig. 3, Fig.
    4. The optimal irrigation amount under different ISMNs in the same year was almost
    the same (Fig. 3a). However, there was a slight difference in optimal irrigation
    amount in different years (Fig. 3b). The average optimal irrigation amounts for
    every year ranged from 400 to 583 mm. This was due to the difference in rainfall
    between years, which ranged from 64 to 220 mm for 2001–2015 (Fig. 3a). The greater
    the rainfall during the growing period, the lower the optimal irrigation amount.

    yield for different ISMNs in same year.). There was a significant negative correlation
    between the optimal N fertilizer rate and ISMN when ISMN ranged from 0 to 400
    kg N ha−1 (Fig. 4b). Under the same ISMN, the different climatic conditions had
    great influence on yield, so corresponding optimal N fertilizer rate was also
    different. In 2013, the optimal average yield was the lowest 14,246 kg N ha-1)
    (Fig. 4a), resulting in low N uptake by the crop, and giving the lowest optimal
    N fertilizer rate (Fig. 4b). Except for the relatively lower optimal N fertilizer
    rate years (2005, 2009, 2012 and 2013), we obtained a simple linear model to determine
    the N fertilizer rate by fitting the ISMNs with the optimal N rates. The resulting
    equation was optimal N rate = 396 – 1.032 × ISMN (Fig. 4b). When the ISMN was
    >384 kg N ha-1, the residual N in the soil could meet the crop growth demand,
    and less supplemental N was needed. When the ISMN was <384 kg N ha-1, the ISMN
    was negatively correlated with the optimal N fertilizer rate. 4. Discussion 4.1.
    Effects of irrigation regime on crop yield and N leaching Rational irrigation
    strategies are essential for agricultural production, especially for the areas
    where water shortage is serious. Many studies have demonstrated that deficit irrigation
    can improve WUE while maintaining high yields (Farré and Faci, 2009; Fu et al.,
    2017). In this study, I420-4N200 with reduced water and N inputs had the lowest
    yield for two years. However, the other three conservation treatments with five
    to seven irrigation events gave high yields (Table 3), while water drainage and
    N leaching was decreased. This demonstrated that increasing the irrigation applications
    could maintain high yield and reduce water and N loss. Hu et al. (2011) recommended
    five irrigation events for spring corn in Shiyang River Basin, which was consistent
    with our study. Liang et al. (2016b) found that yield increased with increasing
    amounts of irrigation, and then reached a plateau when the irrigation amount was
    >500 mm in a desert oasis. In our results, the yield showed a decreased trend
    when irrigation amount exceeded 650 mm (Fig. 1a). This may be caused by different
    weather and soil conditions. The study area was located in northwest China, where
    intensive irrigation or rainfall can easily cause a large amount of N leaching
    due to high sand content. High ISMN conditions further increased the risk of N
    leaching, which in turn affected crop yield. Increasing irrigation events could
    mitigate N loss by leaching and improve WUE and NUE. 4.2. Effects of fertilization
    on crop yield and N leaching under different ISMNs Many studies have reported
    that over-fertilization did not achieve higher yields, but caused serious resource
    waste and environmental risk (Zhang et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2019), so it is necessary
    to optimize the fertilizer rate based on ISMNs. Dai et al. (2015) found that grain
    yields and N application rates resulted in different soil residual N. Huang et
    al. (2018) reported that when the N application rate was >190 kg N ha−1, nitrate
    remaining in the soil increased greatly, and increased the risk of N leaching.
    Zhang et al. (2015) showed that a fertilizer rate of 150−240 kg N ha−1 could maintain
    a high yield for maize, and keep the nitrate leaching at a low level. He also
    found that an N application rate of 179 kg ha-1 for maize was beneficial for both
    yield and the environment (Zhang et al., 2018). In our study, crop yield and N
    leaching was related to both ISMN and N application rate. The N200 treatment had
    no influence on crop yield compared with N280 treatment, but the N leaching was
    reduced. N leaching increased as the N fertilizer rate increased under same ISMN
    level. Under the high ISMN levels, less N was needed to maintain yield, and over-fertilization
    increased the negative environmental impact. As the ISMN decreased, the soil could
    not supply enough N to satisfy the crop needs, so increasing N rates would have
    an obvious yield-increasing effect. Our results were consistent with previous
    studies. 4.3. The optimization of N application rate based on ISMN Because N recommendation
    methods based on local soil N tests have some weakness, many other methods have
    been proposed to determine the reasonable N rates for different purposes. Zhang
    et al. (2018) found that the optimal N application rate was the highest when the
    targeting N uptake, followed by crop yield and economic benefit. N rates were
    the smallest when targeting environmental costs. Zhu (2006) proposed regional
    average suitable N application rates based on a large number of field experiments,
    but it ignored the spatial variability of soil nutrient in a large region. Ju
    and Christie (2011) found that the theoretical N application rate was equal to
    the N uptake by the crop aboveground, which was obtained under the conditions
    that all the straw was returned to the field. In this study, we gave the N recommendation
    based on the ISMNs using a modeling approach, with comprehensive consideration
    of AF, EF and VCR. Under different ISMN scenarios, the optimal N fertilizer rate
    varied substantially. When the ISMN was <384 kg N ha−1, the optimal N application
    rate decreased linearly with the increasing ISMN. When the ISMN was >384 kg N
    ha−1, the optimum N application rate was 0. Cui et al. (2008a) also found 73 %–87
    % of N uptake by the crop came from soil under high soil N content, which is consistent
    with our study. Due to the soil spatial heterogeneity, climate and other management
    factors in different regions, the weight coefficient of AF, EF and VCR should
    be adjusted according to the actual conditions. The linear model for N rate and
    ISMN also needs to be validated in different places. 5. Conclusion The WHCNS model
    was calibrated and evaluated based on field measured data for spring maize in
    the oasis farmland of Shiyang River Basin, China. The results indicated that the
    model could be used to quantitatively analyze the N fates, WUE and NUE in the
    region. Increasing the irrigation frequency can offset the negative effect of
    the reduction of water and fertilizer amounts, meanwhile maintaining yield and
    reduce N leaching. Five irrigation applications was found to be the best treatment
    with low N leaching and high WUE and NUE. The optimum irrigation amount was determined
    by the precipitation amount, and had no relationship with ISMN. The relationship
    between the optimal N application rate and ISMN could be described by a linear
    plus platform model (optimal N rate = 396 – 1.032 × ISMN). When the ISMN >384
    kg ha−1, no or less N fertilizer was needed to maintain yields and reduce the
    risk of environmental pollution. Results of this study provide guidance to farmers
    in this region on how to manage irrigation and N application rates based on ISMN
    levels. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors have declared that no competing

    difference in nitrate leaching among irrigation treatments, which was mainly because
    the N fertilization amount of each treatment was 60 kg ha–1 and no additional
    fertilizer was applied. Shi et al. (2020) also reported that the N leaching for
    maize was relative stable when the fertilizer amount was within a certain range.
    Due to rainfall conditions, the interannual difference in nitrate leaching was
    significant. Show abstract Bayesian calibration and uncertainty analysis of an
    agroecosystem model under different N management practices 2022, European Journal
    of Agronomy Citation Excerpt : These models play a key role in understanding and
    analyzing agroecosystem processes. Soil water heat carbon nitrogen simulator (WHCNS)
    is a process-based agroecosystem model, which has shown good performance in simulating
    soil water movement, water balances, N fates, and crop growth for summer wheat-summer
    maize, spring maize, rice, and vegetable cropping systems under different field
    management practices (irrigation, fertilization, manure, mulching, crop rotation,
    tillage, etc.) in China (Li et al., 2015a; Liang et al., 2016, 2018, 2019; Shi
    et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020). At present, this model has been used in optimizing
    water and N management practices in various cropland ecosystems (Liang et al.,
    2016, 2021; Shi et al., 2020), predicting crop yield, soil water balance, N leaching
    at the regional scale (Chen et al., 2020, 2021), modeling N leaching and crop
    yield under changing climate (He et al., 2018), and assessing water and N footprint

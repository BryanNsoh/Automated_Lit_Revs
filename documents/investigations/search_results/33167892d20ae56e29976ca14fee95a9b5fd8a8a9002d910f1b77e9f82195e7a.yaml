    in many of the world''s dry places continue to inspire the search for economically
    attractive measures to conserve water. This study analyzes water conservation
    practices in irrigated agriculture in a sub-basin in North America''s Rio Grande.
    A method is developed to estimate water savings in irrigated agriculture that
    result from public subsidies to farmers who convert from surface to drip irrigation.
    The method accounts for economic incentives affecting farmers'' choices on irrigation
    technology, crop mix, water application, and water depletion. Findings show that
    farmers will invest in technologies that reduce water applications when faced
    with lower financial costs for converting to drip irrigation. Subsidies for drip
    irrigation increase farm income, raise the value of food production, and reduce
    the amount of water applied to crops. However, an unexpected result is that water
    conservation subsidies that promote conversion to drip irrigation can increase
    the demand for water depleted by crops. Our findings show that where water rights
    exist, water rights administrators will need to guard against increased depletion
    of the water source in the face of growing subsidies for drip irrigation. Our
    approach for analyzing water conservation programmes can be applied where water
    is scarce, irrigation is significant, food security is important, and water conservation
    policies are under debate. Background A 2011 report by the Committee on Foreign
    Relations of the US Senate stated: Globally, the agriculture sector is the single
    largest consumer of freshwater, accounting for about 70 percent of the total volume
    of freshwater withdrawals from lakes, rivers, and aquifers. As a primary driver
    of water scarcity and source of tension within and among countries, agriculture
    policies produce water insecurity when they promote water-intensive crops and
    require unsustainable irrigation. Agricultural water conservation subsidies provide
    important incentives to reduce water applications in agriculture. These subsidies
    also reward irrigators who adopt water-conserving measures and reduce water applications
    at the farm or field level (English et al., 2002; Zhang, 2003; Gurluk and Ward,
    2009; Ward, 2007). Worldwide, over 275 million hectares of land are currently
    irrigated (Malano and van Hofwegen, 1999). Improvements in the allocation of water
    at the basin scale can contribute to peaceful resolution of water conflicts, reduce
    international tensions, and increase the efficient use of water for all uses.
    Several basin-scale models have been developed since the mid-1990s for many of
    the world''s smaller river basins that take advantage of linkages between economics,
    agronomy, hydrology, and water policy. However, for major rivers like the Mekong,
    Ganges-Brahmaputra, Congo, Nile, and Amazon, no decent, reliable and usable models
    exist. For major rivers, given the associated complexities and uncertainties,
    it simply has not been possible to develop models that could integrate economics,
    agronomy, hydrology, and water policies. Moreover, while the integrated river
    basin framework has the potential to identify effective water-conserving policy
    measures, little detailed work has been done to date on detailed on-farm analysis
    of the economics of water conservation. There have been a large number of contributions
    to the literature since 2000 describing opportunities for and barriers to water
    conservation in irrigated agriculture. One study found that water conservation
    in irrigation and the development of water resources for agriculture could theoretically
    increase food production in China from 650 million to 672 million tons of grain
    (Heilig et al., 2000). Another found that agricultural water conservation statutes
    in some states in the American West encourage private irrigators to improve on-farm
    irrigation efficiency under a wide variety of conditions (Huffaker and Whittlesey,
    2000). In another study, several pathways for enhancing water use efficiency in
    irrigated agriculture were examined. These included methods to increase the output
    per unit of water, reduce losses of water to unusable sinks, reduce water degradation,
    and reallocate water to higher-valued uses (Howell, 2001). An optimistic study
    from Pakistan found that as water has become scarcer, savings in crop irrigation
    could enhance water development in areas currently not being irrigated (Sarwar
    and Bastiaanssen, 2001). Another work found that growing water scarcity and increased
    competition for all water uses has raised the importance of finding methods to
    promote increased water use efficiency by increasing the fraction of water beneficially
    used for a given amount of water applied (Cai et al., 2003). A US study from the
    state of Washington found that economic incentives play an important role in promoting
    water conservation. The authors showed that increasing the cost of applied water
    may be a more effective water conservation policy than subsidizing the cost of
    improved on-farm irrigation efficiency (Huffaker and Whittlesey, 2003). More recently,
    work from northern China identified similar challenges in promoting irrigation
    water conservation. It examined the effectiveness of water pricing policies in
    addressing the need to conserve water in irrigated agriculture. Results showed
    that increased costs of irrigation in the 1990s failed to conserve water. Over-exploitation
    of groundwater resources became even more pronounced with the shift to higher-value
    crops even if those higher-valued crops used more water. These results suggest
    that unless the price of water is high, pricing alone will not promote water conservation
    under current irrigation management institutions, and that institutional reforms
    are needed to complement water pricing (Yang et al., 2003). At higher levels,
    price could be an important factor to promote water conservation in China. Pricing
    would also need strong political commitment and institutional reform in China
    to promote conservation. A 2005 study of the High Plains of the central USA examined
    effects of irrigation efficiency on irrigation water use. The authors found that
    intermediate- and high-efficiency systems both result in less water use than a
    conventional surface system (Peterson and Ding, 2005). A more recent study from
    the water-scarce Maipo basin of Chile examined the potential of substituting water
    for other inputs through development of a crop water production function at the
    field and farm scales. Results of that study showed that under a farmer objective
    of profit maximization, water does substitute for other crop inputs for high-value
    crops, but may complement water use for low-valued crops (Cai et al., 2008). Water
    conservation in agriculture is often believed to be a good method for reduced
    irrigation water use. However, a study by Clemmens et al. ( 2008) found that water
    believed to be wasted is often reused several times downstream, so there are upper
    bounds to the actual water savings that can be achieved from programmes that increase
    irrigation efficiency. A 2008 study from the Rio Grande basin found that water
    conservation subsidies are unlikely to reduce water use under conditions that
    occur in many river basins (Ward and Pulido-Velazquez, 2008). A 2009 study found
    that the world''s food security could be challenged by increasing food demand
    and threatened by declining water availability. That study explored ways to produce
    more rice with less water, essential for food security in many parts of the world
    (Farooq et al., 2009). More recently, two 2010 studies discovered some areas where
    real increases in water productivity are possible (Gohar and Ward, 2010), but
    found that achieving these gains will be challenging and will require strategies
    that consider complex biophysical and economic factors (Molden et al., 2010).
    The works summarized above are some of the recent contributions to the literature
    on the economics of water conservation in irrigated agriculture. Despite the importance
    of these contributions, we have found little published work that used the tenets
    of microeconomic theory to explain choices made on crop water use, crop mix, land
    in production, and irrigation technology, while also making a distinction between
    water applied versus water depleted by crops. Because of these gaps in the crop
    water conservation literature, this paper has the following objectives: • Assemble
    historical data on water applications, water depletions, 1 crop yields, land in
    production, crop mix, crop costs, crop yields, and crop prices that characterize
    the economics of irrigated agriculture in the basin. • Integrate the microeconomic
    theory of crop water demand and observed crop water use data into a framework
    suitable for empirical analysis that explains profitability, crop production,
    crop land use, water applications, and water depletions in the basin. • Develop
    and apply an empirical framework that permits water managers, water policymakers,
    water administrators, and farmers to understand what influences profitability,
    crop production, and the economic value of water for the typical suite of crops
    and irrigation technologies seen in the basin. • Use the framework to forecast
    water applications, water depletions, land use, crop production, farm income,
    the economic value of water, and impacts of a range of irrigation water conservation
    subsidies for selected water supply scenarios. Our methods of analysis are applied
    to irrigation in the Upper Rio Grande basin, shown in Figure 1. That basin runs
    from the headwaters in southern Colorado''s Rocky Mountains to a place on the
    river about 100 miles east of El Paso, Texas. The sub-basin analyzed in this study
    is located in southern New Mexico, from the outflow of Elephant Butte Reservoir
    to a point about 120 miles south of that point. It passes through southern New
    Mexico, ending at the New Mexico–Texas border. Heavy water use by irrigated agriculture
    in the Elephant Butte Irrigation District (EBID), combined with growing values
    of water for cities and the environment, illustrates the considerable importance
    of measures that could economically promote water conservation in irrigated agriculture.

    analysis for the model described in this paper is used to inform ongoing water
    policy debates dealing with the effectiveness of water conservation subsidies
    for irrigated agriculture. Our analysis conducts a “with versus without” comparison
    for a water conservation subsidy that would reduce producers'' capital costs of
    converting from surface irrigation to a drip irrigation system. A financial analysis
    of the costs and returns of producing irrigated crops is conducted, in which the
    financial feasibility of surface versus drip irrigation is compared side by side.
    Our economic analysis of irrigation rests on a foundation of farm-level economics.
    The farm economics is analyzed through the use of enterprise budgets (see e.g.
    Hawkes and Libbin, 2005; Brinegar and Ward, 2009). Enterprise budgets contain
    detailed financial information regarding surface-irrigated crop production, including
    crop acreage, equipment, crop production processes, and overall crop cost and
    return summaries. Additional details of the analysis are in the mathematical appendix.
    The published farm budgets contain detailed financial data for agricultural production,
    typically based on surface irrigation, by far the most common irrigation technology
    used in the region. To inform the current analysis, the published base budgets
    applicable to EBID were adjusted to reflect the modest acreage currently produced
    under drip irrigation by EBID producers. The adjustments were based on a series
    of producer panel interviews, in which selected producers in the district who
    practised drip irrigation were asked a series of detailed questions about impacts
    associated with the conversion from surface to drip irrigation. Drip irrigation
    budgets for EBID were assembled that included data on yields, water use, labour
    requirements, accomplishment rates, equipment requirement, and system installation
    costs, all on a per-acre basis. At the producer panel meetings, one important
    difference found between surface and drip irrigation at the farm level was the
    cost and the risk involved in investing in a drip irrigation system. Drip irrigation
    is expensive to install and requires specialized management practices. The drip
    irrigation budgets we developed reflect this difference by incorporating the additional
    equipment required, differences in purchased inputs, differences in labour requirements,
    and of course savings in applied water. The economically driven decision to invest
    in drip irrigation depends on current as well as expected future input and output
    prices and costs. Ultimately, there must be an economic advantage to drip irrigation
    to make it worthwhile to the producer. The main reason farmers convert to drip
    irrigation is not to conserve water but to obtain higher economic return from
    the farm through increased yields and reduced operational costs. This is an especially
    important issue where water is priced at or near zero. The enterprise budget approach
    permits a systematic incorporation of the economics of private on-farm decision
    making into the regional model. Drip irrigation applies small amounts of water
    to the crop''s root zone at a slow but steady rate. In the EBID area, where it
    is practised, drip tapes distribute the water and are typically buried to a depth
    of 8–10 inches (1 inch = 2.54 centimeters) below the surface in order to reach
    the crop root zones. The close interaction between the root zone and water source
    allows the irrigator to divert less water from the stream and apply less water
    to a given field than is normally applied under surface irrigation. With specialized
    design, proper installation, and careful management, agricultural producers may
    receive the benefits of higher yields, more efficient water use, and labour savings.
    The use of a drip irrigation system makes no guarantee of reduced crop evapotranspiration
    (ET). A crop''s water requirement does not change with the use of drip irrigation.
    However, higher yields are possible when the drip irrigator avoids deficit irrigation.
    Drip irrigation supplies water directly to the root zone, increasing the percentage
    of applied water that reaches the plant, typically increasing yields. Installation
    costs for drip irrigation systems are amortized based on the total cost of the
    system, system life, and the interest rate. For this analysis, the cost used is
    US$1012 per hectare (ha) for a system that has an expected life of 10 years with
    an interest rate of 7.5%. Amortizing produces an annual payment amount that accounts
    for the life of the loan, total capital cost, and interest. 2 The resulting annual
    equivalent cost was US$147 per ha for the case of zero capital subsidy for the
    region''s producers. With no water conservation subsidy, total undiscounted conversion
    cost per ha summed over the 10-year system life is US$1474. This sizeable investment
    is the cost that a public water conservation subsidy aims to reduce in order to
    make reduced water applications in irrigated agriculture more economically attractive.
    This amortization formula was used to account for varying reductions in the capital
    cost associated with several potential increases in the public subsidy. Drip irrigation
    systems in EBID typically require field flushing of accumulated salts once per
    growing season, usually performed at the end of the growing season. This is an
    important best management practice (BMP), needed to reduce any salinity levels
    within the soil, which also incurs the additional cost of finding the water for
    the flush. Surface irrigation provides the flush during the normal course of irrigation;
    drip irrigation systems do not experience flushing because irrigation water applications
    are emitted slowly and intermittently to the root zone of the crop through the
    distribution system. An excellent drip irrigation web site is provided by the
    Oregon State University Agricultural Experiment Station (Shok, 2006). Results
    Our findings bring out several essential messages: • Irrigators invest more heavily
    in water-saving technologies when faced with lower financial costs for converting
    from surface irrigation to these technologies. • Drip irrigation subsidies raise
    farm income, raise crop yields, increase the gross value of food production, and
    reduce the amount of water applied to crops. • However, by increasing crop yields
    and raising crop water ET, drip irrigation subsidies put upward pressure on water
    depletions. • In basins where an organized system of water rights exists, authorities
    responsible for administration of water rights need to guard against increased
    depletion of the water source that can result from programmes subsidizing technologies
    that reduce water applications. • Where no system of water rights exists, we would
    expect increased depletions of the water source to occur in the face of increased
    drip irrigation subsidies. • In the Rio Grande basin, a 100% subsidy of the cost
    of converting from surface to drip irrigation raises the economic scarcity of
    water from US$36 to US$101 per 1000 cubic metres depleted when supplies are reduced
    by 20%. (Tabled results are presented in US$ per acre foot of water. An acre foot
    is about 1233 cubic meters.) These messages are shown below in detail for 10 separate
    model runs: 5 drip irrigation subsidies for each of 2 water supply scenarios.
    The capital subsidy of converting from surface to drip irrigation for our producers
    was varied from 0% to 100% in 25% increments. For each run, water applications
    and water depletions were allocated among crops and irrigation technologies in
    the basin to maximize total regional farm net income. Data used for the analysis
    are summarized in Table 1, while the data used to predict crop yields under alternative
    amounts of land in production are shown in Table 2, with supporting elaboration
    and interpretation in the mathematical appendix. Tables 3-8 (discussed below)
    show a wide range of results associated with the income-maximizing on-farm decisions
    that protect the river system from increased water depletions in the face of a
    series of rising drip irrigation subsidies. Table 1. Crop, water, land, and economic

    Value of Water For our analysis, the shadow price for water is interpreted as
    the change in the economic value of the irrigation district''s total net income
    that can be secured by adding one additional acre-foot (approximately 1,233 m
    3) to the depletable water supply if that additional water could be found. It
    is the ability to pay for one more acre-foot of water supply based on its use
    in irrigated agriculture. It can also be interpreted as the marginal cost (reduction
    in income) resulting from tightening the constraint on depletable water. The shadow
    price of land is zero for all drip irrigation subsidy levels and for all drought
    scenarios. In the Rio Grade basin and in many of the world''s irrigated regions,
    water, not land, is the limiting resource. Table 3''s shadow prices show the maximum
    price that the region''s irrigators can pay for an extra unit of depletable water.
    Ten shadow prices are shown, one for each combination of five drip irrigation
    subsidies and two water supply scenarios. The tabled amount of the shadow price
    informs managers, extension professionals, farmers, and water administrators about
    the scarcity value of depletable water for crop irrigation. That shadow price
    is shown to vary considerably according to the water conservation subsidy level
    and water supply scenario. A higher conservation subsidy raises the scarcity value
    of water. A lower water supply scenario also raises the shadow price of water.
    Table 3 shows that, under base (full) water supply conditions, the shadow price
    of water is zero with no drip irrigation subsidy. However, that value gradually
    increases to US$37.57 per 1000 cubic metres as the drip irrigation subsidy grows
    to 100%. This growing economic value of depletable water with a rising drip irrigation
    subsidy occurs because water administration in New Mexico aims to protect water
    rights by guarding against increasing river depletions with alternative policies.
    For any given water supply scenario, the region''s water administration (the State
    Engineer) is required by law to take steps to guard against increased net depletions
    on the river system. Water rights in New Mexico are based on the right to consume
    water, not the right to apply it (De Mouche, Landfair, and Ward, 2011). Despite
    the legal requirement to protect water rights holders from increased water depletions
    with policy changes, farmers know all too well that increased drip irrigation
    subsidies raise the profitability of cultivating crops with drip irrigation that
    would otherwise be surface-irrigated. This substitution of drip for surface irrigation
    in the face of a rising drip subsidy increases crop yields, raises profitability
    of farming, and raises crop water depletion (ET) per unit of land irrigated. All
    these hydrologic and economic pressures raise the importance of protecting against
    the increased water depletions that a growing drip irrigation subsidy would otherwise
    promote. Protecting the stream-aquifer system and the basin''s water rights holders
    against increased depletions can be achieved by on-farm actions that reduce land
    in production, as shown in Table 4. Without water administrators taking active
    steps to reduce irrigated land in production in the face of greater public subsidies
    of drip irrigation, total depletions will rise as growers convert to drip irrigation
    from surface irrigation in the face of greater crop yields and associated higher
    crop water ET. Without vigilant and active water rights administration, irrigation
    farmers interpret their water right as the right to apply no more than the base
    amount of water on their land rather than the right to deplete no more than the
    base amount of water. Where this view occurs, farmers will simply adjust their
    land and crop mix to continue applying their base amount of water in the face
    of growing drip subsidies. Subsidizing the conversion from surface to drip irrigation
    is a widely-recognized way to apply less water than surface irrigation. Farmers
    will attempt to bring more land into production as they shift to greater amounts
    of drip-irrigated land, believing that their right to apply water is no longer
    fully used. For all these reasons, protecting a river system from being over-appropriated
    requires water administrators to take concrete steps to guard against new depletions.
    Protecting water rights holders against these new depletions poses special challenges.
    Estimating ET per unit land by location, crop, and irrigation technology is a
    good start. Consumptive water rights can be defined, administered, and enforced
    based on calculated ET. Calculated ET to support water rights administration,
    posted by the authority in a publicly visible spot, could promote open and transparent
    debate as well as promoting better-informed water administration. Anyone who doubted
    the accuracy of the consumptive water right based on the posted ET would have
    the right to prove the error. Our results are based on a river basin in the American
    Southwest where water rights are actively defined and enforced. However, in many
    parts of the word where irrigation is important, there are no withdrawal rights,
    let alone rights to a set amount of ET. Establishing withdrawal rights may be
    needed before debates can be started on the best way to define or administer ET
    rights. For example, some ongoing projects in China have set the goal of ET rights,
    but have been stalled when getting to the details of satellite data resolution
    in relation to field sizes. Adding to that the poor precision of the overlay of
    successive images and time steps to define ET (daily, weekly, seasonal, annual)
    means that implementing ET rights still faces major hurdles (Perry, 2011). Table
    4 shows that such vigilant administration requires taking a small amount of land
    out of production (by whatever culturally acceptable mechanism), reducing land
    from 59,256 acres (2.47 acres = 1 ha) with no subsidy (full water supply) to 59,049
    acres total under the 100% subsidy. Table 5 shows that keeping the river whole
    requires reducing water applications from 213.794 million cubic metres (mcm) per
    year with no subsidy to 202.647 mcm per year under the 100% subsidy with a full
    water supply. Keeping separate track of water diversions and depletions is more
    than an intellectual or accounting exercise. For example, in May 2011, the issue
    of diversion versus depletion was raised in a US Supreme Court ruling (US Supreme
    Court, 2011). The court ruled on a case in which downstream water users in the
    state of Montana discovered that increased upstream use of sprinkler irrigation
    in the state of Wyoming where surface irrigation had previously occurred had the
    effect of reducing flows returning to the Yellowstone River system. Sprinkler
    irrigators diverted the same amount from the river, but returned less. The court
    ruled against Montana, stating that the wording of the 1950 Yellowstone River
    Compact did not prohibit upstream irrigators in Wyoming from changing irrigation
    technologies, even if it meant returning less water to the river system. So in
    securing the protection of downstream water rights from impairment, the Supreme
    Court was wrong. But it is supreme—so their ruling could alter the way that future
    interstate water sharing arrangements are drafted in the US (Crane-Murdoch, 2011).
    The distinction between diversions and depletions is likely to receive growing
    scrutiny as future water-sharing agreements are drafted, and will become especially
    important where transboundary agreements do not currently exist. Land in Production
    Table 4 shows that not all crops are affected proportionally by a growing drip
    irrigation subsidy. Total land in production under base conditions is 23,990 ha,
    the actual amount irrigated for these crops under the base water supply with no
    drip irrigation subsidy. Increases in drip irrigation in production that would
    occur with rising drip subsidies would reduce the land irrigated by surface irrigation.
    Land grown in each crop irrigated by surface irrigation is reduced with a rising
    drip irrigation subsidy. That table also shows that land in production area without
    a drip irrigation subsidy currently relies heavily on surface irrigation technology.
    If the future drip irrigation subsidy is increased, the amount of land initially
    produced by surface irrigation decreases to allow land to grow crops under drip
    irrigation technology. However, the upper limit on water depletions cannot be
    exceeded, so reductions in surface-irrigated land are more than offset by increased
    land in drip irrigation, for the reasons described above under shadow prices.
    Overall, land in production summed over irrigation technologies falls slightly
    with a rising drip irrigation subsidy because of its higher crop ET per unit land
    compared to surface irrigation. Water Application Versus Water Depletion Table
    5 shows water applications for the suite of crops, irrigation subsidies, and water
    supply scenarios. Table 6 shows similar findings for water depletions. It shows
    the upper bound on total water depletions required for water administration to
    protect existing water rights holders. It also shows that increased depletions
    induced by a rising drip irrigation subsidy are just offset by reduced depletions
    from the reduced land in production under surface irrigation. The offsets are
    not equal for each crop, but do balance out when summed over all crops. Maintaining
    a cap on water depletions requires keeping depletions from increasing beyond the
    base level of 102.973 mcm per year. Water rights in New Mexico are based on the
    right to deplete water and not to merely divert or apply it. So keeping the river
    whole under base water supply conditions is hard, but it is needed to protect
    existing water rights holders. Table 5 shows that, with a gradually rising drip
    irrigation subsidy, water applications are reduced gradually from 175.754 to 165.228
    mcm per year when supplies are 80% of full. This reduction must take place to
    protect water rights dependent on the river system from the economic incentives
    that would otherwise promote growing water depletions. Greater production from
    drip irrigation reduces water applied, but increases water depleted because of
    the higher ET associated with higher yields. That is, public financial incentives
    enacted to promote the adoption of water-conserving technology must be accompanied
    by active water rights administration that assures no growth in ET as water applications
    are reduced. Otherwise, greater adoption by farmers of water-conserving technology
    will increase water depletions, which will reduce supplies to the aquifer, reduce
    flows to downstream users, and impair water supplies available to future generations.
    Tables 5 and 6 show that when considering policies that are designed to improve
    irrigation efficiency, it is important to distinguish impacts on water applications
    from those on water depletions. At the individual farm level, irrigation efficiencies
    are often low when measured by the percentage of water applied that reaches the
    plant root zone. However, at the basin scale those same efficiencies can be quite
    high, since the unconsumed applied water may be available to other users. Sometimes
    water is reallocated in the name of efficiency. A reviewer reminds us that a good
    example occurred when canals bringing water to the city of Chennai, India, were
    termed inefficient and were lined. This so-called efficiency gain ensured that
    the farmers who had been cultivating land along the canals suddenly found that
    water had disappeared. They had to abandon farming, and moved to urban areas searching
    for employment, thus creating slums and social problems. An integrated basin-scale
    policy analysis based on a properly conducted hydrologic balance could have averted
    this unfortunate outcome. Value of Crop Production Table 7 shows changes in the
    gross value of crop production induced by growing water conservation subsidies.
    As expected, rising subsidies for the water-conserving technology increase crop
    yields as well as raising gross revenues from crop production, a fact that is
    due to the greater proportion of total production supplied by drip irrigation.
    The table''s findings have important implications for food security in countries
    where major challenges confront water and food planners who wish to achieve food
    self-sufficiency over the long term. The table shows how farmers can make rational
    choices among irrigation systems that increase food production while guarding
    against increased depletions from water sources. Farm Income The direct economic
    benefits to farmers resulting from a policy of subsidizing the capital cost of
    investing in drip irrigation is measured by their change in net income. This is
    the change in revenues minus the change in all costs of production, including
    the capital cost of converting from surface to drip irrigation. For the region
    as a whole, net income increases as the capital subsidy for drip irrigation increases.
    For instance, Table 8 shows that as the capital subsidy increases from zero to
    100%, income growth for crops produced under drip irrigation is especially high
    for cotton and chile, for both water supply scenarios. The income gain in drip
    irrigated cotton production as the drip conversion subsidy increases is dramatic.
    Cotton production income earned under drip irrigation grows from US$89,000 (with
    no subsidy) to US$1,144,000 per year (with a 100% subsidy) for cotton growers
    who convert to drip irrigation. Proportionally, income gains are nearly as high
    for lettuce and onion farmers as would occur for cotton farmers as the conversion
    takes place from surface to drip irrigation technology in the face of an elevated
    drip subsidy. Overall, total farm income induced by the drip irrigation increases
    by about 14% in the normal water supply scenario and about 10% when water supplies
    fall by 20%. Discussion Our findings show that subsidies that promote greater
    irrigation efficiency are unlikely to reduce water depletions by irrigated agriculture
    unless special administrative steps are taken to define water rights based on
    the right to deplete a river system''s water. It is not enough to define water
    rights based on the right to divert or apply a set amount of water, for specifying
    water rights in those ways ignores the basin''s hydrologic balance. In the face
    of subsidies to convert from surface to drip irrigation, protecting the river,
    protecting existing water rights holders, and protecting sustainable access to
    water use for future generations of water users requires a just and consistent
    enforcement of the right to water depletion. Our findings suggest re-examining
    the presumption, widely held by donors, that increased irrigation efficiency brought
    about by subsidizing drip irrigation will relieve the world''s water crisis (Samani
    and Skaggs, 2008). Results show that without special attention given to informed
    water rights administration, such efficiency subsidies could worsen the crisis.
    Results indicate that water conservation subsidies do not provide farmers with
    economic incentives to reduce water depletions and therefore are unlikely to make
    new water available for alternative uses. Drip irrigation is important for many
    reasons, including greater water productivity, higher crop yields, and increased
    food security. But it cannot be relied on to save water depletions when considered
    from a basin scale. An important measure to guard against increased water depletions
    could be the administration of water rights based on a defined right to crop water
    depletions. The right to an upper bound on ET associated with a water right could
    be posted in a central place available for all irrigation water rights holders
    and all water stakeholders to see. With greater crop ET induced by a subsidy to
    increase irrigation efficiency, farmers would be allowed to take any action to
    respond to the greater profitability of drip irrigation as long as total crop
    water ET did not increase. Tables 4-6 in this paper show how crop water and land
    use patterns can be altered in the face of a drip irrigation subsidy that maximizes
    farm income while protecting existing formal or informal water rights holders.
    Conclusions Climate change and recurrent drought in many of the world''s dry places
    continue to inspire the search for economically attractive measures to conserve
    water in irrigated agriculture. This study has analyzed water conservation practices
    in irrigated agriculture in a sub-basin of North America''s Rio Grande. It developed
    a method to estimate water savings in irrigated agriculture that result from public
    subsidies for farmers who convert from surface to drip irrigation. The method
    accounts for economic incentives affecting farmers'' choices on irrigation technology,
    crop mix, water application, and water depletion. Findings show that irrigators
    can be expected to invest in technologies that reduce water applications when
    faced with lower financial costs for converting to these technologies. Subsidies
    for drip irrigation increase farm income, raise the value of food production,
    and reduce the amount of water applied to crops. However, water conservation subsidies
    that promote conversion to drip irrigation can increase the demand for water depletions
    in the face of no new depletable supplies. Findings show that where water rights
    exist, water rights administrators will need to guard against increased depletion
    of the water source with growing subsidies that reward reduced water applications.
    This paper''s approach for analyzing water conservation programmes can be applied
    to parts of the world where water is scarce, irrigation is significant, food security
    is important, and water conservation policies are under debate. Mathematical Appendix
    Overview Our framework for analyzing water conservation in irrigated agriculture
    implements extends a similar method originally developed by Howitt ( 1995), who
    formulated the term “positive mathematical programming” (PMP). Many authors since
    then have developed various refinements of PMP (e.g. Paris and Howitt, 1998; Preckel
    et al., 2002; Rohm and Dabbert, 2003; Heckelei and Wolff, 2003; Cai and Wang,
    2006; Paris, 2001; Iglesias and Blanco, 2008; Cortignani and Severini, 2009).
    In our implementation of PMP, the first-order conditions for profit maximization
    are used to specify and estimate two parameters of a crop yield function that
    shows declining yields in the face of an expanded scale of land and water use.
    Calibration Programming models of farm production and resource use should match
    conditions in a base year. Policy analyses based on programming models lack credibility
    when they show a deviation between base period model outcomes and actual results
    (Howitt, 1995). The use of PMP allows estimation of marginal behavioural reactions
    to policy changes based on average farm production data observed. Our application
    of PMP uses information on conditions required for profit maximization to identify
    parameters of a quadratic function for which unconstrained optimization reproduces
    observed data. At the regional level, information on output levels, input use,
    and land allocations by farmers are typically more accurate than estimates of
    marginal productivity in production functions. Marginal productivity influences
    farm decisions, but is rarely observed in regional average data of the sort commonly
    published, such as by the US land grant university extension programmes. One important
    source of nonlinearity in the farmer''s production function is heterogeneous land
    quality, resulting in declining yields as the total amount of land increases for
    a given crop planted. While declining land quality at the regional level with
    an expanded scale of production for any given crop simplifies the many sources
    of declining yields, it captures much of the farm behavioural response. Production
    We specify a crop yield function with decreasing yields in the face of greater
    amounts of land in production for any given crop. Decreasing returns to scale
    keep irrigators from complete specialization at the regional level. One farm manager
    may specialize in a single crop using one irrigation technology, but at a regional
    level, complete specialization is rare. In addition, available data commonly show
    the ratio of water to land to be fixed for any given irrigation technology, crop,
    and location. For any given location, crop, and irrigation technology, it is most
    common to see data on actual yields and on the amount of water and other inputs.
    This amounts to seeing only one point on the production function. The crop water
    production function below shows each crop''s yield falling as more land is planted
    to that crop. Declining yields with expanded scale of production illustrate the
    principle of Ricardian rent, in which each crop''s best lands are used first,
    after which yields fall off as less-suitable land enters production. We specify
    the following yield function to account for land of varying quality in which yields
    decline with expanded acreage: in which B 0 is the crop yield for the first unit
    of land brought into production, and B 1 is the marginal impact of additional
    land on average yields. For any given crop, the ratio of water to land used is
    a fixed coefficient, the water use rate per unit land, B w . Total water use for
    a given crop equals total land use multiplied by the crop water requirement per
    unit land. Expressing land as the dependent variable means: In Eq. ( 2 ), total
    land planted to the given crop (Land) is the total amount of water required to
    irrigate the crop (Water) divided by the crop water requirement per unit land,
    B w . Substituting Eq. ( 2 ) into Eq. ( 1 ) expresses yield as a function of total
    water applied at the regional level: Farm Income Based on the yield function above,
    total profitability Π is price times yield minus all variable costs per unit land
    including the cost of water: where P is crop price, P w is the price of water,
    and C is non-water production cost per unit land. Yield multiplied by land planted
    to the crop is the crop production function. Total regional farm profitability
    over all water used for the crop can be expressed as: With the exception of the
    terms B 0 and B 1 , the remaining terms are observable. Typical sources of data
    are farm enterprise budgets and regional land surveys. The formulation in Eq.
    ( 5 ) expresses total regional profitability in terms of crop water depletions.
    Maximizing total regional irrigation farm profitability for any crop requires
    expanding water and associated land use for each crop as long as additional revenues
    exceed additional costs. Where there is a fixed water use requirement per unit
    land for any given crop, actions that maximize regional farm profits can be discovered
    by differentiating the regional farm profitability in Eq. ( 5 ) with respect to
    additional water used: Eq. ( 6 ) presents a classic result from microeconomic
    theory: at the regional level, farm income maximization requires that irrigation
    water use be expanded to the point where the price of water equals the value of
    the marginal product of the additional water used. Eq. ( 6 ) predicts behaviour
    that is commonly seen: a higher water price or greater water scarcity results
    in various kinds of water conservation. For any given crop and irrigation technology,
    the ratio of water used to land in production is fixed, so no added information
    comes from differentiating profitability with respect to additional land in production.
    Estimating Parameters Eq. ( 1 ) expresses the relation between B 0 and B 1 , the
    two unknowns in Eq. ( 6 ). Everything else is known and can be measured from actual
    irrigation behaviour or its outcomes. The known data in Eq. ( 6 ) include Water
    in production, the water coefficient B w , crop price, P, and water price, Pw
    . The first lands brought into production have the highest yields, while lands
    currently excluded that could be brought into production produce lower yields.
    So B 0 (yield on the best lands) should be higher than observed yield for each
    crop and irrigation technology currently in production. The term B 1 is expected
    to be negative, reflecting reduced yields in the face of expanded land in production.
    The mission is to find what values those two yield function parameters must have
    been to produce the income-maximizing behaviour seen. Eq. ( 6 ) can be solved
    for the unobserved coefficient B 1 as: The term B 1 in Eq. ( 7 ) is the reduction
    in average crop yield for each additional unit of land brought into production.
    So the marginal yield reduction on new lands is twice the size of B 1 . Crop yield
    for the first unit of land brought into production, B 0 , can be solved for by
    recalling that with B 1 known from Eq. ( 7 ), Eq. ( 1 ) can be used to find the
    desired coefficient: Using information on both B 0 and B 1 , a wide range of calculated
    yields can be made under a range of regional income optimizations that would occur
    under future policy and hydrologic scenarios. An important advantage of the PMP
    approach is revealed when the two estimated parameters B 0 and B 1 are substituted
    back into the Yield function, Eq. ( 1 ). When that substitution occurs, the net
    income defined by Eq. ( 4 ) is a quadratic function. Using that quadratic, a simple
    unconstrained maximization of the income objective produces behavioural results
    that match observed net revenue, crop yield, and land in production by crop and
    irrigation technology. The model above is based on combining observed facts with
    an underlying theory that could have generated them. Its implementation is the
    calculation of the parameters B 0 and B 1 . An unconstrained optimization of the
    model using the parameters B 0 and B 1 produces observed land use, water use,
    and income, by crop and irrigation technology. 3 Notice that the process described
    above took the following three steps: • Observation. Measurements are taken on
    average crop yield, average income, land in production, and water use for any
    crop and irrigation technology. • Theory. If irrigators maximize net income using
    the quadratic objective function described above, they use regional water to the
    point where the value of the marginal product of water equals its price. • Replication
    of observed behaviour. The calculated yield parameters B 0 and B 1 are applied
    to the yield function. Total regional income from the crop is maximized, based
    entirely on the calibrated yield function, with no constraints required on land
    or water. Application The farm income optimization model described above was applied
    to explain the amount of total water applied and water depleted for production
    in the Elephant Butte Irrigation District (EBID) served by the Rio Grande Project.
    Data on costs and returns, water use, and land in production were obtained for
    cotton, alfalfa, lettuce, onions, red chile, green chile, and pecans. We used
    the model to estimate parameters for a crop yield function that reproduces observed
    behaviour for each crop and for each irrigation technology. An important application
    of the theoretical model to actual policy decisions lies in applying the calculated
    yield parameters to multiple crops and multiple irrigation technologies and to
    future water supply scenarios or future water policies. The future water supply
    scenario is based on a drought scenario, in which water supplies are limited to
    80% of full levels. Results from Eqs. ( 1 )–(8) are used to conduct a policy analysis
    of drip irrigation subsidies under alternative water supply conditions. The analysis
    requires making a careful distinction between observed data (parameters) and unknown
    data (variables). In the derivation above, B 0 and B 1 are unknown but calculated
    data. Remaining terms in Eqs. ( 1 )–(8) are observed. We use a notation below
    in which all endogenous variables (unknowns) end with _v, while all parameters
    (known data) end with _p. The subscripts are also important: s refers to a water
    supply scenario, either 100% or 80% of full. The subscript p at the end of a variable
    or parameter refers to a drip irrigation subsidy level, taking on percentage values
    0, 25, 50, 75, and 100. The subscript j is a crop subsidy index for major crops
    grown in the region: alfalfa, cotton, lettuce, onions, green chile, red chile,
    and pecans. The k subscript refers to the irrigation technology, surface or drip.
    This paper makes a distinction between water applied and water depleted. Water
    applied is the sum over crops and irrigation technologies of the land in production
    times water applied per unit land shown in Table 1. where B wa _p is water application
    rate per unit land, and Land_v is land under irrigation. Total water depleted
    (crop ET) is land in production multiplied by the water depletions per unit land,
    summed over crops and crop technologies. where B we _p is ET per unit land. For
    each crop and crop technology, crop yield can vary by policy and hydrologic scenario.
    The crop yield parameters described above as B 0 and B 1 are applied below using
    the methods shown in Eqs. ( 7 ) and ( 8 ). One pair of crop yield parameters is
    calculated for each crop (j) and irrigation technology (k). The parameters are
    shown in Table 2, presented as the calculated B''s using data shown in Table 1.
    Crop yields for the regional crops and technologies are: where B 0 _p and B 1
    _p are the parameters whose calculations are described in Eqs. ( 7 ) and ( 8 ).
    Eq. ( 11 ) implements Eq. ( 1 ) by crop, technology, policy, and scenario. The
    variable Land_v is endogenous; so, for non-base policies and hydrologic scenarios,
    crop yield is unknown until the model optimization occurs. Net revenue per unit
    land Netrev_v is influenced by yield. Crop price P_p and cost per acre C_p are
    constant across policies and hydrologic scenarios, while Yield_v varies by the
    indices shown in Eq. ( 11 ). So Netrev_v per unit land is defined by: where total
    cost per unit land C_p includes both water and non-water costs. What is defined
    here as C_p (total production costs per unit land, including the cost of water)
    appears in Eq. ( 7 ) as the sum of P w *B w and C. Finally, total farm profitability
    is defined as: Total farm profit, an endogenous variable that the model optimizes,
    is net revenue per unit land multiplied by the land in production summed over
    crops and irrigation technologies. Water depletions (not applications) are constrained
    to base levels for each of the alternative drip irrigation subsidy levels. After
    calibration, the base model optimization reproduces observed history without constraints.
    However, for alternative policy proposals (drip irrigation subsidies greater than
    zero) or hydrologic scenarios (dry), water depletions are constrained to not exceed
    base depletions: In this equation, Watsupply_p takes on a value of 1.00 for the
    full water supply scenario and a value of 0.80 for the drought scenario; Land_p
    is observed cropland under irrigation for the period of analysis. The complete
    model can be used to maximize the irrigation district''s total farm profitability
    from Eq. ( 13 ) subject to the water supply defined by Eq. ( 14 ). The quadratic
    program optimizes land in production by crop and irrigation technology based on
    regionally available depletable water supplies. 4 Acknowledgements The authors

    researchers prefer the term consumption to depletion, as shown for example in
    Perry et al. (2009) and Hellegers et al. ( 2011). 2. The following amortization
    was used to translate capital into annual equivalent costs of investing in a drip
    irrigation system: AP = i(CC) / [1 – (1+i)–T ], where AP (annual equivalent amortization
    payment) = $364; CC (unsubsidized drip irrigation system capital cost/acre) =
    $2500; i (interest rate) = 7.5%; and T (system life) = 10 years. 3. Our approach
    to PMP is an example for approaching an “inverse problem”, in which observed data
    are used to recover parameters from the data-generating process based on an assumed
    known structure of that process (Yeh, 1986). 4. GAMS code is posted at Department

    to make agriculture more efficient by combining new technologies to improve its
    procedure. Improving irrigation efficiency in agriculture is thus critical for
    the survival of sustainable agricultural production. Smart irrigation methods
    can enhance irrigation efficiency, specially with the introduction of wireless
    communication systems, monitoring devices, and enhanced control techniques for
    efficient irrigation scheduling. The study compared on a wide range of study subjects
    to investigate scientific approaches for smart irrigation. As a result, this project
    included a wide range of topics related to irrigation methods, decision-making,
    and technology used. Information was gathered from a variety of scientific papers.
    So, our research relied on several published documents, the majority of which
    were published during the last four years, and authors from all over the world.
    In the meantime, various irrigation initiatives were given special attention.
    Following that, the evaluation focuses on the key components of smart irrigation,
    such as real-time irrigation scheduling, IoT, the importance of an internet connection,
    smart sensing, and energy harvesting. Published in: IEEE Access ( Early Access

    \ in Sweden has triggered questions about climate adaptation and mitigation measures,\
    \ \nespecially in the agricultural sector, which suffered the most. This study\
    \ applies a water-food-energy \nnexus modelling framework to evaluate drought\
    \ impacts on irrigation and agriculture in Sweden using \n2018 and 2019 as case\
    \ studies. A previous water-food-energy nexus model was updated to facilitate\
    \ an \ninvestigation of the benefits of data-driven irrigation scheduling as compared\
    \ to existing irrigation \nguidelines. Moreover, the benefits of assimilating\
    \ earth observation data in the crop model have been \nexplored. The assimilation\
    \ of leaf area index data from the Copernicus Global Land Service significantly\
    \ \nimprove the crop yield estimation as compared to default crop model parameters.\
    \ The results show that \nthe irrigation water productivities of the proposed\
    \ model are measurably improved compared to \nconventional irrigation guidelines\
    \ both in 2018 and in 2019. This is mostly due to the advantage of the \nproposed\
    \ model in providing ETc-driven guidelines by using spatially-explicit data generated\
    \ by \nmesoscale models from the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute.\
    \ During a normal year, \nthe proposed irrigation management system leads to significant\
    \ water savings as compared to \nconventional irrigation guidelines. The modelling\
    \ results show that temperature stress during the 2018 \ndrought played a key\
    \ role in the crop yield reduction, with yield reductions of up to 35%. In the\
    \ context \nof the water-food-energy nexus, this motivates the implementation\
    \ of new technologies to reduce water \nand temperature stress to mitigate likely\
    \ negative effects of climate change. A visualization platform is \ndeveloped\
    \ using an open-source package for Google Earth® to help farmers and water and\
    \ energy \nmanagement agencies to better understand the connections between water\
    \ and energy use and food \nproduction. This can be significant, especially during\
    \ the occurrence of extreme events, but also to adapt \nto the negative effects\
    \ of climate changes. \n \nKeywords: water-food-energy nexus, drought, irrigation,\
    \ data visualization.  \n1 Introduction \nIn 2018, Sweden experienced an unprecedented\
    \ drought that severely affected the agricultural, water \nand energy sectors.\
    \ During the period from June-July, some regions experienced a significant reduction\
    \ \nin precipitation as compared to a normal year. Krikken et al. (2019) showed\
    \ a precipitation anomaly for \nJuly 2018 ranging from 0 mm to -100 mm as compared\
    \ to 1981-2010 climatology. In July 2018, some \nlocations, such as Kastlösa on\
    \ Öland and Komstorp in Blekinge did not receive any precipitation while \nothers\
    \ such as Varberg and Öland's southern cape received 0.2 and 0.8 mm, respectively\
    \ (SMHI, 2020a). \nThis caused a drastic reduction in crop yields, including key\
    \ crops such as wheat, potatoes and other \nforage crops. The lack of forage crops\
    \ negatively affected the dairy farmers and related industry. \nAnalysis of the\
    \ Standardised Precipitation-Evapotranspiration (SPEI) Index for the period from\
    \ 1950 – \n2020 indicates that 2018 was one of the worst droughts for Swedish\
    \ farmers in more than 50 years (SPEI \nGlobal Drought Monitor, 2020). As a result,\
    \ farmers had to start irrigating or installing irrigation \nsystems. However,\
    \ the scarcity of rainfall also severely affected the available water resources\
    \ for \nagricultural production. Some counties, such as Skåne, issued restrictions\
    \ on irrigation to preserve the \nscarce water resources, adding further stress\
    \ to the farmers, especially those who had water-intensive \ncrops, such as vegetables\
    \ and potatoes (The Local, 2020). Compared to southern European countries \nsuch\
    \ as Italy or Spain, where irrigation is a well-established practice, Swedish\
    \ farmers generally lack \nadequate means and incentives to determine water use\
    \ requirements for crops, schedule irrigation \napplications to match crop water\
    \ requirements, evaluate the response of crop yields to different water \nmanagement\
    \ practices, and evaluate current on-farm water-efficiency levels. The combination\
    \ of these \nfactors led to the worst crop harvest since the 1950s for Sweden\
    \ (Bioenergy International, 2020). The \nextreme drought also affected the energy\
    \ sector. Higher volumes of water pumped for irrigation required \nhigher electricity\
    \ demand in the agricultural sector. Low precipitation levels affected hydropower\
    \ \ngeneration due to low refilling volumes. The state-owned power company Vattenfall\
    \ AB closed the 900 \nMW number 2 nuclear reactor at its Ringhals power plant\
    \ since the high water required for the cooling \nprocess reached temperatures\
    \ that could threaten the safety and function of the reactor (Renew \nEconomy,\
    \ 2020). This acute drought event in Sweden clearly highlighted the water-food-energy\
    \ (WFE) \nnexus interrelationships and how those can be exacerbated during extreme\
    \ events. Moreover, SMHI \nclimate change scenarios predict that the annual mean\
    \ temperature in Sweden will grow steadily from \npresent until the year 2100\
    \ and beyond (Belusic et al., 2019). The precipitation patterns from climate \n\
    models show high variability indicating that drought events and heat waves will\
    \ likely happen more \nfrequently, with socio-economic consequences in several\
    \ sectors. As highlighted by Belusic et al. \n(2019), studies on drought and drought\
    \ effects on water balance calculations in Scandinavia are limited. \nSweden needs\
    \ to account for increasing drought frequency and severity as part of ongoing\
    \ planning \nefforts to mitigate the potential effects of climate change and extreme\
    \ weather phenomena. In 2018, the \nSwedish Government presented a national crisis\
    \ package valued at more than 1.2 billion SEK (1 \nSEK≈0.1 USD), primarily to\
    \ cover the fodder shortage and other loss of income that farmers \nexperienced\
    \ due to the drought. 760 million SEK were invested in 2019 to develop measures\
    \ to alleviate \nthe situation for the drought-affected agricultural sector (Government\
    \ Offices of Sweden, 2020). \nRecently, Grusson et al. (2021) analyzed the impacts\
    \ of climate change on the Swedish agriculture \nhighlighting the increasing need\
    \ for irrigation, especially during the beginning of the season due to a \nhigher\
    \ probability of dry springs. The SMHI provides a water-shortage risk service\
    \ through an overview \nof groundwater levels, surface water levels, and statistical\
    \ summaries of precipitation amounts. \nHowever, this service does not incorporate\
    \ any dynamic satellite information regarding soil moisture \nand vegetation characteristics.\
    \ Currently, only general irrigation guidelines, based on the Penman–\nMonteith\
    \ equation (Allen et al., 1998) are provided. In addition, existing guidelines\
    \ sometimes suggest \ndifferent values. For instance, Bergström and Barkefors\
    \ (2004) suggested irrigating potatoes with 100 \nmm/season on average (maximum\
    \ 200 mm/season). The Swedish Board of Agriculture (2007) \nmentioned that water\
    \ requirements for potatoes should be between 300 and 350 mm, assuming average\
    \ \nprecipitation during the same period between 170 and 250 mm. The report from\
    \ the Swedish Board of \nAgriculture (2007) also provided static guidelines for\
    \ the irrigation of potatoes for different locations, \ne.g., Visby (57.6348°\
    \ N, 18.2948° E) with 130 mm/season recommended, and Umeå (63.8258° N, \n20.2630°\
    \ E) with 75 mm/season recommended. No irrigation management services are provided\
    \ in \nSweden unlike countries or regions that historically have been more prone\
    \ to drought. In addition, the \ninput data for irrigation as well as for nutrient\
    \ management depends on spatio-temporal data such as \nclimatological data and\
    \ soil types, and this heterogeneity requires spatially explicit information to\
    \ \nproduce accurate guidelines. For this reason, researchers and institutions\
    \ have been active in developing \ndecision support systems based on simulation\
    \ and optimization models, or satellite data observations, \nor hybrid approaches\
    \ to provide guidelines on optimal irrigation and nutrient applications and thus\
    \ \ninform smart farming management. The NASA Satellite Irrigation Management\
    \ Support (SIMS) system \n(Melton et al., 2012; Pereira et al., 2020) integrates\
    \ Earth observation data from Landsat and MODIS \nwith meteorological observations\
    \ to generate daily maps of evapotranspiration (ET) and 8-day map of \ncrop coefficients\
    \ for millions of hectares of farmland in the western United States (US). OpenET\
    \ \n(OpenET, 2021) has implemented six satellite-based ET models on the Google\
    \ Earth Engine platform \n(Gorelick et al., 2017) to make daily, monthly and annual\
    \ ET data for the western US easily available at \nfield scales (30m x 30m per\
    \ pixel) via a web-based UI and application programming interface (API). \nThe\
    \ aim of this study is to investigate the effects of implementing a gridded WFE\
    \ irrigation management \nsystem for Sweden by using the spatially explicit climatic\
    \ data generated by SMHI. Specific objectives \nof this study are to:  \n• \n\
    further develop the model presented in Zhang et al. (2018) for Nebraska and in\
    \ Campana et al. \n(2018) for Sweden by implementing the Penman-Monteith equation\
    \ for the calculation of \nreference evapotranspiration, and related validation\
    \ using remote sensing data and tower flux \ndata; \n• \nanalyze the irrigation\
    \ water productivity of existing irrigation guidelines in Sweden and \ncompare\
    \ the results with the guidelines provided by the developed model; \n• \nanalyze\
    \ water-food-energy nexus aspects related to irrigation systems in Sweden; \n\
    • \ndevelop the model interface to create a demonstration system for a future\
    \ operational service, \nprimarily for farmers interested in crop conditions and\
    \ irrigation guidelines, but also for energy \nand water management related agencies.\
    \ \nAlthough the model presented in this study is applied to Sweden using gridded\
    \ data generated by two \nmesoscale models (Strång (2020) and Mesan (SMHI, 2020b))\
    \ from the SMHI, it has general validity \nand can be extended to other regions\
    \ using different gridded products for climatological variables.  \nThe paper\
    \ is organized as follows: the problem statement and the objective of this study\
    \ are introduced \nin Section 1; a literature review of water-food-energy nexus\
    \ models and irrigation management systems \nis provided in section 2; data and\
    \ methods are presented in section 3; the main results of this study (i.e., \n\
    model validation, irrigation water productivity for three irrigation guidelines,\
    \ and water-food energy \nnexus relationships in the irrigation sector, and visualization)\
    \ are presented in Section 4; and, the \nconclusions of this study are summarized\
    \ in section 5. \n2 Literature review \n2.1 Water-food-energy nexus models \n\
    The concept of water-food-energy (WFE) nexus was introduced during the 2008 World\
    \ economic forum \nto discuss the important interlinkages among the water, food,\
    \ and energy sectors highlighted by the \nglobal food security crisis 2008 (Dominic,\
    \ 2011). The WFE nexus approach ensures the identification \nand quantification\
    \ of the synergies among sectors, supports the sustainable management of natural\
    \ \nresources data and tools for decision-makers (Lawford, 2019), promotes ecosystem\
    \ protection, \neconomic development, social equity (Sperling and Berke, 2017),\
    \ and provides directions to mitigate \nclimate change and adapt to climate changes\
    \ (Eftelioglu et al., 2016). The agricultural and food \nproduction sectors are\
    \ at the center of the nexus concept because both sectors require significant\
    \ amounts \nof water and energy for irrigation and food production: 70% of the\
    \ global water withdrawals and 30% \nof the world’s total energy consumption are\
    \ allocated to this sector (FAO, 2017). Since the research on \nthe nexus has\
    \ started, several modelling tools have been developed. Nevertheless, most of\
    \ the modelling \napproaches have only looked at interactions between two out\
    \ of the three sectors, which is not optimal \nto improve resources efficiency\
    \ (Kaddoura and El Khatib, 2017). Moreover, very few models are at the \nstage\
    \ of implementing the WFE nexus approach (Dai et al., 2018; Shannak et al., 2018;\
    \ Endo et al., \n2019) and support the political decisions (Bazilian et al., 2011).\
    \ Moreover, as highlight by Lawford \n(2019), there is a general data gap, both\
    \ in the spatial and temporal dimensions, concerning the \nobservation of key\
    \ parameters for the WFE nexus analysis. Some examples of integrated WFE nexus\
    \ \ntools development are provided in this section.  \nTo minimize the economic\
    \ and societal costs resulting from agricultural water shortages in Northeastern\
    \ \nColorado, Burrow et al. (2019) developed an optimization model including costs,\
    \ penalties, unmet \ndemands, topography, oversupply, and capacity to determine\
    \ the capacity, configuration, and operation \nof water reservoirs. The authors\
    \ showed that the implementation of the WFE nexus integrated model \ncould support\
    \ strategic decisions to avoid water shortages in key sectors. The authors also\
    \ highlighted \nthat the low water footprint of renewable energies, such as wind\
    \ and solar power, could represent a \nsustainable path for electricity generation.\
    \ Amjath-Babu et al. (2019) developed a hydro-economic \nmodel to investigate\
    \ hydropower development in one Himalayan region. The model performed \neconomic\
    \ optimization of water management including irrigation and climate change. The\
    \ authors \nhighlighted that the flood and irrigation control performed through\
    \ hydropower reservoirs was \nfundamental for meeting the Sustainable Development\
    \ Goals (SDGs). Mahlknecht et al. (2020) studied \nthe WFE security in the Latin\
    \ America and Caribbean Region to study the interrelationship among those \nsectors.\
    \ The authors developed a nexus-based index to evaluate those interlinkages among\
    \ WFE \nresources. Through this WFE nexus framework, the authors highlighted a\
    \ critical situation concerning \nenergy conversion capabilities and water scarcity.\
    \ Moreover, climate changes could negatively affect \nrainfall patterns, and accordingly\
    \ reduce hydropower production and increase food imports. There are \nfew studies\
    \ conducted on the WFE nexus and agriculture in Sweden. Destouni et al. (2013)\
    \ analyzed \nthe hydro-climatic, agricultural and hydropower changes from the\
    \ twentieth century in nine major basins \nin Sweden. The authors concluded that\
    \ the evapotranspiration increased for irrigated and non-irrigated \nagriculture\
    \ as well as for the hydropower sector. By extrapolating the results from regional\
    \ to global \nscale, the authors highlighted the necessity for integrated climate\
    \ and Earth system models to assess \nhuman water uses. This conclusion was drawn\
    \ because the results obtained by the authors showed an \nincrease of evapotranspiration\
    \ larger than the corresponding planetary boundary as suggested by \nRockström\
    \ (2009). The study conducted by Jaramillo et al. (2013), which aligns with Wivstad\
    \ et al. \n(2009) and Destouni et al. (2013) in terms of Sweden's agriculture\
    \ development and the increased \nevapotranspiration, distinguished the effects\
    \ of climate and land use. By analyzing the water balances, \nthe authors concluded\
    \ that the rapid increase of evapotranspiration was for about 30% due to climate\
    \ \nchanges while the rest 70% was due to shifts from semi natural grasslands\
    \ to cultivated land. \nAll the reviewed approaches have shown that the awareness\
    \ of the WFE nexus is increasing, the main \nchallenge is still to increase the\
    \ overlapping areas of integration among those sectors, and there is still \n\
    lack of knowledge, expertise, information and tools, especially for operationally\
    \ implementing the nexus \n(Liu et al., 2017).  \n2.2 Irrigation management systems\
    \ \nThis section briefly summarize some of the research studies conducted on the\
    \ topic of irrigation \nmanagement systems. Wang et al. (2019) developed a web-based\
    \ irrigation decision support system for \ncanal irrigation management. The model\
    \ is based upon two modules. The first module is for real-time \nirrigation forecast\
    \ and scheduling. The second module is for planning the canals’ water delivery\
    \ \nvolumes. In Italy, IRRINET is a decision support system for on-farm irrigation\
    \ scheduling (Mannini et \nal., 2013), which gives the farmers day-by-day information\
    \ on how much and when to irrigate crops. \nThe system implements a real-time\
    \ irrigation scheduling through climatic and meteorological data \ngathered daily.\
    \ GREDRIP is a decision support system to minimize the pumping station's energy\
    \ costs \nand adapt the irrigation network management to the crop distribution\
    \ and water requirements (Lima et \nal., 2018). Mahmoud and Gan (2019) developed\
    \ a model to enhance the irrigation water management \nin central Saudi Arabia\
    \ by assessing the spatio-temporal variation of actual evapotranspiration through\
    \ \nremote sensing techniques and meteorological data. Their study found out that\
    \ the actual annual \nevapotranspiration estimated by the soil water balance model\
    \ was around 9-11% higher than the \nmodelled actual evapotranspiration in the\
    \ studied area. Zhang et al. (2012) developed the ZhaoKou \nirrigation management\
    \ system, consisting of a precipitation forecasting module, a crop water demand\
    \ \nforecasting module, and a crop coefficient index. The established system improved\
    \ water efficiency, \nproviding a theoretical basis for water resources scheduling\
    \ and channels' rational control. Galindo et \nal. (2017) presented a methodology\
    \ for optimal water and energy management in the irrigation system \nusing a two-layer\
    \ management scheme. The upper layer is an optimal control strategy to plan how\
    \ to \nserve the required water within a five-day prediction horizon to minimize\
    \ pumping electricity costs. The \nlower layer is a scheduling algorithm that\
    \ decides how to schedule the different pumps to supply the \ndesired flow, minimize\
    \ cost, and maximize efficiency. In Romania, a field-scale irrigation planning\
    \ and \nmanagement system was set up and tested (FutureWater, 2020). Irrigation\
    \ guidelines are provided by \nintegrating soil moisture content ground data with\
    \ hydrological model calculations. In Greece, \nagriculture and especially irrigation\
    \ plays a key role in terms of water management, and the \nIRMA_SYSTEM (2021)\
    \ calculates site specific crop water requirements and irrigation scheduling at\
    \ \nhigh spatial resolution (Malamos et al., 2015). The decision support system\
    \ integrates historical and \nforecast agrometeorological data, crop data, and\
    \ soil data to provide timely guidelines for irrigation. \nOther examples of decision\
    \ support systems are FERTIRRIGERE (Battilani, 2004), a model-based \ndecision\
    \ support system used in Italy that proved to reduce the nitrogen application\
    \ on horticultural \nproducts by 46% compared to conventional practices, with\
    \ no notable effects on yield and quality. A \ncomprehensive review of irrigation\
    \ and fertilization decision support systems is provided in Gallardo et \nal.\
    \ (2020).  \nMost of the current available irrigation management systems lack\
    \ the WFE perspective, where \ninformation concerning irrigation water requirements,\
    \ crop response to irrigation, and energy \nconsumption are integrated. Thus,\
    \ this study lays the foundations to develop an operational WFE nexus \nirrigation\
    \ management system for Sweden, by including all the three areas of the nexus.\
    \  \n3 Data and methods  \n3.1 Data \nThis section describes the model updates\
    \ with reference to previous works, and the development of the \nvisualization\
    \ platform. The gridded meteorological data used to generate the results are mainly\
    \ taken \nfrom the mesoscale models Strång (2020) and Mesan (SMHI, 2020b) developed\
    \ by SMHI. We have \nused as case study 2018, due to the serious drought that\
    \ has affected the entire country, and 2019, as a \nnormal year. The crop model\
    \ used in this study refers to the model developed by Williams et al. (1989).\
    \ \nA more detailed description of the WFE nexus model can be found in Zhang et\
    \ al. (2018) and Campana \net al. (2018). The crop mask has been built upon the\
    \ data provided by the Swedish Board of Agriculture \n(2020). The groundwater\
    \ depth dataset refer to the product developed by Fan et al. (2013). The soil\
    \ field \ncapacity and wilting point are from the Global Soil Data Task Group\
    \ (2000). The irrigation areas refers \nto FAO (2016). The leaf area index used\
    \ for improving the LAI sub model is from Copernicus Global \nLand Service (2020).\
    \ The 2018 data concerning the flux tower have been retrieved from the Integrated\
    \ \nCarbon Observation System Sweden (ICOS, 2019). Only one flux tower located\
    \ at the agricultural \nresearch station of Lanna (58°20′N, 13°06′E, 75 m asl)\
    \ has been used for validation since it is the only \navailable flux tower installed\
    \ on an agricultural field in Sweden. A detailed description of the station \n\
    and related measured variables can be found in ICOS (2021). Agricultural statistics\
    \ were provided \nthrough personal communication with the station principal investigator\
    \ (Weslien, 2020). \n3.2 \nModel updates \nThis section describes the model updates\
    \ with reference to previous works. As compared to the model \npresented in Campana\
    \ et al. (2018), where the daily reference evapotranspiration ETo (mm/day) was\
    \ \ncalculated using the Hargreaves and Samani equation (Hargreaves and Samani,\
    \ 1982), in this study ETo \nhas been calculated using the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith\

    \ of ETo. In this study, the ETo and actual ET (ETa) \nestimates generated using\
    \ the model and meteorological datasets described above have been validated \n\
    using the flux tower installed at the agricultural research station of Lanna (ICOS,\
    \ 2019). We validated \nthe ETa estimates from the model using the latent heat\

    \ Ts is the surface temperature (°C). The surface temperature has been assumed\
    \ equal to the air \ntemperature as in Jungqvist et al. (2014). In SWEDIMS, the\

    \ agricultural research station of Lanna (Weslien, 2020). The model has been thus\
    \ set up for oat \nwater balance and crop yield simulations. The ET in cultural\
    \ conditions, a key component in the water \nbalance, has been calculated with\
    \ an iterative approach that minimizes the root mean square error \nbetween the\
    \ ETc curve based on the FAO guidelines for oat development stages and corresponding\
    \ \ncultural factors (Allen et al., 1998) and the ETc curve described by the following\

    \ \n(Williams et al., 1989) \n \nTo improve the model accuracy, we have assimilated\
    \ remote sensing data for LAI into the crop model. \nFrom the LAI data, significant\
    \ information can also be deducted, such as the approximate crop planting \ndate\
    \ and the parameters of the leaf area development curve. Three scenarios have\
    \ been considered. In \nthe first scenario (S1-LAI), the LAI is calculated as\
    \ in Zhang et al. (2018) by using the default values as \nin Williams et al. (1989).\
    \ In the second scenario (S2-LAI), the LAI values for the closest coordinates\
    \ at \nLanna research station are retrieved from the Copernicus Global Land Service\
    \ (CGLS, 2020) and \ndirectly fed into the model. In the last scenario (S3-LAI),\
    \ the data assimilation is performed by \nminimizing the root mean square error\
    \ (RMSE) between data generated by the developed model and the \ndata from CGLS\
    \ with a similar approach as carried out by Novelli et al. (2019) and Wagner et\
    \ al. (2020). \nThe optimization is performed through a genetic algorithm (GA)\
    \ by using as decisional variables the \nkey parameters that define the LAI curve\
    \ development: planting date, the growing season, the points that \ndefine optimal\
    \ LAI development curve, the LAI decline factor and the fraction of the growing\
    \ season at \nwhich the LAI starts to decline. The implementation of more advanced\
    \ data assimilation algorithms (Jin \net al., 2018), such as Kalman Filter (KF)\
    \ or Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF), is not included in this \nwork because beyond\
    \ its scope. Since this study has mainly focused on the comparison between \n\
    irrigation guidelines, as described in more details in Section 3.3, the data assimilation\
    \ is not applied in \nthe calculation of the irrigation productivity while performing\
    \ large-scale simulations. \n3.3 Irrigation management scenarios \nAlthough there\
    \ is motivation to improve farm irrigation management to increase production,\
    \ profit, and \nwater use efficiency, it has to be pointed out that currently\
    \ in Sweden only general irrigation guidelines \nare provided, for instance by\
    \ Bergström and Barkefors (2004) combined with local experiences or tools \ndeveloped\
    \ for other agro ecologies outside of Sweden. There is thus a need of such tools\
    \ and services to \nbe designed for Swedish crop and climatic conditions (Barron,\
    \ 2020). We used as a case study two \ncounties in the south of Sweden, Blekinge\
    \ and Skåne, which belong to statistical region (SE22) with the \nhighest water\
    \ consumption for irrigation as shown in Figure 2.  \n \nFigure 1: Agricultural\
    \ water use, by type of water use and region in the period 1995-2015 (Statistic\
    \ \nSweden, 2021). \n \nBlekinge and in particular Skåne have the highest percentages\
    \ of irrigated areas among cropland (FAO, \n2016). We used potato as a reference\
    \ crop, as in Campana et al. (2018), since it is the most irrigated crop \nin\
    \ Sweden (Brundell et al., 2008). The total area cultivated with potatoes in Blekinge\
    \ and Skåne in 2018 \nwas 2,050 and 10,820 ha, respectively (Statistic Sweden,\
    \ 2018). We thus have calculated the irrigation \ndemand by using SWEDIMS and\
    \ assuming that all the cultivated area is irrigated and the cultivated area \n\
    is distributed among the grid cells equipped for irrigation (FAO, 2016). This\
    \ approach is similar to \nHughes et al. (2013), which also incorporated stochasticity\
    \ in terms of irrigation requirements \ndistributed in time, in Dutta et al. (2017),\
    \ and in HYPE, the reference hydrological model for Sweden \n(SMHI, 2020c).  Johnson\
    \ et al. (2016) analysed the differences between irrigation following standard\
    \ \npractices and irrigation based on decision support models that incorporate\
    \ information on ET, such as \nthe NASA SIMS model (Melton et al., 2012; Pereira\
    \ et al., 2020). Based on two years of field data \ncollected for head lettuce\
    \ and broccoli using a randomized block design, the authors found that standard\
    \ \npractices lead to an increase in water consumption between 26 and 40% for\
    \ lettuce and between 39 and \n51% for broccoli, as compared to ET-based irrigation\
    \ management strategies based on data from SIMS. \nCrop yields and quality were\
    \ very similar among the treatments, and no statistically significant \ndifferences\
    \ in crop yield or quality differences were observed. Inspired by the results\
    \ achieved by \nJohnson et al. (2016), we have developed three scenarios to analyse\
    \ the impact of an irrigation \nmanagement service as compared to conventional\
    \ irrigation guidelines on the irrigation water \nproductivity and water savings.\
    \ Three scenarios have been defined for the irrigation requirements: in the \n\
    first scenario (S1-irrigation ET), the irrigation demand follows the guidelines\
    \ generated by the model \ndeveloped in this study. According to Bergström and\
    \ Barkefors (2004), 70% of the potato area is \nirrigated in average with 100\
    \ mm/season up to 200 mm/season with 3 to 4 irrigation events. Slightly \ndifferent\
    \ values were presented in the report from the Swedish Board of Agriculture (2007)\
    \ where the \npotatoes seasonal water requirement was between 300 and 350 mm assuming\
    \ a rainfall of 170 to 250 \nmm during the irrigation season. \n \nFigure 2: Irrigated\
    \ areas in Sweden (FAO, 2016). \n \nBased on those two static guidelines, we have\
    \ thus considered two further scenarios: S2-irrigation static \n100 consists of\
    \ three irrigation events for a total of 100 mm/season while S3-irrigation static\
    \ 150 \nconsisted in applying 150 mm in four events. A summary of the scenarios\
    \ is provided in Table 3. The \nresults among irrigation guidelines are compared\
    \ in terms of irrigation water productivity (IWP) (kg/m3), \ndefined as the ratio\
    \ between the different in crop yield with and without irrigation and the water\
    \ applied \nthrough irrigation as in Bos (1985) and in Stepanovic  et al. (2021).\
    \ The irrigation follows an operational \nstrategy similar to solar irrigation\
    \ systems, which provide an optimal dynamic match between water \ndemand and supply\
    \ (Campana et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2018). As compared to the previous study\
    \ \n(Campana et al., 2018) where we assumed to keep the soil moisture constant,\
    \ in this study irrigation is \nperformed only when the water stress coefficient\
    \ (Ks) as defined in Allen et al. (1998) goes below the \nunity. Different from\
    \ previous studies (Campana et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2018), no optimization\
    \ is \nperformed or investigated in this study.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable 3:\

    \ in this \nsection, we have presented in Section 4 a case study on energy consumption\
    \ for irrigation for two \nSwedish counties, Blekinge and Skåne. Two scenarios\
    \ (Scenarios 1 and 2) are defined, which represent \nthe worst and best cases\
    \ in terms of energy consumption in irrigation. The parameters of those two \n\
    investigated scenarios are summarized in Table 4.  \n \n \n \nFigure 3: Parameters\

    \ \n90% \n \nShortly, Scenario 1 (S1-energy) represents the worst case in terms\
    \ of energy consumption. It refers to \nthe adoption of a sprinkler irrigation\
    \ fed by a diesel-powered pump that uses groundwater as water \nsource. Scenario\
    \ 2 (S2-energy) refers to an electricity powered micro irrigation system that\
    \ pumps water \nfrom a nearby surface water source. S1 has higher energy consumption\
    \ than S2 because of the higher \nhydraulic head (depth of the water sources and\
    \ required pressure for the irrigation system), higher water \nconsumption (lower\
    \ efficiency of the irrigation system), and lower efficiency of the pumping system\
    \ \n(power source and pump efficiency).  \n3.5 Development of the visualization\
    \ platform \nThe current version of the developed model relies on Google Earth\
    \ Pro® (2021) for the visualization \n(SWEDIMS, 2021). The model retrieves data\
    \ from the SMHI models Strång (2020) and Mesan (SMHI, \n2020b), which are further\
    \ processed with the model presented in this study. The gridded data are \nuploaded\
    \ to the web database (SWEDIMS, 2021). Once the gridded data are stored, a parallel\
    \ code \ndevelops a KML file to visualize the spatial data for the entire country.\
    \ The generated KML file also \nallows the retrieval of time-series image data\
    \ as well as MS Excel files for more than 300 locations \nacross the country.\
    \ The KML file has been developed using the open-source package Google Earth \n\
    Toolbox developed by Scott Lee Davis (2020). \n4 Results and discussions \n4.1\
    \ Model validation  \nThe comparison of reference evapotranspiration and crop\
    \ yield using Penman-Monteith ETo versus the \nHargreaves and Samani equations\
    \ for reference ET is depicted in Figure 4 (scatter plot of reference \nevapotranspiration\
    \ on the left and difference in crop yield on the right). As it can be seen, the\
    \ Hargreaves \nand Samani equation slightly underestimates ET0 as compared to\
    \ Penman-Monteith as also highlighted \nin the study conducted by Awal et al.\
    \ (2020). Nevertheless, the absolute difference in crop yield \nestimation is\
    \ 0.11 t/ha, less than 2.5%. This result can have practical consequences on the\
    \ \nimplementation of the reference evapotranspiration model, since Penman-Monteith\
    \ requires significant \nmore input data as compared to Hargreaves and Samani´s\
    \ model. The validation of the simulated actual \nevapotranspiration (ETa) is\
    \ presented in Figure 5 using ETa derived from the flux tower. The scatter \n\
    plot shows an R2 of 0.80 and RMSE of 1.38 between the derived and simulated daily\
    \ ETa during the \ncrop-growing season using Penman-Monteith for the calculation\
    \ of ET0. The R2 is 0.78 while the RMSE \nis 1.17 when the Hargreaves and Samani\
    \ equation is implemented. This shows a good agreement \nbetween measured and\
    \ modelled data with Zhang et al. (2016), which reported an R2 of 0.549 between\
    \ \nflux-tower derived ET to MODIS ET product. The relationship between the soil\
    \ water content based on \nthe daily values calculated from SWEDIMS and the values\
    \ measured at the Lanna FLUXNET station \nfor different depths is presented in\
    \ Figure 6. The calculated soil water content refers to the value within \nthe\
    \ crop root depth (max 1 m), and is based on the water balance for the grid cell\
    \ of 2.5*2.5 km \n(resolution of the gridded input data of Strång and Mesan) containing\
    \ the agricultural station. Good \nagreement is observed between the measured\
    \ and simulated values, especially with the soil water content \nat 0.3m depth.\
    \ It has to be pointed out that in the simulations of the soil water content,\
    \ capillarity was \nnot included. Moreover, it is worth to note two important\
    \ aspects. First, the calculation of the soil water \ncontent has been performed\
    \ by assuming that at the beginning of the simulations the soil water content\
    \ \nwas at field capacity. Second, the field capacity is extracted by a gridded\
    \ product (Global Soil Data Task \nGroup, 2000) that can not represent accurately\
    \ the heterogeneity of soil properties at field level.  \n \nFigure 4: Comparison\
    \ between reference evapotranspiration (left) and crop yield (right) by using\
    \ the \nPenman-Monteith (PM) and the Hargreaves and Samani (HS) equations for\
    \ the year 2018. \n \nFigure 5: Relationship between measured and calculated actual\
    \ evapotranspiration using the Penman-\nMonteith (PM) and the Hargreaves and Samani\
    \ (HS) equations for the year 2018 during the crop-\ngrowing season). \n \n \n\
    Figure 6: Measured soil water content at different depths at the Lanna FLUXNET\
    \ station and \ncalculated soil water content within the crop root depth for the\
    \ year 2018. \n \nThe results of the crop yield validation at the agricultural\
    \ research station of Lanna are depicted in Figure \n7. The crop yields simulated\
    \ with the model used in this study were compared with the crop yield \nretrieved\
    \ from the station principal investigator (Weslien, 2020) and Statistics Sweden\
    \ (2018). The \nharvest at the station was approximately 5 t/ha as reported by\
    \ Weslien (2020). The oat yield from \nStatistics Sweden (2018) refers to the\
    \ 2018 county-level oat yield in Västra Götaland County, where the \nLanna research\
    \ station belongs. The simulation results in Figure 7 show very good agreement\
    \ especially \nwith the county-level average yield, considering that the current\
    \ version of the model runs at a resolution \nof 2.5 km and may not provide accurate\
    \ crop yield estimations at the field level due to the heterogeneity \nof the\
    \ required input parameters. In particular, the model is sensitive to parameters,\
    \ such as planting \ndate, LAI, and soil moisture. As can be seen in Figure 7,\
    \ the yield generated from the model using LAI \ndata assimilation with optimization\
    \ (S3-LAI) as carried out by Novelli et al. (2019) and Wagner et al. \n(2020)\
    \ shows the most accurate results as compared to the actual measured yield. The\
    \ percent error as \ncompared to the measured crop yield and the county-level\
    \ statistics is 2% and 10.6%, respectively. \nThose results are in agreement with\
    \ the results presented by Wagner et al. (2020), which demonstrated \nthe superiority\
    \ of the optimization method as compared to simple updating. The authors also\
    \ \ndemonstrated that the optimization approach could lead to similar or even\
    \ improved results as compared \nto more advanced data assimilation algorithms\
    \ such as the extended Kalman filter updating. The LAI \ncurve after optimization\
    \ of the shape key parameters and the LAI data from CGLS are depicted in Figure\
    \ \n8. The crop yield simulations using the default crop parameters as in Williams\
    \ et al. (1989) show similar \nresults by providing simple updates of LAI values\
    \ from CGLS (Figure 7). The LAI data from CGLS \ncomes with a five-day delay.\
    \ In an operational system, this could lead to some inaccuracies for \nestimating\
    \ the water use for irrigation and crop yield (i.e., the potential biomass accumulation).\
    \ This \naspect is not investigated in this study but will be assessed in future\
    \ experimental studies. Balkovič et \nal. (2013) reported similar yields for oat\
    \ in their comprehensive EPIC multi-crop simulation across \n1\n13\n25\n37\n49\n\

    \ water productivity (IWP) (kg/m3) for the investigated irrigation scenarios \n\
    are summarized in Figure 9 for 2018 and in Figure 10 for 2019. The irrigation\
    \ guidelines provided by \nthe model developed in this study shows the highest\
    \ values of IWP in most of the considered grids both \nfor 2018 and 2019. The\
    \ scenarios S2-irrigation static 100 and S3-irrigation static 150 derived from\
    \ \nBergström and Barkefors (2004) and from the Swedish Board of Agriculture (2007)\
    \ show lower IWP \nvalues in both 2018 and 2019. As compared to scenarios S2 and\
    \ S3-irrigation, the guidelines provided \nby the developed spatially-explicit\
    \ model shows higher water volumes for irrigation (i.e., negative water \nsavings\
    \ in Figure 11), but maintains higher IWP values in most of the grids as it can\
    \ be seen in Figure \n9. In 2018, the proposed irrigation management system could\
    \ lead to water savings mostly between -75 \nand -50% as compared to S2-irrigation\
    \ static 100 and between -65 and -25% as compared to S3-\nirrigation static 150\
    \ as depicted in Figure 11 (left). Nevertheless, by analyzing the crop yield reduction\
    \ \nof scenarios S2-irrigation static 100 and S3-irrigation static 150  (see Figure\
    \ 9 (right)) as compared to \nscenario S1-irrigation ET, it can be easily noted\
    \ that crop yield reductions from conventional irrigation \nguidelines varies\
    \ between 20 to 80%.  Most of the input data for irrigation management varies\
    \ \ntemporally and spatially, making spatially-explicit guidelines fundamental.\
    \ Meanwhile, with \nintensifying climate changes and more frequent extreme weather\
    \ events in recent years, such as the \nsevere drought in 2018, it becomes more\
    \ difficult to apply the “typical meteorological” year guidelines \nbased on past\
    \ experiences (Melton et al., 2012). By analyzing the results concerning water\
    \ savings and \ncrop yield reduction for 2019, a more “typical meteorological”\
    \ year as compared to 2018, we can see \nthat most of the water savings range\
    \ between -60% to 90% as compared to scenario S2-irrigation static \n100  and\
    \ between -40 to 95% as compared to scenario S3-irrigation static 100. Even in\
    \ 2019, by \nassuming static guidelines, the crop yield reduction as compared\
    \ to S1-irrigation ET ranges between -5 \nto 70%. By comparing S1-scenario with\
    \ S3-scenario, those modelling results align with Johnson et al. \n(2016), which\
    \ demonstrated the implementation of a large-scale irrigation management service\
    \ (i.e., \nNASA SIMS) can lead to water savings of up to 50% relative to conventional\
    \ irrigation practices. A \nfurther model run for scenario S1-irrigation ET was\
    \ performed by using a threshold value for Ks equals \nto 0.6 (i.e., irrigation\
    \ is performed only when the water stress coefficient reaches a value of 0.6).\
    \ The \nresults are summarized in Table 5 only for one single grid point (56.01°N,\
    \ 14.43°E). As it can be seen, \nboth scenarios suggest a similar applied irrigation\
    \ height, nevertheless, the crop yield for scenario S1-\nirrigation ET is significantly\
    \ higher than for Scenario S3-irrigation due to a better irrigation scheduling\
    \ \n(i.e., when to irrigate and how much irrigate). This further justifies, at\
    \ parity of irrigation height, the \nsuperiority of spatially-explicitly ETc-driven\
    \ guidelines as compared to conventional non-spatially and \ntemporally driven\
    \ irrigation guidelines. ETc-driven irrigation was also acknowledged by Ko and\
    \ \nPiccinni (2009) as one the efficient irrigation schemes to achieved higher\
    \ water use efficiency for \ngrowing corn in Texas. Similar, Hanson and Putnam\
    \ (2000) pointed out that water consumption in \nirrigation for Alfalfa in California\
    \ can be reduced through an improved irrigation scheduling by \nconsidering dynamic\
    \ variation of ETc and soil moisture. The authors also investigated the effects\
    \ of \ndeficit irrigation and pointed out that further water savings in irrigation\
    \ can be achieved by reducing or \navoiding irrigation during those periods when\
    \ the crop yield per water applied is minimal. Similar \nconclusions for maximizing\
    \ Alfalfa water use efficiency in the Great Plains and Intermountain were \nachieved\
    \ by Lindenmayer et al. (2011). \nIn 2018, crop reduction due to temperature stress\
    \ was up to 35% as compared to the ideal case without \ntemperature stress (Figure\
    \ 13). The results refer to two cases:  no irrigation and S1-irrigation ET. Since\
    \ \nthe WFE nexus also represents a framework for innovations and technologies\
    \ for sustainable natural \nresources management, an important technology that\
    \ could be integrated in the agricultural and \nirrigation sector to reduce the\
    \ impacts of water and temperature stresses on crops is agrivoltaic (i.e., the\
    \ \ncombination of photovoltaic systems and crop production in the same area).\
    \ Agrivoltaic systems, as well \nas photovoltaic water pumping systems for irrigation,\
    \ can simultaneously address the interactions among \nwater, energy, and food.\
    \ Due to the shadings on the crops, Amaducci et al. (2018) demonstrated that \n\
    agrivoltaic systems with an optimal density of PV modules can increase crop yields\
    \ due to their \ncapability of keeping higher level of soil moisture. Similarly,\
    \ Barron-Gafford et al. (2019) showed that \nthe combination of PV systems with\
    \ farm activities could lead to reduced drought impact, and higher \nfood yield.\

    \ developments \nThe energy consumption in the irrigation sector for different\
    \ scenarios as defined in Table 4 are depicted \nin Figures 14 and 15. The scenario\
    \ S1-energy shows an energy consumption in the order of ten times \nhigher than\
    \ the best-case scenario (S2-energy). This is due to the combination of efficiencies\
    \ in the \nmodelling chain, water resources depth, and other parameters (Table\
    \ 4). While this result might not \nsignificantly affect a single farmer due to\
    \ the current low electricity price in Sweden (Eurostat, 2021a), \nit might substantially\
    \ affect the regional energy systems in terms of matching electricity supply and\
    \ \ndemand. This mismatch at larger scale (i.e., not at a farm level) might lead\
    \ to a spike in the electricity \nprice due to higher demands that can afterwards\
    \ affect farmers and in general the entire electricity \nbuyers. Moreover, this\
    \ is likely to happen during extreme droughts events and or for long terms negative\
    \ \nclimate changes that typically already put pressure on energy systems, in\
    \ particular hydropower and \nthermal energy conversion plants (Riksbanken, 2018).\
    \ From a WFE nexus perspective, the results in \nFigures 14 and 15 are important\
    \ to in a broader energy and water contexts. As mentioned in section 2.2, \nto\
    \ better understand the WFE nexus with a more integrated approach, the model presented\
    \ in this study \nwill be further developed to analyze other key sectors, such\
    \ as the agriculture, industrial, power, as well \nas the commercial and residential\
    \ sectors. The developed the model will be able to study spatially-\nexplicit\
    \ water and energy demands and supplies at high temporal resolution, which will\
    \ enable the \nidentification of potential energy demand and supply mismatches,\
    \ especially during extreme events and \nor using climate change scenarios data.\
    \ The integration of such model with a hydrological model will \nalso allow to\
    \ identify potential water supply and demand mismatches and thus perform better\
    \ allocation \nof water and natural resources.  \n \nFigure 14: Comparison between\
    \ energy consumption in the irrigation sector in the investigated worst \n(S1-energy)\
    \ (top) and best case (S2-energy) (down) scenarios. \n \nFigure 15: Distribution\
    \ of the energy consumption in the irrigation sector in the investigated worst\
    \ \n(S1-energy) and best (S2-energy) energy scenarios. \n4.4 The irrigation management\
    \ service interface \nA screenshot of the irrigation management service interface\
    \ is provided in Figure 16, where the users \ncan view the daily reference evapotranspiration\
    \ ET0 maps for all of Sweden. Once all the data are \nretrieved from the server,\
    \ the maps can be visualized with time dimension by using the time slider. By\
    \ \nspecifying the field Evapotranspiration cities, the users can also view and\
    \ download daily-based time-\nseries of ET0 and precipitation data for the selected\
    \ locations across all the country (Figure 17). The \nlocations possible to retrieve\
    \ the ET0 and precipitation time-series will appear on the map. The data on \n\
    ET0 and precipitation can be used as starting point for more accurate assessment\
    \ of crop water \nrequirements using the FAO guidelines (Allen et al., 1998).\
    \ Moreover, by assimilating LAI observation \nas described in sections 3.2 and\
    \ 4.1, the current version of the model could be further expanded to \nspecifically\
    \ cover the most irrigated crops in the country providing timely guidelines for\
    \ farmers. By \nintegrating ET0 maps with maps concerning the irrigation areas\
    \ and water resources depth and \navailability, water and energy management agencies\
    \ managers could have a better view of potential \nwater and energy consumption\
    \ from the irrigation sector. The developed interface can provide large-\nscale\
    \ and cost-effective irrigation management services and decision support in both\
    \ developed and \ndeveloping countries, especially in those areas with significant\
    \ water and food security issues.  \n \nFigure 16: Screenshot of the irrigation\
    \ management service interface. \n \nFigure 17: Retrieval of time-series reference\

    \ \n5 Conclusions \nThis study aimed to develop an operational water-food-energy\
    \ nexus system for the irrigation sector in \nSweden, focusing on the interrelationships\
    \ between water and energy requirements for irrigation and \ncorresponding crop\
    \ yield response. The 2018 drought that severely hit Sweden is used as the case\
    \ study. \nThe results are compared with a normal year. The main conclusions from\
    \ this study are the following: \n• \nthe use of Penman-Monteith instead of the\
    \ Hargreaves and Samani equation for estimating the \ncrop reference evapotranspiration\
    \ shows slightly better results in the modelling chain for \nestimating the crop\
    \ yield: 0.11 t/ha difference at Lanna in 2018. Although the higher \nperformances\
    \ of Penman-Monteith, it requires significant more input data as compared to \n\
    Hargreaves and Samani´s model. This demonstrates that the implementation of Hargreaves\
    \ and \nSamani equation provides a good trade-off between accuracy and complexity\
    \ for operational \nservice \n• \nby assimilating the leaf area index from Copernicus\
    \ Global Land Service into the crop model \nthrough optimization, the model presents\
    \ the best results while comparing the simulated crop \nyield with the measured\
    \ crop yield at the Lanna ICOS FLUXNET station \n• \nthe irrigation water productivity\
    \ using the developed model shows better results as compared to \nexisting static\
    \ and non-spatially explicit guidelines both in 2018 and in 2019 \n• \nduring\
    \ the drought year 2018, the developed model showed no irrigation water savings\
    \ as \ncompared to conventional irrigation guidelines. Nevertheless, the conventional\
    \ irrigation \nguidelines show crop yield reductions between 20 to 80% as compared\
    \ to the crop yield \nachieved through the irrigation heights generated by the\
    \ developed model. \n• \nin 2019, most of the water savings ranged between -60%\
    \ (i.e., increased irrigation water volume \nas compared to static guidelines)\
    \ to 95% with crop yield reductions ranging between -5% (i.e., \ncrop yield increase)\
    \ to 70%. Those modelling results align with the previous studies on the \nimplementation\
    \ of large-scale irrigation management services in the USA \n• \nthe modelling\
    \ result shows a significant reduction in crop yield up to 35% due to temperature\
    \ \nstress as compared to ideal case without temperature stress. This justifies\
    \ the implementation of \ntechnologies that can mitigate the negative effects\
    \ of weather extremes (e.g., drought) and \nclimate changes on the water-food-energy\
    \ nexus interrelationships.  \n• \nThe developed platform, based on an open-source\
    \ package for Google Earth®, can be easily \nimplemented to help farmers, and\
    \ water and energy management agencies to better understand \nthe water, energy,\
    \ and food nexus and make informed decisions especially during the occurrence\
    \ \nof extreme events.  \nIn future studies, the proposed model will be extended\
    \ to other key sectors, such as the power and \nindustrial sector, to perform\
    \ optimal allocation of natural resources on large-scale. \nAcknowledgments  \n\

    \ internet of things, monitoring and control \n1 \nINTRODUCTION \nDue to rising\
    \ food demand and a growing human population, agriculture is the primary food\
    \ supplier and the most \nprominent labor user. It is also one of the essential\
    \ areas in a country's economy, according to gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) [1],\
    \ [2]. Water availability is an essential factor in optimizing the growth of crops\
    \ so that water \nscarcity can threaten food security. This reason makes water\
    \ conservation an essential factor in overcoming water \nshortages while increasing\
    \ yields. [3, 4]. Moreover, the development of agricultural technology and more\
    \ efficient \nagricultural management can produce productive crops and quality\
    \ harvests through greenhouse technology. \nDeveloping greenhouses for agriculture\
    \ can increase crop yields and improve water use efficiency [5].  \nAround 3.5%\
    \ of the world's agricultural land uses greenhouse and hydroponic systems to conserve\
    \ water use and \nother benefits such as crop protection and quality yields. A\
    \ greenhouse is a building with a wooden or metal \nfoundation covered with nets\
    \ or transparent material. Since 1960 the greenhouse has evolved from a building\
    \ that \nonly protects plants into a system for studying plant growth in a controlled\
    \ environment [6, 7]. Changes in \nagricultural land usage, lower irrigation water\
    \ output in primary, secondary, and tertiary canals, and global \nmicroclimate\
    \ changes contribute to the rising use of greenhouses in world agriculture [8].\
    \  \nAgricultural ecosystems (soil, nutrients, temperature, humidity, sunlight,\
    \ wind, and air composition) can be adapted \nto the needs of the plants planted\
    \ in greenhouses to extend productive plant life, change planting seasons, \n\
    increase crop yields and improve harvest quality. [9, 10]. Moving crops from their\
    \ natural environment to \ngreenhouses protect plants from weather and microclimate\
    \ uncertainties. On the downside, a greenhouse is a \nplace that can store solar\
    \ heat and requires resources to manage the microclimate according to plant needs,\
    \ \nespecially in countries with tropical climates. [4, 11]. Crop growth problems\
    \ arise in agriculture that depends on rain \nand drought; runoff and erosion\
    \ problems also arise during heavy rains. Water control is needed to meet crop\
    \ \nwater needs while conserving water [12]. The water control system functioned\
    \ as a regulator for water flow \naccording to the plant's needs in its growth\
    \ phase [13, 14]. \nConventional irrigation systems use a uniform amount of water\
    \ to fields from one corner to another during their \ngrowth period regardless\
    \ of the type of plant and its water needs. The result is water-wasting, where\
    \ one side of \nthe land has sufficient water, while the other can have excess\
    \ or lack of water [15]. Therefore, a control system \nknown as an intelligent\
    \ irrigation system is needed to support plants' water needs while saving water.\
    \ The way the \nsystem works, in general, is to adapt to the type of plant and\
    \ then automatically calculate the water needs of the \n657 \n \nIrfan Ardiansah,\

    \ Vol.20, No 3, 2022 -www.engineeringscience.rs \n \nplant and schedule water\
    \ supply based on the plant growth phase [16]. Intelligent irrigation systems\
    \ are suitable for \nuse in a greenhouse because a greenhouse has an enclosed\
    \ structure to reduce or eliminate parameters affecting \nplant growth, such as\
    \ seasons, rainfall, climate change, plant pests and diseases, and environmental\
    \ changes [17, \n18]. \nIntelligent irrigation systems are part of precision agriculture,\
    \ also known as smart farming, which integrates \ninformation technology, communication\
    \ technology, and control technology to automate various agricultural \nactivities\
    \ that humans initially did. With an intelligent irrigation system, the irrigation\
    \ process can run optimally in \nmanaging water to meet the needs of plants [19].\
    \ Intelligent irrigation systems can manage water needs based on \nvarious parameters\
    \ such as microclimate conditions, weather, sunlight, water quality such as acidity\
    \ (pH), turbidity \n(TDS), and electrical conductivity (EC), along with plant\
    \ growth phases through the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. \nAn intelligent\
    \ irrigation system can improve irrigation decisions to achieve water savings\
    \ and increased yields [20–\n22]. \nThe intelligent irrigation system is one of\
    \ the best systems in managing and saving water while maximizing \nharvests; water\
    \ is distributed evenly to each plant according to its needs and minimizes wasted\
    \ water [23]. This \nsystem can also mix nutrients and water and help deliver\
    \ them directly to the root zone, ensuring it is always in \noptimal moist conditions,\
    \ minimizing surface runoff, preventing root rot, and eliminating percolation.\
    \ The advantage \nis increased crop productivity, and better harvest quality also\
    \ ensures optimal water efficiency. Nevertheless, good \nintegration between IoT\
    \ devices, monitoring, control, and data acquisition can be done automatically\
    \ with minimum \nintervention to get an optimal and efficient, intelligent irrigation\
    \ system [24, 25]. \nIn the intelligent irrigation system, the controller can\
    \ process input data, present information, and manage irrigation \nbased on greenhouse\
    \ conditions, especially crop conditions to prevent water deficit. Nevertheless,\
    \ in addition to \nsystem automation, it is necessary to present current and past\
    \ system conditions to users, both plant responses to \nthe system and vice versa.\
    \ This method ensures that water management runs smoothly, and users can study\
    \ \nhistorical data as a reference for the next planting period and ensure optimal\
    \ farming [26–29]. This process \nrequires real-time monitoring, sophisticated\
    \ control systems, and precise instruments. The difference between a \nmonitoring\
    \ system and a control system is that the control system regulates the hardware\
    \ according to conditional \nconstraints. The control system manages the hardware\
    \ and software by defining the output and input parameters \nprecisely. The input\
    \ is microclimate parameters, plant properties, weather conditions, water quality,\
    \ and other \nsensors collect helpful information [30–33]. \nMany articles published\
    \ on IoT focus on agriculture, as discussed by [30, 34]. IoT is one of the best\
    \ inventions of \nthe 21st century in agriculture. In addition, review articles\
    \  [21], [35] discuss IoT opportunities in agriculture or \nintelligent farming\
    \ and how the connection between IoT, data mining, data science, and machine learning\
    \ \nsustainability supports agriculture. [36] describes the automation model for\
    \ monitoring and controlling the \nagricultural sector and predicting information\
    \ based on past data. There are currently no review studies that explore \nthe\
    \ monitoring and control strategy of intelligent irrigation systems in greenhouses,\
    \ necessitating the formation of \nintelligent irrigation system review articles\
    \ that focus on integrating various monitoring and control materials. As a \n\
    result, this study will cover intelligent irrigation system monitoring and control\
    \ mechanisms and their relevance to \ngreenhouses and irrigation. \nThis study\
    \ aims to classify the results of previous research, identify the results, and\
    \ bridge them with future trends \nto identify future research. Chapter 2 discusses\
    \ research methodology, and Chapter 3 discusses various irrigation \nmethods used\
    \ by intelligent irrigation systems. In contrast, Chapter 4 discusses monitoring\
    \ and controlling \nstrategies for IoT and then continues to Chapter 5, discussing\
    \ the integration of artificial intelligence. The last \nchapter discusses future\
    \ directions and trends in intelligent irrigation. \n2 REVIEW METHODOLOGY \nThe\
    \ methodology applied in selecting published literature with the theme of intelligent\
    \ farming focuses on the topic \nof intelligent irrigation systems and their control\
    \ systems by using an extensive search on several online libraries of \nmultidisciplinary\
    \ journals as Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Springer, MDPI, and IOP, as well\
    \ as online \nengineering libraries as Agricola and IEEE Xplore. This technique\
    \ produces many research articles relevant to \nintelligent farming and irrigation\
    \ systems and their relationship to monitoring and control. That is why it is\
    \ essential \nto check the reputation of the publisher's journal before using\
    \ the article through the SCOPUS and ScimagoJR \nwebsites. This review's selection\
    \ of relevant articles emphasizes the latest journal articles in the last eleven\
    \ years \n(2011 - 2021); it can be seen in Figure 1a that in 2020 there was a\
    \ surge in articles discussing monitoring, control, \nand artificial intelligence\
    \ in agriculture. Other conditions are that all articles must be published in\
    \ SCOPUS indexed \njournals and conference proceedings. As shown in Figure 1b,\
    \ which shows the percentage of articles indexed by \nSCOPUS with articles with\
    \ Quartile 1 dominating research in this field means that the research is internationally\
    \ \nrecognized and has the best quality content. All articles used are smart farming,\
    \ intelligent irrigation system, and \nprecision agriculture. Articles are carefully\
    \ selected by reading and summarizing them to ensure continuity of ideas.  \n\

    \ \npositions \n3 TYPES OF IRRIGATION \nPlants need water at regular intervals\
    \ to grow and develop; in agriculture, this watering technique is called \nirrigation.\
    \ Irrigation has two methods, namely conventional and modern. Conventional agriculture\
    \ usually uses rain \nand surface irrigation to irrigate its land [37, 38]. The\
    \ problem is how to predict rain accurately, and surface \nirrigation does not\
    \ continuously irrigate the entire land with a uniform discharge. Surface irrigation,\
    \ classified as \nconventional irrigation, works by distributing water from springs\
    \ or rivers to the ground surface following gravity; \nmonitoring is done manually\
    \ by looking at the water level without IoT and automation [37].  \nDeveloping\
    \ countries generally use surface irrigation, for example, Indonesia. It uses\
    \ it to irrigate paddy fields by \nconstructing furrows that connect water sources\
    \ with rice fields and irrigate them. However, this method requires a \nlevel\
    \ ground surface to ensure adequate water distribution [39]. On the other hand,\
    \ surface irrigation results in high \nlevels of water loss due to evaporation,\
    \ uncontrolled water discharge, and percolation, which can reduce soil \nnutrient\
    \ levels resulting in sub-optimal crop yields [37]. There are two commonly used\
    \ surface irrigations: (1) \nFurrow irrigation is interpreted as water flowing\
    \ through small furrows made on the land slope. Water enters the soil \nfrom the\
    \ bottom and sides of the furrow and moves laterally and downwards to moisten\
    \ the soil and simultaneously \ncarry dissolved salts, fertilizers, and herbicides\
    \ [40]. Good tillage with uniform slopes can give better results from \nthis method.\
    \ Furrow irrigation is suitable for various soils, slopes, and crops especially\
    \ row crops. Crops that will be \ndamaged if water covers the stems or crowns\
    \ should use furrow irrigation [40, 41]. Furrow irrigation is also suitable \n\
    for tree crops. In the early stages of tree planting, using one furrow beside\
    \ the tree row may be sufficient, but as the \ntree grows, creating two or more\
    \ new furrows is necessary to provide sufficient water [42]. (2) Flooding Irrigation\
    \ is \nan irrigation method commonly used to provide water in lowland rice cultivation\
    \ and generally, water carried out \ncontinuously. Flooding is carried out continuously\
    \ at the same height throughout plant growth, starting from planting \nuntil several\
    \ days before harvest [43]. The use of flooding irrigation depends on sufficient\
    \ water to flood the land \nsurface with 10 cm of water. The disadvantage is inhibiting\
    \ plant growth and water wastage [44]. Because flooding \nirrigation uses water\
    \ excessively, flooding irrigation evolved into intermittent irrigation by flooding\
    \ and drying the \nland alternately from planting season until one week before\
    \ the flowering. The water level is maintained at 3 to 5 \ncm during flowering.\
    \ Giving water this way can reduce water usage up to 30 percent without reducing\
    \ crop yields \n[43–45] \n Modern irrigation offers uniform discharge for each\
    \ plant, including nutrients and saving water, mainly when \nplanting is carried\
    \ out in a greenhouse, making it easier to monitor water quantity and quality\
    \ and regulate water \nsupply schedules [46, 47]. The amount of water delivered\
    \ is determined by the plant's demands, irrigation method, \nand type of growing\
    \ medium. The choice of irrigation method influences the type of nutrients, the\
    \ number of \nnutrients, the rate of infiltration, evaporation, water absorption,\
    \ and drainage [12]. \nModern irrigation uses less water and is more efficient\
    \ than conventional irrigation, and this method saves more \nenergy and water.\
    \ It is an effective method for use in areas where water is scarce or has irregular\
    \ rains. This \nmethod allows farmers to cultivate crops consistently, creating\
    \ a reliable food supply [3, 11]. Modern irrigation relies \non water from wells,\
    \ lakes, and reservoirs stored in water tanks and then irrigates plants using\
    \ gravity or water \npumps [12]. The method of giving water is even more specific,\
    \ such as spraying water through a sprinkler or \ndripping water through an emitter\
    \ onto plants. [39] developed an automatic irrigation data communication system\

    \ Vol.20, No 3, 2022 -www.engineeringscience.rs \n \nthrough the General Packet\
    \ Radio Service (GPRS) and Zigbee module and built a microprocessor-based gateway\
    \ \nto better control water discharge with water efficiency than conventional\
    \ irrigation systems, with the difference \nbetween conventional and modern irrigation\
    \ can be seen in Figure 2. \n \nFig 2. Types of irrigation \n3.1 \nSprinkler Irrigation\
    \ \nFarmers use sprinkler irrigation to mimic precipitation patterns. They used\
    \ small sprinkler nozzles connected to an \nextensive piping system to ensure\
    \ comprehensive irrigation coverage and used pumps to spray high-pressure \nwater\
    \ onto the air [48]. The advantage of sprinkler is that it minimizes runoff, is\
    \ suitable for all types of soil, and has \na water-saving rate of between 30\
    \ - 50%. Sprinkles can be mixed with fertilizer solutions and used in close \n\
    cropping and high plant population [28]. However, this method has high operating\
    \ costs for cleaning sprinkler \nnozzles and maintaining high-pressure pumps and\
    \ pipes. In addition, sprinkler irrigation is unsuitable for use in \nwindy areas\
    \ because wind gusts and evapotranspiration cause high water loss rates. Moreover,\
    \ regular \nmaintenance of the pipes and their connections to avoid leaks or clogs\
    \ can reduce the water spray pressure, \nreducing water distribution to the plants\
    \ [37, 48]. \n3.2 \nDrip Irrigation \nIn drip irrigation, the water source moistens\
    \ the soil or planting media through the holes in the pipes and flows \nthrough\
    \ a hose connected to the emitter with low pressure. The focus of water droplets\
    \ is a small part of the soil or \ngrowing medium that covers the root zone by\
    \ adjusting it to get water droplets [49]. Drip irrigation is the most \nefficient\
    \ irrigation because it can distribute water and nutrients simultaneously to the\
    \ root zone, which results in \nbetter nutrient uptake. Due to the circulation\
    \ of water in the roots through the capillary principle, the pores of the \nsoil\
    \ or planting medium remain dry so that air circulation is maintained and soil\
    \ moisture is at field capacity. \nProduces a root zone capable of breathing more\
    \ intensely during its growth cycle [25, 37, 50]. \nDrip irrigation uses dripping\
    \ water delivered at a rate of between 2 - 20 liters per hour. The application\
    \ of this \nmethod is to place an emitter on each plant. It is suitable for use\
    \ on vegetables and fruit, but farmers usually only \nconsider high-value plants\
    \ because the investment value is relatively high [37, 49]. This method supports\
    \ various \ntypes of soil by adjusting the speed of water application. Hefty porous\
    \ sandy soils need a fast drip-rate; conversely, \nclay soil needs a slow drip\
    \ rate to avoid water logging and runoff [25, 37]. \n4 MONITORING AND CONTROLLING\
    \ STRATEGIES \nA total of 30 papers were used to examine the irrigation system's\
    \ monitoring and control method. These \npublications provide ways for regulating\
    \ irrigation by employing sensors to measure changes in microclimate, water \n\
    quality, and soil moisture values. The paper's distribution is represented in\
    \ Figure 3 below. \nAn effective and efficient monitoring system is needed to\
    \ collect different plant growth parameters. Monitoring in an \nintelligent irrigation\
    \ system involves collecting data representing the latest microclimate data and\
    \ water and soil \nconditions around the irrigation area through a microcontroller\
    \ connected to the IoT [51], shown in Figure 4. The \ndevelopment of real-time\
    \ monitoring devices was made possible due to the rapid development of microcontrollers\
    \ \nand sensors, low-cost hardware (Arduino UNO, ESP8266, Raspberry Pi), and fast\
    \ internet, which enhanced the \nperformance of monitoring and control systems\
    \ [17, 52]. There are two types of internet connections: wired and \nwireless;\
    \ Wired connections make the internet connection stable, but with fixed hardware\
    \ location. Wireless \nconnection makes flexible hardware placement but has signal\
    \ interference [53]. \n \n660 \nIrfan Ardiansah, et al. - An overview of IOT based\

    \ \n \n \n \nFig 3. Distribution of papers on monitoring and controlling strategies\
    \ \n \nFig 4. Block diagram of IoT based Smart Farming \nAll devices and sensors\
    \ are connected directly to the server via a cabling system in a wired connection\
    \ case. This \nsystem is only effective when a few parameters are measured and\
    \ use a small greenhouse; it is crucial because \nthe more connected devices,\
    \ the more cables are used. So, the wired greenhouse system is not suitable for\
    \ large \nor commercial greenhouses. The advantage is that data transactions are\
    \ safe and have minimal interference [51, \n53, 54]. WSN is the latest technology\
    \ in intelligent farming that can be expanded and scaled up without modifying\
    \ \nthe greenhouse infrastructure. Its wireless form makes it easy to receive\
    \ and transmit data between nodes using \nlow-power frequencies. Unfortunately,\
    \ interference and signal loss are common problems because of the high \nfrequency\
    \ in the air. However, the increase in greenhouse size, the number of parameters,\
    \ sensors variety, node \nsize, and devices distant is not a problem because an\
    \ additional WSN only needs to be attached to an existing \nnetwork. Another advantage\
    \ is Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) technology, wirelessly connected sensor nodes\
    \ \nnetwork to sense and send various data, and extensible [36, 54, 55]. \nThe\
    \ implementation of WSN in agriculture itself is extensive, with sensors, RFID,\
    \ cameras, drones, and cloud \nservices connected seamlessly for data acquisition\
    \ and transmission. Cloud computing serves data collection and \nanalysis to generate\
    \ visualizations, decision support, and commands; system users (farmers or researchers)\

    \ a control system can manipulate several irrigation parameters, like air circulation,\
    \ air temperature, \nrelative humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation [58–60].\
    \ A technology that can analyze the surface temperature \nof agricultural land\
    \ without touching it using thermal imaging was proposed by [61] to determine\
    \ which areas of \nland are in dire need of water because the non-uniformity of\
    \ soil moisture can inhibit spinach growth. Studies by \n[56, 62–64] also state\
    \ that it is possible to use thermal imaging for nurseries, forecasting crop yields,\
    \ pest and \ndisease disturbances, maintenance of agricultural machinery, and\
    \ irrigation scheduling. \n4.1 \nMicroclimate based  \nMonitoring and controlling\
    \ the microclimate in the greenhouse is a critical factor to account for water\
    \ loss due to \nevaporation. Air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation,\
    \ and wind speed need precision measurements to \nmeet crop water requirements\
    \ [30, 65]. The Raspberry Pi, various Arduino models, connected to WSN, and cloud\
    \ \nservers are popular hardware. WSN implementation is an efficient way to interconnect\
    \ various sensors placed far \napart in the greenhouse. The system performs accurate\
    \ system monitoring, collects data, and presents charts, and \ncontrol devices\
    \ are activated, referring to predefined threshold values compared with real-time\
    \ data [30, 36, 66]. \n[59] presented a technique for evaluating microclimate\
    \ parameters in two tropical greenhouses before planting \ntomatoes using LoRa\
    \ wireless and IoT sensors. The comfort ratio model (CftM) and scenario analysis\
    \ show that \nenvironmental conditions can adapt to the growth phase of tomato\
    \ plants. The microclimate before and during \nplanting was analyzed using the\
    \ Simulink app. Also, a study by [67] showed that a microclimate parameter \n\
    measurement device in a greenhouse could yield comprehensive data for temperature,\
    \ humidity, CO2 levels, \nlighting levels, soil moisture, acidity, irrigation\
    \ water conductivity, and airflow velocity. In winter, the greenhouse \nbehavior\
    \ was studied by [68] using fuzzy logic control (FLC) due to uncertainty in the\
    \ greenhouse environment. The \nfuzzy set was developed based on experts in greenhouse\
    \ thermal behavior. Fuzzy control manages decisions \nbased on weather forecasts\
    \ and user interactions. [54] also took a similar approach to measure leaf temperature,\
    \ \nair temperature, and soil moisture using three connected sensors to assess\
    \ the level of microclimate in a \ngreenhouse and use Zigbee to transmit sensor\
    \ data. \nControlling the microclimate in the greenhouse by using fan ventilation\
    \ and fan-pad ventilation can also be an \noption. This forced ventilation can\
    \ prevent plants from overheating even if the greenhouse does not use an \nevaporative\
    \ cooling system. Greenhouses can produce good harvests in the spring, and the\
    \ data show a \nrelationship between the greenhouse microclimate and water uptake\
    \ that minimizes drainage [69]. [70] built a \nmonitoring system using an open-source\
    \ platform to collect microclimate variables (air temperature, humidity, soil\
    \ \ntemperature, and soil moisture). Communication between devices uses Bluetooth\
    \ and obtain electricity supply \nthrough solar panels. [71] has proposed improvements\
    \ to the greenhouse IoT-based system by adding color \nspectrum monitoring using\
    \ a camera system to get photos of the plant canopies translated into color (RGB,\
    \ HSL, \nand brightness), plant texture, thermal (plant temperature), and plant\
    \ morphology. The system works with NFT to \nirrigate lettuce plants in the greenhouse,\
    \ automatically recording data and identifying plant stress levels. \n4.2 \nWater\
    \ Quality-based \nWater quality safety is a challenge in the 21st century because\
    \ of the many pollutants, which are predominantly \nartificial such as environmental\
    \ damage, packaging waste, or chemical waste. Overexploitation of natural \nresources,\
    \ rapid industrial development, and agricultural expansion are the leading causes\
    \ of the problem. [72]. \nWater quality is affected by direct and indirect sources\
    \ of pollution such as sewage, factory waste, agricultural and \nurban runoff.\
    \ The need for human involvement in water quality management is essential [73,\
    \ 74]. Water quality \nmanagement is a way to regularly collect water quality\
    \ information in a location to find out its current condition. \nWater quality\
    \ management aims to measure water quality variables such as microbial content\
    \ physical and \nchemical properties, provide an early warning system and provide\
    \ decision support for further treatment [75, 76]. \nWSN and IoT are inevitable\
    \ to manage variables over a wide area for larger areas such as lakes or oceans.\
    \ \n[75] has proposed a system that assesses irrigation water quality with IoT\
    \ by detecting potential hydrogen (pH), \nelectrical conductivity (EC), turbidity,\
    \ and salinity in real-time using different sensors to maintain plant health status.\
    \ \nAlso, [77] undertook a study to build a continuous water quality monitoring\
    \ system using open-source hardware \nand low-cost sensors. Preliminary results\
    \ show that the device can produce accurate results at a lower cost than \nexisting\
    \ technologies with proper calibration. \n4.3 \nSoil Moisture-based \nFarmers\
    \ need to consider soil conditions because moist soil means the plant still has\
    \ enough water for growth [11]. \nMonitoring soil moisture content becomes vital\
    \ as the basis for irrigation scheduling. Raspberry Pi and Arduino \nUNO have\
    \ commonly used devices in developing low-cost IoT-based soil moisture management\
    \ interfaced using \nvarious sensors [30, 60, 75]. The sensor used is a capacitive\
    \ type and transmits electricity without conduction; it \ncan measure soil moisture\
    \ changes by planting them into the soil and measuring its volumetric water content.\
    \ The \nTime Domain Reflectometry (TDR) sensor is a more precise option for measuring\
    \ soil moisture, consisting of two \nmetal rods embedded at the depth at which\
    \ the humidity is to be measured. Works by sending pulses to the soil \nand then\
    \ calculating the response of the soil as soil moisture content. Due to its good\
    \ quality in measuring soil \nmoisture, this TDR sensor is quite expensive to\
    \ use in large-scale greenhouses [78, 79]. \n662 \nIrfan Ardiansah, et al. - An\

    \ trends \nand challenges \n \nJournal of Applied Engineering Science - Vol.20,\
    \ No 3, 2022 - www.engineeringscience.rs \n \n \n[80] proposed a soil moisture\
    \ control system for measuring water content in soil at different soil depths,\
    \ soil types, \nand air temperatures using various sensors integrated with Arduino\
    \ UNO. The ESP8266 wireless module is then \nlinked to the Arduino to upload data\
    \ to the cloud server. A similar study by [81] succeeded in developing an IoT-\n\
    based field control system integrated with cloud-based data monitoring and analysis.\
    \ The analysis results help \npredict water consumption for better crop yields.\
    \ [82] approach to controlling soil moisture uses wireless technology \nutilizing\
    \ GSM networks and push notifications to automate water supply for plants. A system\
    \ proposed by [83] \npresents an Android application-based humidity monitoring\
    \ method, where an Arduino interface sensor connected \nto Wi-Fi sends state data\
    \ to a smartphone. Another monitoring approach is carried out by [60] using IoT\
    \ and soil \nnutrient sensors to detect nutrient adequacy for plants. The decision\
    \ support system then receives the data \nparameters and processes them as a farming\
    \ decision. \n[84] implemented a user-friendly system, representing the soil moisture\
    \ level with colors. These colors have helped \nfarmers visually identify and\
    \ manage soil moisture content without understanding the values displayed. Likewise,\
    \ \n[85] proposed a soil nutrient control system that can manage the concentration\
    \ of nutrients in the soil by planting \nsensors in the soil to map nutrient variability.\
    \ Also, [86] developed an innovative device that uses a camera-\nintegrated drone\
    \ for field mapping. Images are analyzed to generate soil moisture and nutrient\
    \ values and use \nthem for irrigation planning and scheduling. \n5 ARTIFICIAL\
    \ INTELLIGENCE IN IRRIGATION SYSTEM \nArtificial intelligence in intelligent irrigation\

    \ decision support systems, fuzzy logic models, and artificial neural network\
    \ models that can take \ndecisions automatically in response to changes in field\
    \ conditions. The distribution of articles based on the theme \nof artificial\
    \ intelligence is shown in Figure 5 below. \n \nFig 5. Distribution of papers\
    \ on artificial intelligence in irrigation system \nArtificial intelligence (AI)\
    \ is a branch of science concerned with creating machines that can understand\
    \ and act in \nthe same way as humans. Machine learning is a burgeoning sub-domain\
    \ of AI that explores patterns in large \namounts of data [58, 87]. The popularity\
    \ of machine learning is due to more and more data generated by various \napplications\
    \ and IoT. The system can generate helpful information for making decisions or\
    \ becoming input to other \nsystems by studying data patterns. The need for agricultural\
    \ products is directly proportional to the increase in the \nearth's population,\
    \ so agroindustry and innovative agriculture technology get the spotlight in the\
    \ industrial revolution \n4.0 [16, 46].  \nAI has the potential to solve nonlinear,\
    \ multiparameter, and time-varying problems in managing intelligent irrigation\
    \ \nsystems. By applying AI algorithms to specific problem areas, the system tries\
    \ to imitate human logic, thought \nprocesses, and decision making through the\
    \ application of Fuzzy Logic, Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest \nNeighbor\
    \ (kNN), Decision Tree and Random Forest by using past data to feed AI and provides\
    \ new knowledge to \nthe system [58, 61]. [88] has researched by applying different\
    \ regression and machine learning algorithms to \nseveral sensor datasets to develop\
    \ weekly irrigation plan predictions. \nA study implementing an intelligent irrigation\
    \ system shows many advantages, such as minimizing soil stress to \nchanging microclimate\
    \ conditions, efficient water use, and reducing human interaction. This solar\
    \ panel-powered \nsystem has a Sensor Layer, Central Layer, and Valve Layer running\
    \ together. The function of the Central Layer is \nto control the process that\
    \ produces input (sensor layer detects moisture content) and output (valve layer\
    \ opens to \nprovide water). The system also enables fertilizers and pesticides\
    \ by calibrating other sensors according to the \nrequired input [89]. \n5.1 \n\

    \ where the decision support system (DSS) comes in [76, 90]. DSS \nhas a framework\
    \ that can represent complex systems with an efficient and robust approach that\
    \ is easy to \nunderstand generates additional information and new perspectives\
    \ to improve the quality of irrigation management. \nDSS is an information system\
    \ that analyzes data and represents it to make decisions quickly. The primary\
    \ purpose \nof DSS is to support and improve decision-making [28, 76]. Figure\
    \ 6 shows a DSS logic diagram that consists of \nfour connected components: Database,\
    \ model base, knowledge base, and user interface. \n \nFig 6. Block diagram of\
    \ Decision Support System \nThe Database in irrigation DSS collects and manages\
    \ air temperature, relative humidity, crop water requirements, \nirrigation records,\
    \ and solar radiation. The knowledge base has three parts: fact base, rule base,\
    \ and inference \nengine used to analyze data, solve uncertain problems and draw\
    \ conclusions. The model base creates optimization \nmodels, integrates numerous\
    \ decision models, analyzes them to create crop water simulations, and offers\
    \ farmers \nirrigation scheduling. [71, 76]. \nDeveloping and utilizing a decision\
    \ support system in irrigation management is essential for scheduling water \n\
    delivery based on crop needs. The main problem is how moist the soil is and how\
    \ much water the plants need \nbased on the type of plant, planting technique,\
    \ availability of water, amount of fertilizer applied, microclimate \nconditions,\
    \ and stage of plant development [91]. With DSS, farmers can manage their farms\
    \ daily using plant \ndatabases and water supply strategies to perform irrigation\
    \ calculations and fertilization adjustments to obtain \noptimal yields. There\
    \ are times when a system has a crop suggestion feature that advises farmers to\
    \ plant a crop \nthat yields the highest profit under certain constraints [92].\
    \ \nThe problem is that the characteristics of crops, soils, and microclimatic\
    \ conditions in agriculture are dynamic and \nnot linear, varying with seasons.\
    \ Therefore, setting the proper irrigation schedule will directly influence plant\
    \ growth. \nThe core of DSS includes monitoring different parameters using different\
    \ sensors and configuring their rules. DSS \nmanages sensor readings stored in\
    \ the cloud to adjust irrigation scheduling to maintain irrigation system efficiency\
    \ \nroutinely [76, 90]. An intelligent irrigation DSS must have the ability to\
    \ adapt to changes in transient and spatial \nplant dynamics, such as uncertainties\
    \ in microclimate conditions, nutrient requirements, and environmental \nchanges.\
    \ Researchers have proposed many studies on DSS applied to irrigation systems,\
    \ such as [93], who \ndeveloped an automated irrigation system using a single\
    \ lateral pipe covering a large area to manage water at \nvarying speeds. \nSprinkler\
    \ irrigation developed by [94] uses an automatic linear moving sprinkler system\
    \ with WSN based DSS. The \nsystem can adapt to crop types, irrigation requirements,\
    \ and planting locations to command individual sprinkler \nheads how and where\
    \ water must be applied. Similarly, [76] built a DSS integrated fertigation simulator\
    \ for \ndesigning drip or sprinkler irrigation for on-site olives and grapes farms.\
    \ The system has a database, simulation \nmodel, and user interface that shows\
    \ the ranking of design alternatives through multicriteria decision-making \n\
    (MCDM). The scope of the calculation of this system includes land analysis, water\
    \ requirements, and plant \nnutrition. \n664 \nIrfan Ardiansah, et al. - An overview\

    \ model is a data-driven technique with easy-to-understand logical rules. [50,\
    \ 68, 95] proposed a fuzzy \nlogic-based irrigation scheduling by enforcing control\
    \ rules to microclimate data, evaporation data, and soil \nconditions. The process\
    \ flow can be seen in Figure 7. \n[96] succeeded in building and testing a rule-based\
    \ Fuzzy Logic application to assess the water stress index of \nplants in a greenhouse;\
    \ the application accepts three input variables, namely air temperature, solar\
    \ radiation, and \nwater pressure. Results show that Fuzzy Logic eliminates the\
    \ need for air aerodynamic resistance data, making \nthis system more straightforward.\
    \ \n[95] developed fuzzy logic using the LabVIEW application to create a graphical\
    \ user interface (GUI) for a drip \nirrigation control system in a greenhouse.\
    \ The input parameters used are air temperature and soil moisture and \nprocess\
    \ them using fuzzy rules to produce information of irrigation duration. The test\
    \ results show that fuzzy logic \ncontrol can efficiently estimate irrigation\
    \ schedules in an automated system, and greenhouse managers can \nmonitor real-time\
    \ data and devices that are easy to manage, even for ordinary users. [97] research\
    \ also designed \nan irrigation control based on fuzzy logic applying the Penman-Monteith\
    \ equation for rice cultivation with a \nparameter model in the difference between\
    \ actual and target evapotranspiration following the plant growth phase. \nEach\
    \ phase has its water requirement. The research aims to develop an intelligent\
    \ system that helps irrigation \nmanagement and produces a system that can work\
    \ better than conventional irrigation systems. The results showed \nthat the control\
    \ system saves water, improves irrigation performance, improves crop quality,\
    \ and saves labor.  \n \nFig 7. Fuzzy Logic-based Intelligent Irrigation System\
    \ \nAlso, [50] developed a fuzzy logic system that evaluates the irrigation system\
    \ based on the variable availability of \nirrigation water during the planting\
    \ period on the level of farmers' income which results in the efficiency of the\
    \ \nirrigation system performance. To assist in making decisions on irrigation\
    \ distribution. [98] conducted similar \nresearch by developing an intelligent\
    \ irrigation system to turn on and off the irrigation system using input \nparameters\
    \ of water use, water and air temperature, and soil moisture. They implement WSN-based\
    \ monitoring to \nsend data on fuzzy logic, which then performs irrigation scheduling\
    \ by applying fuzzy rules. The system can \nmaintain soil moisture content at\
    \ the specified limit to save the use of electrical energy, water, and runoff.\
    \ \n5.3 \nArtificial Neural Network Model \nOne application of AI in agriculture\
    \ is Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) algorithms, which can predict using elements\
    \ \ninterconnected and work in parallel. The advantage of neural networks is that\
    \ they can be trained, for example, to \ndistinguish grass from rice or to compare\
    \ tomatoes to peppers [71]. The ANN system can predict with high \naccuracy when\
    \ fed reliable and precise data. A trained ANN is considered an expert in a category\
    \ of data. This \nexpert can then predict possible future conditions and prepare\
    \ what-if scenarios [73, 87]. Other advantages of ANN \nare (1) Adaptive learning,\
    \ the ability to learn and carry out tasks based on the data provided, (2) Self-organization,\
    \ \nthe system can independently compile and build information representations\
    \ during the learning process, and (3) \nReal-time operations, computations are\
    \ carried out in parallel, so it is faster to get calculation results [99]. \n\
    The ANN model is a simple model consisting of three primary neurons distributed\
    \ in the input layer, multiples of the \nhidden layer, and the output layer. ANN\
    \ development requires necessary basic steps, namely datasets, ANN \nmodel training\
    \ data, and ANN model test data for evaluation. Using quality data, the ANN model\
    \ has a mechanism \nfor self-study and solving complex problems. Input neurons\
    \ receive parameters, then hidden neurons perform \n665 \n \nIrfan Ardiansah,\

    \ neurons send signals to other network layers; and interconnect neurons using\
    \ linear and \nnonlinear functions [26, 87, 99, 100]. \nThe following Figure 8\
    \ shows the ANN process flow. In general, the use of ANN includes problem-solving\
    \ in system \noptimization, process control, pattern classification, forecasting,\
    \ and prediction. The main components of an ANN \nmodel consist of neuron nodes,\
    \ a hidden layer containing weights between parameters and distribution rules\
    \ to \ngenerate information for learning rules and independent learning skills\
    \ through experience. There are two types of \nANN models based on their input\
    \ choices: feed-forward and feed-backward networks [99]. \n \nFig 8. The flow\
    \ of feed-forward artificial neurons \nEvapotranspiration is essential information\
    \ that needs to be known to optimize plant growth, especially in water \nmanagement\
    \ and sustainable irrigation systems. Knowledge of the parameters of air temperature,\
    \ relative \nhumidity, wind speed, hours of sunshine, and latitude can optimize\
    \ the management of ET0 in a greenhouse [97]. \nANN research on intelligent irrigation\
    \ systems is applied to scheduling and irrigation discharge to achieve savings\
    \ \nin irrigation water use. [87] conducted a study to estimate the value of soil\
    \ moisture in rice farming land using \nminimal micro and macro climate data by\
    \ applying two ANN models. The first model predicts the value of ET0 \nusing the\
    \ minimum, maximum and average air temperature variables. The second model does\
    \ the same thing but \nuses air temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation.\
    \ The test results show that both models produce reliable and \naccurate soil\
    \ moisture estimates. \nA study by [101] has developed an ANN model to calculate\
    \ evapotranspiration (ET0). After testing, they concluded \nthat the ANN model\
    \ predicts evapotranspiration better than the conventional ET0 equation. Similarly,\
    \ [90] \ndeveloped an ANN to calculate ET0 and compared it with the Penman-FAO\
    \ equation and Penman-Monteith model \nusing four and six microclimate variables\
    \ as inputs. The test indicates that the three models provide accurate \nresults\
    \ using six input parameters. In contrast, the test results with four parameters\
    \ show that only the ANN model \ncan accurately predict the ET0 value. This research\
    \ shows that building an ANN model is possible even with limited \nmicroclimate\
    \ data.  \nIn addition, irrigation control system automation was also proposed\
    \ by [102] using the ANN cluster and closed-loop \ncontrol, which resulted in\
    \ better performance than time-based irrigation control. However, they did not\
    \ provide \ninformation regarding the irrigation method used and the percentage\
    \ of water savings. [100] developed an \nintelligent irrigation system for evapotranspiration\
    \ using the ANN model and a photovoltaic system to predict \nirrigation scheduling\
    \ based on cropping moisture distribution data; this study reported better daily\
    \ water and \nelectrical energy savings also better crop yields. The application\
    \ of ANN in irrigation water management has also \ndiscussed prediction of water\
    \ salinity, water quality, rain runoff, and forecasting of surface irrigation\
    \ infiltration,  \n[73] proposed two ANN models to predict Biochemical Oxygen\
    \ Demand (BOD) and Dissolved Oxygen (DO) for \nirrigation water originating from\
    \ rivers; the conclusion is that water quality management in other areas can also\
    \ use \nthis ANN model. Similarly, [103] uses the ANN model to design an intelligent\
    \ system to manage water systems for \nagriculture and fisheries. [104] explained\
    \ that the greenhouse environment has dynamic and complex \ncharacteristics, making\
    \ it difficult to use conventional control methods as a solution. Radial Basis\
    \ Function Neural \nNetworks (RBF) algorithm and nonlinear adaptive controllers\
    \ become solutions to control greenhouse microclimate. \n[74] discusses the use\
    \ of ANN in drip irrigation systems to predict the distribution of subsurface\
    \ irrigation water. \nThe development of the ANN is to model the continuous wetting\
    \ pattern after the water droplets from the emitter \ntouch the ground surface.\

    \ of the latest IoT technologies for environmental conditions monitoring, data-driven\
    \ \ncontrol, and artificial intelligence. Nowadays, there is an increase in research\
    \ that develops techniques and models \nfor developing irrigation control systems.\
    \ The trend is due to the emergence of various sensors and controls on the \n\
    market; this provides vast opportunities for the development of precision agriculture,\
    \ especially for making \nintelligent predictions of agricultural processes such\
    \ as crop yields, crop water requirements, and microclimate \nconditions. Researchers\
    \ also need to explore other factors that influence irrigation scheduling planning,\
    \ especially \nin large agricultural areas, because researchers generally conduct\
    \ studies on a laboratory scale. Research from \ndifferent perspectives will enrich\
    \ intelligent irrigation systems and result in inaccurate predictions that can\
    \ advise \nfarmers regarding their farming activities and notify them when anomalies\
    \ occur. \nFurthermore, researchers need to test various control systems in the\
    \ irrigation systems discussed, focus on \nadaptive control, and combine it with\
    \ real-time monitoring. It is essential to build systems that can adapt to dynamic\
    \ \nparameters of microclimate, soil, and plant. At the same time, ensure the\

    \ scarcity. \n7 CONCLUSION \nLimited water has become the biggest challenge for\
    \ farmers, and efficiency must solve water scarcity in irrigation \nmanagement.\
    \ The main objective is to control the amount and frequency of irrigation so that\
    \ the amount of water \nreceived by plants is sufficient to keep the root zone\

    \ system must be able to provide recommendations \naccording to the conditions\

    Get rights and content Highlights • A novel water-heat coupling model for water-saving
    irrigated rice fields was proposed. • Account for the drying-wetting soil water
    in the rc calculation and model deduction. • The model didn''t consider the complex
    process of crop growth. • Water and heat components at hourly and daily scales
    were simulated successively. • The model was quite satisfactory in simulating
    various water and heat components. Abstract It is necessary to quantify the hydrothermal
    processes by develop a water-heat coupling model in rice fields where the transfer
    between water and energy is dramatically violent, under the circumstance that
    water-saving irrigation (WSI) was widely used in rice paddy due to the increasing
    water scarcity. Based on the theory of energy and water balance, considering the
    interaction of impedance near the ground, a simplified holistic recursive model
    of water-heat coupling was proposed in the soil–plant–atmosphere continuum (SPAC)
    system at hourly and daily scales, and the parameters were fitted based on water
    and energy balance components measured in WSI rice fields. The model, takes various
    soil moisture conditions into consideration, integrates all the terms in the surface
    energy balance and the water balance with conventional meteorological data as
    inputs. Additionally, the model accounts for the specific drying-wetting cycles
    condition for WSI rice field in the calculation of the canopy resistance (rc)
    and the recursive process. Variations in crop growth and meteorology were also
    considered. The results showed that the model performed well in simulating the
    water and heat fluxes, and temperature profiles during the growth of the rice.
    This is encouraging for modelling the response of hydrothermal process to drying-wetting
    cycles or irrigation regimes, which is help for improving the water use efficiency
    in rice field. Meanwhile, this study indicates that the systemic model is efficient
    and useful for a better understanding the interaction between hydrological and
    energy processes in the WSI rice ecosystem. Previous article in issue Next article

    process dominates many processes in the physics of land-surface, including field
    water, heat, radiation balance, farmland seepage, solute transport, variations
    of soil water and heat, evaporation and transpiration, soil and canopy heat storage,
    leaf and canopy stomatal resistance and plant growth (Harlan, 1973; Bayard and
    Stahli, 2005; Zhou et al., 2008; Li et al., 2013), which is usually developed
    for the soil–plant–atmosphere continuum (SPAC) system. Such information is of
    great significance in guiding the agricultural irrigation practice and understanding
    the interaction between water status and energy fluxes (Zhang et al., 2013; Wang
    et al., 2014, 2017). Many researchers described energy and water transport between
    the land surface and the adjacent atmosphere (Baldocchi, 1992; Steduto and Hsiao,
    1998; Wilson et al., 2000; Baldocchi et al., 2001; Lee et al., 2002; Shrestha
    et al., 2014). Efforts were done to improve the performance in simulating the
    hydrothermal coupling processes, to quantify the utilization of water and the
    distribution of energy. Recently, researchers are interested in modeling water
    status and heat fluxes components at various temporal and spatial scales. Generally,
    there are several kind of models that were used to describe the relationship between
    water and heat, the single-layer "big leaf" model based on Penman-Monteith formula
    (Monteith, 1965; Noilhan and Planton, 1989), the double-layer model proposed by
    Shuttleworth and Wallace (Shuttleworth and Wallace, 1985; Sellers, 1986; Ács et
    al., 1991), and the multi-layer model optimized by Kustas et al. (1996), Kim and
    Entekhabi (1998), Oltchev et al. (1996) and others. Based on the coupling mechanism
    of water and energy, a number of hydrothermal processes have been coupled and
    tested in hydrological models, such as the water and energy budget-based distributed
    hydrological model (WEB-DHM), the arctic hydrological and thermal process model
    (ARHYTHM), the simultaneous heat and water model (SHAW), the cold region hydrological
    model (CRHM), the distributed water heat coupled model (DWHC), the GEOtop distributed
    hydrological model, the soil–vegetation–atmosphere transfer model (SVAT) and so
    on (Rigon et al., 2006; Pomeroy et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2008; Wang et al.,
    2010; Zhang et al., 2000; Guo et al., 2011; Ridler et al., 2012; Zhang et al.,
    2013; Müller et al., 2014; Shrestha et al., 2014). However, some of these water-heat
    coupling models were proposed and optimized at a single layer (soil, plant canopy
    or atmosphere). For instance, in an early attempt to link hydrology to the energy
    balance, Swift et al. (1975) used a model to examine the effects of modifications
    to the vegetation regime on soil and vegetation water balance. They used the Penman–Monteith
    equation as the basis for evapotranspiration from a single canopy layer. Soil
    water thermodynamics is connected with soil-water dynamics, and combined with
    crop growth kinetic, to form a new soil-water kinetic model, and to realize the
    coupling simulation of water and heat at the soil interface (Wang et al., 1994).
    Fischer et al. (2008) presented an approach to describe the water and energy coupling
    mechanism by upgrading the HIRVAC (High Resolution Vegetation Atmosphere Coupler)
    model in the vegetation boundary layer, though considering the stomata reaction
    to a change in soil water content with the submodel PSN6. Expectedly, the importance
    of the interactions between the atmosphere and the soil or crop surface is now
    well recognized for their impact on hydrological and atmospheric processes. SPAC
    as a holistic system has been considered in the hydrothermal researches. Some
    water-heat coupling models were developed for this system, which usually focused
    on river basins (Zhang et al., 2000; Zhou et al., 2006; Pomeroy et al., 2007;
    Chen et al., 2008; Nasonova and Gusev, 2008; Jia et al., 2009). In addition, these
    coupling models were composed of some independent sub-module, rather than consider
    them as a whole. Some researches involving plants varied from grassland (Larsen
    et al., 2016), forests (Lafleur, 1992), and to crop, such as maize (McGinn and
    King, 1990; Li et al., 2013), vineyard (Marras et al., 2014), lettuce (Luo et
    al., 1992) and wheat (Alves et al., 1998), usually focused on the energy partition
    and evapotranspiration in the system. For instance, Li et al. (2013) described
    the integration of SHAW, a soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer (SVAT) model, with
    a stomatal-photosynthesis model and WOFOST, a crop growth model, to simulate the
    water and energy budgets during maize growth, aimed at optimized water use. Another
    model consists of a canopy evapotranspiration module, a canopy photosynthesis
    module and a soil water and heat transfer module, which can be used to simulate
    water, heat and CO2 flux in the North China Plain (Wang et al., 2006). On crop
    land surface, the energy and water processes are closely linked with each other,
    and are controlled by and give feedbacks to the lower atmosphere conditions (Kim
    et al., 1989; Ridler et al., 2012). Specifically, the water transport process
    in the SPAC system determines the soil moisture and leaf water status and soil
    and plant canopy temperature, through affecting the energy partitioning between
    latent heat and sensible heat of the canopy, as well as soil heat flux, which
    are the key variables in determining land surface energy balance. However, the
    temporal and spatial continuity of hydrothermal conversion cannot be well reflected
    by the model, which consisits of different sub-models, and mostly with complex
    calculation process and many parameters. A holistic recursive model based on water-heat
    coupling could profoundly depict every component of water and energy cycle process
    and their inter-relationship in a holistic manner, which deliberately avoids the
    complex process of crop growth, different from previous models. A simplified simulation
    model will be very useful for improving the understanding in water resources evolution
    trend in environmental changes, impacts on hydrothermal cycle from soil moisture
    variation, and agricultural irrigation prediction in ungauged field. Meanwhile,
    to cope with the increasing water scarcity, several water-saving irrigation (WSI)
    techniques have been recently applied to rice paddies (Kato et al., 2011; Rothenberg
    et al., 2011; Cui and Huang, 2012). When the field water condition is disturbed
    in the SPAC system, water and energy balance will be changed greatly. The drying-wetting
    cycle in soil moisture condition not only modulates thermal gradients and hydraulic
    properties in the soil layer but also affects rice growth, canopy resistance and
    water vapor transmission near the surface, and in turn, influences energy transfer
    and hydrologic cycle in a complex manner (Gao et al., 2003; Castellvi et al.,
    2006; Linquist et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2017). Although alteration of the water
    balance through reduced irrigation water usage by the crop is fairly well understood,
    the effects of the soil moisture content changes on surface water balance and
    surface aerodynamics, which drives the water and heat cycle, are subtler. Therefore,
    a novel water-heat coupling model that considers the variation of soil moisture
    condition is necessary, so as to further promote the application of WSI technology
    and the development of research on water and heat in farmland, and to provide
    a reference for optimizing the irrigation management in paddy field. In the present
    study, fundamental theory of water and energy balance was described. The simulation
    of variables along with the results were deduced orderly both in time and space.
    The overall performance of the novel model, with the validation dataset of 2016
    rice season, were validated and presented. The key objective is to provides a
    new idea and an overall framework of water-heat coupling model to simulate the
    flux transport and water and heat status orderly in the SPAC rice system under
    WSI conditions, which will be greatly useful for irrigation strategy. 2. Materials
    and methods 2.1. Experimental site and measurements 2.1.1. Site description In-situ
    measurements were conducted in 2014–2016 rice seasons at the Kunshan Irrigation
    and Drainage Experiment Station (31°15′15″N, 120°57′43″E). The study area, located
    in the Taihu Lake region of China, has a subtropical monsoon climate. Annual average
    rainfall and annual pan evaporation was estimated as 1097.1 mm and 1365.9 mm for
    the past 50 years, respectively. Average daily temperature and relative humidity
    during rice season (2014–2016) were 24.8 °C and 79.2%. During the rice season
    from 2014 to 2016, the rainfall was 478, 325 and 564.9 mm, and the irrigation
    was 410.9, 394.8 and 418.3 mm, respectively, under similar conditions. The soil
    is hydragric anthrosol, with a bulk density of 1.30 g cm−3. The soil volumetric
    saturated moisture (θs), field capacity (θf), measured by cutting ring method,
    and wilting point (θw) are 0.502, 0.392 and 0.179 m3 m−3 at the soil depth of
    10 cm, respectively. Seedlings were transplanted on June 26 2014, June 27 2015
    and July 2 2016, followed by a 124 d, 121 d and 125 d period of rice growth, respectively,
    planting at inter- and intra-row spacing of 0.23 and 0.16 m, respectively. Rice
    was irrigated according to a local water-saving irrigation (WSI) practice for
    three years (Xu et al., 2012). If the heavy rain results in flooding water higher
    than 5 cm in the farmland, the surface drainage tap was opened in time to let
    excessive water drained out, and the surface water level before and after the
    drainage, as well as the amount of drainage was recorded. Fertilizer and pesticides
    were applied according to local practice in three years. 2.1.2. Field measurements
    An EC system (Open Path Eddy Covariance, Campbell Scientific Inc., United States)
    was installed in the site, to measure the water and heat fluxes within the rice
    fields with a fetch of about 200 m in all directions around. The EC system was
    aligned perpendicular to the prevailing wind direction (south-east direction).
    It was composed of a CSAT3A sonic anemometer (Campbell Scientific Inc., USA) and
    an EC150 open-path infrared gas analyzer (Campbell Scientific Inc., USA) operating
    at a frequency of 10 Hz, both at 2.5 m above the soil surface. The soil heat flux
    (Gs) was measured at the depth of 0.08 m using HFP01SC heat flux plates (Campbell
    Scientific Inc., USA). Volumetric soil moisture content (θ) and soil temperature
    (Ts) were measured at 0.10 m, 0.20 m and 0.30 m depths by CS616 soil moisture
    reflectometers (Campbell Scientific Inc. USA.) and 109 TCAV soil thermocouple
    probes (Campbell Scientific Inc. USA), respectively. All observed variables were
    recorded every 30 min. Detailed information about field measurement, as well as
    the data quality control of EC system has been presented by Xu et al. (2017).
    Meteorological data were recorded within the WSI rice field at half-hour intervals
    by sensors incorporated in an EC system, and simultaneously by an automatic meteorological
    station (WS-STD1, DELTA-T, UK) over a well-maintained meadow within the experiment
    station. Net radiation (Rn), air relative humidity (RH), air temperature (Ta),
    wind speed (U), atmospheric pressure (Pa), and precipitation (P) were measured
    using both instruments. Rn, RH, Ta, and U were measured at 1.5 m, 2.0 m, and 2.5 m
    above ground surface, respectively. Three automatic weighed micro-lysimeters (diameter
    of 30 cm) without plants were used to measure soil evaporation (E) based on the
    hourly mass change, which installed in the WSI rice field and aligned with the
    EC system in a northwest direction. The configuration, location and measurement
    of the micro-lysimeters were described in Liu et al. (2018) in more detail. The
    soil moisture condition in the micro-lysimeters was managed to match the soil
    moisture condition in surrounding farmland. Deep seepage, measured by drainage-lysimeter,
    which had an area of 2.5 m × 2 m and a depth of 1.3 m, drained through a water-permeable
    tube (40 mm in inner diameter) installed 1.2 m below the soil surface into the
    gallery. Deep seepage volumes were measured by using an automatic tipping bucket
    gauge placed at the end of the system. The volumetric soil moisture content was
    also routinely monitored daily (08:00 LT) by time domain reflectometry (TRASE
    System, Soil Moisture Equipment Corporation, United States) at 0–0.2-m, 0.1–0.3-m,
    and 0.2–0.4-m depths. The soil surface temperature (Ts-0) was calculated using
    a harmonic method (Horton et al., 1983; Horton and Wierenga, 1983) based on Ts
    measured at a depth of 0.10 m (Ts-10). At 5-day intervals over the growing season,
    canopy height (hc) and leaf area index (LAI) were measured for five fixed plants
    and averaged. For intervening days, hc and LAI was determined by linear interpolation.
    2.2. Theory and formula 2.2.1. Water balance equation In general, ET could be
    calculated directly from water balance equation applied over a given period (Evett
    et al., 2012). (1) where, ΔM is the sum of change during the period in soil water
    stored in the control volume (mm); P and I are precipitation and irrigation (mm),
    respectively; Wd and Ws are drainage (correspond to the surface runoff) and deep
    seepage (mm), respectively; and ET is the field evapotranspiration (mm). Side
    leakage of paddy field is not considered. For the Eq. (1), P and I can be considered
    as known variables. Drainage is triggered by field water level after rainfall,
    and Wd is determined accordingly. Ws of paddy field is calculated according to
    an equation(Eq. (6))proposed by Shi et al. (2013), for flooded and non-flooded
    conditions, respectively. Another unknown variable ET in Eq. (1) can be calculated
    by P-M formula based on the energy balance and aerodynamics theory. So far, ΔM
    can be calculated according to the water balance equation, and then the soil moisture
    content at the next time step can also be inferred, which implements a recurrence
    in time. 2.2.2. Energy balance equation Assuming that the energy converted into
    chemical energy by green plants and the horizontal flow of energy, caused by advection
    between the soil surface and the level of the eddy covariance instrumentation,
    were negligible, then the energy balance equation of a terrestrial surface is
    simplified as (2) where LE is the latent heat flux (W m−2); Hs is the sensible
    heat flux (W m−2); Rn is the net radiation (W m−2); G0 is the surface soil heat
    flux (W m−2), G0 = Gs+Q8, with Gs being the soil heat flux measured at 8 cm beneath
    soil surface by heat flux plates and Q8 being the change in soil heat storage
    in 0–8 cm surface soil; S is the canopy heat storage in biomass and water content
    (W m−2); Detailed methods of the correction of energy imbalance and the enforcing
    closure have been presented by Xu et al. (2017). It is worth noting that, Q8 were
    not measured directly, it can be determined approximately based on the change
    in soil temperature of 10 cm depth (Meyers and Hollinger, 2004; Heitman et al.,
    2010) following the equation of Eq. (25). For the Eq. (2), LE in the energy balance
    equation is equivalent to ET and can be calculated by multiplying with λ. Rn is
    the input, which was measured directly. G0 is calculated based on its correlation
    with net radiation, which was calibrated using the measured dataset. S is neglected,
    since it accounted for less than 2% of the available energy during the rice cultivation
    season deduced from a concentration profile method inside the canopy (Leuning
    et al., 2012). And then Hs was calculated by energy balance equation (Eq. (2))
    2.2.3. Variables for water-heat coupling The ET (water in millimeter equivalent
    to LE) and θ were considered as the key variables in the water-heat coupling process
    of paddy field. Water balances are linked to energy balances, because the latent
    energy/evapotranspiration appears as a key element in both balances. Thus, ET
    (LE) is the main way of water consumption and energy output in rice field ecosystem
    and is also a vital link between water and heat transformation (Fig. 1). Meanwhile,
    θ as the main variable reflecting the particularity of the WSI environment is
    not only an important factor affecting the Ws and ET in the water balance equation,
    but also affecting the energy flux G0 and Q, as well as the soil heat state Ts-0
    and Ts-10 in the energy balance. Therefore, the two variables are links to reflect
    the close relationship between water cycle and energy conversion for the simulation
    of hydrothermal state in the SPAC system, and then the water-heat coupling relationship
    can be constructed in the WSI rice field. Download : Download high-res image (478KB)

    resistance; , , represent the canopy resistance, the mean boundary layer resistance
    of the canopy and the soil surface resistance, respectively). 2.3. Statistical
    analysis Performance of the model was verified using four indicators, the linear
    regression slope, coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE)
    and the index of agreement (IOA). These indicators were used to evaluate the correlation
    between the measured and simulated variables. 3. Model description and development
    3.1. System schematization Allocation and conversion of the water and energy in
    SPAC system of rice field can be described by a schematic diagram (Fig. 1), which
    is divided into three layers: an atmosphere layer at reference height, a canopy
    layer at the height of momentum transfer confluence based on the P-M big-leaf
    model, and a soil surface layer with the shallow flooding water occasionally.
    The model emphasizes the state of hydrothermal equilibrium rather than the hydrodynamic
    and thermodynamic transport processes. Several assumptions are made on the canopy
    layer at this study. The canopy layer, between soil surface and crop height, is
    considered as a big leaf when calculating energy and water balance, and the canopy
    resistance is used to represent the critical controls on heat and vapor flux transfer
    through the SPAC system within the canopy (Monteith, 1965; Katerji et al., 2011).
    The transfer amount from molecular diffusion is negligible comparing with that
    from turbulent diffusion due to the wind speed. The net radiation is essentially
    balanced by the sum of soil heat, sensible heat and latent heat flux. 3.2. Model
    development Data in 2014 and 2015 (n = 5086) rice season were used as training
    datasets for calibration of the water-heat coupling model. The input meteorological
    variables of the model are Rn, Ta, D and V, all of them are routine meteorological
    data. The other inputs for soil, crop and others are field specific values, and
    model parameters should be calibrated values, which are introduced in the following
    words in details. Given the initial values of soil moisture content (θ100) and
    soil surface temperature (Ts-100) at a depth of 0.10 m, the water and heat fluxes,
    can be calculated according to the process of energy balance and water balance.
    The main outputs of the model include G0, LE, Hs, ET, θ10, Ts-0, Ts-10, Tc, LAI
    and hc. The coupled model can not only simulate the variation of LAI and hc, but
    also reflect the processes of evapotranspiration, as well as the energy balance
    conversion. According to the surface water balance relationship, evapotranspiration
    (ET) can be expressed as: (3) (4) where ρ is the density of dry air (kg m−3);
    λ is the latent flux of heat (MJ kg−1), λ = 2.501–(2.361 × 10−3) Ta, with Ta being
    the average temperature (◦C); Δz is the change in soil depth (m), which is equal
    to 0.1 m in this study, the same as the depth of heat flux calculation; θ10 is
    the average volumetric soil water content in the 0.1 m soil layer (m3 m−3); ΔM
    is the sum of change during the time period in soil water stored in the control
    volume (mm); if shallow flooding water was maintained, then ΔM is equal the change
    of the water layer Δhw (mm). Note that the number 3600 is a time conversion from
    “s” to “h”, and the superscript "i" is time index variables for time steps, indicating
    the time of calculation. The meaning of other symbols is the same as before. Theoretically,
    the water balance equation is applicable to any temporal scale, but in practice,
    soil moisture is considered to vary relatively slowly in diurnal variation althought
    the irrigation and rainfall is with strong real-time feature, and so the water
    balance equation was considered on a daily time step for computational efficiency
    and accuracy, and the variation of θ10 was deduced recursively. The θ10 value
    of the next prediction time was determined by water balance equation after the
    initial value of the soil moisture content (θ100) was given at the initial time
    of the simulation. When the real-time information of the surface water layer followed
    a rainfall or irrigation was obtained, the time was taken as a new initial state
    and the calculation recycle again. Notably, the difference in time-steps between
    model components does mean that diurnal variability of soil moisture is not simulated
    and its influence on the surface energy balance is therefore overlooked. However,
    it wass not considered as a very significant factor for long-term water balance
    studies (Silberstein et al., 1999). Thus, according to the water balance theory,
    the recurrence equation of soil moisture content can be expressed as: (5) Where
    Pi−1, Ii−1 are known as inputs. Wdi−1 is judged by rainfall and soil moisture
    at the previous moment. Wsi−1 and ETi−1 are variables that need to be further
    determined. The seepage volume of paddy field was calculated according to the
    following linear and non-linear model based on the flooded and non-flooded paddy
    soil respectively (Shi et al., 2013): (6) where hw is the depth of water above
    the soil surface (mm); a and b are parameters which should be determined in the
    model calibration; K0 is the saturated hydraulic conductivity (m d−1), generally
    taken 0.1–1.0 m d−1, mainly related to the soil texture, and the greater the soil
    viscosity, the smaller the value; ε is the empirical constant (generally from
    50 to 250), and the greater the soil viscosity, the greater the value; ti is the
    number of days that soil moisture content from a resent saturation state to i
    days. In this study, the seepage rate in paddy field was measured by drainage-lysimeter.
    According to the measured results, the deep seepage of paddy field mainly occurred
    with shallow flooding water maintained in the field, as well as in the middle
    and later tiller, jointing and booting and heading to flowering stages without
    flooding. The seepage during the period without flooding layer after the milk
    ripening was not considered in the calculation. Thus, coefficients a and b in
    Eq. (6) were determined to be 0.125 and 0.262 based on the calibration dataset
    with flooding layer respectively (coefficient of determination R2 = 0.789), and
    K0 = 0.3 and ε = 140 based on the calibration dataset without flooding (R2 = 0.602).
    Assuming the seepage rate is the same at each time of the day, and then the seepage
    rate of rice fields on a daily and hourly scale can be calculated. Another unknown
    variable ET in Eq. (5) can be calculated by P-M formula based on the energy balance
    and aerodynamics theory: (7) where λ is the latent flux of heat (MJ kg−1), λ = 2.
    501－(2. 361 × 10 −3) Ta, with Ta being the average temperature (°C); Δ is the
    slope of the saturation-to-vapor pressure curve (kPa °C−1); ρ is the density of
    dry air (kg m−3); Cp is the specific heat capacity of air, Cp = 1.013 × 10-3 MJ
    kg−1 °C−1; D is the water vapor deficit (kPa); ra and rc is the aerodynamic resistance
    and canopy resistance of water vapor transfer from the surface to ambient air
    (s m−1); γ is the psychrometric constant (kPa °C−1), γ = 0.00163P / λ, with Pa
    being the atmospheric pressure (kPa); The number 3600 is a time conversion from
    "s" to "h". Aerodynamic resistance ra in Eq. (7) is calculated as (Alves et al.,
    1998): (8) where is the height of wind measurement (2.5 m in EC system); d = 0.63
    hc, is zero plane displacement height (m), with hc being the rice canopy height
    (m);  = 0.123 hc, is roughness length governing momentum transfer (m); is the
    height of relative humidity measurements (m);  = 0.1 , is the roughness length
    governing transfer of heat and vapor (m); k is the von Karman’s constant (0.41);
    U is wind speed at 2.5 m above the soil surface (m s−1). Canopy resistance rc,
    affected by numerous environmental variables simultaneously, was calculated through
    an empirical multi-factorial approach by the following equations (Jarvis, 1976;
    Ershadi et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2017). The determination of canopy resistance
    is the key to calculating the evapotranspiration of the PM model. To improve the
    performance of canopy-resistance model under WSI condition, a term of effective
    leaf area index (LAIa) was used to reflect the influence of canopy coverage condition,
    and coefficients a4 was added in soil water response functions of Jarvis-type
    rc model, as well as θf (mostly used for upland crops) was replace by θs, due
    to the specific soil moisture condition in WSI rice fields. (9) (10) (11) (12)
    (13) where rs is the bulk stomatal resistance (s m−1); rmin is the minimum canopy
    resistance (s m−1); , , and are weighing functions representing the effects of
    solar radiation; humidity, air temperature and soil moisture on plant stress;
    θs = 50.2% and θw = 17.9% are saturated soil moisture and wilting point (m3 m-3),
    respectively; a1, a2, a3 and a4 are coefficients which should be determined in
    the model calibration. LAIa is the effective leaf area index, which considers
    that only the upper leaves in the canopy are active in heat and vapor transfer
    (Alves et al., 1998). LAIa is equal to actual LAIfor LAI ≤ 2, equal to LAI/2 for
    LAI ≥ 4 and equal 2 for intermediate values of LAI (Gardiol et al., 2003). Notably,
    in the present study LAIa (in Eq. (9)) was used to reflect the influence of canopy
    LAI; θs, instead of field capacity (θf), was used as a key parameter in the soil
    water response functions of Eq. (13); a coefficient a4 was introduced to reflect
    the specific wetting-drying cycle condition of soil moisture. The three distinguishing
    features were the specific of the rc model responded to the special WSI condition.
    Then coefficients a1, a2, a3 and a4 in Eqs. (10), (11), (12), (13) were determined
    to be 45.8, 0.006, 0.005 and 6.0 based on the 2014 and 2015 calibration dataset,
    respectively. Additionally, hc and LAI are unknown variables in Eqs. (8) and (9)
    that need to be solved to calculate ra and rc, respectively. A good agreement
    was found between measured and fitted hc and LAI values (Fig. 2), with high R2
    of 0.976 and 0.952, respectively, but some discrepancies were found between measured
    and fitted LAI values during re-greening period (DOY < 10 d, DOY, days after transplanting).
    So, the simulated LAI value was set to a fixed value of 0.3 when DOY < 10 d. The
    relationships between hc and LAI with days after transplanting were established
    respectively according to the calibration samples as follow, and it is believed
    that the hourly values equal to the daily mean. (14) (15) Download : Download

    of measured and fitted (a) canopy height (hc) and (b) leaf area index (LAI) during
    the rice growing season of calibration dataset. The energy component G0, an unknown
    variable in the process of the model derivation, was described in more detail
    in the same WSI region in our previous research (Liu et al., 2017), which reported
    the diurnal variations of G0 varied in the same pattern as Rn (a unimodal shape),
    with negative values at night, but at a 0.5–1.5 h lag behind Rn. In the present
    study, drawing on data on the diurnal pattern of the ratio of G0 to Rn in the
    daytime, the quadratic function over time was used to describe the variation of
    ratio G0 to Rn. During the transition periods from daytime to nighttime, the ratio
    of G0 to Rn changed drastically due to the smaller G0 and Rn values. Therefore,
    the monthly average of G0/Rn in 8:00–17:00 period is used to establish the quadratic
    function. The relationship between the ratio of G0 to Rn and time was shown in
    Fig. 3. The regressions were significant at α < 0.001 confidence level, with a
    high R2 of 0.868. The relationship between the two components at other times can
    be better characterized by a linear relationship (R2 = 0.534, α<0.001). Thus,
    the relation of Eq. (16) served in calculating the variation of surface soil heat
    flux G0 at hourly scale, and the daily value was calculated by the average of
    hourly values. (16) By substituting Eqs. (6), (7), (8), (9), (10), (11), (12),
    (13), (14), (15), (16) into Eq. (5), θi value in the next day can be obtained,
    which is in preparation for the calculation of ET at the next moment. According
    to this recursive relation, five variables of LAI (daily scale), hc (daily scale),
    θ (daily scale), G0 (hourly and daily scale) and ET (hourly and daily scale) can
    be calculated, and then Hs can be obtained according to the energy balance equation
    (Eq. (17)). So far, the main components of water balance and energy balance in
    paddy fields can be output recursively. (17) Download : Download high-res image

    of G0 to Rn during daytime. Notably, changes in soil moisture of rice field lead
    to dramatic changes in the soil moisture cycle, and an obvious one is manifested
    as changes in soil evaporation (E), which in turn exert a profound influence on
    the water-heat transfer of ecosystem. The daily variation during the whole growth
    period for evaporation (E) was analyzed, and the ratio of E to ET was also discussed
    from earlier studies in the current experiment station under same condition (Liu
    et al., 2016). The variation of E/ET in the whole growth period can be described
    by a quadric curve with days after transplanting as independent variable. The
    comparison between the fitted curve and the observed data is shown in Fig. 4,
    and the curvilinear equation can be expressed as： (18) E/ET = 9E-05 DOY2 − 0.016

    the re-greening, early tillering, middle tillering, later tillering, jointing
    and booting, heading to flowering, milk and yellow ripening stage, respectively).
    In addition to water and energy balance components, the model also predicts the
    temperature variation in the SPAC system. Water vapor and heat are carried away
    from the immediate vicinity of the soil or the canopy surface by turbulent bulk
    flow of parcels of air containing quantities of heat and vapor. This turbulent
    flux is proportional to the vapor concentration or temperature difference between
    z1 and z2. Thus, the turbulent flux of sensible heat away from the surface is
    written as: (19) where T1 and T2 are the temperatures at heights z1 (the soil
    or the canopy surface) and z2 (an arbitrary elevation) (°C) and η is the turbulent
    transfer coefficient for heat between z1 and z2. According to the aerodynamic
    transport equation (Eq. (19)), Hs monitored by the EC system can be decomposed
    into two parts: the soil surface to the canopy surface and the canopy surface
    to the height of 2.5 m. The net flux is a transport of heat and water vapor in
    two consecutive spatial extents. The η within and above the canopy is affected
    by the aerodynamic resistance from the soil surface to in-canopy flow and that
    from the canopy surface to the reference height. Thus, Eq. (19) may be rewritten
    in terms of the aerodynamic resistance: (20) where, Ts-0、Tc and Ta are the temperature
    of soil surface, canopy surface and reference height (°C), respectively; is the
    aerodynamic resistance of the mean canopy flow (s m −1), calculated by Eq. (8),
    the same as the calculation formula of ; is the aerodynamic resistance of the
    soil surface to in-canopy flow (s m −1), which is calculated from the vertical
    wind profile at the field and the eddy diffusion coefficient by Eq. (21) (Katerji
    and Rana, 2006); c and d are coefficients which should be determined in the model
    calibration. For the calibration phase, the coefficients c and d were determined
    to be −2.054 and 0.408, respectively. The highly significant (α < 0.001) was confirmed
    by a R2 of 0.766, RMSE of 11.435 W m-2. (21) where ξ is the extinction coefficient
    of the eddy diffusion, chosen as a typical value for crops (wheat, rice, clover
    and corn), with a value of 2.5 (Monteith, 1973), and other variable symbols are
    the same as before. Certainly, Ts-0 and Tc in Eq. (20) are not input variables.
    Ts-0 is the key variable of water-heat exchange between soil and atmosphere, but
    only the measured values of soil temperature Ts-10, Ts-20 and Ts-30 at 0.1 m,
    0.2 m and 0.3 m below the surface of the earth are available, no measured value
    of Ts-0. Therefore, based on the soil texture and soil moisture conditions in
    the experimental area, the study results of Jury and Horton (2004) on the correlation
    between Ts-0 and Ts-10, Ts-20 and Ts-30 of heavy loam were analyzed, it was found
    that the ratio of Ts-0 to Ts-10 had a sinusoidal variation relationship, and the
    correlation of Ts-0 / Ts-10 with time can be expressed as: (22) where A, B and
    C are model parameters; t is time, hourly time steps been chosen to calculate
    temperature and heat storage. A = 1.001, B = 0.059 and C = 15.504 were fitted
    with Origin 85, good performance of the fitted model with a R2 = 0.979 (Fig. 5).
    Thus, Ts-0 can be expressed as: (23) Download : Download high-res image (94KB)

    the rice cultivation season of calibration dataset. In the above expression, Ts-10
    can be calculated according to the change in soil heat storage in 0–10 cm surface
    soil (Q10) (Ochsner et al., 2007; Heitman et al., 2010): (24) where zm is the
    reference depth (m), Cs is the heat capacity of the moist soil (J kg−1 K−1) and
    T0 is an arbitrarily assigned reference temperature, chosen T0 = 0 °C (Ochsner
    et al., 2007). When given the measured depth (zm = 0.1 m), Q10i can be expressed
    as: (25) (26) where Δz is the calculation depth of the soil and Δt is the interval
    time between two data outputs. ρb is the bulk density (1.35 g cm−3), ρw is the
    density of water (1.0 g cm−3), Cw is the heat capacity of water (4.190 J kg−1 K−1),
    and Cd is the heat capacity of a dry mineral soil, which is 840 J kg−1 K−1. Comparing
    the monthly averaged diurnal variations of G10 (G10 = G0–Q10) and G0 calculated
    by the training dataset (Fig. 6), the variation trends of G10 and G0 are similar,
    but the phase of the G10 wave is retarded with respect to the surface soil heat
    flux by a time lag of 1 h, same as the time interval of the study period. It can
    be assumed that Q10i is the response to G0i−1 in the previous hour, so that the
    correlation between Q10i and G0i−1 was established based on training data samples

    in the above derivation process, five steps must be taken to determine three temperature
    variables (Ts-0, Ts-10 and Tc) in the SPAC system. First, G0 must be determined.
    Second, the correlation between Q10i and G0i−1 must be established using some
    approximation of Eq. (26). Third, the change of heat storage above the reference
    depth is estimated based on the soil volumetric heat capacity and temperature,
    and the formal relationship must be established. Fourth, the sinusoidal variation
    relationship of Ts-0 / Ts-10 with time should be calibrated. Fifth, Tc in Eq.
    (20) must be calculated using some specific calibration variables of Eqs. (21),
    (22), (23), (24), (25), (26), (27). So far, all the non-input variables in the
    above model can be recursively solved. The model reflects the water-heat relationship
    in the SPAC system, and should be capable in coupling simulation of water-heat
    in the water-saving irrigated paddy field. 3.3. Model operation A simplified sequence
    flow diagram was used to illustrate the operation of water-heat coupling model
    (Fig. 8). The model was run in the rice growth stage at hourly time step. Initially,
    the model driving variables included conventional meteorological data (Rn, Ta,
    D and V), which were obtained from the EC system and the automatic meteorological
    station measurements. The model initial conditions of soil temperature at 0.1 m
    depths (Ts-100) and water content (θ0) were given based on the measurements by
    109 TCAV soil thermocouple probes and CS616 soil moisture reflectometers, respectively.
    The functions of crop growth (LAI and hc) were fitted according to the training
    samples, with the days after transplanting as independent variable. LAIi and hci
    were considered to be the same values at each hour of the day, that is, the daily
    average was equal to the hourly value. Then water and heat variables were calculated
    in turn. All input variables for the model are hourly time steps, and the output
    variables may be hourly or daily time steps. The soil moisture condition needs
    to be re-entered as initial condition when rainfall or irrigation results in the
    shallow flooding water, to satisfy the calculation condition of seepage model,
    and reduce the cumulative error in soil moisture calculation. The input and output
    variables of the model were enumerated in Tables 1 and 2 , and the simulation
    results were presented in the following Section 4. Download : Download high-res

    proposed coupling model was done by comparing the recursive estimated with experimental
    data. The model validation period was the rice season of year 2016. Based on calibrated
    model, profiles of crop growth characteristics, water and heat balance components
    and soil and canopy temperatures could be simulated. The feasibility and accuracy
    of the model were analyzed at hourly and daily time step. 4.1. Crop parameters
    (LAI and hc) Based on Eq. (15), the dynamic variation of LAI along with days after
    rice transplantation was shown in Fig. 9a. LAI increased gradually with the growth
    of rice, reached its maximum at 80–90 days after transplanting, and then decreased
    slightly. The simulated values were slightly deviated at the early and the vigorous
    growth stage of rice, closely matching the measured values in other periods (Fig.
    9b). The highly significant (α<0.001) linear regression was confirmed by R2 of
    0.974, RMSE of 0.293 and the index of agreement (IOA) of 0.994. Download : Download

    and (b) regression analysis of simulated and measured leaf area index (LAI). The
    dynamic change of hc was also described along with the days after transplanting.
    As the figure explained that the simulated value of hc was in good agreement with
    the measured value (α < 0.001), with a slight underestimation at peak period (Fig.
    10). With the increase of rice growth, hc increased first and then tended to be
    flat after 100 days since transplantation. R2, RMSE and IOA were 0.948, 3.742 cm
    and 0.987, respectively. Good performance of the crop LAI and hc simulation provides
    reliable basic crop data for the accurate simulation of water and heat fluxes
    in WSI rice field. Download : Download high-res image (172KB) Download : Download

    and measured canopy height (hc). 4.2. Model response to water status of paddy
    field 4.2.1. Soil moisture content One of the key points in verifying soil moisture
    variation process was ensuring that the soil moisture condition was re-entered
    as initial condition when rainfall or irrigation resulted in the shallow flooding
    water. Fig. 11 displayed the daily variation of soil water status in water-saving
    irrigated paddy field. The model captured the seasonal variation pattern of soil
    water content and surface water layer, although some discrepancies occurred between
    the simulated and observed values. It was slightly overestimated when a deeper
    flooding water was maintained. Possible as results that there were side seepage
    and other water consumption in the actual paddy field during flooded period, and
    the actual water consumption was larger than the simulated condition. By and large,
    the model shows very good performance on θ and hw (deduced by daily time step).
    Three indicators, R2, RMSE and IOA, were 0.876, 1.520 cm−3 cm−3, and 0.966 for
    θ, and 0.991, 1.362 mm and 0.997 for hw, respectively (Fig. 12). Download : Download

    determines the coupling between water and heat, is the transport of latent heat
    by vapor flux within the soil and at the interface between the soil and the atmosphere.
    In order to quantify the simulation performance of ET, an important component
    in water balance (water in millimeter equivalent to LE in energy balance), when
    ‘optimal’ parameterizations were adopted, the modeled ET were plotted against
    the observed ones as depicted in Fig. 13a. The scatter plots (Fig. 13a) confirmed
    that all the data were moderately little dispersed around the 1:1 line, showing
    no significant biases in the modeled ET (α<0.001). The regression slopes were
    1.023 (RMSE = 0.047 mm h−1), with R2 of 0.964 and IOA of 0.991, both close to
    1.0. The modeled E were also plotted against the observed ones, showing a quite
    good agreement (Fig. 13a), although the distribution of discrete degree was slightly
    larger than ET. The regression slope, R2, RMSE and IOA were 0.978, 0.770, 0.061 mm
    h−1 and 0.932, respectively. The latent heat LE appears as evapotranspiration
    in the SPAC system, which is a crucial component of its energy cycle. Download

    Relationships between simulated and measured values of evapotranspiration (ET)
    as well as evaporation (E) at (a) hourly and (b) daily scales. In this study,
    seven days in different growth periods were selected out in 2016 rice season either
    with sunny (Fig. 14a) or cloudy days (Fig. 14b), respectively, to analyze the
    performance of the simulated ET and E. Variation of soil moisture condition (θ
    and hw) in the seven sunny days corresponded to days 16, 22, 35, 62, 74, 101 and
    115 after transplanting, and corresponded to days 10, 33, 51, 71, 94 and 118 in
    the six cloudy days respectively. In general, the ET calculated by the model were
    in a good agreement with the measured value (IOA = 0.993 and 0.973 for sunny and
    cloudy days). The diurnal variation curves of E were basically the same as ET,
    although the simulation results were not as good as that of ET, due to the results
    containing the errors caused by the simulation of ET. In addition, there were
    no significant difference in the simulation of ET with or without flooding water
    (from Fig. 11, Fig. 14). However, the model overestimated hourly E at noon time
    both in sunny (i.e., July 23th) and cloudy days (i.e., July 11th and August 21th)
    when flooding water was maintained or soil was saturated. Thus, the agreement
    between hourly simulated and measured E values was good other than during the
    period with flooding or soil moisture saturation. Download : Download high-res

    variation between the measured and simulated evapotranspiration (ET) as well as
    evaporation (E) for (a) sunny and (b) cloudy days. By substituting the daily scale
    data into water balance formula and PM model, daily ET can be also simulated.
    Drawing on data on the relationship between E and ET proposed in previous studies,
    the daily E was calculated and plotted in Fig. 13b. The regressions between simulated
    and measured values were significant at α < 0.001 confidence level. The slope
    of the OLS regression was 0.909 for ET, and 0.976 for E, both close to 1.0. R2
    and RMSE were 0.977 and 0.218 mm d−1 for ET, and 0.896 and 0.402 mm d−1 for E,
    respectively, and IOA values were close to 1, with values of 0.990 and 0.970,
    respectively. It indicated that the modeled ET and E values were more consistent
    with measured values at daily scale than at hourly scale, possible as results
    of the simulation errors of hourly ET noon and during transition period from daytime
    to nighttime offset each other when ET was calculated at daily scale. Same as
    the hourly scale calculation, the performance of modeled E was not as good as
    that of ET. Model performance in daily ET and E calculation were assessed in WSI
    paddy fields (Fig. 15). By and large, the simulated and measured values of seasonally
    ET and E, varied in a similar trend, while the simulated value tended to underestimate
    the measured value in varied degrees in re-greening stage, performed getting better
    along with the crop growth in late season. The good performance of the proposed
    model at high LAI may be linked to the assumption of the PM equation (a single-source
    ‘big-leaf’ model). Download : Download high-res image (437KB) Download : Download

    4.3. Model response to heat status of paddy field 4.3.1. Soil heat flux Surface
    soil heat flux G0 is an important heat flux for model output. Compared with the
    measured G0, which was derived from the soil heat flux measured at 8 cm beneath
    soil surface by heat flux plates (Gs) and the change in soil heat storage in 0–8 cm
    surface soil (Q8), the coupled model resulted in acceptable accuracy (Fig. 16a).
    The linear regression between the measured and simulated G0 was significant at
    α < 0.001 confidence level. R2, RMSE and IOA were 0.789, 17.500 W m−2 and 0.942,
    respectively. The results also indicated that simulated hourly G0 was less accurate
    when G0 was higher than 40 W m-2. The simulated daily G0, accumulated as the sum
    of hourly data, was compared with the measured values, and the OLS regression
    between them were plotted in Fig. 16b. R2, RMSE and IOA were 0.561, 4.394 W m−2
    and 0.899, respectively. The confidential level of is high with α < 0.001. Download

    Relationships between simulated and measured values of surface soil heat flux
    (G0) at (a) hourly and (b) daily scales. Also, typical diurnal G0 variations in
    sunny (Fig. 17a) and cloudy days (Fig. 17b) were selected out, to evaluate the
    performance of the water-heat coupling model in hourly G0 calculation at different
    rice growth stages. Simulated G0 varied in the same pattern as measured values
    in sunny days in all the growth stages, while tending to overestimate or underestimate
    the measured values in various degrees at noontime or during the transition periods
    from daytime to nighttime, especially in early growth stage. Considering with
    the soil moisture content, simulated hourly G0 did not always predict the actual
    values when the soil was flooded either in sunny (i.e., July 23th and October
    24th) or cloudy days (i.e., July 11th, August 21th and October 27th), especially
    during noon with higher available energy. It showed that the distribution of energy
    was changed when flooding water was maintained, which had a certain influence
    on the simulation of G0. Notably, using Ts-10 instead of soil temperature at depths
    of 8 cm to calculate Q8, then the Q8 at daytime will be lower, this might be the
    reason why simulated G0 was greater in sunny days in Fig. 17(a). In addition,
    the measured G0 decreased suddenly and abruptly during the transition periods
    from daytime to nighttime, resulting in fairly large simulation error, which was
    subject to the measurement error due to the phase lag of the measured value, some
    time being necessary for the heat flux plate to response to the energy change
    (Poblete- Echeverría et al., 2014). Download : Download high-res image (552KB)

    the measured and simulated soil heat flux (G0) for (a) sunny and (b) cloudy days.
    Fig. 18 shows the daily variation of measured and simulated G0, corresponding
    variation of Rn. Generally, the G0 varied with Rn, showed a tendency of gradually
    decreasing during the whole growth period. The correlation between simulated and
    measured values was better at the regreening and early tillering stages. Because
    of the canopy coverage was low, the conversion of Rn to G0 was less affected by
    the underlying surface and canopy heat storage. During the vigorous period of
    rice growth (middle or later tillering, and jointing to booting stages), the simulated
    G0 differed greatly from the measured value, with a certain degree of overestimation.
    The reasons might be that some energy losses (such as canopy or water heat storage,
    energy advection losses, etc.) was neglected in simulating G0, and the measured
    values greatly affected by various energy transfer resistance, so the calculated
    results were larger. In addition, the accumulation of errors in the calculation
    from hourly scale to daily scale also led to the difference between the simulated
    and measured values. After heading to flowering, the model performed better for
    G0 simulation, due to the flat and uniform underlying surface, which is close
    to the ideal condition for EC measurement and also conforms to the assumption
    of the single-source “big leaf” model (Xu et al., 2017). Download : Download high-res

    4.3.2. Sensible heat flux In the water-heat coupling model, the residual term
    of the energy balance equation was deemed to represent the sensible heat flux
    Hs, regardless of the hourly or daily scale. Therefore, the error in Hs simulation
    reflect the cumulative error of the model to a certain extent. Regression analysis
    of the simulation results of hourly and daily scale Hs was shown in Fig. 19. The
    regressions were significant at α < 0.001 confidence level, and the regression
    slopes of hourly and daily data were 0.913 and 0.941 respectively, which were
    slightly underestimated. R2, RMSE and IOA were 0.595 and 0.562, 20.915 and 5.697 W
    m−2, 0.871 and 0.841, respectively. The performance in Hs simulation was slightly
    lower than that of G0 and LE. Download : Download high-res image (310KB) Download

    of simulated and measured Hs values in typical sunny and cloudy days, in light
    of subplots in Fig. 20, was roughly the same, but the simulation error was larger
    than that of other heat fluxes. The big gap between the two Hs data sets at noon
    time or during the transition period from day to night was ascribed to the accumulative
    error in simulation of ET and G0, especially obvious in cloudy days. The simulation
    of Hs was also directly affected by soil moisture content, the water-heat coupling
    model substantially overestimated hourly Hs at noon time in cloudy days (i.e.,
    July 11th, August 21th and October 27th) under waterlogged condition. Reason might
    be that change in energy storage in the flooding water was not considered in the
    calculation of energy balance. Thus, Hs as the residual of the energy balance
    equation was overestimated, especially in the period with larger water consumption
    at noon. Download : Download high-res image (627KB) Download : Download full-size

    as depicted in Fig. 21, while the error in simulated Hs was also larger than that
    of other heat fluxes. The error in simulated Hs was big during the period with
    low canopy coverage condition and shallow flooding water maintained. In addition,
    the measured G0 was overestimated greatly; as a result, underestimation of Hs
    occurred during the vigorous growth stage of rice. Download : Download high-res

    gradients affect water vapor redistribution, which is the key factor affecting
    hydrothermal conversion. The model outputs temperatures of Ts-0, Ts-10 and Tc.
    Since, Ts-0 was not measured directly in current research, and it was calculated
    from Ts-10, simulated Ts-10 was investigated to show the performance of the model.
    The results of model simulated vs. the observed data were presented in Fig. 22,
    Fig. 23, Fig. 24, for temperatures (Ts-10 and Tc) on different observation layers.
    Fig. 22 showed the simulated Ts-10 and Tc with those measured values. The R2,
    RMSE and IOA were 0.865 and 0.843, 1.697 and 2.773 °C and 0.958 and 0.948, respectively.
    It performed slightly better in simulating Ts-10 than Tc. Tc is the last variable
    deduced in the couple model, according to the flowchart (Fig. 8) of model, error
    were accumulated in the calculation, as a result data points deviated slightly
    from 1:1 line in the linear regression, especially during period with high temperatures.

    the re-greening, early tillering, middle tillering, later tillering, jointing
    and booting, heading to flowering, milk and yellow ripening stage, respectively).
    In typical days, the diurnal variation of Ts-10 showed a cosine fluctuation pattern.
    The daily temperature range is greater on sunny days than that on cloudy days
    (see Fig. 23a and b), and the degree to match a cosine line in daily variation
    became less obvious with the decrease of daily temperature range in cloudy days.
    Overall, the simulated Ts-10 agreed well with observed values. However, the overestimation
    or underestimation of the simulated values were not consistent in different weather
    conditions during the same growth period, which was closely related to the soil
    moisture content. The simulated values were generally greater than measured values
    on both sunny and cloudy days, especially during the days (July 11th, 23th, August
    21th, October 24th and 27th) with shallow flooding water maintained. A possible
    explanation might be the flooding water consumes a part of energy for water heating
    and evaporation, and the corresponding energy reaching the soil surface decreases.
    However, the thermal storage in surface water was not considered in the simulation,
    so the simulated Ts-10 was higher than the actual value. It was also found that
    when θ was lower than θf (August 3th and September 1th), the simulated Ts-10 was
    smaller than the measured value, and for θf < θ < θs, the model showed a good
    performance on Ts-10 simulation. Generally, diurnal variation of simulated Tc
    varied in the consistent pattern with measured Tc on typical sunny and cloudy
    days, but the former fluctuated more sharply (see Fig. 23c and d). The fluctuation
    magnitude of Tc was larger than that of Ts-10, means it is more sensitive to the
    change of air temperature. The error of simulated Tc was due to the fact that
    the result of Tc estimation was based on estimation of Hs and Ts-10, and the result
    reflected the cumulative error of Hs and Ts-10 to a certain extent. In addition,
    the gap between the simulated and measured data were more obvious in the early
    growth stage, due to the low canopy coverage. Tc measured by infrared thermometer
    suffered from lack of representative for a sparse canopy, which partially accounted
    for the error between the measured and the simulated temperature. The temporal
    variation of daily Ts-10 and Tc were depicted in Fig. 24. The simulated daily
    Tc agreed well in temporal variation with the measured Tc while the consistency
    between the simulated Ts-10 and observed ones was relatively low, mainly influenced
    by the flooding water in rice growth stage. Ts-10 and Tc were both largely affected
    by Rn, and the curves of their seasonal variation were basically the same as Rn
    too. On daily scale, R2 and RMSE were 0.867 and 1.679 °C for Ts-10 and 0.971 and
    0.929 °C for Tc, respectively, and IOA values were close to 1, with values of
    0.959 and 0.989, respectively. It indicated that the novel coupled model performed
    very well at daily step in calculating Tc, possible because that the underestimate
    and overestimate of Tc occurred in the same day offset each other when Tc was
    calculated at daily step. 5. Conclusions Hydrological cycle components as well
    as energy cycle components at hourly and daily scales in the WSI rice field were
    simulated and analyzed by using a holistic recursive model of water-heat coupling,
    which was proposed in the current study, and the goodness–of–fit parameters were
    presented for WSI rice fields. In general, less easy available input variables
    were needed in the coupled model. One major advantage for the water-heat coupling
    model in WSI rice field was that takes the specific wetting-drying cycle condition
    into consideration in the calculation of the rc and the recursive process of the
    model. Variations in LAI, hc and meteorology were considered, but the complex
    process of crop growth was not. Additionally, temperatures (Ts-0, Ts-10 and Tc)
    in the SPAC system were modeled with five steps proposed by this study, which
    was linked to the aerodynamic transport theory and the calculation of soil heat
    storage based on soil temperature and moisture data. Notably, the model was established
    and calibrated based on the measured values, there are few empirical parameters.
    Thus, the novel model developed with the estimated parameters from this study
    consisted of a framework for water-heat status simulations performed in the SPAC
    system at hourly and daily steps in view of its accuracy and applicability. The
    model will capable in predicting results beyond the current literature data so
    long as inputs are available, and can be a reference for model development for
    other crops in future. Acknowledgements This work was supported by the National

    The global agricultural sector is increasingly pressured to adopt sustainable
    practices and reduce its environmental impact. In this context, greenhouses play
    a crucial role in enabling year-round crop production, ensuring food security,
    and minimizing reliance on traditional open-field farming. However, the energy
    consumption associated with greenhouse operations poses a significant challenge
    to achieving sustainability goals. As a result, there is a growing emphasis on
    transitioning greenhouses towards near-zero energy consumption. Near-zero energy
    consumption in greenhouses refers to the ambitious objective of minimizing energy
    usage to the greatest extent possible while maintaining optimal growing conditions
    for crops. This goal encompasses reducing energy consumption for heating, cooling,
    lighting, and other operational needs, as well as exploring renewable energy sources
    to power greenhouse operations. This review article offers a comprehensive overview
    of greenhouse energy consumption, with the main goal of analyzing the present
    situation, identifying key challenges, exploring potential opportunities, and
    proposing future perspectives for decreasing energy usage in greenhouse environments.
    As the focus on sustainable agricultural practices grows, the need to reduce energy
    consumption in greenhouses becomes increasingly important. The review critically
    examines current technological models and strategies applied in smart greenhouse
    applications, as well as the monitoring of microclimatic conditions inside the
    greenhouse, encompassing factors such as temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, soil
    quality, and crop cultivation. Moreover, it aims to present existing literature
    that investigates the advancement of greenhouses toward achieving significant
    reductions in energy consumption. Keywords Smart Greenhouse; Optimization; Control;

    paper First Online: 25 April 2018 911 Accesses Part of the book series: IFIP Advances
    in Information and Communication Technology ((IFIPAICT,volume 507)) Abstract APSIDE
    is an optimization model capable of simulating irrigation hydrology and agricultural
    production under saline conditions. The model has been used in the past to predict
    future agricultural production under future climate change in the San Joaquin
    River Basin of California (Quinn et al. 2004). In this study the model was used
    to query the results from a highly-regarded, published regional surface-groundwater
    flow model of the Central Valley of California – CVHM (Faunt et al. 2009) which
    includes the San Joaquin Basin. The APSIDE model was updated using recent aquifer
    and climate data and provided common initial conditions to allow a 53 year comparative
    simulation of the models. Model outputs for individual water districts for parameters
    such as deep percolation and upflux in APSIDE were compared to identical drained
    subareas within the CVHM model. The comparison showed that the APSIDE model produced
    lower values of deep percolation and upflux than CVHM. CVHM’s deep percolation
    values were 18% higher in Panoche WD, 40% higher in Broadview WD, 68% higher in
    San Luis WD, and 46% higher in Pacheco WD. Unlike the CVHM model that assumes
    fixed levels of irrigation and drainage technology and static average water district
    irrigation efficiency APSIDE will substitute more cost effective irrigation and
    drainage technologies based on the calculated future benefit stream relative to
    the cost of production and impact of salinity on crop yields. An unpublished recent
    update to the current CVHM model (CVHM-2) which substitutes actual irrigation
    diversion records from delivery canals rather than usually-reliable Agency records
    - produced water district irrigation diversions that were approximately 50% of
    the previously provided diversion data. The new model produces water district
    aquifer recharge estimates that correlate closely with APSIDE model output. This
    study demonstrates the successful use of a complementary agricultural production
    optimization and hydro-salinity simulation model to help validate a radical and
    important update to a widely distributed and well-accepted regional flow groundwater
    model. You have full access to this open access chapter,  Download conference
    paper PDF 1 Introduction In California, agriculture is the largest user of water,
    an important source of employment and income for many regions, and source of tax
    revenues for the state. Statewide irrigated agriculture revenues are approximately
    $22 billion per year (www.opr.ca.gov) supporting 300,000 to 450,000 jobs. The
    population of California is forecast to exceed 65 million by 2050, implying significant
    increases in urban water demand and use. Further complicating the picture is an
    increasing awareness of the importance of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta as
    a key ecosystem for native fish and the importance of water quality, particularly
    salinity, in developing long-term sustainability plans for the Region. The use
    of surface and groundwater simulation models that incorporate economics can be
    useful for policy analysis and to help balance competing uses for water supply
    and protecting water quality. An ideal integrated modeling framework incorporates
    the dynamics of the interaction between the environment, urban and agricultural
    stakeholders providing a decision analysis tool for evaluating the economic benefits
    and costs of water policies and policy-induced changes to the current system (Howitt
    et al. 2010). This paper describes the use of a unique hydro-salinity and economic
    simulation tool APSIDE (Agricultural Production Salinity Irrigation Drainage Economics),
    capable of simulating agricultural production and land use in the salinity-impacted
    western San Joaquin Valley of California, to query the results from a widely-accepted
    regional flow model of the Central Valley (Sacramento and San Joaquin Basins),
    developed by the US Geological Survey (USGS). This study also serves to validate
    preliminary results from a recent update to the USGS Central Valley Hydrologic
    Model (CVHM), based on raw diversion data obtained from the Water Authority charged
    with operating the water distribution system rather than the water agency traditionally
    charged with furnishing this data to the public. Hydrological models used for
    planning, studies around the world often achieve legacy status – the datasets
    used to calibrate and validate these models are rarely questioned, especially
    when the models are developed by science-based institutions such as the US Geological
    Survey in the USA. Although subsequent studies by other agencies, universities
    and consultants may produce anomalous results – such is the inertia of the model
    development and review process that these models become a de-facto “gold standard”
    against which other modeling efforts are compared. Some datasets such as crop
    coefficients used for computation of crop-based evapotranspiration are based on
    experiments that are decades old and crop cultivars that have since been replaced
    by more robust and drought-tolerant strains. Similarly, methods for flow estimation
    in canals and at diversion structures have been replaced by more advanced acoustic
    Doppler technologies that provide more accurate accounting. Greater use of complementary
    modeling and simulation tools can help to challenge the validity of certain datasets
    and assumptions made in these important legacy models leading to improved outcomes.
    2 Background Technological innovation does not typically succeed without being
    cost effective – hence the consideration of economics is paramount to guide basin-scale
    water quality management. The most obvious technology solutions involve: (a) increasing
    irrigation efficiency by re-using drain water to blend with good irrigation water;
    (b) growing salt-tolerant crops; (c) improve on-farm drainage management. One
    can also fallow or retire the land and sell the water, or utilize the assimilative
    capacity of the San Joaquin River in a coordinated fashion to discharge limited
    amounts of salt load without exceeding salinity objectives. A changing climate
    can have an effect on water availability as well as temperature, which in turn
    can have an effect on plant yields.. Understanding water availability and water
    quality, in particular, is critical to understanding long-term agricultural production
    in the San Joaquin Valley. The west-side of the San Joaquin River Basin (SJRB)
    receives limited rainfall and relies on additional water supply from the Delta
    to meet the needs of irrigated agriculture. Salts are imported with irrigation
    water - changing water availability and water salinity can have a direct effect
    on yields. Applied irrigation water is subject to the processes of direct evaporation
    from the soil surface and transpiration from the crop. Pure water is evaporated,
    leaving behind the salts in irrigation water. Over time, these salts can accumulate
    in the soil and groundwater and can affect agricultural yields. Excess water can
    leach out salts in soil profile - however excess water is limited in the SJRB
    to effect this leaching. Schoups et al. (2005) showed a steady cumulative increase
    in net salt in SJRB soils and groundwater – which has the potential to diminish
    irrigation sustainability. To address salinization related problems on the west-side
    of the SJRB - drainage management measures have been suggested as follows: Reduction
    of deep percolation (the downward movement of water below the root zone, past
    drains to the local groundwater system) through the adoption of water conserving
    irrigation technologies and practices, better irrigation scheduling and changes
    in cropping practices (Grismer 1990). Reuse of drain water, through the use of
    salt-tolerant crops and agro-forestry. Manipulation of the water table to meet
    part of the crop evapotranspiration requirements. Conjunctive use of groundwater
    to meet a portion of crop needs. Improved instrumentation and monitoring systems
    to produce accurate and timely information and improve access to this information
    by growers. Development and installation of real-time monitoring systems to progressively
    evaluate changes in soil and water quality in the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems
    over time. High irrigation efficiencies may actually lead to higher concentrations
    of salt in deep percolation. Efficient irrigation methods are those with deep
    percolation of less than 10% of the irrigation applied water (Hanson et al. 2014).
    Doneen (1967) reported that in the SJRB the salinity of soils covered with native
    vegetation is generally lower than soils in irrigated areas. Irrigation water
    normally contains from 0.06 to 3.95 tons of salt per acre-ft of water (1 ton/acre-ft = 0.82
    kg/m3) and crop requirements are between 2.03 to 3.05 acre-ft/acre (1 acre-ft/acre = 3048
    m3/hectare) to fulfill evaporation requirements. Thus, this amount of irrigation
    water may add approximately from 0.12 to 1.29 tons of salts/acre (1 ton/acre = 2242
    kg/ha) annually anywhere (Rhoades and Suarez 1977). Groundwater can become degraded
    by salinity through irrigated agricultural practices by three process (1) salt
    concentrated is due to the uptake of water by plant, (2) salt moves down from
    the unsaturated zone into groundwater (saturated zone) because of leaching and
    mixing of subsurface saline water with higher quality groundwater and (3) enhanced
    percolation of saline water into the lower zone as a result of groundwater pumping
    for irrigation. (Suarez 1989, Tanjii 1990). 3 Modeling of Hydrosalinity in West-Side
    Irrigated Agriculture A state-of-the-art model known as the Central Valley Hydrologic
    Model, (CVHM) was developed by the US Geological Survey (USGS) and simulates the
    effects of hydraulic conductivity, irrigation, streamflow losses, wells, and other
    parameters on groundwater flow (Faunt et al. 2009). The CVHM model application
    uses the recently published FORTRAN hydrologic code, MODFLOW-OWHM which contains
    the Farm Management Process – a pre-processor that simulates agricultural irrigation
    hydrology (Hanson et al. 2014). This model was created and calibrated using historic
    observations, calculations, and measurements of the factors affecting hydrology,
    including geological and meteorological data from April 1961 until December 2013.
    Canal diversions to individual water districts were obtained from the Central
    Valley Operations Office of the US Bureau of Reclamation which has been providing
    this data to the public for many decades as is considered the most reliable source
    of this information. The model divides the valley into one- mile (1.6 km) square
    cells which form a grid 98 cells wide and 441 cells long. The grid is also 10
    layers deep in the vertical dimension, enabling the user to analyze subsurface
    water flow separately from surface water flow. Models such as CVHM have been used
    for long-term planning studies provided a suite of realistic future conditions
    can be developed including future hydrologic conditions, land use, agricultural
    production and regulatory constraints on agricultural production. However models
    such as CVHM assume static conditions for irrigation management and technology.
    Since detailed water district cropping data has typically only been publicly available
    in 5–7 year intervals (now available annually) models such as CVHM have typically
    also assumed static cropping mixes within each modeled subarea. More realistic
    tracking of agricultural production on the west-side of the SJRB requires a simulation
    tool that recognizes relationships between crop markets and costs of production,
    the impacts of investments in improved irrigation and drainage technologies on
    irrigation hydrology and soil salinity and the relationship between soil salinity
    and crop yield (Maas and Hoffman 1977) which can promote crop substitution over
    time to more salt tolerant crops and crop cultivars. The APSIDE (Agricultural
    Production-Salinity-Drainage-Economics) Model (Figs. 1a and 1b) fulfills this
    purpose allowing more realistic future irrigation hydrology projections to be
    made on the west-side of the SJRB. APSIDE was used in this study to develop comparative
    irrigation hydrology, drainage and aquifer recharge estimates over a 53 year simulation
    period. Fig. 1. (a) APSIDE conceptual model for flow showing parameters and variables
    listed in GAMS notation. Lateral flow between adjacent water districts are simulated
    as “equations of motion” or head-dependent fluxes between the centroids of each
    subarea. Full size image Fig. 1. (b) APSIDE conceptual models for salinity showing
    parameters and variables listed in GAMS notation. Lateral movement of salt between
    adjacent water districts is driven by the hydrology and hydraulic flux between
    the centroids of each area. Full size image 3.1 APSIDE Model Features Resource
    analysts face a fundamental difficulty in modeling regional production activities:
    simplifications used to keep a model manageable by reducing computation and data
    requirements also prevent it from reproducing the variety and proportions of activities
    actually observed (Hatchett et al. 1989). These simplifications also often omit
    important cost differences that influence production patterns. Flexibility constraints
    can force regional activities to approximate observed levels, but then these constraints
    prevent the model from adjusting very much to policy changes. APSIDE is an agricultural
    production optimization model, written in the GAMS language (GAMS 1998), that
    simulates hydrology and salinity (Figs. 1a and 1b) on the west-side of the SJRB.
    The model proved useful for understanding water resource utilization in the San
    Joaquin basin in response to potential future climate change and long term surface
    water allocations within the federal Central Valley Project service area (Quinn
    et al. 2004). The motivation for enhancing and updating the APSIDE model is to
    provide a decision tool that simulates long-term agricultural production taking
    into consideration the availability of groundwater resources, the cost of pumping
    and the impacts of salinity in groundwater pumpage. The genesis of the APSIDE
    model were two models - the Statewide Agricultural Production model (SWAP), which
    forecasts future agricultural production as a function of commodity price projections,
    anticipated changes in the costs of production and surface water supply availability
    and the Westside Agricultural Drainage Economics Model (WADE), which makes projections
    of future agricultural drainage and farm income resulting from policies that affect
    agricultural production and investments in irrigation and drainage technology
    (Hatchett et al. 1989). The agricultural production simulation algorithms utilize
    a technique known as Positive Mathematical Programming (PMP), which can reproduce
    observed activities quite precisely without a large increase in required data
    and without restricting the model’s ability to shift activities as conditions
    change (Howitt 1995). The PMP technique relies on the concept of dual variables,
    or shadow prices, to infer otherwise unobserved cost differences among activities.
    A PMP model of regional crop production is implemented in two stages. The first,
    or calibration, stage is a traditional programming model which restricts crop
    acreage to observed levels. The dual values associated with the acreage constraints
    are the marginal changes in the objective (usually net revenue) function from
    small changes in the constraints. The dual values are positive when the constraints
    force a lower acreage of a particular crop than an unrestricted model would calculate
    (and negative when the constraints force a higher acreage). The second stage of
    PMP re-solves the first stage model after making two important changes. First,
    the crop acreage constraints are removed. Then the dual values from the calibration
    stage are used to calculate a linear marginal cost function for each crop activity.
    Integrating the marginal cost gives a total cost quadratic in crop acreages. The
    quadratic form is then appended to the objective function. The cost function intercept
    and slope values for each crop and region, obtained for the PMP algorithm during
    calibration of the APSIDE model are used to estimate proxy crop activity levels
    at the beginning of each year simulated by the model. The PMP algorithm will duplicate
    the crop mix from the restricted calibration model and will also allow smooth
    changes in crop levels as conditions or policies change. Five proxy crops were
    considered in the APM; alfalfa (including hay and seed crops, rice, irrigated
    pasture); trees, fruits and nuts (almonds, apples, apricots, olives, peaches,
    walnuts, pistachios, grapes, nectarines, oranges); row crops (cotton, sugarbeets,
    processing tomatoes, corn, sorghum); grain crops (wheat, barley, oats.) and vegetable
    crops (beans, melons, lettuce, spinach, onions, garlic, broccoli, peas). These
    proxy crops are assigned average hydrologic characteristics of the group they
    represent. The PMP cost function were calculated separately for overspecialized
    and under-specialized crops grown in the study subareas. Overspecialized crops
    are those which are so profitable that greater quantities would be produced according
    to the model than would normally be observed. Hence an increment was added to
    the production costs of these crops to lower their activity to the observed marginal
    profitability levels. Conversely, incremental increases in revenue were added
    to the production of under-specialized crops in order to match the observed marginal
    values. The increments added are not fixed, but rather vary in quadratic fashion
    with crop acreage. For the SWAP and WADE models - the agricultural production
    submodels considered the summer (irrigation) season and the winter (rain and pre-irrigation)
    season of each year, interacting sequentially with the hydrology and salinity
    models. In the APSIDE model the sequential seasonal hydrology and salinity models
    were transformed into a discrete monthly timestep hydrosalinity submodel that
    solves simultaneously in order to capture more of the complexity of irrigation
    hydrology and water quality within the SJRB - where water supply to agriculture
    is subject to frequent perturbations in water quality. This has allowed the APSIDE
    model to be used in the past in integrated model-based planning studies of the
    Basin that consider future potential climate change (Quinn et al. 2004). 3.2 Comparison
    of Model Simulations The APSIDE model was run for a period of 53 years for four
    water districts in the Grasslands Subarea on the west-side of the SJRB (Fig. 2).
    The APSIDE model application used the same water table, cropping and irrigation
    water use efficiency initial conditions as the USGS CVHM (Faunt et al. 2009) model.
    In the APSIDE model aquifer characteristic data such as aquifer hydraulic conductivity,
    specific yield and storativity was averaged (lumped) for each water district in
    the study –whereas CVHM can assign unique values for each one mile square model
    cell. Fig. 2. Water districts within the salinity impacted study area on the west-side
    of the SJRB, California. Results from Panoche, Pacheco, Broadview and San Luis
    Water Dis-tricts are the subject of the analysis in this study. Full size image
    The APSIDE and CVHM model outputs for deep percolation and upward capilliary flow
    were compared. These outputs are the most important factors impacting water tables,
    tile drainage, soil salinity and crop yield. The comparison showed that, on average,
    APSIDE produced lower values of deep percolation and groundwater upward capilliary
    flow (upflux) than CVHM (Fig. 3). On average, CVHM’s deep percolation estimates
    were 26% higher in Panoche WD, 12.9% higher in Broadview WD, 45.3% higher in San
    Luis WD, and 51.3% higher in Pacheco WD (Fig. 4). (Broadview gets no surface water
    deliveries having sold their federal water rights to an adjacent water district
    more than a decade ago). Upflux estimates are similarly higher for the CVHM model
    (Fig. 5) – Pacheco WD shows the greatest difference between CVHM and APSIDE model
    estimates. Water deliveries (canal diversions) to each of these water districts
    were derived from publicly available US Bureau of Reclamation Central Valley Operations
    bulletins. Fig. 3. Comparative results using APSIDE and CVHM models showing more
    real-istic deep percolation estimates using APSIDE agricultural production optimization
    algorithms using PMP. Full size image Fig. 4. Comparison of deep percolation estimates
    between CVHM and APSIDE models. Higher deep percolation rates raise water levels,
    increasing subsurface drain-age discharge production and salt load export to the
    San Joaquin River. Full size image Fig. 5. Comparison of groundwater upflux estimates
    between CVHM and APSIDE models – higher groundwater upflux increases precipitation
    of salt in the crop root zone. Full size image The APSIDE model bases water deliveries
    on water requirements which in turn are based on crop selection and irrigation
    management technology and practices. Hence differences in the APSIDE and CVHM
    model estimates can be ascribed either to the inability of the CVHM model to track
    changes in crop selection and irrigation water use efficiency resulting from changes
    in crop root zone salinity or to problems in the reported irrigation water deliveries
    (diversions) to each water district. One of the novel features of the APSIDE model
    is its ability to adapt irrigation and drainage technologies in response to production
    costs, the water saving potential of improved techniques and salt load discharge
    constraints that limit the export of salts to the San Joaquin River. As the cost
    of drainage disposal increases over time the APSIDE model substitutes more water
    conserving irrigation technologies such as sprinkler and drip irrigation for furrow
    and basin flooding techniques – improving irrigation water use efficiency over
    time. Using the same irrigation diversion data the APSIDE model still derived
    optimal yields and farm income by reducing irrigation application resulting in
    deep percolation rates that were as much as 50% lower than those produced by CVHM.
    The deep percolation values in APSIDE and CVHM were further compared to reported
    data from Panoche and Pacheco Water Districts. Pacheco Water District reported
    year 2010 deep percolation values of 1770 acre-feet on 4080 acres of irrigated
    land (Panoche Water District 2015). This corresponds to a deep percolation of
    0.43 acre-feet per acre. This aligns fairly closely to APSIDE’s predicted value
    of 0.42 acre-feet per acre for Pacheco Water District (Westcot et al. 1994). 3.3
    CVHM-2 Diversion Data Update Difficulties in obtaining good model calibration
    for the west-side of the San Joaquin Valley in CVHM, particularly in the simulation
    of subsurface tile drainage, prompted the USGS to seek better quality data as
    part of the development of an updated simulation model of the Central Valley CVHM-2.
    The new model increased the number of vertical layers from 10 to 13, improved
    the accuracy of cropping data by incorporating data obtained directly from water
    districts and substituted public records from the US Bureau of Reclamation’s Central
    Valley Operations office for raw canal turnout records compiled by the Water Authority
    responsible for daily operations along the Delta Mendota Canal – the main conveyance
    for federal water deliveries. These data had to be further processed to associate
    each irrigation turnout with a delivery point within each water district subarea.
    Preliminary (unpublished) model results shared by colleagues in the USGS have
    shown that average water diversions to the water districts that were the subject
    of this study decreased up almost 50%. Similarly the CVHM-2 model estimates of
    aquifer deep percolation were reduced by an equivalent amount. These same colleagues
    report that the CVHM-2 model achieved a better calibration for west-side San Joaquin
    Valley hydrology than the original CVHM model – much of it ascribed to the more
    realistic diversion data. These results correlate much more closely with the results
    from the APSIDE model. 4 Summary and Conclusions The time and effort involved
    in developing comprehensive regional surface and groundwater simulation models
    often confers a legacy status to these models whereby they become the “gold standard”
    against which subsequent modeling studies are compared. This is accompanied by
    a reluctance or “inertia” to revisit model assumptions or the data used to develop
    the model – even though these further studies might suggest fundamental problems.
    The use of complementary simulation models and analytical tools to test assumptions
    and the conceptual hydrology underlying these legacy models has significant, unrealized
    potential to promote better outcomes and result in more accurate decision tools.
    This study has provided an exemplar of the use of a simple agricultural production
    optimization and hydro-salinity simulation model that utilizes a unique normative
    calibration technique to allow realistic simulation of future changes in agricultural
    land use and investments in irrigation and drainage technology over long-term
    planning horizons. The PMP algorithm allows substitution of irrigation and drainage
    technologies while calibrating crop production shifts to field observations –
    capturing some of the socioeconomic factors known to effect on-farm decision making.
    The APSIDE model can be applied to any problem involving irrigated crop production
    under saline conditions provided data are available for annual cropping and the
    costs of irrigation and drainage technology substitution are available. Soil and
    aquifer characteristic data including root zone and aquifer salinity data are
    also needed. References Doneen, L.D.: Quality of percolating waters, I. properties

    an essential natural resource for human existence and survival on the earth. South
    Africa, a water stressed country, allocates a high percentage of its available
    consumptive water use to irrigation. Therefore, it is necessary that we optimize

    \ for water resources among agricultural, municipal, and industrial sectors is\
    \ \nincreasing even in a traditionally water rich state like Louisiana. Irrigation\
    \ water management is \nlikely to be a critical issue in Louisiana in the near\
    \ future. We conducted state-wide farm surveys \nto collect information regarding\
    \ irrigation practices and concerns from Louisiana farmers during \nthe crop years\
    \ 2015 and 2016. \nWe analyzed three different issues associated with irrigation\
    \ water management in \nLouisiana crop production. These analyses are presented\
    \ in the form of three different essays. \nThe first essay identifies the determinants\
    \ of irrigation technology adoption and crop acreage \nallocation by Louisiana\
    \ farmers. The estimated results, using a multivariate fractional regression \n\
    model, indicated that education, the extension service, and risk aversion had\
    \ negative effects, \nwhereas landholding, laser leveling, and rent status had\
    \ a positive association with furrow \nirrigation acreage allocation. Similarly,\
    \ IV-probit estimates showed that educational attainment, \nlaser leveling, and\
    \ landholding were the major factors affecting irrigation technology adoption.\
    \ \nIn the second essay, we identify the irrigation efficiency of Louisiana soybean\
    \ farmers. \nEstimated results using stochastic frontier analysis showed that\
    \ the average irrigation \ninefficiency in Louisiana was about 12%. Farmers can\
    \ reduce the level of inefficiency by \nreducing the input level or by increasing\
    \ the output without altering the current level of input. \nThe efficiency score\
    \ obtained from data envelopment analysis is lower than that obtained from \n\
    the stochastic frontier analysis.  \nIn the third essay, we analyzed willingness\
    \ to pay and willingness to accept values for \nirrigation. Results showed that\
    \ the farmers who had more rented land, higher gross farm revenue, \nand were\
    \ older were less likely to be involved in water trading. However, farmers with\
    \ higher \nxi \n \neducation and more owned land were more likely to participate\
    \ in irrigation water trading. Our \nstudy implies that policy makers and the\
    \ United States Department of Agriculture can develop an \nincentive structure\
    \ to motivate farmers to adopt surge valves, moisture sensors, flow meters, and\
    \ \ncomputerized scheduling to increase irrigation efficiency.\n1 \n \nCHAPTER\
    \ 1. INTRODUCTION TO THE ESSAYS \n1.1 Introduction \nIrrigation water is globally\
    \ the most critical resource for the agricultural production process. \nIrrigation\
    \ water management mainly aims to minimize the volume of water applied and the\
    \ \nirrigation frequency, maintaining the water requirement for crops while conserving\
    \ the water \nresources applied on per unit area. Although Louisiana is rich in\
    \ water as a resource, competition \nfor water among the agricultural, domestic,\
    \ and industrial sectors is increasing. The future \ncompetition for water seems\
    \ likely to become more intense due to the fact that fresh water \ndemand continues\
    \ to increase, in order to meet the needs of a growing population, accommodate\
    \ \nexpansion in the agricultural area, and due to expanded industry use, while\
    \ the supply-side would \nbe constrained by drought and the sea level rise caused\
    \ by climate change. \nCoastal aquifers are equally under stress primarily due\
    \ to saltwater intrusion into the \nfreshwater bodies. In this situation the farming\
    \ sector in some areas, especially those near to \ncoastal areas (for example,\
    \ the Chicot aquifer in Louisiana), might be affected significantly. In \nsuch\
    \ cases, irrigation water management might be a critical issue. Assessing the\
    \ information \nregarding irrigation practices among farmers would allow us to\
    \ analyze the irrigation-related \nissues and suggest some policy implications\
    \ that might be helpful in managing water resources in \nan efficient way. For\
    \ instances, efficient irrigation technology adoption can help to conserve \n\
    water resources per unit area, which has the potential to create a market for\
    \ water trade. \nAppropriate irrigation scheduling can help to minimize water\
    \ loss, energy use, and non-point \nsource water pollution.    \n \n \n2 \n \n\
    1.1.1 Groundwater scenario in the U.S. and Louisiana  \nDuring the period between\
    \ 1900 and 2008, the volume of groundwater decreased in the U.S. by \naround 1000\
    \ cubic km. The aquifer systems with the largest volume of storage depletion are\
    \ the \nHigh Plains aquifer, the Mississippi Embayment section of the Gulf Coastal\
    \ Plain aquifer, and \nthe Central Valley Aquifer System of California (Konikow,\
    \ 2015). During the period from 2001-\n2008, the highest depletion of groundwater\
    \ occurred in the High Plains aquifer (10.2 km3/year) \nand the Mississippi Embayment\
    \ (8 km3/year). The time-averaged depletion for the United States \nincreased\
    \ to 23.9 km3 as opposed to 13.6 km3 during the last half of the 20th century.\
    \  \n \nGroundwater withdrawal to supplement surface water to meet agricultural\
    \ water demand \nis one of the reasons for the decline in groundwater levels around\
    \ the Mississippi River valley \nand the High Plains aquifer (Ho et al., 2016).\
    \ As of 2003, groundwater supplies about 40 percent \nof the nation’s public-water\
    \ supply; much of the water is used for irrigation purposes (USGS, \n2003).1 In\
    \ several hydrologic units across the United States, groundwater outflow exceeds\
    \ \ninflow, resulting in a water table decline, as noted by Hemmerling et al.\
    \ (2016). Groundwater \ndepletion have many detrimental effects on water quality,\
    \ agricultural production, water \nsustainability, and the aquatic ecosystem.\
    \ Increased depletion of groundwater induces the \nlowering of the water table\
    \ and thus increases pumping cost. The consequence of lowering the \nwater table\
    \ due to excessive groundwater pumping and accelerating sea level rise at the\
    \ same \ntime would enhance the likelihood of saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers,\
    \ leading to water \nquality deterioration.      \nGroundwater supplies about\
    \ 84% of the agricultural water used in Louisiana, and \nexcessive groundwater\
    \ pumping may have many consequences for Louisiana agriculture. A \n         \
    \                                                  \n1 USGS Fact Sheet 103-03,\
    \ November 2003 (available at https://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/fs-103-03/#pdf). \n3 \n\
    \ \nstudy conducted by Anderson and Al-Thani (2016) shows the impact of increased\
    \ groundwater \nsalinity in the Gulf Coast aquifer on agriculture and the socioeconomic\
    \ status of coastal \ncommunities and points out the increased need for a water\
    \ management system to limit \ngroundwater use. Indeed, the Louisiana legislature\
    \ recognizes the need for uniformity in the \nestablishment of a comprehensive\
    \ groundwater management program so that the state would \nhave exclusive jurisdiction\
    \ over the management of groundwater (LAWRC, 2018).2 It recognizes \nthe historic\
    \ use of groundwater resources in the state and may incorporate the use of appropriate\
    \ \nincentives to encourage the conservation of groundwater resources and the\
    \ appropriate utilization \nof alternate water supplies where appropriate.  \n\
    According to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS, 2011), surface water withdrawals\
    \ in \nLouisiana decreased by 20%, whereas groundwater withdrawal increased by\
    \ 2% in 2010 \ncompared to the year 2005.  Louisiana has been gifted with an abundance\
    \ of high-quality water \nresources that have been thought to be a limitless commodity.\
    \ Due to this fact, from time to time \nits overabundance has been a more critical\
    \ concern than in its absence. However, this impression \nhas changed in recent\
    \ periods due to the fact that an increased demand for groundwater is putting\
    \ \npressure on aquifer systems, as indicated by many studies and reports concerning\
    \ the fragility of \naquifer systems and the interdependence of groundwater and\
    \ surface water. \nExtreme drought conditions and significantly increased groundwater\
    \ withdrawal has put \nstress on the aquifer system. For example, the prolonged\
    \ 2011 drought had a significant impact \non Ouachita River levels in northeast\
    \ Louisiana and rice farms in the southwest. During that \nperiod, Ouachita River\
    \ flows fell below those used in the establishment of the authorized \nwastewater\
    \ discharge limit, and it was estimated that 40,000 to 80,000 acres of irrigated\
    \ rice \n                                                           \n2 Louisiana\
    \ Water Resources Commission (LAWRC), Report on Activities, April 2018. State\
    \ of \nLouisiana Department of Natural Resources. \n4 \n \nfields in Vermilion\
    \ Parish would have been at risk if the intrusion of saltwater within canals had\
    \ \nnot been stopped (LAGRC, 2012). In fact, irrigation is essential for rice\
    \ which is more sensitive \nto salinity than other crops. Prolonged drought conditions\
    \ may create pressure on the aquifer \nsystem, and so precautionary action needs\
    \ to be taken in order to conserve groundwater. For \nexample, the Louisiana Office\
    \ of Conservation declared a temporary groundwater emergency for \ntwo areas of\
    \ southern Caddo Parish in north Louisiana due to severe drought in 2011.  \n\
    Combined efforts by government, the public, and other concerned people is needed\
    \ to \nmanage scarce water resources to meet current and future demand while maintaining\
    \ sustainable \nuse. It is obvious that the ability to manage water resources\
    \ depends on how well we can monitor \nthese resources by gathering information\
    \ concerning consumers’ water usage trends and \npractices. For this purpose,\
    \ we conducted state-level farm surveys to collect information \nregarding irrigation\
    \ practices and the concerns of Louisiana farmers during the crop years 2015 \n\
    and 2016. Our goals are to analyze the factors affecting irrigation technology\
    \ adoption, to assess \nirrigation efficiency, and to evaluate the willingness\
    \ to pay/willingness to accept values for \nirrigation water during critical crop\
    \ growing periods.  \nThe agricultural sector of Louisiana accounts for the usage\
    \ of 54% of groundwater and \n5.4% of surface water as of the year 2010 (USGS,\
    \ 2011). The gross farm value and value-added \nactivities of Louisiana agriculture\
    \ in 2017 were estimated to have a total economic impact of \n$11.8 billion (Richards,\
    \ 2017).3 Agriculture, along with aquaculture, is a very important part of \n\
    Louisiana’s culture and employment. Agriculture employs about 10% of Louisiana’s\
    \ workforce \nand represents a significant portion of the economy of 55% of the\
    \ Louisiana parishes (LAGRC, \n                                              \

    \ \n5 \n \n2012).4 Irrigation water management is necessary to conserve water,\
    \ improve water quality, and \nto optimize producers’ profit. Irrigation water\
    \ heavily relies on groundwater, and the demand is \nincreasing. The expanding\
    \ water demand for municipal, industrial, recreational, and other \npurposes increasingly\
    \ finds these competing for limited available water resources. Improved \nirrigation\
    \ water management can help to reduce water user per unit area through the adoption\
    \ of \nefficient irrigation technologies and proper scheduling. Improved irrigation\
    \ water management \ncan help offset the effect of increasing irrigation cost,\
    \ minimize energy cost, fertilizer use, and \nlabor input, while providing higher\
    \ farm revenues and profits to the farmers. Indeed, farmers \nmay reduce per acre\
    \ water use either by using efficient irrigation technology or by planting less\
    \ \nwater requiring crop varieties. Efficiency can be enhanced by using improved\
    \ irrigation \ntechnology, proper irrigation scheduling, and improved field application\
    \ such as proper land \nlabeling and drainage management.  \n1.1.2 Overview of\
    \ irrigation practices     \nIrrigation patterns and crop productivity in conjunction\
    \ with weather changes, water availability, \nand location have been widely studied.\
    \ Findings of previous studies regarding irrigation \ntechnology adoption, irrigation\
    \ efficiency, and water trading show mixed results depending on \nlocation, water\
    \ rights, and water availability. For example, Blanc et al. (2017) evaluate the\
    \ \ncurrent irrigation sustainability in conjunction with climate change impact\
    \ on water resources \nand irrigated crop yields in the U. S. and find that the\
    \ climate and socioeconomic changes will \nincrease water shortages and strongly\
    \ reduce irrigated yields for some crops such as cotton and \nforage in specific\
    \ regions like the southwest U.S.  Olen et al. (2016) estimate an irrigation \n\
    management model for major crops on the West Coast (California, Oregon, and Washington),\
    \ \n                                                           \n4 Managing Louisiana’s\

    \ of technology adoption and water application. They find a \nsignificant impact\
    \ of economic and physical water scarcity, climate, and extreme weather on \n\
    producers’ irrigation decisions. Water application rates are least responsive\
    \ to surface water cost \nor groundwater well depth for producers. Water supply\
    \ institutions influence producers’ \nirrigation decisions. Producers who receive\
    \ water from federal agencies use higher water \napplication rates and are less\
    \ likely to adopt water-saving irrigation technologies for some crops. \nInstitutional\
    \ arrangements, including access to distinct water sources (surface or ground)\
    \ and \nwhether surface water cost is fee-based, also affect the responsiveness\
    \ of water application rates \nto changes in surface water cost (ibid). Mukherjee\
    \ and Schwabe (2015) evaluate the benefits to \nirrigated agricultural farms from\
    \ having access to multiple sources of water (water portfolio) in \nCalifornia\
    \ and find that the lower quality water, less reliable water, and less water all\
    \ negatively \nimpact agricultural land values. Access to a water portfolio has\
    \ a positive impact on land values \nthrough its role in reducing the negative\
    \ aspects by reducing the sensitivity of the farm sector to \nsevere drought and\
    \ water scarcity. Genius et al. (2013) investigate the role of information \n\
    transmission in promoting irrigation technology adoption and diffusion through\
    \ extension \nservices and social learning in Greece. They find extension services\
    \ and social learning to be \nstrong determinants of technology adoption in olive\
    \ production. Koundouri et al. (2006) evaluate \nthe tendency of irrigation technology\
    \ adoption under production uncertainty due to a possible \nwater shortage in\
    \ Greece and find that farmers choose new and efficient irrigation technologies\
    \ \nin order to reduce production risk. Additionally, they note that the farmers’\
    \ human capital plays a \nsignificant role in the decision to adopt new and efficient\
    \ irrigation technologies. Pereira et al. \n(2002) discuss some of the aspects\
    \ associated with on-farm irrigation management and propose \nsome concepts relative\
    \ to water scarcity, concerning aridity, drought, salinity, water scarcity, and\
    \ \n7 \n \npolicies to cope with these water-stressed regimes. Huang et al. (2015)\
    \ explore how rice farmers \nadjust their farm management practices in response\
    \ to extreme weather such as severe drought \nand flooding in China. They find\
    \ that the adoption of farm management measures responding to \nsevere weather\
    \ significantly increases the rice yield.   \n1.1.3 Overview of irrigation in\
    \ Louisiana \nIn the case of Louisiana, the scenario is different in the sense\
    \ that water availability has not been \na major concern to date. However; water\
    \ abundance may not last for long as many studies have \nshown that the aquifer\
    \ systems are under risk due to the decline in the water table, saltwater \nintrusion,\
    \ drought, and sea level rise (Nererm et al., 2018; Hemmerling et al, 2016; and\
    \ Merem et \nal., 2012). Climate change and sea level rise are expected to intensify\
    \ the existing risk in water \nquality and quantity in this region. In order to\
    \ mitigate the risk factors associated with our water \nresources, a sustainable\
    \ water management strategy needs to be implemented. It is well accepted \nthat\
    \ the agricultural sector is one of the largest users of Louisiana’s water resources,\
    \ and the \nnumber of irrigated acres has gone up significantly since 1974. According\
    \ to the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture, the number of irrigated acres has increased\
    \ from 0.7 million in 1974 \nto 1.20 million in 2013. Row crops such as soybeans\
    \ and corn are water-intensive, and their new \nvarieties are even more water\
    \ demanding. According to the LSU AgCenter,5 in order to reach a \nhigher yield,\
    \ many farmers rely on decades-old irrigation methods that use an excessive amount\
    \ \nof water to fulfill crop needs. However, much of the water never touches the\
    \ crops and leaves the \nfield as runoff, carrying soil and expensive fertilizer\
    \ with it. The concern is that we need to \n                                 \

    \ water conservation. Kebede et al. (2014) evaluate the \ncurrent status and strategies\
    \ to improve irrigation efficiency in the Delta region of Mississippi. \nThey\
    \ mention that widespread adoption of efficient irrigation technology and tools\
    \ along with \nirrigation scheduling using soil moisture sensors, surge valves,\
    \ and tailwater recovery can \ntremendously reduce water use, and energy cost\
    \ for producers in the region ensuring the \nsustainable use of water. Farm profitability\
    \ and water resource conservation can be achieved by \nusing efficient irrigation\
    \ and managing the existing irrigation pattern. In response to this, the \nevaluation\
    \ of irrigation technology adoption, irrigation efficiency, and the potentiality\
    \ of \nirrigation water trading could provide a better understanding of developing\
    \ priorities for \nirrigation water management. Appropriate irrigation management\
    \ is essential to optimize crop \nyield, profit, and the sustainable use of water\
    \ resources.  \n1.1.4 Objective of the study \nThis study analyzes three different\
    \ issues associated with irrigation water management in \nLouisiana crop production\
    \ using farm-level survey data. The overall objective of this study is to \nidentify\
    \ factors affecting irrigation technology adoption and acreage allocation, irrigation\
    \ \nefficiency, and the viability of irrigation water trading. Indeed, the ultimate\
    \ goal of irrigation \nmanagement is to maximize farm profit while conserving\
    \ water per unit area.  \nIn the first essay, we identify the determinants of\
    \ irrigation technology adoption and \nacreage allocation. Identification of major\
    \ influencing variables affecting irrigation technology \nadoption provides assistance\
    \ in developing effective irrigation policies aimed at enhancing water \nuse efficiency\
    \ and farm profitability. Indeed, the estimates would provide a basis for promoting\
    \ \nwater conserving technology, which in turn increases farm productivity by\
    \ minimizing acre per \ninch water application.  \n9 \n \nThe second essay is\
    \ associated with the evaluation of irrigation efficiency using the \nstochastic\
    \ frontier analysis and data envelopment analysis approach. Efficiency analysis\
    \ would \nprovide information concerning factors affecting inefficiency in the\
    \ production process. The \ntechnical efficiency and scale efficiency are important\
    \ for evaluating the use of a different \ncombination of factors of production.\
    \ It provides a basis to improve current performance by \nadjusting the input\
    \ factors. Indeed, it would be useful in achieving existing yield or better; by\
    \ \ninput adjustment, potentially producers could get the same level of output\
    \ while minimizing the \ninput cost.  \nThe third essay is related to the willingness\
    \ to pay and willingness to accept values for \nirrigation water during the critical\
    \ crop growing periods. The main objective of this essay is to \nfind the maximum\
    \ willingness to pay value for irrigation water. This essay also evaluates the\
    \ \nreasons for the disparity between willingness to pay and willingness to accept\
    \ values for \nirrigation water. The importance of the third essay would be more\
    \ relevant in the future context \ndue to the fact that water resource management\
    \ seems to be critical because of sea level rise, \nclimate variability, and saltwater\
    \ intrusion as noted by many studies (Anderson et al., 2017; and \nTaylor and\
    \ Alley, 2001). In particular, water trading can be a desirable solution in order\
    \ to \nsupply good quality irrigation water needed for crops in the critical crop\
    \ growing period. Many \nstates in the U.S. and abroad, such as in Australia,\
    \ Chile, and some of the countries in Europe \nand Asia where they are facing\
    \ water crises, practice water trading systems. For future water \ncrisis management,\
    \ water trading among farmers might be an alternative option in Louisiana as \n\
    well.  These issues have not been studied previously in the context of Louisiana.\
    \ Findings of this \nstudy should be helpful to formulate irrigation related policies\
    \ in Louisiana.  \n \n10 \n \n1.1.5 Organization of the dissertation \nThis dissertation\
    \ includes three major essays. After this introduction section, it describes the\
    \ \nsurvey design and data description in chapter 2. Chapter 3 presents the first\
    \ essay which is about \nirrigation technology adoption and acreage allocation\
    \ in Louisiana crop production. Chapter 4 is \nabout estimation and is an evaluation\
    \ of irrigation efficiency in soybean production using \nstochastic frontier analysis\
    \ and data envelopment analysis. Chapter 5 describes the willingness to \npay\
    \ (WTP)/willingness to accept (WTA) values for irrigation water and evaluates\
    \ the reasons for \nthe disparity between WTP and WTA values. Chapter 6 provides\
    \ concluding remarks, \nimplications, and the shortcomings of this dissertation\

    We surveyed soybean farmers with the support from the Louisiana Soybean and Feed\
    \ Grain \nResearch and Promotion Board to collect information related to irrigation\
    \ use in Louisiana. \nIncreased revenue and yield variability caused by lower\
    \ commodity prices, and rising input costs \npoint to the need for agricultural\
    \ producers to continue to effectively manage risk and input \napplications. The\
    \ purpose of this survey was to examine trends and issues surrounding irrigation\
    \ \nas a risk management strategy as used by Louisiana soybean producers. \nThe\
    \ survey questionnaire was designed to obtain information on soybean producers’\
    \ crop \nproduction and irrigation perception and practices during the 2015 crop\
    \ year. The questionnaire \nwas organized into four major sections. The first\
    \ section solicited information about the \nrespondents’ 2015 crop production.\
    \ The second section provided information about the type of \nirrigation systems\
    \ utilized and the costs associated with each system. The third section solicited\
    \ \ninformation regarding general perceptions about the use of irrigation and\
    \ the availability of water \nresources. Lastly, the fourth section consisted\
    \ of basic sociodemographic information.  \nThis survey was conducted in November-December\
    \ 2015 with Louisiana soybean \nproducers following the Dillman’s tailored design\
    \ method (Dillman, 2000). The survey \nquestionnaire was approved by the Louisiana\
    \ State University Agricultural Center Institutional \nReview Board (IRB) during\
    \ the first week of November (see Appendix). In the second week of \nNovember,\
    \ we sent out a pre-notification letter (postcard) to 2,700 Louisiana soybean\
    \ producers. \nOne week after sending out the pre-notification letter, the first\
    \ round of the survey was mailed to \nproducers. However, few responses were received\
    \ from the first round. During the third week of \nDecember, we sent out a reminder/\
    \ thank you postcard as part of the third contact to the soybean \n14 \n \nproducers.\
    \ After one week had elapsed from the second reminder postcard, we mailed out\
    \ the \nsecond round of survey questionnaires to those who did not respond in\
    \ the first round. Out of the \ntotal questionnaires sent out, 268 envelopes were\
    \ returned back due to address error or because \nsome of the farmers retired.\
    \ Considering this sampling adjustment, a total of 158 responses were \nreceived\
    \ from a total survey sample of 2,432, for a response rate of 6.5 percent. Out\
    \ of the total \n158 responses, some of the respondents answered the survey questions\
    \ only partially. The \nsamples received from the survey 2015 crop year were not\
    \ sufficient for empirical analysis. So, \nwe decided to a conduct second round\
    \ of the irrigation survey for the crop year 2016.   \nThe questionnaire for the\
    \ second round of the survey was modified so as to make it \nconvenient to answer.\
    \  A four-page survey questionnaire was designed in a concise form without \n\
    changing the theme of the questionnaire used in the 2015 irrigation survey. The\
    \ second round \nsurvey questionnaire was approved by the LSU AgCenter Institutional\
    \ Review Board (IRB) \nduring the first week of April 2017. Following the Dillman’s\
    \ tailored design method as used in \nthe first round of the survey in 2016 for\
    \ the crop year 2015, we conducted a survey during the \nfirst week of May to\
    \ the first week of June of 2017 in order to collect information on soybean \n\
    irrigation in Louisiana for the crop year 2016. The survey questionnaire, approval\
    \ letter from \nIRB, pre-notification letter, and thank you/reminder letter are\
    \ displayed in the appendix section. \nFor the crop year 2016 irrigation survey,\
    \ we sent out a survey questionnaire to the producers \nlocated in the intensive\
    \ soybean production parishes. We sent out a pre-notification letter \n(postcard)\
    \ to 1,680 Louisiana soybean producers. Out of the total questionnaires sent out,\
    \ 451 \nenvelopes were returned back because of address error or because some\
    \ of the farmers retired. \nFrom the total sample of 1,229, considering the sampling\
    \ adjustment, a total of 123 responses \nwere obtained. The response rate for\
    \ the second round of the survey was 10 percent, 3.5 percent \n15 \n \nmore than\
    \ the first round of the survey conducted for the crop year 2015. Figure 2.1 represents\
    \ \nthe location of the farmland in study area in Louisiana. We received a survey\
    \ response from the \nfarmers with farmland in the shaded regions of Louisiana.\

    \ \nFrom Table 2.1, out of total responses obtained from 163 producers, an average\
    \ of 1167 acres of \nland are irrigated. Similarly, out of total responses obtained\
    \ from 185 producers, an average of \n751 acres are non-irrigated. The average\
    \ owned land in use is 691 acres; whereas, the average of \nrented land in use\
    \ is 1329. The average owned land and rented land which are not in use are 133\
    \ \nand 651 acres, respectively. According to the crop acreage data reported by\
    \ the U.S. Department \nof Agriculture (USDA)6, the total crop planted area in\
    \ Louisiana in 2017 was 4,116,935 acres. \nThe USDA has reported that 69.04% of\
    \ total crop planted acreage is irrigated in the 2017 crop \nyear.  \n \nThe size\
    \ of the farmland holdings range from a very small area to a very big farm. The\
    \ \nmaximum land holding is 30,916 acres. A substantial majority (about 75%) of\
    \ Louisiana \ncropland is still non-irrigated as reported by the USDA (2012).\
    \ Our survey also shows that many \nfarmers do not irrigate their cropland. Studies\
    \ indicate that the increase in profit due to irrigation \n                  \

    \ producers to indicate their \nintentions of whether they were willing to convert\
    \ some of their drylands to irrigated acreage. \nFigure 2.2 presents the response\
    \ regarding their intention to convert dryland to irrigated acreage \nwithin the\
    \ next five years. Out of the total responses (N=122), 31% indicated that they\
    \ were \nwilling to convert some of their drylands to irrigated acreage within\
    \ the next five years. This will \nhave implications for future groundwater extraction\
    \ and aquifer levels in the state.  \n \nFigure 2.2. Willingness to convert dryland\
    \ to irrigated acreage \nFarmers need reliable and relevant information in order\
    \ to improve farm production \nquality and quantity. In the production process,\
    \ irrigation water management and cost \nminimization are important issues. There\
    \ are different sources of information available for \ndisseminating farm education\
    \ information to farmers. However, farmers’ preferences and access \nto information\
    \ systems concerning input management and water resource conservation could be\
    \ \ndifferent than what we generally perceive. For example, Prokopy et al. (2015)\
    \ evaluate the role \nthat the extension can play in facilitating climate change\
    \ adaptation in agriculture using data \nfrom a survey of agricultural advisors\
    \ in Indiana, Iowa, Michigan and Nebraska and a survey of \nextension educators\
    \ in the 12 state North Central Region. Survey responses show that farmers \n\
    are more likely to go to private retailers and consultants for information than\
    \ extension agents. \nHowever, it also shows that private agricultural advisors\
    \ trust extensions as a source of \n31%\n69%\nYes\nNo\n18 \n \ninformation about\
    \ climate change. The importance of farm information is even greater in the \n\
    precision farming system. Indeed, precision farming offers farmers the ability\
    \ to minimize costs, \nincrease profits, and reduce environmental risks by not\
    \ applying more inputs than needed \n(Torbett et al., 2007). Producers can build\
    \ up that ability if they get useful and reliable farm \ninformation. In order\
    \ to access the information system that farmers rely on for irrigation cost \n\
    minimization and water conservation, we asked producers to provide their source\
    \ of information. \nFigure 2.3 displays the producers’ response concerning their\
    \ source of information. \n \nFigure 2.3. Source of information for reducing irrigation\
    \ cost and water conservation \n(Note: ext. = Extension agents or university specialists,\

    \ service plays a major role in disseminating information concerning water conservation\
    \ \nand irrigation cost reduction. The second highest source of information is\

    Optimal irrigation is essential for profitable crop production as both over-irrigation\
    \ and \nunder irrigation affect production negatively. In order to maximize irrigation\
    \ efficiency, proper \nirrigation scheduling is desirable. Optimal scheduling\
    \ helps to maintain soil moisture proportions \nat the desired level by applying\
    \ the right amount of water required for a specific crop at the right \ntime.\
    \ We asked producers to list their preferred methods when scheduling irrigation.\
    \ Farmers’ \nresponses regarding methods utilized in irrigation scheduling are\
    \ presented in Figure 2.4. \n \nFigure 2.4. Methods utilized while scheduling\

    on the condition and appearance of the crops.  Approximately 70 producers mentioned\
    \ that they \nutilize the appearance and feel of soil; only 3 farmers reported\
    \ that they use a computer \nsimulation model for irrigation scheduling. Additionally,\
    \ 19 producers use a soil moisture \nsensing device; 19 respondents schedule by\
    \ setting a time interval following a rain. Very few \nfarmers use plant moisture\
    \ sensing devices, the crop-water evapotranspiration method, the year \nof interval\
    \ setting method, or neighboring farmers’ information for irrigation scheduling.\

    \ prevent them \nfrom implementing improvements in their existing irrigation systems\
    \ and Figure 2.6 represents \nproducers’ responses concerning reasons for not\

    q8a\nq8b\nq8c\nq8d\nq8e\n21 \n \nThere are several issues that constrained improvement\
    \ in the existing irrigation systems. From \nFigure 2.5, around 20% of respondents\
    \ (N=225) mentioned that the physical field or crop type \nlimits system improvement;\
    \ 17% mentioned that benefits received from farm revenue are not \nenough to recover\
    \ implementation cost; 14% mentioned that irrigation system improvement \ninvestigation\
    \ is not their priority; 13% mentioned that they are unable to improve because\
    \ their \nlandlords do not share the costs for system improvement. Among other\
    \ issues, 11% of \nrespondents mentioned uncertainty about future water availability;\
    \ 10% mentioned increased \nmanagement cost; and 10% mentioned that financial\
    \ problems prevent them from system \nimprovement.  \nIn Louisiana, more farmers\
    \ use a furrow irrigation system than a center pivot system. The \npotential reasons\
    \ might be that the furrow irrigation system installation cost is cheaper than\
    \ that \nof the center pivot system, and abundant groundwater availability in\
    \ the region makes them less \nconcerned about water conservation. We asked farmers\
    \ to provide some reasons for not \nconverting from a center pivot system to a\
    \ furrow irrigation system. From figure 2.6, we can see \nthat 34% of the respondents\
    \ (N=143) indicated that their land is not level enough to make \nfurrow/flood\
    \ irrigation effective, 25% mentioned that land leveling is too expensive, 12%\
    \ believe \nthat the center pivot irrigation system is more effective than furrow/flood\
    \ irrigation in terms of \ncrop yield, 6% mentioned that they are more concerned\
    \ about water conservation as a center \npivot system is more efficient for water\
    \ conservation than a furrow/flood system, and 34% \nmentioned  other reasons\
    \ for not converting a center pivot irrigation system to a furrow/flood \nirrigation\
    \ system.  \n \n \n22 \n \n2.2.2 Willingness to pay/accept value and natural resource\
    \ conservation service (NRCS) \nMany states and countries with water shortage\
    \ issues have instituted water trading programs. As \nevidenced (Hammerling et\
    \ al., 2016; and Taylor and Alley, 2001), Louisiana farm producers are \nfacing\
    \ a salt intrusion problem in some MRAA and Chicot aquifers. In order to address\
    \ a \npotential future water crisis, irrigation water trading among the farmers\
    \ within the aquifer may \nbe desirable. For this purpose, we asked producers\
    \ to state their willingness to participate in \nfuture irrigation water trading.\
    \ Figure 2.7 displays the percentage of farmers who are willing to \ntrade irrigation\
    \ water. \n \nFigure 2.7. Willingness to participate in irrigation water trading\
    \ \nFrom Figure 2.7, around 37% of respondents are willing to participate and\
    \ 63% are not willing to \nparticipate in irrigation water trading if such an\
    \ irrigation water trading market establishment \nwould happen in the future.\
    \ Additionally, Table 2.2 displays the descriptive statistics for the \nwillingness\
    \ to pay (WTP) value per acre for different crops and the willingness to accept\
    \ (WTA) \nvalue per acre for not irrigating farms.  \n \n \n \n \n37%\n63%\nYes\n\

    771.366 2955.408 30800 \n \nFrom Table 2.2, we can see that the average WTP value\
    \ for irrigation water is $11.09 for corn, \n$10.12 for soybean, $9.09 for cotton,\
    \ and $11.37 for rice. Similarly, the average WTA value for \nnot irrigating their\
    \ farms is $143.8 per acre, and the average number of acres they would be \nwilling\
    \ to enroll in this scheme is 771.37.  A detailed empirical analysis concerning\
    \ WTP/WTA \nvalues for irrigation water is explained in the chapter 5.   \nThe\
    \ United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resource Conservation\
    \ \nService (NRCS) provides a cost-share under Environmental Quality Incentives\
    \ Program (EQIP) \nto adopt different best management practices to improve water\
    \ quality and water quantity. NRCS \ncost share is generally between 60 - 75%\
    \ (i.e., NRCS pays 60 – 75% of the total estimated costs \nof implementing the\
    \ best management practices), but socially disadvantaged farmers may be \neligible\
    \ for up to 90%. In that context, we asked producers to provide information regarding\
    \ \nsome selected NRCS practices such as surge valves, flow meters, moisture sensors,\
    \ and laser \nleveling. Figure 2.8 displays producers’ responses concerning the\
    \ adoption of surge valves for \nirrigation and Figure 2.9 represent the responses\
    \ to using EQIP to share cost while installing \nsurge valves.    \n \n \n24 \n\
    \ \nA. Surge valves \n \n \nFigure 2.8. Response about surge valves use \n \n\
    Figure 2.9. Use of EQIP to install surge valves \nFrom Figure 2.8, out of the\
    \ total responses (N = 102), only 17% of respondents had adopted \nsurge valves\
    \ irrigation as a best management practices to improve irrigation water quality\
    \ and \nquantity. Figure 2.9 shows that around 17% of the respondents (N=76) have\
    \ used EQIP to \nfinance a portion of the valves irrigation system’s installation\
    \ cost. Our survey samples indicate a \nvery small fraction of farmers interested\
    \ in adopting surge valves and utilizing the EQIP program \nto finance system\
    \ installation. However, Adusumilli et al. (2016) find that the use of surge valves\
    \ \nin furrow irrigation is a financially sound decision for irrigated crop production\
    \ in Louisiana. \nThus, they emphasize a need to cost share by NRCS to encourage\
    \ surge valves adoption. We \nasked about conditions when producers might adopt\
    \ surge valves. Figure 2.10 displays the \nresponses to the following questions:\
    \ \nIf you have not adopted, which best describes you feelings about the potential\
    \ adopting in the future.  \ni. Yes, I would adopt without utilizing EQIP. I would\
    \ pay 100% of the installment costs. \nii.  Yes, I would adopt but only with the\
    \ ability of utilizing EQIP and its typical cost share rates. \niii.  Yes, I would\
    \ adopt but only at a higher cost share rate than typically provided by EQIP.\
    \ \niv.  I have no plans to adopt this practice at this time. \n17%\n83%\nYes\n\
    No\n17%\n83%\nYes\nNo\n25 \n \n \nFigure 2.10. Conditions about potential adoption\
    \ of surge valves \nRegarding the potential adoption of surge valves irrigation\
    \ in the future, producers show mixed \nresponses. More than 50% of the respondents\
    \ (N=90) are not willing to adopt. Around 28% of \nthe respondents are willing\
    \ to adopt with the utilization of EQIP, 13% would adopt but at a \nhigher cost-share\
    \ rate than typically provided by EQIP, and around 6% of respondents would \n\
    like to adopt without utilizing EQIP.  \nB. Flow meters \nImplementation of flow\
    \ meters in the irrigation system helps to improve irrigation efficiency by \n\
    measuring the amount of water that passes through a water line (Sheffield et al.,\
    \ 2009).7 These \nwould provide useful information for saving money on water usage,\
    \ resulting in lower input \ncosts and higher farm profits. Figure 2.11 and 2.12\
    \ portray respondents’ responses regarding \nflow meter adoption and the utilization\
    \ of EQIP to share the cost for installing a flow meter in \ntheir irrigation\
    \ system. Our sample responses indicate that only 8% of total respondents (N=100)\
    \ \n                                                           \n7 Irrigation\

    \ the potential adoption of a \nflow meter in the future to improve irrigation\
    \ efficiency. Figure 2.13 displays survey responses. \nOut of the total responses\
    \ (N = 84), around 60% of the respondents are not willing to adopt flow \nmeter\
    \ in the future. However, around 40% of respondents are interested in adopting\
    \ these with \nsome conditions. Among them, around 21% would potentially adopt\
    \ a flow meter with the \nutilization of EQIP and its typical cost-share rates;\
    \ around 17% would be willing to adopt one, \nbut only at a higher cost share\
    \ rate than typically provided by EQIP; and only 2.4% of \nrespondents would be\
    \ interested in adopting it without the support of EQIP.  \n8%\n92%\nYes\nNo\n\

    \ system enables producers to improve irrigation \nefficiency so that they can\
    \ apply an appropriate amount of water beneficial for crop growth while \nminimizing\
    \ surface runoff. Figures 2.14 and 2.15 display farmers’ responses regarding the\
    \ \nadoption of moisture sensors in their irrigation systems and the utilization\
    \ of EQIP to share the \ncost for installing a moisture sensor. Survey responses\
    \ indicates that 11% of the total respondents \n(N=98) have adopted a moisture\
    \ sensor (Figure 2.14), and only 2% of respondents (N=56) have \nutilized EQIP\
    \ to finance a portion of the installation costs. \n \n \nFigure 2.14. Response\
    \ to whether farmers \nhave adopted moisture sensors \nFigure 2.15. Response to\
    \ whether EQIP cost \nshare was used to adopt moisture sensors \nAs we see from\
    \ the above Figures, a very large proportion of respondents have not \nadopted\
    \ a moisture sensor in their irrigation practices. Potential reasons for not adopting\
    \ one \ncould be many, such as they are less concerned about water conservation,\
    \ wish for lower \nirrigation costs, or that they see less returns compared to\
    \ the moisture sensor’s installation or \nadditional management costs. A study\
    \ conducted by Bryant et al. (2017) finds irrigation water \nmanagement practices\
    \ (moisture sensors, surge valves irrigation and computerized hole \nselection)\
    \ reduce water use by 21% and increase irrigation efficiency by 36%, compared\
    \ to \nconventional irrigation in soybean production in Mississippi. Montesano\
    \ et al. (2016) find the \nsoil moisture sensor-controlled irrigation system more\
    \ efficient than timer-based irrigation in \nlettuce farming in Italy. Implementing\
    \ moisture sensors in crop irrigation might be a little bit \n11%\n89%\nYes\n\
    No\n2%\n98%\nYes\nNo\n28 \n \nexpensive, but it serves the purpose of reducing\
    \ water runoff loss. We accessed information \nconcerning producers’ willingness\
    \ to adopt moisture sensors in the future. \n \nFigure 2.16. Producers’ willingness\
    \ to adopt moisture sensors under different conditions \nFrom Figure 2.16, around\
    \ 55% of respondents (N=73) are not interested in adopting \nmoisture sensors\
    \ in the future, 29% of respondents are willing to adopt them utilizing EQIP,\
    \ 11% \nwish to adopt by utilizing EQIP but at higher cost share, and 5% want\
    \ to adopt without EQIP \nsupport.      \nD. Laser leveling \nLaser leveling ensures\
    \ improvement in irrigation water application uniformity. It minimizes \nirrigation\
    \ time, reduces energy use in irrigation, increase irrigation efficiency by conserving\
    \ \nwater use, and enhances farm productivity and net farm returns. Indeed, laser\
    \ leveling is more \nimportant to a flood and furrow irrigation system than the\
    \ center pivot irrigation system. Figures \n2.17 and 2.18 depict respondents’\
    \ responses concerning the adoption of laser leveling and the \nutilization of\
    \ EQIP to finance a portion of the laser leveling installation costs. Our survey\
    \ results \nshow that around 41% of the respondents (N=221) have adopted laser\
    \ leveling (Figure 2.17). \nRegarding financial support, around 17% of the respondents\
    \ (N=190) reported that they utilized \nEQIP to finance a portion of the laser\
    \ leveling installation costs.     \n4\n21\n8\n40\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n\

    \ Response to whether farmers \nhave adopted laser leveling \nFigure 2.18. Response\
    \ to whether EQIP cost \nshare was used to adopt laser leveling \n \nAs we notice\
    \ from the above Figure, around 59% of respondents are practicing farming without\
    \ \nlaser leveling even though it has a great implication in water conservation,\
    \ farm productivity, and \nnet profit (Ali and Hussain, 2018). A study done by\
    \ Aryal et al. (2018) shows that large \nlandholders are more likely to adopt\
    \ laser leveling; however, they find a negative association \nbetween land holdings\
    \ and the proportion of laser-leveled land. The likelihood of laser leveling \n\
    adoption could be enhanced by addressing farmers’ concerns through appropriate\
    \ policy \nformulation.  \nProducers who have not adopted laser leveling technology\
    \ yet might potentially adopt it \nin the future. We asked about conditions for\
    \ adoption using similar questions to the other \nirrigation efficiency increasing\
    \ practices. Figure 2.19 displays the survey responses about the \npotential conditions\
    \ for adopting laser leveling in the future.  \n41%\n59%\nYes\nNo\n17%\n83%\n\
    Yes\nNo\n30 \n \n \nFigure 2.19. Farmers’ willingness to adopt laser leveling\
    \ under different conditions \nWe can see from Figure 2.19 that around 54% of\
    \ respondents (N=52) indicated that they do not \nhave a plan to adopt this practice\
    \ in the future. However, the remaining 46% of respondents \nshow some interest\
    \ in adopting it but with some conditions. Approximately 23% of respondents \n\
    would like to adopt it with the utilization of EQIP and its typical cost-sharing\
    \ rates, around 15% \nof respondents would like to adopt but only at a higher\
    \ cost share rate than typically provided by \nEQIP, and around 8% of respondents\
    \ would prefer to adopt it without utilizing EQIP to install \nthe technology.\
    \ To achieve higher production and irrigation efficiency, especially in a \nfurrow/flood\
    \ irrigation situation, producers might be interested in this technology if they\
    \ felt \nmore secure about the benefits of adoption. For that, an appropriate\
    \ benefit-cost analysis could \nbe helpful.  \nIrrigation information \nTable\
    \ 2.3 displays descriptive statistics of irrigated and non-irrigated acres of\
    \ land in operation, \nand the yield of four major crops, viz., corn, cotton,\

    \ 894 pounds, and 6710 pounds \nrespectively. In 2015, the average yield per acre\
    \ of corn, soybean, cotton, and rice were 171 \nbushels, 41 bushels, 810 pounds,\
    \ and 6940 pounds according to the USDA9 report. Similarly, \nduring the crop\
    \ year 2016, the average yield of these four crops was reported as being 174 \n\
    bushels, 50 bushels, 960 pounds, and 6850 pounds, respectively. The average yield\
    \ values per \nacre from our survey seem to be relatively close to the values\
    \ reported by the USDA.  \n \nRenting farmland with cash share or crop share is\
    \ widely practiced in many countries in \nthe world. The implication of renting\
    \ has been widely studied in terms of many aspects such as \nproductivity, resource\
    \ management, and producers’ well-being. For example, Kirwan and \nRoberts (2016)\
    \ estimate the incidence of agricultural subsidies on land rents using USDA data\
    \ \nand find that the marginal subsidy dollar causes rental rates to increase.\
    \ Varble et al. (2016) find \nthat renters are more likely to practice conservation\
    \ tillage than full owners, though they are less \nlikely to rotate crops in Iowa’s\
    \ case. According to the U.S. Census of Agriculture 2012, nearly \n40 percent\
    \ of U.S farmland is rented or leased from someone else and around 353.8 million\
    \ acres \nof land were rented out in 2014 across the US. Illinois, Iowa, and Nebraska\
    \ are the top three \nstates in terms of receiving dollar value by renting out\
    \ farmland; Louisiana is not among the top \nten rent receiving states. Table\
    \ 2.4 displays the descriptive statistics of cash share and crop share \nrate\
    \ for five selected crops produced in Louisiana. Our survey responses indicate\
    \ that the average \ncash rent for corn, soybean, cotton, and rice range from\
    \ $90 - $101 per acre but the cash rental \nfor sorghum is about $68.33 per acre\
    \ (Table 2.4). The crop share rate for those crops ranges from \n20 to 22 percent\
    \ of crop yield per acre.   \n                                               \

    \ crops. \nIndeed, our primary concern is about soybeans irrigation, so the description\
    \ is mainly focused on \nsoybeans. On average, each farm producer grew soybean\
    \ on 708 acres using furrow irrigation. \n35 \n \nThe average number of furrow\
    \ irrigations made were 4.5 with an average of 41.3 hours spent for \nirrigating\
    \ soybeans farms during the crop year 2015-2016. Under the center pivot irrigation\
    \ \nsystem, on average, each farm producer utilized 431 acres of land irrigating\
    \ 4.5 times and \nspending an average of 33 hours. Average acres of land, amount\
    \ of irrigation, and hours of \nirrigation for other crops using flood irrigation,\
    \ furrow irrigation, and center pivot irrigation \nsystems are presented in Table\
    \ 2.5. Figure 2.20 depicts the irrigation technology adoption for \neach crop\
    \ as shown below.     \n \nFigure 2.20. Crops irrigated by different irrigation\
    \ technology \nFrom Figure 2.20, we can see that furrow irrigation is the dominant\
    \ irrigation technology \nadopted in soybean, corn, and cotton production. However,\
    \ flood irrigation is the only irrigation \ntechnology utilized in rice production.\
    \ We provide details on variables affecting the choice of \ndifferent irrigation\
    \ methods in the next chapter. \nIrrigation operation costs vary greatly depending\
    \ on the type of irrigation technology in \npractice, water availability, type\
    \ of crops produced, land characteristics, and production \ntechnology adopted.\
    \ The major costs involved in farm irrigation are energy cost, poly pipe cost\

    \ can see that the farmers with furrow irrigation used 40 rolls of \npolypipe\
    \ on average to irrigate their farmland and spent an average of $10,570 to purchase\
    \ it. \nThe average number of labor hours required to lay polypipe across the\
    \ farmland was 98 hours \nand the average cost spent on irrigation system repair\
    \ and maintenance seemed to be around \n$6,049 per crop year. Most of the farmers\
    \ used electricity and diesel as a major energy source to \npump water. On average\
    \ each producer spent $7,319 on electricity, $12,170 on diesel fuel, and \n$7,950\
    \ on natural gas.  \n2.2.3 Sociodemographic information \nEducational attainment\
    \ of farm operators and their spouses \nIt is generally believed that more educated\
    \ farmers are likely to adopt new technologies and have \nbetter decision-making\
    \ tendencies, and thus could impact the private returns improving the \ntechnical\
    \ and allocative efficiency. Toma et al. (2018) indicate that education influences\
    \ both \nbehavior and intentions indirectly through profit orientation and perceived\
    \ usefulness of the \n37 \n \ninformation source. Education and information access\
    \ were found to be among the factors \ninfluencing multiple technology adoptions.\
    \  Educated farmers are more likely to access useful \ninformation and tend to\
    \ adopt it in their farming practices. Figure 2.21 and 2.22 show the highest \n\
    educational attainment of principal farm operators and their spouses.  \n \n \n\
    Figure 2.21. Education of farm operator \nFigure 2.22. Education of spouse \n\
    From Figures 2.21 and 2.22, only 4 percent of principal farm operators (N=232)\
    \ and 2 percent of \ntheir spouses (N=188) seem to have an education below the\
    \ high school level. Regarding farm \noperators’ highest education, around 9 percent\
    \ have a graduate or professional degree, 31% have \na college degree, 23% have\
    \ some college, and 33% have a high school degree. As for the \neducational attainment\
    \ of their spouses, 17% have a graduate degree or professional degree, 32% \n\
    have a college degree, 17% have some college, and 32% have a high school degree.\
    \ \nFarm operation information \nThe farm operation information such as farming\
    \ experience, farm revenue, and distance to \nmarket are important components\
    \ in our empirical analysis concerning irrigation technology \nadoption and farm\
    \ efficiency analysis. The descriptive statistics of these variables are presented\

    50 \n \nFrom Table 2.7, the average experience in soybean production is about\
    \ 31 years, with a range \nfrom 1 year to 57 years. The average income received\
    \ from soybeans is 51%. It ranges from 4 \npercent to 100%. The proportion of\
    \ total farm revenue is about 75% on average. Those who \nreceive a lower percentage\
    \ of their income from the farm tend to engage in off-farm employment \nin order\
    \ to supplement their total income. The information regarding access to the nearest\
    \ market \nis measured by three variables: distance from farm to the nearest city/town,\
    \ distance to the \nnearest fertilizer dealer, and distance to the equipment dealer.\
    \ The average distance to the nearest \ntown from the farm is 8.43 miles, distance\
    \ to the fertilizer dealer is 9.88 miles and the distance to \nthe equipment dealer\
    \ is 14.68 miles. Distance to the market can affect farm efficiency. For \nexample,\
    \ Abdulai and Abdulai (2016) find that in Zambian corn farming inefficiency is\
    \ \nexplained by distance to market.  \nOff-farm job \nFollowing questions were\
    \ asked in order to access farmers’ information regarding job status: \n1. Do\
    \ you have off farm job? (yes= 1, no=0) \n2. How many hours do you work off farm\
    \ on average each week? (hours per week) \n3. Does your spouse have an off farm\
    \ job? (yes=1, no=0) \n4. How many hours does your spouse work off farm on an\
    \ average each week? \n \n39 \n \nOut of the total responses (N=226), 26% of respondents\
    \ indicated that they do have an off farm-\njob and 37% of their spouses (N=209)\
    \ do have an off-farm job (Figures 2.23 and 2.24). \nRegarding off-farm working\
    \ hours, respondents reported that those who are involved in an off-\nfarm job\
    \ work 38 hours per week on average, and their spouses work on average 36 hours\
    \ per \nweek (Table 2.8). In order to find out average weekly hours, we excluded\
    \ the observations that \nreported zero work hours per week.   \n \n \nFigure\

    \   \n74 \n36.595 11.200 \n1 \n80 \n \nReasons for off-farm job  \nThe involvement\
    \ of a farmer in an off-farm job is associated with his/her utility maximization,\
    \ \nwhich is influenced by many factors such as health benefits, supplementary\
    \ income, retirement \nbenefits, and many other benefits. It is all about how\
    \ a person utilizes his/her leisure when leisure \nutilization could be affected\
    \ by his/her wellbeing received from farm revenue. Conversely, it is \nalso possible\
    \ that farm efficiency might be influenced by off-farm work. Many studies evaluate\
    \ \nthe determinants of an off-farm job and its consequences for farm efficiency.\
    \ Mishra and \n74%\n26%\nNo\nYes\n63%\n37%\nNo\nYes\n40 \n \nGoodwin (1997) find\
    \ that farm operators and their spouses who receive income support from the \n\
    government are less likely to be involved in an off-farm job. Additionally, off-farm\
    \ employment \nis found to be influenced by farm experience, off-farm work experience,\
    \ farm size, leverage, \nefficiency, and farm-specific education. Goodwin and\
    \ Mishra (2004) find that more intensive \nparticipation in off-farm labor markets\
    \ tends to be associated with lower farming efficiency. \nPandit et al. (2013)\
    \ evaluated the impact of government payment on labor allocation and found \n\
    that neither direct nor indirect government payments have any impact on the off-farm\
    \ labor \nsupply. Bharadwaj et al. (2013) evaluated the motivation to work off-farm\
    \ among U.S. farm \nwomen. Their findings indicate that their motivations were\
    \ influenced by individual, household, \nfarm, and local labor market characteristics.\
    \ \nIn this study, we are not concerned with evaluating the determinants of off-farm\
    \ \nemployment. However, the information regarding farmers’ off-farm employment\
    \ could be useful \ncomponents in farm efficiency evaluation. To assess the off-farm\
    \ employment information, we \nprovided four options to select that best describe\
    \ their reason (s) for working off-farm. They \ncould select all that apply from\
    \ the following options:  \n \nHealth benefits \n \nSupplemental income \n\
    \ \nRetirement benefits \n \nOthers (please specify if any). \n41 \n \n \nFigure\
    \ 2.25. Reasons for off-farm employment \nOut of a total of 129 responses, 49\
    \ respondents mentioned that they work off-farm because of \nhealth benefits,\
    \ 32 mentioned that they work off-farm because of supplemental income received\
    \ \nfrom employment, and 28 work because of retirement benefits. \nRisk Preference\
    \ \nProducers’ attitudes towards risk in agricultural investment could have both\
    \ positive and \nnegative implications. Risk preference may influence the adoption\
    \ of new production \ntechnologies and irrigation technologies. Pannell et al.\
    \ (2014) note that, for a high-risk averse \ndecision maker, risk and uncertainty\
    \ tend to have a negative effect on the farmers’ adoption of \nconventional as\
    \ well as conservation agriculture systems. In our empirical work, risk information\
    \ \nis one of the important variables. The information regarding farmers’ perceptions\
    \ and attitude \ntoward risk would help researchers to understand the consequences\
    \ for the productions process \nand thus its finding would be useful to policymakers\
    \ in formulating appropriate risk management \ntools. The following Figure 2.26\
    \ shows the distribution of farm operators’ attitude towards risk \nin investment\
    \ decisions. \n49\n32\n28\n20\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\nHealth benef.\nSuppl.inc.\n\

    \ in Figure 2.26, a total of 172 producers indicated their attitude towards risk.\
    \ The \npercentage of risk averse and risk-neutral are almost the same at around\
    \ 39%. Around 23% of the \nrespondents are willing to take on substantial risk\
    \ in their investment decisions.  \n2.3 Sample bias in a survey    \n \nA common\
    \ problem associated with survey related studies is the possibility of sample\
    \ \nbias, a case when the survey sample does not represent the population. This\
    \ bias when caused by \nan unrepresentative sample is known as selection bias.\
    \ Similarly, undercoverage bias, \nnonresponse bias, and voluntary response bias\
    \ are some forms of selection biases. In our survey, \nundercoverage bias and\
    \ nonresponse bias can be suspected as we have around a 10% response \nrate. Generally,\
    \ undercoverage bias occurs when some members of the population insufficiently\
    \ \nparticipate so that missing responses from certain groups (which might be\
    \ different from those \nwho responded) may increase the likelihood of data distortion.\
    \ Likewise, nonresponse bias \noccurs when individuals selected for a survey are\
    \ unable to respond or not willing to respond. \nThe possibility, in this case,\
    \ is that the response from respondents and non-respondents might be \nsignificantly\
    \ different in some way. In addition to that, a survey-based study may suffer\
    \ from \nsampling error since we are not using the whole population. Indeed, there\
    \ is no absolute \nthreshold for a representative survey. However, we can minimize\
    \ the selection bias in a couple of \n23%\n39%\n38%\nRisk lover\nRisk avert\n\
    Risk neutral\n43 \n \nways, such as designing a survey correctly by ensuring balance\
    \ in the questionnaire, phrasing the \nquestions correctly, ensuring the confidentiality\
    \ of respondents, and administering the survey in a \ncorrect way. In this survey,\
    \ we tried our best to take care of these technical issues and \ncommunicate with\
    \ the targeted producers using the Dillman’s tailored design method. From the\
    \ \nsurvey response, we can see that the average values of samples seem to be\
    \ close to that of those \nobtained from the census of agriculture or surveys\
    \ conducted by local and state agencies. \n2.4 References \nAbdulai, A. N., &\

    \ ALLOCATION \n \n3.1 Introduction \nThe irrigation scenario in Louisiana is different\
    \ from that in the Western U.S. mainly because \nwater availability has not been\
    \ a major concern in Louisiana until recently. Groundwater is the \nmajor source\
    \ of irrigation in the state. Some aquifers in the state are showing signs of\
    \ stress due \nto overexploitation as evidenced by the presence of a cone of depression\
    \ (Sparta aquifer, \nMRVAA) and saltwater intrusion (MRVAA). As reported by the\
    \ USGS10, the “preliminary status \nof the Sparta Aquifer in north-central Louisiana\
    \ indicates water use totals of 57.2 million gallons \nper day for 2015. It appears\
    \ to be close to its sustainable range of 52 to 56 million gallons per \nday after\
    \ over-pumping Sparta for many decades”. A report produced by the USGS in 2010\
    \ 11 \nindicates that total withdrawals for general irrigation increased by 17%\
    \ from 2005 to 2010. \nDuring the same period, groundwater and surface-water withdrawals\
    \ for general irrigation \nincreased by 16 percent and 22 percent respectively.\
    \ From 2005 to 2010, water withdrawals for \ngeneral irrigation increased in 37\
    \ of the 64 parishes in Louisiana by 58 percent. Tensas Parish \nhad the greatest\
    \ increase in irrigation acreages during the same period. As of 2018, 71.8 percent\
    \ \nof the total Louisiana corn area and 42.8 percent of the total soybean area\
    \ were irrigated \naccording to the USDA report. \nIrrigation has been increasingly\
    \ used by farmers as a risk prevention strategy in crop \nproduction in Louisiana.\
    \ Continuous extraction of groundwater may reduce the water table in the \n  \

    \ intrusion in some aquifers. To avoid such a potential risk, a serious \neffort\
    \ is required to maintain water table balance so as to ensure sustainable use\
    \ of groundwater. \nThe adoption of efficient irrigation technology along with\
    \ irrigation water management practices \nincluding sensor-based scheduling, flow\
    \ meter adoption, surge valves, and computerized hole \nselection that would enable\
    \ producers to conserve water per acre area while achieving reasonable \nwater\
    \ productivity. \nProducers’ irrigation behavior and their irrigation technology\
    \ adoption decisions are \ndetermined by many factors, such as land characteristics,\
    \ weather factors, crop selection, farm \noperation cost, water availability,\
    \ energy cost, and perception about sustainability. On the one \nhand, producers\
    \ are more concerned about the present level of productivity and net on-farm \n\
    profitability. On the other hand resource sustainability perspective aims at the\
    \ minimization of \nwater use while maintaining the required level of moisture\
    \ for crop growth. Center pivot \nirrigation technology is more efficient than\
    \ the commonly used furrow irrigation system \n(Amosson et al., 2011). However,\
    \ farmers can be reluctant to shift to more efficient irrigation \ntechnology\
    \ when initial investment costs are high, especially when there are no restrictions\
    \ on \ngroundwater withdrawal amounts. It is important to justify the rationality\
    \ concerning converting \nto efficient irrigation technology by comparing the\
    \ long run benefit of different irrigation \ntechnologies and producers should\
    \ be assured that efficient irrigation technology is a better fit for \nthem.\
    \ For example, the adoption of a subsurface drip irrigation system is more feasible\
    \ for \nrelatively high-value crops compared to low value crops with a low energy\
    \ precision application \ncenter pivot sprinkler irrigation system (Guerrero et\
    \ al., 2016).  \n47 \n \nLouisiana farmers have been utilizing surface water,\
    \ groundwater, and rainwater for \nirrigation purposes (Benedict and McClure,\
    \ 2015).12 Louisiana farmers use mainly three \ntechnologies to irrigate soybeans:\
    \ furrow, center pivot, and flood irrigation. None of the \nirrigation systems\
    \ are designated as the superior technology in all circumstances as they have\
    \ \nstrengths and weaknesses depending on water availability, soil type, land\
    \ characteristics, and the \ntype of crops grown. It means the choice of irrigation\
    \ method is determined by various factors, \nsuch as water availability, water\
    \ source, land characteristics, sociodemographic factors, and \nenvironmental\
    \ conditions. Many studies (Damania et al., 2016;  Tolhurst and Ker, 2014; Caswell\
    \ \nand Zilberman, 1986; Dridi and Khanna, 2005; and Caswell and Zilberman, 1985)\
    \ evaluate the \ndeterminants of irrigation technology adoption for different\
    \ crops in different geographic \nlocations. Producers intend to adopt new technologies\
    \ in order to hedge against production risk \nand the adoption of efficient irrigation\
    \ technology is influenced by producers’ human capital as \nwell (Koundouri et\
    \ al., 2006). Paudel et al. (2016) examine irrigation water sources and irrigation\
    \ \nmethods used by U.S. nursery plant producers and find that the use of a computer,\
    \ annual sales, \nregion, and the number and the intensity of integrated pest\
    \ management (IPM) practices adopted, \nplay an important role in the choice of\
    \ irrigation method. Regarding water source selection, old \nnursery firms use\
    \ more municipal water, high-income producers use recycled water, and \nproducers\
    \ who contracted to mass merchandisers use less water from natural sources. If\
    \ \nirrigation water availability is a major concern, farmers tend to utilize\
    \ efficient irrigation \ntechnology so as to minimize water costs. In this nexus,\
    \ Caswell and Zilberman (1986) find \nwater cost, location and water source to\
    \ be the major determinants for irrigation technology \n                     \

    \ show that water cost is not the most important factor \ngoverning irrigation\
    \ technology adoption. Physical and agronomic characteristics are more \nimportant\
    \ in choosing irrigation technology. \nUsing efficient irrigation technology is\
    \ generally viewed as a feasible way to reduce \nconsumptive water for agricultural\
    \ production. However, it is evident that the conversion to more \nefficient irrigation\
    \ technology has increased groundwater extraction in western Kansas (Pfeiffer\
    \ \nand Lin, 2014). This implies that the adoption of an efficient irrigation\
    \ technology is necessary \nbut not sufficient for water conservation which is\
    \ supported by many studies. For instance, \nSegarra and Feng (1994) observed\
    \ that declines in irrigated acres in the Texas High Plains are \ndue to the utilization\
    \ of low efficiency irrigation technologies combined with low crop prices \nresulting\
    \ in low farm profitability. They further mention that the adoption of efficient\
    \ irrigation \ntechnology could increase the groundwater withdrawal and increase\
    \ the net present value of \nreturns but this may not necessarily lead to groundwater\
    \ conservation. However, implementation \nof integrating irrigation water management\
    \ practices, including surge flow irrigation, \ncomputerized hole selection, and\
    \ sensor-based irrigation scheduling even in a furrow irrigation \nsystem may\
    \ lead to enhanced irrigation efficiency, and thus could conserve a significant\
    \ amount \nof water. \n  \nBryant et al. (2017) investigate experimentally to\
    \ determine the effect of integrating \nirrigation water management practices\
    \ on irrigation water use, soybean yield, irrigation water use \nefficiency, and\
    \ net returns in the Prairie region of Arkansas and the Delta region of Arkansas\
    \ and \nMississippi. Field level study results from 2013 through 2015 indicate\
    \ that soybean yield and net \nreturns for soybean production above irrigation\
    \ costs did not differ between conventional \nirrigation practices and integrating\
    \ water management practices. However, compared to \n49 \n \nconventional irrigation\
    \ practices, irrigation water management practices reduced total water use \n\
    by 21% and increased water use efficiency by 36%, and sensor-based scheduling\
    \ reduced \nirrigation by 50%. This indicates that the adoption of integrating\
    \ water management practices at \nthe production scale reduces the water demand\
    \ significantly, leading to groundwater \nconservation without adversely affecting\
    \ the crop yield and on-farm net profitability. Huang et al. \n(2017) find that\
    \ farm producers in Arkansas are more likely to rely on water management \npractices\
    \ (sensor based, flow meters etc.) instead of more efficient irrigation technologies\
    \ such as \nsprinkler irrigation in response to drought or the level of groundwater\
    \ decline. They notice that a \nsprinkler irrigation system is more popular in\
    \ a region with a lower average temperature. \nHowever, in the adoption of water\
    \ saving irrigation technologies--sprinkler and tailwater \nrecovery pits--it\
    \ has been noticed that small farm size, high water or labor costs, and soil with\
    \ a \nlow water holding capacity increase the likelihood of adopting sprinkler\
    \ irrigation (Negri and \nBrooks, 1990). Indeed, physical factors such as soil\
    \ slope, texture, and quality, and to a lesser \nextent, climate, dominate the\
    \ water saving technology selection probability (ibid). \nCotton producers from\
    \ 14 states in the U.S. have shown similar behavior as found in \nmost of the\
    \ previous studies concerning irrigation technology adoption and acreage allocation\
    \ for \nspecific irrigation technology. In these 14 states, irrigation technology\
    \ adoption and acreage \nallocation seem to be affected by landholding, education,\
    \ per acre yield, computer use, age,  \nregion, and source of information (Pokhrel\
    \ et al., 2018). Irrigation practices and factors affecting \nirrigation technology\
    \ in western states of the U.S. seem to be different compared to the southern\
    \ \nstates, mainly due to the fact that water scarcity is severe in the west.\
    \ For example, in the West \nCoast region of the U.S. where farming is irrigation\
    \ intensive and water scarcity is a concern, \nproducers’ irrigation decisions\
    \ are determined by economic and physical water scarcity, climate, \n50 \n \n\
    and extreme weather such as severe drought, frost, and extreme heat (Olen et al.,\
    \ 2016). \nAdditionally, in regions where groundwater supply is reduced significantly,\
    \ converting from an \ninefficient gravity irrigation system to an efficient drip\
    \ irrigation system offsets many of the \nnegative impacts of drought on farm\
    \ income, as explained by Ward (2014) in the context of the \nRio Grande river\
    \ basin of New Mexico.  \nMany studies have been conducted regarding the evaluation\
    \ of determinants of irrigation \ntechnology adoption in different parts of the\
    \ world and have suggested a possible policy tool to \nmitigate the risk and enhance\
    \ irrigation water productivity. In most cases, water availability, \nfarmers’\
    \ perception of the use of available water resources, extension services, cropping\
    \ patterns, \nand educational levels are the major factors affecting irrigation\
    \ technology adoption. For \nexample, Adeoti (2009) reveals that the availability\
    \ of farm labor and the frequency of extension \nvisits are major determinants\
    \ of irrigation technology adoption in Ghana. Concerning rainwater \nharvesting\
    \ and supplementary irrigation technology adoption in the semiarid area of China,\
    \ He et \nal. (2007) find that farmers’ educational backgrounds, the size of the\
    \ active labor force, the \nextension service, a positive attitude towards irrigation\
    \ technology adoption, and participation in \nthe grain-for-green project are\
    \ the major determinants of adoption. In the case of micro-irrigation \nadoption\
    \ in India, Namara et al. (2007) find that the availability of groundwater, cropping\
    \ \npatterns, credit access, level of education, and financial status are the\
    \ most influential factors for \nadoption decisions.  \nFeike et al. (2017) indicate\
    \ that farm size, crop types, and cropping intensity are the \nmajor determinants\
    \ of drip irrigation technology adoption for cotton farming in the arid area of\
    \ \nNorthwest China. Water conservation and its sustainable use is a major concern\
    \ globally. To \nachieve sustainable use of water resources, a government initiative\
    \ in promoting water-saving \n51 \n \nirrigation technologies and the reliability\
    \ of the water source would play an effective role in any \nirrigation water saving\
    \ mission. In this line of study, Dai et al. (2015) determine that the \nreliability\
    \ of the water source, government promotional activities, level of education,\
    \ soil texture, \nenergy price, and availability of farm labor are positively\
    \ associated with the probability of \nadopting water-saving irrigation technology\
    \ in the Heilongjiang province of China. However, the \nadoption of more efficient\
    \ irrigation technology may lead to rebound effects, as evidenced by \nSong et\
    \ al. (2018) and Li and Zhao (2018). If water conservation is the concern, potential\
    \ \nrebound effects of new technology adoption should be taken into consideration.\
    \  \nInformation channeling and social capital are important factors in explaining\
    \ technology \nadoption decisions by farmers. Information dissemination concerning\
    \ new studies and findings \nthrough an effective and reliable source of information\
    \ can optimize its implementation \nprobability and thus be productive in achieving\
    \ the goal of resource management.13 Hunecke et \nal. (2017) demonstrate that\
    \ trust in the institution, and formal and informal networks have a \npositive\
    \ influence on irrigation technology adoption, whereas general trust has a positive\
    \ \nrelationship with the formal and informal networks in wine production in Central\
    \ Chile. Human \ncapital seems to have a strong relationship with networks implying\
    \ that the networks are the \nmain catalyst of social capital. A study, “Who Matters\
    \ More for Technology Adoption, \nNeighbors or Extension?,” conducted by Krishnan\
    \ and Patnam (2013) in Ethiopia reveals that the \nextension service is more effective\
    \ during the initial phase of new production technology \nadoption. Indeed, it\
    \ is noted that social learning is a powerful force for adopting new \n      \
    \                                                     \n13 Human capital is measured\
    \ by educational attainment; formal networks represent the farmers’ \nparticipation\
    \ in associations and meeting with professional and experts; informal networks\
    \ represent \nnetworks of close neighbors, family and friends; general trust refers\

    \ learning from extension services during the study \nperiod. The implication\
    \ of this finding is that strong social capital can be formed through \neffective\
    \ extension services combined with other possible trustworthy sources of an information\
    \ \nchanneling networks so as to encourage farmers to adopt efficient production\
    \ and irrigation \ntechnologies. Use of extension services and social learning\
    \ should be combined to the maximum \nextent, as it is evident that these channels\
    \ play an important role in irrigation technology \nadoption and the effectiveness\
    \ of each informational channel is enhanced by the presence of the \nother (Genius\
    \ et al., 2013). \nThe main objective of this study is to determine the factors\
    \ affecting irrigation technology \nadoption in soybean and corn production and\
    \ acreage allocation for different irrigation \ntechnologies among the crop producers\
    \ in Louisiana. For this purpose, we have conducted a farm \nlevel survey to collect\
    \ information regarding irrigation practices and concerns. Regarding the \nmethodology,\
    \ it uses a probit as well as an instrumental variable probit (IV-probit) model\
    \ to \nestimate the determinants of irrigation technology adoption for soybean\
    \ and corn irrigation and a \nmultivariate fractional regression method to estimate\
    \ the determinants of acreage allocation. The \nfindings of this study should\
    \ be beneficial to those who are concerned about water productivity \nand water\
    \ resource conservation. Additionally, the results could have greater policy implications,\
    \ \nespecially in formulating effective tools to promote efficient irrigation\
    \ technology adoption. \nThe rest of this essay is structured as follows. Section\
    \ 2 describes the model specification \nand estimation methods, which include\
    \ a probit and IV-probit model for irrigation technology \nadoption and multivariate\
    \ fractional regression method for acreage allocation. Section 3 explains \nthe\
    \ data description; section 4 presents empirical results, policy implications,\
    \ and discussion. \n53 \n \nFinally, section 5 provides concluding remarks and\
    \ further plans to elaborate on the study in the \nfuture.      \n3.2 Method \n\
    3.2.1 Irrigation technology adoption \nIn our survey, most of the farmers have\
    \ indicated that they use furrow and center pivot irrigation \ntechnologies in\
    \ soybean production. In order to estimate the determinants of irrigation \ntechnology\
    \ adoption, a probit regression approach is applied, since the outcome variables\
    \ are \nbinary. The probit regression is based on the random utility model in\
    \ which an individual farmer \nmakes a decision based on the difference in the\
    \ marginal benefit of choosing an alternative \ntechnology. This difference in\
    \ marginal benefit denoted by \U0001D466∗ is not observable. However, the \nfinal\
    \ outcome is observed, as the individual would choose a particular option if it\
    \ provided \nhigher utility, that is \U0001D466 = 1 if \U0001D466∗ > 0  and \U0001D466\
    \ = 0 otherwise (Green, 2012). Here, \U0001D466 = 1 refers to \nthe outcome when\
    \ an individual farmer chooses to adopt furrow or other irrigation technology\
    \ \nrespectively. This selection is determined by many factors that we analyze\
    \ in this study. The \nmodel can be expressed as: \nPr(\U0001D466 = 1|\U0001D44B\
    ) = \U0001D439(\U0001D6FD0 + \U0001D6FD\U0001D456\U0001D44B)                 \

    \ the probability of adoption, F is the cumulative distribution function which\
    \ is \nassumed to be distributed normally, X is the vector of explanatory variables,\
    \ and \U0001D6FD is the \nparameter to be estimated. Based on Green (2012) and\
    \ Cameron and Trivedi (2010), the log- \nlikelihood function for probit can be\
    \ expressed as: \n\U0001D459\U0001D45B\U0001D43F = ∑\n\U0001D464\U0001D456\U0001D459\

    \ variables are arranged to make it appropriate for two different models. In \n\
    irrigation technology adoption estimation, the dependent variable is a dummy variable\
    \ that \nrepresents furrow (1 for furrow and 0 for other) and other irrigation.\
    \ From Table 3.1, on average, \n45% and 28% of respondents had adopted furrow\
    \ irrigation in soybean and corn production \nrespectively. For the multivariate\
    \ fractional regression model, dependent variables are fractions \nof irrigated\
    \ acres under different irrigation technology. This consists of four categories\
    \ of \nfractions representing 9%, 39%, 6.6%, and 45% for flood, furrow, center\
    \ pivot, and non-irrigated \nacres, respectively. Samples used in estimating acreage\
    \ allocation are not crop specific. This \nconsiders all irrigated and non-irrigated\
    \ acres under operation producing different crops. \nConcerning the educational\
    \ attainment of the principal farm operator, 32%, 23%, 30%, and 9% \nhave a high\
    \ school degree, some college, bachelor’s degree, or graduate or professional\
    \ degree, \nrespectively. However, I have regrouped this into two categories (some\
    \ college or less and 4-year \ndegree or more). Farm revenue represents the total\
    \ farm income during the crop year. This shows \nthat around 51% of farmers have\
    \ an income below 100,000 dollars, around 26% have an income \nin the range of\
    \ 100,000 – 500,000 dollars, and 23% of respondents have income above 500,000\
    \ \ndollars per year. The risk variable represents the farmer’s attitude towards\
    \ an investment \ndecision. We can see that around 39%, 37%, and 24% of respondents\
    \ are risk averse, risk \nneutral, or risk lovers respectively. Extension and\
    \ neighbors are dummy variables representing \nthe sources of information that\
    \ farmers rely on for water conservation or irrigation cost reduction \ninformation.\
    \ From Table 3.1, around 45% and 24% of respondents rely on the extension service\
    \ \nor their neighbors as their source of information. Rent is a dummy variable\
    \ that represents the \nrental status of the farm under operation. We can see\
    \ that around 58% of respondents are \ninvolved in a farm rental (rent in/rent\
    \ out) process. Other variables used in this study are the \n58 \n \ndistance\
    \ to the nearest market or town, distance to the nearest equipment dealer, energy\
    \ cost, and \nspousal educational attainment.  \n3.4 Results and Discussion \n\

    \ of both soybean and corn irrigation are presented in column 1 and column \n\
    3 in Table 3.2. These coefficients are useful in explaining the impact direction\
    \ of variables \nrelated to irrigation technology adoption (positive or negative\
    \ impact). For example, the \neducation of the farmer, his risk attitude (averse\
    \ and neutral), and the distance to town are \nnegatively associated with furrow\
    \ irrigation technology adoption in both soybean and corn \nirrigation. However,\
    \ estimated coefficients are significant in the case of soybean, but \ninsignificant\
    \ in corn irrigation technology adoption. Similarly, using neighbors as a source\
    \ of \ninformation, rental status, landholding, and laser leveling variables are\
    \ significant and positively \nassociated with furrow irrigation technology adoption\
    \ in soybean production. In the case of corn \nirrigation, energy cost, laser\
    \ leveling, spousal education, and rental status are positively \nassociated with\
    \ furrow irrigation adoption.  \n \n  Column 2 and column 4 in Table 3.2 display\
    \ the marginal effects of variables in soybean \nand corn irrigation technology\
    \ adoption. Marginal effect values have better explanatory power \nthan the estimated\
    \ coefficients in a discrete choice model, especially in economics. From Table\
    \ \n3.2 (column 2), educational attainment (EDU) of farmers and their risk aversion\
    \ attitude are \nhighly significant, at a 1% significance level for furrow irrigation\
    \ adoption. Using neighbors as a \nsource of information (NBR), laser leveling\
    \ (LASER), landholding (ACRE), and rental status \n(RENT) are significant at a\
    \ 5% significance level. Likewise, distance from the farm to the \nnearest town\
    \ (DISTOWN) is significant at a 10% significance level. Since education is a \n\
    categorical variable, it needs to be interpreted accordingly. Indications are\
    \ that the expected \nprobability of furrow irrigation adoption among farmers\
    \ having an educational level higher than \nsome college is likely to be 23% lower\
    \ than that of farmers with an educational level below some \ncollege degree.\
    \ The expected probability of furrow irrigation adoption by risk-averse farmers\
    \ \n60 \n \n(RISKD2) seems to be 29% lower and that of risk-neutral (RISKD3) farmers’\
    \ is 19% lower than \nthat of farmers who are characterized as risk lovers. Similarly,\
    \ other things remaining constant, \nper unit increase in distance to town reduces\
    \ the expected probability of furrow irrigation \nadoption by 0.8%. A negative\
    \ impact seems to be unexpected. However, it could be possible that \nfarmers\
    \ in remote areas are more concerned about efficient irrigation water management\
    \ and thus \nare motivated to act accordingly. All else remaining constant, increase\
    \ in per acre land holding \nincreases the expected probability to rise by less\
    \ than 1%, but adoption probability for rented \nland is 16% higher than that\
    \ for non-rented land. This could possibly be that because of the huge \ninvestment\
    \ requirement for an advanced irrigation system, the landlord might be unwilling\
    \ to \ninvest in it. In this case, the farmer might employ a conventional irrigation\
    \ system. Similarly, \namong farmers who rely on neighboring farmers as their\
    \ sources of information, the probability \nof furrow irrigation adoption is 14%\
    \ higher than that of farmers using other sources of \ninformation. Among farmers\
    \ who have adopted laser leveling, the probability of furrow irrigation \nadoption\
    \ is likely to be 15% higher than other farmers. \n \nSince this study has utilized\
    \ pooled data from the year 2015 and 2016, year specific \ncharacteristics could\
    \ have different impact in our results. We used a year dummy variable to \ndetermine\
    \ if there is such impact in our results. The Estimated results using year dummy\
    \ did not \nproduce significantly different values compared to the results obtained\
    \ without year dummy \nexcept very small change in intercept term. Additionally,\
    \ we did not receive response twice from \na particular respondent and hence the\
    \ possibility of using repeated sample was almost zero.  \n \nIn the case of corn\
    \ irrigation, the marginal effect of education and risk aversion attitude \nhas\
    \ an insignificant effect on furrow irrigation adoption, but is properly signed\
    \ and is consistent \nwith the results obtained for soybean irrigation. Energy\
    \ cost (ENERGYC) has a very small \n61 \n \npositive impact, rented farm operators\
    \ show a 13% higher probability of adopting furrow \nirrigation; producers using\
    \ neighbors as source of information show a 10% higher probability; \ndistance\
    \ to the equipment dealers (DISTEQP) reduces the adoption probability by less\
    \ than 1%; \nhaving a spouse with higher education increases the probability by\
    \ 10%; and laser leveling \nincreases the probability by 14%. The degree of impact\
    \ on corn irrigation technology seems to be \nsmall due to the fact that the number\
    \ of samples available was limited as compared to the \nnumber of samples for\
    \ soybeans.  \nIndeed, laser leveling is directly related to furrow irrigation\
    \ and NRCS provides financial \nsupport for laser leveling as well. We suspect\
    \ that this variable could be endogenous and might \nbe creating an endogeneity\
    \ problem in our estimation results. In order to address the problem, an \nappropriate\
    \ instrumental variable (DISTEQP) is identified to estimate the parameter using\
    \ the \nIV-probit method. A variable representing distance to the equipment dealer\
    \ is used as an \ninstrumental variable. Farmers close to the equipment dealer\
    \ get more information regarding \nlaser leveling and thus are more likely to\
    \ adopt it. Hence, distance to the equipment dealer could \nbe a better instrumental\
    \ variable in this case. Table 3.3 displays the estimated results, which \ninclude\
    \ coefficients of first stage regression that justify the appropriateness of the\
    \ instrumental \nvariable. First stage results show that the instrumental variable\
    \ is highly significant, the F-value \nis above 10, and the t-value is above 4.\
    \ By rule of thumb, the instrumental variable is justifiable. \nFurthermore, the\
    \ Wald test for exogeneity of the instrumental variables has a chi-square value\
    \ of \n5.6 with a p-value of 0.01 for the soybean irrigation case, so we reject\
    \ the null hypothesis of no \nendogeneity. This indicates that the instrument\
    \ is not weak.  \n \n \n62 \n \nTable 3.3. Estimated results using IV-probit model\

    \ affected by educational attainment, \nlaser leveling, and land holding. Marginal\
    \ effect values obtained from the IV-probit method are \nhigher than those obtained\
    \ from the probit method.  On average, the expected probability of \nfurrow irrigation\
    \ adoption by farmers with a college degree or higher is 45% lower than that of\
    \ \nfarmers with an education below the college degree. Our findings are similar\
    \ to Toma et al. \n(2018), which states that education influences both behavior\
    \ and intentions indirectly through \nprofit orientation and perceived usefulness\
    \ of the information source. Education and information \naccess were found to\
    \ be among the factors influencing multiple technology adoption.  Educated \n\
    farmers are more likely to access useful information and tend to adopt it in their\
    \ farming \npractices. Increase per acre of landholding increases the expected\
    \ probability by less than 1%. \nHowever, after using an instrumental variable,\
    \ the impact of laser leveling on furrow irrigation \n64 \n \nadoption is higher\
    \ than that which was found in probit estimation. Other variables are not \nsignificant\
    \ but are properly signed. The marginal effect -0.16 for extension indicates that\
    \ the use \nof extension services has a negative impact on furrow irrigation adoption,\
    \ implying that \nstrengthening extension services could have effective policy\
    \ implications towards water \nconservation efforts, irrigation productivity,\
    \ and sustainability.  \n3.4.2 Acreage allocation \nIn this estimation, dependent\
    \ variables are fractions of acres of land under flood, furrow, or \ncenter pivot\
    \ irrigation systems, and the non-irrigated farm. We suspected an endogeneity\
    \ \nproblem caused by the laser leveling variable in the technology adoption estimation\
    \ and used an \nIV-probit method to estimate the impact. However, in multivariate\
    \ fractional regression, we do \nnot have a direct option to use IV regression.\
    \ In order to address that problem, the predicted \nvalue is obtained by regressing\
    \ laser leveling on the distance to equipment dealer variable and \nthen using\
    \ predicted value “ELASER” as an explanatory variable that acts as an instrumental\
    \ \nvariable in the multivariate fractional regression. The standard error may\
    \ not be correct, but \nAngrist and Pischke (2008) state, “Carefully applied to\
    \ coherent causal questions, regression and \n2SLS almost always make sense. Your\
    \ standard error probably won’t be quite right, but they \nrarely are. Avoid embarrassment\
    \ by being your own best skeptic—and, especially, Don’t Panic!” \nTable 3.5 displays\
    \ the estimated marginal effect, considering a fraction of the non-irrigated farm\
    \ \nas the base category. The economic interpretation is that estimated variables\
    \ using marginal \neffect values have better explanatory power than general coefficients.\

    \ for center pivot acreage allocation is \nnegative 0.079, which indicates that\
    \ farmers having educational attainment above some college \nare likely to allocate\
    \ 7% less to center pivot irrigated acreage than farmers having education less\
    \ \nthan some college. The potential reason might be that more educated farmers\
    \ may seek even \nbetter irrigation technology, such as drip irrigation or similar\
    \ technologies (possibly they might \nbe interested in irrigation technologies\
    \ consisting of surge valves, flow meters, or moisture/soil \nsensors). Higher\
    \ education tends to reduce furrow irrigated acreage allocation as it is negatively\
    \ \n66 \n \nsigned, but it is not significant. Risk-averse farmers tend to allocate\
    \ 26% less for furrow irrigated \nacreage, 5% less for center pivot irrigated\
    \ acreage, and 24% more for non-irrigated acreage than \nrisk loving farmers.\
    \ Risk-neutral farmers tend to allocate 25% less for furrow irrigated acreage,\
    \ \n7% less for center pivot irrigated acreage, and 27% more for non-irrigated\
    \ acreage than risk \nloving farmers. The per unit increase in energy cost increases\
    \ the proportion of furrow irrigated \narea by less than 1% and reduces the non-irrigated\
    \ acreage by less than 1% as well. Farmers \nutilizing extension services for\
    \ irrigation information tend to allocate 18% less acreage to non-\nirrigated\
    \ acreage than farmers utilizing no extension services. This shows the importance\
    \ of \nextension services in issues associated with irrigation efficiency, water\
    \ productivity, and farm \nyield. Regarding farming experience, one more year\
    \ of farm experience tends to reduce the \nflood-irrigated acreage by less than\
    \ 1%, which implies that specialization in farming tends to \nfavor efficient\
    \ irrigation technology over an inefficient furrow irrigation system. Per unit\
    \ of \nlandholding tends to reduce furrow irrigated acreage and increases the\
    \ use of center pivot \nacreage. Farmers having more land receive higher incomes\
    \ and can invest in efficient irrigation \ntechnology. Similarly, farmers using\
    \ rented land tend to allocate 24% more furrow irrigated land \nthan producers\
    \ farming their own land. However, rental farm operators tend to allocate less\
    \ \nacreage to center pivot irrigation. The marginal effect value of “ELASER”\
    \ is significant at 1%, \n10%, and 5% for furrow acreage, center pivot acreage,\
    \ and non-irrigated acreage, respectively. \nThe predicted value of laser leveling\
    \ tends to increase furrow irrigated acreage by 91%, reduces \ncenter pivot acreage\
    \ by 20%, and reduces non-irrigated acreage by 68%, respectively. This \nfinding\
    \ is consistent with the values obtained in determinants of irrigation technology\
    \ adoption \nestimation.    \n  \n67 \n \n3.4.3 Policy implication and discussion\
    \ \nIn both estimations (irrigation technology adoption and acreage allocation),\
    \ the most influential \nfactors seem to be education, risk attitude, land holding,\
    \ and laser leveling. More educated \nfarmers tend to adopt a center pivot or\
    \ even more efficient irrigation system and minimize the \nuse of an inefficient\
    \ furrow irrigation system. More educated farmers are innovative in farming \n\
    and willing to find better production methods. Here, education reflects formal\
    \ educational \nattainment in a direct sense, but it can also be applied to informal\
    \ education, such as training, \nparticipation in workshops, and agricultural\
    \ visits as well. Making farmers more educated (with a \nformal degree) is not\
    \ under our control. But, in an indirect sense, we can make farmers educated \n\
    by involving them in different types of short term training associated with crop\
    \ production, \nresource management, and farm management issues through land grant\
    \ university extension \nservice. The role of the extension services is crucial\
    \ in these issues as well as in disseminating \ninformation concerning the new\
    \ development of production technologies. Many studies \n(Hunecke et al., 2017;\
    \ Adeoti, 2009; and Krishnan and Patnam, 2013) have demonstrated the \nimportance\
    \ of extension services in technology adoption. It is also evident that trust\
    \ in the \ninstitution, networking, and social capital are influential factors\
    \ on technology adoption.  \nExtension services can play a strong role in building\
    \ up social capital and networking. \nAdditionally, our sample response indicates\
    \ that furrow irrigation without adopting irrigation \npractices (valve meters,\
    \ surge flows, sensor meters) is the commonly practiced irrigation method \nin\
    \ Louisiana. Even in the furrow irrigation method, adoption of irrigation practices\
    \ can help to \nminimize a significant amount of water use per acre while providing\
    \ the required amount of \nmoisture for crops, as it has been determined that\
    \ adoption of irrigation practices can conserve a \nsignificant amount of water\
    \ in furrow irrigation technology as well (Bryant et al., 2017). In order \n68\
    \ \n \nto motivate farmers to implement irrigation practices, an active and effective\
    \ role of the \nextension service could be productive, as we find that extension\
    \ services have a negative \nassociation with furrow irrigation adoption in our\
    \ estimation. Hence, extension services need to \nbe strengthened. If water conservation\
    \ is a major concern, and the investment in an efficient \nirrigation system is\
    \ the major constraint for its adoption, some kind of incentives or subsidies\
    \ \nwould be helpful. While formulating irrigation policy, motivational incentives\
    \ for adoption of \nirrigation management need to be considered. A policy should\
    \ address ways that farmers would \nbe encouraged to adopt efficient irrigation\
    \ technology and allocate more acreage for water-\nefficient irrigation technology.\
    \  \n \nThis study suffers from some limitations, such as the limited number of\
    \ sample responses \navailable, and the lack of additional information on input,\
    \ precipitation, and farm quality. \nIrrigation technology adoption decisions\
    \ depend on many factors, such as soil characteristics, \nweather conditions,\
    \ temperature, and rainfall, which are lacking in this study. In future studies,\
    \ \nthese variables need to be incorporated so as to get even better estimates.\
    \ The sample size is \nalways a crucial component in any empirical work. In a\
    \ further study, the sample size needs to be \nincreased for robust results. \
    \     \n 3.5 Conclusion \nWater availability for irrigation has not been a significant\
    \ concern in Louisiana until recently. \nThe heightened urgency is the result\
    \ of a reduced groundwater level, the presence of a cone of \ndepression, and\
    \ saltwater intrusion in some of the major aquifers in the state.  \nAs of 2018\
    \ according to the USDA report15, 71.8 percent of the total Louisiana corn area\
    \ \nand 42.8 percent of the entire soybean area are irrigated. Irrigation has\
    \ been increasingly used by \n                                               \
    \            \n15 https://www.fsa.usda.gov/news-room/efoia/electronic-reading-room/frequently-requested-\n\
    information/crop-acreage-data/index . \n69 \n \nfarmers as a risk prevention strategy\
    \ in crop production in the state. Concerns related to aquifer \nhealth have motivated\
    \ farmers and policymakers to adopt, suggest, and in some cases incentivize \n\
    efficient irrigation technology adoption along with irrigation water management\
    \ practices. The \ncenter pivot irrigation technology is more water efficient\
    \ than the commonly used furrow \nirrigation system. However, producers are reluctant\
    \ to switch to more efficient irrigation \ntechnology because of the high initial\
    \ investment cost. Efficient irrigation technology is \ngenerally viewed as a\
    \ feasible way to reduce water used for agricultural production. However, a \n\
    few studies have shown that the conversion to more efficient irrigation technology\
    \ causes \nrebound effects. The rebound effect implies that the adoption of an\
    \ efficient irrigation technology \nis a necessary but not sufficient way to conserve\
    \ water. If water conservation is the concern, \npotential rebound effects of\
    \ new technology adoption should be taken into consideration. \nIrrigation water\
    \ management practices, including surge flow irrigation, computerized hole \n\
    selection, and sensor-based irrigation scheduling, even in a furrow irrigation\
    \ system, should \nenhance irrigation efficiency and thus conserve a significant\
    \ amount of water.  \nThe primary objective of this study was to determine the\
    \ factors affecting irrigation \ntechnology adoption and acreage allocation for\
    \ different irrigation technologies in Louisiana \ncrop production. For this purpose,\
    \ we conducted a statewide mail survey in 2016 to collect \ninformation regarding\
    \ irrigation practices and concerns among the producers in the state. We use \n\
    an IV-probit model to estimate the determinants of irrigation technology adoption.\
    \ Regarding the \ndeterminants of acreage allocation estimation, a multivariate\
    \ fractional regression model is used. \nThe dependent variables consist of four\
    \ fractional categories of acreage under four different \nirrigation technologies.\
    \ Estimated results indicate that education, extension service, and risk \naversion\
    \ have negative effects, whereas landholding, laser leveling, and rent status\
    \ have a \n70 \n \npositive association with furrow irrigation acreage allocation\
    \ by farmers. Similarly, energy cost, \nfarm revenue, rent status, and extension\
    \ services are likely to increase center pivot acreage \nallocation. The findings\
    \ of this study should be beneficial to those who are concerned about \nwater\
    \ productivity and water resource conservation. Additionally, the results could\
    \ have greater \npolicy implications, especially in formulating effective tools\
    \ to promote efficient irrigation \ntechnology adoption.  \n3.6 References \n\

    \ IN LOUISIANA \nCROP PRODUCTION USING STOCHASTIC FRONTIER ANALYSIS AND DATA \n\
    ENVELOPMENT METHOD \n \n4.1 Introduction \nImproving irrigation water use efficiency\
    \ and crop productivity are major concerns in the \nagricultural sector. Water\
    \ use efficiency is directly associated with farm profitability, soil health,\
    \ \nwater quality, water conservation, and sustainable use. Water is essential\
    \ to agricultural \nproduction with uses comprising irrigation, washing, and livestock.\
    \ In Louisiana, around 70% of \nthe total cropland was irrigated using groundwater\
    \ and surface water sources in the crop year \n2017 according to the USDA report.16\
    \ A furrow/flood irrigation system is the most common \nirrigation method in Louisiana.\
    \ It is well evidenced that irrigation water application efficiency is \nrelatively\
    \ lower in a furrow irrigation system compared to center pivot and drip irrigation\
    \ \n(Amosson et al., 2011; Guerrero et al., 2016). Even in a furrow irrigation\
    \ system, adoption of \nsurge valves, flow meters, and soil moisture sensors in\
    \ irrigation practices can help to reduce \nwater use significantly while still\
    \ providing the required amount of water for crops. However, in \nour irrigation\
    \ survey, more than 50% of the respondents reported that they use furrow irrigation,\
    \ \nand the majority of producers have not yet practiced the aforementioned technologies.\
    \ A report \non water use in Louisiana prepared by Sargent (2012) mentioned that\
    \ farmers withdrew \napproximately 180 Mgal/day of groundwater and 57 Mgal/day\
    \ of surface water for crops other \nthan rice in 2009. Water withdrawals increased\
    \ in 37 of the 64 parishes in Louisiana by 58% \nfrom 2005 to 2010, during which\
    \ time groundwater withdrawals for general irrigation increased \n           \
    \                                                \n16 United States Department\
    \ of Agriculture (USDA), Crop Acreage Data (2017). Available at: \nhttp://www.fsa.usda.gov/news-room/efoia/electronic-reading-room/frequently-requested-\n\
    information/crop-acreage-data/index  \n \n74 \n \nby 16% and surface-water withdrawals\
    \ increased by 22%. Additionally, water use for general \nirrigation occurred\
    \ primarily in northeastern Louisiana, where 85% (160 Mgal/day) of the \ngroundwater\
    \ was withdrawn from the Mississippi River alluvial aquifer (ibid). This scenario\
    \ \nindicates the presence of some sort of irrigation water use and production\
    \ inefficiency that needs \nto be identified by an appropriate estimation method.\
    \ The primary focus of this study is to \nestimate water use efficiency and detect\
    \ factors causing such inefficiency.  \nSargent (2011) indicates that Louisiana\
    \ farmers used approximately 240Mgal/day of \nwater for general irrigation, while\
    \ groundwater contributed about 75% (180 Mgal/day) in 2010. \nIn terms of average\
    \ water use in Louisiana, approximately 8,500 Mgal/day of water was \nwithdrawn,\
    \ total groundwater withdrawals were about 1,600 Mgal/d, and total surface-water\
    \ \nwithdrawals were about 7,000 Mgal/day. Surprisingly, general irrigation withdrawals\
    \ in \nLouisiana have increased by 780% since 1960. If that trend continues, the\
    \ overexploitation of \ngroundwater increases the risk of water table decline\
    \ that leads to water quality deterioration as \nwell as the consequences of the\
    \ high cost of water pumping. As we know, an extra inch/acre of \nirrigation water\
    \ use imposes an additional cost to farmers that reduces the net farm profit.\
    \ \nAdditionally, signs of a salt water dome as evidenced by many studies coupled\
    \ with saltwater \nintrusion in the coastal region caused by sea level rise would\
    \ make water quality even worse in \nthe future. In response to the potential\
    \ risk associated with water quality and quantity, water \nconservation is one\
    \ of the tools for the sustainable use of water resources. Efficient use of \n\
    irrigation water can help to minimize water loss. For this, appropriate water\
    \ management is an \nessential step towards that goal. It is an agreed upon fact\
    \ that under irrigation and over irrigation \nboth have drawbacks in terms of\
    \ nutrient leaching, susceptibility to disease, water loss, and loss \nin yield.\
    \ Under irrigation generally results in low production and quality, whereas over\
    \ irrigation \n75 \n \nmay result in environmental pollution because of possible\
    \ nutrient leaching, additional water \npumping cost, unproductive use of energy\
    \ for pumping water, and the possibility of disease. In \nresponse to the need\
    \ to manage water resources, efficiency analysis would provide valuable \ninsights\
    \ to enable producers to optimize productivity, minimize farm operation cost leading\
    \ to \noptimal profit, minimize water loss, and minimize environmental degradation.\
    \ Production and \nirrigation efficiency information would provide producers with\
    \ the means to re-evaluate their \nirrigation scheduling so as to achieve higher\
    \ water application productivity. \nMany studies have evaluated irrigation scheduling\
    \ in terms of irrigation technology \nefficiency and profitability under water\
    \ supply constraints.  Peterson & Ding (2005) evaluate the \neffect of irrigation\
    \ efficiency on irrigation water use in the High Plains, taking into account \n\
    irrigation timing and well capacity limits. The findings indicate that optimal\
    \ irrigation does not \nrespond monotonically to changes in efficiency, although\
    \ intermediate and high-efficiency \nsystems both result in less water use than\
    \ an inefficient flood system. Paudel et al. (2005) \ndeveloped a dynamic model\
    \ to optimize irrigation water allocation during water deficit periods \nfor three\
    \ major crops grown in the humid southeastern United States. Their analysis involved\
    \ the \nuse of crop simulation models to capture (a) the yield water relationship\
    \ and (b) soil moisture \ndynamics from one week to next. Results indicated that\
    \ farmers should irrigate the most valuable \ncrop first before applying water\
    \ to other crops. Furthermore, an increase in crop acreage did not \nincrease\
    \ the net revenue of the farm in a proportionate amount due to restriction on\
    \ the total \nwater supply. Most of the studies on irrigation efficiency are agronomic\
    \ or engineering based. \nThe present study uses a parametric as well as a non-parametric\
    \ approach to estimate efficiency, \nfocusing on an economic perspective.    \n\
    76 \n \nThe primary aim of this study is to access the irrigation and objective\
    \ estimates of the \ntechnical efficiency of irrigation water use and soybean\
    \ production using both parametric and \nnon-parametric estimation methods. The\
    \ secondary objective is to detect factors causing \ninefficiency in the production\
    \ process and to suggest an appropriate policy tool for corrective \nmeasures.\
    \ In an evaluation of sustainable farming, production efficiency and irrigation\
    \ water use \nproductivity need to be incorporated. Farmers may seek to maximize\
    \ production and profit per \nunit of water, known as financial sustainability,\
    \ while the environmentally sustainable system \nseeks to minimize the use of\
    \ water volume in production (Knox et al., 2012). These two \ncontrasting approaches\
    \ between financial and social sustainability to efficiency regarding \nagricultural\
    \ productivity and resource conservation require a management approach that \n\
    simultaneously takes into consideration sustainability, agricultural productivity,\
    \ and net profit \n(Vico and Porporato, 2011). In order to achieve such sustainable\
    \ production, an evaluation of \nirrigation efficiency and production efficiency\
    \ would provide a benchmarking tool to access \nwater efficiency at the farm level\
    \ and provide valuable information to improve farm productivity \nby identifying\
    \ factors associated with production inefficiency. This issue is new in the context\
    \ of \nLouisiana since it has not been studied at the farm level previously. This\
    \ is the novelty of the \nstudy as well.  \nThe remainder of this essay is organized\
    \ in the following way. Section 2 provides a \nrelevant literature review concerning\
    \ irrigation and production efficiency analysis using a data \nenvelopment approach\
    \ and stochastic frontier analysis. Section 3 presents the model \nspecification\
    \ and estimation process, section 4 provides data description, chapter 5 presents\
    \ the \nestimated results, and section 6 addresses the policy implications and\
    \ limitations of this study. \nFinally, there is also provided a brief summary\
    \ and concluding remarks about the essay.   \n77 \n \n4.2 Literature Review \n\
    4.2.1 Stochastic frontier analysis  \nOver the past four decades, the stochastic\
    \ frontier analysis method has been widely used by \nmany researchers to estimate\
    \ efficiency and to detect the factors associated with inefficiency. It \nis a\
    \ parametric approach that specifies the unobserved error of the cost, revenue,\
    \ production or \nprofit to accommodate for inefficiency and random shock. However,\
    \ an analytical review of \nirrigation efficiency conducted by Pereira and Marques\
    \ (2017) considering 32 published works \nup until 2016 notes that a very limited\
    \ number of studies have used the stochastic frontier \nanalysis method to estimate\
    \ irrigation efficiency scores in North America. The majority of the \nstudies\
    \ concerning irrigation water efficiency analysis have used the data envelopment\
    \ method. \nCoelli (1995) has surveyed different procedures used in estimating\
    \ production frontier function \nand efficiencies measurement and has also evaluated\
    \ technical, allocative, scale and overall \nefficiencies relative to these estimated\
    \ frontiers. Coelli’s study explains the appropriateness of \nthe stochastic frontier\
    \ analysis approach in agricultural production efficiency analysis as this \n\
    method allows us to conduct statistical tests of hypotheses regarding the production\
    \ structure and \nthe degree of inefficiency. A brief summary of the literature\
    \ associated with irrigation water use \nand production efficiency analysis using\
    \ the stochastic frontier analysis method is presented \nbelow. \nMost of the\
    \ literature associated with efficiency analysis assumes that the decision-\n\
    making unit shares similar production technology but differs only in the level\
    \ of inefficiency. \nNjuki and Bravo-Ureta (2018) estimate irrigation water use\
    \ efficiency across several counties in \nthe U.S. using a random parameter-stochastic\
    \ production frontier approach and analyze how \ntechnical efficiency relates\
    \ to irrigation water use efficiency. They utilize USDA census data \n78 \n \n\
    from 1997 to 2012 for efficiency estimation. In the estimation process, they take\
    \ into account \ncross-country variations in production possibilities as well\
    \ as heterogeneity in the production \nenvironment. The estimated results show\
    \ that the average irrigation water use efficiency and \ntechnical efficiency\
    \ (TE) are 72.6% and 83.6% respectively. A strong correlation between \ntechnical\
    \ efficiency and water use efficiency indicates that an effort to increase irrigation\
    \ water \nuse efficiency also raises technical efficiency at the farm level. Additionally,\
    \ they reveal that the \ndistribution of the elasticity of irrigation withdrawals\
    \ varies widely across the counties, and \nirrigation withdrawals have a statistically\
    \ significant impact on output. Western U.S. states \nexhibit relatively higher\
    \ technical efficiency and irrigation water use efficiency, as this region \n\
    heavily relies on irrigation for agricultural production.  \nAn advanced irrigation\
    \ technology itself is not sufficient for achieving a higher efficiency \nlevel.\
    \ Water management capability also plays an important role in water productivity\
    \ and \nefficiency improvement. Karagiannis et al. (2003) apply an alternative\
    \ approach to measure \nirrigation water efficiency that is based on the concept\
    \ of input-specific TE. They use a randomly \nselected sample of 50 out-of-season\
    \ vegetable producing farms in Crete, Greece. They provide \ninformation on how\
    \ much water use could be minimized without affecting the level of output, \n\
    technology, and input used. The estimated results show that average irrigation\
    \ efficiency is much \nlower than TE, implying that a significant amount of groundwater\
    \ waste can be reduced if \nproducers become more efficient in the use of irrigation\
    \ water. This finding contradicts the belief \nthat advanced irrigation technology\
    \ improves the efficient use of irrigation water, avoiding waste \nof water use,\
    \ as they notice that farmers utilizing modern greenhouse technology are unable\
    \ to \nachieve their water saving potential fully. Additionally, they find that\
    \ modern greenhouse \ntechnologies, education, and an extension service are positively\
    \ associated with the degree of \n79 \n \nirrigation efficiency. Likewise, farming\
    \ intensity, chemical use, and land rental percentage are \nnegatively associated\
    \ with irrigation efficiency. Most important was the promotion of key drivers\
    \ \nof water conservation behavior that have the potential to improve demand-side\
    \ water \nmanagement in the long run that would be beneficial towards the sustainable\
    \ use of the water \nresource. These key drivers of water conservation behavior\
    \ are generally pro-environmental \nbehavior and efforts made to find information\
    \ about water-related matters (Dolnicar et al., 2012).  \nWhen there is a water\
    \ supply deficit, the community’s initiation into water allocation and \nwater\
    \ management can improve water productivity and on-farm irrigation efficiency.\
    \ Chaudhry \n(2018) evaluates irrigation water use efficiency in conjunction with\
    \ how the reorganization of \nirrigation management plays a role in achieving\
    \ better water management in Panjab, Pakistan. \nThe study uses a stochastic frontier\
    \ analysis approach to estimate the efficiency level using farm-\nlevel survey\
    \ data. Estimated results indicate that the improved collective action in irrigation\
    \ \nwater management in a community has a significant positive effect on achieving\
    \ higher on-farm \nwater use efficiency. On average, on-farm water use efficiency\
    \ is higher for farmers belonging to \ncommunities that take an active role (that\
    \ is, active in water course maintenance, dispute \nresolution, voting). This\
    \ implies that collective action on water management is an effective tool \nfor\
    \ achieving better water use efficiency. The findings are not explicit in relation\
    \ to whether \ncommunity performance itself can be considered to have a causal\
    \ impact on on-farm water use \nefficiency. They do clarify that the observed\
    \ variations in water use efficiency can not \nnecessarily be attributed to community\
    \ effectiveness in water management, but are also jointly \ndetermined by other\
    \ factors. Under the circumstances of significant saltwater concentration, \n\
    higher irrigation water demand, and very weak irrigation efficiency, it is extremely\
    \ important to \nidentify the loopholes associated with water management and apply\
    \ appropriate corrective \n80 \n \nmeasures to achieve better water productivity.\
    \ In this nexus, Dhehibi et al. (2007) measure \nirrigation water efficiency based\
    \ on the concept of input-oriented TE using a stochastic \nproduction frontier\
    \ analysis approach in Tunisia. Estimated results using a sample of 144 citrus\
    \ \nfarms indicated that the average irrigation water efficiency is lower than\
    \ the technical efficiency, \nsuggesting that the same level of output can be\
    \ produced using the same amount of input while \nsaving around 47% of water.\
    \ Furthermore, the findings indicate that the age of the farm operator, \neducational\
    \ level, agricultural training, and the farm size tend to influence both irrigation\
    \ water \nuse efficiency and technical efficiency positively. \nThe productivity\
    \ analysis of firms using the input distance function in association with \nthe\
    \ agglomeration hypothesis can provide useful information having effective policy\
    \ \nimplications for productivity enhancement. In this context, Hailu and James\
    \ Deaton (2016) \nexamine the agglomeration hypothesis using a stochastic input\
    \ distant function with \nheteroscedastic inefficiency effects.17 Estimated results\
    \ using Ontario dairy farm data for the \nperiod of 2007-2008 indicate that the\
    \ density of dairy farms has a significant positive economic \neffect on production\
    \ efficiency. The relevance of this study is that the concept of addressing the\
    \ \nheteroscedastic inefficiency effect would be utilized in our efficiency estimation.\
    \ \n  It is generally believed that irrigation efficiency improvement through\
    \ an advanced \nirrigation technology adoption would result in water conservation\
    \ and the sustainable use of the \nwater resource. However, recent studies reveal\
    \ that efficient irrigation technology may result in a \n                    \
    \                                       \n17 This concept is widely studied in\
    \ urban economics. It states that the productivity efficiency of a firm \nincreases\
    \ by closer proximity. Agglomeration economies are believed to arise because firms\
    \ can lower \nthe production cost by sharing certain resources, may be able to\
    \ lower transportation and transaction \ncost, and thus would be able to increase\
    \ the revenues. In irrigation efficiency analysis, this concept may \nnot be appropriate.\
    \ However, it has some relevance in this study because of its methodological aspects.\
    \   \n81 \n \nrebound effect.18 For example, Adamson and Loch (2014) show that\
    \ an advancement in the \nirrigation system may encourage inflexible production\
    \ systems that fail to respond to future \nwater scarcity, and technical efficiency\
    \ gain may reduce return flows in the context of Australia. \nMolle and Tanouti\
    \ (2017) reveal that adoption of a drip irrigation system in Morocco tends to\
    \ be \nassociated with higher crop density, expansion in the cultivated area,\
    \ and a shift to water-\nintensive crops, resulting in higher water consumption.\
    \ In this line of study, Berbel et al. (2018) \npresent a microeconomic analytical\
    \ approach to evaluate water conserving investment and the \nresulting irrigation\
    \ water use efficiency and field level water consumption in Spain. Results \n\
    indicate that efficiency gains tend to reduce water use significantly, implying\
    \ that the potential \nrebound effect is not associated with irrigation efficiency.\
    \  \n  Landholding status and farm operators’ characteristics, such as rental\
    \ status, rental \nperiod, off-farm employment, farm size, and migration status,\
    \ may influence farming efficiency. \nIn this context, Feng (2008) evaluates farm\
    \ level rice production efficiency in the north-east \nJiangxi province of China\
    \ using a stochastic frontier analysis approach. Estimated results \nindicate\
    \ that the technical efficiency of rice production ranged from 0.36 to 0.97, with\
    \ the \naverage TE being 0.82. The study further reveals that a household that\
    \ rented land achieved a \nhigher TE than a household that did not rent land.\
    \ Participation in migration and off-farm \nemployment did not have an effect\
    \ on TE in rice production. Tang et al. (2015) estimate farm-\nlevel irrigation\
    \ water use efficiency using a stochastic frontier analysis approach with the\
    \ data \nobtained from 347 wheat producers in Guanzhong Plain, China. Estimated\
    \ results indicate that \nthe average technical, allocative, and overall economic\
    \ efficiency are 0.35, 0.86, and 0.80, \nrespectively. Additionally, they reveal\
    \ that producers’ perceptions concerning water scarcity, \n                  \
    \                                         \n18 Modernization in irrigation systems\
    \ may have undesirable consequences in terms of an increase in \namount of water\
    \ use.  \n82 \n \nwater price, and irrigation infrastructure increase the irrigation\
    \ water allocative efficiency. \nHowever, land fragmentation seems to have a negative\
    \ impact on irrigation water allocative \nefficiency.    \n Irrigation water allocation\
    \ in a water supply shortage situation is complex. Higher farm \nproductivity,\
    \ production efficiency, and irrigation efficiency are greatly influenced if farmers\
    \ \nmake a collective decision about available water allocation and the land that\
    \ can be cultivated. \nFarm location from the water reservoir could be an important\
    \ factor for production efficiency. In \nthis context, Kularatne et al. (2017)\
    \ evaluate locational productive performance and its \ndeterminants utilizing\
    \ data obtained from 460 rice producers in Sri Lanka. Estimated results \nusing\
    \ stochastic production frontier analysis approach indicate that tail-end-fields\
    \ (that is, a \ndistance away from the water reservoir) are shown to be the most\
    \ productive in terms of output \nproduced and mean TE compared to other locations.\
    \  \nSome studies have compared technical efficiency when production takes place\
    \ under \ndifferent technological processes. For example, Khanal et al. (2018)\
    \ estimate and compare the \ntechnical efficiency of farming households in three\
    \ ecological regions of Nepal using a stochastic \nmeta-frontier analysis approach.\
    \ Estimated results show that TE derived from the regional \nfrontier is 81%;\
    \ TE obtained from the meta-frontier is 57%; and the technological gap ratio is\
    \ \n70%. A higher efficiency score is obtained for the Terai regions due to better\
    \ production \nconditions. Silva et al. (2017) evaluate the efficiency and technology\
    \ yield gap using a stochastic \nproduction frontier analysis method. Estimated\
    \ results using farm-level survey data obtained \nfrom rice producers in Central\
    \ Luzon, Philippines indicate that the average efficiency yield gap \nis 1.3 ton/ha,\
    \ and the average yield gap for the period 1979-2012 is 3.2 ton/ha. This literature\
    \ \n83 \n \nreview covering a wide range of studies gives a tentative idea of\
    \ what the research gap might be \nand how to address it correctly in Louisiana’s\
    \ case.  \n4.2.2 Literature related to DEA \n The data envelopment approach (DEA)\
    \ is a popular method for measuring the efficiency of \ndecision making units,\
    \ as it is more flexible than the parametric method due to the fact that it is\
    \ \nnot restrictive in the functional form of its data. It assumes that there\
    \ is no random error, \nmeasurement error, or outlier in the data. Due to its\
    \ flexibility, many researchers have been using \nthe DEA method to analyze efficiency\
    \ in many sectors. Pereira and Marques (2017) provide a \ncomprehensive review\
    \ of the empirical literature on methodologies applied to measure irrigation \n\
    efficiency and find that out of 32 studies, 87.5% of them estimated irrigation\
    \ efficiency using the \nDEA method. The DEA method is frequently combined with\
    \ a second- stage analysis to \nunderstand the source of inefficiency. They conclude\
    \ that, in general, farms are considerably \ninefficient with respect to water\
    \ use. Additionally, they note that some factors, such as \nagricultural training,\
    \ larger farm size, installing localized irrigation, having access to better credit\
    \ \nopportunities, extension services, good crop choice, education, and being\
    \ an owner-operated \nfarm, can contribute to an improved efficiency level (ibid).\
    \ Some of the major studies relevant to \nirrigation water efficiency analysis\
    \ using the DEA method are summarized below.  \nIf the irrigation water supply\
    \ is controlled by a specific irrigation union, water \nproductivity is influenced\
    \ by the managerial capability of that water union as well as the \nirrigation\
    \ infrastructure. Sayin and Yilmaz (2015) estimate the relative efficiency scores\
    \ of \nirrigation unions in Turkey using an input-oriented data envelopment model\
    \ with a linear \nprogramming procedure. They find pure technical efficiency and\
    \ scale efficiency to be 0.81 and \n0.95 respectively. They point out the need\
    \ for initiatives in modernizing irrigation systems to \n84 \n \nenhance the long\
    \ run efficiency as a policy tool. Additionally, they emphasize that designing\
    \ \ntraining for the managers and workers of the irrigation unions, adjusting\
    \ the unions based on \nfluctuation in the energy market, and reducing leakage\
    \ in the irrigation system may be beneficial \nto increase the TE of irrigation\
    \ water use. The conventional DEA method provides a radial \nmeasure of efficiency,\
    \ ignoring the slacks in the constraints. For a better understanding of \nefficiency\
    \ scores, the issue of slacks needs to be corrected. Russell measures of TE can\
    \ take into \naccount this issue. In this line of study, Lansink and Ondersteijn\
    \ (2006) evaluate productivity \ngrowth in Dutch greenhouse firms using Russell\
    \ measures of technical efficiency of energy use. \nThey find that the energy\
    \ productivity grew by 2.8% annually in the period 1976-1995, with \ntechnical\
    \ progress being the key factor driving the process of productivity growth, and\
    \ they \nsuggest enhancing the adoption of technological innovations as an effective\
    \ policy tool. In \nanother context, Dhungana et al. (2004) estimate the economic\
    \ inefficiency of Nepalese rice \nfarms with 76 samples using a two-stage data\
    \ envelopment analysis (DEA) method and second \nstage Tobit regression method.\
    \ They find the average relative economic, allocative, technical, \npure technical,\
    \ and scale inefficiencies to be 34, 13, 24, 18, and 7, respectively. They note\
    \ that \nthe inefficiency variations across the sample farms are attributed to\
    \ variations in the ‘use \nintensities’ as well as farm specific attributes such\
    \ as risk attitude, farm operators’ age, gender, \nfarm labor availability, and\
    \ the educational attainment of the farm operator.  \nWater productivity and irrigation\
    \ efficiency depend on water availability. A comparative \nevaluation of irrigation\
    \ efficiency for those who need to purchase irrigation water and for those \n\
    who are able to pump water by their own tube-well may provide valuable information\
    \ to \nproducers and policy makers to formulate appropriate irrigation policies.\
    \ In this context, Watto \nand Mugera (2015) estimate the extent of technical\
    \ and irrigation water efficiency in sugarcane \n85 \n \nproduction in Pakistan\
    \ using a data envelopment method. Estimated results indicate that the \nmean\
    \ technical efficiency score is 0.96 for a tube-well owner and 0.94 for water\
    \ buyers. The \nmean irrigation water efficiency score for the tube-well is 0.86,\
    \ and it is 0.72 for water buyers. \nAlthough a significant number of tube-well\
    \ owners and water buyers seem to be operating at a \nfairly higher technical\
    \ efficiency level, there is considerable potential for enhancing irrigation \n\
    water efficiency. Thus, they suggest a more effective role of extension services\
    \ might be to guide \nproducers to undertake a benefit-cost analysis of available\
    \ technology so as to encourage them to \nachieve an even better irrigation efficiency\
    \ level. Irrigation efficiency analysis at the regional \nlevel provides some\
    \ insight on how to improve water productivity by formulating and employing \n\
    better water management policy in a broader context. In this line, Wang et al.\
    \ (2018) examine \nagricultural water use efficiency in the Heihe River Basin,\
    \ China using a three-stage DEA \nmethod with time series data over the period\
    \ from 2004 to 2013. They calculate technical \nefficiency, pure technical efficiency,\
    \ and scale efficiency in the study area. Results indicate that \nthe technical\
    \ efficiency and scale efficiency decreased in the study area, while the pure\
    \ technical \nefficiency increased, indicating the effects of pure technology\
    \ on improving overall technology \nare very limited, and scale adjustment is\
    \ vitally important to the agricultural production area. \nThus, they recommend\
    \ policymakers make a plan that promotes the efficient use of water \nresources\
    \ in arid and semiarid areas. The findings and recommendations are purely based\
    \ on \nregional level analysis that could be linked into a small scale situation.\
    \ However, farm level \nefficiency analysis would provide more accurate insights\
    \ toward improving irrigation water use \nand production efficiency on a microscale\
    \ farm basis.   \nSome of the studies evaluate allocative and irrigation water\
    \ use efficiency at the province \nlevel, comprising economic subdivisions, social\
    \ subsystems, and cities, using time series data. \n86 \n \nFor example, Ren et\
    \ al. (2016) analyze water resource use efficiency in Gansu Province, China \n\
    using an extended two-stage DEA method. They find that the water use efficiency\
    \ of the \nsocioeconomic system in that province has consistently increased over\
    \ the past 10 years (from \n2004-2013).  Despite great discrepancies of water\
    \ resource use efficiency in the social \nsubsystem, economic subsystem, and different\
    \ cities, the mean water resource use efficiency is \nincreasing in the province\
    \ overall. They suggest decision makers make an efficient water \nresource plan\
    \ based on the goal of improving water resource use efficiency and eliminating\
    \ \ndifferences among cities.  \nGodanakis et al. (2015) analyze horticulture\
    \ farm productivity and water use efficiency in \nEngland using a DEA method.\
    \ They used data from 66 horticultural farms based on different \nriver basin\
    \ catchments across England. They attempt to provide a benchmarking tool to access\
    \ \nwater use efficiency at a farm level and then suggest pathways to improve\
    \ farm-level water \nproductivity. Their findings indicate that farms in the sample\
    \ can reduce water requirements by \n35% on average while achieving the same level\
    \ of output. Furthermore, they reveal that 47% of \nfarms operate under an increasing\
    \ return to scale, which implies that farms need to develop \neconomies of scale\
    \ in order to achieve an input minimization situation. They note some \ninfluential\
    \ factors, such as recycling water, installing efficient irrigation technology,\
    \ and the use \nof decision support tools that can enhance water use efficiency\
    \ at the farm level, and thus \nencourage the adoption of these in farming practices.\
    \ In another context, Ntantos and Karpouzos \n(2010) conducted a study concerning\
    \ irrigation performance evaluation on the Thessaloniki \nPlain, Greece using\
    \ a DEA approach under a linear programming framework. Estimated results \nindicate\
    \ that the average technical efficiency of the irrigation systems in the study\
    \ area is around \n70%, which indicates that, on average, improved irrigation\
    \ systems could reduce inputs use by \n87 \n \n30% while achieving the same level\
    \ of output. They reveal that the efficiency of some irrigation \nsystems was\
    \ substantially low and point out the appropriate action to be taken in order\
    \ to \nimprove irrigation efficiency. Concerning policy recommendations, they\
    \ suggest policy makers \nimplement policies to modernize the existing irrigation\
    \ system, while enhancing operational and \nmanagerial aspects of the irrigation\
    \ system.    \nAli and Klein (2014) estimate the water use efficiency and productivity\
    \ of irrigation \ndistricts in Southern Alberta, Canada, using both the input-oriented\
    \ and the output-oriented DEA \nmethod. They use time series data obtained from\
    \ 12 irrigation districts in Alberta from the period \nof 2008-2012 to evaluate\
    \ irrigation efficiency. The estimated results from the input-oriented \nmodel\
    \ indicate that the average technical efficiency of the irrigation districts is\
    \ 84.3; output-\noriented results show that irrigation districts can expand their\
    \ total irrigated areas by 58.3% at the \ncurrent level of input use. Additionally,\
    \ they reveal that the year-to-year total factor productivity \nfor the average\
    \ irrigation district is 0.98, with net water diverted, center pivot irrigation\
    \ \ntechnology, and precipitation identified as the major contributing factors\
    \ to the total factor of \nproductivity. The findings provide useful information\
    \ to policymakers, irrigators, and water \nmanagers to formulate targeted policy\
    \ measures to improve irrigation efficiency in the water \ndistricts. However,\
    \ the study suffers from some limitations, such as lack of net amount of water\
    \ \nuse data, and primarily it focuses on irrigation districts rather than farm\
    \ level efficiency. Farm-\nlevel analysis with more accurate data would shed light\
    \ on improving irrigation efficiency at the \nfarm level of operation.       \
    \ \nThe DEA method is widely used to evaluate efficiency in firms other than agricultural\
    \ \nsectors, such as financial sectors, tourism, educational institutions, production,\
    \ and many more. \nFor example, Liu et al. (2017) use the DEA-Tobit method to\
    \ estimate the tourism eco-efficiency \n88 \n \nof 53 Chinese coastal cities,\
    \ and they evaluate the overall efficiency level, regional differences, \neco-efficiency\
    \ types, and influencing factors. Their findings indicate the overall eco-efficiency\
    \ \nscore to be 0.86, and this implies that there is still space for further improvement\
    \ in efficiency \nlevel because only a few cities are significantly efficient.\
    \ They also note that the substantial \ndifferences in regional efficiency and\
    \ the negative impact of tourism development (for example, \nthe number of tourists,\
    \ pollutants) on the environment. However, the economic and ecological \nindicators\
    \ have significant positive influences on tourism eco-efficiency. In another context,\
    \ the \nDEA method is used to evaluate the efficiency of the textile industry.\
    \ For example, Goyal et al. \n(2017) estimate overall technical efficiency, pure\
    \ technical efficiency, and scale efficiency using \nthe DEA method looking at\
    \ samples from 101 textile firms across India. Empirical results \nindicate that\
    \ the technical inefficiency of Indian textile firms is about 16.44%, and out\
    \ of this \n11.79% is attributed to managerial inefficiency rather than an inappropriate\
    \ choice of scale. They \nsuggest that relevant policy implementation to correct\
    \ managerial inefficiency in the process of \nresource utilization would be beneficial\
    \ to efficiency enhancement.   \nThe aforementioned studies indicate that the\
    \ degree of irrigation water use efficiency and \nTE vary by region, water availability,\
    \ types of irrigation and production technology used, land \ncharacteristics,\
    \ operational management, and producers’ characteristics. Most of the studies\
    \ have \nemployed the SFA and DEA approach to estimate efficiency. While reviewing\
    \ relevant literature \non irrigation and production efficiency analysis, we note\
    \ that there is a very limited number of \nstudies that have focused on U.S. irrigation\
    \ efficiency from an economic perspective. Most of the \nstudies with U.S. focus\
    \ are either from an agronomic or engineering perspective. In the case of \nLouisiana,\
    \ this study would be new due to the fact that it uses first-hand farm-level survey\
    \ data \nand estimates irrigation and production efficiency using the latest available\
    \ methods. It aims to \n89 \n \nfill the gap in the literature that has not been\
    \ addressed by previous studies. The findings of this \nstudy would have great\
    \ policy implications for water conservation, production efficiency, and \nfarm\
    \ profit.      \n4.3 Method \n4.3.1 Stochastic Frontier Analysis \nThe stochastic\
    \ frontier analysis (SFA) model proposed by Aigner et al. (1977) and Meeusen et\
    \ \nal. (1977) has been widely applied by many researchers to estimate the technical\
    \ efficiency score \nin many sectors such as agriculture, finance, banking, energy\
    \ markets, business and many more. \nIn the stochastic frontier (SF) model, we\
    \ estimate a production function with an error term that \nconsists of two error\
    \ terms: one error term accounts for technical inefficiency and another error\
    \ \nterm accounts for random effect. The SFA assumes that each farm potentially\
    \ produces less than \nwhat it could produce due to some degree of inefficiency.\
    \ Based on Belotti et al. (2013), let us \nconsider a general form of the SF model,\
    \ \n\U0001D466\U0001D457 = \U0001D6FC + \U0001D465\U0001D457\n′\U0001D6FD + (\U0001D463\
    \U0001D457 − \U0001D462\U0001D457),⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡\U0001D457 = 1,2, … . , \U0001D441\
    \                                                (1) \nWhere the error term⁡(\U0001D463\
    \U0001D457 − \U0001D462\U0001D457) = \U0001D716\U0001D457, \U0001D466\U0001D457\
    \ is the output,  \U0001D465\U0001D457 is a vector of input of the \U0001D457\U0001D461\
    ℎ farm, and \n\U0001D6FD is a vector of technology parameters. The term \U0001D463\
    \U0001D457 represents a random error, which is \nconsidered to be independently\
    \ and identically distributed (iid) and is independent of⁡\U0001D462\U0001D457\
    . Another \nterm  \U0001D462\U0001D457 represents measurement and specification\
    \ error, which is also assumed to be iid (that \nis,⁡\U0001D441(0, \U0001D70E\U0001D462\
    \n2 ) and it accounts for the inefficiency of the farm. In order to make the model\
    \ \nestimable, the inefficiency causing error term⁡\U0001D462\U0001D457 should\
    \ be specified correctly. For example, \nAigner et al. (1977) assumed⁡\U0001D462\
    \U0001D457 to be half-normal distribution (that is,⁡\U0001D462\U0001D457~\U0001D441\
    +(0, \U0001D70E\U0001D462\n2)), Meeusen \net al. (1977) assumed it to be exponential\
    \ distribution (that is,⁡\U0001D462\U0001D457~\U0001D700(\U0001D70E\U0001D462\
    )), and Greene (2003) \nassumed a gamma distribution. The SF estimation consists\
    \ of two steps: in the first step, we \n90 \n \nobtain the model parameters \U0001D719\
    ̂ by maximizing the log likelihood function \U0001D459(\U0001D719 = \U0001D6FC\
    , \U0001D6FD′, \U0001D70E\U0001D462\n2\U0001D70E\U0001D463\n2), \nand then in\
    \ the second step, point estimates of efficiency are obtained from the mean or\
    \ mode of \nthe conditional distribution⁡⁡\U0001D453(\U0001D462\U0001D457|\U0001D700\
    \U0001D457̂ = \U0001D466\U0001D457 − \U0001D6FĈ − \U0001D465\U0001D457\n′\U0001D6FD\
    ̂).  Technical efficiency is defined as \U0001D447\U0001D438 =\nexp⁡(−\U0001D462\
    \U0001D457) and the parameters are estimated by the maximum likelihood method.\
    \ The logarithmic \nform of equation (1) can be expressed as: \n  ln⁡(\U0001D466\
    \U0001D457) = \U0001D6FC0 + ∑\n\U0001D6FD ln(\U0001D465\U0001D457) + (\U0001D463\
    \U0001D457 − \U0001D462\U0001D457)\n\U0001D458\n\U0001D457=1\n⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡\
    \  (2) \nWhile estimating the SF model, heteroscedasticity in the error term would\
    \ be a concern. In the \noriginal half-normal model, Aigner et al. (1977) assumed\
    \ a homoscedastic error term. But the \nproblem with this assumption is that the\
    \ estimates would be biased. Kumbhakar et al. (2015) \nmentioned that ignoring\
    \ the heteroscedasticity in the random error \U0001D463\U0001D457 still gives\
    \ consistent \nestimates of the parameters \U0001D6FD except for the intercept,\
    \ but the technical efficiency is biased. \nHowever, ignoring the heteroscedasticity\
    \ of  \U0001D462\U0001D457 causes biased estimates of the frontier function’s\
    \ \nparameters as well as in the estimates of the technical efficiency. Many researchers\
    \ (Kumbhakar \net al., 2015; Caudill et al., 1995; and Hadri, 1999) have proposed\
    \ appropriate tools to take into \naccount this issue while estimating the SF\
    \ model.  Another issue that needs to be addressed in \nSFA is the case of exogenous\
    \ determinants of the inefficiency. While studying the efficiency of \nthe farm,\
    \ we are interested in finding not only the level of efficiency of a farm but\
    \ also the \nfactors causing inefficiency so that corrective action can be suggested.\
    \   \n  \nThe Stata codes proposed by Belotti et al. (2013) and Kumbhakar et al.\
    \ (2015) take into \naccount the heteroscedastic case and exogenous determinants\
    \ while estimating the SF model.  \nAlso, this study utilizes the distribution-free\
    \ estimation procedures as suggested by Kumbhakar \net al. (2015) and compares\
    \ the efficiency score with estimates obtained from different models. \n91 \n\
    \ \nAdditionally, we find out the marginal effect of the exogenous factor and\
    \ test the hypothesis \nconcerning the production technology of the farms.  \n\
    4.3.2 DEA Method \nDEA is a non-parametric approach of measuring the efficiency\
    \ of decision making units (DMUs) \nusing linear programming techniques. Initially,\
    \ Charnes et al. (1978) proposed a DEA method to \nestimate efficiency for constant\
    \ returns to scale (CRS). Later on Banker et al. (1984) introduced \nan efficiency\
    \ analysis method for variable returns to scale (VRS) that allowed one to break\
    \ down \nefficiency into technical efficiency and scale efficiency. The basic\
    \ concept of efficiency can be \nexplained with the help of Figure 4.1, which\
    \ is the representation of single input-output \nproduction for five DMUs under\
    \ CRS, VRS, and nonincreasing returns to scale (NIRS).    \n \nFigure 4.1. Concepts\
    \ of efficiency and returns to scale \nFigure source: Ji and Lee (2010) \nFrom\
    \ Figure 4.1, as explained by Ji and Lee (2010), only point C is efficient under\
    \ CRS \nproduction technology; points A, C, and E are efficient under VRS; and\
    \ point E is efficient under \ndecreasing returns to scale (DRS). Point B is inefficient\
    \ and is operating under increasing returns \n92 \n \nto scale (IRS).  Input-oriented\
    \ efficiency relative to the VRS frontier can be defined as  \n\U0001D719\U0001D435\
    ,\U0001D456\U0001D45B\U0001D45D\U0001D462\U0001D461,\U0001D449\U0001D445\U0001D446\
    \ =\n\U0001D4350\U0001D4352\n\U0001D4350\U0001D435  , relative to the CRS frontier\
    \ it is defined as  \U0001D719 =\n\U0001D4350\U0001D4351\n\U0001D4350\U0001D435\
    \  , where 1 − \U0001D719 \nindicates the proportion of input that can be reduced\
    \ while achieving the same level of output. \nAdditionally, CRS technical inefficiency\
    \ can be decomposed into scale efficiency and pure \ntechnical efficiency. For\
    \ example, \U0001D4352\U0001D435 and \U0001D4351\U0001D435 contribute to the TE\
    \ of B under VRS and CRS \ntechnology, respectively, and  \U0001D4351\U0001D435\
    2  contributes to the scale efficiency. \n \nFigure 4.2 demonstrates the basic\
    \ concept of efficiency, slacks, and references in the \nproduction process. It\
    \ represents the production frontier for two input and one output case. \nTechnically\
    \ inefficient farms operate at a point interior of the frontier and the DMU operating\
    \ at \nthat point is called efficient in terms of radial, technical and weak efficiency.\
    \ But the efficient \nfarms operate along the technology frontier line, in which\
    \ the efficiency score is 1 and slacks \nvalue would be zero as defined by Cooper\
    \ et al. (2006). \n \nFigure 4.2. CRS input-oriented DEA example \nFigure source:\
    \ Ji and Lee (2010) \n93 \n \nThe TE of G and H can be defined by the expression\
    \ \n\U0001D442\U0001D43A1\n\U0001D442\U0001D43A   and \n\U0001D442\U0001D43B1\n\
    \U0001D442\U0001D43B  respectively. Although Point \n\U0001D43A1 is Farrell efficient,\
    \ input \U0001D44B2 can be reduced further while achieving the same level of output.\
    \ \nIn this case, \U0001D436\U0001D43A1 is the input slacks for farm G. The first\
    \ stage DEA model calculates the \nefficiency residually by disregarding the slacks.\
    \ The Russell measure takes into account these \npossible slacks. \nLinear programming\
    \ can be developed as a piecewise linear frontier assuming the \neconomic production\
    \ activities, convexity, strong disposability, and constant returns to scale \n\
    (CRS). Cooper et al. (2006) have defined input-oriented CRS efficiency by applying\
    \ the \npiecewise linear frontier to the input requirement set. This makes it\
    \ easier to evaluate the \nefficiency relative to the frontier (Ji and Lee, 2010).\

    \ estimation in the above case is based on a radial measure that ignores the \n\

    \ as an output variable and per acre quantity of water \napplied during the crop\
    \ year, irrigation costs such as energy cost, labor cost, maintenance/repair \n\
    cost, and well size and regions as exogenous determinants. Summary statistics\
    \ and variable \ndefinitions are displayed in Table 4.1. From Table 4.1, on average,\
    \ the per acre water applied in \nsoybean production during a crop year is 109,000\

    \ \nis 58 bushels, and the average poly pipe and labor costs per acre is 25 dollars.\
    \ On average, \nproducers spend 2,807 dollars for repair and maintenance of their\
    \ irrigation systems during a \ncrop year (repair and maintenance cost represents\
    \ the average total dollar amount spent during a \ncrop year). Energy cost is\
    \ the major cost for irrigation as water is almost free in Louisiana. On \naverage,\
    \ farmers spend 24 dollars per acre for pumping water, and the average number\
    \ of \nsoybean irrigated acres seems to be 321. As per our sample response, this\
    \ study considers the \nwell size and location of farms as exogenous factors influencing\
    \ the efficiency of irrigation \nwater. The average well size in Louisiana seems\
    \ to be 9.5 inches. Regarding the concentration of \nsoybean irrigated farms,\
    \ 10% of the irrigated farms are located in the north and northwest region, \n\
    39% of the soybean farms are in the northeast region, 30% are in the central region,\
    \ and the \nremaining 20% are in the south region based on our survey information.\
    \ Soil characteristics, \n98 \n \nwater holding capacity, and moisture level vary\

    \U0001D438\U0001D456\n̂ = exp⁡(−\U0001D462̂\U0001D456). The estimated \nefficiency\
    \ score indicates that, on average, farmers achieve 77% of the maximum potential\
    \ \noutput in their production. Here, the maximum efficiency score index is 1,\
    \ which is true by \nconstruction. Additionally, the least efficient farmer achieved\
    \ only 47% of his maximum \nachievable output. Conversely, the average production\
    \ inefficiency is about 23%, and producers \ncan minimize their inefficiency level\
    \ by appropriate input management. In order to visualize the \nefficiency index,\
    \ a histogram plot of efficiency scores would be useful. Figure 4.3 displays the\

    \ dispersion of efficiency. In this \nvisualization, we do not have a case of\

    \ we do not have an outlier. In fact, there was an outlier, and it was \ndropped\
    \ before estimation. Sometimes very high inefficiency could possibly be due to\
    \ the \n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\nDensity\n.4\n.6\n.8\n1\neff_cols\n100 \n \npresence of\
    \ an outlier. Furthermore, we conducted a skewness test to check the validity\
    \ of the \nmodel’s stochastic frontier specification. In a production- type stochastic\
    \ frontier model, the \nresidual from the OLS estimates should skew to the left\
    \ due to the construct of error term  \U0001D463\U0001D456 −\n\U0001D462\U0001D456\
    \ , \U0001D462\U0001D456 ≥ 0,⁡ and \U0001D463\U0001D456 is symmetrically distributed\
    \ around zero. A detailed summary of statistics \nabout the residual provides\
    \ a tentative idea about the skewness of the residual. From the \nsummary statistics,\
    \ the skewness value is -0.73, which indicates that the residual from OLS is \n\
    negatively skewed. However, we need to apply a formal test for validity. Hence,\
    \ we perform a \nskewness test (H0: no skewness) proposed by D’Agostino et al.\
    \ (1990). Clearly, P-value from \nthe test statistics is around 0.01, which indicates\
    \ that that the null hypothesis is rejected. This \nmeans the error residual is\
    \ negatively skewed and consistent with the model’s specifications. \nThis justification\
    \ allows us to proceed to the next stage of estimating the stochastic frontier\
    \ \nmodel with appropriate distributional consideration.        \n   \n4.5.2 Distribution\

    \ the consideration of the heteroscedasticity case are a \nlittle bit higher than\
    \ those obtained from the general exponential model. However, technical \ninefficiency\
    \ is higher in column 2. When we compare these estimated results with OLS estimates\
    \ \nand COLS inefficiency, significant differences can be noticed. Coefficients\
    \ of water applied and \nenergy costs are significant at a 10% and 5% significance\
    \ level, respectively, in the general \nexponential model. However, the estimated\
    \ coefficients of water, energy cost, and the exogenous \ndeterminant variable\
    \ “well size” are significant at a 1% significance level. The average \ninefficiency\
    \ score in the general exponential model is 17.7%. It is generally assumed that\
    \ farms \nare operating and producing using a constant return to scale technology,\
    \ but the size of the wells \ndiffer in each farm and the water pumping rate causes\
    \ a variation. Assuming the variation in well \nsize might introduce heteroscedasticity\
    \ into the idiosyncratic error term, we estimate the \n102 \n \nexponential model\
    \ using well size as an independent variable in the variance function for the\
    \ \nidiosyncratic error. The coefficient of well size is highly significant, and\
    \ output indicates that the \nvariance of the idiosyncratic error term is a function\
    \ of well size. The average inefficiency score \nin this case is 18.2%, slightly\
    \ higher than the general exponential model.  \nAdditionally, we perform a test\
    \ of the hypothesis that the farms use a constant return to \nscale technology.\
    \ We reject the null hypothesis that the farms use constant return to scale \n\
    technology, as chi-square values are 510 with a probability of 0.00 in the general\
    \ exponential \nmodel and 438 with p-values 0.00, respectively. This finding is\
    \ consistent with the OLS method. \nAs we find that the level of irrigation inefficiency\
    \ is around 17%, we are unable to address the \nfactors that can explain inefficiency.\
    \ In order to address this issue possible exogenous \ndeterminants need to be\
    \ identified. In this study, we used well size and region as potential \nexogenous\
    \ factors causing irrigation inefficiency. We estimate a stochastic frontier model\

    \ well size and region as exogenous \ndeterminants for irrigation efficiency.\
    \ The impact of well size on crop yield is very small. \nSoybean yield may vary\
    \ by region due to the fact that soil characteristics and moisture levels \ndiffer\
    \ by region as well. However, the main reason to estimate parameters using these\
    \ variables \nis to determine the marginal effect of these variables on irrigation\
    \ inefficiency. This indicates \nthat the marginal effect of well size is -0.0004,\
    \ which implies that on average inefficiency is \nreduced by 0.04% for a 1% increase\
    \ in well size. The marginal value is very small compared \nwith the degree of\
    \ inefficiency, but it can be inferred that a reasonable well size can minimize\
    \ the \nwater pumping cost compared to small well size. Regarding the effects\
    \ of the regional factor, the \n104 \n \ndegree of impact is higher than that\
    \ of well size. On average the regional factor can reduce \ninefficiency by 3.7%\
    \ compared to the southern region. That could possibly be because of \ndifferences\
    \ in moisture level and soil quality in those regions. From the model estimation\
    \ results, \nthis level of inefficiency has not been fully explained by these\
    \ variables.    \nComparative efficiency and inefficiency scores using different\
    \ models are presented in \nTable 4.5. With the inclusion of regional factors,\
    \ the estimated average inefficiency is found to \nbe 12.9%. This level of inefficiency\
    \ can be reduced by appropriate irrigation scheduling and \nadopting efficient\
    \ irrigation technology along with irrigation practices such as surge valves,\

    \ 4.6, we can see that the input based radial measure of technical efficiency\
    \ is 83.5% \nunder VRS and 79.5% under NIRS. However, the non-radial measure of\
    \ TE under VRS and \nNIRS are 62.2% and 59%, respectively. Here, the average TE\
    \ score of 83.5% indicated that the \nfarmers could improve the overall performance\
    \ of irrigation by reducing by around 14% the \nirrigation input on average while\
    \ achieving the same level of output. Some of the farms are \nperforming well,\
    \ but many farms are performing well below the average TE. These farms have a\
    \ \nhuge potential to reduce irrigation inefficiency by minimizing input without\
    \ affecting the current \noutput level adversely. Similarly, an output-based radial\
    \ measure of TE under VRS and NIRS are \n1.125 and 1.147, and a non-radial TE\
    \ under VRS and NIRS are 1.125 and 1.141, respectively. \nHere, the average value\
    \ of the radial and non-radial TE score seems to be almost the same, and it \n\
    can be interpreted that the farms can improve their efficiency or reduce inefficiency\
    \ \nproportionately by augmenting output. The average efficiency score of 1.125\
    \ implies that a farm \ncan improve efficiency by augmenting outputs by 12.5%.\
    \ In the output-based model, farms with \nan efficiency score higher than 1 are\
    \ inefficient and they can improve their performance by \nincreasing output/yield\
    \ without altering the input. In order to compare TE scores obtained by \nusing\
    \ radial and non-radial measures assuming three different production technologies\
    \ (CRS, \nVRS, and NIRS), a summary statistics of efficiency scores is presented\
    \ in Table 4.7. The output-\n106 \n \nbased radial and non-radial TE scores are\

    \ 66 are scale inefficient, 3 farms (DMU: 1007, 1056, and 1073) exhibit scale\
    \ \ninefficiency due to decreasing returns to scale, while one farm(DMU 1051)\
    \ exhibits scale \ninefficiency due to increasing returns to scale. In the input-base\
    \ model, all farms seem to be scale \nefficient.  \n \nThe estimated technical\
    \ efficiency scores for soybean irrigation using both parametric \nand non-parametric\
    \ methods seem to be almost the same. However, the TE score obtained from \nthe\
    \ SFA with heteroscedasticity and exogenous determinant consideration is higher\
    \ than that \nobtained from a general SFA estimation. The average TE score of\
    \ around 12% obtained from the \nSFA method indicates that a significant amount\
    \ of inefficiency needs to be minimized. As we \nhave seen, regional factors can\
    \ explain around 3.7% of inefficiency, but this study is unable to \ndetect other\
    \ possible factors causing inefficiency. There could be some managerial issues\
    \ that \nmight be contributing to the inefficiency. More importantly, the majority\
    \ of the farmers are using \ninefficient furrow irrigation without adopting irrigation\
    \ management practices. Farmers need to \n108 \n \nbe encouraged to adopt surge\
    \ valves, moisture sensors, a flow meters, and computerized \nscheduling if possible\
    \ in order to achieve a higher irrigation efficiency. Technically, the model \n\
    specification is correct based on the different test statistics. However, due\
    \ to the limited \ninformation on sample size, temperature, rainfall, soil characteristics,\
    \ and managerial \ninformation, the estimated results cannot be as good as they\
    \ might be in a perfect information \nscenario. With the limited information,\
    \ this is the best possible estimate we could obtain. \nRegardless of data limitation,\
    \ the SFA model specification is accurate and gives a reasonable \nestimate of\
    \ irrigation efficiency scores. Likewise, as in most of the empirical work, the\
    \ main \nlimitations of DEA measurement arises from the failure of the assumptions.\
    \ In any empirical \nwork, random noise, measurement error, or outliers are common\
    \ problems that need to be \naddressed properly for robust estimates. In this\
    \ study, potential outliers have been corrected \nproperly. However, other possible\
    \ issues are not taken into account, especially in the DEA \nmethod, as this method\
    \ does not impose distributional restrictions. For a more accurate irrigation\
    \ \nefficiency score, additional information, such as rainfall, temperature, soil\
    \ characteristics, \nmanagement information, and well characteristics should be\
    \ incorporated. Furthermore, the \nsample size should be increased.    \n4.6 Concluding\
    \ Remarks \nImproving irrigation use efficiency and crop yield are two significant\
    \ challenges in the \nagricultural sector. Irrigation use efficiency is directly\
    \ related to farm profitability, soil health, \nwater quality, water conservation,\
    \ and sustainable farmland use. According to the USDA report \nreleased in 2017,\
    \ around 70% of the total croplands were irrigated in Louisiana using \ngroundwater\
    \ and surface water sources. The furrow/flood irrigation system is the most \n\
    commonly used irrigation method in the state. Irrigation efficiency is relatively\
    \ lower in the \n109 \n \nfurrow irrigation system compared to the center pivot\
    \ and drip irrigation systems. The \nImplementation of surge valves, flow meters,\
    \ and soil moisture sensors in the furrow irrigation \nsystem can help to conserve\
    \ water use significantly. However, findings from our recently \ncompleted survey\
    \ of farmers indicate that more than 50% of the respondents have adopted a \n\
    furrow irrigation system without implementing these technologies. Groundwater\
    \ withdrawal for \nirrigation has increased in the state by 780% since 1960. A\
    \ single aquifer in the northeastern part \nof the state, the Mississippi River\
    \ Alluvial Aquifer, has about 160 Mgal of water extracted every \nday. If this\
    \ trend continues, the overexploitation of groundwater increases the risk of water\
    \ table \ndecline, thereby causing the water pumping cost to rise and profits\
    \ to decline for farmers. \nGroundwater level decline can also increase the risk\
    \ of saltwater intrusion into the aquifer. \nIdentification of farms based on\
    \ irrigation efficiency helps to identify characteristics that are \nconducive\
    \ to water saving. Farmers can use sustainable water management tools to reduce\
    \ the \npotential risk associated with groundwater quality and quantity decline.\
    \ However, they need to \nknow the profit maximizing and most efficient level\
    \ of irrigation water application before \nimplementing these management tools.\
    \ Below the optimal irrigation amount results in a low crop \nyield, whereas irrigating\
    \ above the optimal irrigation amount results in environmental pollution, \nadditional\
    \ water pumping cost, rising energy use for pumping, and increased susceptibility\
    \ to \nplant diseases. Efficiency analysis provides valuable insights to minimize\
    \ farm operation costs, \nleading to optimal profit and better environmental quality.\
    \ In the evaluation of sustainable \nfarming, production efficiency and irrigation\
    \ water use productivity needs to be incorporated. \nFarmers may seek to maximize\
    \ production and profit per unit of water, known as financial \nsustainability,\
    \ while the environmentally sustainable system aims to minimize the use of water\
    \ \nvolume of production. These two contrasting approaches of financial and social\
    \ sustainability, \n110 \n \ncombined with the need for efficiency regarding agricultural\
    \ productivity and resource \nconservation, require a management approach that\
    \ simultaneously takes into consideration \nsustainability, agricultural productivity,\
    \ and net profit. In order to achieve such sustainable \nproduction, evaluation\
    \ of irrigation efficiency provides a benchmarking tool to access water \nefficiency\
    \ at the farm level and provides valuable information to improve farm productivity\
    \ by \nidentifying factors associated with water use inefficiency.  \nThe primary\
    \ aim of this study is to estimate the technical efficiency of irrigation water\
    \ \nuse in soybean production using both parametric and non-parametric estimation\
    \ methods. The \nsecondary objective is to identify factors causing inefficiency\
    \ in the production process and to \nsuggest appropriate policy tools for corrective\
    \ measures. Irrigation efficiency information would \nallow producers to re-evaluate\
    \ their irrigation scheduling to achieve higher water application \nefficiency.\
    \ For this study, we conducted a farm level survey to assess information regarding\
    \ \nirrigation cost, the volume of water application during the crop year 2016,\
    \ and crop yield per \nacre, along with other sociodemographic and farm characteristics.\
    \ We use both an input and an \noutput-based data envelopment approach (DEA) as\
    \ a non-parametric method to estimate \nirrigation efficiency. The commonly used\
    \ DEA method is based on the radial measures, which \nignores the possibility\
    \ of slack that may occur in the constraints. To address that problem, we use\
    \ \nsmoothed heterogeneous bootstrapping procedures in conventional DEA and supplement\
    \ it with \na non-radial measure of efficiency known as the Russell measure. Bootstrap\
    \ enables us to obtain \nstatistical inferences and test the hypothesis concerning\
    \ technology dependency.  Regarding \nparametric estimation, we employ a stochastic\
    \ frontier analysis approach that corrects for a \nheteroscedasticity problem.\
    \ Additionally, we identify the exogenous factors causing irrigation \ninefficiency\
    \ and estimate the marginal effect of those factors. Also, this study utilizes\
    \ the \n111 \n \ndistribution-free estimation procedures known as corrected ordinary\
    \ least square method to \nestimate the efficiency and compare the efficiency\
    \ score with estimates obtained from different \nmethods. Our results indicate\
    \ that the average irrigation inefficiency among soybean farmers in \nLouisiana\
    \ is about 12%. The findings of this study should provide a benchmarking tool\
    \ to \nformulate an appropriate irrigation policy that enhances water conservation.\

    \ ACCEPT VALUE \nFOR IRRIGATION WATER IN LOUISIANA \n \n \n5.1 Introduction \n\
    A recent survey conducted by the United States Department of Agriculture19 shows\
    \ that the \nlargest decrease in irrigated acres occurred in western states, including\
    \ Texas. At the same \nperiod, states like Louisiana and Kansas saw a significant\
    \ increase in irrigation acreage. This is a \nclear indication of a significant\
    \ shift of water withdrawal from western states to other parts of the \nUnited\
    \ States. On the one hand, water scarcity has been worsening in the western high\
    \ planes, \nand on the other hand, coastal states might face a saltwater intrusion\
    \ problem in the aquifer due \nto water table imbalances caused by the over-exploitation\
    \ of groundwater to meet high irrigation \nwater demand. In this context, irrigation\
    \ water management could be a crucial issue in the region \nin the near future.\
    \ In order to tackle the water resource management problem, irrigation water \n\
    trading among farmers within the aquifer system may be a desirable alternative.\
    \ For this purpose, \nfarmers’ perceptions regarding water trading could be important\
    \ feedback for policy purposes in \na water resource management case. This study\
    \ aims to determine the perception of water trading \nissues among farmers and\
    \ their willingness to pay/willingness to accept values for irrigation \nwater\
    \ during critical crop growing periods. \n Irrigated farms account for roughly\
    \ 40 percent of the value of U.S. agricultural \nproduction nationwide. The average\
    \ value of production for an irrigated farm was more than \nthree times the average\
    \ value for a dryland farm in 2007, and irrigating is an increasing trend as \n\
    indicated by Schaible & Aillery (2012). If the establishment of a water trading\
    \ market is viable \nand farmers are willing to adopt it, shares of irrigated\
    \ land will be increased and the productivity \n                             \
    \                              \n19  United States Department of Agriculture,\

    \  \n116 \n \nof land will go up significantly, resulting in higher profits. For\
    \ example, Debaere and Li (2016) \ndemonstrate the impact of water markets on\
    \ production using a first difference-in-difference \nanalysis in counties with\
    \ data from 1954 to 2012 in the Rio Grande basin. They find evidence \nthat water\
    \ markets facilitate a shift from more water intensive to less water intensive,\
    \ or crops \nthat are less productive to more productive in terms of dollars generated\
    \ per unit of water. They \nsupport water markets as a tool to manage water more\
    \ effectively.  \nMany states and countries with water shortage issues have instituted\
    \ water trading \nprograms. Water cost varies by region and country according\
    \ to water availability, geographical \nlocation, land quality, and demand. We\
    \ reviewed some relevant literature on a willingness to pay \nfor water focusing\
    \ on trends, estimation processes, and major findings. In this nexus, Wichelns\
    \ \n(2010)20 explains that farmers in the U.S., especially in the western states,\
    \ purchasing water in \nmarket transactions to finish an irrigation season or\
    \ to ensure a water supply for perennial crops, \nmight pay prices that exceed\
    \ 100 dollars per 1,000 m3 for a portion of their irrigation supply. \nCompared\
    \ to this, the Southeastern states have a very low water price. For example, the\
    \ \nestimated average WTP value for surface water supplied by an irrigation district\
    \ in Arkansas, \nU.S. has been found to be $33.21 per acre-foot (Knapp et al.,\
    \ 2018). Additionally, Knapp et al. \n(2018) find that a significant proportion\
    \ of producers are likely to have higher WTPs for surface \nwater than the average\
    \ pumping cost in the study area. Producers located in areas with less \ngroundwater\
    \ resources have higher WTPs compared to farmers located in areas with abundant\
    \ \ngroundwater, and producers who are more concerned with water shortages in\
    \ the future have \nhigher WTPs. The findings of this study would be relevant\
    \ in our context as this issue has not \n                                    \
    \                       \n20 Sustainable Management of Water Resources in Agriculture\
    \ \n(https://www.oecd.org/unitedstates/45016437.pdf) \n117 \n \nbeen studied in\
    \ the Louisiana. Furthermore, Arkansas and Louisiana share some common aquifer\
    \ \nsystems, such as the Mississippi River Valley alluvial aquifer and the Sparta\
    \ aquifer, and the \nirrigation water management practices are similar to some\
    \ extent in these states. Water scarcity \nin this region is not as dire as in\
    \ the western states of the U.S., such as California, New Mexico, \nand Arizona.\
    \ However, many reports indicate deteriorating water quality and quantity may\
    \ \nimpose higher production costs because of both rising energy costs and declining\
    \ water levels. \nThis demands a higher investment in irrigation technology to\
    \ replace inefficient irrigation \nsystems with more efficient systems. In a worst\
    \ case scenario, let us assume the water crisis \npersists in some of the regions\
    \ in the nation and farmers give up farming; production loss can be \ncompensated\
    \ for a certain duration. In this scenario, the United States can probably afford\
    \ to lose \nsome of its farmland.21 But if left unchecked, this could begin to\
    \ threaten the food supply. A \nprojection reported by the United Nations’ Food\
    \ and Agricultural organization indicates that \nfood production globally will\
    \ have to increase by 70% by 2050 to meet the demand of the \ngrowing population\
    \ in the world. Irrigation water trading markets would minimize farmland loss\
    \ \ncaused by the water crisis.     \nHensher et al. (2006) estimate the WTP value\
    \ to avoid drought water restrictions using a \nstated choice experiment for household\
    \ and business sectors in Canberra, Australia. Results show \ncustomers unwilling\
    \ to pay to avoid low-level restrictions at all or to avoid higher levels of \n\
    restrictions that are not in place every day. In most cases, farmers intend to\
    \ pay for irrigation \nwater in order to mitigate the risk of drought. In addition\
    \ to this, farmers are willing to pay for \nirrigated agricultural services that\
    \ provide drought mitigation, preserve water quality, the \n                 \

    \ rural landscapes, as evidenced by Vivithkeyoonvong and Jourdain (2017) in \n\
    Northeast Thailand. Estimated results based on a choice experiment approach indicate\
    \ that a \nsociety’s demand for the nonmarket services of irrigated agriculture,\
    \ especially drought \nmitigation, water quality, and rural landscapes, is significant.\
    \ The implication of this finding \nindicates the importance of agricultural policy\
    \ capable of balancing these different services. \nBozorg-Haddad et al. (2016)\
    \ estimate the farmers’ WTP value for irrigation water during a water \nshortage\
    \ period using a probabilistic optimization method in Iran. Estimated results\
    \ show that \nfarmers tend to employ efficient irrigation technology to minimize\
    \ water cost when there is a \nwater shortage, but a low water price does not\
    \ have any effect on water use when there is no \nwater shortage. Furthermore,\
    \ they find that the WTP values for irrigation water among the \nfarmers vary\
    \ greatly depending on the distribution of water, type of irrigation system in\
    \ use, soil \ncharacteristics, water price, and crop type.  \nSome regions of\
    \ the world are facing a water resource problem similar to the U.S., more \nprecisely\
    \ similar to Louisiana, and implementing comprehensive water management provisions\
    \ \nto ensure the socio-economic and environmental sustainability of those regions\
    \ is important. For \nexample, the region of Murcia in southern Spain has been\
    \ facing a structural water deficit caused \nby the mismanagement of water use\
    \ rights, the overexploitation of aquifers to meet the \nincreasing demand for\
    \ water, and the imbalance between demand and resources. In this nexus, \nRupérez-Moreno\
    \ et al. (2017) evaluate the cost of the overexploited aquifer in the region using\
    \ a \nhydro-economic model. The results show that the price paid by farmers for\
    \ irrigation water in the \nyear 2027 would be 0.53 euro per cubic meter. The\
    \ aggregate payment would be equivalent to \n10% of the final agricultural crop\
    \ production in the region of Murcia. In regions where water \nscarcity is severe,\
    \ farm producers tend to pay a higher amount for irrigation water. For example,\
    \ \n119 \n \nChandrasekaran et al. (2009) reveal that farmers are willing to pay\
    \ IRS 218.5/ha/year (exchange \nrate $1=70.5 IRS) in Tamil Nadu, India, where\
    \ per capita water resources available are 600 m3, \nwhich is quite small compared\
    \ to the 4,000 m3 that is the national average. This WTP value for \nthe region\
    \ is significantly high as compared to the marginal productivity of water: INR\
    \ 243.07 in \nthe dry season and INR 236.94 in the wet season.  \nAydogdu (2016)\
    \ evaluates the WTP for irrigation water and explores the potential factors \n\
    that affect it using farm-level survey data in Turkey. The estimated results arrived\
    \ at by using \ncontingent valuation and double bound maximum likelihood methods\
    \ show that farmers are \nwilling to pay 71.7% more than the existing price under\
    \ certain conditions. Aydogdu further \nnotices that factors such as the price\
    \ of irrigation water, education of farmers, irrigation \ntechnology in use, location,\
    \ and attitude towards associations are influential in explaining WTPs. \nIn the\
    \ same line of study, Aydogdu and Bilgic (2016) evaluate farmers’ WTP value for\
    \ efficient \nirrigation and improved water productivity in the GAP-Harran Plain,\
    \ Turkey using a large \nsample of farm-level data. Estimated results using a\
    \ Tobit model indicate that the average WTP \nvalue for irrigation water is 133.7\
    \ dollars per hectare. Being a primary school graduate, having \naccess to modern\
    \ irrigation technologies, and crop patterns increase the WTP values by 4.4%,\
    \ \n4.3%, and 3.8% respectively. However, property owners, married farmers, gravity\
    \ irrigation \nusers, and perceptions about natural resources tend to lower the\
    \ WTP values by 3.3%, 9.3%, \n13.7%, and 0.9% respectively. They recommend policymakers\
    \ formulate an efficient irrigation \nmanagement policy in a way that is capable\
    \ of promoting trust in the water users association, \nstrengthening extension\
    \ services, and intensifying training programs and public awareness about \nthe\
    \ sustainable use of water. \n           \n120 \n \n \nHorowitz and McConnell\
    \ (2002) review a wide range of studies concerning the disparity \nbetween willingness\
    \ to pay and willingness to accept values for different goods. They find that\
    \ \nthe less the good is like an “ordinary market good,” the higher is the ratio\
    \ of WTA/WTP. The \nratio is highest for non-market goods, next highest for ordinary\
    \ private goods, and the lowest for \nexperiments involving forms of money. An\
    \ evaluation of disparity between WTA and WTP of \nirrigation water would be interesting\
    \ in our context in the sense that we can see how Louisiana \nfarmers rank water\
    \ resources in this ranking. Hanemann (1991) evaluates the disparity between \n\
    WTA and WTP and indicates that the divergence between these two may be indicative\
    \ not of \nsome failure in the survey methodology but could be some form of cognitive\
    \ mistake of the \nindividuals surveyed. Additionally, he mentions the degree\
    \ of substitutability between goods \nmay drive differences between these two.\
    \ In this line, Shogren et al. (1994) find converging \nWTA and WTP values for\
    \ close substitute market goods, but in contrast, for a nonmarket good \nwith\
    \ no close substitutes, the value measure diverges and persists. \n \nThe main\
    \ objective of this study is to determine the perception about the water trading\
    \ \nissue during critical crops’ growing periods among farmers, determine their\
    \ WTP/WTA values \nfor irrigation water, and evaluate the reasons for the disparities\
    \ between WTP and WTA values. \nSince this issue is new, it has not been studied\
    \ previously in the context of Louisiana. This study \nis based on self-surveyed\
    \ farm level data that could provide valuable information that might be \nuseful\
    \ in policy formulation concerning efficient water management during the water\
    \ crisis \nperiods in the future. The findings of this study provide valuable\
    \ information regarding irrigation \nwater trading issues among farmers within\
    \ an aquifer in Louisiana and provide tentative ideas \nabout the monetary value\
    \ of water to those farmers. Additionally, irrigation water trading \n121 \n \n\
    provisions would be beneficial for farmers in terms of greater productivity and\
    \ sustainable water \nresource allocation if the creation of a water trading market\
    \ is feasible and desired by farmers.  \nThe remainder of this essay is organized\
    \ as follows.  Section 2 provides the empirical \nmodel specification to estimate\
    \ WTP/WTA values and the reasons for disparity between these \ntwo values. Section\
    \ 3 contains a brief explanation about the survey design and data description;\
    \ \nand Section 4 presents estimated results, discussion, and policy implications.\
    \ Finally, Section 5 \nprovides concluding remarks, limitations of the study,\
    \ and future work.  \n5.2 Method \nWe adopt a well-known discrete choice model\
    \ to estimate the impact of explanatory \nvariables on WTP for irrigation water.\
    \ A logit model is derived from the random utility model in \nwhich each individual\
    \ has to make a choice among the alternatives. We assume that farmers \nmake rational\
    \ decisions. Farmers maximize a utility function that ranks the farmers’ preference\
    \ \namong available choices.  Farmers’ adoption decisions here are either to pay\
    \ for irrigation water \nor not to pay. These adoption decisions are affected\
    \ by a number of factors, such as the size of \nland holdings, sociodemographic\
    \ information, and a risk factor. Factors affecting WTP for \nirrigation water\
    \ can be represented by the following functional form:   \n( , , , )\n1/0)\n(\n\
    f Y L E R\nP WTP\n\n\n \nHere, WTP is the willingness to pay for irrigation\
    \ water (yes=1, no=0), Y is the vector of gross \nfarm revenue, L is the vector\
    \ of size of the land holding, E is the vector of educational \nattainment and\
    \ age of farmers, and R is the risk factor. \nRepresenting all explanatory variables\
    \ by X vector, the econometric model can be \nwritten in the following form as\
    \ explained by Greene (2003): \n                  \n  \n\n\nX i\nP WTP\n\

    \                     (1) \n122 \n \nHere,  is a vector of regression coefficient\
    \ and   is the error term distributed logistically in \nlogit framework. The\
    \ odds ratio is expressed as: \n                 \ni\ni\nP\nP\nOdds\n 1\n  \

    \         (2) \nEquation (2) is the ratio of favorable to unfavorable cases. Finally,\

    \        (4) \nThe estimated parameter  in equation (1) represents the change\
    \ in the logit of the \nprobability associated with the unit change in the Xi\
    \ explanatory variable, holding other things \nconstant. In the logit model, odds\
    \ ratios or marginal effects are easier to interpret. Thus, we \nestimate odds\
    \ ratios using equation (4). In the estimation of WTP/WTA, the reliability of\
    \ the \nestimated value is a major concern. Some studies (Lusk, 2003; Morrison\
    \ and Brown, 2009; \nTonsor and Shupp, 2011) have used certainty corrected values\
    \ to estimate more accurate \nWTP/WTA values. Due to the sample size, estimating\
    \ certainty corrected models seem to be \ndifficult in this study.  \n5.3 Survey\
    \ and Data Description \nThis study uses farm-level surveyed data from Louisiana\
    \ soybean producers for the crop year \n2015-2016. For this study, we use willingness\
    \ to pay value for soybean irrigation, willingness to \naccept values for not\
    \ irrigating, sociodemographic information, irrigation costs and land holdings\
    \ \ninformation. In order to avoid frequent repetition, only the definition of\
    \ the variables are \n123 \n \npresented (a detailed explanation of all variables\
    \ is presented in Chapter 2). The description of \nthe variables definition are\
    \ displayed in Table 5.1.  \n.   Table 5.1. Variables description \nVariables\

    \ for corn, cotton, and rice are 11.09, 9.09, and 11.37 dollars per acre \nrespectively.\
    \ Regarding the average WTA value for not irrigating the existing farm is 143.8\
    \ \ndollars per acre. This value is substantially higher than the one reported\
    \ in the WTP/WTA \nliterature.  \n5.4 Results and Discussion \nDue to the limitation\
    \ of sample size, rigorous estimation could not work. A logit model is used to\

    \ (*** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1) \nThe estimated results indicate that farmers\
    \ with higher gross farm revenue are less likely \nto involve themselves in water\
    \ trading. Farmers with a higher age are less likely to participate in \nwater\
    \ trading. Additionally, farmers who have more rented land are less willing to\
    \ participate in \nwater trading. At the same time, farmers with more owned land\
    \ are more likely to pay for \nirrigation water. Regarding the odds ratio of 0.401\
    \ for college education, this indicates that a \nfarmer with a college degree\
    \ has 60% lower odds than a farmer with a professional degree for \nwillingness\
    \ to participate in water trading.   \nThe odds ratio would change by 0.0001 for\
    \ every unit (age group) change in age, holding \nother things constant. The older\
    \ people have almost 99 percent lower odds of participating in \n125 \n \nwater\
    \ trading. In the case of land ownership, if the land is owned, the predicted\
    \ odds ratio would \nchange by 1.014 for every acre increase in owned land, holding\
    \ other factors constant. If the \nland is rented, the predicted odds ratio would\
    \ change by 0.998 for an acre increase in rented \nland. The likelihood of paying\
    \ for irrigation water decreases by 0.2 percent in the case of rented \nland.\
    \ The odds of willingness to pay increase by 2.50 times those of the odds for\
    \ farmers \nwithout risk factors. Regarding farm revenue, the odds ratio would\
    \ change by 0.248 for every \n1000 dollar increase in gross farm revenue. This\
    \ indicates that the farmers with higher farm \nrevenue have about 75 percent\
    \ lower odds of willingness to pay for irrigation water.  \nThe average values\
    \ of WTP for irrigation water significantly vary by the level of \ncertainty scale.\
    \ In order to assess more accurately WTP/WTA values, we asked farmers to state\
    \ \ntheir level of certainty on a 1 to 10 scale so as to specify how certain they\
    \ are of stated \nWTA/WTA values. In the certainty scale, 1 represents very unsure\
    \ and 10 represents very sure \nto pay the stated dollar amount per acre of irrigation\
    \ water. Table 5.3 depicts the average WTP \nvalues for each crop and the number\
    \ of farmers willing to pay for irrigation water under the \ndifferent certainty\
    \ scales. From Table 5.3, we can see that the average willingness to pay value\
    \ \nfor corn irrigation is 11.5 dollars per acre per year. Only 8 percent of the\
    \ total respondents \n(N=119) are very certain of their willingness to pay for\
    \ irrigation water for irrigating corn. For \nsoybeans, around 9 percent of the\
    \ total respondents are very sure of their willingness to pay for \nirrigation\
    \ water and the average WTP value with 100% certainty is 10 dollars per acre per\
    \ year. \nSimilarly, average WTP values with 100% certainty for cotton and rice\
    \ are 11.88 and 12.22 \ndollars respectively. These values are almost close to\
    \ the average values obtained without \nconsidering certainty correction. The\
    \ average WTP values for each crop (corn, soybean, cotton, \nand rice) under different\
    \ certainty scales are presented in Table 5.3. \n126 \n \n  Table 5.3. Average\

    \ From Table 5.5, all the \nvariables except the rental status are significant\
    \ at a 10% significance level (farm revenue is \nsignificant at a 1% significance\
    \ level). Per unit increase in owned land tends to increase the ratio \nof WTA/WTP\
    \ by a very small amount. The degree of impact is very small and indicates that\
    \ the \nexpected ratio of these two factors tends to converge. The impact of farm\
    \ revenue is significantly \n128 \n \nhigh with a negative sign. In this case\
    \ the impact is diverging (moving in opposite directions). \nFarmers receiving\
    \ more farm revenue tend to pay more for irrigation water. A significant \npositive\
    \ impact is the indication of less willingness to pay value for irrigation water.\
    \ It seems like \nthe income effect is stronger than the endowment effect for\
    \ disparity (in the sense of divergence).     \nIndeed, the main goal of this\
    \ study was to estimate more reliable WTP values for \nirrigation water by estimating\
    \ at least six more equations incorporating certainty scale and \ncomparing the\
    \ baseline estimates with the certainty corrected estimates. However, due to the\
    \ \nsample size restriction, intended estimation could not work. In the future,\
    \ this study will be \nextended with full information. \n5.5 Concluding remarks\
    \ \nMany states in the U.S. and abroad, such as Australia, Chile, and some of\
    \ the countries in Europe \nand Asia where they are facing a water crisis, have\
    \ been practicing a water trading system. For \nfuture water crisis management,\
    \ water trading among farmers might be an alternative option in \nLouisiana as\
    \ well. We reviewed some relevant literature on water trading and noted that the\
    \ \nirrigation water cost varies by region and country, where water availability,\
    \ geographical \nlocation, land quality, and demand trends are the major determinants\
    \ of water price. In order to \nidentify the perception of Louisiana farmers of\
    \ irrigation water trading, we conducted a farm \nlevel survey and accessed some\
    \ valuable information.    \nEstimated results using a logit model indicate that\
    \ farmers with higher gross farm \nrevenue, higher age, and more rented land are\
    \ less likely to be involved in water trading in \nLouisiana. However, farmers\
    \ with more owned land are more likely to participate in irrigation \nwater trading.\
    \ Regarding the impact of education, a farmer with some college has 60% lower\
    \ \nodds than a farmer with a professional or graduate degree of participating\
    \ in water trading. Due \n129 \n \nto the limited sample size, the certainty scale\
    \ corrected model could not be run. In the future, \nthis study will be elaborated\
    \ upon with adequate information. \n5.6 References \nAydogdu, M. H., & Bilgic,\

    \ THE STUDY, AND FUTURE WORK \nIrrigation water is the most critical resource\
    \ for the agricultural production process globally. \nIrrigation water management\
    \ mainly aims to minimize the volume of water applied and irrigation \nfrequency\
    \ while maintaining water requirements for crops while conserving water resources.\
    \ \nAlthough Louisiana is rich in water resources, competition for water among\
    \ agricultural sectors \nand for domestic and industrial use is increasing. In\
    \ such cases, irrigation water management \nmight be a critical issue in this\
    \ region. For this reason, we conducted a state-level farm survey to \ncollect\
    \ information regarding irrigation practices and concerns from Louisiana farmers\
    \ during \nthe crop year 2015 and 2016 in order to analyze irrigation technology\
    \ adoption, irrigation \nefficiency, and to evaluate WTP/WTA values for irrigation\
    \ water during the critical crop \ngrowing period. \nThis study analyzes three\
    \ different issues associated with irrigation water management in \nLouisiana\
    \ crop production. The first essay identifies the determinants of irrigation technology\
    \ \nadoption and acreage allocation using IV-probit and multivariate fractional\
    \ regression methods. \nThe estimated results indicate that education, extension\
    \ service, and risk aversion have negative \neffects, whereas landholding, laser\
    \ leveling, and rent status have a positive association with \nfurrow irrigation\
    \ acreage allocation. Similarly, energy cost, farm revenue, rent status, and \n\
    extension services tend to increase the center pivot acreage allocation. The marginal\
    \ effect values \nobtained from the IV-probit method are higher than those obtained\
    \ from the probit method.  On \naverage, the expected probability of furrow irrigation\
    \ adoption by farmers with a college degree \nor higher is 45% lower than that\
    \ of farmers with education below some college. The findings of \nthis study are\
    \ similar to those found by Toma et al. (2018).  This is because educated farmers\
    \ are \nmore likely to access useful information and tend to adopt new information\
    \ in their farming \n132 \n \npractices. The negative coefficient of extension\
    \ service implies that strengthening extension \nservices could have effective\
    \ policy implications towards water conservation efforts, irrigation \nproductivity,\
    \ and water sustainability.  \nThe second essay is associated with the evaluation\
    \ of irrigation efficiency using a \nstochastic frontier analysis and a data envelopment\
    \ analysis approach. It provides a basis to \nimprove current irrigation performance\
    \ by adjusting the input factors. Indeed, it would be useful \nin achieving existing\
    \ yield or better by input adjustment; potentially producers could get the \n\
    same production or better while minimizing input cost. The average inefficiency\
    \ score of around \n12.9% obtained from the SFA method indicates that a higher\
    \ irrigation efficiency can be \nachieved either by reducing current input level\
    \ or by increasing production level without \nchanging the current input level.\
    \ It is shown that regional factors and well size are possible \nexogenous determinants\
    \ that can explain a certain percentage of irrigation inefficiency. \nHowever,\
    \ this study is unable to detect other possible factors causing inefficiency.\
    \ There could \nbe some managerial issues that might be contributing to inefficiency.\
    \ Farmers need to be \nencouraged to adopt surge valves, moisture sensors, flow\
    \ meters, and computerized scheduling if \npossible in order to achieve a higher\
    \ irrigation efficiency. Additionally, this study used both \ninput and output-based\
    \ data envelopment approaches to estimate the TE of irrigation water. \nHowever,\
    \ the estimated TE score is lower than that obtained from the SFA method.  \n\
    The third essay analyzes the perception of farmers about the irrigation water\
    \ trading issue \nin Louisiana during critical crop growing periods. The estimated\
    \ results indicate that farmers \nwith higher gross farm revenue are less likely\
    \ to become involved in water trading. Farmers with \na higher age are less likely\
    \ to participate in water trading. Additionally, farmers who have more \n133 \n\
    \ \nrented land are less willing to participate in water trading, but farmers\
    \ with more owned land are \nmore likely to participate in irrigation water trading.\
    \  \nThe findings of this study should be beneficial to those who are concerned\
    \ about water \nproductivity and water resource conservation. Additionally, the\
    \ results could have greater policy \nimplications, especially in formulating\
    \ effective tools to promote efficient irrigation technology \nadoption and potential\
    \ water crisis management in the future. For example, the negative \nassociation\
    \ of extension with furrow irrigation adoption indicates that an effective role\
    \ of the \nextension service could be productive in motivating farmers to implement\
    \ best irrigation \npractices such as flow meters, moisture sensors, computerized\
    \ scheduling, and surge valves. If \nwater conservation is a major concern and\
    \ the investment in an efficient irrigation system is the \nmajor constraint for\
    \ its adoption, some kind of incentives or subsidies would be helpful. A policy\
    \ \nshould address this in a way that farmers would be encouraged to adopt efficient\
    \ irrigation \ntechnology and allocate more acreage for water-efficient irrigation\
    \ technology.  \n Technically, the SFA model specification is correct based on\
    \ the test statistics. However, \ndue to the limited information on sample size,\
    \ temperature, rainfall, soil characteristics, and \nmanagerial information, the\
    \ estimated results are not as good as they might be in a perfect \ninformation\
    \ scenario. This is the best possible estimates we could obtain with this limited\
    \ \ninformation. Regardless of data limitations, the SFA model specification is\
    \ accurate and \nproduced reasonable estimates of irrigation efficiency scores.\
    \ Similarly, irrigation technology \nadoption decisions depend on many factors,\
    \ such as soil characteristics, weather conditions, \ntemperature, and rainfall,\
    \ which are not addressed in this study. In future studies, these variables \n\
    need to be incorporated so as to get better estimates. The sample size is always\
    \ a crucial \ncomponent in any empirical work. In water trading as well, more\
    \ information is required.  \n134 \n \nAPPENDIX A. IRRIGATION EFFICIENCY  \nTable\

    Irrigation Survey \n \n160 \n \nImage B6: Cover Letter used in Second Round of\
    \ 2015 Survey \n \nDear Soybean Producer: \nAbout two weeks ago we sent a questionnaire\
    \ to you that asked about your experiences of \nsoybean irrigation in Louisiana.\
    \ To the best of our knowledge, it’s not yet been returned. \nThe purpose of this\
    \ survey is to examine trends and issues surrounding irrigation as a risk \nmanagement.\
    \ \nWe are writing again because of the importance that the ability to effectively\
    \ analyze all of \nthe issues related to irrigation is dependent on your participation.\
    \  Be assured that your \nresponses to this survey are anonymous and will be held\
    \ confidential.  Any presentation or \npublication of the results will only be\
    \ in an aggregate form as a summary of the entire survey \nresponses. \nA few\
    \ people have written to say that they should not have received the questionnaire\
    \ because \nthey no longer involve in soybean production or they have switched\
    \ to different occupation. If \neither of these concerns apply to you, please\
    \ let us know on the cover of the questionnaire and \nreturn it in the enclosed\
    \ envelope so that we can delete your name from the mailing list.   \nThe information\
    \ provided in this survey will be used to identify areas in which increased \n\
    efficiency and profitability can be gained in soybean irrigation while assuring\
    \ long run resource \nsustainability. The results of this study will hopefully\
    \ help Louisiana soybean producers more \neffectively utilize irrigation as a\
    \ risk management strategy and continue to make the soybean \nindustry competitive\
    \ for years to come.  \nWe hope that you will fill out and return the questionnaire\
    \ soon, but if for any reason you prefer \nnot to answer it, please let us know\
    \ by returning a note or blank questionnaire in the enclosed \nstamped envelope.\
    \ \nThis project has been approved by the LSU AgCenter Institutional Review Board\
    \ (IRB).  If \nyou have any questions about your rights as a research volunteer,\
    \ please contact Dr. Michael \nJ. Keenan at (225) 578-1708. \n \nThank you for\
    \ participating in this process to maintain the profitability and competitiveness\
    \ of \nthe Louisiana Soybean Industry. We would greatly appreciate getting your\
    \ response within the \nnext two weeks.  If you have any questions or concerns\
    \ regarding this survey, please feel free \nto contact us. \n \nSincerely,  \n\

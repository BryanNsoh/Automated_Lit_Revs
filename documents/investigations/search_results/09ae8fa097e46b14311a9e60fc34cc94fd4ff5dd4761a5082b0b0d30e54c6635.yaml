    Get rights and content Abstract The projected increases in World population and
    need for food have recently motivated adoption of information technology solutions
    in crop fields within precision agriculture approaches. Internet Of Underground
    Things (IOUT), which consists of sensors and communication devices, partly or
    completely buried underground for real-time soil sensing and monitoring, emerge
    from this need. This new paradigm facilitates seamless integration of underground
    sensors, machinery, and irrigation systems with the complex social network of
    growers, agronomists, crop consultants, and advisors. In this paper, state-of-the-art
    communication architectures are reviewed, and underlying sensing technology and
    communication mechanisms for IOUT are presented. Moreover, recent advances in
    the theory and applications of wireless underground communication are also reported.
    Finally, major challenges in IOUT design and implementation are identified. Previous

    population will increase by 33% in 2050, doubling the need for food [124]. Yet
    today, up to 70% of all water withdrawals are due to food production. This demands
    novel technologies to produce more crop for drop. USDA Agricultural Resource Management
    Survey (ARMS) is the primary source of information on the financial condition,
    production practices, and resource use of America’s farm businesses and the economic
    well-being of America’s farm households. ARMS data show that precision agriculture
    has recently become a widespread practice nationwide. In Fig. 1, adoption rates
    of major precision agriculture approaches (bars) along with the total precision
    agriculture adoption rate (line) are shown for maize for each year of USDA ARMS
    publication (USDA ARMS 2015 version was under development at the time of this
    writing). It can be observed that adoption rate of precision agriculture for maize
    increased from 17.29% in 1997 to 72.47% in 2010 with similar trends observed for
    other crops such as soybean and peanuts. Aside from presenting a growing trend
    in the usage of precision agriculture in maize production, it is evident that
    as new technologies emerge, they are widely adopted by farmers. Download : Download

    technology adoption in maize production (USDA ARMS Data). Among the various precision
    agriculture techniques, crop yield monitoring is the most widely adopted technique
    (61.4%). In addition, guidance and auto-steering system adoption jumped from 5.34%
    in 2001 to 45.16% in nine years. Use of equipment and crop location information
    enables precise control with auto-steering systems which reduce production and
    maintenance costs and reduces repetitive field work for farmers. Despite the drastic
    increase in adoption rates of other techniques, Variable Rate Technology (VRT)
    adoption has been relatively steady, where adoption rate increased from 8.04%
    in 1998 to only 11.54% in 2005. Adaptive application of resources like fertilizers,
    pesticide, and water promises significant gains in crop production but requires
    accurate and timely information from the field. It can be observed that only after
    the adoption of recent crop moisture sensing technology, VRT adoption doubled
    to 22.44% in 2010. During the same period, crop moisture sensing adoption increased
    from 36.21% in 2005 to 51.68% in 2010. It is clear that the success and adoption
    of VRT depends on advancing soil monitoring approaches. Despite being the most
    recent precision agriculture technology, crop moisture sensing has become one
    of the most adopted practices. Yet techniques are still limited to manual data
    collection or limited field coverage. 2. A new paradigm: IOUT Most recently, the
    need for real-time in-situ information from agricultural fields have given rise
    to a new type of IoT: Internet Of Underground Things (IOUT). IOUT represents autonomous
    devices that collect any relevant information about the Earth and are interconnected
    with communication and networking solutions that facilitate sending the information
    out of fields to the growers and decision mechanisms. IOUT is envisioned to not
    only provide in-situ monitoring capabilities (e.g., soil moisture, salinity, and
    temperature), but when interconnected with existing field machinery (irrigation
    systems, harvesters, and seeders) enable complete field autonomy and pave the
    way for more efficient food production solutions. In IOUT, Communications can
    be carried out through the soil and plants from underground devices, and information
    acquired from the field can be sent to the cloud for real-time decision making.
    IOUT applications have unique requirements; i.e., information from soil, operation
    in remote crop fields, wireless communication through plants and soil, and exposure
    to elements. Existing over-the-air (OTA) wireless communication solutions face
    significant challenges because they were not designed for these circumstances.
    As such, IOUT also gives rise to a new type of wireless communications: wireless
    underground (UG) communications [68], [152], where radios are buried in soil and
    wireless communication is conducted partly or completely through the soil. Integration
    of UG communications with IOUT will help conserve water resources and improve
    crop yields [143], [145]. Moreover, advances in IOUT will benefit other applications
    including landslide monitoring, pipeline assessment, underground mining, and border
    patrol [67], [69], [71], [84], [94], [102], [106], [115], [132], [138], [142],
    [146], [150], [152], [159]. This paper presents IOUT for the design of precision
    agriculture solutions. We first discuss functionalities, architecture, and components
    of IOUT. In Section 4 and 5, we present sensing and communication technologies
    of IOUT. In Section 6, we list IOUT testbeds and existing solutions. We conclude
    by discussing challenges of IOUT. 3. IOUT architecture IOUT will consist of interconnected
    heterogeneous devices tailored to the crop and field operations. Common desirable
    functionalities of IOUT are: • In-situ sensing: On board soil moisture, temperature,
    salinity sensors are required for accurate localized knowledge of the soil. These
    sensors can be either integrated on the chip along-with other components of the
    architecture, or they can be used as separate sensors that can be connected to
    the main components. • Wireless communication in challenging environments: Communication
    components of IOUT devices are either deployed on the field or within the soil.
    For OTA communication, solutions should be tailored to the changing environment
    due to irrigation and crop growth. Over the air communication is used to store
    the data on a more secure and accessible service/device. In addition, any system
    on the field is exposed to natural elements and should be designed to sustain
    challenging conditions. Underground communication solutions, while mostly shielded
    from the environment, require the ability to communicate through soil and adjust
    its parameters to adapt to dynamic changes in soil. • Inter-connection of field
    machinery, sensors, radios, and cloud: It is desirable that IOUT architecture
    links a diverse multitude of devices on a crop field to the cloud for seamless
    integration. Accordingly, IOUT architecture will not only provide collected information
    but will also automate operations on the field based on this information. • Real-time
    Decision Making: Information about soil and crop conditions should be available
    to the managers and decision support systems for real-time decision making at
    each level. • Mobility: IOUT will have seamless support for both fixed and mobile
    devices with backing of short-term and long-term communications. Based on these
    main required functionalities, a representative IOUT architecture is illustrated
    in Fig. 2, with the following components. • Underground things (UTs): An UT consist
    of an embedded system with communication and sensing components, where a part
    of or the entire system resides underground. UTs are protected by weatherproof
    enclosures and, in underground settings, watertight containers. Buried UTs are
    protected from the farm equipment, wild rodents, and extreme weather conditions.
    Sensors typically include soil temperature and moisture sensors, but a wide range
    of other soil- or weather-related phenomena can be monitored which will be discussed
    in detail on Section 4. Existing communication schemes include Bluetooth, ZigBee,
    NFC, Wi-Fi, Sigfox, LoRa, LoRaWAN, satellite, cellular, and underground. A UT
    using Bluetooth [105] or underground wireless [86] can communicate over 100 meters,
    commercial products at ISM-band can cover three times larger distances, whereas
    longer-distance connectivity is possible through cellular or satellite. Considering
    the relatively large field sizes, nodes can be configured to form networks capable
    of transferring all the sensed information to a collector sink and self-heal in
    the event that nodes become unreachable (e.g., Irromesh [24]). Nodes are generally
    powered by a combination of batteries and, if on field, solar panels. Cost of
    UTs is expected to be relatively inexpensive as they are deployed by the multitude
    [96]. • Base stations are used as gateways to transfer the collected data to the
    cloud. They are installed in permanent structures such as weather stations or
    buildings. Base stations are more expensive as they are better safe-guarded and
    have higher processing powers and communication capabilities [96]. • Mobile sinks
    are installed in equipment that move around the field periodically or as required,
    such as tractors and irrigation systems [86]. Since irrigation machinery advance
    at a slow pace, the soil data is received ahead of time allowing instant adjustment
    on the water application rate. On the other hand, when weather conditions are
    favorable, turning on the irrigation equipment only for data retrieval purpose
    is expensive. An alternative is to use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) such as
    quadrotors or ground robots to retrieve the measurements. • Cloud services are
    intended to use for permanent storage of the data collected, real-time processing
    of the field condition, crop related decision making, and integration with other
    databases (e.g., weather, soil). Download : Download high-res image (466KB) Download

    of such a diverse range of communication architectures makes it challenging to
    form a unified IOUT architecture with the ability to fulfill agricultural requirements
    seamlessly. This is further complicated due to the lack of standard protocols
    for sensing and communication tailored to the IOUT. In the following, we explain
    in detail the sensing (Section 4) and communication (Section 5) mechanisms with
    a focus on desired characteristics of IOUT for real-time sensing and effective
    communications. 4. Sensing The main functionality of IOUT is real-time sensing.
    Sensing has led to adoption of technology in the precision agriculture and it
    also enables improved efficiency of agricultural production and practices [127].
    An overview of sensing technologies is presented next. Soil moisture: Soil moisture
    (SM) sensors have been used for decades in crop fields to measure water content.
    Automated technologies have largely replaced the use of hand-held/manual soil
    moisture technologies because of difficulties associated with taking manual soil
    moisture readings in production fields in remote locations. In the last decade,
    wireless data harvesting technologies have been developed that provide managers
    and users real-time access to soil moisture data which has resulted in more effective
    water management decision-making. Important SM measurement methods are described
    below: • Gravimetric sampling is a direct and standard method of measuring SM.
    It is used to determine the volumetric water content of the soil. This method
    determines SM by a ratio of soil’s dry mass to the wet soil mass including the
    pore spaces. It requires manual sampling and oven drying of soil samples taken
    from the field [91]. • Resistive sensors [50] such as granular matrix sensors
    work on the principal of electrical conductivity of water and measuring resistance
    changes based on soil water content. This method requires calibration of sensors
    for accurate SM reading. • Capacitive sensors measure SM based on changes in capacitance
    of soil due to water content variations. Capacitive sensors, which are generally
    of higher accuracy than resistive sensors but cost more, are being used by commercial
    UTs. • Ground Penetrating Radars (GPR) [66], [98] are based on the absorption
    and reflection of electromagnetic waves. Impulse, frequency sweep, and frequency
    modulated technologies are used in SM sensing. This method is used to measure
    near-surface soil moisture (up to 10 cm). • Neutron scattering probes [87], [92]
    and gauges use radiation scattering techniques to measure SM by estimating changes
    in neutron flux density due to the water content of the soil are the most accurate
    soil moisture probes used in fields. They require specific licenses to be used.
    • Gamma ray attenuation [90], time-domain reflectometry (TDR) [128], and frequency-domain
    reflectometry (FDR) [139] are other popular SM measurement approaches. Common
    SM sensors used in fields are shown in Fig. 3. SM sensors are buried at depths
    of 5  cm to 75  cm in soil depending on the crop type and root depth. SM data
    obtained from these sensors is used to create soil moisture maps which help real-time
    decision making. SM sensors have been deployed in fields with increasing frequency.
    For example, the Nebraska Agricultural Water Management Network [99], [101], was
    established with only 20 growers in 2005 and currently serves over 1400 growers
    to enable the adoption of water and energy conservation practices using SM sensors.
    In addition to in-situ soil moisture sensors, other soil moisture data sources
    are Soil Climate Analysis Network [49], US Climate Reference Network [60], TAMU
    North American Soil Moisture Database [53], Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity [48],
    NASA North American Land Data Assimilation System [27], and NASA Soil Moisture
    Active Passive [46]. These databases contain soil moisture and temperature informations
    of vast geographical areas and augment the Web Soil Survey (WSS) [63], which collects
    and classifies the US soil information by region. Download : Download high-res

    Top row: Gravimetric [91], resistive (Watermark) [50], capacitance [17], Bottom
    Row: GPR [98], TDR [128], neutron probe [92]. Other soil physical properties:
    In addition to soil moisture sensing, other soil properties can be measured to
    populate the soil map such as the organic mater present in the soil, acidity (pH)
    [135], percentage of sand, clay and silt particles [137], and nutrients such as
    Mg, P, OM, Ca, base saturation Mg, base saturation K, base saturation Ca, CEC,
    K/Mg, and Ca/Mg ratios [104], [110], [113]. In-situ, real-time measurement of
    these properties still face challenges due to size, cost, and technology limitations.
    Yield monitoring: Yield monitoring provides spatial distribution of crop yield
    at the end of a growing season and is used make long-term decisions about agriculture
    operations [108], [118]. Yield monitors are usually installed on farm equipment
    and automatically collects yield data during harvesting. More specifically, mass
    flow sensors are installed on grain containers to record grain inflow along with
    location (e.g., Force Sensor by Ag Leader). The collected data is analyzed using
    geographic information system (GIS) tools such as ArchInfo, Mapinfo, and Environment
    System Research International tools. Electrical conductivity and topography surveys:
    The ability of soil to conduct current is measured through soil electrical conductivity
    (EC) [116]. Coupled with field topography (elevation and slope), EC data provides
    an insight into the crop yield. EC (through contact and no-contact methods) is
    used to determine the amount of nitrogen usage, water holding and cation-exchange
    capacity, drainage, and rooting depth. EC maps are used to classify the field
    into zones. Then, precision agriculture practices such as variable rate irrigation,
    variable rate seeding, nitrogen, yield, and drainage management are applied based
    on zoning. EC mapping can be done using apparent electrical conductivity (ECa)
    [88], visible-near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (VNIR) [75], and electromagnetic
    Induction (EMI) [141] approaches. An array of commercial tools are available,
    e.g., Veris 3100 [61], EC400 sensors combined with GPS systems [107] are used
    for EC mapping. Weather and environmental sensing: Weather and environmental sensors
    are used to sense soil and air temperature, direction and speed of winds, and
    other environmental effects such as rainfall, solar emissions and humidity. For
    example, John Deere has introduced sensors to assess these phenomena in their
    commercial Field Connect solution [25]. Availability of this information is useful
    for real-time and fully informed precision agriculture decisions. A mesoscale
    network (MesoNet), consists of nodes for weather and environment sensing, spanning
    over a large geographic area. MesoNet [34] is used to observe major changes in
    weather patterns, and when combined with IOUT sensing can be used to provide real-time
    weather information at the farm level. Soil macro-nutrients sensing: Macro-Nutrients
    such as nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorous are vital for the crop growth. The
    assessment of these nutrients helps to determine the fertilizer impact and future
    applications. Optical sensing is based on reflectance spectroscopy to measure
    the reflection and absorption by these macrosimulation [104], [110], [113]. To
    detect nitrate and sulfate concentration in natural water resources, a sensing
    method using planar electromagnetic sensors has been developed in [121]. This
    method is used to sense nitrate and sulfate levels by correlating the impedance
    of the sensor array with the concentration of these pollutants. It has been shown
    that sensor impedance decreases with increase in concentration of these chemicals
    [121]. Electrochemical, VIS-NIRS spectroscopy, and ATR spectroscopy are the major
    soil macro-nutrients sensing approaches. These soil macro-nutrients sensing approaches
    are limited to sense one desired ion because membrane used in these methods only
    responds to one ion [113]. To achieve concurrent multi-ion sensing, a major challenge
    is to form a detector array for soil macro-nutrients sensing [104]. Remote sensing:
    Remote sensing based approaches uses electromagnetic waves which interact with
    soil and plants in precision agriculture. These approaches work on the measurement
    of intensity of reflected components of the electromagnetic waves as these interact
    with soil and plants [120]. Spatial resolution of remote sensing techniques is
    a major issue; however, when combined with in-situ IOUT sensing approaches, they
    may result in fine resolution, which can be used to produce field maps for analysis
    and decision making in precision agriculture. Examples of these include soil moisture,
    yield [72], texture [140], pesticides applications [95], and nutrient field maps
    [2], [112], [120]. Remote sensing has also applications in satellite data fusion,
    crop structure and condition monitoring. Other precision agriculture technologies:
    A myriad of other technologies is playing vital role in the precision agriculture
    practices. Here we briefly mention these technologies as useful IOUT tools. These
    include precision planting, geolocation, GIS systems, soil sampling and field
    analysis map generation, drones, auto-steering and VRT. In precision planting
    [38], the seeding is done using a very fine predetermined inter plant distance,
    and robots with lasers are used for automatic weed zapping. Farm devices in the
    field are aligned automatically with robovator technology. With GPS, it has become
    possible to divide a farm into different zones based on the field conditions [160].
    Variable rate fertilizer application [2], [78], [95] is also important for crop
    yield improvement. Wireless communications with drones also constitutes a major
    component of the IOUT connectivity. GreenStar Lightbar [15] is a tool from Deere
    & Co that is used to determine the location and width in the row crops. TK-GPS
    [57] is another device used to perform real time soil mapping. The sensing technologies
    discussed in this section present many opportunities for advancing the state of
    precision agriculture through the IOUT. Availability of inexpensive sensors and
    their ability to communicate wireless enables their integrations to control systems
    in IOUT. Therefore, wireless communications, between heterogeneous equipment used
    in these sensor technology, has an important role in realization of the real-time
    decision making in IOUT. Moreover, adoption of sensor technology could be raised
    by a well-connected, reliable, and secure IOUT, and it will also help in development
    of improved sensing technologies in precision agriculture. Because, currently,
    the lack of availability of robust connectivity in the field is hindering rapid
    advancements in sensing technologies. Different approaches for wireless communications
    in IOUT are discussed in the next section. 5. Wireless connectivity Connectivity
    solutions for IOUT can be classified as in-field communications and cloud connectivity
    as discussed next. 5.1. In-field communications In-field communication solutions
    integrate UTs and other communication entities on the field. Most commercial solutions
    utilize OTA communications, whereas IOUT are expected to feature wireless underground
    communications. For short-range communication and networking, license-free standards
    such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, and DASH7 are used in ISM bands. More recently, regulatory
    restrictions are relaxed by the FCC through new rules that allow the use of TV
    white space frequencies in farms [14] (Order No. DA 16-307 Dated: Mar 24, 2016),
    where interference with other licensed devices is not expected. The major challenge
    for OTA communications is the lack of studies about the impacts of crops and farm
    environment on wireless propagation and associated tailored solutions to farms.
    In the following, we discuss in-field communications in detail. UG communications:
    UG communication solutions enable complete concealment of UTs, which decrease
    operation costs and impacts from external elements [86]. For a buried UT radio,
    two types of communication scenarios arise. Aboveground communications involve
    communication between UTs and aboveground devices. Underground communication is
    carried out between UTs. Furthermore, due to the soil-air interface, aboveground
    communication links are not symmetric and need to be analyzed in terms of underground-to-aboveground
    and aboveground-to-underground communication. In Fig. 4, the path loss of these
    links are shown as a result of field experiments [86]. It can be observed that
    practical underground link distances are still limited to 12  m to allow for practical
    multi-hop connectivity. Yet, communication ranges of up to 200  m is possible
    for aboveground communications. Download : Download high-res image (185KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Communication from soil. For UG communications,
    the communication medium is soil, which impacts communication success in six main
    ways: (1) Soil texture and bulk density: EM waves exhibit attenuation when incident
    in soil medium. These variations vary with texture and bulk density of soil. Soil
    is composed of pore spaces, clay, sand, and silt particles. Relative concentration
    of these particles result in 12 soil textural classes [91]. Water holding capacity
    of each soil type is different because of its pore size. For example, lower water
    holding capacity of sandy soil leads to lower attenuation and high root mean square
    delay spread, whereas higher water holding capacities of silt loam and silty clay
    loam soils result in low root mean square delay spread and higher attenuation
    [133], [134]. (2) Soil moisture: The effective permittivity of soil is a complex
    number. Thus, besides diffusion attenuation, EM waves also suffer absorption by
    soil water content and its variations. Soil dielectric spectra and its conductivity
    depends on the soil moisture. The relative dielectric constant range of dry soil
    is between 2 and 6 and its conductivity ranges from to   Si/m, where soils at
    near-saturation level have a relative dielectric constant in the range of 5–15
    and conductivity between to   Si/m [147]. Coherence bandwidth of the underground
    channel is limited to a few hundred KHz range [129], [130], [131], which limits
    data rates. Coherence bandwidth also varies with soil moisture, making design
    of advanced techniques challenging. (3) Distance and depth variations: Sensors
    in IOUT applications are usually buried in the top sub-meter layer. Thus, in addition
    to distance, channel quality depends on deployment depth because of the impacts
    of the soil-air interface, which causes refraction of EM waves. Nodes at higher
    burial depths experience higher attenuation [129]. (4) Antennas in soil: When
    an antenna is buried, its return loss characteristics change due to the high permittivity
    of soil [85], [151]. Moreover, with the variation in soil moisture and hence soil
    permittivity, the return loss of the antenna varies with time too. Changes in
    return loss results in variations in resonant frequency, which is shifted to the
    lower spectrum, and system bandwidth, creating additional challenges for UG communication.
    (5) Frequency variations: The pathloss caused by attenuation is frequency dependent
    because of dipole relaxation associated with water. Generally, lower frequency
    spectrum has lower attenuation, because at higher frequencies, water absorption
    plays a dominant role. In addition, when EM waves propagate in soil, their wavelength
    shortens due to higher permittivity of soil than the air. Therefore, channel capacity
    in soil is also a function of operation frequency [85]. (6) Lateral waves: For
    two UTs, wireless underground communication is conducted through three major paths:
    lateral, direct, and reflected (LDR) waves [86], [130], [133]. Direct and reflected
    waves reside completely in soil and therefore, suffer from the challenges above.
    On the other hand, lateral waves travel partly on the soil-air interface in air,
    experiencing the lowest attenuation. Lateral waves plays an important role in
    extending underground communication ranges. (7) Recent advances in wireless underground
    communications: Recent developments in wireless underground communications include
    the characterization of wireless UG channel and development of environment-aware,
    cross-layer communication solutions to achieve high data rate, long range communications
    with applications to precision agriculture. The impulse response of the wireless
    UG channel is captured and analyzed through extensive experiments [133]. With
    more than 1500 measurement in an underground greenhouse testbed, the effects of
    soil moisture and soil texture on wireless underground communication channel are
    analyzed. Through this analysis, the vital statistics of wireless UG channel impulse
    response (e.g., coherence bandwidth, root mean square delay spread, and power
    associated with multipath) are developed. The three main components of the UG
    channel, direct wave, reflected wave, and the lateral wave are validated. The
    coherence bandwidth of the UG channel has been shown to be less than 1.15  MHz
    which further decreases to 418  kHz for the distances greater than 12  m in soil
    [133]. Change in soil moisture also impacts the root mean square delay spread
    which requires moisture-based dynamic adaptation techniques in UG communications.
    The statistical model [134] is vital for tailored solutions for underground multi-carrier
    communication and soil moisture adaptive beamforming. Based on impulse response
    analysis, the multi-carrier modulation and wireless underground channel diversity
    reception schemes have been developed for the realization of high data rate communications
    [129]. The effects of soil type and moisture on the underground antenna, channel
    and system capacity are highlighted. Based on this analysis, multi-carrier modulation
    and wireless underground channel diversity reception schemes [131] have been developed.
    The optimum maximum ratio combining (MRC-LDR) achieves the maximum gain. In this
    approach, three times SNR enhancement is achieved as compared to the SNR of a
    single antenna matched filter UG receiver. However, the interference from the
    reflected components is still present. Adaptive combining (AC-LDR) uses adaptive
    switching and selection process to suppresses undesired interference. Based on
    the proximity of the LDR receiver, either the D-wave or L-Wave component is dominant
    at the receiver. AC-LDR exploits this by adaptively switching and selecting the
    strongest lateral, or the direct wave. The R-Wave is not considered because it
    is the weakest component and results in performance degradation. In [131], the
    performance analysis of different modulation schemes through simulations and experiments
    has been carried out. The BER under equalization and diversity reception has been
    reported. A 3 times increase in SNR and improvement in BER from to are shown in
    wireless underground communication channel. Since use of sensing technologies
    in precision agriculture depend on reliable UG communications, these is a demand
    for high date rate, ubiquitous, reliable communications. These low error rate
    communication techniques help to achieve that goal in precision agriculture. Moreover,
    based on UG antenna analysis, soil moisture adaptive beamforming (SMABF) using
    underground antenna arrays is also developed [130]. SMABF employs underground
    antenna arrays at the transmitter and omni-directional antenna at the receiver.
    The lateral wave is maximized if the energy from the UG antenna is radiated in
    an optimum angle. In SMABF, beam steering is done to exploit the lateral wave
    in the underground communication by sending the energy in the optimum angle which
    maximizes lateral wave and leads to higher directivity. SMABF has complex array
    structures and needs phase shifters. With these advancements in UG communications,
    it has become possible to make progress from data collection to real-time processing
    and decision making in precision agriculture. Magnetic induction (MI) and acoustic
    UG communications: Magnetic Induction (MI) based communications is another approach
    for UG communications. In magnetic induction [114], [143], the rate of decay of
    received signal strength (RSS) is the inverse cube factor. Therefore, long range,
    high data rates signaling can not be done using MI, which is vital for IOUT paradigm.
    Moreover, the perpendicularity of transmitter and receiver coils (antennas) is
    a prohibiting factor to establish communications in MI. Wavelengths in MI communications
    tend to be large. Therefore, IOUT architecture can not scale with MI based UG
    communications in IOUT. Hence, because of these limiting factors, and due to in-feasibility
    of MI communications to establish communications with aboveground devices, MI
    based communications is not a reliable option for IOUT. EM-based UG communications
    are more suitable. There are also some common characteristics in underwater communication
    [74] and UG communications. However, underwater communications can not utilize
    electromagnetic (EM) waves because of higher degradation of signals and water
    absorption. Therefore, other approaches (e.g., acoustic [74]) are used in underwater
    communications. Moreover, the acoustic approach is infeasible in IOUT UG communications
    because of vibration limitations. Underground to UAV communications: The unmanned
    aerial vehicle (UAVs, also called drones) have recently emerged in the precision
    agriculture practices for sensing and communications of the filed conditions [123],
    [148], agricultural surveillance using imaging [97], [83], and decision support
    [144]. Before the use of UAVs in precision agriculture, the satellite imagery
    was obtained for the purpose of monitoring. Through the use of UAV imaging, a
    detailed soil moisture map of the field can be produced in timely and inexpensive
    manner. Moreover, the crop growth can also be monitored by using UAVs and accordingly
    vegetation index is generated. The seed planting and pesticide applications are
    other important applications of UAVs in precision agriculture. The UAVs, when
    integrated with the IOUT in the field, will require reliable communications with
    sensors and radio equipment for real-time decision making. There are many challenges
    from UG to UAV communications (e.g., restrictions on UAV communications payloads
    and antennas, limited flight times, low communication range from the UG to UAV
    link, and specific operator skills and licenses required for UAV operation). Technology
    and regulatory advances in these areas will lead to enhanced integration of UAVs
    in precision agriculture IOUT. Low power wide area networks (LPWAN): Since IOUT
    is designed for prolonged operation in the agricultural field, energy conservation
    plays important role in long term functionality and connectivity. Low Power Wide
    Area Networks (LPWAN) are designed not only to achieve energy conservation objective
    but also to attain long-range connectivity [122]. Due to this, LPWAN is suitable
    for IOUT communications where high data rate operations are not required and low
    latency of data transfer can be accepted for some applications. According to LPWAN
    Technical Workgroup, it has capacity to work over the time span of many years
    and is specifically designed for applications which need to transmit small packets
    intermittently. A brief overview of LPWAN technologies is given in the following:
    (1) LoRa: Approaches designed to conserve energy like Long Range Wide Area Network
    (LoRaWAN) favor one-hop star topology where end-devices transmit small packets
    of information (0.290–50  kbps) over long distances (up to 45  km in rural areas)
    [80]. This is more suitable for battery powered devices. Reliable communication
    over long distance is possible because of techniques like adaptive data rate,
    LoRa’s chord spread spectrum radio modulation scheme, and gateways that decode
    data received on multiple channels modulated with different spreading factors
    [111]. However, since LoRa uses unlicensed frequency, the channel utilization
    is limited to 30 seconds per day by regulations. For application that requires
    a QoS level, the download channel increase the probability of collisions [81].
    In precision agriculture, LoRa technology provides low-cost low-power communication
    solution for prolonged monitoring operations [29]. (2) Sigfox: Sigfox [44] is
    the first LPWAN technology and highly efficient in spectrum usage. It uses ultra
    narrow band (UNB) modulation. The communication range of Sigfox is up to 45  km
    and 12  km in rural and urban areas respectively. Sigfox supports data rates of
    up to 250  kbps, and also uses unlicensed spectrum (868  MHz and 902  MHz) for
    communications. Consequently, the amount of data that can be transferred daily
    is also limited by regulations [161]. Sigfox provides many opportunities in precision
    agriculture IOUT to support connectivity among field equipment and UT sensors
    [45]. (3) On-Ramp/Ingenu: On-Ramp developed the IEEE 802.15.4k [20] technical
    standard for LWPAN. It only specifies the physical and MAC layer, and upper layers
    are complimented by other standards which operates at the upper layers. It uses
    higher bandwidth (1 MHz) as compared to other LWPAN technologies. IEEE 802.15.4k
    uses 902–928  MHz unlicensed spectrum. Its communication range is up to 15  km.
    Hence, it more suitable for communications agricultural forms spanning over large
    geographical areas [35]. (4) NB-IoT: NB-IoT [154] is a new physical layer standard
    by 3GPP LTE (Release 13). It can coexist with LTE and GSM. NB-IoT also uses narrowband
    signal and is meant for low data rate applications. It only uses 180  KHz of its
    200  KHz bandwidth. NB-IoT operates in licensed spectrum and uses same band as
    of LTE. It supports standalone operation, broadband operation, and in-band operation.
    NB-IoT is also being used in many commercial agricultural solutions in Europe
    [32]. It also facilitates low-cost, long range, and prolonged battery life solutions
    in precision agriculture. (5) Extended coverage GSM IoT: EC-GSM-IoT [12] is another
    low power long range LWPAN standard based on software update to cellular eGPRS.
    It can also co-exist with other mobile networks and designed to support battery
    life of up to 10 years. It operates in 800  MHz to 900  MHz and 1800 to 1900  MHz
    GSM bands. Many features of EC-GSM-IoT (e.g., inexpensive equipment, long range
    and coverage) makes it suitable for IOUT communication in precision agriculture.
    NWave [33], Platanus [36], Weightless [64], and Ingenu [20] are other major notable
    LPWAN technologies, which can be used for IOUT communications depending on the
    deployment, application, energy requirement, and equipment. These are also being
    used in precision agriculture connected vineyards [11]. Wireless PAN/LAN: Wireless
    PAN/LAN is also important for communications between farm machinery and equipment,
    field workers and central base stations in the field. Use of Wireless LAN/PAN
    enables high data rate, low latency communication in IOUT, which are not supported
    by LPWAN. Wireless PAN/LAN include many technologies such as Bluetooth, ZigBee,
    Thread, and Wi-Fi. In the following we present brief overview of these technologies:
    (1) Bluetooth: Bluetooth [5] is standardized by Special Interest Group (SIG).
    Communication can be done up to 100  m distances and it uses frequency hopping
    spread spectrum technique. Bluetooth Smart is the low energy version and can operate
    in broadcast and connected mode. Bluetooth uses 2.4  GHz ISM band and has bandwidth
    up to 25  MHz. It is also being used in development of a low energy moisture-
    and temperature sensor intended for use in an agricultural wireless sensor network
    system [76]. (2) ZigBee: ZigBee [65] operates on the top of 802.15.4 MAC/PHY and
    it consists of application and network layer protocols. It can operate in a star
    and mesh topology with bandwidth up to 1  MHz and communication range of up to
    10 to 30 meters. A smart agriculture system by using ZigBee technology has been
    developed in [117]. (3) Thread: Thread [56], self-healing mesh network protocol,
    functions on IEEE 802.15.4 MAC/PHY and is simple and secure battery friendly LAN
    protocol. It can supports up to 250 devices and provides security at network and
    application layers. (4) Wi-Fi: IEEE 802.11 [19] is high data rate communication
    standard with support for data rates higher than 1  Gbps. It has physical layer
    standards for different ISM bands (2.4  GHz, 5  GHz and 60  GHz) and used different
    channel bandwidth up to 160  MHz. A remote monitoring system using WiFi, where
    the wireless sensor nodes are based on WSN802G modules, has been developed in
    [119]. Cellular technology in IOUT: As more and more IOUT applications are being
    developed, the demand for cellular and broadband connectivity IOUT solutions is
    reaching at critical levels. Lack of broadband cellular communication in rural
    areas is a major challenge as it hinders instant access to big data being generated
    from the field. Currently, data has to be collected and transmitted manually from
    the deployed IOUT systems which is major bottleneck in adoption of precision agriculture
    practices in remote rural areas. One main factor for non-existent or slow cellular
    data communication speeds is the huge expenditure on commissioning of required
    infrastructure rural communities. There are also many system and cost related
    challenges in Machine-to-Machine (M2M) cellular communications [70] as main purpose
    of cellular design was human communications. However, a recent release of LTE
    cellular standard has the support for M2M communications and can be used for communication
    in production fields being served with LTE networks. However, IOUT devices are
    required to be compatible with the cellular standard and energy consumption challenges
    restricts their use in battery powered devices for prolonged duration. To overcome
    these challenges, low power devices can be connected through in-field communications
    and subsequently data can be collected and transmitted to the cloud by using externally
    powered gateways with cellular capabilities. Energy consumption in IOUT: In IOUT,
    energy consumption is a vital issue because of the low power requirement for sensors
    in order to operate for prolonged periods without battery replacement. Moreover,
    the channel quality in UG communications is impacted by physical parameters of
    the soil (e.g., soil moisture). In [84], a connectivity model of IOUT for different
    soil physical parameters has been developed by designing the cluster size distribution
    under sub-critical constraints. A novel aboveground communication coverage model
    for underground clusters has been developed. To maintain connectivity while reducing
    energy consumption the transmit power control and environment aware routing are
    proposed. It is shown that these approaches can maintain network connectivity
    under all soil moisture conditions while reducing energy consumption. Moreover,
    it has also been shown that use of relaying nodes based on soil wetness conditions
    can further decrease the energy consumption. 5.2. Cloud and big data in precision
    agriculture Due to limited processing power and energy considerations, data processing
    and decision making are not generally conducted locally. Depending on privacy
    considerations, field information can be stored in a private database, provided
    to the public databases, or shared with other users [157]. There are online marketplaces
    where big data sets and agricultural apps are used to analyze a region and make
    decisions to maximize crop yield [136]. Additionally, in-situ SM sensors can be
    linked to national soil moisture databases for complete, accurate, and comprehensive
    information of soil moisture [27], [46], [48], [49], [53], [60], [63]. With the
    support of cloud services, real-time visualization and decision support can be
    provided. Therefore, Cloud can be used as a hub of data storage and processing
    applications in precision agricultural. Moreover, Cloud allows the scalability
    of IOUT paradigm from the field level to bigger geographic areas by forming network
    of farms. On the other hand, in the absence of storage or processing constraints,
    base stations on the fields can pull meteorological data from a weather service
    or soil information from a national service, fuse this information with in-situ
    data from UTs, and control the farming equipment. To have a fully automated system,
    farming equipment should include a controller that can be accessed remotely. The
    integration of IOUT with creates new avenues to form robust stakeholders in precision
    agriculture such as growers, industry, and trading companies and would results
    in increased efficiency and sustainability of whole precision agriculture ecosystem.
    In addition to integration of farm equipment data to soil and weather databases,
    other examples include linking UAVs and robotics to precision agriculture paradigm.
    Irrespective of in-situ or cloud processing, the main challenge is the integration
    of heterogeneous systems. Moreover, reliable data transfer from field to cloud,
    and cloud to farm, will constitute an important functionality of the IOUT cloud
    architecture. This functionality will not only help connect fields over vast geographical
    areas to the cloud, but will also facilitate local farms to use this data for
    assessment and improvement of crop yield. Moreover, there is a need of development
    of standardized interfaces for seamless connectivity and collaboration between
    different components of the precision agriculture ecosystem. The IOUT paradigm
    enables sensing and communications of even minor changes in the field including
    change in physical properties of the soil and growth of plants. Major sources
    of big data in precision agriculture are ESA satellite images, NDVI from drones,
    user maps (yield, electrical conductivity, and others), and soil data. This process
    generates big data and it becomes very important to extract meaningful information
    from this huge amount of data. This is also crucial for real-time end user decision
    making and in evaluation of return on investment. Therefore, it is necessary to
    develop big data analytics in precision agriculture [156]. It is also essential
    to analyze the reduction in input cost in water resources, energy consumption
    and labor cost by adopting precision agriculture practices [73]. Other examples
    of the big data analytics in precision agriculture are factors affecting crop
    yield; and demarcation of field zones based on particular application such as
    productivity, soil moisture, nutrients, harvesting. Farmers, as the biggest stakeholder
    in the precision agriculture, need to use the technology to see the potential
    benefits with out being overloaded with the data. Therefore, the big data analytics
    to show increase in crop yield and improvement in overall production efficiencies,
    which can deliver tangible benefits, are vital for success of the whole precision
    agriculture ecosystem. 6. An overview of IOUT enabling technologies and testbeds
    In this section, we present an overview of enabling technologies which facilitate
    IOUT developments for system-wide and communication-specific challenges. 6.1.
    Academic IOUT systems IOUTs can be used to ascertain the amount of water and fertilizer
    to be applied using an irrigation control system. An IOUT testbed has been deployed
    on the South Central Agricultural Lab (SCAL) in Clay Center, Nebraska [86]. The
    testbed covers a 41 acres of research field where an advanced center pivot irrigation
    system was installed in 2005 to research long-term dynamics of variable rate irrigation
    and fertigation, crop water and nutrient uptake, water stress and yield relationships,
    develop crop production functions, and associated numerous topics under full and
    limited irrigation and rainfed settings [100]. In this testbed, a mobile sink
    is installed on one of the controller towers of the center pivot irrigation system
    [86]. The current configuration includes two antennas facing opposite directions
    allowing the reception of data from nodes at a distance of 150  m–200  m. A solar
    panel provides sustainable energy in the field. 10–16 buried UTs are deployed
    in the field. Each UT is capable of measuring soil temperature and soil moisture
    from four external sensors buried at depths of 1, 2, 3, and 4  ft. UTs are powered
    by lithium-ion batteries and protected by a watertight enclosure. The spatio-temporal
    real-time information from UT is fused at the mobile sink and sent to the cloud
    using 4G communications. The cloud communicates with the center pivot controller
    for automated irrigation control. This field testbed is fully functional system
    developed to investigate IOUT sensing and communications capabilities in an agriculture
    field using center pivot irrigation, sensors, aboveground and underground communication
    devices. An indoor testbed has been designed and developed inside the greenhouse
    which supports dynamic soil moisture control for wireless underground communication
    experiments [133]. The testbed is made of 100  in. long, 36  in. wide and 48  in.
    high wooden box with drainage system to hold 90 cubic feet of packed soil (Fig.
    5). Antennas are buried at different depths and distances for controlled wireless
    communication experiments. Download : Download high-res image (203KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 5. The indoor testbed [133]. Moreover, a testbed
    based on magnetic induction (MI) underground communications has been developed
    in [143]. This testbed includes coils buried in the underground in lab settings.
    MI wave guide effects and 3-D coils are investigated using this testbed in different
    soil configurations. SoilBED [89], is another underground testbed developed for
    cross-well radar experiments in soil. It is used for investigation of EM wave
    propagation and for detection of presence of contaminated materials in soil. SoilBED
    can also be used for underground channel and antenna characterization, and empirical
    validations of underground communication channel models. Thoreau [161] is an IOUT
    testbed on an university campus that collects and curates time and geo-tagged
    data on an open platform on the cloud. It is based on Sigfox design and operates
    in the 900  MHz unlicensed bands with frequency hopped and narrow-band operation.
    It has very low data rates and soil properties including soil temperature, soil
    moisture, electric conductivity, and water potential are measured. Another precision
    agriculture testbed has been developed for real-time sensing in the field [79].
    It is used to sense related soil properties for real-time decision making. BioSense
    [4] Institute is an R&D institute for IT in biosystems. To achieve their vision
    on the future of agriculture and food production, BioSense works on the areas
    of machinery auto-steering and automation, EC probe & XRF scanner, electrical
    conductivity map, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) map, yield map,
    remote sensing, nano and micro-electronic sensors, big data, and Internet of things
    aimed to food production. BioSense Institute, supported by University of Novi
    Sad, Serbia, focuses on the design development of advanced ICT solutions in agriculture,
    food, ecology, environmental protection, and forestry. Research results of BioSense
    Institute are helping European countries and regions to improve agricultural and
    environmental standards. It is also working in nano and microelectronics, communications
    and signal processing, remote sensing and GIS, robotics and mechatronics, knowledge
    discovery, and BIO-related research fields such as agriculture, ecology, environmental
    sciences, and forestry. It consists of many researchers from various fields labs
    from Europe. Their solution for Big Data is AgroSense [3], an agricultural platform
    which store and present information to farmers, agri-companies, government, banks,
    and insurance companies aimed toward improving crop yield while reducing costs.
    Internet of Food and Farm (IoF2020) [22] is an European project that has 19 use
    cases in 5 agri-food production sectors: arables, fruits, vegetables, dairy, and
    meat. An example in arable is the combination of data from sensor networks for
    smart wheat management with crop models and other data sources (e.g., disease,
    crop stage detection, cultivar characterization from phenotyping, and others)
    to generate high spatial-temporal resolution and to develop new models. In fruits,
    a fresh table grapes chain project uses information from weather station and wired
    sensor (soil moisture, soil temperature, electrical conductivity, and leaf wetness)
    for disease forecasting and to control irrigation using flow meters and solenoid
    valves. Solar powered data loggers transmit the data using GPRS network. A case
    study in vegetable is the tracking of greenhouse tomato-crops chain by setting
    the optimum ambient conditions to reduce the usage of resources (e.g., pesticide
    application could be avoided completely) and increase energy efficiency. In dairy,
    15 grazing cows are tracked on the pasture and inside the dairy barn using three
    beacons. A case in meat is the tracking of pigs using RFID tags, which reduces
    boar taint, health problems, and improve productivity. Sensor are also used for
    climate monitoring, register weight gain, feeding and drinking patterns, and food
    and water consumption. A ZigBee based IOUT has been developed in [158] with application
    in precision agriculture. Related soil properties such as humidity and pH are
    sensed using this architecture. An IOUT for soil moisture sensing at multiple
    depths has been developed in [125]. It consists of wireless communications nodes,
    sensors, data transfer gateways, and web modules for real time sensing, communication,
    and visualization in the field. An IOUT testbed for snow and soil moisture monitoring
    has been developed in Sierra Nevada, California [103] . With 300 sensors spanning
    over an area of multiple kilometers, this IOUT sensing testbed is used to record
    measurements of soil water content, snow depth, matric potential, and other related
    parameters; and a detailed sensing, and communication performance analysis data
    is also reported. A summary of the existing academic architectures is provided

    products, OTA wireless communication is utilized, where the UT includes a variety
    of high-end sensors that measure properties like soil moisture, temperature, and
    electrical conductivity. Consequently, measurements generally represent a single
    point in the field. UT’s can interconnect to create a communication mesh, but
    in most cases, they are connected directly to a tower in the field with cellular
    or satellite communication capabilities. If the UT is not buried underground,
    redeployment of the equipment is needed after planting and before harvesting in
    each growing season to avoid damages to the equipment by the farming machinery.
    A classification of the commercial IOUT solutions, companies, and their products
    are presented in Fig. 6. Modularity in the design of IOUT devices is highly desirable
    as the requirements can change over time and are tailored for a specific application.
    For example, the transmission range influence the selection of a protocol and
    the transceiver that can meet the communication demands. Solutions could be customized
    for a specific application and ordered as a complete solution, so they will work
    out-of-the box. There are companies that specialize in agricultural solutions.
    In other cases, the architecture is required to be more specific and fast prototyping
    using OEM components is more appropriate. Once data is collected, end-users need
    networks to transmit the data, servers for storage and processing, and cloud-based
    applications to display the information. A summary of the commercial solutions
    is provided in Table 2. Major classes of the commercial solutions are highlighted
    in the following. • Agricultural solutions.John Deere’s Field Connect uses 3G
    connections to transmit information from eight sensor probes located a mile away
    (three if satellite communication is used) that measure soil moisture at various
    depth, temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, rain, and leaf wetness.
    MimosaTEK provides irrigation and fertigation solutions scaled to small, medium,
    and large farms [31]. TempuTech [55] provide wireless solutions to monitor temperature
    and humidity in grain elevators. Microsoft is developing FarmBeats which is an
    AI & IoT based platform for Agriculture [13]. These commercial agricultural solutions
    provide full support in precision agriculture including sensing, communications,
    and the cloud. • Out-of-the-box packages.Smartrek Technologies develops wireless
    nodes for different types of sensors and gateways that can be set up easily into
    a network mesh [47]. Nodes are protected by weatherproof enclosures which is a
    requirement for farm outdoor setting. Accessible ports allows the installation
    of third-party soil moisture sensors and weather detection. Libelium has developed
    a Plug & Sense Smart Agriculture solution [37] for temperature and humidity sensing,
    rainfall, wind speed and direction, atmospheric pressure, soil water content,
    and leaf wetness. Libelium provides platforms and end-user devices that encompass
    communications standards such as LoRaWAN, LoRa, Sigfox, sub GHz, ZigBee, DigiMesh,
    WiFi, RFID, NFC, Bluetooth/BLE, 3G, 4G, and GPRS. Sensor boards can be connected
    to their Waspmote platform to attach 120 different sensors. Libelium also hosts
    an IoT marketplace and provides cloud services to manage IoT devices and online
    programming. Cropx’s [8] IOUT consists of hardware and software components used
    to measure soil moisture, temperature, and EC for real time irrigation decision
    making. PrecisionHawk has developed an IOUT platform [39] using drones, which
    is used for sensing and field map generation. It supports visual imaging, thermal
    and multi-spectral imaging for field map generation in precision agriculture.
    These out-of-the-box packages are important component of the precision agriculture
    to support different types of applications. • OEM components.OEM components are
    commonly used in the manufacturing of nodes at a large scale. However, the prototyping
    or small scale production of very specific UT will also required the selection
    of OEM devices. ST [51] develops internal components for IoT devices like accelerometers,
    gyroscope, and MEMS microphones. Semtech Corporation is a supplier of high-performance
    semiconductors and advanced algorithms [41]. U-blox specialized in communication
    and positioning components for IoT devices [59]. Telit is an M2M solutions company
    with focus in IoT development [54]. Telit provides tailored hardware and software
    solutions in small size modules. Products can transmit data using cellular, Bluetooth/BLE,
    LoRa, Low Power Wide Area (LPWA), Positioning, SigFox, Sub GHz, Wi-Fi, and M-Bus
    wireless technology. Herelab provides proof of concept deployment and rapid prototyping
    service of IoT custom platforms [16]. For instance, in agriculture, sensor interfaces
    can be rapidly attached to a template, and the corresponding instructions can
    be adapted from the code library. Herelab also organizes labs and workshop to
    introduce new tools and promote the usage of IoT devices. These components serve
    as useful building blocks of IOUT sensing and communications paradigm. • Cloud-based
    services.Cloud service allows worldwide access to the information collected by
    IOUT devices without any previous web programming knowledge. Farmers and other
    professionals do not need to spend time to hire another party in order to configure
    a server to make use of the data collected; and can take decision right away.
    LORIoT provides cloud services on a geographical distributed low latency network
    of servers where users connect their LoRaWan gateways. Among the web services
    they offer are the management of devices, cloud storage of data, safeguard of
    encryption keys, and LoRaWan to IP/IPv6 translation [30]. MyDevices offers IoT
    developers services to promote their solutions. One attractive feature of MyDevices
    is that it offers Cayenne, a drag-and-drop IoT project builder. End-users can
    create an account and use Cayenne web and mobile applications to register their
    IoT devices and instantly display sensed data on a fully customizable dashboard

    for IoT (MNSi) and Low Power Wide Area Virtual Network (LVN), that provide secure,
    efficient, and scalable connectivity to low-powered devices [42]. A proprietary
    network operating system handles end-devices messages and LoRaWAN gateways, generation
    of keys for encryption, decryption of messages, and hosting the portal for device
    management, among other activities. Device Lynk offers an online dashboard for
    data visualization of data captured using IoT industrial devices [9]. IntelliFarms
    provides diverse agricultural solutions such as reporting weather conditions,
    providing market crop pricing, and monitoring storage conditions in silos and
    bins. It also host the IntelliFarms platform where customer can get access to
    all their solutions in a centralized fashion [21]. 365FarmNet platform [1] is
    an agricultural data management service that is currently offering free field

    challenges Challenges in design and implementation of a precision agriculture
    based IOUT are highlighted in this section. 1. Due to large area of deployment
    in agricultural fields, low cost and low complexity IOUT devices are desirable
    with ability to sustain rough terrains in all type of soil moisture regimes. 2.
    Improving UTs with more complex functionalities will lead to higher energy consumption
    and faster battery depletion. Thus, improvements in energy efficient operation,
    sustainable energy sources, and energy harvesting are major challenges. 3. Due
    to availability of different types of SM sensors, their integration with communication
    equipment is a major challenge. A standard protocol is required for seamless integration
    of different types of sensors to the communication devices in IOUT. 4. Low-cost
    and multi-modal soil sensors that can sense soil physical properties in addition
    to moisture are required. While moisture provides valuable information for irrigation
    decisions, soil chemicals need to be sensed in-situ for variable rate fertigation
    applications. 5. Advanced security mechanisms are required to protect information
    transfer in the fields. Moreover, field-based privacy solutions are required such
    that information from multiple fields can be fused for more accurate decisions
    while preserving the privacy of growers. 6. Seasonal changes and crop growth cycles
    need to be considered as they temporarily alter the conditions in which the equipment
    typically works. Freezing temperature affects power consumption, but equipment
    can be set to deep sleep as monitoring might not be necessary. The beginning of
    the growing season or a crop rotation can introduce heavier equipment on the field
    and UTs need to be buried deep enough to avoid damages. 7. Due to dynamic changes
    in the communication medium in soil, UTs should be able to autonomously adjust
    their operation parameters such as operation frequency, modulation schemes, error
    coding schemes for adaptive operation. Due to the close interactions with soil,
    these solutions should be tailored to UG communications instead of adopting existing
    OTA solutions [86], [129], [130], [131], [133]. Impacts of soil physical properties,
    soil moisture on UG communication should be modeled. A detailed insight into these
    effects will help to realize a reliable, scalable IOUT architecture. 8. Impacts
    of soil physical properties, soil moisture on UG communication should be modeled.
    A detailed insight into these effects will help to realize a reliable, scalable
    IOUT architecture. 9. Specialized link-layer and network layers protocols are
    needed for UG communications for scalable, reliable, and robust data transfer
    in IOUT. 8. Conclusions We introduced the Internet of Underground Things (IOUT)
    for real-time decision making in agricultural fields. A complete architectures
    for precision agriculture based IOUT has been presented. It has been shown that
    the sensing and communications are the main component of the IOUT. A detailed
    overview of sensing and communication technologies including academic and commercial
    solutions is presented. In-field communications (UG, LPWAN, LAN, cellular) and
    cloud are discussed in detail. Challenges to the realization of IOUT are highlighted,
    and testbed designs for IOUT realization are presented. Recent advances in the
    theory and applications of wireless UG communication are also reported. Acknowledgments

    will create a huge network of billions or trillions of “Things” communicating
    with one another, are facing many technical and application challenges. This paper
    introduces the status of IoT development in China, including policies, R&D plans,
    applications, and standardization. With China''s perspective, this paper depicts
    such challenges on technologies, applications, and standardization, and also proposes
    an open and general IoT architecture consisting of three platforms to meet the
    architecture challenge. Finally, this paper discusses the opportunity and prospect
    of IoT. Published in: IEEE Internet of Things Journal ( Volume: 1, Issue: 4, August

    10.1109/JIOT.2014.2337336 Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction
    The Internet of Things (IoT) is regarded as a technology and economic wave in
    the global information industry after the Internet. The IoT is an intelligent
    network which connects all things to the Internet for the purpose of exchanging
    information and communicating through the information sensing devices in accordance
    with agreed protocols. It achieves the goal of intelligent identifying, locating,
    tracking, monitoring, and managing things [1]. It is an extension and expansion
    of Internet-based network, which expands the communication from human and human
    to human and things or things and things. In the IoT paradigm, many objects surrounding
    us will be connected into networks in one form or another. RF identification (RFID),
    sensor technology, and other smart technologies will be embedded into a variety
    of applications. As a burgeoning thing, there is not a common accepted definition
    on IoT. Specialists from different perspectives and organizations describe IoT
    on diverse preference. Typical definitions of IoT from different organizations
    are shown in Table I. Following technology evolutions, more and more computing
    power, storage, and battery capacities become available at relatively low cost
    and low size. This trend is enabling the development of extreme small-scale electronic
    devices with identification/communication/computing capabilities, which could
    be embedded in other devices, systems, and facilities [1]. IoT should have the
    following three characteristics [6]. Comprehensive Perception: Using RFID, sensors,
    and two-dimensional barcode to obtain the object information at anytime and anywhere,
    it will be a new opportunity. Using it, information and communication systems
    can be invisibly embedded in the environment around us. Sensor network will enable
    people to interact with the real world remotely. Identification technologies mentioned
    here include objects and location identifications. Identification and recognition
    of the physical world is the foundation of implementing overall perception. Reliable
    Transmission: Through a variety of available radio networks, telecommunication
    networks, and Internet, objects information can be available in any time. Communication
    technology here includes a variety of wired and wireless transmission technologies,
    switching technologies, networking technologies, and gateway technologies. IoT
    further creates the interaction among the physical world, the virtual world, the
    digital world, and the society. Machine to machine (M2M), furthermore, is the
    key implementation technology of the Network of Things, which represents the connections
    and communications between M2M and Human to Machine including Mobile to Machine.
    Intelligent Processing: By collecting IoT data into databases, various intelligent
    computing technologies including cloud computing will be able to support IoT data
    applications. The network service providers can process tens of millions or even
    billion pieces of messages instantly through cloud computing. Cloud computing
    technology will thus be the promoter of IoT. Currently, in China, there are at
    least 9 billion interconnected devices, and it is expected to reach 24 billion
    devices by 2020. According to the GSMA, this amount to $1.3 trillion revenue opportunities
    for mobile network operators alone spanning segments such as health, automotive,
    utilities, and consumer electronics. Many countries consider IoT as strategic
    industries and a new economic growth engine in the future. European Union (EU)
    has invested more than 100 million Euros in a series of projects through Seventh
    EU Framework Programme (FP7 for R&D), and these projects will be actively deployed
    in smart grid, intelligent transportation, smart cities, etc. South Korea invested
    27.8 million U.S. dollars in IoT fundamental technology development, IoT test
    bed advancement, and IoT standardization, etc. China is speeding up the development
    of IoT and defines it as a new engine for economic growth. The government released
    the 12th Five-Year Plan for IoT development. This plan is an outline program for
    developing IoT from 2011 to 2015. The plan gave the goal and objectives of future
    development, and the plan proposed several approaches reaching the goal. The plan
    also puts forward a list of methods to support and promote the development of
    IoT\break industry. This paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces
    opportunities of IoT and summarizes its status and applications. Section III introduces
    the policy, R&D plans, and standardization of IoT in China. Based on the introduction
    of Sections II and III, in Section IV, the major problem hampering the development
    of IoT is analyzed, i.e., lack of interoperability among diverse IoT solutions.
    A general open IoT architecture developed in China is given. Section V introduces
    main application fields, examples of typical public applications, and examples
    of industry applications of IoT in China. Section VI analyzes further challenges
    on IoT, including technical challenge and standard challenge, and introduces the
    prospect of IoT. Section VII is the conclusion of this paper. SECTION II. Opportunity,
    Status, and Capability of IoT A. Opportunity of IoT The IoT will create a huge
    network of billions or trillions of “Things” communicating each other. The IoT
    is not subversive revolution over the existing technologies, it is comprehensive
    utilizations of existing technologies, and it is the creation of the new communication
    modes. The IoT blends the virtual world and the physical world by bringing different
    concepts and technical components together: pervasive networks, miniaturization
    of devices, mobile communication, and new ecosystem. In IoT, applications, services,
    middleware components, networks, and end nodes will be structurally organized
    and used in entire new ways. IoT offers a means to look into complex processes
    and relationships. The IoT implies a symbiotic interaction between the real/physical
    and the digital/virtual worlds: physical entities have digital counterparts and
    virtual representation; things become context aware and they can sense, communicate,
    interact, and exchange data, information, and knowledge. New opportunities will
    meet business requirements, and new services will be created based on real-time
    physical world data. Everything from the physical or virtual world will possibly
    be connected by the IoT. Connectivity between the things shall be available to
    all with low cost and may not be owned by private entities. For IoT, intelligent
    learning, fast deployment, best information understanding and interpreting, against
    fraud and malicious attack, and privacy protection are essential requirements.
    B. Status of IoT The IoT can be regarded as an extension of existing interaction
    between people and applications through a new dimension of “Things” for communication
    and integration. The IoT development process is a complex large-scale technological
    innovation process. The IoT is evolving from the vertical application to polymeric
    application. At the early stage of IoT deployment, driving of domain-specific
    applications is the main development strategy. A domain-specific application might
    be a manufacturing control system with its own industry characteristics. The application
    can provide various enterprise management services being integrated with the industry
    production and business processes. Polymeric applications are cross-industry applications
    based on public information service platforms. These applications support both
    home users and industry users. The application are provided and promoted by communication
    operators and solution providers with large scale. For example, a vehicle integrated
    with sensor networks, a global positioning system (GPS), and radio communication
    technology can provide comprehensive detection, navigation, entertainment, and
    other information services. By maintaining such information through the public
    service platform, consumers, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), maintenance
    providers, and vehicle management agencies can share these~information and share
    services to improve the vehicle, the vehicle component design, and the fabrication
    process through the vehicle lifecycle management. C. Capability of the IoT Application
    In summary, the IoT applications shall have the following capabilities. 1) Location
    Sensing and Sharing of Location Info The IoT system can collect the location information
    of IoT terminals and end nodes, and then provide services based on the collected
    location information. The location information includes geographical position
    information got from the GPS, Cell-ID, RFID, etc., and absolute or relative position
    information between things. More typical IoT applications include at least the
    following. a) Mobile asset tracking This application can track and monitor the
    status of commodity using the position-sensing device and communication function
    installed on the commodity. b) Fleet management The manger of the fleet can schedule
    the vehicles and drivers based on the business requirements and the real-time
    position information collected by the vehicles. c) Fleet management Traffic information
    system: This application can get traffic information such as road traffic conditions
    and congested locations by tracking the location information of a large number
    of vehicles. The system thus assists the driver to choose the most efficient route.
    2) Environment Sensing The IoT system can collect and process all kinds of physical
    or chemical environmental \nobreak parameters via the locally or widely deployed
    terminals. Typical environmental information includes temperature, humidity, noise,
    visibility, light intensity, spectrum, radiation, pollution (CO, CO2, etc.), images,
    and body indicators. Typical applications include at least the following. a) Environment
    detection IoT systems offer environmental and ecological, such as forest and glacier,
    monitoring; disaster, such as volcanoes and seismic, monitoring; and factory monitoring.
    All are with automatic alarm systems using environmental parameters collected
    by large number of sensors. b) Remote medical monitoring IoT can analyze the recurring
    indicator data collected from the device placed on patients’ body and provide
    the users with health trends and health advice. 3) Remote Controlling IoT systems
    can control IoT terminals and execute functions based on application commands
    combined with information collected from things and service requirements. a) Appliance
    control People can remotely control operating status of appliances through IoT
    system. b) Disaster recovery Users can remotely start disasters treatment facilities
    to minimize losses caused by disasters according to the monitoring mentioned before.
    4) Ad Hoc Networking IoT system shall have rapidly self-organized networking capability
    and can interoperate with the network/service layer to provide related services
    [7]. In the vehicle network, in order to transfer the data, the network between
    vehicles and/or road infrastructures can be rapidly self-organized. 5) Secure
    Communication IoT system can further establish secure data transmission channel
    between the application or service platform and IoT terminals based on service
    requirements. In practice, an IoT application consists of different types of capabilities
    and even applications based on the service requirement. Table II shows examples
    of different IoT applications. TABLE I Definitions of the IoT From Different Organizations
    TABLE II Summary of IoT Applications SECTION III. IoT in China A. China Pushes
    Development of IoT The IoT sensing network research started in China in 1999.
    IoT was positioned as one of the strategic emerging industries and written into
    the government work report in March 2010. The state council’s decision on speeding
    up the incubation and development of strategic emerging industries, which was
    promulgated in November 2010, clearly stated that the IoT research and application
    demonstrations will be promoted. In 2012, the Ministry of Industry and Information
    of China explained the national 12th Five-Year Plan including IoT development
    (2011–2015) [8]. It was the first plan that China government released the development
    of IoT in detail. The plan clearly proposed the development goal of the IoT during
    the period of 2011–2015. By 2015, there should be significant achievements of
    IoT essential technologies, related applications, and standardizations. The plan
    put forward eight main tasks and clearly clarified five key projects, including
    the Key Technology Innovation Project, Standardization acceleration Project, “10
    Industrial sectors \& 100 New Enterprises” Industry Development Pioneering Project,
    Application Demonstration Projects in Key Sectors, and Public Service Platform
    Construction Project. In order to solve the popped-up problems and consider long-term
    development of IoT, the State Council issued the “guidance on tracking and ordering
    for promoting the development of IoT” [9] that determined the development goals
    and threads for IoT in February 2013. The 14 ministries of China established a
    joint meeting for IoT development in September 2013, and organized Expert Advisory
    Committee on the IoT development. The 10 Special Development Action Plans for
    IoT [10], including: 1) top-layer design; 2) standards development; 3) technology
    development; 4) application promotion; 5) industry support; 6) business models;
    7) security; 8) government support; 9) laws and regulations guarantee; and 10)
    personnel training, was issued by the joint meeting. As a part of the Action Plans,
    the strategic alliance for industrial technology innovations of IoT was established
    in October 2013 [11]. Fig. 1 shows the summary of the Special Development Packet
    Plans. Fig. 1. Summary of the Special Action Plans. Show All B. R&D Plans In China,
    the central government established the special funds for demonstration projects
    and research projects to support the development of IoT. In 2011, for supporting
    the development of IoT in China, around RMB 500 million special IoT fund was invested
    into IoT-related fields, 2/3 of the funds were put into R&D and applications;
    this fund has supported 381 related companies since 2011. China government has
    supported 22 National major IoT application demonstration projects since 2011,
    and an announcement was issued by China National Development and Reform Commission
    in October 2013. It was about organizing and carrying out the national IoT pilot
    major application demonstration projects during 2014–2016 in special regions.
    In Research and Development area, the China Ministry of Industry and Information
    Technology had set up a number of key technical research projects on architectures
    and applications such as intelligent transport system (ITS) and e-health under
    the packet of “a new generation of mobile broadband project.” China Ministry of
    Science and Technology also set up a series of fundamental researches for IoT
    on architecture, fundamental theory and design, etc., under the 973 project framework
    (National Key Fundamental Research and Development Plan). The national level IoT
    R&D is distributed as: the enterprises such as operators and vendors provide the
    operation and system development of IoT. Universities and research institutions
    focus on the key technology research, and the standard organizations are responsible
    for the standardization of IoT. At present, IoT-related industry has basically
    formed, and mainly distributed over the Bohai bay area, the Yangtze River Delta
    zoon, the Pearl River Delta zoon, and the central and western regions. Fig. 2
    shows the summary of national R&D plans in IoT. Fig. 2. Summary of National R&D
    plans in IoT in China. Show All C. Standardization The IoT standard system contains
    the architecture standards, the application requirements standards, the communication
    protocol standards, the identification standards, the security standards, the
    application standards, the data standards, the information processing standards,
    and the public service platform standards. The proposed IoT standard set is relatively
    complicated. In China, the standardization efforts started at 2010. The main standard
    organizations for IoT in China are China Communications Standards Association
    (CCSA), China Standardization Working Group on Sensor Networks (WGSN), electric
    tag standards technical committee, etc. These standard organizations are leading
    the standardization process of China IoT. As part of the Special IoT Action Plans,
    actions for the standardization of IoT include to build a standard system, to
    develop common standards, key technical standards, and urgent industry standards,
    to actively participate in the international standardization processes, to conduct
    standard validations and services, to improve the organizational structure. In
    the course of standardization, many research institutions and enterprises in China
    have also been participating in international standardization work in M2M of International
    Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC),
    ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T), 3rd Generation Partnership
    Project (3GPP). China is one of the leading countries in ITU-T and ISO Wireless
    Sensor Network (WSN) Working Group. CCSA is one of the sponsoring organizations
    of the One M2M, and many enterprises are deeply participating in the MTC-related
    standard development in 3GPP. SECTION IV. Open and General IoT Architecture A.
    Motivation and General Description As seen in the previous introduction to the
    current IoT, most IoT applications in China were domain-specific or application-specific
    solutions. The architectures of these IoT systems are fragmented and cannot correlate
    and integrate the data from different silos; these isolated IoT solutions use
    private protocols and cause much problems in information sharing, technology multiplexing,
    network managements, and upgrading. All these problems are hindering the development
    of IoT. In order to reduce the total IoT cost and share information, we need to
    integrate multiple functions and resources into a larger system. IoT thus needs
    to be designed with an open and generic IoT architecture with open interfaces
    and resources, considering different business scenarios, application-based requirements,
    and current technologies [12]. We have thus seen the motivation to formulate a
    standard for IoT integration in order to reduce the total cost of money and time
    from devices, developments, and deployments. An open and generic IoT architecture
    is an integrated solution with interoperability [13], [14]. It will have the following
    characteristics. 1) Standard Interface and Protocol By comparing various private
    IoT systems, a generic IoT infrastructure has the same hardware and software interfaces,
    and protocols. 2) Public and Operating A general IoT architecture is deployed
    to take over public IoT applications with open-operating capability. A public
    IoT system can thus integrate multiple IoT applications into one architecture.
    3) Open, Scalable, and Flexible An open IoT architecture with open resources,
    open standards, and open interfaces can easily extend its functionality and the
    scale of performance. It can thus adapt to different requirements including technical
    developments flexibly. B. Open and General IoT Architecture China Communications
    Standards Association (CCSA) proposed a reference model for the IoT, which consists
    of sensing layer, network and business layers, and application layer. Complying
    with this reference model, Fig. 3 shows its open and general architecture, which
    is layered, open, and flexible. The architecture includes three functional platforms
    as follows. Fig. 3. CCSA proposed open and general architecture of IoT. Show All
    1) Sensing and Gateway Platform This platform connects sensors, controllers, RFID
    readers, and location sensing device (e.g., GPS) to IoT network layer. Modularization
    of hardware, data format, and software interface is proposed for IoT terminal,
    IoT Gateway, and tip node. IoT terminal, IoT gateway, and tip node can include
    flexible modules combined with control module, common interface module, and communication
    module. Common interface module collects physical interfaces of various sensors
    into a common interface. Common control module can connect sensors, controllers,
    GPS, and RFID readers with a common connection protocol. The software and application
    parameters of an IoT terminal and IoT gateway should be able to self-configure
    and self-adapt. Modularization, common interface, intelligent operation, self-adaption,
    and self-configuration are important characteristics of this platform. 2) Resource
    and Administration Platform Network and service layer includes backbone networks
    and resource administration platforms. The backbone network includes 3G, 4G, internet,
    optical fiber network, Ethernet network, satellite networks, and private network.
    The resource and administration platform provides common capabilities which can
    be used by different IoT applications, such as data processing, data storage,
    security management, and application supporting. These capabilities may also be
    invoked by specific IoT application support capabilities, e.g., to build other
    specific IoT application support capabilities. This platform also provides relevant
    control functions of network connectivity, such as access and transport resource
    control functions, mobility management, or authentication, authorization, and
    accounting for IoT terminals, services, applications, users, and developers. 3)
    Open Application Platform Modularization design in this application platform provides
    common function and open application programming interface (API). An IoT application
    provider can develop its application using these APIs. Meanwhile, this platform
    supports application managements. Various applications can be published to the
    application platform and users can get application information and subscribe applications
    through this platform. Convenient and easy deployment, distribution, and flexible
    application environment are the characteristics of this platform. SECTION V. Typical
    Applications and Deployment in China A. Main Application Fields In China, IoT
    applications will be developed in nine fields, including: 1) domain industry applications;
    2) smart agriculture; 3) smart logistics; 4) intelligent transportation; 5) smart
    grid; 6) smart environmental protection; 7) smart safety; 8) smart medical care;
    and 9) smart home, as shown in Table III. TABLE III Main Application Fields in
    China Three major operators: 1) China mobile; 2) China Telecom; and 3) China Unicom
    had announced their IoT development plans. The IoT has been an important part
    in the strategies of Chinese telecom operators. China mobile plans to implement
    a centralized platform [China mobile IoT operation supporting platform (CMITS)],
    and the branch for IoT was established in Chongqing in 2012. China Telecom plans
    to further enrich IoT services based on key industry requirements, to build an
    open platform for cooperation, and to promote IoT business model innovation. The
    branch for IoT was established in Wuxi in 2014. China Unicom plans to build a
    management and control platform and an operation supporting system for IoT. They
    also planned to offer specific hardware communication modules. The government
    planned to provide special phone numbers (1064xxxxxxxxx with billions of identities)
    dedicated for M2M. Table IV shows IoT development plans and actions from three
    major operators. TABLE IV IoT Developments From Three Major Operators B. Deployment
    of Typical Applications 1) Smart City Smart city is a new development model of
    a city using new technologies, such as IoT, cloud computing, and big data analytics,
    to boost the information sharing and coordination within a city system. IoT is
    important means and tools of building smart city, and it is infrastructure-carrying
    smart city construction. Smart city construction depends on a lot of IoT applications
    for different industries [15], [16]. Smart city development plans are divided
    into three stages: 1) the stage for initial infrastructure construction; 2) the
    stage for data-processing facility construction; and 3) the stage for end-phase
    service platform construction. A large number of smart city projects provide huge
    opportunities for telecom OEM, systems integration enterprises, data aggregation
    and analysis/service enterprises, and telecom operators. In China, some cities
    are focusing on improving infrastructure for smart cities programs, and on developing
    regional smart e-commerce and logistics, while other cities are stepping up efforts
    to improve the management of local utilities. According to estimation, the smart
    city market will have a total value of more than RMB 2 Trillion during the 12th
    Five-Year Plan period (2011–2015). 2) Intelligent Transportation China needs a
    solution to solve the problems of increased amount of traffic congestion in urban
    areas using new technologies such as IoT. The Ministry of Transport in China has
    announced a plan that the development of ITS will be installed and in-use across
    the country by 2020. In the next 10 years, the government will invest about RMB
    4 Trillion in intelligent transportation. Intelligent Transportation System in
    China is developing and keeping a high growth rate. The growing speed of China’s
    urban intelligent transportation control system market is high, including electronic
    police, intelligent traffic signal control, traffic video monitoring, intelligent
    Taxi service management, urban public transport information technology, and ETC.
    Until the completion of the 12th Five-Year Plan, 60% of national highways in China
    will have ETC. The installation of IoT infrastructures in ITS of smart cities
    will be supporting fundamental technologies. Connected vehicles and vehicular
    networks have been identified as a key technology for enhancing road safety and
    transport efficiency [17], [18]. In recent years, vehicular network infrastructure
    integration technology attracts a great amount of attentions; it also brings inestimable
    economic value, and will play an important role in the next generation of intelligent
    transportation systems and communication network development. Separately, built-in
    connectivity in vehicles is predicted to mandatory function for consumers in 2020,
    driven partly by the increasing global demand for availability of charging supply
    for electric vehicles. Government, University, automakers, and telecommunication
    vendors form alliances to develop this industry, such as China ITS Industry Alliance
    and Telematics Industry Application Alliance, to develop the connected vehicles
    industry. The related installation of IoT infrastructures of smart cities will
    be fundamental supporting technologies as well. C. Deployment of Typical Industry
    Applications 1) Intelligent Coal Mine In 2011, The State Administration of work
    safety and State Coal Mine Safety Supervision Bureau in China regulated that all
    coal mines in china must complete the construction of “Mine Six-Hedge Safety Systems”
    until the end of 2013. The Six-Hedge underground systems include: 1) general monitoring
    and controlling system; 2) personnel positioning system; 3) emergent shelter systems;
    4) oxygen provision monitoring system; 5) water supply and drainage monitoring
    system; and 6) mine cable and wireless communication system. All the six systems
    mentioned above are based on pervasive sensing, sensing data collection, real-time
    use of data, and deep data post analyses, which is actually based on IoT. The
    IoT can be widely used in the “six system.” For example, it uses sensors to monitor
    miner position and leak of hazard gases. Fig. 4 shows a typical underground IoT
    system. Fig. 4. IoT system structure for coal mine. Show All Built on underground
    industrial ring network and industrial field bus, the system is actually a comprehensive
    underground IoT platform, which transmits data of mining devices under industrial
    Ethernet protocols to dispatch center so as to monitor various devices and sensors
    inside the dispatch center. The overall design of the system consists of sensing
    and equipment layer, network and access layer, as well application and information
    management layer. The system collects real-time parameters of electromechanical
    devices and data of safety systems, which improves the system efficiency and safety.
    Finally, it highly guarantees the correct dispatching and decision-making of coal
    mines. 2) Intelligent Oil Field Intelligent oil field (IOF) consists of a distributed
    system, holding frequently captured data. The data are evaluated and acted upon
    real-time information. IOF brings lower operational costs, lower capital investment,
    and increased yield of oil and gas. Fig. 5 shows the IOF system based on the architecture
    mentioned in Section IV. It will collect parameters through its entire production
    process, such as sensing and monitoring parameters from oil well and gas well,
    metering house, oil station and gas station, and oil and gas pipe network. Sensed
    data will be collected and transmitted for further analysis between the service
    platform and gateway/terminal with a common connection protocol. Real-time production
    data and equipment condition information support the centralized management and
    control at production command center in production control center. IOF can increase
    the integrity, accuracy, timeliness, and standardization of the production decision-making
    for oil and gas fields. Fig. 5. IOF system. Show All The goal and objectives of
    the IOF system are to increase the accuracy and timeliness of product process,
    decision-making, improvement of the system management level, reducing the operation
    costs, and minimizing risk. As a subsystem in IOF, IoT system offers automatic
    production data collection, remote monitoring, and supporting for production prewarning
    by establishing a standardized general service platform, which covers all oil
    and gas wells and fields, metering house, collect and conveyance station, combination
    station, treatment plant. The platform also supports the process of production
    process management. SECTION VI. Challenge and Prospect of IoT IoT trends to be
    unified, seamless, and pervasive. Large-scale service deployment needs to be framed
    within a set of standards. However, IoT involves many manufacturers, spans multiple
    industries, and it differs widely in application scenarios and user requirements,
    which consequently gives impacts on large-scale commercial deployment of related
    services. The development of IoT is a step-by-step process. There are still many
    problems to be solved, such as low power nodes and computing, low cost and low
    latency communication, identification and positioning technologies, self-organized
    distributed systems technology, and distributed intelligence. A. Challenge of
    IoT The IoT provides many new opportunities to the industry and end user in many
    application fields. Currently, however, the IoT itself lacks theory, technology
    architecture, and standards that integrate the virtual world and the real physical
    world in a unified framework [19]. Following key challenges are thus listed. 1)
    Architecture Challenge IoT encompasses an extreme wide range of technologies.
    IoT involves an increasing number of smart interconnected devices and sensors
    (e.g., cameras, biometric, physical, and chemical sensors) that are often nonintrusive,
    transparent, and invisible. As the communications among these devices are expected
    to happen anytime, anywhere for any related services, generally, these communications
    are in a wireless, autonomic, and ad hoc manner. In addition, the services become
    much more mobile, decentralized, and complex. In IoT, data integrations over different
    environments are thus tough and will be supported by modular interoperable components.
    Infrastructure solutions will require systems to combine volumes of data from
    various sources and determine relevant features, to interpret data and show their
    relationships, to compare data to historical useful information, and support decision-making.
    Single reference architecture thus cannot be a blueprint for all applications.
    Heterogeneous reference architectures have to coexist in IoT. Architectures should
    be open, and following standards, they should not restrict users to use fixed,
    end-to-end solutions. IoT architectures should be flexible to cater for cases
    such as identification (RFID, tags), intelligent devices, and smart objects (hardware
    and software solutions). 2) Technical Challenge IoT technology can be complex
    for variety of reasons. First, there are legacy heterogeneous architectures in
    the existing networking technologies and applications, e.g., different applications
    and environments need different networking technologies, and the ranges as well
    as other characteristics of cellular, wireless local area network, and RFID technologies
    are much different from each other [20]. Second, communication technologies, including
    fixed and mobile communication systems, power line communications, wireless communication,
    and short-range wireless communication technologies, for both fixed and mobile
    devices, either simple or complicated, should be low cost and with reliable connectivity.
    At last, there are thousands of different applications; it is in natural to have
    different requirements on what parties need to communicate with each other, what
    kind of security solutions are appropriate, and so on. To summarize, complexity
    and alternative technologies may introduce problems; unnecessary competition and
    deployment barriers in markets may also introduce problems; systems and communication
    mechanisms with unnecessary dependencies may block the migration of IoT systems
    to the most economic and efficient platforms. All the above may block IoT to connect
    as many “Things” as possible. 3) Hardware Challenge Smart devices with enhanced
    inter-device communication will lead to smart systems with high degrees of intelligence.
    Its autonomy enables rapid deployment of IoT applications and creation of new
    services. Therefore, hardware researches are focusing on designing wireless identifiable
    systems with low size, low cost yet sufficient functionality. As the bandwidth
    of IoT terminals could vary from kbps to mbps from sensing simple value to video
    stream, requirements on hardware are diverging. However, two requirements have
    been nevertheless the essentials: one is the extremely low power consumption in
    sleep mode and the other is ultra low cost. Suppose the sleeping time over active
    time is one million, the leakage power of an IoT terminal shall at least be one
    million time less than that of active. It is so far impossible when an IoT terminal
    is sleeping and receiving RF signals. It will be even difficult when using advanced
    CMOS silicon with relatively more leakage power. Hardware and protocol codesign
    for sleeping has been thus the first hardware challenge of IoT. Billions of IoT
    terminals will be used; the cost of an IoT terminal must be ultra low. However,
    so far, there is no low cost positioning solution for IoT, especially the positioning
    precision of a short-range IoT terminal must be high. Low active power is also
    a challenge for low-cost terminal [21]. Traditionally, low cost equals to lower
    performance or longer process latency. Longer processing latency ends up to higher
    energy consumption. As the spectrum resource is very limited at the lower part
    in L band, IoT may use higher RF such as the frequency bands higher than 5 GHz.
    The higher the RF, the more power consumption from RF PA will be. In another way,
    not yet used very narrow spectrum band between two used bands may have to be used
    by future IoT. To use very narrow band with strong power neighbors, the cost of
    passive component will not be low and that will definitely be a potential challenge
    in the future. 4) Privacy and Security Challenge Compared with traditional networks,
    security and privacy issues of IoT become more prominent [22]. Much information
    includes privacy of users, so that protection of privacy becomes an important
    security issues in IoT. Because of the combinations of things, services, and networks,
    security of IoT needs to cover more management objects and levels than traditional
    network security. Existing security architecture is designed from the perspective
    of human communication, may not be suitable and directly applied to IoT system.
    Using existed security mechanisms will block logical relationship between things
    in IoT. IoT needs low-cost- and M2M-oriented technical solutions to guarantee
    the privacy and the security. In many use cases, the security of a system has
    been considered as a general feature. Related research shall focus on privacy
    control. Low cost, low latency, and energy-efficient cryptography algorithms and
    related flexible hardware will be essential for sensor or device. 5) Standard
    Challenge Standards play an important role in forming IoT. A standard is essential
    to allow all actors to equally access and use. Developments and coordination of
    standards and proposals will promote efficient development of IoT infrastructures
    and applications, services, and devices. In general, standards developed by cooperated
    multiparties, and information models and protocols in the standards, shall be
    open. The standard development process shall also be open to all participants,
    and the resulting standards shall be publicly and freely available. In today’s
    network world, global standards are typically more relevant than any local agreements.
    6) Business Challenge For a mature application, its business model and application
    scenario are clear and easy to be mapped into technical requirements. So the developers
    do not need to spend much time on business-related aspects. But for IoT, there
    are too many possibilities and uncertainties in business models and application
    scenarios. It is thus inefficient in terms of business-technology alignment, and
    one solution will not fit possibilities for all. The IoT is a challenging traditional
    business model. Although small-scale applications have been profitable in some
    industries, it is unsustainable when extended to other industries. In the early
    stage of IoT development, business aspects should be considered to reduce the
    risk of failure. B. Prospect of IoT With the development and maturity of distributed
    intelligent information processing technologies, IoT systems will make intelligent
    sensing widely available through information sharing and collaboration. The gradual
    establishment and improvement of the standards system will inevitably bring IoT
    into our daily life. The IoT creates an opportunity for the web-based services,
    thus enhancing the commercial and social potential future of IoT [23]. The development
    of IoT keeps going forward along scale, collaborative, and intelligent. Promoted
    by technology, standardization, and application experiences, IoT applications
    will expand the scale in the different industries, and more enterprises will be
    attracted to come in. 1) Interoperability Information interoperability will take
    place among different things, different enterprises, different industries, and
    different regions or countries; application models will change from closed to
    open and the globalization of IoT application system serving different industries
    and fields will be constructed. Interoperability is the essential issue for crossing
    layers of physical, device, communication (protocol and spectrum utility), function
    and application. These levels traditionally are built with different languages
    and protocols. Level and domain transparent languages and protocols are, therefore,
    needed. A holistic approach is required in addressing and solving the interoperability
    of IoT devices and services at several layers. 2) Intelligent System The IoT will
    bring seamless business and social networking over fast reliable and secure networks
    into our society. System intelligence will be important for the development of
    IoT and the key point will be context awareness and inter-things information exchange.
    Therefore, increasing and adapting the intelligence at the device level will be
    a focus of research, such as the integration of sensors and actuators, high efficiency,
    multistandard and adaptive communication subsystems, and adaptable antennae. Intelligences
    can be introduced using micro control unit (MCU) on upper layers. However, physical
    layer so far has been far behind the required intelligent level, for example,
    to adapt IoT devices under different radio infrastructures. Four parts in physical
    layer must be further developed to adapt to and/or to form an intelligent IoT
    device, which are as follows. Programmable baseband processor will be used to
    adapt to different modulation algorithms, different error correction algorithms,
    different channel bandwidths, and different channel scenarios. Software-controlled
    RF will be essential for transceiver to adapt to the local radio frequency requirements.
    Fully digital RF PA will be the indispensable device to consume less low power
    and offer programmability for PA to adapt radio transmission requirements. Finally,
    controllable integrated passive components will be an essential glue to connect
    intelligent semiconductor components into a sensor node with low cost, low size,
    and low power. 3) Energy Sustainability In the future, energy-efficient and self-sustainable
    systems will be key enhancing issues to the IoT. The ways to harvest energy from
    environments must be developed. Efficiency in processing and communication must
    also be increased through new circuits, new programming paradigms, and the further
    development of energy-efficient protocols and smart antennae. The development
    of new, efficient, and compact batteries, fuel cells, as well as new energy generation
    devices coupling energy transmission methods or energy harvesting will be the
    key factors for the roll-out of autonomous wireless smart systems. Charging of
    global IoT terminals, power consumption of global IoT access points and gateways,
    as well as the power consumption of IoT data processing in IoT infrastructures
    will be one of the dominant power consumers in the future world. Mechanical energy
    harvest will be sufficient for body network as a part of IoT. Solar or wind energy
    is a conditional energy sources which may not be reliable. It can be used for
    battery charging. SECTION VII. Conclusion The IoT encompasses several technologies
    such as information technology, cognitive sciences, communication technology,
    and low-power electronics. IoT creates a newer information society and knowledge
    economy. But the challenges from research, industries, and the government will
    keep pushing and investing. The development of IoT will depend on technological
    advances in silicon scaling and energy-efficient devices, in getting the information
    from heterogeneous sources, in reducing costs, and in improving efficiencies.
    The development of the IoT exposed many new challenges including the lack of fundamental
    theory supporting, unclear architecture, and immature standards. To meet these
    challenges, we give a three-layer architecture including three platforms. The
    proposed acting standard can hopefully balance desires from different parties,
    can open the door for future fundamental theory development, and can eventually
    stimulate/regulate IoT development. Recent years, Chinese government is pushing
    the development of the IoT. Following the Chinese 12th Five-Year Plan for IoT
    Development, China has accomplished a number of demonstration application projects
    such as the smart city and the intelligent transportation system in public IoT
    applications, intelligent coal mine, and the IOFs in industry applications. The
    future of IoT will be expected to be unified, seamless, and pervasive. Large-scale
    service deployment needs to be framed within a set of standards. Thus, the developments
    of IoT as an intelligent system can be proceeding with interoperability, energy
    sustainability, privacy, and security. IoT have become an inevitable trend of
    development of information industry, which bound to bring new changes to our lives.

    are presented. • Widely used sensors in agricultural deployments are surveyed.

    • Ongoing challenges and future perspectives of IoT in agriculture are discussed.
    The increasing demand for food, both in terms of quantity and quality, has raised
    the need for intensification and industrialisation of the agricultural sector.
    The “Internet of Things” (IoT) is a highly promising family of technologies which
    is capable of offering many solutions towards the modernisation of agriculture.
    Scientific groups and research institutions, as well as the industry, are in a
    race trying to deliver more and more IoT products to the agricultural business
    stakeholders, and, eventually, lay the foundations to have a clear role when IoT
    becomes a mainstream technology. At the same time Cloud Computing, which is already
    very popular, and Fog Computing provide sufficient resources and solutions to
    sustain, store and analyse the huge amounts of data generated by IoT devices.
    The management and analysis of IoT data (“Big Data”) can be used to automate processes,
    predict situations and improve many activities, even in real-time. Moreover, the
    concept of interoperability among heterogeneous devices inspired the creation
    of the appropriate tools, with which new applications and services can be created
    and give an added value to the data flows produced at the edge of the network.
    The agricultural sector was highly affected by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies
    and is expected to be equally benefited by the IoT. In this article, a survey
    of recent IoT technologies, their current penetration in the agricultural sector,
    their potential value for future farmers and the challenges that IoT faces towards
    its propagation is presented. Previous article in issue Next article in issue

    1. Introduction and motivation The term “Internet of Things” (IoT) is a term first
    coined by a British visionary, Kevin Ashton, back in 1999. As the phrase “Internet
    of Things” reveals, the IoT paradigm will provide a technological universe, in
    which many physical objects or “Things”, such as sensors, everyday tools and equipment
    enhanced by computing power and networking capabilities will be able to play a
    role, either as single units or as a distributed collaborating swarm of heterogeneous
    devices. Agriculture is one of the sectors that is expected to be highly influenced
    by the advances in the domain of IoT. The Food and Agricultural Organization of
    the United Nation (FAO) predicts that the global population will reach 8 billion
    people by 2025 and 9.6 billion people by 2050 (FAO, 2009). This practically means
    that an increase of 70% in food production must be achieved by 2050 worldwide.
    The great increase in global population and the rising demand for high-quality
    products create the need for the modernisation and intensification of agricultural
    practices. At the same time, the need for high efficiency in the use of water
    and other resources is also mandatory. One of the most promising concepts, which
    is expected to contribute a lot to the required increase of food production in
    a sustainable way, is precision agriculture (PA) (Zhang, Wang, & Wang, 2002).
    Precision agriculture aims to optimise and improve agricultural processes to ensure
    maximum productivity and requires fast, reliable, distributed measurements in
    order to give growers a more detailed overview of the ongoing situation in their
    cultivation area, and/or coordinate the automated machinery in such way that optimises
    energy consumption, water use and the use of chemicals for pest control and plant
    growth. At a higher level, having gathered information from many heterogeneous
    systems, well-evaluated scientific knowledge can be organised in the form of smart
    algorithms to provide a better insight into the ongoing processes, do the reasoning
    of the current situation and make predictions based on heterogeneous inputs, produce
    early warnings about potential dangers that threaten the cultivars, and improved
    automated control signals, based on plant responses (Kacira et al., 2005, Körner
    and Van Straten, 2008). The algorithms required to handle the distributed data
    in real time are far too complicated to run locally on a low-power Wireless Sensor
    Network (WSN) node. However, in the context of IoT, all the objects will be interconnected,
    and therefore the computational overhead can be easily shifted to the cloud or
    be distributed among more than one interconnected devices. The greatly increasing
    interest in IoT in agriculture can be roughly seen in Fig. 1. The increase in
    the appearance of the term “IoT” along with the term “Agriculture” in the international
    scientific literature is rather indicative. These data motivated us to present
    an overview of the state-of-the-art research on IoT in its various forms, appearing
    in the agricultural sector, rather than a generic review. For this reason, a research
    methodology was adopted derived from the existing guidelines used by medical researchers,
    adapted and optimised for software engineering matters (Kitchenham, 2004). According
    to this methodology, a selection of recent literature was done, setting the year
    2010 as starting point. The 2010 starting point year was determined because it
    is then when a significant number of publications appeared. Moreover, technologies
    and approaches before 2010 are quite obsolete at the time of writing the present
    manuscript. Other selection criteria included the multidisciplinary nature of
    a publication. Works utilising more than one technology in order to synthesise
    their solutions were considered as IoT-oriented; for instance, cloud and embedded
    devices/wireless sensors, or, works that make use of more than one type of end
    devices (things) within the same network. Having none of the aforementioned restrictions,
    the reviewed literature area would be too wide and out of the scope of this work.
    Moreover, this paper seeks to present research that adopts newer architectures,
    closer to the principles of IoT. Download : Download high-res image (97KB) Download

    to “IoT in Agriculture”, as they appear in Scopus. This paper begins with an introduction
    in the recent trends in the technologies, which represent the building blocks
    of IoT, such as the Radio Frequency Identification Radio Frequency Identification
    (RFID), wireless sensor networks, the addressing of the “things” in a common network,
    as well as the applications running on the cloud. Following the same categorisation,
    several works are presented, which incorporate one or more of the IoT aspects
    and focus on the agricultural sector. Some of the most popular hardware platforms,
    met in agricultural deployments, is also surveyed. The review closes with a discussion
    on future challenges and their effect on IoT spreading, which has effects on the
    adoption of IoT in the agricultural sector too. One of the goals of this work
    is to provide the members of a multidisciplinary community, such as the researchers
    working on deploying innovative monitoring, tracking, decision support and control
    systems, with a handful manuscript that summarises the latest advances in embedded
    devices, sensor modules, wireless communication technologies, programming paradigms
    and cloud services suitable, or optimised, for use in agriculture. Some of the
    most common keywords appearing in the presented literature are presented in Fig.

    Keyword distribution in the presented literature. 2. Internet of Things enabling
    technologies The structure of IoT is based on three layers; namely, the perception
    layer (sensing), the network layer (data transfer), and the application layer
    (data storage and manipulation). Despite great improvements, IoT is still evolving,
    trying to obtain its final shape, as can be seen in several reviews (Atzori et
    al., 2010, Botta et al., 2014, Gubbi et al., 2013, Miorandi et al., 2012). As
    the term “Internet” implies, networking capability is one of the core features
    of the IoT devices. The internet as we know it today is mostly an internet of
    human end-users, while the IoT will be an internet of non-human entities, therefore
    a lot of machine-to-machine (M2M) communication will take place. 2.1. Layer 1:
    the perception layer At the perception layer, we meet technologies such as WSN,
    RFID and, recently, Near Field Communications (NFC). There is some overlap between
    WSN and RFID technologies, since semi-passive and active RFID tags can also be
    regarded as wireless nodes with lower computational and storage capacity. Typically,
    a wireless sensor node consists of a processing module, usually a low-power microcontroller
    unit (MCU), one or more sensor modules (embedded or external analogue or digital
    sensing devices) and an RF communication module, usually supporting a low-power
    wireless communication technology (Fig. 3). Download : Download high-res image
    (202KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. The architecture of a typical
    wireless sensor node. Apart from monitoring and control during the production
    process, there is a need for monitoring, identification and tracking of agricultural
    and livestock products after harvest. WSNs are often met in several works related
    to monitoring and climate control of storage and logistics facilities. RFID technology
    is considered the first, and most basic, example of interconnected “Things”. RFID
    tags contain data in the form of the Electronic Product Code (EPC) and the RFID
    Readers are triggering, reading and manipulating a large number of tags. Offering
    object identification, tracking and data storage on active or passive (without
    the need for embedded power supply) tags, RFID and NFC technologies play an important
    role in the agricultural domain. Typical user scenarios include products or livestock
    monitoring, supply chain and quality control tracking and lifecycle assessment
    of agricultural products (Welbourne et al., 2009). 2.2. Layer 2: the network layer
    At the second layer of IoT, wireless sensor nodes interacting with physical objects
    and/or their environment, communicate with their neighbouring nodes or a gateway,
    building networks through which the data are usually forwarded towards a remote
    infrastructure for storage, further analysis, processing and dissemination of
    the valuable knowledge that can be extracted (Gubbi et al., 2013). When it comes
    to wireless communications, a large scientific literature has been created on
    sensor networks, addressing several problems, such as energy efficiency, networking
    features, scalability and robustness (Atzori et al., 2010). Communication protocols
    built over wireless standards, such as 802.15.4, facilitate the device networking
    and bridge the gap between the internet-enabled gateways and the end-nodes. Such
    protocols include ZigBee, ONE-NET, Sigfox, WirelessHART, ISA100.11a, and 6LowPan,
    to name a few (Suhonen, Kohvakka, Kaseva, Hämäläinen, & Hännikäinen, 2012). Bluetooth
    Low Energy (BLE), LoRa/LoRaWAN, DASH7 and low-power WiFi have also appeared in
    several deployments recently. 2.3. Layer 3: the application layer The application
    layer is the third layer of the IoT. It is of high importance and, in many ways,
    it is this that facilitates the realisation of the IoT. The application layer
    faces several issues which have to be resolved, such as the identification of
    the devices as unique entities. Identifying and addressing billions of devices
    around the globe will provide a direct, internet-like access and control over
    them through the future internet. The uniqueness of identity, reliability, persistence
    and scalability represent important features of the addressing schema (Gubbi et
    al., 2013). IPv6, with its internet mobility aspects, could alleviate some of
    the device identification problems and is expected to play a vital role in this
    field (Botta et al., 2014). However, the heterogeneous nature of wireless nodes,
    the variability of data types, concurrent operations and confluence of data from
    the devices amplifies the problem even further (Zorzi, Gluhak, Lange, & Bassi,
    2010). Meta-data and context-aware addressing, supplementary to IPv6, are expected
    to contribute a lot while dealing with the above-mentioned challenges (Kalmar,
    Vida, & Maliosz, 2013). Heterogeneity is another big challenge in the IoT world.
    The vision of IoT is to allow billions of devices, with great diversity in their
    technical specifications (form factor, power supply, environmental capabilities,
    compatibility with other devices), computing power, peripheral devices and networking
    subsystems to co-exist in one inter-network. Middleware is a software layer, composed
    of sub-layers located between the devices and the application layer, abstracting
    the device functionalities and technical specificities and providing developers
    with sets of more generic tools to build their applications (Fig. 4). Middleware
    has gained much attention due to its major role in simplifying the development
    of new services and the integration of legacy technologies into new ones (Atzori
    et al., 2010). Furthermore, middleware is the mechanism that combines the cloud
    infrastructure with a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and the sensor networks
    in a generic manner, ready to provide appropriate tools for any type of deployment
    (Ghosh & Das, 2008). SOA approach benefits the enterprise by reducing the time
    invested in adapting itself to the changes imposed by the market and allows software
    and hardware reuse, since it is technology independent, when it comes to service
    implementations (Pasley, 2005). Future agricultural IoT interconnected devices
    may include sensors, connected machinery and vehicles, weather stations, internet
    gateways, network storage, RFID scanners, smartphones, tablets, wearables and
    many other devices. Download : Download high-res image (233KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. Software layers over heterogeneous devices and operating
    systems presenting how the Middleware layer serves in order to make it possible
    for a single/common application to run seamlessly on several platforms and operating
    systems. Finally, in order for the sensed data to have a real value for the end-user
    or another system (in case of M2M scenarios) they have to be stored, analysed,
    synthesised and presented in an understandable and intuitive manner. Big Data
    is one side-effect of the continuous data flow coming from billions of geo-distributed
    devices and has three dimensions, namely volume, variety and velocity (Beyer,
    2011). The Cloud with its virtually unlimited computational and storage capacity
    is the only technology capable of withstanding the IoT workload. In modern agricultural
    scenarios, stored data are automatically processed, corrected and used or combined
    under artificial intelligence algorithms, machine learning technologies, and decision-making
    systems based on models, in order to extract knowledge about phenomena, which
    cannot be directly measured. These systems can either propose the optimal tactic
    to the end-user, or produce the appropriate control signals for actuator devices,
    offering fully-automated sensing and control solutions. Plenty of studies have
    focussed on the standardisation of the IoT core technologies (Jazayeri et al.,
    2015, Sawant et al., 2014). The classical WSN/WSAN (Wireless Sensor-Actor Network)
    paradigm, i.e. distributed smart devices sensing and transferring data to a sink
    and/or driving one or more actuators, moves one step further towards interoperability
    of devices and objects. Other aspects of IoT include technologies that support
    the intercommunication among devices and/or end-users, as well as the platforms,
    the software, the hardware abstractions and the programming tools, over which
    developers and providers can build new applications and services (Atzori et al.,
    2010, Miorandi et al., 2012). The IoT paradigm is driven by the principles: “Anything
    communicates – anything is identified – anything interacts”. 3. Internet of Things
    hardware, platforms and sensors in agriculture 3.1. Low-power wireless sensor
    networks In the recent literature, a large number of embedded programmable devices
    have been used. Some are custom-built, while others are either commercial programmable
    boards or complete, closed-source sensing/monitoring solutions. Researchers choose
    their equipment depending on the research priorities set, or the main focus of
    each study. Commercial sensing solutions provide a number of features out of the
    box, allowing researchers to focus on other aspects of IoT deployments, like meta-processing,
    smart algorithms for monitoring and control, cloud interoperability, etc. (Edwards
    Murphy et al., 2015, Mamduh et al., 2012, Yu et al., 2011). Programmable, open
    solutions, on the other hand, provide developers the flexibility to have full
    control over the behaviour of the nodes and the network and program new peripheral
    devices to make them compatible with the nodes, like new sensor or actuator modules
    (Akshay et al., 2012; Wu, Li, Ma, Qiu, & He, 2012; Hou and Gao, 2010, Jayaraman
    et al., 2015a, Jimenez et al., 2012, Park and Park, 2011). The potential applications
    of IoT in agriculture cover a large number of scenarios. Barcelo-Ordinas, Chanet,
    Hou, & Garcia-Vidal (2016) categorise them in networks of scalar sensors, utilised
    in sensing and control of agricultural infrastructures, such as greenhouses, multimedia
    sensor networks for the remote image capturing and processing for the detection
    of insects and plant diseases, and tag-based networks (RFID, NFC) for product
    tracking and remote identification. Especially in the case of WSN in agriculture,
    the specific characteristics of the situation and the environment, in which the
    nodes will be deployed, should be taken into account. Crops, or other obstacles
    in farmlands whose positions may move, cause considerable interference in the
    communication between nodes. This varying movement of obstacles affects the connection
    quality of links, making it variable with space and time, affecting the deployment,
    routing, failure diagnosis, and other aspects of WSN. Harsh environmental factors
    such as temperature, humidity, rainfall and high solar radiation, the effect of
    shading by the plant leaves, as well as the noise produced by building structures,
    such as greenhouses, extend the spatiotemporal climatic variation, greatly affecting
    the links and communication quality among the nodes (Wang, Yang, & Mao, 2017).
    The periodic nature of the recorded phenomena in agricultural installations usually
    drive the development of the applications. This characteristic sets the requirements
    and provides opportunities for novel duty-cycle control, sampling scheduling,
    data reconstructions, as well as data storage and query, intelligent control,
    and so on (Ahonen et al., 2008, Mottola and Picco, 2011; Pawlowski et al., 2008).
    Therefore, the choice of the correct IoT platform to build a deployment could
    affect the overall success of the project. A summary of some of the popular programmable
    boards and embedded platforms used in recent deployments is presented in Table

    for agricultural Internet of Things/Wireless Sensor Network deployments Although
    many theoretical aspects of WSN have been extensively studied in literature, realistic
    IoT/WSN deployments in agricultural sector are quite demanding and remain a challenging
    task. Sensor modules need to be accurate enough, with the appropriate measuring
    range for the situation at hand, and shielded against environmental factors which
    can either create false readings or even destroy the sensor permanently. Due to
    the distributed nature of IoT, in cases of battery-operated nodes, placed in open
    fields or other agricultural facilities, replacing the power source can be a very
    difficult task, if not impossible. Therefore, very strict power constraints affect
    the selection of hardware and the low-power features of the selected peripheral
    devices are always considered when designing a new system. Software-wise the components
    which are to be integrated in order to implement the functionality of an end-device
    have to be carefully inspected. The final functional code requires deep embedded
    software engineering knowledge and sufficient testing to avoid failures in the
    field (Barrenetxea et al., 2008, Langendoen et al., 2006). . Other characteristics
    making a low-power, embedded device selectable for a deployment are its long-term
    stability, the number of digital and analogue inputs/outputs which determines
    the number of peripheral devices (sensors and actuators) that can be supported,
    the ability to be sustainable through power harvesting modules, and, the effort
    required for its programming. 3.3. Wireless communication protocols in agriculture
    The dominant wireless technologies in the domain of IoT are separated into seven
    main categories, namely, Global System for Mobile Communications (Groupe Spécial
    Mobile – GSM) offered by authorised operators, Wireless Personal Area Networks
    (WPAN), Wireless Regional Area Networks (Cognitive Radio/WRAN), Mesh, Point-to-Point
    (P2P) and Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPN/LPWAN). GSM standard is further divided
    into GSM EDGE Radio Access Network (GERAN) and UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network
    (UTRAN). Numerous wireless devices have been developed upon the various wireless
    standards. As in many aspects of IoT, interoperability is the biggest challenge.
    Another challenge, which is common in the wireless communications, is the interference
    among devices that operate in the same band (Bluetooth, ZigBee and WiFi, for instance)
    or in neighbouring bands. An attempt to summarise the most popular IoT wireless
    standards is presented in Table 2. Table 2. Summary table of the most popular

    provide a wide variety of bandwidth, communication range, power consumption and
    security measures. The variety of technologies and standards, as well as the differentiation
    among the IoT projects and their specific requirements, hamper interoperability
    at the networking layer. When it comes to agricultural deployments, high temperature,
    and high humidity are two very common phenomena. Based on the observations of
    Bannister, Giorgetti, and Gupta (2008), temperature has a significant effect on
    the received signal strength (RSS) when it rises from 25 °C to 65 °C. Similar
    results were presented by Boano, Tsiftes, Voigt, Brown, and Roedig (2010). Furthermore,
    humidity can also be very high in agricultural deployments. In the case of open
    fields, the wireless nodes are directly exposed to rain or irrigation systems.
    In greenhouses, relative humidity can be over 80% for long periods too. Humidity
    has been shown to strongly affect radio wave propagation (Room and Tate, 2007,
    Thelen, 2004). Therefore, the number of nodes, the distance between them, the
    height of the antenna, and the operating frequency based on the desired size of
    messages are serious matters to be taken into consideration, when choosing a wireless
    transceiver for an agricultural deployment. 4. Applications in agriculture The
    general overview of IoT structural elements presented in Section 2 clearly reveals
    the great potential of these technologies in the domains of Agriculture and the
    recent trend of Precision Agriculture (PA). Recent advances in sensor technology,
    along with the miniaturisation of electronics and the great drop in their cost
    have contributed a lot to the technological evolution of traditional agriculture
    to precision and micro-precision agriculture (Kacira et al., 2005). Climate sensors,
    ground sensors, radiation sensors, weather stations (made of sensors) emphasise
    that it is all about sensors and sensor data flows, which are stored and used
    for monitoring, knowledge mining, reasoning, and control. Additionally, in recent
    years, there is an increasing demand for high quality and safe agricultural products.
    This trend has yielded the need for interoperable, distributed, robust, and accurate
    logistics traceability systems. The IoT family of technologies provides all the
    appropriate tools for building and maintaining such infrastructure and services,
    specially designed to support supply chains in agricultural and floricultural
    sectors (Verdouw, Beulens, & van der Vorst, 2013). 4.1. Agricultural monitoring
    and control Sensors, in the form of wired and wireless sensors, have been widely
    used in agriculture during the last decades. Sensing the environment in which
    production occurs, and, more recently, the responses of the plants to the climate
    (Nishina, 2015), is crucial for taking the correct and more precise decisions,
    optimising productivity and quality of the cultivars. The traditional WSN have
    recently evolved to IoT-friendly-WSN, by adopting more generic standards in terms
    of communication, allowing remote access to the internet and implementing smart
    algorithms for meta-processing of the data aiming to improve monitoring and/or
    control. Versatile devices, with high computational abilities, very convenient
    form factor and low cost, can nowadays be used, on batteries, and operate for
    long periods, with or without the assistance of power harvesting modules. In addition,
    modern embedded devices have sufficient resources to support more demanding sensors,
    such as image sensors, and the support of more sophisticated networking protocols,
    such TCP/IP, extending the traditional WSN networking capabilities. A rough classification
    of literature on monitoring and control could be: - Monitoring and, in some cases,
    creation of early warnings, via simplified rules. This includes multi-point monitoring
    for catching and absorbing climatic gradients in greenhouse cultivation (Katsoulas
    et al., 2017a, Tolle et al., 2005). - Monitoring, meta-processing (algorithm/model
    implementations on the server/cloud side) and control, including control suggestions
    to the user and fully automated control (Aiello, Giovino, Vallone, Catania, &
    Argento, 2017). - Monitoring using more computationally demanding sensors, such
    as image sensors and more powerful end-nodes. Captured images are used either
    for plain monitoring of the system, or utilised for image processing on-board,
    at the edge of the network (Fog computing) or on a cloud/server-based infrastructure
    (Katsoulas et al., 2016, Ravikanth et al., 2017, Senthilkumar et al., 2016). Sensing
    is of high importance in agriculture. WSNs have been widely used in climate and
    soil monitoring deployments both in open field and in controlled environment agriculture.
    4.2. Controlled environment agriculture Greenhouses have been shown to present
    significant climate variability, which affects the productivity of the plants
    (Kittas, Bartzanas, & Jaffrin, 2003), if not harming them. Greenhouse cultivation
    is more intense, therefore, in many cases, it requires higher precision in terms
    of monitoring and control (Fig. 4). Several studies have focussed only on localised
    and remote monitoring. In most cases data are stored and represented in various
    graphical ways (Wu et al., 2012; Jimenez et al., 2012; Katsoulas, Bartzanas, &
    Kittas, 2017; Yu et al., 2011, Zhao et al., 2010). In addition to the high-precision
    monitoring, there have been studies presenting systems which incorporate meta-processing
    procedures with data transferred on remote infrastructures through the internet.
    Utilising well-evaluated equations, crop and climate models, such systems produce
    assessments of the climate and/or crop status in order for the grower to take
    better decisions or get early warnings (Ferentinos et al., 2015, Fernandes et
    al., 2013, Hernandez and Park, 2011, Hu and Qian, 2011, Jiao et al., 2014, Katsoulas
    et al., 2017b, Ma et al., 2011, Suciu et al., 2015, Tuli et al., 2014, Yu and
    Zhang, 2013, Zhou et al., 2013). Agricultural-cloud IoT solutions for greenhouse
    monitoring and control are more and more common. End-nodes collect various data
    which are uploaded to a cloud infrastructure where these data are analysed deeply,
    in a faster way, at a lower cost, reliably and efficiently (Jiawen et al., 2013,
    Keerthi and Kodandaramaiah, 2015, Wang et al., 2013a). Since plant factories are
    becoming more popular in the wider frame of urban CEA in smart cities, there have
    been a number of studies focussing on artificial growth systems (Kozai and Fujiwara,
    2016, Lee and Yoe, 2015). Katsoulas, Bartzanas, et al. (2017) presented a system
    for online precise irrigation scheduling for greenhouses (OpIRIS) based on well-evaluated
    scientific knowledge organised in the form of a web application communicating
    with remote sensors installed in greenhouses. The system integrated industrial-grade
    climate sensors and machinery including fertigation valves/controllers and sensors
    for automatic drainage sampling and forwarding the data to the cloud infrastructure
    for further analysis. The system proved very accurate in predicting the crop water
    needs and provided growers with very efficient indications about when to irrigate
    and how much nutrient solution to apply. Similar attempts to automate irrigation
    have been based on an agricultural information cloud and a hardware combination
    of IOT and RFID (Tongke, 2013), the system achieving dynamic distribution of resource
    and load balancing. As a result, authors report high efficiency of resource use
    and significant improvement in water quality. There have also been studies that
    implement control of one or more of the actuator systems in greenhouses, such
    as climate, or, irrigation controllers, also known as WSANs (Moga et al., 2012,
    Sabri et al., 2011). The control can be done remotely in two ways. The first is
    manual control by the farmer. In these cases, system administrator, based on the
    suggestions made by a Decision Support System/Expert System, chooses to control
    the machinery. Applications in this monitoring and control category include Integrated
    Pest Management (IPM) (Chougule, Kumar, & Mukhopadhyay, 2016), remote monitoring,
    warning and control in open field (Chu et al., 2013, Dinh Le and Tan, 2015), and
    in controlled environment agriculture (Ferentinos et al., 2015, Pahuja et al.,
    2013, Qiu et al., 2013). There also plenty of studies attempting fully-automated
    control by communicating the control signals, produced after processing the sensed
    data, directly to the actuators succeeding a closed-loop control (Kassim et al.,
    2014, Nikolidakis et al., 2015, Rajaoarisoa et al., 2012, Yin et al., 2014, Yongheng
    and Feng, 2014). 4.3. Open-field agriculture In open-field deployments researchers
    usually measure climate conditions, but also focus a lot in soil monitoring. In
    many cases authors use more than one sensors in the ground, at different depths.
    Optimising irrigation by providing exactly as much water as the plant needs is
    the only way to preserve water, since all the extra amount or irrigation is either
    lost into the ground, or in the atmosphere through evaporation (Fig. 5) (Sivakumar,
    GunaSekaran, SelvaPrabhu, Kumaran, & Anandan, 2012). Optical sensors have been
    used for additional information on crop reflectance or remote temperature sensing,
    as well as, mapping of the situation in the field (Fisher and Kebede, 2010, Inoue
    et al., 2012, Moshou et al., 2011, O''Shaughnessy and Evett, 2010). Integration
    of IoT and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) has been proposed in cases where
    precision of mapping of the sensed data is important (Li et al., 2012, Wang et
    al., 2013b, Ye et al., 2013). Another aspect of WSNs in agriculture are the Underground
    Wireless Sensor networks, which present significant advantages, especially in
    open field applications (De Lima et al., 2010, Dong et al., 2013, Silva and Vuran,
    2010). Download : Download high-res image (188KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 5. A modern example of Cloud IoT solutions for climate monitoring and
    climate optimisation based on cloud analytics services. Data fusion is realised
    on the cloud. These data come from various sources, like sensors inside and outside
    the facilities, weather stations, historical data from data bases. User can interact
    remotely with the system through a wide variety of devices (laptops, tablets,
    smartphones, etc.). As mentioned earlier, the advances in embedded device technology
    have made very powerful platforms available at very convenient prices. This has
    given the chance to researchers to implement more sophisticated end-devices, such
    as Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks, incorporating sensing nodes with much
    bigger computational capabilities, enough to support highly demanding peripheral
    devices, such as image sensors. This kind of node allows heavier local processing
    at the edge of the network, in fog-network-like manner. These works either use
    cameras for simple security or facility monitoring purposes (Cai et al., 2011,
    Zhang et al., 2011), or implement various image processing algorithms in order
    to track invading animals (Baranwal & Pushpendra, 2016), insects or other plant
    threats (Dang et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2014) and crop growth (Rodriguez de la
    Concepcion, Stefanelli, & Trinchero, 2014). 4.4. Livestock applications Several
    deployments have been realised in the fields of livestock. Optimal environment
    which absorbs extreme climate conditions known to have negative effects on animals
    productivity is a serious matter for many authors (Corkery et al., 2013, Ilapakurti
    and Vuppalapati, 2015, Wang and Lee, 2012, Zhang et al., 2016). Livestock IoT
    includes not only animal and animal climate monitoring and control, but, in some
    cases includes field monitoring for optimal feeding practices (Fig. 6) (Bhargava,
    Ivanov, & Donnelly, 2015). Another aspect of livestock IoT includes the instrumentation
    and analysis of beehives (Edwards Murphy et al., 2015). Wireless sensors have
    been used in animal tracking and behavioural analysis (Asikainen et al., 2013,
    Huircán et al., 2010, Jeong and Yoe, 2012, Kwong et al., 2012, Nadimi et al.,
    2012) as well as odour and hazardous gas monitoring (Mamduh et al., 2012). There
    are also studies that focus on optimising the performance of the equipment used
    in livestock deployment, based on the imposed challenges of the situation at hand
    (Jeong & Yoe, 2012). Download : Download high-res image (151KB) Download : Download

    overview. 4.5. Food supply chain tracking Modern agriculture tends to be more
    and more industrialised. Therefore, standardisation mechanisms at each step for
    the product, from the grower to the consumer, have to be adopted in order to assure
    food safety and quality (Fig. 8). This need has led to a growing interest in food
    supply chain traceability systems. Internet of Things (IoT) technologies include
    plenty of solutions to contribute greatly to the construction, support and maintenance
    of such systems. In the reviewed literature, solutions focus either on the business
    side of Food Supply Chain (FSC) or technology. There are some works, though, which
    attempt to propose solutions for both sides. Recent developments in e-commerce
    have given a boost to various Supply Chain research activity. In this review,
    however, a focus only on FSC was attempted, since they are optimised for food
    supplies. Download : Download high-res image (206KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 8. Schematic representation of the food supply chain from the production
    phase until the final consumer. RFID is the most common IoT technology found in
    Food Supply Chain (FSC). RFID tags, acting as enhanced barcodes, enable the tracking
    of agricultural products. Recent research, following the IoT paradigm, has combined
    more than one sensor to enrich the information of product status whenever this
    is recorded through its RFID (Maksimovic et al., 2015, Zhao et al., 2013). A common
    issue in IoT is its distributed nature and the asynchronous and heterogeneous
    flow of information. Therefore, naming is vital for the accurate and fast retrieval
    of information when it comes to FSC tracking services (Liu et al., 2015). The
    realisation of IoT-based infrastructure leads to the virtualisation of the supply
    chains, since physical proximity is no longer required (Verdouw et al., 2013).
    Various models analysing the FSC issues and the way IoT technologies tackle them
    appear in literature (Lianguang, 2014, Zhang, 2014). Technological evolution,
    combined with the increasing robustness and maturity of several technologies met
    in IoT, have given researchers the chance to develop complete systems, which incorporate
    sensing modules and software infrastructures. The software part of these systems
    is either hosted on cloud providers or shared among distributed shareholders.
    Complete systems offer automated services, intelligent schemes and automatic reasoning
    based on the measured phenomena and artificial intelligence (Chen, 2015, Jiang
    and Zhang, 2013, Xu et al., 2011). Other works present approaches on how to organise
    a complete FSC information management system (Li, Chen, & Zhu, 2013) or how to
    design the system in such a way that it maximises the economic profit (Pang, Chen,
    Han, & Zheng, 2015). 4.6. Internet of Things middleware and interoperability Interoperability
    at all levels is a key concept in the developing IoT world. Middleware is an approach
    that aims to facilitate interoperability (Fig. 9). The concept of interoperability
    in IoT can be expressed in many ways. Modern agriculture has evolved into a highly-intensive
    industry, expanding from the level of single grower up to international organisations.
    Therefore, agricultural-oriented IoT research offers literature in all aspects
    of interoperability, namely technical, syntactical, semantic and organisational
    interoperability . Download : Download high-res image (99KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 9. The dimensions of interoperability (Serrano et al., 2015).
    Technical interoperability is associated with hardware and software components,
    aiming to provide seamless exchange of information between systems (M2M). Syntactical
    interoperability has to do with data formats, i.e. the syntax that messages should
    have, in order to be exchanged between the systems, in the form of bit-tables
    or high level languages (HTML, XML, etc.). Semantic interoperability has a special
    value for end users, since it has to do with the human interpretation and understanding
    of the content produced by IoT systems. Finally, organisational interoperability
    is of high importance when it comes to IoT scalability. The ability to communicate
    effectively and transfer meaningful data, over highly varying systems and/or geographic
    regions is the key to success of distributed, global-IoT infrastructures (Serrano
    et al., 2015). Hu, Wang, She, and Wang (2011a) present a middleware to promote
    data (Technical) interoperability among various grain storage systems. Technical
    interoperability is the absolute basic type of interoperability a system must
    satisfy. At a higher level of intercommunication among systems, syntactical interoperability
    has to be implemented, in more generic, understandable and human-friendly messages.
    The incorporation of new, high-end, technologies, such as IoT, within a traditional
    productive sector, such as agriculture, and the trend of precision agriculture
    has given Semantic interoperability middleware an extra value. This is because
    Semantic interoperability middleware makes technology more intuitive and easier
    to understand, for both growers and agronomists (Jayaraman et al., 2015b, Sawant
    et al., 2014). Knowledge retrieval is a second feature of Semantic middleware.
    Data flows are organised and synthesised, allowing for better reasoning and management
    in agricultural (Perera et al., 2013, Yuan et al., 2013) and livestock (Saraswathi
    Sivamani, Park, Shin, Cho, & Cho, 2015) deployments. Moving one step further towards
    the realisation of large-scale national, or international cooperative deployments,
    organisational interoperability has been studied (Hu et al., 2011b, Sivamani et
    al., 2013). Providing the base for seamless cooperation between organisations
    presents numerous advantages, ranging from the technical level, for instance,
    quality improvement in sensing, reasoning and control systems by automatic exchange
    of knowledge between self-learning and self-improving systems, up to economic
    and business level by adapting the production rate according to market trends.
    4.7. Multi-layer deployments and commercial solutions IoT allows for the interoperability
    of the systems and organisations. Therefore, it makes it easier to interconnect
    systems involved in the various phases of a product''s lifecycle and several studies
    have presented systems which integrate numerous platforms that monitor, control
    and track agricultural products. Fu (2012) presents in short an intelligent agricultural
    system which could potentially be used in optimal melon and fruit production and
    management, as well as internet trading and supply chain tracking of organic goods.
    IoT concepts and technologies have been widely applied in many aspects of the
    transportation and storage of goods from the producer to the wholesale reseller
    to the consumer, from post-harvest treatment optimisation, storage facilities
    monitoring and management, and controlled environment shipping containers (Dittmer
    et al., 2012, Moon et al., 2015) to swarms of delivery drones (Yu, Subramanian,
    Ning, & Edwards, 2015), autonomous trucks and ships. IoT applications are there
    to drive future changes (Hribernik, Warden, Thoben, & Otthein, 2010). Several
    vendors have moved towards providing solutions either in the form of service or
    solutions that also include the hardware to do the monitoring. In all these cases
    cloud-based applications do the analysis of the data providing suggestions, warnings
    or control signals. These solutions do not only focus on large-scale production,
    but also on individual gardening and home production. Bitponics is cloud-based
    solution offering automated advisory services for garden care (Bitponics, 2016).
    Plantlink offers a solution for connecting garden to home users integrating sensors
    and irrigation controller in one network (Plantlink, 2016). Growtronix is a modular
    system that can monitor almost every aspect of indoor gardens and plant factories
    (Growtronix, 2016). Some promising smart greenhouse monitoring and control solutions
    are offered by Sensaphone, Monnit and GetSenso (GetSenso, 2016, Monnit, 2016,
    Sensaphone, 2016). These solutions aim to optimise climate in greenhouses minimising
    the risk of yield losses through a more optimal climate for the crops. In addition,
    Fieldclimate appears to be a rich platform providing both hardware (weather stations,
    sensor nodes) and cloud-based software solutions (weather forecast, irrigation
    management, disease models etc.) (FieldClimate, 2016). CropX is a complete system
    including field ground sensors measuring soil moisture and temperature, uploading
    the data to the cloud and offer a mapping and optimal irrigation planning as a
    service to the grower through a mobile application (CropX, 2016). Microsoft has
    recently launched its end-to-end IoT platform for agriculture. FarmBeats consists
    of UAV drones and sensors, connectivity support, and cloud infrastructure which
    includes machine learning-based backend analytics with predictive features, and
    cloud storage (Microsoft, 2015). 5. Discussion 5.1. Internet of Things hardware
    & software challenges in agriculture When it comes to IoT in agriculture, several
    challenges arise. Firstly, the equipment residing at the perception layer has
    to be exposed directly to harsh environmental phenomena, like high solar radiation,
    extreme temperatures, rain or high humidity, strong winds, vibrations and other
    dangers capable of destroying the electronic circuits. The end-devices will have
    to stay active and function reliably for long periods relying on the limited power
    resources of batteries. Therefore, appropriate programming tools and low-power
    capabilities are mandatory, since the frequent battery replacement or reset of
    the stations (in case of a program failure), for example in a large-scale open
    field deployment, is not easy. Power harvesting can be a solution to some extent,
    however, the power consumption has still to be within the power budget of small
    power harvesting modules (e.g. solar panels, wind turbines etc.). Furthermore,
    the large number of interconnected (in an internet-like manner) devices produces
    an incredibly large amount of data, which will soon be beyond the resource capacities
    of small-scale server infrastructures to handle (Atzori et al., 2010, Ziegeldorf
    et al., 2014). 5.2. Organisational challenges & interoperability When it comes
    to logistics for the food and agricultural sector, this infrastructure aims to
    facilitate the exchange of information and the transportation of goods, optimising
    the production process and the supply chain networks globally. IoT is gradually
    transforming business processes by providing more accurate and real-time visibility
    to the flow of materials and products (Lee & Lee, 2015). Cloud Computing provides
    high quality services, hardware-agnostic application development tools and sufficient
    storage and computational resources to store and process the data produced at
    the edge of the network. Therefore, it seems like an ideal complement for the
    IoT technologies towards the composition of “CloudIoT” paradigm (Botta et al.,
    2014). The huge amount of data produced at the edge of the network, however, can
    incur a severely high cost to be transferred to the cloud, both in terms of money
    and latency. Therefore, the optimal balancing between the edge storage and processing
    and the part of the workload that is to be done on the cloud is a serious matter.
    Fog Computing is an extension of the Cloud Computing paradigm, expanding cloud
    technologies and tools, as well as, the horizons of application development (Bonomi,
    Milito, Natarajan, & Zhu, 2014). 5.3. Networking challenges The characteristics
    of the environment do not only impose challenges to the hardware, but also to
    the network layer. Wireless communication is the most common in agricultural deployments,
    due to the lack of wiring costs. Environment is known to be one of the major factors
    which lead to low wireless link quality, through the multi-path propagation effects
    and its contribution to background noise (Wang et al., 2017). Real-world deployments
    have shown that the performance of popular transceivers is affected by temperature
    (Bannister et al., 2008, Boano et al., 2010), humidity (Thelen, 2004), human presence
    and other obstacles within the space in which a wireless node attempts to communicate.
    Therefore, data have to be transferred using robust and reliable technologies,
    according to the requirements and challenges of the rural environment. 5.4. Security
    challenges The transfer to an interconnected internet of “smart things” must ensure
    the security, authenticity, confidentiality and privacy of the stakeholders involved
    in this network. In other words, IoT must be secure against external attacks,
    in the perception layer, secure the aggregation of data in the network layer and
    offer specific guarantees that only authorised entities can access and modify
    data in the application layer. Security in IoT is summarised in three requirements:
    authentication, confidentiality and access control (Sicari, Rizzardi, Grieco,
    & Coen-Porisini, 2015). In the perception layer the most common security issues
    include information acquisition security and physical security of the hardware.
    The latter one is quite important in the case of agriculture, since the devices
    can be deployed in open fields and function without surveillance for long periods.
    Due to the distributed nature of IoT and the fact that its devices may be deployed
    in diverse environments, a single security protocol is, usually, not enough (Li,
    2012). RFID security issues are usually related to leakage of information, which
    can unveil the location and other sensitive data. Security countermeasures include
    data encryption, use of blocker tags, tag frequency modification, jamming and,
    finally, tag destruction policy, in other words the physical ending of a tag''s
    life (Matharu, Upadhyay, & Chaudhary, 2014). Sensor nodes differ from RFID tags,
    in the way that sensors are active and relate to dynamic properties of things.
    Therefore, encryption algorithms, key distribution policies, intrusion detection
    mechanisms and security routing policies have to be deployed, always keeping in
    mind the hardware restrictions of smart devices. In the current IoT concept, data
    flow from the end devices to a gateway, which is in charge of uploading these
    data to other infrastructures, such as the cloud. Various security policies for
    sensor terminals exist, including cryptographic algorithms, identity authentication
    mechanisms, data flow control policies, data filtering mechanisms etc. (Li, 2012).
    Moreover, the perception layer requires information acquisition security measures
    too. Wiretapping, tampering, cheating, and replay attacks are just a few of the
    security threats. Therefore, authenticity, confidentiality and data integrity
    have to be ensured during the phase of data acquisition, and key management protocols
    and secure routing policies should be adopted and sensor node authentication policies
    must be leveraged to prevent data access by unauthorised entities (Gou, Yan, Liu,
    & Li, 2013). 5.5. Stack challenges Middleware is another part of IoT presenting
    specific requirements for increased security, since it stands between the network
    and application layers and is responsible both for data processing and communication
    interface between these two layers. Security in the middleware layer requires
    confidentiality and secure data storage. Wireless medium is challenging, when
    it comes to security in transmissions, even for more sophisticated hardware than
    the platforms met in IoT deployments. Therefore, the IoT architecture can easily
    be exposed to risks, such as denial of service attacks, unauthorised access, man-in-the-middle
    attacks, and virus injections which target and affect confidentiality and data
    integrity. Authentication, intrusion detection, key management and negotiation
    mechanisms could possibly provide solutions against the network layer threats.
    Application layer is the top layer in the IoT vision. It is the place where enormous
    flows of data streams end, requiring increased storage and computational resources.
    This is why the application layer is so closely-related with the cloud. The security
    issues here are not very different from the security issues of the cloud itself,
    including data security, privacy, backup and recovery. Control mechanisms need
    to administer the privileges and ownership of data and manage the access rights
    to all, or part of the information, both for physical users and between machines,
    or even organisations. 5.6. Potential value of IoT in agriculture Internet of
    Things is rapidly evolving and many novel applications and services are emerging
    from it. A great amount of research is being conducting towards the integration
    of various heterogeneous systems, the security assurance at various levels of
    IoT and the analytics, which will give a better insight into the “Big Data” in
    order to optimise various business processes. National policy of governments around
    the world for increased production rate of fresh-cut vegetables and meat, at lower
    price, with higher quality standards, as well as, the consumers'' demand for transparency
    in the production cycle and the environmental footprint of the products they buy,
    provide IoT a huge field for development and diffusion. According to Bradley,
    Barbier, and Handler (2013), the estimates from 2013 to 2022 of potential IoT
    value vary significantly, ranging from a minimum of $1 trillion up to more than
    $15 trillion, not including the increased revenues, the benefits of cost reduction
    among companies and industries and the general economic activity due to IoT. Much
    of the added-value of IoT comes from the flexibility and the optimisation and
    precision that it introduces into the production processes of industry and production
    units of all types. Therefore, it is not so risky to forecast that agricultural
    sector processes at all levels will drastically change in the very near future.
    Obviously the economic numbers related to IoT are very big, tempting some very
    serious players to invest in it. Examples, like the recent purchase of Nest Labs,
    a company specialising in IoT for home automation, by Google for $3.2 billion
    in cash and the purchase of Jasper Technologies, developer of and IoT cloud platform,
    by Cisco for $1.4 billion, reveal the great potential of IoT and prove that it
    is highly attractive to big investors and behemoth technological firms. The partnership
    formation, however, is not so trivial. This is due to the fact that the companies
    involved in IoT invest in one or a few aspects of it, because of its wide nature.
    Therefore, sooner or later, they will have to cooperate with each other, putting
    aside any competition, or the notion of who is more important, in order to introduce
    some universal standards in the evolving IoT hype. 6. Conclusion When it comes
    to agriculture, IoT is expected to optimise the production by many means. Farmlands
    and greenhouses are about to move from precision to a micro-precision model of
    agricultural production. Distributed, pervasive computing and precise monitoring
    of the facilities will provide the optimal growing or living conditions for both
    vegetables and animals. Autonomous systems will be able not only to command the
    actuators in the most efficient way, optimising the utility and resource usage,
    but also to control the production in accordance to the market situation, maximising
    the profit and minimising the costs in every possible way. On the other hand,
    food supply chains, equipped with WSN and RFID equipment, will be able to monitor
    each stage in the life of a product, make automatic reasoning, in case of a faulty
    product and increase consumer''s feeling of safety, through a transparent product
    lifecycle information system. All the above is the optimistic approach of the
    IoT integration in agriculture. However, in this concept, plenty of individual
    players are about to participate. First of all, local networks have to be secured
    against interference from other networks, especially as these technologies reach
    their full potential. In a real IoT scenario, most of the players will use different
    equipment, with different technical specifications and/or sensor characteristics.
    Obviously, the interoperability, the filtering and the semantic annotation of
    the data, coming from each producer, has to be made to some extent. This is the
    only way in which the data, coming from vastly heterogeneous sources, can be used
    to optimise a shared decision support or expert system. Security, anonymity and
    control over the access rights on the information is vital for such a system to
    be adopted. In a wider perspective, many of the data related to business/institution
    strategic planning cannot be disclosed or retrieved by non-authorised entities,
    so that the market is safe against unorthodox tactics. References Ahonen et al.,

    rights and content Abstract The design of sustainable wireless sensor networks
    (WSNs) is a very challenging issue. On the one hand, energy-constrained sensors
    are expected to run autonomously for long periods. However, it may be cost-prohibitive
    to replace exhausted batteries or even impossible in hostile environments. On
    the other hand, unlike other networks, WSNs are designed for specific applications
    which range from small-size healthcare surveillance systems to large-scale environmental
    monitoring. Thus, any WSN deployment has to satisfy a set of requirements that
    differs from one application to another. In this context, a host of research work
    has been conducted in order to propose a wide range of solutions to the energy-saving
    problem. This research covers several areas going from physical layer optimisation
    to network layer solutions. Therefore, it is not easy for the WSN designer to
    select the efficient solutions that should be considered in the design of application-specific
    WSN architecture. We present a top-down survey of the trade-offs between application
    requirements and lifetime extension that arise when designing wireless sensor
    networks. We first identify the main categories of applications and their specific
    requirements. Then we present a new classification of energy-conservation schemes
    found in the recent literature, followed by a systematic discussion as to how
    these schemes conflict with the specific requirements. Finally, we survey the
    techniques applied in WSNs to achieve trade-off between multiple requirements,
    such as multi-objective optimisation. Previous article in issue Next article in
    issue Keywords State-of-the-artWireless sensor networksEnergy-efficiency 1. Introduction
    There is abundant literature relating to energy-saving in WSNs as numerous methods
    have been proposed in the last few years, and there is still much ongoing research
    on how to optimise power usage in battery-limited sensor networks. However, none
    of the proposed solutions is universally applicable. For example, if safety applications
    require fast and timely responsiveness, this is not the case for other applications,
    such as in agriculture where the delay property is not as important. We believe
    that WSN energy-saving problems should be tackled by taking into consideration
    application requirements in a more systematic manner. In [1], Yick et al. provide
    a general survey of wireless sensor networks. This study reviews sensor platforms
    and operating systems, network services issues and communication protocol challenges,
    but it does not addresses the energy issues. In [2], Anastasi et al. present a
    valuable taxonomy of energy-conservation schemes. However, the authors mainly
    focus on duty cycling and data-reduction approaches. There also exist several
    technique-specific surveys that concentrate on only one energy-efficient mechanism
    (like energy-efficient routing protocols, data aggregation techniques, energy
    harvesting approaches [3], [4], [5]) since every category of solution often represents
    a whole research area in itself. Our aim is to provide WSN designers with a top-down
    survey that offers a holistic view of energy-saving solutions while taking into
    consideration the specific requirements of the applications. In this paper, we
    propose a new classification of energy-efficient mechanisms which integrates the
    most recent techniques and up-to-date references. Moreover, we give particular
    attention to the design of energy-efficient sensor networks that satisfy application
    requirements. Our study is original in that we focus on the trade-offs between
    meeting specifications and sustainability that necessarily arise when designing
    a WSN. We thus discuss mechanisms that enable a satisfactory trade-off between
    multiple requirements to be achieved. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
    first time that this approach has been taken. The rest of this paper is organised
    as follows. In the next section, we present the main categories of applications
    we have identified and their respective requirements. Then, in Section 3, we discuss
    existing standards for low-power wireless sensor networks and show that current
    standards cannot respond to all application needs. In Section 4, we give an overview
    of the major energy-saving mechanisms developed so far and discuss their advantages
    and shortcomings regarding the set of identified requirements. In Section 5, we
    review techniques proposed in the literature to achieve a trade-off between multiple
    requirements, including network lifetime maximisation. Finally, Section 6 concludes
    this paper. 2. WSN applications and their requirements In this section, we propose
    a taxonomy of WSN applications, given in Fig. 1, and we summarise in Table 1 the
    specific requirements of each described application. Download : Download full-size

    systems have received significant attention from the research community, and the
    corresponding applications are surveyed in [6], [7], [8]. We identify two types
    of healthcare-oriented systems, namely, vital status monitoring and remote healthcare
    surveillance. In vital status monitoring applications, patients wear sensors that
    supervise their vital parameters in order to identify emergency situations and
    allow caregivers to respond effectively. Applications include mass-casualty disaster
    monitoring [9], vital sign monitoring in hospitals [10], and sudden fall or epilepsy
    seizure detection [11]. Remote healthcare surveillance concerns care services
    that are not vital and for which the constant presence of a healthcare professional
    is not necessary. For example, as illustrated in Fig. 2, body sensors can be used
    to gather clinically relevant information for rehabilitation supervision [12],
    elderly monitoring [13] or to provide support to a physically impaired person
    [14]. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Illustration of a body sensor
    network. WSNs used in healthcare must meet several requirements. In particular,
    they have to guarantee hard real-time data delivery delays, confidentiality and
    access control. They must also support mobility and provide Quality of Service.
    Indeed, in the context of early and life-critical detection of emergencies such
    as heart attacks and sudden falls, the real-time aspect is decisive. In this case,
    situation identification and decision-making must occur as quickly as possible
    to save precious minutes and the person’s life. Therefore, the data delivery delay
    between the nodes and the end-user must be short in order to meet hard real-time
    requirements. It is also necessary that healthcare networks support node mobility
    to ensure the continuity of service when both patients and caregivers move. Additionally,
    exchanged healthcare data are sensitive and medical information must be kept private
    by restricting access to authorised persons. Thus, achieving confidentiality and
    access control through a communication network requires the establishment of mechanisms
    for data protection and user authentication. Furthermore, when WSNs are integrated
    into a global hospital information system, critical data such as alarms share
    the bandwidth with less sensitive data such as room temperature. Therefore, traffic
    prioritisation is essential to satisfy strict delay requirements through QoS provisioning.
    2.2. Industry: Manufacturing and smart grids The automation of monitoring and
    control systems is an important aim for many utility companies in manufacturing,
    water treatment, electrical power distribution, and oil and gas refining. We consider
    the integration of WSNs in Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems
    and Smart Grids. SCADA systems refer to computer systems that monitor and control
    industrial processes. Wireless sensors, together with actuators, can be used for
    factory automation, inventory management, and detection of liquid/gas leakages.
    These applications require accurate supervision of shock, noise and temperature
    parameters in remote or inaccessible locations such as tanks, turbine engines
    or pipelines [15], [16]. The aim of Smart Grids is to monitor the energy supply
    and consumption process thanks to an automated and intelligent power-system management.
    The potential applications of sensor networks in smart grids are: sensing the
    relevant parameters affecting power output (pressure, humidity, wind orientation,
    radiation, etc.); remote detection of faulty components; control of turbines,
    motors and underground cables; and home energy management [17], [18]. The main
    requirements of industrial applications are bounded delay, robustness and security.
    Indeed, the products handled in industry can be very dangerous and require special
    care in storage and handling. For example, in an oil refinery, due to their high
    volatility and flammability, products with low boiling points evaporate easily,
    forming flammable vapours. Thus, the pressure in a tank or the temperature of
    a furnace can quickly become critical. This is why strict delays must be ensured
    so that the time that elapses between the detection of an anomaly and the intervention
    of the operator enables the incident to be resolved. Furthermore, in many industries,
    networks are subject to diverse disturbances such as faulty components, node failure,
    disconnections and congestion. This is because sensors operate under harsh conditions,
    as motes placed in pipelines or tanks experience high pressure and temperatures,
    or continuous vibrations. So, industry implementations must ensure data reliability
    at all times. Moreover, given the sensitivity of the data, availability, integrity,
    authenticity and confidentiality are all security problems that must be taken
    into consideration when designing an industrial communication network. 2.3. Transportation
    systems Various studies related to the integration of WSNs and transportation
    systems have already been conducted: they include traffic monitoring and real-time
    safety systems sharing bandwidth with commercial services. In traffic-monitoring
    systems, wireless sensors are embedded on roadways and intersections in order
    to collect traffic data. For example, they can count vehicles in queues to adjust
    traffic signals or the number of toll booths and lanes opened [19], [20]. In safety
    systems, wireless sensors are employed to cope with situations such as emergency
    braking, collision avoidance, lane insertion assistance and hazardous driving
    conditions warnings (stop-and-go waves, ice on the road, crossing animals) [21],
    [22]. In addition to passenger-safety applications, commercial on-board applications
    are being devised by service providers. They include route guidance to avoid rush-hour
    jams [23], smart high-speed tolling, assistance in finding a parking space [24]
    and automobile journey statistics collection [25]. Due to the life-critical characteristics
    of transport applications, the WSNs designed in this domain must guarantee hard
    real-time delays, security and QoS while supporting mobility. For instance, systems
    related to driving safety must ensure tight bounded end-to-end delays in order
    to guarantee response times. This constitutes the main challenge of such applications
    since people’s lives are at stake. For traffic monitoring applications, timely
    information is also required in order to ensure efficient real-time management
    of vehicle flow. In future Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs), safety systems
    and service applications will share the same wireless channel which requires tools
    to integrate service differentiation. Indeed, critical information and traffic-control
    should have higher priority than other service packets. Furthermore, vehicle-to-vehicle
    and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications are constrained by car speed. So,
    mobility is inherent to the automotive domain as nodes evolve in an extremely
    dynamic environment. Finally, the life-critical characteristic of some applications
    raises security issues in the transport network, which may be the target of a
    cyber-attack. Thus, the network must be protected against data corruption that
    could give false information about traffic or conditions on the road. By relaxing
    the power factor, nodes can support sophisticated encryption algorithms to provide
    a higher level of security. 2.4. Public safety and military systems Wireless sensor
    networks can help to anticipate and manage unpredictable events, such as natural
    disasters or man-made threats. We categorise public safety and military applications
    into active intervention and passive supervision. Active intervention refers to
    systems with nodes attached to agents for temporary deployment and is dedicated
    to the safety of team-oriented activities. While working, each member carries
    a sensor so that a remote leader will be able to monitor both the holder’s status
    and the environmental parameters. This applies to emergency rescue teams [26],
    miners [27] and soldiers [28]. With passive supervision, static sensors are deployed
    in a large area such as a civil infrastructure or nuclear site for long-term monitoring.
    Relevant examples of passive supervision applications are surveillance and target
    tracking [29], emergency navigation [30], fire detection in a building, structural
    health monitoring [31], [32] and natural disaster prevention such as in the case
    of tsunamis, eruptions or flooding [33]. Due to their critical nature, public
    safety and military applications are characterised by the need for short delays,
    service differentiation and data integrity provisioning. In addition, active intervention
    applications must support mobility and passive supervision should ensure coverage.
    First, a decisive parameter to take into account when designing a public safety
    system is the delivery delay, as in emergency applications, timely alarm reporting
    is necessary for the system to be reactive. Furthermore, public safety and military
    systems deal with both everyday monitoring data and warning data. Thus, anomaly
    detection alarms should be sent in packets having high priority over regular reports
    through an efficient service differentiation mechanism. Finally, both kinds of
    public safety applications should guarantee data integrity: in active intervention,
    corrupt data could endanger agents by giving false information to headquarters;
    in passive supervision, an ill-intentioned person could circumvent a surveillance
    system by sending false data. In the case of active intervention, mobility is
    inherent to the architecture as wearable sensors are carried by working people.
    Moreover, from drilling tunnels to the fire field, active intervention applications
    are often characterised by their use in harsh environmental conditions. In these
    conditions, the network should be resistant to node failure and poor link quality
    by means of a fault-tolerant routing scheme. Long-term infrastructure monitoring
    requires the deployment of untethered static sensors in order to supervise the
    region of interest. Therefore, passive supervision applications may run into coverage
    problems when required to entirely supervise a building or a tunnel. 2.5. Environment
    and agriculture WSNs are particularly well suited to agricultural and open-space
    monitoring applications since wired deployment would be expensive and inefficient.
    A variety of applications have been developed in precision agriculture, cattle
    monitoring and environmental monitoring. In precision agriculture, sensor nodes
    are scattered throughout a field to monitor relevant parameters, such as atmospheric
    temperature, soil moisture, hours of sunshine and the humidity of the leaves,
    creating a decision support system. Another purpose of precision agriculture is
    resource (water, fertiliser, pesticides) optimisation [34], frost protection,
    disease development prediction [35]. In cattle monitoring applications, general
    surveillance of livestock is convenient to keep watch on cattle health status,
    to detect disease breakouts, to localise them and to control end-product quality
    (meat, milk) [36], [37]. The use of WSNs for diverse environmental monitoring
    applications has been studied for coastline erosion [38], air quality monitoring
    [39], safe drinking water and contamination control [40]. The main requirements
    of environmental and agricultural applications are scalability, coverage and lifetime
    prolongation. Agricultural fields, grazing land and monitored sites can reach
    several tens of hectares, so the number of motes deployed varies from dozens to
    thousands. This is why scalability is an important issue when developing protocols
    to support a high quantity of nodes and ensure full coverage of the controlled
    area. Corke et al. [41] have conducted several real experiments in natural environments
    and have shown that outdoor conditions could be very harsh and impact the feasibility
    of communication. Typically, foliage, rain or humidity can lead to the breakdown
    of inter-node links, resulting in highly variable and unpredictable communications.
    Fault tolerant routing schemes must therefore be set up to ensure area coverage
    and cope with failure or temporary disconnection. In most environmental monitoring
    applications, nodes are static as they are deployed on the ground in fields, in
    forests or along the banks of rivers. Nevertheless, mobility must be taken into
    account, whether this is desired or not. Unwished-for mote displacement can be
    caused by heavy rains, wind, animals or engines. When mobility is intentional,
    nodes and sinks are embedded in vehicles [42] or a natural moving bearer such
    as animals. 2.6. Underground and underwater sensor networks Underground and underwater
    sensor networks are emerging types of WSNs, which are used in different categories
    of applications including environmental monitoring, public safety and industry.
    They differ from traditional terrestrial networks in that the sensors are deployed
    in special environments that make communications difficult and impact their ease
    of deployment. Underground sensor networks consist of sensors that are buried
    in and communicate through dense materials like soil or concrete. Such networks
    can be used for soil moisture reporting in agriculture [43], infrastructure supervision,
    intrusion detection [44] and transport systems [45]. Underwater sensor networks
    rely on immersed sensors and are used in a variety of applications such as ocean
    supervision [46], water quality monitoring [47], disaster prevention, surveillance
    [48] and pipeline monitoring. Underground and underwater sensor networks share
    common requirements such as robustness and coverage. The main characteristic of
    these networks is their lossy channel due to extreme environmental conditions.
    Indeed, acoustic communications for underwater sensors and electromagnetic waves
    for underground sensors suffer from lower propagation speed, noise and path loss,
    which lead to the degradation of the signal [45], [48]. Therefore, they require
    the development of specific communication protocols to ensure the application’s
    reliability. Coverage is also an issue since it may not be possible to optimally
    deploy the nodes due to the ground profile, the costs and the efforts required
    for excavation. Moreover, these networks are inherently three-dimensional (which
    raises additional issues) since the devices can be deployed at varying depths
    depending on the phenomenon to supervise. Besides these requirements, energy is
    of great importance due to the difficulty of unearthing a device to replace it
    or recharge its battery. 2.7. Discussion The main WSN requirements that we identified
    in the different applications are scalability, coverage, latency, QoS, security,
    mobility and robustness. In Table 1, we summarise the importance of these requirements
    for every class of application considered in this section. In these applications,
    sensors are expected to operate autonomously for a long period of time, ranging
    from weeks to months. However, every application is constrained in terms of energy
    due to the scarce battery resources of the sensors, which limits the network lifetime.
    Indeed, it may not always be possible to manually replenish the motes because
    of their number, the maintenance cost or the inaccessibility of monitored regions.
    This is the case of structural health monitoring applications, precision agriculture
    and environment monitoring, transportation systems. Furthermore, some applications
    such as healthcare applications can tolerate battery replacement, but we believe
    that the rapid depletion of the battery prevent their wide adoption. Indeed, efforts
    are still made to propose energy-efficient solutions for body area networks to
    foster the acceptance of these technologies by the patients. This is why the design
    of WSNs requires, in both cases, the development of energy-efficient solutions
    that meet a specific set of requirements. In order to achieve energy efficiency,
    we first present in the next section existing standards developed for low-power
    wireless sensor networks. 3. Low-power WSN standards Wireless sensor network standards
    have been specifically designed to take into account the scarce resources of nodes.
    In what follows we give a brief description of low-power standards including IEEE
    802.15.4, ZigBee, WirelessHART, ISA100.11a, Bluetooth low energy, IEEE 802.15.6,
    6LoWPAN, RPL and MQTT. IEEE 802.15.4 [49] specifies the physical and MAC layers
    for low data rate wireless personal area networks (LR-WPANs). In the beacon-enabled
    mode, the standard allows energy to be saved by implementing duty cycling, so
    that all nodes can periodically go to sleep. In practice, a coordinator sends
    beacon packets to synchronise the nodes, and the superframe structure presented
    in Fig. 3 is subdivided into three parts: (1) a contention access period during
    which nodes use a slotted CSMA/CA (2) a contention-free period containing a number
    of guaranteed time slots (GTS) that can be allocated by the coordinator to specific
    nodes and (3) an inactive period during which the end-devices and coordinator
    can go to sleep. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. The superframe structure
    of the IEEE 802.15.4 beacon-enabled mode. ZigBee [50] is a wireless technology
    developed as an open standard to address the requirements of low-cost, low-power
    devices. ZigBee defines the upper layer communication protocols based on the IEEE
    802.15.4 standard. It supports several network topologies connecting hundreds
    to thousands of devices. WirelessHART [51] operates on the IEEE 802.15.4 specification
    and targets field devices such as sensors and actuators that are used to monitor
    plant equipment or processes. The standard characteristics are integrated security,
    high reliability and power efficiency. WirelessHART relies on a fixed length TDMA
    scheme so nodes can go to sleep when it is not their slot time. Moreover, it specifies
    a central mesh network where routing is exclusively determined by the network
    manager that collects information about every neighbouring node. It uses this
    information to create an overall graph of the network and defines the graph routing
    protocol. In practice, the standard does not specify how to implement such a graph
    routing so some research work already proposes multipath routing protocols for
    industrial processes [52], [53]. While these studies take link quality into consideration
    for the routing decisions, it may be possible to use the node battery-level information
    in order to further improve energy savings. The ISA100.11a [54] standard relies
    on the IEEE 802.15.4 specification and is dedicated to reliable wireless communications
    for monitoring and control applications in the industry. ISA100.11a uses deterministic
    MAC scheduling with variable slot length, allowing nodes to go into sleep mode
    when it is not their time slot. Moreover, the standard defines non-router nodes
    that do not act as forwarders and experience very low energy depletion. Finally,
    the standard requires each device to report its estimated battery life and associated
    energy capacity to the System Manager which allocates communication links based
    on the reported energy capabilities. In addition to low power consumption, ISA100.11a
    also focuses on scalable security; robustness in the presence of interference;
    and interoperability with other wireless devices such as cell phones or devices
    based on other standards. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) [55] addresses low-cost devices
    with very low battery capacity and short-range requirements. It is an extension
    of the Bluetooth technology that allows communication between small battery-powered
    devices (watches, wireless keyboards, sport sensors) and Bluetooth devices (laptops,
    cellular phones). In terms of energy efficiency, Bluetooth low energy is designed
    so that devices can operate for over a year thanks to an ultra low-power idle
    mode. BLE is suitable for a variety of applications in the fields of healthcare,
    sports and security. IEEE 802.15.6 [56] is a recent standard that defines the
    PHY and MAC layers for low-power devices operating in the vicinity of, or inside
    a human body for medical and non-medical applications. A BAN (Body Area Network)
    is composed of one hub and up to 64 nodes, organised into one-hop or two-hops
    star topologies. At the MAC level, the channel is divided into super-frame structures,
    which are further divided into different access phases to support different traffic
    and channel access modes (contention based and contention free). There are eight
    user priorities, ranging from best-effort to emergency event reports. These are
    differentiated based on the minimum and maximum contention windows. The standard
    also supports 3 levels of security: level 0 – unsecured communications, level
    1 – authentication only, level 2 – authentication and encryption. 6LoWPAN [57]
    stands for IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks. 6LoWPAN is designed
    for low-power devices that require Internet communication. It enables IEEE 802.15.4-based
    networks to send and receive IPv6 packets so that small devices are able to communicate
    directly with other IP devices, locally or via IP networks (e.g. Ethernet). RPL
    [59] is a distance vector Routing Protocol for Low Power and lossy networks compliant
    with IPv6, specifically designed to meet the requirements of resource-constrained
    nodes. RPL is optimised for many-to-one communications for data collection, but
    it also supports one-to-many and one-to-one communications. RPL creates a Directed
    Acyclic Graph (DAG) anchored at a border router of a WSN. A node maintains several
    parents to construct different routes towards the sink and selects its preferred
    parent based on an Objective Function that uses routing metrics. For example,
    a draft [60] proposes to select the path that minimises the sum of Expected Number
    of Transmissions (ETX) over traversed links but the design of the Objective Function
    is still an open research issue. Thus, it is possible to create a DAG focusing
    on energy efficiency, as in Kamgueu et al. [61] who use the node’s remaining energy
    as an RPL routing metric. RPL offers other features like fault-tolerance, self-repair
    mechanisms, and security [62]. MQTT [63] (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)
    is a lightweight publish/subscribe protocol for one-to-many message distribution.
    Currently undergoing standardisation, MQTT is envisioned to be the future protocol
    for the Internet-of-Things to connect devices with low bandwidth and power budget
    over TCP/IP infrastructures. MQTT-S [64] extends MQTT for Wireless Sensors and
    Actuators Networks on non-TCP/IP networks. As illustrated in Fig. 4, publishers
    produce information and send their data to the broker via a pub message. Subscribers
    interested in receiving certain data send a sub message to the broker. If there
    is a match between a subscriber’s and a publisher’s topics, the broker transfers
    the message to the subscriber. MQTT-S saves energy by supporting multiple gateways
    to balance the load in the network. It also supports sleeping clients (subscribers/publishers)
    and size-limited packets to be compliant with ZigBee. Moreover, most of the protocol
    logic is handled in the broker and the gateway, which makes the device’s implementation
    lightweight [65]. Although MQTT is already implemented in various projects [66],
    there is a lack of evaluation regarding the energy-efficiency of the protocol.

    communications. 3.1. Discussion Bluetooth low energy and IEEE 802.15.4-based standards
    have been specifically developed for battery-operated devices. They enable energy-saving
    through duty cycling and include optional modes that can be disabled for further
    network lifetime optimisation. In Table 2 we compare these two WSN-specific standards
    with other well-known wireless standards (Wi-Fi, WiMax, WiMedia, Bluetooth) regarding
    data rate, transmission range, scalability and applications. Table 2. Wireless

    In terms of applications, existing healthcare platforms often interface with Bluetooth
    due to the suitability of this technology for body area networks that demand short
    communication ranges and high data rates. However, Bluetooth technology may quickly
    deplete a nodes’ energy. In this case, BLE or IEEE 802.15.6 may be considered
    as alternatives. ZigBee technology is suitable for a large number of applications
    thanks to its scalability and energy-efficiency. For example, in smart home automation,
    ZigBee data rate and radio range are sufficient for room supervision. Nevertheless,
    in a more complex monitoring system, both ambient sensor networks and body sensor
    networks may be integrated together and further connected to the Internet via
    6LowPan. In large-scale outdoor deployment, the Zigbee 100-meter achievable radio
    range may quickly become limiting. In this case, we envision that WiMax-enabled
    gateways will be able to mesh the topology to connect the network to the Internet.
    Thus, the integration of different technologies and standards is necessary to
    respond to the needs of emerging and challenging applications such as Smart grids,
    Intelligent Transportation Systems and Healthcare Information Systems. Standardisation
    is a key issue for the success of WSN markets. Although application-specific standards
    are emerging, such as WirelessHART and ISA100.11a for industry, and IEEE 802.15.6
    for body sensor networks, they can still be improved in regard to application
    requirements. For instance, some research studies propose to optimise standard
    parameters such as packet size, slot length, contention window length or even
    introduce alternative protocols. Moreover, the performances of recent standards
    (e.g. MQTT, IEEE 802.15.6) need further investigation, because there is a lack
    of evaluation concerning these solutions and a lack of comparisons with well-established
    protocols. It also appears that current standards cannot respond to all application
    needs, notably regarding hard real-time requirements and security issues. In parallel
    to ongoing standardisation efforts, many solutions have been developed which strongly
    consider energy-saving. 4. Energy-saving mechanisms In this section, we review
    the major existing approaches proposed to tackle the energy consumption problem
    of battery-powered motes. The proposed taxonomy of energy-efficient mechanisms
    is summarised in Fig. 5. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Classification
    of energy-efficient mechanisms. 4.1. Radio optimisation The radio module is the
    main component that causes battery depletion of sensor nodes. To reduce energy
    dissipation due to wireless communications, researchers have tried to optimise
    radio parameters such as coding and modulation schemes, power transmission and
    antenna direction. Modulation optimisation aims to find the optimal modulation
    parameters that result in the minimum energy consumption of the radio. For instance,
    energy depletion is caused by the circuit power consumption and the power consumption
    of the transmitted signal. For short distances, circuit consumption is greater
    than the transmission power while for longer ranges the signal power becomes dominant.
    Existing research tries to find a good trade-off between the constellation size
    (number of symbols used), the information rate (number of information bits per
    symbol), the transmission time, the distance between the nodes and the noise.
    Cui et al. [67] showed that the energy consumption required to meet a given Bit
    Error Rate (BER) and delay requirement can be minimised by optimising the transmission
    time. Costa and Ochiai [68] studied the energy efficiency of three modulation
    schemes and derived from this the modulation type and its optimal parameters that
    achieve minimum energy consumption for different distances between nodes. Cooperative
    communications schemes have been proposed to improve the quality of the received
    signal by exploiting several single-antenna devices which collaborate to create
    a virtual multiple-antenna transmitter. The idea is to exploit the fact that data
    are usually overheard by neighbouring nodes due to the broadcast nature of the
    channel. So, by involving these nodes in the retransmission of data it is possible
    to create spatial diversity and combat multi-path fading and shadowing [69]. Jung
    et al. [70] investigated how cooperative transmission can be used to extend the
    communication range and thus balance the duty cycling of nodes as normal relay
    sensors can be replaced by other cooperative nodes. Cui et al. [71] and Jayaweera
    [72] compared the energy consumption of both SISO (Single Input Single Output)
    and virtual MIMO (Multiple Input and Multiple Output) systems and show that MIMO
    systems can provide better energy savings and smaller end-to-end delays over certain
    transmission range distances, even with the extra overhead energy required for
    MIMO training. Transmission Power Control (TPC) has been investigated to enhance
    energy efficiency at the physical layer by adjusting the radio transmission power
    [73], [74]. In CTCA (Cooperative Topology Control with Adaptation) [75] the authors
    propose to regularly adjust the transmission power of every node in order to take
    into consideration the uneven energy consumption profile of the sensors. Therefore,
    a node with higher remaining energy may increase its transmission power, which
    will potentially enable other nodes to decrease their transmission power, thus
    saving energy. However, TPC strategy has an effect not only on energy but also
    on delays, link quality, interference and connectivity. Indeed, when transmission
    power decreases, the risk of interference also decreases. Moreover, fewer nodes
    in the neighbourhood are subjected to overhearing. On the contrary, delay is potentially
    increased, because more hops will be needed to forward a packet. Finally, transmission
    power influences the network topology because the potential connectivity between
    sensors will vary, and it also favours the spatial reuse of bandwidth if two communications
    can occur without interference. Directional antennas allow signals to be sent
    and received in one direction at a time, which improves transmission range and
    throughput. Directional antennas may require localisation techniques to be oriented,
    but multiple communications can occur in close proximity, resulting in the spatial
    reuse of bandwidth. In contrast to omnidirectional motes which transmit in unwanted
    directions, directional antennas limit overhearing and, for a given range, require
    less power. Thus, they can improve network capacity and lifetime while influencing
    delay and connectivity [76], [77]. To take advantage of the properties of directional
    antennas, new MAC protocols have been [78], [79]. However, some problems that
    are specific to directional antennas have to be considered: signal interference,
    antenna adjustments and deafness problems [80]. Energy-efficient cognitive radio:
    A cognitive radio (CR) is an intelligent radio that can dynamically select a communication
    channel in the wireless spectrum and can adapt its transmission and reception
    parameters accordingly. The underlying Software-Defined Radio (SDR) technology
    is expected to create fully reconfigurable wireless transceivers which automatically
    adapt their communication parameters to network demands, which improves context-awareness.
    However, CR requires significant energy consumption compared with conventional
    devices due to the increased complexity involved for new and sophisticated functionalities
    [81]. In this context, designing energy-efficient cognitive radio sensor networks
    is a key challenge in the intelligent use of battery energy. Recent cognitive
    radio studies are interested in the power control of transmitters [82], residual
    energy-based channel assignment, and combining network coding and CR. Open research
    issues include the development of cross-layer approaches for MAC, routing or clustering
    protocols that take advantage of cognitive radio opportunities. 4.2. Data reduction
    Another category of solutions aims to reduce the amount of data to be delivered
    to the sink. Two methods can be adopted jointly: the limitation of unneeded samples
    and the limitation of sensing tasks because both data transmission and acquisition
    are costly in terms of energy. Aggregation: In data aggregation schemes, nodes
    along a path towards the sink perform data fusion to reduce the amount of data
    forwarded towards it. For example, a node can re-transmit only the average or
    the minimum of the received data. Moreover, data aggregation may reduce the latency
    since it reduces traffic, thus improving delays. However, data aggregation techniques
    may reduce the accuracy of the collected data. Indeed, depending on the aggregation
    function, original data may not be recovered by the sink, thus information precision
    can be lost. Data aggregation techniques dedicated to wireless sensor networks
    are surveyed in detail by Rajagopalan and Varshney in [3] and by Fasolo et al.
    in [83]. Adaptive sampling: The sensing task can be energy-consuming and may generate
    unneeded samples which affects communication resources and processing costs. Adaptive
    sampling techniques adjust the sampling rate at each sensor while ensuring that
    application needs are met in terms of coverage or information precision. For example,
    in a supervision application, low-power acoustic detectors can be used to detect
    an intrusion. Then, when an event is reported, power-hungry cameras can be switched
    on to obtain finer grained information [2]. Spatial correlation can be used to
    decrease the sampling rate in regions where the variations in the data sensed
    is low. In human activity recognition applications, Yan et al. [84] propose to
    adjust the acquisition frequency to the user activity because it may not be necessary
    to sample at the same rate when the user is sitting or running. Network coding
    (NC) is used to reduce the traffic in broadcast scenarios by sending a linear
    combination of several packets instead of a copy of each packet. To illustrate
    network coding, Fig. 6 shows a five-node topology in which node 1 must broadcast
    two items of data, a and b. If nodes simply store and forward the packets they
    receive, this will generate six packet transmissions (2 for each node 1, 2 and
    3 respectively). With the NC approach, nodes 2 and 3 can transmit a linear combination
    of data items a and b, so they will have to send only one packet. Nodes 4 and
    5 can decode the packet by solving linear equations. Therefore, two packets are
    saved in total in the example. Network coding exploits the trade-off between computation
    and communication since communications are slow compared to computations and more
    power-hungry. Wang et al. [85] combine network coding and Connected Dominating
    Sets to further reduce energy consumption in broadcast scenarios. AdapCode [86]
    is a data dissemination protocol where a node sends one message for every N messages
    received, saving a fraction of the bandwidth up to (N − 1)/N compared to naive
    flooding. The receiver node can recover the original packets by Gaussian elimination
    after receiving N coded packets successfully. Moreover, AdapCode improves reliability
    by adapting N to the node density, because when N increases and the density decreases,
    it becomes harder to recover enough packets to decode the data. Reliability is
    further enhanced by allowing nodes receiving less than N packets to send a negative
    acknowledgement to retrieve missing data. Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 6. An example of network coding. Data compression encodes information in
    such a way that the number of bits needed to represent the initial message is
    reduced. It is energy-efficient because it reduces transmission times as the packet
    size is smaller. However, existing compression algorithms are not applicable to
    sensor nodes because of their resource limitations. Therefore, specific techniques
    have been developed to adapt to the computational and power capabilities of wireless
    motes. Kimura and Latifi [87] have surveyed compression algorithms specifically
    designed for WSNs. 4.3. Sleep/wakeup schemes Idle states are major sources of
    energy consumption at the radio component. Sleep/wakeup schemes aim to adapt node
    activity to save energy by putting the radio in sleep mode. Duty cycling schemes
    schedule the node radio state depending on network activity in order to minimise
    idle listening and favour the sleep mode. These schemes are usually divided into
    three categories: on-demand, asynchronous and scheduled rendezvous [2]. A summary
    of the properties of each category is given in Table 3. Duty cycle based protocols
    are certainly the most energy-efficient but they suffer from sleep latency because
    a node must wait for the receiver to be awake. Moreover, in some cases it is not
    possible for a node to broadcast information to all of its neighbours because
    they are not active simultaneously. Finally, fixing parameters like listen and
    sleep periods, preamble length and slot time is a tricky issue because it influences
    network performance. For example, a low duty cycle saves a large amount of energy
    but can drastically increase communication delays. Thus, protocol parameters can
    be specified prior to deployment for simplicity, although this leads to a lack
    of flexibility, or they can be set up dynamically for improved adaptation to traffic
    conditions. Concerning duty cycling, some work has been done to adapt the active
    period of nodes online in order to optimise power consumption in function of the
    traffic load, buffer overflows, delay requirements or harvested energy [88], [89].
    For more details about duty cycling, information can be found in [2], [90]. Table

    Wake up a node only when another wants to communicate with it Nodes wakeup at
    the same time as its neighbours according to a wakeup schedule. Then they go to
    sleep until their next rendez-vous Each node wakes up independently but its active
    period must overlap with its neighbours Broadcast No Yes No Synchronisation No
    Yes No Energy-efficiency Nodes remain active only for the minimum time required

    Nodes need to wake up more frequently. Either the sender sends long preamble or
    the receiver remains awake longer Examples of applications Even-driven application
    with low duty cycle Data-gathering application with possibility of aggregation
    Mobile applications when the neighbourhood is unpredictable Illustration Passive
    wake-up radios: While duty cycling wastes energy due to unnecessary wake-ups,
    low-power radios are used to awake a node only when it needs to receive or transmit
    packets while a power-hungry radio is used for data transmission. Ba et al. [91]
    consider a network composed of passive RFID wake-up radios called WISP-Motes and
    RFID readers. A passive RFID wake-up radio uses the energy spread by the reader
    transmitter to trigger an interruption that wakes up the node. In practice all
    sensors cannot be equipped with RFID readers since they have a high power consumption.
    This is a major shortcoming because, coupled with the short operational range
    of RFID passive devices, it restricts their use to single-hop scenarios. Simulations
    have shown that WISP-Motes can save a significant amount of energy at the expense
    of extra hardware and increased latency in data delivery. The authors demonstrated
    their benefits in the case of a sparse delay-tolerant network with mobile elements
    equipped with RFID readers. Topology control: When sensors are redundantly deployed
    in order to ensure good space coverage, it is possible to deactivate some nodes
    while maintaining network operations and connectivity. Topology control protocols
    exploit redundancy to dynamically adapt the network topology based on the application’s
    needs in order to minimise the number of active nodes. Indeed, nodes that are
    not necessary for ensuring connectivity or coverage can be turned off in order
    to prolong the network lifetime, as in Fig. 7. Misra et al. [92] propose a solution
    capable of maintaining network coverage while minimising the energy consumption
    of the network by activating only a subset of nodes, with the minimum overlap
    area. In a recent work, Karasabun et al. [93] consider the problem of selecting
    a subset of active connected sensors for correlated data gathering. This is very
    useful in some applications like environmental monitoring, when the sensed data
    are location-dependent, since the data of inactive nodes can be inferred from
    those of active nodes due to the spatial correlation. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 7. Example of a topology control method applied to a network. To ensure
    the field coverage, a sensor must remain activated in each square area. The other
    nodes are deactivated. 4.4. Energy-efficient routing Routing is an additional
    burden that can seriously drain energy reserves. In particular, in multi-hop schemes,
    nodes closer to the sink are stressed because they have to route more packets.
    Therefore, their battery depletes faster. In what follows, we discuss the general
    energy-saving mechanisms of different routing paradigms. For an extensive review
    of energy-aware routing protocols, survey articles can be found in [4], [94],
    [95]. Cluster architectures organise the network into clusters, where each cluster
    is managed by a selected node known as the cluster head (CH). The cluster head
    is responsible for coordinating the members’ activities and communicating with
    other CHs or the base station. Cluster techniques have been proposed to enhance
    energy efficiency because they help to limit energy consumption via different
    means: (i) they reduce the communication range inside the cluster which requires
    less transmission power, (ii) they limit the number of transmissions thanks to
    fusion performed by the CH, (iii) they reduce energy-intensive operations such
    as coordination and aggregation to the cluster head, (iv) they enable to power-off
    some nodes inside the cluster while the CH takes forwarding responsibilities and
    (v) they balance energy consumption among nodes via CH rotation. In addition to
    energy-efficiency, cluster architectures also improve network scalability by maintaining
    a hierarchy in the network [96], [97]. Energy as a routing metric: Another solution
    to extend the lifetime of sensor networks is to consider energy as a metric in
    the setup path phase. By doing so, routing algorithms do not only focus on the
    shortest paths but can select the next hop based on its residual energy. Recently,
    Liu et al. [98] introduced two new energy-aware cost functions. The Exponential
    and Sine Cost Function based Route (ESCFR) function can map a small change in
    remaining nodal energy to a large change in the cost function value. By giving
    preference to sensors with higher remaining energy during route selection, the
    function enforces energy balance. The Double Cost Function based Route (DCFR)
    protocol considers the energy consumption rate of nodes in addition to their remaining
    energy. The rationale behind this is that nodes in hotspots have high energy consumption
    rates. Thus, the use of this function further improves the energy-balancing performance
    of the routing protocol, even in networks with obstacles. Multipath routing: While
    single-path routing protocols are generally simpler than multipath routing protocols,
    they can rapidly drain the energy of nodes on the selected path. In contrast,
    multipath routing enables energy to be balanced among nodes by alternating forwarding
    nodes. As an example, the EEMRP (Energy-Efficient Multipath Routing Protocol)
    [99] discovers multiple node-disjoint paths using a cost function depending on
    the energy levels and hop distances of the nodes and allocates the traffic rate
    to each selected path. The EECA (Energy-Efficient and Collision Aware) protocol
    [100] constructs two node-disjoint and collision-free routes between a source
    and a sink. Multipath routing protocols also enhance network reliability by providing
    multiple routes, which enables the network to recover faster from a failure, whereas
    in single path schemes, when a node runs out of power, a new route must be recomputed.
    The interested reader can consult [101] for a recent survey of multipath routing
    protocols for WSNs. Relay node placement: The premature depletion of nodes in
    a given region can partition the network or create energy holes. Sometimes, this
    situation can be avoided thanks to the optimal placement of nodes through even
    distribution or by adding a few relay nodes with enhanced capabilities. This helps
    to improve energy balance between nodes, avoid sensor hot-spots and ensure coverage
    and k-connectivity [102]. Several works have focused on finding the minimum number
    of relay nodes or placing them optimally to prolong the network lifetime [103],
    [104]. For example, Dandekar and Deshmukh [105] optimise the placement of static
    sinks to shorten the average hop distance of every node to its nearest sink. Sink
    mobility: In WSN architectures that use a static base station, sensors located
    close to the base station deplete their battery faster than other sensor nodes,
    leading to premature disconnection of the network. This is due to the fact that
    all traffic is forwarded towards the sink which increases the workload of the
    nodes closer to the sink. To increase network lifetime, it is possible to balance
    the load between nodes using a mobile base station which moves around the network
    to collect node information. Sink mobility also improves connectivity in sparse
    architectures and enhances reliability because communication occurs in a single-hop
    fashion. Thus, it reduces contention, collisions and message loss [2], [106].
    When controllable, this mobile displacement can be studied to prevent high latency,
    buffer overflow and energy depletion [107], [108]. 4.5. Charging solution Several
    recent research studies address energy harvesting and wireless charging techniques.
    Both are promising solutions which aim to recharge sensor batteries without human
    intervention. Energy harvesting: New technologies have been developed to enable
    sensors to harvest energy from their surrounding environment such as solar, wind
    and kinetic energy [5]. Compared to traditional sensors, rechargeable motes can
    operate continuously and, theoretically, for an unlimited length of time. They
    convert ambient energy to electrical energy and then either consume it directly
    or store it for later use. Energy harvesting architectures often require energy
    prediction schemes in order to efficiently manage the available power. Indeed,
    sensors require an estimation of energy evolution to adjust their behaviour dynamically
    and last until the next recharge cycle. Hence, they can optimise decisive parameters
    such as sampling rate, transmit power and duty cycling to adapt their power consumption
    according to the periodicity and magnitude of the harvestable source. It is important
    to note that nodes remain energy-limited between two harvesting opportunities,
    so they still need to implement energy-saving mechanisms. For example, motes using
    solar panels to replenish their batteries can operate intensively during daytime.
    At night, nodes may enter a conservative mode to useP the stored energy. Furthermore,
    nodes may have an uneven residual energy distribution due to the difference in
    the quantity of energy collected, and this has to be taken into account when designing
    protocols [109]. For example, nodes with low residual energy may be assigned higher
    sleep periods and lower transmission ranges, while those with high residual energy
    may be preferred when selecting a routing path. Another open perspective is the
    development of protocols that consider the degradation of the battery over time
    (leakage, storage loss) [110] which will influence network performance. Wireless
    charging: Recent breakthroughs in wireless power transfer are expected to increase
    the sustainability of WSNs and make them perpetually operational, since these
    techniques can be used to transmit power between devices without the need of any
    contact between the transmitter and the receiver. Wireless charging in WSNs can
    be achieved in two ways: electromagnetic (EM) radiation and magnetic resonant
    coupling. Xie et al. [111] show that omni-directional EM radiation technology
    is applicable to a WSN with ultra-low power requirement and low sensing activities
    (like temperature, light, moisture). This is because EM waves suffer from rapid
    drop of power efficiency over distance, and active radiation technology may pose
    safety concerns to humans. In contrast, magnetic resonant coupling appears to
    be the most promising technique to address energy needs of WSNs thanks to an higher
    efficiency within several-meter range. The applications of wireless energy transfer
    in WSNs are numerous. It has already been applied to power medical sensors and
    implantable devices [112], to replenish sensors embedded in concrete in a wireless
    manner [113] and to power a ground sensor from a UAV [114]. The emergence of wireless
    power charging technology should allow the energy constraint to be overcome, as
    it is now possible to replenish the network elements in a more controllable manner.
    In this way, some researchers have already investigated the use of mobile chargers
    that directly deliver power to deployed nodes [115], [116], [117], [118]. A new
    challenge raised by wireless charging technologies is energy cooperation, since
    nodes may now be able to share energy between neighbours. So, in future wireless
    networks, nodes are envisioned to be capable of harvesting energy from the environment
    and transferring energy to other nodes, rendering the network self-sustaining
    [119]. In order to do this, recent studies demonstrate the feasibility of multi-hop
    energy transfer [120], [121], which open new perspectives for the design of wireless
    charging protocols and energy cooperative systems. 4.6. Discussion It is clear
    that many efforts have been made to enhance the lifetime of WSNs through a variety
    of energy-efficient mechanisms. It also appears that energy efficiency and other
    applications requirements are strongly dependent, so that various performance
    metrics have to be optimised jointly. Indeed, energy-efficient routing protocols
    and sleep/wakeup schemes directly influence network latency. Similarly, radio
    optimisation trades off signal quality for battery conservation, and data reduction
    approaches can affect the accuracy of the collected information. Additionally,
    if sensor recharging techniques are promising, energy-saving mechanisms remain
    essential. In Table 4, we summarise the different energy-saving mechanisms and
    the WSN requirements they directly influence. For example, we can see that energy-efficient
    routing solutions can improve the robustness by using multipath routing protocols
    that provide alternative paths in case of a node failure. Table 4. Interdependence
    between energy-efficient mechanisms and applications requirements. Furthermore,
    in Table 5, we link Tables 1 (which represents the applications requirements)
    and 4 (which represents the interdependence between energy-efficient mechanisms
    and other requirements) in order to show how some energy-efficient techniques
    can be used in specific applications to jointly optimise multiple criteria. Here
    is an example to explain how to read Table 5: in agricultural applications, sleep/wakeup
    schemes can influence the coverage by using topology control mechanisms. The justification
    of these statements can be found in Table 4, and more generally in the discussions
    in Section 4. Table 5. Applications and energy-efficient mechanisms. Given the
    interdependence between the different design goals, it is thus necessary to develop
    solutions that can achieve a satisfactory trade-off between multiple requirements.
    For this reason, in the next section we will review how research attempts to satisfy
    multiple objectives including network lifetime maximisation. 5. Energy efficiency
    and requirements trade-offs In this section, we present the different techniques
    explored in the literature to achieve trade-offs between multiple objectives in
    wireless sensor networks, including energy saving. We have classified these solutions
    into three categories: Multi-metric protocols, Cross-layer approaches and Multi-objective
    optimisation. 5.1. Multimetric protocols As discussed in Section 2, several applications
    require the optimisation of multiple parameters, like delay and security, while
    reducing energy consumption. Multi-metric protocols use various network measurements
    to satisfy multiple application needs. For example, recent application-specific
    routing protocols have proposed to combine energy efficiency with QoS requirements
    [122], [123], [124] or security concerns [125]. These research works consider
    the energy reserves of nodes along with video distortion, packet error rate or
    node reputation. However, this kind of multi-metric protocols raises new challenges.
    The protocols usually rely on a weight function of various metrics and the weight
    adjustments are often made following a trial-and-error methodology. Moreover,
    multimetric protocols require the definition of comprehensive metrics and their
    maintenance in each node which induces supplementary control message exchange.
    For instance, the quality of a link can only be estimated statically through RSSI
    (Received Signal Strength Indication), LQI (Link Quality Indicator) or Packet
    Rate Reception indicators and varies over time. Thus, these techniques suffer
    from extra overheads, but on the other hand they enable adaptability to network
    condition changes to be improved because node decisions are based on metrics whose
    evolution reflects the network status. Below we present some multi-metric protocols
    with energy-efficient considerations. In ATSR (Ambient Trust Sensor Routing) [126]
    the routing decisions are made locally based on a weight function which takes
    into account the residual energy of neighbouring nodes, location and trust. The
    trust evaluation of a neighbour uses seven security metrics such as node reputation,
    authentication and message integrity in order to detect malicious nodes. The protocol
    requires additional control messages to evaluate the energy of the neighbouring
    nodes, and trust levels and weights have to be adjusted to trade off security
    and energy. The enhanced real-time routing protocol with load distribution (ERTLD)
    [127] is a real-time routing protocol for mobile wireless sensor networks which
    makes optimal forwarding decisions based on RSSI, remaining power, and packet
    delay over one hop. ERTLD can deliver packets within their end-to-end deadlines
    while improving the flexibility as it can avoid the problem of routing holes.
    Moreover, it has a higher delivery ratio and consumes less energy than state-of-the-art
    solutions. Kandris et al. [122] have proposed a hierarchical routing protocol
    called PEMuR (Power Efficient Multimedia Routing) which is devoted to video routing
    over a stationary WMSN while satisfying both energy efficiency and QoS requirements.
    In this solution, the CH selects the path to the base station (BS) whose remaining
    energy after transmission will be the highest among all of the possible paths.
    If there is not enough available bandwidth, a CH can choose to drop less significant
    packets according to their impact on the overall video distortion. PEMuR is well-suited
    to surveillance applications, traffic control and battlefield monitoring. However,
    cluster formation is a centralised procedure thus it creates additional overheads:
    each node sends information about its remaining energy and location to the BS.
    InRout [124] addresses route selection for industrial wireless sensor networks
    to provide high reliability while considering the limited resources of sensor
    nodes. The solution uses Q-learning to select the best possible route online,
    based on current network conditions and application settings. A node will choose
    the route that maximises its reward with regard to Packet Error Rate (PER) and
    energy. 5.2. Cross Layer approaches Much research has been conducted to tackle
    energy consumption at all layers, especially at the network, MAC and physical
    layers. It is expected that an integrated cross-layer design can significantly
    improve energy efficiency as well as adaptability to dynamic environments. Indeed,
    cross-layer solutions exploit interactions between different layers to optimise
    network performances, as surveyed in [128], [129]. Sensor requirements (QoS, routing,
    lifetime, security, etc.) are closely linked and require a comprehensive study
    of existing trade-offs. Cross-layer solutions enable the problem’s interdependence
    to be tackled. As a concrete example, it is possible to monitor the battery level
    at the physical layer and use this information at the MAC layer to fairly assign
    communication slots to the nodes. Similarly, it is possible to consider the graph
    of interference when routing data to optimise the transmission delay. Topology
    changes are likely to occur in WSNs and may benefit from a cross-layer approach.
    For instance, after node addition or removal, the neighbourhood is modified which
    influences network density and interference at the physical layer. Thus, it may
    be necessary to reallocate the slots or to change the contention window accordingly
    at the MAC layer while creating different opportunities for path selection at
    the routing layer. Regarding energy efficiency, practices that are generally adopted
    at each layer to save energy such as cluster formation, sleep/active scheduling
    and power control, are jointly exploited in cross-layer solutions. For example,
    Gao et al. [130] took advantage of cooperative communication, hierarchical architectures
    and data aggregation to enhance energy balance among nodes. Chang and Chang [131]
    combined node placement, topology control and MAC scheduling to better balance
    energy consumption. Transmission power control and sleep/wakeup scheduling are
    exploited jointly by Liu et al. [132]. Regarding the optimisation of competing
    metrics, [133] address joint routing, MAC and physical layer protocols for power
    allocation in cooperative communication sensor networks under a specified packet-error-rate
    (PER). Cuomo et al. [134] propose an energy efficient algorithm for PAN coordinator
    election in IEEE 802.15.4-based sensor networks. They combine the network formation
    procedure defined at the MAC layer by the standard with a topology reconfiguration
    algorithm operating at the network layer. By minimising the height of the cluster-tree,
    their algorithm can reduce the delay and extend the network lifetime. Almalkawi
    et al. [135] propose a cross-layer design between the routing and MAC layers.
    Their cluster-based routing protocol balances the load between nodes by constructing
    several paths based on signal strength and hop counts. In the TDMA-based MAC protocol,
    the cluster head adaptively assigns slots to active nodes based on the traffic
    type. Their solution reduces energy consumption and delay, and achieves high throughput
    and packet delivery ratios by selecting paths with better link quality and by
    avoiding collisions and interference. 5.3. Multi-objective optimisation Multi-objective
    optimisation aims at optimising multiple objective functions simultaneously. Nevertheless,
    for non-trivial Multi-objective Optimisation Problems (MOPs), no single solution
    exists that simultaneously optimises each objective function. In this case, the
    objective functions are said to be conflicting, and there are a (possibly infinite)
    number of Pareto-optimal solutions. In MOPs it is preferable to obtain a diverse
    set of candidate solutions that correspond to different trade-off points between
    the extreme solutions. To achieve multi-objective optimisation in wireless sensor
    networks, several solutions exploit evolutionary algorithm (EA) principles or
    game theoretic approaches. The Evolutionary algorithm approach uses mechanisms
    inspired by biological evolution, such as survival of the fittest, reproduction,
    mutation, selection, competition and symbiosis. Candidate solutions represent
    individuals in a population. Each individual possesses a set of distinct characteristics
    and the fitness function determines the fitness of each individual. Generation
    after generation, the best-fit individuals are selected for reproduction to give
    new ones (called offspring). Offspring can be mutated and are then evaluated.
    The fittest individuals are selected to go into the next generation, and the rest
    are eliminated. Xue et al. [136] propose a multi-objective differential evolution
    (MODE) algorithm that produces multiple candidate routes that represent different
    possible trade-offs between energy consumption and communication latency. In [137],
    Konstandinidis et al. develop a multi-objective decomposition-based algorithm
    called DPAP that gives the location and transmit power of each node so that the
    coverage and the lifetime are simultaneously optimised. In [138], the author applies
    an evolutionary Multi-Objective Crowding Algorithm (EMOCA) to solve the sensor
    placement problem in a WSN target detection application. The aim is to maximise
    the probability of target detection, while minimising the total energy dissipated
    in the network and minimising the total number of sensors deployed. Game theoretic
    approaches have been successfully applied for a variety of applications in WSNs,
    as surveyed in [139], [140]. Game theory provides the designer with a useful tool
    to model the competitive and distributed nature of sensor networks. The solutions
    exploit rational interactions between nodes or entities, where incentives (such
    as token or reputation) are used to motivate the players to cooperate instead
    of acting selfishly (e.g. not relaying data to conserve energy). Felegyhazi et
    al. [141] foster packet forwarding cooperation between sensors that belong to
    different authorities. The authority gains a payoff that corresponds to the difference
    between the benefit of data successfully received by the sink and the energy costs
    experimented by its sensors for relaying both its own and opponents’ packets.
    Their results show that cooperation through mutual service provisioning is beneficial,
    particularly for sparse networks or hostile environments where the sinks are shared
    between authorities. In [142], Zeydan et al. introduce the CAR (Correlation-aware
    routing) solution to construct data gathering routes aimed at minimising the energy
    per symbol by exploiting aggregation in correlated data. Every route is associated
    with a cost that reflects its energy consumption, interference, and aggregation
    rate. At each iteration, every node investigates the utility associated with all
    possible paths and then selects the best response that maximises the utility.
    There are many studies that deal with multi-objective optimisation, but their
    practical implementation could consume a lot of resources, which may not be suitable
    for sensor networks. Indeed, solutions that require heavy computational or storage
    capabilities are suitable for centralised computations carried out by a base station.
    On the other hand, solutions that require less computations and storage are convenient
    for distributed computations carried out at each node [143]. Thus, when considering
    MOO solutions, it should be investigated whether or not they are applicable to
    real WSNs since these approaches may be hard to compute on sensor nodes. Typically,
    the major weakness of the evolutionary approach is that the optimisation process
    is performed in a central server and requires global knowledge of the network
    at each node or at the base station. It can lead to scalability issues as the
    network size increases. 5.4. Discussion In this section, a classification is provided
    of solutions proposed in the literature to satisfy multiple objectives. We can
    distinguish the aforementioned techniques based on the flexibility of the obtained
    trade-off over time. By flexibility we mean that the trade-off may change over
    the time depending on the network conditions. For instance, multi-metric protocols
    usually specify a desired trade-off between the requirements at the conception
    phase when setting the parameters. Preference is given to a requirement by the
    designer. For this reason, even if the requirements are highly dependent, the
    trade-off is decided once and for all. In contrast, MOO solutions explore a variety
    of candidate solutions at run-time that represent different trade-off points of
    the design space. Generation after generation, behaviour policy evolves and is
    adjusted to the network dynamics. In-between, cross-layer approaches are expected
    to improve network performances by exploiting the interactions between layers.
    The downside is the complexity of the method that necessitates a good understanding
    of the interplay of various variables. 6. Conclusion In the last decade, we have
    witnessed a proliferation of potential application domains of wireless sensor
    networks. These applications include, but are not limited to, life-critical healthcare
    surveillance, large-scale precision agriculture, security-oriented industrial
    process monitoring and nation-wide smart grid systems. In this paper, we surveyed
    the recent advances in the development of energy-efficient solutions for WSNs
    while taking into consideration the other application requirements. We first categorised
    the different WSN applications and we identified their specific requirements.
    Then we introduced a new taxonomy of energy conservation schemes and we provided
    the reader with a comprehensive analysis of how these techniques can affect performance
    of applications. We finally reviewed some existing methods that allow trade-offs
    between multiple requirements to be achieved for efficient and sustainable sensor
    networks. Acknowledgments The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers

    \ to provide farmers with a\nlarge amount of information. Precision agriculture\
    \ (PA) is a management strategy that employs\ninformation technology to improve\
    \ quality and production. Utilizing wireless sensor technologies\nand management\
    \ tools can lead to a highly effective, green agriculture. Based on PA management,\n\
    the same routine to a crop regardless of site environments can be avoided. From\
    \ several perspectives,\nﬁeld management can improve PA, including the provision\
    \ of adequate nutrients for crops and the\nwastage of pesticides for the effective\
    \ control of weeds, pests, and diseases. This review outlines the\nrecent applications\
    \ of WSNs in agriculture research as well as classiﬁes and compares various wireless\n\
    communication protocols, the taxonomy of energy-efﬁcient and energy harvesting\
    \ techniques for\nWSNs that can be used in agricultural monitoring systems, and\
    \ comparison between early research\nworks on agriculture-based WSNs. The challenges\
    \ and limitations of WSNs in the agricultural domain\nare explored, and several\
    \ power reduction and agricultural management techniques for long-term\nmonitoring\
    \ are highlighted. These approaches may also increase the number of opportunities\
    \ for\nprocessing Internet of Things (IoT) data.\nKeywords: energy-efﬁcient; energy\

    1. Introduction\nWireless sensor network (WSN) technologies have rapidly developed\
    \ over the years. Ecological\nphenomena in a vast area can be monitored using\
    \ pervasive devices called motes or sensor nodes.\nBattery-powered WSNs comprise\
    \ several sensors, processors, and radio frequency (RF) modules.\nThe sensor nodes\
    \ or motes can communicate wirelessly through a communication link and forward\n\
    their data to a base station or coordinator node by communicating with a gateway.\
    \ The communication\namong sensor nodes depends on the merging of diverse sensors\
    \ from simple (i.e., humidity, pressure,\nand temperature) to complex (i.e., localization,\
    \ tracking, micro-radars, and images), thereby allowing\nWSNs to monitor a wide\
    \ range of surroundings to obtain precise information from the ﬁeld [1].\nAccordingly,\
    \ the sensing, storage, processing, and communication capabilities of sensor nodes\
    \ have\ncontinuously increased [2].\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781; doi:10.3390/s17081781\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n2 of 45\nWSNs have been\
    \ used in different applications, such as military, agriculture, sports, medicine,\
    \ and\nindustry. Agriculture can be considered as one of the most favorable facilities\
    \ for WSNs to improve\nfood crop yields and minimize the burden of farmers [3].\
    \ Several projects have been introduced in\nthe precision agriculture (PA) literature.\
    \ PA aims to prevent the application of the same management\nroutine to a crop\
    \ regardless of site circumstances and to improve ﬁeld management from several\n\
    perspectives. For instance, PA can minimize the wastage of pesticides for the\
    \ effective control of weeds,\npests, and diseases as well as guarantee that crops\
    \ receive an adequate amount of nutrients, thereby\nleading to a highly effective,\
    \ green agriculture. Speciﬁcally, PA is a management strategy that employs\ninformation\
    \ technology to improve agricultural quality and production. PA differs for traditional\n\
    farming in the sense that this process accurately identiﬁes variations and relates\
    \ the spatial data to\nmanagement activities. PA involves ﬁve stages, namely,\
    \ (i) data collection, (ii) diagnosis, (iii) data\nanalysis, (iv) precision ﬁeld\
    \ operation, and (v) evaluation [4].\nWSNs are used as cost-effective processes\
    \ to increase agricultural yield. Accordingly, WSNs have\nbeen used in different\
    \ agricultural applications, such as for monitoring climate and using soil nutrient\n\
    data to forecast the health of crops and the quality of agricultural products.\
    \ Irrigation planning can\nbe predicted using WSNs by observing weather conditions\
    \ (such as temperature and humidity) and\nsoil moisture. Other sensor nodes can\
    \ be added to the existing WSN to improve the parameters of the\nagricultural\
    \ monitoring system and to make the network scalable. However, some challenges\
    \ have\nhindered the agricultural application of WSNs, such as determining optimum\
    \ deployment schemes,\nmeasurement periods, routing protocols, energy efﬁciency,\
    \ cost, communication range, scalability, and\nfault tolerance [5]. For example,\
    \ the scattered deployment of sensor nodes with a long data-gathering\nperiod\
    \ can help extend the network lifetime. However, some factors may challenge the\
    \ selection of the\ndistribution region. When the agricultural ﬁeld faces many\
    \ obstacles, the communication link may\nbe weakened or lost as a result of signal\
    \ attenuation. The sensor nodes in WSNs are supplied from\nthe battery, thereby\
    \ preventing connections to the main supply in the deployment location. Reducing\n\
    power depletion and prolonging battery life are imperative for WSNs considering\
    \ their limited battery\npower. Although the application of WSNs has increased\
    \ constantly over the years, the manufacturing\nof batteries has not developed\
    \ at the same rate [6]. Therefore, WSNs are mainly limited by their\nbatteries\
    \ [7]. Among the aforementioned challenges, this paper focuses on energy management\
    \ and\nhighlights energy-efﬁcient and energy harvesting techniques that can be\
    \ used in agriculture.\nTo fulﬁll PA requirements, such as addressing the problems\
    \ resulting from the long distance\nbetween farms and base stations, a mobile\
    \ data connection service can be established by connecting\nunmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ or drones with the base station [4]. Such connection allows the sensor nodes\n\
    to relay their data to the base station within the wide area of the farm ﬁeld.\
    \ However, this solution is\nlimited by the quality of service of WSNs.\nThe main\
    \ contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n(i)\nThe potential of\
    \ using wireless communications protocols or technologies in agriculture was\n\
    investigated, and the technology with the best power consumption and communication\
    \ distance\nwas identiﬁed.\n(ii)\nThe taxonomy of energy-efﬁcient and energy harvesting\
    \ techniques was examined to address the\npower consumption problems in agriculture\
    \ and to identify those methods that are most suitable\nfor solving these problems.\n\
    (iii)\nThe existing solutions, applicability, and limitations of applying WSNs\
    \ in agriculture were\nreviewed and compared.\n(iv)\nRecent studies using WSN\
    \ in PA applications based on Internet of Things (IoT) were surveyed\nand compared\
    \ in terms of type of sensors and actuators, IoT end devices, IoT platforms, and\
    \ IoT\napplication layer.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n3 of 45\n2. Wireless Communication\
    \ Technologies for Agriculture\nThis section presents the different wireless protocols\
    \ and standards that are used in agriculture.\nThese wireless technologies are\
    \ also compared to identify the most convenient technology in terms of\npower\
    \ consumption and communication range, where the two metrics are posed challenges\
    \ in current\nsolution of agriculture application [5,8]. IoT is a revolution for\
    \ the future realm where everything\nthat can utilize a connection will be connected.\
    \ Cellular technologies are grown and developed to\nplay a crucial role in the\
    \ IoT realm [9]. Narrowband-IoT (NB-IoT) is a new IoT system constructed\nfrom\
    \ current Long Term Evolution (LTE) functionalities. Subsequently, NB-IoT is possible\
    \ to share the\nspectrum of LTE without coexistence problems and to utilize the\
    \ same pieces of equipment, as well\nas it is possible to connect seamlessly into\
    \ the LTE main network. This permits all network facilities\nsuch as security,\
    \ tracking, policy, charging, and authentication to be totally supported [10].\
    \ The design\ngoals of NB-IoT cover high coverage area, extended battery life\
    \ (i.e., 10 years), high network size\n(52,000 devices/channel/cell), and low-cost\
    \ devices [10,11]. However, in the near future, NB-IoT\ntechnologies, such as\
    \ Long Range radio (LoRa) will take place in agricultural applications due to\
    \ low\npower consumption and preferably used when the agricultural information\
    \ are to be transmitted over\nlong distances.\n2.1. ZigBee Wireless Protocol\n\
    ZigBee wireless protocol is considered one of the best candidate technologies\
    \ for the agriculture\nand farming domains. Given its low duty cycle, ZigBee is\
    \ considered appropriate for PA applications,\nsuch as irrigation supervision\
    \ [12], water quality management, and fertilizer and pesticide control,\nall of\
    \ which require a cyclic information update. Based on this technology, the sensor\
    \ nodes in the\nagricultural ﬁeld can communicate with the router or coordinator\
    \ node over a long range (i.e., 100 m)\nwhen XBee Series 2 is used. ZigBee can\
    \ also reduce the communication distance by up to 30 m for\nindoor conditions\
    \ (i.e., greenhouses) [13]. The number of deployed sensor and router nodes will\
    \ be\nincreased to cover the entire ﬁeld area under surveillance. Some studies\
    \ have employed Zigbee for PA.\nFor instance, ZigBee was used to investigate the\
    \ effect of signal strength on node spacing, base station\nantenna height, and\
    \ leaf density [14]. In [14], three experiments were conducted in palm orchards\
    \ in\nto evaluate a signal propagation model based on the received signal strength\
    \ indicator (RSSI) of the\nZigBee wireless protocol. Through their experiments,\
    \ the authors concluded that the wireless channel\npropagation model must be determined\
    \ before deploying the sensor nodes in palm orchards to obtain\nrobust signal\
    \ strength characteristics. A path loss model in a mango greenhouse was investigated\n\
    based on the ZigBee wireless protocol [15].\nA cattle-localization-system-based\
    \ ZigBee WSN was also applied in a grazing ﬁeld [16]. Instead of\nrequiring additional\
    \ hardware, ZigBee relies on link quality indication (LQI) to measure distance.\
    \ The\nZigBee protocol achieves cattle localization at a low power consumption\
    \ and minimum cost. The key\nparameters of greenhouse climate (i.e., humidity,\
    \ temperature, CO2, and solar radiation) are considered\nin [17] to ensure the\
    \ comfortable growth of plants with 22% energy savings and 33% water usage.\n\
    ZigBee and Global System for Mobile communication/General Packet Radio Service\
    \ (GSM/GPRS)\ntechnologies were used to monitor and control the climate condition\
    \ of greenhouses [17]. The ZigBee\nwireless protocol has also been used to monitor\
    \ animal behavior (e.g., walking, grazing, lying down,\nand standing) [18]. ZigBee\
    \ was also adopted in [18] to overcome the high power consumption and\nunreliability\
    \ issues in mobile ad hoc WSNs.\nA WSN-based greenhouse that uses ZigBee star\
    \ topology is merged with artiﬁcial intelligence\n(i.e., fuzzy logic controller)\
    \ in [19]. The ZigBee wireless protocol is adopted to preserve energy by\nswitching\
    \ between active and sleep states. Thus, power consumption can be minimized, and\
    \ the\nbattery lifetime of sensor nodes can be extended. ZigBee is currently applied\
    \ in smart beehives [20],\norange orchards [21], dairy healthcare monitoring of\
    \ cows in pastures and barns [22], automation in\nirrigation [23], greenhouse\
    \ monitoring systems [24,25], and livestock monitoring [26]. As a universal\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 1781\n4 of 45\nstandard for WSNs, the ZigBee protocol was used\
    \ in several agricultural applications because of its\nlow power consumption,\
    \ low cost, self-forming characteristics, and suitable communication range.\n\
    2.2. Bluetooth (BT) Wireless Protocol\nThe BT standard has been utilized to establish\
    \ a communication link between movable and\nportable devices, such as laptops,\
    \ over a short distance of up to 10 m. Given its pervasive nature\nand availability\
    \ in most mobile devices, BT has been employed to satisfy multi-level agricultural\n\
    requirements [5].\nWeather information, soil moisture, sprinkler position, and\
    \ temperature are\nmonitored remotely using Global Positioning System (GPS) and\
    \ BT technologies. The proposed\nsystem in [27] was developed for irrigation application\
    \ to increase ﬁeld productivity and conserve\nwater. The irrigation application\
    \ proposed in [28] collects ﬁeld information in real time via the BT\nwireless\
    \ communication protocol. Several software and hardware were developed in [29]\
    \ to monitor\nthe relative humidity and temperature in greenhouses based on BT.\
    \ The BT module was employed in\nintegrated control method [30] to control the\
    \ irrigation system in greenhouses based on soil and weather\ninformation, and\
    \ this technology improved the leaf number, height, dry weight, and fresh weight\n\
    of red and romaine lettuce in greenhouses. Result of estimation for water usage\
    \ and electricity also\nimproved by 90% based on integrated control method using\
    \ BT technology relative to the traditional\nmethod (i.e., timer control strategy).\
    \ Given its low energy consumption, wide availability, and ease of\nuse for farmers,\
    \ smartphone-based BT has been employed in different agricultural applications\
    \ [31–35],\nsuch as controlling irrigation systems, monitoring soil and weather\
    \ conditions, and controlling the use\nof fertilizers and pesticides.\n2.3. WiFi\
    \ Wireless Protocol\nWiFi is currently the most extensively utilized wireless\
    \ technology available in portable devices,\nincluding tablets, smartphones, laptops,\
    \ and desktops. WiFi has a suitable communication distance of\nabout 20 m and\
    \ 100 m in indoor and outdoor environments, respectively. In PA applications,\
    \ WiFi\nextends diverse architectures by connecting several types of devices via\
    \ an ad hoc network. WiFi and\n3G wireless technologies were employed in [36]\
    \ to estimate the agricultural applications of mobile\nphones. Remote access and\
    \ short message services have also been used for controlling and monitoring\n\
    protected crops. In [37], agricultural data, such as soil temperature, soil moisture,\
    \ weather temperature\nand humidity, sunlight intensity, and CO2, were stored\
    \ in a gateway before they were transmitted\nto the server computer over a WiFi\
    \ network. A Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11g)-based smart WSN is proposed\nfor agricultural\
    \ monitoring in [38]. The proposed system consists of three nodes: sensor, router,\
    \ and\nserver. The climate conditions of the greenhouse or agricultural ﬁeld,\
    \ such as humidity, temperature,\nair pressure, light, water level, and soil moisture,\
    \ are monitored. The said work attempts to lower cost,\nminimize wiring connections,\
    \ and enhance the mobility and ﬂexibility of the sensing points in WSN.\nHowever,\
    \ the energy consumption of the proposed system is extremely high at 42.17 J/h.\n\
    Given that WiFi requires much power [5], long communication time, and huge data\
    \ payload [26].\nWiFi technology is not preferable for agricultural applications\
    \ in spite of the fact that a Wi-Fi server\nprevents data losses by adopting data\
    \ redundancy techniques. In addition, WiFi cannot be employed\nfor multi-hope\
    \ applications and inﬂuenced by number of users and the signal intensity; thereby,\n\
    it is inappropriate for agriculture WSNs. Moreover, the WiFi nodes listen all\
    \ the time, so power\nconsumption will increase [39].\n2.4. GPRS/3G/4G Technology\n\
    General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) is a packet data service for GSM-based cellular\
    \ phones.\nGPRS frequently experiences variable delays and throughputs, and such\
    \ technology depends on the\nvolume of consumers that share the same communication\
    \ channels and resources. Gutiérrez et al. [40]\nused the GPRS module and WSN\
    \ to develop an automatic crop irrigation system based on the\ninformation collected\
    \ by temperature and soil moisture sensors installed at the root zone of plants,\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 1781\n5 of 45\nand considered this system a cost-effective and\
    \ practical solution for improving water quality in\nPA. A drip irrigation process\
    \ was evaluated in [41] by measuring soil moisture. A prototype system\nwas also\
    \ developed based on a data management server and a WSN-GPRS gateway. WSN-GPRS\n\
    gateway acts as a bridge between WSN and GPRS where the data from the WSN are\
    \ transferred to a\ndata management center. Navarro-Hellín et al. [42] equipped\
    \ various wireless nodes with GPRS to\nmeasure and transmit soil, plant, and atmosphere\
    \ information. The wireless nodes have unlimited\nautonomy because of their independent\
    \ nature and use of solar energy. Different sensors may transmit\ninformation\
    \ to a remote location via a GPRS network for further analysis by using tablets,\
    \ mobile\nphones, or computers. All agriculture sensors are interfaced to the\
    \ sensor board to obtain agricultural\ninformation. Such information is transmitted\
    \ to the remote server for further analysis through the\nGPRS-board, which depends\
    \ on a GSM/GPRS mobile network.\n2.5. Long Range Radio (LoRa) Protocol\nLoRa is\
    \ introduced by the LoRa Alliance as a protocol stack for low power and wide area\
    \ Internet\nof Things (IoT) communication technologies that are associated with\
    \ indoor transmission [43]. The\nbasic network architecture of a LoRaWAN consists\
    \ of LoRa end devices, LoRa gateways, and a LoRa\nnetwork server. The LoRa end\
    \ device communicates with gateways that employ LoRa with LoRaWAN.\nLoRa gateways\
    \ pass raw LoRaWAN packets from the end devices to a LoRa network server with\n\
    a high throughput based on the backhaul interface, which is typically 3G or Ethernet.\
    \ Accordingly,\nLoRa gateways act as a bidirectional communication or protocol\
    \ adapter with the LoRa network\nserver. In this case, the LoRa network server\
    \ takes charge of decoding the data packets transmitted by\nthe LoRa devices and\
    \ creating the frames that would be directed back to the devices. LoRa offers\
    \ a\nbidirectional solution that matches machine-to-machine (M2M) WiFi or cellular\
    \ technologies. LoRa\npresents a cost-effective method for linking batteries or\
    \ mobile devices to the network or to end devices.\nThe LoRa wireless protocol\
    \ was used in [44] to monitor bee colonies in rural areas and to ensure a\ncommunication\
    \ between the bee node and the local server that is located in a remote location.\
    \ The\nsoil moisture and temperature, air temperature and humidity, and light\
    \ intensity inside greenhouses\nwere also monitored using different sensors, microcontrollers,\
    \ and the LoRa wireless protocol [8]. The\nLoRa gateway collects data from LoRa\
    \ nodes to construct the topology of a star network, and may\ncommunicate with\
    \ a cloud server over a long communication range and with high scalability.\n\
    LoRa was recently utilized in several agriculture research projects developed\
    \ by the Libelium\nCompany (Zaragoza, Spain) [45], such as improving kiwi production\
    \ based on a smart irrigation system\n(Italy), monitoring of green areas by using\
    \ a smart garden system (Spain), improving fertilization\nmethods of corn yields\
    \ (Italy), improving production of banana yields (Colombia), increasing\ntobacco\
    \ crops by controlling the climate condition (Italy), saving water through a smart\
    \ irrigation\nsystem (Barcelona), monitoring of vineyard crops (Spain), and monitoring\
    \ of diseases that affect\nvineyards (Switzerland).\n2.6. SigFox Protocol\nSigFox\
    \ is an ultra-narrowband wireless cellular network [43] with low data rate applications,\n\
    thereby making this technology appropriate for IoT and machine-type communications\
    \ systems.\nSigFox has been used in different applications, including telephone,\
    \ security, mobile, broadband, and\ntelevision. The SigFox network was used in\
    \ [46,47] to construct a geolocation system that localizes\nanimals in mountain\
    \ pastures throughout the summer. A system was proposed in [46] to help farmers\n\
    locate their cattle and enhance their production. The importance of power consumption\
    \ analyses was\nhighlighted in [47], especially when the cattle are located in\
    \ high mountainous areas.\n2.7. Performance Comparison of Wireless Communication\
    \ Protocols\nTable 1 compares the aforementioned wireless communication protocols\
    \ or technologies relative\nto different parameters, including power consumption,\
    \ communication range, data rate, cost, system\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n6 of 45\n\
    complexity, and other parameters. The challenges in agricultural applications\
    \ may be developed from\nthe selection of the deployment range. For instance,\
    \ the transmitted signal by the sensor node is\nattenuated when the agriculture\
    \ ﬁeld is separated by obstacles. Power consumption is considered as\nanother\
    \ limitation in the WSN design in agricultural applications [5]. The ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol was\ndesigned to run with a suitable communication range and low power\
    \ consumption. LoRa and SigFox\nare considered to work with low power consumption\
    \ and long radio range. Accordingly, the power\nconsumption and communication\
    \ distance of the above technologies have been assessed as follows.\nZigbee and\
    \ Bluetooth low energy (BLE) are designed for battery-powered devices.\nThese\n\
    technologies conserve power through low duty cycling and enter sleep mode to extend\
    \ the battery\nlifetime. Classic BT, WiFi, GPRS, LoRa, and SigFox have a higher\
    \ power consumption than ZigBee.\nAlthough ZigBee has a shorter communication\
    \ range than LoRa, SigFox, and GPRS, this range may be\nextended with a router\
    \ node to overcome the node deployment limitations in agricultural applications.\n\
    BLE outperforms ZigBee in terms of power consumption, but this wireless protocol\
    \ is limited in\nagricultural applications because of its short communication\
    \ distance of 10 m, as reported in [48].\nZigBee also has a higher network elasticity\
    \ than BT, thereby permitting various topologies. Given the\nlarge number of nodes\
    \ (more than 65,000) in the ZigBee network, the ZigBee technology can be used\n\
    to cover a wide agricultural. Accordingly, the ZigBee wireless protocol has been\
    \ adopted in many\nagriculture studies [5,49–53]. One of these studies [5] prefers\
    \ to utilize ZigBee in farming domains and\nagricultural applications owing to\
    \ its energy-efﬁcient, reliable, and low-cost wireless protocol.\nThe LoRa wireless\
    \ protocol covers a large communication area with low power consumption.\nTherefore,\
    \ it can be suitably deployed in vast agricultural ﬁelds. The network size of\
    \ the LoRa protocol\nis limited by its duty cycle, where a 1% duty cycle can lead\
    \ to a maximum communication time of 36 s\nper hour for each end device [54].\
    \ In addition, LoRa gateways have a limited message capacity of less\nthan 100\
    \ messages per minute because of the unplanned deployment of LoRa gateways in\
    \ urban areas,\nthereby interfering with low power wireless area networks, such\
    \ as SigFox. Therefore, increasing the\nnumber of gateways can challenge the infrastructure\
    \ of the LoRa network [54]. Moreover, the LoRa\ntechnology is complex and has\
    \ sizable hardware implementations [55].\nSigFox has an extremely low data rate\
    \ (100 bps) and slow transmission time (10 s for 10 bytes)\ncompared with ZigBee\
    \ and LoRa [56]. SigFox supports star topology supervised by a centralized sever\n\
    that manages connectivity between devices and the base stations, whereas the LoRa\
    \ supports wide\narea network based on star-to-star topology creating a bridge\
    \ of LoRa gateways. Given that data rate\nand transmission time are both critical\
    \ issue in any communication system, SigFox cannot be widely\nused for agricultural\
    \ applications. Moreover, this technology does not support the collision avoidance\n\
    scheme, thereby affecting the network because several M2M devices may be operated\
    \ in the same\narea. Moreover, SigFox has a limited reliability because of its\
    \ one-way communication (without an\nacknowledgment signal) and low received power.\
    \ However, both the LoRa and SigFox infrastructures\nare still in progress. Ali\
    \ et al. further discuss the limitations of these protocols [56].\nFrom the above\
    \ discussion and the comparison results presented in Table 1 and Figure 1\nand\
    \ as will be shown in Tables 2–8 the ZigBee and LoRa wireless protocols have been\
    \ identiﬁed\nas the most suitable wireless protocols for agricultural applications\
    \ because of their low power\nconsumption, communication range (acceptable for\
    \ ZigBee and long for LoRa), small size, easy\nnetwork implementation, simplicity,\
    \ low latency (for ZigBee), scalability, and network size.\nSensors 2017, 17,\

    \ discuss the limitations of these protocols [56].  \nFrom the above discussion\

    \ and other information technologies,\npotentially permits manufacturers to computerize\
    \ site-speciﬁc management for automated agriculture.\nIn terms of precision, the\
    \ considered wireless protocols for agricultural applications have improved\n\
    the agriculture domain. Precision irrigation is frequently regarded as optimizing\
    \ irrigation accuracy\ndue to its ability to control the optimum amount of water\
    \ and irrigation time. The water savings\nof 90% (based on ZigBee), 33% (based\
    \ on ZigBee), 50% (based on Bluetooth), and 90% (based on\nBluetooth) were achieved\
    \ for precision irrigation systems relative to traditional irrigation systems\
    \ in\nresearch [17,28,30,40], respectively. Animal behavior, such as laying down,\
    \ standing, grazing, walking,\nand other modes, was monitored in [18] using ZigBee\
    \ wireless protocol. The authors found that\nlaying down and grazing could be\
    \ improved by 83.5% compared with the ﬁndings from similar\nstudies. In another\
    \ study that has adopted a proposed algorithm that depended on the ZigBee wireless\n\
    protocol [20], an accuracy rate of 95.4% was expected for the proposed algorithm\
    \ to monitor the\nhoney bee and the agricultural and environmental aspects. In\
    \ [23], the automation of the irrigation\nsystem based on ZigBee saved the system\
    \ cost between 1.24% and 6.72% relative to the entire cost\nof the water user\
    \ associations, with energy savings of 2.05 to 8.21% and water savings of 0.71\
    \ to\n6.46%. The proposed model in [35] utilized a smartphone platform (based\
    \ on Bluetooth and GSM\ntechnologies) and permitted three types of irrigation\
    \ systems. The efﬁciency factors were improved\nby 90% for subsurface drip type\
    \ and 85% and 75% for high- and low-pressure overhead sprinkler\ntypes, respectively,\
    \ to compute for drift and evaporation before the water droplets approached the\n\
    soil. 3G technology was adopted by Libelium based on Waspmote wireless sensor\
    \ devices to monitor\nthe vineyards in Northwest Spain [57]. Phytosanitary treatments,\
    \ such as fungicides and fertilizers,\nwere minimized by 20% and growing yields\
    \ were enhanced by 15% based on PA. In [8], LoRa wireless\nprotocol was considered\
    \ to monitor the agriculture environments with 90% power efﬁciency. The cost\n\
    of pumping and water for precision irrigation system in green areas was reduced\
    \ by 30% based on\nSigFox wireless protocol [58].\nThe preceding survey for different\
    \ agricultural applications revealed that PA can be achieved\nin terms of water\
    \ savings, animal behavior, accuracy, power efﬁciency, and reducing system cost\n\
    for various wireless protocols. Consequently, agriculture can be improved based\
    \ on agricultural\nautomation systems compared with traditional agriculture systems.\n\

    \ may operate at different energy states. Therefore, the lifespan of a sensor\
    \ node is the\ntime consumed to exhaust its batteries under a sustainable operation\
    \ threshold.\nNumerous scholars have developed power reduction techniques to provide\
    \ sensor nodes an\ninﬁnite lifespan. This section reviews several power reduction\
    \ techniques of WSNs that can be used in\nagricultural applications. The purposes,\
    \ wireless protocols, ﬁndings, advantages, and limitations of\neach technique\
    \ are also discussed.\n3.1.1. Sleep/Wake Strategy\nWireless transceivers consume\
    \ a signiﬁcant amount of power relative to processors. The energy\nof the wireless\
    \ nodes is mostly dissipated during the reception and transmission processes.\
    \ The radio\nof sensor nodes can enter sleep mode via the sleep/wake strategy\
    \ to reduce the power consumption\nof the RF components of WSNs. No data communication\
    \ occurs during the sleep mode. The sensor\nnodes wake up to collect and transmit\
    \ data within a certain period and then return to sleep mode\nto conserve energy.\
    \ In agricultural applications, the sleep/wake strategy is implemented via (i)\
    \ duty\ncycling, (ii) medium-access control (MAC) protocols, and (iii) topology\
    \ control.\nDuty cycle is proposed in several studies to lower the power consumption\
    \ for different agricultural\napplications based on WSN. Zhang et al. [69] proposed\
    \ a WSN-based system to monitor soil moisture\nand analyzed the temporal and spatial\
    \ variability of soil moisture for variable irrigation. To reduce the\npower consumption\
    \ of the soil sensor nodes, the soil moisture sensors were always in sleep mode\
    \ and\nactivated only when data were to be collected. Million et al. [70] designed\
    \ a WSN for PA in Malawi\nand called it WiPAM. This system was intended to automate\
    \ irrigation and implement an irrigation\nmanagement system (IMS). The authors\
    \ investigated soil moisture variability. The sensor nodes\nwere homogeneous,\
    \ and each was composed of a ZigBee end device (ZED) and a ZigBee coordinator\n\
    (ZC). In the star topology, three sensors nodes were conﬁgured as ZED (in ﬁeld-nodes)\
    \ and one as a\ngateway node. Another node was conﬁgured as ZC for aggregating\
    \ data and actuating the irrigation\nvalves. The power source to sustain the operation\
    \ of the network was solar power. This approach\nwas complemented by an energy-efﬁcient\
    \ management approach. In other words, sensor nodes went\nto sleep when idle and\
    \ woke up to transmit data when required. The irrigation valves opened or\nclosed\
    \ depending on the values stored in the coordinator node. Ouadjaout et al. [71]\
    \ presented an\nenergy-efﬁcient WSN for soil moisture monitoring in an irrigation\
    \ system. The new platform, DZ50,\nconsists of an RFM12b transceiver and an ATmega328P\
    \ microcontroller. This platform consumes very\nlow power, and much energy can\
    \ be saved in sleep mode, in which the transceiver goes inactive (sleep\nmode)\
    \ for long periods. Comparison showed that the performance of DZ50 is better than\
    \ that of\nTelosB and MicaZ. Speciﬁcally, the battery lifetime of DZ50 is seven\
    \ times that of TelosB and MicaZ\nbased on a 10 s sampling period. Monitoring\
    \ of environmental conditions, such as wind direction,\nwind speed, humidity,\
    \ temperature, conductivity, rain level, pH, and water level, in crop ﬁelds was\n\
    presented in [72]. A solar cell was used to power several sensor nodes deployed\
    \ at a distance of 500 m\nto 5 km. WSNs based on IEEE 802.15.4 (C1120 transceiver)\
    \ and GPRS/3G were adopted to transmit the\nrural environments to the base station.\
    \ Energy was saved through low duty cycling (3.3%) for the RF\ntransceiver; the\
    \ saved energy is equivalent to 30 s of wake up time every 15 min. In addition,\
    \ a 2-watt\nsolar cell was used to supply power to the overall system, whose total\
    \ average power consumption\nwas 207 mW.\nMAC protocols were also proposed in\
    \ previous research on agriculture WSNs [39,73–76].\nSudha et al. [39] proposed\
    \ an energy-efﬁcient TDMA-based algorithm for wireless sensor\ncommunications\
    \ in an automatic irrigation system. Their experiment involved a header node that\n\
    collected data directly from all the nodes in the ﬁeld and passed these data to\
    \ the base station (BS).\nThis network arrangement was a star single-hop topology.\
    \ These techniques attain power savings\nof 10% with a high communication distance\
    \ of 1 km between the sensor node and the base station.\nHowever, when this distance\
    \ increases, the power consumption also increases. López et al. [75]\nproposed\
    \ a WSN for monitoring horticultural yields, which are disseminated among small\
    \ plots\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n11 of 45\nscattered at a communication distance\
    \ of 10 km. The air temperature and soil moisture are collected\nduring a 10-week\
    \ period. The authors adopted the MAC protocol and star topology to conserve the\n\
    power consumption of the sensor nodes that used the IEEE 802.15.4 standard based\
    \ on the CC2420\ntransceiver. The lifetimes of the soil moisture and air temperature\
    \ sensor nodes are 1024 days and\n222 days, respectively, utilizing a battery\
    \ that delivers 2700 mAh.\nThe topology protocol scheme can be used in agricultural\
    \ monitoring WSNs to modify the network\ntopology according to the application\
    \ requirements, thereby reducing the number of active nodes in\na network. Some\
    \ nodes in the network can enter sleep mode to prolong the network lifetime when\n\
    they are not sensing the same area of interest. Aneeth and Jayabarathi [77] implemented\
    \ Ad hoc\nOn-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) and Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocols\
    \ over a different\ntopology of ZigBee WSN (i.e., cluster topology, random topology,\
    \ star topology with gateway based\non two cases; inside and outside) in simulation\
    \ environments by using the OPNET software (Riverbed,\nSan Francisco, CA, USA).\
    \ Twenty soil moisture sensor nodes and one gateway node were distributed\nin\
    \ a farmland with a dimension of 100 × 100 m2. Each node sends information about\
    \ the soil moisture\nto the gateway node through the ZigBee wireless protocol.\
    \ The gateway node passes the information to\nthe controlling system to control\
    \ the irrigation valve system. Their study showed that the star topology\nusing\
    \ DSR protocol reduces the power consumption of the WSN because it has less routing\
    \ overhead\ncompared with AODV protocol. Table 2 shows the comparison of power\
    \ reduction technique based on\nsleep/wake schemes for previous research in agricultural\
    \ applications.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n12 of 45\nTable 2. Sleep/wake schemes\

    \ power is mostly dissipated in the RF components of WSNs than\nin data processing\
    \ units, such as microcontrollers and microprocessors [80]. A number of scholars\n\
    have applied various radio optimization schemes or techniques, including (i) transmission\
    \ power\ncontrol (TPC), (ii) modulation scheme, and (iii) cognitive radio, to\
    \ reduce the power consumption\nof the RF components of agriculture sensor nodes.\
    \ In the TPC scheme, the sensor nodes modify the\ntransmitted power to save energy,\
    \ stimulate avoiding interference, and establish a communication\nlink [81]. TPC\
    \ can be used in the agricultural ﬁeld [82,83], where the RF transmitted power\
    \ of the\nsensor nodes can be modiﬁed to reduce their power consumption based\
    \ on the measured distance\nbetween the sink node and the sensor nodes. Sahota\
    \ et al. [82] have investigated the application of\nTPC in reducing the power\
    \ consumption of the sensor nodes in precision agriculture-based WSNs.\nSeveral\
    \ power levels and different receiver sensitivity levels are considered to perform\
    \ the said process.\nThe network layers and MAC protocol in a WSN (based on CC1110)\
    \ for the agriculture domain are\nadopted to further lower the power consumption\
    \ of the sensor node. Results show that the power\nsaving that employs multiple\
    \ modes of transmitted power can be improved by approximately 10%\nrelative to\
    \ the traditional mode. By contrast, Kamarudin et al. [83] prolonged the lifetime\
    \ of the sensor\nnode by more than 8.5% by modifying the transmitted power of\
    \ the CC2420 communication device.\nA cognitive radio is an intelligent wireless\
    \ communication network [84] in which the wireless\ncommunication channel in the\
    \ spectrum band can be selected efﬁciently [85]. The transmission metrics\n(e.g.,\
    \ transmitted power, carrier frequency, and modulation scheme) can be adjusted\
    \ accordingly.\nA cognitive radio requires more energy than conventional devices\
    \ do because it includes sophisticated\nand complex functions [86]. Therefore,\
    \ an energy-efﬁcient cognitive radio network poses challenges,\nespecially with\
    \ regard to the use of battery energy. In wireless communication, the electromagnetic\n\
    spectrum is fully occupied, with several bands being partially used or unused.\
    \ This situation supports\nthe utilization of a cognitive radio, in which spectrum\
    \ holes can be utilized.\nSabri et al. [19] fused fuzzy logic control (FLC) with\
    \ a ZigBee wireless sensor actor network\n(WSAN), which can sense the surroundings\
    \ and respond in ideal performance without interference\nfrom agricultural crops.\
    \ FLC assists the specialists in managing complex systems more compared with\n\
    traditional control methods, which are ineffective in terms of ﬂexibility, energy,\
    \ productivity, and labor\ninterference. Two signiﬁcant greenhouse environment\
    \ parameters (i.e., humidity and temperature)\nare monitored during daytime and\
    \ nighttime. The results show that the intelligent technique-based\nFLC can signiﬁcantly\
    \ improve the WSAN lifespan. Therefore, the WSAN can work for 14 years with a\n\
    210 mAh battery power based on the FLC merged with WSAN.\nThe power consumption\
    \ of networks can be directly affected by the modulation scheme [87]. The\nmodulation\
    \ parameters can be adjusted to their optimal values to preserve the minimum power\n\
    consumption of radio modules. Anane et al. [88] investigated the Frequency-shift\
    \ keying (FSK) and\nMinimum-shift keying (MSK) modulation strategies to minimize\
    \ the total power consumption of\nthe sensor node required to transmit given data\
    \ packets. Through their extensive study, the authors\nconcluded that MSK outperforms\
    \ FSK in terms of power consumption. However, several modulation\nschemes cannot\
    \ be used in the ZigBee wireless protocol that operates at 2.4 GHz because this\
    \ protocol\nsupports a single modulation scheme. Speciﬁcally, the ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol works with offset\nquadrature phase-shift keying (OQPSK) [89]. Table\

    \ Data Mitigation\nData mitigation presents another power consumption solution\
    \ for agriculture WSNs to reduce the\namount of data transmitted from source nodes\
    \ to destination nodes. Data mitigation can be achieved\nvia (i) data gathering,\
    \ (ii) data comparison, (iii) data rate, and (iv) data-driven techniques.\nData\
    \ gathering can extend the lifetime of sensor nodes in WSNs by minimizing redundant\
    \ data\ntransmission. In different applications of agriculture WSNs including\
    \ environment observation, the\nsensed data of the neighboring nodes may spatially\
    \ be associated. In this case, data combination\npresents an important method\
    \ for reducing the amount of redundant data, reducing the number\nof transmissions,\
    \ and minimizing the power consumption of the nodes in the network [90]. Data\n\
    gathering also reduces latency by minimizing data trafﬁc and improving the delay\
    \ between the sink\nand sensor nodes; after reducing the number of communications,\
    \ this approach can improve the\nexploitation of bandwidth [91]. Data merging\
    \ can be accomplished along a route starting from sensor\nnodes to sink nodes.\
    \ The nodes in a route can rebroadcast only the maximum, minimum, or average\n\
    amount of received data. The design of an energy-efﬁcient WSN-based data-gathering\
    \ scheme poses a\nsigniﬁcant challenge because this scheme must ensure a trade-off\
    \ among power consumption, latency,\nsecurity, data accuracy, and fault tolerance.\n\
    Gathering data in agricultural applications, including humidity, weather, temperature,\
    \ and soil\nmoisture, can minimize the power consumption of environment sensor\
    \ nodes by spatially correlating\nthe ﬁeld and redundant data of the sensor nodes\
    \ when the temperature does not change signiﬁcantly [1],\nespecially during nighttime.\
    \ For example, if the microcontroller of the temperature sensor node\nmeasures\
    \ the same temperature value for extended hours, then the sensor node sends the\
    \ temperature\nvalue every four hours to reduce power consumption. Merging the\
    \ temperature and humidity\nsensors into a single sensor may also reduce the power\
    \ consumption, size, and system complexity.\nAzaza et al. [17] integrated climate\
    \ condition parameters (i.e., temperature, CO2, humidity, and\nilluminance sensors)\
    \ inside a greenhouse and observed a comfortable growth of plants while saving\n\
    water resources and energy. The greenhouse was equipped with environment control\
    \ devices, such as\nventilation system, fogging system for humidiﬁcation, and\
    \ electrical heaters. A smart system based on\nfuzzy logic control correlated\
    \ humidity and temperature measurements is implemented to improve\nthe fogging\
    \ system operation. In that way, the power consumption of the fogging system can\
    \ be\nsigniﬁcantly reduced. In addition, the system was improved by a wireless\
    \ data observing platform\n(STM 32/F4 microcontroller and Virtex V FPGA board)\
    \ for logging and data routing, which provides\ndata access in real time. The\
    \ suggested control system based on fuzzy logic control was experimentally\nimplemented\
    \ and validated. The results revealed that the total energy and water usage decreased\
    \ by\n22% and 33%, respectively.\nMusaazi et al. [92] introduced a data caching\
    \ algorithm (DCAL) that optimizes the sleep/wake up\nperiods of ZigBee WSNs to\
    \ achieve low energy consumption and latency in PA application. In WSNs,\ndata\
    \ are collected from the source nodes and routed to the sink node; from the sink\
    \ node, the data\nare sent to the Internet. Reducing the transmission of duplicated\
    \ sensed data reduces the power\nconsumption. Energy conservation is paramount\
    \ during the communication phase to prolong the\nlifetime of sensor nodes. The\
    \ main method utilized to conserve energy involves switching off the nodes’\n\
    transceiver when they are not transmitting nor receiving packets. Additionally,\
    \ the data-gathering\nmethod for agriculture WSNs has been investigated in [93].\
    \ The proposed system includes ZigBee\nwireless sensor nodes, customized farming\
    \ personal digital assistants (PDAs), and a host PC. Each\nsensor node contains\
    \ four sensors to identify ﬁve agricultural ﬁeld parameters: soil temperature,\
    \ soil\nmoisture, environmental humidity, soil electrical conductivity, and environmental\
    \ temperature. The\nPDA combines the ZigBee coordinator node, GPRS module, and\
    \ GPS module. The ZigBee WSN\ngathers farming data and obtains GPS information\
    \ for each sensor node. It then passes the data to the\nhost PC through GPRS.\
    \ The experimental results show that the battery power of the sensor nodes can\n\
    be saved based on the data-gathering scheme.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n16 of 45\n\
    Data compression is a useful method for deploying sensor nodes with restricted\
    \ energy resources.\nInformation encoding can be performed in sensor nodes, whereas\
    \ information decoding can be\nperformed in sink nodes. Using compression techniques\
    \ to reduce the size of information that the\nsink nodes transmit over wireless\
    \ channels may also reduce the power consumption and extend the\nbattery life\
    \ of the sensor nodes. One study has applied data compression approaches to reduce\
    \ the\npower consumption for auto-irrigation system which based on CC1000 RF module\
    \ [41]. Based on this\nmethod, the battery of the sensor node can be extended\
    \ to 359 days.\nThe data-driven power reduction technique aims to reduce the amount\
    \ of sampled data by\nconserving the sensing accuracy to an appropriate level\
    \ for a speciﬁed application [94]. Thereby,\nthe amount of data to be transmitted\
    \ to the sink nodes can be minimized. Therefore, this technique\ncan reduce the\
    \ power consumption of agriculture WSNs and extend their battery life. A data-driven\n\
    algorithm is considered by Lerdsuwan and Phunchongharn [95] to solve the energy\
    \ consumption\nproblem of the sensor node in PA with low complexity and maintain\
    \ the transmission rate. Their\nexperiment reveals that their proposed algorithm\
    \ has higher energy efﬁciency than the ESPIN and\nSPIN algorithms in [96,97] by\
    \ 36.84% and 81.53%, respectively.\nThe data rate of RF transceivers can be adjusted\
    \ in the physical layer of a wireless protocol to\nreduce the power consumption\
    \ of the sensor node. Davis et al. [98] investigated the low battery\ncondition\
    \ of a sensor node to attain prolonged battery life for separate wireless sensor\
    \ nodes that\ncan preserve sampling suitability and reliability in communicating\
    \ accurate data. Different sensors,\nsuch as those for soil moisture, sap ﬂow,\
    \ and soil water, were examined to study the effect of sensing\ndebility due to\
    \ low battery voltage. The comparison of the data sampling rate of these sensors\
    \ shows\nthat sap ﬂow measurement is the best option for agricultural WSN. This\
    \ ﬁnding is attributed to the\nlow error obtained when the sampling interval increased\
    \ to 15 min while maintaining measurement\naccuracy. Table 4 shows the comparison\
    \ of power reduction technique based on data mitigation schemes\nfor previous\

    \ power reduction scheme for agriculture WSNs to minimize\nthe path between sensor\
    \ nodes and sink node, thereby the power consumption of the WSN is reduced.\n\
    Routing protocol can be performed via (i) sink mobility, (ii) multi-path routing,\
    \ (iii) cluster architecture,\nand (iv) routing metric.\nSink mobility was adopted\
    \ in previous research [99,100]. Mathur et al. [99] proposed a novel\nmechanism\
    \ that adopts unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to gather data from forest regions\
    \ instead\nof classical sensing from nodes deployed in WSN. The proposed method\
    \ enables the UAV to collect\ndata from WSN in harsh terrain and transmit it to\
    \ the base station situated far from the sensing area.\nTherefore, the multi-hop\
    \ transmission between cluster heads can be completely avoided, and the\ncommunication\
    \ range can be extended.\nMulti-path routing has also been suggested by other\
    \ scholars for agriculture WSNs [67,68,101].\nRecently, Nikolidakis et al. [67]\
    \ proposed an agricultural ﬁeld weather monitoring system based on\nthe ZigBee\
    \ wireless protocol. An advance energy-efﬁcient routing protocol was implemented\
    \ for WSN\nto automate irrigation management. The transmitter could modify its\
    \ power based on the distance\nbetween the sensor node and base station to save\
    \ energy. The results revealed that network lifetime\nincreased to 1825 min. Hedley\
    \ et al. [101] developed a WSN soil moisture mapping and monitoring\nmethod to\
    \ provide information for irrigation scheduling. To conserve power, the sensor\
    \ nodes relayed\ndata to the BS every 15 min through the greatest energy-efﬁcient\
    \ route.\nCluster head method is considered by Ndzi et al. [102] to extend the\
    \ ZigBee WSN lifetime for\nagricultural application.\nIn addition, the quality\
    \ of the crop yields is improved and their cost\nis minimized. The research presented\
    \ WSN coverage measurements in a mixed crop farmland.\nAn adaptive energy consumption\
    \ model for each sensor node was proposed and used to compute the\nenergy consumption\
    \ in the network. A deployment model with a cluster head and two antennas was\n\
    also proposed and simulated to alleviate short network lifetime due to the vegetation\
    \ attenuation of\nsignals. This network deployment model extended the lifetime\
    \ of the network by a factor of more than\n20 compared with a deployment where\
    \ cluster heads are not used. Nikolidakis et al. [103] proposed\na new routing\
    \ protocol for WSN that can reduce the power consumption of sensor nodes through\n\
    balanced clustering. This protocol was called “equalized cluster head election\
    \ routing protocol”\n(ECHERP). ECHERP was implemented in Java language for 500\
    \ homogeneous nodes distributed in a\n100 × 100 m2 land. The simulation results\
    \ showed that the proposed protocol outperforms existing\nprotocols in terms of\
    \ power consumption. A potential application of this protocol is PA.\nAnother\
    \ type of routing protocol is called routing metric. Chen et al. [104] used two\
    \ routing\nmetrics, namely, remained energy and expected transmission count, to\
    \ compute the optimal routing\npath to the sink node that ensures low power consumption.\
    \ “A scalable context-aware objective\nfunction (SCAOF)” is proposed by combining\
    \ robustness-aware, energy-aware, resource-aware, and\nreliability-aware contexts\
    \ that render to the compound routing metrics scheme. The experiment is\nconducted\
    \ in a garden based on a testbed, which includes a uIPv6 protocol stack and contiki\
    \ OS. The\nobtained results prove that SCAOF can convey the desired advantages\
    \ on network lifespan prolonging,\nas well as high efﬁciency and reliability in\
    \ different hardware testbeds and simulation scenarios.\nTable 5 shows the comparison\

    \ of WSNs in different agricultural applications in the work of\nseveral scholars\
    \ (Tables 2–6). The tables show that most previous studies used ZigBee wireless\

    \ Techniques\nA major limitation of sensor nodes is their limited battery capacity.\
    \ Several energy-efﬁcient\nschemes have been introduced in previous research to\
    \ solve the power consumption problem of sensor\nnodes. An alternative method\
    \ that has been utilized to address the problem of limited node lifespan is\n\
    the use of energy-harvesting techniques. Numerous techniques have been developed\
    \ to allow sensor\nnodes to harvest different types of energy, such as solar,\
    \ wireless power transfer (WPT), mechanical\nvibration, kinetic, and wind energy,\
    \ from different environments [110] (Figure 2). Compared with\ntraditional sensor\
    \ nodes, rechargeable sensor nodes can work continuously for a long lifetime.\
    \ Ambient\nenergy can be converted to electrical energy and used directly to supply\
    \ the sensor nodes or can be\nstored and used later on. In agricultural applications,\
    \ energy harvesting can be used to prolong the\nlifetime of sensor nodes. Energy-harvesting\
    \ techniques for previous research works employed in\nprecision agriculture are\
    \ shown in Table 7. The said table lists the categories of energy-harvesting\n\
    techniques, types of wireless protocols, and output energy/power of energy-harvesting\
    \ techniques.\nIn addition, the form of agricultural applications, and limitations\
    \ of each article are also highlighted.\nEnergy-harvesting mechanisms can be implemented\
    \ with batteries for the sensor nodes. For\nexample, a sensor node using solar\
    \ energy to charge its batteries can work extensively during daytime\nwhen adequate\
    \ sunlight is available. Meanwhile, the sensor node can use its batteries through\
    \ power\nreduction techniques, such as sleep mode (i.e., duty cycle), at night\
    \ when sunlight is unavailable to save\nenergy. In addition, the sensor node can\
    \ enter restricted sleep periods (i.e., low duty cycle) and reduce\ntransmission\
    \ power when its batteries possess low residual energy [111]. Furthermore, adopting\
    \ a\nmaximum power point tracking system is a reliable battery charging technique\
    \ for long-term operation.\nThe charge–discharge cycle of the battery is minimized\
    \ [112].\n3.2.1. Solar Energy\nSolar energy based on photovoltaic system and methods\
    \ can be used in agricultural applications\nbased on WSNs [113]. Therefore, solar\
    \ cells provide a good solution [114] to ensure the survivability\nof the agriculture\
    \ monitoring system. Solar cell energy has been used by several studies to provide\n\
    long-term energy to sensor nodes in agriculture applications.\nGutiérrez et al.\
    \ [40] developed an irrigation system based on the ZigBee wireless protocol. The\n\
    system was developed to improve water usage for agricultural crops. Temperature\
    \ and soil moisture\nsensors in WSN were placed in the root of the plants to send\
    \ sensor information to a web application\nvia a gateway. The proposed algorithm\
    \ controls the water quantity based on threshold values of soil\nmoisture and\
    \ temperature that are programmed in a microcontroller-based gateway. The WSN\
    \ is\npowered by solar cell panels and rechargeable batteries. Water savings of\
    \ up to 90% were achieved\nrelative to the conventional irrigation method. Considering\
    \ that the system is cost effective and\nautonomous, it can be utilized in geographically\
    \ isolated regions where water sources are limited.\nZou et al. [68] improved\
    \ the battery lifetime of a WSN based on harvested energy (i.e., solar cell)\n\
    utilizing shadow detection. With this strategy, sensor nodes can accordingly modify\
    \ their scheduling\nto optimize their power production and remaining battery levels.\
    \ Furthermore, data transmission is\noptimized through routing and clustering\
    \ mechanisms. A Bayesian network was employed to provide\nwarning reports of bottlenecks\
    \ along the path. The system was deployed in real time based on the\nTexas Instruments\
    \ CC2530 platform that includes the ZigBee wireless protocol. The battery (lithium\n\
    type with a storage capacity of 2500 mAh) of the sensor node was charged from\
    \ the solar cell panel\nwhen the harvested power was adequate. The experimental\
    \ results showed that these techniques\nallow network activities to occur in a\
    \ continuous and effective manner.\nIn [115], a micro-irrigation system that relies\
    \ on a small solar-powered cell was developed. The\nenergy input, energy output,\
    \ greenhouse gas productions, and solar cell installation for rural areas\nwere\
    \ investigated with the proposed co-located system. The researchers compared their\
    \ system\nwith another commonly used method (i.e., aloe vera cultivation) in terms\
    \ of life cycle. The life cycle\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n23 of 45\nevaluation\
    \ showed that the proposed system is economical for several rural areas and may\
    \ provide\nopportunities for agriculture electriﬁcation and motivate economic\
    \ growth.\nRoblin [116] presented an irrigation system relying on a solar cell\
    \ for rural areas where sunlight is\noften available. The irrigation system includes\
    \ pumps working on a solar cell instead of an electricity\ngrid and/or a diesel\
    \ generator. The study showed that the irrigation system based on a solar cell\
    \ is\nbetter than systems that depend on other energy resources because the electricity\
    \ grid is unavailable at\nall times, and the operating cost of diesel pumps is\
    \ high and relies mainly on the diesel price. Although\nthe solar-powered system\
    \ was relatively expensive, it became a free source of energy after installation\n\
    in the rural area and proved to be a worthwhile investment in the long term. A\
    \ similar irrigation\nsystem was proposed in [117]. The system adopts photovoltaic\
    \ panels to power a water pump that\nconverts the continuous drift of water into\
    \ a drop drift to achieve increased water usage efﬁciency.\nKwon et al. [118]\
    \ suggested a novel prediction technique for energy harvesting with a solar\n\
    cell within three hours. Moreover, the packet transmissions of the sensor nodes\
    \ can be controlled\ndepending on the estimated energy. Packet transmissions and\
    \ energy harvesting are integrated to\nimprove the WSN performance. The integration\
    \ of these schemes enhances the prediction accuracy\nand improves the WSN throughput\
    \ and power consumption. The throughput of the sensor node can\nbe increased by\
    \ shortening the packet transmission period. By contrast, when the packet transmission\n\
    period increases, the power consumption of the sensor node decreases. The experimental\
    \ results show\nthat the proposed packet transmission scheme is superior to the\
    \ others in terms of data throughput\nand deadline miss rate. The proposed energy-harvesting\
    \ method is also predicted more precisely than\nothers by 6.92%.\nA study [119]\
    \ used a solar cell to provide energy to a WSN deployed in a greenhouse. The\n\
    humidity and temperature of the greenhouse were controlled through a management\
    \ and monitoring\nsystem, which was based on a low-power MSP430 (Texas Instruments,\
    \ Dallas, TX, USA) microcontroller\nand an ultra-low-power nRF24L01 transceiver\
    \ (Nordic Semiconductor, Oslo, Norway). The power\nconsumption of the WSN was\
    \ minimized as much as possible. In another study, a WSN-based ZigBee\n(CC2420\
    \ module) wireless transceiver and microcontroller (low-power ATmega128L) supplied\
    \ by\nthe solar cell as a battery charger were considered to monitor the humidity,\
    \ temperature, rain level,\nand leaf wetness of vineyards [120]. The WSN covered\
    \ 30 m between ZigBee units with a low power\nconsumption (35 and 38 mW in transmission\
    \ and reception modes, respectively).\n3.2.2. Wireless Power Transfer\nRecent\
    \ developments in wireless power transfer (WPT) are expected to increase the lifetime\n\
    of WSNs signiﬁcantly and make them continuously operational, given that WPT techniques\
    \ can\nbe utilized to transmit electromagnetic energy between transmitter and\
    \ receiver devices without\nany contact between the two. WPT is expected to overcome\
    \ the constraint of the supply of WSNs.\nConsequently, some researchers highlighted\
    \ the utilization of mobile node that can deliver power\nto deployed sensor nodes\
    \ such as [121,122].\nWPT technology poses a challenge to the energy\ncooperation\
    \ between neighboring nodes in WSNs. Therefore, in the future, sensor nodes could\n\
    harvest energy from the environment and transfer this energy to other nodes in\
    \ the network; in this\nmanner, a self-sustaining network can be achieved [123].\
    \ Accordingly, recent research has investigated\nmulti-hop energy transfer [124,125],\
    \ which paved the way for new energy cooperative schemes and\nWPT charging protocols.\n\
    WPT can be classiﬁed into three main subcategories:\n(i) electromagnetic (EM)\
    \ radiation,\n(ii) magnetic resonator coupling, and (iii) inductive coupling,\
    \ as shown in Figure 2. Wireless charging\nin WSNs can be performed via EM radiation\
    \ and magnetic resonant coupling. EM signals suffer from\nattenuation over distance,\
    \ and active radiation may pose a threat to the human body. Meanwhile,\nmagnetic\
    \ resonant coupling can address the power requirements of agriculture based on\
    \ WSNs because\nof its efﬁciency within a distance of several meters. Many studies\
    \ used WPT to charge sensor nodes\nfor different applications and ﬁelds. WPT-based\
    \ inductive coupling [121] has been used to charge\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n24\
    \ of 45\nthe battery of sensor nodes scattered in agriculture ﬁelds. The energy\
    \ is transferred from the source\ncoil (mounted on a UAV) to the receiver coil\
    \ (attached with sensor nodes). A 2.4 W transfer power\nis transferred to charge\
    \ a single sensor node. The results addressed a number of limitations and\nchallenges\
    \ related to the charging of sensor nodes via a UAV. In addition, the results\
    \ revealed that\nthe battery lifetime of the deployed sensors can be signiﬁcantly\
    \ extended through the UAV. A similar\napproach was adopted by Chen et al. [122]\
    \ to charge a WSN in an agricultural ﬁeld through the\nharvesting of electromagnetic\
    \ radiation.\n3.2.3. Air Flow Energy\nHarnessing wind energy is another energy-harvesting\
    \ technique that can be utilized to provide\npower to sensor nodes in agricultural\
    \ applications. An adaptive routing protocol, wind energy\nharvesting, and sleep\
    \ scheduling were considered in [126] to minimize the power consumption of the\n\
    ZigBee transceiver and extend the lifetime of the WSN.\n3.2.4. Vibration Energy\n\
    Vibration energy based on piezoelectric can be used to charge the battery of sensor\
    \ nodes to prolong\ntheir lifetime. Müller et al. [127] have been analyzed various\
    \ WSN protocols based on ZigBee (CC2420\nand CC2500) and CC1100 with respect to\
    \ their applicability in the agricultural setting. Furthermore,\na fully synchronous\
    \ protocol with a time-slot architecture for a WSN has been proposed for agricultural\n\
    machinery to achieve real-time capability, low latency, and deterministic behavior.\
    \ The objective of\ntheir application was to monitor the back door position and\
    \ ﬁlling level of a forage wagon using a\nZigBee (CC2420) RF transceiver. Clock\
    \ synchronization among all nodes is implemented to ensure\nstrict power on/sleep\
    \ times of each sensor node. Meanwhile, an energy-harvesting unit based on a\n\
    piezoelectric material has been designed; the unit provides an average power of\
    \ 200 µW to sensor\nnodes. In this case, the sensor node can transmit a data payload\
    \ of nine bytes in 40 ms.\n3.2.5. Water Flow Energy\nMulti-energy sources (water,\
    \ wind, and solar) platform is designed for precision agricultural\napplications\
    \ by Morais et al. [128]. The authors explored water ﬂow, wind speed and solar\
    \ radiation\nfeasible energy sources to encounter the requirements of ZigBee router\
    \ node in WSN. Thus, several\npowered solutions for WSN is presented. Design considerations\
    \ regarding water ﬂow energy, the water\nﬂow in the pipes of crops irrigation\
    \ system are employed to generate the energy for ZigBee router node.\nThis idea\
    \ can be applied in different agricultural applications such as greenhouses, aquaculture,\
    \ and\nhydroponic systems, where the water recirculation in pipes is continuous.\
    \ Like to bulky hydroelectric\ngeneration utilities, a water ﬂow in the pipes,\
    \ derived from the main water source, can be employed\nto run a turbine joined\
    \ to a small direct current (DC) generator. The experimental results revealed\n\
    that the three energy sources combined together can generate an energy of 58 mAh,\
    \ more than the\nrequirement of the ZigBee router node (39 mAh).\n3.2.6. Microbial\
    \ Fuel Cell Energy\nAnother type of energy harvesting technique is called microbial\
    \ fuel cell. This technique is extracted\nfrom energy neutral system. Sartori\
    \ and Brunelli [129] proposed microbial fuel cell to supply the\nunderground freshwater\
    \ system that used for monitoring the water level in the phreatic zone, artesian\n\
    wells, and tanks. The proposed system comprises a low-cost phreatimeter sensor,\
    \ a low-power\nmicrocontroller (i.e., MSP430FR5739), and a low-power LoRa wireless\
    \ protocol. However, the amount\nof microbial fuel cell energy extraction of 296\
    \ µW is not enough to supply LoRa wireless protocol and\nmicrocontroller directly\
    \ when they are in active mode. Therefore, a DC-to-DC boost is employed to\nraise\
    \ the small input voltages of 130 mV to 4.5 V.\nEvidently, most agricultural applications\
    \ prefer to use solar cells as battery chargers of WSNs\nbecause these cells are\
    \ easy to install, work efﬁciently when sunlight is available, and supply more\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 1781\n25 of 45\nenergy compared with other energy-harvesting\
    \ techniques as shown in Table 7. In addition, the table\nshows most of the previous\
    \ scholars adopted ZigBee wireless protocol. Clearly, employing ZigBee\nsupports\
    \ our study that this wireless protocol is more suitable for agricultural monitoring\
    \ systems.\nSolar panels can supply 100 mW/cm2, whereas radio frequency, thermal,\
    \ vibration, wind, microbial\nfuel cell, magnetic resonant coupling WPT, and water\
    \ ﬂow can supply 0.001, 0.06, 0.8, 1.0, 0.296, 14, and\n19 mWs, respectively [128–131].\
    \ For example, as shown in Figure 3 (Part A), if the power consumption\nof the\
    \ WSN components presented in [120] is 35 mW for ZigBee (Chipcon CC2420), 0.27\
    \ mW for\nthe temperature sensor, 3 mW for the humidity sensor, 0.27 mW for the\
    \ rain gauge sensor, 5 mW\nfor the leaf wetness sensor, and 24 mW for the ATmega128L\
    \ microcontroller [132], a single solar cell\n(2 × 2 cm2) panel can adequate supply\
    \ this WSN. However, when the power consumption of the WSN\nincreases, the dimension\
    \ of the solar cell panel also needs to be increased.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n\

    \ the visibility of a group of systems, technologies, platforms, and design \n\
    principles for joining things, depending on the physical surroundings, through\
    \ the use of the Internet. \nPA is an application that can employ the benefits\
    \ of IoT to increase production efficiency, improve \nthe quality of yields, reduce\
    \ the negative ecological impact, prevent the prevalence of plant-eating \npests\
    \ or plant diseases, alert farmers about farm fires [141], and increase the profitability\
    \ of several \nagricultural production schemes. Agriculture involves farming,\
    \ planting, and animal rearing, and it \nhas grown under the scope of IoT recently\
    \ [5]. Tracking of animals, monitoring of farms, and \nirrigation processes are\
    \ the main domains of IoT for cultivation [142]. Furthermore, feeding, rearing,\
    \ \nmedication, and vaccination are essential applications of IoT in the agricultural\
    \ domain [143]. \nConsequently, several IoT modular architectures have been proposed\
    \ and implemented by scholars \nfor PA monitoring (as presented in Table 8). Real-time\
    \ ecological information can be remotely \ngathered from the agricultural surroundings\
    \ based on different sensors, which transmit the \ninformation to be processed\
    \ to determine problems, take required actions using actuators, or store \ndata.\
    \ \nSensors in WSN can be employed to gather information about environmental and\
    \ physical \nfeatures, whereas actuators are used to respond to the feedback to\
    \ control or to perform an action \nover the conditions (Figure 3, Part B). The\
    \ use of sensors in agricultural applications poses a number \nof requirements,\
    \ including gathering of soil, weather, and crop information; surveillance of\
    \ \nagricultural areas, water and fertilizer requirements of diverse pieces of\
    \ rough land, several crops on \na single piece of acreage, different requirements\
    \ of crops for unlike soil and weather circumstances, \nand eliminating of interactive\
    \ solutions and relying on proactive solutions. All these requirements \nare applied\
    \ and processed in parallel. Therefore, different sensors and actuators must be\
    \ used to \nhandle this information and respond to different conditions. Processed\
    \ information can be utilized \nto make a decision instead of raw data of the\
    \ sensor [132]. This information can be transmuted to the \ncloud computing via\
    \ gateway for data processing and data storage, as shown in Figure 3 (Part C).\
    \ \nReference [144] proposed a modular architecture for a wireless sensor node\
    \ implemented for PA \napplications. The sensors employed in this modular were\
    \ soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and \nwind direction and speed sensors\
    \ to monitor the agricultural environments. “Adafruit Pro Trinket” \nplatform\
    \ was selected for the data processing, and nRF wireless protocol was used as\
    \ a transceiver \nto transfer sensor data to the gateway (i.e., Intel Edison to\
    \ reduce the power consumption). The \ngateway was in charge of collected information\
    \ from different sensors and passed the information to \nFigure 3. Example of\
    \ farm ﬁeld-based Internet of Things (IoT) and provided by a solar cell battery\n\
    charger: (a) Agriculture sensor node with related sensor and solar cell, (b) Sink\
    \ and actuator nodes,\nand (c) Gateway node and cloud computing.\n4. Agriculture\
    \ Requirements for IoT\nThe IoT represents the visibility of a group of systems,\
    \ technologies, platforms, and design\nprinciples for joining things, depending\
    \ on the physical surroundings, through the use of the Internet.\nPA is an application\
    \ that can employ the beneﬁts of IoT to increase production efﬁciency, improve\
    \ the\nquality of yields, reduce the negative ecological impact, prevent the prevalence\
    \ of plant-eating pests or\nplant diseases, alert farmers about farm ﬁres [141],\
    \ and increase the proﬁtability of several agricultural\nproduction schemes. Agriculture\
    \ involves farming, planting, and animal rearing, and it has grown\nunder the\
    \ scope of IoT recently [5]. Tracking of animals, monitoring of farms, and irrigation\
    \ processes\nare the main domains of IoT for cultivation [142]. Furthermore, feeding,\
    \ rearing, medication, and\nvaccination are essential applications of IoT in the\
    \ agricultural domain [143]. Consequently, several\nIoT modular architectures\
    \ have been proposed and implemented by scholars for PA monitoring (as\npresented\
    \ in Table 8). Real-time ecological information can be remotely gathered from\
    \ the agricultural\nsurroundings based on different sensors, which transmit the\
    \ information to be processed to determine\nproblems, take required actions using\
    \ actuators, or store data.\nSensors in WSN can be employed to gather information\
    \ about environmental and physical\nfeatures, whereas actuators are used to respond\
    \ to the feedback to control or to perform an action over\nthe conditions (Figure\
    \ 3, Part B). The use of sensors in agricultural applications poses a number of\n\
    requirements, including gathering of soil, weather, and crop information; surveillance\
    \ of agricultural\nareas, water and fertilizer requirements of diverse pieces\
    \ of rough land, several crops on a single\npiece of acreage, different requirements\
    \ of crops for unlike soil and weather circumstances, and\neliminating of interactive\
    \ solutions and relying on proactive solutions. All these requirements are\napplied\
    \ and processed in parallel. Therefore, different sensors and actuators must be\
    \ used to handle\nthis information and respond to different conditions. Processed\
    \ information can be utilized to make\na decision instead of raw data of the sensor\
    \ [132]. This information can be transmuted to the cloud\ncomputing via gateway\
    \ for data processing and data storage, as shown in Figure 3 (Part C).\nReference\
    \ [144] proposed a modular architecture for a wireless sensor node implemented\
    \ for PA\napplications. The sensors employed in this modular were soil moisture,\
    \ temperature, humidity, and\nwind direction and speed sensors to monitor the\
    \ agricultural environments. “Adafruit Pro Trinket”\nplatform was selected for\
    \ the data processing, and nRF wireless protocol was used as a transceiver to\n\
    transfer sensor data to the gateway (i.e., Intel Edison to reduce the power consumption).\
    \ The gateway\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n29 of 45\nwas in charge of collected information\
    \ from different sensors and passed the information to the cloud\nserver. The\
    \ proposed system resulted in improved crop quality and minimized negative ecological\n\
    effect. In [145], the usage of water in smart irrigation systems was controlled\
    \ based on developed IoT\nplatforms. A cloud agriculture ﬁeld-monitoring scheme\
    \ was designed and implemented to enable\nthe farmer to monitor the soil condition.\
    \ Soil moisture and weather temperature were monitored to\nautomate the irrigation\
    \ system in farm while minimizing water consumption, which led to reduced\ncost\
    \ and maintained environmental beneﬁts. The proposed water irrigation system included\
    \ three\nmain parts: a WSN and actuator, a cloud platform, and user application.\
    \ The WSN and actuator part\nconsisted of sensor nodes for collecting the soil\
    \ moisture and weather temperature, an actuator node\nto control the irrigation\
    \ process, and a sink node that could pass all farm information to the cloud\n\
    platform. All sensor, sink, and actuator nodes adopted low-power ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol.\nWSN and 3G network-based agriculture IoT was considered in [146]\
    \ to monitor the air\ntemperature, air humidity, and soil moisture. The entire\
    \ system consisted of sensor nodes, actuators\nsink nodes, server, gateway, and\
    \ the mobile phone device of the farmer. The collected information by\nthe sensor\
    \ nodes was sent to the server via gateway and Internet network. The gateway connected\
    \ the\nWSN with the Internet to relay the command control among the sensor nodes,\
    \ the phone of the farmer,\nthe actuators, and the server. However, in this system,\
    \ the data transmission over the 3G network\nmust ensure real-time communications\
    \ to support the agricultural WSN.\nIoT-based agriculture applications changed\
    \ classical agricultural surveillance approaches by\nspeedily providing quantitative\
    \ data with signiﬁcant temporal and spatial resolution. Several IoT\nplatforms\
    \ have recently been available in the market. For instance, in agricultural applications,\n\
    SmartFarmNet [147] platforms can be used to provide more than 30 packages for\
    \ good commercial\nproducts, such as Libelium [45], and experimental, such as\
    \ Motes [148] and Arduino [149] sensor\nplatforms. Other examples of agricultural\
    \ applications based on IoT are provided in Table 8. The table\npresents a comparative\
    \ analysis of several scholars in terms of sensors, actuators, IoT devices, and\
    \ IoT\nplatforms that can be used to support agricultural applications.\nSensors\

    \ of PA domain such as sensors, microcontrollers, and wireless technologies\n\
    are highlighted and classiﬁed in Table 9. For better clariﬁcation, the sensors\
    \ are classiﬁed into three\nmain categories leaf wetness/plant, soil moisture,\
    \ and environment sensors [5,132]. These sensors can\nbe utilized in several potential\
    \ agriculture applications. In Table 9, the microcontroller/processor and\nwireless\
    \ protocols are also highlighted. Among the microcontrollers, the majority of\
    \ agriculture sensor\nnodes adopting ATmega128L because this microcontroller supports\
    \ data aggregation, decision making,\nstorage capability, ﬂash memory, low complexity,\
    \ and energy management through multi-levels of\npower down modes [132]. ZigBee\
    \ and LoRa wireless protocols/technologies are widely used in several\nagricultural\
    \ applications, as discussed previously in Section 2.\nIn precision agriculture,\
    \ to obtain high-quality products, the environmental parameters should be\ncontrolled\
    \ to provide optimal values. For example, the temperature rate that has a positive\
    \ effect on the\ngrowth of the pepper ﬁeld is between 20 and 25 ◦C. The temperature\
    \ in rainy, sunny, and nightly days\nshould be kept between 20 and 22 ◦C, between\
    \ 25 and 28 ◦C, and between 18 and 20 ◦C, respectively\nand the minimum value\
    \ should be not lower than 16–17 ◦C. Air humidity for pepper vegetables should\n\
    be kept between 60% and 70%. The high-temperature value combines with low humidity\
    \ value may\nbe caused a negative inﬂuence on the growth of the pepper. The maximum\
    \ humidity value in pepper\ngreenhouse should be not above 70%. Soil pH (i.e.,\
    \ soil acidity) is another factor that directly effects\non the pepper crops,\
    \ where it can measure the quantity of calcium in the soil. The soil for pepper\n\
    crops can be acid or alkaline depending on the weather conditions. It should be\
    \ acid for wet climate\nand alkaline for a dry climate. Soil with pH levels above\
    \ 7.0 is considered alkaline, while soil with\npH levels below 7.0 has acid nature.\
    \ Soil pH values must be controlled according to the type of the\nagricultural\
    \ yield. For pepper crop, the best values for pH gauge are between 6.5 and 5.5.\
    \ Therefore,\nthe humidity, temperature, and soil pH should be constantly supervised\
    \ in order to identify the right\ntime for draining and watering the agricultural\
    \ crops.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n33 of 45\nTable 9. Types of sensors, microcontrollers,\

    \ Limitations\nThe development of WSNs prompted new research trends in the agricultural\
    \ domain. Micro\nelectromechanical system (MEMS) technologies allow for the manufacture\
    \ of cheap and small sensors.\nThe pervasive nature of the process, together with\
    \ tiny, self-regulating sensor nodes, cost-effective\nequipment, and scalability,\
    \ indicate that WSNs can be used for agriculture automation [5]. However,\nregarding\
    \ the distribution of WSNs to observe different agricultural climates, a number\
    \ of open\nchallenges and limitations remain. Several of these challenges and\
    \ limitations in existing agricultural\napplications based on WSNs are listed\
    \ below together with suggestions on how to address them.\n(1)\nPower consumption\
    \ and battery life:\nA WSN consists of three main components:\nsensors,\nmicrocontrollers,\
    \ and RF transceivers. Given that the battery of a sensor node provides limited\n\
    energy, ensuring that the components of the sensor node consume minimum power\
    \ is crucial.\nIn particular, reducing the power consumption of the RF transceiver,\
    \ which consumes more power\nthan the other components in a sensor node, would\
    \ alleviate this problem [67,127]. Moreover,\nthis issue can be addressed in two\
    \ steps. The ﬁrst is to propose an intelligent energy-efﬁcient\nalgorithm. The\
    \ second step can be performed by utilizing available energy-harvesting techniques,\n\
    such as solar cells, vibration, and WPT.\n(2)\nCommunication range: WSNs suffer\
    \ from the effect of harsh ecological conditions because of the\nwide range of\
    \ open agricultural surroundings [5]. The WSN protocol contains mechanisms to\n\
    resist the effect of data transmission failures in the network, which increase\
    \ due to ecological\neffects. In agricultural applications, most wireless sensor\
    \ technologies support a relatively short\ncommunication range. Therefore, many\
    \ sensor and router nodes need to be diffused in a WSN.\nIn the point-to-point\
    \ Zigbee network, the communication distance can reach 100 m in outdoor\nenvironments.\
    \ The ZigBee communication range can be extended by adopting multi-tire, ad-hoc,\n\
    decentralized, and mesh network topologies. Drones or UAV also can be used as\
    \ a mobile router\nnode to extend the communication range within a farm ﬁeld.\
    \ A drone could pass the collected\ndata from the sensor nodes to the master node\
    \ through multi-hop. However, using drones entails\nother challenges and limitations.\n\
    (3)\nPropagation losses:\nIn agricultural applications, WSNs must be able to work\
    \ in diverse\nsurroundings, such as ground, bare land, orchards, greenhouses,\
    \ farms, and complex topography;\nthey must also be able to operate in all climate\
    \ conditions. All these conditions inﬂuence the\nperformance of radio propagation.\
    \ Whether the topography is simple or complicated, the\ncommunication possibility\
    \ between the points in a WSN still suffers from serious challenges.\nThe signal\
    \ transmitted from the sensor nodes in agricultural applications need to pass\
    \ through a\nheavy crop canopy to arrive to at the receiver nodes, which cannot\
    \ ensure a sufﬁcient clearance\narea and will cause signal propagation absorption,\
    \ reﬂection, attenuation, and scattering. In\nthis case, the link quality is degraded,\
    \ especially when the signal spreads through dense crops.\nTherefore, when deploying\
    \ WSNs, communication link quality and temporal and spatial variables\nmust be\
    \ guaranteed. The communication performance of WSNs is related to the working\n\
    surroundings. Therefore, due to the limited resources and power budget of WSNs,\
    \ an accurate\nwireless channel path loss model must be adopted to reﬂect the\
    \ propagation features. This model\nis expected to demonstrate correct optimization\
    \ and network evaluation performance throughout\nthe deployment design process\
    \ to develop the energy efﬁciency of the nodes [15], improve the\ntarget detection\
    \ and localization applications [16], decrease the number of retransmission, and\n\
    ensure Quality of Service (QoS) of the network [175].\n(4)\nRouting: Different\
    \ problems can emerge due to packet collision and limited bandwidth, which\nare\
    \ introduced by channel propagation, and so on. Therefore, when a WSN is deployed\
    \ in a wide\narea in farm ﬁelds, multi-hop is required. Kim et al. [3] developed\
    \ an independent mobile robot\nplatform based on a mobility task for surveillance\
    \ to overcome channel interference.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n35 of 45\n(5)\nLocalization\
    \ and tracking: Tracking and localization of a herd of cattle are considered smart\
    \ farm\napplications based on WSNs. For example, a WSN can be employed to track\
    \ and localize of dairy\ncows to enable herd management. ZigBee wireless protocol\
    \ is used to monitor animal locations\nand behaviors, such as walking and standing,\
    \ lying down, and grazing [16,18]. In this context,\nseveral considerations, such\
    \ as radio interference, animal situation, and mobility, changes in\nWSN topology,\
    \ penetration depth of the signal through the animal body, height of the collar,\
    \ and\naccess point antennas, need to be taken into account [176]. These considerations\
    \ pose challenges\nin the localization and tracking of the animals.\n(6)\nReliability:\
    \ Agricultural monitoring systems based on different environmental sensors can\
    \ also\nbe used to monitor pollution aside from climate conditions. Important\
    \ information on climate\nconditions is reported to related agencies and farmers\
    \ from a remote location for advance\ninvestigations. Dangerous information needs\
    \ to be dealt with immediately in an emergency,\nwhich means that data transmission\
    \ in WSNs should demonstrate high reliability [3].\n(7)\nScalability: In agricultural\
    \ applications, the construction of WSN-based fault-tolerant and\nrobust hierarchical\
    \ architectures requires large-scale deployment relative to single-level network\n\
    architectures.\nA hierarchical architecture can be scaled up for developing applications\
    \ by\nduplicating to several ﬁelds. In this context, to increase the number of\
    \ WSNs over a vast area,\nmultiple wireless router nodes are placed in an agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld to guarantee sustained operation.\n(8)\nCost: The total hardware and software\
    \ costs of sensor nodes are important. The design of sensor\nnodes for any agricultural\
    \ application level must involve a low cost while demonstrating a robust\nperformance;\
    \ moreover, the design needs to be available for use by poor country markets [5].\n\
    This challenge can be overcome by reducing software and hardware costs further.\n\
    (9)\nReal time: Most crops are vulnerable to climate conditions, such as humidity,\
    \ intensity of\nillumination, and temperature. This vulnerability is a burden\
    \ to farmers who monitor changes\nin climate conditions hourly and/or daily because\
    \ doing so is labor-intensive. Moreover, in\ngreenhouses, a ﬁre can occur and\
    \ lead to severe agricultural disasters. This evidence suggests\nthat the monitoring\
    \ of the ecological conditions of agricultural WSNs needs to be in real time.\n\
    Real-time monitoring will enhance yield production and plant growth and avoid\
    \ dangerous\ndisasters in farms [3].\n(10) Storage and recording of data: Large\
    \ amounts of data are recorded from agriculture observing\nsystems because several\
    \ WSNs in agricultural applications contain several sensors for crop\ngrowth analysis\
    \ and harvesting estimation. This condition requires the base station to monitor\n\
    changes in farm ﬁelds by analyzing patterns. The base station must thus be supported\
    \ by a high\nstorage capacity.\n(11) Security: Security and protection are important\
    \ issues in agricultural products. Protection\nfrom insects or attacks of rodents\
    \ in grain stores or ﬁelds is essential. Such a challenge must\nbe considered\
    \ to maintain the security level of agriculture. Protection and security can be\n\
    achieved based on real-time analysis and processing of agricultural information\
    \ without human\nintrusion [159].\n(12) Delay tolerance: Critical delay poses\
    \ a challenge to agricultural applications. Some agricultural\napplications can\
    \ be considered as time sensitive, such as those used in farm ﬁre detection,\n\
    detection of exposure of crops to pests, cow heat event detection during milking,\
    \ and exposure of\ncattle to heat for a certain period. Such information must\
    \ be transmitted as fast as possible if the\ncritical issue is to be handled.\
    \ In such a case, a tradeoff between energy consumption and data\ntimelines is\
    \ necessary. By contrast, some agricultural applications are delay tolerant (i.e.,\
    \ time\ninsensitive), such as protein content, milk fat [177], gathering data\
    \ from soil and grass monitoring.\nWith delay tolerant approach, the short range\
    \ low power wireless protocols can be used [178].\nWhere the information of the\
    \ agricultural ﬁeld can be collected and transferred to the master\nnode or to\
    \ a cloud computing node using “messengers” e.g., a mobile node (mobile robot\
    \ or\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n36 of 45\nUAV). Consequently, the cost [179] and\
    \ the complexity of the agriculture WSN will be reduced\nand the lifetime will\
    \ be increased.\n(13) Fault tolerance: Fault tolerance is a crucial feature of\
    \ WSNs for succeeding PA. Several faults may\noccur in PA based on the WSN system,\
    \ which are (i) communication failure, (ii) faulty sensor\nsetting, (iii) sensor\
    \ component faults producing incorrect value, and (iv) node failure because of\n\
    exhausted battery or any other cause. Gutiérrez et al. [40] introduced communication\
    \ failure and\nnode fault tolerance for an irrigation system. If any fault occurs,\
    \ the irrigation system tracks the\ndefault irrigation program. The node energy\
    \ depletion failure was minimized in [1,40,180] by\nadopting solar-cell-powered\
    \ nodes. Data aggregation and topology control schemes are probable\nto be fault\
    \ tolerant for deploying sensor nodes in a vast area.\n(14) Data management: The\
    \ data management in agriculture poses a challenge because the large\namount of\
    \ data that can be collected from several sensors spread in agricultural ﬁeld,\
    \ especially\nwhen the agricultural data are intended to be connected to the cloud.\
    \ Determination of the\n(i) data analysis method, (ii) data collection schemes,\
    \ (iii) sensor types, (iv) semantic sensor\nnetworking, (v) big data, and (vi)\
    \ complex event processing enables the designer to manage\nthese crucial aspects.\
    \ The integration of IoT and software-deﬁned network also introduces a\npromising\
    \ and new methodology in deployment, monitoring, and design of network services\n\
    and resources [181].\n(15) Heterogeneous sensors: Integration of wired and wireless\
    \ heterogeneous sensors into information\nplatforms to perform interoperability\
    \ pose challenges in PA. Chen et al. [152] proposed “web\nservice-enabled cyber-physical\
    \ infrastructure” to solve this issue. The proposed system was able\nto integrate,\
    \ process, acquire, and distribute surveillance data from different physical sensors\n\
    spread in the PA system over the Internet. The infrastructure was executed to\
    \ serve as an\narchitecture middleware between PA clients and heterogeneous sensors.\n\
    6. Conclusions\nA review of WSN-based agricultural applications was presented.\
    \ A comparison was conducted\namong different wireless technologies or protocols,\
    \ such as WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, GPRS/3G/4G,\nLoRa, and SigFox. The comparison\
    \ results revealed that the ZigBee and LoRa wireless protocols are\nmore convenient\
    \ for agricultural applications than the others because of its low power consumption\n\
    and suitable communication range for ZigBee and long for LoRa. A classiﬁcation\
    \ of energy-efﬁcient\ntechniques or algorithms and energy-harvesting techniques\
    \ was also provided. Based on the presented\ntaxonomy, we show that signiﬁcant\
    \ types of energy-efﬁcient and energy-harvesting techniques\ncan be used in the\
    \ agriculture domain. Previous research was also investigated and compared\nto\
    \ explore the current problems in agricultural applications based on WSNs and\
    \ obtain optimum\nsolutions for maintaining system performance. Challenges and\
    \ limitations were introduced for\ndesign considerations in the future. The state-of-the-art\
    \ approaches of IoT in agricultural applications\nwere reviewed and compared to\
    \ explore various sensors, actuators, devices, IoT platforms, and\napplication\
    \ layers.\nAcknowledgments: The authors would like to thank Al-Raﬁdain University\

    the agricultural process, the reality is that today''s agriculture industry is
    data-centered, precise, and smarter than ever. The rapid emergence of the Internet-of-Things
    (IoT) based technologies redesigned almost every industry including “smart agriculture”
    which moved the industry from statistical to quantitative approaches. Such revolutionary
    changes are shaking the existing agriculture methods and creating new opportunities
    along a range of challenges. This article highlights the potential of wireless
    sensors and IoT in agriculture, as well as the challenges expected to be faced
    when integrating this technology with the traditional farming practices. IoT devices
    and communication techniques associated with wireless sensors encountered in agriculture
    applications are analyzed in detail. What sensors are available for specific agriculture
    application, like soil preparation, crop status, irrigation, insect and pest detection
    are listed. How this technology helping the growers throughout the crop stages,
    from sowing until harvesting, packing and transportation is explained. Furthermore,
    the use of unmanned aerial vehicles for crop surveillance and other favorable
    applications such as optimizing crop yield is considered in this article. State-of-the-art
    IoT-based architectures and platforms used in agriculture are also highlighted
    wherever suitable. Finally, based on this thorough review, we identify current
    and future trends of IoT in agriculture and highlight potential research challenges.

    \ of Things (IoT)-based automation of agricultural events can change the agriculture\n\
    sector from being static and manual to dynamic and smart, leading to enhanced\
    \ production with\nreduced human efforts. Precision Agriculture (PA) along with\
    \ Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) are the\nmain drivers of automation in the agriculture\
    \ domain. PA uses speciﬁc sensors and software to ensure\nthat the crops receive\
    \ exactly what they need to optimize productivity and sustainability. PA includes\n\
    retrieving real data about the conditions of soil, crops and weather from the\
    \ sensors deployed in the\nﬁelds. High-resolution images of crops are obtained\
    \ from satellite or air-borne platforms (manned\nor unmanned), which are further\
    \ processed to extract information used to provide future decisions.\nIn this\
    \ paper, a review of near and remote sensor networks in the agriculture domain\
    \ is presented\nalong with several considerations and challenges. This survey\
    \ includes wireless communication\ntechnologies, sensors, and wireless nodes used\
    \ to assess the environmental behaviour, the platforms\nused to obtain spectral\
    \ images of crops, the common vegetation indices used to analyse spectral\nimages\
    \ and applications of WSN in agriculture. As a proof of concept, we present a\
    \ case study\nshowing how WSN-based PA system can be implemented. We propose an\
    \ IoT-based smart solution\nfor crop health monitoring, which is comprised of\
    \ two modules. The ﬁrst module is a wireless sensor\nnetwork-based system to monitor\
    \ real-time crop health status. The second module uses a low altitude\nremote\
    \ sensing platform to obtain multi-spectral imagery, which is further processed\
    \ to classify\nhealthy and unhealthy crops. We also highlight the results obtained\
    \ using a case study and list the\nchallenges and future directions based on our\
    \ work.\nKeywords: smart agriculture; precision agriculture; vegetation index;\
    \ Internet of Things\n1. Introduction\nThe rapidly-growing human population has\
    \ increased food demands for human survival on\nthe Earth. Meeting the food requirements\
    \ with limited resources of the planet is a big challenge [1].\nSeveral state-of-the-art\
    \ technologies are being incorporated in the agriculture domain to enhance\nthe\
    \ productivity to cope with this challenge. Precision Agriculture (PA) is comprised\
    \ of near and\nremote sensing techniques using IoT sensors, which help to monitor\
    \ crop states at multiple growth\nlevels. PA involves the acquisition and processing\
    \ of a large amount of data related to crop health.\nMultiple parameters are involved\
    \ in plants health, including water level, temperature and others.\nPA enables\
    \ a farmer to know precisely what parameters are needed for healthy crop, where\
    \ these\nparameters are needed and in what amount at a particular instance of\
    \ time. This requires collecting\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796; doi:10.3390/s19173796\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n2 of 25\nmassive information\
    \ from different sources and different parts of the ﬁeld such as soil nutrients,\
    \ the\npresence of pests and weeds, chlorophyll content in plants and some weather\
    \ conditions. All collected\ninformation needs to be analysed to produce agronomic\
    \ recommendations. For instance, given the\ndevelopmental stage of plants, their\
    \ level of greenness (chlorophyll content) reveals the nutrients\nneeded. This\
    \ information is combined with the characteristics of the soil where the plant\
    \ is located\nalong with weather forecast. All collected information is further\
    \ used to determine how much of a\ncertain fertilizer should be applied to that\
    \ plant on the next day. The delivery of agronomic information\non the right time\
    \ to farmer and ensuring that he/she applies these recommendations are key to\n\
    enhancing the yields.\nThe foremost driver of PA is a WSN, which is a network\
    \ of multiple wireless nodes connected\ntogether to monitor the physical parameters\
    \ of environment. Each wireless node is comprised of a\nradio transceiver, a micro-controller,\
    \ sensor(s), an antenna, along with other circuitry that enables it\nto communicate\
    \ with some gateway to transmit information collected by the sensor(s) [2]. Sensors\n\
    measure the physical parameters and send the collected information to the controller,\
    \ which further\ntransmits this information to the cloud or a portable device.\
    \ The agriculture sector has multiple\nrequirements comprised of soil statistics,\
    \ crops’ nature, weather conditions, fertilizer types and water\nrequirements.\
    \ Crops have diverse requirements depending on different crops on the same land\
    \ and the\nsame plant on different lands with different weather conditions. Sensors\
    \ monitor the varying behaviour\nof these crop parameters. Due to rapid advancement\
    \ in WSN technologies, the size and the cost of\nsensors have reduced, which make\
    \ it feasible to implement them in many sectors of life including\nagriculture.\
    \ The most common sensors used in the agriculture domain that capture environmental\n\
    parameters related to crops [3] are listed in Table 1.\nIn general, a WSN consists\
    \ of one or more wireless nodes that are further connected with sensors.\nThese\
    \ nodes are tiny devices that are responsible for collecting data. Nodes are divided\
    \ into two types,\na source node that collects the data, and the other is sink\
    \ or gateway node, which receives data from the\nsource nodes. A sink node has\
    \ more computational power compared to a source node. However, there\nare energy,\
    \ memory, power, size, data rate and price constraints when choosing wireless\
    \ nodes. Table 2\nshows a comparison of wireless nodes along with their common\
    \ speciﬁcations [3]. Among all wireless\nnodes presented in Table 2, MICA2 is\
    \ considered to be more suitable as compared to others because of\nits large number\
    \ of expansion connectors, which makes it suitable to connect with several sensors.\n\
    Many applications using WSN have been proposed since the last decade to monitor\
    \ crops’ health\nremotely. In [4], a cyber-physical system was presented for monitoring\
    \ of a potato crop. Cyber physical\nsystems can be expressed as smart systems\
    \ that are comprised of software, hardware and physical\ncomponents, integrated\
    \ together to sense the varying states of the real world. The proposed system\n\
    consists of three layers: the ﬁrst layer is the physical layer, in which all sensory\
    \ data are collected;\nthe second layer is the network layer in which data are\
    \ transmitted to the cloud; the third layer is\nthe decision layer in which the\
    \ data are analysed and processed to make decisions according to the\nobservations.\n\
    There are several challenges in IoT-based systems due to exponential increasing\
    \ devices. As in\na typical IoT network, every node transmits data to the remote\
    \ cloud, which results in cloud\ncongestion, and the main challenges underlying\
    \ the IOT-based system are latency with minimum\npower requirements, better usage\
    \ of bandwidth and intermittent Internet connectivity. Fog computing\nand edge\
    \ computing are the state-of-the-art techniques to overcome these issues; which\
    \ reduce the\ncomputational burden of cloud. The main goal of fog computing is\
    \ to conserve energy and bandwidth,\nwhich helps to increase the quality of service\
    \ to the end users. In [5], an energy-efﬁcient architecture of\nthe Fog of Everything\
    \ was presented, which was comprised of six layers. The ﬁrst layer was an Internet\n\
    Of Everything (IOE) layer, where things (could be ﬁxed, mobile or nomadic) functioned\
    \ under multiple\nspatially-distributed clusters. The second was a wireless access\
    \ network that supported Thing to Fog\n(T2F) and Fog to Thing (F2T) communication\
    \ over the wireless channel. In the third layer, the connected\nfog nodes behaved\
    \ such as a virtualized cluster. There was an inter-fog backbone in the fourth\
    \ layer,\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n3 of 25\nwhich was responsible for connectivity\
    \ among fog nodes. The next layer was the virtualization layer,\nwhich provided\
    \ each connected thing with the ability to augment its limited resource set, exploiting\n\
    the computation capability at the virtual clone. In the last layer, there was\
    \ an overlay inter-clone\nvirtual network that empowered Peer to Peer (P2P) communication.\
    \ Then, a protocol stack for FOE\nwas presented, which was further tested by creating\
    \ a small prototype named as V-FOE and simulated\non the iFogsim toolkit. The\
    \ results provided strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed\nframework\
    \ and more energy efﬁciency with reduced failure rate and delay.\nTable 1. Wireless\

    The energy efﬁciency is the most serious consideration while developing any fog\
    \ architecture.\nIn [6], an energy-efﬁcient protocol for a fog-supported wireless\
    \ sensor network was presented, which\nmaximized the lifetime of the network by\
    \ uniformly distributing the energy among connected nodes.\nThe performance of\
    \ the proposed algorithm was compared with the existing state-of-the-art algorithms\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 3796\n4 of 25\nin MATLAB. The results showed that the proposed\
    \ algorithm was highly energy efﬁcient with a\nprolonged network lifetime.\nRegardless\
    \ of all the advancements in the IoT domain, the adoption of PA has been limited\
    \ to\nsome developed countries. Because of the lack of resources, remote sensing-based\
    \ techniques to\nmonitor crop health are not common in under-developed countries\
    \ such as Pakistan, which results in\na loss of yield. Pakistan is an agricultural\
    \ country due to is large arable land and climatic variations,\nwhich make it\
    \ suitable to cultivate multiple types of crops. Despite all these natural resources,\
    \ Pakistan\nis still unable to produce massive yields [7]. The main reason behind\
    \ the low production is traditional\nfarming practices, which are used for crop\
    \ health monitoring and yield estimation. These techniques\nare completely based\
    \ on farmer’s intuition and experience. Farmers visit the ﬁelds in order to monitor\n\
    the crop, which is very laborious and quite challenging in the case of large arable\
    \ land. In this case, the\narea under insect/pest attack is inaccurately measured,\
    \ which can result in over spraying of insecticide\nand pesticide, which adversely\
    \ affects the nutrition in crops.\nKeeping in mind all these issues, our motivation\
    \ is to provide the industry and research\ncommunities with a survey of technologies,\
    \ metrics and current practices concerning communication\ndevices, sensors and\
    \ platforms used to monitor and analyse multiple sources of data (spectral images,\n\
    IoT, etc.) used in environmental and agriculture applications. As the main contribution,\
    \ we generated\na technological taxonomy for PA, which was driven by an IoT-based\
    \ architecture to monitor the crops’\nhealth. The developed system had two modules\
    \ including wireless sensor network-based crop heath\nmonitoring in which multiple\
    \ sensors were used to get the real-time heath status of crop; the other\none\
    \ was NDVI-based analysis of spectra images captured by a drone to assess the\
    \ chlorophyll content,\nwhich was further used to monitor the health of the crop.\n\

    \ wireless\ncommunication technologies used in the agriculture domain; Section\

    \ protocols have been introduced in the last few decades due to the rapid\nincrease\
    \ in IoT devices and WSN technologies. Each protocol has its own speciﬁcations\
    \ depending on\nthe bandwidth, number of free channels, data rate, battery timing,\
    \ price and other factors [8]. The most\ncommonly-used protocols for wireless\
    \ communication in IoT-based applications in agriculture are:\nSensors 2019, 19,\
    \ 3796\n5 of 25\n2.1. Cellular\nCellular technology is most suitable for applications\
    \ that require an extraordinary data rate.\nIt can utilize GSM, 3G and 4G cellular\
    \ communication capabilities by providing reliable high-speed\nconnectivity to\
    \ the Internet, requiring higher power consumption.\nIt requires infrastructure\
    \ to\nbe deployed and operation cost and back up staff for it with a centralized\
    \ managed authority.\n4G cellular technology requires more battery power, but\
    \ cellular technology is a good option in\nunderground wireless sensor networks,\
    \ such as security systems in smart home projects and agriculture\napplications\
    \ [9]. A smart irrigation systems was presented in [10], in which several soil\
    \ moisture\nsensors were deployed in the ﬁeld in the ZigBee mesh network. The\
    \ reading captured from the ﬁelds\nwere transmitted over the cloud using the cellular\
    \ 4G LTE network.\n2.2. 6LoWPAN\n6LoWPAN is an IP-based communication protocol,\
    \ which was the ﬁrst protocol used for IoT\ncommunication. 6LoWPAN is also low\
    \ cost because of the low bandwidth and low power consumption.\n6LoWPAN supports\
    \ multiple topologies such as star and mesh topologies. To handle interoperability\n\
    between IPv6 and IEEE 802.15.4, there is an adaptation layer between the network\
    \ layer and the\nMAC layer [8]. The applications for 6LoWPAN are monitoring the\
    \ health equipment, environment\nmonitoring and in security and home automation\
    \ systems. In [11], a 6LoWPAN-enabled wireless sensor\nnetwork was presented to\
    \ monitor the soil properties of crops. The 6LoWPAN system architecture\nfor precision\
    \ agriculture application was discussed in [12] where the performance evaluation\
    \ of this\nprotocol was discussed with several baud rates and power constraints.\n\
    2.3. ZigBee\nZigBee is a wireless communication protocol widely used in precision\
    \ agriculture to monitor\nenvironmental conditions related to crops’ health [13].\
    \ It is based on the wireless 802.15.4 standard.\nBasically, it was developed\
    \ for personal area networks by the ZigBee alliance [8]. It has a ﬂexible\nnetwork\
    \ structure, long battery life, supports mesh, star and tree topology with multi-hop\
    \ data\ntransmission, is easily installed and supports large nodes. It has a short\
    \ range with limited data speed\nand is less secure compared to Wi-Fi-based systems.\
    \ ZigBee is very common in smart agriculture\napplications such as smart green\
    \ houses and smart irrigation systems [14]. In [15], a smart irrigation\nsystem\
    \ was presented based on the ZigBee communication protocol. This system consisted\
    \ of two\nnodes, i.e., a sensor node and an actuator node. The sensor node was\
    \ comprised of soil moisture\nsensors, which monitored the water level in the\
    \ soil. The actuator module was responsible for taking\nactions according to the\
    \ water level of the soil. All communication was carried out by means of\nZigBee\
    \ protocol.\n2.4. BLE\nBLE is as famous as the Bluetooth smart technology, which\
    \ is a suitable protocol for IoT\napplications including agriculture [16]. It\
    \ is particularly designed for low bandwidth, low latency and\nshort range for\
    \ IoT applications. The main advantages of BLE over typical Bluetooth include\
    \ lower\nsetup time, lower power consumption and unlimited support for nodes in\
    \ a star topology. It has a\nvery limited range of 10 meters. However, the drawbacks\
    \ are that it can only provide communication\nbetween two devices, it presents\
    \ low security, and it can lose connection during communication. In [17],\na BLE-based\
    \ infrastructure was presented to collect the sensors’ data. The proposed system\
    \ utilized a\nsmart phone to collect the data of sensors using BLE, where sensors\
    \ were deployed in the plants, i.e.,\nsoil moisture sensors and soil temperature\
    \ sensor.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n6 of 25\n2.5. RFID\nRFID systems consist of\
    \ a reader and a transponder, which have a very small radio frequency,\ncalled\
    \ the RF tag. This tag is programmed electronically with distinctive information\
    \ that has a reading\ncharacteristic. RFID has two technologies for the tag system\
    \ the ﬁrst is the active reader tag system,\nand the other is the passive reader\
    \ tag. Active reader tag systems are more expensive, as they utilize\nmore battery\
    \ power and use high frequencies. However, passive reader tag systems are low\
    \ powered.\nSome IoT applications using RFID include smart shopping, healthcare,\
    \ national security and smart\nagriculture applications. An IoT-based smart irrigation\
    \ system based on RFID was presented in [18].\nThe system was comprised of soil\
    \ moisture and soil temperature sensors along with a water control\nsystem, so\
    \ it collected the reading of the sensors and sent these readings to the cloud\
    \ using RFID\ncommunication protocols, where the user controlled a water pump\
    \ based on the water level of the soil.\n2.6. Wi-Fi\nWi-Fi is the most common\
    \ communication protocol that enables devices to communicate over\na wireless\
    \ signal. Wi-Fi provides Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) connectivity to millions\
    \ of\nlocations, i.e., homes, ofﬁces and public locations such as cafes, hotels\
    \ and airports with high speed.\nThe Wi-Fi protocol supports IEEE 802.11, 802.11a,\
    \ 802.11b, 802.11g and 802.11n. Wi-Fi is widely used\nin IoT-based applications\
    \ including agriculture systems, i.e., smart irrigation, crop health monitoring\n\
    and greenhouses. In [19], an infrastructure was presented to monitor environmental\
    \ parameters\ninside the greenhouse such as temperature, light intensity and soil\
    \ moisture level. This platform\nwas comprised of sensors that collected the data\
    \ related to the environmental variation and sent to\nthe cloud using Wi-Fi. Similarly,\
    \ another smart agriculture system based on Wi-Fi communication\nprotocols was\
    \ presented in [20]. This last one consisted of a Raspberry Pi connected with\
    \ multiple\nsensors, which collected the data. The collected data were further\
    \ transmitted to the cloud using Wi-Fi\ncommunication protocols.\n2.7. LoRaWAN\n\
    LoRaWAN operates on the LoRa network. LoRaWAN deﬁnes the system architecture and\n\
    communication protocol of the network, while the physical layer of LoRa enables\
    \ the link for\nlong-range communication. LoRaWAN manages the frequencies in communication,\
    \ data rate and\npower consumption for all devices. LoRaWAN is common in agricultural\
    \ applications because of\nits large coverage area and low power consumption [21].\
    \ In [14], a smart irrigation system based on\nLoRaWAN was presented. Table 3\
    \ shows the comparison of all mentioned wireless communication\nprotocols [8].\
    \ Among all wireless communication technologies, 6LoWPAN and ZigBee are considered\n\
    to be more suitable for PA application because both are based on mesh networking,\
    \ which makes them\nsuitable to cover large area.\nTable 3. Wireless communication\

    \ Image-Based Remote Sensing\nRemote sensing has been widely used in PA to monitor\
    \ crops’ health for the last two decades.\nRemote sensing is a phenomenon in which\
    \ physical conditions of the Earth are observed remotely by\ncalculating the emitted\
    \ and reﬂected radiation from some distance. There are special cameras that\n\
    are used to capture images for further analysis to ﬁnd the characteristics of\
    \ a speciﬁc area. Multiple\nplatforms are used to mount these cameras that capture\
    \ images of the objects.\n3.1. Spectral Image Platforms\nRemote sensing platform\
    \ considerations for spectral images are airborne-based, satellite-based\nand\
    \ Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based [22]. Each platform has its own coverage\
    \ range, which\nis determined by three factors: (i) Ground Sampling Distance (GSD),\
    \ which is computed in terms of\nspatial resolution, (ii) data collection rate\
    \ or frequency and (iii) average distance between the object\nand sensor. Apart\
    \ from coverage range, several factors [23] affect the performance of platforms,\n\
    as mentioned in Table 4.\nTable 4. Key differences between spectral image platforms.\n\

    Moderate\n3.1.1. Satellite-Based Platforms\nSpace-borne platforms for remote sensing\
    \ are considered to be the most stable platforms among\nall others. These platforms\
    \ consist of satellites, rockets and space shuttles. Space borne platforms are\n\
    categorized based on the orbits and timing. The advantages of satellite-based\
    \ remote sensing include\nhigh spatial resolution, which makes it promising to\
    \ extract extensive time-series data. The images\nobtained by satellite platforms\
    \ cover large area and are stable without noise, which is normally induced\ndue\
    \ to interference while image capturing. However, the main problem with satellite-based\
    \ platforms\nis their high cost in the case of high spatial resolution images.\
    \ The second problem is their strictly ﬁxed\ntime schedule, so data cannot be\
    \ collected at critical timings. The re-visitation times vary from twice\nin one\
    \ day to 16 days, depending on the orbit of the satellite. The other big problem\
    \ is that satellite\nplatforms are highly sensitive to weather conditions, so\
    \ if the weather is cloudy, the captured image will\nhave less detailed information.\
    \ Table 5 shows the main types of satellites with their speciﬁcations [22].\n\
    Among all satellite platforms presented in Table 5, some satellite data are freely\
    \ available,\nwhile others provide a commercial solution. The commercial solutions\
    \ such as Pleiades-1 provide\nimages with a high resolution and a revisit time\
    \ of one day. QuickBird, Landsat-8 and Sentinel are\nfrequently-used satellite\
    \ platforms used to obtain hyperspectral imagery. QuickBird was launched\nin 2001\
    \ by USA. The Panchromatic (PAN) and four Multi-Spectral (MS) imagery sensors\
    \ are used in\nQuickBird with a GSD of 0.7 × 0.7–2.6 × 2.6 m with a revisit time\
    \ 1–3.5 days. QuickBird provides a\nsmall revisit time, but it is a commercial\
    \ solution. In contrast to QuickBird, Landsat-8 and Sentinel\nprovide free solutions.\
    \ Landsat-8 was launched in 2013 by the USA. Landsat-8 provides a GSD of\n16 days\
    \ with PAN and 11-MS imagery sensors. Though revisit time of Landsat-8 is much\
    \ higher\ncompared to QuickBird, but it provides images with 11 different multi-spectral\
    \ bands.\nSentinel is another broadly-used satellite launched by the EU. It currently\
    \ has three missions,\ni.e., Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3. These missions\
    \ provide images with 21 MS bands with\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n8 of 25\nrevisit\
    \ times of 5–10 days depending on which Sentinel mission is used. However, Sentinel-2\
    \ is a\ncommonly-used platform in precision agriculture as it provides data freely\
    \ at a 10-m spatial resolution\nand covers a swath width of 290 km. By combining\
    \ Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B, the revisit time is\nfurther reduced to ﬁve days,\
    \ which helps in change detection. The complete details of all satellite\nplatforms\
    \ with their speciﬁcations are listed in Table 5, where other platforms such as\
    \ SAT, MODIS\nand WordView are also considered.\nTable 5. Satellite platforms\

    \ a vibrant alternative to satellite and airborne, which are quite ﬂexible and\
    \ cost\neffective. A typical UAV platform consists of a communication and navigation\
    \ system that incorporates\na set of sensors mounted on it. Among UAV platforms,\
    \ there are mainly ﬁxed-wing platforms. and\nmultirotor options are available.\
    \ The ﬂying time is based on the payload weight. In general, a longer\nﬂying time\
    \ is achieved by ﬁxed-wing systems, which demands lighter weight payloads. For\
    \ example,\nhigh-deﬁnition cameras weighing less than 300 grams as the payload\
    \ of a ﬁxed-wing UAV allow it to ﬂy\nfor around two hours using currently available\
    \ battery power [24]. On the contrary, battery-powered\nmultirotor UAV with higher\
    \ payload capacity have a reduced ﬂying time, i.e., around 15–25 min.\nTable 7\
    \ shows UAV platforms commonly used in the agriculture domain and concretely to\
    \ monitor\nthe health of crops remotely [22]. Among these platforms, DJI/Phantom-2\
    \ is a more suitable choice\nfor intermediate agricultural land because of its\
    \ low cost and ease of use. The other advantage of this\nplatform is that it provides\
    \ support for mounting multiple cameras, which helps to monitor the crop in\n\
    multiple electro-magnetic bands. The American Aerospace/RS-16 is also an option\
    \ because of its ﬂight\ntime and large are coverage, but due to its high cost,\
    \ this platform is not common.\nIn [25], the ESAFLY A2500_WH helicopter was used\
    \ to implement the platform of the UAV\nwith Tetra cam ADC Micro as the camera\
    \ to capture hyper-spectral images of two different types of\ncultivation, i.e.,\
    \ vineyard and tomato. The images captured by the UAV platform are very high in\n\
    resolution, so more information can be extracted as compared to satellite images.\
    \ To assess the health\nof a crop, three types of Vegetation Index (VI) maps have\
    \ been computed.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n10 of 25\nTable 7. UAV platforms for\

    Camera\n3.2. Vegetation Indices\nUsing multi-spectral images from the remote sensors\
    \ described above, a series of Vegetation\nIndices (VIs) can be computed. Vegetation\
    \ Indices (VIs) obtained from remote sensing-based canopies\nare effective algorithms\
    \ for quantitative and qualitative evaluations of vigour, vegetation cover and\n\
    growth dynamics, among other applications [26]. Hitherto, no uniﬁed mathematical\
    \ expression exists\nthat deﬁnes all VIs due to the complexity of the several\
    \ light spectra combinations, instrumentation,\nresolutions and platforms used.\
    \ In particular, this section focuses on vegetation indices NDVI, GDVI\nand SAVI,\
    \ as they are widely used in PA.\n3.2.1. NDVI\nThe Normalized Difference Vegetation\
    \ Index (NDVI) is the most popular VI that is extensively\nused to ﬁnd the content\
    \ of green in PA applications [27,28]. It uses Red (R) and Near Infrared (NIR)\n\
    channels to compute the NDVI index. More NIR light is absorbed by healthy vegetation;\
    \ however,\nabsorption ratio is very small for red light. NDVI is computed by\
    \ Equation (1) and returns a value\nbetween −1 and 1 [29].\nNDVI = NIR − R\nNIR\
    \ + R\n(1)\nHigher NDVI value indicate healthy vegetation, while smaller values\
    \ of NDVI show that vegetation is\nvery small at that speciﬁc region. There is\
    \ another form of NDVI, i.e., the Green Normalized Vegetation\nIndex (GNDVI),\
    \ which uses the green channel instead of red. GNDVI is computed by Equation (2):\n\
    GNDVI = NIR − G\nNIR + G\n(2)\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n11 of 25\n3.2.2. Difference\
    \ Vegetation Index\nThe DVI was proposed to reduce the effect of soil reﬂectance,\
    \ which is not covered by NDVI [30].\nDVI is different between the reﬂectance\
    \ of the NIR band to the reﬂectance of the red band. DVI is also\ncomputed with\
    \ the green band, i.e., GDVI. Both DVI and GDVI are computed by Equations (3)\
    \ and (4):\nDVI = NIR − R\n(3)\nGDVI = NIR − G\n(4)\n3.2.3. SAVI\nNDVI and DVI\
    \ do not compensate the background effect of soil. Therefore, many vegetation\n\
    indices were introduced to compensate the effect of soil reﬂectance. The Soil\
    \ Adjusted Vegetation Index\n(SAVI), the Green Soil Adjusted vegetation Index\
    \ (GSAVI), the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation\nIndex (OSAVI), the Green Optimized\
    \ Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OGSAVI) and the Modiﬁed\nSoil Adjusted Vegetation\
    \ Index (MSAVI) [31–33] are common among them, which are computed by\nEquations\
    \ (5)–(9):\nSAVI =\n1.5(NIR − R)\n(NIR + R + 0.5)\n(5)\nGSAVI = 1.5(NIR − G)\n\
    NIR + G + 0.5\n(6)\nOSAVI =\n(NIR − G)\nNIR + R + 0.16\n(7)\nGOSAVI =\n(NIR −\
    \ G)\nNIR + G + 0.16\n(8)\nMSAVI = 0.5[2(NIR + 1) −\nq\n(2NIR + 1)2 − 8(NIR −\
    \ R)]\n(9)\n3.2.4. NR and NG:\nNormalized Red (NR) and Normalized Green (NG) are\
    \ two other famous vegetation indices being\nused in PA [33]. NR focuses on the\
    \ part of spectrum where radiation is absorbed by chlorophyll, while\nNG focuses\
    \ on the part of the spectrum where radiation is absorbed by other pigments, excluding\n\
    chlorophyll. NR and NG are computed by Equations (10) and (11):\nNR =\nR\nNIR\
    \ + R + G\n(10)\nNG =\nG\nNIR + R + G\n(11)\n4. Wireless Sensor Network Applications\
    \ in Agriculture\nMultiple applications of wireless sensor networks are being\
    \ utilized today in the agriculture sector.\nSome very common applications are\
    \ smart irrigation, smart fertilization, smart pest control and green\nhouse monitoring.\n\
    4.1. Smart Irrigation Systems\nSmart irrigation is an artiﬁcial irrigation application\
    \ that controls the quantity of water by making\na decision about where water\
    \ is needed. It is the most signiﬁcant constituent in agriculture, which has\n\
    a great impact on crops’ health, cost and productivity. One major aspect of smart\
    \ irrigation is to avoid\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n12 of 25\nthe wastage of water\
    \ since most countries in the world are facing water scarcity problems. A smart\n\
    irrigation system was presented in [34] in which a Raspberry Pi was used along\
    \ with two sensors:\na soil moisture sensor was used to assess the water level\
    \ in the soil, while a temperature and humidity\nsensor was used to monitor the\
    \ environmental condition. The Raspberry Pi was connected to these\nsensors and\
    \ the water supply network. A mobile application was developed for remote monitoring\n\
    and remote water ﬂow control enabling both manual and automatic water ﬂow control.\
    \ In automatic\nmode, water ﬂow was automatically turned ON/OFF based on the water\
    \ level of the soil without\nhuman intervention. In manual mode, the user was\
    \ able to monitor the soil moisture level. An alert\nwas generated when the water\
    \ level of soil was getting below a speciﬁc threshold, and the user turned\nit\
    \ ON/OFF using a mobile application.\nPower is a big concern in IoT-based platforms,\
    \ so many researchers have developed power-\nefﬁcient systems. A power-efﬁcient\
    \ water irrigation system was presented using solar power [35]\nin which the controller\
    \ was connected to the soil sensor and water supply valve. The water valve\nwas\
    \ turned ON/OFF based on the water level monitored by the moisture sensor. The\
    \ power was\nsupplied by the solar panel, so the system was independent of any\
    \ external power module. Another\nsensor-based IoT system for water irrigation\
    \ was presented in [36] in which the controller controlled\nthe opening and closing\
    \ of a solenoid valve based on the water level of the soil. In addition, a series\
    \ of\nweather alerts were sent to the user via a mobile application to update\
    \ the temperature and humidity of\nthe environment, which had a direct inﬂuence\
    \ on the water level of the soil. In [37], an energy-efﬁcient\nirrigation system\
    \ for cultivated crops was presented using a wireless sensor network in which\
    \ water\nwas effectively controlled based on environmental conditions. This system\
    \ estimated the quantity of\nwater needed for normal irrigation based on the humidity,\
    \ temperature and wind speed collected by\nsensors along with historical data.\n\
    In [38], an IoT-based irrigation system was presented using soil moisture sensors\
    \ controlled by\nATMEGA 328P on an Arduino UNO board along with a GPRS module.\
    \ The data collected from the\nsensors were sent to the cloud, i.e., Things Speak,\
    \ where graphs were generated to visualize the data\ntrends. A web portal was\
    \ also designed where the farmer was able to check the status of water, if it\n\
    was ON/OFF. Similarly, a real-time prototype for an irrigation system was presented\
    \ in [39] in which\nsoil moisture sensors and soil temperature sensors were used\
    \ to assess the water status of the soil.\nRFID was used to transmit data to the\
    \ cloud for further data analysis. Using ATMEGA 328, a water\nsprinkler system\
    \ for smart irrigation was presented in [40] using temperature, humidity and soil\n\
    moisture sensors. The water sprinkler was controlled based on the soil moisture\
    \ level to save water\nand reduce human effort. In [41], a cost-effective drip\
    \ irrigation system for a home was proposed in\nwhich a Raspberry Pi, Arduino,\
    \ electronic water control valve and relay were used. ZigBee protocols\nwere used\
    \ for communication. The user turned ON/OFF the water valve by sending commands\
    \ to the\nRaspberry Pi, which further processed the commands through the Arduino.\n\
    The sensors placement is a big issue that affects the accuracy of sensors. A detailed\
    \ discussion of\nsoil moisture positioning in the ﬁeld and their accuracy was\
    \ presented in [42]. For real-time irrigation\nsystems, complete software and\
    \ hardware requirements, problems and challenges and advantages\nwere discussed\
    \ in [43] where a big picture of the complete system was provided.\n4.2. Smart\
    \ Fertilization System\nFertilizer is an artiﬁcial or natural substance having\
    \ some chemical elements used to enhance\nthe growth and productivity of plants.\
    \ Manual spraying is a common technique used for fertilization.\nHowever, the\
    \ optimal way of fertilization requires sensing capabilities to ﬁnd the exact\
    \ place where\nfertilizer is needed, which chemical components are missing and\
    \ the amount of fertilizer needed.\nIt is important to provide fertilizers in\
    \ a very precise amount in order to improve productivity [44].\nMultiple fertilization\
    \ techniques have been presented by researchers since the last decade using WSN\n\
    and IoT.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n13 of 25\nAn automated fertilization system\
    \ was presented in [45] using real-time sensors to measure the\nsoil fertility.\
    \ The system consisted of three modules including input, output and decision support.\n\
    The decision support module measured the optimal amount of fertilizers needed\
    \ for the growth of the\nplants based on the real-time sensory data captured by\
    \ the sensors. A mechanical sensor named the\n“Pendulum Meter” was introduced\
    \ in [46], which was used for optimal fertilization. This sensor was\nmounted\
    \ on the tractor to measure the density of the crop, so the corresponding fertilizer\
    \ spreader\nwas controlled based on the readings of this sensor. The IEEE 802.11\
    \ Wi-Fi module was used for\ncommunication along with GPS. Real-time data of soil\
    \ were collected by several sensors, i.e., soil\nmoisture, temperature, conductivity,\
    \ NO2, CO2, etc. A Geographical Information System (GIS) server\nwas used to interpolate\
    \ sensory data.\n4.3. Smart Pest Control and Early Disease Detection System\n\
    Pest attacks are the root cause of low productivity in the agriculture sector.\
    \ These pests result in\nseveral serious diseases in plants that affect the plant’s\
    \ growth. However, disease prediction provides\nearly warning to the farmers,\
    \ which enables them to make appropriate decisions to control the disease\non\
    \ time. Pest control systems are comprised of electronic devices that enable humans\
    \ to identify traps\nin a speciﬁc range of these electronic devices [47]. These\
    \ electronic devices are sensors capable of\ncalculating the environmental parameters\
    \ for further analysis.\nMuch research has been done in the agriculture sector\
    \ for early disease detection and pest control\nsystems using more advanced and\
    \ sophisticated technologies [48,49]. Multiple imagery sensors have\nbeen used\
    \ by different researchers to collect imagery data, such as: RGB sensors, ﬂuorescence\
    \ imagery\nsensors, spectral sensors and thermal sensors [50]. The thermal sensors\
    \ are used to measure the water\nstatus in the plant by measuring the temperature,\
    \ since this parameter has a direct inﬂuence on the\nwater level in the plants.\
    \ RGB images have three colour channels, i.e., red, green and blue, which\ncan\
    \ be used to perceive the biometric effect in the plants. Multi- and hyper-spectral\
    \ sensors capture\nimages containing the spatial information of objects in multiple\
    \ wavebands. The spatial resolution is\ndependent on the distance between the\
    \ object and the sensor. That is why satellite images contain less\nspatial resolution\
    \ as compared to low altitude platforms such as drones. The ﬂuorescence sensors\
    \ are\nused to distinguish the photosynthetic activities in the plants. Various\
    \ image processing techniques\nare applied to these imagery data to identify the\
    \ diseases in plants.\nIn [50], an IoT-based plants disease and pest prediction\
    \ system was presented to minimize the\nexcessive use of fungicides and insecticides.\
    \ Weather condition monitoring sensors, i.e., temperature,\ndew, humidity and\
    \ wind speed, are used to monitor weather parameters to ﬁnd a correlation between\n\
    pest growth with weather. The sensors have been deployed in orchards, and data\
    \ collected from these\nsensors are sent to the cloud. The farmer is informed\
    \ about the alarming condition of the pest attack\non the crops.\nFrom a different\
    \ point of view, hyper-spectral images are used to analyse crops’ health and pest\n\
    attack using manned or unmanned vehicles on which spectral cameras are mounted.\
    \ The captured\nimages are analysed in depth using machine learning techniques\
    \ to identify the disease in the plants.\nAdvance Neural Networks (ANNs) are more\
    \ common for processing imagery data due to their ability\nto learn complex structures\
    \ and patterns. Using hyper-spectral images, a system was presented [51] to\n\
    identify disease or pest attack in crops. The proposed system for disease detection\
    \ used an ANN with\nmultiple layers.\nEarly disease detection in sugar beet plants\
    \ was presented in [52]. For early detection, four\nsupervised classiﬁcation algorithms\
    \ were applied on spectral images. Spectral images were then\ncollected for each\
    \ image, and multiple vegetation indices were calculated to be used in predictive\n\
    and perspective analysis. The vegetation indices used were NVDI, SR, SIPI, PSSRaand\
    \ PSSRb, ARI,\nREP, mCAIand RRE. These vegetation indices values were used as\
    \ features in the dataset. Support\nVector Machine (SVM), ANN, and decision tree\
    \ were used for classiﬁcation. A comparative analysis\nwas performed which, showed\
    \ that SVM outperformed other classiﬁers for disease detection with an\nSensors\
    \ 2019, 19, 3796\n14 of 25\naccuracy of 97.12%. In [53], a data mining technique\
    \ was applied on the already collected dataset of\ntwo types of crops, i.e., wheat\
    \ and paddy (rice), in India. For dimension reduction, Sammon’s mapping\nwas used\
    \ for multi-dimension scaling, i.e., to reduce the dimension also for unsupervised\
    \ learning.\nFor high dimensional data, dimension reduction is required prior\
    \ to performing further data analysis\nfor better data visualization and accuracy,\
    \ since redundant dimensions reduce the effectiveness of\nany data analysis algorithms.\
    \ Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is a very often-used technique\nalong with\
    \ Sammon’s mapping. Data from multi-dimensions were reduced to two or three dimensions.\n\
    Then, the Self-Organized Maps (SOM) algorithm for clustering was used to ﬁnd correlations\
    \ between\nthe data. The accuracy comparison of SOM and Sammon’s mapping was presented,\
    \ which showed\nthat SOM performed better on a large dataset, while Sammon’s mapping\
    \ was suitable for small ones.\nSmart phones played important role in data acquisition,\
    \ which were further used to monitor the crops’\nhealth. In [54], the health of\
    \ wheat crop was monitored using near surface imagery captured by a smart\nphone.\
    \ The crop was classiﬁed as healthy or unhealthy based on the green level by computing\
    \ Gcc.\nMost of the applications in PA have been either IoT-based in which multiple\
    \ sensors are used to\nassess the health of the crop or remote sensing-based in\
    \ which crop health is assessed by performing\nsome computation on spectral images.\
    \ We can compare crop health monitoring application based\non some attributes\
    \ such as which sensors are used in particular applications, whether web or mobile\n\
    services are provided or not, etc. The comparative analysis of some existing crop\
    \ health monitoring\napplications is presented in Table 8 based on some attributes.\n\
    To precisely monitor the crop health, both IoT-based techniques and remote sensing\
    \ techniques\nshould be used together to provide more reliable and accurate information\
    \ about the crop. As a\nproof of concept, we present a case study in which a crop\
    \ health monitoring system based on IoT and\nremote sensing techniques is proposed.\
    \ We provide a complete end-to-end solution in the agriculture\ndomain by facilitating\
    \ the agricultural user with web and mobile services so that he/she could be\n\
    informed about the latest condition of the crop in a timely manner. In this way,\
    \ remedy actions could\nbe performed in time, which will result in enhanced production.\n\

    N\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n16 of 25\n5. A Case Study on UAV-Based and IoT-Based\
    \ Precision Agriculture\nWe developed a complete solution for crop health monitoring\
    \ based on IoT and remote sensing.\nIn the proposed system, crop health is monitored\
    \ using data collected from multiple IoT sensors,\nas well as NDVI mapping of\
    \ spectral images captured by a drone. The architecture of the proposed\nsystem\
    \ is shown in Figure 1, which was designed according to two main modules. The\
    \ ﬁrst module\nwas a wireless sensor network-based system in which multiple wireless\
    \ nodes were developed. Each\nwireless node was comprised of a soil moisture sensor\
    \ used to monitor the water level of the soil,\na soil temperature sensor used\
    \ to check the temperature of the soil and air temperature and humidity\nsensors.\
    \ These nodes were deployed across the ﬁeld in a star topology fashion where the\
    \ master node\ncollected readings from all slave nodes and transmitted the captured\
    \ reading to the back-end server for\nfurther processing. The master node acted\
    \ as a gateway node, which received data from all slave nodes\nusing NRF communication\
    \ module. After performing initial processing, the master node transmitted\nthe\
    \ data to the cloud using GSM communication technology. In the case of the unavailability\
    \ of the\nGSM network, this node stored the captured data and transmitted to the\
    \ cloud upon the availability\nof network.\nThe second module was used to monitor\
    \ crop health using multi-spectral imagery, which was\ncollected by a multi-spectral\
    \ camera mounted on a drone. The NDVI was computed using Equation (1)\nto classify\
    \ between healthy and unhealthy plants by measuring the chlorophyll content in\
    \ the crops,\nwhich was further used to localize the area under stress precisely.\n\
    All collected data were sent to the cloud where further analysis was performed.\
    \ The web portal\nwas designed to help the farmer monitor the crop proﬁle over\
    \ the whole life cycle. Currently, we are\nmonitoring soil moisture, soil temperature,\
    \ air moisture and air temperature readings in real time\nalong with NDVI mapping\

    \ including historical/real data visualization using graphs, weather monitoring,\
    \ NDVI mapping\nand the correlation among measured parameters. Figure 2 shows\

    \ an abnormal behaviour is observed in the crop, which help the farmer to take\n\
    remedy actions in a timely manner. The user interfaces of the mobile application\

    \ of the mobile application.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n18 of 25\n6. Results and\
    \ Discussion\n6.1. Analysis of the Data Collected by IoT Nodes\nThe developed\
    \ IoT nodes were deployed across the wheat ﬁelds of an area of 1.4375 hectare.\n\
    The selected area was located in Islamabad, Pakistan. The wheat ﬁelds are shown\
    \ in Figure 4 along\nwith the IoT node and sensors. We deployed the system across\
    \ the wheat ﬁeld in March 2019 when\nwheat was in the grain ﬁlling and grain ripening\
    \ stage.\nFigure 4. System deployed across the wheat ﬁelds.\nWe collected the\
    \ sensors’ readings such as air temperature, air humidity, soil temperature and\n\
    soil moisture. We compared the observed crop parameters with the ideal wheat temperature\
    \ proﬁle\nas shown in Figure 5. Extreme variation in the weather of Islamabad\
    \ was observed in that particular\ntime period, which can be seen by how the actual\
    \ temperature for wheat crop deviated from the ideal\ntemperature proﬁle of the\
    \ wheat crop.\nFigure 5. Deviation of observed temperature from the ideal temperature\
    \ proﬁle.\nAdditionally, we performed linear regression to ﬁnd the correlation\
    \ between observed parameters,\nwhich provided insight into how changes in one\
    \ parameter can effect the other parameter. The linear\nregression found a relation\
    \ between the two parameters by ﬁtting the equation of the line using the\nobserved\
    \ dataset [69]. Equation (12) represents an equation of the line where mrepresents\
    \ the slope of\nline, while c indicates the y-intercept. The variables m and c\
    \ were learned from the data.\ny = mx + c\n(12)\nFigure 6A shows the correlation\
    \ between the observed air temperature and air humidity, which showed\nthat both\
    \ were negatively correlated. The correlation between air temperature and soil\
    \ temperature is\nshown in Figure 6B, which shows that both were positively correlated.\n\

    \ and air humidity. (B) Correlation b/w air temperature\nand soil temperature.\n\
    The rise in air temperature caused the air humidity to reduce, while it resulted\
    \ in an increase in\nsoil temperature and vice versa.\n6.2. Analysis of Multi-spectral\
    \ Images Captured by Drone\nTo collect multi-spectral imagery, we used the DJI-Phantom\
    \ Pro Advanced drone with the Sentera\nMulti-spectral-imaging sensor. The drone\
    \ had its own optical camera, while the multi-spectral camera\nwas mounted on\
    \ it to obtain spectral images. Multiple ﬂights of the drone were carried out\
    \ at the\nspeciﬁc growing stages of the crop, i.e., grain ripening and grain ﬁlling\
    \ stage. After collecting these\nimages, they were transferred to the cloud for\
    \ NDVI mapping. Figure 7A shows the optical image\nthat was captured on 16 May\
    \ 2019 when wheat was in the harvesting stage, while Figure 7B is its\nspectral\
    \ image, and Figure 7C is the NDVI mapping. Since wheat was at a mature stage,\
    \ its NDVI\nshould be very small, i.e., ideally there should be no green region\
    \ in the ﬁeld. However, in NDVI\nmapping, a large green region indicated the abnormal\
    \ behaviour of the crop. The green region was\ndue to naturally growing plants.\
    \ This information can be visualized on the web portal.\n(A)\n(B)\n(C)\nFigure\
    \ 7. Wheat crop. (A) Optical image; (B) spectral image; (C) NDVI mapping.\nThe\
    \ same process was performed in a maize ﬁeld when maize was in the grain ripening\
    \ stage.\nFigure 8A shows the optical image that was captured on 24 July 2019\
    \ when maize was in the grain\nripening stage, while Figure 8B is its spectral\
    \ image, and Figure 8C is the NDVI mapping. The same\nbehaviour can be observed\
    \ with the maize crop, i.e., there should be a minimal green region in the\nﬁeld.\
    \ However, in NDVI mapping, a large green region indicated the abnormal behaviour\
    \ of the crop.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n20 of 25\n(A)\n(B)\n(C)\nFigure 8. Maize\
    \ crop. (A) Optical image; (B) spectral image; (C) NDVI mapping.\n7. Challenges\n\
    PA has been used since the last few decades to enhance crops’ yield with reduced\
    \ costs and\nhuman effort, although the adoption of these novel techniques by\
    \ farmers is still very limited owing to\nthe following reasons or challenges.\n\
    7.1. Hardware Cost\nPA relies mostly on hardware such as sensors, wireless nodes,\
    \ drones, spectral imaging sensors,\netc., which are used to assess multiple parameters\
    \ in real time. These sensors have multiple limitations\nincluding high development,\
    \ maintenance and deployment cost. Some systems in PA are cost effective\nand\
    \ are suitable for small arable land, i.e., smart irrigation systems that require\
    \ low-cost hardware\ncomponents and sensors. However, drone-based systems for\
    \ crops’ health monitoring are feasible for\nlarge arable land due to high installation\
    \ cost.\n7.2. Weather Variations\nEnvironmental variation is one of the major\
    \ challenges that affects the accuracy of data collected\nby sensors. Sensor nodes\
    \ deployed in the ﬁeld are sensitive to environmental variations, i.e., rain,\n\
    ﬂuctuation in temperature, wind speed, sun light, etc. Communication between wireless\
    \ nodes\nand the cloud can be interrupted due interference induced in wireless\
    \ communication channels by\natmospheric disturbance. The satellite, air borne\
    \ and drone platforms are also sensitive to weather\nvariations. Imagery acquired\
    \ by these platforms is affected by contamination of clouds and other\nnatural\
    \ aerosols. The development of advanced techniques for atmospheric correction,\
    \ cloud detection\nand noise interpolation is a current open challenge, which\
    \ requires hard efforts from the research\ncommunity.\n7.3. Data Management\n\
    The sensors in PA constantly generate data. To ensure the integrity of data, some\
    \ data security\nmeasures needs to be in place, which will in turn enhance the\
    \ cost of the system. The readings from\nthe sensors have to be accurate in order\
    \ to take appropriate actions precisely when and where required.\nAn intruder\
    \ can corrupt the readings, and false readings will adversely reduce the effectiveness\
    \ of\nthe system. PA systems generate immense amounts of data, which require enough\
    \ resources to\nperform data analysis. Real-time data collected from sensors deployed\
    \ across the ﬁelds after a few\nminutes and spectral imagery acquired from high-altitude\
    \ or low-altitude platforms produce the bulk\nof the data, which increase the\
    \ storage and processing requirements. New software platforms and\nfacilities\
    \ for scalable management of Big Data sources are demanded. In this regard, the\
    \ generation\nof software-as-a-service solutions is focused on merging data management\
    \ and IoT thorough cloud\ncomputing platforms.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n21 of\
    \ 25\n7.4. Literacy Rate\nLiteracy is an important factor that inﬂuences the adoption\
    \ ratio in PA. In developing countries\nwhere the illiteracy rate is high, farmers\
    \ grow crops based on their experience. They do not utilize the\nstate-of-the-art\
    \ technologies in agriculture, which results in loss of production. Farmers need\
    \ to be\neducated in order to understand the technology or they have to trust\
    \ a third party for technical support.\nTherefore, in underdeveloped areas where\
    \ the literacy rate is not high, PA is not very common due to\nthe limitations\
    \ of resources and education.\n7.5. Connectivity\nNext-generation 5G networks\
    \ can be 100-times faster than 4G ones, making communication\nbetween devices\
    \ and servers much quicker. 5G can also carry much more data than other networks,\n\
    which makes it an ideal technology for transmitting information from remote sensors\
    \ and drones, key\ntools that are being tested in PA environments. The adoption\
    \ of new communication networks based\non 5G is a must in current applications\
    \ where secure and rapid data transfer enables real-time data\nmanagement and\
    \ support for decision making.\n7.6. Interoperability\nOne of the biggest problems\
    \ PA faces is the interoperability of equipment due to different digital\nstandards.\
    \ This lack of interoperability is not only obstructing the adoption of new IoT\
    \ technologies\nand slowing down their growth, but it also inhibits the gain of\
    \ production efﬁciency through smart\nagriculture applications. New methods and\
    \ protocols to integrate different machine communication\nstandards to unlock\
    \ the potential of efﬁcient machine-to-machine communication and data sharing\n\
    between machines and management information systems are required in the current\
    \ scenario of PA.\n8. Conclusion and Future Directions\nPrecision agriculture\
    \ is a modern practice used to enhance crops’ productivity using latest\ntechnologies,\
    \ i.e., WSN, IoT, cloud computing, Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning\n\
    (ML). Most of the research done so far indicates that PA-based practices have\
    \ a great inﬂuence on\nsustainability and productivity. The objective of PA is\
    \ to provide decision support systems based\non multiple parameters of crops,\
    \ i.e., soil nutrients, water level of the soil, wind speed, intensity of\nsunlight,\
    \ temperature, humidity, chlorophyll content, etc. However, several challenges\
    \ are involved\nin the development and deployment phase of these systems. This\
    \ article was aimed at providing a\nsurvey of modern technologies involving current\
    \ PA platforms, with the goal of supporting industry\nand research communities\
    \ on the development of modern applications for smart agriculture. A case\nstudy\
    \ was presented to prove the effectiveness of the PA in the agriculture domain.\n\
    Since the main objective of precision agriculture is to produce surplus yield\
    \ by optimizing the\nresources such as water, pesticides, fertilizers, etc., for\
    \ resource optimization, prescription maps play\nan important role, which enables\
    \ farmers to quantify resources required for healthy crops at any\nparticular\
    \ growth stage. Most of the research accomplished in the agriculture domain focuses\
    \ on the\nremote sensing platforms to collect imagery, which reﬂects only Vegetation\
    \ Indices (VIs) such as NDVI.\nThe prescription maps cannot be generated by only\
    \ using VIs; instead, multiple other factors need to\nbe considered such as soil\
    \ properties, soil moisture level, meteorological behaviour, etc.\nFunding: This\

    1Food safety is becoming more and more serious topic worldwide. To tackle the
    food safety issues from the technical aspect, people need a trusted food traceability
    system that can track and monitor the whole lifespan of food production, including
    the processes of food raw material cultivation/breeding, processing, transporting,
    warehousing, and selling etc. In this paper, we propose a trusted, self-organized,
    open and ecological food traceability system based on blockchain and Internet
    of Things (IoT) technologies, which involves all parties of a smart agriculture
    ecosystem, even if they may not trust each other. We use IoT devices to replace
    manual recording and verification as many as possible, which can reduce the human
    intervention to the system effectively. Furthermore, we plan to use the smart
    contract technology to help the law-executor to find problems and process them
    timely. References X. Gu, Y. Chai, Y. Liu, J. Shen, Y. Huang, and Y. Nan. 2017.

    Emerging applications such as Internet of Everything, Holographic Telepresence,
    collaborative robots, and space and deep-sea tourism are already highlighting
    the limitations of existing fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks. These limitations
    are in terms of data-rate, latency, reliability, availability, processing, connection
    density and global coverage, spanning over ground, underwater and space. The sixth-generation
    (6G) of mobile networks are expected to burgeon in the coming decade to address
    these limitations. The development of 6G vision, applications, technologies and
    standards has already become a popular research theme in academia and the industry.
    In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of the current developments towards
    6G. We highlight the societal and technological trends that initiate the drive
    towards 6G. Emerging applications to realize the demands raised by 6G driving
    trends are discussed subsequently. We also elaborate the requirements that are
    necessary to realize the 6G applications. Then we present the key enabling technologies
    in detail. We also outline current research projects and activities including
    standardization efforts towards the development of 6G. Finally, we summarize lessons
    learned from state-of-the-art research and discuss technical challenges that would
    shed a new light on future research directions towards 6G. Published in: IEEE

    \ success in health care, smart city,\nindustrial production and so on. Protected\
    \ agriculture is one of the ﬁelds which has broad application\nprospects of IoT.\
    \ Protected agriculture is a mode of highly eﬃcient development of modern agriculture\n\
    that uses artiﬁcial techniques to change climatic factors such as temperature,\
    \ to create environmental\nconditions suitable for the growth of animals and plants.\
    \ This review aims to gain insight into\nthe state-of-the-art of IoT applications\
    \ in protected agriculture and to identify the system structure\nand key technologies.\
    \ Therefore, we completed a systematic literature review of IoT research\nand\
    \ deployments in protected agriculture over the past 10 years and evaluated the\
    \ contributions\nmade by diﬀerent academicians and organizations. Selected references\
    \ were clustered into three\napplication domains corresponding to plant management,\
    \ animal farming and food/agricultural\nproduct supply traceability. Furthermore,\
    \ we discussed the challenges along with future research\nprospects, to help new\
    \ researchers of this domain understand the current research progress of IoT in\n\
    protected agriculture and to propose more novel and innovative ideas in the future.\n\
    Keywords: Internet of things; protected agriculture; integrated application; state-of-the-art\n\
    1. Introduction\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) was ﬁrst developed in 1999 by the\
    \ network radio frequency\nidentiﬁcation (RFID) system proposed by the Massachusetts\
    \ Institute of Technology (MIT) Auto-ID\nLabs [1]. With the application and development\
    \ of new information technologies, the connotation\nand extension of IoT have\
    \ undergone major changes [2]. IoT can be deﬁned as a huge internet-based\nnetwork\
    \ connecting physical and virtual “things” with standard and interoperable communication\n\
    protocols. To be speciﬁc, everything, such as a sensor and an actuator possessing\
    \ unique identity\nand attribute, exchange messages and communicate with each\
    \ other to realize intelligent positioning,\ntracking, identiﬁcation, perception,\
    \ monitoring and management via kinds of networks anytime and\nanywhere [3]. IoT\
    \ has penetrated pervasively most aspects of human life everywhere such as health\n\
    care, smart home, smart city, industrial control and so on. Agriculture is an\
    \ ideal candidate for the\ndeployment of IoT solutions because it occurs in wide\
    \ areas that need to be continuously monitored\nand controlled [4,5].\nThe concept\
    \ of protected agriculture is relative to open-ﬁeld agriculture. It uses artiﬁcial\
    \ techniques\nto change climatic factors such as natural light, temperature and\
    \ humidity to create environmental\nconditions suitable for the growth of animals\
    \ and plants, enabling them to grow around the clock.\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833;\
    \ doi:10.3390/s19081833\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n\
    2 of 24\nThe environment of protected agriculture is completely or largely artiﬁcially\
    \ controlled andwhich has\nbroken the limits of climate and land conditions for\
    \ the growth of animals and plants to a certain extent.\nSo it is also called\
    \ controllable agriculture. Compared with open-ﬁeld agriculture, protected agriculture\n\
    has more potential to apply IoT technology, because it is less aﬀected by climatic\
    \ and geographical\nfactors. Some mature IoT solutions in other ﬁelds can be transferred\
    \ directly to protected agriculture [6].\nWith the development of agricultural\
    \ sensor, wireless communication, cloud computing,\nmachine learning and Big Data\
    \ technologies, IoT technology has emerged and is gradually being\npromoted and\
    \ applied in the protected agriculture ﬁeld [7–9]. It is playing an important\
    \ role in various\nareas of protected agriculture as it is capable of helping\
    \ farmers monitor soil condition, climate change\nand animal and plant health\
    \ [10]. When the environmental factor change beyond the set threshold,\nIoT will\
    \ automatically send a warning message to the administrator to remove the hidden\
    \ danger.\nIt can also control environmental factors such as temperature, humidity,\
    \ carbon dioxide concentration\nand illumination according to the condition of\
    \ crop growth in real time [11,12]. In addition, cameras in\nthe IoT system are\
    \ able to capture crop diseases and insect pests in the greenhouse in real time,\n\
    helping farmers ﬁnd problems and take targeted preventive measures [13]. Through\
    \ GPS, RFID and\nother location-based sensors, goods such as vegetables can be\
    \ tracked and monitored visually during\ntransportation and storage. Supermarket\
    \ managers use smart phone or PC to monitor and predict\nproduct status and the\
    \ demand for getting product on shelves. At the user or consumer end, people can\n\
    query the variety, origin, processing and other farm product information by means\
    \ of the QR code,\nbarcode, etc. IoT for protected agriculture can help create\
    \ an informed, connected, developed and\nadaptable rural community. Low-cost embedded\
    \ devices can improve the interaction between humans\nand the physical world.\
    \ Cloud computing, edge computing, and Big Data can provide valuable analysis\n\
    and support for decisions. In summary, IoT will become an important tool in the\
    \ next few years to\nengage people in embedded agriculture which includes suppliers,\
    \ farmers, technicians, distributors,\nmerchants, consumers and government representatives\
    \ [14,15].\nOn the basis of the potential of IoT applications in protected agriculture\
    \ described in the previous\nparagraphs, this paper aims to identify the current\
    \ state of solutions in these ﬁelds. The IoT fundamental\nstructure in protected\
    \ agriculture is introduced in detail based on agricultural sensors, wireless\
    \ sensor\nnetworks, cloud computing, edge clouding and machine learning technologies.\
    \ The application of IoT\nin protected agriculture and how it makes contributions\
    \ is displayed. Furthermore, the open issues,\nchallenges, future opportunities\
    \ and development trends are discussed.\nIn this article, a comprehensive and\
    \ profound review of IoT in protected agriculture has been\nexecuted based on\
    \ a survey of real-world deployments and published papers over the past 10 years.\n\
    Firstly, a keyword-based search for conference papers and articles was performed\
    \ mainly from the\nscientiﬁc databases IEEE Xplore, Science Direct and ACM Digital\
    \ as well as from Google Scholar.\nFor search keywords, we used the following\
    \ query: “Internet of Things” and either “greenhouse”\nor “livestock” or “aquaculture“\
    \ or “agriculture“. Then, we ﬁltered out papers referring to IoT but\nnot applied\
    \ to the protected agricultural domain. Finally, we checked these papers selected\
    \ from the\nprevious step and picked out the ﬁnal papers according to the problem\
    \ they addressed, the solution\nproposed, impact achieved (if measurable), tools,\
    \ systems and algorithms used.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows.\
    \ Section 2 presents the structure of IoT in protected\nagriculture. The key technologies\
    \ of IoT in protected agriculture are introduced in Section 3. The three\nimportant\
    \ applications in protected agriculture are summed up in Section 4. We further\
    \ discussed\nthe challenges to be faced and the problems that need to be solved\
    \ for IoT in protected agriculture as\nwell as a few future development directions\
    \ in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 outlines the conclusions of\nthis paper.\n\

    2.1. Simple Review of Previous IoT Structure\nAt present, there is no uniﬁed opinion\
    \ on the structure of IoT. The composition of IoT can be\ndivided into three parts:\
    \ object end, cloud end and network end. Smart items, smart devices and\nlocal\
    \ intelligent systems interact directly with the physical world to form the “object\
    \ end” of IoT\n(also known as “front end”). The cloud computing platform that\
    \ provides computing, storage and\nother resources performs fusion processing\
    \ and intelligent analysis of the sensing data from the object\nend and performs\
    \ execution control to constitute the “cloud end” (also referred to as “back end”)\
    \ of\nIoT. The communication infrastructure of the connection object end and the\
    \ cloud end constitutes the\n“network end” of IoT. According to the diﬀerent functions\
    \ implemented by physical entity services\nin the IoT, IoT architecture established\
    \ by the current service-oriented approach can be divided into\nthe following\
    \ two categories: cloud-centric IoT architecture and object-centric IoT architecture.\
    \ In the\ncloud-centric IoT application system, the physical entity service implements\
    \ basic physical information\ncollection, local information processing and transmission\
    \ of information to the cloud, but does not\nprovide a directly accessible service\
    \ interface. Mass storage, relational processing and knowledge\nmining of physical\
    \ information are all implemented in the cloud. One of their typical representatives\n\
    is uID IoT architecture, which is an IoT architecture developed by the uID center\
    \ of the nonproﬁt\nstandardization organization initiated by the university of\
    \ Tokyo, Japan. As shown in Figure 1,\nits architecture consisted of ucode tags\
    \ such as RFID, bar codes, RF and IR beacons, user terminals,\na ucode resolution\
    \ server and application information servers [16]. For software developers, the\
    \ main\nchallenge in building such systems is how to build a back-end cloud service\
    \ platform that supports\nmassive item information management and data processing.\
    \ The cloud platforms that have been\nestablished so far mainly include Xively\
    \ and Aneka [17].\nSensors 2018, 18, x FOR PEER REVIEW  \n3 of 25 \n \n2. The\

    \ \n2.2. Structure of IoT in Protected Agriculture \nBased on the actual situation\
    \ of protected agriculture and the experience of other scholars, we \nproposed\
    \ a five-layer IoT architecture [22]. As shown in Figure 5, these layers are briefly\
    \ described \nbelow: \n(1). Perception layer: This layer consists of various sensors,\
    \ terminal devices, agricultural \nmachinery, wireless sensor network (WSN), RFID\
    \ tags andreaders, etc. The common sensors \nare environmental sensors, animal\
    \ and plant life information sensors and other sensors related \nto agriculture.\
    \ Through these sensors, information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed,\
    \ \nplant diseases, insect pests and animal vital signs can be obtained. The collected\
    \ information is \nsimply processed by the embedded device and uploaded to a higher\
    \ layer through the \nnetwork layer for further processing and analysis. \n(2).\
    \ Network layer: The network layer is the infrastructure of IoT, which includes\
    \ a converged \nnetwork formed by various communication networks and the internet.\
    \ The transmission \nmedium can be wired technology such as CAN bus and RS485\
    \ bus or wireless technology like \nZigbee, Bluetooth, LoRa and NB-IoT. The network\
    \ layer not only transmits various kinds of \nagricultural related information\
    \ collected by the perception layer to the higher layer, but also \nsends the\
    \ control commands of the application layer to the perception layer, so that the\
    \ related \ndevices of the sensing layer take corresponding actions.  \n(3). Middleware\
    \ layer: IoT can provide different types of services for different devices. The\
    \ technical \nspecifications (processor, power supply, communication module) and\
    \ system of each device \nare different and different devices cannot be connected\
    \ and communicated with each other, \nwhich leads to heterogeneity problems. The\
    \ middleware layer aggregates, filters and processes \nreceived data from IoT\
    \ devices, which greatly reduces the processing time and cost of the \nabove issues\
    \ and provides developers with a more versatile tool to build their applications.\
    \ It \nalso simplifies the steps of new service development and new device deployment\
    \ which \nFigure 4. IoT-A IoT framework [21].\n2.2. Structure of IoT in Protected\
    \ Agriculture\nBased on the actual situation of protected agriculture and the\

    \ kinds of agricultural\nrelated information collected by the perception layer\
    \ to the higher layer, but also sends the control\ncommands of the application\
    \ layer to the perception layer, so that the related devices of the\nsensing layer\
    \ take corresponding actions.\n(3).\nMiddleware layer: IoT can provide diﬀerent\
    \ types of services for diﬀerent devices. The technical\nspeciﬁcations (processor,\
    \ power supply, communication module) and system of each device\nare diﬀerent\
    \ and diﬀerent devices cannot be connected and communicated with each other,\n\
    which leads to heterogeneity problems. The middleware layer aggregates, ﬁlters\
    \ and processes\nreceived data from IoT devices, which greatly reduces the processing\
    \ time and cost of the above\nissues and provides developers with a more versatile\

    \ Crucial Technologies of IoT in Protected Agriculture\n3.1. Sensor Technology\n\
    Sensor plays an indispensable role in obtaining environment, plant and animal\
    \ information and it\nis also one of the technical bottlenecks in the development\
    \ of IoT. In recent years, sensor technology\nhas rapidly developed with the emergence\
    \ of new materials and methods [23]. The conventional\nenvironment sensors such\
    \ as temperature, humidity, light intensity, heat and gas sensors have been\n\
    relatively mature and widely deployed in protected agriculture. Nowaday, about\
    \ 6000 research and\nproduction organizations engage in sensor research from more\
    \ than 40 countries, including famous\nmanufacturers such as Honeywell, Foxboro,\
    \ ENDEVCO, Bell & Howell and Solartron companies.\nThere are three main types\
    \ of widely used and researched agricultural sensors: physical property type\n\
    sensors, biosensors and micro electro mechanical system sensors (MEMS). The physical\
    \ property type\nsensor realizes the signal conversion through the physical change\
    \ of the sensitivity of the material\nof the sensor itself, which is mainly temperature,\
    \ humidity and gas sensor. The biosensor [24] uses\nthe organism itself as a sensitive\
    \ component to transmit information according to the reaction of the\norganism\
    \ to the outside world and includes enzyme sensor [25], microbial sensor, adaptive\
    \ sensor [26],\netc., which is mainly used to detect pesticide residue, heavy\
    \ metal ion, antibiotic residue and toxic\ngas [27,28]. The MEMS sensor is the\
    \ embodiment of the new generation of research and development\ntechnology in\
    \ the ﬁeld of sensors with small size, low power consumption, low cost and reliability\
    \ [29].\nAlthough sensor technology has made great strides in both principles\
    \ and manufacturing\nprocesses, there are still some open issues. A typical example\
    \ among those open issue is the research\nand development of soil sensors and\
    \ vital sign information sensors of animal and plant, which is an\nurgent conundrum\
    \ to overcome in long time. The complex composition as well as diﬀerent physical\n\
    and chemical properties of soil turn the rapid and situ measurement of soil nitrogen\
    \ and other elements\ninto an international diﬃculty. Since the life process of\
    \ animals and plants is very complicated, in order\nto realize the accurate detection\
    \ of information about their life, it is necessary to make breakthroughs in\n\
    the physical mechanism and measurement model of the life process. Related research\
    \ has been carried\nout using physicochemical properties, spectroscopy, multispectral,\
    \ hyper-spectral, nuclear magnetic\nresonance as well as other detection methods\
    \ [30–33].\nAnother problem is the promotion and application of these sensors.\
    \ For one thing there is still\na lack of uniform technical standards in the collection,\
    \ transmission and the interface with the platform\nand human-computer interaction\
    \ interface; for another, the cost has limited the large scale application\nof\
    \ fresh sensors in intelligent agriculture. Currently, the cost of sensing equipment\
    \ for the collection and\ntransmission of animal and plant status is prohibitively\
    \ expensive for ordinary peasants. The number\nof nodes in a sensor network can\
    \ often reach tens of thousands. To make the sensor network practical,\nthe cost\
    \ of each node must be controlled within $1, but now the price is as high as $80\
    \ [34].\n3.2. Data Transmission Technology\nIn this section, the details of data\
    \ transmission technology are discussed, which is one of the vital\ntechnologies\
    \ for real-time dynamic acquisition of agricultural information. Diﬀerent from\
    \ industrial\napplication, agricultural information acquisition is not demanding\
    \ in timelines and a slight delay in\nthe transmission process has little eﬀect\
    \ on agricultural production.\nCompared with wired transmission technology such\
    \ as ﬁeldbus, wireless communication\ntechnology has advantages of low construction\
    \ and maintenance cost, low power consumption\nand excellent extensibility. Recently,\
    \ most researchers, organizations and manufacturers choose it\nto build up their\
    \ WSN in environment monitoring [35,36], automatic irrigation [37] and remote\n\
    control [38]. As shown in Table 1, the summary of popular wireless technologies\
    \ and basic parameters\nwas presented. Diﬀerent vendors and research institutes\
    \ have developed their own wireless devices\nbased on these wireless protocols,\
    \ which has somewhat increased the heterogeneity of IoT. In addition,\nwireless\
    \ signals of diﬀerent protocols located in the same band can cause mutual interference\
    \ such as\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n8 of 24\nZigBee, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth [39].\
    \ Wi-Fi has high communication speed but high power consumption,\nwhich is suitable\
    \ for sensor network deployment at ﬁxed points. Although Bluetooth has high security,\n\
    its communication distance is too short and power consumption is high, which is\
    \ suitable for short-time\nclose-range networking. ZigBee has the advantages of\
    \ low consumption, low cost and self-organization\nand each node can be used as\
    \ a relay station for transmitting data of adjacent nodes. So it easily expands\n\
    the coverage of the sensor network and is an ideal long-distance, large-range\
    \ sensor networking.\nTable 1. Summary of popular wireless technologies and basic\

    \ mW\nIn recent years, the Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) is one of IoT hotspots\
    \ and\nthought as a novel technology with great development potential, which is\
    \ attributed to its huge\nadvantages such as ultra-long distance communication\
    \ and it can be used as an important complement\nof the traditional wireless local\
    \ area network (WLAN) and mobile cellular mobile communication\ntechnologies (such\
    \ as GSM and GPRS). At this stage, LPWAN has many technical standards, which can\n\
    be classiﬁed into two categories. The ﬁrst is a proprietary patented technology\
    \ that works under\nan unlicensed spectrum, such as LoRa, Sigfox and RPMA. The\
    \ second is a cellular communication\ntechnology that works under a licensed spectrum,\
    \ such as EC-GSM, eMTC and NB-IoT. Due to the use\nof dedicated frequency bands\
    \ and uniﬁed deployment by operators, licensed spectrum technology\nhas carrier-class\
    \ security and low interference characteristics, which forms full network coverage\n\
    and operation [40,41]. The unlicensed spectrum uses the common spectrum without\
    \ paying high\nspectrum costs but requires special handling of co-channel interference.\
    \ There are many beneﬁts of IoT\ndeployments based on LPWAN in the agricultural\
    \ environment. Firstly, the maximum connection\ndistance of the LPWAN terminal\
    \ device to the base station varies from several kilometers to several tens\n\
    of kilometers, which saves the trouble of setting up and maintaining routing devices.\
    \ Compared with\nthe 2.4 GHz band, LPWAN adopts the sub-1GHz band to acquire less\
    \ attenuation and multipath\nfading caused by obstacles and dense surfaces like\
    \ concrete walls [42,43]. Moverover, the sensitivity\nof state of the art LPWAN\
    \ receivers reaches as low as –130 dBm due to modulation techniques such\nas narrowband\
    \ and spread spectrum. Secondly, ultra low power operation is another advantage\
    \ of\nLPWAN which is achieved by duty cycling mechanism, lightweight medium access\
    \ control protocols\nand oﬄoading complex tasks [44]. Thirdly, most LPWAN technologies\
    \ support a large number of\ndevice connections by diversity techniques, adaptive\
    \ channel selection and data rate technologies,\netc. [45]. Finally, the LPWAN\
    \ connects a large number of end devices, while keeping the cost of\nhardware\
    \ below ﬁve dollars [46]. LPWAN technologies target a diverse set of applications\
    \ with varying\nrequirements in protected agriculture and therefore it should\
    \ provide some sort of quality of service\n(QoS) over the same underlying LPWAN\
    \ technology. However, current LPWAN technologies provide\nno or limited QoS.\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 1833\n9 of 24\nMeanwhile, mobile cellular communication technology\
    \ has undergone four generations of\ntechnology updates and the ﬁfth-generation\
    \ mobile communication technology (5G) was announced in\n2016, which will make\
    \ large ﬁle transfer such as agricultural images and audio a reality and bring\
    \ new\nimpetus to the agricultural IoT. From the perspective of future research,\
    \ the research of wireless sensor\nnetworks focuses mainly on communication, energy\
    \ conservation, network control and its application\nin agricultural monitoring.\n\
    3.3. WSN\nThe WSN consists of a lot of sensor nodes that are usually powered by\
    \ battery and it is a multi-hop\nself-organizing network system formed by wireless\
    \ communication to collaboratively sense, collect and\nprocess various information\
    \ of the perceived object in the network coverage area [47,48]. It can be\ndivided\
    \ into terrestrial WSN and wireless underground sensor networks (WUSN). The agricultural\n\
    sensors are usually planted into soil and lower frequency wireless technologies\
    \ are more selected\ndue to low attenuation in WUSN. Besides, antenna size and\
    \ energy consumption in WUSN is higher\nthan terrestrial WSN [49]. With development\
    \ of LPWAN, IoT may not need a mesh-style WSN with\npower-based routing, where\
    \ one node forwards packets of other nodes.\n3.4. Cloud Computing\nCloud computing\
    \ grew out of distributed computing, parallel processing and grid computing.\n\
    It is an Internet-based computing system that provides hardware services, infrastructure\
    \ services,\nplatform services, software services and storage services to various\
    \ IoT applications. Its essence is\na system for dynamically deploying and allocating/redistributing\
    \ as well as dynamic monitoring\nof virtualized computing and storage resource\
    \ pools, thereby providing users with computing,\ndata storage and platform services\
    \ that meet QoS requirements [50,51]. It played a strong role in\npromoting the\
    \ development of agricultural IoT. Firstly, cloud computing can provide farmers\
    \ with cheap\ndata storage services for text, image, video and other agricultural\
    \ information, which greatly reduces\nthe storage costs of agricultural enterprises\
    \ [52]. Secondly, it is diﬃcult to make direct use of these raw\ndata for making\
    \ decisions based on the technical level of farmers. Agricultural experts can\
    \ only make\naccurate judgments and give suggestions based on quantitative analysis.\
    \ Only cloud computing can\nsupport intelligent large-scale computing systems\
    \ [53,54]. Thirdly, cloud computing could provide\na secure platform for the development\
    \ of various IoT applications such as crop monitoring [55].\n3.5. Edge Computing\n\
    Edge computing refers to a new computing model that performs calculations at the\
    \ edge of the\nnetwork [56]. In the edge computing, the downlink data of the edge\
    \ represents the cloud service,\nthe uplink data represents IoT service and the\
    \ edge of edge computing refers to any computing\nand network resources between\
    \ the data source and the cloud computing center path. Because the\ncomputing\
    \ task is partially migrated to the network edge device, edge hormone can improve\
    \ data\ntransmission performance, ensure real-time processing and reduce the computational\
    \ load of the cloud\ncomputing center. Moreover, edge computing better protects\
    \ data because processing occurs closer to\nthe source than in cloud computing\
    \ [57,58].\n3.6. Machine Learning\nMachine learning (ML) is a smart way for computers\
    \ to simulate people’s learning activities, acquire\nnew knowledge, continuously\
    \ improve performance and implement their own perfection. In recent\nyears, machine\
    \ learning has achieved great success in algorithm, theory and application [59]\
    \ and have\nbeen combined with other agricultural technologies to maximized crop\
    \ yield while minimizing the input\ncosts [60]. The main machine learning algorithms\
    \ are naïve bayes, discriminant analysis, K-nearest\nneighbor, support vector\
    \ machine (SVM) [61], K-means clusterin, fuzzy clustering, gaussian mixture\n\
    models, artiﬁcial neural network (ANN), deep learning [62], decision tree algorithm\
    \ and so on [63].\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n10 of 24\nML can discover the internal\
    \ connection between messy, modelless and complex agricultural\ndata, make accurate\
    \ predictions and provide a theoretical basis for agricultural decision-making.\n\
    Machinelearning technology is playing an important role in crop breeding, disease\
    \ identiﬁcation,\npest and disease prediction, intelligent irrigation planning\
    \ and agricultural expert systems [64–67].\nFor example, ML technology can analyze\
    \ past farmland data, including the performance of crops under\ndiﬀerent climatic\
    \ conditions and the inheritance of a particular phenotype. As well, ML technology\n\
    can explore the association rules and then build a probability model to predict\
    \ which genes are\nmost likely to participate in the expression of a certain good\
    \ trait of the plant, which can help the\nbreeding expert conduct a reasonable\
    \ breeding experiment [68–70]. Kyosuke et al. came up with\na method for detecting\
    \ the maturity of a single intact tomato-based ML, which consisted of three\n\
    steps: pixel-based segmentation, blob-based segmentation and individual fruit\
    \ detection. In the ﬁrst\ntwo steps, decision trees were generated based on features\
    \ such as color, shape, texture and size and\nimage segmentations were conducted\
    \ using the generated trees. Finally, the automatical detection of\nindividual\
    \ fruit in multiple tomatoes was achieved by X-means clustering method. The results\
    \ of the\ntomato detection image test showed that their method achieved a recall\
    \ of 0.80, while the precision\nwas 0.88 [71]. Rahnemoonfar et al. proposed deep\
    \ learning architecture for counting fruits based\non convolutional neural networks.\
    \ They used synthetic images to train the neural network to save\ntime-consuming\
    \ collect and annotate. The network was trained for three epochs on 24,000 synthetic\n\
    images using an Adam optimizer and 100 randomly chosen images were tested. The\
    \ experimental\nresults demonstrated that their method had higher average accuracy\
    \ as comparing with others [72].\n3.7. Big Data\nThe protected agriculture produces\
    \ billions of dynamic, complex and spatial data including soil\ndatabases, greenhouse\
    \ environment data, livestock vaccination records and government investment\n\
    data. Compared with relational data structures that are logically expressed using\
    \ two-dimensional\ntables, agricultural data is more unstructured and has a large\
    \ number of hypermedia elements\nsuch as expert experience, knowledge and agricultural\
    \ models in the form of text, charts, pictures,\nanimations and voice/video [73].\
    \ The “big” of these data can be reﬂected in four dimensions: volume,\nvelocity,\
    \ variety and veracity [74]. Big Data technology is able to ﬁnd out the internal\
    \ links of collected\ndata through information mining and other means, discover\
    \ new information and provide data support\nfor the next operation. The most commonly\
    \ used techniques to deal with Big Data technology are\nimage processing, modeling\
    \ and simulation, machine learning, statistical analysis and geographical\ninformation\
    \ systems (GIS) [75].\n4. IoT Applications in Protected Agriculture\n4.1. Plant\
    \ Management\nCompared with open-ﬁeld agriculture, protected agriculture provides\
    \ a relatively suitable and\ncontrollable environment for crop growth by greenhouse\
    \ technology, which to some extent is free\nfrom the constraints of the natural\
    \ environment and promoted the intensive and eﬃcient use of\nagricultural resources.\
    \ However, spatial and temporal variability of crops’ growth environmental\nparameters\
    \ in the protected agriculture are strong and aﬀect each other [76,77], which\
    \ made it diﬃcult\nto adapt to the growth of diﬀerent types of plants in diﬀerent\
    \ growth stages by traditional cultivation\nand environmental regulation. Therefore,\
    \ it needs higher accuracy in the aspect of monitoring and\ncontrol. Many works\
    \ have attempted to design and test types of monitoring and control systems to\n\
    adjust greenhouse environmental parameters such as air temperature and humidity,\
    \ light intensity\nand CO2 concentration based on IoT and their results have proven\
    \ it is technically and economically\nfeasible [78]. At the low level of IoT development,\
    \ the environmental data were simply processed and\nusually presented in sheet\
    \ and plot form [79,80]. Later, some studies collected huge amounts of data\n\
    to set up various models based on plant growth or greenhouse climate [81–83],\
    \ which contributed\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n11 of 24\nto predicting the crop\
    \ yield and environment parameter changes to help farmers better manage\ngreenhouse.\
    \ CAI et al. developed a low-cost smart greenhouse remote monitor system based\
    \ on IoT.\nThe system used STM32F103 single chip machine and sensors to collect\
    \ environmental information\nand transferred the data to cloud by LPWAN. Security\
    \ link was established with TLS, which reduced\nsystem costs while ensuring the\
    \ security of data transmission. At the same time, they adopted a time\nseries\
    \ database to store data so that tremendous storage space can be saved [84]. He\
    \ et al. have reported\na greenhouse temperature intelligent control system based\
    \ on NB-IoT. The relative error of greenhouse\nenvironmental information collection\
    \ was below 1%, the average control accuracy was 3.57% (±1.0 ◦C),\nthe transmission\
    \ distance was not limited and the automatic regulation of crop growth temperature\n\
    was realized [85].\nNowaday, with the development of cloud computing, ML, etc.,\
    \ IoT solution can easily achieve\nsmart data processing and analyzing at low\
    \ cost and in a convenient way [86,87]. At the same time,\ngreenhouse technology\
    \ has also undergone several generations of upgrades and has now evolved into\n\
    highly mechanized and automated plant factories. Deng et al. have implemented\
    \ a closed-loop control\nsystem in a salad-cultivating plant factory based on\
    \ the kinetic model. Both digital simulation and\nreal-time results demonstrated\
    \ the system can work stably under the internal variations and external\ndisturbances\
    \ [88]. Zamora-Izquierdo et al. developed a smart farming IoT platform based on\
    \ edge and\ncloud computing, which was designed for soilless culture greenhouses\
    \ at low cost. The platform was\ncomposed of local, edge and cloud parts: the\
    \ local part dealt with data gathering and automatic control\nthough Cyber-Physical\
    \ Systems, the edge part took main management tasks and could improve the\nstability\
    \ of this systems, the cloud part was in charge of data analytics. Compared with\
    \ a regular\nopen control, the platform saved more than 30% water [89]. Katsoulas\
    \ et al. have designed an\nonline irrigation system for hydroponic greenhouse\
    \ crops and their results indicated it increased\nwater and fertilizer use eﬃciency\
    \ by 100% [90]. Liao et al. implemented a IoT-based system in\nan orchid greenhouse\
    \ to monitor the environmental factors and the growth status of phalaenopsis.\n\
    They developed an image processing algorithm to estimate the leaf area of phalaenopsisthe\
    \ and\nidentiﬁed the relationship between growth of plant leaves and environmental\
    \ factors. The proposed\nsystem could provide quantitative information with high\
    \ spatiotemporal resolution for ﬂoral farmers\nand contribute to updating farming\
    \ strategies for phalaenopsis in the future [91].\nDiseases and insect pests bring\
    \ a great threat to the growth of crops as and traditional technology\nand chemical\
    \ prevention and control has a certain lag and negative impact [92,93]. The rise\
    \ of IoT\nhas brought more eﬃcient and smarter solutions to crop disease and pest\
    \ control. Many types of\nIoT sensors can collect information about location,\
    \ greenhouse environment status, crop growth and\npest situation anywhere in real-time,\
    \ which helps farmers keep track of crop pests and diseases.\nThen, all raw image\
    \ and data are sent to cloud centers and later processed and analyzed by various\n\
    models and algorithms based on diﬀerent diseases and pests [94,95]. Finally, these\
    \ cloud centers\ngenerally provide farmers with the following services: disease\
    \ or pest identiﬁcation, disaster prediction\nand warning and recommended governance\
    \ measures from expert systems. Tirelli et al. proposed\na pest insect trap automatic\
    \ monitoring system using ZigBee technology, which can estimate the\ninsect density\
    \ by collected data from diﬀerent sites and send a warning message to farmers\
    \ when it\nexceeded the set value [96]. Ahouandjinou et al. proposed a pest monitoring\
    \ system which detected\nthe presence of pests by the acquisition of ultrasound\
    \ and assisted others in building up protocols\nfor early exterminate of the pests\
    \ [97]. Foughali et al. presented a potato late blight prevention and\ndecision\
    \ support system using cloud IoT and helped the agriculturists take eﬀective action\
    \ to treat\nthis disease [98]. Both Semios and Spensa Company launched their own\
    \ integrated pest management\nsystem, which was able to count the number of pests\
    \ by images, as well as characterize and capture\nthe insects. At present, pest\
    \ and disease warning research mainly provides medium and long-term\nwarning based\
    \ on historical data, which can provide macro guidance for crop production but\
    \ low\ntimeliness. Therefore, future research should focus on online monitoring\
    \ as well as diagnosis and early\nwarning of agricultural diseases.\nSensors 2019,\
    \ 19, 1833\n12 of 24\n4.2. Animal Farming\nLivestock and aquatic product farming\
    \ is an important part of protected agriculture and an area\nwhere IoT applications\
    \ have achieved good results. To achieve good control eﬀects in animal breeding,\n\
    IoT should not only overcome harsh environmental factors, but also pay attention\
    \ to the eﬀects of animal\nbehaviors [99,100]. IoT have been applied in monitoring\
    \ and management of environment, animal,\nfeed and farming process [101,102].\
    \ The livestock monitoring items include information such as body\ntemperature,\
    \ weight, behavior, exercise volume, food intake, disease information and environmental\n\
    factors, which can help people understand animal’s own physiological and nutritional\
    \ status and\nadaptability to external environmental conditions. In aquaculture,\
    \ management projects focus on water\nquality such as dissolved oxygen content,\
    \ water temperature and pH value [103,104] because water\nquality greatly aﬀects\
    \ the growth of aquatic animals. With animal growth and nutrient optimization\n\
    model and intelligent IoT equipment, it is possible to realiaze automatic feeding\
    \ and optimal control of\nfeeding time and intake according to their growth cycle,\
    \ individual quality, feeding cycle and eating\nsituation [105,106]. The Osborne\
    \ Industrial Company has produced TEAM automated electronic sow\nfeeding (ESF)\
    \ stations including pregnancy stations and estrus detection stations. The ESF\
    \ stations\nidentify the sow through the RFID tags worn by each sow and deliver\
    \ the corresponding quantity\nand type of feed based on information such as parity,\
    \ lyrical condition and gestational age. The estrus\ndetection stations can detect\
    \ rutting sows in the sow population and their detection accuracy is 7%\nhigher\
    \ than the manual ones. Encinas et al. presented a distributed monitoring IoT\
    \ system for\nwater quality monitoring. Their model was able to help ﬁsheries\
    \ acquire water quality parameters\nsuch as pH and temperature data in real time\
    \ to optimize pond resources and prevent unwanted\nconditions [107]. Soto-Zarazu´a\
    \ et al. proposed an automated recirculation tilapia farming system\nbased on\
    \ the fuzzy algorithm. The results of this work showed that it saved water by\
    \ 97.42% and\nthe water quality environmental parameters were controlled within\
    \ the acceptable range of tilapia\nculture [108]. Many researches have focused\
    \ on analysis of animal behavior, health care and diagnosis\nand warning of diseases\
    \ based on IoT [109–111]. Yazdanbakhsh et al. proposed an intelligent livestock\n\
    surveillance system. They attempted many machine learning algorithms to process\
    \ raw data of\nhealthy and ill cows and ﬁnally obtained good results used a wavelet-domain\
    \ ensemble classiﬁer with\n80.8% sensitivity and 80% speciﬁcity [112]. Wens Group,\
    \ the largest livestock breeding enterprise\nin China, took the lead in carrying\
    \ out research on the animal husbandry based on IoT and built\nthe corresponding\
    \ system for monitoring livestock vital signs, behavior and breeding environment\n\
    information [113]. Liu et al. collected a variety of penaeus vannamei information\
    \ such as real-time data\non the culture environment, disease image data and expert\
    \ disease diagnosis and treatment and ﬁnally,\nconstructed a remote intelligent\
    \ diagnosis model based on IoT [114]. Liu et al. proposed a web-based\ncombined\
    \ nutritional model for precisely predicting the growth, feed amount and nitrogen\
    \ phosphorus\noutput of gibel carp [115]. The current online diagnostics and early\
    \ warning of animal diseases is at an\nearly stage due to the lack of corresponding\
    \ sensors and models. With upgrading of hardware and\nartiﬁcial intelligence algorithms,\
    \ future research should focus on the improvement of Big Data depth\nalgorithm\
    \ and the establishment of comprehensive models of animal behavior and disease.\n\
    A few studies have made in-depth research in monitoring animal odor and hazardous\
    \ gas\nproduced during the breeding process such as ammonia gas and sulfur dioxide\
    \ [116]. Pan developed\nan electronic nose network system for monitoring and real-time\
    \ analysis of odors from livestock\nfarms. They placed e-noses in and around the\
    \ farm to build up a wireless network to measure odor\ncompounds as well as environmental\
    \ parameters [117].\n4.3. Agri-food Supply Chain Traceability\nNowday, agricultural\
    \ products/food safety issues are receiving worldwide attention and their\nsafety\
    \ traceability is one solution accepted by all parties of Agri-food domains. Governments\
    \ in many\ncountries and regions have promulgated laws and regulations to promote\
    \ the establishment of food\ntraceability system and strengthen the supervision\
    \ of agricultural products/food safety. The Agri-food\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n\

    \ quality at each link of the\nproduction, from the cropland to the consumer (Figure\
    \ 6), which could help consumers establish\nconﬁdence in food safety and contribute\
    \ to sustainable development of the whole food industry [118].\n \n4.3. Agri-food\

    \ confidence in food safety and contribute to sustainable development of the whole\
    \ food \nindustry [118].  \n \nFigure 6. Schematic representation of the Agri-food\
    \ supply chain from the grower to consumer. \nIn past years, a lot of countries\
    \ have established the traceability platform for meat,milk, fish and \nagri-food\
    \ products based on IoT [119–121]. However, the fresh food cold chain logistics\
    \ traceability \nhas also drawn widespread attention [122,123]. RFID technology\
    \ still played an important role in \nAgri-food supply chain traceability due\
    \ to its small size and low cost [124]. As a novel technology, \nnear field communication\
    \ (NFC) has been progressively developed and used because of its safe and \nsimple\
    \ operation [125,126]. A common problem in the development of IoT is its asynchronous\
    \ \nheterogeneous data flow and distributed features. This requires the traceability\
    \ system to establish \nuniform and accurate identification naming rules to facilitate\
    \ quick and unique retrieval of \ninformation on a farm product [127]. As the\
    \ deployment of IoT infrastructure is completed, the \nsupply chain will move\
    \ towards virtualization which is no longer required physical contact. The \n\
    virtualization of an agri-food supply chain helps administrators better monitor,\
    \ control, plan and \noptimize food supply chain processes [128]. Wang et al.\

    \ and IoT. It included four modules: information source, warning \nFigure 6. Schematic\

    \ Wang et al. proposed a food safety pre-warning system based on association\n\
    rules mining and IoT. It included four modules: information source, warning analysis,\
    \ reaction and\nemergency feedback. First, they accessed food critical information\
    \ through data processing and\nanalysis of food traceability data for safety assessment.\
    \ On this basis of this data, the system used the\nassociated data mining method\
    \ to discover the connection between them and then obtained the food\nsafety risk\
    \ analysis results. Subsequently, the system made a corresponding early warning\
    \ response\nbased on this result [129].\nRecently, the increasing incidents of\
    \ food falsiﬁcation have not only brought about great economic\nlosses, but also\
    \ undermined consumers’ conﬁdence in food safety. The blockchain technology with\n\
    decentralization, non-tamperability, development transparency and machine autonomy\
    \ features\nbrings new solutions to the above problems [130,131]. Tian et al.\
    \ reported a new decentralized\ntraceability system based on IoT and blockchain\
    \ technology, which can provid an open, transparent,\nneutral, safe and reliable\
    \ information platform for producers, governments, consumers and other\nstakeholders\
    \ [132]. Kaijun et al. combined the supply chain and blockchain technology to\
    \ propose\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n14 of 24\na double chain architecture agricultural\
    \ traceability system by studying the dual chain structure and\nits storage mode,\
    \ resource rent-seeking and matching mechanism and consensus algorithm [133].\n\
    Now, with the innovation and maturity of related technologies, it is not diﬃcult\
    \ for researchers to\ndevelop a complete set of traceability systems. The rise\
    \ of artiﬁcial intelligence technology enables\nexisting traceability systems\
    \ to provide automation, intelligence and human services to businesses\nand consumers.\
    \ Chen et al. adopted fuzzy cognitive maps and fuzzy rule method to come up with\n\
    an autonomous tracing system for backward design in food supply chain based on\
    \ IoT, which better\ntraced food product problems [134]. However, there are still\
    \ some problems in food safety traceability.\nIt is worth noting that the current\
    \ agricultural product safety traceability system only focuses on\na certain level\
    \ of supply chain or a certain type of goods. With the participation of multiple\
    \ projects\nor multiple sessions, we believe that the focus of future research\
    \ should be on more complex and\nsystematic supply chains.\n5. Disscussion\n5.1.\
    \ Hardware and Software Challenges\nWhen IoT technology is applying in protected\
    \ agriculture, it is inevitable to encounter challenges\nfrom all aspects. In\
    \ the perception layer, various devices must face the harsh and complex greenhouse\n\
    environment. Strong solar radiation, high temperatures, high humidity, strong\
    \ vibrations and other\nhazards can easily damage or destroy sensors or end devices.\
    \ Moreover, the daily activities of livestock\ncan interfere with the work of\
    \ the sensor or execution nodes, resulting in poor detection and control.\nIn\
    \ a general way, the information collection nodes rely on the battery with limited\
    \ power to maintain\nits work because the behavior of frequent battery replacement\
    \ consume a lot of energies and money.\nTherefore, it is an urgent need to make\
    \ great progress in developing low-power acquisition equipment,\nenergy-saving\
    \ sink node routing protocols and energy-balanced communication algorithms [135].\n\
    The devices places in various places generate incalculable data and the storage\
    \ of such data\nis also a huge challenge for some small servers.\nThose agricultural\
    \ IoT data have real-time,\ndynamic, granular and fragmented characteristics,\
    \ which brings great challenges to intermediate\ndesign, data large-scale screening,\
    \ screening, mining, processing and decision analysis techniques.\nMoreover, existing\
    \ databases cannot store unstructured data such as audio, video and images. As\
    \ a result,\nquite a lot real-time sensing data are not fully exploited. Besides,\
    \ some models and algorithms are not\nenough to to reﬂect objective reality, so\
    \ that they cannot eﬀectively guide agricultural production.\n5.2. Network Challenge\n\
    In protected agriculture, the sensor and device need to continuously operate under\
    \ the harsh\nand varied environment and their arrangement is sparse and irregular.\
    \ Compared with the wired\nnetwork with high wiring costs, the wireless network\
    \ has the advantages of low cost, good networking\nﬂexibility and high scalability\
    \ and therefore becomes the main application mode of the current\nmonitoring system.\
    \ Many actual deployments have displayed that common wireless communication\n\
    technologies are aﬀected by temperature, humidity andbuildings or other spatial\
    \ barriers [136–138].\nThe growth of animals and plants changes also result in\
    \ background noise [139] because of the\nmulti-path propagation eﬀects, which\
    \ lows reliability of data transmission. It is easy to isolate a node in\nthe\
    \ original communication network due to low node deployment density and the above\
    \ obstacles in\nprotected agriculture. If this node is responsible for communication\
    \ routing tasks of many devices and\nthis node is damaged and isolated from the\
    \ network, this will cause partial or even paralysis of most of\nthe network.\
    \ Most relevant theories and research needes on the eﬀects of the crop growth,\
    \ the thickness\nand material of wall, and the radio signal transmission loss\
    \ and electromagnetic wave transmission\nbetween soil and air interface, etc.\
    \ To determine the optimal position, height and network topology\nof sensor nodes\
    \ under diﬀerent environmental conditions. On the other hand, ad hoc intelligent\n\
    wireless network technology is needed to reduce or avoid paralysis of large-area\
    \ networks. The rise of\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n15 of 24\nLPWAN may solve e above\
    \ paralysis problems of WLAN due to its long communication distance,\nwhich obviates\
    \ the need for the dense and expensive deployments of relays and gateways altogether.\n\
    However, the cost of erecting LPWAN base stations is high.\nThe process of recording\
    \ various agricultural products’ status from the ﬁeld to the table\ngenerates\
    \ a large amount of data, which brings great challenges to wireless communication\
    \ with\na low transmission rate. At same times, it also brought network nodes\
    \ many problems in energy\ndistribution, data calculation, storage and communication.\
    \ Therefore, there is an urgent need to\ndevelop high-capacity data and real-time\
    \ broadband communication standards for technologies in\ncomplex agricultural\
    \ application environments.\n5.3. Security Challenge\nThe problems of security\
    \ and privacy are thought as crucial challenges in applications of protected\n\
    agriculture due to real-world examples of losses due to vulnerabilities, network\
    \ attacks or privacy issues.\nAs a multi-network heterogeneous converged network,\
    \ it not only has the same security problems as\nsensor networks, mobile communication\
    \ networks and the Interne, but also has its particular issues\nsuch as privacy\
    \ protection issues, authentication and access control issues for heterogeneous\
    \ networks,\nstorage and management of information issues, etc.\nIn the perception\
    \ layer, security threats are mainly against the WSN and RFID. In agricultural\n\
    applications, many of the sensor nodes are deployed in the long-term unsupervised\
    \ farmland\nenvironment and the wireless network itself is open, so the wireless\
    \ transmission is vulnerable to\nexternal interference and illegal users. Coupled\
    \ with the fact that these devices are respectively\nplaced elsewhere, a single\
    \ security measure is not enough [140]. The main threats to WSN include\neavesdropping\
    \ attack, node capture, replay attack and information wiretapping. So multiple\
    \ security\nmechanisms such as anonymity mechanism, data encryption and identity\
    \ authentication mechanisms\nare necessary [141,142].\nThe security threat of\
    \ RFID refers mainly to the attacks that are encountered when the RFID\nreader\
    \ and the tag communicate and such attacks usually lead to user privacy. In addition,\
    \ because the\nRFID tag is rewritable, the security and validity of the RFID tag\
    \ data will not be guaranteed.\nThere are lots of ways to enhance RFID tag security\
    \ such as modifying tag frequency, enciphered data.\nSensor nodes are diﬀerent\
    \ from RFID tag because they are active and relate to the dynamic properties of\n\
    things. Therefore, when applying encryption algorithms, key distribution policies,\
    \ intrusion detection\nmechanisms and security routing policies in speciﬁc devices,\
    \ we need to consider the limitations of\ntheir own hardware.\nSince networks\
    \ of diﬀerent architectures need to be connected to each other, there are even\n\
    greater challenges in terms of security authentication across network architectures.\
    \ The transport\nlayer will encounter the following security challenges: proxy\
    \ attacks, DoS (Denial-of-Service) attacks,\nmalicious code injection, man-in-the-middle\
    \ attacks, attacks across heterogeneous networks, etc.\nThe common measures dealt\
    \ with these network layer threats and attacks are: authorization,\nauthentication,\
    \ encryption, anti-virus protection, etc. IoT terminal devices in protected agriculture\n\
    have the characteristics of weak computing power and small storage space. Due\
    \ to limited resources,\nIoT encryption technology must be an easy to implement,\
    \ lightweight security technology that is\nsuitable for use in sensitive information\
    \ environments [143,144].\nWhen massive agricultural data is transmitted to the\
    \ application layer, in addition to the intelligent\nprocessing of data, data\
    \ security and privacy should also be considered. At this level, a large amount\n\
    of private data about users is collected, such as the consumption of agricultural\
    \ materials, the purchase\ninformation of fruits and vegetables and the location\
    \ of agricultural machinery. Therefore, the database\naccess control strategy\
    \ should be strengthened on the basis of intelligent data processing. When diﬀerent\n\
    users access the same data, they should limit their permissions and operations\
    \ according to their security\nlevel or identity, eﬀectively ensuring data security\
    \ and privacy. On the other hand, application layer\nservice providers should\
    \ accelerate the development and upgrade of authentication mechanisms\nSensors\
    \ 2019, 19, 1833\n16 of 24\nand encryption mechanisms for application scenarios\
    \ such as agricultural production, processing,\ntransportation and consumption.\n\
    5.4. Other Challenges\nThere are other challenges that need to be addressed, which\
    \ are related to the further application of\nIoT technology in protected agriculture.\
    \ Thousands of devices which have huge diﬀerences in processor,\nmemory, communication\
    \ protocol and programming language are deployed in protected agriculture,\nwhich\
    \ inevitably results in heterogeneity issues. Besides, most of devices in protected\
    \ agriculture are\nconnected to the cloud or others by the non-standard heterogeneous\
    \ interfaces [14,22]. This has led\nto problems of both device heterogeneity and\
    \ data heterogeneity. The device heterogeneity problem\naﬀects the scalability\
    \ of IoT in protected agriculture and the data heterogeneity problem hinders the\n\
    use of fusion information by models [145]. Although many research institutes,\
    \ hardware and software\nmanufacturers and related organizations have made a lot\
    \ of contributions to the standardization and\ndeployment of IoT in agriculture,\
    \ it still needs to establish a complete and clear structure, protocols and\n\
    standards to connect various heterogeneous devices and services [146,147].\nThe\
    \ cost has always been a barrier to the large-scale application of IoT to ordinary\
    \ farmers,\nespecially in developing countries like China and India. Despite a\
    \ large number of embedded devices\nand platforms have emerged and the cost of\
    \ hardware and software is rapidly decreasing, but here is\nanother situation\
    \ in high-quality and high-precision sensors and devices. Moreover, some funds\
    \ are\nneeded to train farmers to become proﬁcient in the use of IoT equipment.\
    \ In order to be able toplay\na better role in the future, the cost of sensing,\
    \ transmission, analysis and application components and\nequipment on the IoT\
    \ need to further reduce in order to lower the price and make it more aﬀordable\n\
    in the next decade [148]. Government departments should recognize the signiﬁcant\
    \ potential for the\ndevelopment of IoT in protected agriculture and increase\
    \ investment and support through policies and\nfunds to attract more capital and\
    \ achieve rapid development and application.\nIn addition, the usability of the\
    \ terminal device needs to be further improved, for example, the user\ninterface\
    \ needs to be friendlier andthe device needs to be more convenient in size and\
    \ easy to carry.\nIoT brings many beneﬁts to ecological environment and brings\
    \ some problems.. More and\nmore equipment is being placed in agriculture andso\
    \ the issues of environmental friendliness should\nreceive some attention in the\
    \ future. As the e-waste generated by IoT devices and the consumption of\nenergy\
    \ are gradually increasing, the sustainable development of the ecological environment\
    \ is also one\ncommon concern. Examples of interesting research topics include\
    \ the use of degradable materials and\nrenewable energy sources, the reduction\
    \ of equipment size and the use of energy-saving algorithms\nand new green ICT\
    \ technology [149,150].\nThe application of the Internet of Things in facility\
    \ agriculture needs to consider the socio-economic\nconsequences. On the one hand,\
    \ it increases the level of intelligence in agricultural monitoring,\ncontrol\
    \ and decision-making, thereby increasing the eﬃciency and quality of agricultural\
    \ production.\nAt the same time, it will also change the demand for the existing\
    \ agricultural workforce, causing some\npeople who are engaged in simple repetitive\
    \ tasks to lose their jobs, which will cause a series of\nsocial problems.\n5.5.\
    \ Future Prospects\nIoT technology is being applied to many ﬁelds of society,\
    \ economy and life at an unprecedented\nspeed, making human society step into\
    \ a new era of high intelligence. IoT technology is evolving\nand mature, and\
    \ many novel deployments and applications are constantly being built in protected\n\
    agriculture. Based on the above analysis and discussion of the key technologies\
    \ and applications of IoT\nin the protection of agriculture, we will present its\
    \ future development prospects and key research and\ndevelopment directions in\
    \ the following aspects. In the perception layer, the development of sensors\n\
    should focus on new sensitive materials, mechanisms, processes and methodologies\
    \ as well as low\npower consumption and low cost. Besides, we must accelerate\
    \ the development of sensors and rapid\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n17 of 24\ndetection\
    \ devices soil, animal and plant life. At the network layer, we should focus on\
    \ high-capacity data\nreal-time broadband communication standards and technologies\
    \ for complex agricultural application\nenvironments, high-reliability, adaptive,\
    \ low-power network deployment and management strategies\nand algorithms. With\
    \ wide coverage, high capacity, low power consumption and low cost, LPWAN is\n\
    ideal for some agricultural scenarios where text-based, video and voice service\
    \ support is not required\nand coverage, power consumption and cost are critical.\
    \ Future research and deployment should\nfocus on IoT solutions based on LPWAN.\
    \ In the application layer, governments and organizations\nshould develop uniﬁed\
    \ standards for the sensors and identiﬁcation interface devices, data transmission\n\
    communication protocols, multi-source data fusion analysis processing and application\
    \ services in\nprotected agriculture through international cooperation or negotiation.\
    \ Software developers should\ndevelop large open source databases and signal processing\
    \ algorithm libraries for diﬀerent areas\nof facility agriculture. For universities\
    \ and research institutes, cloud-based agricultural intelligent\ndecision-making\
    \ models, multi-source data-based information fusion algorithms, agricultural\
    \ Big Data\nmining technologies, distributed intelligent processing systems and\
    \ lightweight IoT authentication,\nencryption and authorization mechanisms will\
    \ be the key research directions for the future. With an\nincreased presence of\
    \ IoT technology in protected agriculture, its potential for the reﬁned management\n\
    of crop, livestock and aquatic animals will be recognized. Besides, as a technical\
    \ means to monitor\nthe production, processing, circulation and consumption of\
    \ agricultural products, IoTwill play an\nincreasingly important role in food\
    \ safety.\n6. Conclusions\nIn this survey, we present a comprehensive review of\
    \ the state-of-the-art in IoT deployment\nfor protected agriculture applications.\
    \ First, a simple review of previous IoT structure was given.\nSecondly, the basic\
    \ IoT architectures in protected agriculture were introduced. Next, discussions\
    \ of\nsensor, data communication, cloud computing, edge computing, ML and other\
    \ vital IoT technologies\nin protected agriculture are elaborated.\nThen, we highlight\
    \ various IoT applications and their\npotential to solve various farming problems\
    \ in protected agriculture. By classifying the research and\ndeployment literature\
    \ on IoT in protected agriculture, three important application ﬁelds were given:\n\
    plant management, animal farming and agri-food supply chain traceability. Finally,\
    \ a detailed analyses\nof IoT research challenges and future prospects were outlined.\n\
    The survey of the existing works directs us concluding remarks. The future prospects\
    \ of IoT in\nprotected agriculture are expectant, but the challenges mentioned\
    \ above must handle. In order to\ncope with its complex and changing agricultural\
    \ environment, the hardware devices must be fully\nupgraded to further enhance\
    \ their universality, reliability, expansibility, endurance and intelligence\n\
    level, while reducing costs and operative diﬃculty. Secondly, the local network\
    \ must be protected from\ninterference from other networks. In addition, the interoperability,\
    \ ﬁltering and semantic annotation of\ndata generated by the various devices of\
    \ IoT must be realized to a certain extent. Only in this way\ncan we optimize\
    \ the Big Data decision support model by using a large amount of heterogeneous\
    \ data.\nSecurity, anonymity and control over the access rights on the information\
    \ is vital for such a system to\nbe adopted. Finally, the impact of IoT on the\
    \ agroecological environment and social economy should\nbe considered in the application\
    \ of protected agriculture, to realize the sustainable development of\nagricultural\
    \ environment as quick as possible.\nAuthor Contributions: The collection, classiﬁcation\

    Abstract: The 21st century has seen rapid changes in technology, industry, and\
    \ social patterns. Most\nindustries have moved towards automation, and human intervention\
    \ has decreased, which has led\nto a revolution in industries, named the fourth\
    \ industrial revolution (Industry 4.0). Industry 4.0 or\nthe fourth industrial\
    \ revolution (IR 4.0) relies heavily on the Internet of Things (IoT) and wireless\n\
    sensor networks (WSN). IoT and WSN are used in various control systems, including\
    \ environmental\nmonitoring, home automation, and chemical/biological attack detection.\
    \ IoT devices and applications\nare used to process extracted data from WSN devices\
    \ and transmit them to remote locations. This\nsystematic literature review offers\
    \ a wide range of information on Industry 4.0, ﬁnds research gaps,\nand recommends\
    \ future directions. Seven research questions are addressed in this article: (i)\
    \ What\nare the contributions of WSN in IR 4.0? (ii) What are the contributions\
    \ of IoT in IR 4.0? (iii) What\nare the types of WSN coverage areas for IR 4.0?\
    \ (iv) What are the major types of network intruders\nin WSN and IoT systems?\
    \ (v) What are the prominent network security attacks in WSN and IoT?\n(vi) What\
    \ are the signiﬁcant issues in IoT and WSN frameworks? and (vii) What are the\
    \ limitations\nand research gaps in the existing work? This study mainly focuses\
    \ on research solutions and new\ntechniques to automate Industry 4.0. In this\
    \ research, we analyzed over 130 articles from 2014\nuntil 2021. This paper covers\
    \ several aspects of Industry 4.0, from the designing phase to security\nneeds,\
    \ from the deployment stage to the classiﬁcation of the network, the difﬁculties,\
    \ challenges, and\nfuture directions.\nKeywords: Internet of Things (IoT); industrial\
    \ revolution 4.0 (IR 4.0); computer networks; network\nsecurity; wireless sensor\
    \ networks (WSN); systematic literature review (SLR); state-of-the-art\n1. Introduction\n\
    Smart technologies play a crucial role in sustainable economic growth. They transform\n\
    houses, ofﬁces, factories, and even cities into autonomic, self-controlled systems\
    \ without\nhuman intervention [1]. This modern automation trend and ever-increasing\
    \ use of cutting-\nedge technologies are boosting the world’s economy [2]. The\
    \ Internet of Things (IoT)\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22062087\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n2 of 36\nand Wireless\
    \ Sensor Networks (WSN) both play vital roles in this modernization [3]. IoT\n\
    is a branch of engineering primarily concerned with offering thousands of miniature,\n\
    physical connected objects, which may collaborate to achieve a shared goal. IoT\
    \ has gained\nmuch importance due to the abundant usage of these tiny networked\
    \ devices. These\nare smart, yet basic things that can sense and communicate wirelessly\
    \ [4]. WSN is a\ncollection of sensor and routing nodes, as shown in Figure 1,\
    \ which may be put together\nin the environment to predict physical conditions,\
    \ such as wind, temperature, and many\nothers. These networks collect and process\
    \ data from tiny nodes and then transfer it to\nthe operators. Figure 2 illustrates\
    \ that sensor networks are used in a variety of control\nsystems, including environmental\
    \ monitoring, home automation, chemical and biological\nassault detection, smart\
    \ grid deployment [5], surveillance, and many more. WSN also plays\na signiﬁcant\
    \ role in aquaculture and the oil industry, including data collection, offshore\n\
    exploration, disaster prevention, tactical surveillance, and pollution monitoring\
    \ [6–8].\nFigure 1. Architecture of wireless sensor network (WSN).\nFigure 2.\
    \ Application of wireless sensor network (WSN).\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n3 of\
    \ 36\nWSN are often deployed in remote areas where human intervention is not possible\n\
    for post-deployment maintenance. Therefore, efforts are being made to enhance\
    \ their\nefﬁciency and durability [9]. There are many barriers to WSN deployment,\
    \ such as power\nconsumption–long-distance deployment. Due to automation trends\
    \ and applications devel-\noped, these barriers are no longer barriers for large-scale\
    \ remote deployment. In general,\nWSN follows a star topology to decrease the\
    \ network failure probability by connecting all\nsystems to a central node. While\
    \ ad-hoc networks follow mesh topology where each node\nis human-driven [10].\n\
    In physical production systems, grid and energy-saving applications minimize the\n\
    energy resources and noise pollution. In the last few decades, transportation\
    \ has improved\na lot with the usage of smart IoT devices, such as signals and\
    \ high-resolution cameras\non roads, which has led to an increase in trafﬁc ﬂow.\
    \ RFID readers are deployed at toll\nbooths that automatically deduct toll amounts\
    \ after reading RFID tags on vehicles. In the\ntransportation sector, smart vehicles\
    \ reduce the travelling time and also fuel consumption\nwith low cost of mobility\
    \ and reduced human efforts [11], atmospheric monitoring reduces\npollution, and\
    \ surveillance applications reduce crime. Nowadays, WSN also plays a role in\n\
    precision agriculture. On the other hand, WSN applications facilitate our day\
    \ to day lives,\nmaking them more comfortable, such as healthcare applications\
    \ that improve our health\nand longevity.\nBesides WSN, IoT has also played an\
    \ important role in human life. IoT and the digital\nage play essential roles\
    \ in overcoming social and physical barriers and providing ease\nand mobility\
    \ to people, resulting in improved and equal opportunities, and access to\ninformation\
    \ [12,13]. IoT also has many application areas such as agribusiness, climate,\n\
    clinical care, education, transportation, and ﬁnance, as shown in Figure 2.\n\
    In regard to information and communication technology, researchers are attracted\
    \ to\nIoT [14]. By adopting this essential technology, companies have become smarter,\
    \ more\ncompetitive, automated, and sustainable in the global supply chain. In\
    \ today’s competitive\nmarketplace, supply chains are struggling as they compete\
    \ with each other. Therefore,\nIoT devices are an effective way to authenticate,\
    \ monitor, and track products using GPS\nand many technologies [15,16]. Industry\
    \ 4.0 stands for the fourth industrial revolution\nin the digital age, it is associated\
    \ with virtualizing real-world scenarios of production\nand processing without\
    \ human intervention. This virtual world is linked to IoT devices,\nallowing the\
    \ creation of cyber–physical systems to communicate and cooperate [17,18].\nThis\
    \ fully connected manufacturing system—operating without human intervention by\n\
    generating, transferring, receiving, and processing necessary data to conduct\
    \ all required\ntasks for producing all kinds of goods—is one of Industry 4.0’s\
    \ key “constructs”. The con-\ncept of Industry 4.0 is based on the combination\
    \ of three main elements: people, things,\nand business [19]. A complete cyber–physical\
    \ production system created by the integration\nof IoT devices, things and objects\
    \ (IoT), sensor nodes (WSN), and people, is shown in\nFigure 3. CPS is a typical\
    \ example of Industry 4.0. IoT is the connection of smart devices,\nobjects, or\
    \ machines to the internet and with each other. In WSN systems, there is no direct\n\
    connection of these devices to the Internet. These systems can send their data\
    \ to the Internet\nby connecting several sensor nodes to a central routing node.\
    \ While CPS systems involve\nthe integration of IoT devices, computation, networking,\
    \ and physical process, IoT is an\nessential component of CPS. CPS systems are\
    \ key elements in the implementation of IR\n4.0 [20]. Industry 4.0 is the network-enabled\
    \ entity that automates the whole process of\nmanufacturing, connecting business\
    \ and processes. Market demands and the advance-\nments in new technologies are\
    \ transforming manufacturing ﬁrms’ business operations\ninto smart factories and\
    \ warehouses. Due to this automation, IoT devices are producing a\nmassive amount\
    \ of data daily, known as big data [21,22]. Statistics show that, at the end of\n\
    2021, there were more than 10 billion active IoT devices globally [23]. By 2030,\
    \ the number\nof active IoT devices is expected to exceed 10 billion to 25.4 billion.\
    \ By 2025, the data created\nby IoT devices will reach 73.1 ZB (zeta bytes) [24].\
    \ In 2020, the IoT industry was predicted\nto generate more than USD 450 billion,\
    \ including hardware, software, systems integration,\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n\
    4 of 36\nand data services. By the end of 2021, it reached USD 520 billion. The\
    \ global amount\nexpected to be spent on the IoT in 2022 is USD 1 trillion. The\
    \ IoT industry is predicted to\ngrow to more than USD 2 trillion by 2027 [25,26].\
    \ The increasing number of devices and the\nusage by humans shows the importance\
    \ of IoT devices; moreover, the industry is growing\nand gaining revenue.\nFigure\
    \ 3. CPS system–integration of IoT, wireless devices, and people in Industry 4.0.\n\
    In this paper, we conduct a detailed systematic literature review on the applications\n\
    and contributions of IoT and WSN in Industry 4.0. We had a large corpus of data\
    \ to\nanalyze papers using systematic approaches. Among the selected articles,\
    \ we obtained\n22 articles describing the detailed review of existing security\
    \ techniques, applications used,\nadvantages/disadvantages, and limitations of\
    \ IoT and WSN. Most of them reviewed the\narticles in terms of application of\
    \ IoT and attacks only. The paper mainly focuses on research\nchallenges, issues,\
    \ limitations, and the future direction of IoT and WSN frameworks in\nIndustry\
    \ 4.0.\n1.1. Motivation\nThe primary motivation for performing SLR is the ever-increasing\
    \ trend of automation\nin Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 is made up of both WSN technology\
    \ and IoT to digitize work.\nOver time, we see how digitization and technology\
    \ are replacing people in the workplace,\nand dramatically changing the global\
    \ workforce. Technology has brought ease to human\nlife and the efﬁciency of things\
    \ by making them eco-friendly, more agile, and productive.\nFrom smart cities\
    \ to smart industries, a drastic change has happened due to the intelligent\n\
    usage of IoT and WSN and IR 4.0. For example, a smart factory integrates virtual\
    \ and\nphysical systems and calibrating instruments to record their readings immediately.\
    \ In short,\nthe integration of IoT and WSN with Industry 4.0 has reduced labour\
    \ needs, freed humans\nfrom low-level skilled work, and improved the quantity\
    \ and quality of work. Therefore, To\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n5 of 36\nachieve\
    \ better analysis results, we systematically analyzed almost all research data\
    \ related\nto IoT and WSN domains in Industry 4.0.\n1.2. Contribution\nFrom smart\
    \ factories to individual lives, IoT and WSN play signiﬁcant roles. There are\n\
    many advantages, but security problems have arisen as these devices generate considerable\n\
    amounts of data daily. These papers amalgamated both sides: IoT and WSN contributions\n\
    and their security risks. This paper focuses more on the contributions of IoT\
    \ and WSN in\nIndustry 4.0 and presents an in-depth review and analysis of IoT\
    \ and WSN. The paper’s\nmain contribution involves formulating research questions\
    \ from ﬁltered data and building\na strong work foundation using SLR methods.\
    \ We discuss various applications and security\nattacks in IR 4.0. Furthermore,\
    \ new ﬁndings of the paper pertain to the key challenges and\nopen issues of WSN\
    \ integrated with IoT in Industry 4.0, to optimize different criteria.\n1.3. Paper\

    \ the state-of-the-art research studies on IoT and WSN.\nWith the fourth industrial\
    \ revolution, it is observed that communication, computation,\nand storage costs\
    \ have remarkably decreased, which make integration of IoT and WSN\npossible and\
    \ cost-effective globally. We studied many review articles and original research.\n\
    Existing review articles lack, in many aspects, research challenges, issues, limitations,\n\
    and future directions of IoT and WSN, but the systematic literature review (SLR)\
    \ given\nin this work is precise enough to deal with the aspects of IoT and WSN\
    \ area. Related\nwork of review papers is provided next. Moreover, Table 2 is\

    Key challenges and open\nissues of both IoT and\nWSN\nin\nIndustry\n4.0\nare discussed\n\
    ✓\nThe authors in [1] discussed the very novel technology “WiFi”. They discussed\n\
    how this technology helps IoT devices–used in various applications, such as smart\
    \ cities,\nhealthcare systems, and smart houses—communicate effectively. Landaluce\
    \ et al. [4]\ndiscussed RFID and WSN technology in detail. They discussed how\
    \ RFIDs are used to\ntrace devices while WSN gathers information about them from\
    \ interconnected devices. The\nauthors also discussed the obstacles and challenges,\
    \ such as energy consumption, fault-\ntolerant, communication interference, and\
    \ cost feasibility, along with detailed surveys. They\nprovided the advantages\
    \ and limitations of wearable sensor devices. Energy consumption\nis increasing\
    \ each day. Therefore, Dailipi [4] explored how IoT evolution has managed the\n\
    electricity consumption process and provided many beneﬁts to grid stations, consumers,\n\
    and suppliers. They also discussed the security issues and challenges after introducing\
    \ IoT\ndevices in smart grids.\nIn [6], the authors discussed how WSN advancement\
    \ had played a signiﬁcant role in\nUASN. They traced the location of sensor nodes\
    \ deployed underwater in the ocean using\nlocalization algorithms. They reviewed\
    \ many applications of UASN, their advantages\nand their disadvantages. They also\
    \ discussed the challenges they faced during deployment\nand presented future\
    \ directions in the acoustic area. In [10], researchers discussed the\nSensors\
    \ 2022, 22, 2087\n8 of 36\napplications and advantages of WSN being deployed everywhere\
    \ due to their ﬂexible and\ndynamic nature. They discussed each application of\
    \ WSN in urban areas and their solutions.\nThey analyzed how WSN deployment in\
    \ urban areas demanded much more care and\nattention due to harsh weather and\
    \ perverse channel conditions.\nWSN is applicable in many domains, such as industrial\
    \ automation, and the require-\nment elicitation of the industrial process is\
    \ different from general WSN requirement gather-\nings. In [17], the authors presented\
    \ some standard protocols that were used to measure the\nrequirements of industrial\
    \ applications. They also provide solutions to WSN protocols by\ndiscussing MAC,\
    \ routing, and transport in detail. They also discussed the security issues\n\
    in detail and identiﬁed the unsolved challenges encountered during designing standard\n\
    protocols. In [19], the authors conducted SLR, which is mainly focused on scope\
    \ deﬁnition,\nconcept, literature review, analysis, synthesis, and future research\
    \ directions. Their selected\nstudy has contributed to eight thematic perspectives:\
    \ intelligence factories, CPS, data\nhandling, IT infrastructure, digital transformation,\
    \ HCI, IoT, and cloud [18].\nDue to the rapid evolution in IoT and WSN, technology\
    \ is becoming more vulnerable\nto security threats [42–44]. Therefore authors\
    \ in [27] presented threat models for the security\nof WSN and IoT devices communication.\
    \ In [28], the authors discussed IoT applications,\nadvantages, challenges, and\
    \ security issues from both technological and social perspectives.\nResearchers\
    \ have provided detailed architectures of IoT and WSN and discussions of\nIDS\
    \ system protocols. They also discussed the security challenges and attacks on\
    \ IoT\nand WSN communication devices. Moreover, in [29], the authors conducted\
    \ extensive\nresearch related to smart homes, applications, and IoT. They collected\
    \ 229 articles, analyzed\nthem thoroughly, and divided them into four categories.\
    \ They discussed smart home IoT\napplications in the ﬁrst category. The second\
    \ category concerned with IoT applications\nin smart home technology. In the third\
    \ category, they developed a framework to operate\nfurther. In the fourth category,\
    \ they developed smart IoT home applications.\nIoT has dramatically changed human\
    \ life, especially regarding communication devices\nintegrating technologies.\
    \ Traditional industry is changing in the digital industry, and WSN\nand wireless\
    \ sensor and actuator networks (WSANs) are the core parts of Industry 4.0.\nIn\
    \ the article [30], the authors discussed the industrial wireless sensor network\
    \ (IWSN)\nand industrial wireless sensor and actuator network (IWSAN) in detail.\
    \ They discussed\nIWSAN requirements, applications, challenges, solutions, and\
    \ future directions in detail.\nIWSN/IWSAN are compelling technologies due to\
    \ their promising beneﬁts, such as low-\ncost deployment, less complexity, and\
    \ mobility support.\nIn [31], the authors discussed how IoT plays a vital role\
    \ in bringing the physical\nworld close to the digital world. They discussed technologies,\
    \ various challenges, future\ndirections, and various Internet of Things (IoT)\
    \ applications.\nIn [32], Sharma et al. have described the sensor nodes according\
    \ to coverage point of\nview. They analyzed the full coverage issues by considering\
    \ node type, deployment type,\ncommunication and sensing range, and positioning-based\
    \ independent algorithms. They\nalso discussed the research challenges of WSN.\n\
    Andrey et al. [33] described a detailed survey on IDS systems and presented the\n\
    methods proposed for IoT. Using a cross-platform distributed approach, they analyzed\n\
    the IDS system, their platform differences, and current research trends in IDS.\
    \ In [34], the\nauthors analyzed and discussed the solutions to identify and detect\
    \ sinkhole attacks in the\nWSN domain. They discussed the advantages and limitations\
    \ of the proposed solution as\nwell. In [35], the authors presented a detailed\
    \ review on security attacks of WSN and IoT\nalong with their preventive measures,\
    \ mitigations, and detection mechanisms. They stated\nthat the integration of\
    \ IoT and WSN has raised new challenges and open security issues.\nAlthough technology\
    \ has increased, it has become prone to external attacks.\nIn [36], the authors\
    \ presented a review on the security of mobile networks. They\ndiscussed the integration\
    \ of WSN with IoT via the Internet and how the inter-connected\ndevices have guarded\
    \ networks against external attacks, keeping the router in a secure and\nprotected\
    \ environment. They discussed the attacks and their detection mechanisms over\
    \ the\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n9 of 36\nInternet. Similarly, the authors in [37]\
    \ have discussed the wormhole attack and its solution\nin IoT and WSN domains.\
    \ They stated that the detection algorithm performed much\nbetter for IoT (70%)\
    \ than WSN (20%). In [45], the authors discussed side-channel attacks\nin smartphones.\
    \ Similarly, the authors in [38] discussed the security threats, challenges,\n\
    and solutions in the IoT domain. While in [39], the authors analyzed existing\
    \ protocols for\nsecure communication between IoT devices. They also discussed\
    \ open issues and challenges\nraised during the communication of IoT devices and\
    \ future directions in IoT. The authors\nin [40] presented a detailed review regarding\
    \ deployment schemes, classiﬁcation, working,\nand comparative analyses of sensor\
    \ nodes. This growing technology trend has converged\nthe “world sense” from traditional\
    \ systems to CPS—this transition is called Industry 4.0.\nThe authors in [41]\
    \ conducted a bibliometric review of 12 different approaches of critical\naspects\
    \ of Industry 4.0.\nFrom the above-detailed literature review, we noticed that\
    \ authors and researchers\nhave worked on IoT and WSN, but the integration of\
    \ both IoT & WSN with Industry 4.0 is\nbenign. They discussed their applications,\
    \ security attacks, advantages, and limitations at\neach level.\nThe proposed\
    \ paper is more oriented towards the applications and contributions of\nIoT and\
    \ WSN in Industry 4.0, along with the security attacks, their challenges, and\
    \ open\nissues in each domain. This paper also provides the limitations and future\
    \ directions for\nIoT and WSN in Industry 4.0.\n3. Research Methodology\nThe SLR\
    \ followed in this work is based on the template of IEEE SLR; all research\nsteps\
    \ and guidelines were followed using the same template. The research process and\n\
    results were manually evaluated by comparing different research methods and techniques\n\
    presented by different authors based on efﬁciency, security, limitations, and\
    \ performance.\nFirst, we formulated our research questions based on the reviewed\
    \ articles and then\nsearched for these keywords in various databases. Using avoidance\
    \ and consideration\ncriteria, only relevant papers were considered. Then, we\
    \ evaluated the quality of the papers,\nand then extracted the relevant features.\n\
    3.1. Planning Review\nThe planning of the review was based on the research questions\
    \ and their objectives.\nAnalyzes of IoT and WSN were conducted to show their\
    \ importance in daily life. The use of\nsmart and appropriate devices has been\
    \ studied in this ﬁeld but still needs critical analysis.\nTherefore, it is important\
    \ to make a systematic review article in this realm, especially\nrelated to IoT\
    \ and WSN, to show future directions. Therefore, we established the search\ntechnique,\
    \ search strings, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and quality assessment criteria\
    \ for\nthe papers collected from different repositories. Figure 4 shows the step\
    \ of our proposed\nreview planning process.\nFigure 4. Planning process of systematic\
    \ literature review (SLR).\n3.2. Research Goals\nThe main objective of this study\
    \ is to ﬁnd out the major contributions, solved problems,\nand challenges of IoT\
    \ and WSN in Industry 4.0. In addition, the research gap and limitations\nof current\
    \ work in these areas helped us ﬁnd room for improvement; we also explored\nfuture\
    \ directions and possible outcomes in this area. We designed questionnaires on\
    \ these\ndomains to ﬁnd high quality research papers. Some of them are listed\
    \ in Table 3. In addition,\nwe answer the research questions in Table 3 and in\
    \ Section 4 .\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n10 of 36\nTable 3. Research questions.\n\

    \ are the limitations and research gaps in the existing work?\n3.3. Selection\
    \ of Primary Studies\nIt was a challenge to search the speciﬁc and limited computer\
    \ science/engineering\ndatabases to get a “complete picture” of the research questions.\
    \ After formulating the\nresearch questions, we collected research papers from\
    \ various repositories, such as IEEE\nXplore, ACM, Wiley Online Search, Elsevier,\
    \ etc. The papers from electronic databases\nwith the areas of IoT, WSN, and Industry\
    \ 4.0 were efﬁciently evaluated. Figure 5 shows the\nnames of the repositories\
    \ where the research articles were collected from 2014 to June 2021.\nFigure 5.\
    \ Repositories versus number of studies Used.\n3.4. Selection/Search Criteria\n\
    This SLR combines three domains: IoT, WSN, and Industrial Revolution 4.0, so the\
    \ search\nstrings were related to each domain and its applications in Industry\
    \ 4.0. Table 4 shows the\nsubject search strings used to search for relevant articles.\
    \ The search strings were divided into\nfive groups to search for relevant articles\
    \ from reputable journals and conferences.\nTable 4. Search strings.\nSr. No.\n\

    \ research articles were found on the mentioned domains, IoT, WSN and IR 4.0.\n\
    To extract the most relevant and concise data from these articles, the following\
    \ criteria were\nchosen, as shown in Table 5. The publicly available papers written\
    \ in English and related\nto the search strings and research objectives in IoT,\
    \ WSN, and IR 4.0 published between\n2014 and 2021 were considered for further\
    \ SLR tracking.\nTable 5. Inclusion and exclusion criteria.\nInclusion Criteria\n\
    1\nInclude only those papers written in the English language.\n2\nInclude papers\
    \ that were published in 2014–2021.\n3\nInclude papers that reﬂected enough knowledge\
    \ about the search strings and search objectives.\n4\nInclude papers whose titles,\
    \ keywords, abstracts, and conclusions provided enough information related to\n\
    WSN, IoT, and IR 4.0.\n5\nInclude papers whose content focused on WSN, IoT, and\
    \ IR 4.0 content and provided in depth insights.\nExclusion Criteria\n1\nExclude\
    \ papers written in a language other than the English language.\n2\nExclude gray\
    \ papers.\n3\nExclude papers that were not published within 2014–2021.\n4\nExclude\
    \ research papers containing less than three pages.\n5\nExclude papers that failed\
    \ to meet the inclusion criteria.\n3.6. Selection Results\nAs mentioned earlier,\
    \ the downloaded articles were based on the initial screening\nprocesses, which\
    \ were based on inclusion criteria. The articles were screened using the\ninitial\
    \ quality assessment criteria (QAC). The main objective of using the QAC was to\n\
    ensure that the primary studies selected were appropriate to address the concerns\
    \ of\nprevious studies. Nearly 300 articles were found on the above topics. After\
    \ applying\na duplication ﬁlter, 40 articles were discarded, leaving 260 articles\
    \ that were reviewed\nbased on the above exclusion criteria. In the next step,\
    \ 60 articles were excluded based\non the inclusion/exclusion criteria. A quality\
    \ analysis was performed for the remaining\n200 articles. After the quality analysis,\
    \ only 120 articles were reviewed. Figure 6 shows\nthe year-by-year distribution\
    \ of articles reviewed that were used for the SLR study. There\nis no doubt that\
    \ the eliminated articles contained valuable material, but they were not\nstudied\
    \ because they did not meet the screening criteria. The number of articles was\n\
    initially limited to 120, after which they were stored in the citation manager\
    \ software for\ninformation synthesis.\nThe selected papers were evaluated against\
    \ the quality assessment criteria (QAC)\nlisted in Table 6. Table 6 shows the\
    \ quality assessment criteria (QAC) used to screen the\narticles for response\
    \ grading. Studies selected for screening are described in Table 7. Studies\n\
    with a score greater than or equal to 80 were selected according to the grading\
    \ criteria\nshown in Figure 7.\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n12 of 36\nFigure 6. Year-wise\

    \ 2022, 22, 2087\n18 of 36\n4.1. RQ1: Contributions of WSN in IR 4.0\nThe use\
    \ of WSN has attracted a lot of attention in industry. Because of their prevalence\n\
    and use in industry, WSN have given rise to IWSN and IWSAN, respectively. These\
    \ net-\nworks enable autonomous work without human intervention. The in-network\
    \ transmission\ncharacteristics are fundamental properties of WSN. Sensor nodes\
    \ do not transmit raw\ndata, but integrate it to save communication costs. Due\
    \ to their unique properties and\nwide range of applications, they are used in\
    \ many systems, such as military, surveillance,\nhome automation, smart cities,\
    \ smart buildings, and healthcare monitoring [27]. WSN- and\nIoT-based devices\
    \ are used to create reliable, realistic, efﬁcient, ﬂexible, and economical\n\
    smart cities and buildings in heterogeneous environments [48].\nFigure 8. Taxonomy\
    \ of existing studies.\nThe categories discussed in this paper and the contribution\
    \ of WSN in IR 4.0 are\nlisted in the form of a taxonomy presented in Figure 8.\
    \ WSN is also used in health care\nmanagement systems to monitor medically ill\
    \ patients, periodically check their various\nmeasurements such as blood glucose\
    \ levels and pulse, and wirelessly transmit this in-\nformation to a central repository\
    \ for further diagnosis [49]. WSN is also used to assist\nelderly and disabled\
    \ people. Disabled people are informed of relevant information about\nreal-time\
    \ activities using smart devices, such as wristwatches [28,50]. In recent decades,\n\
    WSN have been applied in many ﬁelds, including transportation, agriculture [51],\
    \ automa-\ntion, manufacturing process control, and supply chain management. In\
    \ addition, WSN\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n19 of 36\ncan be easily deployed, have\
    \ low construction cost, no expenditure on wiring, and lower\ncomplexity [52,53].\n\
    WSN can be used in various manufacturing applications, such as industrial control,\n\
    process automation, rescue, and defense. WSN is also used to control and automate\n\
    industrial processes known as actuators. They can operate independently of a physi-\n\
    cal environment deﬁned by predeﬁned dimensions [54]. WSN is used to collect, track,\n\
    and record data in smart factories. Data acquisition is usually done by product\
    \ informa-\ntion in smart factories. After data collection, processing is done\
    \ by intelligent machines\nand manufacturing systems. Nowadays, these factories\
    \ are self-sufﬁcient, cost-effective,\nand automated by integrating wireless communications\
    \ with existing private networks\nand reducing labor [30].\nIn software, WSN takes\
    \ maximum advantage of wireless technologies used to build\nindustrial network\
    \ infrastructure [55]. On the other side, Industry 4.0 is integrating big data\n\
    analytics and cloud services [56], 3D printing, computer security, autonomous\
    \ robotics, the\nInternet of Things (IoT), 5G, Augmented Reality (AR), and modeling\
    \ [57,58].\n4.2. RQ2: Contributions of IoT in IR 4.0\nAn integrated digital system\
    \ would introduce a new intelligent and economical man-\nufacturing process using\
    \ cutting-edge technology for a variety of existing items and pro-\ncesses [59].\
    \ The data collected from production process warehouses and consumer in-\nformation\
    \ can be critically analyzed to make a decision in real time under Industry 4.0.\n\
    The real-time decision-making capability of each small and medium organization\
    \ enables\nthem to efﬁciently accept new technologies [60,61]. Industrial IoT\
    \ delivers solutions and\nservices that provide insights into an organization’s\
    \ ability to monitor and control its oper-\nations and assets. IIoT software and\
    \ tools provide important solutions for better process,\nlayout scheduling, organization,\
    \ and administration.\nIn addition, IIoT enables real-time and decision-making\
    \ features among numerous\nnetworked devices that can communicate and interact\
    \ with each other [62]. Because of\nthe rapid communication and data transfer,\
    \ attackers can attack data and cause harm to\nan organization, resulting in cyber\
    \ attacks. Cyber attacks have become a major challenge\nfor the industrial Internet\
    \ of Things (IIoT). Therefore, integrating IoT with Industry 4.0\nplays a critical\
    \ role in securing IoT devices from attacks. Unique security objectives and\n\
    challenges of IIoT have been introduced to overcome industrial-level issues. IIoT\
    \ challenges\nand objectives relate to IoT being used by consumers and its capabilities\
    \ leading to longer\nlife of IoT devices and sensor nodes. In [63], the authors\
    \ analyzed security challenges\nand attacks at three levels of the network (perception,\
    \ network, and application). They\nconsidered cryptographic challenges, authentication,\
    \ network monitoring, and access\ncontrol mechanisms. The IIoT also addresses\
    \ local network connectivity and protection\nfrom attackers inside. Cyber attacks\
    \ have become a serious challenge for the IIoT. Hackers\nattack infrastructure/devices\
    \ through intrusion and hiding, resulting in poor performance.\nA bidirectional\
    \ long and short term memory network with a multi-feature layer has been\ndeveloped\
    \ to avoid temporal attacks. Machine learning-based networks that learn temporal\n\
    attacks from historical data and make associations with test data can effectively\
    \ identify\nand detect different attacks within different intervals [64].\nDL-IIoT\
    \ has enormous potential to improve data processing and contribute to IR 4.0.\n\
    Similarly, machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, are widely\
    \ used for\nmalware detection and security threat protection [65]. Deep learning\
    \ algorithms are also\nused for intelligent analysis and processing. Deep learning\
    \ [46]algorithms such as CNN,\nauto-encoders, and recurrent neural networks have\
    \ applications such as intelligent assem-\nbly and manufacturing, network monitoring,\
    \ and accident prevention. The application\nof deep learning algorithms in IIoT\
    \ has also enabled various smart applications such as\nmanufacturing, active attack\
    \ detection and prevention systems, smart meters, and smart\nagriculture [66].\
    \ DL-IIoT relies heavily on data collection, which affects the privacy of the\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 2087\n20 of 36\norganization’s data. Therefore, differentiated\
    \ privacy is used to protect user privacy, reduce\nprivacy risk, and achieve high\
    \ performance in IIoT.\nOn the other hand, IoT and IIoT must provide “differentiated\
    \ privacy” for individuals\nand industrial data [67–69]. The contribution of IoT\
    \ in Industry 4.0 has improved the\naverage availability and sustainability of\
    \ the enterprise by knowing market trends and\ndecreasing unanticipated downturns\
    \ [70]. The taxonomy of existing studies and the\ncontribution of IoT in IR 4.0\
    \ is shown in Figure 8.\n4.3. RQ3: Type of WSN Coverage Area for IR 4.0\nWSN coverage\
    \ is an important factor in sensor quality. Sensing and connectivity\nare key\
    \ features of WSN. The former indicate how well a particular sensor behaves and\n\
    monitors a particular area of interest in which it is deployed. Connectivity shows\
    \ how\nwell different nodes communicate with each other. The types of wireless\
    \ sensor network\ncoverage are as follows.\n4.3.1. Area Coverage\nSensors usually\
    \ perform well in area coverage and monitors the ﬁeld of interest (FoI).\nThis\
    \ is also called “blanket coverage” because each node communicates with others.\
    \ Each\nsensor is placed so that the coverage of the other WSN sensors covers\
    \ each other [32].\n4.3.2. Barrier Coverage\nBarrier coverage of the sensor network\
    \ comes into play when some intruders try to\nbreach the security layer of the\
    \ network. Sensors are easy to handle and deploy; therefore,\ntheir wireless nature\
    \ makes them vulnerable to malicious security attacks [71]. The sensor\nnodes\
    \ are primarily distributed throughout the network and are deployed in chains\
    \ to\ndetect interruptions.\n4.3.3. Point Coverage\nPoint coverage aims to ﬁnd\
    \ a target within range using nearby nodes. It is also known\nas target coverage.\
    \ It is characterized by consuming less energy in a given zone than in the\nentire\
    \ region of the FoI. Only a few targets are covered by individual nodes, while\
    \ other\ntargets can be detected under other sensor scopes. The primary goal is\
    \ to select a speciﬁc\ntarget within the FoI to reduce energy consumption [71].\n\
    4.4. RQ4: Classiﬁcation of Network Intruders\nThere are two main types of intruders:\
    \ internal and external. Internal intruders are\npeople inside the organization;\
    \ they can be either a customer or a legitimate user, such\nas an employee of\
    \ the organization’s network. External intruders are people outside the\norganization,\
    \ whether external or internal. Each intruder can be involved in numerous\nillegal\
    \ activities, working alone, as a group, or with agencies. These entities are\
    \ described\nin detail below.\n4.4.1. Solo Entities\nSolo entities are those that\
    \ work alone with minimal safety. They are usually experts\nin their domains by\
    \ employing a single piece of code as equipment, such as viruses,\nworms, and\
    \ sniffers to misuse frameworks. They usually gain access to the organization’s\n\
    framework through hardware damage and web loopholes. Their targets are usually\
    \ little,\nand attacks are slightly less critical. Moreover, large and complex\
    \ systems that may contain\nﬂaws are more vulnerable to attacks. Monetary institutions\
    \ are also more exposed to attacks\nas they exchange sensitive information [72].\n\
    4.4.2. Organized Groups\nSolo entities are those who work alone with minimal security.\
    \ They are usually experts\nin their ﬁeld, using a single piece of code as equipment,\
    \ such as viruses, worms, and sniffers\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n21 of 36\nto abuse\
    \ frameworks. They generally gain access to the organization’s framework through\n\
    hardware damage and web loopholes. Their targets are usually small, and attacks\
    \ are\nsomewhat less critical. In addition, large and complex systems that may\
    \ contain ﬂaws are\nmore vulnerable to attack. Monetary institutions are also\
    \ more exposed to attacks because\nthey exchange sensitive information [72].\n\
    4.4.3. Intelligence Agencies\nIntelligent agencies from other countries are involved\
    \ in this type of attack. These\nagencies constantly seek to test the military\
    \ architecture of other nations, including contem-\nporary monitoring and covert\
    \ political and military activities. To do so, they require many\nresources, from\
    \ software to hardware, research, development, personnel, and ﬁnances.\nBecause\
    \ they have all these resources at their disposal, some agencies now pose a serious\n\
    threat to economic and military espionage. Such organizations pose the greatest\
    \ threat to\nnetworks and must be closely monitored to protect the nation’s important\
    \ assets [73].\n4.5. RQ5: Network Security Attack in IoT and WSN Layers\nThreats\
    \ become more attractive and dangerous as technology increases. Although new\n\
    security mechanisms are being developed, intruders can easily ﬁnd other ways to\
    \ attack\nsystems. Table 8 explains the network security attacks in the IoT and\
    \ WSN domains.\nThe attacks are categorized according to the open system interconnection\
    \ (OSI) layered\npoint of view [74].\nTable 8. Network Security Attacks on IoT\

    \ DoS.\n4.5.1. Denial of Service Attacks (DOS)\nA Denial-of-service (DoS) attack\
    \ is a malicious attack in which attackers make the\nvictim’s system unresponsive\
    \ and difﬁcult to reach for the legitimate user by making many\nrequests to the\
    \ expected URL than the server can handle [75,76]. DoS attacks typically occur\n\
    when authenticated clients have not been granted access to the information or\
    \ service [77].\nA distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is a type of DoS\
    \ attack that uses multiple users\nor infected systems to attack a victim’s system\
    \ or to attack a website so that it becomes\nunresponsive. This attack also prevents\
    \ the website from functioning properly and disrupts\nregular trafﬁc. In WSN,\
    \ a DDoS attack changes the routing protocol information DSR,\nresulting in a\
    \ huge amount of unauthorized trafﬁc and making the network/website\nunavailable.\
    \ On the other hand, a low-rate denial-of-service (LDoS) attack is another type\n\
    of DoS that penetrates the WSN’s routing protocol, thus compromising the security\
    \ and\ntrust mechanisms. An LDoS attack is difﬁcult to detect due to its non-stationary\
    \ nature and\nlow signal strength52. In this attack, illegitimate trafﬁc affects\
    \ the operational capability of\na network. It causes severe outages and monetary\
    \ losses.\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n22 of 36\n4.5.2. Replay Attacks\nWhen an attacker\
    \ replays a ﬂood of messages between the sender and the receiver,\nupdating the\
    \ line table (DT) to steal information, it is called a replay attack [33]. It\
    \ is a\nnetwork layer attack in which a third party intercepts the data during\
    \ transmission. The\nattacker retransmits this data by either modifying or delaying\
    \ it, spooﬁng the sender’s IP\naddress to the attacker’s IP address, and impersonating\
    \ the legitimate sender.\n4.5.3. Trojan Worms, Viruses, and Malware\nAn attacker\
    \ can use malicious software to manipulate data, steal information, or\neven launch\
    \ a denial-of-service attack on a device. A worm, such as a Trojan horse, can\n\
    infect one’s computer when one downloads a ﬁle or receives an update. The worm\
    \ then\nmultiplies and attacks other machines on the network. Unlike a virus,\
    \ many Trojan horses\nusually reside on one’s own computer. A virus can infect\
    \ the host’s ﬁle when sent via\nemail and then spread to other users [78]. Malware\
    \ is malicious content that can interfere\nwith a computer’s operation and slow\
    \ its performance. When data from IoT devices is\ncompromised, malware can infest\
    \ the cloud or data centers. These attacks breach the\nprimary security mechanisms\
    \ of any OS/server, such as a ﬁrewall and window defender.\n4.5.4. Black Hole\
    \ Attacks\nThis is a network layer attack known as a packet drop attack. In this\
    \ attack, a node\nsends an RREQ packet to all its neighbors in the network, and\
    \ the router is supposed to\nforward the packet instead of discarding it. The\
    \ nature of this attack is similar to a DDoS\nattack. Attackers are used to attack\
    \ routers by sending many false requests to prevent\nlegitimate routers from forwarding\
    \ packets. This is also called a ﬁrst-come, ﬁrst-served\nattack because the attacker\
    \ can also use a malicious router or reprogram it to block packets\ninstead of\
    \ sending correct information [78]. These attacks reduce the average throughput.\n\
    When combined with a sinkhole attack, this attack affects performance and stops\
    \ all trafﬁc\naround the black hole. When combined with the sinkhole attack, this\
    \ attack severely\ndegrades trafﬁc and modiﬁes or discards content during transmission.\n\
    4.5.5. Sink Hole Attacks\nThis is a network layer attack where attackers attract\
    \ all network trafﬁc from nearby\nnodes to a compromised node and appear as attractive\
    \ and trusted nodes. This attack\nis also used to initiate other attacks such\
    \ as spooﬁng attacks, DoS, and modiﬁcation of\nrouting information in WSN [34].\
    \ When combined with selective routing and worm attacks,\nsinkhole attacks become\
    \ even more dangerous. A sinkhole attack is initiated in two ways,\neither by\
    \ hacking a node within the network or by a malicious node impersonating itself\n\
    as the shortest path to the base station [35,36]. A sinkhole attack impacts the\
    \ routing\nconﬁguration/protocols of the forwarding node. Due to this behavior,\
    \ it is considered as an\nerror or malicious node by the neighboring nodes, which\
    \ affects the network performance.\nThis leads to mis-routing and incorrect displays\
    \ of the routing protocol.\n4.5.6. Wormhole Attacks\nA wormhole attack is a network\
    \ layer attack in which an invader attacks the WSN\nthrough two or more compromised\
    \ nodes. The invaders forward the data from one\nmalicious node to another node\
    \ at the end of the network through the tunnel. The wormhole\nappears to other\
    \ nodes as a ﬁctitious neighbor. Wormhole nodes usually transmit data\ndirectly\
    \ from one node to the destination without including other nodes in the path.\
    \ Due\nto this nature, other nodes in WSN easily trust those closest to other\
    \ nodes, which causes\nmany routing problems. Moreover, they can build better\
    \ communication channels for\nlong-range communication [37]. Wormhole attacks\
    \ affect the performance of many network\nservices, such as time synchronization,\
    \ localization, and data fusion.\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n23 of 36\n4.5.7. Selective\
    \ Forwarding (Gray Hole)\nA selective forwarding attack (SFA) is a special type\
    \ of black hole attack in which\nthe compromised node drops some selective packets\
    \ instead of all packets. Invaders drop\npackets containing critical information,\
    \ such as military information, without noticing them\nor allowing others that\
    \ may contain non-critical information to pass. This can lead to worse\neffects\
    \ and a decrease in network efﬁciency [34–37]. Selective forwarding attacks impact\n\
    network performance and consume limited energy resources.\n4.6. RQ6: Issues in\
    \ WSN and IoT Frameworks\nIn this section, we mention various WSN and IoT frameworks\
    \ that highlight the\nimportance of WSN and IoT in different aspects of life.\
    \ Although many advances have\nbeen made in IoT, there are still many problems,\
    \ as shown in Figure 9, that need to be\nreduced and solved efﬁciently to avoid\
    \ any damage [79,80].\nFigure 9. Issues in WSN and IoT Framework.\n4.6.1. Security\n\
    Security is essential for any organization to protect its environment, systems,\
    \ devices\nand applications from outside attacks. Data and communication technologies\
    \ are increasing\nevery day. Therefore, data and information security are necessary\
    \ tasks [81]. In addition to\ndata, its transmission over the network should also\
    \ be protected. Although technology has\nevolved and security mechanisms have\
    \ improved, attackers have still found many ways to\nbreach the security level\
    \ [38,39]. With the increasing number of IoT devices, new security\nissues have\
    \ emerged. For real-time applications, the most important thing is to keep the\n\
    WSN secure. The network and its associated router or hub should enforce an access\
    \ control\nmechanism to prevent unauthorized users. Each node connected to another\
    \ node is security\nrelevant, whether it is a restricted device or a smart device.\
    \ Acceptance, conﬁrmation,\ncategorization, trust, and information security are\
    \ the most important security requirements\nto be considered in IoT networks and\
    \ WSN. It is challenging to provide security measures\nfor ﬂexible detection devices.\
    \ Therefore, protecting information from dictatorial forces or\nillegal access\
    \ is called security [82,83].\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n24 of 36\n4.6.2. Data Conﬁdentiality\
    \ and Privacy\nData conﬁdentiality is a signiﬁcant issue in IoT and network security.\
    \ In IoT frame-\nworks, the client gains access to the information and system\
    \ management in an unintended\nenvironment due to issues such as the use of sensor\
    \ nodes. Attackers can physically capture\nthem and extract data using an energy\
    \ analysis attack [84]. Refurbished devices made from\nthese captured devices\
    \ can launch new attacks and violate security. Therefore, the IoT\ndevice should\
    \ verify whether or not the user or device has been granted permission to\naccess\
    \ the system. The practice of controlling access to data by granting or denying\
    \ permis-\nsion based on a set of laws. Many devices/clients must be authenticated\
    \ by management\nto access the system. Data conﬁdentiality and access are the\
    \ main issues in the Internet\nof Things (IoT). Researchers are trying to ﬁgure\
    \ out how to handle the personalities of\ncustomers, items/articles, and devices\
    \ in a secure manner. Due to the ubiquitous nature\nof IoT and WSN systems, privacy\
    \ and conﬁdentiality are major concerns in IoT devices\nand frameworks. Some issues,\
    \ such as snifﬁng and spooﬁng, unauthorized access, data\nchanging, forging, and\
    \ unapproved alteration of IoT and WSN nodes, pose signiﬁcant\nuncertainties in\
    \ IoT. An attacker can use various IoT devices and applications to capture\nsensitive\
    \ and personal data that is visible to outsiders.\n4.6.3. Data Acquisition and\
    \ Transmission\nThe primary goal of IoT is to collect data and transmit it to\
    \ where it is needed in a\nnetwork. Sensors are the devices used to collect data\
    \ from the environment to transmit it to\nthe base station. After the raw data\
    \ is collected, it is sent to the Sink Hub for processing. Data\ncollection and\
    \ transmission are other problems in IoT and WSN because data is exposed\nand\
    \ modiﬁed during transmission. Data acquisition is an energy-consuming process,\
    \ so\nextra care must be taken during gathering and transmission. Intruders can\
    \ steal the data\nduring transmission if it is not encrypted or transmitted over\
    \ a secure channel. The intruder\ncan take over a node and reprogram it with a\
    \ malicious code, damaging the entire network.\nTherefore, security is required\
    \ for this process. Sometimes intruders attack the databases of\norganizations\
    \ to violate the conﬁdentiality of the data [85]. Also, the intruder may destroy\n\
    the node or collect important or unusual information that could be used against\
    \ the system.\nFor this reason, researchers present many security mechanisms.\
    \ They protect end-to-end\ncommunication links using one-time-pad (OTP) encryption\
    \ method and also identify the\nvulnerabilities in the DBMS application using\
    \ SEPTIC method.\n4.6.4. Resource Limitations\nIf necessary resources in WSN and\
    \ IoT are abandoned or not handled efﬁciently, it may\naffect the performance\
    \ of the network. The network consists of many nodes and sensors that\nrequire\
    \ energy to operate well [86]. Various MAC layer protocols have been developed\
    \ to\nreduce the energy consumption of sensors or nodes. These energy-efﬁcient\
    \ algorithms work\nprimarily by regulating the synchronization of network trafﬁc\
    \ over time and the time period\nduring which a node becomes active in a network\
    \ [87,88]. In contrast, the communication\nmedium is another basic requirement,\
    \ since nodes rely on the Internet for data transmission.\nThere is a constant\
    \ need for energy, otherwise the network will fail. The nodes have limited\nresources\
    \ because battery capacity, correspondence capacity, and computing power are low.\n\
    Again, security is the main problem, because the security measurement expenses\
    \ require\nmore resources to maintain the speed of the network, which is not affordable.\
    \ As a result of\nlow regulated security, attacks can subvert software execution\
    \ and protocols used in the\nnetwork [89,90].\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n25 of 36\n\
    4.6.5. Quality of Service\nQuality of Service (QoS) manages networks and resources\
    \ to strengthen IoT connec-\ntivity. QoS manages delay, jitter, reliability, and\
    \ bandwidth by classifying network trafﬁc.\nIt plays an important role in optimizing\
    \ systems. Quality of Service means that energy\nefﬁciency, reliability, bit error\
    \ rate, and latency should be good enough to capture data\nover a network. Therefore,\
    \ it is classiﬁed in two ways: program-speciﬁc and network-\nspeciﬁc. The QoS\
    \ perspective of the network refers to the effective management of network\nresources\
    \ and transmission performance, while the perspective of the program refers to\n\
    mobility, time synchronization, and sampling parameters. Similarly, many algorithms\
    \ have\nbeen developed to distribute heavy trafﬁc evenly, and the energy consumption\
    \ load in a\nnetwork uses a cluster-head approach to achieve high performance\
    \ and efﬁciency [91].\n4.6.6. Tampering\nSensors can be placed either indoors\
    \ or outdoors. Indoor sensors can be easily man-\naged and protected, while outdoor\
    \ sensors are more vulnerable to attackers due to remote\nlocations with poor\
    \ security, harsh climates, etc 78. The probability that these sensors will\n\
    be physically attacked is much higher; therefore, physical protection cannot be\
    \ guaranteed.\nA DoS attack manipulates the network by breaking the connection\
    \ or changing the current\nnetwork. The attacker can also replace the original\
    \ node with a fake or malicious node,\ncausing a severe attack on the network\
    \ [92]. In a Sybil attack, a malicious node penetrates\neach cluster head of the\
    \ network and affects the operation of the routing protocol. Com-\npromised nodes\
    \ can be used to launch new attacks without exposing themselves [41,93].\nThese\
    \ nodes are difﬁcult to detect and isolate, allowing an attacker to alter data\
    \ or transmit\nmalware throughout the network that causes signiﬁcant damage [94].\
    \ Constant monitoring\nof the network is necessary to ensure that WSN nodes cannot\
    \ be tampered with and that\nnetwork performance remains stable [95].\n4.6.7.\
    \ Authorization and Authentication\nNodes are the building blocks of the Internet\
    \ of Things that must be deﬁned in the\nnetwork. Transmission between devices\
    \ and access to the entire network span a wide\nrange in IoT and WSN. IoT devices\
    \ perform role-based access control, and their devices are\nallowed to do only\
    \ what is required [96,97]. Devices and their data must be protected from\nphysical\
    \ and logical attacks on the network. Attacks on the DNS cache could affect the\n\
    overall performance of the network. Authentication is the process by which each\
    \ node on\nthe network can access data based on a ﬁxed connection to a server\
    \ or cloud-based server.\nIf the authentication process is not administered properly,\
    \ it will lead to security issues\nand questions. An attacker can easily access\
    \ the network and make it fail temporarily by\nmaking too many wrong attempts.\n\
    Authentication is complicated due to the massive proliferation of wireless media\
    \ and\nthe nature of sensor networks. Authentication is usually done using the\
    \ credentials of a\nlegitimate user [98,99]. However, this technique is not secure\
    \ enough. Therefore, passwords\nshould be changed regularly and computers should\
    \ not be left unattended to make this\ntechnique robust. Both the sender and the\
    \ recipient should perform authentication to verify\nthe origin of the communication\
    \ [100,101].\n4.7. RQ7: Limitations of the Literature Review\nIn this section,\

    \ and quantify the\nvolatile organic compounds.\nThe limitation of this study\
    \ is that\nsensor nodes are less efﬁcient at\ncovering a large area to monitor\n\
    and cannot do real-time testing\nand the ﬁeld measurements of sen-\nsors.\nLi\
    \ et al. [113]\nEdge\ncomputing-\nenabled\nwireless\nsensor\nnetworks\nfor\nmultiple\n\
    data\ncollection tasks in\nsmart agriculture\nThey designed a data collection\
    \ al-\ngorithm considering data quality\nfactors in smart agriculture. Then\n\
    modeled the data collection pro-\ncess by merging WSN and IoT.\nThe developed\
    \ edge computing\ndriven framework [47] and data\ncollection algorithm were not\
    \ ca-\npable of collecting data in a real\nagriculture environment.\nKumar et\
    \ al. [114]\nCluster\ncentroid-\nbased\nenergy-\nefﬁcient\nrouting\nprotocol for\
    \ WSN-\nassisted IoT\nThey developed a system that was\ncapable of self-organization\
    \ of lo-\ncal nodes to save energy. Their\nsystem adopted new algorithms\nto rotate\
    \ head clusters based on\ncentroid locations in IoT using\nWSN. The technique\
    \ exceeds con-\nventional protocols for efﬁciency\ncriteria, such as the consumption\n\
    of energy by the network, interme-\ndiate sensor node, packet distribu-\ntion\
    \ ratio, packet failure percent-\nage, and network output. Their\nwork was best\
    \ for the base station\nlocated in the network.\nThe routing protocol was not\
    \ opti-\nmal, routing strategies were lack-\ning, and packet loss was caused\n\
    if the base stations were even in\nthe network. In the future, they\nwill enhance\
    \ this work by using\na multi-hop path strategy to the\nbase station.\nIn this\
    \ technique,\nthe cluster head will transmit data\nto the base station, even outside\n\
    the network.\nHaseeb et al. [115]\nAn energy-efﬁcient\nand secure IoT-based\n\
    WSN framework: an\napplication to smart\nagriculture\nThey proposed an IoT-based\
    \ WSN\nframework that collected data\nfrom agriculture and transmit-\nted it to\
    \ the nearest base station.\nThey enhanced network through-\nput, low latency\
    \ rate, energy con-\nsumption, and packet drop ratio.\nThey also provided security\
    \ to the\ndata transmission channel using\nthe recurrence of the linear gener-\n\
    ator.\nThe limitation of this work is\nthat they did not assess the\ndevice consistency\
    \ in a mobile\nIoT. Therefore, they will analyze\nthe performance and reliability\n\
    of developed frameworks in the\ntransportation system and mobile-\nbased IoT network.\n\
    5. Challenges and Open Issues\nIntelligent systems can address various problems\
    \ faced by industry, but there have\nbeen some challenges in integrating IoT and\
    \ WSN into Industry 4.0. Technological improve-\nments in IoT and WSN have increased\
    \ concerns about security and data management [96].\nAs more and more data is\
    \ generated, it is difﬁcult for factories and industries to manage\nit properly.\
    \ Artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms have been implemented to manage Big Data\n\
    and make systems and devices act more intelligently. The algorithms are used to\
    \ process\nthe data in different time periods. For education, the data must be\
    \ shared in a central\nrepository, while enterprises are mainly reluctant to share\
    \ their private data due to poor\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n30 of 36\nand insufﬁcient\
    \ organizational support for data in Industry 4.0. There are also safety\nmanagement\
    \ issues in Industry 4.0 [116].\nBig data: The emergence of various technologies\
    \ and the explosion of their use have\nled to the outstanding development of Big\
    \ Data technology and processing. Every device\nproduces a huge amount of data.\
    \ Due to the growing amount of big data, the improve-\nments of Big Data packages\
    \ encounter limitations and demand situations that need to be\n“overcome” in order\
    \ to manage the amount of data used efﬁciently.\nAdapting to 6G: 6G is another\
    \ challenge for wireless sensor networks and the Internet\nof Things. Processing\
    \ power is a major challenge in developing low-power and low-cost\n6G devices.\
    \ In addition, 6G brings privacy and security challenges for WSN and IoT.\nUpdates:system\
    \ components could not be upgraded due to interoperability between\nprotocols,\
    \ systems, and their components. Therefore, systems are more vulnerable to attack\n\
    if any part of a single system from a network is infected in intelligent factories.\n\
    Environment: security is also a critical challenge in WSN [97,100,106]. WSN nodes\n\
    are not secure when deployed in a prone environment due to the wireless transmission\
    \ of\ndata. An attacker can access them from anywhere in the world and manipulate\
    \ them easily.\nInternet attacks can also affect the vulnerability of sensor nodes.\n\
    Supply chain management systems: IoT devices are spreading erery day, posing new\n\
    challenges to the integrity and scalability of supply chain management systems\
    \ [117,118].\nSimultaneously connecting IoT devices to the cloud or the Internet\
    \ requires a lot of access\ncontrol, fault tolerance, data management, privacy,\
    \ and security.\nLimited resources: are other challenges in WSN domain that affect\
    \ the energy of\nsensor nodes used in the network. Sensor nodes usually change\
    \ their mode from sleep to\nactive and vice versa. Therefore, sleep mode is considered\
    \ as \"outside the network\" while\nactive mode brings some other issues such\
    \ as energy consumption [119]. Due to the high\nenergy consumption, they also\
    \ became dead. Sensor nodes usually have limited power,\nprocessing, and memory.\
    \ In addition, sensor mobility is another problem that hinders the\nintegration\
    \ of mobile sensor nodes with the Internet.\n6. Future Directions\nIndustry 4.0\
    \ leads to the merging of people and technology to complement human\nactivities\
    \ with intelligent machines. Industry 4.0 will lead to customized human fashion\n\
    that will minimize the oversupply and unavailability of supplies or items. Human-machine\n\
    interaction will increase productivity and customer satisfaction with customized\
    \ products.\nThe next version of Industry 4.0 is Industry 5.0, which is expected\
    \ to be more user-\nfriendly and better integrate technology with society and\
    \ the environment. It depends\nmainly on robots. Robots are already the backbone\
    \ of manufacturing, and Industry 4.0\ntechnologies [120,121] provide ﬂexibility\
    \ in manufacturing. Industry 5.0 combines human\ncreativity and craftsmanship\
    \ with the speed, productivity (e.g., CPS) [122], and consistency\nof robots.\
    \ In this version, robots can be programmed to work alongside humans.\nSoft computing:\
    \ can be used to reduce the dimensions of these large dimensional\ndata sets [123].\
    \ Good features are essential to make efﬁcient decisions. This is the reason\n\
    why soft computing techniques are used to obtain useful features.\nExplainable\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence (XAI): can be used for interpretability of the deci-\n\
    sion made by the classiﬁcation model. Classiﬁcation models make decisions in a\
    \ black box\nwhere the user does not know how the decision is made. XAI converts\
    \ this black box into a\nwhite box and interprets the decision made by a model.\
    \ XAI increases user conﬁdence to\ntake further action [124].\nFederated learning\
    \ (FL): is an optimal choice for privacy preservation. FL works by\ntraining global\
    \ and local models on the edge device. The model on the edge device does\nnot\
    \ share the data with the global, thus keeping the data private at each edge device.\
    \ Only\nparameters are shared globally to retrain the global model and optimize\
    \ the inference\nresults [125,126].\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n31 of 36\nSecure\
    \ devices: sensor nodes are designed to consume less energy and become active\n\
    when they are needed or an event occurs [59]. Further improvements are also needed\
    \ to\nprevent attacks from the Internet. While the IoT has no limitations in terms\
    \ of processing\nor energy. Due to the tremendous proliferation of IoT devices,\
    \ this paradigm is now being\nshifted from the IoT to the Internet of Everything.\n\
    Sustainability: IoT systems are now moving toward the idea of self-organization,\n\
    and systems are becoming capable of responding in an automated and adaptive manner\n\
    and dealing with changes and uncertainties in the environment [118].\nEducation\
    \ 5.0: in this digital era, education must also change from traditional to\nintegrating\
    \ hardware and software with co-bots to develop new skills and a smart society.\n\
    Educational institutes are now using pedagogical tools to provide a better experience.\n\
    Even though IoT-based education is still not widespread, there is still room for\
    \ further\nimprovement, such as sensor node coverage and efﬁciency, wireless data\
    \ transmission of\ndata [127], battery life, and high-cost nodes.\nGeneral directions:\
    \ there are many challenges. Future directions may address het-\nerogeneous interoperability\
    \ of systems, self-organization protocols, routing schemes for\nmanaging IoT networks,\
    \ data management [79], cross-platform optimization, and the\ndevelopment of network\
    \ security algorithms to secure wireless transmission from data\nmanipulation,\
    \ stealing, or hacking activities. On the hardware side, researchers are de-\n\
    veloping energy-efﬁcient sensor nodes [91,115], with net-zero power to reduce\
    \ maximum\npower consumption.\n7. Conclusions\nIn this digital and modern era,\
    \ technology is evolving every day. Due to the massive\nproliferation of technology,\
    \ IoT and WSN play an important role in Industry 4.0 to develop\nsmart applications,\
    \ design networked data centers, and build autonomous smart industries.\nData\
    \ networks have been created and improved with the help of new and smart devices.\n\
    In this systematic literature review, WSN and IoT network threats were analyzed\
    \ and a\ndescriptive comparative study was conducted. These networks are the main\
    \ attack surfaces\nfor attackers to draw meaningful patterns from system and user\
    \ data. Wireless sensor\nnetworks (WSN) and the Internet of Things (IoT) have\
    \ rapidly (and widely) evolved to meet\nthe increasing demand for conventional\
    \ application scenarios, such as plant automation\nand remote process control\
    \ systems. These smart devices are also being used to improve the\nefﬁciency of\
    \ existing networks and create new opportunities for automating and securing\n\
    industrial processes. In this article, we explore seven research questions: (i)\
    \ What are the\ncontributions of WSN in IR4. 0? (ii) What are the contributions\
    \ of IoT in IR 4.0? (iii) What\nare the types of WSN coverage areas for IR 4.0?\
    \ (iv) What are the main types of network\nintrusions in WSN and IoT systems?\
    \ (v) What are the main network security attacks in\nWSN and IoT? (vi) What are\
    \ the major issues in IoT and WSN systems? (vii) What are\nthe limitations and\
    \ research gaps in the current work? The main purpose of the fourth\nindustrial\
    \ revolution with WSN and IoT explicitly shows that the evolutionary transition\n\
    needs to be intensiﬁed and extended to include emerging research areas and intimidating\n\
    technological challenges. This article covers all elements of WSN, from the design\
    \ phase\nto the security requirements, from the implementation phase to the classiﬁcation\
    \ of the\nnetwork, and from the difﬁculties and challenges of WSN. Future studies\
    \ will address\nthe problems in the coverage regions of wireless sensor networks\
    \ and provide effective\nsolutions to the existing problems and challenges in\
    \ this area. The use and application of\nWSN and IoT in Industry 4.0 involves\
    \ the processing of extracted data and the efﬁcient and\nsecure transmission of\
    \ this data to a remote location.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, M.M.,\

    Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Footnotes Abstract: The advancement
    of technologies over years has poised Internet of Things (IoT) to scoop out untapped
    information and communication technology opportunities. It is anticipated that
    IoT will handle the gigantic network of billions of devices to deliver plenty
    of smart services to the users. Undoubtedly, this will make our life more resourceful
    but at the cost of high energy consumption and carbon footprint. Consequently,
    there is a high demand for green communication to reduce energy consumption, which
    requires optimal resource availability and controlled power levels. In contrast
    to this, IoT devices are constrained in terms of resources-memory, power, and
    computation. Low power wide area (LPWA) technology is a response to the need for
    efficient utilization of power resource, as it evinces characteristics such as
    the capability to proffer low power connectivity to a huge number of devices spread
    over wide geographical areas at low cost. Various LPWA technologies, such as LoRa
    and SigFox, exist in the market, offering a proficient solution to the users.
    However, in order to abstain the need of new infrastructure (like base station)
    that is required for proprietary technologies, a new cellular-based licensed technology,
    narrowband IoT (NBIoT), is introduced by 3GPP in Rel-13. This technology presents
    a good candidature to handle LPWA market because of its characteristics like enhanced
    indoor coverage, low power consumption, latency insensitivity, and massive connection
    support towards NBIoT. This survey presents a profound view of IoT and NBIoT,
    subsuming their technical features, resource allocation, and energy-efficiency
    techniques and applications. The challenges that hinder the NBIoT path to success
    are also identified and discussed. In this paper, two novel energy-efficient techniques
    “zonal thermal pattern analysis” and energy-efficient adaptive health monitoring
    system have been proposed towards green IoT. Topic: Towards Service-Centric Internet

    I. Introduction 5G is on the purview where IoT will seize the stage spotlight,
    as IoT devices would form a notable segment of the 5G network. The radical evolution
    of the current Internet into a network of interconnected objects harvest information
    from the environment and interact with the physical world. The mammoth interest
    of connecting sensors, actuators, meters cars, appliances, and so on with internet,
    results in the Internet of Things [1], [2]. According to IEA-4E (Electronic device
    and network annex), the number of network connected devices will be 50 billion
    by 2020 [3]. Thus enterprises ushers into the modern era of automation to evidently
    change our daily lives by providing solution related to multiple sectors of health,
    agriculture, retail, vehicular, industry, power grid, underwater, buildings, homes,
    environment, transportation, smart home [4]. By 2024 itself, it is expected that
    the IoT industry will generate a revenue of USD4.3 billion [5] and it’s expected
    to grow over years. However, deployment of gigantic IoT ecosystem brings in various
    challenges to handle such as cost-efficient robust and flexible connectivity,
    interoperability of heterogeneous hardware, diverse security mechanism [6], and
    long battery life. However, the major deployment obstruction is due to constrained
    resources availability for IoT devices i.e. limited energy, limited computation,
    and limited processing capabilities [7]. Most importantly the flavor of IoT gets
    bitter, especially due to limited energy as this leads to unanticipated human
    intervention. Hence the burning issue of efficient utilization of energy is getting
    anomalous traction from academics and industry. In literature, various techniques
    have been proposed to tackle this critical issue such as energy harvesting, sporadic
    transmission, resource allocation, clustering, etc. Ju and Zhang [8] suggested
    the technique of predictive analysis with energy harvesting to obsolete the battery
    from IoT device. Na et al. [9] suggested a technique to charge the device wirelessly
    using RF. Further, a power-aware connectivity using Spanning tree algorithm is
    suggested by Karthikeya et al. [10]. Shafiee et al. [11] designed a circuit to
    manage the power of the device where a source of energy is ambient. Another crucial
    challenge is to handle the diverse requirement of wide range of IoT applications.
    Today there are two evident classes of IoT applications: Critical IoT and Massive
    IoT. Critical IoT applications such as autonomous driving or remote surgery require
    very low latency with ultra-high reliability. Massive IoT (M-IoT) applications
    like smart building, logistics, tracking and fleet management, smart agriculture,
    etc. require low cost device with reduced complexity that consumes low power,
    wide coverage including uncovered areas and performance flexibility to handle
    multiple application with different latency and throughput requirement. According
    to current statics, low data rate (<100kbps) applications i.e. M-IoT, are expected
    to form 60% of IoT connections in 2020 in comparison to medium and high data rate
    applications [12]. Hence most of the traffic will originate from cost-effective
    low-bit-rate services that will serve the connected world. Since massive communication
    between various low power IoT devices is different from H2H (Human-to-Human) in
    terms of delay sensitivity and traffic pattern, thus could not be supported by
    cellular technologies adequately. As they are designed for the different category
    of terminal that operates at a high data rate and consumes high power their device
    complexity is also high and thereby their cost, though it will aid in deployment
    of IoT. Apart from this, technologies such as Wi-Fi, BLE, ZigBee, etc., offer
    short range communications though consume less power. However, if deployed repeatedly
    will increase the cost. Hence not a cost effective solution for applications with
    wide coverage range requirements like M-IoT. Thus a technology is required that
    could support massive connection at reduced cost with low power consumption &
    provide enhanced coverage [13]. LPWAN technologies are one that could support
    this emerging market as it allows low power device to communicate at low data
    rate over wide area with radius of several kilometers. LPWA proffers abilities
    like Indoor penetration: as it uses Sub-1GHz band, the signal propagates more
    reliably with less power consumption as compared to 2.4GHz signal. Low power consumption
    is achieved at a cost of low data rate and latency on the higher end in seconds
    or minutes. This ability is achieved by using Duty cycling, by using star topology
    (usually), by allowing devices to directly connect to BS (thereby bifurcating
    the need of gateway & relays also) or by reducing burden on the device side(by
    using Fog or edge Computing). Further for Low cost, CAPEX (capital expenditure)
    & OPEX (operational expenditure) is reduced by reducing the complexity of hardware,
    implanting less no of BS (LPWA BS) etc. Massive connections, QoS are two abilities
    where still improvement is required. Standard bodies like ETSI, 3GPP, IEEE, IETF
    are actively working on LPWA technologies. A range of applications such as precision
    monitoring, Smart City, Home Automation, Industrial Asset monitoring, Logistics,
    Wildlife Monitoring, Smart meter, is being catered by LPWA technologies. As the
    LPWA market is expected to rule the market in coming years, hence competition
    among LPWA technologies becoming severe. Recently to improve the foundation of
    IoT through cellular networks, and tussle with existing proprietary LPWA technologies
    (LoRa, SigFox, RPMA, etc.), 3GPP has introduced three technologies in Rel-13 namely
    eMTC (enhanced Machine Type Communication), NB-IoT, EC-GSM (enhanced coverage
    GSM). These cellular technologies will operate in licensed spectrum and will reuse
    the existing LTE infrastructure. Among available connecting technologies, NBIoT
    specifically tailored for emerging M-IoT market is one of the promising massive
    LPWA technology for data perception and acquisition for low data rate applications.
    NBIoT could handle massive connections with low power consumption and provide
    wide area coverage with deep indoor penetration and nomadic mobility [14]–[16].
    Most outstandingly it offers reliable service by using licensed bands and avoid
    congestion problems. NB-IoT reduced the hardware complexity by 90% compared in
    comparison of LTE Cat-1. Moreover, NBIoT can coexist with existing GSM and LTE
    network, hence reduce deployment cost also. Beside this new RAT (Radio Access
    Technology) reduced the signaling required for the transmission of data in the
    conventional system. Altogether NB-IoT can reduce the cost and energy consumption,
    which are the chief limitations of cellular network technology for IoT devices.
    The present communication contributes toward the Next generation Green-NBIoT and
    delivers a comprehensive enriched study of NBIoT. This extensive survey elaborates
    resource allocation and energy efficiency techniques. Along with this a detailed
    comparative analysis of IoT connecting technology with NBIoT is also presented.
    Further, two novel application specific energy efficient approaches are also proposed
    namely “Zonal Thermal pattern Analysis” (ZTPA) and “Energy Efficiency Adaptive
    Health Monitoring System” (E2AHMS). Along with this real time hardware implementation
    of Health application is given to support the proposed energy efficient approach.
    This paper would be beneficial for researchers to get an insight view of NBIoT
    and their respective challenges. A. Market Trends Toward NBIoT IoT market growth
    has accelerated across all verticals in Q1 2018. Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN)
    is seen as one of the enablers for IoT. IoT Analytics in their report quoted that
    LPWA connections will have a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 81% during
    2018–2025 [17]. According to Machina in comparison of other LPWAN the share of
    NBIoT alone would be 48% by 2025 (Fig. 1) [18]. According to another statics,
    suggest by IHC the number of NBIoT connections by 2021 will be 141.7 million [19].
    Thereby NBIoT module revenue worldwide might touch the figure of USD 824 million
    by 2020 itself. Out of all NBIoT connections 88% of NBIoT connections will be
    established in Asia itself [20]. Some of the key NBIoT players are Huawei (China),
    Intel (U.S), Ericsson (Sweden), Deutsche Telekom (Germany), Qualcomm (U.S), Vodafone
    (U.K). The growth of NB-IoT standard has increased pressure on proprietary technologies
    especially for LoRaWan and the fact of no of chips shipped in 2017: 2% of SigFox,
    4 % of LTE-M, LoRaWan 58%, LTE-Cat M1 4%, NBIoT 29%, Other 7% [18], are forestalling
    the market drift is building toward NBIoT. FIGURE 1. LPWA technology share by
    2025, machina, 2017 [18]. Show All B. Research Motivation As per literature survey
    and research availability in the area of IoT, a lot of work has been done to deliver
    services like smart health, smart agriculture, smart vehicle, etc. In the current
    scenario, IoT has become the first choice of industry, research and academia.
    However, there exist big gap similar to WSN i.e. energy optimization, energy efficient
    network which acts as a big stumbling block for IoT network. This becomes even
    more challenging as IoT devices have limited resource availability. This motivated
    us to study resource allocation techniques in detail. Furthermore, implementation
    of IoT on a massive scale would inflate carbon emissions in one way or the other.
    Hence to envision the green communication energy efficiency techniques will play
    an important role. Apart from this to cater the new specificities of IoT (i.e.
    low cost devices, wide coverage, long battery life, massive connection support)
    in cost effective way, NBIoT (3GPP standardized LPWA technology) presents good
    candidature. In this paper with an effort toward green IoT, two energy efficiency
    techniques using NBIoT are also proposed related to two specific area Health &
    Agriculture which directly or indirectly impact the human being. C. Contribution
    This review paper contributes toward next generation green communication and in
    support of that two novel energy efficient techniques namely “ZTPA” & “E2AHMS”.
    This review paper will be beneficial for researchers, who want to get a profound
    view of NBIoT. Whilst discussing the recent background of NBIoT, significant challenges
    and open issues related to the real time implementation of NBIoT are identified
    and discussed. In this manuscript, a detailed study related to resource allocation,
    and energy efficiency techniques for both IoT and NBIoT is done. Our main contributions
    can be summarized as follow: The Layered Architecture of IoT is presented to specify
    How IoT works. In addition to this a detailed comparative analysis of NBIoT with
    other low power IoT communication technologies is discussed. To provide an insight
    view of NB-IoT, its background research, architecture, frame structure, physical
    channels, connection process (cell acquisition, random access process, data transfer),
    modes of operation, power consumption using NBIoT, and its applications are discussed
    in detail. The paucity of the resource is not a new challenge for the communication
    network. However, it quite challenging for IoT being so massively interconnected.
    Thus a detailed analysis of resource allocation techniques is discussed related
    to IoT and NBIoT The open issues related NBIoT implementation are then conferred
    The real time implementation of IoT will inflate the CO2 levels in environment
    in different ways which can be controlled by many ways one of it is efficient
    utilization of energy resource. Therefore a literature survey of an energy efficient
    techniques used for IoT are deliberated and role of deep learning in the context
    of power consumption is also discussed. The open issues relate to NBIoT are then
    conferred. Thereafter, Green communication based energy efficient techniques are
    proposed for Smart Agriculture and Smart Health. In addition to this, hardware
    implementation is given to support the proposed energy efficient Smart Health
    technique. The list of ongoing IoT projects is presented to provide the researchers
    and readers the knowledge of current applications being developed. In addition
    to this, a list of simulation tools used is also presented in the appendix section.
    D. Organization This paper is organized as follows. Section II briefly discusses
    the basic layered architecture of IoT and specifies the layer on which NBIoT operates.
    Hereafter comparison of NBIoT with other IoT connecting technologies is discussed
    in section III. Thereafter, NBIoT introduction, background research, standardization
    history from Rel-8 to Rel-15, subsequently architecture, frame structure, physical
    channels and signals used, connection process, modes of operation, power consumption
    using NBIoT, applications of NBIoT, are described in subsections IV-A, IV-B, IV-C,
    IV-D, IV-E, IV-F, IV-G, IV-H, IV-I respectively. Further section V provides a
    comprehensive survey of efficient resource allocation techniques used for NBIoT
    & IoT. Thereafter an overview of energy consumption in a sensor node during different
    phases is presented in section VI. Other than this, a detailed survey of energy
    efficiency techniques for green communication are discussed in detail in section
    VI-A and then the impact of usage of deep learning on power consumption is discussed
    in section-VI-B. Then the open issues related to NBIoT are discussed in section
    VII. Finally, the proposed green communication based energy efficient technique
    for agriculture is discussed in section VIII-A, and for health monitoring is discussed
    in VIII-B. In support of the proposed health technique a real time hardware implementation
    is described in section VIII-C subsuming system model (VIII-C-i), hardware requirement
    (VIII-C-ii), interface (VIII-C-iii), and performance analysis (VIII-C-iv). SECTION
    II. Internet of Things Communication and sensing ability has evolved gradually
    due to advancement in technology. The evolution of IoT (Fig. 2) started with RFID
    (radio frequency identification), which is the first technology to realize the
    machine to machine concept. RFID detects and ascertains the tagged entity wirelessly,
    by the data it transmits. Recently RFID is used in numerous IoT applications such
    as gestural detection [21], patient RFID tracking system [22], and smart restaurant.
    RFID could not sense the critical environment parameters, this stems in the requirement
    of sensing technologies. Hereafter, several technical fields including embedded
    computing, hardware miniaturization, Wireless networking aids in augmentation
    of real-world things capability, to sense, think, process and act, thus making
    things smart. Usually, these smart things have low computation capability thus
    clouds are used to offload the computational task which in turn reduce the energy
    consumption. Today the integration of. RFID, WSN, MCC (mobile cloud computing)
    and advancement in technology generated the umbrella term IoT. This concept is
    significantly revolutionizing the technical and business world, as it can offers
    anytime, anywhere, and anything service. The term IoT was first coined by Kevin
    Aston in 1999 also known as “cyber-physical systems (CPS)” [24]. In this paradigm,
    object/things around us are connected to the internet using Wireless technologies
    like Bluetooth, ZigBee, etc. Many definitions of IoT have been proposed in the
    literature. According to IERC, IoT is “A dynamic global infrastructure with self-configuring
    capabilities based on standard and interoperable communication protocol where
    physical and virtual things have identities, physical attributes, virtual personalities,
    and use intelligent interface and seamlessly integrated into information network”
    [25]. IoT network, comprised of billions of devices is highly heterogeneous. Its
    essence of heterogeneity can be visualized by the fact that devices from different
    vendors would run with diverse platforms even if they’re doing the same task as
    a result will generate radically different ontologies. Thus for IoT to speak a
    common language a unified standardized IoT architecture is required to ensure
    interoperability and security. Many architectural layouts have been proposed for
    IoT but no one has converged to a standardized architecture. Some of the well-known
    IoT architecture such as RAMI 4.0, IIRA, IoT- ARM, P2413, Arrowhead Framework,
    WSO2, Microsoft Azure, Internet-of-everything reference Model, Intel IoT Platform
    Reference Architecture are available. Among variously available architecture this
    paper presents a five-layer architecture (Fig. 3): comprised of Perception Layer,
    network layer, Service management Layer, Application Layer, Business layer [1].
    Perception Layer: This layer is composed of sensor/actuators. Here sensors are
    clustered according to their unique abilities such as body sensors, environmental
    sensors, vehicle parking sensors, home appliance sensors etc. Typically these
    sensors at the perception layer generate electronic signals triggered from physical
    event/condition aggregated at gateways using LAN/PAN technologies like Wi-Fi,
    Ethernet, UWB, ZigBee, BLE, Infrared, etc. FIGURE 2. Roadmap of IoT [2]. Show
    All FIGURE 3. Layered architecture of IoT [23]. Show All Network Layer: This layer
    is responsible to send the PL information to the Internet via one of the communication
    networks such as LAN (WIFI, Ethernet), WAN (3G, LTE, LTE-A, 5G) or satellite network.
    Service Management Layer (SML): On SML services are paired based on addresses
    and it also processes the data received. These services are OSS (Operational Support
    System) which include device modeling, Performance management, Data management
    (periodic/Aperiodic sensed data) etc. (e.g. Nokia OSS which help in generating
    new revenues by handling high capacity.), BSS (Billing Support System) this provide
    billing report, and Security Services. Application Layer: Here application layer
    is classified based on the availability of network, required coverage, heterogeneity,
    etc. Using protocols like MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport), CoAP (Constrained
    Application Protocol) this layer provides the requested service to the user. Business
    Layer: This layer is responsible to analyze data received from the Application
    layer by building the business model, flowcharts, graphs, etc. thereby enable
    to support decision-making processes. Thus IoT flow can be defined as first identification
    (to provide clear identification to each device), then sensing gather data from
    the physical environment), thereafter communication, then integration of service
    and finally extraction of knowledge. The new IoT specificities like low power
    and Wide Range, Low deployment and Operational Costs, Long Battery life (10mA
    RX current, 100nA sleep current), Low bitrates, are different from conventional
    networks in many aspects and brings in many challenges. Beside this massive connectivity
    will further aggravate the problem. However, a solution is appearing on the horizon:
    is 3GPP, NB-IoT which can cater these requirements in an effective manner. As
    IoT has a diverse and wide range of IoT requirement, hence one solution won’t
    fit for all. Therefore in the next section a detail comparative analysis of NBIoT
    and other IoT related technologies is discussed. SECTION III. Comparison of NBIot
    With Other IoT Connecting Technologies A myriad of IoT connectivity solutions
    is available to support a wide range of IoT application with miscellaneous requirements.
    Therefore to select an optimal technology for an application various factors such
    as power consumption, security issues, deployment cost, communication range, data
    rate, throughput, latency are required to be considered [26], [27]. A comparison
    of IoT connecting solutions on pre-specified factor is given in Table 1. Connecting
    Technologies of IoT can be coarsely classified into two categories based on their
    range i.e. short and long range. Wireless technologies such as BLE, ZigBee, Wi-Fi,
    Z-wave, WIMAX, 6LOWPAN, etc. offer short range can be used for applications like
    smart home, factory or supermarket. Whereas, LPWAN technologies such as LoRa,
    SigFox, NBIoT, EC-GSM-IOT, etc. offer long range. Other than the pre-specified
    competing technologies RPMA, Telensa, WAVIoT and Dash 7 are few other competing
    technologies contributing to IoT connectivity [28]. TABLE 1 Comparison of IoT
    Connecting Technologies Among wireless technologies, Wi-Fi uses radio waves for
    communication and operates in either 2.4GHz or 5GHz band. The existing Wi-Fi standards
    802.11 a/b/g/n/ac has constraints in both range and energy efficiency, thus can’t
    be considered apposite for applications with low power consumption requisite.
    Thus IEEE has introduced two new protocols 802.11ah and 802.11ax that can support
    thousands of devices with low power consumption. These two are considered to be
    the biggest move of IEEE towards the massive IoT market. The Wi-Fi standard 802.11ah–HaLow
    provide a range of 1km and can easily penetrate barriers/obstacles at data rate
    ranging from 150kbps to 40Mbps. The 802.11ax solution will provide four time’s
    increased capacity and data rate and improved efficiency. These new solutions
    have great potential to capture the M2M market. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is
    another Wireless standard that offers much needed characteristic required for
    most of IoT applications i.e. consumes low power, low cost, but within a short
    range. BLE allows both connectionless and connection-oriented communication. It
    fragments the data into small packets then transmit them over the radio interface.
    This enables BLE to support data services with large packets. It is used in applications
    like wearables, for locating things, etc. Further ZigBee is a simple and low cost
    Wireless option that consumes low power. It is based on IEEE 802 std. and could
    support ~ 65000 nodes/network. Its range can be extended by using repeaters in
    the mesh topology, but this will increase the deployment cost [29]. ZigBee 3.0
    is the new solution introduces, it ensures device interoperability, it is reliable
    robust and above all it is green. Z-Wave is another pioneer for short range communication,
    especially for home-automation industry. As it provides a reliable method to wirelessly
    control multiple home appliances using low-power. Z-Wave operates in the sub-gigahertz
    frequency range, around 900MHz. It can support up to approximately 232 nodes/network.
    The Frequently Listening receiver Slave (FLiRs) enable low latency communication
    by employing unique beaming technology so that device can transit from sleep to
    fully awake modes in one second. Hence suitable for short range IoT application.
    Z-Wave 700 Series, could offer a range of 300 feet, hence can connect gadgets
    placed outside the home and far off into the yard, too [30]. Despite offering
    low power consumption and low cost, Wireless technologies limits in supporting
    long distance communication. Hence offers limited mobility and deployment possibilities
    for the device. Moreover, to extend the range, repeaters are required to be deployed
    densely, thus extortionately expensive. Whereas, LPWA technologies offer mass
    deployment, long range, long battery life, and require low bandwidth. Hence LPWA
    fills a cavity in the landscape of Wireless technologies. LPWAN technologies can
    be categorized into two categories Licensed and Unlicensed. Long Range (LoRa),
    SigFox, RPMA, N-Wave and Dash 7 are unlicensed, NBIoT, EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M are licensed
    technologies [31], [32]. LoRa is developed by Semtech, to deploy its network it
    is required to get a NetID issued from LoRa Alliance. It uses an Adaptive Data
    Rate (ADR) scheme which helps in extending the battery lifetime. It is based on
    Chirp Spread Spectrum modulation technique, which sustains the same low power
    characteristics as FSK modulation yet considerably increases the communication
    range. LoRa-WAN being asynchronous let devices to remain in sleep mode for a long
    time period as desired by the application. Another advantage of LoRa is its BS
    provide wide coverage. However, as LoRa operates in unlicensed spectrum thus could
    not provide QoS and neither it could support dense network as it employs MAC based
    ALOHA protocol [33]. SigFox is another technology that operates in unlicensed
    sub 1GHz band. It operates on cloud based approach and uses ALOHA like LoRa but
    with a restriction on the maximum number of messages, a device could send. The
    prime advantage of SigFox is it doesn’t spend energy on sensing medium thus saves
    energy. SigFox requires the user to purchase subscription. In order to provide
    long range communication it uses Ultra-Narrow-band modulation and transfers each
    message 100 Hz wide with a data rate of 100/600 bps depending on the region. Ingenu
    is another LPWAN technology offers high throughput, high scalability, and use
    patented Random Phase Multiple Access scheme. RPMA helps in improving SNR by minimizing
    the overlapping between signals transmitted. It is slightly more complex as it
    uses TDMA based MAC protocol to efficiently allocate the radio resource [34].
    Another LPWAN technology WEIGHTLESS-P, uses cognitive radio and TV white-spaces,
    such that devices utilize the bands as an opportunistic user without causing interference
    to the primary user. It supports two way communication thereby acknowledges all
    transmissions, further in order to maintain QoS and to assure reliability Automatic
    retransmission request (ARQ) and Forward Error Correction (FEC) is used [36].
    Taking about existing cellular technology LTE could not provide solutions for
    M-IoT applications i.e. Low power consumption, low data rates, and wider coverage
    at low cost. Thus 3GPP proposed a licensed LTE-M / eMTC, in Rel-12 to cater the
    requirements of machine type communication which has been optimized in Rel-13.
    It leverages the existing LTE network and follows narrowband operation for reception
    and transmission and provides extended coverage. To reduce power consumption it
    used PSM (power saving mode) and edRx mode [37]. NBIoT (Narrow Band IoT), is another
    licensed technology introduced by 3GPP in Rel-13. NB-IoT in comparison to other
    technologies offer mMTC required features at low cost like (i) provide coverage
    in challenging positions like underground or basements; (ii) improved power saving
    mechanisms to enhance the battery life; (iii) network procedures are simplified
    to reduce the UE complexity. Apart from this to support small data transfer it
    has optimized CIoT User Plane and Control Plane Another technology EC-GSM is also
    proposed by 3GPP which is an extension of existing GSM technology. Suitable for
    many applications, but it overburdens the device and network [38]. Conclusion:
    For M-IoT applications, individually all LPWAN technologies are prompt in one
    way or the other for wide range solutions but picking a clear winner is critical.
    LoRa, SigFox being proprietary technology has an established market and giving
    a tough fight to 3GPP NBIoT, EC-GSM-IoT and others also. However proprietary technologies
    operate in Unauthorized/Unlicensed Spectrum that suffers from Duty Cycle constraint.
    Thus affects the transmission time and also bears high interference as spectrum
    is shared between multiple technologies. Whereas, NBIoT operate in licensed spectrum
    and can support massive connections, operates at low data rates (but better than
    LoRa), offer wide coverage with deep indoor penetration, perform well in dense
    area, consumes less power in comparison to LoRa, & SigFox, offers very good link
    budgets and good scalability, provide QoS Apart from this just require a software
    update to LTE or existing RAN infrastructure. Thus ready to immediate role out
    in the market. This is essential for reducing deployment cost and time [39], [40].
    Hence this ascertains that NBIoT has the ability to capture the IoT-LPWAN market
    specifically in comparison to other LPWAN Technologies SECTION IV. NBIoT: Narrow
    Band Internet of Things NB-IoT is the latest technology that is identified and
    standardized in a little time span, in the response of customer requirement and
    pressure to tussle with non-3GPP proprietary technologies. NBIoT can efficiently
    support the market of the M-IoT application. This an independent radio interface,
    tightly connected with LTE, which also shows up in its integration in the current
    LTE specifications [12], [13], [41], [42]. It can address the needs of mMTC (massive
    Machine Type Communication) by following features (Fig. 4): FIGURE 4. NBIoT features.
    Show All NBIoT can support massive connections (more than 52K/channel): as in
    MTC communication model user, transfer small data at low frequency and are insensitive
    to latency so multiple users can camp on one cell. Further, NBIoT supports two
    schemes multi-tone and single-tone transmission. This offers flexibility to schedule
    12 subcarriers with sub spacing of 15 kHz or 48 subcarriers with sub spacing of
    3.75 kHz with single tone scheduling. Hence eNodeB could support large no of users
    in parallel. NBIoT uses a bandwidth of 180 KHz and operates in HD-FDD: In NBIoT,
    UL/DL bandwidth is restricted to 180 kHz. Hence less complex transceiver is used.
    Further, the device operates in Half Duplex mode, thus can’t receive and transmit
    simultaneously. This further decrease device cost, as no duplexer will be required.
    NBIoT design objective is to provide prolonged battery life: For long battery
    life, power Consumption is reduced by using eDRX (extended discontinuous reception)
    and PSM (power saving modes) features. In extended discontinuous reception, the
    UE monitors the paging channel periodically. Whereas in PSM, the device remains
    in receiving state. NBIoT provides extend coverage range of 20dB as compare to
    GPRS (especially deep indoor penetration): To provide the wide coverage the transport
    block can be transmitted multiple times i.e. 128 times in UL and 2048 in DL. Hence
    improves Signal to noise-interference ratio (SINR) and enable proper decoding
    of the signal. To determine the number of repetitions for coverage extensions,
    three classes are defined CE level 0, CE level 1 and CE level 2. For each of these
    class, the number of repetitions is regulated separately. Beside this soft retransmission
    the network bandwidth is also reduced. Hence based on two features 20 dB coverage
    enhancement is achieved where ~7dB is achieved from network bandwidth reduction
    and ~13 dB from allowed repeated transmissions. NBIoT offers operating mode flexibility:
    In order to coexist with LTE and 2G, three deployment modes are available standalone,
    in-band and standalone. NBIoT doesn’t support higher modulation scheme than QPSK,
    thus keep device complexity low and thereby cost. Moreover, to keep the PAPR (peak
    to average power ratio) low in UL, π /2-BPSK, π /4- QPSK is used. NBIoT supports
    Low-Data-Rate applications, which obsolete the requirement for high-capacity flash
    memory hence reduce the chip area and thereby the cost of devices. NBIoT operates
    in Licensed Band and can provide telecommunication level of security. NBIoT achieved
    signaling optimization: In addition to existing RRC, NBIoT uses DONAS (data over
    non access stratum) and RRC (radio resource control) suspend/resume for signaling
    optimization. Where DONAS enable the user to transmit data without activating
    a user plane and support sporadic data transmissions also. The RRC suspend/resume
    is a user plane optimization procedure that introduced an efficient way to disable
    and restore the user plane. Further, NB-IoT is designed for sporadic and small
    messages transmission among the device and the network. It is presumed that the
    device can exchange small messages via one cell, therefore obsolete the requirement
    of handoffs. However, if required then it needs to first go in idle state and
    then restart the cell selection process. Besides this, it doesn’t support other
    EUTRA functions like Inter-RAT-mobility, handover, dual connectivity, CQI (Channel
    Quality Indicator) reporting. A. Background of NBIoT NBIoT is in the initial state
    of deployment, still, there is room for optimization. The miscellaneous work carried
    out in the context of NBIoT optimization is discussed in this section. Song et
    al. [43] proposed an indoor localization algorithm for NB-IoT system using Channel
    state information (CSI) fingerprinting. The proposed algorithm will estimate the
    position with less complexity by observing the similarity between two CSI values
    and then convert the similar value to a relative value. To improve estimation
    of position, triangular centroid algorithm and K nearest neighbor is used. As
    a result, the position error was reduced in comparison to existing techniques.
    Further, to enable a node, in an idle state to transmit the data. Lin et al. [44]
    proposed an efficient SDT (Smallest Data Transmission) technique to increase the
    number of the supportable device. In this eNB will broadcast the maximum SDT size
    in SIB (system information block), and also a group of SDT ids with it. Thereafter,
    UE will check the SDT value and determine whether to use this technique or not.
    If suitable then send the RA response. Successively, eNB will acknowledge by sending
    RA response comprised of uplink resource grant. UE on successful reception will
    send the PDU and starts the timer. Upon receiving the response within time, UE
    compares its id with group ids. As a result, authors found that more devices could
    be supported in comparison of conventional control plane solutions, whilst using
    limited uplink resources. However massive connection results in the high probability
    of collision thus Kim et al. [45] proposed an enhanced Access- Reservation-Protocol
    (EARP) with a partial preamble transmission mechanism. The proposed protocol although
    reduced the collision probability but at the cost of abdication of the detection
    ability. Authors found that EARP would results in effective resource utilization
    in reference to system load. When the load will be less then it will reduces the
    probability of misdetection. On the other hand, when a heavy load would be there,
    the collision probability gets reduced although the detection probability get
    deteriorates. Further Zhang et al. [46] done an analysis of interference caused
    by the NBIoT user equipment to that of LTE users. Authors considered only in-band
    and guard band for analysis and proposed an algorithm for removal of ISI or channel
    equalization. On the basis of observation, the authors stated that LTE-UE performance
    degrades due to the different sampling rate of NBIoT user. In addition to this,
    the level of interference depends upon specifically two important factors. First
    due to attenuation of power and second is due to guard band. A critical observation
    about bit error rate is made for an LTE device i.e. its BER will improve as guard-band
    bandwidth increases although for IoT devices BER remains unaffected. Liu et al.
    [47] taking the same issue of interference between NBIoT and LTE devices have
    proposed a framework based on Block Sparse Bayesian Learning (BSBL) and two algorithms
    for recovery of signals. Authors observed that by canceling the interfering NB-IoT
    signal, LTE device could operate more effectively. Further, Lin et al. [48] proposed
    a single tone design for NPRACH (narrowband physical random access channel) and
    this work was integrated into 3GPP Rel-13. To reduce the overhead due to cyclic
    prefix (CP) N-samples are repeated n times and then collectively CP corresponding
    to these samples is added, as a result, the length of CP got reduced. After this
    single carrier hopping is used where within symbols fixed hopping is used and
    among different symbol groups, pseudo-random hopping is applied. Further, the
    time of arrival (ToA) & carrier frequency offset (CFO) is jointly estimated to
    determine the midsection and false alarm. As a result, the authors observed that
    using the proposed design the probability of detection increased up to 99% and
    the probability of false-alarm reduced immensely below 0.1%. Further, Yang et
    al. [49] suggested using effective bandwidth (EB) to collectively handle all the
    components of LPWAN i.e. battery life, coverage, Tx (transmission) bandwidth,
    spectral efficiency. According to the suggested, concept if Tx bandwidth would
    be greater than EB, this would ultimately reduce the system capacity. On the other
    hand, if Tx would be less than EB, this would entail more Tx time. However, the
    journey of optimization doesn’t end here. There are various open issues that are
    still required to be addressed to envisage NBIoT success. Some of them are discussed
    in section VII. B. History of Standardization Before standardization, of NBIoT.
    It was proposed in two formats. NBIoT-OFDMA and NBIoT-M2M in 2014. Where QUALCOMM
    offered NBIoT-OFDMA & Huawei and Vodafone collectively offered NBIoT-M2M. These
    two formats were clubbed together to form NB-CIoT (NB cellular IoT), which require
    a new chipset and has no backward compatibility with previous LTE Rel (8-12).
    Further, another format NBIoT-LTE was proposed in 2015 which is fully compatible
    with existing LTE specifications. Then finally in 2016, 3GPP after agreeing on
    two proposals gave standardized technology NBIoT. This technology has evolved
    over years of improvement. In this section, the roadmap of standardization (from
    Rel-8 to 15) is discussed to determine the improvement made (in these Rel) to
    support MTC. Well standardization of LTE started in 2005 when 3GPP started depth
    research for MTC on CN. In 2009, Rel-8 was standardization [50] and brought in
    the feature like peak DL data rate of 300Mbps with an ability to operate in paired
    and unpaired frequency band. Thus have spectral flexibility with bandwidth ranging
    from 1.4 to 20 MHz A new IP based network was introduced i.e. LTE, was a significant
    step toward the IMT-A. In addition to this, to cater the need of multiple users,
    multiple antenna scenario came in to picture since the first Rel of 3GPP [51].
    However the basic requirement of low cost device and power issues left unattended.
    Thereafter Rel-9 standardized in 2010 in which LTE evolved to LTE-Advance and
    introduced additional features such as public warning system (PWS), location Identification
    service, SON (Self Organizing Network) feature to improve the network configuration,
    added new spectrum bands. Further in 2011 Rel-10 (also known as LTE-Advanced)
    was launched to extensively improve the throughput of the LTE system. For evaluation
    of Rel-10, it was submitted to ITU-R in 2010. In Rel-10, to enhance the bandwidth
    and bitrate, Carrier Aggregation was used for both TDD & FDD [52] and to reduce
    the interference, eICIC (enhanced Inter-Cell Interference Coordination) was added,
    where ABS (Almost Blank Subframes) is used to confine the data to the specific
    layer of the cell. Other features like eMIMO, etc. were also introduced. Further,
    Rel-11 [53] got frozen in 2013. An important feature CoMP (Co-ordinated Multi
    Point operation) was announced to facilitate the scheduling of multiple carriers.
    EPDCCH (Enhanced Physical Downlink Control Channel) was added to increase DLC
    (downlink-Capacity). Furthermore, Rel-12 [54], [55] got standardized in 2015.
    In this NAICS (Network Assisted Interference Cancellation and Suppression) was
    added to manage interference. To achieve QoE, naïve UE categories were introduced
    with 50% reduced cost in comparison to Rel-8, cat-1 devices. In support of machine
    type communication, PSM (power saving mode) was also introduced to conserve energy.
    Finally in Rel 13 [56], [57] to further cater the need of Machine to machine type
    communication, a new feature added to existing Rel-8-12: SCPTM (single cell point
    to multi-point), indoor-positioning, reduced latency, Dual connectivity and enhanced
    CA. LAA (licensed assisted access) was also introduced to allow operators to offload
    traffic to the femtocell, devoid of WLAN Two naïve category of devices were introduced
    in Rel 13 Cat-M1 (eMTC) and Cat-NB1 (NBIoT). Where the system bandwidth was confined
    to 1.4 MHz and coverage range was enhanced by 15 dB for Cat-M1 devices. Altogether
    reduced the device complexity and cost enabled operators to reach terminal devices
    in poor coverage range like in basements. For assurance of long battery life eDRX
    (extended Discontinuous Reception) feature was introduced that monitors the DL
    signals for only a short span of time otherwise keep the device in the sleep state.
    For the further evolution of LTE to support mMTC Rel-14 is also standardized with
    more technologies and improvement in existing features such as Additional Broadcast
    services, enhanced positioning, reduced latency, and massive multi antenna system.
    Currently, Rel-15 is under standardization process and expected to get standardize
    by September 2018 [56]. The expected features of Rel-15 are also enlisted in Table
    2. TABLE 2 Standardization History Toward NBIoT [12] C. NBIoT Network Architecture
    The architecture of NBIoT is shown in Fig. 5, NBIoT has simplified the EPC architecture
    to support the small data transmissions required for M-IoT applications in the
    form of User Plane and the Control Plane EPC optimization. FIGURE 5. NBIoT architecture
    [58]. Show All Here NB-IoT device or user equipment communicates with the eNodeB
    thereafter eNodeB connects with the IoT evolved packet core (EPC). This is comprised
    of entities: the Serving GW, the Packet Data Network GW, the Mobility management
    plane entity, the Home Subscriber server. After this eNodeB transfers the NAS
    (non-access stratum, a signaling message) to EPC using s1-lite (an optimized version
    of S1-Control-Plane and support efficient data handling). Basically, NAS is a
    protocol that transfers the non-radio signal between the user equipment and MME,
    which carries data for session and mobility management. Further to continue the
    processing EPC looks for stratum and then pass it to IoT platform. IoT platform
    forwards the data to application servers in supported form. This data is then
    processed by the Application server [58]. There are two ways in which data could
    be transmitted between NBIoT device and application server i.e. IP based and Non-IP
    based. However, Non-IP based is more endorsed since it reduces the overhead of
    user equipment and transmission is also more secure as only one target IP is supported.
    D. NBIoT Frame Structure Downlink: The frame structure of NBIoT DL is identical
    to LTE. In Time domain a radio frame is comprised of 10 Subframes, each having
    length of 1ms and each subframe consists of 2 slots with a time slot of seven
    OFDM symbols (Fig. 6 A) Here each OFDM symbol with in a frame is denoted by a
    number in the range 0 to 13. Further, the number of these radio frames is referred
    as the system frame number (SFN) which ranges from 0 to 1023. Once the SFN counter
    reaches the value of 1023, the counter is reset to 0 and thereafter the hyper
    SFN counter is increased. The hyper SFN ranges between 0 and 1023. Within each
    radio frame, the sub frames are labeled as 0 to 9 and the slots as 0 to 19. In
    Frequency domain, one physical resource block consists of 12 consecutive subcarriers
    with a spacing of 15 kHz [40]. FIGURE 6. Frame structure of NBIoT [59]. Show All
    Uplink: The UL resource grid has two subcarrier spacing options i.e.15 kHz and
    3.75 kHz. In time domain: with a subcarrier spacing of 15 kHz each slot has a
    duration of.5ms, the number of subcarriers will be 12 which is similar to the
    time domain. However, for the 3.75 kHz subcarrier spacing, total number of subcarriers
    in the frequency domain is 4 times i.e. 12*4=48 subcarriers. The slot duration
    will be of 2ms [40]. E. Physical Channels and Signals 1) Uplink Channels and Signals
    Since NBIoT enabled UE’s operates in extreme coverage areas and have limited power
    to operate. Pertaining to this, to reduce the power consumption and complexity
    UE is no longer asked to report a channel, thus their functionality reduced to
    send acknowledgment and No- acknowledgment. Apart from this the need of control
    channel is also obsoleted and only two UL channels are supported namely NPRACH,
    NPUSCH. a: NPRACH: Narrowband Physical Random-Access Channel NPRACH refers to
    the time frequency resource which occupies contiguous set of subcarriers either
    12, 24, 36 or 48 and used to transmit random access preambles. This preamble consist
    of four symbol groups, each group comprised of one Cycle Prefix (CP) and 5 symbols
    [48]. These preambles are repeated with a periodicity from 0.04 s to 2.56 s. The
    eNB uses the random access preamble sent by a user terminal to estimate the uplink
    timing. To start the random access process the preamble is transmitted with a
    duration of 5.6ms or 6.4ms. Further in order to support different cell size two
    CP lengths are specified in NPRACH, 66.67 μs and 266.7 μs . Where 66.67 μs is
    used for cells with radii not more than 8 km and 266.7 μs is used for cell with
    radii range of 8 – 35 km. Each symbol is modulated on a 3.75 kHz tone, which hops
    from one tone to another within twelve contiguous subcarriers. Further for efficient
    estimation of TOA (Time of Arrival) and to achieve improved synchronization between
    UE and eNB, frequency hopping is used. For this two layer hopping pattern is defined
    i.e. inner hopping & output hopping. In order to provide wide TOA range, inner
    hopping is used with fixed (for simplicity) and small values. However, an output
    hopping layer accounts to improve the accuracy of TOA estimation. Furthermore
    to alleviate cell interference between neighboring cells, the pseudo random hopping
    pattern is also used which has been inherited from the LTE PUSCH hopping. Finally
    to support coverage extension of +20dB GPRS, the preamble of four symbol groups
    can be repeated up to 128 times [59]. b: NPUSCH: Narrowband Physical Uplink Shared
    Channel The NPUSCH supports single tone transmission with either 3.75 kHz or 15
    kHz and multitone bandwidth using 15 kHz subcarrier spacing. The NPUSCH has two
    formats. Format 1 carries the actual data in the uplink with maximum transmission
    block size of 1000 bits. Format1 facilitate multitone transmission with 3,6,12
    tones. Other than this to decrease the PAPR (Peak to Average Power ratio the modulation
    scheme π /2-BPSK or π /4-QPSK is used for single-tone and QPSK is used for multi-tone
    for NPUSCH Format 1. Furthermore, Format 2 carries control information, supports
    single-tone transmission only and carries 1-bit UCI that corresponds to hybrid
    automatic repeat request (HARQ) feedback for NB-PDSCH transmission block. Table
    3 describes the format 1 and format 2. Typically the NPUSCH is designed to provide
    long battery life, massive capacity and extended coverage [14], [59]. TABLE 3
    NPUSCH Format [59] c: DMRS: Demodulation Reference Signal In LTE, DMRS is used
    to obtain channel response for PUSCH. Similar to enable eNB to estimate the UL
    channel, the NBIoT-UE transmits a demodulation reference signal (DMRS) which is
    multiplexed with the NPUSCH symbols. Thereby depending on Format of NPUSCH (ie.
    Format 1or Format 2), (Fig. 7) 1or 3 symbols per SC-FDMA slot are utilized to
    transmit the DMRS. With 15 kHz subcarrier spacing DMRS is allocated to symbol
    #3 of every 7 symbols and for 3.75 kHz subcarrier spacing. DMRS is allocated to
    5th symbol of every 7 symbols for data transmission [40]. FIGURE 7. DMRS allocation
    in 15 kHz &3.75 kHz subcarrier spacing [60]. Show All 2) Downlink Channels and
    Signals The NBIoT physical downlink channels are QPSK modulated. The downlink
    designs of NB-IoT MAC and PHY are analogous to the LTE. However, NB-IoT has fewer
    downlink physical channels as compared to LTE. For example, NBIoT doesn’t use
    PMCH (Physical Multicast Channel) as it doesn’t support multimedia broadcast/multicast
    services (till Rel-13) [61], [62]. a: DL Synchronization Signals The downlink
    synchronization signals allow a device to synchronize to NBIoT cell. However,
    the detection of these signals is a challenging task. As when a device with low-power
    oscillator wakes up after a long period of deep sleep, the time base will not
    have a valid reference then, and the frequency base perhaps off by as ~20 ppm.
    Hence a large offset may exist between the device and the network time and frequency,
    which will seriously harm the acquisition performance. The frequency offset is
    due to factors such as temperature, crystal aging, etc. Out of all “temperature”
    is the crucial factor that majorly affects the accuracy, and hence required to
    be compensated in real time. Depending on the quality of the crystal the offset
    ranges from ±5 ppm to ±100 ppm [63], [64]. Hence to detect with large frequency
    offset NBIoT new Synchronization signals NPSS (Narrowband Primary Synchronization
    Signal) is designed which is transmitted in Subframe 5 of duration 1 ms with a
    sequence pattern periodicity of 10 ms and subcarrier spaced at 15 kHz. The hierarchical
    sequence of NPSS is generated using (1) [65] P k (l)=Q(k) e −jπul(l+1)/ 11 , (1)
    View Source Where Q(k)= {1, 1, 1, 1,−1,−1, 1, 1,−1, 1} is the modulation sequence,
    1≤l≤11 (length), 3≤k≤14 (OFDM symbols) and u=5 is the root sequence. Its detection
    is a demanding computational operation from UE perspective. This detection may
    account for at least 24% of the power consumption. However, to keep the device
    complexity low, devices are required to search for only one NPSS as all the cells
    use the same NPSS in NB-IoT network. In contrast to this LTE network uses three
    PSSs. Although, in order to get one copy of NPSS, 19,200 samples need to be captured
    with a sub-frame of the length of 10 ms, with 1.92 MHz sampling rate. Hereafter
    to ascertain the cell identity out of 504 cell-ids available and to acquire additional
    information about the frame structure NSSS (Narrowband Secondary Synchronization
    Signal) is used. It is transmitted in subframe 9 with a subframe periodicity of
    20ms. Hence NSSS sequences are transmitted four times in 80-ms repetition interval
    are differentiated by the phase shift. It uses the last 11 OFDM symbols that consist
    of 132 resource elements overall. Unlike legacy LTE, cell ID is enclosed in the
    secondary sequence without including the primary sequence. NSSS, ZC 131 (Zadoff-Chu
    sequence) is constructed to indicate cell-ids [65] R(m)= b q (n) e −j2π θ f m
    e −j π μm ′ ( m ′ +1) 131 (2) View Source Where AbbreviationExpansion m = 0,1,…..,131

    ID 126 ⌋ , is cell specific parameter θ f = 31 132 ( n f / 2)mod4 , the cyclic
    shift, here n f is SFN, b q , binary scrambling sequence of 128-bits which is
    obtained based on length-128 WalsheHadamard. Hereafter NSSS is mapped to in radio
    frames having n f mod2=0 . b: Physical Channels i) NBPBCH: Narrow-Band Physical
    Broadcast Channel NB-PBCH reside in subframe 0 in every radio frame and carries
    the MIB (Master Information Block). It provide information about system bandwidth,
    SFN (system Frame Number), No of antenna ports. NB-PBCH, MIB consists of 8 independently
    decodable blocks of each of 80 ms duration. Where each block is repeated 8 times
    consecutively to manage with extreme coverage conditions. Hence MIB remains unchanged
    for the time span of 640 ms (Fig. 9). The NB-IOT determines the number of cell
    antenna ports whilst demodulating MIB information. Other than this MIB also provide
    information about operation mode. NB-PBCH reuses the functionalities from legacy
    LTE PBCH such as CRC generation and attachment, Tail biting convolutional encoding,
    Rate matching, Scrambling, Modulation, Layer mapping. FIGURE 8. NPSS & NSSS subframe
    [61]. Show All FIGURE 9. Mapping of NBPBCH [59]. Show All ii) NPDCCH: Narrowband
    Physical Downlink Control Channel The NPDCCH is used to carry DCI (Downlink Control
    Information). Basically, a device needs to monitor NPDCCH to obtain three types
    of information mentioned below. NBIoT has own control channel different from LTE-MTC
    system, although some features have been inherited. Typically NPDCCH is apt for
    transporting scheduling information. Moreover, as NBIoT supports only HDD mode
    thus transmission of NPDCCH is packet based [63]. Besides this to keep the power
    consumption low on UE side, the payload size of DCI (downlink control information)
    is kept up to 23 bits for UL grant or DL assignment for NPDCCH. Hence three new
    DCI formats have been defined as Format N0, Format N1, and Format N2. The usage
    of these formats is specified in Table 4. Further, NPDCCH consists of Narrowband
    control channel elements (NCCEs) where resource elements are mapped. A subframe
    has two NCCEs, analogous to the upper six and lower six subcarriers and for NCCE
    mapping (Fig. 10). TABLE 4 DCI Formats [14], [61] FIGURE 10. NPDCCH subframe structure
    [62]. Show All iii) Narrowband Physical Downlink Shared Channel (NPDSCH) The NPDSCH
    is the core data bearing channel used for transmission of unicast data, broadcast
    information such as SI (System Information) messages. It segments the data packet
    received from higher layer into transmission blocks and transmits one at a time.
    The resource mapping is done in an almost similar manner as NPDCCH beside two
    differences. One, that NPDSCH carry only one TB (maximum TB size is limited to
    680 bits) though NPDCCH can multiplex resources in a subframe to transmit two
    DCI messages. Secondly, if the subframe transmits the SIB1-NB then starting OFDM
    symbol in an NPDCCH subframe will be different from NPDSCH subframe in the in-band
    mode. The NPDSCH TB is processed as follows. Firstly, the CRC of 24-bit is evaluated
    and then attached to the TB. Then TB is encoded via the tail biting convolutional
    coding encoder and rate-matched owing to code-word length deduced collectively
    from the number of NPDSCH sub-frames assigned to the TB and on the basis of the
    number of REs per subframe. Accordingly, the coding rate is determined by size
    of TB and the number of NPDSCH Subframes allotted to the TB combination. Henceforward
    before mapping the encoded TB bits to QPSK symbols, the bits are scrambled i.e.
    the subframe is repeated min (NREP, 4) times before the mapping of the code word
    continues. For each repetition, the scrambling code differs. The maximum no of
    repetitions allowed are 2048 to achieve the SNR of −12.6dB. The repeated Subframes
    allow a device to decode the code word before the transmission completes [64].
    F. NBIoT Connection Process 1) Cell Selection Process A device can be in idle
    or connected mode while looking for the cell to camp on. If the device wakes up
    from a deep sleep then it obtains the information about most recently used (MRU)
    cells using cell selection protocols. In case none of the cell is found suitable
    or if device is powered on for the first time, it is required to perform a full
    frequency scan to find a new cell to camp on. The fundamental purpose of cell
    selection is to identify and synchronize to a suitable NB-IoT cell. In this context,
    the first foremost step is to time synchronize and then obtain a CFO estimated
    value. In order to achieve NPSS synchronization, its autocorrelation properties
    must be exploited. Hence when device achieves the time synchronization, then using
    next frames it determines the CFO. For device located in extreme coverage conditions,
    large number of NPSS frames are required to be detected. Once the symbol time
    is determined and the CFO is compensated for in-band or guard-band, still, an
    additional raster offset will exist up to 7.5 kHz. Consequently, this raster offset
    drifts the symbol time either in the forward or backward direction due to overcompensation
    or under compensation of the carrier frequency respectively. As a result, there
    is severe degradation in the performance of NPBCH detection, which may introduce
    latency greater than the length of CP (Cyclic Prefix) and subsequently leading
    to loss of orthogonality of OFDM symbol lost in the downlink. Hence to improve
    the detection performance device complexity must be increased so that it may do
    hypothesis testing of set of raster offset. Once the NPSS synchronization is achieved
    the device has the knowledge of subframe #9, however, a device has information,
    whether the radio frame is odd or even numbered. As NBIoT has 504 Cell-ids, thus
    NSSS detection algorithm will form 4032 hypothesis in total. Thereafter correlating
    the received signal corresponding to each hypothesis with NSSS waveform allow
    a device to detect the Cell-id. Hereafter device has Cell-id and also has information
    about the placement of NRS. Now the NBPCH is demodulated to obtain MIB-NB for
    this the device needs to form eight hypotheses hence also referred as blind decoding.
    The MIB-NB contains 34 bits and is transmitted over 64 radio frames. The foremost
    information acquired from MIB are a) Operation mode indicated by 7 bits i.e. stand-alone,
    in-band, guard-band. b) Information about SIB1 scheduling indicated by 4 bits.
    c) SI value tag indicated by 5 bits d) Access barring (AB) information enabled
    or not is indicated by 1 bit. e) System Timing: 4 MSBs of the SFN and 2 LSBs of
    the H-SFN. f) 11 spare bits used for future extensions. In addition to this, the
    transport block size and the number of repetitions is also indicated in the MIB.
    Hence acquiring the MIB-NB, a device can locate and decode SIB1-NB. An SIB1-NB
    carries 8 MSBs of the H-SFN, tracking area, a 28-bit long cell-id, and scheduling
    information regarding other SIB to unambiguously ascertain a cell within a PLMN.
    The SIB1-NB transmitted in subframe #4 of every other frame in 16 continuous frames.
    Beside this, it is transmitted at a fixed schedule with a periodicity of 2560
    ms (256 Radio Frames). To determine the first frame for transmission of SIB1,
    cell-id is used. Hereafter acquiring SIB1-NB, the device achieves the complete
    synchronization. If any change occurs it will be indicated either by paging or
    by changing the tag values. In a manner, the device has accomplished time and
    frequency synchronization with errors that will not significantly degrade the
    performance in successive transmissions and receptions during connected or idle
    mode operations [65], [66]. Fig. 11 (a) describes the cell acquisition process.
    FIGURE 11. (a) Cell acquisition process [66]. (b) Random access procedure [69].
    (c) Connection Establishment [70]. (d) Data transmission [73]. Show All 2) Random
    Access Procedure Random Access procedure is initiated by the MAC layer itself
    or by its sublayer RRC. Before initialization of this process, UE has information
    about the available set of PRACH resources. The principles to select PRACH resource
    is based on received signal received power (RSRP) measurement that specify the
    enhanced coverage level supported by the Serving Cell. A device uses two threshold
    values supported by serving cell to determine the NPRACH configuration. Besides
    this, the RSRP thresholds are used by the network to analyze the maximum coupling
    loss corresponding to different coverage levels. In NBIoT the eNB can support
    max 3 number of NPRACH repetitions out of {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64}. Hereafter
    acquiring the CE level information UE instructs the physical layer to transmit
    a preamble while specifying the number of repetitions required for transmission
    per preamble, preamble index and preamble received target power. For CE level
    0, the preamble received target power (PRTP) is set to PRTP-10 * log10 (number-of-Repetition-Per-Preamble-Attempt)
    whereas for other CE levels PRTP is set to the UE maximum output power [67], [68].
    In NPRACH, RA preamble is transmitted to determine the transmission time of the
    device to eNodeB. On each symbol group of RA preamble frequency hopping is applied
    so that individual group is transmitted on a different subcarrier. Hereafter transmitting
    the preamble, RA-RNTI (Random Access-Radio Network Temporary Identifier) is computed
    using RA-RNTI = 1+floor (SFN_id/4), here SFN_id is the index of the first radio
    frame, then it looks for RAR (Random Access Response) message indicated in DCI
    format N1 scrambled with RA-RNTI transmitted in PDCCH. Nevertheless, if RAR (random
    Access Response) is not received then UE retransmits the preamble. As stated above
    number of retransmissions depend on CE level. However, if the number of attempt
    saturates an associated failure is reported to RRC. Now eNB on receiving the preamble
    sequence transmits the RAR message also referred as Msg 2, to UE which provide
    information about TA (Timing Advance), scheduling information about radio resource
    that device can use to transmit the request for connection, C-RNTI (Cell radius
    Network Temporary identification) as shown in Fig. 11 (b) [69] Now UE transmits
    Msg 3 to eNB on NPUSCH including its identity, C-RNTI MAC CE, submitted from the
    upper layer and start the contention resolution process. In addition to this data,
    the volume parameter is sent to indicate the amount of data present in UE buffer.
    All together will facilitate the BS to take power allocation and scheduling decision
    for subsequent UL transmission. 3) Connection Establishment UE indicates that
    it wants to connect to the network by sending RRC-Connection-Request. In addition
    to the establishment cause, the UE also indicates its capability to support multi-tone
    traffic and multi carrier support. The eNB on receiving connection request, send
    RRC-Connection-Setup message Thereafter UE acknowledges by sending the Connection-setup-
    -complete message and send NAS attach request. The PDN-CONNECTIVITY-REQUEST message
    is piggy-backed in NAS ATTACH REQUEST [70], [71]. The PDN connection is novel
    capability introduced in 3GPP Rel-13 that allow UE to remain attached without
    PDN connection that support CIoT optimization. In this UE is not required to establish
    a PDN connection as part of attach procedure. Moreover UE and MME can release
    the connection without releasing EPS connection. Hence enables large number of
    devices to keep their connection inactive for long duration and seldom transmit
    data over it [72]. Hereafter the EPS authentication process is initiated. After
    that to activate the default EPS bearer CONTEXT REQUEST message is piggybacked
    in NAS: ATTACH ACCEPT. The follow of above discussed steps are discussed in Fig.
    11(c). 4) Small Data Transfer In Rel-13, 3GPP added an ability to send data over
    control Plane. As NBIoT require to transmit the small data sporadically, hence
    to send it in optimized way CIoT EPS optimizations are used which include Control
    Plane and User Plane optimization. In Control Plane optimization, UE sends the
    data packets encapsulated in NAS (Non Access Stratum) to convey non radio signal
    to MME for a service request. In NAS message RAI (Release Assistance Information)
    field indicate the MME that any further UL/DL transmissions are expected. In case
    no further transmission is expected than MME immediately triggers the S1 Release
    procedure. Hence enable MME to reduce the device DRX waiting period during which
    it waits for additional transmission. Besides this, if the size of the data transferred
    via Control Plane exceeds then UE/MME triggers the establishment of User Plane
    bearer between eNB and SGW. User Plane CIoT EPS optimization is an alternative
    procedure which is suitable for short as well as large data transaction. However,
    it requires first to establish RRC connection and create Access Stratum and radio
    bearer between the network and UE. Once the RRC connection is established two
    control procedures Connection suspend and Resume are used [74] G. Modes of Operation
    of NBIoT NBIoT carrier can be deployed in three modes standalone, in-band, and
    guard band. Standalone Operation: In this mode, a separate spectrum is either
    reserved for radio access technology like GSM/UMTS or a dedicated spectrum is
    used for deployment of NBIoT carrier. However, this will escalate the implementation
    cost as software and hardware upgradation will be required for spectrum reframing.
    In Band Operation: In this mode NBIoT carrier is deployed within LTE carrier.
    Sharing of resource block would definitely result in the more efficient use of
    spectrum which in turn will increase the capacity. The LTE bands not utilized
    to carry system information block −1 are used for inband deployment of NBIoT.
    In single tone transmission mode in uplink, there will be interference between
    NB-IoT and LTE (3.75 kHz subcarrier spacing). Although this interference could
    be minimized by scheduling users with similar SNR requirements in NB-IoT and nearby
    LTE PRBs. It’s also a cost effective way as no hardware modifications are required.
    In Guard Band Operation: In this mode NBIoT carrier will be located within guard
    band of LTE carrier to avoid interference. This mode delivers better downlink
    throughput in comparison to in band as more downlink resource is available [75].
    NB-IoT deployment modes offer high flexibility as carrier deployed in one mode
    can continue working via either of the other modes if spectrum migrates to LTE.
    Fig. 12 describes the scenario of different modes. FIGURE 12. Modes of operation
    of NBIoT [75]. Show All H. Low Power Consumption Using NBIoT Saving power of the
    battery powered device is a crucial factor for the realization of LPWAN applications.
    Two main features Power saving mode (introduced in Rel-12) and Extended Discontinuous
    reception RX (introduced in Rel-13) are used to extend the battery life of device
    up to ten or more years (Fig. 13(A) shows the PSM and Fig. 13(B) eDRX mode) [76].
    FIGURE 13. PSM and eDRX modes to save power, [Source: https://www.rohde-schwarz.comRohde&Schwarz].
    Show All A device in PSM goes into deep sleep mode and could not receive any signal.
    Although whilst this mode device can’t be reached but remain registered with the
    network. Thereby PSM eradicates the need for re-establishment of a connection
    when the device wakes up. Hence will not only result in saving power but also
    help in avoiding network congestion (due to different wake-up time). Thus it is
    suitable for application that requires sporadic transmission (e.g. Once a day).
    A device can switch to PSM, proposing two timers T3324 (active timer) and T3412
    (extended timer) and it is attached to TAU. (The maximum time a device could remain
    in the active state is 186 minutes (~T3324) & max sleeping time for a device would
    be 413 days defined by T3412.) However, it’s up to the network to accept the proposed
    timer values or not. Despite this, there is one challenge of using PSM is non
    reachability of device for a long period that needs to be taken care of by opting
    an optimal value to get a good balance between responsiveness and time for the
    device to stay in PSM. Another main feature is eDRX to save power, this in comparison
    to PSM supports DL accessibility significantly. eDRX reduces the periodicity of
    a device to switch in receiving mode and extends the sleep cycle more in idle
    mode than in connected mode. Currently, in LTE, DRX can extend up to 10.24 s whereas
    using eDRX it can be extended for minutes and hours. Thus for synchronization
    between network and device a new clock H-SFN (Hyper System Frame Number) is used.
    A power saving of 43% can be achieved using eDRX with small paging transmission
    window. As power consumption after PTW during deep sleep mode would be extremely
    low. Hence longer the eDRX more would be power saving. In addition to this other
    feature like reduced complexity and reduced overhead of channel measurement also
    reduce the power consumption, hence extends battery life [77]. I. Applications
    of NBIoT The cost effectiveness of NBIoT-network (due to the implementation of
    new software on an existing LTE infrastructure) has inspired several market analyst
    organizations to predict the revenue in the future. NBIoT being a promising technology,
    could support a wide range of applications with increased efficiency. Some of
    the important applications sectors of NBIoT with notable market perspective are
    utility-meter, industry automation, smart logistics, smart cities, waste management,
    environmental monitoring, agriculture and in personal sector like wearables, pet
    tracking, kids monitoring, white goods monitoring (Fig. 14) which provide convenience
    to remotely access of water, gas, electricity, and heat readings even when they
    are located in weak coverage areas like basements. Currently, a Germany based
    company, ista-International GmBH in collaboration with Deutsche Telekom is proving
    a solution for smart buildings by providing smart utility services using NBIoT
    [26]. Other companies such as Eco Mobile from Zagreb, Croatia in collaboration
    with Deutsche Telekom are providing IoT solutions for waste management using NBIoT.
    Here the sensors are used to measure the level of the trash bin and thereafter
    the sensed data using NBIoT sent to cloud, to determine the optimal route. Hence
    reduce logistic cost. Another important application of NBIoT is smart parking.
    Here occupancy [55]. Prime use case/application of NBIoT is utility meters information
    is collected and hence provide the availability of parking space throughout the
    city. Hamburg will be first to offer using this service of IoT using NBIoT. Huawei
    with China Unicom collaboratively launched smart parking in China also in 2017.
    Apart from this NBIoT can also monitor the environment effectively [16]. For example,
    XMM7115, FIGURE 14. Applications of NBIoT. Show All NBIoT-intel chip is used for
    environmental monitoring. Currently, in Greece Patras, NBIoT based monitoring
    service is being offered by Deutsche Telekom to effectively measure environment
    pollution, noise and air quality to take necessary actions. Automation and digitization
    is the need of the hour and list of possible application are endless. The technical
    view of current IoT applications related to four particular sectors Health monitoring,
    Social monitoring, Agriculture monitoring and defense that are ruling the market
    are given in Table 5. TABLE 5 Different Applications of IoT SECTION V. Efficient
    Resource Allocation Techniques Due to massive connections, IoT system will be
    extremely dense thus the use of efficient resource allocation techniques is of
    vital importance. As incompetent resource allocation will drastically degrade
    the performance of IoT systems. Moreover, there are miscellaneous factors that
    further aids in increasing the complicacy of efficient resource allocation such
    as limited network bandwidth, limited device computation power, diverse user requirement,
    heterogeneous device configurations. Broadly these resource allocation techniques
    can be classified into the following categories: Power allocation, Spectrum allocation,
    Computing & Storage resources allocation in the cloud and Scheduling based (Fig.
    15). Other than this all techniques that assure the reduction in latency and packet
    error are categorized under QoS resource allocation techniques. As per now, few
    resource allocation schemes (RAS) have been proposed for NBIoT system. Immense
    research is required to be carried out for the practical implication of NBIoT
    as the IoT devices have limited resources. In this section, a review of resource
    allocation schemes for NBIoT and IoT system is presented. FIGURE 15. Resource
    allocation in IoT [107]. Show All A. NBIoT Resource Allocation Techniques Yu et
    al. [108] proposed a UL link adaptation scheme with consideration of repletion
    factor to address two important aspects of throughput and reliability. This scheme
    worked in two loops inner and outer. The inner one modifies the repletion factor
    to improve block error ratio whereas outer concentrate on the selection of modulation
    and coding scheme level In addition to this outer loop also decides the repetition
    factor accounting acknowledgment or no acknowledgment packets. As a result, the
    authors observed that the proposed technique can save 46% more resource allocation
    and active time in comparison of straightforward techniques. However, they have
    not considered the effect of inter-channel interference during evaluation. In
    order to handle massive connection effectively in NBIoT multi PRB design is used.
    Where most of UE’s use Anchor-PRB (that satisfy the channel raster condition)
    to get paging and system information block. This leads to overloading of anchor-PRB.
    Hence the overloading of narrowband resource leads to underutilization of resources
    and increase power consumption. To overcome this issue Liu et al. [109] suggested
    a resource allocation technique to balance the paging load by using non-Anchor
    PRB. In the proposed technique existing user will use the Anchor PRB and the new
    NBIoT user will make use of non-Anchor PRB for paging in idle mode. As a result,
    it was observed that resource utilization improved by 30% and power consumption
    was reduced by 80%. Malik et al. [110] proposed an interference aware RAS that
    accounts for the repetition number & time offset. The linear modulation scheme
    is used in NBIoT (QPSK), therefore spectral efficiency is low. Firstly they evaluated
    the max attainable data rate for downlink is 89.2 kbps and 92kbps for uplink (theoretically).
    In addition to this, the authors analyzed the performance of cooperative scheme
    in comparison of non-cooperative and optimal scheme. They found that cooperative
    scheme can reduce the energy consumption by 17% and can improve the data rate
    up to 8%. B. IoT Based Resource Allocation Techniques Liu and Ansari [111] proposed
    a green approach by developing an overlay based architecture that uses relay BS
    powered by solar energy. These relay BS stores the harvested energy in two batteries
    and each one is used in alternatively when one exhaust. Thus omits the grid based
    energy utilization and cuts cost for transmission of power also. Here in this
    approach, the SD (source destination) pairs are classified into two groups based
    on CSI. Where one is direct D2D which doesn’t use relay for transmission and another
    one that uses relay BS for transmission of information. However, while allocating
    bandwidth direct D2D pair is given more preference in comparison to relay based
    D2D transmissions. As a result, authors observed that as the number of SD pair
    increases with D2D communication very less bandwidth left for relay based pairs
    which deteriorates their performance. In addition to this due to large no of direct
    D2D pairs green energy will exhaust quickly and to balance the leftover/residual
    energy the relay BSs with enough left over green energy will transmit their electricity
    via electric transmission lines to the relay BSs which run out of green energy.
    Hence proposed architecture maximizes the green energy utilization and further
    saves the on-grid energy. Further, Kotagi et al. [112] proposed a breathing technique
    to reduce the BS energy consumption by assigning the Tx(Transmission) power efficiently.
    Firstly the SINR of the user is compared with pre-specified SINR threshold value
    and if found greater Tx Power has modified accordingly. Thereupon resource is
    allocated, according to breathing pattern i.e. IoT devices are arranged in increasing
    (inhaling)/decreasing (exhaling) order on the basis required Tx Power and then
    mapped to resource block. In addition to this if available resources are less
    as compare to required, the user/device with a heavy request and highest Tx power
    was blocked. Apart from this transmission power is reduced if SINR of device is
    greater than the threshold value, which in turn improves the co-channel interference.
    Authors found that overall energy consumption of BS reduced and throughput is
    improved using the proposed approach. Further Samie et al. [113] enlighten the
    issue of underutilization of bandwidth of gateway. As IoT device have limited
    computation capability thus it is offloaded to the edge nodes i.e. gateway. However,
    due to limited bandwidth and diverse offloading levels, gateway bandwidth resource
    remain underutilized. Hence authors developed an algorithm that allocates or take
    away bandwidth from a device depending on its battery level. As a result, they
    found that battery life extended by 1.5 hour max and bandwidth utilization improved
    by 40%. Ejaz and Ibnkahla [114] proposed a framework for C-5GN. In the proposed
    framework, multiband sensing approach is used such that sensing is done in shared
    mode where each node is required to sense equal and reduced number of channels,
    thus reduced energy consumption. Although it is assured that all channels get
    processed once at least by a node. Apart from this, a game based CLRS (Cross Layer
    Reconfiguration) scheme is used to satisfy the diverse QoS requirement (latency,
    data rate, etc.) for each node. Hence, authors observed that the proposed technique
    reduced energy consumed during spectrum sensing and QoS is offered economically.
    Pang et al. [115] proposed a complete contention resolution approach based on
    the principle of context-aware and dynamic allocation of resource (CADRA). Overload
    scenario is first detected by analyzing the no of nonempty preambles. If detected,
    CADRA is called. This works in two phases firstly it determines the estimated
    number of RACH attempts by observing the preambles received successfully and empty
    preambles. After that in the second phase resource allocation is done. As a result,
    authors observed that throughput increased with moderate packet delay. Jang et
    al. [116] proposed Non orthogonal resource allocation collaborated with spatial
    group resource allocation scheme (SGRA). SGRA divides the cell into spatial groups.
    After dividing the cell region, it detects the preambles transmitted from the
    user in a certain spatial group by zadoff-chu sequence (which is shifted by spatial
    group number). Once the preambles utilized by a spatial group was determined using
    the ordered time delay metric, subgroups were formed. Authors found that using
    the proposed approach the probability of success of random access has increased
    a lot. Further, Morvari and Ghasemi [117] proposed a resource allocation scheme
    that works in two stage by efficacious use of resource available in UL. During
    the first phase, users are required to pass the access class bearing test. If
    a user manages to pass only then permitted to select the preamble (PA) and use
    physical uplink shared channel opportunity else has to select the special PA.
    Finally, in the second stage the secondary users are allowed to take access class
    bearing test again if passed allowed to request for UL shared channel. Hence it
    is inferred that the number of request that can be handled with proposed technique
    whilst dropping the wastage that occurs due to the collision of PA’s. Another
    extended RA scheme with spatial group resource allocation is proposed in [118].
    This scheme reuses the allocated preamble if the distance between the two nodes
    belonging to a different spatial group is greater than pre-specified minimum distance.
    In addition to this, access delay is also reduced. The proposed approach will
    utilize the unused bandwidth. Beside this collision probability is also tapered
    by using distinct UL resources for transmission. As interference is also a prevalent
    challenge for IoT device communication. Taking into consideration Iqbal et al.
    [119] proposed a constraint specific approach to improve the performance of IoT
    networks For solving the RA problem authors have used backtracking search algorithm
    named Soft-GORA.Where firstly channel is selected with minimum cost for tentative
    allocation to link, at the top in the ordered list and then checked against hard
    constraint. If it couldn’t satisfy the constraint, the allocated channel is removed
    and the next best option is opted. As a result, authors relaxing few constraints
    observed that throughput has improved and delay is reduced. Li et al. [120] proposed
    an architecture using edge computing further, they proposed a scheme to jointly
    control admission of new packet and allocation of resource together with power
    control. For this, the resource management controller at fog node uses three information
    i.e. service, state of the queue, CSI. Using the proposed schemes authors found
    that tradeoff is achieved between throughput and delay. Zhang et al. [121] proposed
    a joint optimize framework for the selection and allocation of resource among
    fog nodes (FN), data service subscribers (DSS) & data service operators.(DSO)
    They have developed a stakelberg game algorithm, here DSO provides the computing
    resources (CR) to DSS and if they require more CRB’s(Computing Resource Block)
    DSS competes for them. For this, another matching game algorithm is developed.
    As a result it was found that the system achieves high performance and optimally
    utilizes their resources. Further, cognitive 5G network (C-5GN) is expected to
    play a vital role in IoT success, Angelakis et al. [122] developed two algorithms
    RAND-INT and Average-cost allocation, to optimally allocate resources for services.
    These algorithms reduced the total cost of resource utilization and activation
    of interface. Where RAND-INT algorithm normalizes the demands to get an order
    in which resource is to be allocated. Henceforth the heaviest demand is served
    first by comparing the utilization cost of interfaces, thereby other demands are
    served either by splitting or by not splitting among two or more interfaces. Whereas
    the second algorithm assigns, the resource by averaging the total cost incurred.
    Authors have studied the impact of the activation cost on the services’ splits
    and distribution among the interfaces. As a result, they found that for random
    service with high demand, interface total cost increases linearly with respect
    to the number of services. Hence above discussed technique proves that resource
    technique can enhance communication, connectivity and collaboration of IoT devices.
    The chief objective of resource allocation technique is to minimize the power
    consumption per node, BER, Delay and maximize the throughput and network utilization.
    The above discussed techniques are summarized in Table 6. TABLE 6 Efficient Resource
    Allocation Techniques for IoT SECTION VI. Energy Consumption in Lifecycle of IoT
    Devices Sensing device act as the backbone for IoT applications. Different sensors
    are deployed massively to develop a ubiquitous sensed environment, to offer diverse
    monitoring and control services. Indeed to avoid service interruptions of critical
    applications sensing device must operate permissibly for a long time. However,
    as most of the IoT devices are powered by constrained energy source hence device
    lifetime longevity is a critical issue. Therefore the device must be monitored
    precisely for optimal utilization. In this context, the trend of energy consumption
    during different states of the sensor is studied in [123]. There are five modes
    among which sensor switches- Mode I: Wake up from Sleep mode, Mode II: After Sleep
    mode. Mode III: Sensing, Mode IV: Processing, Mode V: Transmission. Hussain [123]
    studied different case studies to see the trend of energy consumption during different
    modes. As a conclusion of various trends (Fig. 16), it was found that during Processing-Phase
    energy consumption was least whereas, for Sensing Phase, node consumes the highest
    power as compare to Transmission Phase. However, energy consumption during Transmission
    phase depends on the application. For example, consider the applications like
    Humidity/thermal measurement the power consumption during the wake-up and in getting
    ready for sensing phase is more as compare to other applications like temperature
    sensing which require less power for the same. Duty Cycle is the other metric
    that affects the energy consumption in the sensor node. As the duty cycle increases,
    energy consumption increases consequently lifetime of the node decreases. There
    are various factors that affect the lifetime of an IoT device such as duty cycle,
    the amount of data to be communicated, processing time other factors like aging,
    self-discharge and temperature [124]. Hence various energy efficiency techniques
    have been proposed in the literature to improve the lifetime of an IoT device
    and hence network lifetime. In the next section the recently proposed energy efficiency
    techniques are discussed in detail. FIGURE 16. Energy consumption during the lifecycle
    of IoT device [123]. Show All A. Energy Efficient Techniques for Green Communication
    The energy budget affects the sensor node processing time, quality of measurement
    and amount of data it can transmit, thus energy efficiency techniques can a play
    crucial role to improve QoE. Rault et al. [125] classified the energy efficiency
    techniques classified into five categories of radio optimization, data reduction,
    sleep/wakeup schemes, energy efficient routing and battery repletion. Where radio
    optimization techniques would optimize modulation schemes, transmission power,
    and antenna direction on the other hand data reduction reduces the data transmitted.
    Furthermore Sleep/Wake-up adaptively switches the node to sleep or active mode
    to save energy. Other two techniques, energy efficient routing, and battery repletion
    works on routing efficiency and ways of harvesting energy or finding ways to charge
    battery automation, respectively. (Fig. 17, discusses briefly the impact of different
    techniques). In this section, the existing literature on energy efficiency techniques
    is discussed. FIGURE 17. Classification of energy efficiency techniques for IoT.
    Show All 1) Sleep/Wakeup Techniques Khodr et al. [126] enlighten that though the
    duty cycling technique could reduce power consumption but this will reduce network
    reactivity. Thus authors proposed a design of sensor based RF wake up technology.
    This design approach wakes the sensor only when the address decoder detects that
    whether a received signal address is of IoT device or not. Thereby omits the fake
    call wakeups hence reduced energy consumption. Perles et al. [127] did a case
    study on cultural heritage and proposed an architecture to improve the lifespan
    of sensor life up to 20 years using unlicensed LPWAN technologies LoRa &SigFox.
    In order to keep the energy consumption low, the proposed architecture wakes up
    the microcontroller whenever a new packet arrives. Apart from this, it uses a
    cluster management system, Elastic Cloud Computing Cluster (EC3) which can deploy
    and un-deploy nodes as per demand i.e. nodes will be deployed if load increases
    and un-deployed if they are idle. 2) Cognitive Radio Techniques Further, Qureshi
    et al. [128] discussed cognitive radio approach where unlicensed users opportunistically
    access the unused spectrum holes that are not used by the licensed user. Hence
    to achieve good throughput, uninterrupted connectivity, and Reliable communication,
    for both licensed and unlicensed user the concept of the backup data channel (BDC)
    was introduced. Where if licensed user return than unlicensed user resumes its
    communication using BDC. Hence communication time between SUs for task completion
    will be reduced and thereby the energy consumption of CRAN’s will reduce and throughput
    will increase. Furthermore, Li et al. [129] proposed a 5G based framework where
    the central control unit act as both cloud and central data processor takes the
    sensed data from the physical world. In addition to this authors, fractionated
    the resource allocation into two sub problems of power and channel allotment in
    industrial Cyber physical IoT. These sub-problems are solved separately. For individual
    channel allotment, the energy efficiency is achieved using game theory and Dinkelbach’s
    algorithm. After this, the Hungarian method was used for channel allocation. Authors
    analyzed that IHM-VD could perform outstandingly. 3) Routing Techniques Further
    Yi et al. [130] proposed a topology control algorithm in which nodes discover
    their neighbors asymmetrically. For time synchronization multiple of two is taken
    as reference point. Authors observed that energy consumption got abridged due
    to curtailment in wakeup calls required to discover the neighboring node. Further,
    the utmost drawback of continuous sensing (i.e. nonselective monitoring) is unfiltered
    data that results in significant energy consumption of sensors. Basnayaka and
    Haas [131] proposed a physical layer modulation scheme RNM (random number modulation)
    that operates in two modes energy efficient and low latency. To switch between
    modes the constellation order and random bit generated by random generator were
    considered. Proposed approach compromise latency for energy efficiency, as the
    user was allowed to transmit the data block only when it matches with random sequence
    generated by a random number generator otherwise the user could not transmit the
    data. Shen et al. [132] proposed a clustering based protocol EECRP for IoT assisted
    by WSN to enhance the performance of the network. Firstly a cluster head is opted
    by comparing the energy of each node with pre-specified energy (threshold value)
    after this taking the distance from the centroid (energy based) of the network
    to the node is considered. This leads to uniform energy consumption in the network.
    After this for optimal result, the max distance value is broadcasted by BS to
    all the nodes, in order to avoid long distance communication. As a result, it
    has been found that overall energy consumption of the network is reduced in comparison
    to proprietary protocols. In extension to this, Tian et al. [133] have discussed,
    when to use network coding concept to reduce the energy consumption. Authors have
    proposed a network coding and power control based routing (NCPCR) protocol. Using
    this protocol intermediate node drops the duplicate packets and keep the relevant
    information in its buffer. Source node selects the path with the minimum distance
    to transmit the data packets. As a result the energy consumption is reduced as
    no of packets to be retransmitted is reduced and moreover, it opts for the shortest
    path also and in addition to this, it can handle scalability. 4) Data Reduction
    Technique Perera et al. [134] proposed a platform C-MOSDEN that performs sensing
    tasks collaboratively and in a selective manner i.e. adaptive sensing to reduce
    energy consumption. As sensing would require less computational efforts to drive
    knowledge from data generated. In addition to this, the storage cost will also
    be reduced. 5) Battery Repletion Technique Nan et al. [135] enlighten that offloading
    the traffic at fog layer or edge layer has led to increased carbon footprints,
    thus they have proposed an online algorithm LOTEC (Lyapunov optimization on time
    and energy cost). The proposed technique suggested using green power source i.e.
    solar energy and grid power as a standby power source. The discussed energy efficiency
    techniques are summarized in tabular form in Table 7. In this paper, two novel
    application based energy efficient approaches are proposed. For smart agriculture
    and Smart Healthcare. Where “ZTPA” -a hybrid approach, centered on two techniques
    “Sleep/wake up” and “Energy efficient routing” is proposed. E2AHMS is proposed
    for smart healthcare, which is a radio based approach. These two approaches with
    their proposed mathematical approach are discussed in detail in section VIII.
    TABLE 7 Energy Effeciency Techniques for IoT SECTION VII. Open Issues Ascertaining
    the vision of the NBIoT is not a tranquil task, owing to multiple challenges that
    are required to be addressed Although NBIoT offers significant features for LPWA
    applications, yet a number of critical issues remain unattended that seeks traction
    from the research community. The technical issues and challenges related to energy
    are discussed in this section. A. Non-Uniformity in Resources Allocation In the
    current scenario, resources are allocated on the basis of total available power,
    coverage range, and demanded applications. Due to non-uniformity in the requirement
    of resources, a non-uniformity in power consumption persists. This is a critical
    challenge that seeks redressal as there are no studies/algorithms/techniques available
    for uniform resource allocation in NBIoT. A unified platform is required for resource
    allocation so that applications can be handled adaptively in real time scenarios.
    B. Difficulty in Achieving the Desired Throughput The prime advantage of NBIoT
    enabled device is to make use of low power to operate. Therefore the power of
    the signal transmitted will be low. Beside this due to channel losses, fading
    & interference (Intra/Inter) SINR will drop drastically. Hence it would be quite
    difficult to achieve the desired throughput in all condition. Thus proper channel
    modeling, optimized algorithms/techniques required to be designed/developed to
    achieve desired throughput C. Inter-Channel Interference The allocation of frequency
    in in-band or standalone mode will not be synchronous among all the cells in the
    network. This results in interference among neighboring cells. Interference within
    the same cell also exists due to the deployment of small cells in the macro cell.
    These result in a fall in the SNR. This is a decisive challenge, especially for
    critical applications like acute healthcare applications, where noise could tamper
    biological readings. This may lead to the wrong detection and thereby wrong medication.
    Thus an efficient scheme is required to be developed to reduce interference and
    provide QoS to the users. D. Spectral Efficiency To achieve extended coverage,
    the concept of multiple repetitions is utilized. Undoubtedly this would improve
    the Tx Reliability but will lead to loss of spectral efficiency. Thus an efficient
    resource allocation scheme is required which could optimally decide the repetition
    factor. Furthermore, to maintain high channel capacity- device consumes more power,
    consequently reducing its lifetime. This open issue needs to be addressed because
    it would adversely affect the battery lifetime E. Latency Different types of latency
    can occur during NBIoT communication: a) UL/DL latency, b) synchronization latency,
    c) the latency associated with resource allocation, d) latency associated with
    packet synchronization. Though NBIoT applications are delay tolerant, yet latency
    needs to be kept below 10s, especially for real time applications such as health
    monitoring. Thus the theoretical computational model must be framed to improve
    the latency analysis. F. Synchronization With the Access Point Consider a scenario
    where utility meters are positioned close to each other. When all devices would
    send information to the cluster head, synchronization will be difficult for the
    access point as there would be interference between devices within its range.
    Besides this, other factors like the priority of a device, its residual power
    availability and channel conditions will also affect the synchronization process,
    raising its complexity. Hence this open issue needs to be addressed by providing
    techniques/algorithms for synchronization. G. Security The issue of security is
    very critical for NBIoT. As low power devices have limited resources, they are
    more vulnerable to security attacks. By exploiting the data integrity or tracking
    the traffic pattern, passive or active attack can befall at the perception layer.
    Besides, other security attacks such as the injection of false data by an intruder,
    transmission of interference signals, etc. can also occur. Thus continuous efforts
    must be put in by industry, academicians, and researchers to maintain the faith
    of users in using the services provided by the NBIoT application. H. Carbon Footprint
    Inflation The massive connectivity among millions of devices would generate an
    enormous amount of data. In order to draw an inference from the collected information,
    servers need to manage data through extensive computations. This will overburden
    the servers, resulting in rising in energy and subsequently raising carbon emissions.
    In addition, the factors such as manufacturing of billions of IoT devices, shipments
    of these devices, excess use of radio access network, etc. will also elevate the
    carbon footprint. Fig. 18 demonstrates the percentage of carbon emissions due
    to various such activities [136]. Collaboratively, these will have an adverse
    impact on pollution levels. Hence, the need for a generic architecture arises
    to achieve Green IoT, whilst assuring better QoS to all the users. FIGURE 18.
    Carbon footprint due to various activities. Show All I. E-Waste Management As
    technology improves, people started procuring additional electronic equipment’s
    like PDA’s, desktop computers, smart phones, and gadgets, though might not be
    required. The complex structure of these e-waste/WEEE (waste electrical and electronic
    equipment) makes it difficult to destroy. The condition will become even more
    severe in coming future when millions of sensors and battery operated IoT devices
    will have to be destroyed and replaced with new ones, either due to reformation
    in technology or lifetime expiry. Many countries like Japan, Taiwan, and U.S etc.
    are working on this hot burning issue since 2001. However, together with this
    research efforts are needed for the development of the green disposable electronic
    device. J. Cloud-Radio Access Network (C-RAN) Overhead In C-RAN the virtual centralized
    BBU (Base Band Unit) is used to reduce the OPEX, generated heat, and latency.
    Hence, instead of having BBU at each cell site with remote Radio head, they are
    repositioned in centralized manner in BBU home. In IoT, the users would be monitoring
    & controlling multiple devices remotely, this would overburden the existing network
    especially between the RRH and BBU Pool. Moreover, the different types of data
    i.e. real, non-real, social, sensitive, medical/health data, agriculture related
    data, etc. would collectively create an extensive overhead for CRAN. Pertaining
    to this, a huge number of processing units would be required to process the enormous
    IoT data. This, in turn, generates massive power requirement. Hence “prioritization
    of data” could be one of the solutions to deal with this open issue. K. Interface
    With Next Generation Like 5G Network The journey of IoT from virtual ideology
    to real time implementation has many milestones to achieve and one of those is
    interoperability among IoT devices. As we know that 5G operates on the very high
    frequency range like millimeter waves frequency, ranging from 28 to 32 GHz, whilst
    IoT devices operate at 2.2 GHz. Thus it’s a big challenge for the researchers
    to interface IoT with 5G Other than this, the high operating frequency in 5G networks
    escalates power consumption levels to achieve the data rate of the order of Gbps.
    In contrast to this IoT devices are highly power constrained thus operate at low
    power levels. This requires technological developments. Including this various
    other challenges such as [137] Cooperation among millions of devices, Heterogeneous
    subnet, Anonymous device configuration and Conflicts among semantics of devices
    exist. All these will collectively urge for research efforts before 5G specifications
    are standardized. L. MIMO/Massive MIMO Undoubtedly, Multiple Input Multiple Output
    (MIMO) technique provide a high data rate with high Reliability. In MIMO BS is
    acquainted with multiple antennas to improve the spectral & energy efficiency.
    Although, MIMO is an enabler for 5G, yet, it is difficult to employ MIMO in IoT.
    It is because, in the multi antenna scenario, information transmissions from the
    sensor nodes will require more processing during the synchronization phase. This
    results in more power consumption at the sensor end. Since the sensor nodes have
    limited battery capacity, adaptability of IoT devices in a MIMO environment is
    an open challenge that needs to be addressed. M. Channel State Information Collection
    Overhead The channel state assessment overhead intensifies linearly with a number
    of users. If the number of users grows beyond the threshold value then channel
    block could no longer support the assessment overhead within the narrow coherence
    time, especially for IoT applications. Moreover, the inaccurate channel estimation
    results in unreliable transmission. This uncertainty is due to the staleness of
    information after a certain time gap, due to the collision of pilot signals in
    UL. Pertaining to this, contention and interference would aggravate. As a result,
    more retransmissions are required which upraise the power consumption of IoT devices.
    Moreover, multiple verifications will contribute to more power consumption. SECTION
    VIII. Proposed Architecture Towards Green Communication Using NBIoT The world
    population is expected to grow up to 8.025 billion by 2030. Consequently, this
    growth will inflate the global food demand. Thus meeting the demands of the immense
    population will be a tough task. The varying climatic conditions, scarcity of
    water, etc. shall further aggravate the circumstances In addition to this, enhanced
    health assistance will also be required for projected population, which will be
    quite difficult to handle using existing infrastructure and services. Thus integration
    of IoT with Agriculture & Health sector can ensure a resourceful and healthy life
    for an individual. Despite, all this revolution that IoT is capable to bring in,
    the biggest stumbling block of its success is to provide energy efficient solution.
    As most of the IoT devices are constrained in term of energy. Hence this paper
    is proposing energy efficiency techniques for two prime applications: Smart Agriculture:
    Zonal Thermal Pattern Analysis and Smart Health: Energy Efficiency Adaptive Health
    Monitoring System.NBIoT is used for both the application as it offers favorable
    features like extended coverage with deep indoor penetration, long battery life,
    supports high density, require the low-cost device, and provide end to end security.
    Moreover, it would not require the deployment of new infrastructure as compared
    to proprietary technologies LoRa and SigFox, hence would offer a cost effective
    solution. A. Proposed Technique for Smart Agriculture: ZTPA 1) Case Study 1: Energy
    Efficient Agriculture Monitoring, Irrigation System for Green Communication The
    growing population and climate vagaries are forestalling that in future decades
    water resources would reduce eminently, especially for agriculture. Since agriculture
    practices require an ample amount of water, effective utilization of water is
    an obvious issue to be addressed. This section investigates an energy efficient
    technique for productive utilization of water. It has been put forth to overcome
    the disadvantages of conventional irrigation systems like wastage of water (due
    to percolation, evaporation), abbreviated crop yield. To economize the use of
    water in agriculture, IoT with Deep Learning could play a significant role. In
    the proposed scenario, soil moisture sensors are deployed in the farm field under
    consideration. Thereafter data aggregated from multiple sensors will be passed
    on to the BS using NBIoT and then to the NBIoT cloud. At the cloud, data (moisture)
    will be processed using Deep Learning and subsequently, the farm field will be
    adaptively divided into zones based on moisture level, as shown in Fig. 19 (for
    one iteration which is subjected to change in other iterations). Hereafter depending
    on the moisture levels i.e. moderate moisture level, high moisture level and least
    moisture level, zones will be irrigated. To accomplish this, the water pump is
    attached with smart NBIoT enabled water control device. This device would transmit
    the water in desired quantity and for the desired time in the zones. This scenario
    could be well understood by Fig. 19 where zone Z2 with dark pink color has the
    highest moisture, Z1 has the least moisture and Z3 has moderate moisture level.
    As Z2 has good moisture level so no water would be transmitted in that zone. Hence,
    sensor nodes in Z2 will enter idle state followed by the sleep state for a long
    period of time by exploiting eDRX in NBIoT. This will save water along with energy.
    In addition to this UL traffic will also be reduced, thereby reducing the congestion
    impact also. FIGURE 19. Proposed architecture for energy efficient precision agriculture
    using NBIoT–toward green communication. Show All There is another aspect to be
    considered while designing this scenario i.e. land orientation. Hence this use
    case study is divided into two sub problems: a: Uniform Land Surface When land
    has uniform orientation like in the plain area, there will be no water logging
    problem. Therefore, farm/agriculture land can be irrigated by classifying the
    moisture data as discussed previously. Thus watering of the field by the proposed
    pioneered way could avoid the wastage of water. Also in the plain area, the orientation
    of land is more or less uniform, thus the pattern of power consumption would not
    be much diverse. This can be depicted by thermal pattern analysis using drones
    and satellite captured thermal images. b: Non-Uniform Land Surface Another case
    is when agriculture land has non-uniform orientation like in hilly areas, which
    leads to the uneven power consumption of devices. As in some case, eNB will allocate
    the resource to the sensor via NBIoT using direct path whereas in some cases using
    an indirect path. In our proposed approach we have not only considered direct/indirect
    resource allocation but in addition to this, the overlap condition will also be
    considered, where one region overlaps with another region. As shown in Fig. 20
    regions R1 and R2, describes the overlap region. Here the sensor S3, S5, S9, S21,
    S14 suffers from Inter-Interference. FIGURE 20. Proposed architecture for energy
    efficient precision agriculture using NBIoT based on thermal pattern analysis
    (TPA). Show All Hence the power consumption pattern will be diverse for node present
    in this region and node present outside of this region which in turn would affect
    the network lifetime. In addition to this SNR will also get influenced by interference
    within inter-interference region. 2) Mathematical Analysis for Energy Efficient
    Smart Agriculture Sensor nodes SN 1 , SN 2 , SN 3 ,……., SN n are deployed in the
    field and as per proposed model, it is assumed CH of disjoint sets of sensors
    (CH1, CH2, and CH3) will communicate with the processing unit (PU). Further, this
    PU would communicate with BS. Assume that using NBIoT technology k PRB’s (physical
    resource blocks) are required. As the signal propagates from SN i to NBIoT node
    path loss (PL) will occur. PL will depend on the position of sensor. If the sensor
    is placed under the soil or underground, then soil would absorb the signal and
    hence leads to path loss which can be evaluated as follows P ∗ C = P real C −j(
    P dipolarloss + σ 2πf P D ) (3) View Source Here P ∗ C specifies the complex-permittivity
    (cp), P real C denotes the real part of cp, P dipolarloss is due to Relaxation
    and P D specifies the relative dielectric-permittivity [138], [139]. The permittivity
    of soil can be affected importantly by parameters like water content, frequency
    of signal, soil composition and soil conductivity. Hence it is difficult to measure
    the soil permittivity accurately. Path loss can be calculated using equation (4)
    where T p is Transmission power, T g Transmission gain, R g receiver gain, PL
    fs is path loss due to free space propagation of signal and PL M is path loss
    due to medium, α is path loss between NBIoT node and eNB.1 PL= T p + T g + R g
    + PL fs − PL M +α (4) View Source Further path loss due to medium can be evaluated
    as follows [139] PL M = WD s + TL s (5) View Source Where WD s is path loss due
    to difference in wavelength of signal in soil in comparison of free space and
    TL s is transmission loss. If the sensor is placed above the surface (of ground),
    then plants would act as scatterers and thereby the path loss can be evaluated
    using equation (6) PL(d)=PL( d 0 )+10mlog( d d 0 )+ OH T i +α (6) View Source
    Here OH T i represent the obstacle height at time iε {1, 2, 3}, where i=1 specifies
    the phase, when seeds are just sawn, so no plant would be there at that time so
    no obstacle. Likewise for i=2 , specifies that plant has started budding up so
    it will have certain height. Similarly for i=3 specifies, plant has fully grown
    to its full height. Thus corresponding to height of plant, obstacle path loss
    parameter would increase. Here d 0 specifies the reference distance between sensing
    node and NBIoT node (Refer Fig. 20.). Here α specifies the path loss between NBIoT
    node and eNB. Hence the SINR of the sensing node can be expressed as SINR= S T
    G k N+ I T (7) View Source Where N is thermal noise, I T total interference, S
    T represents the transmitted signal power and G k is the channel gain between
    sensor node k and NBIoT node. We then express the total interference as I T =
    I interzone + I intrazone + I Soilreflectivity (8) View Source Interference that
    occurs within zone, between zones and also due to soil reflectivity. Further channel
    capacity (C) can be evaluated based on Shannon theorem as follows C= Blog 2 (1+
    S k G k N+ I T ) (9) View Source Based on these above formulations we conclude
    that capacity of a sensor deployed in the agricultural area will be adversely
    affected by the interference generated by the adjacent sensor nodes, scatterers,
    etc. a: Energy Consumption Evaluation For electing cluster head out of n sensor
    node for each disjoint set of sensing nodes. Each node power level is to be determined
    and one with highest power level is selected. Power level get deteriorates due
    to energy dissipation. Hence we first evaluate the total energy consumed due to
    various factors for each node (The energy model used here is given [140].) E C
    Total =EC Sensing + EC Processing+ EC Transmission + EC Sleeping + EC Switching
    (10) View Source Where energy consumption during sensing could be evaluated using
    equation (11) EC Sensing = EC Sample ∗n (11) View Source Here EC Sample specifies
    the energy consumption during sampling of each sample, n represents the no of
    samples. Similarly, energy consumption during transmission ( EC Transmission )
    depends on supply voltage S v , current I and time T required for transmission
    EC Transmission = S v ∗I∗T (12) View Source Energy consumed during switching from
    active to sleep state [141] EC Switching = T Swt ∗( PC Active + PC Sleep )/2 (13)
    View Source Hence total energy consumption can be evaluated (using eq. 10) and
    using Relation E= P*T, power levels can be evaluated for each node, where T will
    include time for switching, sleeping, active, sensing, and processing. Hence CH
    can be selected for by comparing the power of all the nodes. Here another aspect
    must also be included that is if the node has acted as CH earlier also then. Hence
    we evaluate the energy consumption when node act as CH, ( EC CH ) . This will
    depend on length of message L MSG and energy consumed by transmitter if sending
    the message to processing point (PP) or energy consumed when receiver receives
    data by PP [142]. EC CH = L MSG ∗ EC TX/RX ∗ D PP (14) View Source Hence total
    energy consumption equation if node acted as CH could be rewritten as E C Total
    =EC Sensing + EC Processing+ EC Transmission + EC Sleeping + EC Switching + EC
    CH (15) View Source Finally energy efficiency EE can be evaluated as ratio of
    total energy consumed ,EC TOTAL and energy of sensor at time of deployment ,E
    TOTAL EE= EC TOTAL / E TOTAL (16) View Source Hence using the proposed approach
    energy efficiency can be improved as EC TOTAL will be reduced by exploiting the
    eDRX of sensing nodes. B. Proposed Technique for Smart Health: E2AHMS 1) Case
    Study: Energy Efficient Health Monitoring System for Green Communication IoT provides
    a big platform to solve medical issues, in real time scenario. Integration of
    IoT with Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) is gaining much of the momentum and
    currently being used for health monitoring of soldiers at battlefields, patients
    in hospitals, elderly people who could not visit hospitals very often, etc. The
    performance of WBAN (i.e. reliability, delay, power efficiency) chiefly depends
    on the physical and medium access control layer. Moreover, as most of the IoT-BAN
    devices are battery operated, thus power optimization will greatly impact their
    lifetime and performance. In this context, this paper is proposing a novel approach
    namely “Energy Efficient Adaptive Health Monitoring System” E2AHMS. This approach
    will work in an energy efficient manner by adaptively distributing the transmission
    power required to monitor the patient. In our proposed Health Monitoring system
    three prospective conditions have been considered Stable, Mono-Stable, Relatively
    mobile (Fig. 21). FIGURE 21. Proposed health monitoring system using NBIoT–toward
    green communication. Show All Case B.1: Stable: When a patient lying on the bed
    i.e. stationary condition Case B.2: Mono-Stable: When a patient is sitting or
    standing. Case B.3: Relatively mobile: When a patient will be moving either by
    walking or using a wheelchair. Our proposed approach E2AHMS can not only be used
    for patients who require continuous monitoring, but also for health monitoring
    of person who are fit but wants to keep track of their health to prevent themselves
    from severe disease. As in both the cases, network life time will play a vital
    role, which can be increased or improved by using proposed optimized energy efficient
    algorithm. E2AHMS will work in an energy efficient manner by adaptively using
    the transmission , power required during different postural mobility (considered
    before). To understand this it is required to first understand the difference
    in energy requirement during different cases under consideration. CASE B.1 (STABLE):
    While sleeping it is very likely that the sensors will have LOS communication.
    Hence, Body Area Network will be in stable state. Thus power required for transmission
    would be least and hence energy required. As path loss would be minimum between
    sensing nodes and NBIoT coordinator node. Thus energy consumed during sleeping
    state E c_s_st i can be given by summation of energy consumption due to factors
    such as: due to switching from one state to another (On, Off, sleep, idle, Active,
    idle) E st_tr i , due to circuit of sensing device E Crkt i , energy consumption
    due to processing of signals E Proc i , energy consumption due to transmission
    of signal E Trans i , due to acting as relay/connecting node for other sensors
    E connecting_node i and due to various delays (queuing, propagation, transmission)
    E Delays i . E c_s_st i = E st_tr i + E Crkt i + E Proc i + E Trans i + E connecting_node
    i + E Delays i (17) View Source CASE B.2 (MONO-STABLE STATE): In this case the
    patient could be in a sitting posture or moving his arms or having food. Hence
    LOS would not be there between sensing nodes. It is very likely that obstacles
    might interfere with the path of signal transmission thus shadowing would lead
    to multipath loss and hence energy consumption will be more during this posture.
    Energy consumption during mono-stable state E c_ms_st i , can be evaluated by
    equation (18) E c_ms_st i = E st_tr i + E Crkt i + E Proc i + E Trans i + E connecting_node
    i + E Delays i + E obst i (18) View Source Here E obst i specifies the energy
    consumed due to obstacles/shadowing/multipath effect. CASE B.3 (RELATIVELY MOBILE):
    In this state, the patient will be walking or moving with the help of wheel chair
    or might be doing some routine activities. Therefore it is more likely that NLOS
    transmission will occur due to various reasons such as obstacles in the surrounding,
    links between sensors would change rapidly due to body movement, etc. Hence more
    loss of information and thereby more energy consumption. Energy consumption during
    mobile state could be given by equation 19. E c_m_st i = E st_tr i + E Crkt i
    + E Proc i + E Trans i + E connectin_node i + E Delays i +n. E obst i + E relink
    i (19) View Source Here E relink i denotes the energy consumed due to Relinking
    between sensor nodes and gateway. Thus, it is clear from the above discussion
    that due to multipath effect and different channel conditions, different postural
    movement leads to different energy consumption. Therefore in proposed technique
    E2AHMS, depending on postural movement level transmission power will be used adaptively
    which can be determined using graph theory. Whereas conventionally data was transmitted
    with equal power without considering LOS communication is possible or not and
    also channel conditions are good or not. Hence our proposed approach will be an
    energy efficient approach for Health monitoring application. This proposed approach
    is also supported by mathematical formulation. 2) Mathematical Formulation Multiple
    sensors are positioned on the human body I={i1,i2,i3….,in} (20) View Source Here
    each sensor has a coordinate point i1=( x 1 , y 1 ) i2=( x 2 , y 2 ) (21.1) (21.2)
    View Source Path Loss Analysis As the signal propagates through WBAN this gets
    attenuated due to multiple factors such as reflection, diffraction, refraction,
    fading, etc. To analyze path loss in on-body WBAN, IEEE P802.15, 2009 [143] has
    given a path loss model. Using the same as a reference, path loss can be evaluated
    during different postural mobility. Case B.1 (Stable/Sleeping State): PL dB =
    PL d 0 +10n log 10 d/ d 0 + S dB (22) View Source Here d 0 is reference the distance
    from NBIoT coordinator. S dB , is shadowing factor added to it due to movement
    of body parts. However, in the sleeping state, it would be negligible. Case B.2
    (Mono-Stable/Sitting State): During this state, signal could fade due to various
    obstacle such as table while having food/medicine, legs under the chair or below
    the table. Moreover due to the movement of body parts effect of shadowing would
    be high. Hence path loss would be more in comparison to the sleeping state. PL
    dB = PL d 0 +10n log 10 d/ d 0 +( S dB + F 1 + F 2 ) (23) View Source Here F 1
    + F 2 , is addition PL due to factors such as obstacles, interference, surroundings
    Case B.3 (Mobile State): During this state person would be moving from one place
    to another thus link with access point could change very quickly (From one floor
    to another, one room to another, walking, etc.). The signal would attenuate n
    times more in relative mobile state than Sitting/Mono-Stable state. PL dB = PL
    d 0 +10n log 10 d/ d 0 +n( S dB + F 1 + F 2 + F 3 ) (24) View Source Here F 3
    specifies an additional factor of multipath propagation of signal. As PL is difference
    of transmitted power and received power PL= P Tx − P RX (25) View Source Thus
    received power during different case studies can be evaluated as follows: Case
    B.1: P S_ST Rx (dB)= P Tx − PL S_ST dB (26.1) View Source Case B.2: P MS_ST Rx
    (dB)= P Tx − PL MS_ST dB (26.2) View Source Case B.3: P M_ST Rx (dB)= P Tx − PL
    M_ST dB (26.3) View Source In the conventional system, same transmission power
    is used for all the cases whether required or not, but in the proposed technique
    E2AHMS transmission power would be used adaptively depending on postural mobility.
    Hence power will be used in an optimized way. SNR can be evaluated for different
    considered case studies using received power SNR cas e i = RecivedSignal_power
    P cas e i Rx Noise_Power (27) View Source Thereby channel capacity ( C cas e i
    ) for considered cases {i=B.1, B.2, B.3} using Shannon theorem could be evaluated
    for considered case studies as C cas e i =B(1+ SNR cas e i ) (28) View Source
    Hence Energy efficiency can be evaluated using equation EE cas e i = Channe l
    cas e i P cas e i Tx ∗100% (29) View Source It is clear from the above equation
    the high mobility would result in more energy consumption. Hence using the proposed
    technique power will be saved and thereby could enhance the battery lifetime.
    Thus an energy efficient solution. Using the same theme of the proposed approach
    real time hardware implementation is done which is discussed in next section.
    C. Real Time Hardware Implementation for Proposed Work 1) Hardware System Model
    Fig. 22 gives an overview of proposed approach real time implementation. Here
    two axis accelerometer sensors and a pulse sensor is used for real time analysis.
    To determine the patient postural mobility accelerometer sensors are placed on
    his right hand and right leg. Apart from this a pulse sensor is used to measure
    the pulse rate of the patient. Further, in order to send the health information
    to eNB in energy efficient way. Our proposed approach will differentiate between
    different postural (Fig. 22 (a), (b), (c), (d), (e)) using edge computing. Such
    that energy is utilized in an efficiently way by using an optimal amount of transmission
    power of device as suggested in proposed approach to transmit information to eNB.
    Hereafter the health information is forwarded to the centralized cloud and then
    to application server and finally to doctor, who tracks the record of patient,
    to avoid unwanted situation. Finally, doctor would prescribe some medicine if
    required otherwise the message will be sent to user that he is fine. FIGURE 22.

    Interface 4) Implementation The first step is to setup the connections of all
    the desired sensors with Arduino Uno. Thereafter the Arduino Uno is connected
    to development system that has integrated development environment (IDE) with USB.
    Once the setup is done the code developed for considered case (stable, mono stable
    and walking) is uploaded to Arduino Uno. Hereafter the data is collected related
    to different postural mobility of person and processed by comparing against the
    threshold value to determine the postural mobility level. Fig. 24, shows the plot
    of variation in amplitude due to movement of hand and leg (specifically) in developed
    code. Once the movement is determined thereafter the health information like pulse
    rate, etc. is sent via NBIoT with required transmitted power to eNB. Hereafter
    the health information is processed and corresponding actions are than advised
    to the patients. FIGURE 23. Interface of real time health monitoring setup. Show
    All FIGURE 24. Screenshot of plot with arduino IDE. Show All 5) Performance Analysis
    As per our proposed architecture, we have done the performance analysis on the
    basis of a real-time hardware implementation for healthcare monitoring system
    with all possible case studies. We have deployed sensors on body parts of patients
    to fetch the information regarding postural mobility as shown in Fig 22. (a),
    (b), (c), (d), (e). All the data regarding different postural movements saved
    in the database, which is then processed and compared at the same time. The postural
    movement is observed for 500 sec from 926sec to 1426 sec (Fig 25 describes the
    variation of amplitude due to different postural movement.) FIGURE 25. A Plot
    of variation in amplitude vs Time corresponding to Hand and foot movement during
    different postural mobility, to differentiate between transmission-power to be
    used (Here blue and Red depicts hand movement whereas Green and orange depicts
    the leg movement). Show All Approximately for 94 sec the person has kept his body
    in sleeping condition as shown in Fig. 22 (a),(b), it has been observed that during
    this period, a variation of the different sensor output is low and smooth, output
    amplitude is far below as compared to a threshold value. Hereafter the person
    changed his posture to sitting posture Fig. 22(c) and maintained it for 80 sec.
    For this posture, it was observed that variation is high in comparison to sleeping
    posture, but get stable after a certain time. Hereafter person changed his posture
    from sitting to standing (Fig. 22(d), (e)) and did some movement of hand and leg.
    It can be easily seen that variation is high and fluctuating, some irregular spikes
    appeared in the process. On the basis of performance analysis, we have observed
    that power optimization in all these case studies is very important and because
    this real time analysis aligns with our proposed approach E2AHMS. Hence power
    can be optimized with fair resource allocation to achieve the better quality of
    service is possible through our proposed approach. Conclusion IoT is reforming
    technical industry. This reformation will aid in struggling with global challenges
    that are budding due to depletion of natural resources, inflated food demand,
    scarcity of water, etc. Where on one hand IoT is giving hope for resourceful life
    but on other hand, it will play a crucial role in inflating carbon footprint.
    Hence solutions must be given to reduce carbon emission. In this study recent
    work related to energy efficiency techniques has been surveyed and discussed.
    In contribution toward green-IoT, two novel energy efficient approaches have been
    proposed - ZTPA for smart agriculture and E2AHMS for smart healthcare using NBIoT.
    NBIoT is a new licensed radio technology that guarantees to provide a cost effective,
    reliable, and low power solution. It can coexist with the existing LTE cellular
    networks therefore no new infrastructure is required to be setup from scratch,
    hence installation cost is low. This paper provides a detailed technical view
    of NBIoT and its state-of-the-art. To spur advance research and speed up the extensive
    use of the NBIoT systems the research challenges and open issues of NBIoT are
    also discussed. Appendix A list of current research projects based on IoT is presented
    in table 9 In addition to this, an abbreviation list is given in table 10. TABLE

    Advances in technology are not only changing the world around us but also driving
    the wireless industry to develop the next generation of network technology. There
    is a lot of buzz building over the advent of 5G that will facilitate the entire
    planet through continuous and ubiquitous communication connecting anybody to anything,
    anywhere, anytime, and anyhow regardless of the device, service, network, or geographical
    existence. 5G will also prove to be a paradigm shift including high carrier frequencies
    with massive bandwidths, having a large number of antennas, and with an extreme
    base station and device densities. In this paper, we investigate the potential
    beneficiaries of 5G and identify the use-cases, where 5G can make an impact. In
    particular, we consider three main use-cases: vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication,
    drones, and healthcare. We explore and highlight the problems and deficiencies
    of current cellular technologies with respect to these use-cases and identify
    how 5G will overcome those deficiencies. We also identified the open research
    problems and provide possible future directions to cope with those issues. Topic:
    Roadmap to 5G: Rising to the Challenge An overview of V2X, Drones and Healthcare
    Use-cases with respect to 5G. Published in: IEEE Access ( Volume: 7) Page(s):

    10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2905347 Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction
    Advances in technology are not only changing the world around us but also driving
    the wireless industry to develop the next generation of network technology. Over
    the last 25 years, mobile technologies such as 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th generation
    have focused on improving the speed and efficiency of wireless networks, but still
    there are some distinct application areas where current wireless networks are
    struggling to deliver. These areas include V2X communication (and particularly
    Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication), wireless
    healthcare services, utility applications and industrial automation, consumer,
    virtual and augmented reality services, and primary broadband access services
    etc. [1], [2]. It is expected that the new technologies (5G) will investigate
    the issues within the aforementioned areas and will also address the performance
    criteria for low latency, high speed, enhanced reliability, peak throughput per
    connection, system spectral efficiency, connection and capacity density, and low
    power consumption [3], [4]. It is anticipated that 5G will be the main developmental
    technology that will lead to a step-change in the capability of mobile networks
    particularly around new radio access technology, higher frequencies usage, network
    re-architecting, antenna improvements (beam forming and massive Multiple-Input
    Multiple-Output (MIMO)), ultra-low-latency, and ultra-high reliability. A report
    published by Nokia Communication [5] claims that from 2020 to 2030 there will
    be an increase of 10K times more traffic that needs to be carried out through
    mobile broadband technologies. Such a huge volume of data traffic will lead to
    the design of 5G architectures in a way that will enable deployment in a new and
    higher frequencies band. Some other factors such as ultra-low latency (less than
    one millisecond), reduced power consumption and increased battery life in terms
    of smartphones, tablets and laptops will also be considered in the design of 5G
    architecture. An overview of the key requirements for 5G is summarized in Figure
    1. Based on these requirements, we propose taxonomy of future potential 5G use-cases
    as: (i) Ultra-high reliable use-cases, (ii) Ultra-low latency use-cases and (iii)
    Ultra-reliable and low-latency use-cases. In terms of reliability, we identify
    disaster management using drones, and surveillance operations; in terms of low-latency,
    we explore the automotive industry (with a focus on assisted and autonomous driving),
    augmented/virtual reality, serious gaming, and smart grids; while in terms of
    both reliability and low-latency use-cases, we discuss healthcare and wearables,
    and industry automation. FIGURE 1. Key requirements for 5G communication. Show
    All The main contribution of this survey is to provide the reader with state-of-the-art
    technological trends in terms of 5G communication and highlight the limitations
    and problems of existing cellular technologies. We consider three main future
    use-cases of 5G communication: V2X communication, drones, and healthcare. In terms
    of V2X communication, we present an exhaustive review of the up-to-date research
    progress with respect to V2V, Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P), V2I, and Intra-Vehicle
    (IV) communication along with their key application areas. We also identify the
    key limitations of existing technologies in all of these sub-use-cases of V2X
    communication. Similarly, in terms of drones, first we provide an overview of
    single Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) deployment, multiple UAV deployment and collision
    avoidance. Then we present some of the key application areas of drones for critical
    infrastructure development using 5G communication. A comparative analysis of control
    latency in terms of 4G and 5G communication is also presented to inform the reader
    of the latest trends. Finally, in terms of healthcare, we mainly consider online
    consultation, online health monitoring, remote diagnosis of time-critical medical
    events and mobile robotic surgeries. Table 1 provides a list of the acronyms and
    their corresponding definitions that have been used throughout the paper. TABLE
    1 Acronym List The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II provides
    a literature review of the existing work. Section III investigates V2X communication,
    Section IV considers drone applications, Section V addresses the healthcare use-case,
    Section VI provide an overview of the open research challenges and future directions,
    while Section VII draws the conclusions. SECTION II. Related Work Masini et al.
    [6] provide an overview of economic motivations, requirements, and enabling technologies
    along with the important international rules and regulations for short-range V2V-based
    vehicular networks and on-board vehicles connectivity respectively. The authors
    mainly concentrated on four different aspects to differentiate their work from
    others in the same area i.e. short-range V2V-based applications, design choices
    and factors for wireless enabling technologies, economic motivations for on-board
    wireless technologies and mandatory international rules for on-board connectivity.
    Similarly, Boban et al. [7] analyzed the requirements and use-cases in terms of
    5G V2X and identified the gaps of the existing communication technologies. The
    authors also provide guidelines on how the existing and 5G technologies will try
    to overcome those gaps. In terms of drone communication, Shakhatreh et al. [8]
    present a survey on the UAV challenges including charging, collision & swarming,
    and network & security with respect to civil applications. The authors highlighted
    different open issues and provide the possible ways of how these issues can be
    approached. Moreover, Li et al. [9] provide an overview of 5G technologies that
    can be incorporated in UAV communication. 5G and UAV integrated architectures
    for space-air-ground scenario were presented and a variety of open research challenges
    were identified. Based on this integration, the authors also provide a state of
    the art overview of the research progress at different layers (physical layer,
    network layer etc.). Furthermore, with respect to healthcare use-case, West [10]
    provides an overview of how 5G differs from earlier generations and highlights
    how 5G will make an impact in healthcare applications. The author investigated
    how 5G will enable new systems of care delivery, and how the application areas
    like imaging, diagnostics, and treatment can be improved through 5G to provide
    quality healthcare facilities to the people. Also, Latif et al. [11] presented
    how 5G and other technologies (Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence
    (AI), and big data) will revolutionize healthcare system and provide an overview
    of how Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can be integrated with healthcare systems
    to detect the anomalies and to ensure that no medical problems has occurred. The
    authors also investigated how remote consultation and remote surgery can be enabled
    through telemedicine and e-health. All of the above and many other surveys discuss
    the overall technological trends and their limitations in terms of V2X, drones
    and healthcare, but none particularly concentrates on limitations of existing
    cellular technologies. Also, in many surveys only a single use-case is discussed
    along with their limitations and future directions, but no survey considered more
    than one use-cases in the same paper. The main purpose of this work is to identify
    limitations of the existing cellular technologies and to provide a possible solution
    for each of these limitations in terms of V2X, drone communication and healthcare.
    Similarly, we consider three main use-cases of 5G communication instead of just
    one use-case. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to provide a
    comprehensive survey on three main use-cases of 5G in order to identify the problems
    of current technologies and to suggest the possible solutions based on 5G communication.
    SECTION III. Vehicle-To-Everything (V2X) Communication According to a report published
    by the U.S. Department of Transportation and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
    in [12], 37,461 people were killed in motor vehicle crashes in 2016, an increase
    of 5.6% and 14.4% when compared to 2015 and 2014 respectively. Similarly, according
    to the UK Department for Transport [13], a total of 27,130 people were severely
    injured in road accidents out of which 1,710 lost their lives. On the other hand,
    traffic congestion is investigated by Texas A&M Transportation Institute in a
    report published in [14], and according to their investigation, the total delay
    time will increase to 8.3 billion hours by 2020 resulting a congestion cost of
    almost 192 billion U.S. Dollars. To address these issues, new solutions with high
    reliability and low latency are required that can use the currently available
    resources in an efficient way in order to save lives, reduce congestion and lessen
    the negative impact of transportation on the environment. V2X communication mainly
    refers to the set of standards and technologies that will enable the vehicles
    to interact with the current infrastructure including roads and road users. An
    overall architecture of V2X communication based on 5G technologies is shown in
    Figure 2. These will potentially be based on tested networking protocols and technologies
    rather than relying exclusively on the hardware [15], [16]. Boban et al. [7] proposed
    an architecture for V2X communication based on future 5G technologies. The authors
    claim that the proposed architecture can lead to an accident-free connected automated
    driving and can fulfill the requirements for all V2X use case categories. In the
    following sub-sections, we will elaborate different cases of V2X communication
    with respect to challenges faced in 4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE) and will address
    the absolute solutions enabled by 5G technologies. FIGURE 2. V2X communication
    infrastructure using different technologies. Show All A. Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V)
    Communication Driverless and autonomous cars have increased in popularity because
    of their increased applicability for commercial and emergency services. In order
    to fulfill such services, connected and autonomous cars/vehicles require continuous
    access to sensory data from which the cars can perform advanced trajectory planning
    and complex high-speed maneuvers [17]. For short-term trajectory decisions, the
    car can use on-board sensor information, but for long-term decisions, the car
    needs data and information from vehicles in near proximity. Hence, the exchange
    of sensor data is an important factor that requires a reliable connection between
    vehicles subject to strict quality-of-service (QoS) constraints [18], [19]. According
    to Lu et al. [20], connected vehicles are wireless connectivity-enabled vehicles
    that can communicate with each other and with the infrastructure, establishing
    interactions between vehicle-to-sensor on-board, vehicle-to-vehicle, vehicle-to-road
    infrastructure, and vehicle-to-internet. Based on these interactions, the vehicles
    can take safe dynamic decisions, can enhance their situational awareness, and
    can provide an information-rich and safer environment to other motorists and/or
    pedestrians. Mavromatis et al. [17] propose a multi-link association scheme for
    millimeter wave (mmWave) V2V communication in order to better utilize the channel
    and to prioritize sharing the sensory data for emergency connected and autonomous
    vehicles (e-CAVs). By using the same method, the authors also address the issue
    of obstacle avoidance maneuvers and advance trajectory planning in terms of e-CAVs
    as compared to regular CAVs (r-CAVs). Also, the Stable Fixtures (SF) matching
    game technique is proposed to formulate a more comprehensive many-to-many link
    association scheme establishing bidirectional links based on unique characteristics
    of each connected vehicles. The SF problem originates from a practical situation,
    where players play against each other in a chess tournament in order to construct
    a set of fixtures having different matches. Each match has two players, and a
    player can be involved in more than one match while fulfilling the condition that
    he/she cannot exceed their stable capacity [21]. Similarly, Chen et al. [22] propose
    rough set theory to formulate the lane-changing rules to enhance the decision-making
    process of autonomous vehicles in a complex urban environment, to reduce the influence
    of week interdependency data and to extract the driver’s decision-making rules.
    The system was designed over a virtual urban traffic environment using Prescan
    simulation software developed for advanced driver assistant systems and intelligent
    vehicle systems [23]. A general overview of the car-changing process is shown
    in Figure 3, where the green car (Car1) is the subject Car that wants to change
    lane, while Car2 and Car3 are the interfering cars. Based on simulation results,
    the authors concluded that the Car1 driver’s decision-making behavior during the
    lane-changing process is subject to the relative distance between the subject
    car and the interfering Car3, and the relative velocity between the subject Car
    and the leading Car2. FIGURE 3. Lane-changing process. Show All Some of the key
    application areas of V2V communication are discussed as follows: V2V communication
    enhances driving safety and traffic efficiency along with information or entertainment
    provision to drivers in a number of use-cases such as traffic safety, traffic
    efficiency, infotainment and payments etc. In terms of traffic safety, V2V communication
    disseminates warning messages on several occasions e.g. entering intersections
    or departing highways, hazardous locations such as reporting accidents ahead,
    and obstacle discovery, forward collision and pre-cash warnings, and favoring
    police cars, fire fighter vehicles, and ambulances [24], [25]. Similarly, in terms
    of traffic efficiency, V2V communication enhances the route guidance and navigation
    system, automating traffic intersection control, optimizing the green light speed,
    and providing information about variable speed limits. This will help to reduce
    traffic congestion and will lead to reduce the energy consumption [24], [26].
    Moreover, infotainment and payment services such as on-board internet access,
    toll collection and parking payment etc. provide comfort services to the vehicle
    owner and also avoid congestion caused by toll collection. B. Vehicle-to-Pedestrian
    (V2P) Communication V2P is one of the most important applications of vehicular
    networks providing safety to pedestrians through wireless communication. Bagheri
    et al. [27] addressed the issue of V2P communication in order to improve the safety
    of pedestrians. The authors proposed a method based on the existing infrastructure
    that enables the development of V2P road safety applications. On pedestrian side,
    3G and LTE were utilized as cellular technologies to provide connectivity to the
    individual’s smartphone, while on vehicular side, an on-board SIM card was used
    for same purpose. In case of any issue with on-board SIM, driver’s smartphone
    was considered as an alternative for connectivity purposes. The proposed adaptive
    multi-level approach was designed based on mobile cloud computing to compute and
    process all the data. Road users including vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists
    send updated messages containing speed, location and direction information to
    the cloud-based server. Two types of safety messages were identified: (i) cooperative
    awareness messages which are time triggered (periodic) beacons that carry position
    information and (ii) decentralized environmental notification messages which are
    event triggered and carry hazard warnings [27], [28]. In situations that are risky
    and may lead to a collision, road users will send updated messages in a periodic
    fashion at 100ms intervals. The authors conclude that their proposed method provides
    a risk-free environment for pedestrians and could also reduce the energy consumption
    of user equipments. Similarly, Rahimian et al. [29] examined how the action of
    a pedestrian engaged in composing or reading an SMS can be influenced by sending
    mobile device warnings when approaching to an unsafe road crossing. The authors
    specifically assess the effects of texting on pedestrian road crossing behavior
    and the effectiveness of those warnings in reducing unsafe road crossing. They
    project that texting reduces pedestrian awareness of traffic and prejudices their
    road-crossing decision-making. Warning alarms help redirect their attention towards
    traffic and also reduce the probability of risky road crossing and collision.
    The authors use an approach entitled “Between-subjects design” considering three
    different types of conditions: (i) texting, (ii) warning, and (iii) control. In
    terms of texting, the participants continuously receive and respond to the text
    messages during the entire road-crossing session, while in the case of warning,
    the participants also receive an auditory alarm from a cell phone when they enter
    to a situation that is classified as unsafe. In the control condition, the participants
    neither receive any text nor respond to any message but hold the smartphone during
    the entire road-crossing session. The authors conclude that the proposed technique
    improves road-crossing decisions of pedestrians which are busy in text messages.
    They also indicate that further investigation is required in situations when the
    participants receive the warning messages, but fail to respond to those messages,
    and continue to cross roads in an unsafe manner [29]. Moreover, Coeugnet et al.
    [30] assessed the performance and effectiveness of a vibrotactile wristband device
    by helping older pedestrians in safer street-crossing decisions. The study was
    conducted in a simulated two-way traffic environment with a street-crossing task
    where twenty younger-old (age 60-70), twenty older-old (age 70-80), and 17 younger
    adults (age 20-45) with and without a vibrotactile wristband participated. The
    test was run on a virtual platform to check the device’s ability to accurately
    emulate all the required communication between the vehicle, infrastructure and
    pedestrian. The authors claim that the haptic device partly compensates for some
    age-related gap-acceptance difficulties and reduces the street-crossing risks
    for all users. They also conjecture that the device will be beneficial for all
    ages but particularly for older participants and specifically for older women
    who have difficulties in street-crossing. The device also helps to reduce the
    number of decisions that may lead to collisions in situations when vehicles approach
    rapidly [30].The authors advise some educational and training programs by using
    virtual reality tools to educate pedestrians about their vulnerabilities and how
    to cope with those in order to reduce crash statistics [31]–[33]. C. Vehicle-To-Infrastructure
    (V2I) Communication Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) is basically a communication
    model that allows a vehicle to share information with roadside components such
    as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) readers and cameras, traffic lights,
    lane markers, streetlights and parking meters etc. V2I is a bidirectional wireless
    communication where data is transferred from infrastructure to vehicle and vice
    versa over an ad hoc network [34]. According to Péter et al. [24], some of the
    key components for a minimal V2I system should contain: Vehicle on-board unit
    (OBU), Roadside Unit (RSU), and a safe communication channel. OBU is comprised
    of a radio transceiver such as a dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) system,
    a GPS system and a processor and facilitates communication between the vehicles
    and RSUs and other vehicles in the near proximity. RSUs are composed of the same
    radio transceiver i.e. DSRC, an application processor and an interface to the
    V2I communication network. These are usually mounted on interchanges, intersections,
    and patrol stations. RSUs are mainly responsible for private data transfer and
    message prioritization management to and from the vehicle. Messages are prioritized
    based on their criticality - local and V2V safety applications have the highest
    priority, public and private network applications have lower priority, while entertainment
    messages have the lowest priority [24]. Similarly, Ndashimye et al. [35] conducted
    an extensive survey on the effectiveness of V2I communication in the context of
    5G networks that supports the co-existence of multi-tier heterogeneous wireless
    networks with various radio access technologies (RATs). The authors initially
    studied the V2I communication standards such as DSRC derived from the 802.x family,
    Wireless access in vehicular environments (WAVE), and LTE-A. DSRC uses a licensed
    spectrum at 5.9 GHz with seven channels of 10 MHz bandwidth (5.850-5.925). Out
    of the seven channels, the control channel in the center is dedicated for safety
    applications, two at the end are reserved for special purposes, while the rest
    are the service channels available for both safety and non-safety applications
    [36], [37]. WAVE or IEEE802.11p integrate both the MAC and physical layer, use
    orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) in order to divide the signal
    into multiple narrowband signals and define two classes of devices: OBU and RSU
    [36]. The authors also mention some of the key application areas of V2I such as
    traffic efficiency and management, entertainment and personalized applications
    and safety-related applications. The primary focus of the study is V2I safety
    applications that may lead to either reducing or even avoiding crashes by increasing
    driver awareness via different warning messages wirelessly communicated between
    vehicles and roadside infrastructure [35]. Some of the key recommendations from
    the proposed studies are: (i) efficient network discovery, (ii) underlying network
    selection, (iii) seamless and reliable vertical handover, (iv) QoS requirements,
    (v) dissemination of data, (vi) security and (vii) an upper layer communication
    protocol suite in order to support seamless vertical handover in 5G heterogeneous
    network environments. Moreover, Ndashimye et al. [38] propose a network selection
    method that applies the knowledge of mobility data and network load information
    in order to carry out an effective handover for V2I communication over multi-tier
    heterogeneous networks. Some of the key parameters such as relative direction
    index, residence time index, proximity index, and network load index are identified
    in order to select the best candidate network for vehicle with a judicious coverage.
    The algorithms were tested in an OPNET simulator by developing a dual mode vehicle
    OBU fortified with both Wi-Fi and LTE-A cards in order to evaluate and validate
    the proposed system model. The performance of the proposed model was compared
    with the conventional method and access network discovery and selection function-assisted
    handover methods. The authors concluded that the proposed approach can reduce
    the unnecessary handover up to 50%, mean handover latency up to 40%, higher throughput
    up to 50% and lower end-to-end delay up to 43% with respect to the conventional
    handover method. D. Intra-Vehicle (IV) Communication Wireless interconnections
    between sensors and other devices within the vehicle, such as sensors for detecting
    road conditions and driver’s fatigue, monitoring tire pressure and water temperature
    in the cooling system and advanced sensors for autonomous control are currently
    being investigated [20], [39]. Along with these, a number of other sensors and
    processors such as Antilock Braking Systems and Electronic Stability Control monitor
    a vehicle’s internal performance and dynamics, while camera, radar, and ultrasonic
    sensors sense the environment around the vehicle and keep the driver up to-date
    with his surroundings. Tuohy et al. [39] explore the physical layer technologies
    for Next Generation Ethernet networks with some middleware technologies in terms
    of automotive industries. They also categorize automotive network traffic and
    classify it with respect to control data, safety data, infotainment data and driver
    assistance cameras. Control data is further divided into low-bandwidth control
    applications and real-time control applications. Systems that control non-safety
    critical aspects of the vehicle such as electronically controlled mirrors and
    seats fall into the category of low-bandwidth control applications, while suspension
    and braking systems, ABS and traction control lie under real-time control applications.
    Safety data assists drivers by using the built-in driver safety systems such as
    adaptive cruise control, parking sensors and night-time pedestrian detection infrared
    sensors. GPS, audio and visual entertainment, and on-board internet facilities
    fall into the category of infotainment data that encompasses all the traffic related
    to entertainment and driver information systems within the vehicle. Finally, the
    driver assistance cameras assist the drivers while reversing and lane departing
    [39]. The authors conclude their discussion by suggesting the standardization
    of approaches across the industries, allowing manufacturers to focus on new innovations
    based on existing applications. Similarly, Saed et al. [40] address the security
    issues in intra-inter vehicle communication networks. In terms of intra-vehicle
    communication, the authors suggest that data transmission between the vehicle’s
    Electronic Control Units through a Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol should
    be protected. The research was carried out to present some background study into
    the specifics of CAN applications. Some of the key issues such as boot loader,
    privacy, operating system level issues, application specific issues and communication
    related issues with respect to security not only in today’s vehicles but also
    in the future vehicles were focused. Promises of security improvements for future
    vehicles are also suggested such as adopting IPV6 in the vehicle communication
    protocol, behavioral privacy, cross-domain security, use of public key infrastructure,
    resolving privacy concerns with respect to customer information, implementing
    a robust security approach for the vehicle communication and last but not least
    addressing all the newly identified vulnerabilities by constant monitoring and
    tracking [40]. E. Challenges of Existing Communication Technologies and Solutions
    Some of the major standardized technologies that are currently being considered
    for V2X communication are: IEEE802.11p/DSRC and its extension IEEE802.11px, 3rd
    generation partnership project (3GPP)’s Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) Pro
    and millimeter-wave (mmWave) [41], [42]. Further detail about each of these technology
    with respect to its pros and cons is provided below. 1) IEEE802.11p/DSRC and IEEE802.11px
    The IEEE802.11p/DSRC standard incorporates the suite of IEEE802.11s and IEEEP1609.x
    standards (with some modifications), operating in a frequency range of 5.850 GHz
    to 5.925 GHz. Having a decentralized architecture, the Physical (PHY) layer of
    the protocol is based on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), while
    the MAC layer is based on Enhanced Distributed Channel Access protocol having
    Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance and four different access
    categories to the medium that supports different QoS profiles and prioritizes
    data traffic [41], [42]. Due to a direct communication between the source and
    destination endpoints, the protocol can operate without network coverage in a
    fully distributed manner. These endpoints start communication without forming
    a Basic Service Set that allows vehicles to effectively and immediately transmit
    data. The protocol spectrum is divided into seven channels each of 10 MHz bandwidth,
    where the control channel is specifically reserved for broadcasting safety and
    mission critical messages, while the remaining six channels can be used for all
    other applications [42]. Due to the adopted MAC contention based medium access
    strategy, the IEEE802.11p/DSRC throughput and end-to-end delay performance degrades
    quickly as the network load increases. The main reason behind this degradation
    is the lack of coordination between the devices and the use of a “listen before
    talk” mechanism. Based on these assumptions, the protocol may only be suitable
    for transferring low bitrate data streams in vehicular environments. Another drawback
    of IEEE802.11p/DSRC is that its communication range typically extends to several
    100s of meters and that may not be applicable to some V2X applications where a
    reliable transmission beyond this communication range is required [41]. Efficient
    utilization of the allocated spectrum for mission critical applications and safety
    purposes in 5.9 GHz frequency band is another drawback of IEEE802.11p/DSRC. According
    to Mavromatis et al. [42], to overcome the deficiencies of IEEE02.11p/DSRC, an
    enhanced version of the protocol in terms of IEEE802.11px is launched based on
    a Space Time Block Coding mechanism that can increase the performance under noisy
    channel transmissions and can improve the packet delivery rate by 40% as compared
    to IEEE802.11p. Also, the new protocol is expected to provide MIMO antenna capabilities
    with improved OFDM layouts, and very high throughput frame by enhancing the channel
    capacity by a factor of 10 [42]. 2) 3GPP LTE-Advanced Pro The next level of communication
    is to bypass the existing infrastructure and transfer data directly between the
    users. It’s basically the next generation of Device-to-Device (D2D) communication
    where an infrastructure independent communication will be offered with significantly
    lower delay performance. LTE and LTE-A Pro, represents the next generation of
    5G cellular communication standards defined by 3GPP in order to provide high data
    rates, pervasive coverage, enhanced connectivity for end-users regardless of the
    geographical location and environment. Public Land Mobile Network facilitates
    cellular radio coverage to vehicles and vulnerable road users such as pedestrians
    and cyclists based on 3GPP LTE standard also known as Evolved Universal Terrestrial
    Access Network and can exploit the existing infrastructure for V2X communication
    [41], [42]. LTE was originally designed for mobile broadband (MBB) services; hence
    it has many limitations with respect to V2X communication. Some of those limitations
    are listed as follows based on [41]: Latency increases as the number of users
    in a cell increases, and to maintain a latency below 200ms, event-triggered messages
    should be limited from 100 to 150 devices in rural and urban environments respectively.
    A single data packet between two vehicles needs to traverse the entire network
    rather than a direct transfer link between the source and destination. This may
    lead to a higher delay and sometimes a point of failure for the infrastructure.
    LTE will not be an optimal solution for transmitting small chunks of data as it
    was originally designed for broadband services. Transmission of these small packets
    of data may lead to problems such as channel coding, control and channel estimation
    overhead and resource granularity. As LTE is an infrastructure-based approach,
    it may be difficult to satisfy the coverage requirements in tunnels, mountainous
    territories, underground parking and rural areas etc. which are basically the
    most vulnerable places for road-users. To overcome these limitations, the current
    release of LTE-A Pro is designed in such a way that can fulfill almost all the
    requirements for public safety and commercial consumer applications such as higher
    mobility and long-distance coverage, enhanced QoS, and multicast communication.
    Similarly, the downlink and uplink access technologies are based on OFDMA and
    Single Carrier (SC-FDMA) respectively, so frequency-time resource scheduling is
    guaranteed with higher flexibility and efficiency. Even with dynamic propagation
    environments and higher mobility speeds, significant spectral efficiency can be
    obtained based on advanced MIMO capabilities. Also, having multicast/broadcast
    capabilities, LTE-A Pro can fully support vehicular service message broadcasting
    in cross traffic assistance applications. With such mature capabilities, LTE-A
    Pro still has limitations in terms of latency [43], [44]. The maximum achievable
    latency in end-to-end communication can be as high as 80ms, which is not sufficient
    to support tactile-like communication that requires a latency of less than 10ms.
    Similarly, terminals need to re-establish a connection with the base station after
    an idle state costing a latency of almost 110ms for additional link establishment,
    which again promotes severe performance degradation and may not be usable in safety-critical
    applications [45]. 3) Millimeter Wave (mmWave) The next generation of 5G cellular
    systems will have mmWave technology and systems that will be based on this technology
    will play an important role in 5G communication. mmWave operates in the spectrum
    between 30GHz and 300GHz, while the carrier frequencies are spread around 60GHz
    with a channelisation of 2.16GHz. Through beamforming technologies, mmWave will
    achieve high array gains by implementing large antenna arrays that will help the
    system to achieve higher data rates typically up to several gigabits-per-second
    [42], [46]. IEEE802.11ad which is basically a protocol stack for mmWave will ensure
    a data-rate of 7Gbps with an end-to-end latency of less than 10ms. Also, under
    ideal propagation conditions, mmWave systems outperforms IEEE802.11p/DSRC and
    LTE/LTE-A Pro standards in terms of V2X communication [47]. A summary of all these
    features along with some additional capabilities of the above mentioned technologies
    is given in Table 2 based on [42]. TABLE 2 Candidate Technologies for V2X Communication
    SECTION IV. Drones Wireless networks comprising of Drones/UAVs can provide on-the-fly
    communication facilities in a cost-effective way in situations where part of the
    existing terrestrial infrastructure is destroyed and there is a need to provide
    emergency services and avoid any further destruction in the disaster-struck areas
    [48], [49]. In most cases, UAVs are only used for military purposes, but when
    they are equipped with small access points/routers, they can provide a communication
    bridge between ground users and network nodes. Similarly, UAVs can be used in
    package delivery, surveillance operations and IoT applications. Surveillance operations
    usually involve monitoring the areas of interest over a long period of time. Such
    operations may include search and rescue operations, border patrol and traffic
    monitoring, fire monitoring and many more [49], [50]. A. Single UAV Deployment
    Single UAV deployment is a simple scenario where a UAV tries to bridge communication
    between two static nodes on the ground. Kwon and Hailes [51] proposed a greedy
    search algorithm in order to search the area for node discovery and to achieve
    optimum communication between the participating nodes. The optimal position of
    a UAV is identified based on balanced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), throughput,
    and bit error rate. SNR and throughput are used as input variables and based on
    these variables the proportional-integral-derivative controller decides the next
    waypoint of the UAV. The authors concluded that based on SNR and throughput, the
    algorithm can calculate the most advantageous position of the UAV where all the
    participating nodes can be served at the same time. Similarly, several algorithms
    have been developed in order to connect a disjoint group of nodes using a single
    UAV. Heimfarth and de Araujo [52] presented a method for connecting a disjoint
    group of wireless sensor networks with the help of a UAV for the purpose of carrying
    messages. The authors used the UAV as a data mule, where the UAV physically transmits
    the packets to the entire network. Initially the network was partitioned into
    different segments and a cluster head election was done in order to elect a cluster
    head for each group of nodes. The cluster head is the node that is responsible
    for communicating and exchanging data with UAV. The authors proposed a separate
    algorithm for the cluster head election process. Within a segment, geographic
    routing was used to route the packets and was termed as intra-segment message
    relay. For inter-segment message relays where the packets need to be transferred
    from one segment to another, the UAV visits each cluster head for collecting data
    and delivering it to the required destination. The authors performed different
    simulations and concluded that the system is capable of maintaining communication
    between the group of nodes with a low packet rate for a moderate set of traffic.
    Two different cases were considered for simulation purpose having an area of 4
    and 9 km2 respectively. 6 & 9 segments with 60 nodes per segment using a single
    UAV with a speed of 60 km/h having a buffer size of 200-400 packets was considered
    for the same set of simulation. Heimfarth and de Araujo [52] also noticed a bigger
    latency in the case of a huge deployment area. An intelligent hierarchical state
    routing algorithm (IHSR) was proposed in order to reduce the system latency because
    of long propagation delays of UAVs as well as to improve the throughput [53].
    The hierarchical infrastructure of a heterogeneous ad-hoc wireless network with
    UAVs consisted of 2 levels i.e. ground ad-hoc wireless network, and ground embedded
    mobile backbone network. IHSR first divides the entire network into clusters where
    each cluster has its own cluster head and cluster internal nodes (cluster members).
    Logical addresses were introduced in IHSR in order to manage the mobility in a
    better way. For route discovery, link state messages or invitation messages were
    exchanged locally and globally through neighbor cluster heads and UAV broadcasts.
    In respond to an invitation message, each lower level node sends a registration
    message to the cluster head where the cluster head stores it in its INtable. Gu
    et al. [53] verified their algorithm through different simulations and concluded
    that the proposed system improved the throughput for link state routing through
    UAV broadcasts instead of flooding. Moreover, different mobility models for ad-hoc
    network were studied by Camp et al. [54]. The authors categorized the movement
    of mobile nodes in two different models i.e. Entity mobility models, and Group
    mobility models. In entity mobility models, the movement of mobile nodes are independent
    of each other, while in group mobility models, the movement of mobile nodes are
    dependent on each other. B. Multiple UAV Deployment Complex situations occur when
    a single UAV is unable to cover a group of nodes in a specific mission. Multiple
    UAVs are used in such cases in order to cover a set of nodes in a bounded region.
    A cooperative distributed planning algorithm termed as the consensus based bundle
    algorithm (CBBA) was proposed by Ponda et al. [55] in order to ensure network
    connectivity with limited communication facilities for a group of heterogeneous
    agents operating in a dynamic environment. The algorithm improves the entire mission
    performance and also extend the range of a team. CBBA use the free agents as relays
    for maintaining connectivity between the base station and UAVs during the task
    execution. The authors validated the performance of CBBA through simulation results
    as well as field tests and, based on those results they concluded that CBBA is
    well suited for real time applications. Similarly, Palat et al. [56] studied the
    application of distributed MIMO schemes on multiple UAVs as communication relays
    for range and reliability improvement of ground based ad-hoc networks. The authors
    used different simulation parameters to verify the performance of both MIMO and
    orthogonal space-time block codes techniques under ideal and non-ideal conditions.
    In the case of lower carrier frequencies, better performance can be achieved in
    terms of distributed beamforming. Also, in the case of multi-hop relaying based
    on swarm of UAVs, the range and reliability of ad-hoc networks can be improved.
    C. Collision Avoidance in the Case of Multiple UAVs Collision avoidance is another
    important issue that must be addressed in the presence of multiple UAVs. Li et
    al. [57] have evaluated a number of collision avoidance algorithms such as collision
    cone, geometric collision cones, simulated annealing, inverse proportional navigation,
    artificial potential fields, and dynamic sparse A-Star (A*). The authors verified
    the evaluation process by implementing and simulating the aforementioned algorithms
    on a common infrastructure, and also addressed the strength and weaknesses of
    each approach. Collision cone and geometric collision cone algorithms works on
    the concept of relative velocities of all UAVs generating a collision cone. A
    minimum distance between two UAVs was calculated based on the relative velocities
    and concluded that if the relative velocity is greater than a specified degree
    of angle, then the UAVs are moving away and there is no threat of collision. On
    the other hand, if both the UAVs are inside the cone and their relative velocities
    are less than the specified degree of angle, a threat of collision is there. In
    that case, the relative velocities of UAVs need to be changed in order to rectify
    the possible collision. Moreover, if both the velocities are same, then there
    is a need to deviate the UAV from their original path, because they are approaching
    towards each other and there is a possibility of entering into the threat zone.
    In simulated annealing, there are three main steps i.e. clustering the UAVs, establishing
    a cost function, and minimizing the cost function. In step one, the UAVs are clustered
    into groups based on their threats. Also, a minimum distance between two UAVs
    where the UAVs can still avoid the collision is calculated and this particular
    area is termed as danger zone. If there is no threat in the danger zone, the UAV
    can safely continue towards its goal. A cost function is then established where
    the UAVs will be instructed regarding how much they will turn in order to change
    the velocity and to avoid collision. This cost function is then minimized based
    on certain parameters such as energy level of the current state, and random neighboring
    state for new solution. Li et al. [57] concluded that the neighbor can become
    a new solution only if the energy level is less than the current solution, or
    if the probability function designates it as the new solution. D. Drone Applications
    Using 5G Lin et al. [58] performed field measurements for data collection during
    drone flights connected to the commercial LTE network. They also performed some
    simulations in order to study the performance of network in terms of serving many
    drones simultaneously over a wide area. The main purpose of this study was to
    analyze the applicability and performance of mobile network connectivity to low
    altitude drones. Lin et al. [58] conclude that the current mobile LTE network
    can support the initial deployment of low altitude drones, but they are still
    facing some issues with respect to interference and mobility that can be addressed
    by the next generation of 5G networks by providing more efficient connectivity
    for wide-scale drone deployment. Similarly, Luo et al. [59] highlight the communication
    and network technologies that can contribute to UAV disaster management systems
    in situations including early warning system, search and rescue, data gathering,
    provision of network coverage in emergency communication and logistic delivery.
    The authors also address the networking technologies that are essential for UAV
    deployment in practical environments in the context of disaster management and
    response. A universal network architecture based on 802.11 Wi-Fi network, 2G/3G/4G
    cellular network, UAV ad-hoc network and satellite network was proposed as shown
    in Figure 4. FIGURE 4. UAV-based disaster management. Show All Design considerations
    and challenges such as bandwidth consumption, transmission latency and disruption
    of UAV-based wireless network for disaster management were also studied. In terms
    of bandwidth consumption, strict bandwidth requirements must be fulfilled especially
    for online applications such as real-time monitoring. In addition to real-time
    monitoring, 4K or even 8K videos captured during aerial monitoring applications
    require a much higher bandwidth. Such a higher bandwidth can be ensured by the
    next generation of 5G communication. Latency is another important aspect in the
    design of system components and network protocols. For real-time visual and audio
    data transfer in the context of aerial communication, latency should not be more
    than 50-100ms. Similarly, for surveillance, such as border or highway patrolling,
    the latency should not be more than 3ms. Luo et al. [59] also address the design
    considerations and challenges such as channel modeling, antenna structure design,
    UAV cooperation, advanced data analytics, path planning, and energy efficiency
    etc. of a UAV-based ad-hoc network for disaster management. Moreover, Huo et al.
    [60] present a comprehensive review of the current developments made in three
    categories of UAV-enabled next generation wireless communications. In the first
    phase, a multi-layer distributed UAV-enabled 5G network is proposed, where the
    architecture is more flexible, hierarchical and supports scenario driven reconfigurations.
    In the second phase, several performance enhancement enablers are identified and
    evaluated for UAV-enabled 5G wireless communications. Furthermore, Naqvi et al.
    [48] focus on different UAV-enabled 5G communication paradigms such as deployment
    issues related to energy efficiency etc. In this regard, the work investigates
    the compatibility of UAVs with traditional wireless networks to achieve energy
    efficient high data rates for 5G communications. Moreover, the article proposes
    a UAV-based routing protocol for disaster-resilient infrastructure. A case study
    is presented based on a UAV that is incorporated in a wireless network in both
    low and high-power base stations operating at different frequencies. The study
    concludes that the incorporation of UAVs will increase the performance of the
    heterogeneous network in terms of network coverage and data rate. Similarly, He
    et al. [61] discussed the security aspects of UAV-enabled 5G communication for
    public safety networks. Using UAVs in such a critical network infrastructure may
    pose cybersecurity threats to the personal information of the individuals involved.
    If UAV-enabled communication is not made secure, this will reduce the applicability
    and usability of such networks. The authors claim that UAV-enabled communication
    networks suffer from issues like unauthorized access, malicious control, or other
    cybersecurity attacks. He et al. [61] emphasize the need for communication security
    schemes to be incorporated in such critical networks to secure personal information.
    Shakhatreh et al. [8] performed a comprehensive survey on UAV civil applications
    with their key challenges. The main purpose of the study was to present the worldwide
    UAV payload market value and to provide a classification of UAVs based on certain
    factors such as endurance, weight, coverage range, maximum altitude, and its applications.
    The authors also discussed the civil applications of UAVs in a number of key areas
    including real-time monitoring of road traffic, security and surveillance, precision
    agriculture, provision of civil infrastructure, search and rescue operations,
    and delivery of goods along with their key challenges. Additionally, Fotouhi et
    al. [62] proposed a novel Drone-Cells scenario where the drones within a cell
    persistently move in order to serve the users from a closer distance for the sake
    of improving the spectral efficiency of the network along with the quality of
    service of the cell-edge users. Three different mobility control algorithms with
    erratic complexity and performance were used to check the efficiency of DroneCells
    scenario. Based on the simulation results, the authors claimed 34% improvement
    in terms of spectral efficiency and a 50% increase in the 5th-percentile packet
    throughput as compared to drone hover over some fixed locations. Fotouhi et al.
    [62] also assured that such kind of results can be obtained with minimal drone
    speeds in order to avoid any negative effect on drone battery lifetime. Likewise,
    Zeng et al. [63] provide an overview of the emerging technologies with their potential
    benefits, communication and spectrum requirements, along with proposing some new
    design considerations with respect to the next generation of three-dimensional
    heterogeneous wireless networks. Based on the proposed cellular-connected UAV
    technology as shown in Figure 5, new wireless technologies can be developed that
    will enable significantly enhanced UAV-ground communications. Several appealing
    advantages of cellular-connected UAVs such as ubiquitous accessibility, enhanced
    performance, ease of monitoring and management, robust navigation, and cost effectiveness
    were also highlighted. In terms of new design considerations, the authors explored
    3D coverage, unique channel characteristics, severe aerial-ground interference,
    and asymmetric uplink/downlink traffic requirements. Similarly, in terms of promising
    technologies that can effectively enable future wireless systems, the authors
    investigated 3D beamforming, multi-cell cooperation, and ground-aerial non-orthogonal
    multiple access. Finally, Zeng et al. [63] outlined some future directions such
    as quality of service aware trajectory design, millimeter wave cellular-connected
    UAV, and cellular-connected UAV swarm. FIGURE 5. An overview of cellular-connected
    UAVs representing different use-cases. Show All In similar manner, Zhang et al.
    [64] studied the PHY layer security in UAV communication to address the two critical
    issues i.e. the achievable secrecy rate between the legitimate transmitter and
    intended receiver will be limited as compare to the rate between the legitimate
    transmitter and eavesdropper, even in the presence of power control, artificial
    noise, cooperative jamming, and multi-antenna beamforming techniques. Secondly,
    since the eavesdropper is a passive device, it is quite difficult to estimate
    the channel state information of the eavesdropper that is usually required to
    a legitimate transmitter. For simplicity, the authors considered a single UAV
    that is deployed to send the confidential information to a fixed position-based
    legitimate receiver in the presence of a fixed position-based eavesdropper. The
    main purpose of the study was to maximize the average secrecy rate of the UAV
    by jointly designing the UAV trajectory and transmit power control subject to
    different constraints such as average and peak transmit power, UAV mobility with
    its maximum speed, and initial and final UAV locations. Based on the proposed
    efficient iterative algorithm, the authors concluded that the algorithm can expressively
    improve the physical layer security performance of the UAV communication system.
    E. Comparative Analysis of Control Latency in Terms of 4G and 5G In this section
    we elaborate on the control latency that is currently offered by different cellular
    technologies for mission critical infrastructures using drones and how 5G will
    help to reduce that latency. Also, we discuss some of the capabilities that 5G
    is offering for drones. Yang et al. [65] performed some field experiments in order
    to gain insights into the capabilities of 4G networks for connected drones. The
    results were collected at 2.6GHz carrier frequency with 20MHz carrier bandwidth
    using LTE-Advance network. Latency performance of the proposed network was calculated
    at three different heights i.e. 50m, 100m, and 300m. The results illustrate that
    most of the latency data samples are concentrated between 200ms and 300ms at a
    height of 50 and 100m respectively, while at 300m height, the latency data samples
    are more inclined towards 400 to 500ms. Based on the latency samples, it can be
    suggested that without further enhancements the current LTE-A network might have
    difficulties in serving drone applications with rigorous latency requirements.
    Yang et al. [65] conclude that the more powerful capabilities of the next generation
    of 5G networks can address the coverage, data rate, and latency issues of the
    existing technologies and can fulfill the objectives of the connected drones in
    mission critical infrastructures. The improved capabilities of 5G networks may
    include coverage enhancements and high data rates, service differentiation and
    QoS enhancements, and detection and resource management. Some of the key characteristics
    of cellular communication technologies with respect to disaster management are
    summarized in Table 3 [59]. TABLE 3 Characteristics of Cellular Technologies in
    Disaster Management Using Drones SECTION V. Healthcare With the increase in the
    world’s adult population [66], there is an increasing requirement for treatment
    and assistance in emergency healthcare situations. This has emphasized the need
    for technological advancements in healthcare to provide efficient and affordable
    solutions to an increasing number of patients. Kumar et al. [67] identified the
    important features that a mobile healthcare system should possess. Such a system
    should be able to (i) handle emergency cases using tele-medicine facilities, (ii)
    provide tele-medicine unit to a doctor in order to enhance intensive healthcare
    provision and (iii) allow the installation of a tele-monitoring system at patient’s
    home while the monitoring station is based in the doctor’s office. Alemdar and
    Ersoy [68] provide a survey of healthcare applications that deploy wireless sensor
    networks such as movement tracking, medication intake tracking and daily activity
    monitoring. The authors emphasize that there are several limitations that currently
    exist in current technologies that can be overcome by adopting 5G networks to
    make healthcare remotely accessible. Soldani et al. [69] propose a framework that
    can be deployed on mobile devices, offering functionality for collecting, processing
    and storing information to support identification of abnormal events. The development
    of 4G technologies enabled the advent of a range of tele-medicine applications
    such as remote consultation, remote surgery and patient monitoring. Kumar et al.
    [67] also discuss limitations of existing technologies (i.e. lack of flexible
    and compatible tele-medical links due to high hardware and operational costs,
    data transfer rates and latency) that will need to be addressed in future technologies
    such as 5G. When deploying the next generation of networks, the main factors that
    should be addressed are security, seamless integration, QoS and streaming and
    compression issues. It is expected that the advent of 5G technologies will play
    an active part in providing patient-oriented healthcare applications which can
    be easily managed by the patient or the carer. It is expected that 5G networks
    would carry a significantly higher volume of data while maintaining reliability
    [70], [71]. The critical requirement for 5G networks is ultra-low latency which
    will allow the deployment of mission critical applications such as tele-consulting,
    tele-surgery etc. Kim et al. [72] highlight that in order to achieve interdisciplinary
    collaboration between medical services and technology, there are a few requirements
    to be met. These include (i) sensors that are ultra sensitive and small enough
    to be embedded into the patient’s body, (ii) ultra reliable low latency communications
    infrastructure which can transmit large amounts of audio, video and haptic feedback
    data with very little delay; and (iii) standardized haptic interfaces such as
    surgical robots etc. that will possibly increase the type of applications where
    such technologies can be deployed. Figure 6 represents an infrastructure model
    for a tele-medicine system which consists of an operator with an interface at
    the controller end connected to a remotely controlled domain via a 5G cellular
    network. FIGURE 6. A representation of a tele-medicine infrastructure using 5G
    network. Show All De Mattos and Gondim [73] discuss the requirements for implementing
    mobile health applications (m-health) using 5G networks and the capabilities of
    5G communication that are important for m-health applications. The authors identified
    some of the significant features such as very low latency, bandwidth, scalability,
    high network capacity, large number of sensory devices, long battery lifetime,
    reliability, resilience and security that 5G networks require for m-health applications.
    Chen et al. [70] and Thuemmler et al. [74] discuss the various technical specifications
    relevant to healthcare such as network design approaches and paradigms. The various
    aspects discussed range from the types of data sources available from the healthcare
    domain, to the techniques required to perform the necessary data processing and
    network resource management techniques. Thuemmler et al. [74] discuss the network
    spectrum required for tele-medicine applications and the interoperability requirements
    when setting up a tele-medicine infrastructure. References [10] and [75]–[77]
    refer to IoT devices used for healthcare applications as Internet of Medical Things
    (IoMT) which requires high data and speed capacity and a long operation time over
    a reliable network with very low transmission delay. Brito [78] provides a survey
    of the various technological trends in the realm of 5G networks and various IoMT
    applications and the requirements of 5G networks for the deployment of these systems.
    West [10] discusses the capabilities of 5G as compared to existing networks to
    deploy cyber-physical healthcare systems and could allow for implementation of
    healthcare applications such as online consultation, diagnosis and remote surgery
    applications. The following sub-sections go into further details of the popular
    healthcare applications available which could benefit from incorporating 5G networks
    for communication [76], [79]. A. Online Consultation 5G technology with IoMT,
    big data analysis and ML techniques will allow for enhancements in healthcare
    applications [11]. The incorportaion of sensors as part of IoMT and 5G network
    to monitor vitals and other health related data will allow patients (at home)
    to monitor themselves and transmit the data to the health expert at a remote location
    (i.e. hospital) for a real-time online consultation. Caric et al. [80] identify
    the advantages of using online consultation and also propose a platform for online
    consultations. They emphasize that the online consultation can provide better
    regulatory governance which would ensure transparency in the regulatory environment.
    They highlight the drawbacks of current online consultation systems which lack
    coordinated information exchange. They do emphasize that the existing global communication
    network provides an opportunity to construct a communication platform for online
    consultations where ordinary citizens, experts, different civic and business associations
    and executive bodies could contribute and exchange information using mainly standard
    internet connectivity [80]. Segura-Sampedro et al. [81] conducted a study on post-operative
    wound observation via remote access. The findings suggested that the patients
    were satisfied with this method of consultation and considered it to be feasible
    and safe for postoperative applications. B. Online Health Monitoring With the
    advent of 5G technologies, it is possible to realize the concept of virtual hospitals
    which provide a variety of services over a communication channel. Oleshchuk and
    Fensli [82] addressed security and privacy issues that need to be considered when
    implementing a health monitoring application in the 5G communication context.
    Limitations of the existing cellular technologies with respect to body area network
    were highlighted and possible solutions based on some new approaches in terms
    of 5G were also proposed. Biswas and Misra [83] discuss low cost, reliable e-Health
    monitoring device using an IoT-based platform architecture that can measure the
    vital signs of an individual, securely store the data on a server and analyze
    the data to generate specific proactive alerts when necessary. The platform connects
    the patient to the registered doctors who will have access to the patient’s health
    data which are monitored using medical sensors. Hence, the platform can be used
    to provide clinical healthcare at a distance, thus enabling the monitoring of
    elderly or home bound patients and those who are located in remote areas. Jusak
    et al. [77] propose an IoMT system for monitoring cardiac signals using an agent
    and manager model. The agent collects the signals in the form of a phonocardiograph
    signal which is then sent to the manager which gathers the health data and presents
    it to the healthcare providers via a web interface. This model can be extended
    to other types of monitoring application where the patient data can be accessed
    securely from any location in the world by a doctor or healthcare provider. C.
    Remote Diagnosis West [10] discusses the potential of using 5G networks to deploy
    remote healthcare systems that would allow for real-time monitoring and management
    of several sources of health data and efficiently diagnose an ailment event before
    it manifests. Brito [78] summarizes IoT and related e-health applications which
    include medical expertise using advanced tele-diagnostic tools, enabling remote
    physical examination (even by touch) through a robot that is remotely controlled,
    which can offer audio-visual and haptic feedback. The authors identify the requirements
    that enable such applications to be implemented, including enhanced mobile broadband,
    milli-meter wave communication and low latency high reliable communications. Chen
    et al. [84] propose a 5G-Smart Diabetes system, which combines state-of-the-art
    technologies such as wearable 2.0, ML and big data to generate comprehensive sensing
    and analysis for patients suffering from diabetes. They also present the data
    sharing mechanism and personalized data analysis model for 5G-Smart Diabetes.
    Bagula et al. [85] detail a cyber-physical healthcare system which allows for
    recognition of a patient’s condition that is considered at the first step in a
    fully digitized remote healthcare system. ML is used in the multi-layer framework
    that consists of numerous low cost lightweight devices. D. Mobile Robotic Surgery
    With the advancement of 5G technologies, the popularity of mobile robotic surgery
    is set to grow substantially [86]. Haptic sensing is an essential requirement
    for an efficient remote surgical procedure to be conducted. Lema et al. [87] tested
    a tele surgery system which implements a tactile glove to provide haptic feedback
    and observed how it could improve the performance of remote surgery applications.
    The performance of robotic tele-surgery depends on various properties of the communication
    network such as latency, jitter and packet loss; which is considered significant
    when the remote surgery system is implemented with haptic feedback. This highlights
    the significant challenges that need to be addressed in order to use a reliable
    and secure but cost-effective communication setup for remote/robotic surgery applications
    [88]. Surgical robots will provide an alternative to maintain the high quality
    of personal and medical care in Europe, where remotely operated devices would
    allow the healthcare system to operate at a much higher performance and cost-effectiveness.
    To reduce the performance degradation resulting from large latencies, the operator
    needs to be within the proximity of the remote site. Implementing 5G technologies
    would reduce the latency issues which would improve the access to mobile robotic
    surgery. SECTION VI. Open Research Challenges and Future Directions In this section,
    we shed light on some of the open research challenges in terms of V2X, drones
    and healthcare and highlight interesting research topics for future directions.
    A list of potential research challenges along with their future directions is
    listed below. Path loss and channel model of higher carrier frequencies is a challenging
    issue specially in areas surrounded by skyscraper buildings and having a denser
    base-station deployment. Latency of less than 1 millisecond in emergency situations
    for autonomous cars and automatic pilot is an important issue that needs to be
    ensured in the future cellular technologies. Ultra-reliable communication is another
    open issue that needs to be addressed in the future for both vehicle and public
    safety. A lot of work has already been done in this area, but still with the introduction
    of IoT and massive number of connected devices will make it a challenging issue
    again. Another important issue that needs to be researched is the identification
    of vulnerabilities and security loopholes in the new communication system. A tremendous
    amount of work is required at physical layer to identify the suitable techniques
    to cope with the compromised user equipment and data. Effective use of ML techniques
    to analyze and differentiate between normal and attacker behaviors is also a research
    challenge. Similarly, in terms of V2P, the response time and detection of vulnerable
    road users by a self-driving car is a challenging issue that needs to be explored.
    In terms of drones, The main problem with UAV/drone communication is the energy
    limitation. It becomes more critical in situations like disaster management and
    mission critical infrastructures. A lot of work has been done in battery technologies
    but still there are gaps that needs to be addressed in the future by using beamforming
    techniques. Latency and reliability are the two main factors that needs to be
    ensured in UAV operations such as search and rescue, fire monitoring etc. in order
    to help the rescue teams and safeguard the survivors. Continuous video streaming
    in disaster situation needs a reliable connection between UAV and ground stations.
    Assurance of a reliable link will require ultra-low latency and ultra-high reliability
    that can be addressed in the next generation of cellular communication. Security
    and privacy problems such as eavesdropping, jamming and spoofing in aerial networks
    is another challenge in UAV communication. Lightweight techniques and AI solutions
    can be used to address these issues. Mobility support and collision avoidance
    in terms of Internet of UAVs are some of the other challenges that need to be
    researched in the future. Finally, in terms of healthcare, online consultation,
    robotic surgery and telemedicine requires a network that can support high-definition
    video streaming. In such cases ultra-low latency of less than 10ms and ultra-high
    reliable connection are required. Latency of less than 10ms is a critical challenge
    and an open research problem in future cellular communication. Reliable and real-time
    remote monitoring requires a high speed network and a reliable connection, otherwise
    practitioners will be unable to get the real-time data that can be used for quick
    and on-time healthcare decisions. Providing higher bandwidth and reliable connections
    are still an open problem that need to be addressed in future cellular networks.
    Integration of AI techniques for potential diagnosis (in the healthcare sector)
    that can lead to the best treatment plan is also a research area that needs to
    be explored. SECTION VII. Conclusions In this paper, we have explored 5G use-cases
    emphasizing on three main case studies: V2X communication, Drones, and Healthcare
    in order to identify the most challenging use-case for our future work. Starting
    with V2X communication, we explored V2V, V2P, V2I, and IV Communication along
    with their application areas. We also addressed the limitations and challenges
    of the existing communication technologies and proposed solutions based on 5G
    technologies. We further studied drone communication for mission critical infrastructures
    and provide a comparative analysis of 4G (LTE/LTE-A) and 5G with respect to control
    latency. Moreover, we examined healthcare with respect to 4G and 5G technologies
    and provide an overview of online consultation, online health monitoring, remote
    diagnosis, and mobile robotic surgery. Based on the literature review and critical
    analysis, we have concluded that drone communication for the provision and maintenance
    of critical infrastructures is the most challenging scenario that can be carried
    to the next phase of our work. In the future, we are planning to extend this work
    and propose to identify tools in which we can simulate our initial models in order
    to validate them and check their applicability for real-time applications. We
    also look forward to implementing the model in a real-time testbed. The potential
    impact on standard bodies along with community benefits is also part of our future
    plans. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like This Vehicle

    is considered one of the most important sectors that play a strategic role in
    ensuring food security. However, with the increasing world''s population, agri-food
    demands are growing — posing the need to switch from traditional agricultural
    methods to smart agriculture practices, also known as agriculture 4.0. To fully
    benefit from the potential of agriculture 4.0, it is significant to understand
    and address the problems and challenges associated with it. This study, therefore,
    aims to contribute to the development of agriculture 4.0 by investigating the
    emerging trends of digital technologies in the agricultural industry. For this
    purpose, a systematic literature review based on Protocol of Preferred Reporting
    Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses is conducted to analyse the scientific
    literature related to crop farming published in the last decade. After applying
    the protocol, 148 papers were selected and the extent of digital technologies
    adoption in agriculture was examined in the context of service type, technology
    readiness level, and farm type. The results have shown that digital technologies
    such as autonomous robotic systems, internet of things, and machine learning are
    significantly explored and open-air farms are frequently considered in research
    studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). Moreover, it is observed that most
    use cases are still in the prototypical phase. Finally, potential roadblocks to
    the digitization of the agriculture sector were identified and classified at technical
    and socio-economic levels. This comprehensive review results in providing useful
    information on the current status of digital technologies in agriculture along
    with prospective future opportunities. Previous article in issue Next article

    problem Food security is a multidimensional concept that alleviates hunger by
    ensuring a sustainable, nutritious food supply. It is characterized by a four-pillar
    model shown in Fig. 1, with each pillar intrinsic to ensure food security [1].

    full-size image Fig. 2. Agriculture value chain: stages and main functions. Due
    to several anthropogenic factors, such as rapid population growth, urbanization,
    industrialization, farmland loss, freshwater scarcity, and environmental degradation,
    food security is becoming a serious global issue. This is because these factors
    are also directly impacting agricultural industry which is a primary source of
    agri-food production around the world. It is anticipated that by 2050 global population
    will be increased from the current 7.7 billion to 9.2 billion, urban population
    will be rise by 66%, arable land will be declined by approximately 50 million
    hectares, global GHG emissions (source of CO2 – promote crop disease and pest
    growth) will be increased by 50%, agri-food production will be declined by 20%,
    and eventually, food demand will be increased by 59 to 98% – posing an imminent
    threat to food security and adequate food availability [2], [3], [4]. To satisfy
    the increasing food demands, agricultural practitioners worldwide will need to
    maximise the agricultural productivity involving crop and livestock farming. In
    this review paper, the focus is on crop farming that involves cultivation of both
    food and cash crops. A typical agri-food value chain depicting three primary stages,
    namely pre-field (pre-plantation stage), in-field (plantation and harvesting stage),
    and post-field (post-harvesting stage) involved in the production of agricultural
    products is shown in Fig. 2. All the stages play a vital role in the value chain
    but, in this review, the second stage ˝in-field˝ will be considered that involves
    several crop growing processes such as plowing, sowing, spraying, and harvesting,
    etc. These processes currently employ traditional agricultural practices that
    are labor-intensive, require arable land, time, and a substantial amount of water
    (for irrigation) – making it a challenge to produce enough agri-food [5]. A part
    of problem is also related to irregular use of pesticides and herbicides and misuse
    of available technology which cause harm to crop and eventually resulting in agricultural
    wastes [6]. These issues can be addressed by integrating sophisticated technologies
    and computer-based applications that ensure high crop yield, less water consumption,
    optimised pesticide/herbicide utilization, and enhanced crop quality. This is
    where the smart agriculture concept comes in. 1.2. Smart agriculture Industry
    4.0, also known as the fourth industrial revolution, is revolutionizing, and reshaping
    every industry. It is a strategic initiative characterized by a fusion of emerging
    disruptive digital technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), big data and
    analytics (BDA), system integration (SI), cloud computing (CC), simulation, autonomous
    robotic systems (ARS), augmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), wireless
    sensor networks (WSN), cyber-physical system (CPS), digital twin (DT), and additive
    manufacturing (AM) to enable the digitization of the industry [7]. The integration
    of these technologies in agriculture is sparking the next generation industrial
    agriculture, namely, agriculture 4.0 – also termed smart agriculture, smart farming,
    or digital farming [7]. Smart agriculture provides farmers with a diverse set
    of tools (shown in Fig. 3) to address several agricultural food production challenges
    associated with farm productivity, environmental impact, food security, crop losses,
    and sustainability. For instance, with IoT-enabled systems consisting of WSNs,
    farmers can connect to farms remotely irrespective of place and time to monitor
    and control farm operations. Drones equipped with hyperspectral cameras can be
    used to collect data from heterogeneous sources on farmlands and autonomous robots
    can be used to support or accomplish repetitive tasks at farms. Data analytics
    techniques can be employed to analyze the gathered data with computer applications
    can be used to assist farmers in decision-making process. Likewise, a wide variety
    of parameters related to environmental factors, weed control, crop production
    status, water management, soil conditions, irrigation scheduling, herbicides,
    and pesticides, and controlled environment agriculture can be monitored and analyzed
    in smart agriculture to increase crop yields, minimize costs, enhance product
    quality, and maintain process inputs through the use of modern systems [8]. Download

    The concept of “Smart Agriculture”. 1.3. Research motivation and contribution
    The motivation for preparing this review stems from the fact that digital technologies
    in agricultural systems offer new strategic solutions for enhancing the efficiency
    and effectiveness of farms’ production. Moreover, digital transformation provides
    a way forward to implement modern farming practices such as vertical farming (hydroponics,
    aquaponics and aeroponics), which has the potential to overcome food security
    problems. But there is a set of problems and limitations associated with this
    transformation from the technical, socio-economic, and management standpoint that
    must be death to fully exploit the potential of agriculture 4.0 [9]. There are
    number of studies that have discussed emerging trends in the development of agriculture
    4.0 by providing succinct information on key applications, advantages, and corresponding
    research challenges of smart farming [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15],
    [16], [17], [18]. The research focus of these studies is limited to either explaining
    more generic technical aspects while paying attention to only one or few digital
    technologies, and/or enhancing agricultural supply chain performance, and/or developing
    agriculture 4.0 definition, and/or achieving sustainable agronomy through precision
    agriculture, and/or proposing a smart farming framework. Nevertheless, these studies
    do not involve explicit discussion on the tools and techniques used to develop
    different systems and maturity level of these systems. There is also a lack of
    studies considering modern soilless farms such as hydroponics, aquaponics and
    aeroponics (indoor/outdoor) and implications of digital technologies in these
    farms. Hence, it is necessary to analyse the evolution of agriculture 4.0 from
    different perspectives to stimulate the discussion in the area. This study aims
    to present a holistic overview of digital technologies implemented in second stage
    of agricultural production value chain (in-field) for different types of farms
    as mentioned in section 1.1. The main theoretical contribution of the study involves
    analysis and dissemination of the tools and techniques employed, the farm type,
    the maturity level of the developed systems, along with potential roadblocks or
    inhibiting factors in development of agriculture 4.0. The reflections presented
    in the review will support researchers and agricultural practitioner in future
    research on agriculture 4.0. 1.4. Paper organization Following the introduction,
    the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the approach used to gather
    the relevant literature; then, Section 3 presents the statistical results obtained
    after a general analysis of the selected research studies; next, Section 4 provides
    a detailed overview of the core technologies used in the digitization of agriculture;
    after, Section 5 highlights the technical and socio-economic roadblocks to digital
    integration in agriculture; next, Section 6 outlines a discussion about the research
    questions followed by added value, considerations and future prospects related
    to agricultural digitization, and transition to agriculture 5.0; and lastly, Section
    8 concludes the review. 2. Research methodology A systematic literature review
    (SLR) is a tool used to manage the diverse knowledge and identify research related
    to a predetermined topic [19]. In this study, SLR is conducted to investigate
    the status of Industry 4.0 technologies in agricultural industry. Particularly,
    cases are searched where the term ‘agriculture’ appeared concurrently in the title,
    abstract, or keywords of an article with any of the ‘Industry 4.0 technologies”
    mentioned in section 1.2. Before conducting the SLR, a review protocol is defined
    to ensure a transparent and high-quality research process, which are the characteristics
    that make a literature review systematic [20]. The review protocol also helps
    to minimize bias by conducting exhaustive literature searches. This includes three
    steps: the formulation of the research questions, the definition of the search
    strategy, and the specification of inclusion and exclusion criteria. This paper
    uses a preferred reporting item for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA)
    approach to conduct SLR. PRISMA is an evidence-based minimum set of items that
    are used to guide the development process of systematic literature reviews and
    other meta-analyses [19]. 2.1. Review protocol A review protocol (in Table 1)
    is defined before conducting the bibliographic analysis to identify, evaluate,
    and interpret results relevant to the research scope. First, research questions
    are formulated to provide insight into the analysis of published studies in the
    research area of interest from different dimensions. These questions need to be
    answered in the study. Next, the search strategy is defined, which helps identify
    appropriate keywords later in the search equation to identify the relevant information
    sources, such as academic databases and search engines that provide access to
    a massive amount of digital documentation. Three online research repositories
    are used to retrieve relevant studies: ScienceDirect1, Scopus2, and IEEE Xplore3.
    Finally, to refine the search results of each database, boundaries are set by
    predefining inclusion and exclusion criteria for further investigation and content
    assessments of selected publications. It involves, for instance, defining the
    time interval for the research process from 2011 to 2021 to limit the studies
    to those published in English, disregarding chapters of books and grey literature,
    such as reports and summaries of events and seminars. These last two steps of
    the review protocol allow the preliminary filtering of metadata sources and narrow
    down the scope of research. Table 1. Review protocol for systematic literature

    the literature for digitization of agriculture? RQ2: How and to what extent have
    these technologies been applied in the context of service type, tools and techniques

    search process is done in four stages: identification, screening, eligibility,
    and inclusion, as detailed by the PRISMA flow diagram shown in Fig. 4. After initial
    metadata filtering through the application of search expression, a total of 3165
    records are found (1690 from Scopus, 926 from ScienceDirect, and 549 from IEEE
    Xplore), which are then consolidated for the removal of duplicate items in the
    identification stage. The number of publications after this step is reduced to
    2876. In the screening stage, the titles and abstracts of the papers are analyzed,
    and only 498 papers are selected for integral reading. In the third stage, full-text
    screening of these articles is performed to verify their eligibility in relation
    to the objective of this paper, which is to answer the research questions mentioned
    in Table 1. Of the 498 papers, 137 are found to be relevant for this review. Another
    11 are added through a cross-referencing approach, adding up to 148 papers selected
    in the final stage for further analysis. Download : Download high-res image (624KB)

    search process (PRISMA). 2.3. Threats to validity i SLR replication: The presented
    SLR is susceptible to threats to validity because the current search is limited
    to only three online repositories. More publications could potentially be found
    if additional sources were explored. The process of SLR is described clearly in
    sub-sections 2.1 and 2.2, and hence, validity can be considered well addressed.
    However, in the case of replication of this SLR, it is possible that one can find
    slightly different publications. This difference would result from different personal
    choices during the screening and eligibility steps of PRISMA, but it is highly
    unlikely that the overall findings would change. ii Search string: the search
    string used to find the relevant studies cover the whole scope of SLR, but there
    is a possibility that valuable studies might have been missed. Additional keywords
    and synonyms with a broader search might return more studies. 3. Digitization
    trends in agriculture The year-wise distribution of the 148 articles from 2011
    to 2021 is represented in Fig. 5. Around 22% of the scientific publications in
    the last ten years were published in 2018. This reflects that the agricultural
    industry is making considerable progress in the context of the implementation
    of digital technologies, but the pace is still slow as compared to other domains
    such as healthcare, manufacturing, mining, automotive, energy, etc.,[15]. Download

    of the 148 selected research studies. The farm type refers to the crop farming
    method considered while developing an application or framework. For instance,
    the farming method can be soil-based or soilless. The soil-based farming category
    involves open-air fields (traditional outdoor agricultural farms) and greenhouse
    farms (indoor). On the other hand, the soilless farming category involves modern
    farming practices such as aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics (mostly indoor).
    The numbers at the top of the stacked column in Fig. 6 indicate the total number
    of studies that have used the particular technology to develop a smart agriculture
    system, whereas different colors of columns indicate the respective farm types.
    Use cases are from these publications are analysed, and conclusions are drawn.
    For instance, it is found that autonomous robotics systems (including unmanned
    guided vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles (drones)), internet of things, and
    machine learning appear to be the widely applied technologies in the agricultural
    domain in the last decade. The same illustration suggests that big data, wireless
    sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and digital twins are the emerging areas
    in agriculture. Moreover, open-air farms are the most frequently considered in
    research studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). For soilless farming systems
    (aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics), only 22 publications are found, which
    insinuates that these modern farming practices are still in their infancy. Likewise,
    services of each use case are identified and are classified under nine different
    service categories, namely: i) crop management, CM (Estimation/ prediction of
    crop yield/ growth rate/ harvesting period and seed plantation/ harvesting/ pollination/
    spraying (fertilizer/ pesticide)); ii) crop quality management, CQM (fresh weight,
    green biomass, height, length, width, leaf density, piment content (chlorophyll)
    and phytochemical composition); iii) water and environment management, WEM (monitoring
    and control of flow rate, water level, water quality (nutrients), temperature,
    humidity, CO2, and weather forecast etc.); iv) irrigation management, IM (water
    stress detection and scheduling); v) farm management, FM (monitoring of farm operations,
    tracking and counting products, determining production efficiency, financial analysis,
    energy consumption analysis, technology integration and decisions implementation);
    vi) pest and disease management, PDM (pest identification and disease detection);
    vii) soil management, SM (moisture content, soil nutrients, fertilizer needs and
    application); viii) weed and unwanted vegetation management, WUVM (weed/unknown
    vegetation mapping, classification, and herbicides application); and ix) fruit
    detection and counting, FDC — as shown in Fig. 7. These categories illustrate
    the role of different digital technologies in smart farming. Upon analysis, it
    is found that crop management parameters, such as crop yield prediction, growth
    rate estimation, or evaluation of harvesting period are the most frequently researched
    areas for agriculture 4.0 in the last decade (29%), whereas very little heed is
    paid towards soil management (2%), fruit detection and counting (2%), and crop
    quality management (3%). Download : Download high-res image (561KB) Download :

    studies: The technology readiness level (TRL) of all the use cases is examined
    using European Union''s TRL scale that partitions system''s maturity level into
    three generic levels [21]. The first level is conceptual, that represents European
    TRL 1–2 (use case is in conceptual phase), the second level is the prototype,
    which means European TRL 3–6 (use case is working even without the complete planned
    functionality), and the third level is deployed, that includes European TRL 7–9
    (use case is mature with all the possible functions). Fig. 8 depicts the TRL of
    each use case developed in selected studies. It is observed that little progress
    has been made in advancing smart agricultural systems beyond the concept and prototype
    levels to the commercial level. For instance, most use cases (129) are at the
    prototype level. Download : Download high-res image (269KB) Download : Download

    provides critical insights towards answering RQ1 and RQ2 from Table 1. 4.1. Internet
    of Things driven agricultural systems Internet of things (IoT) refers to a cosmos
    of interrelated computing devices, sensors, appliances, and machines connected
    with the internet, each having unique identities and capabilities for performing
    remote sensing and monitoring [21]. The reference architecture of IoT with six
    layers, namely perception layer (hardware devices), network layer (communication),
    middleware layer (device management and interoperability), service layer (cloud
    computing), application layer (data integration and analytics), and end-user layer
    (user-interface), is shown in Fig.9. In the agricultural domain, IoT devices in
    the physical layer gather data related to environmental and crop parameters such
    as temperature, humidity, pH value, water level, leaf color, fresh leaf weight,
    etc. The transmission of this data takes place in the network layer, the design
    of which depends on the selection of suitable communication technologies relevant
    to the field size, farm location, and type of farming method. For instance, ZigBee,
    LoRa, and Sigfox are widely used and employed in outdoor fields because they are
    cheaper and have low energy consumption and a good transmission range [22,23].
    Despite being a secure technology, Bluetooth is only used in indoor farms as it
    offers a short transmission range [22]. Wi-Fi is not a promising technology for
    agricultural applications due to its high costs and high energy consumption [22].
    RFID (radio frequency identification) and NFC (near field communication) technologies,
    on the other hand, are increasingly being implemented in agricultural systems
    for tracking agricultural products [24]. GPRS or mobile communication technology
    (2G, 3G, and 4G) are used for periodic monitoring of environmental and soil parameters.
    In addition, communication protocols mostly used in the agricultural scenarios
    are HTTP, WWW, and SMTP. Likewise, to ensure interoperability and system security
    to their context-aware functionalities, middleware HYDRA and SMEPP are mostly
    employed in agricultural systems [25]. To store data, cloud computing techniques
    are employed in the service layer. This data is then used in the application layer
    to build smart applications used by farmers, agriculture experts, and supply chain
    professionals to enhance farm monitoring capacity and productivity. Download :

    architecture of Internet of Things (IoT), (adapted) [26]. The integration of IoT
    in agriculture is meant to empower farmers with the decision tools and automation
    technologies that seamlessly integrate knowledge, products, and services to achieve
    high productivity, quality, and profit. A multitude of studies is performed and
    put forward concerning the incubation of the IoT concepts in the agricultural
    sector. The main findings of some of the studies are presented in Table 2. Multiple
    technological issues and architectural problems have been addressed through the
    development of IoT-based agricultural systems. But most of these systems are either
    in a conceptual stage or in a prototype form (not commercial) at the moment. Focus
    is mainly laid on-farm management, irrigation control, crop growth, health monitoring,
    and disease detection. Some of these studies have also explained IoT implementation
    in modern agricultural systems such as vertical farming (soilless farming - aquaponics,
    hydroponics, and aeroponics) and greenhouse farming (soil-based). Moreover, most
    studies have focused on addressing a specific problem. Table 2. IoT-driven agricultural

    networks in agriculture Wireless sensor network (WSN) is regarded as a technology
    that is used within an IoT system. It can be defined as a group of spatially distributed
    sensors for monitoring the physical conditions of the environment, temporarily
    storing the collected data, and transmitting the gathered information at a central
    location [22]. The general architecture of WSN is shown in Fig. 10. A WSN for
    smart farming is made up of numerous sensor nodes connected through a wireless
    connection module. These nodes have a variety of abilities (e.g., processing,
    transmission, and sensation) that allow them to self-organize, self-configure,
    and self-diagnose. There are different types of WSNs, which are categorized depending
    on the environment where they are deployed. These include terrestrial wireless
    sensor networks (TWSNs), wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs), underwater
    wireless sensor networks (UWSNs), wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs),
    and mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs) [55]. In agricultural applications,
    TWSN and UWSN are widely used. In TWSNs, the nodes are deployed above the ground
    surface, consisting of sensors for gathering the surrounding data. The second
    variant of WSNs is its underground counterpart – WUSNs, where sensor nodes are
    planted inside the soil. In this setting, lower frequencies easily penetrate through
    the soil, whereas higher frequencies suffer severe attenuation [56]. Therefore,
    the network requires a higher number of nodes to cover a large area because of
    the limited communication radius. Many research articles are available in the
    literature that discusses the use of WSN for different outdoor and indoor farms’
    applications such as irrigation management, water quality assessment, and environmental
    monitoring. A summary of some of these articles is given in Table 3. These studies
    have focused on developing WSNs architectures that are simplified, low cost, energy-efficient
    and scalable. Yet, various factors associated with WSNs need further attention,
    such as minimum maintenance, robust and fault-tolerant architecture, and interoperability.

    [66] 4.3. Cloud computing in agriculture According to the National Institute of
    Standard and Technologies (NIST), cloud computing (CC) is defined as a model for
    enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of
    configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications,
    and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management
    effort or service provider interaction [67]. The main architecture of CC shown
    in Fig. 11 is comprised of four layers: datacenter (hardware), infrastructure,
    platform, and application [68]. Each of these layers is linked with specific cloud
    service models, which are classified as software as a service (SaaS), platform
    as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). Cloud computing has
    gained great attention over the past decade in the agriculture sector because
    it provides: 1) inexpensive storage services for data gathered from different
    domains through WSNs and other preconfigured IoT devices, 2) large-scale computing
    systems to perform intelligent decision-making by transforming this raw data into
    useful knowledge, and 3) a secure platform to develop agricultural IoT applications
    [69]. In combination with IoT and WSN, CC is employed to develop different agricultural
    applications, most of which are presented in Tables 2 and 3. CC technology is
    also used to create operational farm management systems (FMSs) to support farmers
    and farm managers in efficient monitoring of farm operations Table 4. presents
    the salient features of some of these FMSs. Another topic of interest that is
    being explored in global research is related to the traceability of agri-product
    quality [70]. But only preliminary research has been attempted to explore traceability
    compliance with standards of food safety and quality. Download : Download high-res

    systems have the potential to solve problems of increasing food demands, environmental
    pollution caused by excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers, and the safety
    of agricultural products. These FMSs, however, do not have the capability to support
    run-time customization in relation to distinct requirements of farmers. Moreover,
    because most farm data is usually fragmented and dispersed, it is difficult to
    record farm activities properly in current FMSs applications [75]. 4.4. Edge/fog
    computing in agriculture The rapid development of IoT has led to the explosive
    growth of sensors and smart devices, generating large volumes of data. The processing
    and analysis of such an enormous amount of data in real-time are challenging because
    it increases the load on the cloud server and also reduces the response speed.
    Simply using a cloud server is not able to provide real-time response while handling
    such a large data set. Additionally, IoT applications are sensitive to network
    latency because they require a constant exchange of information between devices
    and the cloud, making CC unfeasible to handle these applications [23]. The emergence
    of the edge computing concept can resolve the problems associated with CC. This
    new computing model deploys computing and storage resources (such as cloudlets
    or fog nodes) at the edge of the network closer to data sources such as mobile
    devices or sensors. This way, it can facilitate real-time analytics while keeping
    data secure on the device [23]. Edge computing offers intriguing possibilities
    for smart agriculture, but the applications of this technology are only in their
    infancy in agricultural systems. Hence, few research studies are available in
    this area; see Table 5. Most of the edge computing-based agricultural systems
    discussed in these studies are prototypical and address a limited selection of
    problems in various agricultural domains. So far, interoperability and scalability
    issues have not received sufficient consideration. Table 5. Edge computing-based

    robot systems in agriculture Autonomous robot systems (ARS) are intelligent machines
    capable of performing tasks, making decisions, and acting in real-time, with a
    high degree of autonomy (without external influence or without explicit human
    intervention) [83]. Interest in agricultural ARS (AARS) has grown significantly
    in recent years because of their ability to automate some practices in outdoor
    and indoor farms - including seeding, watering, fertilizing, spraying, plant monitoring
    and phenotyping, environmental monitoring, disease detection, weed and pest controlling,
    and harvesting [15]. The agricultural robots use a combination of emerging technologies
    such as computer vision, WSNs, satellite navigation systems (GPS), AI, CC, and
    IoT, thereby facilitating the farmers to enhance productivity and quality of agricultural
    products. AARS in smart farming can be mobile AARS, which can move throughout
    the working field, or fixed AARS [84]. Mobile AARSs are further classified into
    unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) and 2) unnamed aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are
    explained in the following sections. 4.5.1. Unmanned ground vehicles in agriculture
    Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are agricultural robots that operate on the ground
    without a human operator. The main components of UGVs generally include; a platform
    for locomotive apparatus and manipulator, sensors for navigation, a supervisory
    control system, an interface for the control system, the communication links for
    information exchange between devices, and a system architecture for integration
    between hardware and software agents [85]. The control architecture of UGV can
    be remote-operated (controlled by a human operator via the interface) or fully
    autonomous (operated without the need for a human controller based on artificial
    intelligence technologies) [85]. Likewise, locomotive systems can be based on
    wheels, tracks, or legs [85]. Despite high ground adaptability, intrinsic omnidirectionality
    and soil protection of legged robots, they are uncommon in agriculture. However,
    when combined with wheels (wheel-legged robots), these robots offer a disruptive
    locomotion system for smart farms. In addition to their needed characteristics
    for infield operations, UGV should fulfill certain requirements such as small
    size, maneuverability, resilience, efficiency, human-friendly interface, and safety
    – to enhance crop yields and farm productivity. Table 6 summarizes the diverse
    range of UGVs designed for agricultural operations. Table 6. Different types of

    (4WD). Open-air Prototype [95] Most of the agricultural robotic systems presented
    above have a 4WD locomotive system because it offers ease of construction and
    control. The drawback of 4WD is that the wheels are strongly affected by terrains
    containing stone elements and/or cavities [85]. Hence, it is significant to explore
    other mechanisms, such as legged or wheel-legged locomotive systems. Some robots
    have computer vision systems, but due to the difficulty of developing an accurate
    and reliable system that replaces manual labor, most of these robots are built
    with a low-cost computer vision system, that is, using conventional RGB cameras.
    Moreover, most of the systems mentioned above are still in the research phase,
    with no commercial use on a large scale. 4.5.2. Unmanned aerial vehicles in agriculture
    Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or aerial robots are aircrafts with no human pilot
    on board. Depending on the type of technology incorporated to fly (wing structure)
    and autonomy level, there is a wide variety of UAVs [96]. For instance, according
    to wing type, UAVs can be fixed-wing (planes), single-rotor (helicopter), hybrid
    system (vertical takeoff and landing), and multirotor (drone). Among these, drones
    (multi-rotor technology) which are lifted and propelled by four (quadrotor) or
    six (hex-rotor) rotors, have become increasingly popular in the agriculture sector
    due to their mechanical simplicity in comparison to helicopters, which rely on
    a much more sophisticated plate control mechanism [97]. Similarly, according to
    autonomy level, UAVs can be either teleoperated in which the pilot provides references
    to each actuator of the aircraft so as to control it, in the same manner, an onboard
    pilot would, or tele-commanded in which the aircraft relies on an automatic controller
    on board that is in charge of maintaining a stable flight [96]. Equipped with
    the appropriate sensors (vision, infrared, multispectral, and hyperspectral cameras,
    etc.), agricultural UAVs allow farmers to obtain data (vegetation, leaf area,
    and reflectance indexes) from their fields to study dynamic changes in crops that
    cannot be detected by scouting the ground [98]. This data permits farmers to infer
    information related to crop diseases, nutrient deficiencies, water level, and
    other crop growth parameters. With this information, farmers can plan possible
    remedies (irrigation, fertilization, weed control, etc.). Table 7 reviews some
    of the UAV-based systems used for different agricultural operations. Table 7.

    Most of the systems mentioned above are still in the research phase, with no commercial
    use on a large scale. Other problems with these UAVs are associated with battery
    and flight time [96]. At the moment, lithium-ion batteries are being used because
    their capacity is larger than that of conventional batteries. But an increase
    in battery capacity increases the drone weight, and now research is undergoing
    to address this issue. In addition, the existing UAVs have complex user interfaces,
    and only experts can use them to perform agricultural tasks. By improving the
    user interface making it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow people
    who are older or unfamiliar with UAV technology to control it more easily. 4.6.
    Big data and analytics in agriculture Rapid developments in IoT and CC technologies
    have increased the magnitude of data immeasurably. This data, also referred to
    as Big Data (BD), includes textual content (i.e., structured, semi-structured,
    and unstructured), and multimedia content (e.g., videos, images, audio) [119].
    The process of examining this data to uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations,
    market trends, customer preferences, and other useful information is referred
    to as big data analytics (BDA). Big data is typically characterized according
    to five dimensions defined by five Vs, which are displayed in Fig. 12 [120]. The
    paradigm of BD-driven smart agriculture is comparatively new, but the trend of
    this application is positive as it has the capacity to bring a revolutionary change
    in the food supply chain and food security through increased production. Agricultural
    big data is usually generated from various sectors and stages in agriculture,
    which can be collected either from agricultural fields through ground sensors,
    aerial vehicles, and ground vehicles using special cameras and sensors; from governmental
    bodies in the form of reports and regulations; from private organizations through
    online web services; from farmers in the form of knowledge through surveys; or
    from social media [120]. The data can be environmental (weather, climate, moisture
    level, etc.), biological (plant disease), or geo-spatial depending on the agricultural
    domain and differs in volume, velocity, and formats [121]. The gathered data is
    stored in a computer database and processed by computer algorithms for analyzing
    seed characteristics, weather patterns, soil properties (like pH or nutrient content),
    marketing and trade management, consumers’ behavior, and inventory management.
    A variety of techniques and tools are employed to analyze big data in agriculture.
    A summary of some of the studies is given in Table 8. Machine learning, cloud-based
    platforms, and modeling and simulation are the most commonly used techniques.
    Particularly, machine learning tools are used in prediction, clustering, and classification
    problems. Whereas cloud platforms are used for large-scale data storing, preprocessing,
    and visualization. There are still many potential areas that are not adequately
    covered in existing literature, where BDA can be applied to address various agricultural
    issues. For instance, these include data-intensive greenhouses and indoor vertical
    farming systems, quality control and health monitoring of crops in outdoor and
    indoor farms, genetic engineering, decision support platforms to assist farmers
    in the design of indoor vertical farms, and scientific models for policymakers
    to assist them in decision-making regarding the sustainability of the physical
    ecosystem. Lastly, most systems are still in the prototypical stage. Download

    [125] 4.7. Artificial intelligence in agriculture Artificial intelligence (AI)
    involves the development of theory and computer systems capable of performing
    tasks requiring human intelligence, such as sensorial perception and decision-making
    [126]. Combined with CC, IoT, and big data, AI, particularly in the facet of machine
    learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), is regarded as one of the key drivers behind
    the digitization of agriculture. These technologies have the potential to enhance
    crop production and improve real-time monitoring, harvesting, processing, and
    marketing [127]. Several intelligent agricultural systems are developed that use
    ML and DL algorithms to determine various parameters like weed detection, yield
    prediction, or disease identification. These systems are discussed in the next
    two sub-sections. 4.7.1. Machine learning in agriculture Machine learning (ML)
    techniques are broadly classified into three categories: 1) supervised learning
    (linear regression, regression trees, non-linear regression, Bayesian linear regression,
    polynomial regression, and support vector regression), 2) unsupervised learning
    (k-means clustering, hierarchal clustering, anomaly detection, neural networks
    (NN), principal component analysis, independent component analysis, a-priori algorithm
    and singular value decomposition (SVD)); and 3) reinforcement learning (Markov
    decision process (MDP) and Q learning) [128]. ML techniques and algorithms are
    implemented in the agriculture sector for crop yield prediction, disease, and
    weed detection, weather prediction (rainfall), soil properties estimation (type,
    moisture content, pH, temperature, etc.), water management, determination of the
    optimal amount of fertilizer, and livestock production and management [129] Table
    9. presents a list of publications where different ML algorithms are utilized
    for various agricultural applications. From the analysis of these articles, “crop
    yield prediction” is a widely explored area, and linear regression, neural network
    (NN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) is the most used ML
    techniques to enable smart farming. The presented use cases are still in the research
    phase with no reported commercial usage at the moment. Moreover, it is also found
    that AI and ML techniques are sparsely explored in the greenhouse and indoor vertical
    farming systems, particularly hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics. There are
    only a few publications available summarized in the same table where ML techniques
    are employed. Considering the digital transformation''s cyber-security and data
    privacy challenges, new approaches such as federated learning and privacy-preserving
    methods are being developed to enable digital farming [130]. These approaches
    build ML models from local parameters without sharing private data samples, thus
    mitigating security issues. Table 9. Machine learning-based agricultural systems.

    Prototype [148] 4.7.2. Deep learning in agriculture Deep learning (DL) represents
    the extension of classical ML that can solve complex problems (predictions and
    classification) particularly well and fast because more “depth” (complexity) is
    added into the model. The primary advantage of DL is feature learning which involves
    automatic extraction of features (high-level information) from large datasets
    [149]. Different DL algorithms are convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long
    short term memory (LSTM) networks, recurrent neural (RNN) networks, generative
    adversarial networks (GANs), radial basis function networks (RBFNs), multilayer
    perceptron (MLPs), feedforward artificial neural network (ANN), self-organizing
    maps (SOMs), deep belief networks (DBNs), restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs),
    and autoencoders. A detailed description of these algorithms, popular architectures,
    and training platforms is available at various sources [150]. Fig. 13 illustrates
    an example of DL architecture of CNN [151]. In the agriculture sector, DL algorithms
    are mostly used to solve problems associated with computer vision applications
    that target the prediction of key parameters, such as crop yields, soil moisture
    content, weather conditions, and crop growth conditions; the detection of diseases,
    pests, and weed; and the identification of leaf or plant species [152]. Computer
    vision is an interdisciplinary field that has been gaining huge amounts of traction
    in recent years due to the surge in CNNs. It offers methods and techniques that
    allow the processing of digital images accurately and enables computers to interpret
    and understand the visual world [153]. A summary of agricultural applications
    using DL and computer vision techniques is given in Table 10. Among all the DL
    algorithms, CNNs or Convet and its variants are the most used algorithms in agricultural
    applications. The variants of CNN are region-based CNNs (RCNN), Fast-RCNN, Faster-RCNN,
    YOLO, and Mask-RCNN, among which the first four are mostly used to solve object
    detection problems. Mask-RCNN, on the other hand, is used to solve instance segmentation
    problems. The reader could refer to the existing bibliography for a detailed description
    of these algorithms and their applications [152]. Few studies have also used other
    DL techniques. Talking about datasets, most DL models are trained using images,
    and few models are trained using sensor data gathered from fields. This shows
    that DL can be applied to a wide variety of datasets. It is also observed that
    most of the work is done on outdoor farms, whereas next-generation farms (environment-controlled)
    are not extensively explored. Though DL has the potential to enable digital farming,
    most systems are still in the prototype phase. Additionally, the new challenges
    imposed by cyber-security and privacy issues require optimization of current DL
    and computer vision approaches. Download : Download high-res image (334KB) Download

    decision support systems A decision support system (DSS) can be defined as a smart
    system that supports decision-making to specific demands and problems by providing
    operational answers to stakeholders and potential users based on useful information
    extracted from raw data, documents, personal knowledge, and/or models [170]. DSS
    can be data-driven, model-driven, communication-driven, document-driven, and knowledge-driven.
    The salient features of these DSSs are available at following source [171]. Fig.
    14 presents the general architecture of a DSS, consisting of four fundamental
    components, each having its specific purpose. Download : Download high-res image

    (adapted) [187]. Due to the evolution of agriculture 4.0, the amount of farming
    data has increased immensely. To transfer this heterogenous data into practical
    knowledge, platforms like agricultural decision support systems (ADSS) are required
    to make evidence-based and precise decisions regarding farm operation and facility
    layout [172]. Over the past few years, ADSSs are gaining much attention in the
    agriculture sector. A number of ADSSs have been developed that focus on a variety
    of agricultural aspects, such as farm management, water management, and environmental
    management. Table 11 presents a summary of the ADSSs found in the literature.
    From this analysis, most ADSSs have been found to not consider expert knowledge,
    which is highly valuable as it allows to development of systems as per user''s
    needs. The other reported issues with some of these ADDSs are complex GUIs, inadequate
    re-planning components, a lack of prediction and forecast abilities, and a lack
    of ability to adapt to uncertain and dynamic factors. It is also worth noting
    that all the ADSSs are for outdoor agricultural systems and are in the research
    phase. In comparison, the application of ADSS in indoor soilless farming is still
    very much unexploited. Table 11. Agricultural decision support systems. Use case

    As one of the main technologies of Industry 4.0, a cyber-physical system (CPS)
    refers to an automated distributed system that integrates physical processes with
    communication networks and computing infrastructures [184]. There are three standard
    CPS reference architecture models: namely, 5C, RAMI 4.0, and IIRA, and their detailed
    description is available at following source [185]. Among these, the 5C is a well-known
    reference model with widespread usage. The architecture of 5C consists of five
    levels which are represented in Fig. 15. CPS benefits from a variety of existing
    technologies such as agent systems, IoT, CC, augmented reality, big data, and
    ML [186]. Its implementation ensures scalability, adaptability, autonomy, reliability,
    resilience, safety, and security improvements. Download : Download high-res image

    process, (adapted) [199]. Agricultural field is regarded as one of the complex
    domains that can benefit from CPS technology. Agricultural cyber-physical systems
    (ACPSs) use advanced electronic technologies and agricultural facilities to build
    integrated farm management systems that interact with the physical environment
    to maintain an optimal growth environment for crops [188]. ACPSs collect the essential
    and appropriate data about climate, soil, and crops, with high accuracy and use
    it to manage watering, humidity, and plant health, etc. A variety of ACPSs has
    been developed for the management of different services, and their summary is
    given in Table 12. Looking at these ACPSs, most systems are still at the prototype
    and conceptual level. Moreover, most studies are conducted for outdoor farms,
    with only a few works published related to soil-based greenhouse systems. No study
    is found that is relevant to indoor soilless farming systems. ACPSs has attracted
    significant research interest because of their promising applications across different
    domains; deploying CPS models in real-life applications is still a challenge as
    it requires proper hardware and software [189]. Moreover, particular attention
    should be given to autonomy, robustness, and resilience while engineering ACPSs
    in order to handle the unpredictability of the environment and the uncertainty
    of the characteristics of agricultural facilities. There are multiple factors
    (humans, sensors, robots, crops, and data, among others) that impact ACPSs. To
    ensure a smooth operation while avoiding conflicts, errors, and disruptions, ACPSs
    need to be designed carefully and comprehensively. Table 12. Agricultural cyber-physical

    in agriculture Digital twin (DT) is a dynamic virtual replica of a real-life (physical)
    object of which it mirrors its behaviors and states over multiple stages of object''s
    lifecycle by using real-world data, simulation, and machine learning models, combined
    with data analytics to enable understanding, learning, and reasoning [198]. A
    complete description of the DT concept for any physical system requires consolidation
    and formalization of various characteristics, including the physical and virtual
    entities, the physical and virtual environments, the metrology, and realization
    modules that perform the physical to virtual and the virtual to physical connection
    or twinning, the twinning and twinning rate, and the physical and virtual processes
    [199]. The schematic showing the mapping of these characteristics is shown in
    Fig. 16. The DT concept has gained prominence due to the advances in the technologies
    such as the Internet of Things, big data, wireless sensor networks, and cloud
    computing. This is because these technologies allow real-time monitoring of physical
    twins at high spatial resolutions through both miniature devices and remote sensing
    that produce ever-increasing data streams [21]. The concept of DT in agricultural
    applications is rather immature as compared to other disciplines with its first
    references occurred in 2017; hence its added value has not yet been discussed
    extensively [21]. This is because framing is a highly complex and dynamic domain
    because of its dependence on natural conditions (climate, soil, humidity) and
    presence of living physical twins (plants and animals) and non-living physical
    twins (indoor farm buildings, grow beds, outdoor agricultural fields, agricultural
    machinery). The non-living physical twins interact directly or indirectly with
    plants and animals (living physical twins), thereby introducing more challenges
    for DT in agriculture. Whereas in other domains such as manufacturing DTs are
    mostly concerned with non-living physical twins. Table 13 summarises the agricultural
    DTs developed in the last 10 years. Table 13. Digital twins in agriculture Use

    have focused on open-air farming systems. Only one study is found that has proposed
    DT for soil-based vertical farming system and one study that implemented DT for
    soilless farming system (aquaponics). This might be because the design and management
    of modern farming systems are challenging. Moreover, most DTs are in the research
    phase with no commercial deployment at the moment. The reported benefits of the
    DT applications in agriculture are cost reductions, catastrophe prevention, clearer
    decision making, and efficient management operations, which can be applied to
    several agricultural subfields like plant and animal breeding, aquaponics, vertical
    farming, cropping systems, and livestock farming. While DT technology has great
    potential, achieving the synchronization between the physical entity and its digital
    counterpart is challenging. The complexity of this process is further amplified
    in agricultural systems due to the idiosyncrasies of living physical twins. Hence,
    implementation of agricultural DT should start with micro-farms, which can then
    be gradually enhanced to an intelligent and autonomous version by incorporating
    more components. 4.11. Roadblocks in digitization of agriculture industry This
    section provides an answer to RQ3 by listing a series of interconnected roadblocks
    hampering a larger adoption of digital technologies in the agriculture sector.
    After analysing 148 articles, 21 roadblocks are identified which can be categorized
    at technical and socio-economic levels. 4.12. Technical roadblocks • Interoperability:
    data is considered a cornerstone for the success of smart systems. Agricultural
    data usually comes from multiple heterogeneous sources such as thousands of individual
    farmlands, animal factories, and enterprise applications. This data can have diverse
    formats, making data integration complex. Hence, data interoperability is essential
    to enhance the value of this massively dispersed data after systematic data collection,
    storage, processing, and knowledge mining [208]. Likewise, for establishing effective
    communication between heterogeneous devices, they need to be interconnected and
    interoperable. With cross-technology communication, interoperability of the system
    can be improved [209]. • Standardization: to fully exploit the digital technologies
    for smart farming applications, standardization of the devices is essential. Output
    differences can occur because of misinterpretation and alterations from time to
    time. With standardization, the interoperability issues of the devices, applications,
    and systems can also be resolved [25]. • Dataquality: to produce meaningful results,
    data quality is also crucial along with data security, storage, and openness.
    The lack of decentralized data management systems is another roadblock hindering
    the adoption of smart farming practices [9]. This issue decreases the willingness
    of multiple actors to share agriculture data. • Hardwareimplementation: the deployment
    of a smart agricultural setup in large-scale open fields is extremely challenging.
    This is because all the hardware consisting of IoT devices, wireless sensor networks,
    sensor nodes, machinery, and equipment directly exposed to harsh environmental
    conditions such as heavy rainfall, high/low-temperature levels, extreme humidity,
    strong wind speeds and many other possible dangers which can destroy electronic
    circuits or disrupt their normal functionality [210]. A possible solution is to
    build an adequate casing for all the costly devices that is robust and durable
    enough to endure real field conditions [211]. • Adequatepower sources: typically,
    the wireless devices deployed at farms consistently operate for a long time and
    have limited battery life. A suitable energy saving scheme is necessary because,
    in case of any failure, instant battery replacement is complicated, especially
    in open-air farms where devices are strategically placed with minimum access [210].
    The possible solutions to optimize energy consumption are usage of low power sensors
    and, proper management of communication [24,212]. Wireless power transfer and
    self-supporting wireless system are other promising solutions to eliminate the
    need for battery replacement by recharging the batteries through electromagnetic
    waves. However, long-distance wireless charging is needed in most agricultural
    applications [9]. Ambient energy harvesting from rivers, fluid flow, movement
    of vehicles and, ground surface using sensor nodes offers another viable solution,
    but the converted electrical energy is limited at present – posing the need to
    improve power conversion efficiency [213]. • Reliability: The reliability of devices,
    as well as corresponding software applications, is crucial. This is because IoT
    devices need to gather and transfer the data based on which decisions are made
    using several software packages. Unreliable sensing, processing, and transmission
    can cause false monitoring data reports, long delays, and even data loss – eventually
    impacting the performance of agricultural system [25]. • Adaptability: agricultural
    environments are complex, dynamic, and rapidly changing. Hence, when designing
    a system, it is pertinent for the devices and applications to proactively adapt
    with the other entities under uncertain and dynamic factors - offering the needed
    performance [214]. • Robust wirelessarchitectures: wireless networks and communication
    technologies offer several benefits in terms of low cost, wide-area coverage,
    adequate networking flexibility, and high scalability. But dynamic agriculture
    environments such as temperature variations, living objects’ movements, and the
    presence of obstacles pose severe challenges to reliable wireless communication.
    For instance, fluctuations in the signal intensity occur due to the multipath
    propagation effects – causing unstable connectivity and inadequate data transmission
    [215]. These factors impact the performance of the agricultural system. Hence,
    there is a need for robust and fault-tolerant wireless architectures with appropriate
    location of sensor nodes, antenna height, network topology, and communication
    protocols that also require minimum maintenance [11]. • Interference: another
    challenge is wireless interference and degradation of the quality of service because
    of the dense deployment of IoT devices and wireless sensor networks. These issues
    can be mitigated with efficient channel scheduling between heterogeneous sensing
    devices, cognitive radio-assisted WSNs, and emerging networking primitives such
    as concurrent transmission [216]. Since agriculture devices are distributed at
    indoor greenhouses, outdoor farmlands, underground areas, or even water areas,
    cross-media communication between underground, underwater, and air is also required
    for the complete incorporation of smart technologies [217]. • Security and privacy:
    the distributed nature of smart agricultural systems brings potential vulnerabilities
    to cyber-attacks such as eavesdropping, data integrity, denial-of-service attacks,
    or other types of disruptions that may risk privacy, integrity, and availability
    of the system [218]. Cyber-security is a major challenge that needs to be addressed
    within the context of smart farming, with diverse privacy-preserving mechanisms
    and federated learning approaches [130]. • Compatibility: to achieve the standards
    of fragmentation and scalability, the models or software applications developed
    should be flexible and run on any machine installed in the agricultural system
    [13]. • Resource optimization: farmers require a resource optimization process
    to estimate the optimal number of IoT devices and gateways, cloud storage size,
    and amount of transmitted data to improve farm profitability. Since farms have
    different sizes and need distinct types of sensors to measure different variables,
    resource optimization is challenging [219]. Secondly, most of the farm management
    systems do not offer run-time customization in relation to the distinct requirements
    of farmers. Hence, complex mathematical models and algorithms are required to
    estimate adequate resource allocation [75]. • Scalability: the number of devices,
    machinery, and sensors installed at farms is increasing gradually due to advancements
    in technologies. To support these entities, gateways, network applications, and
    back-end databases should be reliable and scalable [220]. • Human-centereduserinterfaces:
    complex user interfaces of existing agricultural applications and devices are
    impeding smart farming practices. Most GUI is designed in a way that only experts
    can use to perform agricultural tasks. Improving the user interface by making
    it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow a larger group of people
    to use it to perform different agricultural operations [96]. 4.13. Socio-economic
    roadblocks • Gap between farmers and researchers: the participation of farmers
    is a key factor toward the success of the digitization of the agricultural industry.
    Farmers face a lot of problems during the agri-food production process, which
    smart technologies could fix, but agricultural experts are not usually aware of
    these issues [16]. Moreover, to devise an adequate smart solution, first, it is
    important to fully understand the nature of problems. Hence, it is essential to
    bridge the gap between farmers, agricultural professionals, and AI researchers.
    • Costs associated with smart systems: the costs associated with the adoption
    of smart technologies and systems are the major deterrent in the digitization
    of the agricultural sector. These costs usually involve deployment, operating,
    and maintenance costs. The deployment costs of smart systems are usually very
    high as they involve; i) hardware installation such as autonomous robots and drones,
    WSNs, gateways, and base station infrastructure, etc., to perform certain farm
    operations, and ii) hiring the skilled labour [221]. Likewise, to facilitate data
    processing, management of IoT devices and equipment, and knowledge exchange, subscription
    of centralized networks and software packages is required, which ultimately increases
    the operating costs [222]. Though sometimes service providers offer free subscription
    packages with restricted features, the amount of storage capacity is limited.
    To ensure the adequate operations of the smart system, occasional maintenance
    is required, which then also adds up to total costs. Other types of costs associated
    with smart systems deployment could be environmental, ethical, and social costs.
    To overcome cost related roadblocks, initiatives focusing on cooperative farming
    are needed that provide; i) support services for better handling of costs and
    needed investments, and ii) hardware solutions to transform conventional equipment
    into smart farm-ready machinery to reduce high initial costs [222]. • Digital
    division: another factor that is slowing the digitization of the agricultural
    sector is the lack of knowledge of digital technologies and their applications.
    The majority of farmers have no idea about the significance of digital technologies,
    how to implement and use them, and which technology is suitable for their farm
    and meets their requirements [14]. Hence, it is essential to educate farmers about
    modern farming technologies and systems. Moreover, different strategies are needed
    to build tools using natural language that farmers with low education levels can
    easily understand [223]. • Return on investment: in agriculture, the profit margin
    is very important like other sectors. When it comes to the implementation of advanced
    technologies, farmers have concerns related to the time to recover the investment
    and to the difficulties in evaluating the advantages [12]. • Trust building: unlike
    in other disciplines, building trust regarding the effectiveness of smart technologies
    in agriculture is difficult because many decisions affect systems that involve
    living and non-living entities, and consequences can be hard to reverse [16].
    Additionally, insufficient proof of the impact of digital tools on-farm productivity
    further intensifies the current challenges. • Laws and regulations: different
    regions and countries have different legal frameworks which impact the implementation
    of digital technologies in the agriculture sector, particularly in monitoring
    and agri-food supply [70]. Likewise, regulations related to resource allocation
    (spectrum for wireless devices), data privacy, and security also vary from one
    country to another [70]. • Connectivity infrastructure: most less-developed countries
    usually have insufficient connectivity infrastructure that limits access to advanced
    digital tools that would help to turn data from heterogenous sources into valuable
    and actionable insights [10]. 4.14. Discussion This section discusses the main
    conclusions of RQ1, RQ2, and RQ3. In addition, added value, considerations, and
    future directions are also presented to ensure higher accuracy and great advancements
    in agricultural industry. 4.15. RQ1, RQ2 and RQ3 The present study tried to articulate
    the emerging digital technologies being implemented in agricultural industry to
    anticipate the future trajectories of agriculture 4.0. By looking at Table 2,
    Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, Table 8, Table 9, Table 10, Table
    11, Table 12, Table 13 in section 4, it can be seen some technologies such as
    big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and
    digital twins are not significantly explored in agriculture. A reason for this
    gap could be that implementing advanced technologies with more complex operations
    can be expensive, at least in the early experimental phase of their adoption.
    Hence, the development of these technologies in agricultural industry should increase
    in the coming years. The results of SLR also show that IoT is significantly implemented
    in farms. This is due to the broad functionality of IoT such as in the monitoring,
    tracking and tracing, agriculture machinery, and precision agriculture [21]. It
    can be said that IoT is one of the main research objectives within the agriculture
    4.0 approaches. Nevertheless, only few studies have considered data security and
    reliability, scalability, and interoperability while developing an intelligent
    agricultural system. The research findings also demonstrated that most use cases
    are still in the prototype phase. The possible reason could be because most agricultural
    operations have to do with living subjects, like animals and plants or perishable
    products, and developing systems is harder than non-living human-made systems.
    Another reason might be that agriculture is a slow adopter of technology because
    of transdisciplinary nature of this field, and hence to develop intelligent systems,
    the agricultural community must become familiar will all the digital technologies.
    Lastly, variations in plant/crops’ species, and growth conditions also make digitization
    of agricultural systems complex [188]. The SLR findings also show that most of
    the systems are developed for open-air soil-based farms contrary to indoor farms
    (soilless and soil-based). This is due to complex design and management of indoor
    farms particularly soilless farms where parameters and factors (pH, air temperature,
    humidity, etc.) to be controlled are diverse [5]. But with introduction of digital
    technologies and data-driven computer applications in indoor farms, a more robust
    control of the process can be achieved. Furthermore, it is also revealed from
    SLR that limited research is conducted in three (soil management, fruit detection
    and counting and crop quality management) out of nine different service categories
    mentioned in section 3. This corroborates that substantial research and development
    is needed in some areas to ensure successful digitization of agriculture industry
    in developed countries as well as in developing countries. The complexity of agriculture
    ecosystem presents a series of interconnected roadblocks that hinder the full
    integration of digital technologies for agriculture 4.0 realization. Hence, it
    is essential to identify potential roadblocks in order to come up with strategic
    solutions to overcome them. This study is an attempt to explore what these roadblocks
    are. Based on analysis, 21 roadblocks were identified and classified at technical
    and socio-economic levels. These roadblocks are listed in section 5, which suggests
    what needs to be done for digitization of agricultural industry on larger scale.
    But it is still not known, to what extent elimination or mitigation of these roadblocks
    assist in successful integration of digital technologies. 4.16. Added value of
    agricultural digitization Based on analysis, several benefits that can motivate
    framers and other actors to support digitization of agricultural industry are
    identified and summarised below. The presented benefits have potential to maximise
    the farm''s productivity and enhance product quality, but they should not be considered
    a panacea for challenges associated with smart agriculture [222]. • Improved agility:
    digital technologies improve the agility of farm operations. Through real-time
    surveillance and forecast systems, farmers or agricultural experts can rapidly
    react to any potential fluctuations in environmental and water conditions to save
    crops [221]. • Green process: digital technologies make the farming process more
    environmentally friendly and climate-resilient by significantly reducing the usage
    of in-field fuel, nitrogen fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides [224]. • Resource
    use efficiency: digital platforms can improve resource use efficiency by enhancing
    the quantity and quality of agricultural output and limiting the usage of water,
    energy, fertilizers, and pesticides [3]. • Time and cost savings: digital technologies
    enable significant time and cost savings by automating different operations, such
    as harvesting, sowing, or irrigation, controlling the application of fertilizers
    or pesticides, and scheduling the irrigation [225]. • Asset management: digital
    technologies allow real-time surveillance of farm properties and equipment to
    prevent theft, expedite component replacement and perform routine maintenance
    [10]. • Product safety: digital technologies ensure adequate farm productivity
    and guarantee a safe and nutritious supply of agri-food products by preventing
    fraud related to adulteration, counterfeit, and artificial enhancement [218].
    4.17. Considerations and future prospects The upcoming initiatives would result
    in significant improvements in the agricultural sector. But in order to make things
    sustainable for small and medium-scale growers, roadblocks mentioned in section
    5 need to be addressed first. Awareness campaigns highlighting the significance
    of smart agriculture at every level of the agricultural value chain and promoting
    innovative ways (such as gamification) to encourage stakeholders to take on an
    active role in the digital revolution can mitigate some of the mentioned roadblocks
    [9]. Government level initiatives, grants and endowments, public-private partnerships,
    the openness of data, and regional basis research work can also assist in coping
    with potential roadblocks. Lastly, a roadmap can be adopted while developing a
    smart agriculture system, starting from basic architecture with few components
    and simpler functionality, gradually adding components and functionality to develop
    a complex system with the full potential of digitization [21]. These considerations
    can pave the way for successful implementation of agriculture 4.0. The future
    prospects of digital technologies in smart agriculture involve using explainable
    artificial intelligence to monitor crop growth, estimate crop biomass, evaluate
    crop health, and control pests and diseases. Explainable AI fades away the traditional
    black-box concept of machine learning and enables understanding the reasons behind
    any specific decision [15]. Description of big data through common semantics and
    ontologies and the adoption of open standards have great potential to boost research
    and development towards smart farming . Similarly, to ensure enhanced connectivity
    and live streaming of crop data, 5G technology need to be extensively explored
    [6]. 5G technology will minimize internet costs and augment the overall user experience
    of farm management and food safety by performing accurate crop inspections remotely
    [226]. Furthermore, it will significantly bridge the gap between stakeholders
    by keeping them well informed on produce availability. Lastly, blockchain in combination
    with IoT and other technologies can be implemented to address the challenges related
    to data privacy and security [227]. 4.18. Transition to Agriculture 5.0 The industrial
    revolutions have always brought a breakthrough in the agricultural sector. As
    formally discussed in previous sections, agriculture 4.0 has great potential to
    counterbalance the growing food demands and prepare for future by reinforcing
    agricultural systems with WSN, IoT, AI, etc. While the realization of agriculture
    4.0 is still underway, there is already a talk about agriculture 5.0. Agriculture
    5.0 extends agriculture 4.0 with inclusion of industry 5.0 principles to produce
    healthy and affordable food while ensuring to prevent degradation of the ecosystems
    on which life depends [228]. The European Commission formally called for the Fifth
    Industrial Revolution (industry 5.0) in 2021 after observing that industry 4.0
    focuses less on the original principles of social fairness and sustainability
    but more on digitalization and AI-driven technologies for increasing the efficiency
    and flexibility [229]. Industry 5.0 complements and extends industry 4.0 concept
    to recognize the human-centricity, sustainability, and resilience [230]. It involves
    refining the collaborative interactions between humans and machines, reducing
    environmental impact through circular economy, and developing high degree of robustness
    in systems to achieve optimal balance between efficiency and productivity. The
    enabling technologies of industry 5.0 are Cobots (collaborative robots), smart
    materials with embedded bio-inspired sensors, digital twins, AI, energy efficient
    and secure data management, renewable energy sources, etc [229].. In agriculture
    5.0 settings, farm''s production efficiency and crop quality can be enhanced by
    assigning repetitive and monotonous tasks to the machines and the tasks which
    need critical thinking to the humans. For this purpose, similar to manufacturing
    sector cyber physical cognitive systems (CPCS) that observe/study the environment
    and take actions accordingly should be developed for agricultural sector. This
    may include collaborative farm robots which will work in the fields and assist
    crop producers in tedious tasks such as seed sowing and harvesting etc. Likewise,
    digital twins in agriculture 5.0 can also offer significant value by identifying
    technical issues in agricultural systems and overcoming them at a faster speed,
    detecting crop diseases, and making crop yield predictions at a higher accuracy
    rate. This shows that agriculture 5.0 has potential to pave a way for climate
    smart, sustainable and resilient agriculture but as of now, it is in the developing
    phase. 5. Conclusions Increased concerns about global food security have accelerated
    the need for next-generation industrial farms and intensive production methods
    in agriculture. At the forefront of this modern agricultural era, digital technologies
    offered by Industry 4.0 initiative are suggesting a myriad of creative solutions.
    The scientific community and researchers integrate disruptive technologies in
    conventional agriculture systems to increase crop yields, minimize costs, reduce
    wastes, and maintain process inputs. An SLR discussing the prevailing state of
    these technologies in the agriculture sector is presented in this study. After
    applying SLR protocol, 148 articles were considered from the time frame of the
    year 2011 to 2021. Various research questions pertaining to i) current and continuing
    research trends, ii) functionality, maturity level, farm type and tools and techniques
    used, iii) primary roadblocks, and iv) added value of digital technologies; were
    put forward and answered. Several conclusions are drawn such as integration of
    big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and
    digital twins in agriculture is only in its infancy, and most use cases are in
    the prototype phase. Likewise, 21 roadblocks are identified and classified at
    technical and socioeconomic levels. To ensure the digitization of agricultural
    industry, these roadblocks must be analyzed and overcome. The added value of digital
    technologies in agriculture industry are also identified and presented in the
    study. Overall, this study contributes to the research being carried around agriculture
    4.0. The primary limitation of this review is twofold: firstly, only three online
    repositories are considered for literature search (Scopus, IEEE and Science Direct),
    and secondly additional keywords and synonyms might return more studies. In both
    scenarios, it is highly unlikely that the overall findings would change. For the
    future work, additional research databases and aspects can be considered to provide
    holistic overview of agricultural industry in terms of digitization. Moreover,
    studies targeting agriculture 5.0 in general will also be included. Declaration

    \ (IoT) with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)\noccurred, tens of applications including\
    \ smart agriculture have emerged to offer innovative solutions\nto modernize the\
    \ farming sector. This paper aims to present a low-cost platform for comprehensive\n\
    environmental parameter monitoring using ﬂying IoT. This platform is deployed\
    \ and tested in a real\nscenario on a farm in Medenine, Tunisia, in the period\
    \ of March 2020 to March 2021. The experi-\nmental work fulﬁlls the requirements\
    \ of automated and real-time monitoring of the environmental\nparameters using\
    \ both under- and aboveground sensors. These IoT sensors are on a farm collecting\n\
    vast amounts of environmental data, where it is sent to ground gateways every\
    \ 1 h, after which the\nobtained data is collected and transmitted by a drone\
    \ to the cloud for storage and analysis every 12 h.\nThis low-cost platform can\
    \ help farmers, governmental, or manufacturers to predict environmental\ndata\
    \ over the geographically large farm ﬁeld, which leads to enhancement in crop\
    \ productivity and\nfarm management in a cost-effective, and timely manner. Obtained\
    \ experimental results infer that\nautomated and human-made sets of actions can\
    \ be applied and/or suggested, due to the innovative\nintegration between IoT\
    \ sensors with the drone. These smart actions help in precision agriculture,\n\
    which, in turn, intensely boost crop productivity, saving natural resources.\n\
    Keywords: Internet of Things; Unmanned Aerial Vehicles; smart farming; environmental\
    \ parame-\nters; LoRa\n1. Introduction\nThe Food and Agriculture Organization\
    \ (FAO) predicts that by 2050, the world popu-\nlation will hit 9.73 billion,\
    \ and by 2100, it will be 11.2 billion; with the current population of\napproximately\
    \ 7.84 billion, this shows an increase of approximately 25% [1]. To feed this\n\
    larger population, food production should double by 2050 [2]. For example, the\
    \ current\nﬁgure of 2.1 billion tons of annual cereal production should reach\
    \ approximately 3 billion\ntons [3]. This means there is a serious need to enhance\
    \ productivity and meet the demands\nof nations [4]. However, the current agricultural\
    \ land is restricted by various factors such as\nland and climate patterns, population\
    \ density, and rapid urbanization, which are constantly\nposing threats to the\
    \ availability of arable land [5]. To illustrate, in 1991, the total arable\n\
    area for food production was 19.5 million square miles (39.47% of the world’s\
    \ land area),\nwhich was reduced to approximately 18.6 million square miles (37.73%\
    \ of the world’s land\narea) in 2013 [6]. Thus, the gap between the demand and\
    \ supply of food is becoming\nmore signiﬁcant and alarming as time progresses.\
    \ Therefore, authors in the literature [7,8]\nemphasize the signiﬁcance of enhancing\
    \ farm management by using scientiﬁc strategies\nSustainability 2021, 13, 5908.\
    \ https://doi.org/10.3390/su13115908\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\n\
    Sustainability 2021, 13, 5908\n2 of 26\nand technology in the agricultural ﬁeld,\
    \ which, in turn, drastically boost crop productivity\nand help in saving natural\
    \ resources [9,10].\nIn recent years of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR),\
    \ researchers, engineers, and\nIT specialists are striving to participate in employing\
    \ advanced technology to achieve\na better life for our planet, as Figure 1 shows\
    \ [11,12]. One of those pillars of 4IR is IoT,\nwhich is considered as the fuel\
    \ of the 4IR since it contributes effectively by linking trillions\nof objects\
    \ and sensors, all of which generate real-time data. It is expected that around\n\
    100 billion devices have been connected to the internet by 2020 [13,14]. This\
    \ number will\nfurther increase since the IoT is progressively entering a wide\
    \ array of sectors and indus-\ntries, ranging from manufacturing, health, communications,\
    \ and energy to the agricultural\nindustry [15]. In an agricultural environment,\
    \ for instance, IoT technology has been uti-\nlized to deal with distributed data\
    \ collection from farming environments and, important\nfor directing farmers,\
    \ with real-time information of the farming ﬁeld [16]. On the other\nhand, integration\
    \ between IoT and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) attracts researchers’\nattention\
    \ for various reasons. UAVs’ reliability, ﬂexibility, portability, line of sight\

    In recent years of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), researchers, engineers,\
    \ an\nIT specialists are striving to participate in employing advanced technology\
    \ to achieve \nbetter life for our planet, as Figure 1 shows [11,12]. One of those\

    \ effectively by linking trillions o\nobjects and sensors, all of which generate\
    \ real-time data. It is expected that around 10\nbillion devices have been connected\
    \ to the internet by 2020 [13,14]. This number will fu\nther increase since the\
    \ IoT is progressively entering a wide array of sectors and industrie\nranging\
    \ from manufacturing, health, communications, and energy to the agricultural in\n\
    dustry [15]. In an agricultural environment, for instance, IoT technology has\
    \ been utilize\nto deal with distributed data collection from farming environments\
    \ and, important fo\ndirecting farmers, with real-time information of the farming\
    \ field [16]. On the other hand\nintegration between IoT and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles\
    \ (UAVs) attracts researchers’ a\ntention for various reasons. UAVs’ reliability,\
    \ flexibility, portability, line of sight (LoS\nconnectivity, efficiency, applicability,\
    \ rapid deployment, and low maintenance cost ar\nvalid reasons for considering\
    \ such a technology. UAVs cover a wide range of platform\nfrom drones to high\

    \ Long-Range Wide-Area Network (LoRa)-based\nIoT platform for Smart Farming Modular\
    \ IoT Architecture called LoRaFarM that aims to im-\nprove generic farms management\
    \ in a highly customizable way. The proposed LoRaFarM\nplatform has been evaluated\
    \ in a real farm in Italy, where it collected environmental data\n(air, soil,\
    \ temperature, and humidity) related to the growth of farm products (e.g., grapes\n\
    and greenhouse vegetables) over a period of three months. A web-based visualization\
    \ tool\nfor the collected data is also presented, to validate the LoRaFarM architecture.\n\
    Authors in [27] developed a hierarchical smart farming structure based on the\
    \ collabo-\nration between UAVs and federated Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs)\
    \ for crop monitoring.\nTwo important aspects of such collaboration have been\
    \ considered: designing the UAV tra-\njectories for efﬁcient data collection and\
    \ implementing effective data processing algorithms\n(consensus and symbolic aggregate\
    \ approximation) at the network level to assess relevant\ndata transmission. Experiments\
    \ were carried out at a Romanian research institute where\nSustainability 2021,\
    \ 13, 5908\n4 of 26\ndifferent crops and methods are developed. The results demonstrate\
    \ that the collaborative\nUAV–WSN–IoT approach increases the performances in both\
    \ smart farming and ecological\nagriculture.\nA smart agriculture management system\
    \ (SAMS) was introduced in [28], which\nproposed an automated system to help farmers\
    \ to increase crop production by crashing\ninto natural resources. The system\
    \ used different sensors to collect data required for the\ngrowth of the crop,\
    \ where these data were fed into the ThingSpeak IoT cloud platform for\ndata visualization.\
    \ The real-time data were stored on Firebase Database and then used for\ncrop\
    \ prediction using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classiﬁer.\nResearchers in [29]\
    \ presented an intelligent antifrost irrigation management system\nthat contains\
    \ a climatological station and ecological anti-disaster frost irrigation. The\n\
    solar-powered system interacts with the environmental system through a website,\
    \ allowing\nthe real-time interconnection, acquisition, and monitoring of information\
    \ through mobile\nphone systems (GSM/GPRS) and internet (TCP/IP) services. Additionally,\
    \ the proposed\nsystem uses an intelligent Fuzzy Expert System (FES) to predict\
    \ the greenhouse temperature\nand control activation of a water pump, considering\
    \ humidity, the temperature of inside\nand outside air, solar radiation, and wind\
    \ speed. The intelligent model gives a prediction\nby determining coefﬁcients\
    \ with the analysis of variance method.\nNestor et al. in [30] developed an application\
    \ for water irrigation called “Agrinex.”\nThis system is an alternative approach\
    \ in collecting and measuring physical parameters\nfrom the environment, particularly\
    \ in smart irrigation systems. Agrinex is connected to\nseveral in-ﬁeld sensors\
    \ such as a water level sensor, paddy temperature sensor, and a\nﬁeld weather\
    \ station. This work aimed to make this information accessible anywhere\nwherever\
    \ there is internet access using a mobile application, which makes Agrinex scalable\n\
    and adaptable to changes. The mesh-based network recorded a maximum transmission\n\
    distance of 11 m from sink to sensor node with a 90% success rate. Data from the\
    \ ﬁeld can\nbe accessed remotely close to real-time when short network delays\
    \ are accounted for. It\nalso gives the additional beneﬁt of equipping lands with\
    \ an automated irrigation system\nthat conserves up to 81% of water consumption.\n\
    Authors in [31] proposed a system that decides whether or not water is needed\n\
    for farms by predicting the rainfall using the Genetic Algorithm (GA) approach.\
    \ In the\nproposed system, voluminous weather and soil moisture data are stored\
    \ inside the cloud\nservers. Based on data collected by a UAV and then fed to\
    \ the GA, water spraying is\nperformed, which can be monitored using a mobile\
    \ application. Cloud servers are used for\nstoring and processing large volumes\
    \ of weather and soil moisture data. Results show that\nthe sensor-based system\
    \ is activated to check whether the GA-based system completes its\nprediction\
    \ correctly or not by sensing moisture levels from the soil. If the moisture level\n\
    of the soil crosses the predeﬁned threshold value, then plant watering is performed\
    \ by\nquadrotor UAV.\nResearchers in [32] developed a framework for monitoring\
    \ pests and diseases of crops\nbased on IoT and UAV that attempts to solve the\
    \ correlation between the occurrence of\npests/diseases and weather parameters.\
    \ The proposed framework is deployed in the\nYangtze River Zone of China, where\
    \ it uses rotary devices based on sun perception to\nobtain solar energy. Results\
    \ infer that low-altitude remote sensing and monitoring through\naerial imaging\
    \ of pests and diseases using UAV is reasonable, while more analyses of\nclimate\
    \ changes would provide some precautions in advance.\nA Narrow Band IoT (NB-IoT)\
    \ system is proposed in [33] to collect underground soil\nparameters in potato\
    \ crops using a UAV network. Around 2500 sensors deployed under\nand above ground\
    \ are connected to UAV using Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network\n(LPWPAN).\
    \ Simulation results show that due to UAV altitude and path loss, the link quality\n\
    between the ground sensor and UAV is reduced. Another observation is that the\
    \ lifetime\nof sensor batteries was varied depending on the location of the sensor\
    \ under or above\nground. Using LoRa technology and proper path loss model are\
    \ recommended as future\nwork to enhance link accuracy and performance. Regarding\
    \ path loss, authors in [22–25]\nSustainability 2021, 13, 5908\n5 of 26\ndiscussed\
    \ different types of propagation path loss from an aerial platform perspective,\n\
    where Free-Space and Air-to-Ground are typical deterministic propagation models,\
    \ while\nHata and Okumura are typical empirical ones. Results show that an appropriate\
    \ model can\nbe selected based on coverage range, adaption across different terrains,\
    \ and better Quality\nof Service (QoS).\nAuthors in [34] suggested a heterogeneous\
    \ IoT sensor node system to sense acoustic,\nrain, wind, light, temperature, and\
    \ pH levels of the cornﬁelds for smart agriculture applica-\ntions. The system\
    \ aimed to achieve productive corn harvest in large-scale ﬁelds using a\ndrone\
    \ that gathers data and sends it to a gateway. The simulation results that monitored\n\
    at the gateway using the IoT application called Grafana show that it offers maximum\n\
    efﬁciency from the soil and follows the crop development according to the weather\
    \ and soil\nconditions, in addition to reducing the workload and the risk of disease\
    \ and pest, as well\nas optimizing irrigation and obtaining better quality products\
    \ at low cost. As future work,\ncollecting a wider range of climatic data and\
    \ geographical conditions would be useful in\ndesigning a model of smart farming.\n\

    \ which, in turn, helps in building sus-\ntainable smart agriculture and enhancing\

    Thus, the paper aims to implement a system that periodically collects data using\n\
    both under- and aboveground sensors on farms and sends them to the gateway; then,\n\
    using a drone with a LoRa module onboard, the obtained data are transmitted to\

    \ 2021, 13, 5908\n12 of 26\nwhat exists in models presented in the literature,\
    \ as presented in related works of the\nprevious section.\nHata’s equations are\
    \ classiﬁed into urban, suburban, or rural areas; yet, here, it was\nconsidered\
    \ only in rural areas since it involved farm zones [37,38]. The distance d of\
    \ the\nHata propagation model is computed based on elevation angle (θ), which\
    \ is a notable shift\nfrom existing propagation models. The θ is a vital element\
    \ in calculating path loss from\nspace such as in drone scenarios. Path loss in\

    \ such as geographic location, soil property, and climate can be referred to the\n\
    map of world climates.\nThe proposed system can be explained in ﬁve steps, as\

    \ refers to rain gauge sensor, S-LIB-\nM003 refers to solar radiation sensor,\
    \ and S-SMC-M005 refers to soil moisture smart sensor.\nFirst, both under- and\
    \ aboveground sensors collected relevant data from the farm every 1 h.\nSecond,\
    \ these data were stored temporarily on an embedded Secure Digital (SD) card in\n\
    the wireless server gateway. Third, the drone ﬂew and collected data from various\
    \ wireless\nserver gateways located in the farm every 12 h. Fourth, the drone\
    \ sent the data to the cloud.\nFifth, automated and human-made sets of actions\
    \ could be taken to apply smart actions\nfor precision agriculture, which, in\
    \ turn, dramatically boost crop productivity, and help\nin saving natural resources.\
    \ These actions could be obtained from the cloud into the user\ninterface smart\

    \ is linked to PL, results show RSS varying between\n−40 dBm to −70 dBm, which\
    \ has again a positive correlation with distance (drone altitude).\nUnsurprisingly,\
    \ increasing transmission power would enhance RSS, since RSS depends\non transmitter\
    \ power, antenna gains, and environmental factors. Having the results of\nthe\

    network planning, and coverage to achieve perfect reception. In our scenario,\
    \ this means\ncommunication between drone and ground station as well as wireless\

    \ farming involves the integration of advanced technologies into existing farm-\n\
    ing practices to increase production efﬁciency and quality of agricultural products.\
    \ The\nevolution of IoT and UAVs has enabled the vision of sustainable smart farming,\
    \ where\nthese smart technologies have proven to increase the quality of crop\
    \ yield and reduce the\nenvironmental footprint from the agricultural sector.\
    \ This paper shows a low-cost platform\nfor comprehensive environmental parameter\
    \ monitoring using ﬂying IoT. The proposal is\nbased on experimental work to fulﬁll\
    \ the requirements of automated and real-time monitor-\ning of the environmental\
    \ parameters using both under- and aboveground sensors. These\nIoT sensors devices\
    \ on a farm collect vast amounts of environmental data, where it is sent\nto ground\
    \ gateways every 1 h, after which the obtained data are collected and transmitted\n\
    by a drone to the cloud for storage and analysis every 12 h. This platform is\
    \ deployed\nand tested in a real scenario on a farm in Medenine, Tunisia, in the\
    \ period of March 2020\nto March 2021, covering open-ﬁeld and greenhouse cultivation.\
    \ This low-cost platform\ncan help farmers, governmental, or manufacturers to\
    \ predict environmental conditions\ndata over the geographically large farm ﬁeld,\
    \ which leads to enhancement of crop produc-\nSustainability 2021, 13, 5908\n\

    \ practical\nresults indicate that automated and human-made sets of actions have\
    \ been applied and/or\nsuggested that are smart actions for precision agriculture,\
    \ which, in turn, dramatically\nboost crop productivity and help in saving natural\
    \ resources. Examples of these actions are\nthe following:\n•\nFarmers are advised\
    \ to consider various strategies such as spraying chemicals on\nplants during\
    \ some seasons;\n•\nVarious plantings and quarterly grains are suggested;\n•\n\
    Estimate the amount of water needed to bring the soil to ﬁeld capacity;\n•\nFarmers\
    \ are advised to consider greenhouses to protect plants from high light intensity\n\
    during summer;\n•\nAdjust water irrigation using automated dripping and sprinkling\
    \ based on environ-\nmental parameters;\n•\nUsing solar panels for powering the\
    \ weather station leads to energy efﬁciency.\nFrom a practical point of view,\
    \ the deployed nodes, which are fed by a solar panel-\nrecharged battery, have\
    \ correctly transmitted data for 12 months, with underground and\naboveground\
    \ sensors and despite bad weather conditions. Indeed, even though some\nsamples\
    \ were lost during several rainy days, once their batteries were recharged by\
    \ solar\nlight during the following sunny days, nodes restarted to transmit properly.\n\
    PL and RSS of the Hata propagation model of the distance between the ground station\n\
    and the drone at the cloud layer show reasonable results, in which the obtained\
    \ values\nsatisfy a high level of reception with the smallest attenuated signal,\
    \ besides achieving line\nof sight wireless connectivity in an efﬁcient and timely\
    \ manner. More elaboration can be\ntaken into consideration for future work, e.g.,\
    \ to develop a machine learning algorithm\nto predict environmental conditions\
    \ and then suggest solutions and/or precautions. A\ndecision support system framework\
    \ could be introduced as part of a future project to link\nthe farm’s smart devices\
    \ together to achieve an autonomous system. Moreover, the power\nconsumption of\
    \ the drone can be optimized to enhance ﬂight time, which leads to covering\n\
    wider farm zones.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, methodology, software,\

    \ Greenhouse cultivation has evolved from simple covered rows of open-fields crops\
    \ to highly sophisticated controlled \nenvironment agriculture (CEA) facilities\
    \ that projected the image of plant factories for urban agriculture.  The advances\
    \ and \nimprovements in CEA have promoted the scientific solutions for the efficient\
    \ production of plants in populated cities and \nmulti-story buildings.  Successful\
    \ deployment of CEA for urban agriculture requires many components and subsystems,\
    \ as \nwell as the understanding of the external influencing factors that should\
    \ be systematically considered and integrated.  This \nreview is an attempt to\
    \ highlight some of the most recent advances in greenhouse technology and CEA\
    \ in order to raise the \nawareness for technology transfer and adaptation, which\
    \ is necessary for a successful transition to urban agriculture.  This \nstudy\
    \ reviewed several aspects of a high-tech CEA system including improvements in\
    \ the frame and covering materials, \nenvironment perception and data sharing,\
    \ and advanced microclimate control and energy optimization models.  This research\
    \ \nhighlighted urban agriculture and its derivatives, including vertical farming,\
    \ rooftop greenhouses and plant factories which are \nthe extensions of CEA and\
    \ have emerged as a response to the growing population, environmental degradation,\
    \ and urbanization \nthat are threatening food security.  Finally, several opportunities\
    \ and challenges have been identified in implementing the \nintegrated CEA and\
    \ vertical farming for urban agriculture. \nKeywords: smart agriculture, greenhouse\

    \ \ntransition driven by the advances in precision technology, data \nprocessing\
    \ and smart farming.  Protected cultivations have \nchanged from simple covered\
    \ greenhouse structures to high-tech \nplant factories that optimize the productivity\
    \ of the plants and \nhuman labour.  A modern greenhouse operates as a system,\
    \ \ntherefore, it is also referred to as controlled environment agriculture \n\
    (CEA), controlled environment plant production system (CEPPS), \nor Phytomation\
    \ systems[1].  These structures use natural or \nartificial light within which\
    \ optimum growth conditions is intended \nto achieve for producing horticultural\
    \ crops, or for plant research \nprograms.  They also offer greater predictability,\
    \ reduce the cost \nof production and increase crop yields.  A comprehensive history\
    \ \nof greenhouses in the past three decades can be found in the works \nof [2-6].\
    \  Examples of earlier works in automation and computer \ncontrol of greenhouse\
    \ environment are showed in [7-9].  Previous \nstudies on greenhouse engineering\
    \ during the 1990s have been \nreviewed by Hanan[10] and Critten and Bailey[11].\
    \ \nThe United Nations has predicted that by 2050, more than \ntwo-thirds of the\
    \ nine billion world population will live in the cities.  \nSecuring the supply\
    \ chain of fresh fruits and vegetables in this new \nscenario will be an overwhelming\
    \ challenge.  If properly designed, \n2   January, 2018                      \

    \ and plant \nfactories can significantly contribute to this context for the \n\
    year-round production of fresh vegetables in urban areas.  For \nsuch a system\
    \ to operate successfully and achieve its production \nobjectives, attention needs\
    \ to be paid to the technical aspects of \nautomation (A), culture (C), environment\
    \ (E) and system (SYS).  \nTing et al.[1] defined ACESYS terms as follow: Automation\
    \ is the \nprocessing of information and execution of tasks for operation of \n\
    CEA through computerized instrumentations and various control \nalgorithms that\
    \ might include decision support programs and \nartificial intelligence.  The\
    \ cultural and environmental factors \ncomprise \ncultivation \ntechniques, \n\
    plants \ncharacteristics, \nmicroclimate requirements and growth responses.  It\
    \ also contains \nmorphological and physiological conditions such as “multiplication,\
    \ \nrooting, transplanting, pruning, water and nutrient delivery, \npesticide\
    \ application, harvesting, post-harvest processing, etc”.  \nTing et al.[1] stated\
    \ that “Systems analysis and integration is a \nmethodology that starts with the\
    \ definition of a system and its goals, \nand leads to the conclusion regarding\
    \ the system’s workability, \nproductivity, reliability, and other performance\
    \ indicators.” \nResearch trends in this field are toward innovative methods for\
    \ \nshifting from conventional greenhouses to smart controlled \nenvironments\
    \ that benefit from natural resources for eliminating \ndeleterious external conditions.\
    \  The ultimate objective in this \nregard would be achieving high yield and high-quality\
    \ fruits at \nminimum possible cost. \nInnovations in the low-cost and low-power\
    \ consumption \nsensors and instrumentations, communication devices, data \nprocessing\
    \ and mobile applications, along with the technological \nadvances in the design\
    \ structures, simulation models, and \nhorticultural engineering have provided\
    \ the state-of-the-art \nfacilities that are shifting the traditional CEA to plant\
    \ factories for \nurban farming.  This paper begins with a summary of several\
    \ \nreviewed literature in Section 2 on the advances in greenhouse \ncovering\
    \ materials, artificial light, and the efficiency of the \nmicroclimate controller\
    \ for a viable CEA system.  This part aimed \nto investigate the effects of the\
    \ existing and new covering materials \non the resulting microclimate (including\
    \ influencing factors and \ntheir interactions with cultural practices), plants\
    \ growth, and yield.  \nModeling of CEA, as well as object-oriented automation-culture-\
    \ \nenvironment system analysis that is presented in the works of Ting \net al.[1]\
    \ provide a systematic approach for a better understanding of \nthese influencing\
    \ factors.  These findings and their implications in \na modern CAE such as plant\
    \ factories and agri-cubes are further \ndiscussed in Section 5.  After that,\
    \ environmental monitoring and \nperception by means of wireless sensor networks\
    \ (WSN) and \ninternet of things-based (IoT-based) platforms have been \ndemonstrated\
    \ and reviewed as an essential part of an automation \nsystem.  In our opinion,\
    \ the three biggest challenges for the \ndevelopment of an efficient and viable\
    \ CEA system are the creation \nof automation levels for energy management, reduction\
    \ of \nenvironmental impact, and maximizing use of natural resources.  \nA comprehensive\
    \ review of the advances in environmental control \nmethods, energy optimization\
    \ models, prediction tools, and \ndecision support systems are provided in Section\
    \ 4.  Specifically, \nthe applications of different high-level algorithms for\
    \ the most \nefficient microclimate control solutions are highlighted in Section\
    \ \n4.1.  These control methods and automation phases have been \nreviewed to\
    \ illustrate how each part can facilitate achieving the \noverall objectives of\
    \ a CEA.  A summary of some of the research \nworks in the past decade on energy\
    \ analysis, artificial intelligence, \nand simulation models with applications\
    \ in different aspects of \ngreenhouse production are presented in Sections 4.2\
    \ and 4.3.  A \nsubstantial amount of research has been done on individual aspects\
    \ \nof automation, culture, and environment, as well as their \ncombination, however\
    \ improvements of CEA also require decision \nsupport systems (DSS) and assessment\
    \ tools for long-term risk \nmanagement by accurately determining the interactions\
    \ between \nclimate parameters and growth responses prior to the actual \ncultivation[12].\
    \  To identify technological pathways for energy \nefficient CEA, a survey was\
    \ performed in Section 4.4 to highlight \nsome of the improved solutions based\
    \ on decision support systems \nfor energy management strategies in the commercial\
    \ greenhouses.  \nIn Section 5, the research covered urban agriculture and the\
    \ \ndevelopment of plant factories and vertical farming which is \ngrowing rapidly\
    \ in the East and Southeast Asia, most noticeably in \nJapan, South Korea, Taiwan\
    \ Province of China, and Malaysia, and \nreviewed several conceptual designs such\
    \ as the rooftop \ngreenhouses to highlight how various research and educational\
    \ \ninstitutes, real estate developers, and construction companies are \ninvolved\
    \ in the emerged opportunities.   \n2  Considerations for viability \nSeveral\
    \ factors to be considered in designing of a viable \ngreenhouse system for producing\
    \ year-round crops and \nvegetables are the structure frame, landscape, topography,\
    \ soil, \nclimate conditions, microclimate control system, light condition, \n\
    intercepted solar radiation, windbreaks, the availability of \nelectricity, roadways,\
    \ and labor force.  Other conditions that \nshould also be taken into account\
    \ for an efficient large-scale \ncommercial greenhouse production[13,14] are the\
    \ environment, \neconomic and social factors.  For example, a modern greenhouse\
    \ \nstructure might be constructed within a commercial building or \nnear commercial\
    \ or residential lands.  Some of the most popular \ngreenhouse structures and\
    \ CEA are presented in Figure 1. There \nare numerous experimental and analytical\
    \ research works that \naddress how environmental parameters inside a greenhouse\
    \ is \naffected by the structural design and shape, volume size, \ndimensions,\
    \ plants density, covering films, structure material, \nwind speed, geographical\
    \ orientation, and most importantly the \nmicroclimate control system.  For example,\
    \ in regions where \nsolar radiation or ambient air temperatures are high, several\
    \ \ndesign factors for optimum air exchange such as the ratio of the \narea of\
    \ the vent openings to the ground area covered by the \ngreenhouse, the ratio\
    \ of the greenhouse volume to the floor area, \nand the vertical distance between\
    \ the air inlets and air outlets can \nsignificantly improve the ventilation performance.\
    \  Optimization \nof vent configuration by evaluating greenhouse and plant canopy\
    \ \nventilation rates under wind-induced ventilation has been studied \nby Kacira\
    \ et al.[15].  This section provides a summary of the \nresearch works that have\
    \ addressed improvements in covering \nmaterials, and microclimate control systems.\
    \  To avoid \noverlapping of the contexts and maintain a consistent flow of the\
    \ \ntopics, we have covered the advances in structure design (i.e., \nrooftop\
    \ greenhouses) as a separate subsection under urban \nagriculture. \nJanuary,\

    \ \n \n2.1  Covering materials \nConsiderations for greenhouses covering materials\
    \ involve \nsupporting foundation, shape and framing materials, geographical \n\
    direction for optimal light entrance, the load of equipment, factors \nfor static\
    \ and dynamic loads (i.e., hanging plants, structure weight, \nand wind speed),\
    \ dimension ratio, and volume.  Greenhouses \nstructures and covering can take\
    \ different forms which can be used \nto surround the whole or a section of the\
    \ cultivation area and space.  \nThe most dominant transparent materials in use\
    \ are 2-3 mm glass \npanels, net-screen film, and  0.1 mm and 0.2 mm Polyethylene\
    \ \n(PE) plastic films, and ultraviolet (UV) stabilized PE-films.  \nBaudoin et\
    \ al.[16] recommended that in order to obtain a reasonable \nheat rise of less\
    \ than 4°C in a glass-clad greenhouse, the airflow \nrate should be 0.04-0.05\
    \ m3/s of floor area (1 m2).  Selection of \ncovering material for a greenhouse\
    \ depends on its application, the \ntype of crop to be cultivated, and the climate\
    \ condition of the \nregion.  It can vary from simple covers such as one layer\
    \ plastic[17,18], \ndouble-wall plastic[19,20], and glass[21,22], to fiberglass[23,24],\
    \ \ndouble-wall plastic, acrylic sheet[25], polyethylene film[26-29], \npolyvinyl\
    \ \nchloride \n(PVC)[30], \ncopolymers[31], \nPolycarbonate \npanels[32], and\
    \ selective transmission medium[33,34] for different \nspectral frequencies. \
    \ Some of these materials are designed to trap \nenergy inside the greenhouse\
    \ and heats both plants zone and its \nsurroundings.  Detailed properties of these\
    \ covering, as well as the \nquality assessments of their mechanical properties,\
    \ have been \naddressed in detail by a study on the effects of cover diffusive\
    \ \nproperties on the components of greenhouse solar radiation[34]. \nCondensation,\
    \ radiation transmittance and diffusing properties \nof different types of transmitting\
    \ covering materials in greenhouses \nhave been discussed by Pollet et al.[35].\
    \  Glazing materials allow \nshorter-wavelength radiation (i.e. visible light)\
    \ to pass through, but \nlong wavelength radiation such as infrared (heat) is\
    \ trapped inside \nthe greenhouse.  A comparison between different greenhouse\
    \ \ncovering materials, including polyethylene film, photo-selective red \ncolor\
    \ film, and insect-proof net for tomato cultivation during \nsummer is available\
    \ in the works of Arcidiacono et al.[36] and \nHemming et al.[37] Jarquín-Enríquez\
    \ et al.[38] studied the effects of \ndouble layer plastic and flat glass cover\
    \ on the lycopene \naccumulation and color index during tomato fruit ripening.\
    \  They \nconcluded that lycopene biosynthesis in tomato fruits was increased\
    \ \nby the amount of light after the beginning of ripening growth stage.  \nStudying\
    \ the effect of greenhouse covering materials on the inside \nair temperature\
    \ under tropical climate condition showed that while \noutside temperature was\
    \ between 28°C-33°C, the temperature \ninside \na \npolyethylene \nfilm \ncovered\
    \ \ngreenhouse \nwithout \nenvironment control reached 68°C-70°C, leading to air\
    \ vapor \npressure deficit (VPD) of 4 kPa[39].  Al-Mahdouri et al.[40] \nevaluated\
    \ optical properties and thermal performances of different \ngreenhouse covering\
    \ materials.  The combinations of external \nclimate conditions and type of greenhouse\
    \ for the most appropriate \napplication have been studied by Kempkes et al.[41]\
    \ A computer \napplication to measure geometric characterization and dimensions\
    \ \nof insect-proof screens was designed by Álvarez et al.[42].  \nPolythene-clad\
    \ greenhouses do not become as hot because of the \ntransparency of the plastic\
    \ to long-wave radiation that is \ntransmitted back out of the greenhouse.  Therefore,\
    \ for a \npolythene-film covered greenhouse, the ventilation rate can be \nreduced\
    \ to 0.03-0.04 m3/s of floor area (1 m2)[43].  With \ngreenhouse shading, the\
    \ amount of solar radiation and light \nintensity reaching the plants is restricted,\
    \ creating a closed \ndifference between air temperature inside and outside the\
    \ \ngreenhouse.  Shading also decreases leaf surface temperature \nsignificantly.\
    \  According to Glenn et al.[44], while a 20% to 80% \nlight reduction can be\
    \ expected depending on the shading materials, \nthe sufficient light reduction\
    \ for most greenhouse applications is \nbetween 30% and 50%.  Hassanien and Li[45]\
    \ investigated the \nmicroclimate parameters and growth responses of lettuce plants\
    \ \ninside a greenhouse that was shaded with semi-transparent \nmono-crystalline\
    \ silicon double glazing photovoltaic panels \n(STPV).  The STPV panels of their\
    \ study accounted for 20% of \nthe greenhouse roof area, and showed that the combination\
    \ of \nSTPV and polyethylene cover decreased the solar radiation by 35% \nto 40%\
    \ compared to the use of polyethylene cover.  They also \nshowed that the STPV\
    \ shading decreased the air temperature by \n4   January, 2018               \

    \ effect on the relative \nhumidity, fresh weight, leaf area and the chlorophyll\
    \ contents under \nnatural ventilation. \nProtected cultivation of Solanaceous\
    \ crops such as tomatoes \nand peppers by means of Screen-houses operating on\
    \ natural \nventilation is now a commonly practiced in tropical lowlands for \n\
    reducing insect migration, the risk of damage by high rainfall, \nextreme solar\
    \ radiation, and high wind speeds.  In addition, by \nusing insect-proof net covered\
    \ greenhouse, the inside and outside \ntemperature may remain similar, while temperature\
    \ has been \nobserved to be rising with the photo-selective film during summer.\
    \  \nStudies showed that net-screen greenhouses have gained more \npopularity\
    \ in tropical regions due to the potential of climate \nparameters that have optimality\
    \ degrees close to the plants desired \nlevels.  Shamshiri[46] observed that under\
    \ an insect-proof \nnet-screen covered greenhouse operating on natural ventilation,\
    \ the \ninside and outside air temperature remained close to each other, \nwhile\
    \ the air temperature was found to increase inside two \nphoto-selective film\
    \ covered greenhouses (polycarbonate panel and \na polyethylene covered) operating\
    \ on evaporative cooling[39].  \nShading nets ease the natural ventilation process\
    \ and can protect \nplants from excessive sunlight, wind, and heavy rains.  Lorenzo\
    \ et \nal.[47] reported that movable shade under intense sunlight in Spain \n\
    caused 10% increase in the marketable yield of greenhouse tomato.  \nOther reports\
    \ indicated that external and internal shading nets \nreduced horizontal and vertical\
    \ gradients in air temperature \ncompared with those without shading nets[48].\
    \  Results of a study \non the effect of roof height of a large screen-house on\
    \ the \nventilation rate using one-dimensional computational model and \npreliminary\
    \ measurements showed that increasing roof height by 2 \nm increases both temperature\
    \ and humidity levels in the canopy \nlayer[49].  Microclimate, air velocity,\
    \ ventilation efficiency, and \nlight transmittance are mainly influenced by the\
    \ properties of the \nnet-screen mesh and the greenhouse shape.  While these structures\
    \ \nenhance natural ventilation in hot and humid climate conditions, \nthey still\
    \ require strong shelters for protecting plants from extreme \nsolar radiation,\
    \ rain, and strong winds.  The screen-house itself is \nan important pest protection\
    \ device, provided it is equipped with \nfine mesh screens in all openings, and\
    \ a double-door system. \n2.2  Light control and artificial lights \nThe main\
    \ approaches for controlling light level and the \nintercepted radiance in CEA\
    \ are through planted density, shading \nscreens, and artificial lights.  Light\
    \ condition and air temperature \nare the two most important environmental factors\
    \ for plants growth.  \nIn fact, discussions about optimal air temperature without\
    \ including \nlight condition and plant evapotranspiration does not generate any\
    \ \nuseful data for maximizing yield and producing high-quality \nvegetable. \
    \ Light and air temperature are intrinsically related and \nit is a well-known\
    \ fact that one cannot be optimized without \nconsidering the other.  For example,\
    \ tomato quality, including \nyield, productivity and lycopene value is not only\
    \ affected by the \nmicroclimate parameters and cultural experience, but with\
    \ the \nPhotosynthetic Photon Flux Density (PPFD).  In fact, it is the \noptimal\
    \ combination of air temperature, relative humidity, and light \nthat will result\
    \ in maximum yield (assuming that other factors such \nas CO2, soil pH, and nutrient\
    \ are not limiting).  A schematic \ndiagram is presented in Figure 2 to illustrate\
    \ the effects of light \nspectral, intensity and photoperiod on plant growth,\
    \ along with a \ncomparison between spectral power distribution of natural and\
    \ \nartificial light sources, and the plant’s response to irradiance level. \n\

    \ from http://w3.marietta.edu/) \nFigure 2  Comparison between spectral power\
    \ distribution of natural and artificial light sources and light response curve\
    \ of plants  \n \nThe most common artificial light sources that are used in \n\
    modern greenhouses and CEAs are incandescent/halogen lamps, \ndischarge lamps\
    \ (such as fluorescent light tubes, Metal Halide, \nand high-pressure sodium lamps),\
    \ and the Light-emitting diodes \n(LEDs).  Among these, LEDs have gained significant\
    \ popularity \nin the research and development communities due to their \nadvantages\
    \ such as cost efficiency, compact design, durability, \nlight quality, and low\
    \ thermal energy generation.  Research on \nLEDs as a substitute for plant growth\
    \ began in 1980s; however it \nwas only after mid-2000s that they became economically\
    \ feasible \nfor large scale commercial production.  These devices reduce \nthe\
    \ costs of electricity by using plant from effectual \nJanuary, 2018         \

    \ agriculture                Vol. 11 No.1   5 \ntransformation of electric power\
    \ to directed light wavelengths.  \nMoreover, the compact design of LEDs that\
    \ located close to the \nplants, allows the structure of various layers of plant\
    \ production \nto stack vertically in CEA, while decreasing the costs of cooling\
    \ \ncompared with other artificial light sources.  Nowadays the \nfunctional costs\
    \ of LEDs are a high-priority study and advance \nsubject for upcoming greenhouse-based\
    \ plant factories.  In the \ncase of tomatoes, shading affects biosynthesis and\
    \ carotene level \nof lycopene.  According to the study of Cockshull et al.[50],\
    \ plant \nfactory yield will be reduced by 20% by utilizing a cover with \n23%\
    \ shade.  Yields also will be enriched with color shaded in \nplant factories\
    \ in hot weathers.  Yet, color shades can be \ndisadvantageous in areas with limited\
    \ sunlight hours in cloudy \nand cold climates.  In fact, choosing suitable planting\
    \ density \ncan increase crop water output and improve light capture.  On \nthe\
    \ other hand, the planting density has an effect on the harvest of \ntomato in\
    \ greenhouse growing system and evapotranspiration \n(ET)[51].  According to the\
    \ reports of several studies, factors \nsuch as numbers of flowering, fruits location\
    \ in per plant and \nsingle fruit weight were all lesser with more density of\
    \ planting, \ntherefore, resulting in lesser harvests[52-54].  In another study,\
    \ Ilić \net al.[55] showed that in the tomato factory, by using red shade \nnetting\
    \ techniques the lycopene content highly increased, \nhowever, these fruits had\
    \ minor carotene content.  Maximum \nproduction of tomato by percentages of covering\
    \ are described \nunder 40% by El-Aidy and El-Afry[56] and 35% by El-Gizawy et\
    \ \nal.[57] Moreover, El-Gizawy et al.[57] claimed that by increasing \ncovering\
    \ intensity, the production of tomato will increase up to \n51%.  The soil surface\
    \ will lose its moisture in plants faster by \nabsorbing the more radiant energy,\
    \ but, the high density of \ntomato plants caused less radiation at the soil surface[52].\
    \ \n2.3  Efficiency of microclimate controller \nAn efficient greenhouse requires\
    \ environment control for air \nquality, disease reduction, pest control, and\
    \ nutrient and water \nuptake.  The inputs and outs of a greenhouse system are\
    \ shown \nschematically in Figure 3.  The quality of air is governed by \nfactors\
    \ such as air and root-zone temperature, humidity, carbon \ndioxide, air movement,\
    \ dust, odors and disease agents.  Other \nvariables in the greenhouse environment\
    \ that affect plant’s life are \nlight condition, soil feeding solution pH and\
    \ electrical conductivity.  \nThese parameters and the problems associated with\
    \ each have been \nextensively discussed by several textbooks, see for example\
    \ \nHochmuth and Hochmuth[58], Cherie[59] and Jones[60].  Plant \ngrowth responses\
    \ to other influencing factors and climate changes \nsuch as carbon dioxide and\
    \ wind speed have been discussed in the \ntextbook of Morison and Morecroft[61].\
    \  In general, microclimate \nparameters in a CEA are manipulated by passive and\
    \ active \nventilation, \nevaporative \ncooling \ntechniques, \nshadings, \nand\
    \ \nrefrigeration dehumidification.  Several methods based on the \nFans Assessment\
    \ Numeration System (FANS) for evaluation of the \nventilation performance and\
    \ suggestions for the energy efficiency \nof greenhouse fans are presented in\
    \ [62].  It should be noted that \nthe high operating costs of air-conditioners\
    \ make them impractical \nfor commercial application. \n \nFigure 3  Inputs and\
    \ outputs of controlled environment agriculture \n \nThe efficiency of active\
    \ systems, i.e., fan and pad evaporative \ncooling, has been widely studied and\
    \ modeled for modular \ngreenhouses that use mechanical ventilation[63,64], but\
    \ research \nworks on their use alongside natural ventilation in greenhouses in\
    \ \nsemiarid climates are narrow[65].  Reports showed that when \nventilation\
    \ fan belts were adjusted to the proper tension, the fan \nspeed and airflow rate\
    \ were respectively 13.1% and 30.1% higher \nthan those of original belts[62].\
    \  The same study also reports that \nthe daily average energy consumption for\
    \ the ventilation fan with \nthe original loose belts was 20.4% higher than that\
    \ with the \nadjusted belts when the pad was not working, and 24.2% higher \n\
    with pad working.  There are theoretical and experimental studies \nwhich compare\
    \ the effects of fogging and fixed shading systems on \nthe Mediterranean greenhouse\
    \ climate[66]; however, the assessment \nof mobile shading is not well documented.\
    \  In order to determine \nthe size of fans and pads for evaporative cooling,\
    \ the volume of the \ngreenhouse needs to be calculated.  An air exchange (m3/min)\
    \ of 1 \nto 1.5 times of the greenhouse volume is recommended every \nminute[16].\
    \  The number of fans should be selected based on the air \nexchange and by taking\
    \ into account that their placement should \nnot be spaced more than 7.6 m apart.\
    \  According to Duan et al.[67], \na properly operated typical swamp cooler has\
    \ the potential to cool \nair within 3°C to 4°C of the wet-bulb temperature. \
    \ These units \ncost less than air-conditioner and consume 60% to 80% less \n\
    electricity; however, they are only practical for small greenhouses \nin hot dry\
    \ regions.  Another form of evaporative cooling is \nmisting which reduces plant\
    \ moisture loss and leaf transpiration by \nreducing its temperature due to evaporative\
    \ cooling.  Misting is \n6   January, 2018                         Int J Agric\

    \  Vol. 11 No.1 \ncategorized into low-pressure and high-pressure (also known\
    \ as \nfog-cooling).  In fog-cooling systems, high-pressure water is \npassed\
    \ through nozzles with orifice sizes usually less than 10 μm.  \nA fan then blows\
    \ the extremely small droplets of water into \ngreenhouse air and reduces temperature\
    \ through an evaporative \nprocess.  These systems are usually used in greenhouse\
    \ cooling \nfor seed germination and propagation.  A major drawback of this \n\
    method is that it creates high humidity climate inside canopies \nwhich facilitates\
    \ the development of bacterial diseases, such as \nalgae and botrytis.  Several\
    \ recommendations for obtaining \nbetter cooling results with misting are available\
    \ in the work of \nSchnelle and Dole[68].  Low and high-pressure fogging systems\
    \ \nin a naturally ventilated greenhouse have been studied and \ncompared by Li\
    \ and Willits[69], suggesting that compared to the \nlow-pressure fogging system,\
    \ the average evaporation efficiency \nfor the high-pressure system was at least\
    \ 64% greater.  \nMoreover, the cooling efficiency of the high-pressure system\
    \ was \nat least 28% greater than for the low-pressure system.  \nDetermination\
    \ of cooling efficiencies for misting and fogging \nsystems is available in the\
    \ work of Abdel-Ghany and Kozai[70].  \nThe efficiency of an evaporative cooling\
    \ system is calculated by \nout\ncool\nout\nwb\nT\nT\nη\nT\nT\n\n\n\n as given\
    \ in the ASABE standards[71].  Here, Tout \nis the outdoor air temperature, °C;\
    \ Tcool is the temperature of air \nexiting the cooling pad, °C, and Twb is the\
    \ wet-bulb temperature \nof the outside air, °C. \nMeasurement and data analysis\
    \ for greenhouse evaporative \ncooling are discussed in the work of Kittas et\
    \ al.[72] A decrease in \nair temperature by 4°C to 5°C inside a greenhouse with\
    \ \npad-and-fan evaporative cooling is reported by Jain and Tiwari[73].  \nPerformance\
    \ of a two-stage pad cooling system in broiler houses \nwas analyzed by Petek\
    \ et al.[74] showing that the resulting air \ntemperature and relative humidity\
    \ were significantly lower than \nthose of the traditional system.  A thermal\
    \ model for prediction of \nmicroclimate factors inside a greenhouse with mechanical\
    \ \nventilation and the evaporative cooling system was introduced by \nWillits[75].\
    \  Their results suggested that in the presence of \nevaporative cooling, increasing\
    \ canopy size is more influential in \nreducing air temperature.  They also concluded\
    \ that without \nevaporative cooling pads, the ratio of energy used for transpiration\
    \ \nto incoming solar energy (known as the evapotranspiration \ncoefficient) is\
    \ predicted to range from 1-75 for an outdoor air \ntemperature of 36.8°C and\
    \ a humidity ratios of 3.3 g/kg, to 0.8°C \nfor an outdoor humidity ratio of 29.9\
    \ g/kg at the same air \ntemperature.  In another study, Max et al.[76] investigated\
    \ the \neffects of greenhouse cooling methods, including mechanical \nventilation\
    \ and evaporative cooling, on yield and quality of tomato \nin tropical climates.\
    \  It was found that the proportion of \nmarketable yield was significantly higher\
    \ in a net-screen covered \ngreenhouse with mechanical ventilation, and the quantity\
    \ of \nundersized and blossom-end rot affected fruits was reduced in \npolyethylene\
    \ film covered greenhouse with the evaporative cooling \nmethod.  The researchers\
    \ then concluded that in regions with high \nrelative humidity, evaporative cooling\
    \ without customized \nadjustments for dehumidification will not improve closed-field\
    \ \nproduction of tomato. \nPassive cooling methods, including natural ventilation\
    \ and \nshading, are widely practiced in greenhouses, especially those in \ntropical\
    \ regions, by means of non-adjustable, manually adjustable, \nor automatically\
    \ controlled.  Natural ventilation is caused by the \nstack effect, wind ventilation,\
    \ or both.  Ventilation for air \ntemperature control is efficient only when outside\
    \ air temperature \nof the greenhouse is less than inside.  Some of the factors\
    \ to be \ntaken into account for designing of a proper naturally ventilated \n\
    greenhouse are the location of the structure, insulation, ceiling \nslope and\
    \ ventilation openings.  Various references have \nconcluded that using natural\
    \ ventilation, it is more difficult to \nuniformly distribute fresh air in wider\
    \ greenhouse structures[77,78].  \nA comprehensive review of ventilation systems\
    \ is available in the \nworks of Ganguly and Ghosh[79].  The air inlet and outlet\
    \ size for \nnatural ventilation are determined based on stack effect theory as\
    \ \nexpressed by the Equation (1).   The steady-state heat balance for \ndetermination\
    \ of maximum ventilation rate requires heat gains to \nbe equal to heat losses\
    \ and is given by Equation (2).  This \nequation is used to determine: (i) the\
    \ required ventilation rate to \nmaintain a given inside temperature for a given\
    \ heater capacity; (ii) \nthe minimum outside temperature (balance temperature)\
    \ to \nmaintain the desired inside temperature without using supplemental \nheat\
    \ (qh=0) at a given ventilation rate; and (iii) the size of heater \nrequired\
    \ to maintain the desired inside temperature for a given \nventilation rate and\

    \   7 \nmost popular greenhouse monitoring frameworks, the wireless \nsensor networks\
    \ (WSN), and the IoT based systems, which have \nredirected greenhouse measurement\
    \ concentration to a new level \nfor improving efficiency and viability. \n3.1\
    \  Wireless sensor networks \nResearch and development in greenhouses in the early\
    \ 2000s \nbegan to adopt wireless communication technology for monitoring, \n\
    sending early warning messages, and remote control using \nsimplified rules. \
    \ One of the earliest reports of WSN application in \ngreenhouse environment monitoring\
    \ can be found in the work of \nSerôdio \net \nal.[92] \n \nThe \ncompact \nsize,\
    \ \nreliability, \nand \ncost-effectiveness of WSN modules, as well as flexibility\
    \ for \ndeveloping custom applications besides easy installation, have \nmade\
    \ this technology gain attention and popularity for monitoring \nand control in\
    \ open-field[93,94] and in closed-field environment \nagriculture. \n \nSource:\
    \ www.AdaptiveAgroTech.com. \nFigure 4  General components and instrumentations\
    \ in a typical greenhouse environmental monitoring \n \nAn interesting application\
    \ of WSN in greenhouse includes CO2 \nmanagement[95] and multipoint measurements\
    \ of microclimate for \nmonitoring spatial gradients and three-dimensional changes\
    \ in \nparameters during the cultivation process[96].  For example, Ji et \nal.[97]\
    \ developed a WSN for precision control of CO2 fertilizer with \nan improved method\
    \ for prediction of tomato photosynthetic rate.  \nA computerized horticulture\
    \ data management system that is \naddressed in [92] was developed by implementing\
    \ WSN, controller \narea \nnetwork \n(CAN), \nand \nseveral \ninternet \nand \n\
    email \ncommunication tools, and was able to support distributed data \nmonitoring\
    \ and control inside the greenhouse environment.  \nMorais et al.[93] reported\
    \ the architecture of a WSN platform called \nMPWiNodeZ, a mesh-type array of\
    \ acquisition devices that was \ndesigned based on ZigBee multi-powered wireless\
    \ acquisition \ndevice for the purpose of remote sensing applications in precision\
    \ \nhorticulture.  A remarkable advantage of this platform is the \npower management\
    \ capability that allows the system to \ncontinuously operate in large coverage\
    \ areas where connection \nstability and power sources are a concern.  A simple\
    \ deterministic \nWSN based on IEEE 802.15.4 and XMesh protocol for online \n\
    monitoring and control of air temperature and relative humidity \nwith several\
    \ sensors nodes that were placed inside the greenhouse \nin a uniform gridded\
    \ topology is presented in the work of Pahuja et \nal.[98]  The authors used a\
    \ network health analyzer and found that \nwhile the data reliability was 100%,\
    \ their network mean packet \nreliability was between 75%-100% due to the packet\
    \ losses.  This \nfailure can be related to the canopy coverage and sensors occluded\
    \ \nby the dense plantation which reduces the signal strength of the \nnodes.\
    \  This network was integrated into a multiple inputs and \nmultiple outputs fuzzy\
    \ logic based controller and an RS-485 \nactuator network to manipulate the greenhouse\
    \ vapor pressure \ndeficit.  Prima et al.[91] developed and evaluated a simple\
    \ and \nflexible remote environmental monitoring and control based on a \ncloud\
    \ platform.  They implemented a local-global management \nstrategy supporting\
    \ synchronization of online and offline system \nconfiguration, actuation, and\
    \ offline management to respond to the \nunstable network connection in the rural\
    \ area.  They tested the \nfunctionality of their system during a 10-day data\
    \ collection period \nfor automated monitoring of soil moisture content and fertigation\
    \ \ncontrol in tomato cultivation.  Their results showed that under \nunstable\
    \ network, the system only had 0.78% error, and provided \n99.2% in-range soil\
    \ moisture content measurement, which shows \nthe potential for long-term microclimate\
    \ monitoring application in \ngreenhouses.   \nAn important consideration in designing\
    \ of an efficient WSN \nfor the greenhouse is the number of nodes, their location,\
    \ distances \nbetween nodes, antenna and the operating frequency based on the\
    \ \ngreenhouse microclimate condition.  Studies showed that radio \nwave propagation\
    \ is strongly affected by the high greenhouse \nenvironment[99].  Several other\
    \ connectivity issues with WSN in \nthe greenhouse have been addressed in [100]\
    \ using connection \nmatrix to estimate the network connectivity in the disconnected\
    \ \nspots.  For this purpose, Chen et al.[100] established a remote \nmonitoring\
    \ \nsystem \nin \nan \nexperimental \ngreenhouse using \nZigBee-based WSN which\
    \ could monitor air temperature, humidity \nand light intensity as well as the\
    \ wireless link quality.  Their \nresults showed that by adding long-distance\
    \ backup routing nodes, \nnetwork connectivity can be guaranteed in the spots\

    \ low energy and RSSI value of less than 100 dBm.  Another \nZigBee WSN application\
    \ based on star and mesh network \narchitecture for monitoring air temperature,\
    \ relative humidity, and \nsoil moisture content inside the greenhouse is available\
    \ in the work \nof Zhou et al.[101] More recently, Azaza et al.[102] presented\
    \ a smart \ntype-2 fuzzy logic based control system to manage the greenhouse \n\
    microclimate with attention to the effectiveness, the energy use and \nthe production\
    \ costs.  They integrated an observer and smart \nautomation system into the control\
    \ process by using a wireless data \nmonitoring platform enabling a distance data\
    \ measurement.  Their \nmethod also provided a real-time data access and building\
    \ database \nthat can be used for future enhancement of the system accuracy and\
    \ \ndecisions making.  The efficiency of their proposed monitoring \nand control\
    \ system was validated through a comparative study by \nevaluating the energy\
    \ saving (22%), and the water use (33%). \n3.2  IoT-based monitoring \nThe traditional\
    \ data monitoring techniques in greenhouse \nfrequently suffer from lack of sharing\
    \ and availability, great \nlabor-intensity, low spatiotemporal resolution, a\
    \ lack of data \ncentralization, and organizational management in observing the\
    \ \nenvironmental aspects of a greenhouse.  The IoT offers an \nexcellent opportunity\
    \ not only in greenhouse environment \nmonitoring but as a method for non-destructive\
    \ quantification of \nphysiological factors of the cultivated plants to be shared\
    \ within a \nnetwork of other greenhouse producers.  The potential \ngreenhouse\
    \ applications of IoT cover a variety of scenarios.  \nGeneral components of a\

    \  General components of a greenhouse environmental monitoring based in wireless\
    \ sensor network and IoT concept \n \nThe main element in the IoT is the network,\
    \ which has made \npossible a breakthrough in data communication and sharing for\
    \ \ngreenhouse monitoring and control.  It contains several physical \nitems,\
    \ software, and sensors that are linked with wires or wirelessly \nthrough standard\
    \ communication protocols[103].  Both academic \nand industry sections have shown\
    \ interest in greenhouse \napplications of IoT[104].  In fact, IoT has been used\
    \ in many areas \nof researchers, such as: smart city[105], agriculture[106,107]\
    \ and \nhealthcare[108-110], and is changing the traditional farming \nobservation\
    \ approaches by quickly providing quantitative data with \neffective spatiotemporal\
    \ resolution.  For example, long-term past \ninformation collected by IoT applications\
    \ can be an offer to a local \ngreenhouse community to conduct combined pest and\
    \ disease \nmanagement agendas in order to stop spreading of the associated \n\
    damages.  These data can also improve cultural practices and \ndecision making\
    \ plans[107].  An application of this technology can \nbe found in the work of\
    \ Liao et al.[111] who developed an IoT \nmonitoring system to simultaneously\
    \ screen the growth condition \nof Phalaenopsis and the environmental features\
    \ of an orchid plant \nfactory.  For example, Peng et al.[112] showed that by\
    \ using a \nspectroscopic and spectrometer investigation can correctly provide\
    \ \nthe total of orchid chlorophyll.   \nMoreover, Lin and Hsu[113] applied a\
    \ chlorophyll fluorometer \nin their study.  The monitored the photosynthetic\
    \ status of \nPhalaenopsis under diverse lighting situations.  Although the \n\
    physiological analysis is often occupied manually, these \nexamination approaches\
    \ need tools with perfect accuracy to \nnondestructively \ndegree \nphysiological\
    \ \nfactors \nof \norchids.  \nFurthermore, because of the cost, farmers will\
    \ not use highly \nprecise tools to measure physiological factors of orchids.\
    \  With \nscalability and flexibility of IoT, growers can have an excellent \n\
    opportunity to meet such observing demands[109]. \n4  Environmental control and\
    \ energy optimization \nThis section reviews some of the recently published works\
    \ on \nthe advances in microclimate modeling and control, greenhouse \nenergy\
    \ analysis, predictions of yields and environmental \nparameters, optimization\
    \ models, and decision support systems \napplication for best cultivation practices.\
    \ \n4.1  Advances in microclimate control \nConventional microclimate control\
    \ algorithms are designed \nbased on a series of reference values known as set\
    \ points.  The \ncontroller then adjusts the outputs with implemented rules to\
    \ \nachieve stability by minimizing the error between references and \nthe inputs.\
    \  The control of the microclimate in a greenhouse is a \nhigh-level task because\
    \ of the number of involved variables that are \ncoupled and interrelated, making\
    \ a complex non-linear system.   \nSome of the earlier attempts to apply advanced\
    \ control \nJanuary, 2018           Shamshiri R R, et al.  Advances in greenhouse\
    \ automation and controlled environment agriculture                Vol. 11 No.1\
    \   9 \ntechniques for greenhouse environment can be found in the works \nof Caponetto\
    \ et al.[114], Pan et al.[115], Lin[116], Castañeda-Miranda et \nal.[117] and\
    \ Xu et al.[118] Recent advances in computer simulation \nand artificial intelligence\
    \ have worked their way into greenhouse \nenvironment modeling and predictions.\
    \  Identifications and \nmodellings of different parameters in greenhouses have\
    \ been topics \nof numerous research works that aimed at improving production\
    \ \nefficiency (i.e., higher yield and quality, maximum return) by \nevaluating\
    \ and adjusting microclimate parameters and modeling of \nmicrometeorology[119,120].\
    \  The level of approaches vary from \nsimple models and timer-based feedback\
    \ controls[121,122] to more \nadvanced solutions, such as model-free control strategy[123],\
    \ \nnonlinear control methods[124], adaptive control and adaptive \nmanagement\
    \ framework[120,125], robust[126], optimal control[127-132], \nenergy balance\
    \ models[133], and model-based predictive control[134].  \nAn important drawback\
    \ in utilizing advanced control methods in a \nCEA is the difficulty in developing\
    \ the dynamic model to simulate \nthe behavior of the variables.  Ultimately,\
    \ the goal of any of these \ncontrol systems is to minimize the input cost per\
    \ unit of production \nand to increase the return by achieving high yield and\
    \ quality. \nThe success of greenhouse systems analysis relies on the \neffective\
    \ use of information.  To meet these requirements, various \ncontrol strategies\
    \ based on complex algorithms of artificial \nintelligence have been discussed\
    \ in the literature.  For example, \nfuzzy systems have achieved significant results\
    \ in the area of \nprecision irrigation[135] and microclimate control.  Several\
    \ \ntechniques and approaches have been presented, including \ninverting \nfuzzy\
    \ \nmodel[136], \nreconfigurable \nadaptive \nfuzzy \nfault-hiding \ncontrol[137],\
    \ \nTakagiSugeno \nfuzzy \nmodeling[138], \nconventional fuzzy logic control for\
    \ smart greenhouses[102], and \ndecentralized decoupling fuzzy logic controller[139].\
    \  These \nsolutions have shown a more effective set-point tracking compared \n\
    with \nthe \nconventional \nPID \ncontrollers. \n \nFor \nexample, \nEl-Madbouly\
    \ et al.[137] designed an active fault-tolerant control \nsystem to fix of the\
    \ device or sensor errors in weather system of a \ngreenhouse.  This control scheme\
    \ involves a self-tuned fuzzy \nproportional-integral \n(PI) \ncontrol \nscheme,\
    \ \na \nstrong \nfault-hiding-based reconfigurable controller that can fix the\
    \ faulty \neffects, and a reliable and sensitive observer-based fault detection\
    \ \nand diagnosis (FDD) system for diverse kinds of errors in the \npresence of\
    \ scheme disorderliness.  A set of practical actuators \nand sensors were applied\
    \ in this method to renovate the closed-loop \nconsistency and also to confirm\
    \ correct tracking of resource inputs.  \nAzaza et al.[102] introduced a smart\
    \ fuzzy logic based control \nscheme and upgraded by a special measure to the\
    \ humidity \nrelationship and temperature.  Also, the scheme control was \nimproved\
    \ with wireless information observing platform for \ninformation routing and logging\
    \ which prepares actual time of \ninformation entree. \n4.2  Energy analysis and\
    \ optimization models \nEnergy management strategies for optimizing greenhouse\
    \ \ncost[104] require a comprehensive research and knowledge and \nunderstanding\
    \ of climate condition, greenhouse systems, and \nplants’ requirements.  Some\
    \ of these research involves practicing \ninnovative concepts of energy conservation\
    \ and clean-energy using \nmathematical models[141,142], determining energy load\
    \ using \nbuilding energy simulation models[143], computational fluid \ndynamics\
    \ method[119,144,145], or providing optimal growth condition \nwith \nminimum\
    \ \nenvironmental \nimpacts[120,146,147]. \n \nOther \nresearchers have proposed\
    \ optimization methods for maximizing \nthe returns.  See for example the works[148]\
    \ in which a dynamic \nmodel of a greenhouse tomato and the optimal control problem\
    \ for \nthe seasonal benefit of the grower has been presented.  A \nformulation\
    \ of the optimal control problem for minimizing energy \ninput to the greenhouse\
    \ with a dynamic energy balance was \npresented by van Beveren et al.[149] and\
    \ later expanded in [150] to \ninclude humidity balance.  Incrocci et al.[151]\
    \ proposed that \noptimal CO2 concentration in the greenhouse can be based on\
    \ an \neconomic evaluation.  To maintain a given CO2 concentration \nwithin the\
    \ greenhouse, the supply must balance the assimilated CO2 \nflux to the outside\
    \ air due to ventilation.  Linker et al.[152] \noptimized greenhouse operation\
    \ and in particular CO2 control, \nusing a neural network.  Most of these approaches\
    \ have used crop \nmodels and prices of the harvested product.  van Beveren et\
    \ al.[153] \nexpanded this process further by including a dynamic CO2 balance.\
    \  \nThey reported a method to minimize the total energy that is \nrequired to\
    \ heat and cool a greenhouse.  Their research provides a \nmodel to define bounds\
    \ for temperature, humidity, CO2 \nconcentration, the maximum amount of CO2 available,\
    \ and the \neffect of different bounds on optimal energy input.  The addition\
    \ \nof the dynamic CO2 balance provides a truly integrated approach \nthat takes\
    \ all major aspects of greenhouse climate control into \naccount.  This is important,\
    \ given the trade-off between natural \nventilation and the injection of industrial\
    \ CO2, which occurs in a \ngreenhouse with active cooling.  Nadal et al.[154]\
    \ presented an \nenergy and environmental assessment for a roof-top greenhouse\
    \ \nand showed that their greenhouse achieved an annual saving in CO2 \nemissions\
    \ of 113.8 kg/m2 per year, relative to an equivalent \noil-heated greenhouse.\
    \  Vadiee and Martin[155] developed a \ntheoretical model using TRNSYS to carry\
    \ out greenhouse energy \nanalysis.  From the economic feasibility assessment,\
    \ their results \nshowed that the concept has the potential of becoming cost \n\
    effective.  A literature survey on greenhouse energy analysis[156] \nhas concluded\
    \ that evapotranspiration has a significant impact on \nthe micro-climate[156,157].\
    \  This is true since the amount of \nmoisture that is added to the greenhouse\
    \ environment due to \nevapotranspiration helps moderate the vapor pressure deficit.\
    \ \nCurrent advances in CEA systems tend towards sustainability \nand utilizing\
    \ renewable energy by studying wind power, solar \nthermal applications[142] and\
    \ solar energy conservation[141] to \nreduce fuel consumption[158].  For example,\
    \ in tropical and \nsubtropical conditions, the strategy in microclimate control\
    \ is to \nimprove resource efficiency by benefiting from the potentials of \n\
    natural ventilation and shading[120].  In fact, studies of different \ncontrol\
    \ strategies indicated that smart management of natural \nventilation for manipulating\
    \ the environment under specific \nexterior conditions is an effective approach\
    \ to improve productivity \nand increase benefits[124].  A smart tropical greenhouse\
    \ that \noperates on solar panels and benefits from an adaptive design and \n\
    covering materials (i.e., mesh screens) will maximize the use of \nnatural and\
    \ mechanical ventilation[144, 159-162] and will be less \ndependent \non \nhigher-cost\
    \ \ncooling \nmethods \nsuch \nas \nevaporative[67,163-167] and high pressure\
    \ fogging systems[168].  \nNevertheless, the use of anti-insect screens decreases\
    \ the natural \nventilation capacity and aggravates thermal conditions.  It is\
    \ \ntherefore unrealistic to completely eliminate other means of cooling, \n10\

    \  A comprehensive \nreview of advances in greenhouse microclimate control and\
    \ \nautomation system for tropical regions is available in [169]. \n4.3  Environment\
    \ prediction and yield estimation models \nGreenhouse growers use prediction tools\
    \ for the weather \nforecast, photosynthesis predictions for plant growth progress[170],\
    \ \npredicting disease[171], simulation of yield[172], and production \nplanning\
    \ and cost-benefit analysis.  Some of the earlier examples \nof climate models\
    \ to predict the temperature and humidity inside a \ngreenhouse can be found in\
    \ the works of [7, 173-176].  A thermal \nmodel for prediction of microclimate\
    \ factors inside a greenhouse \nwith mechanical ventilation and an evaporative\
    \ cooling system was \nintroduced by Willits[75].  More recent mathematical models\
    \ for \npredicting greenhouse microclimate from external data have been \naddressed\
    \ in [121, 177-180].  An innovative air temperature \nprediction model based on\
    \ least squares and support vector \nmachine with optimized parameters using an\
    \ improved particle \nswarm optimization (IPSO) technique is presented in [181].\
    \  The \nauthors compared and validated the performance of their model \nwith\
    \ conventional modeling techniques by predicting the air \ntemperature in a solar\
    \ greenhouse.  Another example is KASPRO, \nan advanced dynamic model for microclimate\
    \ prediction in \ngreenhouses[176,182].  This model consists of sub-functions\
    \ based \non mass and energy balance of the greenhouse environment.  A \ndetailed\
    \ description of this model is presented in the work of \nRigakis et al.[78] This\
    \ model was used by Graamans et al.[183] to \ndescribe crop transpiration and\
    \ energy balance in plant factories by \ndetermining vapor flux and the relation\
    \ between latent and sensible \nheat exchange for production of lettuce. \nSustainable\
    \ development of modern greenhouse production \nsystems also requires yield estimation\
    \ models and knowledge- \nbased information software for adaptive management of\
    \ resources.  \nSince it is impossible to actually plant and experiment with every\
    \ \nsingle greenhouse design and climate scenario, mathematical \nmodels for simulation\
    \ of yields and growth responses are \nessential for achieving high yield at low\
    \ cost.  These models can \nalso contribute to the optimization and management\
    \ of \ngreenhouse energy under adverse climate conditions.  An early \nexample\
    \ includes the work of Gary et al.[184] in which an \neducational software called\
    \ SIMULSERRE for simulating \ngreenhouse plant system was developed.  Some of\
    \ the \nwell-known simulation models for tomato plants include \nTOMSIM[185],\
    \ TOMPOUSSE[186,187] and TOMGRO[188,189].  A \ncommon weakness with these models\
    \ is that their parameters are \nspecific for the climate condition and greenhouse\
    \ design that they \nwere derived from.  In addition, because of the complexity\
    \ of \nthe interactions between the greenhouse elements and the crop \nitself,\
    \ it is often impossible to correctly predict microclimate \neffects on the final\
    \ yield with the same model parameters.  One \nof the most widely accepted yield\
    \ simulation models is the \nTOMGRO[189] in which the author claimed that “it\
    \ is possible to \nuse the same reduced model with parameters estimated at one\
    \ \nlocation to simulate leaf area and above-ground weight of tomato \ngrowing\
    \ in greenhouse conditions in other locations”.  The first \nversion of TOMGRO[188]\
    \ and the third version[190], respectively \nhad 69 and 574 state variables for\
    \ simulation of tomato growth on \nthe basis of three inputs that are measured\
    \ inside greenhouse \nenvironment: \nthe \nphotosynthetically \nactive \nradiation,\
    \ \nmmol/(m2·s), air temperature, °C and CO2 concentration, ppm.  \nA simplified\
    \ version of TOMGRO[189] was developed with the \nobjective of providing a practical\
    \ application and only has five \nsteady-state variables: (i) node number for\
    \ the main stem, (ii) leaf \narea index, (iii) total plant dry weight (WT), (iv)\
    \ total fruit dry \nweight (WF), and (v) mature fruit dry weight (WM).  Jones\
    \ et \nal.[189] provided simulation results for three tomato varieties \nincluding\
    \ DeRuiters, Beefsteak, and Bigboy respectively for three \nexperiment locations\
    \ at Gainesville (Florida), Avignon (France) \nand Lake City (Florida).  Some\
    \ of the studies related to \nevaluation and adaptation of TOMGRO model to specific\
    \ climate \nconditions and cultural practices can be found in the works of \n\
    [172, 191, 192].  It should be noted that the simplified \nTOMGRO model only takes\
    \ into account the effect of air \ntemperature and light condition, and other\
    \ important variables \nsuch as CO2 concentration were not included in this version.\
    \  In \naddition, Jones et al.[189] did not take the work any farther than \n\
    making the model calculations in an Excel spreadsheet, hence the \nmodel could\
    \ not be used directly with other models to control \ngreenhouse environments.\
    \  To fill this gap, Shamshiri et al.[193] \nevaluated and verified the performance\
    \ of the reduced state \nvariable version of TOMGRO model of Jones et al.[189]\
    \ using \nboundary data that were expected to result in zero yield output.  \n\
    The hypothesis was to test whether the model parameters are \nrobust enough to\
    \ translate an adverse greenhouse environment \n(with air temperature so high\
    \ to prevent any crop growth \ndevelopment) to realistic biomass and yield.  For\
    \ this purpose, \nShamshiri et al.[193] converted the model from spreadsheets\
    \ \nformat to Matlab Simulink (The MathWorks Inc, Natick, MA, \nUSA), provided\
    \ a user interface to access the TOMGRO inputs \nand outputs, and replaced the\
    \ lengthy calculation procedures of \nMicrosoft Excel with one-click step operation\
    \ in Matlab.  This \nSimulink model of Shamshiri et al.[193] provided a flexible\
    \ \nplatform for individuals unfamiliar with computer programming \nlanguages\
    \ and crop modeling to have an easy access to the \nTOMGRO model functionality.\
    \  It was shown that the designed \nSimulink model can be used reliably as a replacement\
    \ for the \nspreadsheet version of TOMGRO model.  Additional research \nworks\
    \ with experimental and simulated based studies for \ninvestigating the effects\
    \ of structure design, covering materials \nand \ncontrol \nsystems \non \ngreenhouse\
    \ \nmicroclimate, \ncrop \ntranspiration, and expected yields are available in\
    \ the works of \n[51, 55, 76, 120, 193, 194]. \n4.4  Decision support systems\
    \ \nThe management of production in a greenhouse requires \ndecision making on\
    \ several tasks and time scales.  These \ndecisions are mainly related to management\
    \ of the crop growth \nconditions[195], the culture period and practice such as\
    \ seedling \nproduction[196], event-based irrigation[197] and the control and\
    \ \nmanagement \nof \nenvironment \nbased \ngrowth \nmodels[198].  \nResearch\
    \ and development in decision support system (DSS) for \ngreenhouse application\
    \ began during the 1990s, primarily for \nrecommending microclimate reference\
    \ values and set-points, and \nfor pest and disease management.  Early studies\
    \ included the \nworks of Fisher et al.[199], Clarke et al.[195] and Sun et al.[200].\
    \  A \nDSS was built by Tchamitchian et al.[201] based on the \nJanuary, 2018\

    \ \nabout the climate control regime that can quantify the energy \ncosts based\
    \ on different control strategies.  More recent studies \ncan be found in the\
    \ works of Cañadas et al.[203] and Aiello et al.[204] \nAn interactive decision\
    \ support system (DSS) developed by \nShort et al.[205] based on the HYTODMOD\
    \ growth response \nmodel of El-Attal[206] is available to describe the optimality\
    \ \ndegrees of air temperature and relative humidity at five growth \nstages and\
    \ under three light conditions (night, sun and cloud).  \nThese functions were\
    \ tested and validated by four independent \nexpert growers and were results of\
    \ experiments with tomato \ncultivar “Carusso” in an A-Shade greenhouse located\
    \ at the Ohio \nAgriculture Research and Development Center with a floor area\
    \ \nof 7.3 m2.  In order to build a model for defining the optimality \ndegrees\
    \ of VPD at different light conditions and growth stages of \ntomato, Shamshiri\
    \ et al.[207] integrated the growth response model \nof El-Attal[206] and developed\
    \ the OptVPD model (Figure 6) with \na series of membership function that take\
    \ VPD (kPa) as input, and \ngenerate a real number between 0 and 1 as output.\
    \  The effects \nof air temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH) on the \noptimality\
    \ degree of VPD based on this model are shown in \nFigure 6.  The knowledge behind\
    \ these functions and the \noptimal and failure microclimate values were condensed\
    \ from \nextensive peer-reviewed \nscientific published \nresearch on \ngreenhouse\
    \ cultivation of tomato and physiology, with the goal of \nsimultaneously achieving\
    \ high yield and high-quality fruit.  \nShamshiri et al.[120] extended and implemented\
    \ TOMGRO model \nin SIMULINK and interfaced it with the HYTODMOD and \nOptVPD\
    \ for microclimate evaluation and yield estimation (Figure \n7).  The interfaced\
    \ HYTODMOD, OptVPD, and TOMGRO \nmodels can be used as a DSS tool for evaluation\
    \ purpose by \nexploring \noptimality \ndegrees \nof \nthe \nmicroclimate \nand\
    \ \nmacroclimate parameters as well as yield estimation depending \non the growth\
    \ stage of the plant and different light condition.  It \nallows growers to manually\
    \ change the values of the growing \nparameters as well as the growth stages and\
    \ receive a feedback by \nmeans of a number between 0 and 1 representing how close\
    \ that \nparameter is to high yield and high quality.  An application of \nthis\
    \ DSS has been presented for dynamic assessment[208], \nmeasuring optimality degrees[46],\
    \ and comparative evaluation of \nmicroclimate parameters[193] in greenhouses\
    \ with different \ncovering materials.  Microclimate evaluation with VPD \ninfluences\
    \ the energy costs involved in greenhouse cultivation \nand must be taken into\
    \ account in humidity and temperature \ncontrol algorithms.  A more in-depth analysis\
    \ and practical \nexamples of this DSS is presented by Shamshiri et al.[120] via\
    \ an \nadaptive management framework.  This framework provides a \nflexible platform\
    \ for altering each participating variables in the \ngreenhouse.  It simulates\
    \ growth and environment responses in \ndifferent light condition, growth stages,\
    \ growing season and \nlocation.  The result is a cost-benefit analysis that shows\
    \ at what \nlevel each combination of variables is close to the optimal \nrequirements.\

    \ (UA) \nThe fast growth of global population is changing the food \nproduction\
    \ systems to keep up with the growing demands.  \nAgricultural innovation and\
    \ research in the past three decades, \ncombined with the advances in information\
    \ technology have \nintroduced promising cultivation techniques that are valuable\
    \ for \nsustainability and economic viability of CEA.  Ellis[209] described \n\
    that throughout the history, agriculture has always been associated \nwith urban\
    \ centers, much more than it is imagined today.  While \ntraditional and modern\
    \ agriculture have been separated in the upper \nlayers, they are still attached\
    \ to each other in the roots.  Today, \nfood, as well as animal livestock, is\
    \ surrounding us everywhere, \nand the question about the origin of this supply\
    \ is not a concern \nanymore.  By the late 2000s, major cities reached the point\
    \ that \nmost people did not even need to associate food with natural \nresources[210].\
    \ \nThe concepts in UA and the associated facilities have \nreceived significant\
    \ attention and popularity in the last 8 years, \nand are growing to meet the\
    \ needs of the ever-developing urban \nlife.  A variety of systems may fall under\
    \ UA concept in \ndifferent scale and possession (Figure 8), ranging from a personal\
    \ \nor local community gardens for social and self-sufficiency \npurposes, to\
    \ complicated systems which involve indoor food \nproduction with the help of\
    \ artificial light or inside factories that \nare capable of controlling the climate\
    \ to produce sensitive plants.  \nSince UA is mostly practiced indoors, it is\
    \ also referred as \nvertical farming (VF)[211], integrated farming inside buildings[212],\
    \ \nand Z-farming (which stands for ZeroAcreageFarming)[213].  \nThis type of\
    \ food production is entering all cities in the world and \nhas attracted public\
    \ interest.  There are new consumers’ needs \nfor fresh food of good quality with\
    \ no damage to nature.  \nSeveral reports indicated that more projects are involved\
    \ in \nbringing farming products into cities[214,215].  “UA is an industry \n\
    that makes, processes and markets food and fuel, mostly in \nreaction to the daily\
    \ need for consumers in a town, city, or \nmetropolitan areas, on land and on\
    \ water spread in the urban and \nsemi-urban area, by employing many methods of\
    \ production, \nusing and recycling natural resources and city wastes to produce\
    \ a \nvariety of products and livestock”[216-219].  In fact, UA is a \nfarming\
    \ movement in the cities for circulation of food and \nnon-food plants and tree\
    \ products.  Some of the suggested \nsolutions for a closed-field production system\
    \ in UA are the plant \nfactories, vertical farming (VA), and rooftop greenhouses.\

    \ a city center \n \n5.1  Vertical farming and rooftop greenhouses \nThe concept\
    \ of VF is not new.  Kaplan[220] explained that VF \nhas been unknown for a long\
    \ time, and was then brought to \nattention in the recent years through the advances\
    \ in technology.  \nLife magazine has published one of the very first sketches\
    \ of a tall \nconstruction that promotes agricultural products for people daily\
    \ \nfood requests as early as 1909.  In 1915, the American geologist \nGilbert\
    \ Ellis Bailey used the concept of the tall multi-story \nbuildings for indoor\
    \ cultivation.  He created the term “Vertical \nFarming” in his book with the\
    \ same title as “Vertical Farming”[221].  \nDesigners and landscape architects\
    \ have frequently looked into the \nconcept, particularly at the end of the 20th\
    \ century.  During the \n1970s until the early 1980s, the Malaysian-born architect,\
    \ Ken \nYeang improved and advanced the ideas of Bailey into an \narchitectural\
    \ project[222,223].  It is called Bioclimatic Skyscraper \n(Menara Mesiniaga)\
    \ that was built in 1992.  In 1993, Nancy Jack \nTodd and John Todd envisioned\
    \ the idea of VF in their book \nentitled “From Eco-Cities to Living Machines”.\
    \  The most recent \nand greatest challenging form of this idea however appeared\
    \ in \n1999 by Dickson Despommier’s, an Emeritus Professor of \nMicrobiology at\
    \ the Columbia University, speculating that a \n30-floor farm on one city block\
    \ could provide food for 50 000 \npeople with vegetables, fruit, eggs and meat,\
    \ explaining that \nhydroponic crops could be grown on upper floors; and the lower\
    \ \nfloors would be suited for chickens and fish that eat plants waste.  \nIn\
    \ the concept of VF, heat and lighting would be provided by \ngeothermal, tidal,\
    \ solar, or other recyclable sources of energy.  \nNitrogen along with other nutrients\
    \ would be sieved from animal \nwaste and maybe from the urban sewage system.\
    \  It should be \nnoted that until 2010, there was no report of evidence for VF\
    \ \nconstruction before it began emerging in USA, Singapore, Japan, \nand Korea.\
    \  In theory, VF is the technique that includes \nlarge-scale food production\
    \ in skyscrapers that makes rapid growth \nand planned production possible through\
    \ managing nutrient \nsolution of crop and the growth context according to hydroponics\
    \ \nmethods.  With the help of cutting-edge greenhouse approaches, \nthese buildings\
    \ can be used as a precision farming system that \npaves the way for the acquisition\
    \ of a safe crop growth through \ncontrolling and supervising of the microenvironment\
    \ using sensors, \ninterfacing gadgets and instrumentation[210,213,224-227]. \n\
    In the recent years, the majority of scientific publications in \nUA have focused\
    \ on different aspects of the VF concept.  For \nexample, Sivamani et al.[228]\
    \ studied the viability of smart \ntechnology used in agriculture as an opportunity\
    \ to be used for \nVF[228,229].  Research findings have shown that VF is a promising\
    \ \ntechnique for providing food for cities in a sustainable way.  \nHowever,\
    \ it is also a function of the location and design[229].  It is \nmentioned that\
    \ VF is a way of feeding and at the same time a \nmovement in the society to reduce\
    \ greenhouse gas emission[219,230].  \nA common debate about VF is the compromising\
    \ between the \nbuilding structure and the returns.  Some estimates that an \n\
    abandoned building can be adapted to the needs of VA, while other \nbelieves that\
    \ only buildings with new design will satisfy that need.  \nA study by Kalantari\
    \ et al.[231] presented several effective VF \nprojects in different countries\
    \ by estimating their feasibility and \nviability in various geographical areas.\
    \  The data was shaped \nbased on the technology of different VF in different\
    \ climate areas.  \nIt was shown by Kalantari et al.[231] that every VF has its\
    \ own \ntechnologies and techniques according to the different geographical \n\
    locations.  Table 1 presents the details of some of effective VF \nprojects in\
    \ different countries and shows the different areas by their \ntype of building\
    \ and typologies.  An interesting example includes \nthe conceptual design of\
    \ the Urban Sky-farm for downtown of \nSeoul is shown in Figure 9 with different\
    \ sections of the structure \nillustrated by labels.  This design was the winner\
    \ of the 2013 \ngreen dot design competition.  The key concept of a vertical farm\
    \ \nis to yield as much crop as possible under optimal circumstances, \neven in\
    \ the center of cities.  Thus, the VF shown in Figure 9 \nincludes many floors\
    \ with a variety of crops on each.  Different \ncrops need different environmental\
    \ conditions.  Therefore, tracing \na crop and its location is of a great significance[228].\
    \ \nVertical farms can be diverse from city to city and their \nstructures also\
    \ vary around the world[210].  The other two \nconceptual designs for vertical\
    \ farms are shown in Figure 10. The \nfirst design (Figure 10a) was designed by\
    \ ODESIGN group for \nAustralia. The other type of VF called urban farming units\
    \ (UFU) \nis shown in Figure 10b, a farm within shipping containers that can \n\
    produce organic fish, fruits, and vegetables in the street. The entire \nprototypes\
    \ are rooted in circular agriculture techniques. The main \ngoals of UFU are to\
    \ find a way to grow food under polluted and \nlimited ground[232]. Figure 10b\
    \ shows a conceptual design of an \nAquaponics farm with fish tanks that can be\
    \ placed inside or close \nto the plant in different levels of the farm.  In this\
    \ system, the \nplants clean and purify the water for the fish, and in return,\
    \ fish \nfeed the plants with their waste as a source of nutrients.  The \nFreight\
    \ Farms in Table 1 is also an example of a vertical farm in a \nshipping container.\
    \ \nAnother solution for UA is the rooftop greenhouse (RTG) and \nbuilding integrated\
    \ rooftop greenhouse (i-RTG) concept.  It is \ndefined as a greenhouse constructed\
    \ on top of a building, usually \nmatched with soilless culture systems[233].\

    \ \nand the building are capable of exchanging air and can harvest the \nrainwater\
    \ or make use of the decently treated grey water for the \npurpose of irrigation.\
    \  Some experimental research indicated that \ni-RTG has failed to provide proper\
    \ light transmission[236], resulting \nin low radiation use efficiency (RUE),\
    \ however this issue is not \nconcerning RTG structure.  In comparison to traditional\
    \ greenhouses \nin the region, which are generally unheated, a primary advantage\
    \ of \ni-RTG is their better and more uniform temperature regime, owing \nto the\
    \ thermal links to the building.  This is an obvious benefit for \nenergy saving\
    \ over the conventional ground greenhouses.  Some \nof the examples of RTG farming\

    \ are usually used for commercial production of \nleafy greens, but their potential\
    \ remains uncertain.  A general \nstructure design of a plant factory and corresponding\
    \ components \nsections are shown in Figure 11.  In order to achieve economic\
    \ \nviability, the increased resource productivity and/or the value of \nadditional\
    \ services in these structures would have to outweigh the \ndisadvantage of the\
    \ absence of solar energy.  Plant factories have \nbeen primarily used in Asia\
    \ to refer to a commercial plant production \nfactory similar in operations to\
    \ an ordinary industrial firm.  Some \nof the technological instrumentations and\
    \ equipment supporting \nthese factories for deriving the plants to their maximum\
    \ potentials \nare precision sensors, nutrition solution, process controllers,\
    \ \nautomated instruments, computer systems, and environmental \nsupervision along\
    \ with implementation of DSS and task \nmanagement software.  Moreover, a number\
    \ of plant factories also \nbenefits from robotic systems for sorting, transferring,\
    \ and handling \nof the plants, as well as quality control, and post-harvesting.\
    \  Because \nof the relatively higher economic investment that is required for\
    \ \nplant factories, they are managed with resource efficiency and \nproduction\
    \ predictability to attain market-valuable crops. \nIn the Japanese context, there\
    \ existed 165 plant factories which \nare using artificially lighting combined\
    \ with natural solar lights[237].  \nAdditional sub-system might be required in\
    \ plant factories for air \nexchange to eliminate the temperature increase due\
    \ to the artificial \nlight.  Plant factories which have full artificial light\
    \ sources \nusually utilize opaque building materials.  This would offer a \n\
    chance to have the walls and roofs well resistant which makes \ncontrolling the\
    \ internal temperature easier and helps conserve the \nenergy.  Furthermore, often\
    \ the skin facade of the building is \ncovered by a self-cleaning and transparent\
    \ material such as \nEthylene Tetra Fluoro Ethylene (ETFE).  In addition, a material\
    \ \nwhich is highly clear and a high thermal rate are required to \nincrease the\
    \ intensity of sunlight that enters the building.  ETFE is \nlight enough as it\
    \ enjoys only 1% weight of an equal-sized piece of \nglass.  However, it lets\
    \ in 95% of light.  There exists a different \nintensity of pressure between the\
    \ ETFE layers.  Such a pressure \nhelps to close and open the screens so as to\
    \ change the passage of \nsunlight[209].  ETFE which is a standardized construction\
    \ material \nhas been used on an extensive surface of ethereal domes in the \n\
    Eden Project in the south of England[14,238]. \nStudies showed that quantitative\
    \ blue light was able to improve \nphotosynthetic performance or growth through\
    \ motivating \nmorphological as well as physiological responses.  Miyagi et \n\
    al.[239] showed that synergistic effects of monochromic LED \ntogether with high\
    \ CO2 and nutrients can enhance lettuce growth in \na plant factory.  Shimokawa\
    \ et al.[240] concluded that red and blue \nirradiation used at the same time\
    \ improve plant growth more than \nmonochromatic \nand \nfluorescent \nlight \n\
    irradiation. \n \nThese \nresearchers also observed that alternatively use of\
    \ red and blue light \naccelerated plant growth dramatically, with the fresh weight\
    \ of a \nrandomly measured plant that was found to be two times as much \nas the\
    \ usual LED production methods.  The bacterial biofertilizers \nused in plant\
    \ factories may positively affect plant growth in several \n16   January, 2018\

    \ \nFigure 11  General structure design of a plant factory \n \n5.3  Opportunities\
    \ and challenges \nVertical farming entails producing plants in a soil-less culture\
    \ \nwith nutrient solution and deals with problems concerning the use \nof soils,\
    \ including the need for herbicides, pesticides, and \nfertilizers and then it\
    \ supplies healthy organic food which is free \nfrom \nchemicals[213]. \n \nAnother\
    \ \nprivilege \nis \nto \nremove \ntransportation costs and CO2 production which\
    \ accompany the \ncarry-over of foods far away to somewhere near the consumer.\
    \  \nMoreover, products can be provided all-year-round corresponding \nto people’s\
    \ demand.  Furthermore, plant-production conditions \ncan be improved to increase\
    \ the yield by adjusting temperature, \nhumidity, and lighting conditions precisely.\
    \  Indoor agriculture \nin a controlled setting also needs much less water than\
    \ outdoor \nfarming as it involves recycling the graywater and lowering the \n\
    evaporation.  Together with the regulation of temperature and \nhumidity, it can\
    \ also decrease or omit the effects of seasonality.  \nFreshwater is increased\
    \ through the evaporation of black and \ngraywater in order to preserve water\
    \ resources.  Moreover, \nrecycled water obtained from rain can be innovatively\
    \ reused.  \nRecycling and dehumidifying strategies can be used for the city’s\
    \ \nwater supplies.  Similarly, aeroponic and hydroponic systems \ncan help raise\
    \ the efficiency of water consumption to 97% in \ncomparison to traditional agriculture[242].\
    \  Moreover, a constant \nflow of air is produced through air conditioning that\
    \ can be \nenhanced with carbon dioxide (CO2) so as to contribute to plant \n\
    growth even more.  Both environmental parameters and nutrient \nuptake may be\
    \ kept at certain levels that improve the speed of \nplant growth.  It was mentioned\
    \ that plants will have a better \nevapotranspiration and yield with the modification\
    \ of bandwidth \nof LED lighting.   \nUA, VF, RTG and plant factories provide\
    \ a unique opportunity \nfor reducing fossil fuels by utilizing solar panels,\
    \ roof-top wind \nturbines, or storage batteries[242,243] as shown schematically\
    \ in \nFigure 12.  The economic benefits of vertical farms include the \nreduction\
    \ of the cost of energy, lowering of food price, and an \neconomic opportunity\
    \ to secure land and return investments to the \ninvestor through protecting floods,\
    \ droughts, or damage caused by \nthe sun.  New job opportunities can be created\
    \ by VF in \nengineering, \nbiochemistry, \nbiotechnology, \nconstruction, \n\
    maintenance and research, with the chances to improve the \ntechnology.  Moreover,\
    \ the social benefits of VF are diverse and \ninvolve the psychological, and spiritual\
    \ health of the community, \nsuch as education, leisure, and more social communication\
    \ and \nhealthier food habits[213,242,244]. \n \nFigure 12  Conceptual design\
    \ for adaptation of renewable energy \nfor commercial development of sustainable\
    \ CEA and plant \nfactories \n \nSeveral researchers have claimed that, in a VF\
    \ system, the \nplants on the upper sections of the structure will only benefit\
    \ from \nsolar radiation, and that the energy supplied by the photovoltaics \n\
    solar panel may be restricted, or not justified cost wise[225].  \nHowever, solar\
    \ panels are now more efficient in generating energy, \nJanuary, 2018        \
    \   Shamshiri R R, et al.  Advances in greenhouse automation and controlled environment\
    \ agriculture                Vol. 11 No.1   17 \nand the introduction of new affordable\
    \ and energy efficient LED \nlighting is an accepted substitute to compensate\
    \ the lack of natural \nlight.  We mentioned earlier that the LED sources are\
    \ capable of \nincreasing the yield in greenhouse context significantly because\
    \ of \nmatching spectral features with plant type and physiology[229,242].  \n\
    In addition, extra sun exposure is also possible through stacked \nlevels of plants\
    \ that can be rotated within one high-rise closed-space. \nThe extra cost of VF\
    \ start-ups can be resolved if the supporting \nstructures are not built on the\
    \ expensive central business districts, \nhowever there are still several challenges\
    \ with VF.  Indeed, the \nprimary costs of establishing, equipping and implementing\
    \ a VF \nare certainly high and are mostly accounted for energy \nconsumption.\
    \  The number and variety of crops grown is not as \nmany as in rural farming.\
    \  The quantity and loads of the crops are \nalso not as much as in the open-field\
    \ cultivation.  There are other \nchallenges too such as the need for disruption\
    \ management to the \nrural sector, to raise investment capital, and to train\
    \ workforce.  \nThese costs will be lowered through the time, particularly those\
    \ \nconcerning energy provision.  Abel[210] also mentioned that \nalthough establishing\
    \ VF is very costly at the beginning, but when \nit is well-established and fully\
    \ operated, the price of food will be \nlowered.  According to Despommier[14],\
    \ there are many \nappropriate locations for VF projects in every city and if\
    \ these \nlocations are used efficiently, they are able to return and circulate\
    \ \nlarge sums of money to the city[245].  It is concluded by Voss[246] \nthat\
    \ assessing all conditions on every level is essential, in order to \nthoroughly\
    \ consider all possibilities and then to decide on the \nestablishment of a VF.\
    \  Furthermore, VF as a concept is a \npromising move along the right path for\
    \ the fans of the \nrevolutionary resource-based economy movement.  Economic \n\
    analysis, along with the exploration of the impact of VF on \npost-industrial\
    \ cities can be topics of future studies. \n6  Conclusions \nUrbanization and\
    \ living in multi-story buildings request a \nredefinition of agricultural awareness\
    \ for securing food supply.  \nThe economic viability of traditional greenhouses\
    \ in this new \nscenario is likely to fade in the coming decades.  A trend in\
    \ the \npast 15 years of published literature showed that researchers and \ngreenhouse\
    \ growers have become more interested in shifting \ntowards smart controlled environment\
    \ agriculture.  The research \nconcentration has shifted from instrumentation\
    \ control and \nhardware-software interfacing to other scopes, such as simulating\
    \ \nthe interactions between microclimate parameters and plant growth.  \nResearchers\
    \ in this field are developing complex mathematical \nmodels to minimize energy\
    \ inputs, or are interested in finding \ninnovative solutions for replacing the\
    \ fossil energy consuming \ngreenhouses with energy neutral CEA systems that operate\
    \ on solar \nand wind power.  The main aspect that requires improvements in \n\
    this field is the task planning algorithms.  Path planning is well \nknown, but\
    \ to provide the CEA with an adaptive design and control \nstrategy that forms\
    \ the right shape and perform the right task at the \nright time, while increasing\
    \ profits and remaining competitive in \nthe market is still a challenge.  This\
    \ research presented an \noverview \nof \nmodern \ngreenhouses, \ncontrolled \n\
    environment \nagriculture and their derivatives, and highlighted some of the \n\
    advances in environmental monitoring, control, and optimization.  \nWhile biological\
    \ sensors, like those that measures plant stress are \nthe key to such high-level\
    \ of automation, this technology is either \nvery expensive for local growers\
    \ to afford, or even not available.  \nIn addition, it is not clearly well known\
    \ the cost of increased \nautomation relative to increase in profitability.  Therefore,\
    \ another \narea helping sustainability is knowledge based and decision making\
    \ \nsupport systems, i.e., model based computer applications that \naddress the\
    \ cost benefit for a proposed automation technology.  \nThis paper highlighted\
    \ some the most recent technological \nadvances for closed-field agriculture by\
    \ reviewing the applications \nof plant factories and rooftop greenhouses.  Some\
    \ of the \nconceptual designs in this context were introduces along with \nseveral\
    \ existing commercial examples to show the trends in \ndeveloping sustainable\
    \ farming system in the center of dense cities.  \nBased on the review literature,\
    \ this study concludes that a more \naccurate economic analysis and justifications\
    \ of the high startup \ncosts involved with vertical farming and plant factories\
    \ are required \nbefore large-scale commercial development.  The computer \nsimulation\
    \ models and adaptive analysis software are already \navailable for greenhouses\
    \ and CEA systems can be extended and \nmodified for this purpose.  The cost of\
    \ increased automation level \nrelative to increases in profitability is a key\
    \ consideration, and \nshould form part of future study to justify the implementation\
    \ of a \ngreater level of automation. \n \n[References] \n[1] \nTing K C, Lin\

    Footnotes Abstract: This paper provides recent advances in the area of Internet
    of Underground Things (IoUT) with emphasis on enabling communication technologies,
    networking issues, and localization techniques. IoUT is enabled by underground
    things (sensors), communication technology, and networking protocols. This new
    paradigm of IoUT facilitates the integration of sensing and communication in the
    underground environment for various industries, such as oil and gas, agriculture,
    seismic mapping, and border monitoring. These applications require to gather relevant
    information from the deployed underground things. However, the harsh underground
    propagation environment including sand, rock, and watersheds do not allow the
    use of single communication technology for information transfer between the surface
    and the underground things. Therefore, various wireless and wired communication
    technologies are used for underground communication. The wireless technologies
    are based on acoustic waves, electromagnetic waves, magnetic induction and visible
    light communication while the wired technologies use coaxial cable and optical
    fibers. In this paper, state-of-art communication technologies are surveyed, and
    the respective networking and localization techniques for IoUT are presented.
    Moreover, the advances and applications of IoUT are also reported. Also, new research
    challenges for the design and implementation of IoUT are identified. Published

    DOI: 10.1109/COMST.2019.2934365 Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: I. Introduction
    The population of the world will increase by 31% in 2050 [1], and therefore will
    require more natural resources and food to survive. In the next three decades
    with such increase in population, 71% more resources are required [2]. This ever-increasing
    demand for resources needs novel technologies to improve the underground exploration
    for natural resources and to produce more crop. The subsurface environment and
    agricultural lands provide various natural resources, such as earth minerals,
    fossil fuels, metal ores, groundwater, and food. To efficiently use all of these
    resources, Internet of Underground Things (IoUT) is an enabling technology which
    can provide smart oil and gas fields, smart agriculture fields, and smart seismic
    quality control. However, implementation of IoUT is a challenging task due to
    the harsh underground environment which requires low power and small size underground
    sensors, long-range communication technology, efficient networking solutions,
    and accurate localization techniques. Sign in to Continue Reading Authors Figures

    Fifth generation (5G) mobile communication systems have entered the stage of commercial
    deployment, providing users with new services, improved user experiences as well
    as a host of novel opportunities to various industries. However, 5G still faces
    many challenges. To address these challenges, international industrial, academic,
    and standards organizations have commenced research on sixth generation (6G) wireless
    communication systems. A series of white papers and survey papers have been published,
    which aim to define 6G in terms of requirements, application scenarios, key technologies,
    etc. Although ITU-R has been working on the 6G vision and it is expected to reach
    a consensus on what 6G will be by mid-2023, the related global discussions are
    still wide open and the existing literature has identified numerous open issues.
    This paper first provides a comprehensive portrayal of the 6G vision, technical
    requirements, and application scenarios, covering the current common understanding
    of 6G. Then, a critical appraisal of the 6G network architecture and key technologies
    is presented. Furthermore, existing testbeds and advanced 6G verification platforms
    are detailed for the first time. In addition, future research directions and open
    challenges are identified to stimulate the on-going global debate. Finally, lessons
    learned to date concerning 6G networks are discussed. Published in: IEEE Communications

    Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: I. Introduction With the rapid development of
    communication applications, communication technologies are undergoing revolutionary
    changes generation after generation. Up till now, the development of cellular
    mobile communication systems has undergone five generations. From the first generation
    (1G) analog communication systems to fifth generation (5G) digital communication
    systems, each generation incorporates higher frequencies, larger bandwidths, and
    higher data rates. Starting from 2019, 5G has been officially commercialized,
    employing sub-6 GHz and millimeter wave (mmWave) bands, with a peak rate of 20
    Gbps. From the architecture’s perspective, mobile communication systems have been
    evolving towards more antennas, more advanced multiple access technologies, and
    richer services, as shown in Fig. 1. The 5G base stations exploit massive multiple-input
    multiple-output (MIMO) [1], mmWave, and ultra-dense networking (UDN) technologies
    [2], supporting up to 64 transceiver chains with more antenna elements. Currently,
    commercial 5G base station products using 128 antennas are mature, and HUAWEI
    is the first to release a massive MIMO base station with 384 antennas [3]. In
    addition, 5G can support augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and Internet
    of Everything (IoE). Fig. 1. 1G-5G: Antennas, multiple access technologies, and

    55 SECTIONS PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract [1] A new stand-alone wireless embedded network
    system has been developed recently for continuous monitoring of soil water contents
    at multiple depths. This paper presents information on the technical aspects of
    the system, including the applied sensor technology, the wireless communication
    protocols, the gateway station for data collection, and data transfer to an end
    user Web page for disseminating results to targeted audiences. Results from the
    first test of the network system are presented and discussed, including lessons
    learned so far and actions to be undertaken in the near future to improve and
    enhance the operability of this innovative measurement approach. 1. Introduction
    [2] Wireless embedded network systems generally consist of the following components:
    (1) a series of probe/sensor nodes, (2) a series of infrastructure nodes, (3)
    an end node for data gathering and transfer, and (4) a data logger or PC. Wireless
    sensor networks are an emerging technology, and research on the development of
    such systems is receiving increasing attention around the world [Benini et al.,
    2006]. The main focus is on advancing the current technology in relation to network
    performance, reliability, security, efficient data propagation strategies, and
    network applicability [Akyildiz et al., 2002; Chatzigiannakis et al., 2008; Powell
    et al., 2007]. [3] The potential uses of wireless network systems are countless,
    and application of wireless network technology can be used for instance for certain
    indoor domains like monitoring of industrial processes [Howitt et al., 2006],
    buildings [Jang et al., 2008], logistics [Crowley et al., 2005; Jedermann et al.,
    2006; Ruiz-Garcia et al., 2008], mobile object tracking [Tsai et al., 2007], healthcare
    [Misic and Misic, 2007], and the food industry [Wang et al., 2006]. [4] Wireless
    embedded network systems are also been used in the outdoor world, for instance
    for monitoring and control of processes in the natural environment [Hart and Martinez,
    2006]. Mahfuz and Ahmed [2005] review the prospects and challenges of wireless
    sensor networks for environmental protection, while Bellis et al. [2005] describe
    a first attempt to develop field programmable modular wireless sensor network
    nodes. Cayirci et al. [2006] describe a wireless sensor network for underwater
    surveillance using various types of microsensors. Suri et al. [2006] provide an
    overview of the potential use of wireless sensor networks for obtaining ecology
    related information, while Nadimi et al. [2008] apply this technology for tracking
    animal presence and behavior. [5] Wireless sensor technology has also been tested
    recently for agricultural land use by Camilli et al. [2007] in relation to improving
    precision agriculture, by Pierce and Elliott [2008] to reveal regional and on-farm
    data on several meteorological parameters, and by Cao et al. [2008] to monitor
    the microclimatological conditions in a small tea garden. Recently, wireless sensor
    systems also entered the commercial markets in among other the United States,
    Australia and several European countries. [6] However, one thing all systems and
    applications described above have in common, is that the transmitting and receiving
    network components are always installed and located aboveground, in direct contact
    with the air. Akyildiz and Stuntebeck [2006] speculate that wireless underground
    sensor networks (WUSNs) can be designed in theory as well, and outline associated
    research challenges, especially in relation to power conservation, underground
    communication, and antenna design. Several research groups around the world are
    currently working on developing and testing such underground systems, but none
    have yet presented results. [7] This paper presents the first example and test
    results of a wireless underground sensor network (WUSN) capable of monitoring
    soil water contents at time intervals of minutes on multiple locations in an area
    of several km2. Design and technical details of the WUSN will be highlighted and
    discussed, and performance during an extensive field experiment outlined and evaluated.
    2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Network Architecture and Functionality [8] The embedded
    network system that has been developed and installed is an ultra low power self-organizing
    multihop wireless mesh network that consists of five basic elements: (1) probe
    nodes, (2) infrastructure nodes, (3) a gateway node, (4) a PC, and (5) a Web interface
    (see Figure 1). Figure 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Network architecture
    comprising the following components: (1) probe nodes, (2) infrastructure nodes,
    (3) a gateway, (4) PC with Internet, and (5) an Internet server with a Web interface
    for end users. [9] The soil moisture sensors used are commercially available EC-5
    sensors produced by Decagon, United States (http://www.decagon.com). This sensor
    has been selected from the many commercially available products (http://www.sowacs.com/sensors/)
    [Robinson et al., 2008; Topp and Ferre, 2002] on the basis of its low cost and
    low-energy consumption. The network system related hard and software has been
    provided by Ambient Systems B.V., Netherlands (http://www.ambient-systems.net),
    and the Web interface protocols and data visualization tools have been designed
    specifically for this purpose by Pentanovation, Netherlands. 2.1.1. Probe Nodes
    [10] The probe nodes which are installed below soil surface, are the endpoints
    of the sensor network and perform underground measuring tasks. The probe nodes
    are made up of a network node (controller, transceiver plus antenna, memory),
    two Decagon EC-5 soil moisture sensors, and a battery set. [11] The network nodes
    are small, and each network node contains an interface bank that can connect to
    a number of different sensors. Sixteen pins are available for general purpose
    input/output (GPIO), and various digital protocols are implemented as well such
    as one wire, I2C, SPI, analog (ADC and DAC), and RS232/UART. In our case the Decagon
    EC-5 soil moisture sensors have been connected to the node interface bank. The
    network node contains a significant amount of memory (10KB RAM, 512KB ROM flash)
    for buffering sensor data in case network connectivity is unavailable. Network
    nodes contain a low-power transceiver (Nordic NRF905, frequency 868 MHz, see http://www.nordicsemi.com)
    for wireless connectivity with a wireless sensor network. The typical battery
    life of a network node is more than 7 years; see 3 for more details. [12] The
    Decagon EC-5 soil moisture sensors measure the dielectric permittivity of the
    soil to determine volumetric water content. Benefits of EC probes are among other
    things their (1) low cost compared to other soil moisture probes, (2) durable
    design and proven evidence of long-term performance in the field, (3) single calibration
    for all mineral soils (at normal salinity levels), (4) very low power requirement
    compared to other sensors, (5) low operating voltage (3V), and (6) ease of installation.
    Recently, the EC-5 probes have been extensively tested by Bogena et al. [2007]
    for potential use in wireless network applications and were found to be suitable
    for this purpose. [13] The current version of the probe node has been designed
    to measure soil moisture content at two different points below the soil surface.
    For this purpose, a sensor housing has been designed containing two separate Decagon
    EC-5 sensors 6 cm apart vertically. The sensor device is designed to be installed
    below soil surface, with the Decagon sensors positioned in such way that measurements
    are obtained from two different soil depths. The minimum installation depth of
    the top of the sensor device is 2 cm below soil surface, making the measurement
    depths of the sensors 4 and 10 cm, respectively. The probe node system used in
    this study is mounted in a specially designed waterproof housing that can be installed
    easily at the required soil depth. By using multiple sensor devices on one location,
    a soil moisture profile of multiple levels can be determined. 2.1.1.1. Probe Node
    Mechanical Design [14] The probe node housing has been constructed using a front
    and a back shell that can be screwed together after the internal components have
    been mounted. After closing the housing, it is sealed using a waterproof resin,
    making it completely waterproof and suitable for long-term subsurface installation.
    The advantage of the two-shell construction is that the housing can be opened
    and the battery set replaced if necessary, or the separate components replaced
    or reused. The shape of the probe node housing is designed in order to make installation
    as simple as possible. Originally, the probe nodes were designed for use on golf
    courses. On golf courses, standardized 10.8 cm diameter cup cutters are used for
    (re)placing the holes and flags on a green. The probe node housings were designed
    to easily fit into a 10.8 cm diameter hole for installation. [15] The installation
    of the probe node is as follows: a 15 cm deep circular hole is cut into the soil,
    using a standard cup cutter. After this, the probe node is lowered into the hole
    and pushed into the hole wall at the desired depth. The front of the probe node
    housing has a rounded shape that fits exactly to the curvature of the 10.8 cm
    diameter hole. This ensures optimal contact between the probe node housing and
    the hole wall. After installation, the hole is back filled with soil and the removed
    turf is replaced to cover the probe node so it is invisible to the eye. Optionally,
    in order to relocate the buried probe node easily, a small additional piece (circular
    in form, white colored, and with a size of a quarter dollar coin) can be connected
    to the top of the housing, and left exposed to the surface after installation.
    Installation requires only 10–15 min per node probe. 2.1.1.2. Probe Node Electrical
    Design [16] The probe nodes have been designed for long-term maintenance-free
    operation while installed below the soil surface. To accomplish this, high-quality,
    high-durability lithium cells are used as a power supply. The total battery life
    depends on a number of factors. The most important are: standby energy consumption
    (the probe node is in the standby mode during more than 99.9% of its lifetime),
    measuring frequency, energy consumption during transmitting of the data (power
    needed to bridge the distance between sensor node and aboveground infrastructure
    node), installation depth (HF energy absorbing soil layer to be bridged), average
    moisture content of the soil that covers the probe node (moist soil absorbs more
    HF energy than dry soil), closest distance to the aboveground network (are broadcast
    repetitions necessary or not), and temperature. After the battery set is exhausted
    it can be replaced or the entire probe node can simply be replaced, whichever
    is most cost effective. In the current design, attempts have been made to achieve
    an optimum balance between the above mentioned factors and the functionality of
    the probe node, enabling the current version of the probe node to be used for
    many years on a single battery set. A 1-h power consumption budget for the probe
    node is shown in Table 1 on the basis of four samplings and transmissions per
    hour. On the basis of the use of a C lithium 3.6 V battery (Tadiran, SL-2770)
    with a total capacity of 8500 mA h, and an expected efficiency of 90%, the probe
    node battery can be used for around 2778 days, i.e., more than 7.5 years. Table

    Use of a lithium battery (C cell, 3.6 V, 8500 mA h, 90% efficiency) enables the
    probe node to function for more than 7.5 years. 2.1.1.3. Probe Node Calibration
    [17] The Decagon EC-5 sensors produce an analog signal that is proportional to
    the moisture content of the soil surrounding the sensor rods. Because this output
    voltage is also sensitive to the supply voltage, the sensors are powered with
    an internally stabilized voltage. The sensor''s analog output voltages are converted
    to numbers using an internal 12-bit analog to digital converter. These voltage
    values are stored locally, transmitted over the wireless network, and finally
    stored in the central database. [18] The EC-5 sensors are supplied with a standard
    calibration curve for the calculation of soil moisture values from the measured
    output voltages. Using the standard calibration curve, a limited accuracy of ±2%
    to 3% can be achieved. Output voltage values are determined during measurements,
    and transmitted by the network of infrastructure nodes to the gateway. Output
    voltage data are converted to actual soil water contents within the linked Web
    application to graphically present the obtained data to potential end users of
    the system. This procedure enables the use of both the standard calibration curve
    provided by Decagon, as well as a site-specific soil calibration curve if desired
    and/or required by the user. Also, recalibration is possible using this methodology.
    The parameters of the calibration curve for each separate sensor can be stored
    in the Web application database. 2.1.2. Infrastructure Nodes [19] The battery-powered
    infrastructure nodes produced by Ambient Systems B.V. are installed above the
    ground and they are developed to form a wireless network for supporting all data
    transfer and routing. An infrastructure node consists of a transceiver, a microcontroller,
    memory, and a battery. The radio frequency used is 868 MHz, and a TDMA-based protocol
    is used for contention. Transmitted power is adjustable up to 10 mW. Infrastructure
    nodes receive data from probe nodes and other infrastructure nodes. The system
    is self-organizing so the data will be transported over the network using the
    most efficient and reliable route to the gathering point in the network, the gateway
    node. The most important features of the infrastructure nodes used in the study
    are that they (1) are meshing nodes, (2) typically cover 250 m or more outdoors,
    (3) are self-organizing, fault tolerant, and self-healing, (4) automatically find
    the best route to the gateway, (5) connect up to an almost unlimited amount (232)
    of probe nodes (limitation is two communications of a probe node per second per
    infrastructure node), (6) store data from probe nodes in case a gateway is unavailable,
    (7) are energy efficient (battery powered with a lithium D cell 3.6 V 19000 mA
    h, ensuring at least 1.5 years of operation for the field test discussed later),
    and (8) are remotely controlled and serviceable via the device driver interface
    (DDI). Through the DDI it is possible to approach nodes in the network for retrieving
    simple operational information or to configure advanced business rules using a
    device like a GPRS/UMTS data logger or (embedded) PC. Ambient Studio (see point
    6 in this section) provides a graphical user interface to perform such tasks easily.
    2.1.3. Gateway Node [20] The gateway node is a special network node that functions
    as a bridge between the mesh network and a logging device such as a PC or GPRS/UMTS
    logger. The gateway is the unit which ensures that information flows from the
    sensor network to the user and vice versa. Furthermore, the gateway node is the
    controller of the network, it keeps the network running. The features of the gateway
    used in this study are (1) an open, transparent gateway to/from the sensor network;
    (2) an RS232 interface; (3) industry standard compliance, (4) the ability to connect
    up to at least 31 infrastructure nodes; (5) remote control capability and serviceability
    via the DDI, and (6) auto discovery of an active logger. If no logger is available,
    the gateway is able to change its network mode in order to leave the data on the
    nodes. When the logger is switched on again the data is flushed to this device.
    The data gathered from the sensor network by the gateway is stored on the local
    storage device of the PC, and periodically transferred over the Internet to a
    database on an Internet server. 2.1.4. Web Interface [21] A Web interface has
    been developed that enables users to log into the Internet server on which the
    measurement data are stored. Users can access various graphical visualizations
    of the data which are generated dynamically. The field data are displayed with
    a default delay of no more than 15 min, however this can be changed to any preferred
    time interval varying from every minute to for instance once a day. 2.1.5. Network
    Communication [22] In the current network configuration, the probe nodes are programmed
    to measure soil moisture content from both sensors every 15 min. The measured
    data are stored in the internal memory of the probe node and sent from the probe
    node to an aboveground infrastructure node using a push method. A probe node will
    listen every 15 min if any infrastructure node can be reached. If communication
    has been established, the probe node will try to transmit its data from memory
    to the aboveground network, which will be followed by an acknowledgment of receipt
    by the infrastructure node. By keeping track of the received acknowledgments,
    the probe node can detect which measurements have successfully reached the aboveground
    infrastructure. Measurements that were sent but whose receipt was not acknowledged,
    will be resent later. The probe nodes and infrastructure nodes can store data
    for up to a week in a circular buffer. After more than a week the data will be
    overwritten, however the data storage buffer can be increased depending on user
    wishes. [23] The wireless network uses a lightweight medium access protocol (based
    on LMAC) to reduce the number of transceiver state switches and hence the energy
    wasted in preamble transmissions. Although the protocol uses TDMA to give nodes
    in the wireless network the opportunity to communicate collision free, the network
    is self-organizing in terms of time slot assignment and synchronization. The protocol
    has been compared to SMAC and EMACs by simulation. The LMAC protocol is able to
    extend the network lifetime by a factor 2.4 and 3.8, compared to EMACs and SMAC,
    respectively. 2.1.6. Ambient Studio [24] Ambient Studio is the generic software
    used for deployment and configuration of the network system, data collection and
    data dissemination. It builds strongly on the generic DDI and addresses all resources
    in the network using DDI. Extensive tools are available for configuration, remotely
    upgrading nodes, network debugging, etc. Ambient Studio has been used in this
    study to install the network, and to verify its functionality. The wireless sensor
    network can be connected through Ambient Studio with multiple databases (ODBC)
    in order to store measurement data. Database queries can be edited in XML which
    is used by Ambient Studio to parse the raw measurement data. The same XML file
    is used for visualization and configuration of the sensor network in Ambient Studio.
    2.2. Field Installation and Testing [25] An extensive field test of the wireless
    sensor network was started in October 2007 at golf course Almkreek (www.golfpark-almkreek.nl)
    located near Almkerk in the central part of Netherlands, close to the town of
    Gorinchem. The golf course covers approximately 100 ha and has, among other things,
    an 18-hole course consisting of a mixture of push-up and sand greens, constructed
    using on-site clayey soil and sand brought in from elsewhere, respectively. The
    field test is still ongoing and being used for further fine tuning and improvement
    of the overall methodology. [26] On 4 October 2007, the following items were installed:
    (1) one probe node on each of the 18 greens of the golf course, (2) 24 infrastructure
    nodes, (3) one gateway, with a high-gain antenna, and (4) a network PC for data
    transmission to a server. The average distance between the below ground probe
    nodes and first aboveground infrastructure node was 28 m, with a minimum of 6
    m for green 18 and a maximum distance of 62 m for green 16. The probe nodes have
    been installed at fixed positions in the green, basically at a certain distance
    between two sprinklers surrounding each of the greens. [27] After installation
    of all network components, including the gateway, use was made of the customer
    installation software package in order to (1) check the reachability of the different
    probe nodes and infrastructure nodes in the network, (2) determine the strength
    of the transmission between the separate network components, and (3) view the
    data routing paths across the network to the gateway. 3. Results 3.1. Network
    Installation and Aerial Coverage [28] Before installing the network components
    on golf course Almkreek, all probe nodes and infrastructure nodes were quality
    checked using the Ambient Studio software. After checking the performance of the
    network components, including transmission strength, two activities were undertaken
    simultaneously: (1) installation of the gateway in the golf course office and
    (2) installation of one probe node in each of the greens and one infrastructure
    node in the direct surroundings of each green. The gateway installation procedure
    is easy and can be performed by a single experienced person in approximately 30
    min. Installing the probe nodes and infrastructure nodes on the greens was done
    by a team of two other people, and took around 3 to 4 h in total. In general,
    the infrastructure nodes were installed at an approximate height of 1.5 m above
    the soil surface and attached to tree trunks or branches in the surroundings of
    the greens. [29] Thereafter, connection quality and data pathways between the
    probe nodes, infrastructure nodes, and the gateway were evaluated using the Ambient
    Studio software. If certain probe nodes were not able to transfer their data to
    the gateway node easily, extra infrastructure nodes were placed at strategic positions
    on the golf course in order to ensure smooth connecting pathways between all individual
    network components. This procedure was repeated until the network obtained full
    functionality. Within 1 day, the total installation was successfully completed.
    [30] The left-hand side of Figure 2 shows the direct connection performance between
    the individual infrastructure nodes and the gateway after installation on the
    golf course. It is clearly visible that most infrastructure nodes are able to
    send data to the gateway without even using neighboring nodes. This suggests that
    the average transmission range of the infrastructure nodes is far above the indicated
    250 m, and is more likely to be in the range of 1000–1500 m instead. The actual
    transmission range in the network varies per infrastructure node depending on
    interfering landscape elements like wooded areas, buildings and/or other obstacles.
    Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Layout of implemented wireless network
    on golf course Almkreek, Netherlands, with (left) a screen dump of Ambient Studio
    showing that after field installation most of the infrastructure nodes can reach
    the gateway station directly without using neighboring infrastructure nodes and
    (right) a screen dump of network communication performance on an arbitrary day
    during the experimental period (green, yellow, and red lines represent good, moderate,
    and insufficient/sporadic connections, respectively). [31] The right-hand side
    of Figure 2 shows an example of the overall network performance at a certain moment
    during the field trial. It shows that there are a large number of transmission
    paths within the network. This is desired so the nodes are able to choose a good
    path, under all conditions. For example, during rainy periods radio range might
    decrease so a path with more hops will be chosen. If, for whatever reason, an
    infrastructure node stops functioning, other nodes are able to choose alternative
    paths to the gateway. 3.2. Soil Moisture Content Behavior [32] Measurements of
    soil moisture content at the 18 greens started on 4 October 2007. As indicated
    earlier, measurement frequency was set on a 15 min time interval. Per day, 96
    soil moisture content measurements were performed by each of the sensors. By March
    2008, roughly 17,000 soil moisture recordings were obtained for each sensor. [33]
    As an example of the data collected, Figure 3 shows the measured soil moisture
    contents at two depths for six of the eighteen greens during the period October
    2007 to March 2008. Soil moisture contents were calculated with the standard calibration
    curve provided by Decagon. Also depicted in Figure 3 are the results obtained
    on hole 16, which is the hole where the distance between the buried probe node
    and nearest aboveground infrastructure node is the largest (62 m). Figure 3 Open
    in figure viewer PowerPoint Soil moisture content measurements for six greens
    retrieved by the wireless underground network system, including recorded daily
    rainfall amounts and average air temperatures (data from a nearby meteorological
    station). Note that for each green per soil depth, around 17,000 soil moisture
    recordings were obtained between October 2007 and March 2008. [34] It is obvious
    from the measurements that at all sites and depths, soil moisture contents are
    very responsive to the recorded rainfall, which is depicted at the top of the
    diagrams in Figure 3 as well. In general, sensors at 4 cm depth respond slightly
    quicker and more distinctly than the ones at 10 cm depth. Furthermore, differences
    can be observed between the different greens. In particular, green 16 appears
    to be much drier than the others. This is in accordance with observations and
    experiences of the head greenkeeper who indicated that certain greens on the golf
    course, including green 16, are susceptible to drought and sometimes very difficult
    to (re)wet. By contrast, green 10 is one of the wettest in the examples shown,
    which matches observations that this green exhibits regular problems related to
    waterlogging, compaction and thatch formation. [35] As a further example, Figure
    4 shows detailed information on soil moisture content behavior for a 4-day period
    at the end of October beginning of November 2007 for six other greens on the golf
    course. In this period, a few rain showers were recorded, each several mm in total.
    Response to rainfall differs per green and depth. Green 15 is a dry one, similar
    to green 16 discussed earlier, and green 7 is relatively wet compared to the others
    shown in Figure 4. Figure 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Soil moisture content
    behavior in six other greens during a 4-day period with a few small rain events.
    Note that infiltration behavior differs per green, as well as the degree of wetness/dryness
    of the greens. [36] In addition to precipitation and measured soil water contents
    versus time, Figure 3 shows the average daily air temperature for this entire
    period as well. It can be seen clearly that the drop in soil moisture content
    values in the second half of December is directly related to temperatures dropping
    below 0°C. A detailed view of this process is provided in Figure 5. After air
    temperatures rise above 0°C, it takes another 3–4 days before the EC-5 recordings
    show normal values again. Generally, it can be stated that within this first field
    experiment external influences like rain, temperature and humidity are not interfering
    with data retrieval and network performance to any notable degree. Figure 5 Open
    in figure viewer PowerPoint Effect of cold weather on soil moisture content recordings.
    Note that after the air temperature rises back above 0°C it takes another 3–4
    days before recorded soil moisture contents are back to their original values
    as observed before the start of the period with frost. 3.3. Communication Performance
    [37] Overall communication between network components functioned well during the
    entire experimental period, and data were retrieved securely and accurately. However,
    in analyzing the data streams across the entire network in detail, one important
    observation was made. Figure 6 shows the amount of data received per day by the
    gateway and PC for a series of greens. When communication over the network is
    perfectly streamlined and working to expectations, 96 data packages per green
    should be delivered to the gateway and transferred to the PC and Web server. Figure
    6 shows that generally this is the case, however starting from around the middle
    of December several of the probe nodes start to send data packages to the aboveground
    infrastructure node network sometimes more than once. In exceptional cases, 3
    to almost 4 times the required number of data packages were delivered to the gateway.
    As previously noted, the network communication protocol is programmed in such
    a way that an infrastructure node receiving a data package from a buried probe
    node, should send an acknowledgment of receipt to the respective probe node. Apparently,
    receipt of these acknowledgments by the respective probe nodes did not always
    occur, causing the probe node to send the same data package again until it finally
    received a confirmation from the infrastructure node. Further analysis revealed
    that the distance between buried probe nodes and the nearest aboveground infrastructure
    node plays a role in this process: the larger the distance, the more repeated
    messages were found. It is clear that from a technological point of view, the
    network communication from aboveground infrastructure nodes back to the buried
    probe nodes needs further improvement, perhaps by optimizing the antenna position
    spatially or by using a different type of antenna or transmitting frequency. This
    point will receive the required attention during the further development and testing
    of this new wireless underground network system. Figure 6 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint Number of data packages received per day for six different greens.
    Under ideal conditions, 96 data packages should be transferred over the wireless
    network to the gateway per day per green. Note that sometimes more data packages
    are received by the gateway. This is because of suboptimal communication between
    the aboveground infrastructure node and buried probe node (acknowledgment of receipt
    messages from infrastructure nodes are not always received by buried probe nodes,
    leading to repeated sending of the same data packages by probe nodes). 4. Conclusions
    [38] To conclude, initial results indicate that the wireless underground network
    system to continuously monitor soil water contents at different locations and
    soil depths across an 18 hole golf course area is performing well, and that measurement
    data are being retrieved as expected. This innovative measurement system opens
    a new range of possible applications from agriculture to research to environmental
    monitoring and beyond. Main advantages of the system as described and presented
    in this paper are that (1) it is based on combining state-of-the-art knowledge
    on soil physics, electronics and computer sciences; (2) use has been made of commercially
    available products and technologies to assemble the new wireless underground network
    system; (3) installation of the wireless network system is fast and use is easy;
    (4) data retrieval potentials are enormous; (5) monitoring information over large
    spatial scales can be obtained in (near) real-time mode and made accessible to
    end user groups instantaneously using the Web interface; (6) related costs are
    reasonable; and (7) other type of sensors can be connected to the system also,
    offering wide potentials for application. [39] Apart from certain minor technological
    aspects requiring some improvement, it is expected that this system can be made
    available to other external users soon. Additionally, a second field trial with
    the wireless underground network system will be initiated during 2008, using the
    digital Decagon ECH2O-TE sensors to continuously monitor soil moisture, temperature
    and electrical conductivity simultaneously. Recently, these new generation Decagon
    sensors have been extensively tested by Kizito et al. [2008]. It is expected that
    results of this second field trial will be released sometime in 2009. Acknowledgments

    Abstract: Digitalization has impacted agricultural and food production systems,\
    \ and makes applica-\ntion of technologies and advanced data processing techniques\
    \ in agricultural ﬁeld possible. Digital\nfarming aims to use available information\
    \ from agricultural assets to solve several existing challenges\nfor addressing\
    \ food security, climate protection, and resource management. However, the agricultural\n\
    sector is complex, dynamic, and requires sophisticated management systems. The\
    \ digital approaches\nare expected to provide more optimization and further decision-making\
    \ supports. Digital twin in\nagriculture is a virtual representation of a farm\
    \ with great potential for enhancing productivity and\nefﬁciency while declining\
    \ energy usage and losses. This review describes the state-of-the-art of\ndigital\
    \ twin concepts along with different digital technologies and techniques in agricultural\
    \ con-\ntexts. It presents a general framework of digital twins in soil, irrigation,\
    \ robotics, farm machineries,\nand food post-harvest processing in agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld. Data recording, modeling including artiﬁcial\nintelligence, big data,\
    \ simulation, analysis, prediction, and communication aspects (e.g., Internet\n\
    of Things, wireless technologies) of digital twin in agriculture are discussed.\
    \ Digital twin systems\ncan support farmers as a next generation of digitalization\
    \ paradigm by continuous and real-time\nmonitoring of physical world (farm) and\
    \ updating the state of virtual world.\nKeywords: digital twin; digitalization;\
    \ digital farming; farm management; smart farming\n1. Introduction\nOne of the\
    \ main global challenges is how to ensure food security for the world’s\ngrowing\
    \ population whilst ensuring long-term sustainable development. According to the\n\
    Food and Agriculture Organization, agricultural and food productions will need\
    \ to grow\nto feed the world population, which will reach around 10 billion by\
    \ 2050 [1]. Due to the\nincrease in world population and market demand for higher\
    \ product quantity and quality\nstandards, the issue of food security, sustainability,\
    \ productivity, and proﬁtability becomes\nmore important. Furthermore, the economic\
    \ pressure on the agricultural sector, labor,\nenvironmental, and climate change\
    \ issues are increasing [2,3]. Therefore, the enhancement\nof efﬁciency through\
    \ effective integrated smart technologies and techniques has been\nwidely considered\
    \ in recent years.\nIn this context, digital agriculture (also known as smart\
    \ farming or smart agriculture)\ntools can support the deeper understanding of\
    \ interrelations within the agricultural pro-\nduction system and the consequent\
    \ effects on the performance of farm production while\nbalancing human health\
    \ and well-being, social and environmental aspects, and sustain-\nability associated\
    \ with agricultural system [4–6]. Due to advances in data generation, data\nprocessing\
    \ and human-computer interactions, digital farming has progressed in recent\n\
    years [7]. One of the main features of digitalization in agriculture is the introduction\
    \ of inno-\nvative Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Internet of\
    \ Things (IoT), big data\nanalytics and interpretation techniques, machine learning\
    \ and Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI).\nData acquisition and analysis in digital farming\
    \ by means of smart technologies are\nsupporting complex decision-making approaches\
    \ [8,9]. They enhance ﬁnal productivity,\nSensors 2022, 22, 498. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22020498\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n2 of 16\nreduce costs,\
    \ and optimize the decision-making process. Furthermore, ICT tools present\nadvantages\
    \ for on-farm management, efﬁciency, quality control, and the food supply chain\n\
    as well as decision support tools [10]. The AI and big data support better and\
    \ precise\nfarm monitoring, data acquisition and analytics, improve information\
    \ extraction from\nsensors as well as farm management [11]. For instance, crop\
    \ health and productivity can\nbe monitored and controlled using advanced AI and\
    \ deep learning techniques [12]. Data-\ndriven approaches augment on-farm decision-making\
    \ capabilities, improve crop yield,\nreduce losses, and therefore, beneﬁt farmers.\
    \ The IoT and wireless technologies enable\nreal-time data transferring and monitoring\
    \ in digital farming [13,14]. The IoT, along with\ncloud computing systems, can\
    \ facilitate communication between software platforms and\nsensors, pieces of\
    \ machinery, crops, and animals in digital farming. However, by increasing\nthe\
    \ number of sensors and generating large amounts of data in digital farming could\
    \ cause\nhigh load on the cloud server and reduce the response speed [15]. In\
    \ this context, in may\nbe impractical to always store and process data in the\
    \ cloud systems [16]. An alternative\ntechnology which has been recently introduced\
    \ to the smart farming is edge-computing\nthat enables computation at the edge\
    \ of the network [17]. It helps to reduce network load\nand supports real-time\
    \ data processing in agricultural ﬁelds. Furthermore, cyber-physical\nsystems\
    \ have been introduced through smart farming systems to develop hardware and\n\
    software, improve adaptability, and safety and security of computer-based algorithms\n\
    and systems [18]. It enables adaptability, practicality, security, and safety\
    \ of collected\ninformation in agricultural ﬁeld e.g., climate, irrigation, soil,\
    \ nutrition, and yield for\nbetter management.\nAccording to ref. [19], digital\
    \ farming approaches can provide farmers with useful\ninformation about (I) the\
    \ use of fertilizers, chemicals, seeds, and irrigation management\nstrategies,\
    \ (II) the environment protection, (III) pest, climate, and crop monitoring man-\n\
    agement solutions, (IV) market demands and business conditions. However, agricultural\n\
    production systems are complex, dynamic, and require sophisticated management\
    \ [20].\nDigitalization approaches are expected to provide more monitoring, data\
    \ analysis and\noptimization capabilities, and further decision-making supports.\n\
    To enhance the efﬁciency of these systems, an emerging paradigm has been proposed\n\
    and implemented in digital agriculture, that is, digital twin. The digital twin\
    \ was ﬁrstly\npresented by NASA for monitoring of spacecraft behavior and can\
    \ be deﬁned as a virtual\nor digital representation of physical systems to simulate\
    \ the behavior of the physical\nsystem [21,22]. There are different deﬁnitions\
    \ for digital twin available in the literature\nwhich have been reviewed by [23–25].\
    \ Based on the reported deﬁnitions, the component\nof digital twin can be characterized\
    \ by physical and virtual objects, as well as a set of\nconnections between physical\
    \ and digital assets [26].\nThe physical system or physical world in agriculture\
    \ is a complex and dynamic\nenvironment and includes basic information and features\
    \ of the object or device such\nas shape, position, cooler, material, and live\
    \ objects [27]. The physical system is one\nof the key components, and a digital\
    \ twin without a physical world is a model [28],\nand system boundaries of a digital\
    \ twin are identiﬁed based on the real physical world [29].\nThe physical system\
    \ can be a single component of an object or the whole object with sub-\ncomponents\
    \ located in a physical environment [28]. The physical world in agriculture can\n\
    be an animal itself or located in a farm including building, feeding strategies,\
    \ number of\nanimals [30], or a crop with different soil, climate, and irrigation\
    \ conditions [22], robots\nand agricultural pieces of machinery, e.g., tractors,\
    \ harvesters and fertilizers, as well as\noperators. The physical world can include\
    \ a whole object (e.g., whole machine) or sub-part\nof the object, or a single\
    \ asset of the object connected with other objects. In an agricultural\ncontext,\
    \ the physical system may be some aspects of the crop, soil, and irrigation systems,\n\
    or animal body. The physical world requires measurement technologies and sensors\
    \ to\ncollect and receive data from the physical object. Examples of digital twins\
    \ in smart\nagriculture include optical sensors for plant canopy and disease [31,32],\
    \ soil and weather\nsensors for crop [33], barn sensors such as temperature, humidity,\
    \ ammonia for animals [34],\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n3 of 16\nGlobal Positioning\
    \ System (GPS) and Real-Time Kinematic-Global Navigation Satellite for\ntracking\
    \ of agricultural robots [35], and food supply chain.\nThe connection between\
    \ physical and virtual worlds depends on the developed digital\ntwin. This component\
    \ enables data transmission between virtual and physical systems.\nIt interprets\
    \ the collected data from the physical system and updates the state of the\nvirtual\
    \ system, and transfers feedbacks from the virtual system to the physical world\
    \ [25].\nThe connection components can be varied depending on the source, type\
    \ and volume of\ndata, data transfer rate and speed, as well as the minimum delay\
    \ between data acquisition\nand feedbacks. Wireless and IoT techniques have been\
    \ used in digital twins of agricultural\nconcepts to connect between physical\
    \ and virtual worlds (such as [34,36,37]).\nThe models and data of the physical\
    \ world are represented in a virtual system.\nThe virtual world may also include\
    \ different processing and simulation concepts, software,\nmachine learning, data\
    \ mining, and AI models. In this context, data processing and analyt-\nics by\
    \ means of AI techniques to support decision-making and feedback to the physical\n\
    system were suggested by some researchers [38,39]. The virtual twin may simulate\
    \ and\ncontrol the physical system, optimize a process, and predict unseen issues\
    \ in the physical\nsystem. For example, an application layer of a digital twin\
    \ reported by [22] provides\nreal-time monitoring of weeds, crop growth, and expected\
    \ yield via cloud dashboards for\nfarmers. A schematic of the digital twin concept\

    \ and evaluation of soil quality to sustain plant productivity is the basis of\n\
    land-use strategies in agricultural farms [48]. Crop health and productivity depends\
    \ on\nthe quality and properties of the soil. More detailed information about\
    \ the agricultural\nsoil may reduce the potential use of chemical fertilizer and\
    \ pesticide dosages, therefore\nimproving the underground water, protecting the\
    \ environment and human health. It also\nsupports deﬁning plant density in a more\
    \ efﬁcient way. Digital technologies are supporting\nscientists to better understand\
    \ and study soil in agriculture. Soil monitoring sensors such\nas moisture, temperature,\
    \ organic matter, and soil pollutant sensors are playing critical\nroles in digital\
    \ agriculture [49]. For instance, soil moisture information can be used to\nassess\
    \ irrigation efﬁciency in agricultural ﬁelds [50]. Furthermore, to support the\
    \ decision-\nmaking process of smart farming, digital soil mapping is an essential\
    \ paradigm that can be\ndeﬁned as spatial soil information based on ﬁeld and laboratory\
    \ investigations coupled\nwith soil inference systems [51]. Digital soil assessment\
    \ approaches have a direct impact on\ncrop yield and performance by identifying\
    \ zones that may cause low crop yield. Digital\nalternative methodologies for\
    \ soil survey and identifying key soil characteristics could\nhave the possibility\
    \ to quantify the trend of agricultural soil conditions [52].\nThe advancement\
    \ of knowledge and technology (e.g., wireless sensors, IoT, AI) in\ndigital agriculture\
    \ could lead to digital twin paradigms of soil in agriculture. The recent\ndevelopment\
    \ of digital soil mapping techniques may support digital twins by digital\nrepresentation\
    \ of knowledge obtained from the soil in virtual entrainment [53]. For in-\nstance,\
    \ digital soil mapping could be used to describe soil variation in digital twins\
    \ using\ninformation from complex soil variation at a speciﬁc depth, time, and\
    \ special locations [52].\nAdditionally, the decision about crop management depends\
    \ directly on the crop water\nrequirements, soil properties, and availability\
    \ of water. In order to manage soil and crop\nrequirements in smart farming, digital\
    \ technologies have been used to meet the requirement\nof smart or precise water\
    \ management strategies. Wireless system networks, IoT, edge-\ncomputing, local\
    \ weather-based controllers, and soil sensors are some of the digital tools\n\
    based on smart irrigation systems. The mentioned tools can be used in the digital\
    \ twin of\nsoil and irrigation systems. For example, ref. [37] developed a digital\
    \ twin concept for smart\nwater management in the agricultural domain. Information\
    \ of air and ground temperature,\nand humidity sensors, soil moisture, and ambient\
    \ light as well as geospatial position\nsensors were collected. An IoT system\
    \ was used to connect the cloud and the physical\nsystem. A virtual environment\
    \ including decision-making tools and models was designed\nto inform the data\
    \ collected by connection device (the IoT system) and to send feedback\nto the\
    \ physical system. They also presented a digital twin system architecture including\n\
    monitoring devices (i.e., soil probe, weather information, irrigation system,\
    \ machines,\nand other equipment) in a physical system (farm) with could serve\
    \ as a connection between\nthe physical and virtual systems to visualize satellite\
    \ and drone images.\nIn another study, to evaluate and forecast plants’ irrigation\
    \ requirements, and support\nirrigation and water distribution planning, a digital\
    \ twin for a smart water management\nsystem was developed by [54]. Data of the\
    \ physical world (agriculture ﬁeld) such as\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n5 of 16\n\
    weather, fertilizer, and soil type as well as information from developed models\
    \ that simulate\nthe behavior of soil and crops were considered as input data\
    \ for the digital twin. The digital\ntwin concept also consisted of a Soil Agent\
    \ (includes hydrological models and soil data),\nCrop Agent (includes crop models\
    \ and evaporation data), and a Field Avatar, which is a\ndigital representation\
    \ of the ﬁeld such as geological models and weather data [54]. In their\ndeveloped\
    \ digital twin concept, the information from Soil Avatar and Crop Avatar feed\n\
    into the Field Avatar, and an IoT system was used for data transformation and\
    \ connection\nbetween the physical and virtual worlds.\nDue to increase in world\
    \ population, water and energy management, storage, and proper\ndistribution of\
    \ water become more essential for water users in agricultural sectors, which can\n\
    be managed through a collective irrigation system [55]. A digital twin of water\
    \ systems\ncoupled with big data can reduce risk and uncertainty of water management,\
    \ explore\nconsumption patterns, and optimize operation planning [56]. Furthermore,\
    \ in a collective\nirrigation system, improvement of water efﬁciency could help\
    \ to reduce water losses. In this\ncontext, a digital twin concept was created\
    \ using ﬁeld and laboratory tests of a collective\nirrigation system network to\
    \ evaluate energy, pumping facilities, water losses and water use\nefﬁciencies\
    \ [57]. The developed digital twin methodology was based on information from\n\
    the physical system, i.e., infrastructure data, acquired information through telemetry,\
    \ data\nanalytics from laboratory tests and ﬁeld measurements, IoT data transferring\
    \ as connection,\nenergy balance, water balance, and hydraulic model in the virtual\
    \ system. It was found\nthat the digital twin of the irrigation management system\
    \ made it possible to understand\nsystem processes, maintenance, and management\
    \ strategies [57].\nA digital twin of soil and irrigation systems in smart farming\
    \ enables digital repre-\nsentation of information from agricultural soil, and\
    \ provides prediction and fundamental\nunderstanding of water requirement and\
    \ soil components for crop farming. Exchanging\ninformation from the soil as a\
    \ physical system to a virtual system using IoT, cloud, fog,\nand edge-computing\
    \ technologies in digital twin may allow evaluating the state of soil and\nirrigation\
    \ systems. In particular, the edge-computing technique that saves and performs\n\
    the data processing near the soil monitoring and irrigation devices can improve\
    \ the perfor-\nmance and overcome issues of cloud-based system in digital twin\
    \ concepts. Furthermore,\nit could offer different irrigation recommendations\
    \ based on crop requirements which are\nnot solved yet by the researchers.\n3.\
    \ Digital Twin in Crop Production\nThe use of digital and ICT tools in crop production\
    \ technologies, in particular agri-\ncultural machineries, e.g., tractors, combine\
    \ harvesters, fertilizers, and sprayers, plays an\nimportant role in the improvement\
    \ of overall efﬁciency by reducing the cost of fuel, fertiliz-\ners, human labor,\
    \ and parameters which affect production efﬁciency and sustainability [58].\n\
    Digitalization has modernized agricultural machinery application and management\
    \ policies\nusing collected information and advanced data analytics approaches.\
    \ It allows to optimize\nthe performance and enhance the use of advanced tools\
    \ in manufacturing. For instance,\nbased on the European Agricultural Machinery\
    \ Association, a digital farm machine should\nbe able to assist and support drivers\
    \ by sending and receiving data via sensors and ICT\ntools, enable the best and\
    \ optimal use of machinery, and the technology should facilitate\nthe automated\
    \ operation of the devices [59]. The application of AI, big data analytics,\n\
    and wireless and IoT technologies have led to signiﬁcant changes in farm technology\
    \ roles\ntowards the development of autonomous systems. The role of agricultural\
    \ machinery in\nthe implementation of digital agriculture was stated by [58] as\
    \ data collected from sensors\nmounted on typical and autonomous agricultural\
    \ machinery and transferred via an IoT\nplatform. Then, the information was analyzed\
    \ by data analytics such as AI, fuzzy logic,\nand big data analysis to support\
    \ farmers, consumers, and markets [58]. In this context,\ncombining digital tools\
    \ with autonomous machines and robots could help farmers to do\nmore effective\
    \ practices and improve the quality of products [60]. Nowadays, with ad-\nvancements\
    \ in digital technology, the real-time visualization of smart farm equipment\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 498\n6 of 16\nconditions is possible through digital twin approaches\
    \ [40]. It allows contact to the system\n(e.g., machinery and robots), simulates\
    \ the condition of the system, and monitors the\nbehavior and operation as well\
    \ as the maintenance situation of the machines (Figure 2).\n \ntransferred via\
    \ an IoT platform. Then, the information was analyzed by data analytics \nsuch\
    \ as AI, fuzzy logic, and big data analysis to support farmers, consumers, and\
    \ markets \n[58]. In this context, combining digital tools with autonomous machines\
    \ and robots could \nhelp farmers to do more effective practices and improve the\
    \ quality of products [60]. Now-\nadays, with advancements in digital technology,\
    \ the real-time visualization of smart farm \nequipment conditions is possible\
    \ through digital twin approaches [40]. It allows contact \nto the system (e.g.,\
    \ machinery and robots), simulates the condition of the system, and \nmonitors\
    \ the behavior and operation as well as the maintenance situation of the machines\
    \ \n(Figure 2).  \n \nFigure 2. An architecture of the digital twin concept for\
    \ crop production technology. \nDigital twin in design and manufacturing of products\
    \ (e.g., farm machinery) requires \n(I) geometric (e.g., size, shape) and physical\
    \ properties of an object, (II) in the detailed \ninformation of the product which\

    \ to model, design, simulate, and develop agricultural machinery that \nwould\
    \ yield more productive machines in terms of energy and power efficiencies. For\
    \ \ninstance, it was shown that overall energy consumption of machinery could\
    \ be modeled \nin digital twin concepts, and the effect of different factors on\
    \ energy consumption can also \nbe explored there [62]. In the agricultural context,\
    \ ref. [40] reported that a commercially \navailable digital twin platform for\
    \ agricultural machinery is able to track the machines in \nreal-time, monitor\
    \ the energy consumption, economic efficiency of crop management, and \ntrajectories\

    \ been \nreported that using digital twins could potentially impact the training\

    the human-robot interactive behaviors using a digital twin platform. Their developed\n\
    digital twin helps to improve operational productivity and comfort. In another\
    \ study,\na digital twin approach was proposed to assist the remote programming\
    \ of a robot [66].\nThe developed digital twin system consists of a robot (as\
    \ a physical object), and a gaming\nplatform (as a virtual system) which was able\
    \ to observe the motion of the robot, ease\nprogramming for complex environments\
    \ as well as introduce a remote operating system\nfor communication across different\
    \ platforms [66]. In the agricultural context, an approach\nwas recommended by\
    \ [35] that the development of a digital twin paradigm for agricultural\nrobots\
    \ may improve predictive emulation of the vehicles, operational scheduling, digital-\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 498\n7 of 16\nization, economic, environmental, and social sustainability\
    \ in agriculture. Furthermore,\nthe digital twin paradigm makes it possible to\
    \ overcome common challenges in the control\nof robot components in the agriculture\
    \ ﬁeld. In this context, a research group demonstrated\nthe possibility of a digital\
    \ twin concept for a desktop version of an agricultural robot [67] to\ncontrol\
    \ the motor and indoor localization capabilities of the robot. Besides, the digital\
    \ twin\nconcept was used to predict movement and monitor the safety mechanism\
    \ of the robot [67].\nHowever, their developed digital twin concept needs different\
    \ kinds of calibrations to be\napplicable in different environmental conditions.\n\
    In another study, to simulate complexity of the crop production process, variability\
    \ of\nplant, soil, environment, and technologies in the agricultural ﬁeld, digital\
    \ twin concepts\nwere developed [68]. Three ﬁeld robots for different agricultural\
    \ applications were used to\ndevelop different digital twin concepts and optimize\
    \ sensor-based autonomous navigation.\nIt is reported that the developed concepts\
    \ could provide considerable information in prepar-\ning ﬁeld experiments, and\
    \ better evaluation for the use and positioning of sensor systems\ntowards demonstrating\
    \ and implementation of the developed robotic technologies [68].\nIntegration\
    \ of the digital twin systems with technologies and management strategies\nin\
    \ crop production can provide a new phenomenon for digitalization in agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld.\nManagement strategies can be improved and optimized by providing reliable\
    \ forecasts of\nthe key parameters in digital twins [69]. The digital twin systems\
    \ can not only act as a man-\nagement system, but it may also be used to revolutionize\
    \ agricultural farm management\nstrategies [40]. For instance, a digital twin\
    \ concept was applied in a greenhouse to discover,\nanalyze, and extract behavior\
    \ of farmers [70]. Sensor data were analyzed using deep learn-\ning techniques\
    \ to establish decision-making models to replicate expert famers’ experience\n\
    for transferring to young farmers. It was found that the developed digital twin\
    \ module\ncould improve control and management strategies in crop farming [70].\
    \ In this context,\nthe use of distributed architecture in digital twin may increase\
    \ efﬁciency and reliability\nof the module by proper resource handling [71]. A\
    \ distributed digital twin concept was\ndeveloped to handle resources over different\
    \ stakeholders and platforms in agricultural\nlandscape [72]. It consists of different\
    \ components, i.e., stakeholders, applications in agri-\nculture and farm management,\
    \ sensor data, analytics and simulation tools, virtual model,\nIoT, and resource\
    \ registry which makes interoperable and cross-scale management possible\nin agricultural\
    \ landscape [71].\nIn addition, the use of digital twin system as a decision support\
    \ system can beneﬁt and\nbe adopted for crop farming applications, and optimization\
    \ of products and farm system\nperformance. A digital twin model was implemented\
    \ by [36] in sustainable agriculture\nfor monitoring and control of product qualities,\
    \ adjustment of environmental conditions,\nidentiﬁcation of forecasting, and decision\
    \ support scenarios. In addition, a novel approach\nbased on digital twin paradigms\
    \ was developed to forecast yield, vegetation quality,\nand duration of plant\
    \ development [33]. Consequently, the quality of crop production\ncould be improved\
    \ due to detailed analysis and control of plant growth, and the efﬁciency\nof\
    \ farms could be improved due to automation of decision support processes through\n\
    the developed digital twin concept. Digital twin along with forecasting models\
    \ were able\nto provide feedback to farmers for a better decision-making scenario\
    \ in a reported study\nby [73]. Their proposed digital twin system consists of\
    \ a monitoring system to collect\nenvironmental condition data from an underground\
    \ farm, as well as data analysis and\nmodeling techniques to identify key parameters,\
    \ critical trends, and forecast operational\nscenarios. Furthermore, digital twin\
    \ was able to optimize productivity of crops in a\ngreenhouse environment through\
    \ climate control strategies and treatments related to\ncrop management [74].\n\
    Information from crop production machineries (e.g., tractors, harvesters, robots)\
    \ have\nbeen used in smart farming to optimize the performance and efﬁciency,\
    \ and reduce the fuel\nand energy consumption. However, the digital twin concepts\
    \ collect real-time data from\nthe devices and characterize the states of the\
    \ physical object continuously. This capability\nmakes it possible to predict\
    \ and prescribe solutions using the collected information from\nSensors 2022,\
    \ 22, 498\n8 of 16\nthe farm machineries. Hence, big data analytics coupled with\
    \ AI models are able to detect\nfailures in the machines before or in the early\
    \ stage of when breakdowns happen. In this\ncontext, the use of state-of-the-art\
    \ edge-computing systems may reduce latency by the\nlimited amount of transmitted\
    \ data and provide information from the crop production\nmachineries such as autonomous\
    \ robot, harvesters, and tractors to the digital twin concepts.\nThe digital twin\
    \ paradigm in crop farming can change production productivity, farm man-\nagement,\
    \ and sustainability at farm level. Advanced statistical models, machine learning\n\
    and data analytic approaches can provide farmers with more precise information\
    \ to make\nbetter decisions that were not possible previously. Based on the past\
    \ (historical) and current\ncontinuous knowledge from crop (sensors deployed at\
    \ farm) and environment data, the dig-\nital twin systems provide information\
    \ about future states of the farm, and offer solutions\nfor turning the collected\
    \ information into useful and actionable on-farm knowledge.\n4. Digital Twin in\
    \ Post-Harvest Process\nPost-harvest process is a stage of agricultural products\
    \ after harvesting until consum-\ning the products, which may include transportation,\
    \ drying, cooling, storage, and market-\ning. Through digital farming approaches,\
    \ the post-harvest processes could beneﬁt from loss\nreduction, improvement of\
    \ monitoring and optimization of food processing, storage condi-\ntions, marketing,\
    \ and transportation. Digital solutions allow monitoring real-time agri-food\n\
    supply chain to increase robustness and resilience of the chain [75], and lower\
    \ food waste\nand losses. The IoT platform supports the reduction of food losses\
    \ in post-harvest pro-\ncessing [76], and tracking of the product through the\
    \ food supply chain. To achieve food\nsecurity AI and big data analytics enable\
    \ data processing, optimization, and management\nin food and crop post-harvest\
    \ stages [77], also reducing waste and improving overall prof-\nitability [78].\
    \ The ICT offers solutions to monitor and control quality criteria of food and\n\
    agricultural products during post-harvest processing [43]. However, different\
    \ environmen-\ntal conditions, processing factors, and dynamic features of agricultural\
    \ product (e.g., shape,\nsize), environmental parameters (e.g., temperature, humidity),\
    \ handling, transportation,\nand storage of the products inﬂuence the quality\
    \ of post-harvest process [79].\nTo overcome these issues and increase the efﬁciency\
    \ of the system, digital twin ap-\nproaches have been used in post-harvest processing\
    \ to continuously monitor the products\nand update the processing stages [80].\
    \ Digital twins, as an expanding family of digital\nfarming could strengthen agri-food\
    \ systems, affect knowledge and skills of farm manage-\nment [44]. Digital twin\
    \ in post-harvest processes can be deﬁned as a digital representation\nof harvested\
    \ agricultural products based on the information collected from the products.\n\
    In this context, ref. [42] reported the digital twin concept of food processing\
    \ may include:\n(I) data collected from a physical system (food process operation)\
    \ by means of sensors that\nmeasure properties and variables of products and environmental\
    \ parameters, (II) an IoT\nplatform to provide sensor communication, data storage\
    \ and big data analytics, high-\nperformance computing, and link to the digital\
    \ twin assets, (III) a simulation platform that\nuses input data from physical\
    \ system for optimization, testing and validation of models,\nand provides decision\
    \ supports in the virtual world. In order to beneﬁt food process-\ning by developing\
    \ digital twin models, it is important to include accurate information\nrepresenting\
    \ production processes of the product, e.g., equipment, labor, and to create\n\
    realistic models with all existing boundaries and barriers [81]. In a study reported\
    \ by [82],\na digital twin of mango fruit was developed to simulate and qualify\
    \ thermal and associ-\nated bio-chemical behavior of the fruit through a post-harvest\
    \ supply chain. In order to\ndevelop the digital twin concept, environmental air\
    \ temperature as input was considered,\nand the actual supply chain conditions\
    \ were mimicked within mechanistic ﬁnite element\nmodels [82]. Moreover, the impact\
    \ of higher air speed on storage life, cold chain length,\nand delivery air temperature\
    \ on the fruit quality were considered in the digital twin. It was\nreported that\
    \ the digital twin allows to monitor and predict temperature-dependent fruit\n\
    quality losses, improve refrigeration and logistic processes, consequently, it\
    \ can reduce\nfood losses [82]. Furthermore, it is reported that the digital twin\
    \ can help horticultural\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n9 of 16\nproducts along with\
    \ the post-harvest life, and can be used to forecast the shelf-life of\nagricultural\
    \ products through the cold chain [45]. It can support food consumers as well\n\
    as food business owners for tracking of the products, logistics, and marketing\
    \ decisions;\nhowever, the existing digital twin concept needs to be enhanced\
    \ by considering more bio-\nchemical and physical features [45]. Ref. [83] proposed\
    \ a digital twin concept food supply\nchain analysis. Their developed digital\
    \ twin includes: (I) a network based on knowledge\nfrom, e.g., customers, suppliers,\
    \ and factories, (II) some parameters, e.g., in production,\ntransportation, warehouses,\
    \ sourcing, shipment costs, and policies, (III) various operational\nparameters,\
    \ e.g., demand, quality, target inventory, and vehicle capacity. It was found\n\
    that the developed digital twin can be used for optimization, simulation, and\
    \ analysis of\noperation and performance changes in the food supply chain [83].\n\
    According to [43], digital twin in post-harvest can be considered as mechanistic,\n\
    statistical, and intelligent models; however, it was found that the physics-based\
    \ mechanistic\ndigital twin concepts can evaluate the quality of fresh agricultural\
    \ products better than\nthe others. Physics-based digital twins were developed\
    \ on 331 cold chain shipments of\nfour fruits (i.e., cucumber, eggplant, strawberry,\
    \ raspberry) by [84]. Based on digital twin\nconcepts, it was found that the quality\
    \ of fruits may be affected (around 43–85%) before\nbeing delivered to stores.\n\
    The post-harvest processing has improved through the application of digital solutions\n\
    over the last several years. However, the use of the digital twin paradigm is\
    \ receiving more\nattention in post-harvest food processing due to the future\
    \ product quality prediction and\ncost reduction. The digital twin of post-harvest\
    \ processes may be developed to model,\noptimize, represent, and characterize\
    \ the design and operational parameters such as quality,\nsafety, ingredients,\
    \ shelf-life, and product status, which need to be considered by researchers\n\
    in future studies.\n5. Challenges and Future Needs\nSummary of the digital twin\
    \ concepts developed in the literature for different purposes\nin agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds, including soil, irrigation, crop monitoring, robotics, farm machinery,\n\
    and post-harvest processing, is presented in Tables 2–4. These tables show that\
    \ the digital\ntwin paradigm is in the early stage of research and development\
    \ in the agricultural context,\nand future studies in terms of knowledge, technological,\

    \ Many elements of the soil,\nirrigation, and environmental parameters in agricultural\
    \ land can be continuously mon-\nitored, analyzed, and their management strategies\
    \ optimized using big data analytics,\nmachine learning models, and decision support\
    \ systems embedded in the digital twin\nconcepts. The combination of soil and\
    \ irrigation digital twin approaches to record, monitor,\nand analyze agricultural\
    \ land changes may lead to improved performance of crop farming.\nFor instance,\
    \ simulation of soil structure along with data-driven updating models could\n\
    connect farmers to the farm using the IoT technology and present, in detail, pictures\
    \ of\nparameters that impact the soil, irrigation, and crop yield. However, few\
    \ studies focus on\nthe development of digital twin concepts of agriculture soil\
    \ with higher degree of ﬂexibility\nas well as considering a wider range of operation\
    \ than existing simulation models. Soil\nsensors could constantly measure and\
    \ record the dynamic condition of arable soil, e.g.,\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n\
    11 of 16\nwater holding capacity, moisture, temperature [53]. These data, along\
    \ with information\nfrom soil structure and simulation techniques, can be transferred\
    \ to digital twin concepts,\nand constant feedback from the digital world may\
    \ advise real-time responses for soil and\nwater management as well as control\
    \ systems. In recent years, there has been rapid growth\nin the digital farming\
    \ scenarios, use of remote sensing, digital soil mapping, and develop-\nment of\
    \ software platforms. However, researches needed to fuse the developed techniques\n\
    along with the IoT, edge-computing, AI, data analytics, and simulation techniques\
    \ that\ncould lead to development of a digital twin paradigm is in an early stage\
    \ and needs to\nbe addressed in future studies. Furthermore, researchers need\
    \ to consider the practical\nchallenges of digital twin-based systems in soil\
    \ and irrigation as digital twins are multi-\nand interdisciplinary techniques\
    \ and require systems engineering perspectives [90].\nDigital twin offers real-time\
    \ simulation of farm machinery and robots that can beneﬁt\noptimal design of the\
    \ products, interaction with the environment, energy usage, and main-\ntenance\
    \ strategies. Digital twin concepts have the possibility to predict failures in\
    \ farm\nmachinery and support decision-making scenarios in plant production. Farm\
    \ owners can\nbe able to connect to the machines through virtual world for monitoring\
    \ and tracking of the\ndevices in agricultural farms. Digital twin systems are\
    \ accompanied by recording a large\namount of data and exchanging information\
    \ between different assets; hence compiling\nand analyzing these data is a challenge\
    \ facing farms, particularly in some rural areas with\npoor internet and technological\
    \ infrastructures [91]. Other alternatives, e.g., Long Range\ntechnology based\
    \ on wireless sensor networks communication and edge-computing could\nbe used\
    \ to mitigate internet access problems in rural areas for the connection part\
    \ of the\ndigital twin concepts [32,92]. Future opportunities for the implementation\
    \ of digital twin\nsystems in crop farm technologies could lie in the development\
    \ of standards as well as data\ntransferring and communication strategies in this\
    \ context.\nThe digital twin of crop production using big data collected from\
    \ crop and farm ma-\nchinery as well as robots, analytical and AI models, IoT,\
    \ and satellite and drone information\ncould allow simulating crop, environmental,\
    \ and farm conditions in the digital world to\ndetermine unknown and unseen issues\
    \ before happening in the physical world. Agricul-\ntural objects (crops in particular)\
    \ need frequent updates in data to support information\nanalysis and decision-making\
    \ processes [93] which in turn can promote sustainable farming\npractices and\
    \ save energy usage in crop productions. In this context, greater effort should\n\
    be focused in the future on characterization and development of frameworks for\
    \ more effec-\ntive practical digital twin paradigms. In crop farming, all information\
    \ may not be recorded\nand tracked using digital sensors; however, combining data\
    \ from different sources could\nimprove the virtual representation of the farm\
    \ operation and environment [73]. Continuous\nmonitoring of crops in digital twin\
    \ systems by simulating the dynamic farm conditions\nand considering the effect\
    \ of management, climate, and environmental conditions on the\nplant growth and\
    \ use of data-driven models along with sensor fusion techniques could\nhelp to\
    \ identify deviations from the normal conditions of the plant, and forecast growth\n\
    stages to reduce risk of environmental and management effects. In future, different\
    \ digital\ntwin concepts might be applied to copy the complex physical system\
    \ of crop farming in\nthe digital world and incorporate variable sensors, data\
    \ collecting strategies, modeling,\nforecasting, and simulation approaches in\
    \ crop farming.\nIn addition, digital twin concepts can support monitoring, tracking,\
    \ and analysis of\nfood through the entire supply chain. Development of a digital\
    \ copy of an agricultural\nproduct to monitor post-harvest processing could be\
    \ used to optimize the process, reduce\nenergy use, labor, and food losses based\
    \ on information from different sensors and simula-\ntion models. Future studies\
    \ need to be carried out to consider more environmental and\npost-harvest product\
    \ features for the development of robust digital twins [45]. Another\nmajor challenge\
    \ in the development of digital twin for post-harvest processing to minimize\n\
    quality losses and improve the shelf-life of the product is considering the value\
    \ chain of\nagricultural products from farm to fork [43], which has not been addressed\
    \ yet. In post-\nharvest processing to reduce uncertainty in digital twins and\
    \ enable the consumer to trust\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n12 of 16\nthe output of\
    \ digital twin concepts, detailed experimental and data collection approaches\n\
    along with numerical modeling and validation techniques need be considered.\n\
    6. Conclusions\nEmploying digital technology has helped agricultural farm managers\
    \ to improve\nefﬁciency, yield, and reduce losses. There are different types of\
    \ digital farming paradigms\nin the literature that could be used in digital twin\
    \ concepts as the next generation of\ndigitalization in the agricultural ﬁeld.\
    \ The results of this review show that the digital twin\nconcepts in agriculture\
    \ and food processing have, so far, been little exploited in research.\nThere\
    \ are several research challenges and opportunities in different stages of digital\
    \ farming.\nDigital twin paradigms can be meaningfully utilized for soil and irrigation,\
    \ crop, robots and\nfarm machinery, and post-harvest food processing in the agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld. In this context,\nmost of the studies have focused on the development\
    \ of digital twins by considering some\nlimited parameters in agricultural sectors.\
    \ Deploying of state-of-the-art technologies, e.g.,\nAI, advanced statistical\
    \ and optimization models, big data analytics, and three-dimensional\nsimulation,\
    \ offer further possibilities for improvement in farm management. With real-\n\
    time and continuous information about agricultural assets, virtual models can\
    \ predict\nand address unseen issues in the ﬁelds. It may support farmers to decline\
    \ the economic\npressure on the agricultural sector and labor issues, and help\
    \ policy makers responsible for\nfood security and environmental protection, towards\
    \ strengthening the agriculture sector.\nIn addition, it facilitates the work\
    \ of researchers exploring methods to track and monitor\ncrop farm machinery,\
    \ agricultural and post-harvest products or reduce water, chemicals,\nand energy\
    \ usage in digital farming. Although many digital twin systems in engineering,\n\
    manufacturing, and health contexts have been developed, further attempts need\
    \ to be\nconsidered in the agricultural context towards the development of digital\
    \ twin systems\nthat can monitor, record, and analyze data, to predict and prescribe\
    \ the best decision for\ndigital farming management.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

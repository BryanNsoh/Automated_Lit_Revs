    Get rights and content Highlights • Basin (BI), drip (DI), pillow (PI) and tube-sprinkler
    (SI) irrigation methods were tested. • DI increased yield under limited water
    supply by increasing soil water availability to crops. • More frequent irrigation
    using PI and SI didn’t affect yield under adequate water supply. • BI was more
    economic than the other three methods due to its low cost. Abstract The rapid
    decline of groundwater table is threatening sustainable irrigation agricultural
    development in the North China Plain (NCP). Optimized irrigation scheduling and
    water-saving irrigation technologies need to be developed to reduce irrigation
    water use and maintain the grain production potential for the region. This study
    was conducted at Luancheng experimental station in the NCP during 2012–2015 to
    evaluate the effects of different irrigation methods (basin irrigation, BI; tube-sprinkler
    irrigation, SI; pillow irrigation, PI and drip irrigation, DI) with various irrigation
    amount/frequency on yield, economic returns and water use efficiency (WUE) of
    winter wheat. Under the same limited irrigation amount (90 mm/season), two irrigation
    applications (45 mm/application) conducted using DI significantly increased the
    yield and WUE as compared with the BI using one single application. Increasing
    the seasonal irrigation amount to 160 mm, the increase in the application frequency
    by reducing the irrigation amount per application didn’t significantly affect
    the yield using either PI or SI. Results showed that soil water depletion (SWD)
    contributed 40–60% of the seasonal evapotranspiration (ET) under limited water
    supply. The smaller root length density (RLD) in deep layers of the soil restricted
    the soil water uptake by the crop. Therefore, increasing irrigation frequency
    would maintain the top soil layers with higher soil water contents where RLD was
    greater that improved crop water use and yield under limited water supply. However,
    when irrigation water was plentiful, micro-irrigation methods did not increase
    yields. Due to the high cost in installation of the three micro-irrigation systems,
    their net income was reduced by 30% as compared with the BI method. The economic
    water productivity ratio (EWPR) was only 3–4 for the three micro-irrigation systems,
    much less than the basin irrigation method, which had an average value of 16.
    Currently, the basin irrigation method is more economic for growing winter wheat
    in the NCP. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Water use

    irrigationDrip irrigation 1. Introduction Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)
    is one of the main crops in the North China Plain (NCP). It accounts for more
    than half of all winter wheat production in China (Sun et al., 2006). The rainfall
    during the growing season was about 60–150 mm. However, the consumptive water
    use by wheat is about 430–470 mm. In order to obtain higher grain yield, supplemental
    irrigation is essential (Zhang et al., 2003, Sun et al., 2011). Farmers in this
    region generally irrigate winter wheat three or four times each season (Zhang
    et al., 2017). Consequently, the groundwater table are dropping at an average
    rate of about 1–1.5 m/year due to over-pumping (Chen et al., 2010), which is threatening
    the sustainable development of irrigation agriculture in this region. To cope
    with the shortage of irrigation water resources, suitable irrigation strategies
    and water-saving irrigation technologies need to be produced. Deficit irrigation,
    defined as the application of water below full crop-water requirements (Fereres
    and Soriano, 2007), has been promoted in many countries in an attempt to minimize
    irrigation water use (Fereres and Soriano, 2007, Tari, 2016). Peake et al. (2016)
    reported that deficit irrigation has greater economic water productivity under
    water limited conditions. This irrigation strategies could increase water productivity
    in the ranges of 10%–50% (Jensen et al., 2014). Large soil water holding capacity,
    high soil water contents at sowing and deep root system were important factors
    for the application of deficit irrigation (Stockle and James, 1989, Lobell and
    Ortiz-Monasterio, 2006, Peake et al., 2008, Peake et al., 2016). Zhang et al.
    (2013) reported that a single irrigation at jointing stage could reduce irrigation
    water use by 120–140 mm as compared with full irrigation treatment with yield
    penalties of 14% for winter wheat in the NCP. Ali et al. (2007) showed that deficit
    irrigation saved 135 mm water but with 16% yield decrease as compared with the
    full water supply treatment of wheat in Bangladesh. The yield decrease of spring
    wheat under reduced irrigation was mainly related to climatic conditions, soil
    properties and timing of irrigation (Lobell and Ortiz-Monasterio, 2006). Optimizing
    the irrigation strategies is another aspect to efficiently utilize the limited
    irrigation water (Rodrigues and Pereira, 2009). Some studies indicated that frequent
    application of water in small quantities can increase water use efficiency (WUE)
    (e.g. Enciso et al., 2003). Rawlins (1973) suggested that the water holding capacity
    of the soil become less important with the increase in irrigation frequency. Other
    studies have shown that increasing irrigation frequencies with small quantities
    per application could maintain higher grain yield of maize (Zea mays L.), with
    a reduction in yield observed with decreasing irrigation frequency in Loess Plateau
    of Northwest China (Wang et al., 2014). Bian et al. (2016) indicated that 60 mm
    of water applied at jointing and heading stages for winter wheat achieved higher
    grain yield than a single application of 120 mm at jointing stage. Sezen et al.
    (2006) showed that irrigation intervals of 3–6 days (18–22 mm) obtained higher
    WUE, irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) and grain yield of bell pepper at
    a Arikli silty–clay–loam soil conditions. Muhumed et al. (2014) reported that
    above-ground biomass and yield components of sweet corn increased with the increase
    in irrigation frequency. Unfortunately, traditional irrigation methods such as
    flooding irrigation may not easily control the irrigation amount per application
    (e.g. Sezen et al., 2006), and alternate irrigation methods might be required
    to improve the IWUE for field grown crops, such as winter wheat. Micro-irrigation
    can precisely control the irrigation application and are popular in orchards,
    vegetable growing and wide-row planted crops (e.g. Pereira et al., 2012, Bhunia
    et al., 2015, Gerçek et al., 2017). Drip irrigation is one of the major micro-irrigation
    methods, allowing accurate application of irrigation in small amount directly
    to the root zone (Bhunia et al., 2015). Increasing the frequencies by drip irrigation
    could maintain a high soil matric potential in the root rhizosphere, accelerating
    crop growth, decreasing deep percolation, reducing soil evaporation and saving
    irrigation water (Qin et al., 2016, Jensen et al., 2014). Jensen et al. (2014)
    reported that drip irrigation can reduce the loss of irrigation water in conveyance,
    and saved 30–40% water compared to basin irrigation. Muhumed et al. (2014) indicated
    that above-ground biomass and yield components of sweet corn were increased with
    the increase in drip irrigation frequency. Other irrigation methods such as pillow
    irrigation and tube-sprinkler irrigation are also being used in growing crops.
    Pillow irrigation, which uses plastic tubes with holes on the tubes and the tubes
    are placed between two rows of the crop, can directly deliver water to the crop.
    The diameters of tubes are varied based on plant row spacing, and the tube after
    irrigation can cover the row spacing as mulch material. Plastic tube was pierced
    with holes of 1-mm diameter. Hole spacing varies between 50 and 100 cm depending
    on crop species (ek et al., 2009a, 2017;). Pillow irrigation has the benefits
    of plastic mulching and drip irrigation. This method can also restrict weed growth
    and improve grain yield as well as WUE of hot pepper under limited water supply
    (Gerçek et al., 2009b). For the application of the micro-sprinkler irrigation
    to the densely planted crops, such as winter wheat, a modified micro-sprinkler
    irrigation is becoming popular in China This method uses a thin tube placed on
    the soil surface with holes on it. Pressurized water will come out from the holes
    acting as sprinkler. Liu and Kang (2006) reported that the air temperature and
    vapor pressure deficit of winter wheat in sprinkler-irrigated treatment was lower
    than that under surface irrigation treatment in NCP. However, due to the higher
    cost in installation and maintenance, those micro-irrigation systems are not widely
    used on the cereal crops in the NCP currently. Micro-irrigations can save water
    as compared with flood irrigation due to the reduction in water loss from evaporation,
    deep percolation as well as during water delivery (Namara et al., 2007, Maisiri
    et al., 2005). With the increase in irrigation water shortage, water-saving irrigation
    methods would become more important in future. However, their wide use in crops
    is still limited, due to the high investment and maintenance cost of the irrigation
    system and the lower economic returns of the crops (Paredes et al., 2014). Hanson
    et al. (1997) suggested that savings from reduced water costs of lettuce were
    not enough to offset the equipment costs of drip irrigation system. Dağdelen et
    al. (2009) indicated that drip irrigation method saved 177 mm water, but lead
    to 34.0% reduction in the net income of cotton. However, Namara et al. (2007)
    found that micro-irrigation technologies can increase economic returns of banana
    and peanut when compared to flood irrigation in India. Selection of a suitable
    irrigation method would depend on the specific conditions of water resources,
    crop types and management requirements. Therefore, the objectives of this research
    are as follows: 1) To assess the performance of basin irrigation, tube-sprinkler
    irrigation, drip irrigation and pillow irrigation methods on grain yield and WUE
    of winter wheat, and 2) to evaluate the economic benefits of different irrigation
    methods. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Study site and the growing condition of
    the crop The experiment was conducted during 2012–2013, 2013–2014 and 2014–2015,
    three growing seasons of winter wheat, at Luancheng experimental station (37°53′N,
    114°40′N; elevation 50 m) in the North China Plain (NCP). Winter wheat (grown
    from October to earlier June) and summer maize (grown from earlier June to the
    end of September) form the annual double cropping system. The mean annual precipitation
    is 473 mm, with around 30% of the precipitation falling during the winter wheat
    season. The soil is loam with average field capacity at 36% (v/v) and wilting
    point at 13% (v/v) for the top 2 m of the soil profile. The groundwater table
    was 40 m below soil surface; and the soil and irrigation water have no salinity
    problems. Soil nutrient contents were 18 g/kg for organic matter, 80 mg/kg for
    available N, 110 mg/kg for available K and 15 mg/kg for available P for the top
    tillage layer. Detailed soil physical characteristics at the experimental site
    can be found in Zhang et al. (2016). Winter wheat was sown in October after maize
    was harvested and the maize straw was chopped and incorporated into the top soil
    layer. The same winter wheat cultivar “KN199” was used for the three seasons.
    Winter wheat was planted following the local practice with four rows closely together;
    and between two four-close-rows there was a wide row spacing of 30 cm. The four
    close rows had row spacing around 12 cm. The four rows took 0.6 cm width averagely.
    Seeding rate was 300 viable seeds/m2 and sowing was done with a seeding machine.
    Before planting, diammonium phosphate (DAP) at 300 kg/ha, urea at 150 kg/ha and
    potassium chloride at 150 kg/ha were broadcast and incorporated into the soil.
    An additional 225 kg/ha of urea was top-dressed at jointing stage in early April,
    either with an irrigation or with an rainfall event. The fertilizer amount followed
    the local practices. 2.2. Treatments for irrigation methods and irrigation amounts
    Four irrigation methods: basin irrigation (BI), tube-sprinkler irrigation (SI),
    drip irrigation (DI) and pillow irrigation (PI) were tested. BI is the local irrigation
    method widely used by the local farmers. The study for the BI was included in
    a long-term irrigation scheduling study, which included six irrigation treatments
    (Zhang et al., 2008). For this study, the irrigation treatments of no irrigation,
    one irrigation application and two irrigations were used. Each treatment had four
    plots with area of 4 × 9 m2/plot. All the plots were boarded to form a basin for
    flooding irrigation (Fig. 1). The irrigation was conducted by connecting a plastic
    tube with the low-pressure water transportation pipeline and a flow meter was
    connected with the outlet from the pipeline to record the water used for each
    plot. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 1. Illustration of the different irrigation methods used for this study.
    Another piece of land next to the basin site was divided into three parts for
    SI, DI and PI study (Fig. 1). The soil conditions of this land were the same as
    that with the BI. Each part had an area of 16 m in width and 40 m in length. The
    drip lines were arranged at 60 cm apart, and it was placed on the middle of the
    four close rows. The drip irrigation system had a dripping rate of 2 L/h for each
    emitter and working pressure of 0.6 Mpa. The pipes for tube-sprinkler was set
    at 1.2 m apart in the field and placed on the middle of a wide row. The tube had
    a diameter of 4 cm and a working pressure of 1.1 kPa/s. The pillow irrigation
    was using the plastic pipes with diameter of 20 cm and holes on the pipes. The
    pipes were placed on each wide row. When the pipes were filled with water, the
    water would directly infiltrate into the soil through the holes on the pipes.
    A plastic tube which had outlets connected with the pipes low-pressure water transportation
    system delivered the water to the pipes and a switch was installed at each outlet
    to control the water supply to each pipe line. After irrigation, the pipes could
    act as plastic mulch to prevent soil evaporation. The irrigation water was from
    underground. The DI and SI were installed with a pressurization system to control
    the pressure required for individual system. For the three seasons, the treatments
    of BI was fixed as the following: no irrigation (B-0), one irrigation application
    at jointing stage (B-90, total amount of 90 mm) and two irrigations at jointing
    and anthesis stages (B-160, total amount of 160 mm with 90 mm at jointing and
    70 mm at anthesis). The other three methods had similar irrigation amount but
    different irrigation frequency to be compared with the BI on the effects of yield
    and WUE of winter wheat for the three seasons. The detailed irrigation arrangement
    was listed in Table 1. DI had similar seasonal irrigation amount as with B-90
    but with increased irrigation frequency to examine the irrigation amount/application
    and irrigation frequency on the effects of winter wheat. In 2012–2013 and 2013–2014
    season, the PI and SI had similar irrigation amount as with B-160 but with increased
    irrigation efficiency to examine the effects of increased irrigation efficiency
    on the performance of winter wheat under relative sufficient water supply. In
    2014–2015, PI and SI had the same treatments as with the DI to compare the performance
    of the three irrigation methods. The setting up of the irrigation scheduling of
    the basin irrigation method was following Zhang et al. (2008) at the same site.
    Their results indicated a single irrigation at jointing stage as the optimized
    irrigation scheduling under limited water supply, and two irrigations at jointing
    and anthesis as the normal irrigation scheduling treatment that produced good
    yield under moderate water supply condition using BI. Table 1. Irrigation amount,

    methods of SI, DI and PI 2.3. Measurements 2.3.1. Weather conditions The daily
    weather conditions, including sunshine duration, air temperature, relative humidity,
    wind speed, radiation and rainfall were recorded from a weather station about
    50 m away from the experimental site. Daily reference evapotranspiration (ET0)
    was calculated with the crop water program developed by FAO using Penman-Monteith
    equation, which represents the concept of grass reference evapotranspiration (albedo
    = 0.23, height = 0.12 m, surface resistance = 70 s/m) (Allen et al., 1998). The
    ET0 was used to compare the atmospheric evaporation potential of the three seasons.
    2.3.2. Soil water content Soil water contents was monitored in each treatment
    with four sites using a neutron probe (503 DR, CPN International Inc., USA) for
    each 20 cm soil layer down to 2 m cm every 10 days during the winter wheat growing
    season. Soil water contents at the top 20 cm layer were monitored by gravity method.
    The neutron probe was calibrated using the data obtained at the same site for
    different soil layers. 2.3.3. Root distribution and soil evaporation measuring
    After winter dormancy in the 2012–2013 season, daily soil evaporation rate for
    DI, B-90 and B-160 was measured using micro-lysimeter as described by Liu et al.
    (2002). Four micro-lysimeters were placed on the wider row spacing for each treatment.
    The micro-lysimeters contained small isolated volumes of soil, mounted flush with
    or slightly above the soil surface and were weighed daily to determine water loss
    using electronic balances with 0.001 kg precision. The diameter of the micro-lysimeter
    was 12 cm with a depth of 20 cm. In order to keep the soil moisture in micro-lysimeters
    similar to that outside of the cylinder, the original soil in the instruments
    was changed every two or three days by pressing the cylinder into the soil and
    extracting it. The bottom of the cylinder was sealed with water-proof tape. Roots
    were sampled in the 2013–2014 season for the basin irrigation at maturity of winter
    wheat under B-0, B-90 and B-160. Four sites for each treatment down to 150 cm
    at 10 cm increments were sampled. The diameter of the corer was at 10 cm. The
    cores were washed to obtain the roots, and root length was measured based on the
    line-intersect method (Tennant, 1975). The root length density (RLD) at different
    depths was calculated by dividing the root length by the sampled soil volume (cm/cm3).
    2.3.4. Grain yield, yield components At maturity, four sites were randomly selected
    from each treatment for yield measuring. The size of each site was around 10 m2
    and the plants were all harvested. Before harvesting, spike density was measured
    and eighty plants from each site were randomly selected, cut at the base and air-dried
    to a constant weight to measure the seed numbers per spike and seed weight for
    deciding yield components and harvest index (HI). After harvesting all plants
    were manually threshed with a thresher. Grains were air-dried to a constant moisture
    and the weightwas recorded to obtain the final grain yield (13% water contents).
    2.3.5. Seasonal crop water use, water use efficiency The seasonal water use of
    winter wheat under different irrigation methods defined as seasonal evapotranspiration
    (ET), was calculated based on the water balance equation (Zhang et al., 2008):
    (1) ET = P + I + SWD − R − D + CR Where ET was seasonal evapotranspiration (mm),
    P was precipitation (mm), I was irrigation (mm), SWD was soil water depletion
    for 2 m soil depth (mm). R was surface runoff (mm), D was drainage from the root
    zone (mm) and CR was capillary rise to the root zone (mm). Surface runoff, drainage
    and capillary rise to the root zone were taken as zero due to the less rainfall,
    small irrigation amount and the deep groundwater table (40 m below soil surface).
    WUE was calculated by the following equation: (2) WUE = Y/ET Where WUE was water
    use efficiency (kg/m3), Y was grain yield (kg/ha). 2.4. Economic analysis Economic
    analysis was conducted by deciding the total cost for different irrigation methods
    and gross income for grain production. The total cost from different irrigation
    systems included the costs in buying the irrigation equipment, labor input and
    the electricity used during the irrigation. The life span of DI, SI and PI was
    based on the quality of the pipelines used. For this study the emitter lines for
    drip used the renewable ones and renewd each year. The life span for the SI and
    PI systems was set at 3 years. Seed costs and fertilizer input were included in
    the analysis based on the market price. The cost related to different irrigation
    methods were presented in Table 2. Gross income was the value of grain production
    based on the local current market price of winter wheat, it was 2.20 yuan/kg (1
    USA dollar = 6.8 yuan). Net income for each irrigation method was computed by
    subtracting the total cost from gross income. Labor costs in irrigation and installation
    of the irrigation systems used the price of 100 yuan/day. Economic water productivity
    ratio (EWPR) was calculated as grain yield value divided by irrigation farm cost
    (Paredes et al., 2014). Here, the irrigation farm cost only included the cost
    of the irrigation systems and the cost of conducting the irrigation. The costs
    in other management practices were not included for calculating EWPR. Table 2.

    in grain yield, WUE and economic outcomes and EWPRs among the irrigation methods
    and irrigation frequency under the same season. Difference between mean values
    of irrigation treatments were studied using test for least significant difference
    at a 0.05 significance level. 3. Results 3.1. Weather conditions during 2012–2015
    growing seasons Fig. 2 shows the accumulated ET0, sunshine hours, temperature
    (>0 °C) and rainfall for the three seasons as compared with the long-term average.
    There was large variation among the weather factors during the three seasons.
    The seasonal ET0 during 2012–2015 was 509, 552, 581 mm, much higher than the long-term
    average of 495 mm. The long-term average for sunshine hours was 1295. Total sunshine
    hours during 2012–2015 seasons was 1073, 1259, 1416 h. Compared with the long-term
    average, the sunshine conditions in 2014–2015 season was quite good. However,
    it was very poor in 2012–2013 season, especially during the grainfill stage. Among
    the three seasons, the accumulated temperature was lower in 2012–2013. The seasonal
    rainfall during 2012–2015 seasons was 122, 48, 77 mm respectively. Compared with
    the long-term average rainfall of 122 mm, 2012–2013 was a relatively normal season
    while the other two seasons were very dry, especially during 2013–2014. The large
    difference in atmospheric evaporation demand and seasonal rainfall demonstrated
    the importance of supplemental irrigation to winter wheat. Download : Download

    changes under different irrigation treatments Taking the dry season of 2013–2014
    under BI as an example, due to the low rainfall and the large water requirements
    for winter wheat in the NCP, soil water declined throughout the whole growing
    season, especially for the treatment without irrigation (Fig. 3). From sowing
    to the end of winter dormancy, the water use for winter wheat was small and had
    only a slight declining trend. As crop growth accelerated after dormancy and the
    increase in atmospheric evaporation potential, a rapid decline in soil water content
    was observed. Soil water reserves were also depleted even when 90 or 160 mm of
    irrigation was applied. Water application around anthesis stage for B-160 treatment
    slightly reduced the declining trend, but due to the lower soil water contents
    at the irrigation, the replenishment to the soil water was not apparent (Fig.
    3). The results showed that soil water stored before sowing played an important
    role to supply the water requirements of winter wheat under the growing condition

    B-90: one irrigation and B-160: two irrigations) in 2013–2014 season. (Bars represent
    the standard deviation of four replicates). Soil water depletion (SWD) contributed
    greatly to the seasonal ET under limited water supply. Fig. 4 indicates the large
    change in soil water contents for the 0–2 m soil profile at sowing with that at
    harvesting for three irrigation treatments. SWD was 215.2, 244.9.0 and 223.9 mm
    under B-0, B-90 and B-160 in the dry season of 2013–2014. The soil water uptake
    was gradually reduced with the increase in soil depth, especially down below 150
    cm, where RLD was small (Fig. 5). The low RLD in the deep soil layers restricted
    the fully soil water uptake by the crop. The results also showed that SWD under
    B-90 was greater than B-0, which was possibly related to the increased growth
    in root and shoot under B-90 than that B-0. The total root length and above-ground
    biomass of B-90 were 22.7% and 32.2% greater than that of B-0, respectively. The
    increased growth both in roots and shoots increased the water requirements and
    the ability in utilizing soil water. The decreased SWD for B-160 as compared with
    B-90 had been related to the increase in irrigation amount for B-160 treatment.

    B-90: one irrigation and B-160: two irrigations under basin irrigation) in 2013–2014
    season. (Bars represent the standard deviation of four replicates). The increased
    irrigation frequency under the three micro-irrigation systems improved the soil
    water conditions at the top soil layer, especially during the grainfill stage.
    The soil water storage for the top 1 m soil profile was averagely 20 mm greater
    under two irrigation applications using micro-irrigation methods than that B-90
    around 10 days after anthesis. Therefore, the more soil stored in the top 1 m
    soil layer under the increased irrigation frequency would have the benefits to
    increase the soil water availability to the crop during the later growth stages
    of the crop. 3.3. Crop water use, yield and WUE under different irrigation treatments
    Crop water use (ET) was listed in Table 3 for different irrigation treatments
    across the 2012–2015 seasons. Water use and the yield of the crop were affected
    not only by the irrigation management, but also by the seasonal weather conditions
    and stored soil water. The lower ET0 in 2012–2013 season resulted in the lower
    ET for the irrigated treatments, as compared with that in 2013–2014 season. Although
    rainfall in 2013–2014 season was small, the relative higher soil water contents
    at sowing contributed greatly to the ET. Due to the dry summer before planting
    winter wheat in 2014–2015 season, the contribution of SWD to ET was reduced under
    rainfed condition as compared with other seasons. On Average, SWD contributed
    60–80% of the seasonal ET for the rainfed treatment, 40–60% under limited irrigation
    and 20–50% under increased water supply condition. ET was increased with the increase
    in irrigation amount and the contribution of the soil water stored before sowing
    was reduced. Table 3. Crop water use (ET), soil water depletion (SWD), yield and

    values followed with the same letter was not significant at P = 0.05. Grain yield
    was affected by different irrigation management and the seasonal weather conditions.
    The highest yield was achieved in the 2013–2014 season, which was related to the
    good soil water condition at sowing and favorable growing conditions (higher sunshine
    hours and warm temperatures). The reduced yield in 2012–2013 season was probably
    related to the lower sunshine duration and lower temperature, although the rainfall
    was the largest among the three seasons. Table 3 indicates the large increase
    in yield from no irrigation to one irrigation applications. Yield was increased
    by 24.7%, 31.3% and 80.4% from B-0 to B-90 in the three seasons, respectively.
    The largest increase from B-0 to B-90 in 2014–2015 season was related to the lower
    soil water contents at sowing, and plentiful rainfall was received in the later
    growing stages of the crop. The rain-fed treatment was significantly affected
    by the water shortage through the whole season, thus the grain production was
    significantly reduced. The yield increase was 18.1%, 16.8% and 18.7% from B-90
    to B-160 for the three seasons, respectively. With the same amount of irrigation
    at 90 mm, drip irrigation increased grain yield of by 12.0%, 12.9% and 11.6%,
    as compared with the basin irrigation method (B-90), for the three seasons, respectively.
    The increase in WUE was 18.1%, 19.6% and 21.9%, respectively, for the three seasons.
    The results indicated that increasing the irrigation frequency using drip irrigation
    under limited water supply significantly improved the crop performance both in
    yield and WUE when total irrigation volume was the same. Comparing the performance
    of B-160 and DI, both having irrigation frequency of twice but differed in total
    irrigation volume (irrigation volume of DI being 46% lower than that of B-160),
    yield of DI was only 5.2%, 3.3% and 6.0% lower than that of B-160 during 2012–2015
    seasons, respectively. With large reduction in irrigation water use, yield was
    less affected by using the drip irrigation method. The WUE under DI was 12.1%,
    15.8% and 22.4% greater than that B-160 for the three seasons, respectively. Further
    increasing in irrigation frequency under increased irrigation amount didn’t significantly
    increase the yield of winter wheat in 2012–2013 and 2013–2014 seasons. Table 3
    shows there was no significant difference among the yield of B-160, PI and SI,
    only with slight increase in WUE under PI. Comparing the three irrigation methods
    under the same irrigation amount of 90 mm in 2014–2015, yield increase was 11.6%,
    10.9% and 6.4% under DI, PI and SI, respectively, as compared with B-90. The increasing
    in irrigation frequency from one to two times using the three methods all improved
    the performance of winter wheat. WUE was increased by 21.7%, 10.2% and 3.8% under
    the three methods, respectively, as compared with B-90. The increase in WUE and
    yield under DI and PI were greater than that under SI, indicating the water evaporation
    during the irrigation and immediately after the irrigation might reduce the water
    availability to crops using the tube-sprinkler system. 3.4. Factors related to
    the improved yield and WUE The results from Table 3 indicated that under limited
    water supply (90 mm), increasing the irrigation frequency from one to two times
    using DI, PI and SI improved yield and WUE. The improvement was greater under
    DI and PI than that under SI, especially for the WUE. The increase in yield was
    associated with the improved seed weight under DI. No significant difference in
    kernel numbers existed between DI and B-90 during 2012–2015 seasons. The increased
    irrigation frequency improved the soil water contents during the grainfill stage
    for the top 1 m soil profile, which favored the seed formation. Therefore, seed
    weight and harvest index were all increased under DI as compared with B-90 for
    the three seasons (Fig. 6). The average increase in seed weight was 12.9% and
    7.4% for HI during the three seasons. The higher HI was usually related to a higher
    WUE. The results also showed that the seed weight in 2012–2013 season was much
    lower than that in the other two seasons, due to the lower sunshine duration during
    the grainfill stage in 2012–2013. The reduced seed weight was the major reason
    of the lower yield in that season. Download : Download high-res image (588KB)

    drip irrigation (DI) and basin irrigation (B-90) for three growing seasons of
    winter wheat (Bars represent the standard deviation of four replicates). The improved
    yield and WUE under DI than that of BI and SI under limited irrigation supply
    was associated with reduced soil evaporation. The drip lines were placed on crop
    rows such that inter-row spaces were not wetted during the irrigation, which reduced
    the soil evaporation. Therefore, more soil water was conserved and used for the
    crop growth which benefited the grain production under water deficit condition.
    The measuring of soil evaporation using mico-lysimter in 2012–2013 season showed
    that the accumulated soil evaporation was 47.5 mm under B-90, 65.1 mm under B-160
    from recovery to maturity in 2012–2013 season. Under DI, the accumulated soil
    evaporation was 37.2 mm during the same period. Soil evaporation was reduced by
    10 mm under DI as compared with B-90, and 27.9 mm as compared with B-160. Although
    B-160 had 70 mm more irrigation water applied than that of DI, the yield increase
    was smaller, due to the higher soil evaporation consumption under B-160 than that
    of DI. The WUE improvement under SI was much smaller than that of DI and PI, it
    was related to the larger soil evaporation under SI. The accumulated soil evaporation
    was 78.0 mm under SI for the same period. Soil evaporation was the highest under
    SI than that under other irrigation methods. SI has the advantage to increase
    irrigation frequency under limited irrigation application, but the increased soil
    evaporation somehow reduced this benefit. 3.5. Economic evaluation Table 4 lists
    the gross income, irrigation cost and other costs for growing winter wheat across
    the 2012–2015 seasons. The results showed that basin irrigation produced the highest
    net income, and the increased irrigation amount also improved the farm income.
    Table 4 shows that the increase in total irrigation amount from 90 to 160 mm increased
    net income by 28.4, 23.3 and 28.1% during the three seasons, respectively. But
    the largest increase in net income was from no irrigation to B-90, which was 30.8,
    40.8 and 197.4% for the three seasons, respectively. The results indicated the
    irrigation application significantly increased the net income of growing winter
    wheat in the NCP. But due to the higher costs, the three micro-irrigation systems
    all produced lower net income as compared with the basin irrigation method. The
    increase in yield by the micro-irrigation systems could not compensate the increased
    costs in installation of the irrigation systems. However, as compared with the
    rain-fed treatment, the micro-irrigation systems produced higher net income, indicating
    even with expensive irrigation cost, the increase in yield by any irrigation method
    could offset the increased costs in irrigation system installation, which further
    indicated the importance of supplemental irrigation to winter wheat production
    in the NCP. Due to the relative lower cost in installation of SI, the net income
    using SI was slightly greater than that of DI and PI. DI outperformed PI in net
    income. EWPR of BI was around four times greater than that the three micro-irrigation
    systems, indicating BI being more economic for winter wheat irrigation under the
    current condition of NCP. Table 4. The economic outcome and the economic water

    P = 0.05. Currently, the price of irrigation water use only includes the electricity
    cost in the NCP for the underground water pumping. With the increased water shortage
    and the control in groundwater use, cost in using water might be increased in
    the future. The results showed that when the water price went to 3.5 yuan/m3,
    the net income of rain-fed wheat would outperform the irrigated winter wheat.
    The water price from the South-North water transfer project was 5 yuan/m3 in the
    NCP, thus the profit from using the transferred water for grown crops would be
    negative. Therefore, it is important to improve the WUE to increase grain production
    under limited water supply by agronomic, breeding and irrigation methods. 4. Discussion
    Results from this study indicated the importance of supplemental irrigation to
    the increase in grain production of winter wheat in the NCP. With one irrigation
    application, the yield of winter wheat was increased by 24–80%. Additional irrigation
    further increased yield by 18%. Further increase in irrigation application didn’t
    significantly increase crop production using flooding irrigation method (Zhang
    et al., 2008, Zhang et al., 2017). Many studies indicated that two irrigations
    for winter wheat was the optimized irrigation scheduling in terms of irrigation
    water-saving and irrigation efficiency in the NCP. The results from this study
    also showed that different irrigation methods combined with different irrigation
    frequency affected both the grain production and WUE under the same seasonal irrigation
    amount. Regulated deficit irrigation scheduling has been applied to relieve the
    irrigation water shortage problems around the world (Peake et al., 2016, Jensen
    et al., 2014). Under limited irrigation, adopting irrigation methods to increase
    irrigation efficience and crop production are very important. Some studies indicated
    that frequent application of water in small quantities can provide appropriate
    water for crop growth and increase yield and WUE (Enciso et al., 2003, Qin et
    al., 2016, Bian et al., 2016, Sezen et al., 2006). However, the small quantities
    per application may not be easily implemented using flooding irrigation method.
    The micro-irrigation systems provided the opportunity to precisely manage the
    limited irrigation water. The results from this study indicated that using drip
    irrigation to double the irrigation application numbers improved yield by 12%
    and WUE by 20%, as compared with the one irrigation application using the flooding
    irrigation method. The improvement in grain yield was related to the increased
    top soil water contents during the grainfill stage which significantly increased
    the seed weight and harvest index. The increase in WUE was related both to the
    reduced soil evaporation and improved grain yield. Previous study had shown that
    frequent irrigation could maintain a higher average water-filled pore space in
    the upper soil layer as compared with the lower frequency scheduling (Wang et
    al., 2006, Abalos et al., 2014). The results were more related to limited water
    supply. With the increase in total irrigation amount, the increase in irrigation
    frequency from twice to three times didn’t affect the yield. The reason may be
    that when soil water condition was good at sowing, the soil water could supply
    the crop water use till the end of winter dormancy. With the increased growth
    after recovery, the irrigation at jointing stage would replenish the soil water
    consumed and provide adequate water supply for this critical stage of winter wheat.
    With the growing of the crop and the increase in water consumption, soil water
    would become less and the irrigation at anthesis further replenish the soil profile
    and provide the water needed for grainfill, as Fig. 3 showing the typical soil
    water dynamics during a growing season of winter wheat. The twice irrigation scheduling
    corresponded well with the water requirement of the crop. Some studies showed
    that frequent irrigation probably resulted in the increase in soil evaporation
    (Sebastian et al., 2016). The results from this study showed that soil evaporation
    was increased under SI as compared with the B-160 with the increased irrigation
    frequency. However, due to the partly wetted soil surface under DI, soil evaporation
    was slightly reduced under DI as compared with that of B-90. Although SI increased
    soil evaporation, the benefit from the increased irrigation frequency improved
    the soil water status during the grainfill and then the final crop production
    under limited water supply condition. Soil texture influences soil water flow,
    soil water availability and storage capacity (Pachepsky and Rawls, 2003). The
    performance of different irrigation method would also be influenced by soil texture.
    Sammis (1980) showed that subsurface irrigation achieved higher WUE of potatoes
    on a Glendale clay-loam soil. When potatoes were grown on a Pedrick sandy-loam
    soil, drip irrigation and subsurface irrigation got higher WUE. The addition of
    drip lines and pillow tubes can act as mulch to reduce soil evaporation and conserve
    water on a sandy loam soil (Ben-Gal et al., 2004). Cetin and Bilgel (2002) indicated
    that sprinkler irrigation and drip irrigation can be used on a wide range of topographic
    and soil conditions. The soil texture for this study site is loam soil which is
    suitable for a wide range of irrigation methods. Soil water depletion (SWD), rainfall
    and irrigation determine the seasonal ET. Zhang et al. (2013) suggested that the
    SWD contributed approximately 40–50% of ET under rain-fed and limited water supply
    conditions. The results from this study demonstrated that the SWD contributed
    up to 80% of the seasonal ET for treatment without irrigation in a very dry season.
    The initial soil water content before winter wheat sowing was very important for
    crop production under limited water supply. This finding was consistent with the
    results of Lobell and Ortiz-Monasterio (2006) and Peake et al. (2016), who pointed
    out that stored soil water before sowing was important for obtaining higher grain
    yield under deficit irrigation. The North China Plain (NCP) is in a monsoon climate
    zone, about 70–80% of the annual rainfall occurs in summer, the rainfall during
    summer season generally replenishes the soil water before winter wheat sowing.
    This illustrated that the rainfall during summer season can be used for winter
    wheat, and this is important for the annual double cropping system of winter wheat
    and summer maize in the NCP. This observation was similar with the results of
    Zhang et al. (2017) and Lobell and Ortiz-Monasterio (2006). The small summer rainfall
    before sowing winter wheat in 2014–2015 season resulted in a very dry soil profile
    and the yield under rain-fed treatment in that season was significantly lower
    than the other two seasons (Table 3). The root system of winter wheat can reach
    to 2 m in NCP (Zhang et al., 2013). However, the smaller RLD in deep soil profile
    restricted the full extraction of soil water (Fig. 5). Even the crop encountered
    water stress, some water was still left in the deep soil without fully used by
    the crops due to the limited root growth. Stockle and James (1989) found that
    deep root system was important for the application of deficit irrigation. However,
    the growth of deep root system would also consume photosynthetic products (Passioura,
    1983, Kashiwagi et al., 2015). Zhang et al. (2009) indicated that most of the
    root system of winter wheat was in the top soil profile, the absorption of water
    stored in 15–30 cm soil layer had greater impacts on crop growth than that of
    deep root system (Kashiwagi et al., 2015). Meanwhile, the concentrations of nutrients
    were also higher in those top soil layers (Tardieu, 2012). Therefore, irrigation
    management that could increase the efficiency of soil water to the crops in the
    upper soil profile would have the potential to increase crop production under
    limited water supply. The results from this study showed that increased irrigation
    frequency using DI benefited the soil water availability to winter wheat during
    grain-fill stag. Zaman-Allah et al. (2011) also found that the seed yield was
    positively correlated with the amount of water taken during grain-fill stage of
    winter wheat, and water deficit was not favorable for the formation of seed weight
    (Tardieu, 2012). The results from this study further provded that the improved
    soil water condition during the grain-fill significantly increased seed weight
    and HI. Adopting optimized irrigation scheduling and efficient irrigation methods
    had the advantages to increase WUE and save irrigation water. But for farmers
    the economic return is one of the most important issues to be considered. Table
    4 shows that the net income from using the micro-irrigation systems was much less
    than that using the basin irrigation system, due to the high cost in installation
    of the micro-irrigation systems. The performance of different systems should be
    also assessed on their economic outcomes (Paredes et al., 2014). Bakhsh et al.
    (2015) indicated that the total cost of drip irrigation was higher than surface
    irrigation, even with a higher benefit in water saving (Rodrigues et al., 2013).
    Although drip and pillow irrigation produced higher WUE and grain yield as compared
    with the basin irrigation method under the same irrigation amount, the higher
    investment in the equipments offset the benefit. Consequently, the net income
    of micro-irrigation methods was lower than that of basin irrigation. The lower
    net income would restrict the application of those water-saving irrigation methods
    in practice. Surface irrigation method with irrigation amount at 160 mm produced
    the highest net income among the different treatments, indicating the benefits
    in reasonable increase in the irrigation water use using the low-cost irrigation
    method. The results from this study also showed that the net income was greater
    even using the expensive irrigation methods than that the rain-fed treatments.
    The results indicated the importance of supplemental irrigation to winter wheat
    in the NCP. In places with serious water shortage problem, the adopting of the
    micro-irrigation system to improve the crop production might be feasible. Paredes
    et al. (2014) indicated that EWPR was a useful indicator because it combined grain
    yield value and the total costs in irrigation. In this study, basin irrigation
    lead to higher EWPR than micro-irrigation systems. The cost of the applied water,
    transportation equipments, the response of grain yield to water and the price
    of the agricultural product decide the economic benefits of irrigation systems
    (Playán and Mateos, 2006, Rodrigues et al., 2013). In this study, the dominant
    factor resulted in the reduced net income and EWPR of micro-irrigation methods
    was the highest investment in installation of the systems. Chandran and Surendran
    (2016) indicated that if the farm area becomes lager, the initial investment cost
    will be lower due to the reduction of the components of irrigation system, such
    as the filter, pumpset, head unit and tank. Rodrigues et al. (2013) indicated
    that the feasibility of drip irrigation depending on the commodity prices and
    the irrigation system was far from economic viability due to the low commodity
    prices. Higher commodity prices could lead to the positive incomes. Ørum et al.
    (2010) showed that in order to offset the extra production cost of drip irrigation
    for potato, a 10–20% price increase for the product was needed. Therefore, increasing
    the grain price of winter wheat and water price were useful methods that could
    increase the relative net income using micro-irrigation systems, therefore increasing
    the willingness of the farmers’ in adopting water-saving methods. Since the reduction
    in irrigation water use and at the same time maintaining the grain production
    capability are the two important issues in the NCP, local government might need
    to increase the subsidy to farmers to use the water-saving irrigation methods
    for the benefit of sustainable irrigation agricultural development in the region.
    5. Conclusion In the NCP, approximately 70–80% of the annual rainfall occurs in
    summer, rainfall is small during the winter wheat growing season. Soil water stored
    before sowing or supplied by in-season irrigation play an important role for crop
    water use. Thus, the soil water availability to the crop during the growing season
    significantly affected the performance of winter wheat. Increasing irrigation
    frequency by micro-irrigation systems could improve grain yield and WUE under
    limited water supply due to the increased top soil water contents during grain-fill
    which improved seed weight and HI. Under adequate water supply condition, more
    frequent irrigation didn’t affect the grain yield. The three micro-irrigation
    methods all improved yield and WUE under limited water supply. However, due to
    the high investment in the irrigation system, the net income was significantly
    reduced as comparing with the basin irrigation method. Currently, basin irrigation
    method is more economic than that the other three micro-irrigation systems. But
    with the intensifying in water scarcity, the increasing in farm size and the possible
    subsidy from government, adoption of those water-saving irrigation methods might
    be feasible in future. Acknowledgements This study was supported by the National

    \ in mild winter cli-\nmates is mainly involved in vegetable growing, usually\
    \ Sola-\nnacea (tomato, pepper and eggplant) and Cucurbitacea (mel-\non, summer\
    \ squash, watermelon and cucumber), although \nfloricultural and ornamental crops\
    \ have also gradually in-\ncreased in importance in recent years. In addition,\
    \ in the last \ndecade, fruit tree crops have been incorporated in this indus-\n\
    try. However, in all cases, there is a continuing need for crop \ndiversification\
    \ in order to supply the market with new prod-\nucts. There have been several\
    \ advances in some cultivation \ntechniques in recent years, which are aimed at\
    \ enhancing \nproduction and maximizing economic returns (Tüzel, 2013).\nIn general,\
    \ water for irrigation is a scarce resource in \ncountries with mild winter climates.\
    \ Moreover, the increased \napplication of fertilizers accompanied by extreme\
    \ drought \nperiods can increase salinization of the available water. Thus, \n\
    optimal management is required to ensure unrestricted \ngrowth and a yield that\
    \ is close to the maximum potential, \nwhile minimizing losses to the environment.\
    \ In this respect, \nthe accurate monitoring of crop mineral status to prevent\
    \ nu-\ntritional imbalances is a step forward.\nAs in other industries, environmental\
    \ concerns are \ndriving development in greenhouse production. Life cycle \nassessment\
    \ (LCA) has become a popular tool as an objec-\ntive and transparent methodology\

    Greenhouse production in mild winter climates is main-\nly based on low-technology\
    \ cold greenhouses, whose main \ntraits are their simple construction characteristics\
    \ and tech-\nnologies, a low level of automation and mechanization, and \na lack\
    \ of devices for controlling environmental parameters. \nConsequently, there is\
    \ a very strong and direct dependence of \nthe microclimate   in these greenhouses\
    \ on external climatic \nconditions   (Baille, 2001). However, the greenhouse\
    \ industry \nand growers are continually developing new strategies and \ntechnologies\
    \ to solve specific limitations related to improv-\ning solar radiation capture,\
    \ particularly in winter, reducing \nexcessive temperatures when appropriate and\
    \ increasing \nwinter night-time temperatures in the most economically \nfeasible\
    \ way. But new technologies have to be economically \nsound as well as being environmentally\
    \ friendly (Montero et \nal., 2009).\nV o l u m e  8 3  |  I s s u e  5  |  O\

    \ services (Antón et \nal., 2005). LCA has been applied to greenhouse production\
    \ \nand the main factors responsible for environmental impact \nhave been identified,\
    \ particularly those related with the “bot-\ntleneck” of Mediterranean horticulture\
    \ (Antón et al., 2005; \nMartínez-Blanco et al., 2011).\nThe implementation of\
    \ integrated pest management \n(IPM) techniques contributes to greater food security.\
    \ The \nfact that the percentage of food samples free of residues is in-\ncreasing\
    \ points to the increasingly rational use of pesticides. \nHowever, the problem\
    \ of pests in agriculture is far from being \nsolved, and our guard must not be\
    \ lowered in this respect.\nStudies over the past two decades have provided import-\n\
    ant information on the trends in in protected cultivation in \nMediterranean climates\
    \ (e.g., Montero et al., 2009; Baudin et \nal., 2013; Tüzel and Oztekin, 2016;\
    \ Baeza and Kacira, 2017; \nDe Pascale et al., 2017). However, this industry is\
    \ constantly \nevolving and progress is continuous.  Thus, this paper dis-\ncusses\
    \ the most relevant recent developments in greenhouse \nstructure and climate\
    \ control, cropping and cultivation tech-\nniques (more specifically, grafting\
    \ and fruit-setting), water \nand nutrient management and environmental issues\
    \ includ-\ning LCA and IPM in protected cultivation in Mediterranean \nclimates.\n\
    Technological trends in greenhouse \nstructures and climate control\nNew greenhouse\
    \ structures\nThe goal for Mediterranean greenhouses is to use avail-\nable natural\
    \ resources, such as solar radiation  and tempera-\nture, wisely, while not relying\
    \ on external energy sources. \nTraditional greenhouses do not achieve such goal,\
    \ and so, re-\nsearch efforts have been focused on developing innovations \nin\
    \ three main critical aspects:\n- Improving solar radiation transmission in winter.\n\
    - Reducing excessive day-time temperature.\n- Increasing winter night-time temperature\
    \ without using \nexternal energy.\nProductivity is directly proportional to accumulated\
    \ solar \nradiation (Heuvelink, 2005), and so, greenhouse transmis-\nsivity to\
    \ solar radiation is important. Well-designed green-\nhouses have better light\
    \ transmission than traditional green-\nhouses, which have about 55% transmissivity.\
    \ For instance, \nSoriano et al. (2004) reported transmissivity of around 65%\
    \ \nin greenhouses with increased roof slope, and García et al. \n(2011) presented\
    \ transmissivity of 70% in a multi-tunnel \ngreenhouse in Southern Spain.\nSeveral\
    \ studies have been carried out to improve green-\nhouse transmissivity. Conclusions\
    \ show that, in terms of \nroof shape, a symmetrical flat roof with a 30° slope\
    \ is a good \ncompromise between transmissivity and construction costs, \nthere\
    \ being little benefit in increasing the roof slope or in \nerecting asymmetrical\
    \ greenhouses (Castilla, 2013). In terms \nof orientation, an east-west orientation\
    \ is preferred to north-\nsouth since it is more transmissive, although light\
    \ uniformity \nis better in N-S oriented greenhouses (Castilla, 2013).\nHernandez\
    \ (2009) compared the transmissivity of \nmulti-tunnel and flat roof greenhouses\
    \ with a similar slope \n(approximately 23°), finding no relevant differences\
    \ (only \n1.3% more transmission in winter for the curved shape). In-\nterestingly,\
    \ the study by Hernandez also showed the negative \neffects of flap roof ventilators\
    \ in light transmission. When \nroof ventilators are widely open, the roof geometry\
    \ becomes \nhorizontal in the ventilator area. This produces a reduction in \n\
    light transmission of as much as 7.4% in the winter months. \nRolling ventilators\
    \ do not have this problem, but flap vents \nare more efficient than rolling vents\
    \ in terms of air exchange.\nExperimental data show that, in terms of tomato yield,\
    \ \nthe improvement factor of a well-designed greenhouse com-\npared with a traditional\
    \ greenhouse can be up to three times \n(Raya-Ramallo, 2014). Such improvement\
    \ is mostly based on \nbetter light transmission and better ventilation.\nNatural\
    \ ventilation and other cooling methods\nNatural ventilation is the most essential\
    \ tool that growers \ncan use to maintain the greenhouse microclimate (tempera-\n\
    ture, humidity and CO2) within the best ranges for the crop. \nThe greenhouse\
    \ is essentially a solar collector and only a tiny \nfraction of the solar energy\
    \ entering the greenhouse is con-\nverted into dry matter by photosynthesis. Most\
    \ of the energy \nbecomes sensible or latent heat by means of plant transpira-\n\
    tion. When the sensible heat load is too high, the greenhouse \ntemperature becomes\
    \ too high and must be decreased by \nventilating (Vox et al., 2010; Giacomelli\
    \ et al., 2012) . When \nrelative humidity becomes too high, ventilation can decrease\
    \ \nit as external air is usually drier. Finally, natural ventilation \ncan avoid\
    \ CO2 depletion if the greenhouse CO2 concentration \nis lower than that of external\
    \ air.\nDuring the last decade, research has widened our knowl-\nedge on how to\
    \ optimize natural ventilation design in Medi-\nterranean greenhouses. Especially,\
    \ the extensive use of sim-\nulation tools like computational fluid dynamics has\
    \ allowed \nfor a better understanding of air exchange processes and \ntheir influence\
    \ on the homogeneity and internal air circula-\ntion inside the greenhouse as\
    \ well as the effect of different \ngeometrical aspects (including configuration\
    \ of the vents) of \nthe greenhouse on the efficacy of the air exchange through\
    \ \nnatural ventilation, as extensively reviewed by Norton et al. \n(2007) and\
    \ Bournet and Boulard (2010). Recent research has \nhighlighted the important\
    \ effect of wind direction in relation \nto the greenhouse vents on multispan\
    \ greenhouses (Teitel et \nal., 2008). When comparing windward with leeward venti-\n\
    lation, research indicates that for different types of green-\nhouses, when flap\
    \ roof vents are used, windward ventilation \nprovides higher ventilation rates\
    \ than leeward ventilation, \nalthough climate uniformity under windward ventilation\
    \ \nis lower than under leeward ventilation (Pérez-Parra et al., \n2004; Boulard\
    \ and Fatnassi, 2005; Ould Khaoua et al., 2006). \nIn other studies, parallel\
    \ wind was compared to perpendic-\nular wind. In most of these studies, higher\
    \ ventilation rates \nare obtained when vents are perpendicular to dominant \n\
    wind than when parallel (Shklyar and Arbel 2004; Hong et \nal., 2008).\nAnother\
    \ usual question is whether it is always advisable \nto combine sidewall and roof\
    \ vents. Many research studies \nhave been conducted in small greenhouses, such\
    \ as mo-\nno-span tunnels. In this type of greenhouse, research clearly \nindicates\
    \ that combining sidewall and roof vents maximiz-\nes air exchange (Bartzanas\
    \ and Kittas, 2001; Montero et al., \n2001; Bartzanas et al., 2004). Similarly,\
    \ in multispan green-\nhouses, when size is limited to a few spans, the combination\
    \ \nof sidewall and roof vents is also the most efficient (Kacira et \nal., 1998),\
    \ especially when wind velocity is low, where side-\nwall vent is critical (Baeza\
    \ et al., 2009). As the greenhouse \nbecomes larger, the relative contribution\
    \ of the sidewall vent \nto natural ventilation is minimized in relation to the\
    \ contri-\nbution of the roof vents (Kacira et al., 2004; Baeza, 2007). \nWhen\
    \ the ratio of roof vent area to sidewall vent is higher \nthan 5 (e.g., in large\
    \ greenhouses of more than 1 ha), little \n296\nE u r o p e a n  J o u r n a l\
    \  o f  H o r t i c u l t u r a l  S c i e n c e\nFernández et al.  |  Current\
    \ trends in protected cultivation in Mediterranean climates\nbenefit is obtained\
    \ from sidewall vents (Baeza, 2007). Other \naspects of the geometry, such as\
    \ greenhouse height of roof \nslop have also been analyzed by means of CFD. Baeza\
    \ (2007) \nshowed that increasing the greenhouse roof slope to 25–30° \nincreases\
    \ the ventilation rate by almost a factor of two and \nimproves cooling of the\
    \ crop area inside the greenhouse. \nAn important aspect that can greatly affect\
    \ the efficacy of \ngreenhouse natural ventilation is the presence of neighbor-\n\
    ing buildings. Using CFD, Gómez-Mataix et al. (2013) found \nout that neighboring\
    \ greenhouses or buildings have indeed \na strong effect by both decreasing the\
    \ ventilation rate and \nchanging the internal airflow patterns. Ideally, greenhouse\
    \ \nshould be free of obstacles for at a least 20 m all around.  \nOf the other\
    \ cooling methods, shading (e.g., whitewash) \nis the most used in the Mediterranean\
    \ region, where it is \npreferred to screens due to its lower price. The challenge\
    \ for \nshading is to develop more efficient selective shading (i.e., \nNIR reflecting)\
    \ and or double purpose screens (shading and \nenergy saving). Evaporative cooling\
    \ systems (fogging, pad \nand fan, etc.) can consume large amounts of good quality\
    \ wa-\nter which is a very scarce resource in many regions of the \nMediterranean,\
    \ so their use is only justified in high-value \ncrops or nurseries. Active cooling\
    \ using cold water (chillers) \nis simply too expensive to be considered in the\
    \ Mediterra-\nnean region.\nGreenhouse cladding materials\nThe vast majority of\
    \ Mediterranean greenhouses rely on \nplastic film covers, as they are cheaper\
    \ than rigid materials \nand adaptable to all kinds of structures. Polyethylene\
    \ is by \nfar the most commonly used material. For growers, the op-\ntical properties\
    \ of the film are the most important, followed \nby mechanical properties and\
    \ durability (Baeza and López, \n2012; Papadakis et al., 2000). For growers in\
    \ the Mediter-\nranean, durability of the plastic is a major issue, as the price\
    \ \nof replacing plastic is quite high. At present, most commer-\ncial greenhouses\
    \ use plastic film with additives that stabi-\nlize them against UV, and chemicals,\
    \ such as sulphur and \nchloride, which can extend their use to a maximum of four\
    \ \ngrowing seasons (Schettini and Vox, 2012; Schettini et al., \n2014; Adelhafidi\
    \ et al., 2015). It is a challenge to produce \nmore lasting materials, such as\
    \ fluoropolymeric, without in-\ncreasing the price (Stefani et al., 2007). The\
    \ beneficial effect \nof diffuse light on greenhouse yield is a well proven fact\
    \ (e.g., \nElings et al., 2012). However, for most commonly used films, \nhigh\
    \ haze is obtained at the expense of a drop in hemispher-\nical light transmission.\
    \ Thus, obtaining films that combine \na large hemispherical transmission and\
    \ high haze at lower \nprice than existing materials (e.g., diffusive ETFE) is\
    \ a major \nchallenge (Hemming et al., 2008). One of the disadvantages \nof plastic\
    \ films used as greenhouse covering in comparison \nto glass is their hydrophobic\
    \ behaviour, which leads to un-\ndesirable drop-like condensation (Gbiorczyk et\
    \ al., 2002). So \nfar, this problem has been partially solved by adding anti-fog\
    \ \nadditives, such as non-ionic surfactants. The anti-fog effect \nquality changes\
    \ during the lifetime of the film, because the \nsurfactants are extracted by\
    \ the condensed water and the an-\nti-fog effect disappears usually over two agricultural\
    \ seasons \n(Espi et al., 2006). A big challenge for the future is to pro-\nduce\
    \ a PE film with stable anti-dripping properties through-\nout the life of the\
    \ film (https://www.google.com/patents/\nWO2017045199A1?cl=en). In the Mediterranean\
    \ region, \ndouble inflated polyethylene covers are still widely used, \nfor energy\
    \ saving purposes and structural reasons, despite \nof the large decrease in PAR\
    \ transmission which leads to a \nlarge decrease of yield (e.g., Papadopoulos\
    \ and Hao, 1997). \nA promising development in this field could be the devel-\n\
    opment of PE films with large air bubbles that can perform \nbetter (in terms\
    \ of thermal insulation and PAR transmission) \nthan double inflated PE (https://www.solawrapfilms.com/).\
    \ \nOther challenges include the development of more specific \nUV filters that\
    \ limit infestation by pests without affecting the \nactivity of pollinators (Baeza\
    \ and Lopez, 2012). Finally, cover-\ning materials in the future should incorporate\
    \ filters that can \nbe activated (switchable) to modify almost instantaneously\
    \ \nthe properties of the cover, and adapt it to the instantaneous \nrequirements\
    \ of the crops. The trigger can be the tempera-\nture of the material or an applied\
    \ voltage, among other pos-\nsibilities. An interesting development in this field\
    \ would be a \nswitchable filter (e.g., activated by electricity) capable of ac-\n\
    tivating high NIR reflection, while keeping PAR reflection as \nlow as possible.\
    \ In this way, NIR would be transmitted during \nthe cold periods to enhance passive\
    \ thermal energy storage, \nand reflected during the warm period as selective\
    \ shading \n(Khandelwal et al., 2016). Another interesting possibility \nwould\
    \ be switchable filters capable of reflecting thermal in-\nfra-red radiation during\
    \ cold winter nights, preventing the \nenergy stored in the greenhouse from being\
    \ lost, but trans-\nmitting this radiation during the daytime in the warm season\
    \ \nto help cool the greenhouse (El Mouedden et al., 2012). \nEnergy storage in\
    \ passive greenhouses\nGreenhouses have very little thermal inertia; as soon as\
    \ \nthe sun sets, the greenhouse air temperature drops quickly \n(Piscia, 2012).\
    \ As a consequence, the winter greenhouse mi-\ncroclimate is usually suboptimal\
    \ due to low night tempera-\ntures. Besides, active heating is usually uneconomical\
    \ (Stang-\nhellini et al., 2016). Three major approaches can be followed \nto\
    \ increase night-time temperature by passive means: using \n(internal or external)\
    \ screens, closing the greenhouse vents \nas much as possible and increasing the\
    \ greenhouse thermal \ninertia.\nScreens act as a barrier for the exchange of\
    \ far infrared \nradiation (FIR). Such FIR exchange controls the energy losses\
    \ \nfrom the greenhouse at night (Baille et al., 2006). Based on \nCFD simulations,\
    \ Piscia (2012) observed that an air chamber \nwas created above the screen, which\
    \ insulated the crop area \nfrom the colder roof. Temperature gains in screened\
    \ unheat-\ned greenhouses range from 2 to 3°C for clear skies to almost \nzero\
    \ for overcast sky. Similar effect (up to 3°C) is produced by \nan external movable\
    \ screen generally used for shading (Mon-\ntero et al., 2013).\nSemi-closed greenhouses\
    \ aim to have minimal winter \nventilation to increase the greenhouse mean daily\
    \ tempera-\nture. This involves a risk of CO2 depletion (which can be \ncompensated\
    \ with CO2 enrichment) and producing excessive \nhumidity (Baptista, 2007). Some\
    \ innovative plastic-covered \ngreenhouses are constructed to collect condensation,\
    \ but \nin some cases, they cannot avoid dew formation on fruits, \nwhich, due\
    \ to their thermal inertia, remain below the dew \npoint temperature during the\
    \ morning hours.\nThermal storage in the soil could mitigate day/night fluc-\n\
    tuations, lengthen the growing season and increase produc-\ntivity (Vanthoor et\
    \ al., 2009). Mulching is the simplest way to \nincrease greenhouse thermal inertia.\
    \ Bonachela et al. (2012) \nobserved a positive effect on soil heat flux and ground\
    \ net \nradiation using black mulch, although the effect was stronger \nin root\
    \ temperature than air temperature.\nWater-filled polyethylene sleeves represent\
    \ a passive \ntechnique, and were proposed in the eighties. The water \nV o l\

    \  |  Current trends in protected cultivation in Mediterranean climates\nsleeves\
    \ act as a solar collector, absorbing solar energy during \nthe day and releasing\
    \ heat at night. Particularly in the earli-\nest stages of plant growth, increases\
    \ in greenhouse air tem-\nperature of up to 3°C have been reported. A study conducted\
    \ \nin Northern Greece (Ntinas et al., 2015) obtained a 10.8% \nincrease in tomato\
    \ production as well as an increase in anti-\noxidant capacity of fruit in a greenhouse\
    \ with water sleeves. \nThis positive result could be due to the lower air temperature\
    \ \nin the greenhouse with water sleeves during day-time, since \nduring the day,\
    \ part of the solar energy entering the green-\nhouse was used to heat the water\
    \ sleeves. Previous studies \nreported lower levels of antioxidant compounds in\
    \ tomato as \nthe daily temperature increased (Riga et al., 2008).\n Thermal screens,\
    \ semi-closed greenhouses and in-\ncreased thermal inertia produce limited (but\
    \ important) \nimprovements in the greenhouse night-time climate, and the \ncoupling\
    \ of such approaches may show interesting synergies. \nWhen passive techniques\
    \ are used together, the greenhouse \nclimate can be close to that of an active\
    \ optimal greenhouse, \nbut without using direct energy for heating.\nCrops and\
    \ cultivation techniques\nVegetables crops\nCucurbitaceae and Solanaceae are the\
    \ predominant spe-\ncies in cold greenhouses, because they are widely consumed\
    \ \nand comparatively well adapted to the unsteady climatic con-\nditions. This\
    \ situation normally results in monoculture and \ntherefore there is a need for\
    \ crop diversification. This could \nbe enhanced through intraspecific genetic\
    \ diversity, the cul-\ntivation of new, alternative crops, the cultivation of\
    \ mixed \ncrops and crop rotation (Tüzel and Oztekin, 2017). The most \nsignificant\
    \ example of diversification through intraspecific \ngenetic diversity concerns\
    \ the tomato. In a well-provisioned \nmarket it is possible to find a wide range\
    \ of tomato types, \nwith diverse colours at ripening; some of them are new cul-\n\
    tivars resembling old heirloom varieties (Tüzel and Oztekin, \n2017). This diversification\
    \ is also possible to find in many \nother cultivated greenhouse-grown vegetables.\
    \ Thus, grow-\ners produce large varieties of pepper, eggplants of different \n\
    sizes, shapes and colours, different types of melon, summer \nsquash of different\
    \ colours and shapes (whose flowers can \nbe sold), seedless and small sized watermelon,\
    \ short, medi-\num and long cucumber types, yellow and variegated green \nbean\
    \ cultivars, lettuces of attractive colours, textures and \nshapes and so on.\
    \ Special mention should be made of min-\niaturisation, e.g., miniature vegetables.\
    \ Besides well-known \nsmall tomatoes, snack sweet peppers and cucumbers (sweet-\n\
    er versions of their larger fruits) are a healthy alternative to \nsweet or savoury\
    \ snacks. The distribution of these snack \nvegetables though refrigerated “healthy\
    \ vending” machines \nis already a fact and promises to spread. In addition, as\
    \ con-\nsumers are looking for softer textures in prepared salad mix-\nes, baby-sized\
    \ leafy vegetables have been one of the most \npromising fresh-cut developments.\
    \ Finally, organic vegetable \nproduction is another way to increase crop diversification.\n\
    Finding new crops is not easy, although a large set of \nwild-growing species\
    \ used in traditional Mediterranean dish-\nes deserves more attention (Molina\
    \ et al., 2016). The present \ntendency towards the recovery of food traditions\
    \ and the \nneed for product diversification may also offer opportunities \nfor\
    \ new crop domestication (Egea-Gilabert et al., 2013). In \nthis last respect,\
    \ some species which used to be cultivated \nand which have fallen out of fashion\
    \ are being reintroduced.\nOf special interest is the importance that brands are\
    \ tak-\ning in some markets. This usually involves closed framework \nagreements\
    \ between a seed company, which offers a special \nproduct, and vegetable producers\
    \ or traders, who can pro-\nduce it exclusively, normally guaranteeing a high\
    \ quality. \nSome of the most known cases are Kumato and Monterosa \ntomatoes,\
    \ Fashion seedless watermelon, Sweet Palermo \npepper, etc. Furthermore, in the\
    \ case of melon, some brands \nwere established in Spain some decades ago, usually\
    \ offering \na high quality toad skin melon. These brands belong to ag-\nricultural\
    \ companies, which choose the cultivar and impose \nproduction techniques to ensure\
    \ a good taste and sweetness \nof the product all year round.\nBerries and fruit\
    \ tree crops\nAmong the most notable aspects of species grown in pro-\ntected\
    \ cultivation in recent decades has been the incorpora-\ntion of berries and fruit\
    \ tree crops, in  some cases due to the \nlow profitability of certain vegetable\
    \ crops, and in others, as \na way of diversifying production and consequently\
    \ reducing \ncommercial risks. For example, in SW Spain, the cultivation \nof\
    \ berries, such as raspberry, blueberry and blackberry, has \nincreased in recent\
    \ years at the expense of strawberry cul-\ntivation, which reflects a commitment\
    \ to crop diversifica-\ntion. The cultivation of fruit crops in the greenhouses\
    \ aims \nto extend their production to other areas, increase yield and \nquality\
    \ and modify their growth cycle. Particularly, the cul-\ntivation of stone fruit\
    \ trees has some additional advantages, \nsince early production increases the\
    \ possibility of export \n(Tüzel and Oztekin, 2015). In this case, crops are grown\
    \ in \nthe open air until their chilling requirements have been sat-\nisfied and\
    \ then are covered by a cladding material, bringing \nforward their yield by some\
    \ weeks. In other species with \nchilling requirements such as berries, these\
    \ requirements \nare normally satisfied in the nursery, storing plant material\
    \ \nat low temperature or growing the seedlings in cool places. \nIn addition,\
    \ some sub-tropical and tropical fruit trees (man-\ngo, papaya, pitaya, etc.)\
    \ are now grown in the greenhouse, \nshortening their unproductive period, bringing\
    \ forward their \nproduction and increasing the number of harvests. In green-\n\
    houses, some fruit trees are cultivated inside screenhouses \nor under horizontal\
    \ screens. Films and nets to match specific \nrequirements are increasingly used,\
    \ particularly for improv-\ning effects on vegetative growth or fruit production.\
    \ In this \nlast respect, designing innovative covering materials, with \nspecific\
    \ radiometric properties to meet the requirements of \ngrowers, is increasingly\
    \ necessary (Schettini et al., 2011).\nFloricultural and ornamental crops\nThis\
    \ sector is very diverse and includes the production of \nseveral crops. In recent\
    \ years, cut flower production in pro-\ntected cultivation has gradually increased\
    \ in importance in \nmany countries. Among the cut flowers, carnation, rose and\
    \ \nchrysanthemum are the more widely grown crops, followed \nby gerbera, orchids,\
    \ lilies, etc. Ornamental crops have also in-\ncreased in recent years, particularly\
    \ in developed countries; \nin this case, at the expense of reducing the area\
    \ dedicated \nto cut flower cultivation. The optimal growing conditions \npresented\
    \ by subtropical or tropical regions for cut flower \ncultivation, their low production\
    \ costs and progress in post-\nharvest techniques have also contributed to such\

    \ c e\nFernández et al.  |  Current trends in protected cultivation in Mediterranean\
    \ climates\nGrafting\nGrafting is largely used in Cucurbitaceae and Solanaceae\
    \ \nspecies and is rapidly spreading and expanding all over the \nworld. This\
    \ technique produces  plants that are more vigor-\nous, the initial objective\
    \ being protection against soil-borne \ndiseases and soil fatigue provoked by\
    \ successive cropping \n(Lee et al., 2010). Accordingly, the use of grafted plants\
    \ per-\nmits some cultivars to be grown in non-disinfected soils fol-\nlowing\
    \ the banning of methyl-bromide as fumigant (López-\nMarín et al., 2013). The\
    \ purpose of grafting also has been \ngreatly expanded to include various types\
    \ of stress tolerance, \nincreasing the yield and duration of crops and enhancing\
    \ \ncrop quality. Nowadays, rootstock breeding for vegetable \ncrops includes\
    \ other desirable traits such as compatibili-\nty with the scion, increased productivity\
    \ and quality under \nstressful environments and improved use of soil, water and\
    \ \nfertilizer resources (López-Marín et al., 2017). Accordingly, \ngrafting is\
    \ frequently used as an alternative to breeding in \nhorticultural crops since\
    \ suitable and compatible rootstocks \ncan improve plant performance by increasing\
    \ both nutrient \nuptake and utilization efficiency (Martínez-Andujar, 2017).\
    \ \nFinally, the use of grafted plants can affect product quality, \nan aspect\
    \ recently reviewed by Kyriacou et al. (2017) who \nprovided an updated critical\
    \ review of scientific advances.\nFruit-setting\nThe yield of most fruit-bearing\
    \ vegetables depends on \nthe success of fruit set, which is linked to pollination,\
    \ particu-\nlarly in a greenhouse. Certain insects are increasingly used to \n\
    improve fruit setting, thus reducing the practice of chemical \nsprays, which\
    \ are commonly used to ensure the fruiting of \ndifferent crops. The limited air\
    \ movement in the greenhouse \nand the temperature and humidity conditions, which\
    \ in some \nperiods do not allow adequate pollen production and viabil-\nity,\
    \ encourage the use of insects for pollination purposes. In-\ndeed, in tomato,\
    \ melon, watermelon, summer squash, mango \nand berries, this is already a widely\
    \ used technique because \nof the reduced cost of insect pollinators compared\
    \ to other \ntechniques to improve fructification. Nevertheless, there is \na\
    \ continuing need for inducing parthenocarpy in vegeta-\nble crop plants, which\
    \ is a highly desirable trait (Dhatt and \nKaur, 2016). Currently, most commercial\
    \ cucumber, banana \nand pineapple cultivars  grown are parthenocarpic. Other\
    \ \nvegetables species, such as tomato, sweet pepper, eggplant \nand summer squash,\
    \ also include parthenocarpic cultivars, \nalthough their commercial use is not\
    \ extensive. In addition, \ntriploid cultivars are widely used for seedless watermelon\
    \ \nproduction (Sarria, 2017), although in this case a diploid pol-\nliniser cultivar\
    \ is also needed.\nWater and nutrient management\nWater quality and management\n\
    Water quality is critical to successful horticulture produc-\ntion in the greenhouse\
    \ (De Pascale et al., 2013). Knowledge of \navailable water quality allows water\
    \ treatments to be planned, \nthus avoiding yield limitations associated with\
    \ poor plant \ngrowth, staining, clogged watering pipes and other undesirable\
    \ \neffects. Under commercial conditions, irrigation water comes \nfrom a number\
    \ of different sources and therefore the intrinsic \nquality varies. Although\
    \ it is not possible to indicate a standard \nanalysis type for every condition,\
    \ analytical testing should be \nregularly performed to avoid losses associated\
    \ with the vari-\nations in water composition that sometimes occur. Further-\n\
    more, daily checking the pH and EC of the water circulating in \nthe greenhouse\
    \ is recommended in order to intervene prompt-\nly in the case of unexpected changes\
    \ in the contents of salts dis-\nsolved in the irrigation water. In Mediterranean\
    \ coastal areas \nsalty ions build up over time   because of high temperatures\
    \ \nand evapotranspiration, poor water quality and the interaction \nof seawater\
    \ with irrigation water; leading to increases in water \nsalinity. Accordingly,\
    \ in the longer term,  it will be necessary to \nimprove water quality, which\
    \ can be achieved by water desali-\nnation, pH correction, acidification, the\
    \ addition of bicarbon-\nates or filtration (De Pascale et al., 2011).\nOnce quality\
    \ features for allowing plant cultivation are \nset, sustainable irrigation management\
    \ practices have to \nbe addressed in order to preserve water sources, improve\
    \ \nyield and reduce costs. Achieving high water use efficiency \nin greenhouse\
    \ production is possible through optimal con-\ntrol of both cropping practices\
    \ and environmental parame-\nters (De Pascale et al., 2011). Among irrigation\
    \ systems, the \nhighest efficiencies are associated with micro-irrigation, e.g.,\
    \ \nby operating a slow and regular application of water operat-\ned at low pressures\
    \ (<2 bars) directly to the root zone. Mi-\ncro-irrigation is operated through\
    \ a network of valves, pipes, \ntubing and emitters, and special care should be\
    \ devoted to \navoid clogging of the nozzles (e.g., by adding a filter upstream\
    \ \nin the distribution line or rinsing the system with chlorine, \nnitric of\
    \ phosphoric acid) (De Pascale et al., 2013). Irrigation \nscheduling determines\
    \ the amount of water applied to the \ncrop (i.e., irrigation dose) and the timing\
    \ of application (i.e., \nirrigation frequency). To improve irrigation scheduling,\
    \ spe-\ncific care should be devoted to the determination of both ir-\nrigation\
    \ dose and frequency, taking into account soil or sub-\nstrate hydraulic properties,\
    \ crop species, water quality and \nirrigation system, which determine the depletion\
    \ (%) of the \navailable water allowable in the root zone and the scheduling \n\
    coefficient. To translate into practice, these calculations re-\nquire the direct\
    \ assessment of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) \nor the direct measurement of the\
    \ moisture content in the \ngrowing medium with tensiometers or capacitance sensors.\
    \ \nIn recent years, innovation in soil moisture sensors has led to \nthe diffusion\
    \ of professional decision support systems (DSS) \nable to ensure optimal irrigation\
    \ efficiency (e.g., Passam et \nal., 2001; Goumopoulos, 2012). Although the availability\
    \ of \ncheap, easy-to-use commercial applications is still limited, \nuseful protocols\
    \ are available for guiding growers toward ef-\nficient greenhouse water management.\
    \ Researches have ad-\ndressed how sensors should be positioned, their distribution\
    \ \nwithin the rhizosphere, and at different depths and lateral \ndistances in\
    \ order to control the wetting bulbs resulting from \ndrip irrigation (Pardossi\
    \ et al., 2009).\nSpecific considerations need to be made when plan-\nning irrigation\
    \ for soilless culture; in this case automatical-\nly controlled irrigation systems\
    \ are essential. These may be \ncontrolled through the inclusion of affordable\
    \ and reliable \ntools – such as weighing gutter or tray systems – for the pre-\n\
    cise determination of ETc (Orgaz et al., 2005). Furthermore, \nthe daily control\
    \ of the EC and pH of drainage water and \nmonthly monitoring of the same variables\
    \ in the substrate \nare recommended, especially when poor-quality irrigation\
    \ \nwater is used (De Pascale et al., 2013). Finally, for hydropon-\nic production,\
    \ a scheduling coefficient of no more than 1.5 \n(Irrigation/ETc) should be maintained,\
    \ thus providing a 33% \ndrain fraction.\nSoil fertility and plant nutrition\n\
    Providing general recommendations concerning fertil-\nizer requirements is a difficult\
    \ task, since plant needs are \nV o l u m e  8 3  |  I s s u e  5  |  O c t o\
    \ b e r  2 0 1 8\n299\nFernández et al.  |  Current trends in protected cultivation\
    \ in Mediterranean climates\naffected by cropping systems and environmental conditions.\
    \ \nNevertheless, some general rules apply. Therefore fertilizer \nrecommendation\
    \ systems need to estimate this input (Ep-\nstein and Bloom, 2005). The application\
    \ of nitrogen needs  \nspecial care in order to optimize production and reduce\
    \ loss-\nes to the environment (Soto el al., 2015). Optimal fertilizer \nmanagement\
    \ ensures unrestricted growth and a yield that \nis close to the maximum potential,\
    \ while minimizing losses \nto the environment. Similarly, vegetable quality is\
    \ at its best \nwhen fertilizer supply matches crop requirements through-\nout\
    \ the growing season. Estimating the crop’s nutrient re-\nquirement is very important\
    \ for both economic and environ-\nmental reasons (Gianquinto et al., 2013).\n\
    Nutritional imbalances can be prevented by accurate \nmonitoring of the crop mineral\
    \ status. This, traditionally, \nis either performed visually in the crop or by\
    \ means of soil \nanalyses. However, although general recommendations \nsuggest\
    \ repeating chemical tests during the growing sea-\nson (analysing the mineral\
    \ composition of the soil but also, \noccasionally, of leaf tissues, growing medium\
    \ and nutrient \nsolution), these analyses are generally expensive and time \n\
    consuming. Consequently, their replication during the crop \nseason is still rare\
    \ in commercial vegetable crop production. \nNevertheless, recent research suggests\
    \ that, for soil crops at \nleast, petiole sap (NO3\n--N) is the most useful because\
    \ of its \nsensitivity to crop N status and because it can be rapidly an-\nalysed\
    \ on the farm (Peña-Fleitas et al., 2015). Real-time es-\ntimation of growth –\
    \ and therefore of nutrient uptake – may \nbe feasible through monitoring crop\
    \ water uptake or plant \ntranspiration.\nAmong recent innovations, a blended\
    \ strategy combining \nmodelling and monitoring approaches is   growing in impor-\n\
    tance. Crop monitoring tools are increasingly used for rap-\nidly obtaining indications\
    \ of the actual nutrient status of the \nplant. Collected data are then transformed\
    \ (either directly by \nthe tool or by the operator) into vegetation indices (VIs).\
    \ In \nthe last decade, research has repeatedly addressed the appli-\ncation of\
    \ optical tools for proper nitrogen management, for \ninstance, in tomato (Gianquinto\
    \ et al., 2011; Granados et al., \n2013), melon (Gianquinto et al., 2009; Gallardo\
    \ et al., 2011; \nPadilla et al., 2014), and cucumber (Padilla et al., 2017).\n\
    Soilless culture  \nSoilless culture refers to the cultivation of plants in soil-\n\
    less systems in which plant roots grow either in growing \nmedia in bags, containers\
    \ or troughs as “substrate culture”, \nor directly in nutrient solution. known\
    \ as “water culture” or \n“hydroponics”, including deepwater and deepflow culture,\
    \ \nnutrient film technique (NFT), aeroponic, floating systems \n(Raviv and Lieth,\
    \ 2007; Savvas et al., 2013; Popsimonova et \nal., 2016) or the more recent so-called\
    \ New Growing System \n(NGS) (Selma et al., 2012).\nIn recent decades, the adoption\
    \ of nutrient solutions for \nthe optimization of crop nutrition has followed\
    \ an increasing \ntrend also in the Mediterranean (Muñoz et al., 2008), while\
    \ \ncultivation in substrates has been characterized by a shift \nfrom open- to\
    \ closed-cycle cultivation systems, involving \nreuse of the drainage solution,\
    \ resulting in improved water \nand fertilizer use (Pardossi et al., 2006). Accordingly,\
    \ closed \nsystems can substantially reduce the pollution of water re-\nsources\
    \ by nitrates and phosphates present in fertigation ef-\nfluents, and contribute\
    \ to an appreciable reduction in water \nand fertilizer consumption (Savvas, 2002).\
    \ Switching over \nto closed cultivation systems has provided satisfactory evi-\n\
    dences concerning yield and quality preservation, although \nspecial care needs\
    \ to be devoted to avoiding high salt concen-\ntrations building up   in the recycled\
    \ nutrient solution, which \nmay occur due to the entrance of salt ions and water\
    \ at high-\ner ratios (concentrations in the irrigation water) than the \ncorresponding\
    \ ion to-water uptake ratios (Thompson et al., \n2007; Sonneveld and Voogt, 2009).\
    \ Furthermore, the reuse \nof nutrient solution effluents may be associated with\
    \ the risk \nof disease spreading via the recycled leachate, so that solu-\ntion\
    \ disinfection systems need to be installed (Chekli et al., \n2017). In practice,\
    \ recirculating nutrient solutions are gener-\nally disinfected by chemical treatment\
    \ and UV radiation but \nare renewed from time to time (Wohanka, 2002; Possimon-\n\
    ova et al., 2016).\nThe main advantages of soilless culture are the absence \n\
    of soil-borne pathogens, safe and environmentally friendly \nalternative to soil\
    \ disinfection, the saving of water and nutri-\nent supplies, higher yields and\
    \ quality, earlier harvests, the \navoidance of soil tillage and preparation.\
    \ However, higher \ninstallation costs and the technical skills and expertise\
    \ re-\nquired often constrain the diffusion of soilless horticulture \nin countries\
    \ bordering the Mediterranean Basin (Raviv and \nLieth, 2007; Gul, 2013; Savvas\
    \ et al., 2013).\nSoilless culture can be carried out in greenhouses locat-\n\
    ed in favourable climatic conditions without any addition-\nal heating. However,\
    \ in the last decade soilless cultivation \nhas spread to areas where geothermal\
    \ energy is available, \ne.g., Turkey, where it has been adopted in high-tech,\
    \ well-\nequipped greenhouses (Gul, 2013; Tüzel and Oztekin, 2016). \nIn recent\
    \ years, production practices are increasingly carried \nout with machines as\
    \ an “unmanned working model” in some \nsoilless greenhouses.\nCultivation involving\
    \ perlite, rockwool and cocopeat \nin containers, bags or slabs is a growing trend\
    \ in vegetable \nproduction. Water culture has not been very common but \nrecently\
    \ the production of new crops, such as leafy vegeta-\nbles (lettuce, rocket, spinach,\
    \ lamb’s lettuce, watercress, etc.) \nand herbs (parsley, basil, oregano, thyme,\
    \ dill, etc.) in NFT, \naeroponics and floating, which allows more plants per\
    \ unit \narea and cleaner crops, has started to increase. Recently, too, \n“vertical\
    \ farming systems” in tower shapes with aeroponic \nmethods have started to be\
    \ applied. This system provides \n10 times more plants per unit area, a 50% reduction\
    \ in the \nharvest period, water and fertilizer savings, clean produc-\ntion and\
    \ all year round production. In recent years, there \nhas also been increased\
    \ interest in growing strawberry and \nleafy vegetables by substrate culture especially\
    \ in “A-shape” \nor “multy-storey” systems. Finally, aquaponics in soilless cul-\n\
    tivation is little used in Mediterranean countries. \nEnvironmental issues in\
    \ protected \ncultivation\nEnvironmental impact of greenhouse production\nDespite\
    \ using resources more efficiently, greenhouse \nproduction is often perceived\
    \ as an artificial process, charac-\nterized by the low nutritional quality of\
    \ its product and the \nheavy use of chemical inputs (Muñoz et al., 2008).\nIn\
    \ order to improve the systems involved, the principles \nof cleaner production\
    \ also need to be applied to greenhouses. \nThe five main components of cleaner\
    \ production are related \nto conserving raw materials, water and energy, eliminating\
    \ \ntoxic and dangerous raw materials, and reducing the quan-\ntity and toxicity\
    \ of all emissions and wastes at source during \nthe production process (Antón\
    \ and Muñoz, 2013).\nFor unheated greenhouses, Antón et al. (2005) evaluated \n\
    300\nE u r o p e a n  J o u r n a l  o f  H o r t i c u l t u r a l  S c i e n\

    \ climates\ntomato production under a Mediterranean greenhouse, iden-\ntifying\
    \ the structure of the greenhouse, fertilizers, auxiliary \nequipment and waste\
    \ as the most impacting points. For pro-\ntected crops, structural components\
    \ may account for nearly \n30% of environmental impact categories such as resource\
    \ \ndepletion and global warming. Following this work, Antón \net al. (2014) developed\
    \ equations to provide an easy way to \ncalculate the quantity of materials used\
    \ to make greenhous-\nes of different dimensions, thus resulting in more accurate\
    \ \ncalculation of the impacts of greenhouse production systems.\nAs regards the\
    \ environment, tomato production in a \nheated greenhouse in the north of Italy\
    \ implies an energy \nconsumption of 95.5 MJ eq kg-1 of tomato (Almeida et \n\
    al., 2014), compared with 1–4 MJ eq kg-1 of tomato in \nunheated greenhouses.\
    \ Heating systems represent one of \nthe fundamental reasons why the environmental\
    \ impact \nof production in France is greater than that of production \nin greenhouse\
    \ without heating in Morocco, including the \ntransport of the produce to France\
    \ (Payen et al., 2015).\nIn terms of fertilizer use, Muñoz et al. (2008) demon-\n\
    strated that the N concentration in the nutrient solution can \nbe reduced without\
    \ affecting production in a soilless tomato \ncrop grown in a Mediterranean greenhouse.\
    \ This reduction \nimplies a decrease of 70% of the nitrogen leaving the system\
    \ \nthrough leaching and a 60% decrease in the potential impact \nof eutrophication,\
    \ and 50% decrease in the potential impact \nof climate change. In addition, closed\
    \ or re-circulating hy-\ndroponic systems can significantly reduce fertilizer\
    \ run-off \nand reduce the environmental impact (Antón et al., 2005). \nNevertheless,\
    \ closed systems need greater investment in in-\nstallations and crop control.\
    \ So, their economic viability is a \nquestion of debate in Southern Europe.\n\
    An alternative way to reduce fertilizer use and, hence, \ndecrease the pollutant\
    \ potential of leachates in soilless crops, \nis to collect and reuse lixiviates\
    \ for a second soil crop in \ngreenhouse or open air; in this way, a reduction\
    \ in emissions \nto water of up to 50% can be achieved, and any impact on \nglobal\
    \ warming is lessened (Muñoz et al., 2012). Besides, in \na recent study, the\
    \ reuse of lixiviates for a second crop in the \nopen air allowed a sequence of\
    \ outdoor crops to be fertigated  \nwithout having to add more water and fertilizers\
    \ than those \nalready contained in the leachates (Muñoz et al., 2017). \nRelated\
    \ to the emissions associated with soilless crops, recent \nstudies show that\
    \ for lettuce crops, the estimated emissions \nare twice the level of real emissions,\
    \ which would lead to an \noverestimation of the impact of more than 6% (Llorach\
    \ et \nal., 2017). Martínez-Blanco et al. (2011) concluded that the \nreplacement\
    \ of a fraction of the mineral fertilizer dosage with \ncompost would be a good\
    \ agronomical and environmental \nsolution for greenhouse tomato soil production.\n\
    Finally, to evaluate the impact of residues generated \nin greenhouse production,\
    \ Antón et al. (2005) revealed \nthat source segregation followed by the composting\
    \ of \nbiodegradable matter was the best way of managing waste \nto improve impact\
    \ assessment. The segregation of non-yield \nbiomass and its composting reduced\
    \ the environmental \nburden for most of the impact categories considered. In\
    \ \naddition, one of the environmental problems associated with \nthis system\
    \ of production, especially for soil crops in unheated \ngreenhouses, is the large\
    \ amount of plastics used – hence \nthe importance of the proper management of\
    \ this waste in \na sustainable way (Antón et al., 2005). Among the solutions\
    \ \nto this problem in Southern Spain is the recycling of such \nwaste to produce\
    \ other plastic commodities, such as rubbish \nbags, pots, boxes for handling\
    \ vegetables, etc. (mechanical \nrecycling) and the valorisation of waste as energy\
    \ source, \nwhich is achieved by burning the plastic waste in a nearby \npower\
    \ plant for the generation of electricity (Montero \net al., 2014). The use of\
    \ satellite data for geo-referencing \nagricultural plastic wastes would allow\
    \ waste managers \nto use this information to decide the position of collection\
    \ \ncentres and waste route maps (Lanorte et al., 2017). \nIntegrated pest management\n\
    Pests and diseases in protected crops are changing as \nfast as the new cultivation\
    \ methods are introduced, so new \ncontrol measures are required. The high value\
    \ of greenhouse \ncrops justifies the use of expensive control measures, and is\
    \ \nnormally accepted by growers.\nSeveral years ago, management strategies changed\
    \ toward \nintegrated pest management (IPM) as a way of reconciling the \ncontrol\
    \ of harmful agents and sustainability, bearing in mind \nconsumer health and\
    \ safety and the protection and respect \nof the environment. Many governments\
    \ are implementing \nnational plans aimed at reducing the pesticide use (Hillocks,\
    \ \n2012).\nThe most innovative techniques for the management of \npests and diseases\
    \ in protected crops can be divided into \npreventive and curative, as shown below.\
    \ Many of these \ntechniques, which are alternatives to chemical control, \nhave\
    \ only a partial effect on pests and diseases and must be \ncombined with other\
    \ means to provide effective control.\nPreventive measures: limiting the invasion\
    \ of pests and \npathogens\n- Legislation forbidding or restricting the importation\
    \ of \nparticular plants from infected areas. That is extremely \nimportant in\
    \ order to prevent or diminish the risk of exotic \npest species becoming endemic\
    \ (Hanafi, 2013).\n- Strategies like purchasing healthy seeds, or eliminating\
    \ the \nsources of primary inoculum within and close to the crop.\n- The use of\
    \ insect-proof nets, on roof vents or covering the \ngreenhouses to prevent infestation\
    \ by establishing a phys-\nical barrier between the invading pest and the crop.\
    \ The \nmesh size should exclude the insect and at the same time \nallow airflow\
    \ so that achieving this balance is not easy. \nAmong the main pests that can\
    \ be prevented are white-\nflies, aphids and miners. In addition, there are anti-insect\
    \ \nmeshes that can incorporate insecticides or repellents, so \nthey reduce the\
    \ passage of insects to the interior while al-\nlowing better ventilation. These\
    \ barriers have been shown \nto be effective for the control of aphid-transmitted\
    \ viruses \n(Dader et al., 2014).\n- Coloured plastics, besides constituting a\
    \ physical barrier, \nmodify the behaviour of the insect by altering its vision.\
    \ In \naddition, coloured meshes can be used to completely cover \nmacro structures,\
    \ micro (low) tunnels and greenhouses, \nresulting in a double mechanism of action\
    \ on the insect.\n- Solarization can be used to decrease the amount of inocu-\n\
    lum, thus affecting the viability of species like Pythium spp. \nand Phytophthora\
    \ spp. Also, the use of buried manure and \nits variants (biofumigation) is regarded\
    \ as an alternative \nto the use of methyl bromide. The combination of biofumi-\n\
    gation with solarization (biosolarization) in areas of high \ninsolation has obtained\
    \ similar result to methyl bromide \n(Guerrero et al., 2008), besides correcting\
    \ the fatigue of \nthe soil caused by monocultures. \nV o l u m e  8 3  |  I s\

    \ pests and pathogens \ndevelopment on plants during cultivation\n- Chromotropic\
    \ traps for monitoring pests are quite useful \nwith small populations but are\
    \ less effective in the case of \nmassive infestations. The same applies to pheromone\
    \ dif-\nfusers. The mass trapping method, using semiochemicals, \nis used, for\
    \ lepidoptera and thrips, providing an environ-\nmentally friendly control method;\
    \ however, its full poten-\ntial for pest management has not been realized and\
    \ further \nresearch into and development of this technology is neces-\nsary (El\
    \ Sayed et al., 2006).\n- The use of resistant plants to control the different\
    \ phy-\ntosanitary problems. Sometimes this is the only method \nof control possible\
    \ (virus, vascular pathogens), since other \noptions are not available or are\
    \ very expensive. The avail-\nability of resistant commercial varieties is wide\
    \ and is con-\ntinuously growing in the case of the main vegetable crops, \nnot\
    \ only for combatting diseases, but also pests. However, \npests and pathogens\
    \ may overcome genetic resistance, \nespecially when one or few genes are involved\
    \ (vertical \nresistance). The identification and regular introduction \nof new\
    \ resistance genes, the combination of a maximum \nnumber of resistance genes,\
    \ and the introduction of par-\ntial resistance are new strategies proposed for\
    \ enhanc-\ning plant genetic resistance (Dogimont et al., 2010; Pink, \n2002).\n\
    - A noteworthy example of exploitation is the tomato Mi-1 \ngene which, in addition\
    \ to providing resistance to several \nspecies of nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.),\
    \ also confers re-\nsistance to Macrosiphon euphorbiae, Bemisia tabaci, and \n\
    some other pests. Nowadays, there are several commer-\ncially available tomato\
    \ and pepper cultivars that are resist-\nant to Meloidogyne spp. (Kiewnick et\
    \ al., 2009). Resistant \nplants pepper to oidium (Leveilula taurica) are beginning\
    \ \nto reach the market, as well as a cross-protected product \nagainst sweet\
    \ cucumber mosaic virus (PepMV). Biotech-\nnology, transforming plants with genes\
    \ encoding for anti-\nbodies directed against pathogens, opens up huge oppor-\n\
    tunities for the future of plant resistance.\n- The use of grafted plants to control\
    \ Fusarium oxysporium \nin watermelon and Verticillium dahliae in eggplant is\
    \ quite \nusual (Lee et al., 2010). In addition, in some areas, grafted \nplants\
    \ are used to control Phytophthora spp. and Meloido-\ngyne spp. in sweet pepper\
    \ (López-Marín et al., 2017) and \nFusarium spp. in tomato, respectively.\n- As\
    \ fertilization affects plant-pathogen as well as plant-pest \nrelationships,\
    \ which may be promoted or inhibited, the op-\ntimal nutritional status of plants\
    \ increases their resistance \nto the attack of pests and diseases. In addition,\
    \ irrigation \nmust be correctly calculated, since an excess of humidity, \nbesides\
    \ favouring root asphyxia, increases the attack of \nsoil diseases (damping off,\
    \ root rot, nematodes, etc.).\n- Biological control in greenhouses has been applied\
    \ with \nsuccess for many years. Acceptance of this method has \nbeen remarkably\
    \ fast because of the resistance to pesti-\ncides that several key pests have\
    \ developed (Hanafi, 2008, \n2013), and the fact that the number of pesticides\
    \ available \nhas decreased.\n- The introduction of banker plants into a crop\
    \ is a preven-\ntive and long-term significant example for aphis control \n(Barriere\
    \ et al., 2013). Besides, biological control agents \nsuch as Conipthyrium minitans\
    \ and Thrichoderma spp. can \nbe introduced in soil to manage soil-borne pathogens.\n\
    - The main pests in protected crops can also be controlled \nby the mass release\
    \ of beneficial organisms as a curative \ntechnique. However, for the presence\
    \ of secondary pests, \nthere is no biological solution available yet, so that\
    \ more \neffort is needed in the search for natural enemies for the \nnew pests.\n\
    - The usefulness of hedges, green corridors and vegetation \nislands around greenhouses\
    \ should not be underestimat-\ned for enhancing the presence of natural enemies\
    \ that can \ncurb the dispersal of pests. The same plant species can \nbe introduced\
    \ in the greenhouse for the same purpose. \nMoreover, methods such as mixed cropping,\
    \ multiple and \nintercropping and trap cropping are a way to increase bio-\n\
    diversity or increase biological control in organic farming.\n- Knowledge of the\
    \ induction of volatile emission by plants, \nas an immediate response to pest\
    \ attacks (Herbivore-in-\nduced plant volatiles, HIPVs), has also opened up a\
    \ new \nfield of research for enhancing the effectiveness of host \nplant resistance\
    \ and biological control for integrated pest \nmanagement (War et al., 2011).\n\
    - With regard to the application of pesticides, it is essential \nfor the future\
    \ of IPM to fully understand their compatibility \nwith natural enemies and pollinators\
    \ (Bielza and Lacasa, \n2014). Some techniques, such as applying treatments via\
    \ \nan irrigation system, using baits that differentially attract \npests and\
    \ beneficial insects, applying treatments focused \non some part of the plant,\
    \ can help. In addition, auxiliary \npopulations that are more tolerant to pesticides\
    \ could be \nestablished through classic breeding systems, or through \ngenetic\
    \ engineering.\nConclusions\nThe recent developments in greenhouse production\
    \ in \nMediterranean climates which have been presented in this \nreview point\
    \ to the high degree of innovation and research \ncarried out within the industry\
    \ and research centres in \nrecent years with the aim of achieving more sustainable\
    \ and \ncompetitive production. Climate change will almost certainly \nbring more\
    \ problems that will need to be taken into account \nin the near future, and will\
    \ lead to modifications in most of the \ncurrent strategies of production, particularly\
    \ those related to \nrising temperatures and water shortages. Thus, new effective\
    \ \ntools to tackle this new situation will be needed, without \naffecting the\
    \ competitiveness of the horticultural crops value \nchain. \nReferences\nAdelhafidi,\

    of irrigated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) by smallholder farmers in the Central
    Rift Valley area of Oromia, Ethiopia Ambecha O. Gemechis Centre for Crop Systems
    AnalysisAgricultural Biosystems EngineeringPE&RC Research output: Thesis › internal
    PhD, WU Overview Fingerprint Projects (1) Abstract Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum
    L.) is a vegetable crop with high potential to contribute to poverty reduction
    via increased income and food security. It is widely grown by smallholders, has
    high productivity and its demand is increasing. Ethiopia produced about 30,700
    Mg of tomatoes on 5,027 ha annually in 2014/2015. Average yields are only 6.1
    Mg ha-1, below the world average yields. There is both a need and a potential
    to increase tomato production per unit area. The aim of this thesis is to analyze
    the irrigated tomato production systems of smallholder farmers in Ethiopia, to
    survey and characterize the tomato in selected ecoregions and seasons, and to
    identify yield-limiting or yield-reducing factors and opportunities to enhance
    yield by using a combination of surveys and field experiments. Field experiments
    on optimization of yield and quality of field-grown tomato were carried out at
    Ziway, Ethiopia, for two seasons to study the impact of different irrigation practices
    applied, based on local empirical practices, deficit irrigation, or crop water
    requirement. This thesis begins with a survey of tomato production systems. The
    survey details the area and production in various zones and for each of these
    zones yield- determining, yield-limiting, and yield-reducing factors and opportunities
    for improving yield and quality are indicated. It also avails area, production
    and yield data for each growing season and typifies the production systems in
    these zones. Low temperature (cold) from October-January and shortage of improved
    seeds are recognized as yield-determining factors, whereas insufficient water
    and nutrient (fertilizer) supply proved to be yield-limiting factors across zones.
    Late blight (Phytophthora infestans), Fusarium wilt (Fusarium oxysporum) and different
    pests and weeds are identified as yield-reducing factors in the zones. Experienced
    growers who have access to extension service recorded significant yield increment.
    Farmers Research Groups improved actual average yield with the use of improved
    technology (improved varieties and quality seed), and better efficiencies of water
    and fertilizer use. This study quantified influences of irrigation systems and
    strategies on growth-determining tomato features. Variation in irrigation systems
    and strategies accounted for variation in growth and dry matter accumulation.
    Greater performance for yield-related traits was obtained with drip irrigation
    based on crop water requirement for tomato varieties. Examination of plants showed
    also that local empirical irrigation is responsible for the occurrence of Phytophthora
    root rot, whereas deficit irrigation proved cause for occurrence of Fusarium wilt
    (Fusarium oxysporum), blossom end rot and broome rape (Orobanche ramosa) on roots
    or leaves, stems or fruits. The experiments on irrigation scheduling with different
    irrigation systems and strategies gave useful indications on the possibility to
    improve commercial yield (CY) and water use efficiency. Promising results on CY
    and agronomical water use efficiency of tomato were achieved with drip irrigation
    based on crop water requirement, while for the biological water use efficiency
    higher value was obtained with deficit drip irrigation in both seasons. The findings
    indicate that the CY was decreased significantly for deficit by 50% in drip irrigation
    and deficit by 50% in furrow irrigation in both seasons. Mean CY for drip irrigation
    according to crop water requirement increased by 51% and 56% compared with deficit
    drip irrigation, whereas furrow irrigation based on crop water requirement increased
    by 52% and 54% compared with deficit furrow in Experiments 1 and 2, respectively.
    However, water use efficiency decreased with the increasing water volume. Simultaneous
    measurements of rate of photosynthesis based on gas exchange measurements and
    the thylakoid electron flux based on chlorophyll fluorescence were used to investigate
    physiological limitations to photosynthesis in leaves of deficit irrigated tomato
    plants under open field situations. Combined leaf gas exchange/chlorophyll fluorescence
    measurements differentiated the treatments effectively. Reduction in rate of photosynthesis,
    stomatal conductance and the maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II varied
    across seasons of all varieties, whereas leaf temperature was increased by deficit
    irrigation in all varieties. Among varieties studied, Miya was found relatively
    tolerant to deficit irrigation. Stomatal limitation of rate of photosynthesis
    increased significantly as a result of water stress suggesting a strong influence
    of the stomatal behaviour. We also determined the influence of irrigation systems
    and strategies on water saving and tomato fruit quality. Using deficit drip irrigation
    was the best management strategy to optimize water use and tomato quality. Fruit
    dry matter content, acid content and total soluble solids were significantly higher
    with deficit drip irrigation than with other treatments. From this thesis it appeared
    that agro-climatic conditions, access to resources and culture all contribute
    to the relatively low yields of tomato in the Central Rift Valley of Ethiopia.
    The thesis also proved that significant advances can be made in yield, quality
    and resource use efficiency. Original language English Qualification Doctor of

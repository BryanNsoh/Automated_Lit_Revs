    Get rights and content Abstract The projected increases in World population and
    need for food have recently motivated adoption of information technology solutions
    in crop fields within precision agriculture approaches. Internet Of Underground
    Things (IOUT), which consists of sensors and communication devices, partly or
    completely buried underground for real-time soil sensing and monitoring, emerge
    from this need. This new paradigm facilitates seamless integration of underground
    sensors, machinery, and irrigation systems with the complex social network of
    growers, agronomists, crop consultants, and advisors. In this paper, state-of-the-art
    communication architectures are reviewed, and underlying sensing technology and
    communication mechanisms for IOUT are presented. Moreover, recent advances in
    the theory and applications of wireless underground communication are also reported.
    Finally, major challenges in IOUT design and implementation are identified. Previous

    population will increase by 33% in 2050, doubling the need for food [124]. Yet
    today, up to 70% of all water withdrawals are due to food production. This demands
    novel technologies to produce more crop for drop. USDA Agricultural Resource Management
    Survey (ARMS) is the primary source of information on the financial condition,
    production practices, and resource use of America’s farm businesses and the economic
    well-being of America’s farm households. ARMS data show that precision agriculture
    has recently become a widespread practice nationwide. In Fig. 1, adoption rates
    of major precision agriculture approaches (bars) along with the total precision
    agriculture adoption rate (line) are shown for maize for each year of USDA ARMS
    publication (USDA ARMS 2015 version was under development at the time of this
    writing). It can be observed that adoption rate of precision agriculture for maize
    increased from 17.29% in 1997 to 72.47% in 2010 with similar trends observed for
    other crops such as soybean and peanuts. Aside from presenting a growing trend
    in the usage of precision agriculture in maize production, it is evident that
    as new technologies emerge, they are widely adopted by farmers. Download : Download

    technology adoption in maize production (USDA ARMS Data). Among the various precision
    agriculture techniques, crop yield monitoring is the most widely adopted technique
    (61.4%). In addition, guidance and auto-steering system adoption jumped from 5.34%
    in 2001 to 45.16% in nine years. Use of equipment and crop location information
    enables precise control with auto-steering systems which reduce production and
    maintenance costs and reduces repetitive field work for farmers. Despite the drastic
    increase in adoption rates of other techniques, Variable Rate Technology (VRT)
    adoption has been relatively steady, where adoption rate increased from 8.04%
    in 1998 to only 11.54% in 2005. Adaptive application of resources like fertilizers,
    pesticide, and water promises significant gains in crop production but requires
    accurate and timely information from the field. It can be observed that only after
    the adoption of recent crop moisture sensing technology, VRT adoption doubled
    to 22.44% in 2010. During the same period, crop moisture sensing adoption increased
    from 36.21% in 2005 to 51.68% in 2010. It is clear that the success and adoption
    of VRT depends on advancing soil monitoring approaches. Despite being the most
    recent precision agriculture technology, crop moisture sensing has become one
    of the most adopted practices. Yet techniques are still limited to manual data
    collection or limited field coverage. 2. A new paradigm: IOUT Most recently, the
    need for real-time in-situ information from agricultural fields have given rise
    to a new type of IoT: Internet Of Underground Things (IOUT). IOUT represents autonomous
    devices that collect any relevant information about the Earth and are interconnected
    with communication and networking solutions that facilitate sending the information
    out of fields to the growers and decision mechanisms. IOUT is envisioned to not
    only provide in-situ monitoring capabilities (e.g., soil moisture, salinity, and
    temperature), but when interconnected with existing field machinery (irrigation
    systems, harvesters, and seeders) enable complete field autonomy and pave the
    way for more efficient food production solutions. In IOUT, Communications can
    be carried out through the soil and plants from underground devices, and information
    acquired from the field can be sent to the cloud for real-time decision making.
    IOUT applications have unique requirements; i.e., information from soil, operation
    in remote crop fields, wireless communication through plants and soil, and exposure
    to elements. Existing over-the-air (OTA) wireless communication solutions face
    significant challenges because they were not designed for these circumstances.
    As such, IOUT also gives rise to a new type of wireless communications: wireless
    underground (UG) communications [68], [152], where radios are buried in soil and
    wireless communication is conducted partly or completely through the soil. Integration
    of UG communications with IOUT will help conserve water resources and improve
    crop yields [143], [145]. Moreover, advances in IOUT will benefit other applications
    including landslide monitoring, pipeline assessment, underground mining, and border
    patrol [67], [69], [71], [84], [94], [102], [106], [115], [132], [138], [142],
    [146], [150], [152], [159]. This paper presents IOUT for the design of precision
    agriculture solutions. We first discuss functionalities, architecture, and components
    of IOUT. In Section 4 and 5, we present sensing and communication technologies
    of IOUT. In Section 6, we list IOUT testbeds and existing solutions. We conclude
    by discussing challenges of IOUT. 3. IOUT architecture IOUT will consist of interconnected
    heterogeneous devices tailored to the crop and field operations. Common desirable
    functionalities of IOUT are: • In-situ sensing: On board soil moisture, temperature,
    salinity sensors are required for accurate localized knowledge of the soil. These
    sensors can be either integrated on the chip along-with other components of the
    architecture, or they can be used as separate sensors that can be connected to
    the main components. • Wireless communication in challenging environments: Communication
    components of IOUT devices are either deployed on the field or within the soil.
    For OTA communication, solutions should be tailored to the changing environment
    due to irrigation and crop growth. Over the air communication is used to store
    the data on a more secure and accessible service/device. In addition, any system
    on the field is exposed to natural elements and should be designed to sustain
    challenging conditions. Underground communication solutions, while mostly shielded
    from the environment, require the ability to communicate through soil and adjust
    its parameters to adapt to dynamic changes in soil. • Inter-connection of field
    machinery, sensors, radios, and cloud: It is desirable that IOUT architecture
    links a diverse multitude of devices on a crop field to the cloud for seamless
    integration. Accordingly, IOUT architecture will not only provide collected information
    but will also automate operations on the field based on this information. • Real-time
    Decision Making: Information about soil and crop conditions should be available
    to the managers and decision support systems for real-time decision making at
    each level. • Mobility: IOUT will have seamless support for both fixed and mobile
    devices with backing of short-term and long-term communications. Based on these
    main required functionalities, a representative IOUT architecture is illustrated
    in Fig. 2, with the following components. • Underground things (UTs): An UT consist
    of an embedded system with communication and sensing components, where a part
    of or the entire system resides underground. UTs are protected by weatherproof
    enclosures and, in underground settings, watertight containers. Buried UTs are
    protected from the farm equipment, wild rodents, and extreme weather conditions.
    Sensors typically include soil temperature and moisture sensors, but a wide range
    of other soil- or weather-related phenomena can be monitored which will be discussed
    in detail on Section 4. Existing communication schemes include Bluetooth, ZigBee,
    NFC, Wi-Fi, Sigfox, LoRa, LoRaWAN, satellite, cellular, and underground. A UT
    using Bluetooth [105] or underground wireless [86] can communicate over 100 meters,
    commercial products at ISM-band can cover three times larger distances, whereas
    longer-distance connectivity is possible through cellular or satellite. Considering
    the relatively large field sizes, nodes can be configured to form networks capable
    of transferring all the sensed information to a collector sink and self-heal in
    the event that nodes become unreachable (e.g., Irromesh [24]). Nodes are generally
    powered by a combination of batteries and, if on field, solar panels. Cost of
    UTs is expected to be relatively inexpensive as they are deployed by the multitude
    [96]. • Base stations are used as gateways to transfer the collected data to the
    cloud. They are installed in permanent structures such as weather stations or
    buildings. Base stations are more expensive as they are better safe-guarded and
    have higher processing powers and communication capabilities [96]. • Mobile sinks
    are installed in equipment that move around the field periodically or as required,
    such as tractors and irrigation systems [86]. Since irrigation machinery advance
    at a slow pace, the soil data is received ahead of time allowing instant adjustment
    on the water application rate. On the other hand, when weather conditions are
    favorable, turning on the irrigation equipment only for data retrieval purpose
    is expensive. An alternative is to use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) such as
    quadrotors or ground robots to retrieve the measurements. • Cloud services are
    intended to use for permanent storage of the data collected, real-time processing
    of the field condition, crop related decision making, and integration with other
    databases (e.g., weather, soil). Download : Download high-res image (466KB) Download

    of such a diverse range of communication architectures makes it challenging to
    form a unified IOUT architecture with the ability to fulfill agricultural requirements
    seamlessly. This is further complicated due to the lack of standard protocols
    for sensing and communication tailored to the IOUT. In the following, we explain
    in detail the sensing (Section 4) and communication (Section 5) mechanisms with
    a focus on desired characteristics of IOUT for real-time sensing and effective
    communications. 4. Sensing The main functionality of IOUT is real-time sensing.
    Sensing has led to adoption of technology in the precision agriculture and it
    also enables improved efficiency of agricultural production and practices [127].
    An overview of sensing technologies is presented next. Soil moisture: Soil moisture
    (SM) sensors have been used for decades in crop fields to measure water content.
    Automated technologies have largely replaced the use of hand-held/manual soil
    moisture technologies because of difficulties associated with taking manual soil
    moisture readings in production fields in remote locations. In the last decade,
    wireless data harvesting technologies have been developed that provide managers
    and users real-time access to soil moisture data which has resulted in more effective
    water management decision-making. Important SM measurement methods are described
    below: • Gravimetric sampling is a direct and standard method of measuring SM.
    It is used to determine the volumetric water content of the soil. This method
    determines SM by a ratio of soil’s dry mass to the wet soil mass including the
    pore spaces. It requires manual sampling and oven drying of soil samples taken
    from the field [91]. • Resistive sensors [50] such as granular matrix sensors
    work on the principal of electrical conductivity of water and measuring resistance
    changes based on soil water content. This method requires calibration of sensors
    for accurate SM reading. • Capacitive sensors measure SM based on changes in capacitance
    of soil due to water content variations. Capacitive sensors, which are generally
    of higher accuracy than resistive sensors but cost more, are being used by commercial
    UTs. • Ground Penetrating Radars (GPR) [66], [98] are based on the absorption
    and reflection of electromagnetic waves. Impulse, frequency sweep, and frequency
    modulated technologies are used in SM sensing. This method is used to measure
    near-surface soil moisture (up to 10 cm). • Neutron scattering probes [87], [92]
    and gauges use radiation scattering techniques to measure SM by estimating changes
    in neutron flux density due to the water content of the soil are the most accurate
    soil moisture probes used in fields. They require specific licenses to be used.
    • Gamma ray attenuation [90], time-domain reflectometry (TDR) [128], and frequency-domain
    reflectometry (FDR) [139] are other popular SM measurement approaches. Common
    SM sensors used in fields are shown in Fig. 3. SM sensors are buried at depths
    of 5  cm to 75  cm in soil depending on the crop type and root depth. SM data
    obtained from these sensors is used to create soil moisture maps which help real-time
    decision making. SM sensors have been deployed in fields with increasing frequency.
    For example, the Nebraska Agricultural Water Management Network [99], [101], was
    established with only 20 growers in 2005 and currently serves over 1400 growers
    to enable the adoption of water and energy conservation practices using SM sensors.
    In addition to in-situ soil moisture sensors, other soil moisture data sources
    are Soil Climate Analysis Network [49], US Climate Reference Network [60], TAMU
    North American Soil Moisture Database [53], Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity [48],
    NASA North American Land Data Assimilation System [27], and NASA Soil Moisture
    Active Passive [46]. These databases contain soil moisture and temperature informations
    of vast geographical areas and augment the Web Soil Survey (WSS) [63], which collects
    and classifies the US soil information by region. Download : Download high-res

    Top row: Gravimetric [91], resistive (Watermark) [50], capacitance [17], Bottom
    Row: GPR [98], TDR [128], neutron probe [92]. Other soil physical properties:
    In addition to soil moisture sensing, other soil properties can be measured to
    populate the soil map such as the organic mater present in the soil, acidity (pH)
    [135], percentage of sand, clay and silt particles [137], and nutrients such as
    Mg, P, OM, Ca, base saturation Mg, base saturation K, base saturation Ca, CEC,
    K/Mg, and Ca/Mg ratios [104], [110], [113]. In-situ, real-time measurement of
    these properties still face challenges due to size, cost, and technology limitations.
    Yield monitoring: Yield monitoring provides spatial distribution of crop yield
    at the end of a growing season and is used make long-term decisions about agriculture
    operations [108], [118]. Yield monitors are usually installed on farm equipment
    and automatically collects yield data during harvesting. More specifically, mass
    flow sensors are installed on grain containers to record grain inflow along with
    location (e.g., Force Sensor by Ag Leader). The collected data is analyzed using
    geographic information system (GIS) tools such as ArchInfo, Mapinfo, and Environment
    System Research International tools. Electrical conductivity and topography surveys:
    The ability of soil to conduct current is measured through soil electrical conductivity
    (EC) [116]. Coupled with field topography (elevation and slope), EC data provides
    an insight into the crop yield. EC (through contact and no-contact methods) is
    used to determine the amount of nitrogen usage, water holding and cation-exchange
    capacity, drainage, and rooting depth. EC maps are used to classify the field
    into zones. Then, precision agriculture practices such as variable rate irrigation,
    variable rate seeding, nitrogen, yield, and drainage management are applied based
    on zoning. EC mapping can be done using apparent electrical conductivity (ECa)
    [88], visible-near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (VNIR) [75], and electromagnetic
    Induction (EMI) [141] approaches. An array of commercial tools are available,
    e.g., Veris 3100 [61], EC400 sensors combined with GPS systems [107] are used
    for EC mapping. Weather and environmental sensing: Weather and environmental sensors
    are used to sense soil and air temperature, direction and speed of winds, and
    other environmental effects such as rainfall, solar emissions and humidity. For
    example, John Deere has introduced sensors to assess these phenomena in their
    commercial Field Connect solution [25]. Availability of this information is useful
    for real-time and fully informed precision agriculture decisions. A mesoscale
    network (MesoNet), consists of nodes for weather and environment sensing, spanning
    over a large geographic area. MesoNet [34] is used to observe major changes in
    weather patterns, and when combined with IOUT sensing can be used to provide real-time
    weather information at the farm level. Soil macro-nutrients sensing: Macro-Nutrients
    such as nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorous are vital for the crop growth. The
    assessment of these nutrients helps to determine the fertilizer impact and future
    applications. Optical sensing is based on reflectance spectroscopy to measure
    the reflection and absorption by these macrosimulation [104], [110], [113]. To
    detect nitrate and sulfate concentration in natural water resources, a sensing
    method using planar electromagnetic sensors has been developed in [121]. This
    method is used to sense nitrate and sulfate levels by correlating the impedance
    of the sensor array with the concentration of these pollutants. It has been shown
    that sensor impedance decreases with increase in concentration of these chemicals
    [121]. Electrochemical, VIS-NIRS spectroscopy, and ATR spectroscopy are the major
    soil macro-nutrients sensing approaches. These soil macro-nutrients sensing approaches
    are limited to sense one desired ion because membrane used in these methods only
    responds to one ion [113]. To achieve concurrent multi-ion sensing, a major challenge
    is to form a detector array for soil macro-nutrients sensing [104]. Remote sensing:
    Remote sensing based approaches uses electromagnetic waves which interact with
    soil and plants in precision agriculture. These approaches work on the measurement
    of intensity of reflected components of the electromagnetic waves as these interact
    with soil and plants [120]. Spatial resolution of remote sensing techniques is
    a major issue; however, when combined with in-situ IOUT sensing approaches, they
    may result in fine resolution, which can be used to produce field maps for analysis
    and decision making in precision agriculture. Examples of these include soil moisture,
    yield [72], texture [140], pesticides applications [95], and nutrient field maps
    [2], [112], [120]. Remote sensing has also applications in satellite data fusion,
    crop structure and condition monitoring. Other precision agriculture technologies:
    A myriad of other technologies is playing vital role in the precision agriculture
    practices. Here we briefly mention these technologies as useful IOUT tools. These
    include precision planting, geolocation, GIS systems, soil sampling and field
    analysis map generation, drones, auto-steering and VRT. In precision planting
    [38], the seeding is done using a very fine predetermined inter plant distance,
    and robots with lasers are used for automatic weed zapping. Farm devices in the
    field are aligned automatically with robovator technology. With GPS, it has become
    possible to divide a farm into different zones based on the field conditions [160].
    Variable rate fertilizer application [2], [78], [95] is also important for crop
    yield improvement. Wireless communications with drones also constitutes a major
    component of the IOUT connectivity. GreenStar Lightbar [15] is a tool from Deere
    & Co that is used to determine the location and width in the row crops. TK-GPS
    [57] is another device used to perform real time soil mapping. The sensing technologies
    discussed in this section present many opportunities for advancing the state of
    precision agriculture through the IOUT. Availability of inexpensive sensors and
    their ability to communicate wireless enables their integrations to control systems
    in IOUT. Therefore, wireless communications, between heterogeneous equipment used
    in these sensor technology, has an important role in realization of the real-time
    decision making in IOUT. Moreover, adoption of sensor technology could be raised
    by a well-connected, reliable, and secure IOUT, and it will also help in development
    of improved sensing technologies in precision agriculture. Because, currently,
    the lack of availability of robust connectivity in the field is hindering rapid
    advancements in sensing technologies. Different approaches for wireless communications
    in IOUT are discussed in the next section. 5. Wireless connectivity Connectivity
    solutions for IOUT can be classified as in-field communications and cloud connectivity
    as discussed next. 5.1. In-field communications In-field communication solutions
    integrate UTs and other communication entities on the field. Most commercial solutions
    utilize OTA communications, whereas IOUT are expected to feature wireless underground
    communications. For short-range communication and networking, license-free standards
    such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, and DASH7 are used in ISM bands. More recently, regulatory
    restrictions are relaxed by the FCC through new rules that allow the use of TV
    white space frequencies in farms [14] (Order No. DA 16-307 Dated: Mar 24, 2016),
    where interference with other licensed devices is not expected. The major challenge
    for OTA communications is the lack of studies about the impacts of crops and farm
    environment on wireless propagation and associated tailored solutions to farms.
    In the following, we discuss in-field communications in detail. UG communications:
    UG communication solutions enable complete concealment of UTs, which decrease
    operation costs and impacts from external elements [86]. For a buried UT radio,
    two types of communication scenarios arise. Aboveground communications involve
    communication between UTs and aboveground devices. Underground communication is
    carried out between UTs. Furthermore, due to the soil-air interface, aboveground
    communication links are not symmetric and need to be analyzed in terms of underground-to-aboveground
    and aboveground-to-underground communication. In Fig. 4, the path loss of these
    links are shown as a result of field experiments [86]. It can be observed that
    practical underground link distances are still limited to 12  m to allow for practical
    multi-hop connectivity. Yet, communication ranges of up to 200  m is possible
    for aboveground communications. Download : Download high-res image (185KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Communication from soil. For UG communications,
    the communication medium is soil, which impacts communication success in six main
    ways: (1) Soil texture and bulk density: EM waves exhibit attenuation when incident
    in soil medium. These variations vary with texture and bulk density of soil. Soil
    is composed of pore spaces, clay, sand, and silt particles. Relative concentration
    of these particles result in 12 soil textural classes [91]. Water holding capacity
    of each soil type is different because of its pore size. For example, lower water
    holding capacity of sandy soil leads to lower attenuation and high root mean square
    delay spread, whereas higher water holding capacities of silt loam and silty clay
    loam soils result in low root mean square delay spread and higher attenuation
    [133], [134]. (2) Soil moisture: The effective permittivity of soil is a complex
    number. Thus, besides diffusion attenuation, EM waves also suffer absorption by
    soil water content and its variations. Soil dielectric spectra and its conductivity
    depends on the soil moisture. The relative dielectric constant range of dry soil
    is between 2 and 6 and its conductivity ranges from to   Si/m, where soils at
    near-saturation level have a relative dielectric constant in the range of 5–15
    and conductivity between to   Si/m [147]. Coherence bandwidth of the underground
    channel is limited to a few hundred KHz range [129], [130], [131], which limits
    data rates. Coherence bandwidth also varies with soil moisture, making design
    of advanced techniques challenging. (3) Distance and depth variations: Sensors
    in IOUT applications are usually buried in the top sub-meter layer. Thus, in addition
    to distance, channel quality depends on deployment depth because of the impacts
    of the soil-air interface, which causes refraction of EM waves. Nodes at higher
    burial depths experience higher attenuation [129]. (4) Antennas in soil: When
    an antenna is buried, its return loss characteristics change due to the high permittivity
    of soil [85], [151]. Moreover, with the variation in soil moisture and hence soil
    permittivity, the return loss of the antenna varies with time too. Changes in
    return loss results in variations in resonant frequency, which is shifted to the
    lower spectrum, and system bandwidth, creating additional challenges for UG communication.
    (5) Frequency variations: The pathloss caused by attenuation is frequency dependent
    because of dipole relaxation associated with water. Generally, lower frequency
    spectrum has lower attenuation, because at higher frequencies, water absorption
    plays a dominant role. In addition, when EM waves propagate in soil, their wavelength
    shortens due to higher permittivity of soil than the air. Therefore, channel capacity
    in soil is also a function of operation frequency [85]. (6) Lateral waves: For
    two UTs, wireless underground communication is conducted through three major paths:
    lateral, direct, and reflected (LDR) waves [86], [130], [133]. Direct and reflected
    waves reside completely in soil and therefore, suffer from the challenges above.
    On the other hand, lateral waves travel partly on the soil-air interface in air,
    experiencing the lowest attenuation. Lateral waves plays an important role in
    extending underground communication ranges. (7) Recent advances in wireless underground
    communications: Recent developments in wireless underground communications include
    the characterization of wireless UG channel and development of environment-aware,
    cross-layer communication solutions to achieve high data rate, long range communications
    with applications to precision agriculture. The impulse response of the wireless
    UG channel is captured and analyzed through extensive experiments [133]. With
    more than 1500 measurement in an underground greenhouse testbed, the effects of
    soil moisture and soil texture on wireless underground communication channel are
    analyzed. Through this analysis, the vital statistics of wireless UG channel impulse
    response (e.g., coherence bandwidth, root mean square delay spread, and power
    associated with multipath) are developed. The three main components of the UG
    channel, direct wave, reflected wave, and the lateral wave are validated. The
    coherence bandwidth of the UG channel has been shown to be less than 1.15  MHz
    which further decreases to 418  kHz for the distances greater than 12  m in soil
    [133]. Change in soil moisture also impacts the root mean square delay spread
    which requires moisture-based dynamic adaptation techniques in UG communications.
    The statistical model [134] is vital for tailored solutions for underground multi-carrier
    communication and soil moisture adaptive beamforming. Based on impulse response
    analysis, the multi-carrier modulation and wireless underground channel diversity
    reception schemes have been developed for the realization of high data rate communications
    [129]. The effects of soil type and moisture on the underground antenna, channel
    and system capacity are highlighted. Based on this analysis, multi-carrier modulation
    and wireless underground channel diversity reception schemes [131] have been developed.
    The optimum maximum ratio combining (MRC-LDR) achieves the maximum gain. In this
    approach, three times SNR enhancement is achieved as compared to the SNR of a
    single antenna matched filter UG receiver. However, the interference from the
    reflected components is still present. Adaptive combining (AC-LDR) uses adaptive
    switching and selection process to suppresses undesired interference. Based on
    the proximity of the LDR receiver, either the D-wave or L-Wave component is dominant
    at the receiver. AC-LDR exploits this by adaptively switching and selecting the
    strongest lateral, or the direct wave. The R-Wave is not considered because it
    is the weakest component and results in performance degradation. In [131], the
    performance analysis of different modulation schemes through simulations and experiments
    has been carried out. The BER under equalization and diversity reception has been
    reported. A 3 times increase in SNR and improvement in BER from to are shown in
    wireless underground communication channel. Since use of sensing technologies
    in precision agriculture depend on reliable UG communications, these is a demand
    for high date rate, ubiquitous, reliable communications. These low error rate
    communication techniques help to achieve that goal in precision agriculture. Moreover,
    based on UG antenna analysis, soil moisture adaptive beamforming (SMABF) using
    underground antenna arrays is also developed [130]. SMABF employs underground
    antenna arrays at the transmitter and omni-directional antenna at the receiver.
    The lateral wave is maximized if the energy from the UG antenna is radiated in
    an optimum angle. In SMABF, beam steering is done to exploit the lateral wave
    in the underground communication by sending the energy in the optimum angle which
    maximizes lateral wave and leads to higher directivity. SMABF has complex array
    structures and needs phase shifters. With these advancements in UG communications,
    it has become possible to make progress from data collection to real-time processing
    and decision making in precision agriculture. Magnetic induction (MI) and acoustic
    UG communications: Magnetic Induction (MI) based communications is another approach
    for UG communications. In magnetic induction [114], [143], the rate of decay of
    received signal strength (RSS) is the inverse cube factor. Therefore, long range,
    high data rates signaling can not be done using MI, which is vital for IOUT paradigm.
    Moreover, the perpendicularity of transmitter and receiver coils (antennas) is
    a prohibiting factor to establish communications in MI. Wavelengths in MI communications
    tend to be large. Therefore, IOUT architecture can not scale with MI based UG
    communications in IOUT. Hence, because of these limiting factors, and due to in-feasibility
    of MI communications to establish communications with aboveground devices, MI
    based communications is not a reliable option for IOUT. EM-based UG communications
    are more suitable. There are also some common characteristics in underwater communication
    [74] and UG communications. However, underwater communications can not utilize
    electromagnetic (EM) waves because of higher degradation of signals and water
    absorption. Therefore, other approaches (e.g., acoustic [74]) are used in underwater
    communications. Moreover, the acoustic approach is infeasible in IOUT UG communications
    because of vibration limitations. Underground to UAV communications: The unmanned
    aerial vehicle (UAVs, also called drones) have recently emerged in the precision
    agriculture practices for sensing and communications of the filed conditions [123],
    [148], agricultural surveillance using imaging [97], [83], and decision support
    [144]. Before the use of UAVs in precision agriculture, the satellite imagery
    was obtained for the purpose of monitoring. Through the use of UAV imaging, a
    detailed soil moisture map of the field can be produced in timely and inexpensive
    manner. Moreover, the crop growth can also be monitored by using UAVs and accordingly
    vegetation index is generated. The seed planting and pesticide applications are
    other important applications of UAVs in precision agriculture. The UAVs, when
    integrated with the IOUT in the field, will require reliable communications with
    sensors and radio equipment for real-time decision making. There are many challenges
    from UG to UAV communications (e.g., restrictions on UAV communications payloads
    and antennas, limited flight times, low communication range from the UG to UAV
    link, and specific operator skills and licenses required for UAV operation). Technology
    and regulatory advances in these areas will lead to enhanced integration of UAVs
    in precision agriculture IOUT. Low power wide area networks (LPWAN): Since IOUT
    is designed for prolonged operation in the agricultural field, energy conservation
    plays important role in long term functionality and connectivity. Low Power Wide
    Area Networks (LPWAN) are designed not only to achieve energy conservation objective
    but also to attain long-range connectivity [122]. Due to this, LPWAN is suitable
    for IOUT communications where high data rate operations are not required and low
    latency of data transfer can be accepted for some applications. According to LPWAN
    Technical Workgroup, it has capacity to work over the time span of many years
    and is specifically designed for applications which need to transmit small packets
    intermittently. A brief overview of LPWAN technologies is given in the following:
    (1) LoRa: Approaches designed to conserve energy like Long Range Wide Area Network
    (LoRaWAN) favor one-hop star topology where end-devices transmit small packets
    of information (0.290–50  kbps) over long distances (up to 45  km in rural areas)
    [80]. This is more suitable for battery powered devices. Reliable communication
    over long distance is possible because of techniques like adaptive data rate,
    LoRa’s chord spread spectrum radio modulation scheme, and gateways that decode
    data received on multiple channels modulated with different spreading factors
    [111]. However, since LoRa uses unlicensed frequency, the channel utilization
    is limited to 30 seconds per day by regulations. For application that requires
    a QoS level, the download channel increase the probability of collisions [81].
    In precision agriculture, LoRa technology provides low-cost low-power communication
    solution for prolonged monitoring operations [29]. (2) Sigfox: Sigfox [44] is
    the first LPWAN technology and highly efficient in spectrum usage. It uses ultra
    narrow band (UNB) modulation. The communication range of Sigfox is up to 45  km
    and 12  km in rural and urban areas respectively. Sigfox supports data rates of
    up to 250  kbps, and also uses unlicensed spectrum (868  MHz and 902  MHz) for
    communications. Consequently, the amount of data that can be transferred daily
    is also limited by regulations [161]. Sigfox provides many opportunities in precision
    agriculture IOUT to support connectivity among field equipment and UT sensors
    [45]. (3) On-Ramp/Ingenu: On-Ramp developed the IEEE 802.15.4k [20] technical
    standard for LWPAN. It only specifies the physical and MAC layer, and upper layers
    are complimented by other standards which operates at the upper layers. It uses
    higher bandwidth (1 MHz) as compared to other LWPAN technologies. IEEE 802.15.4k
    uses 902–928  MHz unlicensed spectrum. Its communication range is up to 15  km.
    Hence, it more suitable for communications agricultural forms spanning over large
    geographical areas [35]. (4) NB-IoT: NB-IoT [154] is a new physical layer standard
    by 3GPP LTE (Release 13). It can coexist with LTE and GSM. NB-IoT also uses narrowband
    signal and is meant for low data rate applications. It only uses 180  KHz of its
    200  KHz bandwidth. NB-IoT operates in licensed spectrum and uses same band as
    of LTE. It supports standalone operation, broadband operation, and in-band operation.
    NB-IoT is also being used in many commercial agricultural solutions in Europe
    [32]. It also facilitates low-cost, long range, and prolonged battery life solutions
    in precision agriculture. (5) Extended coverage GSM IoT: EC-GSM-IoT [12] is another
    low power long range LWPAN standard based on software update to cellular eGPRS.
    It can also co-exist with other mobile networks and designed to support battery
    life of up to 10 years. It operates in 800  MHz to 900  MHz and 1800 to 1900  MHz
    GSM bands. Many features of EC-GSM-IoT (e.g., inexpensive equipment, long range
    and coverage) makes it suitable for IOUT communication in precision agriculture.
    NWave [33], Platanus [36], Weightless [64], and Ingenu [20] are other major notable
    LPWAN technologies, which can be used for IOUT communications depending on the
    deployment, application, energy requirement, and equipment. These are also being
    used in precision agriculture connected vineyards [11]. Wireless PAN/LAN: Wireless
    PAN/LAN is also important for communications between farm machinery and equipment,
    field workers and central base stations in the field. Use of Wireless LAN/PAN
    enables high data rate, low latency communication in IOUT, which are not supported
    by LPWAN. Wireless PAN/LAN include many technologies such as Bluetooth, ZigBee,
    Thread, and Wi-Fi. In the following we present brief overview of these technologies:
    (1) Bluetooth: Bluetooth [5] is standardized by Special Interest Group (SIG).
    Communication can be done up to 100  m distances and it uses frequency hopping
    spread spectrum technique. Bluetooth Smart is the low energy version and can operate
    in broadcast and connected mode. Bluetooth uses 2.4  GHz ISM band and has bandwidth
    up to 25  MHz. It is also being used in development of a low energy moisture-
    and temperature sensor intended for use in an agricultural wireless sensor network
    system [76]. (2) ZigBee: ZigBee [65] operates on the top of 802.15.4 MAC/PHY and
    it consists of application and network layer protocols. It can operate in a star
    and mesh topology with bandwidth up to 1  MHz and communication range of up to
    10 to 30 meters. A smart agriculture system by using ZigBee technology has been
    developed in [117]. (3) Thread: Thread [56], self-healing mesh network protocol,
    functions on IEEE 802.15.4 MAC/PHY and is simple and secure battery friendly LAN
    protocol. It can supports up to 250 devices and provides security at network and
    application layers. (4) Wi-Fi: IEEE 802.11 [19] is high data rate communication
    standard with support for data rates higher than 1  Gbps. It has physical layer
    standards for different ISM bands (2.4  GHz, 5  GHz and 60  GHz) and used different
    channel bandwidth up to 160  MHz. A remote monitoring system using WiFi, where
    the wireless sensor nodes are based on WSN802G modules, has been developed in
    [119]. Cellular technology in IOUT: As more and more IOUT applications are being
    developed, the demand for cellular and broadband connectivity IOUT solutions is
    reaching at critical levels. Lack of broadband cellular communication in rural
    areas is a major challenge as it hinders instant access to big data being generated
    from the field. Currently, data has to be collected and transmitted manually from
    the deployed IOUT systems which is major bottleneck in adoption of precision agriculture
    practices in remote rural areas. One main factor for non-existent or slow cellular
    data communication speeds is the huge expenditure on commissioning of required
    infrastructure rural communities. There are also many system and cost related
    challenges in Machine-to-Machine (M2M) cellular communications [70] as main purpose
    of cellular design was human communications. However, a recent release of LTE
    cellular standard has the support for M2M communications and can be used for communication
    in production fields being served with LTE networks. However, IOUT devices are
    required to be compatible with the cellular standard and energy consumption challenges
    restricts their use in battery powered devices for prolonged duration. To overcome
    these challenges, low power devices can be connected through in-field communications
    and subsequently data can be collected and transmitted to the cloud by using externally
    powered gateways with cellular capabilities. Energy consumption in IOUT: In IOUT,
    energy consumption is a vital issue because of the low power requirement for sensors
    in order to operate for prolonged periods without battery replacement. Moreover,
    the channel quality in UG communications is impacted by physical parameters of
    the soil (e.g., soil moisture). In [84], a connectivity model of IOUT for different
    soil physical parameters has been developed by designing the cluster size distribution
    under sub-critical constraints. A novel aboveground communication coverage model
    for underground clusters has been developed. To maintain connectivity while reducing
    energy consumption the transmit power control and environment aware routing are
    proposed. It is shown that these approaches can maintain network connectivity
    under all soil moisture conditions while reducing energy consumption. Moreover,
    it has also been shown that use of relaying nodes based on soil wetness conditions
    can further decrease the energy consumption. 5.2. Cloud and big data in precision
    agriculture Due to limited processing power and energy considerations, data processing
    and decision making are not generally conducted locally. Depending on privacy
    considerations, field information can be stored in a private database, provided
    to the public databases, or shared with other users [157]. There are online marketplaces
    where big data sets and agricultural apps are used to analyze a region and make
    decisions to maximize crop yield [136]. Additionally, in-situ SM sensors can be
    linked to national soil moisture databases for complete, accurate, and comprehensive
    information of soil moisture [27], [46], [48], [49], [53], [60], [63]. With the
    support of cloud services, real-time visualization and decision support can be
    provided. Therefore, Cloud can be used as a hub of data storage and processing
    applications in precision agricultural. Moreover, Cloud allows the scalability
    of IOUT paradigm from the field level to bigger geographic areas by forming network
    of farms. On the other hand, in the absence of storage or processing constraints,
    base stations on the fields can pull meteorological data from a weather service
    or soil information from a national service, fuse this information with in-situ
    data from UTs, and control the farming equipment. To have a fully automated system,
    farming equipment should include a controller that can be accessed remotely. The
    integration of IOUT with creates new avenues to form robust stakeholders in precision
    agriculture such as growers, industry, and trading companies and would results
    in increased efficiency and sustainability of whole precision agriculture ecosystem.
    In addition to integration of farm equipment data to soil and weather databases,
    other examples include linking UAVs and robotics to precision agriculture paradigm.
    Irrespective of in-situ or cloud processing, the main challenge is the integration
    of heterogeneous systems. Moreover, reliable data transfer from field to cloud,
    and cloud to farm, will constitute an important functionality of the IOUT cloud
    architecture. This functionality will not only help connect fields over vast geographical
    areas to the cloud, but will also facilitate local farms to use this data for
    assessment and improvement of crop yield. Moreover, there is a need of development
    of standardized interfaces for seamless connectivity and collaboration between
    different components of the precision agriculture ecosystem. The IOUT paradigm
    enables sensing and communications of even minor changes in the field including
    change in physical properties of the soil and growth of plants. Major sources
    of big data in precision agriculture are ESA satellite images, NDVI from drones,
    user maps (yield, electrical conductivity, and others), and soil data. This process
    generates big data and it becomes very important to extract meaningful information
    from this huge amount of data. This is also crucial for real-time end user decision
    making and in evaluation of return on investment. Therefore, it is necessary to
    develop big data analytics in precision agriculture [156]. It is also essential
    to analyze the reduction in input cost in water resources, energy consumption
    and labor cost by adopting precision agriculture practices [73]. Other examples
    of the big data analytics in precision agriculture are factors affecting crop
    yield; and demarcation of field zones based on particular application such as
    productivity, soil moisture, nutrients, harvesting. Farmers, as the biggest stakeholder
    in the precision agriculture, need to use the technology to see the potential
    benefits with out being overloaded with the data. Therefore, the big data analytics
    to show increase in crop yield and improvement in overall production efficiencies,
    which can deliver tangible benefits, are vital for success of the whole precision
    agriculture ecosystem. 6. An overview of IOUT enabling technologies and testbeds
    In this section, we present an overview of enabling technologies which facilitate
    IOUT developments for system-wide and communication-specific challenges. 6.1.
    Academic IOUT systems IOUTs can be used to ascertain the amount of water and fertilizer
    to be applied using an irrigation control system. An IOUT testbed has been deployed
    on the South Central Agricultural Lab (SCAL) in Clay Center, Nebraska [86]. The
    testbed covers a 41 acres of research field where an advanced center pivot irrigation
    system was installed in 2005 to research long-term dynamics of variable rate irrigation
    and fertigation, crop water and nutrient uptake, water stress and yield relationships,
    develop crop production functions, and associated numerous topics under full and
    limited irrigation and rainfed settings [100]. In this testbed, a mobile sink
    is installed on one of the controller towers of the center pivot irrigation system
    [86]. The current configuration includes two antennas facing opposite directions
    allowing the reception of data from nodes at a distance of 150  m–200  m. A solar
    panel provides sustainable energy in the field. 10–16 buried UTs are deployed
    in the field. Each UT is capable of measuring soil temperature and soil moisture
    from four external sensors buried at depths of 1, 2, 3, and 4  ft. UTs are powered
    by lithium-ion batteries and protected by a watertight enclosure. The spatio-temporal
    real-time information from UT is fused at the mobile sink and sent to the cloud
    using 4G communications. The cloud communicates with the center pivot controller
    for automated irrigation control. This field testbed is fully functional system
    developed to investigate IOUT sensing and communications capabilities in an agriculture
    field using center pivot irrigation, sensors, aboveground and underground communication
    devices. An indoor testbed has been designed and developed inside the greenhouse
    which supports dynamic soil moisture control for wireless underground communication
    experiments [133]. The testbed is made of 100  in. long, 36  in. wide and 48  in.
    high wooden box with drainage system to hold 90 cubic feet of packed soil (Fig.
    5). Antennas are buried at different depths and distances for controlled wireless
    communication experiments. Download : Download high-res image (203KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 5. The indoor testbed [133]. Moreover, a testbed
    based on magnetic induction (MI) underground communications has been developed
    in [143]. This testbed includes coils buried in the underground in lab settings.
    MI wave guide effects and 3-D coils are investigated using this testbed in different
    soil configurations. SoilBED [89], is another underground testbed developed for
    cross-well radar experiments in soil. It is used for investigation of EM wave
    propagation and for detection of presence of contaminated materials in soil. SoilBED
    can also be used for underground channel and antenna characterization, and empirical
    validations of underground communication channel models. Thoreau [161] is an IOUT
    testbed on an university campus that collects and curates time and geo-tagged
    data on an open platform on the cloud. It is based on Sigfox design and operates
    in the 900  MHz unlicensed bands with frequency hopped and narrow-band operation.
    It has very low data rates and soil properties including soil temperature, soil
    moisture, electric conductivity, and water potential are measured. Another precision
    agriculture testbed has been developed for real-time sensing in the field [79].
    It is used to sense related soil properties for real-time decision making. BioSense
    [4] Institute is an R&D institute for IT in biosystems. To achieve their vision
    on the future of agriculture and food production, BioSense works on the areas
    of machinery auto-steering and automation, EC probe & XRF scanner, electrical
    conductivity map, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) map, yield map,
    remote sensing, nano and micro-electronic sensors, big data, and Internet of things
    aimed to food production. BioSense Institute, supported by University of Novi
    Sad, Serbia, focuses on the design development of advanced ICT solutions in agriculture,
    food, ecology, environmental protection, and forestry. Research results of BioSense
    Institute are helping European countries and regions to improve agricultural and
    environmental standards. It is also working in nano and microelectronics, communications
    and signal processing, remote sensing and GIS, robotics and mechatronics, knowledge
    discovery, and BIO-related research fields such as agriculture, ecology, environmental
    sciences, and forestry. It consists of many researchers from various fields labs
    from Europe. Their solution for Big Data is AgroSense [3], an agricultural platform
    which store and present information to farmers, agri-companies, government, banks,
    and insurance companies aimed toward improving crop yield while reducing costs.
    Internet of Food and Farm (IoF2020) [22] is an European project that has 19 use
    cases in 5 agri-food production sectors: arables, fruits, vegetables, dairy, and
    meat. An example in arable is the combination of data from sensor networks for
    smart wheat management with crop models and other data sources (e.g., disease,
    crop stage detection, cultivar characterization from phenotyping, and others)
    to generate high spatial-temporal resolution and to develop new models. In fruits,
    a fresh table grapes chain project uses information from weather station and wired
    sensor (soil moisture, soil temperature, electrical conductivity, and leaf wetness)
    for disease forecasting and to control irrigation using flow meters and solenoid
    valves. Solar powered data loggers transmit the data using GPRS network. A case
    study in vegetable is the tracking of greenhouse tomato-crops chain by setting
    the optimum ambient conditions to reduce the usage of resources (e.g., pesticide
    application could be avoided completely) and increase energy efficiency. In dairy,
    15 grazing cows are tracked on the pasture and inside the dairy barn using three
    beacons. A case in meat is the tracking of pigs using RFID tags, which reduces
    boar taint, health problems, and improve productivity. Sensor are also used for
    climate monitoring, register weight gain, feeding and drinking patterns, and food
    and water consumption. A ZigBee based IOUT has been developed in [158] with application
    in precision agriculture. Related soil properties such as humidity and pH are
    sensed using this architecture. An IOUT for soil moisture sensing at multiple
    depths has been developed in [125]. It consists of wireless communications nodes,
    sensors, data transfer gateways, and web modules for real time sensing, communication,
    and visualization in the field. An IOUT testbed for snow and soil moisture monitoring
    has been developed in Sierra Nevada, California [103] . With 300 sensors spanning
    over an area of multiple kilometers, this IOUT sensing testbed is used to record
    measurements of soil water content, snow depth, matric potential, and other related
    parameters; and a detailed sensing, and communication performance analysis data
    is also reported. A summary of the existing academic architectures is provided

    products, OTA wireless communication is utilized, where the UT includes a variety
    of high-end sensors that measure properties like soil moisture, temperature, and
    electrical conductivity. Consequently, measurements generally represent a single
    point in the field. UT’s can interconnect to create a communication mesh, but
    in most cases, they are connected directly to a tower in the field with cellular
    or satellite communication capabilities. If the UT is not buried underground,
    redeployment of the equipment is needed after planting and before harvesting in
    each growing season to avoid damages to the equipment by the farming machinery.
    A classification of the commercial IOUT solutions, companies, and their products
    are presented in Fig. 6. Modularity in the design of IOUT devices is highly desirable
    as the requirements can change over time and are tailored for a specific application.
    For example, the transmission range influence the selection of a protocol and
    the transceiver that can meet the communication demands. Solutions could be customized
    for a specific application and ordered as a complete solution, so they will work
    out-of-the box. There are companies that specialize in agricultural solutions.
    In other cases, the architecture is required to be more specific and fast prototyping
    using OEM components is more appropriate. Once data is collected, end-users need
    networks to transmit the data, servers for storage and processing, and cloud-based
    applications to display the information. A summary of the commercial solutions
    is provided in Table 2. Major classes of the commercial solutions are highlighted
    in the following. • Agricultural solutions.John Deere’s Field Connect uses 3G
    connections to transmit information from eight sensor probes located a mile away
    (three if satellite communication is used) that measure soil moisture at various
    depth, temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, rain, and leaf wetness.
    MimosaTEK provides irrigation and fertigation solutions scaled to small, medium,
    and large farms [31]. TempuTech [55] provide wireless solutions to monitor temperature
    and humidity in grain elevators. Microsoft is developing FarmBeats which is an
    AI & IoT based platform for Agriculture [13]. These commercial agricultural solutions
    provide full support in precision agriculture including sensing, communications,
    and the cloud. • Out-of-the-box packages.Smartrek Technologies develops wireless
    nodes for different types of sensors and gateways that can be set up easily into
    a network mesh [47]. Nodes are protected by weatherproof enclosures which is a
    requirement for farm outdoor setting. Accessible ports allows the installation
    of third-party soil moisture sensors and weather detection. Libelium has developed
    a Plug & Sense Smart Agriculture solution [37] for temperature and humidity sensing,
    rainfall, wind speed and direction, atmospheric pressure, soil water content,
    and leaf wetness. Libelium provides platforms and end-user devices that encompass
    communications standards such as LoRaWAN, LoRa, Sigfox, sub GHz, ZigBee, DigiMesh,
    WiFi, RFID, NFC, Bluetooth/BLE, 3G, 4G, and GPRS. Sensor boards can be connected
    to their Waspmote platform to attach 120 different sensors. Libelium also hosts
    an IoT marketplace and provides cloud services to manage IoT devices and online
    programming. Cropx’s [8] IOUT consists of hardware and software components used
    to measure soil moisture, temperature, and EC for real time irrigation decision
    making. PrecisionHawk has developed an IOUT platform [39] using drones, which
    is used for sensing and field map generation. It supports visual imaging, thermal
    and multi-spectral imaging for field map generation in precision agriculture.
    These out-of-the-box packages are important component of the precision agriculture
    to support different types of applications. • OEM components.OEM components are
    commonly used in the manufacturing of nodes at a large scale. However, the prototyping
    or small scale production of very specific UT will also required the selection
    of OEM devices. ST [51] develops internal components for IoT devices like accelerometers,
    gyroscope, and MEMS microphones. Semtech Corporation is a supplier of high-performance
    semiconductors and advanced algorithms [41]. U-blox specialized in communication
    and positioning components for IoT devices [59]. Telit is an M2M solutions company
    with focus in IoT development [54]. Telit provides tailored hardware and software
    solutions in small size modules. Products can transmit data using cellular, Bluetooth/BLE,
    LoRa, Low Power Wide Area (LPWA), Positioning, SigFox, Sub GHz, Wi-Fi, and M-Bus
    wireless technology. Herelab provides proof of concept deployment and rapid prototyping
    service of IoT custom platforms [16]. For instance, in agriculture, sensor interfaces
    can be rapidly attached to a template, and the corresponding instructions can
    be adapted from the code library. Herelab also organizes labs and workshop to
    introduce new tools and promote the usage of IoT devices. These components serve
    as useful building blocks of IOUT sensing and communications paradigm. • Cloud-based
    services.Cloud service allows worldwide access to the information collected by
    IOUT devices without any previous web programming knowledge. Farmers and other
    professionals do not need to spend time to hire another party in order to configure
    a server to make use of the data collected; and can take decision right away.
    LORIoT provides cloud services on a geographical distributed low latency network
    of servers where users connect their LoRaWan gateways. Among the web services
    they offer are the management of devices, cloud storage of data, safeguard of
    encryption keys, and LoRaWan to IP/IPv6 translation [30]. MyDevices offers IoT
    developers services to promote their solutions. One attractive feature of MyDevices
    is that it offers Cayenne, a drag-and-drop IoT project builder. End-users can
    create an account and use Cayenne web and mobile applications to register their
    IoT devices and instantly display sensed data on a fully customizable dashboard

    for IoT (MNSi) and Low Power Wide Area Virtual Network (LVN), that provide secure,
    efficient, and scalable connectivity to low-powered devices [42]. A proprietary
    network operating system handles end-devices messages and LoRaWAN gateways, generation
    of keys for encryption, decryption of messages, and hosting the portal for device
    management, among other activities. Device Lynk offers an online dashboard for
    data visualization of data captured using IoT industrial devices [9]. IntelliFarms
    provides diverse agricultural solutions such as reporting weather conditions,
    providing market crop pricing, and monitoring storage conditions in silos and
    bins. It also host the IntelliFarms platform where customer can get access to
    all their solutions in a centralized fashion [21]. 365FarmNet platform [1] is
    an agricultural data management service that is currently offering free field

    challenges Challenges in design and implementation of a precision agriculture
    based IOUT are highlighted in this section. 1. Due to large area of deployment
    in agricultural fields, low cost and low complexity IOUT devices are desirable
    with ability to sustain rough terrains in all type of soil moisture regimes. 2.
    Improving UTs with more complex functionalities will lead to higher energy consumption
    and faster battery depletion. Thus, improvements in energy efficient operation,
    sustainable energy sources, and energy harvesting are major challenges. 3. Due
    to availability of different types of SM sensors, their integration with communication
    equipment is a major challenge. A standard protocol is required for seamless integration
    of different types of sensors to the communication devices in IOUT. 4. Low-cost
    and multi-modal soil sensors that can sense soil physical properties in addition
    to moisture are required. While moisture provides valuable information for irrigation
    decisions, soil chemicals need to be sensed in-situ for variable rate fertigation
    applications. 5. Advanced security mechanisms are required to protect information
    transfer in the fields. Moreover, field-based privacy solutions are required such
    that information from multiple fields can be fused for more accurate decisions
    while preserving the privacy of growers. 6. Seasonal changes and crop growth cycles
    need to be considered as they temporarily alter the conditions in which the equipment
    typically works. Freezing temperature affects power consumption, but equipment
    can be set to deep sleep as monitoring might not be necessary. The beginning of
    the growing season or a crop rotation can introduce heavier equipment on the field
    and UTs need to be buried deep enough to avoid damages. 7. Due to dynamic changes
    in the communication medium in soil, UTs should be able to autonomously adjust
    their operation parameters such as operation frequency, modulation schemes, error
    coding schemes for adaptive operation. Due to the close interactions with soil,
    these solutions should be tailored to UG communications instead of adopting existing
    OTA solutions [86], [129], [130], [131], [133]. Impacts of soil physical properties,
    soil moisture on UG communication should be modeled. A detailed insight into these
    effects will help to realize a reliable, scalable IOUT architecture. 8. Impacts
    of soil physical properties, soil moisture on UG communication should be modeled.
    A detailed insight into these effects will help to realize a reliable, scalable
    IOUT architecture. 9. Specialized link-layer and network layers protocols are
    needed for UG communications for scalable, reliable, and robust data transfer
    in IOUT. 8. Conclusions We introduced the Internet of Underground Things (IOUT)
    for real-time decision making in agricultural fields. A complete architectures
    for precision agriculture based IOUT has been presented. It has been shown that
    the sensing and communications are the main component of the IOUT. A detailed
    overview of sensing and communication technologies including academic and commercial
    solutions is presented. In-field communications (UG, LPWAN, LAN, cellular) and
    cloud are discussed in detail. Challenges to the realization of IOUT are highlighted,
    and testbed designs for IOUT realization are presented. Recent advances in the
    theory and applications of wireless UG communication are also reported. Acknowledgments

    The projected increases in World population and need for food have recently motivated
    adoption of information technology solutions in crop fields within precision agriculture
    approaches. Internet of underground things (IOUT), which consists of sensors and
    communication devices, partly or completely buried underground for real-time soil
    sensing and monitoring, emerge from this need. This new paradigm facilitates seamless
    integration of underground sensors, machinery, and irrigation systems with the
    complex social network of growers, agronomists, crop consultants, and advisors.
    In this paper, state-of-the-art communication architectures are reviewed, and
    underlying sensing technology and communication mechanisms for IOUT are presented.
    Recent advances in the theory and applications of wireless underground communication
    are also reported. Major challenges in IOUT design and implementation are identified.

    SECTION I. Introduction World population will increase by 32 percent in 2050,
    doubling the need for food. Yet today, up to 70 percent of all water withdrawals
    are due to food production. This demands novel technologies to produce more crop
    for drop. USDA Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) is the primary source
    of information on the financial condition, production practices, and resource
    use of America''s farm businesses and the economic well-being of America''s farm
    households. ARMS data show that precision agriculture has become a widespread
    practice nationwide. In Fig. 1, adoption rates of major precision agriculture
    approaches (bars) along with the total precision agriculture adoption rate (line)
    are shown for corn for each year of USDA ARMS publication (USDA ARMS 2015 version
    was under development at the time of this writing). It can be observed that adoption
    rate of precision agriculture for corn increased from 17.29 percent in 1997 to
    72.47 percent in 2010 with similar trends observed for other crops such as soybean
    and peanuts. Aside from presenting a growing trend in the usage of precision agriculture
    in corn production, it is evident that as new technologies emerge, they are widely
    adopted by farmers. Among the various precision agriculture techniques, crop yield
    monitoring is the most widely adopted technique (61.4 percent). In addition, guidance
    and auto-steering system adoption jumped from 5.34 percent in 2001 to 45.16 percent
    in nine years. Use of equipment and crop location information enables precise
    control with auto-steering systems which reduce production and maintenance costs
    and reduces repetitive field work for farmers. Despite the drastic increase in
    adoption rates of other techniques, variable rate technology (VRT) adoption has
    been relatively steady, where adoption rate increased from 8.04 percent in 1998
    to only 11.54 percent in 2005. Adaptive application of resources like fertilizers,
    pesticide, and water promises significant gains in crop production but requires
    accurate and timely information from the field. It can be observed that only after
    the adoption of recent crop moisture sensing technology, VRT adoption doubled
    to 22.44 percent in 2010. During the same period, crop moisture sensing adoption
    increased from 36.21 percent in 2005 to 51.68 percent in 2010. Fig. 1: Precision
    agriculture technology adoption in corn production (usda ARMS data). Show All
    It is clear that the success and adoption of variable rate technology depends
    on advancing soil monitoring approaches. Despite being the most recent precision
    agriculture technology, crop moisture sensing has become one of the most adopted
    practices. Yet techniques are still limited to manual data collection or limited
    field coverage. Most recently, the need for real-time in-situ information from
    agricultural fields have given rise to a new type of IoTs: Internet of underground
    Things (IOUT). IOUT represents autonomous devices that collect any relevant information
    about the Earth and are interconnected with communication and networking solutions
    that facilitate sending the information out of fields to the growers and decision
    mechanisms. Fig. 2: IOUT paradigm in precision agriculture. Show All IOUT is envisioned
    to not only provide in-situ monitoring capabilities (e.g., soil moisture, salinity,
    and temperature), but when interconnected with existing field machinery (irrigation
    systems, harvesters, and seeders) enable complete field autonomy and pave the
    way for better food production solutions. In IOUT, communications can be carried
    out through the soil and plants from underground devices, and information acquired
    from the field can be sent to cloud through the Internet for real-time decision
    making. Due to to the unique requirements of the IOUT applications; i.e., information
    from soil, operation in remote crop fields, wireless communication through plants
    and soil, and exposure to elements; existing over-the-air (OTA) wireless communication
    solutions face significant challenges because they were not designed for these
    circumstances. As such, IOUT also gives rise to a new type of wireless communications:
    wireless underground (UG) communications [1], [2], where radios are buried in
    soil and wireless communication is conducted partly through the soil. Integration
    of UG communications with IOUT will help conserve water resources and improve
    crop yields [3], [4]. Moreover, advances in IOUT will benefit other applications
    including landslide monitoring, pipeline assessment, underground mining, and border
    patrol [2], [5]–[10]. This paper presents Internet of Underground Things for the
    design of precision agriculture solutions. We first discuss functionalities, architecture,
    and components of IOUT. Then, we present sensing and communication technologies
    of IOUT along with existing solutions. We conclude by presenting IOUT testbeds
    and discussing challenges of IOUT. SECTION II. IOUT Architecture IOUT will consist
    of interconnected heterogeneous devices tailored to the crop and field operations.
    Common desirable functionalities of IOUT are: In-situ Sensing: On board soil moisture,
    temperature, salinity sensors are required for accurate localized knowledge of
    the soil. These sensors can be either integrated on the chip along-with other
    components of the architecture, or they can be used as separate sensors that can
    be connected to the main components through wires. Wireless Communication in Challenging
    Environments: Communication components of IOUT devices are either deployed on
    the field or within the soil. For OTA communication, solutions should be tailored
    to the changing environment due to irrigation and crop growth. In addition, any
    system on the field is exposed to natural elements and should be designed to sustain
    challenging conditions. Underground communication solutions, while mostly shielded
    from the environment, require the ability to communicate through soil and adjust
    its parameters to adapt to dynamic changes in soil. Inter-Connection of Field
    Machinery, Sensors, Radios, and Cloud: IOUT architecture should link a diverse
    multitude of devices on a crop field to the cloud for seamless integration. Accordingly,
    IOUT architecture will not only provide collected information but will also automate
    operations on the field based on this information. Based on these main required
    functionalities, a representative IOUT architecture is illustrated in Fig. 2,
    with the following components. Table I: Existing IOUT systems Underground Things
    (UTs): An UT consist of an embedded system with communication and sensing components,
    where a part of or the entire system resides underground. UTs are protected by
    weatherproof enclosures and, in underground settings, watertight containers. Buried
    UTs are protected from the farm equipment and extreme weather conditions. Sensors
    typically include soil temperature and moisture sensors, but a wide range of other
    soil-or weather-related phenomena can be monitored. Existing communication scheme
    include Bluetooth, Zig-Bee, satellite, cellular, and underground. A UT using Bluetooth
    [12] or underground wireless [6] can communicate over 100 meters, commercial products
    at ISM-band can cover three times larger distances, whereas longer-distance connectivity
    is possible through cellular or satellite. Considering the relatively large field
    sizes, nodes can be configured to form networks capable of transferring all the
    sensed information to a collector sink and selfheal in the event that nodes become
    unreachable (e.g., Irromesh). Nodes are generally powered by a combination of
    batteries and, if on field, solar panels. Cost of UTs is expected to be relatively
    inexpensive as they are deployed by the multitude [11]. Base stations are used
    as gateways to transfer the collected data to the cloud. They are installed in
    permanent structures such as weather stations or buildings. Base stations are
    more expensive as they are better safe-guarded and have higher processing powers
    and communication capabilities [11]. Mobile sinks are installed in equipment that
    move around the field periodically or as required, such as tractors and irrigation
    systems [6]. When weather conditions are favorable, turning on an irrigation systems
    only for data retrieval purpose is expensive. Alternatives unmanned vehicles such
    as quadrotors or ground robots. Cloud services are intended to use for permanent
    storage of the data collected, real-time processing of the field condition, crop
    related decision making, and integration with other databases (e.g., weather,
    soil). A summary of the existing academic and commercial architectures is provided
    in Table I. In most commercial products, OTA wireless communication is utilized,
    where the UT includes a high-end soil moisture and temperature sensor, connected
    to a tower in the field with cellular or satellite communication capabilities.
    Consequently, measurements generally represent a single point in the field and
    redeployment of the equipment is needed after planting and before harvest each
    season to avoid damages by the farming machinery. In addition, commercial products
    based on OTA wireless mesh networks and academic approaches featuring underground
    wireless communication have been emerging. Availability of such a diverse range
    of communication architectures makes it challenging to form a unified IOUT architecture
    with the ability to fulfill agricultural requirements seamlessly. This is further
    complicated due to the lack of standard protocols for sensing and communication
    tailored to the IOUT. In the following, we explain in detail the sensing (Sect.
    III) and communication (Sect. IV) mechanisms with a focus on desired characteristics
    of IOUT for real-time sensing and effective communications. SECTION III. Sensing
    The main functionality of OUT is real-time sensing. An overview of sensing technologies
    is presented next. 1) Soil Moisture Soil moisture (SM) sensors have been used
    for decades in crop fields to measure water content. Important SM measurement
    methods are described below: Gravimetric sampling is a direct and standard method
    of measuring SM. It is used to determine the volumetric water content of the soil.
    This method determines SM by a ratio of soil''s dry mass to the wet soil mass
    including the pore spaces. It requires manual sampling and oven drying of soil
    samples taken from the field. Resistive sensors such as granular matrix sensors
    work on the principal of electrical conductivity of water and measuring resistance
    changes based on soil water content. This method requires calibration of sensors.
    Capacitive sensors measure SM based on changes in capacitance of soil due to water
    content variations. Capacitive sensors, which are generally of higher accuracy
    than resistive sensors but cost more, are being used by commercial UTs. Ground
    Penetrating Radars (GPR) are based on the absorption and reflection of electromagnetic
    waves. Impulse, frequency sweep, and frequency modulated technologies are used
    in SM sensing. This method is used to to measure near-surface soil moisture (up
    to 10 ern), Neutron scattering probes and gauges use radiation scattering techniques
    to measure SM by estimating changes in neutron flux density due to the water content
    of the soil and are the most accurate soil moisture probes used in fields. They
    require specific licenses to be used. Gamma ray attenuation, time-domain reflectometry
    (TDR), and frequency-domain reflectometry (FDR) are other popular SM measurement
    approaches. Fig. 3: Soil moisture sensors: Top row: Gravimetric, resistive (watermark),
    capacitance, bottom row: GPR, TDR, neutron probe. Show All Common SM sensors used
    in fields are shown in Fig. 3. SM sensors are buried at depths of 5 cm to 75 cm
    in soil depending on the crop type and root depth. SM data obtained from these
    sensors is used to create soil moisture maps which help real-time decision making.
    SM sensors have been deployed in fields with increasing frequency. For example,
    the Nebraska Agricultural Water Management Network [14], [15], was established
    with only 20 growers in 2005 and currently serves over 1, 400 growers to enable
    the adoption of water and energy conservation practices using SM sensors. 2) Other
    Soil Physical Properties In addition to soil moisture sensing, other soil properties
    can be measured to populate the soil map such as the organic mater present in
    the soil, acidity (pH), percentage of sand, clay and and silt particles, and nutrients
    such as Mg, P, OM, Ca, base saturation Mg, base saturation K, base saturation
    Ca, CEC, K/Mg, and Ca/Mg ratios. In-situ, real-time measurement of these properties
    still face challenges due to size, cost, and technology limitations. 3) Electrical
    Conductivity and Topography Surveys The ability of soil to conduct current is
    described by soil electrical conductivity (EC). Coupled with field topography
    (elevation and slope), EC data gives better insight into the crop yield. EC (through
    contact and no-contact methods) is used to determine the amount of nitrogen usage,
    water holding and cation-exchange capacity, drainage, and rooting depth. EC maps
    are used to classify the field into zones. Then, precision agriculture practices
    such as variable rate irrigation, variable rate seeding, nitrogen, yield, and
    drainage management are applied based on zoning. SECTION IV. Wireless Connectivity
    Connectivity solutions for IOUT can be classified as in-field communications and
    cloud connectivity as discussed next. A. In-Field Communications In-field communication
    solutions integrate UTs and other communication entities on the field. Most commercial
    solutions utilize OTA communications, whereas lOUT are expected to feature wireless
    underground communications. OTA Communications Existing communication devices
    rely on LAN, cellular, and satellite technologies. For short-range communication
    and networking, license-free standards such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, and DASH7 are
    used in ISM bands. More recently, regulatory restrictions are relaxed by the FCC
    through new rules that allow the use of TV white space frequencies in farms (Order
    No. DA 16–307 Dated: Mar 24, 2016), where interference with other licensed devices
    is not expected. The major challenge for OTA communications is the lack of studies
    about the impacts of crops and farm environment on wireless propagation and associated
    tailored solutions to farms. Most devices used on farms were not designed to be
    used on agricultural fields and hence, suffer significantly. UG Communications
    UG communication solutions enable complete concealment of UTs, which decrease
    operation costs and impacts from external elements. For a buried UT radio, two
    types of communication scenarios arise. Aboveground communications involve communication
    between UTs and aboveground devices. Underground communication is carried out
    between UTs. Furthermore, due to the soil-air interface, aboveground communication
    links are not symmetric and need to be analyzed in terms of underground-to-aboveground
    and aboveground-to-underground communication. In Fig. 4, the path loss of these
    links are shown as a result of field experiments [6]. It can be observed that
    practical underground link distances are still limited to allow for practical
    multi-hop connectivity. Yet, communication ranges of up to 200 m is possible for
    aboveground communications. For UG communications, the communication medium is
    soil, which impact communication success in six main ways as discussed next. (1)
    Soil Texture and Bulk Density EM waves exhibit attenuation when incident in soil
    medium. These variations vary with texture and bulk density of soil. Soil is composed
    of pore spaces, clay, sand, and silt particles. Relative concentration of these
    particles result in 12 soil textural classes. Water holding capacity of each soil
    type is different because of its pore. For example, lower water holding capacity
    of sandy soil leads to lower attenuation and high RMS delay spread, whereas higher
    water holding capacities of silt loam and silty clay loam soils result in low
    RMS delay spread and higher attenuation [7]. (2) Soil Moisture The effective permittivity
    of soil is a complex number. Thus, besides diffusion attenuation, EM waves also
    suffer absorption by soil water content and its variations. Soil dielectric spectra
    and its conductivity depends on the soil moisture. The relative dielectric constant
    range of dry soil is between 2–6 and its conductivity ranges from 10−4 to 10−5
    Si/m, where soils at near-saturation level have a relative dielectric constant
    in the range of 5–15 and conductivity between 10−4 to 10−5 Si/m [16]. Coherence
    bandwidth of the underground channel is limited to a few hundred KHz range [8],
    which limits data rates. Coherence bandwidth also varies with soil moisture, making
    design of advanced techniques challenging. Fig. 4: Communication from soil. Show
    All (3) Distance and Depth Variations Sensors in IOUT applications are usually
    buried in the top sub-meter layer. Thus, in addition to distance, channel quality
    depends on deployment depth because of the impacts of the soil-air interface,
    which causes refraction of EM waves. Nodes at higher burial depths experience
    higher attenuation. (4) Antennas in Soil When an antenna is buried, its return
    loss characteristics change due to the high permittivity of soil [17]. Moreover,
    with the variation in soil moisture and hence soil permittivity, the return loss
    of the antenna varies with time too. Changes in return loss results in variations
    in resonant frequency, which is shifted to the lower spectrum, and system bandwidth,
    creating additional challenges for UG communication. (5) Frequency Variations
    The pathloss caused by attenuation is frequency dependent because of dipole relaxation
    associated with water. Generally, lower frequency spectrum has lower attenuation,
    because at higher frequencies, water absorption plays a dominant role. In addition,
    when EM waves propagate in soil, their wavelength shortens due to higher permittivity
    of soil than the air. Therefore, channel capacity in soil is also a function of
    operation frequency [17]. (6) Lateral Waves For two UTs, wireless underground
    communication is conducted through three major paths: direct, lateral, and reflected
    waves [7], [6]. Direct and reflected waves reside completely in soil and therefore,
    suffer from the challenges above. On the other hand, lateral waves travel partly
    on the soil-air interface in air, experiencing the lowest attenuation. Lateral
    waves plays an important role in extending underground communication ranges. B.
    IOUT and Cloud Due to limited processing power and energy considerations, data
    processing and decision making are not generally conducted locally. Depending
    on privacy considerations, field information can be stored in a private database,
    provided to the public databases, or shared with other users. There are online
    marketplaces where big data sets and agricultural apps are used to analyze a region
    and make decisions to maximize crop yield. Additionally, in-situ SM sensors can
    be linked to national soil moisture databases for complete, accurate, and comprehensive
    information of soil moisture. With the support of cloud services, real-time visualization
    and decision support can be provided. On the other hand, in the absence of storage
    or processing constraints, base stations on the fields can pull meteorological
    data from a weather service or soil information from a national service, fuse
    this information with in-situ data from UTs, and control the farming equipment.
    To have a fully automated system, farming equipment should include a controller
    that can be accessed remotely. Irrespective of in-situ or cloud processing, the
    main challenge is the integration of heterogeneous systems. Moreover, reliable
    data transfer from field to cloud, and cloud to farm will constitute an important
    functionality of the IOUT cloud architecture. This functionality will not only
    help link fields over vast geographical areas to the cloud, but will also facilitate
    local farms to use this data for assessment and improvement of crop yield. SECTION
    V. IOUT Testbeds In this section, we present an overview of testbeds which facilitate
    IOUT developments for system-wide and communication-specific challenges. A. An
    Agriculture Field Testbed IOUTs can be used to ascertain the amount of water and
    fertilizer to be applied using an irrigation control system. An IOUT testbed has
    been deployed on the South Central Agricultural Lab (SCAL) in Clay Center, Nebraska.
    The testbed covers a 41 acres of research field where an advanced center pivot
    irrigation system was installed in 2005 to research longterm dynamics of variable
    rate irrigation and fertigation, crop water and nutrient uptake, water stress
    and yield relationships, develop crop production functions, and associated numerous
    topics under full and limited irrigation and rainfed settings [18]. In this testbed,
    a mobile sink is installed on one of the controller towers. The current configuration
    includes two antennas facing opposite directions allowing the reception of data
    from nodes that are over 200 meters away. A solar panel provides sustainable energy
    in the field. 10–16 UTs are deployed in the field. Each UT is capable of measuring
    soil temperature and soil moisture from four external sensors buried at depths
    of 1, 2, 3, and 4 feet. UTs are powered by lithium-ion batteries and protected
    by a watertight enclosure. The spatio-temporal real-time information from UT is
    fused at the mobile sink and sent to the cloud using 4G communications. The cloud
    communicates with the center pivot controller for automated irrigation control.
    Fig. 5: The indoor testbed [7]. Show All B. Wireless Underground Communication
    Testbeds Agronomy and Horticulture Greenhouse in the University of Nebraska-Lincoln
    east campus houses two wireless underground communication testbeds. An outdoor
    testbed consist of a grid of 4 × 2 underground nodes with an above-ground node
    that can be moved to any location to study aboveground-to-underground, underground-to-aboveground,
    and underground-to-underground communications behavior. Underground nodes are
    connected through power-over-Ethernet (POE) to reprogram and power the nodes.
    This setup provides flexible underground experimentation by eliminating the need
    for replacing the power sources, exposure of the equipment, and the constant removal
    and burial of the node. An indoor testbed has been designed and developed inside
    the greenhouse which supports dynamic soil moisture control for wireless underground
    communication experiments [7]. The testbed is made of 100 inches long, 36 inches
    wide and 48 inches high wooden box with drainage system to hold 90 cubic feet
    of packed soil (Fig. 5). Antennas are buried at different depths and distances
    for controlled wireless communication experiments. Moreover, testbed based on
    magnetic induction (MI) underground communications has been developed in [3].
    This testbed includes coils buried in the underground in lab settings. MI wave
    guide effects and 3-D coils are investigated using this testbed in different soil
    configurations. SECTION VI. Research Challenges Challenges in design and implementation
    of a precision agriculture based IOUT are highlighted in this section. Due to
    dynamic changes in the communication medium in soil, UTs should be able to cognitively
    adjust their operation parameters such as operation frequency, modulation schemes,
    error coding schemes for adaptive operation. Due to the close interactions with
    soil, these solutions should be tailored to UG communications instead of adopting
    existing OTA solutions [7], [8], [6]. Impacts of soil physical properties, soil
    moisture on UG communication should be modeled. Improving UTs with more complex
    functionalities will lead to higher energy consumption and faster battery depletion.
    Thus, improvements in energy efficient operation, sustainable energy sources,
    and energy harvesting are major challenges. Low-cost and multi-modal soil sensors
    that can sense soil physical properties in addition to moisture are required.
    While moisture provides valuable information for irrigation decisions, soil chemicals
    need to be sensed in-situ for variable rate fertigation applications. SECTION
    VII. Conclusions We introduced Internet of Underground Things (IOUT) for real-time
    decision making in agricultural fields. We have presented complete architectures
    for precision agriculture based IOUT. We have also analyzed the sensing and communications
    as the main component of the Internet of Underground Things. Challenges to the
    realization of IOUT are highlighted, and testbed designs for IOUT realization
    are presented. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like

    Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction The Internet of Things
    (IoT) is regarded as a technology and economic wave in the global information
    industry after the Internet. The IoT is an intelligent network which connects
    all things to the Internet for the purpose of exchanging information and communicating
    through the information sensing devices in accordance with agreed protocols. It
    achieves the goal of intelligent identifying, locating, tracking, monitoring,
    and managing things [1]. It is an extension and expansion of Internet-based network,
    which expands the communication from human and human to human and things or things
    and things. In the IoT paradigm, many objects surrounding us will be connected
    into networks in one form or another. RF identification (RFID), sensor technology,
    and other smart technologies will be embedded into a variety of applications.
    As a burgeoning thing, there is not a common accepted definition on IoT. Specialists
    from different perspectives and organizations describe IoT on diverse preference.
    Typical definitions of IoT from different organizations are shown in Table I.
    Following technology evolutions, more and more computing power, storage, and battery
    capacities become available at relatively low cost and low size. This trend is
    enabling the development of extreme small-scale electronic devices with identification/communication/computing
    capabilities, which could be embedded in other devices, systems, and facilities
    [1]. IoT should have the following three characteristics [6]. Comprehensive Perception:
    Using RFID, sensors, and two-dimensional barcode to obtain the object information
    at anytime and anywhere, it will be a new opportunity. Using it, information and
    communication systems can be invisibly embedded in the environment around us.
    Sensor network will enable people to interact with the real world remotely. Identification
    technologies mentioned here include objects and location identifications. Identification
    and recognition of the physical world is the foundation of implementing overall
    perception. Reliable Transmission: Through a variety of available radio networks,
    telecommunication networks, and Internet, objects information can be available
    in any time. Communication technology here includes a variety of wired and wireless
    transmission technologies, switching technologies, networking technologies, and
    gateway technologies. IoT further creates the interaction among the physical world,
    the virtual world, the digital world, and the society. Machine to machine (M2M),
    furthermore, is the key implementation technology of the Network of Things, which
    represents the connections and communications between M2M and Human to Machine
    including Mobile to Machine. Intelligent Processing: By collecting IoT data into
    databases, various intelligent computing technologies including cloud computing
    will be able to support IoT data applications. The network service providers can
    process tens of millions or even billion pieces of messages instantly through
    cloud computing. Cloud computing technology will thus be the promoter of IoT.
    Currently, in China, there are at least 9 billion interconnected devices, and
    it is expected to reach 24 billion devices by 2020. According to the GSMA, this
    amount to $1.3 trillion revenue opportunities for mobile network operators alone
    spanning segments such as health, automotive, utilities, and consumer electronics.
    Many countries consider IoT as strategic industries and a new economic growth
    engine in the future. European Union (EU) has invested more than 100 million Euros
    in a series of projects through Seventh EU Framework Programme (FP7 for R&D),
    and these projects will be actively deployed in smart grid, intelligent transportation,
    smart cities, etc. South Korea invested 27.8 million U.S. dollars in IoT fundamental
    technology development, IoT test bed advancement, and IoT standardization, etc.
    China is speeding up the development of IoT and defines it as a new engine for
    economic growth. The government released the 12th Five-Year Plan for IoT development.
    This plan is an outline program for developing IoT from 2011 to 2015. The plan
    gave the goal and objectives of future development, and the plan proposed several
    approaches reaching the goal. The plan also puts forward a list of methods to
    support and promote the development of IoT\break industry. This paper is organized
    as follows. Section II introduces opportunities of IoT and summarizes its status
    and applications. Section III introduces the policy, R&D plans, and standardization
    of IoT in China. Based on the introduction of Sections II and III, in Section
    IV, the major problem hampering the development of IoT is analyzed, i.e., lack
    of interoperability among diverse IoT solutions. A general open IoT architecture
    developed in China is given. Section V introduces main application fields, examples
    of typical public applications, and examples of industry applications of IoT in
    China. Section VI analyzes further challenges on IoT, including technical challenge
    and standard challenge, and introduces the prospect of IoT. Section VII is the
    conclusion of this paper. SECTION II. Opportunity, Status, and Capability of IoT
    A. Opportunity of IoT The IoT will create a huge network of billions or trillions
    of “Things” communicating each other. The IoT is not subversive revolution over
    the existing technologies, it is comprehensive utilizations of existing technologies,
    and it is the creation of the new communication modes. The IoT blends the virtual
    world and the physical world by bringing different concepts and technical components
    together: pervasive networks, miniaturization of devices, mobile communication,
    and new ecosystem. In IoT, applications, services, middleware components, networks,
    and end nodes will be structurally organized and used in entire new ways. IoT
    offers a means to look into complex processes and relationships. The IoT implies
    a symbiotic interaction between the real/physical and the digital/virtual worlds:
    physical entities have digital counterparts and virtual representation; things
    become context aware and they can sense, communicate, interact, and exchange data,
    information, and knowledge. New opportunities will meet business requirements,
    and new services will be created based on real-time physical world data. Everything
    from the physical or virtual world will possibly be connected by the IoT. Connectivity
    between the things shall be available to all with low cost and may not be owned
    by private entities. For IoT, intelligent learning, fast deployment, best information
    understanding and interpreting, against fraud and malicious attack, and privacy
    protection are essential requirements. B. Status of IoT The IoT can be regarded
    as an extension of existing interaction between people and applications through
    a new dimension of “Things” for communication and integration. The IoT development
    process is a complex large-scale technological innovation process. The IoT is
    evolving from the vertical application to polymeric application. At the early
    stage of IoT deployment, driving of domain-specific applications is the main development
    strategy. A domain-specific application might be a manufacturing control system
    with its own industry characteristics. The application can provide various enterprise
    management services being integrated with the industry production and business
    processes. Polymeric applications are cross-industry applications based on public
    information service platforms. These applications support both home users and
    industry users. The application are provided and promoted by communication operators
    and solution providers with large scale. For example, a vehicle integrated with
    sensor networks, a global positioning system (GPS), and radio communication technology
    can provide comprehensive detection, navigation, entertainment, and other information
    services. By maintaining such information through the public service platform,
    consumers, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), maintenance providers, and
    vehicle management agencies can share these~information and share services to
    improve the vehicle, the vehicle component design, and the fabrication process
    through the vehicle lifecycle management. C. Capability of the IoT Application
    In summary, the IoT applications shall have the following capabilities. 1) Location
    Sensing and Sharing of Location Info The IoT system can collect the location information
    of IoT terminals and end nodes, and then provide services based on the collected
    location information. The location information includes geographical position
    information got from the GPS, Cell-ID, RFID, etc., and absolute or relative position
    information between things. More typical IoT applications include at least the
    following. a) Mobile asset tracking This application can track and monitor the
    status of commodity using the position-sensing device and communication function
    installed on the commodity. b) Fleet management The manger of the fleet can schedule
    the vehicles and drivers based on the business requirements and the real-time
    position information collected by the vehicles. c) Fleet management Traffic information
    system: This application can get traffic information such as road traffic conditions
    and congested locations by tracking the location information of a large number
    of vehicles. The system thus assists the driver to choose the most efficient route.
    2) Environment Sensing The IoT system can collect and process all kinds of physical
    or chemical environmental \nobreak parameters via the locally or widely deployed
    terminals. Typical environmental information includes temperature, humidity, noise,
    visibility, light intensity, spectrum, radiation, pollution (CO, CO2, etc.), images,
    and body indicators. Typical applications include at least the following. a) Environment
    detection IoT systems offer environmental and ecological, such as forest and glacier,
    monitoring; disaster, such as volcanoes and seismic, monitoring; and factory monitoring.
    All are with automatic alarm systems using environmental parameters collected
    by large number of sensors. b) Remote medical monitoring IoT can analyze the recurring
    indicator data collected from the device placed on patients’ body and provide
    the users with health trends and health advice. 3) Remote Controlling IoT systems
    can control IoT terminals and execute functions based on application commands
    combined with information collected from things and service requirements. a) Appliance
    control People can remotely control operating status of appliances through IoT
    system. b) Disaster recovery Users can remotely start disasters treatment facilities
    to minimize losses caused by disasters according to the monitoring mentioned before.
    4) Ad Hoc Networking IoT system shall have rapidly self-organized networking capability
    and can interoperate with the network/service layer to provide related services
    [7]. In the vehicle network, in order to transfer the data, the network between
    vehicles and/or road infrastructures can be rapidly self-organized. 5) Secure
    Communication IoT system can further establish secure data transmission channel
    between the application or service platform and IoT terminals based on service
    requirements. In practice, an IoT application consists of different types of capabilities
    and even applications based on the service requirement. Table II shows examples
    of different IoT applications. TABLE I Definitions of the IoT From Different Organizations
    TABLE II Summary of IoT Applications SECTION III. IoT in China A. China Pushes
    Development of IoT The IoT sensing network research started in China in 1999.
    IoT was positioned as one of the strategic emerging industries and written into
    the government work report in March 2010. The state council’s decision on speeding
    up the incubation and development of strategic emerging industries, which was
    promulgated in November 2010, clearly stated that the IoT research and application
    demonstrations will be promoted. In 2012, the Ministry of Industry and Information
    of China explained the national 12th Five-Year Plan including IoT development
    (2011–2015) [8]. It was the first plan that China government released the development
    of IoT in detail. The plan clearly proposed the development goal of the IoT during
    the period of 2011–2015. By 2015, there should be significant achievements of
    IoT essential technologies, related applications, and standardizations. The plan
    put forward eight main tasks and clearly clarified five key projects, including
    the Key Technology Innovation Project, Standardization acceleration Project, “10
    Industrial sectors \& 100 New Enterprises” Industry Development Pioneering Project,
    Application Demonstration Projects in Key Sectors, and Public Service Platform
    Construction Project. In order to solve the popped-up problems and consider long-term
    development of IoT, the State Council issued the “guidance on tracking and ordering
    for promoting the development of IoT” [9] that determined the development goals
    and threads for IoT in February 2013. The 14 ministries of China established a
    joint meeting for IoT development in September 2013, and organized Expert Advisory
    Committee on the IoT development. The 10 Special Development Action Plans for
    IoT [10], including: 1) top-layer design; 2) standards development; 3) technology
    development; 4) application promotion; 5) industry support; 6) business models;
    7) security; 8) government support; 9) laws and regulations guarantee; and 10)
    personnel training, was issued by the joint meeting. As a part of the Action Plans,
    the strategic alliance for industrial technology innovations of IoT was established
    in October 2013 [11]. Fig. 1 shows the summary of the Special Development Packet
    Plans. Fig. 1. Summary of the Special Action Plans. Show All B. R&D Plans In China,
    the central government established the special funds for demonstration projects
    and research projects to support the development of IoT. In 2011, for supporting
    the development of IoT in China, around RMB 500 million special IoT fund was invested
    into IoT-related fields, 2/3 of the funds were put into R&D and applications;
    this fund has supported 381 related companies since 2011. China government has
    supported 22 National major IoT application demonstration projects since 2011,
    and an announcement was issued by China National Development and Reform Commission
    in October 2013. It was about organizing and carrying out the national IoT pilot
    major application demonstration projects during 2014–2016 in special regions.
    In Research and Development area, the China Ministry of Industry and Information
    Technology had set up a number of key technical research projects on architectures
    and applications such as intelligent transport system (ITS) and e-health under
    the packet of “a new generation of mobile broadband project.” China Ministry of
    Science and Technology also set up a series of fundamental researches for IoT
    on architecture, fundamental theory and design, etc., under the 973 project framework
    (National Key Fundamental Research and Development Plan). The national level IoT
    R&D is distributed as: the enterprises such as operators and vendors provide the
    operation and system development of IoT. Universities and research institutions
    focus on the key technology research, and the standard organizations are responsible
    for the standardization of IoT. At present, IoT-related industry has basically
    formed, and mainly distributed over the Bohai bay area, the Yangtze River Delta
    zoon, the Pearl River Delta zoon, and the central and western regions. Fig. 2
    shows the summary of national R&D plans in IoT. Fig. 2. Summary of National R&D
    plans in IoT in China. Show All C. Standardization The IoT standard system contains
    the architecture standards, the application requirements standards, the communication
    protocol standards, the identification standards, the security standards, the
    application standards, the data standards, the information processing standards,
    and the public service platform standards. The proposed IoT standard set is relatively
    complicated. In China, the standardization efforts started at 2010. The main standard
    organizations for IoT in China are China Communications Standards Association
    (CCSA), China Standardization Working Group on Sensor Networks (WGSN), electric
    tag standards technical committee, etc. These standard organizations are leading
    the standardization process of China IoT. As part of the Special IoT Action Plans,
    actions for the standardization of IoT include to build a standard system, to
    develop common standards, key technical standards, and urgent industry standards,
    to actively participate in the international standardization processes, to conduct
    standard validations and services, to improve the organizational structure. In
    the course of standardization, many research institutions and enterprises in China
    have also been participating in international standardization work in M2M of International
    Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC),
    ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T), 3rd Generation Partnership
    Project (3GPP). China is one of the leading countries in ITU-T and ISO Wireless
    Sensor Network (WSN) Working Group. CCSA is one of the sponsoring organizations
    of the One M2M, and many enterprises are deeply participating in the MTC-related
    standard development in 3GPP. SECTION IV. Open and General IoT Architecture A.
    Motivation and General Description As seen in the previous introduction to the
    current IoT, most IoT applications in China were domain-specific or application-specific
    solutions. The architectures of these IoT systems are fragmented and cannot correlate
    and integrate the data from different silos; these isolated IoT solutions use
    private protocols and cause much problems in information sharing, technology multiplexing,
    network managements, and upgrading. All these problems are hindering the development
    of IoT. In order to reduce the total IoT cost and share information, we need to
    integrate multiple functions and resources into a larger system. IoT thus needs
    to be designed with an open and generic IoT architecture with open interfaces
    and resources, considering different business scenarios, application-based requirements,
    and current technologies [12]. We have thus seen the motivation to formulate a
    standard for IoT integration in order to reduce the total cost of money and time
    from devices, developments, and deployments. An open and generic IoT architecture
    is an integrated solution with interoperability [13], [14]. It will have the following
    characteristics. 1) Standard Interface and Protocol By comparing various private
    IoT systems, a generic IoT infrastructure has the same hardware and software interfaces,
    and protocols. 2) Public and Operating A general IoT architecture is deployed
    to take over public IoT applications with open-operating capability. A public
    IoT system can thus integrate multiple IoT applications into one architecture.
    3) Open, Scalable, and Flexible An open IoT architecture with open resources,
    open standards, and open interfaces can easily extend its functionality and the
    scale of performance. It can thus adapt to different requirements including technical
    developments flexibly. B. Open and General IoT Architecture China Communications
    Standards Association (CCSA) proposed a reference model for the IoT, which consists
    of sensing layer, network and business layers, and application layer. Complying
    with this reference model, Fig. 3 shows its open and general architecture, which
    is layered, open, and flexible. The architecture includes three functional platforms
    as follows. Fig. 3. CCSA proposed open and general architecture of IoT. Show All
    1) Sensing and Gateway Platform This platform connects sensors, controllers, RFID
    readers, and location sensing device (e.g., GPS) to IoT network layer. Modularization
    of hardware, data format, and software interface is proposed for IoT terminal,
    IoT Gateway, and tip node. IoT terminal, IoT gateway, and tip node can include
    flexible modules combined with control module, common interface module, and communication
    module. Common interface module collects physical interfaces of various sensors
    into a common interface. Common control module can connect sensors, controllers,
    GPS, and RFID readers with a common connection protocol. The software and application
    parameters of an IoT terminal and IoT gateway should be able to self-configure
    and self-adapt. Modularization, common interface, intelligent operation, self-adaption,
    and self-configuration are important characteristics of this platform. 2) Resource
    and Administration Platform Network and service layer includes backbone networks
    and resource administration platforms. The backbone network includes 3G, 4G, internet,
    optical fiber network, Ethernet network, satellite networks, and private network.
    The resource and administration platform provides common capabilities which can
    be used by different IoT applications, such as data processing, data storage,
    security management, and application supporting. These capabilities may also be
    invoked by specific IoT application support capabilities, e.g., to build other
    specific IoT application support capabilities. This platform also provides relevant
    control functions of network connectivity, such as access and transport resource
    control functions, mobility management, or authentication, authorization, and
    accounting for IoT terminals, services, applications, users, and developers. 3)
    Open Application Platform Modularization design in this application platform provides
    common function and open application programming interface (API). An IoT application
    provider can develop its application using these APIs. Meanwhile, this platform
    supports application managements. Various applications can be published to the
    application platform and users can get application information and subscribe applications
    through this platform. Convenient and easy deployment, distribution, and flexible
    application environment are the characteristics of this platform. SECTION V. Typical
    Applications and Deployment in China A. Main Application Fields In China, IoT
    applications will be developed in nine fields, including: 1) domain industry applications;
    2) smart agriculture; 3) smart logistics; 4) intelligent transportation; 5) smart
    grid; 6) smart environmental protection; 7) smart safety; 8) smart medical care;
    and 9) smart home, as shown in Table III. TABLE III Main Application Fields in
    China Three major operators: 1) China mobile; 2) China Telecom; and 3) China Unicom
    had announced their IoT development plans. The IoT has been an important part
    in the strategies of Chinese telecom operators. China mobile plans to implement
    a centralized platform [China mobile IoT operation supporting platform (CMITS)],
    and the branch for IoT was established in Chongqing in 2012. China Telecom plans
    to further enrich IoT services based on key industry requirements, to build an
    open platform for cooperation, and to promote IoT business model innovation. The
    branch for IoT was established in Wuxi in 2014. China Unicom plans to build a
    management and control platform and an operation supporting system for IoT. They
    also planned to offer specific hardware communication modules. The government
    planned to provide special phone numbers (1064xxxxxxxxx with billions of identities)
    dedicated for M2M. Table IV shows IoT development plans and actions from three
    major operators. TABLE IV IoT Developments From Three Major Operators B. Deployment
    of Typical Applications 1) Smart City Smart city is a new development model of
    a city using new technologies, such as IoT, cloud computing, and big data analytics,
    to boost the information sharing and coordination within a city system. IoT is
    important means and tools of building smart city, and it is infrastructure-carrying
    smart city construction. Smart city construction depends on a lot of IoT applications
    for different industries [15], [16]. Smart city development plans are divided
    into three stages: 1) the stage for initial infrastructure construction; 2) the
    stage for data-processing facility construction; and 3) the stage for end-phase
    service platform construction. A large number of smart city projects provide huge
    opportunities for telecom OEM, systems integration enterprises, data aggregation
    and analysis/service enterprises, and telecom operators. In China, some cities
    are focusing on improving infrastructure for smart cities programs, and on developing
    regional smart e-commerce and logistics, while other cities are stepping up efforts
    to improve the management of local utilities. According to estimation, the smart
    city market will have a total value of more than RMB 2 Trillion during the 12th
    Five-Year Plan period (2011–2015). 2) Intelligent Transportation China needs a
    solution to solve the problems of increased amount of traffic congestion in urban
    areas using new technologies such as IoT. The Ministry of Transport in China has
    announced a plan that the development of ITS will be installed and in-use across
    the country by 2020. In the next 10 years, the government will invest about RMB
    4 Trillion in intelligent transportation. Intelligent Transportation System in
    China is developing and keeping a high growth rate. The growing speed of China’s
    urban intelligent transportation control system market is high, including electronic
    police, intelligent traffic signal control, traffic video monitoring, intelligent
    Taxi service management, urban public transport information technology, and ETC.
    Until the completion of the 12th Five-Year Plan, 60% of national highways in China
    will have ETC. The installation of IoT infrastructures in ITS of smart cities
    will be supporting fundamental technologies. Connected vehicles and vehicular
    networks have been identified as a key technology for enhancing road safety and
    transport efficiency [17], [18]. In recent years, vehicular network infrastructure
    integration technology attracts a great amount of attentions; it also brings inestimable
    economic value, and will play an important role in the next generation of intelligent
    transportation systems and communication network development. Separately, built-in
    connectivity in vehicles is predicted to mandatory function for consumers in 2020,
    driven partly by the increasing global demand for availability of charging supply
    for electric vehicles. Government, University, automakers, and telecommunication
    vendors form alliances to develop this industry, such as China ITS Industry Alliance
    and Telematics Industry Application Alliance, to develop the connected vehicles
    industry. The related installation of IoT infrastructures of smart cities will
    be fundamental supporting technologies as well. C. Deployment of Typical Industry
    Applications 1) Intelligent Coal Mine In 2011, The State Administration of work
    safety and State Coal Mine Safety Supervision Bureau in China regulated that all
    coal mines in china must complete the construction of “Mine Six-Hedge Safety Systems”
    until the end of 2013. The Six-Hedge underground systems include: 1) general monitoring
    and controlling system; 2) personnel positioning system; 3) emergent shelter systems;
    4) oxygen provision monitoring system; 5) water supply and drainage monitoring
    system; and 6) mine cable and wireless communication system. All the six systems
    mentioned above are based on pervasive sensing, sensing data collection, real-time
    use of data, and deep data post analyses, which is actually based on IoT. The
    IoT can be widely used in the “six system.” For example, it uses sensors to monitor
    miner position and leak of hazard gases. Fig. 4 shows a typical underground IoT
    system. Fig. 4. IoT system structure for coal mine. Show All Built on underground
    industrial ring network and industrial field bus, the system is actually a comprehensive
    underground IoT platform, which transmits data of mining devices under industrial
    Ethernet protocols to dispatch center so as to monitor various devices and sensors
    inside the dispatch center. The overall design of the system consists of sensing
    and equipment layer, network and access layer, as well application and information
    management layer. The system collects real-time parameters of electromechanical
    devices and data of safety systems, which improves the system efficiency and safety.
    Finally, it highly guarantees the correct dispatching and decision-making of coal
    mines. 2) Intelligent Oil Field Intelligent oil field (IOF) consists of a distributed
    system, holding frequently captured data. The data are evaluated and acted upon
    real-time information. IOF brings lower operational costs, lower capital investment,
    and increased yield of oil and gas. Fig. 5 shows the IOF system based on the architecture
    mentioned in Section IV. It will collect parameters through its entire production
    process, such as sensing and monitoring parameters from oil well and gas well,
    metering house, oil station and gas station, and oil and gas pipe network. Sensed
    data will be collected and transmitted for further analysis between the service
    platform and gateway/terminal with a common connection protocol. Real-time production
    data and equipment condition information support the centralized management and
    control at production command center in production control center. IOF can increase
    the integrity, accuracy, timeliness, and standardization of the production decision-making
    for oil and gas fields. Fig. 5. IOF system. Show All The goal and objectives of
    the IOF system are to increase the accuracy and timeliness of product process,
    decision-making, improvement of the system management level, reducing the operation
    costs, and minimizing risk. As a subsystem in IOF, IoT system offers automatic
    production data collection, remote monitoring, and supporting for production prewarning
    by establishing a standardized general service platform, which covers all oil
    and gas wells and fields, metering house, collect and conveyance station, combination
    station, treatment plant. The platform also supports the process of production
    process management. SECTION VI. Challenge and Prospect of IoT IoT trends to be
    unified, seamless, and pervasive. Large-scale service deployment needs to be framed
    within a set of standards. However, IoT involves many manufacturers, spans multiple
    industries, and it differs widely in application scenarios and user requirements,
    which consequently gives impacts on large-scale commercial deployment of related
    services. The development of IoT is a step-by-step process. There are still many
    problems to be solved, such as low power nodes and computing, low cost and low
    latency communication, identification and positioning technologies, self-organized
    distributed systems technology, and distributed intelligence. A. Challenge of
    IoT The IoT provides many new opportunities to the industry and end user in many
    application fields. Currently, however, the IoT itself lacks theory, technology
    architecture, and standards that integrate the virtual world and the real physical
    world in a unified framework [19]. Following key challenges are thus listed. 1)
    Architecture Challenge IoT encompasses an extreme wide range of technologies.
    IoT involves an increasing number of smart interconnected devices and sensors
    (e.g., cameras, biometric, physical, and chemical sensors) that are often nonintrusive,
    transparent, and invisible. As the communications among these devices are expected
    to happen anytime, anywhere for any related services, generally, these communications
    are in a wireless, autonomic, and ad hoc manner. In addition, the services become
    much more mobile, decentralized, and complex. In IoT, data integrations over different
    environments are thus tough and will be supported by modular interoperable components.
    Infrastructure solutions will require systems to combine volumes of data from
    various sources and determine relevant features, to interpret data and show their
    relationships, to compare data to historical useful information, and support decision-making.
    Single reference architecture thus cannot be a blueprint for all applications.
    Heterogeneous reference architectures have to coexist in IoT. Architectures should
    be open, and following standards, they should not restrict users to use fixed,
    end-to-end solutions. IoT architectures should be flexible to cater for cases
    such as identification (RFID, tags), intelligent devices, and smart objects (hardware
    and software solutions). 2) Technical Challenge IoT technology can be complex
    for variety of reasons. First, there are legacy heterogeneous architectures in
    the existing networking technologies and applications, e.g., different applications
    and environments need different networking technologies, and the ranges as well
    as other characteristics of cellular, wireless local area network, and RFID technologies
    are much different from each other [20]. Second, communication technologies, including
    fixed and mobile communication systems, power line communications, wireless communication,
    and short-range wireless communication technologies, for both fixed and mobile
    devices, either simple or complicated, should be low cost and with reliable connectivity.
    At last, there are thousands of different applications; it is in natural to have
    different requirements on what parties need to communicate with each other, what
    kind of security solutions are appropriate, and so on. To summarize, complexity
    and alternative technologies may introduce problems; unnecessary competition and
    deployment barriers in markets may also introduce problems; systems and communication
    mechanisms with unnecessary dependencies may block the migration of IoT systems
    to the most economic and efficient platforms. All the above may block IoT to connect
    as many “Things” as possible. 3) Hardware Challenge Smart devices with enhanced
    inter-device communication will lead to smart systems with high degrees of intelligence.
    Its autonomy enables rapid deployment of IoT applications and creation of new
    services. Therefore, hardware researches are focusing on designing wireless identifiable
    systems with low size, low cost yet sufficient functionality. As the bandwidth
    of IoT terminals could vary from kbps to mbps from sensing simple value to video
    stream, requirements on hardware are diverging. However, two requirements have
    been nevertheless the essentials: one is the extremely low power consumption in
    sleep mode and the other is ultra low cost. Suppose the sleeping time over active
    time is one million, the leakage power of an IoT terminal shall at least be one
    million time less than that of active. It is so far impossible when an IoT terminal
    is sleeping and receiving RF signals. It will be even difficult when using advanced
    CMOS silicon with relatively more leakage power. Hardware and protocol codesign
    for sleeping has been thus the first hardware challenge of IoT. Billions of IoT
    terminals will be used; the cost of an IoT terminal must be ultra low. However,
    so far, there is no low cost positioning solution for IoT, especially the positioning
    precision of a short-range IoT terminal must be high. Low active power is also
    a challenge for low-cost terminal [21]. Traditionally, low cost equals to lower
    performance or longer process latency. Longer processing latency ends up to higher
    energy consumption. As the spectrum resource is very limited at the lower part
    in L band, IoT may use higher RF such as the frequency bands higher than 5 GHz.
    The higher the RF, the more power consumption from RF PA will be. In another way,
    not yet used very narrow spectrum band between two used bands may have to be used
    by future IoT. To use very narrow band with strong power neighbors, the cost of
    passive component will not be low and that will definitely be a potential challenge
    in the future. 4) Privacy and Security Challenge Compared with traditional networks,
    security and privacy issues of IoT become more prominent [22]. Much information
    includes privacy of users, so that protection of privacy becomes an important
    security issues in IoT. Because of the combinations of things, services, and networks,
    security of IoT needs to cover more management objects and levels than traditional
    network security. Existing security architecture is designed from the perspective
    of human communication, may not be suitable and directly applied to IoT system.
    Using existed security mechanisms will block logical relationship between things
    in IoT. IoT needs low-cost- and M2M-oriented technical solutions to guarantee
    the privacy and the security. In many use cases, the security of a system has
    been considered as a general feature. Related research shall focus on privacy
    control. Low cost, low latency, and energy-efficient cryptography algorithms and
    related flexible hardware will be essential for sensor or device. 5) Standard
    Challenge Standards play an important role in forming IoT. A standard is essential
    to allow all actors to equally access and use. Developments and coordination of
    standards and proposals will promote efficient development of IoT infrastructures
    and applications, services, and devices. In general, standards developed by cooperated
    multiparties, and information models and protocols in the standards, shall be
    open. The standard development process shall also be open to all participants,
    and the resulting standards shall be publicly and freely available. In today’s
    network world, global standards are typically more relevant than any local agreements.
    6) Business Challenge For a mature application, its business model and application
    scenario are clear and easy to be mapped into technical requirements. So the developers
    do not need to spend much time on business-related aspects. But for IoT, there
    are too many possibilities and uncertainties in business models and application
    scenarios. It is thus inefficient in terms of business-technology alignment, and
    one solution will not fit possibilities for all. The IoT is a challenging traditional
    business model. Although small-scale applications have been profitable in some
    industries, it is unsustainable when extended to other industries. In the early
    stage of IoT development, business aspects should be considered to reduce the
    risk of failure. B. Prospect of IoT With the development and maturity of distributed
    intelligent information processing technologies, IoT systems will make intelligent
    sensing widely available through information sharing and collaboration. The gradual
    establishment and improvement of the standards system will inevitably bring IoT
    into our daily life. The IoT creates an opportunity for the web-based services,
    thus enhancing the commercial and social potential future of IoT [23]. The development
    of IoT keeps going forward along scale, collaborative, and intelligent. Promoted
    by technology, standardization, and application experiences, IoT applications
    will expand the scale in the different industries, and more enterprises will be
    attracted to come in. 1) Interoperability Information interoperability will take
    place among different things, different enterprises, different industries, and
    different regions or countries; application models will change from closed to
    open and the globalization of IoT application system serving different industries
    and fields will be constructed. Interoperability is the essential issue for crossing
    layers of physical, device, communication (protocol and spectrum utility), function
    and application. These levels traditionally are built with different languages
    and protocols. Level and domain transparent languages and protocols are, therefore,
    needed. A holistic approach is required in addressing and solving the interoperability
    of IoT devices and services at several layers. 2) Intelligent System The IoT will
    bring seamless business and social networking over fast reliable and secure networks
    into our society. System intelligence will be important for the development of
    IoT and the key point will be context awareness and inter-things information exchange.
    Therefore, increasing and adapting the intelligence at the device level will be
    a focus of research, such as the integration of sensors and actuators, high efficiency,
    multistandard and adaptive communication subsystems, and adaptable antennae. Intelligences
    can be introduced using micro control unit (MCU) on upper layers. However, physical
    layer so far has been far behind the required intelligent level, for example,
    to adapt IoT devices under different radio infrastructures. Four parts in physical
    layer must be further developed to adapt to and/or to form an intelligent IoT
    device, which are as follows. Programmable baseband processor will be used to
    adapt to different modulation algorithms, different error correction algorithms,
    different channel bandwidths, and different channel scenarios. Software-controlled
    RF will be essential for transceiver to adapt to the local radio frequency requirements.
    Fully digital RF PA will be the indispensable device to consume less low power
    and offer programmability for PA to adapt radio transmission requirements. Finally,
    controllable integrated passive components will be an essential glue to connect
    intelligent semiconductor components into a sensor node with low cost, low size,
    and low power. 3) Energy Sustainability In the future, energy-efficient and self-sustainable
    systems will be key enhancing issues to the IoT. The ways to harvest energy from
    environments must be developed. Efficiency in processing and communication must
    also be increased through new circuits, new programming paradigms, and the further
    development of energy-efficient protocols and smart antennae. The development
    of new, efficient, and compact batteries, fuel cells, as well as new energy generation
    devices coupling energy transmission methods or energy harvesting will be the
    key factors for the roll-out of autonomous wireless smart systems. Charging of
    global IoT terminals, power consumption of global IoT access points and gateways,
    as well as the power consumption of IoT data processing in IoT infrastructures
    will be one of the dominant power consumers in the future world. Mechanical energy
    harvest will be sufficient for body network as a part of IoT. Solar or wind energy
    is a conditional energy sources which may not be reliable. It can be used for
    battery charging. SECTION VII. Conclusion The IoT encompasses several technologies
    such as information technology, cognitive sciences, communication technology,
    and low-power electronics. IoT creates a newer information society and knowledge
    economy. But the challenges from research, industries, and the government will
    keep pushing and investing. The development of IoT will depend on technological
    advances in silicon scaling and energy-efficient devices, in getting the information
    from heterogeneous sources, in reducing costs, and in improving efficiencies.
    The development of the IoT exposed many new challenges including the lack of fundamental
    theory supporting, unclear architecture, and immature standards. To meet these
    challenges, we give a three-layer architecture including three platforms. The
    proposed acting standard can hopefully balance desires from different parties,
    can open the door for future fundamental theory development, and can eventually
    stimulate/regulate IoT development. Recent years, Chinese government is pushing
    the development of the IoT. Following the Chinese 12th Five-Year Plan for IoT
    Development, China has accomplished a number of demonstration application projects
    such as the smart city and the intelligent transportation system in public IoT
    applications, intelligent coal mine, and the IOFs in industry applications. The
    future of IoT will be expected to be unified, seamless, and pervasive. Large-scale
    service deployment needs to be framed within a set of standards. Thus, the developments
    of IoT as an intelligent system can be proceeding with interoperability, energy
    sustainability, privacy, and security. IoT have become an inevitable trend of
    development of information industry, which bound to bring new changes to our lives.

    rights and content Abstract The design of sustainable wireless sensor networks
    (WSNs) is a very challenging issue. On the one hand, energy-constrained sensors
    are expected to run autonomously for long periods. However, it may be cost-prohibitive
    to replace exhausted batteries or even impossible in hostile environments. On
    the other hand, unlike other networks, WSNs are designed for specific applications
    which range from small-size healthcare surveillance systems to large-scale environmental
    monitoring. Thus, any WSN deployment has to satisfy a set of requirements that
    differs from one application to another. In this context, a host of research work
    has been conducted in order to propose a wide range of solutions to the energy-saving
    problem. This research covers several areas going from physical layer optimisation
    to network layer solutions. Therefore, it is not easy for the WSN designer to
    select the efficient solutions that should be considered in the design of application-specific
    WSN architecture. We present a top-down survey of the trade-offs between application
    requirements and lifetime extension that arise when designing wireless sensor
    networks. We first identify the main categories of applications and their specific
    requirements. Then we present a new classification of energy-conservation schemes
    found in the recent literature, followed by a systematic discussion as to how
    these schemes conflict with the specific requirements. Finally, we survey the
    techniques applied in WSNs to achieve trade-off between multiple requirements,
    such as multi-objective optimisation. Previous article in issue Next article in
    issue Keywords State-of-the-artWireless sensor networksEnergy-efficiency 1. Introduction
    There is abundant literature relating to energy-saving in WSNs as numerous methods
    have been proposed in the last few years, and there is still much ongoing research
    on how to optimise power usage in battery-limited sensor networks. However, none
    of the proposed solutions is universally applicable. For example, if safety applications
    require fast and timely responsiveness, this is not the case for other applications,
    such as in agriculture where the delay property is not as important. We believe
    that WSN energy-saving problems should be tackled by taking into consideration
    application requirements in a more systematic manner. In [1], Yick et al. provide
    a general survey of wireless sensor networks. This study reviews sensor platforms
    and operating systems, network services issues and communication protocol challenges,
    but it does not addresses the energy issues. In [2], Anastasi et al. present a
    valuable taxonomy of energy-conservation schemes. However, the authors mainly
    focus on duty cycling and data-reduction approaches. There also exist several
    technique-specific surveys that concentrate on only one energy-efficient mechanism
    (like energy-efficient routing protocols, data aggregation techniques, energy
    harvesting approaches [3], [4], [5]) since every category of solution often represents
    a whole research area in itself. Our aim is to provide WSN designers with a top-down
    survey that offers a holistic view of energy-saving solutions while taking into
    consideration the specific requirements of the applications. In this paper, we
    propose a new classification of energy-efficient mechanisms which integrates the
    most recent techniques and up-to-date references. Moreover, we give particular
    attention to the design of energy-efficient sensor networks that satisfy application
    requirements. Our study is original in that we focus on the trade-offs between
    meeting specifications and sustainability that necessarily arise when designing
    a WSN. We thus discuss mechanisms that enable a satisfactory trade-off between
    multiple requirements to be achieved. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
    first time that this approach has been taken. The rest of this paper is organised
    as follows. In the next section, we present the main categories of applications
    we have identified and their respective requirements. Then, in Section 3, we discuss
    existing standards for low-power wireless sensor networks and show that current
    standards cannot respond to all application needs. In Section 4, we give an overview
    of the major energy-saving mechanisms developed so far and discuss their advantages
    and shortcomings regarding the set of identified requirements. In Section 5, we
    review techniques proposed in the literature to achieve a trade-off between multiple
    requirements, including network lifetime maximisation. Finally, Section 6 concludes
    this paper. 2. WSN applications and their requirements In this section, we propose
    a taxonomy of WSN applications, given in Fig. 1, and we summarise in Table 1 the
    specific requirements of each described application. Download : Download full-size

    systems have received significant attention from the research community, and the
    corresponding applications are surveyed in [6], [7], [8]. We identify two types
    of healthcare-oriented systems, namely, vital status monitoring and remote healthcare
    surveillance. In vital status monitoring applications, patients wear sensors that
    supervise their vital parameters in order to identify emergency situations and
    allow caregivers to respond effectively. Applications include mass-casualty disaster
    monitoring [9], vital sign monitoring in hospitals [10], and sudden fall or epilepsy
    seizure detection [11]. Remote healthcare surveillance concerns care services
    that are not vital and for which the constant presence of a healthcare professional
    is not necessary. For example, as illustrated in Fig. 2, body sensors can be used
    to gather clinically relevant information for rehabilitation supervision [12],
    elderly monitoring [13] or to provide support to a physically impaired person
    [14]. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Illustration of a body sensor
    network. WSNs used in healthcare must meet several requirements. In particular,
    they have to guarantee hard real-time data delivery delays, confidentiality and
    access control. They must also support mobility and provide Quality of Service.
    Indeed, in the context of early and life-critical detection of emergencies such
    as heart attacks and sudden falls, the real-time aspect is decisive. In this case,
    situation identification and decision-making must occur as quickly as possible
    to save precious minutes and the person’s life. Therefore, the data delivery delay
    between the nodes and the end-user must be short in order to meet hard real-time
    requirements. It is also necessary that healthcare networks support node mobility
    to ensure the continuity of service when both patients and caregivers move. Additionally,
    exchanged healthcare data are sensitive and medical information must be kept private
    by restricting access to authorised persons. Thus, achieving confidentiality and
    access control through a communication network requires the establishment of mechanisms
    for data protection and user authentication. Furthermore, when WSNs are integrated
    into a global hospital information system, critical data such as alarms share
    the bandwidth with less sensitive data such as room temperature. Therefore, traffic
    prioritisation is essential to satisfy strict delay requirements through QoS provisioning.
    2.2. Industry: Manufacturing and smart grids The automation of monitoring and
    control systems is an important aim for many utility companies in manufacturing,
    water treatment, electrical power distribution, and oil and gas refining. We consider
    the integration of WSNs in Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems
    and Smart Grids. SCADA systems refer to computer systems that monitor and control
    industrial processes. Wireless sensors, together with actuators, can be used for
    factory automation, inventory management, and detection of liquid/gas leakages.
    These applications require accurate supervision of shock, noise and temperature
    parameters in remote or inaccessible locations such as tanks, turbine engines
    or pipelines [15], [16]. The aim of Smart Grids is to monitor the energy supply
    and consumption process thanks to an automated and intelligent power-system management.
    The potential applications of sensor networks in smart grids are: sensing the
    relevant parameters affecting power output (pressure, humidity, wind orientation,
    radiation, etc.); remote detection of faulty components; control of turbines,
    motors and underground cables; and home energy management [17], [18]. The main
    requirements of industrial applications are bounded delay, robustness and security.
    Indeed, the products handled in industry can be very dangerous and require special
    care in storage and handling. For example, in an oil refinery, due to their high
    volatility and flammability, products with low boiling points evaporate easily,
    forming flammable vapours. Thus, the pressure in a tank or the temperature of
    a furnace can quickly become critical. This is why strict delays must be ensured
    so that the time that elapses between the detection of an anomaly and the intervention
    of the operator enables the incident to be resolved. Furthermore, in many industries,
    networks are subject to diverse disturbances such as faulty components, node failure,
    disconnections and congestion. This is because sensors operate under harsh conditions,
    as motes placed in pipelines or tanks experience high pressure and temperatures,
    or continuous vibrations. So, industry implementations must ensure data reliability
    at all times. Moreover, given the sensitivity of the data, availability, integrity,
    authenticity and confidentiality are all security problems that must be taken
    into consideration when designing an industrial communication network. 2.3. Transportation
    systems Various studies related to the integration of WSNs and transportation
    systems have already been conducted: they include traffic monitoring and real-time
    safety systems sharing bandwidth with commercial services. In traffic-monitoring
    systems, wireless sensors are embedded on roadways and intersections in order
    to collect traffic data. For example, they can count vehicles in queues to adjust
    traffic signals or the number of toll booths and lanes opened [19], [20]. In safety
    systems, wireless sensors are employed to cope with situations such as emergency
    braking, collision avoidance, lane insertion assistance and hazardous driving
    conditions warnings (stop-and-go waves, ice on the road, crossing animals) [21],
    [22]. In addition to passenger-safety applications, commercial on-board applications
    are being devised by service providers. They include route guidance to avoid rush-hour
    jams [23], smart high-speed tolling, assistance in finding a parking space [24]
    and automobile journey statistics collection [25]. Due to the life-critical characteristics
    of transport applications, the WSNs designed in this domain must guarantee hard
    real-time delays, security and QoS while supporting mobility. For instance, systems
    related to driving safety must ensure tight bounded end-to-end delays in order
    to guarantee response times. This constitutes the main challenge of such applications
    since people’s lives are at stake. For traffic monitoring applications, timely
    information is also required in order to ensure efficient real-time management
    of vehicle flow. In future Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs), safety systems
    and service applications will share the same wireless channel which requires tools
    to integrate service differentiation. Indeed, critical information and traffic-control
    should have higher priority than other service packets. Furthermore, vehicle-to-vehicle
    and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications are constrained by car speed. So,
    mobility is inherent to the automotive domain as nodes evolve in an extremely
    dynamic environment. Finally, the life-critical characteristic of some applications
    raises security issues in the transport network, which may be the target of a
    cyber-attack. Thus, the network must be protected against data corruption that
    could give false information about traffic or conditions on the road. By relaxing
    the power factor, nodes can support sophisticated encryption algorithms to provide
    a higher level of security. 2.4. Public safety and military systems Wireless sensor
    networks can help to anticipate and manage unpredictable events, such as natural
    disasters or man-made threats. We categorise public safety and military applications
    into active intervention and passive supervision. Active intervention refers to
    systems with nodes attached to agents for temporary deployment and is dedicated
    to the safety of team-oriented activities. While working, each member carries
    a sensor so that a remote leader will be able to monitor both the holder’s status
    and the environmental parameters. This applies to emergency rescue teams [26],
    miners [27] and soldiers [28]. With passive supervision, static sensors are deployed
    in a large area such as a civil infrastructure or nuclear site for long-term monitoring.
    Relevant examples of passive supervision applications are surveillance and target
    tracking [29], emergency navigation [30], fire detection in a building, structural
    health monitoring [31], [32] and natural disaster prevention such as in the case
    of tsunamis, eruptions or flooding [33]. Due to their critical nature, public
    safety and military applications are characterised by the need for short delays,
    service differentiation and data integrity provisioning. In addition, active intervention
    applications must support mobility and passive supervision should ensure coverage.
    First, a decisive parameter to take into account when designing a public safety
    system is the delivery delay, as in emergency applications, timely alarm reporting
    is necessary for the system to be reactive. Furthermore, public safety and military
    systems deal with both everyday monitoring data and warning data. Thus, anomaly
    detection alarms should be sent in packets having high priority over regular reports
    through an efficient service differentiation mechanism. Finally, both kinds of
    public safety applications should guarantee data integrity: in active intervention,
    corrupt data could endanger agents by giving false information to headquarters;
    in passive supervision, an ill-intentioned person could circumvent a surveillance
    system by sending false data. In the case of active intervention, mobility is
    inherent to the architecture as wearable sensors are carried by working people.
    Moreover, from drilling tunnels to the fire field, active intervention applications
    are often characterised by their use in harsh environmental conditions. In these
    conditions, the network should be resistant to node failure and poor link quality
    by means of a fault-tolerant routing scheme. Long-term infrastructure monitoring
    requires the deployment of untethered static sensors in order to supervise the
    region of interest. Therefore, passive supervision applications may run into coverage
    problems when required to entirely supervise a building or a tunnel. 2.5. Environment
    and agriculture WSNs are particularly well suited to agricultural and open-space
    monitoring applications since wired deployment would be expensive and inefficient.
    A variety of applications have been developed in precision agriculture, cattle
    monitoring and environmental monitoring. In precision agriculture, sensor nodes
    are scattered throughout a field to monitor relevant parameters, such as atmospheric
    temperature, soil moisture, hours of sunshine and the humidity of the leaves,
    creating a decision support system. Another purpose of precision agriculture is
    resource (water, fertiliser, pesticides) optimisation [34], frost protection,
    disease development prediction [35]. In cattle monitoring applications, general
    surveillance of livestock is convenient to keep watch on cattle health status,
    to detect disease breakouts, to localise them and to control end-product quality
    (meat, milk) [36], [37]. The use of WSNs for diverse environmental monitoring
    applications has been studied for coastline erosion [38], air quality monitoring
    [39], safe drinking water and contamination control [40]. The main requirements
    of environmental and agricultural applications are scalability, coverage and lifetime
    prolongation. Agricultural fields, grazing land and monitored sites can reach
    several tens of hectares, so the number of motes deployed varies from dozens to
    thousands. This is why scalability is an important issue when developing protocols
    to support a high quantity of nodes and ensure full coverage of the controlled
    area. Corke et al. [41] have conducted several real experiments in natural environments
    and have shown that outdoor conditions could be very harsh and impact the feasibility
    of communication. Typically, foliage, rain or humidity can lead to the breakdown
    of inter-node links, resulting in highly variable and unpredictable communications.
    Fault tolerant routing schemes must therefore be set up to ensure area coverage
    and cope with failure or temporary disconnection. In most environmental monitoring
    applications, nodes are static as they are deployed on the ground in fields, in
    forests or along the banks of rivers. Nevertheless, mobility must be taken into
    account, whether this is desired or not. Unwished-for mote displacement can be
    caused by heavy rains, wind, animals or engines. When mobility is intentional,
    nodes and sinks are embedded in vehicles [42] or a natural moving bearer such
    as animals. 2.6. Underground and underwater sensor networks Underground and underwater
    sensor networks are emerging types of WSNs, which are used in different categories
    of applications including environmental monitoring, public safety and industry.
    They differ from traditional terrestrial networks in that the sensors are deployed
    in special environments that make communications difficult and impact their ease
    of deployment. Underground sensor networks consist of sensors that are buried
    in and communicate through dense materials like soil or concrete. Such networks
    can be used for soil moisture reporting in agriculture [43], infrastructure supervision,
    intrusion detection [44] and transport systems [45]. Underwater sensor networks
    rely on immersed sensors and are used in a variety of applications such as ocean
    supervision [46], water quality monitoring [47], disaster prevention, surveillance
    [48] and pipeline monitoring. Underground and underwater sensor networks share
    common requirements such as robustness and coverage. The main characteristic of
    these networks is their lossy channel due to extreme environmental conditions.
    Indeed, acoustic communications for underwater sensors and electromagnetic waves
    for underground sensors suffer from lower propagation speed, noise and path loss,
    which lead to the degradation of the signal [45], [48]. Therefore, they require
    the development of specific communication protocols to ensure the application’s
    reliability. Coverage is also an issue since it may not be possible to optimally
    deploy the nodes due to the ground profile, the costs and the efforts required
    for excavation. Moreover, these networks are inherently three-dimensional (which
    raises additional issues) since the devices can be deployed at varying depths
    depending on the phenomenon to supervise. Besides these requirements, energy is
    of great importance due to the difficulty of unearthing a device to replace it
    or recharge its battery. 2.7. Discussion The main WSN requirements that we identified
    in the different applications are scalability, coverage, latency, QoS, security,
    mobility and robustness. In Table 1, we summarise the importance of these requirements
    for every class of application considered in this section. In these applications,
    sensors are expected to operate autonomously for a long period of time, ranging
    from weeks to months. However, every application is constrained in terms of energy
    due to the scarce battery resources of the sensors, which limits the network lifetime.
    Indeed, it may not always be possible to manually replenish the motes because
    of their number, the maintenance cost or the inaccessibility of monitored regions.
    This is the case of structural health monitoring applications, precision agriculture
    and environment monitoring, transportation systems. Furthermore, some applications
    such as healthcare applications can tolerate battery replacement, but we believe
    that the rapid depletion of the battery prevent their wide adoption. Indeed, efforts
    are still made to propose energy-efficient solutions for body area networks to
    foster the acceptance of these technologies by the patients. This is why the design
    of WSNs requires, in both cases, the development of energy-efficient solutions
    that meet a specific set of requirements. In order to achieve energy efficiency,
    we first present in the next section existing standards developed for low-power
    wireless sensor networks. 3. Low-power WSN standards Wireless sensor network standards
    have been specifically designed to take into account the scarce resources of nodes.
    In what follows we give a brief description of low-power standards including IEEE
    802.15.4, ZigBee, WirelessHART, ISA100.11a, Bluetooth low energy, IEEE 802.15.6,
    6LoWPAN, RPL and MQTT. IEEE 802.15.4 [49] specifies the physical and MAC layers
    for low data rate wireless personal area networks (LR-WPANs). In the beacon-enabled
    mode, the standard allows energy to be saved by implementing duty cycling, so
    that all nodes can periodically go to sleep. In practice, a coordinator sends
    beacon packets to synchronise the nodes, and the superframe structure presented
    in Fig. 3 is subdivided into three parts: (1) a contention access period during
    which nodes use a slotted CSMA/CA (2) a contention-free period containing a number
    of guaranteed time slots (GTS) that can be allocated by the coordinator to specific
    nodes and (3) an inactive period during which the end-devices and coordinator
    can go to sleep. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. The superframe structure
    of the IEEE 802.15.4 beacon-enabled mode. ZigBee [50] is a wireless technology
    developed as an open standard to address the requirements of low-cost, low-power
    devices. ZigBee defines the upper layer communication protocols based on the IEEE
    802.15.4 standard. It supports several network topologies connecting hundreds
    to thousands of devices. WirelessHART [51] operates on the IEEE 802.15.4 specification
    and targets field devices such as sensors and actuators that are used to monitor
    plant equipment or processes. The standard characteristics are integrated security,
    high reliability and power efficiency. WirelessHART relies on a fixed length TDMA
    scheme so nodes can go to sleep when it is not their slot time. Moreover, it specifies
    a central mesh network where routing is exclusively determined by the network
    manager that collects information about every neighbouring node. It uses this
    information to create an overall graph of the network and defines the graph routing
    protocol. In practice, the standard does not specify how to implement such a graph
    routing so some research work already proposes multipath routing protocols for
    industrial processes [52], [53]. While these studies take link quality into consideration
    for the routing decisions, it may be possible to use the node battery-level information
    in order to further improve energy savings. The ISA100.11a [54] standard relies
    on the IEEE 802.15.4 specification and is dedicated to reliable wireless communications
    for monitoring and control applications in the industry. ISA100.11a uses deterministic
    MAC scheduling with variable slot length, allowing nodes to go into sleep mode
    when it is not their time slot. Moreover, the standard defines non-router nodes
    that do not act as forwarders and experience very low energy depletion. Finally,
    the standard requires each device to report its estimated battery life and associated
    energy capacity to the System Manager which allocates communication links based
    on the reported energy capabilities. In addition to low power consumption, ISA100.11a
    also focuses on scalable security; robustness in the presence of interference;
    and interoperability with other wireless devices such as cell phones or devices
    based on other standards. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) [55] addresses low-cost devices
    with very low battery capacity and short-range requirements. It is an extension
    of the Bluetooth technology that allows communication between small battery-powered
    devices (watches, wireless keyboards, sport sensors) and Bluetooth devices (laptops,
    cellular phones). In terms of energy efficiency, Bluetooth low energy is designed
    so that devices can operate for over a year thanks to an ultra low-power idle
    mode. BLE is suitable for a variety of applications in the fields of healthcare,
    sports and security. IEEE 802.15.6 [56] is a recent standard that defines the
    PHY and MAC layers for low-power devices operating in the vicinity of, or inside
    a human body for medical and non-medical applications. A BAN (Body Area Network)
    is composed of one hub and up to 64 nodes, organised into one-hop or two-hops
    star topologies. At the MAC level, the channel is divided into super-frame structures,
    which are further divided into different access phases to support different traffic
    and channel access modes (contention based and contention free). There are eight
    user priorities, ranging from best-effort to emergency event reports. These are
    differentiated based on the minimum and maximum contention windows. The standard
    also supports 3 levels of security: level 0 – unsecured communications, level
    1 – authentication only, level 2 – authentication and encryption. 6LoWPAN [57]
    stands for IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks. 6LoWPAN is designed
    for low-power devices that require Internet communication. It enables IEEE 802.15.4-based
    networks to send and receive IPv6 packets so that small devices are able to communicate
    directly with other IP devices, locally or via IP networks (e.g. Ethernet). RPL
    [59] is a distance vector Routing Protocol for Low Power and lossy networks compliant
    with IPv6, specifically designed to meet the requirements of resource-constrained
    nodes. RPL is optimised for many-to-one communications for data collection, but
    it also supports one-to-many and one-to-one communications. RPL creates a Directed
    Acyclic Graph (DAG) anchored at a border router of a WSN. A node maintains several
    parents to construct different routes towards the sink and selects its preferred
    parent based on an Objective Function that uses routing metrics. For example,
    a draft [60] proposes to select the path that minimises the sum of Expected Number
    of Transmissions (ETX) over traversed links but the design of the Objective Function
    is still an open research issue. Thus, it is possible to create a DAG focusing
    on energy efficiency, as in Kamgueu et al. [61] who use the node’s remaining energy
    as an RPL routing metric. RPL offers other features like fault-tolerance, self-repair
    mechanisms, and security [62]. MQTT [63] (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)
    is a lightweight publish/subscribe protocol for one-to-many message distribution.
    Currently undergoing standardisation, MQTT is envisioned to be the future protocol
    for the Internet-of-Things to connect devices with low bandwidth and power budget
    over TCP/IP infrastructures. MQTT-S [64] extends MQTT for Wireless Sensors and
    Actuators Networks on non-TCP/IP networks. As illustrated in Fig. 4, publishers
    produce information and send their data to the broker via a pub message. Subscribers
    interested in receiving certain data send a sub message to the broker. If there
    is a match between a subscriber’s and a publisher’s topics, the broker transfers
    the message to the subscriber. MQTT-S saves energy by supporting multiple gateways
    to balance the load in the network. It also supports sleeping clients (subscribers/publishers)
    and size-limited packets to be compliant with ZigBee. Moreover, most of the protocol
    logic is handled in the broker and the gateway, which makes the device’s implementation
    lightweight [65]. Although MQTT is already implemented in various projects [66],
    there is a lack of evaluation regarding the energy-efficiency of the protocol.

    communications. 3.1. Discussion Bluetooth low energy and IEEE 802.15.4-based standards
    have been specifically developed for battery-operated devices. They enable energy-saving
    through duty cycling and include optional modes that can be disabled for further
    network lifetime optimisation. In Table 2 we compare these two WSN-specific standards
    with other well-known wireless standards (Wi-Fi, WiMax, WiMedia, Bluetooth) regarding
    data rate, transmission range, scalability and applications. Table 2. Wireless

    In terms of applications, existing healthcare platforms often interface with Bluetooth
    due to the suitability of this technology for body area networks that demand short
    communication ranges and high data rates. However, Bluetooth technology may quickly
    deplete a nodes’ energy. In this case, BLE or IEEE 802.15.6 may be considered
    as alternatives. ZigBee technology is suitable for a large number of applications
    thanks to its scalability and energy-efficiency. For example, in smart home automation,
    ZigBee data rate and radio range are sufficient for room supervision. Nevertheless,
    in a more complex monitoring system, both ambient sensor networks and body sensor
    networks may be integrated together and further connected to the Internet via
    6LowPan. In large-scale outdoor deployment, the Zigbee 100-meter achievable radio
    range may quickly become limiting. In this case, we envision that WiMax-enabled
    gateways will be able to mesh the topology to connect the network to the Internet.
    Thus, the integration of different technologies and standards is necessary to
    respond to the needs of emerging and challenging applications such as Smart grids,
    Intelligent Transportation Systems and Healthcare Information Systems. Standardisation
    is a key issue for the success of WSN markets. Although application-specific standards
    are emerging, such as WirelessHART and ISA100.11a for industry, and IEEE 802.15.6
    for body sensor networks, they can still be improved in regard to application
    requirements. For instance, some research studies propose to optimise standard
    parameters such as packet size, slot length, contention window length or even
    introduce alternative protocols. Moreover, the performances of recent standards
    (e.g. MQTT, IEEE 802.15.6) need further investigation, because there is a lack
    of evaluation concerning these solutions and a lack of comparisons with well-established
    protocols. It also appears that current standards cannot respond to all application
    needs, notably regarding hard real-time requirements and security issues. In parallel
    to ongoing standardisation efforts, many solutions have been developed which strongly
    consider energy-saving. 4. Energy-saving mechanisms In this section, we review
    the major existing approaches proposed to tackle the energy consumption problem
    of battery-powered motes. The proposed taxonomy of energy-efficient mechanisms
    is summarised in Fig. 5. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Classification
    of energy-efficient mechanisms. 4.1. Radio optimisation The radio module is the
    main component that causes battery depletion of sensor nodes. To reduce energy
    dissipation due to wireless communications, researchers have tried to optimise
    radio parameters such as coding and modulation schemes, power transmission and
    antenna direction. Modulation optimisation aims to find the optimal modulation
    parameters that result in the minimum energy consumption of the radio. For instance,
    energy depletion is caused by the circuit power consumption and the power consumption
    of the transmitted signal. For short distances, circuit consumption is greater
    than the transmission power while for longer ranges the signal power becomes dominant.
    Existing research tries to find a good trade-off between the constellation size
    (number of symbols used), the information rate (number of information bits per
    symbol), the transmission time, the distance between the nodes and the noise.
    Cui et al. [67] showed that the energy consumption required to meet a given Bit
    Error Rate (BER) and delay requirement can be minimised by optimising the transmission
    time. Costa and Ochiai [68] studied the energy efficiency of three modulation
    schemes and derived from this the modulation type and its optimal parameters that
    achieve minimum energy consumption for different distances between nodes. Cooperative
    communications schemes have been proposed to improve the quality of the received
    signal by exploiting several single-antenna devices which collaborate to create
    a virtual multiple-antenna transmitter. The idea is to exploit the fact that data
    are usually overheard by neighbouring nodes due to the broadcast nature of the
    channel. So, by involving these nodes in the retransmission of data it is possible
    to create spatial diversity and combat multi-path fading and shadowing [69]. Jung
    et al. [70] investigated how cooperative transmission can be used to extend the
    communication range and thus balance the duty cycling of nodes as normal relay
    sensors can be replaced by other cooperative nodes. Cui et al. [71] and Jayaweera
    [72] compared the energy consumption of both SISO (Single Input Single Output)
    and virtual MIMO (Multiple Input and Multiple Output) systems and show that MIMO
    systems can provide better energy savings and smaller end-to-end delays over certain
    transmission range distances, even with the extra overhead energy required for
    MIMO training. Transmission Power Control (TPC) has been investigated to enhance
    energy efficiency at the physical layer by adjusting the radio transmission power
    [73], [74]. In CTCA (Cooperative Topology Control with Adaptation) [75] the authors
    propose to regularly adjust the transmission power of every node in order to take
    into consideration the uneven energy consumption profile of the sensors. Therefore,
    a node with higher remaining energy may increase its transmission power, which
    will potentially enable other nodes to decrease their transmission power, thus
    saving energy. However, TPC strategy has an effect not only on energy but also
    on delays, link quality, interference and connectivity. Indeed, when transmission
    power decreases, the risk of interference also decreases. Moreover, fewer nodes
    in the neighbourhood are subjected to overhearing. On the contrary, delay is potentially
    increased, because more hops will be needed to forward a packet. Finally, transmission
    power influences the network topology because the potential connectivity between
    sensors will vary, and it also favours the spatial reuse of bandwidth if two communications
    can occur without interference. Directional antennas allow signals to be sent
    and received in one direction at a time, which improves transmission range and
    throughput. Directional antennas may require localisation techniques to be oriented,
    but multiple communications can occur in close proximity, resulting in the spatial
    reuse of bandwidth. In contrast to omnidirectional motes which transmit in unwanted
    directions, directional antennas limit overhearing and, for a given range, require
    less power. Thus, they can improve network capacity and lifetime while influencing
    delay and connectivity [76], [77]. To take advantage of the properties of directional
    antennas, new MAC protocols have been [78], [79]. However, some problems that
    are specific to directional antennas have to be considered: signal interference,
    antenna adjustments and deafness problems [80]. Energy-efficient cognitive radio:
    A cognitive radio (CR) is an intelligent radio that can dynamically select a communication
    channel in the wireless spectrum and can adapt its transmission and reception
    parameters accordingly. The underlying Software-Defined Radio (SDR) technology
    is expected to create fully reconfigurable wireless transceivers which automatically
    adapt their communication parameters to network demands, which improves context-awareness.
    However, CR requires significant energy consumption compared with conventional
    devices due to the increased complexity involved for new and sophisticated functionalities
    [81]. In this context, designing energy-efficient cognitive radio sensor networks
    is a key challenge in the intelligent use of battery energy. Recent cognitive
    radio studies are interested in the power control of transmitters [82], residual
    energy-based channel assignment, and combining network coding and CR. Open research
    issues include the development of cross-layer approaches for MAC, routing or clustering
    protocols that take advantage of cognitive radio opportunities. 4.2. Data reduction
    Another category of solutions aims to reduce the amount of data to be delivered
    to the sink. Two methods can be adopted jointly: the limitation of unneeded samples
    and the limitation of sensing tasks because both data transmission and acquisition
    are costly in terms of energy. Aggregation: In data aggregation schemes, nodes
    along a path towards the sink perform data fusion to reduce the amount of data
    forwarded towards it. For example, a node can re-transmit only the average or
    the minimum of the received data. Moreover, data aggregation may reduce the latency
    since it reduces traffic, thus improving delays. However, data aggregation techniques
    may reduce the accuracy of the collected data. Indeed, depending on the aggregation
    function, original data may not be recovered by the sink, thus information precision
    can be lost. Data aggregation techniques dedicated to wireless sensor networks
    are surveyed in detail by Rajagopalan and Varshney in [3] and by Fasolo et al.
    in [83]. Adaptive sampling: The sensing task can be energy-consuming and may generate
    unneeded samples which affects communication resources and processing costs. Adaptive
    sampling techniques adjust the sampling rate at each sensor while ensuring that
    application needs are met in terms of coverage or information precision. For example,
    in a supervision application, low-power acoustic detectors can be used to detect
    an intrusion. Then, when an event is reported, power-hungry cameras can be switched
    on to obtain finer grained information [2]. Spatial correlation can be used to
    decrease the sampling rate in regions where the variations in the data sensed
    is low. In human activity recognition applications, Yan et al. [84] propose to
    adjust the acquisition frequency to the user activity because it may not be necessary
    to sample at the same rate when the user is sitting or running. Network coding
    (NC) is used to reduce the traffic in broadcast scenarios by sending a linear
    combination of several packets instead of a copy of each packet. To illustrate
    network coding, Fig. 6 shows a five-node topology in which node 1 must broadcast
    two items of data, a and b. If nodes simply store and forward the packets they
    receive, this will generate six packet transmissions (2 for each node 1, 2 and
    3 respectively). With the NC approach, nodes 2 and 3 can transmit a linear combination
    of data items a and b, so they will have to send only one packet. Nodes 4 and
    5 can decode the packet by solving linear equations. Therefore, two packets are
    saved in total in the example. Network coding exploits the trade-off between computation
    and communication since communications are slow compared to computations and more
    power-hungry. Wang et al. [85] combine network coding and Connected Dominating
    Sets to further reduce energy consumption in broadcast scenarios. AdapCode [86]
    is a data dissemination protocol where a node sends one message for every N messages
    received, saving a fraction of the bandwidth up to (N − 1)/N compared to naive
    flooding. The receiver node can recover the original packets by Gaussian elimination
    after receiving N coded packets successfully. Moreover, AdapCode improves reliability
    by adapting N to the node density, because when N increases and the density decreases,
    it becomes harder to recover enough packets to decode the data. Reliability is
    further enhanced by allowing nodes receiving less than N packets to send a negative
    acknowledgement to retrieve missing data. Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 6. An example of network coding. Data compression encodes information in
    such a way that the number of bits needed to represent the initial message is
    reduced. It is energy-efficient because it reduces transmission times as the packet
    size is smaller. However, existing compression algorithms are not applicable to
    sensor nodes because of their resource limitations. Therefore, specific techniques
    have been developed to adapt to the computational and power capabilities of wireless
    motes. Kimura and Latifi [87] have surveyed compression algorithms specifically
    designed for WSNs. 4.3. Sleep/wakeup schemes Idle states are major sources of
    energy consumption at the radio component. Sleep/wakeup schemes aim to adapt node
    activity to save energy by putting the radio in sleep mode. Duty cycling schemes
    schedule the node radio state depending on network activity in order to minimise
    idle listening and favour the sleep mode. These schemes are usually divided into
    three categories: on-demand, asynchronous and scheduled rendezvous [2]. A summary
    of the properties of each category is given in Table 3. Duty cycle based protocols
    are certainly the most energy-efficient but they suffer from sleep latency because
    a node must wait for the receiver to be awake. Moreover, in some cases it is not
    possible for a node to broadcast information to all of its neighbours because
    they are not active simultaneously. Finally, fixing parameters like listen and
    sleep periods, preamble length and slot time is a tricky issue because it influences
    network performance. For example, a low duty cycle saves a large amount of energy
    but can drastically increase communication delays. Thus, protocol parameters can
    be specified prior to deployment for simplicity, although this leads to a lack
    of flexibility, or they can be set up dynamically for improved adaptation to traffic
    conditions. Concerning duty cycling, some work has been done to adapt the active
    period of nodes online in order to optimise power consumption in function of the
    traffic load, buffer overflows, delay requirements or harvested energy [88], [89].
    For more details about duty cycling, information can be found in [2], [90]. Table

    Wake up a node only when another wants to communicate with it Nodes wakeup at
    the same time as its neighbours according to a wakeup schedule. Then they go to
    sleep until their next rendez-vous Each node wakes up independently but its active
    period must overlap with its neighbours Broadcast No Yes No Synchronisation No
    Yes No Energy-efficiency Nodes remain active only for the minimum time required

    Nodes need to wake up more frequently. Either the sender sends long preamble or
    the receiver remains awake longer Examples of applications Even-driven application
    with low duty cycle Data-gathering application with possibility of aggregation
    Mobile applications when the neighbourhood is unpredictable Illustration Passive
    wake-up radios: While duty cycling wastes energy due to unnecessary wake-ups,
    low-power radios are used to awake a node only when it needs to receive or transmit
    packets while a power-hungry radio is used for data transmission. Ba et al. [91]
    consider a network composed of passive RFID wake-up radios called WISP-Motes and
    RFID readers. A passive RFID wake-up radio uses the energy spread by the reader
    transmitter to trigger an interruption that wakes up the node. In practice all
    sensors cannot be equipped with RFID readers since they have a high power consumption.
    This is a major shortcoming because, coupled with the short operational range
    of RFID passive devices, it restricts their use to single-hop scenarios. Simulations
    have shown that WISP-Motes can save a significant amount of energy at the expense
    of extra hardware and increased latency in data delivery. The authors demonstrated
    their benefits in the case of a sparse delay-tolerant network with mobile elements
    equipped with RFID readers. Topology control: When sensors are redundantly deployed
    in order to ensure good space coverage, it is possible to deactivate some nodes
    while maintaining network operations and connectivity. Topology control protocols
    exploit redundancy to dynamically adapt the network topology based on the application’s
    needs in order to minimise the number of active nodes. Indeed, nodes that are
    not necessary for ensuring connectivity or coverage can be turned off in order
    to prolong the network lifetime, as in Fig. 7. Misra et al. [92] propose a solution
    capable of maintaining network coverage while minimising the energy consumption
    of the network by activating only a subset of nodes, with the minimum overlap
    area. In a recent work, Karasabun et al. [93] consider the problem of selecting
    a subset of active connected sensors for correlated data gathering. This is very
    useful in some applications like environmental monitoring, when the sensed data
    are location-dependent, since the data of inactive nodes can be inferred from
    those of active nodes due to the spatial correlation. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 7. Example of a topology control method applied to a network. To ensure
    the field coverage, a sensor must remain activated in each square area. The other
    nodes are deactivated. 4.4. Energy-efficient routing Routing is an additional
    burden that can seriously drain energy reserves. In particular, in multi-hop schemes,
    nodes closer to the sink are stressed because they have to route more packets.
    Therefore, their battery depletes faster. In what follows, we discuss the general
    energy-saving mechanisms of different routing paradigms. For an extensive review
    of energy-aware routing protocols, survey articles can be found in [4], [94],
    [95]. Cluster architectures organise the network into clusters, where each cluster
    is managed by a selected node known as the cluster head (CH). The cluster head
    is responsible for coordinating the members’ activities and communicating with
    other CHs or the base station. Cluster techniques have been proposed to enhance
    energy efficiency because they help to limit energy consumption via different
    means: (i) they reduce the communication range inside the cluster which requires
    less transmission power, (ii) they limit the number of transmissions thanks to
    fusion performed by the CH, (iii) they reduce energy-intensive operations such
    as coordination and aggregation to the cluster head, (iv) they enable to power-off
    some nodes inside the cluster while the CH takes forwarding responsibilities and
    (v) they balance energy consumption among nodes via CH rotation. In addition to
    energy-efficiency, cluster architectures also improve network scalability by maintaining
    a hierarchy in the network [96], [97]. Energy as a routing metric: Another solution
    to extend the lifetime of sensor networks is to consider energy as a metric in
    the setup path phase. By doing so, routing algorithms do not only focus on the
    shortest paths but can select the next hop based on its residual energy. Recently,
    Liu et al. [98] introduced two new energy-aware cost functions. The Exponential
    and Sine Cost Function based Route (ESCFR) function can map a small change in
    remaining nodal energy to a large change in the cost function value. By giving
    preference to sensors with higher remaining energy during route selection, the
    function enforces energy balance. The Double Cost Function based Route (DCFR)
    protocol considers the energy consumption rate of nodes in addition to their remaining
    energy. The rationale behind this is that nodes in hotspots have high energy consumption
    rates. Thus, the use of this function further improves the energy-balancing performance
    of the routing protocol, even in networks with obstacles. Multipath routing: While
    single-path routing protocols are generally simpler than multipath routing protocols,
    they can rapidly drain the energy of nodes on the selected path. In contrast,
    multipath routing enables energy to be balanced among nodes by alternating forwarding
    nodes. As an example, the EEMRP (Energy-Efficient Multipath Routing Protocol)
    [99] discovers multiple node-disjoint paths using a cost function depending on
    the energy levels and hop distances of the nodes and allocates the traffic rate
    to each selected path. The EECA (Energy-Efficient and Collision Aware) protocol
    [100] constructs two node-disjoint and collision-free routes between a source
    and a sink. Multipath routing protocols also enhance network reliability by providing
    multiple routes, which enables the network to recover faster from a failure, whereas
    in single path schemes, when a node runs out of power, a new route must be recomputed.
    The interested reader can consult [101] for a recent survey of multipath routing
    protocols for WSNs. Relay node placement: The premature depletion of nodes in
    a given region can partition the network or create energy holes. Sometimes, this
    situation can be avoided thanks to the optimal placement of nodes through even
    distribution or by adding a few relay nodes with enhanced capabilities. This helps
    to improve energy balance between nodes, avoid sensor hot-spots and ensure coverage
    and k-connectivity [102]. Several works have focused on finding the minimum number
    of relay nodes or placing them optimally to prolong the network lifetime [103],
    [104]. For example, Dandekar and Deshmukh [105] optimise the placement of static
    sinks to shorten the average hop distance of every node to its nearest sink. Sink
    mobility: In WSN architectures that use a static base station, sensors located
    close to the base station deplete their battery faster than other sensor nodes,
    leading to premature disconnection of the network. This is due to the fact that
    all traffic is forwarded towards the sink which increases the workload of the
    nodes closer to the sink. To increase network lifetime, it is possible to balance
    the load between nodes using a mobile base station which moves around the network
    to collect node information. Sink mobility also improves connectivity in sparse
    architectures and enhances reliability because communication occurs in a single-hop
    fashion. Thus, it reduces contention, collisions and message loss [2], [106].
    When controllable, this mobile displacement can be studied to prevent high latency,
    buffer overflow and energy depletion [107], [108]. 4.5. Charging solution Several
    recent research studies address energy harvesting and wireless charging techniques.
    Both are promising solutions which aim to recharge sensor batteries without human
    intervention. Energy harvesting: New technologies have been developed to enable
    sensors to harvest energy from their surrounding environment such as solar, wind
    and kinetic energy [5]. Compared to traditional sensors, rechargeable motes can
    operate continuously and, theoretically, for an unlimited length of time. They
    convert ambient energy to electrical energy and then either consume it directly
    or store it for later use. Energy harvesting architectures often require energy
    prediction schemes in order to efficiently manage the available power. Indeed,
    sensors require an estimation of energy evolution to adjust their behaviour dynamically
    and last until the next recharge cycle. Hence, they can optimise decisive parameters
    such as sampling rate, transmit power and duty cycling to adapt their power consumption
    according to the periodicity and magnitude of the harvestable source. It is important
    to note that nodes remain energy-limited between two harvesting opportunities,
    so they still need to implement energy-saving mechanisms. For example, motes using
    solar panels to replenish their batteries can operate intensively during daytime.
    At night, nodes may enter a conservative mode to useP the stored energy. Furthermore,
    nodes may have an uneven residual energy distribution due to the difference in
    the quantity of energy collected, and this has to be taken into account when designing
    protocols [109]. For example, nodes with low residual energy may be assigned higher
    sleep periods and lower transmission ranges, while those with high residual energy
    may be preferred when selecting a routing path. Another open perspective is the
    development of protocols that consider the degradation of the battery over time
    (leakage, storage loss) [110] which will influence network performance. Wireless
    charging: Recent breakthroughs in wireless power transfer are expected to increase
    the sustainability of WSNs and make them perpetually operational, since these
    techniques can be used to transmit power between devices without the need of any
    contact between the transmitter and the receiver. Wireless charging in WSNs can
    be achieved in two ways: electromagnetic (EM) radiation and magnetic resonant
    coupling. Xie et al. [111] show that omni-directional EM radiation technology
    is applicable to a WSN with ultra-low power requirement and low sensing activities
    (like temperature, light, moisture). This is because EM waves suffer from rapid
    drop of power efficiency over distance, and active radiation technology may pose
    safety concerns to humans. In contrast, magnetic resonant coupling appears to
    be the most promising technique to address energy needs of WSNs thanks to an higher
    efficiency within several-meter range. The applications of wireless energy transfer
    in WSNs are numerous. It has already been applied to power medical sensors and
    implantable devices [112], to replenish sensors embedded in concrete in a wireless
    manner [113] and to power a ground sensor from a UAV [114]. The emergence of wireless
    power charging technology should allow the energy constraint to be overcome, as
    it is now possible to replenish the network elements in a more controllable manner.
    In this way, some researchers have already investigated the use of mobile chargers
    that directly deliver power to deployed nodes [115], [116], [117], [118]. A new
    challenge raised by wireless charging technologies is energy cooperation, since
    nodes may now be able to share energy between neighbours. So, in future wireless
    networks, nodes are envisioned to be capable of harvesting energy from the environment
    and transferring energy to other nodes, rendering the network self-sustaining
    [119]. In order to do this, recent studies demonstrate the feasibility of multi-hop
    energy transfer [120], [121], which open new perspectives for the design of wireless
    charging protocols and energy cooperative systems. 4.6. Discussion It is clear
    that many efforts have been made to enhance the lifetime of WSNs through a variety
    of energy-efficient mechanisms. It also appears that energy efficiency and other
    applications requirements are strongly dependent, so that various performance
    metrics have to be optimised jointly. Indeed, energy-efficient routing protocols
    and sleep/wakeup schemes directly influence network latency. Similarly, radio
    optimisation trades off signal quality for battery conservation, and data reduction
    approaches can affect the accuracy of the collected information. Additionally,
    if sensor recharging techniques are promising, energy-saving mechanisms remain
    essential. In Table 4, we summarise the different energy-saving mechanisms and
    the WSN requirements they directly influence. For example, we can see that energy-efficient
    routing solutions can improve the robustness by using multipath routing protocols
    that provide alternative paths in case of a node failure. Table 4. Interdependence
    between energy-efficient mechanisms and applications requirements. Furthermore,
    in Table 5, we link Tables 1 (which represents the applications requirements)
    and 4 (which represents the interdependence between energy-efficient mechanisms
    and other requirements) in order to show how some energy-efficient techniques
    can be used in specific applications to jointly optimise multiple criteria. Here
    is an example to explain how to read Table 5: in agricultural applications, sleep/wakeup
    schemes can influence the coverage by using topology control mechanisms. The justification
    of these statements can be found in Table 4, and more generally in the discussions
    in Section 4. Table 5. Applications and energy-efficient mechanisms. Given the
    interdependence between the different design goals, it is thus necessary to develop
    solutions that can achieve a satisfactory trade-off between multiple requirements.
    For this reason, in the next section we will review how research attempts to satisfy
    multiple objectives including network lifetime maximisation. 5. Energy efficiency
    and requirements trade-offs In this section, we present the different techniques
    explored in the literature to achieve trade-offs between multiple objectives in
    wireless sensor networks, including energy saving. We have classified these solutions
    into three categories: Multi-metric protocols, Cross-layer approaches and Multi-objective
    optimisation. 5.1. Multimetric protocols As discussed in Section 2, several applications
    require the optimisation of multiple parameters, like delay and security, while
    reducing energy consumption. Multi-metric protocols use various network measurements
    to satisfy multiple application needs. For example, recent application-specific
    routing protocols have proposed to combine energy efficiency with QoS requirements
    [122], [123], [124] or security concerns [125]. These research works consider
    the energy reserves of nodes along with video distortion, packet error rate or
    node reputation. However, this kind of multi-metric protocols raises new challenges.
    The protocols usually rely on a weight function of various metrics and the weight
    adjustments are often made following a trial-and-error methodology. Moreover,
    multimetric protocols require the definition of comprehensive metrics and their
    maintenance in each node which induces supplementary control message exchange.
    For instance, the quality of a link can only be estimated statically through RSSI
    (Received Signal Strength Indication), LQI (Link Quality Indicator) or Packet
    Rate Reception indicators and varies over time. Thus, these techniques suffer
    from extra overheads, but on the other hand they enable adaptability to network
    condition changes to be improved because node decisions are based on metrics whose
    evolution reflects the network status. Below we present some multi-metric protocols
    with energy-efficient considerations. In ATSR (Ambient Trust Sensor Routing) [126]
    the routing decisions are made locally based on a weight function which takes
    into account the residual energy of neighbouring nodes, location and trust. The
    trust evaluation of a neighbour uses seven security metrics such as node reputation,
    authentication and message integrity in order to detect malicious nodes. The protocol
    requires additional control messages to evaluate the energy of the neighbouring
    nodes, and trust levels and weights have to be adjusted to trade off security
    and energy. The enhanced real-time routing protocol with load distribution (ERTLD)
    [127] is a real-time routing protocol for mobile wireless sensor networks which
    makes optimal forwarding decisions based on RSSI, remaining power, and packet
    delay over one hop. ERTLD can deliver packets within their end-to-end deadlines
    while improving the flexibility as it can avoid the problem of routing holes.
    Moreover, it has a higher delivery ratio and consumes less energy than state-of-the-art
    solutions. Kandris et al. [122] have proposed a hierarchical routing protocol
    called PEMuR (Power Efficient Multimedia Routing) which is devoted to video routing
    over a stationary WMSN while satisfying both energy efficiency and QoS requirements.
    In this solution, the CH selects the path to the base station (BS) whose remaining
    energy after transmission will be the highest among all of the possible paths.
    If there is not enough available bandwidth, a CH can choose to drop less significant
    packets according to their impact on the overall video distortion. PEMuR is well-suited
    to surveillance applications, traffic control and battlefield monitoring. However,
    cluster formation is a centralised procedure thus it creates additional overheads:
    each node sends information about its remaining energy and location to the BS.
    InRout [124] addresses route selection for industrial wireless sensor networks
    to provide high reliability while considering the limited resources of sensor
    nodes. The solution uses Q-learning to select the best possible route online,
    based on current network conditions and application settings. A node will choose
    the route that maximises its reward with regard to Packet Error Rate (PER) and
    energy. 5.2. Cross Layer approaches Much research has been conducted to tackle
    energy consumption at all layers, especially at the network, MAC and physical
    layers. It is expected that an integrated cross-layer design can significantly
    improve energy efficiency as well as adaptability to dynamic environments. Indeed,
    cross-layer solutions exploit interactions between different layers to optimise
    network performances, as surveyed in [128], [129]. Sensor requirements (QoS, routing,
    lifetime, security, etc.) are closely linked and require a comprehensive study
    of existing trade-offs. Cross-layer solutions enable the problem’s interdependence
    to be tackled. As a concrete example, it is possible to monitor the battery level
    at the physical layer and use this information at the MAC layer to fairly assign
    communication slots to the nodes. Similarly, it is possible to consider the graph
    of interference when routing data to optimise the transmission delay. Topology
    changes are likely to occur in WSNs and may benefit from a cross-layer approach.
    For instance, after node addition or removal, the neighbourhood is modified which
    influences network density and interference at the physical layer. Thus, it may
    be necessary to reallocate the slots or to change the contention window accordingly
    at the MAC layer while creating different opportunities for path selection at
    the routing layer. Regarding energy efficiency, practices that are generally adopted
    at each layer to save energy such as cluster formation, sleep/active scheduling
    and power control, are jointly exploited in cross-layer solutions. For example,
    Gao et al. [130] took advantage of cooperative communication, hierarchical architectures
    and data aggregation to enhance energy balance among nodes. Chang and Chang [131]
    combined node placement, topology control and MAC scheduling to better balance
    energy consumption. Transmission power control and sleep/wakeup scheduling are
    exploited jointly by Liu et al. [132]. Regarding the optimisation of competing
    metrics, [133] address joint routing, MAC and physical layer protocols for power
    allocation in cooperative communication sensor networks under a specified packet-error-rate
    (PER). Cuomo et al. [134] propose an energy efficient algorithm for PAN coordinator
    election in IEEE 802.15.4-based sensor networks. They combine the network formation
    procedure defined at the MAC layer by the standard with a topology reconfiguration
    algorithm operating at the network layer. By minimising the height of the cluster-tree,
    their algorithm can reduce the delay and extend the network lifetime. Almalkawi
    et al. [135] propose a cross-layer design between the routing and MAC layers.
    Their cluster-based routing protocol balances the load between nodes by constructing
    several paths based on signal strength and hop counts. In the TDMA-based MAC protocol,
    the cluster head adaptively assigns slots to active nodes based on the traffic
    type. Their solution reduces energy consumption and delay, and achieves high throughput
    and packet delivery ratios by selecting paths with better link quality and by
    avoiding collisions and interference. 5.3. Multi-objective optimisation Multi-objective
    optimisation aims at optimising multiple objective functions simultaneously. Nevertheless,
    for non-trivial Multi-objective Optimisation Problems (MOPs), no single solution
    exists that simultaneously optimises each objective function. In this case, the
    objective functions are said to be conflicting, and there are a (possibly infinite)
    number of Pareto-optimal solutions. In MOPs it is preferable to obtain a diverse
    set of candidate solutions that correspond to different trade-off points between
    the extreme solutions. To achieve multi-objective optimisation in wireless sensor
    networks, several solutions exploit evolutionary algorithm (EA) principles or
    game theoretic approaches. The Evolutionary algorithm approach uses mechanisms
    inspired by biological evolution, such as survival of the fittest, reproduction,
    mutation, selection, competition and symbiosis. Candidate solutions represent
    individuals in a population. Each individual possesses a set of distinct characteristics
    and the fitness function determines the fitness of each individual. Generation
    after generation, the best-fit individuals are selected for reproduction to give
    new ones (called offspring). Offspring can be mutated and are then evaluated.
    The fittest individuals are selected to go into the next generation, and the rest
    are eliminated. Xue et al. [136] propose a multi-objective differential evolution
    (MODE) algorithm that produces multiple candidate routes that represent different
    possible trade-offs between energy consumption and communication latency. In [137],
    Konstandinidis et al. develop a multi-objective decomposition-based algorithm
    called DPAP that gives the location and transmit power of each node so that the
    coverage and the lifetime are simultaneously optimised. In [138], the author applies
    an evolutionary Multi-Objective Crowding Algorithm (EMOCA) to solve the sensor
    placement problem in a WSN target detection application. The aim is to maximise
    the probability of target detection, while minimising the total energy dissipated
    in the network and minimising the total number of sensors deployed. Game theoretic
    approaches have been successfully applied for a variety of applications in WSNs,
    as surveyed in [139], [140]. Game theory provides the designer with a useful tool
    to model the competitive and distributed nature of sensor networks. The solutions
    exploit rational interactions between nodes or entities, where incentives (such
    as token or reputation) are used to motivate the players to cooperate instead
    of acting selfishly (e.g. not relaying data to conserve energy). Felegyhazi et
    al. [141] foster packet forwarding cooperation between sensors that belong to
    different authorities. The authority gains a payoff that corresponds to the difference
    between the benefit of data successfully received by the sink and the energy costs
    experimented by its sensors for relaying both its own and opponents’ packets.
    Their results show that cooperation through mutual service provisioning is beneficial,
    particularly for sparse networks or hostile environments where the sinks are shared
    between authorities. In [142], Zeydan et al. introduce the CAR (Correlation-aware
    routing) solution to construct data gathering routes aimed at minimising the energy
    per symbol by exploiting aggregation in correlated data. Every route is associated
    with a cost that reflects its energy consumption, interference, and aggregation
    rate. At each iteration, every node investigates the utility associated with all
    possible paths and then selects the best response that maximises the utility.
    There are many studies that deal with multi-objective optimisation, but their
    practical implementation could consume a lot of resources, which may not be suitable
    for sensor networks. Indeed, solutions that require heavy computational or storage
    capabilities are suitable for centralised computations carried out by a base station.
    On the other hand, solutions that require less computations and storage are convenient
    for distributed computations carried out at each node [143]. Thus, when considering
    MOO solutions, it should be investigated whether or not they are applicable to
    real WSNs since these approaches may be hard to compute on sensor nodes. Typically,
    the major weakness of the evolutionary approach is that the optimisation process
    is performed in a central server and requires global knowledge of the network
    at each node or at the base station. It can lead to scalability issues as the
    network size increases. 5.4. Discussion In this section, a classification is provided
    of solutions proposed in the literature to satisfy multiple objectives. We can
    distinguish the aforementioned techniques based on the flexibility of the obtained
    trade-off over time. By flexibility we mean that the trade-off may change over
    the time depending on the network conditions. For instance, multi-metric protocols
    usually specify a desired trade-off between the requirements at the conception
    phase when setting the parameters. Preference is given to a requirement by the
    designer. For this reason, even if the requirements are highly dependent, the
    trade-off is decided once and for all. In contrast, MOO solutions explore a variety
    of candidate solutions at run-time that represent different trade-off points of
    the design space. Generation after generation, behaviour policy evolves and is
    adjusted to the network dynamics. In-between, cross-layer approaches are expected
    to improve network performances by exploiting the interactions between layers.
    The downside is the complexity of the method that necessitates a good understanding
    of the interplay of various variables. 6. Conclusion In the last decade, we have
    witnessed a proliferation of potential application domains of wireless sensor
    networks. These applications include, but are not limited to, life-critical healthcare
    surveillance, large-scale precision agriculture, security-oriented industrial
    process monitoring and nation-wide smart grid systems. In this paper, we surveyed
    the recent advances in the development of energy-efficient solutions for WSNs
    while taking into consideration the other application requirements. We first categorised
    the different WSN applications and we identified their specific requirements.
    Then we introduced a new taxonomy of energy conservation schemes and we provided
    the reader with a comprehensive analysis of how these techniques can affect performance
    of applications. We finally reviewed some existing methods that allow trade-offs
    between multiple requirements to be achieved for efficient and sustainable sensor
    networks. Acknowledgments The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers

    the need for intensification and industrialisation of the agricultural sector.
    The “Internet of Things” (IoT) is a highly promising family of technologies which
    is capable of offering many solutions towards the modernisation of agriculture.
    Scientific groups and research institutions, as well as the industry, are in a
    race trying to deliver more and more IoT products to the agricultural business
    stakeholders, and, eventually, lay the foundations to have a clear role when IoT
    becomes a mainstream technology. At the same time Cloud Computing, which is already
    very popular, and Fog Computing provide sufficient resources and solutions to
    sustain, store and analyse the huge amounts of data generated by IoT devices.
    The management and analysis of IoT data (“Big Data”) can be used to automate processes,
    predict situations and improve many activities, even in real-time. Moreover, the
    concept of interoperability among heterogeneous devices inspired the creation
    of the appropriate tools, with which new applications and services can be created
    and give an added value to the data flows produced at the edge of the network.
    The agricultural sector was highly affected by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies
    and is expected to be equally benefited by the IoT. In this article, a survey
    of recent IoT technologies, their current penetration in the agricultural sector,
    their potential value for future farmers and the challenges that IoT faces towards
    its propagation is presented. Previous article in issue Next article in issue

    1. Introduction and motivation The term “Internet of Things” (IoT) is a term first
    coined by a British visionary, Kevin Ashton, back in 1999. As the phrase “Internet
    of Things” reveals, the IoT paradigm will provide a technological universe, in
    which many physical objects or “Things”, such as sensors, everyday tools and equipment
    enhanced by computing power and networking capabilities will be able to play a
    role, either as single units or as a distributed collaborating swarm of heterogeneous
    devices. Agriculture is one of the sectors that is expected to be highly influenced
    by the advances in the domain of IoT. The Food and Agricultural Organization of
    the United Nation (FAO) predicts that the global population will reach 8 billion
    people by 2025 and 9.6 billion people by 2050 (FAO, 2009). This practically means
    that an increase of 70% in food production must be achieved by 2050 worldwide.
    The great increase in global population and the rising demand for high-quality
    products create the need for the modernisation and intensification of agricultural
    practices. At the same time, the need for high efficiency in the use of water
    and other resources is also mandatory. One of the most promising concepts, which
    is expected to contribute a lot to the required increase of food production in
    a sustainable way, is precision agriculture (PA) (Zhang, Wang, & Wang, 2002).
    Precision agriculture aims to optimise and improve agricultural processes to ensure
    maximum productivity and requires fast, reliable, distributed measurements in
    order to give growers a more detailed overview of the ongoing situation in their
    cultivation area, and/or coordinate the automated machinery in such way that optimises
    energy consumption, water use and the use of chemicals for pest control and plant
    growth. At a higher level, having gathered information from many heterogeneous
    systems, well-evaluated scientific knowledge can be organised in the form of smart
    algorithms to provide a better insight into the ongoing processes, do the reasoning
    of the current situation and make predictions based on heterogeneous inputs, produce
    early warnings about potential dangers that threaten the cultivars, and improved
    automated control signals, based on plant responses (Kacira et al., 2005, Körner
    and Van Straten, 2008). The algorithms required to handle the distributed data
    in real time are far too complicated to run locally on a low-power Wireless Sensor
    Network (WSN) node. However, in the context of IoT, all the objects will be interconnected,
    and therefore the computational overhead can be easily shifted to the cloud or
    be distributed among more than one interconnected devices. The greatly increasing
    interest in IoT in agriculture can be roughly seen in Fig. 1. The increase in
    the appearance of the term “IoT” along with the term “Agriculture” in the international
    scientific literature is rather indicative. These data motivated us to present
    an overview of the state-of-the-art research on IoT in its various forms, appearing
    in the agricultural sector, rather than a generic review. For this reason, a research
    methodology was adopted derived from the existing guidelines used by medical researchers,
    adapted and optimised for software engineering matters (Kitchenham, 2004). According
    to this methodology, a selection of recent literature was done, setting the year
    2010 as starting point. The 2010 starting point year was determined because it
    is then when a significant number of publications appeared. Moreover, technologies
    and approaches before 2010 are quite obsolete at the time of writing the present
    manuscript. Other selection criteria included the multidisciplinary nature of
    a publication. Works utilising more than one technology in order to synthesise
    their solutions were considered as IoT-oriented; for instance, cloud and embedded
    devices/wireless sensors, or, works that make use of more than one type of end
    devices (things) within the same network. Having none of the aforementioned restrictions,
    the reviewed literature area would be too wide and out of the scope of this work.
    Moreover, this paper seeks to present research that adopts newer architectures,
    closer to the principles of IoT. Download : Download high-res image (97KB) Download

    to “IoT in Agriculture”, as they appear in Scopus. This paper begins with an introduction
    in the recent trends in the technologies, which represent the building blocks
    of IoT, such as the Radio Frequency Identification Radio Frequency Identification
    (RFID), wireless sensor networks, the addressing of the “things” in a common network,
    as well as the applications running on the cloud. Following the same categorisation,
    several works are presented, which incorporate one or more of the IoT aspects
    and focus on the agricultural sector. Some of the most popular hardware platforms,
    met in agricultural deployments, is also surveyed. The review closes with a discussion
    on future challenges and their effect on IoT spreading, which has effects on the
    adoption of IoT in the agricultural sector too. One of the goals of this work
    is to provide the members of a multidisciplinary community, such as the researchers
    working on deploying innovative monitoring, tracking, decision support and control
    systems, with a handful manuscript that summarises the latest advances in embedded
    devices, sensor modules, wireless communication technologies, programming paradigms
    and cloud services suitable, or optimised, for use in agriculture. Some of the
    most common keywords appearing in the presented literature are presented in Fig.

    Keyword distribution in the presented literature. 2. Internet of Things enabling
    technologies The structure of IoT is based on three layers; namely, the perception
    layer (sensing), the network layer (data transfer), and the application layer
    (data storage and manipulation). Despite great improvements, IoT is still evolving,
    trying to obtain its final shape, as can be seen in several reviews (Atzori et
    al., 2010, Botta et al., 2014, Gubbi et al., 2013, Miorandi et al., 2012). As
    the term “Internet” implies, networking capability is one of the core features
    of the IoT devices. The internet as we know it today is mostly an internet of
    human end-users, while the IoT will be an internet of non-human entities, therefore
    a lot of machine-to-machine (M2M) communication will take place. 2.1. Layer 1:
    the perception layer At the perception layer, we meet technologies such as WSN,
    RFID and, recently, Near Field Communications (NFC). There is some overlap between
    WSN and RFID technologies, since semi-passive and active RFID tags can also be
    regarded as wireless nodes with lower computational and storage capacity. Typically,
    a wireless sensor node consists of a processing module, usually a low-power microcontroller
    unit (MCU), one or more sensor modules (embedded or external analogue or digital
    sensing devices) and an RF communication module, usually supporting a low-power
    wireless communication technology (Fig. 3). Download : Download high-res image
    (202KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. The architecture of a typical
    wireless sensor node. Apart from monitoring and control during the production
    process, there is a need for monitoring, identification and tracking of agricultural
    and livestock products after harvest. WSNs are often met in several works related
    to monitoring and climate control of storage and logistics facilities. RFID technology
    is considered the first, and most basic, example of interconnected “Things”. RFID
    tags contain data in the form of the Electronic Product Code (EPC) and the RFID
    Readers are triggering, reading and manipulating a large number of tags. Offering
    object identification, tracking and data storage on active or passive (without
    the need for embedded power supply) tags, RFID and NFC technologies play an important
    role in the agricultural domain. Typical user scenarios include products or livestock
    monitoring, supply chain and quality control tracking and lifecycle assessment
    of agricultural products (Welbourne et al., 2009). 2.2. Layer 2: the network layer
    At the second layer of IoT, wireless sensor nodes interacting with physical objects
    and/or their environment, communicate with their neighbouring nodes or a gateway,
    building networks through which the data are usually forwarded towards a remote
    infrastructure for storage, further analysis, processing and dissemination of
    the valuable knowledge that can be extracted (Gubbi et al., 2013). When it comes
    to wireless communications, a large scientific literature has been created on
    sensor networks, addressing several problems, such as energy efficiency, networking
    features, scalability and robustness (Atzori et al., 2010). Communication protocols
    built over wireless standards, such as 802.15.4, facilitate the device networking
    and bridge the gap between the internet-enabled gateways and the end-nodes. Such
    protocols include ZigBee, ONE-NET, Sigfox, WirelessHART, ISA100.11a, and 6LowPan,
    to name a few (Suhonen, Kohvakka, Kaseva, Hämäläinen, & Hännikäinen, 2012). Bluetooth
    Low Energy (BLE), LoRa/LoRaWAN, DASH7 and low-power WiFi have also appeared in
    several deployments recently. 2.3. Layer 3: the application layer The application
    layer is the third layer of the IoT. It is of high importance and, in many ways,
    it is this that facilitates the realisation of the IoT. The application layer
    faces several issues which have to be resolved, such as the identification of
    the devices as unique entities. Identifying and addressing billions of devices
    around the globe will provide a direct, internet-like access and control over
    them through the future internet. The uniqueness of identity, reliability, persistence
    and scalability represent important features of the addressing schema (Gubbi et
    al., 2013). IPv6, with its internet mobility aspects, could alleviate some of
    the device identification problems and is expected to play a vital role in this
    field (Botta et al., 2014). However, the heterogeneous nature of wireless nodes,
    the variability of data types, concurrent operations and confluence of data from
    the devices amplifies the problem even further (Zorzi, Gluhak, Lange, & Bassi,
    2010). Meta-data and context-aware addressing, supplementary to IPv6, are expected
    to contribute a lot while dealing with the above-mentioned challenges (Kalmar,
    Vida, & Maliosz, 2013). Heterogeneity is another big challenge in the IoT world.
    The vision of IoT is to allow billions of devices, with great diversity in their
    technical specifications (form factor, power supply, environmental capabilities,
    compatibility with other devices), computing power, peripheral devices and networking
    subsystems to co-exist in one inter-network. Middleware is a software layer, composed
    of sub-layers located between the devices and the application layer, abstracting
    the device functionalities and technical specificities and providing developers
    with sets of more generic tools to build their applications (Fig. 4). Middleware
    has gained much attention due to its major role in simplifying the development
    of new services and the integration of legacy technologies into new ones (Atzori
    et al., 2010). Furthermore, middleware is the mechanism that combines the cloud
    infrastructure with a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and the sensor networks
    in a generic manner, ready to provide appropriate tools for any type of deployment
    (Ghosh & Das, 2008). SOA approach benefits the enterprise by reducing the time
    invested in adapting itself to the changes imposed by the market and allows software
    and hardware reuse, since it is technology independent, when it comes to service
    implementations (Pasley, 2005). Future agricultural IoT interconnected devices
    may include sensors, connected machinery and vehicles, weather stations, internet
    gateways, network storage, RFID scanners, smartphones, tablets, wearables and
    many other devices. Download : Download high-res image (233KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. Software layers over heterogeneous devices and operating
    systems presenting how the Middleware layer serves in order to make it possible
    for a single/common application to run seamlessly on several platforms and operating
    systems. Finally, in order for the sensed data to have a real value for the end-user
    or another system (in case of M2M scenarios) they have to be stored, analysed,
    synthesised and presented in an understandable and intuitive manner. Big Data
    is one side-effect of the continuous data flow coming from billions of geo-distributed
    devices and has three dimensions, namely volume, variety and velocity (Beyer,
    2011). The Cloud with its virtually unlimited computational and storage capacity
    is the only technology capable of withstanding the IoT workload. In modern agricultural
    scenarios, stored data are automatically processed, corrected and used or combined
    under artificial intelligence algorithms, machine learning technologies, and decision-making
    systems based on models, in order to extract knowledge about phenomena, which
    cannot be directly measured. These systems can either propose the optimal tactic
    to the end-user, or produce the appropriate control signals for actuator devices,
    offering fully-automated sensing and control solutions. Plenty of studies have
    focussed on the standardisation of the IoT core technologies (Jazayeri et al.,
    2015, Sawant et al., 2014). The classical WSN/WSAN (Wireless Sensor-Actor Network)
    paradigm, i.e. distributed smart devices sensing and transferring data to a sink
    and/or driving one or more actuators, moves one step further towards interoperability
    of devices and objects. Other aspects of IoT include technologies that support
    the intercommunication among devices and/or end-users, as well as the platforms,
    the software, the hardware abstractions and the programming tools, over which
    developers and providers can build new applications and services (Atzori et al.,
    2010, Miorandi et al., 2012). The IoT paradigm is driven by the principles: “Anything
    communicates – anything is identified – anything interacts”. 3. Internet of Things
    hardware, platforms and sensors in agriculture 3.1. Low-power wireless sensor
    networks In the recent literature, a large number of embedded programmable devices
    have been used. Some are custom-built, while others are either commercial programmable
    boards or complete, closed-source sensing/monitoring solutions. Researchers choose
    their equipment depending on the research priorities set, or the main focus of
    each study. Commercial sensing solutions provide a number of features out of the
    box, allowing researchers to focus on other aspects of IoT deployments, like meta-processing,
    smart algorithms for monitoring and control, cloud interoperability, etc. (Edwards
    Murphy et al., 2015, Mamduh et al., 2012, Yu et al., 2011). Programmable, open
    solutions, on the other hand, provide developers the flexibility to have full
    control over the behaviour of the nodes and the network and program new peripheral
    devices to make them compatible with the nodes, like new sensor or actuator modules
    (Akshay et al., 2012; Wu, Li, Ma, Qiu, & He, 2012; Hou and Gao, 2010, Jayaraman
    et al., 2015a, Jimenez et al., 2012, Park and Park, 2011). The potential applications
    of IoT in agriculture cover a large number of scenarios. Barcelo-Ordinas, Chanet,
    Hou, & Garcia-Vidal (2016) categorise them in networks of scalar sensors, utilised
    in sensing and control of agricultural infrastructures, such as greenhouses, multimedia
    sensor networks for the remote image capturing and processing for the detection
    of insects and plant diseases, and tag-based networks (RFID, NFC) for product
    tracking and remote identification. Especially in the case of WSN in agriculture,
    the specific characteristics of the situation and the environment, in which the
    nodes will be deployed, should be taken into account. Crops, or other obstacles
    in farmlands whose positions may move, cause considerable interference in the
    communication between nodes. This varying movement of obstacles affects the connection
    quality of links, making it variable with space and time, affecting the deployment,
    routing, failure diagnosis, and other aspects of WSN. Harsh environmental factors
    such as temperature, humidity, rainfall and high solar radiation, the effect of
    shading by the plant leaves, as well as the noise produced by building structures,
    such as greenhouses, extend the spatiotemporal climatic variation, greatly affecting
    the links and communication quality among the nodes (Wang, Yang, & Mao, 2017).
    The periodic nature of the recorded phenomena in agricultural installations usually
    drive the development of the applications. This characteristic sets the requirements
    and provides opportunities for novel duty-cycle control, sampling scheduling,
    data reconstructions, as well as data storage and query, intelligent control,
    and so on (Ahonen et al., 2008, Mottola and Picco, 2011; Pawlowski et al., 2008).
    Therefore, the choice of the correct IoT platform to build a deployment could
    affect the overall success of the project. A summary of some of the popular programmable
    boards and embedded platforms used in recent deployments is presented in Table

    for agricultural Internet of Things/Wireless Sensor Network deployments Although
    many theoretical aspects of WSN have been extensively studied in literature, realistic
    IoT/WSN deployments in agricultural sector are quite demanding and remain a challenging
    task. Sensor modules need to be accurate enough, with the appropriate measuring
    range for the situation at hand, and shielded against environmental factors which
    can either create false readings or even destroy the sensor permanently. Due to
    the distributed nature of IoT, in cases of battery-operated nodes, placed in open
    fields or other agricultural facilities, replacing the power source can be a very
    difficult task, if not impossible. Therefore, very strict power constraints affect
    the selection of hardware and the low-power features of the selected peripheral
    devices are always considered when designing a new system. Software-wise the components
    which are to be integrated in order to implement the functionality of an end-device
    have to be carefully inspected. The final functional code requires deep embedded
    software engineering knowledge and sufficient testing to avoid failures in the
    field (Barrenetxea et al., 2008, Langendoen et al., 2006). . Other characteristics
    making a low-power, embedded device selectable for a deployment are its long-term
    stability, the number of digital and analogue inputs/outputs which determines
    the number of peripheral devices (sensors and actuators) that can be supported,
    the ability to be sustainable through power harvesting modules, and, the effort
    required for its programming. 3.3. Wireless communication protocols in agriculture
    The dominant wireless technologies in the domain of IoT are separated into seven
    main categories, namely, Global System for Mobile Communications (Groupe Spécial
    Mobile – GSM) offered by authorised operators, Wireless Personal Area Networks
    (WPAN), Wireless Regional Area Networks (Cognitive Radio/WRAN), Mesh, Point-to-Point
    (P2P) and Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPN/LPWAN). GSM standard is further divided
    into GSM EDGE Radio Access Network (GERAN) and UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network
    (UTRAN). Numerous wireless devices have been developed upon the various wireless
    standards. As in many aspects of IoT, interoperability is the biggest challenge.
    Another challenge, which is common in the wireless communications, is the interference
    among devices that operate in the same band (Bluetooth, ZigBee and WiFi, for instance)
    or in neighbouring bands. An attempt to summarise the most popular IoT wireless
    standards is presented in Table 2. Table 2. Summary table of the most popular

    provide a wide variety of bandwidth, communication range, power consumption and
    security measures. The variety of technologies and standards, as well as the differentiation
    among the IoT projects and their specific requirements, hamper interoperability
    at the networking layer. When it comes to agricultural deployments, high temperature,
    and high humidity are two very common phenomena. Based on the observations of
    Bannister, Giorgetti, and Gupta (2008), temperature has a significant effect on
    the received signal strength (RSS) when it rises from 25 °C to 65 °C. Similar
    results were presented by Boano, Tsiftes, Voigt, Brown, and Roedig (2010). Furthermore,
    humidity can also be very high in agricultural deployments. In the case of open
    fields, the wireless nodes are directly exposed to rain or irrigation systems.
    In greenhouses, relative humidity can be over 80% for long periods too. Humidity
    has been shown to strongly affect radio wave propagation (Room and Tate, 2007,
    Thelen, 2004). Therefore, the number of nodes, the distance between them, the
    height of the antenna, and the operating frequency based on the desired size of
    messages are serious matters to be taken into consideration, when choosing a wireless
    transceiver for an agricultural deployment. 4. Applications in agriculture The
    general overview of IoT structural elements presented in Section 2 clearly reveals
    the great potential of these technologies in the domains of Agriculture and the
    recent trend of Precision Agriculture (PA). Recent advances in sensor technology,
    along with the miniaturisation of electronics and the great drop in their cost
    have contributed a lot to the technological evolution of traditional agriculture
    to precision and micro-precision agriculture (Kacira et al., 2005). Climate sensors,
    ground sensors, radiation sensors, weather stations (made of sensors) emphasise
    that it is all about sensors and sensor data flows, which are stored and used
    for monitoring, knowledge mining, reasoning, and control. Additionally, in recent
    years, there is an increasing demand for high quality and safe agricultural products.
    This trend has yielded the need for interoperable, distributed, robust, and accurate
    logistics traceability systems. The IoT family of technologies provides all the
    appropriate tools for building and maintaining such infrastructure and services,
    specially designed to support supply chains in agricultural and floricultural
    sectors (Verdouw, Beulens, & van der Vorst, 2013). 4.1. Agricultural monitoring
    and control Sensors, in the form of wired and wireless sensors, have been widely
    used in agriculture during the last decades. Sensing the environment in which
    production occurs, and, more recently, the responses of the plants to the climate
    (Nishina, 2015), is crucial for taking the correct and more precise decisions,
    optimising productivity and quality of the cultivars. The traditional WSN have
    recently evolved to IoT-friendly-WSN, by adopting more generic standards in terms
    of communication, allowing remote access to the internet and implementing smart
    algorithms for meta-processing of the data aiming to improve monitoring and/or
    control. Versatile devices, with high computational abilities, very convenient
    form factor and low cost, can nowadays be used, on batteries, and operate for
    long periods, with or without the assistance of power harvesting modules. In addition,
    modern embedded devices have sufficient resources to support more demanding sensors,
    such as image sensors, and the support of more sophisticated networking protocols,
    such TCP/IP, extending the traditional WSN networking capabilities. A rough classification
    of literature on monitoring and control could be: - Monitoring and, in some cases,
    creation of early warnings, via simplified rules. This includes multi-point monitoring
    for catching and absorbing climatic gradients in greenhouse cultivation (Katsoulas
    et al., 2017a, Tolle et al., 2005). - Monitoring, meta-processing (algorithm/model
    implementations on the server/cloud side) and control, including control suggestions
    to the user and fully automated control (Aiello, Giovino, Vallone, Catania, &
    Argento, 2017). - Monitoring using more computationally demanding sensors, such
    as image sensors and more powerful end-nodes. Captured images are used either
    for plain monitoring of the system, or utilised for image processing on-board,
    at the edge of the network (Fog computing) or on a cloud/server-based infrastructure
    (Katsoulas et al., 2016, Ravikanth et al., 2017, Senthilkumar et al., 2016). Sensing
    is of high importance in agriculture. WSNs have been widely used in climate and
    soil monitoring deployments both in open field and in controlled environment agriculture.
    4.2. Controlled environment agriculture Greenhouses have been shown to present
    significant climate variability, which affects the productivity of the plants
    (Kittas, Bartzanas, & Jaffrin, 2003), if not harming them. Greenhouse cultivation
    is more intense, therefore, in many cases, it requires higher precision in terms
    of monitoring and control (Fig. 4). Several studies have focussed only on localised
    and remote monitoring. In most cases data are stored and represented in various
    graphical ways (Wu et al., 2012; Jimenez et al., 2012; Katsoulas, Bartzanas, &
    Kittas, 2017; Yu et al., 2011, Zhao et al., 2010). In addition to the high-precision
    monitoring, there have been studies presenting systems which incorporate meta-processing
    procedures with data transferred on remote infrastructures through the internet.
    Utilising well-evaluated equations, crop and climate models, such systems produce
    assessments of the climate and/or crop status in order for the grower to take
    better decisions or get early warnings (Ferentinos et al., 2015, Fernandes et
    al., 2013, Hernandez and Park, 2011, Hu and Qian, 2011, Jiao et al., 2014, Katsoulas
    et al., 2017b, Ma et al., 2011, Suciu et al., 2015, Tuli et al., 2014, Yu and
    Zhang, 2013, Zhou et al., 2013). Agricultural-cloud IoT solutions for greenhouse
    monitoring and control are more and more common. End-nodes collect various data
    which are uploaded to a cloud infrastructure where these data are analysed deeply,
    in a faster way, at a lower cost, reliably and efficiently (Jiawen et al., 2013,
    Keerthi and Kodandaramaiah, 2015, Wang et al., 2013a). Since plant factories are
    becoming more popular in the wider frame of urban CEA in smart cities, there have
    been a number of studies focussing on artificial growth systems (Kozai and Fujiwara,
    2016, Lee and Yoe, 2015). Katsoulas, Bartzanas, et al. (2017) presented a system
    for online precise irrigation scheduling for greenhouses (OpIRIS) based on well-evaluated
    scientific knowledge organised in the form of a web application communicating
    with remote sensors installed in greenhouses. The system integrated industrial-grade
    climate sensors and machinery including fertigation valves/controllers and sensors
    for automatic drainage sampling and forwarding the data to the cloud infrastructure
    for further analysis. The system proved very accurate in predicting the crop water
    needs and provided growers with very efficient indications about when to irrigate
    and how much nutrient solution to apply. Similar attempts to automate irrigation
    have been based on an agricultural information cloud and a hardware combination
    of IOT and RFID (Tongke, 2013), the system achieving dynamic distribution of resource
    and load balancing. As a result, authors report high efficiency of resource use
    and significant improvement in water quality. There have also been studies that
    implement control of one or more of the actuator systems in greenhouses, such
    as climate, or, irrigation controllers, also known as WSANs (Moga et al., 2012,
    Sabri et al., 2011). The control can be done remotely in two ways. The first is
    manual control by the farmer. In these cases, system administrator, based on the
    suggestions made by a Decision Support System/Expert System, chooses to control
    the machinery. Applications in this monitoring and control category include Integrated
    Pest Management (IPM) (Chougule, Kumar, & Mukhopadhyay, 2016), remote monitoring,
    warning and control in open field (Chu et al., 2013, Dinh Le and Tan, 2015), and
    in controlled environment agriculture (Ferentinos et al., 2015, Pahuja et al.,
    2013, Qiu et al., 2013). There also plenty of studies attempting fully-automated
    control by communicating the control signals, produced after processing the sensed
    data, directly to the actuators succeeding a closed-loop control (Kassim et al.,
    2014, Nikolidakis et al., 2015, Rajaoarisoa et al., 2012, Yin et al., 2014, Yongheng
    and Feng, 2014). 4.3. Open-field agriculture In open-field deployments researchers
    usually measure climate conditions, but also focus a lot in soil monitoring. In
    many cases authors use more than one sensors in the ground, at different depths.
    Optimising irrigation by providing exactly as much water as the plant needs is
    the only way to preserve water, since all the extra amount or irrigation is either
    lost into the ground, or in the atmosphere through evaporation (Fig. 5) (Sivakumar,
    GunaSekaran, SelvaPrabhu, Kumaran, & Anandan, 2012). Optical sensors have been
    used for additional information on crop reflectance or remote temperature sensing,
    as well as, mapping of the situation in the field (Fisher and Kebede, 2010, Inoue
    et al., 2012, Moshou et al., 2011, O''Shaughnessy and Evett, 2010). Integration
    of IoT and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) has been proposed in cases where
    precision of mapping of the sensed data is important (Li et al., 2012, Wang et
    al., 2013b, Ye et al., 2013). Another aspect of WSNs in agriculture are the Underground
    Wireless Sensor networks, which present significant advantages, especially in
    open field applications (De Lima et al., 2010, Dong et al., 2013, Silva and Vuran,
    2010). Download : Download high-res image (188KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 5. A modern example of Cloud IoT solutions for climate monitoring and
    climate optimisation based on cloud analytics services. Data fusion is realised
    on the cloud. These data come from various sources, like sensors inside and outside
    the facilities, weather stations, historical data from data bases. User can interact
    remotely with the system through a wide variety of devices (laptops, tablets,
    smartphones, etc.). As mentioned earlier, the advances in embedded device technology
    have made very powerful platforms available at very convenient prices. This has
    given the chance to researchers to implement more sophisticated end-devices, such
    as Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks, incorporating sensing nodes with much
    bigger computational capabilities, enough to support highly demanding peripheral
    devices, such as image sensors. This kind of node allows heavier local processing
    at the edge of the network, in fog-network-like manner. These works either use
    cameras for simple security or facility monitoring purposes (Cai et al., 2011,
    Zhang et al., 2011), or implement various image processing algorithms in order
    to track invading animals (Baranwal & Pushpendra, 2016), insects or other plant
    threats (Dang et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2014) and crop growth (Rodriguez de la
    Concepcion, Stefanelli, & Trinchero, 2014). 4.4. Livestock applications Several
    deployments have been realised in the fields of livestock. Optimal environment
    which absorbs extreme climate conditions known to have negative effects on animals
    productivity is a serious matter for many authors (Corkery et al., 2013, Ilapakurti
    and Vuppalapati, 2015, Wang and Lee, 2012, Zhang et al., 2016). Livestock IoT
    includes not only animal and animal climate monitoring and control, but, in some
    cases includes field monitoring for optimal feeding practices (Fig. 6) (Bhargava,
    Ivanov, & Donnelly, 2015). Another aspect of livestock IoT includes the instrumentation
    and analysis of beehives (Edwards Murphy et al., 2015). Wireless sensors have
    been used in animal tracking and behavioural analysis (Asikainen et al., 2013,
    Huircán et al., 2010, Jeong and Yoe, 2012, Kwong et al., 2012, Nadimi et al.,
    2012) as well as odour and hazardous gas monitoring (Mamduh et al., 2012). There
    are also studies that focus on optimising the performance of the equipment used
    in livestock deployment, based on the imposed challenges of the situation at hand
    (Jeong & Yoe, 2012). Download : Download high-res image (151KB) Download : Download

    overview. 4.5. Food supply chain tracking Modern agriculture tends to be more
    and more industrialised. Therefore, standardisation mechanisms at each step for
    the product, from the grower to the consumer, have to be adopted in order to assure
    food safety and quality (Fig. 8). This need has led to a growing interest in food
    supply chain traceability systems. Internet of Things (IoT) technologies include
    plenty of solutions to contribute greatly to the construction, support and maintenance
    of such systems. In the reviewed literature, solutions focus either on the business
    side of Food Supply Chain (FSC) or technology. There are some works, though, which
    attempt to propose solutions for both sides. Recent developments in e-commerce
    have given a boost to various Supply Chain research activity. In this review,
    however, a focus only on FSC was attempted, since they are optimised for food
    supplies. Download : Download high-res image (206KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 8. Schematic representation of the food supply chain from the production
    phase until the final consumer. RFID is the most common IoT technology found in
    Food Supply Chain (FSC). RFID tags, acting as enhanced barcodes, enable the tracking
    of agricultural products. Recent research, following the IoT paradigm, has combined
    more than one sensor to enrich the information of product status whenever this
    is recorded through its RFID (Maksimovic et al., 2015, Zhao et al., 2013). A common
    issue in IoT is its distributed nature and the asynchronous and heterogeneous
    flow of information. Therefore, naming is vital for the accurate and fast retrieval
    of information when it comes to FSC tracking services (Liu et al., 2015). The
    realisation of IoT-based infrastructure leads to the virtualisation of the supply
    chains, since physical proximity is no longer required (Verdouw et al., 2013).
    Various models analysing the FSC issues and the way IoT technologies tackle them
    appear in literature (Lianguang, 2014, Zhang, 2014). Technological evolution,
    combined with the increasing robustness and maturity of several technologies met
    in IoT, have given researchers the chance to develop complete systems, which incorporate
    sensing modules and software infrastructures. The software part of these systems
    is either hosted on cloud providers or shared among distributed shareholders.
    Complete systems offer automated services, intelligent schemes and automatic reasoning
    based on the measured phenomena and artificial intelligence (Chen, 2015, Jiang
    and Zhang, 2013, Xu et al., 2011). Other works present approaches on how to organise
    a complete FSC information management system (Li, Chen, & Zhu, 2013) or how to
    design the system in such a way that it maximises the economic profit (Pang, Chen,
    Han, & Zheng, 2015). 4.6. Internet of Things middleware and interoperability Interoperability
    at all levels is a key concept in the developing IoT world. Middleware is an approach
    that aims to facilitate interoperability (Fig. 9). The concept of interoperability
    in IoT can be expressed in many ways. Modern agriculture has evolved into a highly-intensive
    industry, expanding from the level of single grower up to international organisations.
    Therefore, agricultural-oriented IoT research offers literature in all aspects
    of interoperability, namely technical, syntactical, semantic and organisational
    interoperability . Download : Download high-res image (99KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 9. The dimensions of interoperability (Serrano et al., 2015).
    Technical interoperability is associated with hardware and software components,
    aiming to provide seamless exchange of information between systems (M2M). Syntactical
    interoperability has to do with data formats, i.e. the syntax that messages should
    have, in order to be exchanged between the systems, in the form of bit-tables
    or high level languages (HTML, XML, etc.). Semantic interoperability has a special
    value for end users, since it has to do with the human interpretation and understanding
    of the content produced by IoT systems. Finally, organisational interoperability
    is of high importance when it comes to IoT scalability. The ability to communicate
    effectively and transfer meaningful data, over highly varying systems and/or geographic
    regions is the key to success of distributed, global-IoT infrastructures (Serrano
    et al., 2015). Hu, Wang, She, and Wang (2011a) present a middleware to promote
    data (Technical) interoperability among various grain storage systems. Technical
    interoperability is the absolute basic type of interoperability a system must
    satisfy. At a higher level of intercommunication among systems, syntactical interoperability
    has to be implemented, in more generic, understandable and human-friendly messages.
    The incorporation of new, high-end, technologies, such as IoT, within a traditional
    productive sector, such as agriculture, and the trend of precision agriculture
    has given Semantic interoperability middleware an extra value. This is because
    Semantic interoperability middleware makes technology more intuitive and easier
    to understand, for both growers and agronomists (Jayaraman et al., 2015b, Sawant
    et al., 2014). Knowledge retrieval is a second feature of Semantic middleware.
    Data flows are organised and synthesised, allowing for better reasoning and management
    in agricultural (Perera et al., 2013, Yuan et al., 2013) and livestock (Saraswathi
    Sivamani, Park, Shin, Cho, & Cho, 2015) deployments. Moving one step further towards
    the realisation of large-scale national, or international cooperative deployments,
    organisational interoperability has been studied (Hu et al., 2011b, Sivamani et
    al., 2013). Providing the base for seamless cooperation between organisations
    presents numerous advantages, ranging from the technical level, for instance,
    quality improvement in sensing, reasoning and control systems by automatic exchange
    of knowledge between self-learning and self-improving systems, up to economic
    and business level by adapting the production rate according to market trends.
    4.7. Multi-layer deployments and commercial solutions IoT allows for the interoperability
    of the systems and organisations. Therefore, it makes it easier to interconnect
    systems involved in the various phases of a product''s lifecycle and several studies
    have presented systems which integrate numerous platforms that monitor, control
    and track agricultural products. Fu (2012) presents in short an intelligent agricultural
    system which could potentially be used in optimal melon and fruit production and
    management, as well as internet trading and supply chain tracking of organic goods.
    IoT concepts and technologies have been widely applied in many aspects of the
    transportation and storage of goods from the producer to the wholesale reseller
    to the consumer, from post-harvest treatment optimisation, storage facilities
    monitoring and management, and controlled environment shipping containers (Dittmer
    et al., 2012, Moon et al., 2015) to swarms of delivery drones (Yu, Subramanian,
    Ning, & Edwards, 2015), autonomous trucks and ships. IoT applications are there
    to drive future changes (Hribernik, Warden, Thoben, & Otthein, 2010). Several
    vendors have moved towards providing solutions either in the form of service or
    solutions that also include the hardware to do the monitoring. In all these cases
    cloud-based applications do the analysis of the data providing suggestions, warnings
    or control signals. These solutions do not only focus on large-scale production,
    but also on individual gardening and home production. Bitponics is cloud-based
    solution offering automated advisory services for garden care (Bitponics, 2016).
    Plantlink offers a solution for connecting garden to home users integrating sensors
    and irrigation controller in one network (Plantlink, 2016). Growtronix is a modular
    system that can monitor almost every aspect of indoor gardens and plant factories
    (Growtronix, 2016). Some promising smart greenhouse monitoring and control solutions
    are offered by Sensaphone, Monnit and GetSenso (GetSenso, 2016, Monnit, 2016,
    Sensaphone, 2016). These solutions aim to optimise climate in greenhouses minimising
    the risk of yield losses through a more optimal climate for the crops. In addition,
    Fieldclimate appears to be a rich platform providing both hardware (weather stations,
    sensor nodes) and cloud-based software solutions (weather forecast, irrigation
    management, disease models etc.) (FieldClimate, 2016). CropX is a complete system
    including field ground sensors measuring soil moisture and temperature, uploading
    the data to the cloud and offer a mapping and optimal irrigation planning as a
    service to the grower through a mobile application (CropX, 2016). Microsoft has
    recently launched its end-to-end IoT platform for agriculture. FarmBeats consists
    of UAV drones and sensors, connectivity support, and cloud infrastructure which
    includes machine learning-based backend analytics with predictive features, and
    cloud storage (Microsoft, 2015). 5. Discussion 5.1. Internet of Things hardware
    & software challenges in agriculture When it comes to IoT in agriculture, several
    challenges arise. Firstly, the equipment residing at the perception layer has
    to be exposed directly to harsh environmental phenomena, like high solar radiation,
    extreme temperatures, rain or high humidity, strong winds, vibrations and other
    dangers capable of destroying the electronic circuits. The end-devices will have
    to stay active and function reliably for long periods relying on the limited power
    resources of batteries. Therefore, appropriate programming tools and low-power
    capabilities are mandatory, since the frequent battery replacement or reset of
    the stations (in case of a program failure), for example in a large-scale open
    field deployment, is not easy. Power harvesting can be a solution to some extent,
    however, the power consumption has still to be within the power budget of small
    power harvesting modules (e.g. solar panels, wind turbines etc.). Furthermore,
    the large number of interconnected (in an internet-like manner) devices produces
    an incredibly large amount of data, which will soon be beyond the resource capacities
    of small-scale server infrastructures to handle (Atzori et al., 2010, Ziegeldorf
    et al., 2014). 5.2. Organisational challenges & interoperability When it comes
    to logistics for the food and agricultural sector, this infrastructure aims to
    facilitate the exchange of information and the transportation of goods, optimising
    the production process and the supply chain networks globally. IoT is gradually
    transforming business processes by providing more accurate and real-time visibility
    to the flow of materials and products (Lee & Lee, 2015). Cloud Computing provides
    high quality services, hardware-agnostic application development tools and sufficient
    storage and computational resources to store and process the data produced at
    the edge of the network. Therefore, it seems like an ideal complement for the
    IoT technologies towards the composition of “CloudIoT” paradigm (Botta et al.,
    2014). The huge amount of data produced at the edge of the network, however, can
    incur a severely high cost to be transferred to the cloud, both in terms of money
    and latency. Therefore, the optimal balancing between the edge storage and processing
    and the part of the workload that is to be done on the cloud is a serious matter.
    Fog Computing is an extension of the Cloud Computing paradigm, expanding cloud
    technologies and tools, as well as, the horizons of application development (Bonomi,
    Milito, Natarajan, & Zhu, 2014). 5.3. Networking challenges The characteristics
    of the environment do not only impose challenges to the hardware, but also to
    the network layer. Wireless communication is the most common in agricultural deployments,
    due to the lack of wiring costs. Environment is known to be one of the major factors
    which lead to low wireless link quality, through the multi-path propagation effects
    and its contribution to background noise (Wang et al., 2017). Real-world deployments
    have shown that the performance of popular transceivers is affected by temperature
    (Bannister et al., 2008, Boano et al., 2010), humidity (Thelen, 2004), human presence
    and other obstacles within the space in which a wireless node attempts to communicate.
    Therefore, data have to be transferred using robust and reliable technologies,
    according to the requirements and challenges of the rural environment. 5.4. Security
    challenges The transfer to an interconnected internet of “smart things” must ensure
    the security, authenticity, confidentiality and privacy of the stakeholders involved
    in this network. In other words, IoT must be secure against external attacks,
    in the perception layer, secure the aggregation of data in the network layer and
    offer specific guarantees that only authorised entities can access and modify
    data in the application layer. Security in IoT is summarised in three requirements:
    authentication, confidentiality and access control (Sicari, Rizzardi, Grieco,
    & Coen-Porisini, 2015). In the perception layer the most common security issues
    include information acquisition security and physical security of the hardware.
    The latter one is quite important in the case of agriculture, since the devices
    can be deployed in open fields and function without surveillance for long periods.
    Due to the distributed nature of IoT and the fact that its devices may be deployed
    in diverse environments, a single security protocol is, usually, not enough (Li,
    2012). RFID security issues are usually related to leakage of information, which
    can unveil the location and other sensitive data. Security countermeasures include
    data encryption, use of blocker tags, tag frequency modification, jamming and,
    finally, tag destruction policy, in other words the physical ending of a tag''s
    life (Matharu, Upadhyay, & Chaudhary, 2014). Sensor nodes differ from RFID tags,
    in the way that sensors are active and relate to dynamic properties of things.
    Therefore, encryption algorithms, key distribution policies, intrusion detection
    mechanisms and security routing policies have to be deployed, always keeping in
    mind the hardware restrictions of smart devices. In the current IoT concept, data
    flow from the end devices to a gateway, which is in charge of uploading these
    data to other infrastructures, such as the cloud. Various security policies for
    sensor terminals exist, including cryptographic algorithms, identity authentication
    mechanisms, data flow control policies, data filtering mechanisms etc. (Li, 2012).
    Moreover, the perception layer requires information acquisition security measures
    too. Wiretapping, tampering, cheating, and replay attacks are just a few of the
    security threats. Therefore, authenticity, confidentiality and data integrity
    have to be ensured during the phase of data acquisition, and key management protocols
    and secure routing policies should be adopted and sensor node authentication policies
    must be leveraged to prevent data access by unauthorised entities (Gou, Yan, Liu,
    & Li, 2013). 5.5. Stack challenges Middleware is another part of IoT presenting
    specific requirements for increased security, since it stands between the network
    and application layers and is responsible both for data processing and communication
    interface between these two layers. Security in the middleware layer requires
    confidentiality and secure data storage. Wireless medium is challenging, when
    it comes to security in transmissions, even for more sophisticated hardware than
    the platforms met in IoT deployments. Therefore, the IoT architecture can easily
    be exposed to risks, such as denial of service attacks, unauthorised access, man-in-the-middle
    attacks, and virus injections which target and affect confidentiality and data
    integrity. Authentication, intrusion detection, key management and negotiation
    mechanisms could possibly provide solutions against the network layer threats.
    Application layer is the top layer in the IoT vision. It is the place where enormous
    flows of data streams end, requiring increased storage and computational resources.
    This is why the application layer is so closely-related with the cloud. The security
    issues here are not very different from the security issues of the cloud itself,
    including data security, privacy, backup and recovery. Control mechanisms need
    to administer the privileges and ownership of data and manage the access rights
    to all, or part of the information, both for physical users and between machines,
    or even organisations. 5.6. Potential value of IoT in agriculture Internet of
    Things is rapidly evolving and many novel applications and services are emerging
    from it. A great amount of research is being conducting towards the integration
    of various heterogeneous systems, the security assurance at various levels of
    IoT and the analytics, which will give a better insight into the “Big Data” in
    order to optimise various business processes. National policy of governments around
    the world for increased production rate of fresh-cut vegetables and meat, at lower
    price, with higher quality standards, as well as, the consumers'' demand for transparency
    in the production cycle and the environmental footprint of the products they buy,
    provide IoT a huge field for development and diffusion. According to Bradley,
    Barbier, and Handler (2013), the estimates from 2013 to 2022 of potential IoT
    value vary significantly, ranging from a minimum of $1 trillion up to more than
    $15 trillion, not including the increased revenues, the benefits of cost reduction
    among companies and industries and the general economic activity due to IoT. Much
    of the added-value of IoT comes from the flexibility and the optimisation and
    precision that it introduces into the production processes of industry and production
    units of all types. Therefore, it is not so risky to forecast that agricultural
    sector processes at all levels will drastically change in the very near future.
    Obviously the economic numbers related to IoT are very big, tempting some very
    serious players to invest in it. Examples, like the recent purchase of Nest Labs,
    a company specialising in IoT for home automation, by Google for $3.2 billion
    in cash and the purchase of Jasper Technologies, developer of and IoT cloud platform,
    by Cisco for $1.4 billion, reveal the great potential of IoT and prove that it
    is highly attractive to big investors and behemoth technological firms. The partnership
    formation, however, is not so trivial. This is due to the fact that the companies
    involved in IoT invest in one or a few aspects of it, because of its wide nature.
    Therefore, sooner or later, they will have to cooperate with each other, putting
    aside any competition, or the notion of who is more important, in order to introduce
    some universal standards in the evolving IoT hype. 6. Conclusion When it comes
    to agriculture, IoT is expected to optimise the production by many means. Farmlands
    and greenhouses are about to move from precision to a micro-precision model of
    agricultural production. Distributed, pervasive computing and precise monitoring
    of the facilities will provide the optimal growing or living conditions for both
    vegetables and animals. Autonomous systems will be able not only to command the
    actuators in the most efficient way, optimising the utility and resource usage,
    but also to control the production in accordance to the market situation, maximising
    the profit and minimising the costs in every possible way. On the other hand,
    food supply chains, equipped with WSN and RFID equipment, will be able to monitor
    each stage in the life of a product, make automatic reasoning, in case of a faulty
    product and increase consumer''s feeling of safety, through a transparent product
    lifecycle information system. All the above is the optimistic approach of the
    IoT integration in agriculture. However, in this concept, plenty of individual
    players are about to participate. First of all, local networks have to be secured
    against interference from other networks, especially as these technologies reach
    their full potential. In a real IoT scenario, most of the players will use different
    equipment, with different technical specifications and/or sensor characteristics.
    Obviously, the interoperability, the filtering and the semantic annotation of
    the data, coming from each producer, has to be made to some extent. This is the
    only way in which the data, coming from vastly heterogeneous sources, can be used
    to optimise a shared decision support or expert system. Security, anonymity and
    control over the access rights on the information is vital for such a system to
    be adopted. In a wider perspective, many of the data related to business/institution
    strategic planning cannot be disclosed or retrieved by non-authorised entities,
    so that the market is safe against unorthodox tactics. References Ahonen et al.,

    \ to provide farmers with a\nlarge amount of information. Precision agriculture\
    \ (PA) is a management strategy that employs\ninformation technology to improve\
    \ quality and production. Utilizing wireless sensor technologies\nand management\
    \ tools can lead to a highly effective, green agriculture. Based on PA management,\n\
    the same routine to a crop regardless of site environments can be avoided. From\
    \ several perspectives,\nﬁeld management can improve PA, including the provision\
    \ of adequate nutrients for crops and the\nwastage of pesticides for the effective\
    \ control of weeds, pests, and diseases. This review outlines the\nrecent applications\
    \ of WSNs in agriculture research as well as classiﬁes and compares various wireless\n\
    communication protocols, the taxonomy of energy-efﬁcient and energy harvesting\
    \ techniques for\nWSNs that can be used in agricultural monitoring systems, and\
    \ comparison between early research\nworks on agriculture-based WSNs. The challenges\
    \ and limitations of WSNs in the agricultural domain\nare explored, and several\
    \ power reduction and agricultural management techniques for long-term\nmonitoring\
    \ are highlighted. These approaches may also increase the number of opportunities\
    \ for\nprocessing Internet of Things (IoT) data.\nKeywords: energy-efﬁcient; energy\

    1. Introduction\nWireless sensor network (WSN) technologies have rapidly developed\
    \ over the years. Ecological\nphenomena in a vast area can be monitored using\
    \ pervasive devices called motes or sensor nodes.\nBattery-powered WSNs comprise\
    \ several sensors, processors, and radio frequency (RF) modules.\nThe sensor nodes\
    \ or motes can communicate wirelessly through a communication link and forward\n\
    their data to a base station or coordinator node by communicating with a gateway.\
    \ The communication\namong sensor nodes depends on the merging of diverse sensors\
    \ from simple (i.e., humidity, pressure,\nand temperature) to complex (i.e., localization,\
    \ tracking, micro-radars, and images), thereby allowing\nWSNs to monitor a wide\
    \ range of surroundings to obtain precise information from the ﬁeld [1].\nAccordingly,\
    \ the sensing, storage, processing, and communication capabilities of sensor nodes\
    \ have\ncontinuously increased [2].\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781; doi:10.3390/s17081781\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n2 of 45\nWSNs have been\
    \ used in different applications, such as military, agriculture, sports, medicine,\
    \ and\nindustry. Agriculture can be considered as one of the most favorable facilities\
    \ for WSNs to improve\nfood crop yields and minimize the burden of farmers [3].\
    \ Several projects have been introduced in\nthe precision agriculture (PA) literature.\
    \ PA aims to prevent the application of the same management\nroutine to a crop\
    \ regardless of site circumstances and to improve ﬁeld management from several\n\
    perspectives. For instance, PA can minimize the wastage of pesticides for the\
    \ effective control of weeds,\npests, and diseases as well as guarantee that crops\
    \ receive an adequate amount of nutrients, thereby\nleading to a highly effective,\
    \ green agriculture. Speciﬁcally, PA is a management strategy that employs\ninformation\
    \ technology to improve agricultural quality and production. PA differs for traditional\n\
    farming in the sense that this process accurately identiﬁes variations and relates\
    \ the spatial data to\nmanagement activities. PA involves ﬁve stages, namely,\
    \ (i) data collection, (ii) diagnosis, (iii) data\nanalysis, (iv) precision ﬁeld\
    \ operation, and (v) evaluation [4].\nWSNs are used as cost-effective processes\
    \ to increase agricultural yield. Accordingly, WSNs have\nbeen used in different\
    \ agricultural applications, such as for monitoring climate and using soil nutrient\n\
    data to forecast the health of crops and the quality of agricultural products.\
    \ Irrigation planning can\nbe predicted using WSNs by observing weather conditions\
    \ (such as temperature and humidity) and\nsoil moisture. Other sensor nodes can\
    \ be added to the existing WSN to improve the parameters of the\nagricultural\
    \ monitoring system and to make the network scalable. However, some challenges\
    \ have\nhindered the agricultural application of WSNs, such as determining optimum\
    \ deployment schemes,\nmeasurement periods, routing protocols, energy efﬁciency,\
    \ cost, communication range, scalability, and\nfault tolerance [5]. For example,\
    \ the scattered deployment of sensor nodes with a long data-gathering\nperiod\
    \ can help extend the network lifetime. However, some factors may challenge the\
    \ selection of the\ndistribution region. When the agricultural ﬁeld faces many\
    \ obstacles, the communication link may\nbe weakened or lost as a result of signal\
    \ attenuation. The sensor nodes in WSNs are supplied from\nthe battery, thereby\
    \ preventing connections to the main supply in the deployment location. Reducing\n\
    power depletion and prolonging battery life are imperative for WSNs considering\
    \ their limited battery\npower. Although the application of WSNs has increased\
    \ constantly over the years, the manufacturing\nof batteries has not developed\
    \ at the same rate [6]. Therefore, WSNs are mainly limited by their\nbatteries\
    \ [7]. Among the aforementioned challenges, this paper focuses on energy management\
    \ and\nhighlights energy-efﬁcient and energy harvesting techniques that can be\
    \ used in agriculture.\nTo fulﬁll PA requirements, such as addressing the problems\
    \ resulting from the long distance\nbetween farms and base stations, a mobile\
    \ data connection service can be established by connecting\nunmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ or drones with the base station [4]. Such connection allows the sensor nodes\n\
    to relay their data to the base station within the wide area of the farm ﬁeld.\
    \ However, this solution is\nlimited by the quality of service of WSNs.\nThe main\
    \ contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n(i)\nThe potential of\
    \ using wireless communications protocols or technologies in agriculture was\n\
    investigated, and the technology with the best power consumption and communication\
    \ distance\nwas identiﬁed.\n(ii)\nThe taxonomy of energy-efﬁcient and energy harvesting\
    \ techniques was examined to address the\npower consumption problems in agriculture\
    \ and to identify those methods that are most suitable\nfor solving these problems.\n\
    (iii)\nThe existing solutions, applicability, and limitations of applying WSNs\
    \ in agriculture were\nreviewed and compared.\n(iv)\nRecent studies using WSN\
    \ in PA applications based on Internet of Things (IoT) were surveyed\nand compared\
    \ in terms of type of sensors and actuators, IoT end devices, IoT platforms, and\
    \ IoT\napplication layer.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n3 of 45\n2. Wireless Communication\
    \ Technologies for Agriculture\nThis section presents the different wireless protocols\
    \ and standards that are used in agriculture.\nThese wireless technologies are\
    \ also compared to identify the most convenient technology in terms of\npower\
    \ consumption and communication range, where the two metrics are posed challenges\
    \ in current\nsolution of agriculture application [5,8]. IoT is a revolution for\
    \ the future realm where everything\nthat can utilize a connection will be connected.\
    \ Cellular technologies are grown and developed to\nplay a crucial role in the\
    \ IoT realm [9]. Narrowband-IoT (NB-IoT) is a new IoT system constructed\nfrom\
    \ current Long Term Evolution (LTE) functionalities. Subsequently, NB-IoT is possible\
    \ to share the\nspectrum of LTE without coexistence problems and to utilize the\
    \ same pieces of equipment, as well\nas it is possible to connect seamlessly into\
    \ the LTE main network. This permits all network facilities\nsuch as security,\
    \ tracking, policy, charging, and authentication to be totally supported [10].\
    \ The design\ngoals of NB-IoT cover high coverage area, extended battery life\
    \ (i.e., 10 years), high network size\n(52,000 devices/channel/cell), and low-cost\
    \ devices [10,11]. However, in the near future, NB-IoT\ntechnologies, such as\
    \ Long Range radio (LoRa) will take place in agricultural applications due to\
    \ low\npower consumption and preferably used when the agricultural information\
    \ are to be transmitted over\nlong distances.\n2.1. ZigBee Wireless Protocol\n\
    ZigBee wireless protocol is considered one of the best candidate technologies\
    \ for the agriculture\nand farming domains. Given its low duty cycle, ZigBee is\
    \ considered appropriate for PA applications,\nsuch as irrigation supervision\
    \ [12], water quality management, and fertilizer and pesticide control,\nall of\
    \ which require a cyclic information update. Based on this technology, the sensor\
    \ nodes in the\nagricultural ﬁeld can communicate with the router or coordinator\
    \ node over a long range (i.e., 100 m)\nwhen XBee Series 2 is used. ZigBee can\
    \ also reduce the communication distance by up to 30 m for\nindoor conditions\
    \ (i.e., greenhouses) [13]. The number of deployed sensor and router nodes will\
    \ be\nincreased to cover the entire ﬁeld area under surveillance. Some studies\
    \ have employed Zigbee for PA.\nFor instance, ZigBee was used to investigate the\
    \ effect of signal strength on node spacing, base station\nantenna height, and\
    \ leaf density [14]. In [14], three experiments were conducted in palm orchards\
    \ in\nto evaluate a signal propagation model based on the received signal strength\
    \ indicator (RSSI) of the\nZigBee wireless protocol. Through their experiments,\
    \ the authors concluded that the wireless channel\npropagation model must be determined\
    \ before deploying the sensor nodes in palm orchards to obtain\nrobust signal\
    \ strength characteristics. A path loss model in a mango greenhouse was investigated\n\
    based on the ZigBee wireless protocol [15].\nA cattle-localization-system-based\
    \ ZigBee WSN was also applied in a grazing ﬁeld [16]. Instead of\nrequiring additional\
    \ hardware, ZigBee relies on link quality indication (LQI) to measure distance.\
    \ The\nZigBee protocol achieves cattle localization at a low power consumption\
    \ and minimum cost. The key\nparameters of greenhouse climate (i.e., humidity,\
    \ temperature, CO2, and solar radiation) are considered\nin [17] to ensure the\
    \ comfortable growth of plants with 22% energy savings and 33% water usage.\n\
    ZigBee and Global System for Mobile communication/General Packet Radio Service\
    \ (GSM/GPRS)\ntechnologies were used to monitor and control the climate condition\
    \ of greenhouses [17]. The ZigBee\nwireless protocol has also been used to monitor\
    \ animal behavior (e.g., walking, grazing, lying down,\nand standing) [18]. ZigBee\
    \ was also adopted in [18] to overcome the high power consumption and\nunreliability\
    \ issues in mobile ad hoc WSNs.\nA WSN-based greenhouse that uses ZigBee star\
    \ topology is merged with artiﬁcial intelligence\n(i.e., fuzzy logic controller)\
    \ in [19]. The ZigBee wireless protocol is adopted to preserve energy by\nswitching\
    \ between active and sleep states. Thus, power consumption can be minimized, and\
    \ the\nbattery lifetime of sensor nodes can be extended. ZigBee is currently applied\
    \ in smart beehives [20],\norange orchards [21], dairy healthcare monitoring of\
    \ cows in pastures and barns [22], automation in\nirrigation [23], greenhouse\
    \ monitoring systems [24,25], and livestock monitoring [26]. As a universal\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 1781\n4 of 45\nstandard for WSNs, the ZigBee protocol was used\
    \ in several agricultural applications because of its\nlow power consumption,\
    \ low cost, self-forming characteristics, and suitable communication range.\n\
    2.2. Bluetooth (BT) Wireless Protocol\nThe BT standard has been utilized to establish\
    \ a communication link between movable and\nportable devices, such as laptops,\
    \ over a short distance of up to 10 m. Given its pervasive nature\nand availability\
    \ in most mobile devices, BT has been employed to satisfy multi-level agricultural\n\
    requirements [5].\nWeather information, soil moisture, sprinkler position, and\
    \ temperature are\nmonitored remotely using Global Positioning System (GPS) and\
    \ BT technologies. The proposed\nsystem in [27] was developed for irrigation application\
    \ to increase ﬁeld productivity and conserve\nwater. The irrigation application\
    \ proposed in [28] collects ﬁeld information in real time via the BT\nwireless\
    \ communication protocol. Several software and hardware were developed in [29]\
    \ to monitor\nthe relative humidity and temperature in greenhouses based on BT.\
    \ The BT module was employed in\nintegrated control method [30] to control the\
    \ irrigation system in greenhouses based on soil and weather\ninformation, and\
    \ this technology improved the leaf number, height, dry weight, and fresh weight\n\
    of red and romaine lettuce in greenhouses. Result of estimation for water usage\
    \ and electricity also\nimproved by 90% based on integrated control method using\
    \ BT technology relative to the traditional\nmethod (i.e., timer control strategy).\
    \ Given its low energy consumption, wide availability, and ease of\nuse for farmers,\
    \ smartphone-based BT has been employed in different agricultural applications\
    \ [31–35],\nsuch as controlling irrigation systems, monitoring soil and weather\
    \ conditions, and controlling the use\nof fertilizers and pesticides.\n2.3. WiFi\
    \ Wireless Protocol\nWiFi is currently the most extensively utilized wireless\
    \ technology available in portable devices,\nincluding tablets, smartphones, laptops,\
    \ and desktops. WiFi has a suitable communication distance of\nabout 20 m and\
    \ 100 m in indoor and outdoor environments, respectively. In PA applications,\
    \ WiFi\nextends diverse architectures by connecting several types of devices via\
    \ an ad hoc network. WiFi and\n3G wireless technologies were employed in [36]\
    \ to estimate the agricultural applications of mobile\nphones. Remote access and\
    \ short message services have also been used for controlling and monitoring\n\
    protected crops. In [37], agricultural data, such as soil temperature, soil moisture,\
    \ weather temperature\nand humidity, sunlight intensity, and CO2, were stored\
    \ in a gateway before they were transmitted\nto the server computer over a WiFi\
    \ network. A Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11g)-based smart WSN is proposed\nfor agricultural\
    \ monitoring in [38]. The proposed system consists of three nodes: sensor, router,\
    \ and\nserver. The climate conditions of the greenhouse or agricultural ﬁeld,\
    \ such as humidity, temperature,\nair pressure, light, water level, and soil moisture,\
    \ are monitored. The said work attempts to lower cost,\nminimize wiring connections,\
    \ and enhance the mobility and ﬂexibility of the sensing points in WSN.\nHowever,\
    \ the energy consumption of the proposed system is extremely high at 42.17 J/h.\n\
    Given that WiFi requires much power [5], long communication time, and huge data\
    \ payload [26].\nWiFi technology is not preferable for agricultural applications\
    \ in spite of the fact that a Wi-Fi server\nprevents data losses by adopting data\
    \ redundancy techniques. In addition, WiFi cannot be employed\nfor multi-hope\
    \ applications and inﬂuenced by number of users and the signal intensity; thereby,\n\
    it is inappropriate for agriculture WSNs. Moreover, the WiFi nodes listen all\
    \ the time, so power\nconsumption will increase [39].\n2.4. GPRS/3G/4G Technology\n\
    General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) is a packet data service for GSM-based cellular\
    \ phones.\nGPRS frequently experiences variable delays and throughputs, and such\
    \ technology depends on the\nvolume of consumers that share the same communication\
    \ channels and resources. Gutiérrez et al. [40]\nused the GPRS module and WSN\
    \ to develop an automatic crop irrigation system based on the\ninformation collected\
    \ by temperature and soil moisture sensors installed at the root zone of plants,\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 1781\n5 of 45\nand considered this system a cost-effective and\
    \ practical solution for improving water quality in\nPA. A drip irrigation process\
    \ was evaluated in [41] by measuring soil moisture. A prototype system\nwas also\
    \ developed based on a data management server and a WSN-GPRS gateway. WSN-GPRS\n\
    gateway acts as a bridge between WSN and GPRS where the data from the WSN are\
    \ transferred to a\ndata management center. Navarro-Hellín et al. [42] equipped\
    \ various wireless nodes with GPRS to\nmeasure and transmit soil, plant, and atmosphere\
    \ information. The wireless nodes have unlimited\nautonomy because of their independent\
    \ nature and use of solar energy. Different sensors may transmit\ninformation\
    \ to a remote location via a GPRS network for further analysis by using tablets,\
    \ mobile\nphones, or computers. All agriculture sensors are interfaced to the\
    \ sensor board to obtain agricultural\ninformation. Such information is transmitted\
    \ to the remote server for further analysis through the\nGPRS-board, which depends\
    \ on a GSM/GPRS mobile network.\n2.5. Long Range Radio (LoRa) Protocol\nLoRa is\
    \ introduced by the LoRa Alliance as a protocol stack for low power and wide area\
    \ Internet\nof Things (IoT) communication technologies that are associated with\
    \ indoor transmission [43]. The\nbasic network architecture of a LoRaWAN consists\
    \ of LoRa end devices, LoRa gateways, and a LoRa\nnetwork server. The LoRa end\
    \ device communicates with gateways that employ LoRa with LoRaWAN.\nLoRa gateways\
    \ pass raw LoRaWAN packets from the end devices to a LoRa network server with\n\
    a high throughput based on the backhaul interface, which is typically 3G or Ethernet.\
    \ Accordingly,\nLoRa gateways act as a bidirectional communication or protocol\
    \ adapter with the LoRa network\nserver. In this case, the LoRa network server\
    \ takes charge of decoding the data packets transmitted by\nthe LoRa devices and\
    \ creating the frames that would be directed back to the devices. LoRa offers\
    \ a\nbidirectional solution that matches machine-to-machine (M2M) WiFi or cellular\
    \ technologies. LoRa\npresents a cost-effective method for linking batteries or\
    \ mobile devices to the network or to end devices.\nThe LoRa wireless protocol\
    \ was used in [44] to monitor bee colonies in rural areas and to ensure a\ncommunication\
    \ between the bee node and the local server that is located in a remote location.\
    \ The\nsoil moisture and temperature, air temperature and humidity, and light\
    \ intensity inside greenhouses\nwere also monitored using different sensors, microcontrollers,\
    \ and the LoRa wireless protocol [8]. The\nLoRa gateway collects data from LoRa\
    \ nodes to construct the topology of a star network, and may\ncommunicate with\
    \ a cloud server over a long communication range and with high scalability.\n\
    LoRa was recently utilized in several agriculture research projects developed\
    \ by the Libelium\nCompany (Zaragoza, Spain) [45], such as improving kiwi production\
    \ based on a smart irrigation system\n(Italy), monitoring of green areas by using\
    \ a smart garden system (Spain), improving fertilization\nmethods of corn yields\
    \ (Italy), improving production of banana yields (Colombia), increasing\ntobacco\
    \ crops by controlling the climate condition (Italy), saving water through a smart\
    \ irrigation\nsystem (Barcelona), monitoring of vineyard crops (Spain), and monitoring\
    \ of diseases that affect\nvineyards (Switzerland).\n2.6. SigFox Protocol\nSigFox\
    \ is an ultra-narrowband wireless cellular network [43] with low data rate applications,\n\
    thereby making this technology appropriate for IoT and machine-type communications\
    \ systems.\nSigFox has been used in different applications, including telephone,\
    \ security, mobile, broadband, and\ntelevision. The SigFox network was used in\
    \ [46,47] to construct a geolocation system that localizes\nanimals in mountain\
    \ pastures throughout the summer. A system was proposed in [46] to help farmers\n\
    locate their cattle and enhance their production. The importance of power consumption\
    \ analyses was\nhighlighted in [47], especially when the cattle are located in\
    \ high mountainous areas.\n2.7. Performance Comparison of Wireless Communication\
    \ Protocols\nTable 1 compares the aforementioned wireless communication protocols\
    \ or technologies relative\nto different parameters, including power consumption,\
    \ communication range, data rate, cost, system\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n6 of 45\n\
    complexity, and other parameters. The challenges in agricultural applications\
    \ may be developed from\nthe selection of the deployment range. For instance,\
    \ the transmitted signal by the sensor node is\nattenuated when the agriculture\
    \ ﬁeld is separated by obstacles. Power consumption is considered as\nanother\
    \ limitation in the WSN design in agricultural applications [5]. The ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol was\ndesigned to run with a suitable communication range and low power\
    \ consumption. LoRa and SigFox\nare considered to work with low power consumption\
    \ and long radio range. Accordingly, the power\nconsumption and communication\
    \ distance of the above technologies have been assessed as follows.\nZigbee and\
    \ Bluetooth low energy (BLE) are designed for battery-powered devices.\nThese\n\
    technologies conserve power through low duty cycling and enter sleep mode to extend\
    \ the battery\nlifetime. Classic BT, WiFi, GPRS, LoRa, and SigFox have a higher\
    \ power consumption than ZigBee.\nAlthough ZigBee has a shorter communication\

    \ node to overcome the node deployment limitations in agricultural applications.\n\
    BLE outperforms ZigBee in terms of power consumption, but this wireless protocol\
    \ is limited in\nagricultural applications because of its short communication\
    \ distance of 10 m, as reported in [48].\nZigBee also has a higher network elasticity\
    \ than BT, thereby permitting various topologies. Given the\nlarge number of nodes\
    \ (more than 65,000) in the ZigBee network, the ZigBee technology can be used\n\
    to cover a wide agricultural. Accordingly, the ZigBee wireless protocol has been\
    \ adopted in many\nagriculture studies [5,49–53]. One of these studies [5] prefers\
    \ to utilize ZigBee in farming domains and\nagricultural applications owing to\
    \ its energy-efﬁcient, reliable, and low-cost wireless protocol.\nThe LoRa wireless\
    \ protocol covers a large communication area with low power consumption.\nTherefore,\
    \ it can be suitably deployed in vast agricultural ﬁelds. The network size of\
    \ the LoRa protocol\nis limited by its duty cycle, where a 1% duty cycle can lead\
    \ to a maximum communication time of 36 s\nper hour for each end device [54].\
    \ In addition, LoRa gateways have a limited message capacity of less\nthan 100\
    \ messages per minute because of the unplanned deployment of LoRa gateways in\
    \ urban areas,\nthereby interfering with low power wireless area networks, such\
    \ as SigFox. Therefore, increasing the\nnumber of gateways can challenge the infrastructure\
    \ of the LoRa network [54]. Moreover, the LoRa\ntechnology is complex and has\
    \ sizable hardware implementations [55].\nSigFox has an extremely low data rate\
    \ (100 bps) and slow transmission time (10 s for 10 bytes)\ncompared with ZigBee\
    \ and LoRa [56]. SigFox supports star topology supervised by a centralized sever\n\
    that manages connectivity between devices and the base stations, whereas the LoRa\
    \ supports wide\narea network based on star-to-star topology creating a bridge\
    \ of LoRa gateways. Given that data rate\nand transmission time are both critical\
    \ issue in any communication system, SigFox cannot be widely\nused for agricultural\
    \ applications. Moreover, this technology does not support the collision avoidance\n\
    scheme, thereby affecting the network because several M2M devices may be operated\
    \ in the same\narea. Moreover, SigFox has a limited reliability because of its\
    \ one-way communication (without an\nacknowledgment signal) and low received power.\
    \ However, both the LoRa and SigFox infrastructures\nare still in progress. Ali\
    \ et al. further discuss the limitations of these protocols [56].\nFrom the above\
    \ discussion and the comparison results presented in Table 1 and Figure 1\nand\
    \ as will be shown in Tables 2–8 the ZigBee and LoRa wireless protocols have been\
    \ identiﬁed\nas the most suitable wireless protocols for agricultural applications\
    \ because of their low power\nconsumption, communication range (acceptable for\
    \ ZigBee and long for LoRa), small size, easy\nnetwork implementation, simplicity,\
    \ low latency (for ZigBee), scalability, and network size.\nSensors 2017, 17,\

    \ site-speciﬁc management for automated agriculture.\nIn terms of precision, the\
    \ considered wireless protocols for agricultural applications have improved\n\
    the agriculture domain. Precision irrigation is frequently regarded as optimizing\
    \ irrigation accuracy\ndue to its ability to control the optimum amount of water\
    \ and irrigation time. The water savings\nof 90% (based on ZigBee), 33% (based\
    \ on ZigBee), 50% (based on Bluetooth), and 90% (based on\nBluetooth) were achieved\
    \ for precision irrigation systems relative to traditional irrigation systems\
    \ in\nresearch [17,28,30,40], respectively. Animal behavior, such as laying down,\
    \ standing, grazing, walking,\nand other modes, was monitored in [18] using ZigBee\
    \ wireless protocol. The authors found that\nlaying down and grazing could be\
    \ improved by 83.5% compared with the ﬁndings from similar\nstudies. In another\
    \ study that has adopted a proposed algorithm that depended on the ZigBee wireless\n\
    protocol [20], an accuracy rate of 95.4% was expected for the proposed algorithm\
    \ to monitor the\nhoney bee and the agricultural and environmental aspects. In\
    \ [23], the automation of the irrigation\nsystem based on ZigBee saved the system\
    \ cost between 1.24% and 6.72% relative to the entire cost\nof the water user\
    \ associations, with energy savings of 2.05 to 8.21% and water savings of 0.71\
    \ to\n6.46%. The proposed model in [35] utilized a smartphone platform (based\
    \ on Bluetooth and GSM\ntechnologies) and permitted three types of irrigation\
    \ systems. The efﬁciency factors were improved\nby 90% for subsurface drip type\
    \ and 85% and 75% for high- and low-pressure overhead sprinkler\ntypes, respectively,\
    \ to compute for drift and evaporation before the water droplets approached the\n\
    soil. 3G technology was adopted by Libelium based on Waspmote wireless sensor\
    \ devices to monitor\nthe vineyards in Northwest Spain [57]. Phytosanitary treatments,\
    \ such as fungicides and fertilizers,\nwere minimized by 20% and growing yields\
    \ were enhanced by 15% based on PA. In [8], LoRa wireless\nprotocol was considered\
    \ to monitor the agriculture environments with 90% power efﬁciency. The cost\n\
    of pumping and water for precision irrigation system in green areas was reduced\
    \ by 30% based on\nSigFox wireless protocol [58].\nThe preceding survey for different\
    \ agricultural applications revealed that PA can be achieved\nin terms of water\
    \ savings, animal behavior, accuracy, power efﬁciency, and reducing system cost\n\
    for various wireless protocols. Consequently, agriculture can be improved based\
    \ on agricultural\nautomation systems compared with traditional agriculture systems.\n\

    \ may operate at different energy states. Therefore, the lifespan of a sensor\
    \ node is the\ntime consumed to exhaust its batteries under a sustainable operation\
    \ threshold.\nNumerous scholars have developed power reduction techniques to provide\
    \ sensor nodes an\ninﬁnite lifespan. This section reviews several power reduction\
    \ techniques of WSNs that can be used in\nagricultural applications. The purposes,\
    \ wireless protocols, ﬁndings, advantages, and limitations of\neach technique\
    \ are also discussed.\n3.1.1. Sleep/Wake Strategy\nWireless transceivers consume\
    \ a signiﬁcant amount of power relative to processors. The energy\nof the wireless\
    \ nodes is mostly dissipated during the reception and transmission processes.\
    \ The radio\nof sensor nodes can enter sleep mode via the sleep/wake strategy\
    \ to reduce the power consumption\nof the RF components of WSNs. No data communication\
    \ occurs during the sleep mode. The sensor\nnodes wake up to collect and transmit\
    \ data within a certain period and then return to sleep mode\nto conserve energy.\
    \ In agricultural applications, the sleep/wake strategy is implemented via (i)\
    \ duty\ncycling, (ii) medium-access control (MAC) protocols, and (iii) topology\
    \ control.\nDuty cycle is proposed in several studies to lower the power consumption\
    \ for different agricultural\napplications based on WSN. Zhang et al. [69] proposed\
    \ a WSN-based system to monitor soil moisture\nand analyzed the temporal and spatial\
    \ variability of soil moisture for variable irrigation. To reduce the\npower consumption\
    \ of the soil sensor nodes, the soil moisture sensors were always in sleep mode\
    \ and\nactivated only when data were to be collected. Million et al. [70] designed\
    \ a WSN for PA in Malawi\nand called it WiPAM. This system was intended to automate\
    \ irrigation and implement an irrigation\nmanagement system (IMS). The authors\
    \ investigated soil moisture variability. The sensor nodes\nwere homogeneous,\
    \ and each was composed of a ZigBee end device (ZED) and a ZigBee coordinator\n\
    (ZC). In the star topology, three sensors nodes were conﬁgured as ZED (in ﬁeld-nodes)\
    \ and one as a\ngateway node. Another node was conﬁgured as ZC for aggregating\
    \ data and actuating the irrigation\nvalves. The power source to sustain the operation\
    \ of the network was solar power. This approach\nwas complemented by an energy-efﬁcient\
    \ management approach. In other words, sensor nodes went\nto sleep when idle and\
    \ woke up to transmit data when required. The irrigation valves opened or\nclosed\
    \ depending on the values stored in the coordinator node. Ouadjaout et al. [71]\
    \ presented an\nenergy-efﬁcient WSN for soil moisture monitoring in an irrigation\
    \ system. The new platform, DZ50,\nconsists of an RFM12b transceiver and an ATmega328P\
    \ microcontroller. This platform consumes very\nlow power, and much energy can\
    \ be saved in sleep mode, in which the transceiver goes inactive (sleep\nmode)\
    \ for long periods. Comparison showed that the performance of DZ50 is better than\
    \ that of\nTelosB and MicaZ. Speciﬁcally, the battery lifetime of DZ50 is seven\
    \ times that of TelosB and MicaZ\nbased on a 10 s sampling period. Monitoring\
    \ of environmental conditions, such as wind direction,\nwind speed, humidity,\
    \ temperature, conductivity, rain level, pH, and water level, in crop ﬁelds was\n\
    presented in [72]. A solar cell was used to power several sensor nodes deployed\
    \ at a distance of 500 m\nto 5 km. WSNs based on IEEE 802.15.4 (C1120 transceiver)\
    \ and GPRS/3G were adopted to transmit the\nrural environments to the base station.\
    \ Energy was saved through low duty cycling (3.3%) for the RF\ntransceiver; the\
    \ saved energy is equivalent to 30 s of wake up time every 15 min. In addition,\
    \ a 2-watt\nsolar cell was used to supply power to the overall system, whose total\
    \ average power consumption\nwas 207 mW.\nMAC protocols were also proposed in\
    \ previous research on agriculture WSNs [39,73–76].\nSudha et al. [39] proposed\
    \ an energy-efﬁcient TDMA-based algorithm for wireless sensor\ncommunications\
    \ in an automatic irrigation system. Their experiment involved a header node that\n\
    collected data directly from all the nodes in the ﬁeld and passed these data to\
    \ the base station (BS).\nThis network arrangement was a star single-hop topology.\
    \ These techniques attain power savings\nof 10% with a high communication distance\
    \ of 1 km between the sensor node and the base station.\nHowever, when this distance\
    \ increases, the power consumption also increases. López et al. [75]\nproposed\
    \ a WSN for monitoring horticultural yields, which are disseminated among small\
    \ plots\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n11 of 45\nscattered at a communication distance\
    \ of 10 km. The air temperature and soil moisture are collected\nduring a 10-week\
    \ period. The authors adopted the MAC protocol and star topology to conserve the\n\
    power consumption of the sensor nodes that used the IEEE 802.15.4 standard based\
    \ on the CC2420\ntransceiver. The lifetimes of the soil moisture and air temperature\
    \ sensor nodes are 1024 days and\n222 days, respectively, utilizing a battery\
    \ that delivers 2700 mAh.\nThe topology protocol scheme can be used in agricultural\
    \ monitoring WSNs to modify the network\ntopology according to the application\
    \ requirements, thereby reducing the number of active nodes in\na network. Some\
    \ nodes in the network can enter sleep mode to prolong the network lifetime when\n\
    they are not sensing the same area of interest. Aneeth and Jayabarathi [77] implemented\
    \ Ad hoc\nOn-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) and Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocols\
    \ over a different\ntopology of ZigBee WSN (i.e., cluster topology, random topology,\
    \ star topology with gateway based\non two cases; inside and outside) in simulation\
    \ environments by using the OPNET software (Riverbed,\nSan Francisco, CA, USA).\
    \ Twenty soil moisture sensor nodes and one gateway node were distributed\nin\
    \ a farmland with a dimension of 100 × 100 m2. Each node sends information about\
    \ the soil moisture\nto the gateway node through the ZigBee wireless protocol.\
    \ The gateway node passes the information to\nthe controlling system to control\
    \ the irrigation valve system. Their study showed that the star topology\nusing\
    \ DSR protocol reduces the power consumption of the WSN because it has less routing\
    \ overhead\ncompared with AODV protocol. Table 2 shows the comparison of power\
    \ reduction technique based on\nsleep/wake schemes for previous research in agricultural\
    \ applications.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n12 of 45\nTable 2. Sleep/wake schemes\

    \ 17, 1781\n13 of 45\n3.1.2. Radio Optimization\nPrevious studies show that the\
    \ power is mostly dissipated in the RF components of WSNs than\nin data processing\
    \ units, such as microcontrollers and microprocessors [80]. A number of scholars\n\
    have applied various radio optimization schemes or techniques, including (i) transmission\
    \ power\ncontrol (TPC), (ii) modulation scheme, and (iii) cognitive radio, to\
    \ reduce the power consumption\nof the RF components of agriculture sensor nodes.\
    \ In the TPC scheme, the sensor nodes modify the\ntransmitted power to save energy,\
    \ stimulate avoiding interference, and establish a communication\nlink [81]. TPC\
    \ can be used in the agricultural ﬁeld [82,83], where the RF transmitted power\
    \ of the\nsensor nodes can be modiﬁed to reduce their power consumption based\
    \ on the measured distance\nbetween the sink node and the sensor nodes. Sahota\
    \ et al. [82] have investigated the application of\nTPC in reducing the power\
    \ consumption of the sensor nodes in precision agriculture-based WSNs.\nSeveral\
    \ power levels and different receiver sensitivity levels are considered to perform\
    \ the said process.\nThe network layers and MAC protocol in a WSN (based on CC1110)\
    \ for the agriculture domain are\nadopted to further lower the power consumption\
    \ of the sensor node. Results show that the power\nsaving that employs multiple\
    \ modes of transmitted power can be improved by approximately 10%\nrelative to\
    \ the traditional mode. By contrast, Kamarudin et al. [83] prolonged the lifetime\
    \ of the sensor\nnode by more than 8.5% by modifying the transmitted power of\
    \ the CC2420 communication device.\nA cognitive radio is an intelligent wireless\
    \ communication network [84] in which the wireless\ncommunication channel in the\
    \ spectrum band can be selected efﬁciently [85]. The transmission metrics\n(e.g.,\
    \ transmitted power, carrier frequency, and modulation scheme) can be adjusted\
    \ accordingly.\nA cognitive radio requires more energy than conventional devices\
    \ do because it includes sophisticated\nand complex functions [86]. Therefore,\
    \ an energy-efﬁcient cognitive radio network poses challenges,\nespecially with\
    \ regard to the use of battery energy. In wireless communication, the electromagnetic\n\
    spectrum is fully occupied, with several bands being partially used or unused.\
    \ This situation supports\nthe utilization of a cognitive radio, in which spectrum\
    \ holes can be utilized.\nSabri et al. [19] fused fuzzy logic control (FLC) with\
    \ a ZigBee wireless sensor actor network\n(WSAN), which can sense the surroundings\
    \ and respond in ideal performance without interference\nfrom agricultural crops.\
    \ FLC assists the specialists in managing complex systems more compared with\n\
    traditional control methods, which are ineffective in terms of ﬂexibility, energy,\
    \ productivity, and labor\ninterference. Two signiﬁcant greenhouse environment\
    \ parameters (i.e., humidity and temperature)\nare monitored during daytime and\
    \ nighttime. The results show that the intelligent technique-based\nFLC can signiﬁcantly\
    \ improve the WSAN lifespan. Therefore, the WSAN can work for 14 years with a\n\
    210 mAh battery power based on the FLC merged with WSAN.\nThe power consumption\
    \ of networks can be directly affected by the modulation scheme [87]. The\nmodulation\
    \ parameters can be adjusted to their optimal values to preserve the minimum power\n\
    consumption of radio modules. Anane et al. [88] investigated the Frequency-shift\
    \ keying (FSK) and\nMinimum-shift keying (MSK) modulation strategies to minimize\
    \ the total power consumption of\nthe sensor node required to transmit given data\
    \ packets. Through their extensive study, the authors\nconcluded that MSK outperforms\
    \ FSK in terms of power consumption. However, several modulation\nschemes cannot\
    \ be used in the ZigBee wireless protocol that operates at 2.4 GHz because this\
    \ protocol\nsupports a single modulation scheme. Speciﬁcally, the ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol works with offset\nquadrature phase-shift keying (OQPSK) [89]. Table\

    \ Data Mitigation\nData mitigation presents another power consumption solution\
    \ for agriculture WSNs to reduce the\namount of data transmitted from source nodes\
    \ to destination nodes. Data mitigation can be achieved\nvia (i) data gathering,\
    \ (ii) data comparison, (iii) data rate, and (iv) data-driven techniques.\nData\
    \ gathering can extend the lifetime of sensor nodes in WSNs by minimizing redundant\
    \ data\ntransmission. In different applications of agriculture WSNs including\
    \ environment observation, the\nsensed data of the neighboring nodes may spatially\
    \ be associated. In this case, data combination\npresents an important method\
    \ for reducing the amount of redundant data, reducing the number\nof transmissions,\
    \ and minimizing the power consumption of the nodes in the network [90]. Data\n\
    gathering also reduces latency by minimizing data trafﬁc and improving the delay\
    \ between the sink\nand sensor nodes; after reducing the number of communications,\
    \ this approach can improve the\nexploitation of bandwidth [91]. Data merging\
    \ can be accomplished along a route starting from sensor\nnodes to sink nodes.\
    \ The nodes in a route can rebroadcast only the maximum, minimum, or average\n\
    amount of received data. The design of an energy-efﬁcient WSN-based data-gathering\
    \ scheme poses a\nsigniﬁcant challenge because this scheme must ensure a trade-off\
    \ among power consumption, latency,\nsecurity, data accuracy, and fault tolerance.\n\
    Gathering data in agricultural applications, including humidity, weather, temperature,\
    \ and soil\nmoisture, can minimize the power consumption of environment sensor\
    \ nodes by spatially correlating\nthe ﬁeld and redundant data of the sensor nodes\
    \ when the temperature does not change signiﬁcantly [1],\nespecially during nighttime.\
    \ For example, if the microcontroller of the temperature sensor node\nmeasures\
    \ the same temperature value for extended hours, then the sensor node sends the\
    \ temperature\nvalue every four hours to reduce power consumption. Merging the\
    \ temperature and humidity\nsensors into a single sensor may also reduce the power\
    \ consumption, size, and system complexity.\nAzaza et al. [17] integrated climate\
    \ condition parameters (i.e., temperature, CO2, humidity, and\nilluminance sensors)\
    \ inside a greenhouse and observed a comfortable growth of plants while saving\n\
    water resources and energy. The greenhouse was equipped with environment control\
    \ devices, such as\nventilation system, fogging system for humidiﬁcation, and\
    \ electrical heaters. A smart system based on\nfuzzy logic control correlated\
    \ humidity and temperature measurements is implemented to improve\nthe fogging\
    \ system operation. In that way, the power consumption of the fogging system can\
    \ be\nsigniﬁcantly reduced. In addition, the system was improved by a wireless\
    \ data observing platform\n(STM 32/F4 microcontroller and Virtex V FPGA board)\
    \ for logging and data routing, which provides\ndata access in real time. The\
    \ suggested control system based on fuzzy logic control was experimentally\nimplemented\
    \ and validated. The results revealed that the total energy and water usage decreased\
    \ by\n22% and 33%, respectively.\nMusaazi et al. [92] introduced a data caching\
    \ algorithm (DCAL) that optimizes the sleep/wake up\nperiods of ZigBee WSNs to\
    \ achieve low energy consumption and latency in PA application. In WSNs,\ndata\
    \ are collected from the source nodes and routed to the sink node; from the sink\
    \ node, the data\nare sent to the Internet. Reducing the transmission of duplicated\
    \ sensed data reduces the power\nconsumption. Energy conservation is paramount\
    \ during the communication phase to prolong the\nlifetime of sensor nodes. The\
    \ main method utilized to conserve energy involves switching off the nodes’\n\
    transceiver when they are not transmitting nor receiving packets. Additionally,\
    \ the data-gathering\nmethod for agriculture WSNs has been investigated in [93].\
    \ The proposed system includes ZigBee\nwireless sensor nodes, customized farming\
    \ personal digital assistants (PDAs), and a host PC. Each\nsensor node contains\
    \ four sensors to identify ﬁve agricultural ﬁeld parameters: soil temperature,\
    \ soil\nmoisture, environmental humidity, soil electrical conductivity, and environmental\
    \ temperature. The\nPDA combines the ZigBee coordinator node, GPRS module, and\
    \ GPS module. The ZigBee WSN\ngathers farming data and obtains GPS information\
    \ for each sensor node. It then passes the data to the\nhost PC through GPRS.\
    \ The experimental results show that the battery power of the sensor nodes can\n\
    be saved based on the data-gathering scheme.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n16 of 45\n\
    Data compression is a useful method for deploying sensor nodes with restricted\
    \ energy resources.\nInformation encoding can be performed in sensor nodes, whereas\
    \ information decoding can be\nperformed in sink nodes. Using compression techniques\
    \ to reduce the size of information that the\nsink nodes transmit over wireless\
    \ channels may also reduce the power consumption and extend the\nbattery life\
    \ of the sensor nodes. One study has applied data compression approaches to reduce\
    \ the\npower consumption for auto-irrigation system which based on CC1000 RF module\
    \ [41]. Based on this\nmethod, the battery of the sensor node can be extended\
    \ to 359 days.\nThe data-driven power reduction technique aims to reduce the amount\
    \ of sampled data by\nconserving the sensing accuracy to an appropriate level\
    \ for a speciﬁed application [94]. Thereby,\nthe amount of data to be transmitted\
    \ to the sink nodes can be minimized. Therefore, this technique\ncan reduce the\
    \ power consumption of agriculture WSNs and extend their battery life. A data-driven\n\
    algorithm is considered by Lerdsuwan and Phunchongharn [95] to solve the energy\
    \ consumption\nproblem of the sensor node in PA with low complexity and maintain\
    \ the transmission rate. Their\nexperiment reveals that their proposed algorithm\
    \ has higher energy efﬁciency than the ESPIN and\nSPIN algorithms in [96,97] by\
    \ 36.84% and 81.53%, respectively.\nThe data rate of RF transceivers can be adjusted\
    \ in the physical layer of a wireless protocol to\nreduce the power consumption\
    \ of the sensor node. Davis et al. [98] investigated the low battery\ncondition\
    \ of a sensor node to attain prolonged battery life for separate wireless sensor\
    \ nodes that\ncan preserve sampling suitability and reliability in communicating\
    \ accurate data. Different sensors,\nsuch as those for soil moisture, sap ﬂow,\
    \ and soil water, were examined to study the effect of sensing\ndebility due to\
    \ low battery voltage. The comparison of the data sampling rate of these sensors\
    \ shows\nthat sap ﬂow measurement is the best option for agricultural WSN. This\
    \ ﬁnding is attributed to the\nlow error obtained when the sampling interval increased\
    \ to 15 min while maintaining measurement\naccuracy. Table 4 shows the comparison\
    \ of power reduction technique based on data mitigation schemes\nfor previous\
    \ research in agricultural applications.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n17 of 45\nTable\

    \ power reduction scheme for agriculture WSNs to minimize\nthe path between sensor\
    \ nodes and sink node, thereby the power consumption of the WSN is reduced.\n\
    Routing protocol can be performed via (i) sink mobility, (ii) multi-path routing,\
    \ (iii) cluster architecture,\nand (iv) routing metric.\nSink mobility was adopted\
    \ in previous research [99,100]. Mathur et al. [99] proposed a novel\nmechanism\
    \ that adopts unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to gather data from forest regions\
    \ instead\nof classical sensing from nodes deployed in WSN. The proposed method\
    \ enables the UAV to collect\ndata from WSN in harsh terrain and transmit it to\
    \ the base station situated far from the sensing area.\nTherefore, the multi-hop\
    \ transmission between cluster heads can be completely avoided, and the\ncommunication\
    \ range can be extended.\nMulti-path routing has also been suggested by other\
    \ scholars for agriculture WSNs [67,68,101].\nRecently, Nikolidakis et al. [67]\
    \ proposed an agricultural ﬁeld weather monitoring system based on\nthe ZigBee\
    \ wireless protocol. An advance energy-efﬁcient routing protocol was implemented\
    \ for WSN\nto automate irrigation management. The transmitter could modify its\
    \ power based on the distance\nbetween the sensor node and base station to save\
    \ energy. The results revealed that network lifetime\nincreased to 1825 min. Hedley\
    \ et al. [101] developed a WSN soil moisture mapping and monitoring\nmethod to\
    \ provide information for irrigation scheduling. To conserve power, the sensor\
    \ nodes relayed\ndata to the BS every 15 min through the greatest energy-efﬁcient\
    \ route.\nCluster head method is considered by Ndzi et al. [102] to extend the\
    \ ZigBee WSN lifetime for\nagricultural application.\nIn addition, the quality\
    \ of the crop yields is improved and their cost\nis minimized. The research presented\
    \ WSN coverage measurements in a mixed crop farmland.\nAn adaptive energy consumption\
    \ model for each sensor node was proposed and used to compute the\nenergy consumption\
    \ in the network. A deployment model with a cluster head and two antennas was\n\
    also proposed and simulated to alleviate short network lifetime due to the vegetation\
    \ attenuation of\nsignals. This network deployment model extended the lifetime\
    \ of the network by a factor of more than\n20 compared with a deployment where\
    \ cluster heads are not used. Nikolidakis et al. [103] proposed\na new routing\
    \ protocol for WSN that can reduce the power consumption of sensor nodes through\n\
    balanced clustering. This protocol was called “equalized cluster head election\
    \ routing protocol”\n(ECHERP). ECHERP was implemented in Java language for 500\
    \ homogeneous nodes distributed in a\n100 × 100 m2 land. The simulation results\
    \ showed that the proposed protocol outperforms existing\nprotocols in terms of\
    \ power consumption. A potential application of this protocol is PA.\nAnother\
    \ type of routing protocol is called routing metric. Chen et al. [104] used two\
    \ routing\nmetrics, namely, remained energy and expected transmission count, to\
    \ compute the optimal routing\npath to the sink node that ensures low power consumption.\
    \ “A scalable context-aware objective\nfunction (SCAOF)” is proposed by combining\
    \ robustness-aware, energy-aware, resource-aware, and\nreliability-aware contexts\
    \ that render to the compound routing metrics scheme. The experiment is\nconducted\
    \ in a garden based on a testbed, which includes a uIPv6 protocol stack and contiki\
    \ OS. The\nobtained results prove that SCAOF can convey the desired advantages\
    \ on network lifespan prolonging,\nas well as high efﬁciency and reliability in\
    \ different hardware testbeds and simulation scenarios.\nTable 5 shows the comparison\

    \ Techniques\nA major limitation of sensor nodes is their limited battery capacity.\
    \ Several energy-efﬁcient\nschemes have been introduced in previous research to\
    \ solve the power consumption problem of sensor\nnodes. An alternative method\
    \ that has been utilized to address the problem of limited node lifespan is\n\
    the use of energy-harvesting techniques. Numerous techniques have been developed\
    \ to allow sensor\nnodes to harvest different types of energy, such as solar,\
    \ wireless power transfer (WPT), mechanical\nvibration, kinetic, and wind energy,\
    \ from different environments [110] (Figure 2). Compared with\ntraditional sensor\
    \ nodes, rechargeable sensor nodes can work continuously for a long lifetime.\
    \ Ambient\nenergy can be converted to electrical energy and used directly to supply\
    \ the sensor nodes or can be\nstored and used later on. In agricultural applications,\
    \ energy harvesting can be used to prolong the\nlifetime of sensor nodes. Energy-harvesting\
    \ techniques for previous research works employed in\nprecision agriculture are\
    \ shown in Table 7. The said table lists the categories of energy-harvesting\n\
    techniques, types of wireless protocols, and output energy/power of energy-harvesting\
    \ techniques.\nIn addition, the form of agricultural applications, and limitations\
    \ of each article are also highlighted.\nEnergy-harvesting mechanisms can be implemented\
    \ with batteries for the sensor nodes. For\nexample, a sensor node using solar\
    \ energy to charge its batteries can work extensively during daytime\nwhen adequate\
    \ sunlight is available. Meanwhile, the sensor node can use its batteries through\
    \ power\nreduction techniques, such as sleep mode (i.e., duty cycle), at night\
    \ when sunlight is unavailable to save\nenergy. In addition, the sensor node can\
    \ enter restricted sleep periods (i.e., low duty cycle) and reduce\ntransmission\
    \ power when its batteries possess low residual energy [111]. Furthermore, adopting\
    \ a\nmaximum power point tracking system is a reliable battery charging technique\
    \ for long-term operation.\nThe charge–discharge cycle of the battery is minimized\
    \ [112].\n3.2.1. Solar Energy\nSolar energy based on photovoltaic system and methods\
    \ can be used in agricultural applications\nbased on WSNs [113]. Therefore, solar\
    \ cells provide a good solution [114] to ensure the survivability\nof the agriculture\
    \ monitoring system. Solar cell energy has been used by several studies to provide\n\
    long-term energy to sensor nodes in agriculture applications.\nGutiérrez et al.\
    \ [40] developed an irrigation system based on the ZigBee wireless protocol. The\n\
    system was developed to improve water usage for agricultural crops. Temperature\
    \ and soil moisture\nsensors in WSN were placed in the root of the plants to send\
    \ sensor information to a web application\nvia a gateway. The proposed algorithm\
    \ controls the water quantity based on threshold values of soil\nmoisture and\
    \ temperature that are programmed in a microcontroller-based gateway. The WSN\
    \ is\npowered by solar cell panels and rechargeable batteries. Water savings of\
    \ up to 90% were achieved\nrelative to the conventional irrigation method. Considering\
    \ that the system is cost effective and\nautonomous, it can be utilized in geographically\
    \ isolated regions where water sources are limited.\nZou et al. [68] improved\
    \ the battery lifetime of a WSN based on harvested energy (i.e., solar cell)\n\
    utilizing shadow detection. With this strategy, sensor nodes can accordingly modify\
    \ their scheduling\nto optimize their power production and remaining battery levels.\
    \ Furthermore, data transmission is\noptimized through routing and clustering\
    \ mechanisms. A Bayesian network was employed to provide\nwarning reports of bottlenecks\
    \ along the path. The system was deployed in real time based on the\nTexas Instruments\
    \ CC2530 platform that includes the ZigBee wireless protocol. The battery (lithium\n\
    type with a storage capacity of 2500 mAh) of the sensor node was charged from\
    \ the solar cell panel\nwhen the harvested power was adequate. The experimental\
    \ results showed that these techniques\nallow network activities to occur in a\
    \ continuous and effective manner.\nIn [115], a micro-irrigation system that relies\
    \ on a small solar-powered cell was developed. The\nenergy input, energy output,\
    \ greenhouse gas productions, and solar cell installation for rural areas\nwere\
    \ investigated with the proposed co-located system. The researchers compared their\
    \ system\nwith another commonly used method (i.e., aloe vera cultivation) in terms\
    \ of life cycle. The life cycle\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n23 of 45\nevaluation\
    \ showed that the proposed system is economical for several rural areas and may\
    \ provide\nopportunities for agriculture electriﬁcation and motivate economic\
    \ growth.\nRoblin [116] presented an irrigation system relying on a solar cell\
    \ for rural areas where sunlight is\noften available. The irrigation system includes\
    \ pumps working on a solar cell instead of an electricity\ngrid and/or a diesel\
    \ generator. The study showed that the irrigation system based on a solar cell\
    \ is\nbetter than systems that depend on other energy resources because the electricity\
    \ grid is unavailable at\nall times, and the operating cost of diesel pumps is\
    \ high and relies mainly on the diesel price. Although\nthe solar-powered system\
    \ was relatively expensive, it became a free source of energy after installation\n\
    in the rural area and proved to be a worthwhile investment in the long term. A\
    \ similar irrigation\nsystem was proposed in [117]. The system adopts photovoltaic\
    \ panels to power a water pump that\nconverts the continuous drift of water into\
    \ a drop drift to achieve increased water usage efﬁciency.\nKwon et al. [118]\
    \ suggested a novel prediction technique for energy harvesting with a solar\n\
    cell within three hours. Moreover, the packet transmissions of the sensor nodes\
    \ can be controlled\ndepending on the estimated energy. Packet transmissions and\
    \ energy harvesting are integrated to\nimprove the WSN performance. The integration\
    \ of these schemes enhances the prediction accuracy\nand improves the WSN throughput\
    \ and power consumption. The throughput of the sensor node can\nbe increased by\
    \ shortening the packet transmission period. By contrast, when the packet transmission\n\
    period increases, the power consumption of the sensor node decreases. The experimental\
    \ results show\nthat the proposed packet transmission scheme is superior to the\
    \ others in terms of data throughput\nand deadline miss rate. The proposed energy-harvesting\
    \ method is also predicted more precisely than\nothers by 6.92%.\nA study [119]\
    \ used a solar cell to provide energy to a WSN deployed in a greenhouse. The\n\
    humidity and temperature of the greenhouse were controlled through a management\
    \ and monitoring\nsystem, which was based on a low-power MSP430 (Texas Instruments,\
    \ Dallas, TX, USA) microcontroller\nand an ultra-low-power nRF24L01 transceiver\
    \ (Nordic Semiconductor, Oslo, Norway). The power\nconsumption of the WSN was\
    \ minimized as much as possible. In another study, a WSN-based ZigBee\n(CC2420\
    \ module) wireless transceiver and microcontroller (low-power ATmega128L) supplied\
    \ by\nthe solar cell as a battery charger were considered to monitor the humidity,\
    \ temperature, rain level,\nand leaf wetness of vineyards [120]. The WSN covered\
    \ 30 m between ZigBee units with a low power\nconsumption (35 and 38 mW in transmission\
    \ and reception modes, respectively).\n3.2.2. Wireless Power Transfer\nRecent\
    \ developments in wireless power transfer (WPT) are expected to increase the lifetime\n\
    of WSNs signiﬁcantly and make them continuously operational, given that WPT techniques\
    \ can\nbe utilized to transmit electromagnetic energy between transmitter and\
    \ receiver devices without\nany contact between the two. WPT is expected to overcome\
    \ the constraint of the supply of WSNs.\nConsequently, some researchers highlighted\
    \ the utilization of mobile node that can deliver power\nto deployed sensor nodes\
    \ such as [121,122].\nWPT technology poses a challenge to the energy\ncooperation\
    \ between neighboring nodes in WSNs. Therefore, in the future, sensor nodes could\n\
    harvest energy from the environment and transfer this energy to other nodes in\
    \ the network; in this\nmanner, a self-sustaining network can be achieved [123].\
    \ Accordingly, recent research has investigated\nmulti-hop energy transfer [124,125],\
    \ which paved the way for new energy cooperative schemes and\nWPT charging protocols.\n\
    WPT can be classiﬁed into three main subcategories:\n(i) electromagnetic (EM)\
    \ radiation,\n(ii) magnetic resonator coupling, and (iii) inductive coupling,\
    \ as shown in Figure 2. Wireless charging\nin WSNs can be performed via EM radiation\
    \ and magnetic resonant coupling. EM signals suffer from\nattenuation over distance,\
    \ and active radiation may pose a threat to the human body. Meanwhile,\nmagnetic\
    \ resonant coupling can address the power requirements of agriculture based on\
    \ WSNs because\nof its efﬁciency within a distance of several meters. Many studies\
    \ used WPT to charge sensor nodes\nfor different applications and ﬁelds. WPT-based\
    \ inductive coupling [121] has been used to charge\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n24\
    \ of 45\nthe battery of sensor nodes scattered in agriculture ﬁelds. The energy\
    \ is transferred from the source\ncoil (mounted on a UAV) to the receiver coil\
    \ (attached with sensor nodes). A 2.4 W transfer power\nis transferred to charge\
    \ a single sensor node. The results addressed a number of limitations and\nchallenges\
    \ related to the charging of sensor nodes via a UAV. In addition, the results\
    \ revealed that\nthe battery lifetime of the deployed sensors can be signiﬁcantly\
    \ extended through the UAV. A similar\napproach was adopted by Chen et al. [122]\
    \ to charge a WSN in an agricultural ﬁeld through the\nharvesting of electromagnetic\
    \ radiation.\n3.2.3. Air Flow Energy\nHarnessing wind energy is another energy-harvesting\
    \ technique that can be utilized to provide\npower to sensor nodes in agricultural\
    \ applications. An adaptive routing protocol, wind energy\nharvesting, and sleep\
    \ scheduling were considered in [126] to minimize the power consumption of the\n\
    ZigBee transceiver and extend the lifetime of the WSN.\n3.2.4. Vibration Energy\n\
    Vibration energy based on piezoelectric can be used to charge the battery of sensor\
    \ nodes to prolong\ntheir lifetime. Müller et al. [127] have been analyzed various\
    \ WSN protocols based on ZigBee (CC2420\nand CC2500) and CC1100 with respect to\
    \ their applicability in the agricultural setting. Furthermore,\na fully synchronous\
    \ protocol with a time-slot architecture for a WSN has been proposed for agricultural\n\
    machinery to achieve real-time capability, low latency, and deterministic behavior.\
    \ The objective of\ntheir application was to monitor the back door position and\
    \ ﬁlling level of a forage wagon using a\nZigBee (CC2420) RF transceiver. Clock\
    \ synchronization among all nodes is implemented to ensure\nstrict power on/sleep\
    \ times of each sensor node. Meanwhile, an energy-harvesting unit based on a\n\
    piezoelectric material has been designed; the unit provides an average power of\
    \ 200 µW to sensor\nnodes. In this case, the sensor node can transmit a data payload\
    \ of nine bytes in 40 ms.\n3.2.5. Water Flow Energy\nMulti-energy sources (water,\
    \ wind, and solar) platform is designed for precision agricultural\napplications\
    \ by Morais et al. [128]. The authors explored water ﬂow, wind speed and solar\
    \ radiation\nfeasible energy sources to encounter the requirements of ZigBee router\
    \ node in WSN. Thus, several\npowered solutions for WSN is presented. Design considerations\
    \ regarding water ﬂow energy, the water\nﬂow in the pipes of crops irrigation\
    \ system are employed to generate the energy for ZigBee router node.\nThis idea\
    \ can be applied in different agricultural applications such as greenhouses, aquaculture,\
    \ and\nhydroponic systems, where the water recirculation in pipes is continuous.\
    \ Like to bulky hydroelectric\ngeneration utilities, a water ﬂow in the pipes,\
    \ derived from the main water source, can be employed\nto run a turbine joined\
    \ to a small direct current (DC) generator. The experimental results revealed\n\
    that the three energy sources combined together can generate an energy of 58 mAh,\
    \ more than the\nrequirement of the ZigBee router node (39 mAh).\n3.2.6. Microbial\
    \ Fuel Cell Energy\nAnother type of energy harvesting technique is called microbial\
    \ fuel cell. This technique is extracted\nfrom energy neutral system. Sartori\
    \ and Brunelli [129] proposed microbial fuel cell to supply the\nunderground freshwater\
    \ system that used for monitoring the water level in the phreatic zone, artesian\n\
    wells, and tanks. The proposed system comprises a low-cost phreatimeter sensor,\
    \ a low-power\nmicrocontroller (i.e., MSP430FR5739), and a low-power LoRa wireless\
    \ protocol. However, the amount\nof microbial fuel cell energy extraction of 296\
    \ µW is not enough to supply LoRa wireless protocol and\nmicrocontroller directly\
    \ when they are in active mode. Therefore, a DC-to-DC boost is employed to\nraise\
    \ the small input voltages of 130 mV to 4.5 V.\nEvidently, most agricultural applications\
    \ prefer to use solar cells as battery chargers of WSNs\nbecause these cells are\
    \ easy to install, work efﬁciently when sunlight is available, and supply more\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 1781\n25 of 45\nenergy compared with other energy-harvesting\
    \ techniques as shown in Table 7. In addition, the table\nshows most of the previous\
    \ scholars adopted ZigBee wireless protocol. Clearly, employing ZigBee\nsupports\
    \ our study that this wireless protocol is more suitable for agricultural monitoring\
    \ systems.\nSolar panels can supply 100 mW/cm2, whereas radio frequency, thermal,\
    \ vibration, wind, microbial\nfuel cell, magnetic resonant coupling WPT, and water\
    \ ﬂow can supply 0.001, 0.06, 0.8, 1.0, 0.296, 14, and\n19 mWs, respectively [128–131].\
    \ For example, as shown in Figure 3 (Part A), if the power consumption\nof the\
    \ WSN components presented in [120] is 35 mW for ZigBee (Chipcon CC2420), 0.27\
    \ mW for\nthe temperature sensor, 3 mW for the humidity sensor, 0.27 mW for the\
    \ rain gauge sensor, 5 mW\nfor the leaf wetness sensor, and 24 mW for the ATmega128L\
    \ microcontroller [132], a single solar cell\n(2 × 2 cm2) panel can adequate supply\
    \ this WSN. However, when the power consumption of the WSN\nincreases, the dimension\
    \ of the solar cell panel also needs to be increased.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n\

    \ the negative ecological impact, prevent the prevalence of plant-eating \npests\
    \ or plant diseases, alert farmers about farm fires [141], and increase the profitability\
    \ of several \nagricultural production schemes. Agriculture involves farming,\
    \ planting, and animal rearing, and it \nhas grown under the scope of IoT recently\
    \ [5]. Tracking of animals, monitoring of farms, and \nirrigation processes are\
    \ the main domains of IoT for cultivation [142]. Furthermore, feeding, rearing,\

    \ domain [143]. \nConsequently, several IoT modular architectures have been proposed\
    \ and implemented by scholars \nfor PA monitoring (as presented in Table 8). Real-time\
    \ ecological information can be remotely \ngathered from the agricultural surroundings\

    transfer sensor data to the gateway (i.e., Intel Edison to reduce the power consumption).\
    \ The gateway\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n29 of 45\nwas in charge of collected information\
    \ from different sensors and passed the information to the cloud\nserver. The\
    \ proposed system resulted in improved crop quality and minimized negative ecological\n\
    effect. In [145], the usage of water in smart irrigation systems was controlled\
    \ based on developed IoT\nplatforms. A cloud agriculture ﬁeld-monitoring scheme\
    \ was designed and implemented to enable\nthe farmer to monitor the soil condition.\
    \ Soil moisture and weather temperature were monitored to\nautomate the irrigation\
    \ system in farm while minimizing water consumption, which led to reduced\ncost\
    \ and maintained environmental beneﬁts. The proposed water irrigation system included\
    \ three\nmain parts: a WSN and actuator, a cloud platform, and user application.\
    \ The WSN and actuator part\nconsisted of sensor nodes for collecting the soil\
    \ moisture and weather temperature, an actuator node\nto control the irrigation\
    \ process, and a sink node that could pass all farm information to the cloud\n\
    platform. All sensor, sink, and actuator nodes adopted low-power ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol.\nWSN and 3G network-based agriculture IoT was considered in [146]\
    \ to monitor the air\ntemperature, air humidity, and soil moisture. The entire\
    \ system consisted of sensor nodes, actuators\nsink nodes, server, gateway, and\
    \ the mobile phone device of the farmer. The collected information by\nthe sensor\
    \ nodes was sent to the server via gateway and Internet network. The gateway connected\
    \ the\nWSN with the Internet to relay the command control among the sensor nodes,\
    \ the phone of the farmer,\nthe actuators, and the server. However, in this system,\
    \ the data transmission over the 3G network\nmust ensure real-time communications\
    \ to support the agricultural WSN.\nIoT-based agriculture applications changed\
    \ classical agricultural surveillance approaches by\nspeedily providing quantitative\
    \ data with signiﬁcant temporal and spatial resolution. Several IoT\nplatforms\
    \ have recently been available in the market. For instance, in agricultural applications,\n\
    SmartFarmNet [147] platforms can be used to provide more than 30 packages for\
    \ good commercial\nproducts, such as Libelium [45], and experimental, such as\
    \ Motes [148] and Arduino [149] sensor\nplatforms. Other examples of agricultural\
    \ applications based on IoT are provided in Table 8. The table\npresents a comparative\
    \ analysis of several scholars in terms of sensors, actuators, IoT devices, and\

    \ of PA domain such as sensors, microcontrollers, and wireless technologies\n\
    are highlighted and classiﬁed in Table 9. For better clariﬁcation, the sensors\
    \ are classiﬁed into three\nmain categories leaf wetness/plant, soil moisture,\
    \ and environment sensors [5,132]. These sensors can\nbe utilized in several potential\
    \ agriculture applications. In Table 9, the microcontroller/processor and\nwireless\
    \ protocols are also highlighted. Among the microcontrollers, the majority of\
    \ agriculture sensor\nnodes adopting ATmega128L because this microcontroller supports\
    \ data aggregation, decision making,\nstorage capability, ﬂash memory, low complexity,\
    \ and energy management through multi-levels of\npower down modes [132]. ZigBee\
    \ and LoRa wireless protocols/technologies are widely used in several\nagricultural\
    \ applications, as discussed previously in Section 2.\nIn precision agriculture,\
    \ to obtain high-quality products, the environmental parameters should be\ncontrolled\
    \ to provide optimal values. For example, the temperature rate that has a positive\
    \ effect on the\ngrowth of the pepper ﬁeld is between 20 and 25 ◦C. The temperature\
    \ in rainy, sunny, and nightly days\nshould be kept between 20 and 22 ◦C, between\
    \ 25 and 28 ◦C, and between 18 and 20 ◦C, respectively\nand the minimum value\
    \ should be not lower than 16–17 ◦C. Air humidity for pepper vegetables should\n\
    be kept between 60% and 70%. The high-temperature value combines with low humidity\
    \ value may\nbe caused a negative inﬂuence on the growth of the pepper. The maximum\
    \ humidity value in pepper\ngreenhouse should be not above 70%. Soil pH (i.e.,\
    \ soil acidity) is another factor that directly effects\non the pepper crops,\
    \ where it can measure the quantity of calcium in the soil. The soil for pepper\n\
    crops can be acid or alkaline depending on the weather conditions. It should be\
    \ acid for wet climate\nand alkaline for a dry climate. Soil with pH levels above\
    \ 7.0 is considered alkaline, while soil with\npH levels below 7.0 has acid nature.\
    \ Soil pH values must be controlled according to the type of the\nagricultural\
    \ yield. For pepper crop, the best values for pH gauge are between 6.5 and 5.5.\
    \ Therefore,\nthe humidity, temperature, and soil pH should be constantly supervised\
    \ in order to identify the right\ntime for draining and watering the agricultural\
    \ crops.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n33 of 45\nTable 9. Types of sensors, microcontrollers,\

    \ Limitations\nThe development of WSNs prompted new research trends in the agricultural\
    \ domain. Micro\nelectromechanical system (MEMS) technologies allow for the manufacture\
    \ of cheap and small sensors.\nThe pervasive nature of the process, together with\
    \ tiny, self-regulating sensor nodes, cost-effective\nequipment, and scalability,\
    \ indicate that WSNs can be used for agriculture automation [5]. However,\nregarding\
    \ the distribution of WSNs to observe different agricultural climates, a number\
    \ of open\nchallenges and limitations remain. Several of these challenges and\
    \ limitations in existing agricultural\napplications based on WSNs are listed\
    \ below together with suggestions on how to address them.\n(1)\nPower consumption\
    \ and battery life:\nA WSN consists of three main components:\nsensors,\nmicrocontrollers,\
    \ and RF transceivers. Given that the battery of a sensor node provides limited\n\
    energy, ensuring that the components of the sensor node consume minimum power\
    \ is crucial.\nIn particular, reducing the power consumption of the RF transceiver,\
    \ which consumes more power\nthan the other components in a sensor node, would\
    \ alleviate this problem [67,127]. Moreover,\nthis issue can be addressed in two\
    \ steps. The ﬁrst is to propose an intelligent energy-efﬁcient\nalgorithm. The\
    \ second step can be performed by utilizing available energy-harvesting techniques,\n\
    such as solar cells, vibration, and WPT.\n(2)\nCommunication range: WSNs suffer\
    \ from the effect of harsh ecological conditions because of the\nwide range of\
    \ open agricultural surroundings [5]. The WSN protocol contains mechanisms to\n\
    resist the effect of data transmission failures in the network, which increase\
    \ due to ecological\neffects. In agricultural applications, most wireless sensor\
    \ technologies support a relatively short\ncommunication range. Therefore, many\
    \ sensor and router nodes need to be diffused in a WSN.\nIn the point-to-point\
    \ Zigbee network, the communication distance can reach 100 m in outdoor\nenvironments.\
    \ The ZigBee communication range can be extended by adopting multi-tire, ad-hoc,\n\
    decentralized, and mesh network topologies. Drones or UAV also can be used as\
    \ a mobile router\nnode to extend the communication range within a farm ﬁeld.\
    \ A drone could pass the collected\ndata from the sensor nodes to the master node\
    \ through multi-hop. However, using drones entails\nother challenges and limitations.\n\
    (3)\nPropagation losses:\nIn agricultural applications, WSNs must be able to work\
    \ in diverse\nsurroundings, such as ground, bare land, orchards, greenhouses,\
    \ farms, and complex topography;\nthey must also be able to operate in all climate\
    \ conditions. All these conditions inﬂuence the\nperformance of radio propagation.\
    \ Whether the topography is simple or complicated, the\ncommunication possibility\
    \ between the points in a WSN still suffers from serious challenges.\nThe signal\
    \ transmitted from the sensor nodes in agricultural applications need to pass\
    \ through a\nheavy crop canopy to arrive to at the receiver nodes, which cannot\
    \ ensure a sufﬁcient clearance\narea and will cause signal propagation absorption,\
    \ reﬂection, attenuation, and scattering. In\nthis case, the link quality is degraded,\
    \ especially when the signal spreads through dense crops.\nTherefore, when deploying\
    \ WSNs, communication link quality and temporal and spatial variables\nmust be\
    \ guaranteed. The communication performance of WSNs is related to the working\n\
    surroundings. Therefore, due to the limited resources and power budget of WSNs,\
    \ an accurate\nwireless channel path loss model must be adopted to reﬂect the\
    \ propagation features. This model\nis expected to demonstrate correct optimization\
    \ and network evaluation performance throughout\nthe deployment design process\
    \ to develop the energy efﬁciency of the nodes [15], improve the\ntarget detection\
    \ and localization applications [16], decrease the number of retransmission, and\n\
    ensure Quality of Service (QoS) of the network [175].\n(4)\nRouting: Different\
    \ problems can emerge due to packet collision and limited bandwidth, which\nare\
    \ introduced by channel propagation, and so on. Therefore, when a WSN is deployed\
    \ in a wide\narea in farm ﬁelds, multi-hop is required. Kim et al. [3] developed\
    \ an independent mobile robot\nplatform based on a mobility task for surveillance\
    \ to overcome channel interference.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n35 of 45\n(5)\nLocalization\
    \ and tracking: Tracking and localization of a herd of cattle are considered smart\
    \ farm\napplications based on WSNs. For example, a WSN can be employed to track\
    \ and localize of dairy\ncows to enable herd management. ZigBee wireless protocol\
    \ is used to monitor animal locations\nand behaviors, such as walking and standing,\
    \ lying down, and grazing [16,18]. In this context,\nseveral considerations, such\
    \ as radio interference, animal situation, and mobility, changes in\nWSN topology,\
    \ penetration depth of the signal through the animal body, height of the collar,\
    \ and\naccess point antennas, need to be taken into account [176]. These considerations\
    \ pose challenges\nin the localization and tracking of the animals.\n(6)\nReliability:\
    \ Agricultural monitoring systems based on different environmental sensors can\
    \ also\nbe used to monitor pollution aside from climate conditions. Important\
    \ information on climate\nconditions is reported to related agencies and farmers\
    \ from a remote location for advance\ninvestigations. Dangerous information needs\
    \ to be dealt with immediately in an emergency,\nwhich means that data transmission\
    \ in WSNs should demonstrate high reliability [3].\n(7)\nScalability: In agricultural\
    \ applications, the construction of WSN-based fault-tolerant and\nrobust hierarchical\
    \ architectures requires large-scale deployment relative to single-level network\n\
    architectures.\nA hierarchical architecture can be scaled up for developing applications\
    \ by\nduplicating to several ﬁelds. In this context, to increase the number of\
    \ WSNs over a vast area,\nmultiple wireless router nodes are placed in an agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld to guarantee sustained operation.\n(8)\nCost: The total hardware and software\
    \ costs of sensor nodes are important. The design of sensor\nnodes for any agricultural\
    \ application level must involve a low cost while demonstrating a robust\nperformance;\
    \ moreover, the design needs to be available for use by poor country markets [5].\n\
    This challenge can be overcome by reducing software and hardware costs further.\n\
    (9)\nReal time: Most crops are vulnerable to climate conditions, such as humidity,\
    \ intensity of\nillumination, and temperature. This vulnerability is a burden\
    \ to farmers who monitor changes\nin climate conditions hourly and/or daily because\
    \ doing so is labor-intensive. Moreover, in\ngreenhouses, a ﬁre can occur and\
    \ lead to severe agricultural disasters. This evidence suggests\nthat the monitoring\
    \ of the ecological conditions of agricultural WSNs needs to be in real time.\n\
    Real-time monitoring will enhance yield production and plant growth and avoid\
    \ dangerous\ndisasters in farms [3].\n(10) Storage and recording of data: Large\
    \ amounts of data are recorded from agriculture observing\nsystems because several\
    \ WSNs in agricultural applications contain several sensors for crop\ngrowth analysis\
    \ and harvesting estimation. This condition requires the base station to monitor\n\
    changes in farm ﬁelds by analyzing patterns. The base station must thus be supported\
    \ by a high\nstorage capacity.\n(11) Security: Security and protection are important\
    \ issues in agricultural products. Protection\nfrom insects or attacks of rodents\
    \ in grain stores or ﬁelds is essential. Such a challenge must\nbe considered\
    \ to maintain the security level of agriculture. Protection and security can be\n\
    achieved based on real-time analysis and processing of agricultural information\
    \ without human\nintrusion [159].\n(12) Delay tolerance: Critical delay poses\
    \ a challenge to agricultural applications. Some agricultural\napplications can\
    \ be considered as time sensitive, such as those used in farm ﬁre detection,\n\
    detection of exposure of crops to pests, cow heat event detection during milking,\
    \ and exposure of\ncattle to heat for a certain period. Such information must\
    \ be transmitted as fast as possible if the\ncritical issue is to be handled.\
    \ In such a case, a tradeoff between energy consumption and data\ntimelines is\
    \ necessary. By contrast, some agricultural applications are delay tolerant (i.e.,\
    \ time\ninsensitive), such as protein content, milk fat [177], gathering data\
    \ from soil and grass monitoring.\nWith delay tolerant approach, the short range\
    \ low power wireless protocols can be used [178].\nWhere the information of the\
    \ agricultural ﬁeld can be collected and transferred to the master\nnode or to\
    \ a cloud computing node using “messengers” e.g., a mobile node (mobile robot\
    \ or\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n36 of 45\nUAV). Consequently, the cost [179] and\
    \ the complexity of the agriculture WSN will be reduced\nand the lifetime will\
    \ be increased.\n(13) Fault tolerance: Fault tolerance is a crucial feature of\
    \ WSNs for succeeding PA. Several faults may\noccur in PA based on the WSN system,\
    \ which are (i) communication failure, (ii) faulty sensor\nsetting, (iii) sensor\
    \ component faults producing incorrect value, and (iv) node failure because of\n\
    exhausted battery or any other cause. Gutiérrez et al. [40] introduced communication\
    \ failure and\nnode fault tolerance for an irrigation system. If any fault occurs,\
    \ the irrigation system tracks the\ndefault irrigation program. The node energy\
    \ depletion failure was minimized in [1,40,180] by\nadopting solar-cell-powered\
    \ nodes. Data aggregation and topology control schemes are probable\nto be fault\
    \ tolerant for deploying sensor nodes in a vast area.\n(14) Data management: The\
    \ data management in agriculture poses a challenge because the large\namount of\
    \ data that can be collected from several sensors spread in agricultural ﬁeld,\
    \ especially\nwhen the agricultural data are intended to be connected to the cloud.\
    \ Determination of the\n(i) data analysis method, (ii) data collection schemes,\
    \ (iii) sensor types, (iv) semantic sensor\nnetworking, (v) big data, and (vi)\
    \ complex event processing enables the designer to manage\nthese crucial aspects.\
    \ The integration of IoT and software-deﬁned network also introduces a\npromising\
    \ and new methodology in deployment, monitoring, and design of network services\n\
    and resources [181].\n(15) Heterogeneous sensors: Integration of wired and wireless\
    \ heterogeneous sensors into information\nplatforms to perform interoperability\
    \ pose challenges in PA. Chen et al. [152] proposed “web\nservice-enabled cyber-physical\
    \ infrastructure” to solve this issue. The proposed system was able\nto integrate,\
    \ process, acquire, and distribute surveillance data from different physical sensors\n\
    spread in the PA system over the Internet. The infrastructure was executed to\
    \ serve as an\narchitecture middleware between PA clients and heterogeneous sensors.\n\
    6. Conclusions\nA review of WSN-based agricultural applications was presented.\
    \ A comparison was conducted\namong different wireless technologies or protocols,\
    \ such as WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, GPRS/3G/4G,\nLoRa, and SigFox. The comparison\
    \ results revealed that the ZigBee and LoRa wireless protocols are\nmore convenient\
    \ for agricultural applications than the others because of its low power consumption\n\
    and suitable communication range for ZigBee and long for LoRa. A classiﬁcation\
    \ of energy-efﬁcient\ntechniques or algorithms and energy-harvesting techniques\
    \ was also provided. Based on the presented\ntaxonomy, we show that signiﬁcant\
    \ types of energy-efﬁcient and energy-harvesting techniques\ncan be used in the\
    \ agriculture domain. Previous research was also investigated and compared\nto\
    \ explore the current problems in agricultural applications based on WSNs and\
    \ obtain optimum\nsolutions for maintaining system performance. Challenges and\
    \ limitations were introduced for\ndesign considerations in the future. The state-of-the-art\
    \ approaches of IoT in agricultural applications\nwere reviewed and compared to\
    \ explore various sensors, actuators, devices, IoT platforms, and\napplication\
    \ layers.\nAcknowledgments: The authors would like to thank Al-Raﬁdain University\

    \ countries with water scarcity.\nThis also aﬀects\nagriculture, as a large amount\
    \ of water is dedicated to that use. The possible consequences of global\nwarming\
    \ lead to the consideration of creating water adaptation measures to ensure the\
    \ availability\nof water for food production and consumption. Thus, studies aimed\
    \ at saving water usage in the\nirrigation process have increased over the years.\
    \ Typical commercial sensors for agriculture irrigation\nsystems are very expensive,\
    \ making it impossible for smaller farmers to implement this type of\nsystem.\
    \ However, manufacturers are currently oﬀering low-cost sensors that can be connected\
    \ to\nnodes to implement aﬀordable systems for irrigation management and agriculture\
    \ monitoring. Due to\nthe recent advances in IoT and WSN technologies that can\
    \ be applied in the development of these\nsystems, we present a survey aimed at\
    \ summarizing the current state of the art regarding smart\nirrigation systems.\
    \ We determine the parameters that are monitored in irrigation systems regarding\n\
    water quantity and quality, soil characteristics and weather conditions. We provide\
    \ an overview of\nthe most utilized nodes and wireless technologies. Lastly, we\
    \ will discuss the challenges and the best\npractices for the implementation of\
    \ sensor-based irrigation systems.\nKeywords: irrigation; IoT; precision agriculture;\
    \ sensors\n1. Introduction\nThe lack of fresh water is a rising concern, particularly\
    \ in the Mediterranean countries or southern\nAsian countries such as India. Among\
    \ the countries in Europe, the Mediterranean countries are the\nmost vulnerable\
    \ to drought [1]. A connection has been established between climate policies and\
    \ water\nmanagement. Water management can be aﬀected by diﬀerent variables such\
    \ as the water demand\nfrom the diﬀerent sectors or the consequences of some degrees\
    \ of warming on hydrological resources.\nClimate change and its eﬀects are a recurrent\
    \ topic in research papers regarding water resources and\nagriculture. The possible\
    \ consequences of global warming have led to the consideration of creating\nwater\
    \ adaptation measures to ensure the availability of water for food production\
    \ and people and\nto maintain ecosystems [2]. Furthermore, the safety of the water\
    \ to be consumed by humans and\nto be returned to the environment must be ensured.\
    \ The possible risks of climate change are an\nincrease in water shortage, the\
    \ reduction of water quality, the increase in water and soil salinity,\nthe biodiversity\
    \ loss, the increase in irrigation requirements or the possible cost of emergency\
    \ and\nremediation actions. These reasons have led to an increase in the number\
    \ of studies focused on\nreducing water usage in irrigation processes. Some of\
    \ these studies suggest the implementation of\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042; doi:10.3390/s20041042\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n2 of 48\nsocial, economic\
    \ and climate change policies, as well as the implementation of technological\
    \ innovations\nto improve water management.\nThe agricultural sector is one of\
    \ the most important economic resources in these countries\nadding to the importance\
    \ of managing well the available water resources to ensure the continuing\nof\
    \ this economical sector. In India, 10% of the area of the country is covered\
    \ by rice plantations [3].\nFurthermore, 20% of the Indian population is below\
    \ poverty levels and 15% is food insecure. Therefore,\nlow food production aﬀects\
    \ both the population and the economy. In 2002, the monsoon season\nproduced the\
    \ least amount of precipitation in the last 130 years. That resulted in a loss\
    \ of rice production\ndue to the lack of fresh water. To determine the drought\
    \ caused by anomalies in surface water, the\nStandardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration\
    \ Index (SPEI) was utilized. These indexes and the\ninformation gathered from\
    \ sensors that monitor the environment, the soil and the water can be utilized\n\
    to determine the current state of the water and the possibility of covering all\
    \ the freshwater needs.\nCountries with higher funds are already implementing\
    \ systems for water management and water\nreuse aiming to optimize water usage\
    \ and reduce the environmental impact caused by utilizing great\namounts of water.\
    \ However, some countries may ﬁnd these solutions to be costly.\nCommercial sensors\
    \ for systems aimed for agriculture and its irrigation are very expensive,\nmaking\
    \ it impossible for smaller farmers to implement this type of system on their\
    \ farms. However,\nmanufacturers are currently oﬀering low-cost sensors that can\
    \ be connected to nodes to implement\nlow-cost systems for irrigation management\
    \ and agriculture monitoring. Furthermore, due to the\ninterest in low-cost sensors\
    \ for monitoring agriculture and water, new low-cost sensors are being\nproposed\
    \ in researches such as a leaf water stress monitoring sensor [4], a multi-level\
    \ soil moisture\nsensor comprised of copper rings placed along a PVC pipe [5],\
    \ a water salinity monitoring sensor\nmade with copper coils [6] or a water turbidity\
    \ sensor made with colored and infrared led emitters\nand receptors [7].\nDue\
    \ to the recent advances in sensors for the implementation of irrigation systems\
    \ for agriculture\nand the evolution of WSN and IoT technologies that can be applied\
    \ in the development of these\nsystems, we present a survey aimed at summarizing\
    \ the current state of the art regarding smart\nirrigation systems. In this survey,\
    \ we are going to provide an overview of the state of the research\nregarding\
    \ irrigation systems. We will determine the parameters that are monitored in irrigation\n\
    systems regarding water quantity and quality, soil characteristics, weather conditions,\
    \ and fertilizer\nusage. We will provide an overview of the most utilized nodes\
    \ and wireless technologies employed to\nimplement WSN and IoT based smart irrigation\
    \ systems. Lastly, we will discuss the challenges and the\nbest practices for\
    \ the implementation of sensor-based irrigation systems.\nOther authors have performed\
    \ studies with a focus on irrigation systems, water management\nor precision agriculture\
    \ systems. However, the other available surveys on smart irrigation systems\n\
    analyzed quite a few papers [8–12] and therefore do not provide an in-depth analysis\
    \ of the state\nof the art regarding irrigation systems. Others are focused on\
    \ speciﬁc aspects regarding irrigation\nsuch as software for irrigation systems\
    \ [13], pivot-center speciﬁc irrigation systems [14] or irrigation\nsystems for\
    \ greenhouses [15]. Lastly, there are surveys that focus on precision agriculture\
    \ [16–21], crop\nmonitoring [22] and the agro-industrial and environmental ﬁelds\
    \ of agriculture [23] that comment on\nirrigation agriculture. In this survey,\
    \ we provide an overview of the current advances in irrigation\nsystems and the\
    \ utilized sensors and actuators. Furthermore, we provide discuss the most utilized\n\
    nodes and the wireless technologies employed for the communication and transmission\
    \ of the data\ngathered by the sensors. This way, with this work we address the\
    \ current gap in literature with a\nsurvey that provides an overview of IoT-based\
    \ smart irrigation systems.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section\
    \ 2 presents the methodology employed to\nperform the survey. Section 3 presents\
    \ the water management techniques utilized in current studies, the\nparameters\
    \ that are utilized to determine the irrigation schedule and the related actuators.\
    \ The sensors\nand parameters considered for the soil monitoring aspects of the\
    \ evaluated smart irrigation systems\nare depicted in Section 4. The most monitored\
    \ weather parameters and the sensors that monitor\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n3 of\
    \ 48\nthem are presented in Section 5. Section 6 comments on the most utilized\
    \ nodes for IoT and WSN\nirrigation systems and the most popular wireless communication\
    \ technologies and cloud platforms.\nThe discussion of the current trends regarding\
    \ IoT crop irrigation systems is presented in Section 7.\nLastly, the conclusion\
    \ and future work are presented in Section 8.\n2. Materials and Methods\nIn this\
    \ section, the process followed to elaborate this paper is presented. To perform\
    \ this study,\nthe following research questions were considered: What are the\
    \ current IoT solutions for smart\nirrigation for agriculture? What sensors, actuators,\
    \ nodes, and wireless technologies are being utilized\nto develop IoT irrigation\
    \ systems? Search engines and digital libraries were utilized by the authors to\n\
    search manually for papers suitable for this survey. A total of 283 papers were\
    \ obtained from Google\nScholar [24], IEEE explore [25], Scopus [26] and the digital\
    \ library of Sensors [27]. The keywords\nemployed to obtain the total number of\
    \ papers to be analyzed were IoT irrigation, IoT irrigation system,\nand smart\
    \ irrigation. Furthermore, all papers were checked to ensure they included the\
    \ keywords\nirrigation or water and IoT or smart in their content.\nIn order to\
    \ discern which papers to use, only papers written in English were considered.\n\
    Furthermore, to observe the recent evolution in this ﬁeld, the selected papers\
    \ were published from\nthe years 2014 to 2019 (both years inclusive). Finally,\
    \ a total of 178 papers were utilized to compile\nthis review.\nAfter the selection\
    \ process, all papers were classiﬁed manually into IoT irrigation systems and\n\
    architecture, protocol and sensor proposals that were not used to create the ﬁgures\
    \ in this paper but\ndiscussed relevant information. The papers from the ﬁrst\
    \ group (160) were then analyzed to determine\nthe sensors and actuators that\
    \ were employed to develop the IoT irrigation system, the parameters\nthat were\
    \ monitored, the type of irrigation and agriculture, the type of node, the type\
    \ of wireless\ntechnology and data visualization technique that was utilized to\
    \ access the data and to manually\nchoose the actions of the irrigation system.\
    \ All the collected data has been then classiﬁed into diﬀerent\nsections and converted\
    \ into graphs and tables to provide a complete overview of the actual state of\
    \ the\nart regarding IoT irrigation systems.\nThe distribution of the papers regarding\
    \ the country of the ﬁrst author is presented in Figure 1.\nAs it can be seen,\
    \ the countries that investigate IoT systems for irrigation are countries where\
    \ agriculture\nis a major economic source. India is the country with the highest\
    \ number of papers with a total of\n92 papers, 57.5% of the total. China and Spain\
    \ are tied with seven papers each. Costa Rica, Ecuador,\nIndonesia Thailand, and\
    \ the USA have between three and six papers. The rest of the countries that\n\
    have investigated IoT systems for irrigation have one or two papers.\nIt is remarkable\
    \ that only one out of the ﬁve countries with the highest agricultural land area\n\
    (China, USA, Australia, Brazil, and Kazakhstan) is included in the top ﬁve countries\
    \ of our survey\nin terms of water management. India, which is the country with\
    \ the highest production of papers\nthat presents IoT systems for water management\
    \ is the 7th country in terms of agricultural land area.\nWith regard to the top\
    \ six countries, in terms of published papers with irrigation systems, three of\n\
    them (India, China, and Spain) have regions with high and moderate water scarcity\
    \ problems. Again,\nthere are some countries with regions aﬀected by water scarcity\
    \ that use irrigation systems in their\nagriculture and have published fewer papers\
    \ on irrigation systems like the USA. Nonetheless, it does\nnot mean that in these\
    \ countries no eﬀorts are done in order to reduce water use in agriculture. It\
    \ is\npossible that in these countries the major eﬀorts are done by enterprises\
    \ and their ﬁndings are directly\npatented and distributed in the marked. Most\
    \ of the papers are published by authors who come from\ndeveloping countries.\n\
    As per the number of papers per year of publication, see Figure 2, the interest\
    \ in this topic has\nbeen increasing over the years. The lower amount of papers\
    \ for 2019 is due to the year not being\nﬁnished when the selection process of\
    \ the papers was completed. Thus, not all the papers performed\nin 2019 had been\
    \ published.\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n4 of 48\n \nThe distribution of the papers\
    \ regarding the country of the first author is presented in Figure 1. \nAs it\
    \ can be seen, the countries that investigate IoT systems for irrigation are countries\
    \ where \nagriculture is a major economic source. India is the country with the\
    \ highest number of papers with \na total of 92 papers, 57.5% of the total. China\

    \ only one out of the five countries with the highest agricultural land area \n\
    (China, USA, Australia, Brazil, and Kazakhstan) is included in the top five countries\
    \ of our survey in \nterms of water management. India, which is the country with\
    \ the highest production of papers that \npresents IoT systems for water management\
    \ is the 7th country in terms of agricultural land area. With \nregard to the\
    \ top six countries, in terms of published papers with irrigation systems, three\
    \ of them \n(India, China, and Spain) have regions with high and moderate water\

    \ water scarcity that use irrigation systems in their \nagriculture and have published\
    \ fewer papers on irrigation systems like the USA. Nonetheless, it does \nnot\
    \ mean that in these countries no efforts are done in order to reduce water use\
    \ in agriculture. It is \npossible that in these countries the major efforts are\
    \ done by enterprises and their findings are directly \npatented and distributed\
    \ in the marked. Most of the papers are published by authors who come from \n\
    developing countries.  \nAs per the number of papers per year of publication,\
    \ see Figure 2, the interest in this topic has \nbeen increasing over the years.\
    \ The lower amount of papers for 2019 is due to the year not being \nfinished\
    \ when the selection process of the papers was completed. Thus, not all the papers\
    \ performed \nin 2019 had been published. \n \nFigure 2. Number of published papers\
    \ presenting IoT systems for irrigation per year. \n3. Water Management \nIn this\
    \ section, we present the information and analysis of papers that present different\
    \ \ntechniques for water management in the irrigation process. For this analysis,\
    \ we consider the papers \nthat include any sort of water pumping actuator as\
    \ an irrigation system. From a total of 178 evaluated \npapers, 107 of them present\
    \ an actuator for irrigation. After analyzing the 107 papers we discard the \n\
    ones that just offer partial information, a total of 89 papers are included in\
    \ this section.  \nIn the agriculture activities that use water inputs, also known\
    \ as irrigated agriculture, there are \ndifferent manners to distribute the water.\
    \ The different options present different efficiency and, in \nsome cases, a specific\
    \ manner should be used for a specific crop. The specific manners to irrigate\
    \ have \na great variety but we can divide them into the following categories:\
    \ Attending to the way of water \nis distributed we can consider: (i) flood irrigation,\
    \ (ii) spray irrigation, (iii) drip irrigation, and (iv) \nnebulizer irrigation.\
    \ Regarding the existence of sensing systems we can have: (i) irrigation without\
    \ \nany consideration, when the amount of water is not calculated or estimated,\
    \ (ii) scheduled irrigation, \nwhen the water is supplied according to the estimated\
    \ needs in a period of year, (iii) Ad hoc irrigation, \nwhen the amount of water\
    \ is calculated based on the sensors measurements. The vast majority of the \n\
    papers included in this section propose to use pumps and valves to distribute\
    \ the water in \nconjunction with sensors to measure environmental parameters\
    \ in order to calculate the water needs. \nFrom the 89 evaluated papers in this\
    \ section, 83 include clear information of the proposed irrigation \nsystem, the\
    \ other six only mention that they include actuators for irrigation, see Figure\
    \ 3. Those 83 \ninclude different levels of detail, there are 49 papers that only\
    \ indicate that there are motor/pumps in \nFigure 2. Number of published papers\
    \ presenting IoT systems for irrigation per year.\n3. Water Management\nIn this\
    \ section, we present the information and analysis of papers that present diﬀerent\
    \ techniques\nfor water management in the irrigation process. For this analysis,\
    \ we consider the papers that include\nany sort of water pumping actuator as an\
    \ irrigation system. From a total of 178 evaluated papers,\n107 of them present\
    \ an actuator for irrigation. After analyzing the 107 papers we discard the ones\
    \ that\njust oﬀer partial information, a total of 89 papers are included in this\
    \ section.\nIn the agriculture activities that use water inputs, also known as\
    \ irrigated agriculture, there\nare diﬀerent manners to distribute the water.\
    \ The diﬀerent options present diﬀerent eﬃciency and,\nin some cases, a speciﬁc\
    \ manner should be used for a speciﬁc crop. The speciﬁc manners to irrigate\n\
    have a great variety but we can divide them into the following categories: Attending\
    \ to the way\nof water is distributed we can consider: (i) ﬂood irrigation, (ii)\
    \ spray irrigation, (iii) drip irrigation,\nand (iv) nebulizer irrigation. Regarding\
    \ the existence of sensing systems we can have: (i) irrigation\nwithout any consideration,\
    \ when the amount of water is not calculated or estimated, (ii) scheduled\nirrigation,\
    \ when the water is supplied according to the estimated needs in a period of year,\
    \ (iii) Ad\nhoc irrigation, when the amount of water is calculated based on the\
    \ sensors measurements. The vast\nmajority of the papers included in this section\
    \ propose to use pumps and valves to distribute the water\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n\

    \ to calculate the water needs.\nFrom the 89 evaluated papers in this section,\
    \ 83 include clear information of the proposed irrigation\nsystem, the other six\
    \ only mention that they include actuators for irrigation, see Figure 3. Those\

    \ that there are motor/pumps in\ntheir system (40 paper) or valves (nine papers)\

    \ environments (air, water, soil or plant) have been\nmonitored in most papers.\
    \ This information is presented in Figure 5. A paper that monitored the soil\n\
    can measure one or more parameters, but this information is not included in Figure\
    \ 5. The environment\nthat has been monitored in more papers is the soil. It was\

    Following, the details about the number of monitored parameters are presented\
    \ (see Figure 6).\nFrom the 89 included papers, more than half of the proposals\
    \ measure between three and four\nparameters. Measuring fewer parameters (one\

    \ On the other hand, there are ﬁve\npapers (6% of cases) that do not measure any\
    \ parameter [33,41,77–79].\nNext, the details about the measured parameters are\
    \ shown. Regarding the sensors of soil, plants,\nand water (see Figure 7), the\
    \ most used sensor in the systems is the soil moisture sensor, it is used in 76\n\
    papers (more details in Section 4). First, we will analyze the data from soil\
    \ and plant sensors. The soil\ntemperature is much less considered in these systems,\
    \ it is only measured in seven proposals. Attending\nto the soil characteristics,\
    \ in one proposal the authors use a sensor that monitored the nutrients of the\n\
    soil [80]. There are 14 proposals of IoT for irrigation management that include\
    \ a pH sensor. However,\nnot all of them specify if the pH sensors are for the\
    \ soil or for the water [31,42,49,54,68,70,74,75,81,82],\nonly four of them indicate\
    \ this (three for soil [66,67,72] and one for water [69]). Only four papers\n\
    consider plant monitoring, in two papers the measured parameter is the plant height\
    \ [64,83], using an\nultrasound sensor. In the other two cases, the leaf wetness\
    \ was considered in their system [46,84,85].\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n7 of 48\n\
    Diﬀerent sensors are used, [84] used a sensor based on optical signals while [46]\
    \ utilized a commercial\nFC-37 sensor (Lydia Vogler, Peißenberg, Germany).\n \n\

    \ measure between three and four \nparameters. Measuring fewer parameters (one\
    \ or two) represents 31% of the cases (17% one \nparameter and 14% two parameters).\

    \ this (three for soil [66,67,72] and one \nfor water [69]). Only four papers\
    \ consider plant monitoring, in two papers the measured parameter \nis the plant\
    \ height [64,83], using an ultrasound sensor. In the other two cases, the leaf\
    \ wetness was \nconsidered in their system [46,84,85]. Different sensors are used,\
    \ [84] used a sensor based on optical \nsignals while [46] utilized a commercial\
    \ FC-37 sensor (Lydia Vogler, Peißenberg, Germany).  \nNow, the data from the\
    \ water sensor are presented. In this case, we will consider for the \ncommentaries\
    \ not only the data of the graphic (proposals with irrigation system) but also\
    \ the \ninformation of the paper which measures the water quality, having or not\
    \ the actuators for the \nirrigation system. The water level in the tanks is measured\
    \ in 17 [32,36,51,57,58,61,62,64,69,85–92] out \nof 88 papers that have a pumping\
    \ system. There are different methods to monitor the water level in \nthe tanks\
    \ and the most used is the one based on ultrasound [32,69,89], the resistive methodology\
    \ is \nused in one case [36], the rest of cases do not offer information of how\
    \ the data is measured. In the \ncase of sensors based on ultrasound methods,\
    \ the most utilized sensor is the HC-SR04 (Shenzhenshi \nguoyun dianzishangwu\
    \ youxiangongsi , Shenzhen, China, used in [69]). In addition, there are six \n\
    papers that do not include an actuator for the irrigation system even when they\
    \ have water level \nsensors [60,93–97]. There are nine papers where sensors for\
    \ monitoring water flow are utilized \n[14,31,42,45,50,64,75,76,82]. The sensors\
    \ used are only described in two cases, the commercial Gems \nFT110 G3/8 sensor\
    \ (Gems Sensors and Controls, Mumbai, India) is used in [75] and the YF-S402 \n\
    (Wuhan yingying yingying xinxi jishu youxian gongsi , Wuhan, China) in the proposal\
    \ presented in \n[76]. Both sensors are based on a Hall effect turbine. They have\
    \ different prices and similar \noperational ranges. The Gems FT110 G3/8 can measure\
    \ flows between 0.5 to 5 L/min. The other \nsensor, the YF-S402, is capable of\
    \ measuring flows between 0.3 to 6 L/min. Moreover, water flow \nsensors are used\
    \ in three other proposals that do not include actuators for irrigation systems\
    \ [5,98,99]. \nRegarding water quality, the water conductivity is monitored in\
    \ four proposals [51,68,69,75]. Only in \none case [75], the authors indicate\
    \ the used sensor. They use commercial sensors for monitoring pH \nand conductivity\
    \ from B&C Electronics (Carnate , Italy). \n  \nFigure 7. Monitored parameters\

    \ \nAdditionally, there are two papers without an actuator for irrigation systems\
    \ that include in \ntheir proposals a sensor for conductivity [98,100]. Nevertheless,\

    \ In this case, we will consider for the\ncommentaries not only the data of the\
    \ graphic (proposals with irrigation system) but also the\ninformation of the\
    \ paper which measures the water quality, having or not the actuators for the\
    \ irrigation\nsystem. The water level in the tanks is measured in 17 [32,36,51,57,58,61,62,64,69,85–92]\
    \ out of 88 papers\nthat have a pumping system. There are diﬀerent methods to\
    \ monitor the water level in the tanks\nand the most used is the one based on\
    \ ultrasound [32,69,89], the resistive methodology is used in\none case [36],\
    \ the rest of cases do not oﬀer information of how the data is measured. In the\
    \ case of\nsensors based on ultrasound methods, the most utilized sensor is the\
    \ HC-SR04 (Shenzhenshi guoyun\ndianzishangwu youxiangongsi, Shenzhen, China, used\
    \ in [69]). In addition, there are six papers that\ndo not include an actuator\
    \ for the irrigation system even when they have water level sensors [60,93–97].\n\
    There are nine papers where sensors for monitoring water ﬂow are utilized [14,31,42,45,50,64,75,76,82].\n\
    The sensors used are only described in two cases, the commercial Gems FT110 G3/8\
    \ sensor (Gems\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n8 of 48\nSensors and Controls, Mumbai,\
    \ India) is used in [75] and the YF-S402 (Wuhan yingying yingying xinxi\njishu\
    \ youxian gongsi, Wuhan, China) in the proposal presented in [76]. Both sensors\
    \ are based on a\nHall eﬀect turbine. They have diﬀerent prices and similar operational\
    \ ranges. The Gems FT110 G3/8\ncan measure ﬂows between 0.5 to 5 L/min. The other\
    \ sensor, the YF-S402, is capable of measuring\nﬂows between 0.3 to 6 L/min. Moreover,\
    \ water ﬂow sensors are used in three other proposals that do\nnot include actuators\
    \ for irrigation systems [5,98,99]. Regarding water quality, the water conductivity\n\
    is monitored in four proposals [51,68,69,75]. Only in one case [75], the authors\
    \ indicate the used\nsensor. They use commercial sensors for monitoring pH and\
    \ conductivity from B&C Electronics\n(Carnate, Italy).\nAdditionally, there are\
    \ two papers without an actuator for irrigation systems that include in their\n\
    proposals a sensor for conductivity [98,100]. Nevertheless, no data regarding\

    \ It is generally used as an alarm for the\nfarmers or as a dissuasive measure\

    \ \nonly the papers that include an irrigation system, the most used actuator\
    \ in the different irrigation \nsystems. Therefore, we do not include the use\
    \ of irrigation actuators in Figure 10. The most utilized \nactuator is the sound\

    Most of those proposals use similar sensors based on the conductivity between\
    \ two electrodes.\nDiﬀerent models of the aforementioned sensor have been used\
    \ in the proposals (see Figure 13). The most\nused sensor, based on conductivity,\
    \ is the YL69 (SparkFun Electronics, Niwot, CO, USA). It has been\nused in nine\
    \ proposals [44,56,71,87,95,115–118]. This sensor is characterized by a low price\
    \ and it is\ncreated speciﬁcally to operate with Arduino (and similar nodes).\
    \ The output voltage goes from 3.3\nto 5 V and the output values are related to\
    \ soil moisture (0 to 300 for dry soil, 300 to 700 humid soil).\nNevertheless,\
    \ it is not possible to have a measure that indicates exactly the value of moisture\
    \ without\nperforming new tests and calibration of the sensor. The same range\
    \ of measure is found in the other\nused sensor based on the same principle, the\
    \ FC-28 (Uruktech, Baghdad, Iraq, used in [34,72,76]) and\nthe SEN0114 (DFRobot,\
    \ Shanghai, China, used in [46]). The S-XNQ-04 sensor (XNQ Electric Company\n\
    Store, Beijing, China), used in [55] has a similar operation principle. However,\
    \ it is composed of three\nelectrodes. In this case, the sensor output voltage\
    \ goes from 0 to 2 V and the sensor is capable of\nmeasuring the soil moisture\
    \ giving as a response the relative saturation moisture content expressed\nin\
    \ percentage (%). This sensor has an accuracy of 3% and it can measure from 0\
    \ to 100% of relative\nsaturation. It can operate from −40 to 85 ◦C.\nSensors\

    \ moisture sensors. \nIn terms of sensors for soil nutrients, three papers include\
    \ in their proposals sensors for \nmonitoring this variable [5,80,102]; nonetheless,\

    \ These sensors can be used from 40 ◦C to\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n12 of 48\n\
    85 ◦C, but the accuracy and operational range of the sensor probe are not indicated\
    \ in its datasheet.\nThe operational principle of this sensor is based on the\
    \ measurement of the dielectric constant of the\nsoil using transmission line\
    \ techniques to measure the moisture in any type of soil notwithstanding\nsoil\
    \ salinity. The output voltage of this sensor goes from 0 to 3 V. This output\
    \ voltage is related to\nthe volumetric water content in the soil. The sensor\
    \ does not oﬀer a linear relationship between the\noutput voltage and the volumetric\
    \ water content, but the sensor can measure from 0 to up to 60% of\nvolumetric\
    \ water content in the soil. This sensor has a relatively low price and can be\
    \ implemented in\nArduino systems (and similar).\nA sensor with completely different\
    \ operational principles, the 200SS (HYPERION TECHNOLOGIES\nB.V., Delft, The Netherlands),\
    \ is used in two proposals [14,121].\nIt is a solid-state electrical\nresistance\
    \ sensing device that is used to measure soil water tension.\nThe 200SS has a\
    \ pair of\nhighly corrosion-resistant electrodes, as a resistive device, the resistance\
    \ of the sensor changes with the\nsoil moisture. The electrodes are embedded within\
    \ a granular matrix. The output values of the sensor\ngo from 0 to 199 centibars.\
    \ The higher the value of centibars the lower the water availability for the\n\
    plants. The system presented in [54] uses an SM300 sensor. This device is able\
    \ to measure two soil\nparameters (moisture and temperature). The SM300 measures\
    \ the soil moisture and temperature based\non the generation and propagation of\
    \ the electromagnetic ﬁeld into the soil. The sensors measure\nthe soil moisture\
    \ as the volumetric water content, the operating range goes from 0 to 100% and\
    \ the\naccuracy is ±2.5%. This sensor is manufactured by Delta-T Devices Ltd.\
    \ (Cambridge, UK). This sensor\nis not speciﬁcally created to be integrated in\
    \ an Arduino measuring system, even though it can be\nadapted since the output\
    \ voltage goes from 0 to 1 V.\nFinally, the system detailed in [122] used the\
    \ HA2002 sensor, but no information is available\non the internet about this sensor\
    \ in terms of operational principle nor range of measuring. The sole\ninformation\
    \ that was found was that the sensor is an HA2001 sensor manufactured by Handan\
    \ Dingrui\nElectronics Co., Ltd. (Handan, China).\nRegarding the sensors used\
    \ for monitoring the soil temperature, which are mentioned in [37,40,\n45,54,63,67,94,122,123],\
    \ the diﬀerent sensors are detailed in this paragraph. There are ﬁve papers that\n\
    do not specify the sensors used [45,63,67,94,123]. The other four proposals indicate\
    \ in the paper the\nsensors selected. Although in one paper no information could\
    \ be found about the sensor utilized [122],\nthe authors indicate that their system\
    \ includes the HA2001 sensor.\nIn other cases, the information of the selected\
    \ sensors is detailed. The proposal presented in [54]\nused an LM35 sensor. This\
    \ device is able to measure temperature. The operating range is −40 to\n+125 ◦C\
    \ and the accuracy is ±0.5 ◦C. The sensors oﬀer an analogic signal and it is manufactured\
    \ by\nTexas Instruments (Dallas, TX, USA). The proposals presented in [37,40]\
    \ selected the THERM200\n(Vegetronix, Inc., Riverton, UT, USA) to measure the\
    \ temperature. The operational range of these\nsensors goes from −40 ◦C to 85\
    \ ◦C and its accuracy is ±0.5 ◦C. The operation principle of this sensor is\n\
    not speciﬁed in the datasheet.\nIn terms of sensors for soil nutrients, three\
    \ papers include in their proposals sensors for monitoring\nthis variable [5,80,102];\
    \ nonetheless, not all of them indicate the used sensor. The only paper that\n\
    clearly indicates the utilized sensor is the proposal presented in [80] includes\
    \ an 1185 SunRom\ncolor sensor (Sunrom Electronics, Ahmedabad, India). This sensor\
    \ is based on RGB color detection,\nin [80] authors relate the color of the soil\
    \ with the nutrients. The pH of the soil is measured in four\nproposals [66,67,72,110].\
    \ However, none of these proposals indicates the selected device or equipment\n\
    in the paper.\n5. Weather Monitoring\nAn overview of the weather parameters monitored\
    \ in IoT irrigation monitoring systems and the\nmost utilized sensors to monitor\

    \ as the\nthermic level of the atmosphere and is usually measured in Celsius,\
    \ Fahrenheit or Kelvin degrees.\nIt is the most monitored weather parameter with\
    \ one hundred papers monitoring it. Humidity is the\npresence of water vapor in\

    It is the second most monitored weather parameter with 86 papers. Furthermore,\

    \ or commercial sensors that can be found in professional weather\nstations. The\
    \ MQ135 [64,143], used for benzene, alcohol, smoke, NH3, NOx and CO2 monitoring,\
    \ and\nthe MQ2 [64,95], used for gas monitoring (propane, hydrogen, and LPG),\
    \ are the most utilized low-cost\nsensors for air quality monitoring. The MQ131\
    \ is utilized for ozone, Cl2, NO2 monitoring [64] and\nthe MQ9 is utilized for\
    \ CO/combustible gas, methane, carbon monoxide and LPG monitoring [64].\nAnother\
    \ sensor that can be used to monitor CO2 is the CDM4161A (Toshniwal Sensing Device\
    \ Private\nLimited, Ajmer, India) [145].\nWind speed and direction may be of interest\
    \ to IoT irrigation systems such as for the proposal\nin [46], that utilized the\
    \ SEN-08942 sensor manufactured by Sparkfun. Barometric pressure can be of\ninterest\
    \ as well and can be measured by the BME280 sensor manufactured by Bosch [157].\n\
    Movement detection is often related to security measures or to the aim of scaring\
    \ animals to\navoid crop damage. The most utilized sensor for movement detection\
    \ is a passive infrared (PIR)\nsensor [42,95]. This sensor measures the infrared\
    \ light that radiates around the objects placed at the\nfront of the sensor. The\
    \ change in infrared radiation is converted into changes in voltage that trigger\n\
    the detection. It is often utilized for intrusion and pest detection. Ultrasonic\
    \ sensors are often utilized\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n18 of 48\nto detect movement,\
    \ such as the robot proposed in [65] that is able to perform some actions to scare\
    \ the\nanimals that may enter the ﬁelds. These sensors are comprised of a transmitter\
    \ and a receiver that\noperate at the 40 kHz frequency. Its range is from 10 cm\
    \ to 30 cm. Ultrasound at lower frequencies was\nutilized in [60] to repel the\
    \ animals. Insects may cause great damage to the crops, for that reason some\n\
    systems such as [45] include a pest warning functionality. The system in [133]\
    \ is able to even detect the\ntype of insect pests that are damaging the crops.\
    \ These features are often accompanied by a buzzer to\ngenerate an alarm when\
    \ intruders or animals are detected [61].\nDepending on the type of agriculture,\
    \ the values from the measures for each environmental\nparameter can be utilized\
    \ to determine the actions of diﬀerent types of actuators. It can be part of a\n\
    model like the one proposed in [72] where the on-agriculture stage gathers the\
    \ data on temperature,\nhumidity, light, moisture and wind speed in order to activate\
    \ or deactivate fans, artiﬁcial light, a cooler\nand water pumps. Many IoT irrigation\
    \ systems have both a manual and an automatic mode to control\nirrigation. In\
    \ [64], the amount of water released by the water pumps or the duration of the\
    \ irrigation\ncan be selected in the manual mode. For the automatic mode, a preset\
    \ value is utilized at the beginning.\nThen, the data is analyzed to determine\
    \ the personalized settings. The most utilized actuators to\nmodify the conditions\
    \ of the climate that aﬀects the crops or to protect the crops from animals and\n\
    intruders are presented in Figure 20.\nSensors 2020, 20, x \n18 of 48 \n \nFigure\

    \ two types depending on the purpose of\nthe IoT devices. On the one hand, we\
    \ can distinguish the devices that function as nodes that transmit\nsmall amounts\
    \ of data at short distances and have low energy consumption. On the other hand,\n\
    there are devices that can transmit large amounts of data over long distances\
    \ that have high energy\nconsumption. Therefore, range, data rate, and energy\
    \ consumption are some of the most important\naspects to consider when deciding\
    \ which technology to use.\nIf the utilized standard is considered, there are\
    \ a large number of wireless standards that are used\nin the communications of\
    \ IoT devices. A general classiﬁcation can be established between devices\nthat\
    \ communicate at short or long distances. Short distance communication standards\
    \ usually reach\ndistances of up to 100 m. Long-distance communication standards\
    \ reach distances of kilometers.\nAlso, another type of classiﬁcation can be established\
    \ based on the employed communication\ntechnology. In this way, three categories\
    \ can be established. The ﬁrst category is formed by those that\nconnect utilizing\
    \ Ethernet or cable and WAN technology. The second category is comprised of those\n\
    that connect via WiFi and WAN technology. Finally, the third category is formed\
    \ by those that connect\nusing both low power WiFi and WAN technology.\nIf the\
    \ spectrum band used is considered, we can classify them into technologies that\
    \ use the\nunlicensed spectrum or the licensed spectrum. Unlicensed spectrum bands\
    \ are known as Industrial,\nScientiﬁc, and Medical (ISM radio band bands, and\
    \ are deﬁned by article 1.15 of the International\nTelecommunication Union’s (ITU)\
    \ ITU Radio Regulations (RR) [184]. The ISM bands can vary according\nto the region\
    \ and its permits. Its main advantage is its ease of installation and the main\
    \ drawbacks are\nrelated to safety deﬁciencies and possible interferences. The\
    \ licensed spectrum bands are assigned\naccording to the diﬀerent proprietary\
    \ technologies. They oﬀer greater security, greater coverage, and\nfewer interferences.\
    \ However, the cost of using a licensed band is higher.\nThe most utilized communication\
    \ technologies among the reviewed papers are presented in\nTable 6. In many of\
    \ the proposals that we have studied, the authors combine several communication\n\
    technologies instead of using one single protocol. As an example, it is very common\
    \ for authors to\nstart using either a wired or a wireless technology to connect\
    \ the sensors with the nodes, and then, use\na wireless technology to send data\
    \ from nodes to remote or cloud storage centers.\nTable 6. Most utilized communication\

    \ be seen in Figure 26, a large percentage of the authors, more than 50%, have\
    \ not defined the \nstorage system they have used, there are 79 other papers where\
    \ the storage system used is not \nspecified.  \n \nFigure 26. Number of papers\
    \ per storage system. \nTo be able to provide the new services that are currently\
    \ demanded in IoT, it is necessary to use \nmiddleware. Through middleware, it\
    \ is possible to connect programs that initially had not been \ndeveloped to be\
    \ connected to each other. Bandyopadhyay et al. [199] presented a classification\
    \ of the \nIoT-middleware, based on the various features and interface protocol\
    \ support. One of the reasons \nwhy middleware is needed to connect IoT devices,\

    \ advantage of existing middleware using it on different cloud platforms. \nWhen\
    \ we talk about the cloud, we identify a place where data, which is collected\

    \ In most of the articles, it is \nindicated that the data is processed in the\
    \ cloud itself, and the end-users view all the information by \nconnecting to\
    \ the cloud. Cloud storage has been done on different platforms as it can be seen\
    \ in Figure \n27. In 24 of the reviewed articles, the authors specified that they\
    \ store the monitored data in the cloud, \nbut do not identify the utilized cloud\

    \ 2020, 20, 1042\n30 of 48\n7. Discussion\nIn this section, current trends regarding\
    \ IoT irrigation systems for agriculture are going to\nbe presented.\n7.1. Big\
    \ Data Management and Analytics for Irrigation Optimization\nIoT systems, in general,\
    \ generate a great amount of data due to monitoring diﬀerent parameters\nin real-time,\
    \ and IoT irrigation systems generate big data as well. Therefore, it is necessary\
    \ to provide\nmechanisms to manage and analyze big data. Ahad et al. [202] comment\
    \ on the need for sustainable\nmanagement of big data to avoid overusing natural\
    \ resources. Using blockchain, powering IoT devices\nwith solar energy, selecting\
    \ useful data and discarding unnecessary and redundant data, employing\nclustering\
    \ techniques to reduce the volume of the information, implementing time-eﬃcient\
    \ algorithms\nand the utilization of sustainable resources as alternatives to\
    \ the components that are employed\nnowadays are some of the suggestions they\
    \ provide.\nAlthough the data gathered from the sensors is already a big source\
    \ of information, the analysis\nof this data is paramount to optimize the IoT\
    \ irrigation system according to the crop and the weather\nconditions. For this\
    \ purpose, Tseng et al. [203] presented a big data analysis algorithm to aid farmers\n\
    in the crop selection process. Their proposal satisﬁed the ﬁve Vs (volume, velocity,\
    \ variety, veracity,\nand value) of big data. They performed a 3D correlation\
    \ analysis that evaluated the irrigation cycle to\nidentify the irrigation practices\
    \ performed by the farmer. Then, they calculated the soil moisture content\nto\
    \ detect irrigation and to evaluate if the farmer applied pesticides or fertilizers.\
    \ This information was\ncoupled with data on the weather conditions and other\
    \ aspects of the soil to provide the farmer with\nthe cultivation risks of each\
    \ type of crop. Nonetheless, there are other technologies that are currently\n\
    being utilized to analyze the big data produced by IoT irrigation systems for\
    \ agriculture.\nArtiﬁcial intelligence (AI) is currently the type of technology\
    \ most companies are interested in for\nvarious purposes. In the case of irrigation,\
    \ the use of AI is tied to the optimization of the available\nresources such as\
    \ water, fertilizers or energy or to obtain information from the crops such as\
    \ the\npresence of diseases or the correct growth of the plants, vegetables, and\
    \ fruits. One of the techniques\nemployed to analyze the data gathered from the\
    \ sensors so as to perform decisions on the irrigation\nsystems is fuzzy logic.\
    \ Fuzzy logic has been employed to improve irrigation scheduling in greenhouses\n\
    and control the drainage implementing it on the controller of the system [100].\
    \ The fuzzy rules were\nprovided according to the water availability utilizing\
    \ the QtFuzzyLite software ((FuzzyLite Limited,\nWellington, New Zealand). Another\
    \ fuzzy logic controller is employed to determine the coverage\nerror for the\
    \ resources so as to determine if the eﬀective watering of the plants can be guaranteed\
    \ [96].\nThe system presented in [136] utilized fuzzy logic to determine the duration\
    \ of the irrigation process\nonce the soil moisture values go below the 20% threshold.\
    \ Light and temperature lead to the least\naccuracy in irrigation (40%) whereas\
    \ any combination with the soil moisture values reached an accuracy\nfrom 62 to\
    \ 81%. The authors conclude that the subsoil moisture sensor is the most important\
    \ sensor to\ndetermine irrigation. The irrigation time was predicted in [162]\
    \ as well, using the adaptive neuro fuzzy\ninterference system (ANFIS) to predict\
    \ the irrigation time. This fuzzy logic technique was implemented\nemploying the\
    \ MATLAB software. However, outdoor temperature and light are important to avoid\
    \ the\nevaporation of the water. Another irrigation system utilizes iterative\
    \ learning control (ILC) arithmetic\nto make decisions regarding the opening of\
    \ the water valves [67].\nMachine learning is another technique that is utilized\
    \ in irrigation systems to perform predictions.\nThe prediction algorithm in [120]\
    \ for soil moisture prediction obtained an accuracy of 96%. Prediction\ntechniques\
    \ can also be utilized to estimate the amount of available water for irrigation\
    \ such as the case\nof [119], where the authors employ Fisher’s LDA method for\
    \ that purpose. Water usage is predicted as\nwell in [50] employing regression\
    \ algorithms. The regression algorithms consider the temperature of\nthe environment\
    \ and the water ﬂow to produce a water consumption forecast that is then visualized\n\
    by the user through a mobile app.\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n31 of 48\nFeedforward\
    \ neural networks and the structural similarity index were employed in [204] to\n\
    develop an optimized smart irrigation system. The authors compared gradient descent\
    \ and variable\nlearning rate gradient descent optimization techniques to predict\
    \ soil moisture and they determined\nthat the latter was the best one. Furthermore,\
    \ a study on machine learning applied to agriculture so as\nto perform predictions\
    \ on irrigation was performed in [205]. Diﬀerent machine learning techniques\n\
    were applied to the data on the soil and the environment collected from jojoba\
    \ plantations. The authors\nconclude that the boosted tree classiﬁer was the best\
    \ classiﬁcation model was and the gradient boosted\nregression trees was the best\
    \ regression model. They had a 95% and 93% accuracy respectively.\nThe authors\
    \ suggest as well that diﬀerent feature-sets would be better for diﬀerent plots\
    \ as some\nconﬁgurations achieved better results for diﬀerent types of plots such\
    \ as organic ones. Furthermore, the\nmodels considerably reduced their accuracy\
    \ when deliberated soil drying was performed. Moreover,\nthe authors state that\
    \ the data on the weather and the saturation could be not considered without it\n\
    substantially aﬀecting the accuracy of the models.\n7.2. Low-Cost Autonomous Sensors\n\
    As we have seen in Section 2, the majority of the countries that dedicate more\
    \ eﬀort to researching\nIoT irrigation systems are countries where the farmers\
    \ cannot aﬀord commercial solutions. Therefore,\nmost of the solutions for irrigation\
    \ management are comprised of low-cost sensors and controllers so\nas to increase\
    \ the scope of the beneﬁts of utilizing smart irrigation systems. Apart from individual\n\
    sensors, some shields integrate several sensors and connectors for irrigation\
    \ and agriculture speciﬁc\nIoT systems such as the OpenGarden shield ((Libelium\
    \ Comunicaciones Distribuidas S.L., Zaragoza,\nSpain) [136]. It can be connected\
    \ to an Arduino UNO and it is comprised of an LDR, a DHT22 connector\n(SparkFun\
    \ Electronics, Niwot, CO, USA), a soil moisture connector, a hydroponics connector,\
    \ digital\nand analog pins, a DS18B20 connector (Adafruit Industries, New York,\
    \ NY, USA) and an antenna\nconnector. This type of solution allows the easy implementation\
    \ of low-cost smart irrigation systems.\n7.3. Sustainable Irrigation Systems\n\
    Most irrigation systems do not have access to the power grid, therefore there\
    \ is a need for\nalternative means of powering up the devices that conform the\
    \ system. Even irrigation systems with\naccess to the power grid may only receive\
    \ power during a constrained time period. In India, for\nexample, the system presented\
    \ in [29] determines when access to electricity is available to turn on\nthe irrigation\
    \ motors. This system was designed to help farmers when access to electricity\
    \ happens\nat irregular hours or even at night, when farmers may not be present\
    \ in the ﬁeld. To address the\nneed for alternative ways of powering the irrigation\
    \ systems in agricultural ﬁelds that are too far to\naccess the power grid, many\
    \ systems incorporate a solar energy functionality, making the system\nmore sustainable\
    \ [41]. Furthermore, the use of solar energy reduces the energetic costs which\
    \ is\nan advantage for irrigation systems intended for developing areas.\nConsidering\
    \ those reasons,\na total of 22 of the surveyed papers chose to utilize solar\
    \ energy to power their proposed irrigation\nsystem [4,38,41,46,50,56,63,66,69,88,90–92,96,99,101,140,145,171,178,181].\n\
    7.4. Frequency of the Data Acquisition\nThe frequency at which the parameters\
    \ are monitored may be diﬀerent for each proposal. Real-time\nmonitoring [31,71]\
    \ has been surging as the cost of the devices, whether they are processors, devices\n\
    for data storage or sensors, has experienced a considerable reduction. Some proposals\
    \ decide not to\nmonitor the parameters in real-time so as to reduce energy consumption.\
    \ Some authors have decided\nto take a measure every 10 s [58].\n7.5. New Forms\
    \ of Data Acquisition\nThe advances in technology as lead to new ways of obtaining\
    \ the data from the sensors deployed\nin the ﬁelds. One of the new ways of gathering\
    \ data from the sensor nodes is by utilizing drones [31].\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n\
    32 of 48\nDrones also allow obtaining new data that could not be obtained in other\
    \ ways such as aerial images\nof the ﬁelds.\nAnother new form of data acquisition\
    \ is the use of robots that can incorporate both sensors and\nactuators to perform\
    \ activities such as soil moisture sensing, weeding, spraying water or scaring\
    \ the\nanimals [65]. Robots can be utilized for the irrigation of precise areas\
    \ due to their ability to travel to\nthe desired location [38]. This robot is\
    \ able to measure soil moisture and include proximity sensors\nto avoid collisions.\
    \ The robot has a sprinkler system to irrigate the desired area. Furthermore,\
    \ the\nwireless robot in [66] is comprised of both environmental and soil monitoring\
    \ sensors and performs\ntasks such as water spraying, scaring animals and moving\
    \ through the ﬁeld. In order to improve the\nnavigation of the robots for irrigation,\
    \ the authors in [55] provided the robot with a coverage path\nplanning (CPP)\
    \ algorithm that has a map of the static elements and environmental data. The\
    \ robot\noperating system (ROS) was utilized to develop the control system of\
    \ the robot which is divided into\nthree layers. The ﬁrst layer reads the data\
    \ from the sensors and controls the actuators, the second\nlayer performs the\
    \ communication among the elements of the system and the third layer performs\
    \ the\ndecision making and the path planning. This robot performs irrigation as\
    \ a linear shower. Furthermore,\nthese robots can be powered by solar panels [38,66]\
    \ to provide them with more autonomy.\n7.6. Security in IoT Systems for Irrigation\n\
    Depending on the characteristics of the environment where the implementation of\
    \ the IoT system\nis carried out, securing the system may become a challenging\
    \ task as diﬀerent types of threats must be\nconsidered. On the one hand, all\
    \ the security issues of any IoT system can be applied to an IoT irrigation\n\
    system for agriculture. Therefore, current works with their focus on securing\
    \ IoT describes the security\nchallenges that IoT irrigation systems may face.\
    \ For example, organizations such as the Internet\nEngineering Task Force (IETF)\
    \ study the diﬀerent problems that aﬀect this. Furthermore, authors\nsuch as Garcia-Morchon\
    \ et al. [206] present in their work the following list of security threats and\n\
    managing risks: vulnerable software/code, privacy threats, cloning of things,\
    \ malicious substitution\nof things, eavesdropping attacks, man-in-the-middle\
    \ attack, ﬁrmware attacks, extraction of private\ninformation, routing attack,\
    \ elevation of privilege, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Regarding DoS\nattacks,\
    \ Kamienski et al. [50] highly stressed the importance of protecting the irrigation\
    \ system from\nDoS attacks or avoiding attackers from accessing the collected\
    \ data or the system with the intention of\ndamaging the crops.\nIn order to face\
    \ the above threats, it is necessary to apply the appropriate security measures,\
    \ but\nas new threats and attacks appear daily, [206] propose using methodologies\
    \ such as analyzing the\nbusiness impact of the attack, assessing the threats\
    \ considering their impact and probability, its impact\non the privacy of the\
    \ collected information and the process of reporting and mitigating incidents.\n\
    However, on the other hand, when considering just the currently available studies\
    \ on securing\nIoT irrigation systems speciﬁcally, it is possible to discern which\
    \ aspects of IoT security are prioritized\nfor this type of system.\nJimenez et\
    \ al. [207] identiﬁed the security threats speciﬁc to an intelligent wastewater\
    \ puriﬁcation\nsystem for irrigation. Apart from the previously mentioned security\
    \ threats [206], the authors of [207]\ncontemplate physical attacks that the IoT\
    \ deployment may face. The IoT devices must be protected\nfrom the weather and\
    \ possible animals that access the ﬁelds. However, strong weather conditions\n\
    such as ﬂoods or animals such as wilds boars may result in the IoT device being\
    \ damaged or lost.\nFurthermore, the IoT devices may also be damaged by the operators\
    \ when they are performing their\nactivities or be the aim of a person with malicious\
    \ intentions. Another threat to the devices deployed\non the ﬁeld is the possibility\
    \ of them being replaced to malicious nodes, providing the attacker with\naccess\
    \ to the network [29]. The deployed devices may also be susceptible to malicious\
    \ code and false\ndata injection, leading to wrong results and the malfunction\
    \ of the system. Sleep deprivation attacks\nare aimed at depleting the battery\
    \ of the devices. The deployed nodes are susceptible to booting attacks\nas well.\
    \ Furthermore, attackers may also perform eavesdropping and interfere with the\
    \ deployed\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n33 of 48\ndevices. The concern of securing\
    \ the physical devices deployed on the ﬁelds has led to many systems\nincorporating\
    \ PIR sensors, scarecrows, and buzzers to detect intruders, either humans or animals,\
    \ and\nto alert of their presence [59,208].\nPrivacy is another aspect to consider.\
    \ The data managed by IoT irrigation systems may not need as\nmuch privacy as\
    \ the data managed by other IoT applications such as those for health. In fact,\
    \ Jimenez\net al. [207] remark that it may not be necessary for the gathered data\
    \ of some irrigation IoT systems to\nremain private, but the correct performance\
    \ of the system must be ensured, which is avoiding DoS\nattacks. However, the\
    \ owners of the ﬁelds may be implementing new techniques they would prefer to\n\
    remain private or the water quality management system could be regarded as a critical\
    \ infrastructure\nas the produce that results from the ﬁelds irrigated with that\
    \ water would be consumed by people.\nTherefore, considering this aspect, Ahad\
    \ et al. [202] and Barreto et al. [209] remark the need for user\nprivacy, as\
    \ the obtention of this information may lead to attacks to the owner or the personnel\
    \ of the\nfarm. Ahad et al. [202] consider data and device privacy as well, because\
    \ of the need for guaranteeing\nthe ownership of the data to avoid repudiation\
    \ and ensuring data availability. Barreto et al. [209]\nremark on the burden that\
    \ could be originated from the exposure of the GPS locational data captured\n\
    by IoT devices as attackers may gain information on the location of the farm to\
    \ perform physical attacks.\nLastly, Ahad et al. [202] also comment on the need\
    \ for a secure storage system for the information,\nwith particular emphasis on\
    \ distributed data storage systems. Attacks such as SQL injections can lead\n\
    to the obtention of private information from storage systems [210].\nAs cloud\
    \ computing often goes hand in hand with IoT systems, threats to cloud services\
    \ may\ncompromise the IoT irrigation system as well. Flooding attacks and cloud\
    \ malware injection are some\nof the attacks that can be intentionally executed\
    \ to compromise the data and the performance of the\ncloud [210].\nRansomware\
    \ is another security threat that could aﬀect irrigation systems for agriculture\
    \ [209].\nAll the data regarding pesticides and the fertigation system could be\
    \ encrypted until a ransom is paid.\nFor this reason, having a back-up in a remote\
    \ location is greatly advised.\nBarreto et al. [209] also remark some security\
    \ threats that are not usually commented on when\ndiscussing the security of IoT\
    \ systems for agriculture. One of these threats is the damage that can be\ncaused\
    \ by social engineering as the users of the IoT irrigation system could provide\
    \ login information\nto people posing as technicians or click on malicious links\
    \ on their e-mails. The other threats are\nagroterrorism, cyber-espionage, mostly\
    \ related to accessing intellectual property or conﬁdential\ninformation regarding\
    \ aspects such as genetically modiﬁed crops.\nBlockchain is a new technique that\
    \ is being applied to secure IoT systems [210], which allows\nsecure data storage\
    \ and communication. In agriculture, it is mostly utilized to secure the supply\n\
    chain [211], although there are other proposals that use it to secure a greenhouse\
    \ [212] or to secure\nthe overall smart agriculture framework [213]. Regarding\
    \ IoT irrigation systems for agriculture,\nblockchain has been applied in [214]\
    \ to track and trace the information exchange of their proposed\nsmart watering\
    \ system.\n7.7. Common Architecture Designs for IoT Irrigation Systems for Agriculture\n\
    In this subsection, an overview of the most frequent architectures for these systems\
    \ is going to\nbe discussed.\nMulti-agent architectures are popular in IoT solutions\
    \ for irrigation management [175,180].\nThese types of architectures make a distinction\
    \ among the diﬀerent elements they are comprised of.\nTypically, the distinction\
    \ is made according to the layer of the architecture the elements are encompassed\n\
    in. For example, nodes positioned higher in the hierarchy may act as a broker\
    \ for those lower in the\nhierarchy [175].\nMost architectures are divided into\
    \ layers or functional blocks that represent the main actions to\nbe carried out\
    \ [215]. These blocks or layers can be considered as generic and are utilized\
    \ in most of the\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n34 of 48\navailable architecture designs\
    \ for IoT systems intended for irrigation management. The main elements\nof these\
    \ architectures are devices, communications, services, management, applications,\
    \ and security.\nIoT systems are comprised of devices located in a certain environment\
    \ to perform multiple\nactivities such as detection, monitoring, control, and\
    \ action. The devices must have interfaces that allow\ntheir connection with other\
    \ devices to transmit the necessary information. The data obtained through\ndiﬀerent\
    \ sensors will generally be treated and their results will be applied to diﬀerent\
    \ actuators. Then, it\nis necessary to transmit the monitored data and response\
    \ actions between the devices. Communication\nprotocols are used for this task.\
    \ In most cases, diﬀerent communication protocols are used working\ntogether on\
    \ the same IoT system. In order to perform activities such as device discovery,\
    \ device control\nor the analysis of the collected data, the use of services may\
    \ be necessary as well. The applications allow\nthe interaction of the user with\
    \ the system. From the applications, the user will be able to visualize\nthe information,\
    \ both obtained by monitoring and that extracted from the data once they have\
    \ been\nprocessed. On many occasions, the user can execute the actions that he\
    \ considers appropriate to the\nsituation presented by the data, the actions can\
    \ also be carried out automatically. Lastly, providing\nsecurity to the system\
    \ may also be considered.\nTraditionally, the IoT architecture has been considered\
    \ to be divided into three layers, which are\nthe perception, network, and application\
    \ layer. Later on, an intermediate layer placed between the\nnetwork and application\
    \ layers has been introduced in multiple studies. This layer, called service layer,\n\
    is employed to store and process data using cloud and fog computing. For the last\
    \ few years, authors\nsuch as Ferrández-Pastor [216] presented a new architecture\
    \ proposal, based on four layers: things,\nedge, communication, and cloud. In\
    \ these latest architectural proposals, the authors use the edge layer\nto locate\
    \ critical applications and perform basic control processes. Also, as indicated\
    \ by [216], cloud\n(internet/intranet) can provide Web services, data storage,\
    \ HMI interfaces or analytic applications.\nFigure 29 shows an image where one\
    \ can see the architecture models.\nSensors 2020, 20, x \n34 of 48 \n \nelements\
    \ of these architectures are devices, communications, services, management, applications,\
    \ \nand security.  \nIoT systems are comprised of devices located in a certain\
    \ environment to perform multiple \nactivities such as detection, monitoring,\
    \ control, and action. The devices must have interfaces that \nallow their connection\
    \ with other devices to transmit the necessary information. The data obtained\
    \ \nthrough different sensors will generally be treated and their results will\
    \ be applied to different \nactuators. Then, it is necessary to transmit the monitored\
    \ data and response actions between the \ndevices. Communication protocols are\
    \ used for this task. In most cases, different communication \nprotocols are used\
    \ working together on the same IoT system. In order to perform activities such\
    \ as \ndevice discovery, device control or the analysis of the collected data,\
    \ the use of services may be \nnecessary as well. The applications allow the interaction\
    \ of the user with the system. From the \napplications, the user will be able\
    \ to visualize the information, both obtained by monitoring and that \nextracted\
    \ from the data once they have been processed. On many occasions, the user can\
    \ execute the \nactions that he considers appropriate to the situation presented\
    \ by the data, the actions can also be \ncarried out automatically. Lastly, providing\
    \ security to the system may also be considered.  \nTraditionally, the IoT architecture\
    \ has been considered to be divided into three layers, which are \nthe perception,\
    \ network, and application layer. Later on, an intermediate layer placed between\
    \ the \nnetwork and application layers has been introduced in multiple studies.\
    \ This layer, called service \nlayer, is employed to store and process data using\
    \ cloud and fog computing. For the last few years, \nauthors such as Ferrández-Pastor\
    \ [216] presented a new architecture proposal, based on four layers: \nthings,\

    \ reviewed IoT systems for irrigation, both 3-layered [46,83,118,217,218] and\
    \ 5-\nlayered architectures [180] are available. Commonly, the lower layer is\
    \ comprised of the sensor nodes \nand the actuators. The middle layer is comprised\
    \ of a gateway and contemplates data transmission. \nLastly, the third layer is\

    \ performed a study on wireless communication among above ground and \nunderground\
    \ devices. The path loss link between above ground and underground devices reached\
    \ -\n80 dBm for 50 m. The distance between underground devices reached approximately\

    \ for the Implementation of a Smart Irrigation System for Agriculture\nIn this\
    \ subsection, we present an architecture proposal for an IoT irrigation system\
    \ for irrigation.\nIn order to ensure the correct performance of the IoT irrigation\
    \ system for precision agriculture, the\narchitecture should provide interoperability,\
    \ scalability, security, availability, and resiliency.\nAfter having carried out\
    \ an exhaustive study of works presented by other researchers, our\narchitecture\
    \ proposal is divided into four layers that we deﬁne as devices, communication,\
    \ services,\nand application, as shown in Figure 30. Furthermore, the aspects\
    \ related to management and security\nshould be treated jointly between the communication\
    \ and services layers.\nSensors 2020, 20, x \n36 of 48 \n \nFigure 30. Architecture\
    \ proposal for an IoT irrigation system for agriculture. \n7.9. Future Challenges\
    \ of IoT Irrigation Systems \nThe Internet of Underground Things (IoUT) is a new\
    \ view of the IoT [221]. It consists of \ndeploying both underground and above\
    \ ground IoT devices that communicate among themselves \nwith underground-underground,\
    \ underground-above ground, and above ground-above ground \ncommunication. It\
    \ is especially useful and applicable to irrigation and precision agriculture\
    \ IoT \nsystems as the devices would not be impeding the work of machines and\
    \ farmers and it would reduce \nthe amount of physical damage the nodes deployed\
    \ on the fields may receive. Although WiFi \nsurprisingly allows underground-above\
    \ ground communication in short distances and depths above \n30 cm [222], it would\
    \ be necessary to study the performance of other existing protocols or even the\
    \ \ncreation of a new protocol that employs lower frequency bands to transmit\
    \ the information through \nthe soil medium.  \nThe use of LoRa is increasing\
    \ for irrigation and precision agriculture applications due to its long-\nrange,\
    \ which allows wireless communication to remote fields. However, the advances\
    \ in 5G may lead \nto a decrease in the interest in LoRa technology. On the one\
    \ hand, if the designed irrigation system \nproduces lower amounts of data, as\
    \ these types of systems present low variability in the data, LoRa \npresents\
    \ itself as a very good solution. However, on the other hand, for IoT systems\
    \ that require the \ntransmission of large amounts of data, 5G would solve the\
    \ problem of the limited amount of data \nthat LoRa can transmit. Considering\
    \ these aspects, a possible future is the use of LoRa and 5G hybrid \nwireless\
    \ networks to attempt in satisfying those needs [223]. \nThere are diverse opinions\
    \ on the existence and effects of climate change on earth. However, \nthere is\
    \ no doubt that many governments, companies and the citizens themselves are increasing\
    \ their \nawareness regarding sustainable consumption. This not only affects their\
    \ view on the energy \nconsumption of IoT systems for irrigation but also, the\
    \ origin of the components of the devices and \nthe impact of IoT devices on the\
    \ environment and the fauna of the area where they are deployed. \nTherefore,\
    \ the reduction in energy consumption and the use of alternative powering methods\
    \ will \ncontinue to be a research trend. Furthermore, it may be a challenge to\
    \ find new materials that are \nweather-resistant and do not increase severely\
    \ the cost of the devices, but the use of recyclable \nmaterials in some of the\
    \ elements of the IoT devices is to be expected [203]. \nAs it has further been\
    \ commented on Subsection 7 1 blockchain and AI will be incorporated into\nFigure\
    \ 30. Architecture proposal for an IoT irrigation system for agriculture.\nThe\
    \ ﬁrst layer is the Device layer, where all the devices that will perform the\
    \ functions of detection,\nmonitoring, control, and action are located. We would\
    \ have four types of nodes. The water monitoring\nnode would monitor water quality\
    \ to determine if the water is apt for the irrigation of the crops.\nThe soil\
    \ monitoring node would monitor soil moisture, soil temperature and other parameters\
    \ that\naid in the irrigation schedule decision process. The weather monitoring\
    \ node would measure air\ntemperature and humidity, precipitation, luminosity,\
    \ radiation, and wind parameters so as to aid in\nthe decision making process.\
    \ Lastly, the actuator nodes would perform the actions resulting from the\ndecision-making\
    \ process.\nThe second layer is the communication layer, comprised of three blocks.\
    \ The Hop-to-Hop\ncommunication block allows deﬁning data link layer technologies\
    \ and to transmit the frames that\ncontain the data of the device layer. From\
    \ this block the frames will be sent to the network communication\nblock, to reach\
    \ the remote locations. The routing function can be assumed in this block in mesh\n\
    networks, such as 802.15.4 networks. The end-to-end communication block is responsible\
    \ for delivering\nthe capabilities of the transport and application layers of\
    \ the TCP/IP model when communication\ncrosses diﬀerent network environments.\
    \ Finally, the network communication block is responsible for\nthe communication\
    \ (routing) between the networks, of the hop-to-hop at end-to-end blocks, using\n\
    the address, for example, IPv4 and IPv6, and the ID resolution. In addition, it\
    \ will be responsible for\nmanaging the QoS.\nThe next layer is the services layer,\
    \ which is comprised of three blocks. The services block includes\nthe IoT services\
    \ and operability for their discovery and search. The organization block performs\
    \ the\nassignment of the services according to the needs of the users or the available\
    \ resources. At last,\nin business environments that relate to IoT, the modeling\
    \ and execution of service block will be invoked\nfrom the execution of the applications.\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 1042\n36 of 48\nThere are two blocks, management and security,\
    \ that act on both the previously described\ncommunication and services layers.\
    \ The management block is based on the fault, conﬁguration,\naccounting, performance,\
    \ security (FCAPS) model and framework.\nThis is a model of the ISO\nTelecommunications\
    \ Management Network [220].\nThe security block guarantees both the security and\
    \ privacy of the systems and is comprised\nof four blocks. The authentication\
    \ block is responsible for the authentication of users and services.\nThe authorization\
    \ block manages access control policies. Furthermore, access control decisions\
    \ will\nbe made based on access control policies. The key exchange & management\
    \ block is used to achieve\nsecure communications between peers. Finally, the\
    \ trust & reputation block is responsible for scoring\nthe user and calculating\
    \ the level of trust of the service.\nThe last layer is the application layer.\
    \ It allows users to interact with the IoT system. From this\nlayer, users can\
    \ receive alarms, visualize the gathered data in real-time or activate the actuators\
    \ or\nactions that have not been programmed automatically.\n7.9. Future Challenges\
    \ of IoT Irrigation Systems\nThe Internet of Underground Things (IoUT) is a new\
    \ view of the IoT [221].\nIt consists of\ndeploying both underground and above\
    \ ground IoT devices that communicate among themselves\nwith underground-underground,\

    systems as the devices would not be impeding the work of machines and farmers\

    \ materials in some of the\nelements of the IoT devices is to be expected [203].\n\
    As it has further been commented on Section 7.1, blockchain and AI will be incorporated\
    \ into most\nIoT services [210], including those aimed at irrigation and precision\
    \ agriculture. These technologies\nprovide not only increased security but also\
    \ optimization to the management of the IoT systems.\nThis will lead to an increased\
    \ understanding of the crops and a faster way to characterize genetically\nmodiﬁed\
    \ crops and the eﬀects of new fertilizers and pesticides. Furthermore, it will\
    \ aid in optimizing\nand reducing water consumption and improving the new mechanisms\
    \ that are being proposed to\ndetermine if treated wastewater can be used for\
    \ irrigation and which crops can be irrigated with\nwastewater depending on its\
    \ composition.\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n37 of 48\nLastly, farmers usually have\
    \ a very small proﬁt and thus, these IoT systems may not be aﬀordable\nto them.\
    \ Therefore, the cost of IoT devices and the overall system implementation should\
    \ have a\ndecreasing tendency for these types of systems to have a commercial\
    \ future.\n8. Conclusions and Future Work\nWater management is paramount in countries\
    \ with water scarcity. This also aﬀects agriculture, as\na large amount of water\
    \ is dedicated to this use. The rising concerns about global warming have led\n\
    to the consideration of creating water management measures to ensure the availability\
    \ of water for\nfood production and consumption. Thus, the researches on water\
    \ usage reduction for irrigation have\nincreased over the years. In this paper,\
    \ we have provided an overview of the actual state of the art\nregarding IoT irrigation\
    \ systems for agriculture. We have identiﬁed the most monitored parameters to\n\
    characterize water quality for irrigation, soil and weather conditions. We have\
    \ also identiﬁed the most\nutilized nodes to implement IoT and WSN systems for\
    \ the irrigation of crops and the most popular\nwireless technologies. Furthermore,\
    \ the current trends in the implementation of IoT systems for crop\nmanagement\
    \ and irrigation have been discussed as well. We have provided a 4-layer architecture\n\
    proposal as well for the management of crop irrigation.\nAs future work, we are\
    \ developing a smart irrigation system that evaluates water quality prior to\n\
    irrigation based on the proposed architecture.\nAuthor Contributions: Methodology,\

    people may have regarding the agricultural process, the reality is that today''s
    agriculture industry is data-centered, precise, and smarter than ever. The rapid
    emergence of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) based technologies redesigned almost
    every industry including “smart agriculture” which moved the industry from statistical
    to quantitative approaches. Such revolutionary changes are shaking the existing
    agriculture methods and creating new opportunities along a range of challenges.
    This article highlights the potential of wireless sensors and IoT in agriculture,
    as well as the challenges expected to be faced when integrating this technology
    with the traditional farming practices. IoT devices and communication techniques
    associated with wireless sensors encountered in agriculture applications are analyzed
    in detail. What sensors are available for specific agriculture application, like
    soil preparation, crop status, irrigation, insect and pest detection are listed.
    How this technology helping the growers throughout the crop stages, from sowing
    until harvesting, packing and transportation is explained. Furthermore, the use
    of unmanned aerial vehicles for crop surveillance and other favorable applications
    such as optimizing crop yield is considered in this article. State-of-the-art
    IoT-based architectures and platforms used in agriculture are also highlighted
    wherever suitable. Finally, based on this thorough review, we identify current
    and future trends of IoT in agriculture and highlight potential research challenges.

    \ of Things (IoT)-based automation of agricultural events can change the agriculture\n\
    sector from being static and manual to dynamic and smart, leading to enhanced\
    \ production with\nreduced human efforts. Precision Agriculture (PA) along with\
    \ Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) are the\nmain drivers of automation in the agriculture\
    \ domain. PA uses speciﬁc sensors and software to ensure\nthat the crops receive\
    \ exactly what they need to optimize productivity and sustainability. PA includes\n\
    retrieving real data about the conditions of soil, crops and weather from the\
    \ sensors deployed in the\nﬁelds. High-resolution images of crops are obtained\
    \ from satellite or air-borne platforms (manned\nor unmanned), which are further\
    \ processed to extract information used to provide future decisions.\nIn this\
    \ paper, a review of near and remote sensor networks in the agriculture domain\
    \ is presented\nalong with several considerations and challenges. This survey\
    \ includes wireless communication\ntechnologies, sensors, and wireless nodes used\
    \ to assess the environmental behaviour, the platforms\nused to obtain spectral\
    \ images of crops, the common vegetation indices used to analyse spectral\nimages\
    \ and applications of WSN in agriculture. As a proof of concept, we present a\
    \ case study\nshowing how WSN-based PA system can be implemented. We propose an\
    \ IoT-based smart solution\nfor crop health monitoring, which is comprised of\
    \ two modules. The ﬁrst module is a wireless sensor\nnetwork-based system to monitor\
    \ real-time crop health status. The second module uses a low altitude\nremote\
    \ sensing platform to obtain multi-spectral imagery, which is further processed\
    \ to classify\nhealthy and unhealthy crops. We also highlight the results obtained\
    \ using a case study and list the\nchallenges and future directions based on our\
    \ work.\nKeywords: smart agriculture; precision agriculture; vegetation index;\
    \ Internet of Things\n1. Introduction\nThe rapidly-growing human population has\
    \ increased food demands for human survival on\nthe Earth. Meeting the food requirements\
    \ with limited resources of the planet is a big challenge [1].\nSeveral state-of-the-art\
    \ technologies are being incorporated in the agriculture domain to enhance\nthe\
    \ productivity to cope with this challenge. Precision Agriculture (PA) is comprised\
    \ of near and\nremote sensing techniques using IoT sensors, which help to monitor\
    \ crop states at multiple growth\nlevels. PA involves the acquisition and processing\
    \ of a large amount of data related to crop health.\nMultiple parameters are involved\
    \ in plants health, including water level, temperature and others.\nPA enables\
    \ a farmer to know precisely what parameters are needed for healthy crop, where\
    \ these\nparameters are needed and in what amount at a particular instance of\
    \ time. This requires collecting\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796; doi:10.3390/s19173796\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n2 of 25\nmassive information\
    \ from different sources and different parts of the ﬁeld such as soil nutrients,\
    \ the\npresence of pests and weeds, chlorophyll content in plants and some weather\
    \ conditions. All collected\ninformation needs to be analysed to produce agronomic\
    \ recommendations. For instance, given the\ndevelopmental stage of plants, their\
    \ level of greenness (chlorophyll content) reveals the nutrients\nneeded. This\
    \ information is combined with the characteristics of the soil where the plant\
    \ is located\nalong with weather forecast. All collected information is further\
    \ used to determine how much of a\ncertain fertilizer should be applied to that\
    \ plant on the next day. The delivery of agronomic information\non the right time\
    \ to farmer and ensuring that he/she applies these recommendations are key to\n\
    enhancing the yields.\nThe foremost driver of PA is a WSN, which is a network\
    \ of multiple wireless nodes connected\ntogether to monitor the physical parameters\
    \ of environment. Each wireless node is comprised of a\nradio transceiver, a micro-controller,\
    \ sensor(s), an antenna, along with other circuitry that enables it\nto communicate\
    \ with some gateway to transmit information collected by the sensor(s) [2]. Sensors\n\
    measure the physical parameters and send the collected information to the controller,\
    \ which further\ntransmits this information to the cloud or a portable device.\
    \ The agriculture sector has multiple\nrequirements comprised of soil statistics,\
    \ crops’ nature, weather conditions, fertilizer types and water\nrequirements.\
    \ Crops have diverse requirements depending on different crops on the same land\
    \ and the\nsame plant on different lands with different weather conditions. Sensors\
    \ monitor the varying behaviour\nof these crop parameters. Due to rapid advancement\
    \ in WSN technologies, the size and the cost of\nsensors have reduced, which make\
    \ it feasible to implement them in many sectors of life including\nagriculture.\
    \ The most common sensors used in the agriculture domain that capture environmental\n\
    parameters related to crops [3] are listed in Table 1.\nIn general, a WSN consists\
    \ of one or more wireless nodes that are further connected with sensors.\nThese\
    \ nodes are tiny devices that are responsible for collecting data. Nodes are divided\
    \ into two types,\na source node that collects the data, and the other is sink\
    \ or gateway node, which receives data from the\nsource nodes. A sink node has\
    \ more computational power compared to a source node. However, there\nare energy,\
    \ memory, power, size, data rate and price constraints when choosing wireless\
    \ nodes. Table 2\nshows a comparison of wireless nodes along with their common\
    \ speciﬁcations [3]. Among all wireless\nnodes presented in Table 2, MICA2 is\
    \ considered to be more suitable as compared to others because of\nits large number\
    \ of expansion connectors, which makes it suitable to connect with several sensors.\n\
    Many applications using WSN have been proposed since the last decade to monitor\
    \ crops’ health\nremotely. In [4], a cyber-physical system was presented for monitoring\
    \ of a potato crop. Cyber physical\nsystems can be expressed as smart systems\
    \ that are comprised of software, hardware and physical\ncomponents, integrated\
    \ together to sense the varying states of the real world. The proposed system\n\
    consists of three layers: the ﬁrst layer is the physical layer, in which all sensory\
    \ data are collected;\nthe second layer is the network layer in which data are\
    \ transmitted to the cloud; the third layer is\nthe decision layer in which the\
    \ data are analysed and processed to make decisions according to the\nobservations.\n\
    There are several challenges in IoT-based systems due to exponential increasing\
    \ devices. As in\na typical IoT network, every node transmits data to the remote\
    \ cloud, which results in cloud\ncongestion, and the main challenges underlying\
    \ the IOT-based system are latency with minimum\npower requirements, better usage\
    \ of bandwidth and intermittent Internet connectivity. Fog computing\nand edge\
    \ computing are the state-of-the-art techniques to overcome these issues; which\
    \ reduce the\ncomputational burden of cloud. The main goal of fog computing is\
    \ to conserve energy and bandwidth,\nwhich helps to increase the quality of service\
    \ to the end users. In [5], an energy-efﬁcient architecture of\nthe Fog of Everything\
    \ was presented, which was comprised of six layers. The ﬁrst layer was an Internet\n\
    Of Everything (IOE) layer, where things (could be ﬁxed, mobile or nomadic) functioned\
    \ under multiple\nspatially-distributed clusters. The second was a wireless access\
    \ network that supported Thing to Fog\n(T2F) and Fog to Thing (F2T) communication\
    \ over the wireless channel. In the third layer, the connected\nfog nodes behaved\
    \ such as a virtualized cluster. There was an inter-fog backbone in the fourth\
    \ layer,\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n3 of 25\nwhich was responsible for connectivity\
    \ among fog nodes. The next layer was the virtualization layer,\nwhich provided\
    \ each connected thing with the ability to augment its limited resource set, exploiting\n\
    the computation capability at the virtual clone. In the last layer, there was\
    \ an overlay inter-clone\nvirtual network that empowered Peer to Peer (P2P) communication.\
    \ Then, a protocol stack for FOE\nwas presented, which was further tested by creating\
    \ a small prototype named as V-FOE and simulated\non the iFogsim toolkit. The\
    \ results provided strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed\nframework\
    \ and more energy efﬁciency with reduced failure rate and delay.\nTable 1. Wireless\

    The energy efﬁciency is the most serious consideration while developing any fog\
    \ architecture.\nIn [6], an energy-efﬁcient protocol for a fog-supported wireless\
    \ sensor network was presented, which\nmaximized the lifetime of the network by\
    \ uniformly distributing the energy among connected nodes.\nThe performance of\
    \ the proposed algorithm was compared with the existing state-of-the-art algorithms\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 3796\n4 of 25\nin MATLAB. The results showed that the proposed\
    \ algorithm was highly energy efﬁcient with a\nprolonged network lifetime.\nRegardless\
    \ of all the advancements in the IoT domain, the adoption of PA has been limited\
    \ to\nsome developed countries. Because of the lack of resources, remote sensing-based\
    \ techniques to\nmonitor crop health are not common in under-developed countries\
    \ such as Pakistan, which results in\na loss of yield. Pakistan is an agricultural\
    \ country due to is large arable land and climatic variations,\nwhich make it\
    \ suitable to cultivate multiple types of crops. Despite all these natural resources,\
    \ Pakistan\nis still unable to produce massive yields [7]. The main reason behind\
    \ the low production is traditional\nfarming practices, which are used for crop\
    \ health monitoring and yield estimation. These techniques\nare completely based\
    \ on farmer’s intuition and experience. Farmers visit the ﬁelds in order to monitor\n\
    the crop, which is very laborious and quite challenging in the case of large arable\
    \ land. In this case, the\narea under insect/pest attack is inaccurately measured,\
    \ which can result in over spraying of insecticide\nand pesticide, which adversely\
    \ affects the nutrition in crops.\nKeeping in mind all these issues, our motivation\
    \ is to provide the industry and research\ncommunities with a survey of technologies,\
    \ metrics and current practices concerning communication\ndevices, sensors and\
    \ platforms used to monitor and analyse multiple sources of data (spectral images,\n\
    IoT, etc.) used in environmental and agriculture applications. As the main contribution,\
    \ we generated\na technological taxonomy for PA, which was driven by an IoT-based\
    \ architecture to monitor the crops’\nhealth. The developed system had two modules\
    \ including wireless sensor network-based crop heath\nmonitoring in which multiple\
    \ sensors were used to get the real-time heath status of crop; the other\none\
    \ was NDVI-based analysis of spectra images captured by a drone to assess the\
    \ chlorophyll content,\nwhich was further used to monitor the health of the crop.\n\

    \ wireless\ncommunication technologies used in the agriculture domain; Section\

    \ protocols have been introduced in the last few decades due to the rapid\nincrease\
    \ in IoT devices and WSN technologies. Each protocol has its own speciﬁcations\
    \ depending on\nthe bandwidth, number of free channels, data rate, battery timing,\
    \ price and other factors [8]. The most\ncommonly-used protocols for wireless\
    \ communication in IoT-based applications in agriculture are:\nSensors 2019, 19,\
    \ 3796\n5 of 25\n2.1. Cellular\nCellular technology is most suitable for applications\
    \ that require an extraordinary data rate.\nIt can utilize GSM, 3G and 4G cellular\
    \ communication capabilities by providing reliable high-speed\nconnectivity to\
    \ the Internet, requiring higher power consumption.\nIt requires infrastructure\
    \ to\nbe deployed and operation cost and back up staff for it with a centralized\
    \ managed authority.\n4G cellular technology requires more battery power, but\
    \ cellular technology is a good option in\nunderground wireless sensor networks,\
    \ such as security systems in smart home projects and agriculture\napplications\
    \ [9]. A smart irrigation systems was presented in [10], in which several soil\
    \ moisture\nsensors were deployed in the ﬁeld in the ZigBee mesh network. The\
    \ reading captured from the ﬁelds\nwere transmitted over the cloud using the cellular\
    \ 4G LTE network.\n2.2. 6LoWPAN\n6LoWPAN is an IP-based communication protocol,\
    \ which was the ﬁrst protocol used for IoT\ncommunication. 6LoWPAN is also low\
    \ cost because of the low bandwidth and low power consumption.\n6LoWPAN supports\
    \ multiple topologies such as star and mesh topologies. To handle interoperability\n\
    between IPv6 and IEEE 802.15.4, there is an adaptation layer between the network\
    \ layer and the\nMAC layer [8]. The applications for 6LoWPAN are monitoring the\
    \ health equipment, environment\nmonitoring and in security and home automation\
    \ systems. In [11], a 6LoWPAN-enabled wireless sensor\nnetwork was presented to\
    \ monitor the soil properties of crops. The 6LoWPAN system architecture\nfor precision\
    \ agriculture application was discussed in [12] where the performance evaluation\
    \ of this\nprotocol was discussed with several baud rates and power constraints.\n\
    2.3. ZigBee\nZigBee is a wireless communication protocol widely used in precision\
    \ agriculture to monitor\nenvironmental conditions related to crops’ health [13].\
    \ It is based on the wireless 802.15.4 standard.\nBasically, it was developed\
    \ for personal area networks by the ZigBee alliance [8]. It has a ﬂexible\nnetwork\
    \ structure, long battery life, supports mesh, star and tree topology with multi-hop\
    \ data\ntransmission, is easily installed and supports large nodes. It has a short\
    \ range with limited data speed\nand is less secure compared to Wi-Fi-based systems.\
    \ ZigBee is very common in smart agriculture\napplications such as smart green\
    \ houses and smart irrigation systems [14]. In [15], a smart irrigation\nsystem\
    \ was presented based on the ZigBee communication protocol. This system consisted\
    \ of two\nnodes, i.e., a sensor node and an actuator node. The sensor node was\
    \ comprised of soil moisture\nsensors, which monitored the water level in the\
    \ soil. The actuator module was responsible for taking\nactions according to the\
    \ water level of the soil. All communication was carried out by means of\nZigBee\
    \ protocol.\n2.4. BLE\nBLE is as famous as the Bluetooth smart technology, which\
    \ is a suitable protocol for IoT\napplications including agriculture [16]. It\
    \ is particularly designed for low bandwidth, low latency and\nshort range for\
    \ IoT applications. The main advantages of BLE over typical Bluetooth include\
    \ lower\nsetup time, lower power consumption and unlimited support for nodes in\
    \ a star topology. It has a\nvery limited range of 10 meters. However, the drawbacks\
    \ are that it can only provide communication\nbetween two devices, it presents\
    \ low security, and it can lose connection during communication. In [17],\na BLE-based\
    \ infrastructure was presented to collect the sensors’ data. The proposed system\
    \ utilized a\nsmart phone to collect the data of sensors using BLE, where sensors\
    \ were deployed in the plants, i.e.,\nsoil moisture sensors and soil temperature\
    \ sensor.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n6 of 25\n2.5. RFID\nRFID systems consist of\
    \ a reader and a transponder, which have a very small radio frequency,\ncalled\
    \ the RF tag. This tag is programmed electronically with distinctive information\
    \ that has a reading\ncharacteristic. RFID has two technologies for the tag system\
    \ the ﬁrst is the active reader tag system,\nand the other is the passive reader\
    \ tag. Active reader tag systems are more expensive, as they utilize\nmore battery\
    \ power and use high frequencies. However, passive reader tag systems are low\
    \ powered.\nSome IoT applications using RFID include smart shopping, healthcare,\
    \ national security and smart\nagriculture applications. An IoT-based smart irrigation\
    \ system based on RFID was presented in [18].\nThe system was comprised of soil\
    \ moisture and soil temperature sensors along with a water control\nsystem, so\
    \ it collected the reading of the sensors and sent these readings to the cloud\
    \ using RFID\ncommunication protocols, where the user controlled a water pump\
    \ based on the water level of the soil.\n2.6. Wi-Fi\nWi-Fi is the most common\
    \ communication protocol that enables devices to communicate over\na wireless\
    \ signal. Wi-Fi provides Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) connectivity to millions\
    \ of\nlocations, i.e., homes, ofﬁces and public locations such as cafes, hotels\
    \ and airports with high speed.\nThe Wi-Fi protocol supports IEEE 802.11, 802.11a,\
    \ 802.11b, 802.11g and 802.11n. Wi-Fi is widely used\nin IoT-based applications\
    \ including agriculture systems, i.e., smart irrigation, crop health monitoring\n\
    and greenhouses. In [19], an infrastructure was presented to monitor environmental\
    \ parameters\ninside the greenhouse such as temperature, light intensity and soil\
    \ moisture level. This platform\nwas comprised of sensors that collected the data\
    \ related to the environmental variation and sent to\nthe cloud using Wi-Fi. Similarly,\
    \ another smart agriculture system based on Wi-Fi communication\nprotocols was\
    \ presented in [20]. This last one consisted of a Raspberry Pi connected with\
    \ multiple\nsensors, which collected the data. The collected data were further\
    \ transmitted to the cloud using Wi-Fi\ncommunication protocols.\n2.7. LoRaWAN\n\
    LoRaWAN operates on the LoRa network. LoRaWAN deﬁnes the system architecture and\n\
    communication protocol of the network, while the physical layer of LoRa enables\
    \ the link for\nlong-range communication. LoRaWAN manages the frequencies in communication,\
    \ data rate and\npower consumption for all devices. LoRaWAN is common in agricultural\
    \ applications because of\nits large coverage area and low power consumption [21].\
    \ In [14], a smart irrigation system based on\nLoRaWAN was presented. Table 3\
    \ shows the comparison of all mentioned wireless communication\nprotocols [8].\
    \ Among all wireless communication technologies, 6LoWPAN and ZigBee are considered\n\
    to be more suitable for PA application because both are based on mesh networking,\
    \ which makes them\nsuitable to cover large area.\nTable 3. Wireless communication\

    \ Image-Based Remote Sensing\nRemote sensing has been widely used in PA to monitor\
    \ crops’ health for the last two decades.\nRemote sensing is a phenomenon in which\
    \ physical conditions of the Earth are observed remotely by\ncalculating the emitted\
    \ and reﬂected radiation from some distance. There are special cameras that\n\
    are used to capture images for further analysis to ﬁnd the characteristics of\
    \ a speciﬁc area. Multiple\nplatforms are used to mount these cameras that capture\
    \ images of the objects.\n3.1. Spectral Image Platforms\nRemote sensing platform\
    \ considerations for spectral images are airborne-based, satellite-based\nand\
    \ Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based [22]. Each platform has its own coverage\
    \ range, which\nis determined by three factors: (i) Ground Sampling Distance (GSD),\
    \ which is computed in terms of\nspatial resolution, (ii) data collection rate\
    \ or frequency and (iii) average distance between the object\nand sensor. Apart\
    \ from coverage range, several factors [23] affect the performance of platforms,\n\
    as mentioned in Table 4.\nTable 4. Key differences between spectral image platforms.\n\

    \ are considered to be the most stable platforms among\nall others. These platforms\
    \ consist of satellites, rockets and space shuttles. Space borne platforms are\n\
    categorized based on the orbits and timing. The advantages of satellite-based\
    \ remote sensing include\nhigh spatial resolution, which makes it promising to\
    \ extract extensive time-series data. The images\nobtained by satellite platforms\
    \ cover large area and are stable without noise, which is normally induced\ndue\
    \ to interference while image capturing. However, the main problem with satellite-based\
    \ platforms\nis their high cost in the case of high spatial resolution images.\
    \ The second problem is their strictly ﬁxed\ntime schedule, so data cannot be\
    \ collected at critical timings. The re-visitation times vary from twice\nin one\
    \ day to 16 days, depending on the orbit of the satellite. The other big problem\
    \ is that satellite\nplatforms are highly sensitive to weather conditions, so\
    \ if the weather is cloudy, the captured image will\nhave less detailed information.\
    \ Table 5 shows the main types of satellites with their speciﬁcations [22].\n\
    Among all satellite platforms presented in Table 5, some satellite data are freely\
    \ available,\nwhile others provide a commercial solution. The commercial solutions\
    \ such as Pleiades-1 provide\nimages with a high resolution and a revisit time\
    \ of one day. QuickBird, Landsat-8 and Sentinel are\nfrequently-used satellite\
    \ platforms used to obtain hyperspectral imagery. QuickBird was launched\nin 2001\
    \ by USA. The Panchromatic (PAN) and four Multi-Spectral (MS) imagery sensors\
    \ are used in\nQuickBird with a GSD of 0.7 × 0.7–2.6 × 2.6 m with a revisit time\
    \ 1–3.5 days. QuickBird provides a\nsmall revisit time, but it is a commercial\
    \ solution. In contrast to QuickBird, Landsat-8 and Sentinel\nprovide free solutions.\
    \ Landsat-8 was launched in 2013 by the USA. Landsat-8 provides a GSD of\n16 days\
    \ with PAN and 11-MS imagery sensors. Though revisit time of Landsat-8 is much\
    \ higher\ncompared to QuickBird, but it provides images with 11 different multi-spectral\
    \ bands.\nSentinel is another broadly-used satellite launched by the EU. It currently\
    \ has three missions,\ni.e., Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3. These missions\
    \ provide images with 21 MS bands with\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n8 of 25\nrevisit\
    \ times of 5–10 days depending on which Sentinel mission is used. However, Sentinel-2\
    \ is a\ncommonly-used platform in precision agriculture as it provides data freely\
    \ at a 10-m spatial resolution\nand covers a swath width of 290 km. By combining\
    \ Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B, the revisit time is\nfurther reduced to ﬁve days,\
    \ which helps in change detection. The complete details of all satellite\nplatforms\
    \ with their speciﬁcations are listed in Table 5, where other platforms such as\
    \ SAT, MODIS\nand WordView are also considered.\nTable 5. Satellite platforms\

    \ a vibrant alternative to satellite and airborne, which are quite ﬂexible and\
    \ cost\neffective. A typical UAV platform consists of a communication and navigation\
    \ system that incorporates\na set of sensors mounted on it. Among UAV platforms,\
    \ there are mainly ﬁxed-wing platforms. and\nmultirotor options are available.\
    \ The ﬂying time is based on the payload weight. In general, a longer\nﬂying time\
    \ is achieved by ﬁxed-wing systems, which demands lighter weight payloads. For\
    \ example,\nhigh-deﬁnition cameras weighing less than 300 grams as the payload\
    \ of a ﬁxed-wing UAV allow it to ﬂy\nfor around two hours using currently available\
    \ battery power [24]. On the contrary, battery-powered\nmultirotor UAV with higher\
    \ payload capacity have a reduced ﬂying time, i.e., around 15–25 min.\nTable 7\
    \ shows UAV platforms commonly used in the agriculture domain and concretely to\
    \ monitor\nthe health of crops remotely [22]. Among these platforms, DJI/Phantom-2\
    \ is a more suitable choice\nfor intermediate agricultural land because of its\
    \ low cost and ease of use. The other advantage of this\nplatform is that it provides\
    \ support for mounting multiple cameras, which helps to monitor the crop in\n\
    multiple electro-magnetic bands. The American Aerospace/RS-16 is also an option\
    \ because of its ﬂight\ntime and large are coverage, but due to its high cost,\
    \ this platform is not common.\nIn [25], the ESAFLY A2500_WH helicopter was used\
    \ to implement the platform of the UAV\nwith Tetra cam ADC Micro as the camera\
    \ to capture hyper-spectral images of two different types of\ncultivation, i.e.,\
    \ vineyard and tomato. The images captured by the UAV platform are very high in\n\

    \ described above, a series of Vegetation\nIndices (VIs) can be computed. Vegetation\
    \ Indices (VIs) obtained from remote sensing-based canopies\nare effective algorithms\
    \ for quantitative and qualitative evaluations of vigour, vegetation cover and\n\
    growth dynamics, among other applications [26]. Hitherto, no uniﬁed mathematical\
    \ expression exists\nthat deﬁnes all VIs due to the complexity of the several\
    \ light spectra combinations, instrumentation,\nresolutions and platforms used.\
    \ In particular, this section focuses on vegetation indices NDVI, GDVI\nand SAVI,\
    \ as they are widely used in PA.\n3.2.1. NDVI\nThe Normalized Difference Vegetation\
    \ Index (NDVI) is the most popular VI that is extensively\nused to ﬁnd the content\
    \ of green in PA applications [27,28]. It uses Red (R) and Near Infrared (NIR)\n\
    channels to compute the NDVI index. More NIR light is absorbed by healthy vegetation;\
    \ however,\nabsorption ratio is very small for red light. NDVI is computed by\
    \ Equation (1) and returns a value\nbetween −1 and 1 [29].\nNDVI = NIR − R\nNIR\
    \ + R\n(1)\nHigher NDVI value indicate healthy vegetation, while smaller values\
    \ of NDVI show that vegetation is\nvery small at that speciﬁc region. There is\
    \ another form of NDVI, i.e., the Green Normalized Vegetation\nIndex (GNDVI),\
    \ which uses the green channel instead of red. GNDVI is computed by Equation (2):\n\
    GNDVI = NIR − G\nNIR + G\n(2)\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n11 of 25\n3.2.2. Difference\
    \ Vegetation Index\nThe DVI was proposed to reduce the effect of soil reﬂectance,\
    \ which is not covered by NDVI [30].\nDVI is different between the reﬂectance\
    \ of the NIR band to the reﬂectance of the red band. DVI is also\ncomputed with\
    \ the green band, i.e., GDVI. Both DVI and GDVI are computed by Equations (3)\
    \ and (4):\nDVI = NIR − R\n(3)\nGDVI = NIR − G\n(4)\n3.2.3. SAVI\nNDVI and DVI\
    \ do not compensate the background effect of soil. Therefore, many vegetation\n\
    indices were introduced to compensate the effect of soil reﬂectance. The Soil\
    \ Adjusted Vegetation Index\n(SAVI), the Green Soil Adjusted vegetation Index\
    \ (GSAVI), the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation\nIndex (OSAVI), the Green Optimized\
    \ Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OGSAVI) and the Modiﬁed\nSoil Adjusted Vegetation\
    \ Index (MSAVI) [31–33] are common among them, which are computed by\nEquations\
    \ (5)–(9):\nSAVI =\n1.5(NIR − R)\n(NIR + R + 0.5)\n(5)\nGSAVI = 1.5(NIR − G)\n\
    NIR + G + 0.5\n(6)\nOSAVI =\n(NIR − G)\nNIR + R + 0.16\n(7)\nGOSAVI =\n(NIR −\
    \ G)\nNIR + G + 0.16\n(8)\nMSAVI = 0.5[2(NIR + 1) −\nq\n(2NIR + 1)2 − 8(NIR −\
    \ R)]\n(9)\n3.2.4. NR and NG:\nNormalized Red (NR) and Normalized Green (NG) are\
    \ two other famous vegetation indices being\nused in PA [33]. NR focuses on the\
    \ part of spectrum where radiation is absorbed by chlorophyll, while\nNG focuses\
    \ on the part of the spectrum where radiation is absorbed by other pigments, excluding\n\
    chlorophyll. NR and NG are computed by Equations (10) and (11):\nNR =\nR\nNIR\
    \ + R + G\n(10)\nNG =\nG\nNIR + R + G\n(11)\n4. Wireless Sensor Network Applications\
    \ in Agriculture\nMultiple applications of wireless sensor networks are being\
    \ utilized today in the agriculture sector.\nSome very common applications are\
    \ smart irrigation, smart fertilization, smart pest control and green\nhouse monitoring.\n\
    4.1. Smart Irrigation Systems\nSmart irrigation is an artiﬁcial irrigation application\
    \ that controls the quantity of water by making\na decision about where water\
    \ is needed. It is the most signiﬁcant constituent in agriculture, which has\n\
    a great impact on crops’ health, cost and productivity. One major aspect of smart\
    \ irrigation is to avoid\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n12 of 25\nthe wastage of water\
    \ since most countries in the world are facing water scarcity problems. A smart\n\
    irrigation system was presented in [34] in which a Raspberry Pi was used along\
    \ with two sensors:\na soil moisture sensor was used to assess the water level\
    \ in the soil, while a temperature and humidity\nsensor was used to monitor the\
    \ environmental condition. The Raspberry Pi was connected to these\nsensors and\
    \ the water supply network. A mobile application was developed for remote monitoring\n\
    and remote water ﬂow control enabling both manual and automatic water ﬂow control.\
    \ In automatic\nmode, water ﬂow was automatically turned ON/OFF based on the water\
    \ level of the soil without\nhuman intervention. In manual mode, the user was\
    \ able to monitor the soil moisture level. An alert\nwas generated when the water\
    \ level of soil was getting below a speciﬁc threshold, and the user turned\nit\
    \ ON/OFF using a mobile application.\nPower is a big concern in IoT-based platforms,\
    \ so many researchers have developed power-\nefﬁcient systems. A power-efﬁcient\
    \ water irrigation system was presented using solar power [35]\nin which the controller\
    \ was connected to the soil sensor and water supply valve. The water valve\nwas\
    \ turned ON/OFF based on the water level monitored by the moisture sensor. The\
    \ power was\nsupplied by the solar panel, so the system was independent of any\
    \ external power module. Another\nsensor-based IoT system for water irrigation\
    \ was presented in [36] in which the controller controlled\nthe opening and closing\
    \ of a solenoid valve based on the water level of the soil. In addition, a series\
    \ of\nweather alerts were sent to the user via a mobile application to update\
    \ the temperature and humidity of\nthe environment, which had a direct inﬂuence\
    \ on the water level of the soil. In [37], an energy-efﬁcient\nirrigation system\
    \ for cultivated crops was presented using a wireless sensor network in which\
    \ water\nwas effectively controlled based on environmental conditions. This system\
    \ estimated the quantity of\nwater needed for normal irrigation based on the humidity,\
    \ temperature and wind speed collected by\nsensors along with historical data.\n\
    In [38], an IoT-based irrigation system was presented using soil moisture sensors\
    \ controlled by\nATMEGA 328P on an Arduino UNO board along with a GPRS module.\
    \ The data collected from the\nsensors were sent to the cloud, i.e., Things Speak,\
    \ where graphs were generated to visualize the data\ntrends. A web portal was\
    \ also designed where the farmer was able to check the status of water, if it\n\
    was ON/OFF. Similarly, a real-time prototype for an irrigation system was presented\
    \ in [39] in which\nsoil moisture sensors and soil temperature sensors were used\
    \ to assess the water status of the soil.\nRFID was used to transmit data to the\
    \ cloud for further data analysis. Using ATMEGA 328, a water\nsprinkler system\
    \ for smart irrigation was presented in [40] using temperature, humidity and soil\n\
    moisture sensors. The water sprinkler was controlled based on the soil moisture\
    \ level to save water\nand reduce human effort. In [41], a cost-effective drip\
    \ irrigation system for a home was proposed in\nwhich a Raspberry Pi, Arduino,\
    \ electronic water control valve and relay were used. ZigBee protocols\nwere used\
    \ for communication. The user turned ON/OFF the water valve by sending commands\
    \ to the\nRaspberry Pi, which further processed the commands through the Arduino.\n\
    The sensors placement is a big issue that affects the accuracy of sensors. A detailed\
    \ discussion of\nsoil moisture positioning in the ﬁeld and their accuracy was\
    \ presented in [42]. For real-time irrigation\nsystems, complete software and\
    \ hardware requirements, problems and challenges and advantages\nwere discussed\
    \ in [43] where a big picture of the complete system was provided.\n4.2. Smart\
    \ Fertilization System\nFertilizer is an artiﬁcial or natural substance having\
    \ some chemical elements used to enhance\nthe growth and productivity of plants.\
    \ Manual spraying is a common technique used for fertilization.\nHowever, the\
    \ optimal way of fertilization requires sensing capabilities to ﬁnd the exact\
    \ place where\nfertilizer is needed, which chemical components are missing and\
    \ the amount of fertilizer needed.\nIt is important to provide fertilizers in\
    \ a very precise amount in order to improve productivity [44].\nMultiple fertilization\
    \ techniques have been presented by researchers since the last decade using WSN\n\
    and IoT.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n13 of 25\nAn automated fertilization system\
    \ was presented in [45] using real-time sensors to measure the\nsoil fertility.\
    \ The system consisted of three modules including input, output and decision support.\n\
    The decision support module measured the optimal amount of fertilizers needed\
    \ for the growth of the\nplants based on the real-time sensory data captured by\
    \ the sensors. A mechanical sensor named the\n“Pendulum Meter” was introduced\
    \ in [46], which was used for optimal fertilization. This sensor was\nmounted\
    \ on the tractor to measure the density of the crop, so the corresponding fertilizer\
    \ spreader\nwas controlled based on the readings of this sensor. The IEEE 802.11\
    \ Wi-Fi module was used for\ncommunication along with GPS. Real-time data of soil\
    \ were collected by several sensors, i.e., soil\nmoisture, temperature, conductivity,\
    \ NO2, CO2, etc. A Geographical Information System (GIS) server\nwas used to interpolate\
    \ sensory data.\n4.3. Smart Pest Control and Early Disease Detection System\n\
    Pest attacks are the root cause of low productivity in the agriculture sector.\
    \ These pests result in\nseveral serious diseases in plants that affect the plant’s\
    \ growth. However, disease prediction provides\nearly warning to the farmers,\
    \ which enables them to make appropriate decisions to control the disease\non\
    \ time. Pest control systems are comprised of electronic devices that enable humans\
    \ to identify traps\nin a speciﬁc range of these electronic devices [47]. These\
    \ electronic devices are sensors capable of\ncalculating the environmental parameters\
    \ for further analysis.\nMuch research has been done in the agriculture sector\
    \ for early disease detection and pest control\nsystems using more advanced and\
    \ sophisticated technologies [48,49]. Multiple imagery sensors have\nbeen used\
    \ by different researchers to collect imagery data, such as: RGB sensors, ﬂuorescence\
    \ imagery\nsensors, spectral sensors and thermal sensors [50]. The thermal sensors\
    \ are used to measure the water\nstatus in the plant by measuring the temperature,\
    \ since this parameter has a direct inﬂuence on the\nwater level in the plants.\
    \ RGB images have three colour channels, i.e., red, green and blue, which\ncan\
    \ be used to perceive the biometric effect in the plants. Multi- and hyper-spectral\
    \ sensors capture\nimages containing the spatial information of objects in multiple\
    \ wavebands. The spatial resolution is\ndependent on the distance between the\
    \ object and the sensor. That is why satellite images contain less\nspatial resolution\
    \ as compared to low altitude platforms such as drones. The ﬂuorescence sensors\
    \ are\nused to distinguish the photosynthetic activities in the plants. Various\
    \ image processing techniques\nare applied to these imagery data to identify the\
    \ diseases in plants.\nIn [50], an IoT-based plants disease and pest prediction\
    \ system was presented to minimize the\nexcessive use of fungicides and insecticides.\
    \ Weather condition monitoring sensors, i.e., temperature,\ndew, humidity and\
    \ wind speed, are used to monitor weather parameters to ﬁnd a correlation between\n\
    pest growth with weather. The sensors have been deployed in orchards, and data\
    \ collected from these\nsensors are sent to the cloud. The farmer is informed\
    \ about the alarming condition of the pest attack\non the crops.\nFrom a different\
    \ point of view, hyper-spectral images are used to analyse crops’ health and pest\n\
    attack using manned or unmanned vehicles on which spectral cameras are mounted.\
    \ The captured\nimages are analysed in depth using machine learning techniques\
    \ to identify the disease in the plants.\nAdvance Neural Networks (ANNs) are more\
    \ common for processing imagery data due to their ability\nto learn complex structures\
    \ and patterns. Using hyper-spectral images, a system was presented [51] to\n\
    identify disease or pest attack in crops. The proposed system for disease detection\
    \ used an ANN with\nmultiple layers.\nEarly disease detection in sugar beet plants\
    \ was presented in [52]. For early detection, four\nsupervised classiﬁcation algorithms\
    \ were applied on spectral images. Spectral images were then\ncollected for each\
    \ image, and multiple vegetation indices were calculated to be used in predictive\n\
    and perspective analysis. The vegetation indices used were NVDI, SR, SIPI, PSSRaand\
    \ PSSRb, ARI,\nREP, mCAIand RRE. These vegetation indices values were used as\
    \ features in the dataset. Support\nVector Machine (SVM), ANN, and decision tree\
    \ were used for classiﬁcation. A comparative analysis\nwas performed which, showed\
    \ that SVM outperformed other classiﬁers for disease detection with an\nSensors\
    \ 2019, 19, 3796\n14 of 25\naccuracy of 97.12%. In [53], a data mining technique\
    \ was applied on the already collected dataset of\ntwo types of crops, i.e., wheat\
    \ and paddy (rice), in India. For dimension reduction, Sammon’s mapping\nwas used\
    \ for multi-dimension scaling, i.e., to reduce the dimension also for unsupervised\
    \ learning.\nFor high dimensional data, dimension reduction is required prior\
    \ to performing further data analysis\nfor better data visualization and accuracy,\
    \ since redundant dimensions reduce the effectiveness of\nany data analysis algorithms.\
    \ Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is a very often-used technique\nalong with\
    \ Sammon’s mapping. Data from multi-dimensions were reduced to two or three dimensions.\n\
    Then, the Self-Organized Maps (SOM) algorithm for clustering was used to ﬁnd correlations\
    \ between\nthe data. The accuracy comparison of SOM and Sammon’s mapping was presented,\
    \ which showed\nthat SOM performed better on a large dataset, while Sammon’s mapping\
    \ was suitable for small ones.\nSmart phones played important role in data acquisition,\
    \ which were further used to monitor the crops’\nhealth. In [54], the health of\
    \ wheat crop was monitored using near surface imagery captured by a smart\nphone.\
    \ The crop was classiﬁed as healthy or unhealthy based on the green level by computing\
    \ Gcc.\nMost of the applications in PA have been either IoT-based in which multiple\
    \ sensors are used to\nassess the health of the crop or remote sensing-based in\
    \ which crop health is assessed by performing\nsome computation on spectral images.\
    \ We can compare crop health monitoring application based\non some attributes\
    \ such as which sensors are used in particular applications, whether web or mobile\n\
    services are provided or not, etc. The comparative analysis of some existing crop\
    \ health monitoring\napplications is presented in Table 8 based on some attributes.\n\
    To precisely monitor the crop health, both IoT-based techniques and remote sensing\
    \ techniques\nshould be used together to provide more reliable and accurate information\
    \ about the crop. As a\nproof of concept, we present a case study in which a crop\
    \ health monitoring system based on IoT and\nremote sensing techniques is proposed.\
    \ We provide a complete end-to-end solution in the agriculture\ndomain by facilitating\
    \ the agricultural user with web and mobile services so that he/she could be\n\
    informed about the latest condition of the crop in a timely manner. In this way,\
    \ remedy actions could\nbe performed in time, which will result in enhanced production.\n\

    \ Precision Agriculture\nWe developed a complete solution for crop health monitoring\
    \ based on IoT and remote sensing.\nIn the proposed system, crop health is monitored\
    \ using data collected from multiple IoT sensors,\nas well as NDVI mapping of\
    \ spectral images captured by a drone. The architecture of the proposed\nsystem\
    \ is shown in Figure 1, which was designed according to two main modules. The\
    \ ﬁrst module\nwas a wireless sensor network-based system in which multiple wireless\
    \ nodes were developed. Each\nwireless node was comprised of a soil moisture sensor\
    \ used to monitor the water level of the soil,\na soil temperature sensor used\
    \ to check the temperature of the soil and air temperature and humidity\nsensors.\
    \ These nodes were deployed across the ﬁeld in a star topology fashion where the\
    \ master node\ncollected readings from all slave nodes and transmitted the captured\
    \ reading to the back-end server for\nfurther processing. The master node acted\
    \ as a gateway node, which received data from all slave nodes\nusing NRF communication\
    \ module. After performing initial processing, the master node transmitted\nthe\
    \ data to the cloud using GSM communication technology. In the case of the unavailability\
    \ of the\nGSM network, this node stored the captured data and transmitted to the\
    \ cloud upon the availability\nof network.\nThe second module was used to monitor\
    \ crop health using multi-spectral imagery, which was\ncollected by a multi-spectral\
    \ camera mounted on a drone. The NDVI was computed using Equation (1)\nto classify\
    \ between healthy and unhealthy plants by measuring the chlorophyll content in\
    \ the crops,\nwhich was further used to localize the area under stress precisely.\n\
    All collected data were sent to the cloud where further analysis was performed.\
    \ The web portal\nwas designed to help the farmer monitor the crop proﬁle over\
    \ the whole life cycle. Currently, we are\nmonitoring soil moisture, soil temperature,\
    \ air moisture and air temperature readings in real time\nalong with NDVI mapping\
    \ of spectral imagery. Multiple web services were provided on the web\nportal\
    \ including historical/real data visualization using graphs, weather monitoring,\
    \ NDVI mapping\nand the correlation among measured parameters. Figure 2 shows\
    \ the snapshots of the web portal\nalong with different services.\nFigure 1. System\
    \ architecture.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n17 of 25\nFigure 2. User interface of\
    \ the web portal.\nFor portability and remote monitoring, a mobile application\
    \ was also developed to facilitate the\nfarmer/agronomist/landlord with all the\
    \ web services that are available on web portal. The alerts\nare generated when\
    \ an abnormal behaviour is observed in the crop, which help the farmer to take\n\
    remedy actions in a timely manner. The user interfaces of the mobile application\
    \ are shown in Figure 3.\nTherefore, the web portal along with mobile applications\
    \ provides a complete solution, which enables\nagricultural users monitor the\
    \ current status of the crop, as well as previous details.\nFigure 3. User interface\

    \ Discussion\n6.1. Analysis of the Data Collected by IoT Nodes\nThe developed\
    \ IoT nodes were deployed across the wheat ﬁelds of an area of 1.4375 hectare.\n\
    The selected area was located in Islamabad, Pakistan. The wheat ﬁelds are shown\
    \ in Figure 4 along\nwith the IoT node and sensors. We deployed the system across\
    \ the wheat ﬁeld in March 2019 when\nwheat was in the grain ﬁlling and grain ripening\
    \ stage.\nFigure 4. System deployed across the wheat ﬁelds.\nWe collected the\
    \ sensors’ readings such as air temperature, air humidity, soil temperature and\n\
    soil moisture. We compared the observed crop parameters with the ideal wheat temperature\
    \ proﬁle\nas shown in Figure 5. Extreme variation in the weather of Islamabad\
    \ was observed in that particular\ntime period, which can be seen by how the actual\
    \ temperature for wheat crop deviated from the ideal\ntemperature proﬁle of the\
    \ wheat crop.\nFigure 5. Deviation of observed temperature from the ideal temperature\
    \ proﬁle.\nAdditionally, we performed linear regression to ﬁnd the correlation\
    \ between observed parameters,\nwhich provided insight into how changes in one\
    \ parameter can effect the other parameter. The linear\nregression found a relation\
    \ between the two parameters by ﬁtting the equation of the line using the\nobserved\
    \ dataset [69]. Equation (12) represents an equation of the line where mrepresents\
    \ the slope of\nline, while c indicates the y-intercept. The variables m and c\
    \ were learned from the data.\ny = mx + c\n(12)\nFigure 6A shows the correlation\
    \ between the observed air temperature and air humidity, which showed\nthat both\
    \ were negatively correlated. The correlation between air temperature and soil\

    The rise in air temperature caused the air humidity to reduce, while it resulted\
    \ in an increase in\nsoil temperature and vice versa.\n6.2. Analysis of Multi-spectral\
    \ Images Captured by Drone\nTo collect multi-spectral imagery, we used the DJI-Phantom\
    \ Pro Advanced drone with the Sentera\nMulti-spectral-imaging sensor. The drone\
    \ had its own optical camera, while the multi-spectral camera\nwas mounted on\
    \ it to obtain spectral images. Multiple ﬂights of the drone were carried out\
    \ at the\nspeciﬁc growing stages of the crop, i.e., grain ripening and grain ﬁlling\
    \ stage. After collecting these\nimages, they were transferred to the cloud for\
    \ NDVI mapping. Figure 7A shows the optical image\nthat was captured on 16 May\
    \ 2019 when wheat was in the harvesting stage, while Figure 7B is its\nspectral\
    \ image, and Figure 7C is the NDVI mapping. Since wheat was at a mature stage,\
    \ its NDVI\nshould be very small, i.e., ideally there should be no green region\
    \ in the ﬁeld. However, in NDVI\nmapping, a large green region indicated the abnormal\
    \ behaviour of the crop. The green region was\ndue to naturally growing plants.\
    \ This information can be visualized on the web portal.\n(A)\n(B)\n(C)\nFigure\

    \ stage.\nFigure 8A shows the optical image that was captured on 24 July 2019\
    \ when maize was in the grain\nripening stage, while Figure 8B is its spectral\
    \ image, and Figure 8C is the NDVI mapping. The same\nbehaviour can be observed\
    \ with the maize crop, i.e., there should be a minimal green region in the\nﬁeld.\
    \ However, in NDVI mapping, a large green region indicated the abnormal behaviour\
    \ of the crop.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n20 of 25\n(A)\n(B)\n(C)\nFigure 8. Maize\

    PA has been used since the last few decades to enhance crops’ yield with reduced\
    \ costs and\nhuman effort, although the adoption of these novel techniques by\
    \ farmers is still very limited owing to\nthe following reasons or challenges.\n\
    7.1. Hardware Cost\nPA relies mostly on hardware such as sensors, wireless nodes,\
    \ drones, spectral imaging sensors,\netc., which are used to assess multiple parameters\
    \ in real time. These sensors have multiple limitations\nincluding high development,\
    \ maintenance and deployment cost. Some systems in PA are cost effective\nand\
    \ are suitable for small arable land, i.e., smart irrigation systems that require\
    \ low-cost hardware\ncomponents and sensors. However, drone-based systems for\
    \ crops’ health monitoring are feasible for\nlarge arable land due to high installation\
    \ cost.\n7.2. Weather Variations\nEnvironmental variation is one of the major\
    \ challenges that affects the accuracy of data collected\nby sensors. Sensor nodes\
    \ deployed in the ﬁeld are sensitive to environmental variations, i.e., rain,\n\
    ﬂuctuation in temperature, wind speed, sun light, etc. Communication between wireless\
    \ nodes\nand the cloud can be interrupted due interference induced in wireless\
    \ communication channels by\natmospheric disturbance. The satellite, air borne\
    \ and drone platforms are also sensitive to weather\nvariations. Imagery acquired\
    \ by these platforms is affected by contamination of clouds and other\nnatural\
    \ aerosols. The development of advanced techniques for atmospheric correction,\
    \ cloud detection\nand noise interpolation is a current open challenge, which\
    \ requires hard efforts from the research\ncommunity.\n7.3. Data Management\n\
    The sensors in PA constantly generate data. To ensure the integrity of data, some\
    \ data security\nmeasures needs to be in place, which will in turn enhance the\
    \ cost of the system. The readings from\nthe sensors have to be accurate in order\
    \ to take appropriate actions precisely when and where required.\nAn intruder\
    \ can corrupt the readings, and false readings will adversely reduce the effectiveness\
    \ of\nthe system. PA systems generate immense amounts of data, which require enough\
    \ resources to\nperform data analysis. Real-time data collected from sensors deployed\
    \ across the ﬁelds after a few\nminutes and spectral imagery acquired from high-altitude\
    \ or low-altitude platforms produce the bulk\nof the data, which increase the\
    \ storage and processing requirements. New software platforms and\nfacilities\
    \ for scalable management of Big Data sources are demanded. In this regard, the\
    \ generation\nof software-as-a-service solutions is focused on merging data management\
    \ and IoT thorough cloud\ncomputing platforms.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n21 of\
    \ 25\n7.4. Literacy Rate\nLiteracy is an important factor that inﬂuences the adoption\
    \ ratio in PA. In developing countries\nwhere the illiteracy rate is high, farmers\
    \ grow crops based on their experience. They do not utilize the\nstate-of-the-art\
    \ technologies in agriculture, which results in loss of production. Farmers need\
    \ to be\neducated in order to understand the technology or they have to trust\
    \ a third party for technical support.\nTherefore, in underdeveloped areas where\
    \ the literacy rate is not high, PA is not very common due to\nthe limitations\
    \ of resources and education.\n7.5. Connectivity\nNext-generation 5G networks\
    \ can be 100-times faster than 4G ones, making communication\nbetween devices\
    \ and servers much quicker. 5G can also carry much more data than other networks,\n\
    which makes it an ideal technology for transmitting information from remote sensors\
    \ and drones, key\ntools that are being tested in PA environments. The adoption\
    \ of new communication networks based\non 5G is a must in current applications\
    \ where secure and rapid data transfer enables real-time data\nmanagement and\
    \ support for decision making.\n7.6. Interoperability\nOne of the biggest problems\
    \ PA faces is the interoperability of equipment due to different digital\nstandards.\
    \ This lack of interoperability is not only obstructing the adoption of new IoT\
    \ technologies\nand slowing down their growth, but it also inhibits the gain of\
    \ production efﬁciency through smart\nagriculture applications. New methods and\
    \ protocols to integrate different machine communication\nstandards to unlock\
    \ the potential of efﬁcient machine-to-machine communication and data sharing\n\
    between machines and management information systems are required in the current\
    \ scenario of PA.\n8. Conclusion and Future Directions\nPrecision agriculture\
    \ is a modern practice used to enhance crops’ productivity using latest\ntechnologies,\
    \ i.e., WSN, IoT, cloud computing, Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning\n\
    (ML). Most of the research done so far indicates that PA-based practices have\
    \ a great inﬂuence on\nsustainability and productivity. The objective of PA is\
    \ to provide decision support systems based\non multiple parameters of crops,\
    \ i.e., soil nutrients, water level of the soil, wind speed, intensity of\nsunlight,\
    \ temperature, humidity, chlorophyll content, etc. However, several challenges\
    \ are involved\nin the development and deployment phase of these systems. This\
    \ article was aimed at providing a\nsurvey of modern technologies involving current\
    \ PA platforms, with the goal of supporting industry\nand research communities\
    \ on the development of modern applications for smart agriculture. A case\nstudy\
    \ was presented to prove the effectiveness of the PA in the agriculture domain.\n\
    Since the main objective of precision agriculture is to produce surplus yield\
    \ by optimizing the\nresources such as water, pesticides, fertilizers, etc., for\
    \ resource optimization, prescription maps play\nan important role, which enables\
    \ farmers to quantify resources required for healthy crops at any\nparticular\
    \ growth stage. Most of the research accomplished in the agriculture domain focuses\
    \ on the\nremote sensing platforms to collect imagery, which reﬂects only Vegetation\
    \ Indices (VIs) such as NDVI.\nThe prescription maps cannot be generated by only\
    \ using VIs; instead, multiple other factors need to\nbe considered such as soil\
    \ properties, soil moisture level, meteorological behaviour, etc.\nFunding: This\

    • The role of Internet of Things in arable farming is reviewed. • Internet of
    Things is leading arable farming to become data-driven. • Implementation and application
    are described in depth. • Challenges, corresponding solutions and potentials are
    discussed thoroughly. The Internet of Things is allowing agriculture, here specifically
    arable farming, to become data-driven, leading to more timely and cost-effective
    production and management of farms, and at the same time reducing their environmental
    impact. This review is addressing an analytical survey of the current and potential
    application of Internet of Things in arable farming, where spatial data, highly
    varying environments, task diversity and mobile devices pose unique challenges
    to be overcome compared to other agricultural systems. The review contributes
    an overview of the state of the art of technologies deployed. It provides an outline
    of the current and potential applications, and discusses the challenges and possible
    solutions and implementations. Lastly, it presents some future directions for
    the Internet of Things in arable farming. Current issues such as smart phones,
    intelligent management of Wireless Sensor Networks, middleware platforms, integrated
    Farm Management Information Systems across the supply chain, or autonomous vehicles
    and robotics stand out because of their potential to lead arable farming to smart
    arable farming. During the implementation, different challenges are encountered,
    and here interoperability is a key major hurdle throughout all the layers in the
    architecture of an Internet of Things system, which can be addressed by shared
    standards and protocols. Challenges such as affordability, device power consumption,
    network latency, Big Data analysis, data privacy and security, among others, have
    been identified by the articles reviewed and are discussed in detail. Different
    solutions to all identified challenges are presented addressing technologies such
    as machine learning, middleware platforms, or intelligent data management. Previous

    The global population and its food consumption are growing alarmingly quickly,
    while climate change effects are simultaneously complicating the challenge of
    ensuring food security in a sustainable manner (Godfray et al., 2010, Tilman et
    al., 2011). Data-driven agriculture is one of the main strategies and concepts
    proposed to increase production efficiently while decreasing its environmental
    impact (Foley et al., 2011). Data-driven technologies in general are quickly advancing
    with the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), and may become an important
    part of the future of farming (Brewster et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2016,
    Verdouw, 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Smart Farming, also called Agriculture 4.0
    or digital farming (CEMA, 2017), is developing beyond the modern concept of precision
    agriculture, which bases its management practices on spatial measurements largely
    thanks to Global Positioning System (GPS) signals. Smart farming bases its management
    tasks also on spatial data but is enhanced with context-awareness and is activated
    by real-time events, improving the performance of hitherto precision agriculture
    solutions (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Additionally, Smart
    Farming usually incorporates intelligent services for applying and managing Information
    and Communication Technologies (ICT) in farming, and allows transverse integration
    throughout the whole agri-food chain in regards to food safety and traceability
    (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). IoT is therefore a key technology in smart farming
    since it ensures data flow between sensors and other devices, making it possible
    to add value to the obtained data by automatic processing, analysis and access,
    and this leads to more timely and cost-effective production and management effort
    on farms. Simultaneously, IoT enables the reduction of the inherent environmental
    impact by real-time reaction to alert events such as weed, pest or disease detection,
    weather or soil monitoring warnings, which allow for a reduction and adequate
    use of inputs such as agrochemicals or water. IoT eases documentation and supervision
    of different activities as well as the traceability of products, improving the
    environmental surveying and control in farms by the appropriate authorities. The
    IoT concept was introduced by Kevin Ashton in 1999 in relation to linking Radio-Frequency
    Identification (RFID) for supply chains to the internet (Ashton, 2009), but has
    no official definition. It implies, however, the connection of a network of “things”
    to or through the internet without direct human intervention. “Things” can be
    any object with sensors and/or actuators that is uniquely addressable, interconnected
    and accessible through the world-wide computer network, i.e. the Internet. The
    application of IoT in agriculture is advantageous because of the possibility to
    monitor and control many different parameters in an interoperable, scalable and
    open context with an increasing use of heterogeneous automated components (Kamilaris,
    Gao, Prenafeta-Boldu, & Ali, 2016), in addition to the inevitable requirement
    for traceability. As a result of IoT, agriculture is becoming data-driven, i.e.
    making informed real-time decisions for managing the farm, reducing uncertainties
    and inefficiencies, and as a consequence reducing its environmental impact. The
    application of IoT in agriculture, also called Ag-IoT (Zhai, 2017), AIoT (Zou
    & Quan, 2017), or IoF meaning Internet of Farming (Alahmadi, Alwajeeh, Mohanan,
    & Budiarto, 2017) or Internet of Food and Farm (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), has received exponentially increasing attention in the scientific
    community (Fig. 1). Even though the publications are mainly dominated by Asian
    scientists (Talavera et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016), in Europe several large scale
    international pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019), are aiming to implement IoT technologies in the agricultural
    industry in Europe. Similar projects elsewhere include the Accelerating Precision
    Agriculture to Decision Agriculture (P2D) project in Australia (Zhang, Baker,
    Jakku, & Llewellyn, 2017), which complement additional major investments with
    the aim to help farmers convert to smart farming (Higgins et al., 2017, Pham and
    Stack, 2018). Download : Download high-res image (95KB) Download : Download full-size

    searching criteria: (Internet of things OR IoT) AND (agriculture OR farming).
    Several reviews have been done on IoT in agriculture in the relatively short time
    period in which publications about the subject have emerged (Ray, 2017, Stočes
    et al., 2016, Talavera et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). In
    addition, review papers have been published with a focus on specific subjects
    related to IoT applied in agriculture, such as Big Data (Kamilaris et al., 2017,
    Wolfert et al., 2017), modelling (O''Grady & O''Hare, 2017), Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN) (Jawad, Nordin, Gharghan, Jawad, & Ismail, 2017), food supply chain (Ramundo,
    Taisch, & Terzi, 2016), Internet of Underground Things (Vuran, Salam, Wong, &
    Irmak, 2018), chemical wireless sensors (Kassal, Steinberg, & Murkovi, 2018),
    or Farm Management Information Systems (FMIS) (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015;
    Kaloxylos et al., 2012). However, to the authors'' knowledge, no existing review
    has focused on arable farming, which has specific characteristics and challenges
    that differ from those in a controlled environment, i.e. greenhouses, or permanent
    crops such as fruit orchards. Arable farming poses particular challenges due to:
    • much larger farm sizes, which affect the design of the sensor networks, the
    data processing, analysis and extrapolation of limited stationary sensor data,
    and the consequent decision making with regards to actuators, vehicle logistics,
    etc.; • the larger farm sizes also imply that spatial data has a central role
    in arable farming, affecting the data processing, decision making and precision
    machinery employed to address in-field variability not at plant level as in most
    permanent crops, but at subfield level with automatic recognition and actuation
    (Zude-Sasse, Fountas, Gemtos, & Abu-Khalaf, 2016); • greater use of mobile sensors
    and other devices on vehicles, which have specific challenges. While other cropping
    systems may also use sensors and devices on operating machinery, arable farming
    often requires a fleet of vehicles to operate in a co-ordinated fashion. This
    creates issues particularly regarding network infrastructure (Martínez, Pastor,
    Álvarez, & Iborra, 2016), e.g. connectivity to the cloud of moving things that
    rely mainly on mobile networks, or vehicle to implement communication, which implies
    real-time interoperability between machines and devices from different manufacturers
    (Peets, Mouazen, Blackburn, Kuang, & Wiebensohn, 2012); • larger amounts of heterogeneous
    spatial data generated at different rates and from very disparate sources: stationary
    sensors, moving vehicles and implements, satellites, data from web services, etc.,
    which need to be intelligently integrated; • highly varying and uncertain environmental
    conditions, as annual crops are more susceptible to weather changes and other
    external factors than permanent crops, which are more resilient mainly due to
    their deeper roots (Zude-Sasse et al., 2016), or crops in controlled environments.
    This obligates the IoT system to handle both spatial and temporal data, increasing
    the complexity of the data processing as well as the decisions based on the data
    collected. • more diverse types of field tasks per growing season in arable farming,
    from soil preparation and crop establishment, through highly varying plant nursing
    tasks, to coordinated harvest, which increase the complexity and also the risks.
    The IoT in agriculture is a fast-developing field, which can make reviews obsolete
    quickly. This challenge can be overcome by focussing a critical view on the general
    principles, main application areas and identify the limitations and challenges.
    Summarising, the aim of the paper is to provide an up to date novel analytical
    review of the role of IoT in arable farming, with the following specific objectives:
    • Provide an overview of the current situation of IoT technologies deployed in
    arable farming. Focussing on the current use of communication technologies and
    protocols, the generation and analysis of data, and IoT architectures. • Outline
    the different applications and capabilities of IoT in arable farming. • Investigate
    the main challenges encountered by IoT enabling technologies applied to arable
    farming. • Present key potential fields of application where IoT could be employed,
    as well as future directions of the current trends. The remaining part of this
    paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the methodology used in this
    review paper. Section 3 provides an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies
    used in arable farming; Section 4 presents an outline of the current and potential
    IoT-based applications in arable farming; Section 5 discusses the challenges and
    solutions found in its implementation; and lastly, the review closes with Section
    6 in which future directions are summarised. 2. Review methodology In order to
    address the specific objectives identified above, the literature listing from
    the SCOPUS database of the last 11 years has been reviewed. More precisely, the
    timeframe investigated was from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2018, selected as
    the whole period in which any literature about the subject turned up in the studied
    database. SCOPUS was selected as the primary literature source as it is a key
    peer-reviewed research literature database. The specific keywords used in the
    search criteria where: (Internet of Things OR IoT) AND (agriculture OR farming).
    To ease the searching process, the keywords needed to be present in at least the
    title, abstract, highlights or keywords. Additionally, the articles had to be
    published in English. Articles concerning greenhouse, livestock or permanent crops
    were excluded from the survey, as were supply chain related articles. However,
    issues concerning traceability at farm level were included. The survey was performed
    in a systematic manner following three steps (see Fig. 2): • Firstly, a list of
    1193 articles meeting the search criteria mentioned above was retrieved from the
    database. • In the second step, by reading the titles, any article that was clearly
    not related to arable farming was excluded, leaving a list of 293 articles. •
    In the last step, a second screening was made by reading the abstracts, where
    articles outside the focus of this review were omitted. After this step, 167 articles
    were studied in detail, from which 69 articles were considered relevant, 27 as
    partially relevant, while the rest were considered of little relevance. Relevance
    concerned mainly the connection of the article to the subject studied. The content
    of a relevant article directly addresses the application of an IoT technology
    in an arable farming scenario. A partially relevant article studies a certain
    IoT technology in agriculture in a broader sense. In the distinction made regarding
    little relevant articles included off-topic, lack of novelty, as well as non-peer-reviewed
    articles that lacked scientific rigour, e.g. ambiguous information or absence
    of materials or methods description. Download : Download high-res image (208KB)

    The final 167 articles studied included: 77 journal papers, 88 conference papers
    and 4 book chapters, of which 19 were review papers. The final list of articles
    was complemented with other publications that expanded on some of the IoT related
    subjects and technologies mentioned in the studied articles, and did not contain
    the specified keywords. These were found by a targeted search for specific subjects.
    Lastly, in each article from the final list a special focus was made on the IoT
    technologies employed, the applications, the challenges encountered and, finally,
    on potential future perspectives. 3. IoT implementation in arable farming IoT
    has recently been gaining momentum in the farming industry as it can fulfil the
    urgent necessity for interoperability across brands, scalability and traceability
    (Kamilaris et al., 2016). Different technologies are implemented as IoT is still
    evolving, adapting to a great diversity of uses. To cover the range of technologies,
    protocols, standards, etc. employed, this review is addressing the layers in the
    IoT architecture. Three layers normally describe the architecture of the IoT in
    the literature reviewed (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Khattab et al., 2016,
    Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Na and Isaac, 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw,
    2016), though some authors divide it into more layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Ramundo et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Talavera et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2014),
    depending on their definitions. More than three layers can especially be relevant
    in IoT systems with edge or fog computing, where an edge/fog computing layer can
    be considered in between the device and network layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016). Even though the naming of the layers also varies depending on the author,
    there is nonetheless a general trend to divide the layers into device, network
    and application layers (Fig. 3). Thus, this has been the adapted structure in
    this review. The device layer consists of the physical objects (things) that are
    capable of automatic identification, sensing or actuation, and connection to the
    internet. The network layer communicates the data to a gateway (or proxy server)
    to the internet (cloud) by the use of communication protocols. And the application
    layer typically stores and facilitates access for the end-user to the processed/analysed
    information. Download : Download high-res image (222KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 3. IoT architecture represented by device, network and application
    layer, in which the middleware platform is not always present. The collected data
    experience diverse stages during their transition from sensors to cloud, interfaces,
    and occasionally actuators, and these stages have considerable influence on the
    technologies applied in an IoT context. Six main stages regarding data flow have
    been identified in the literature reviewed: sensing/perception, communication/transport/transfer,
    storage, processing, analytics, and actuation and display (Fig. 4). The order
    of the stages is different depending on the IoT setup employed and the computing
    techniques used, e.g. fog and edge computing processes the data before communicating
    it to the cloud, an example of its application in precision farming is given by
    Ferrández-Pastor et al. (2016); while cloud computing processes the data in the
    cloud, examples of this are given by Hernandez-Rojas, Mazon-Olivo, Novillo-Vicuña,
    and Belduma-Vacacela (2018) and Na and Isaac (2016). Nonetheless, sensing/perception
    is normally the first stage, where data are captured by sensors, then the data
    can follow different paths and does not necessarily go through all the steps listed.
    In summary, IoT data is identified to be gathered or generated through three main
    processes: machine generated, which come from sensing devices; process-mediated,
    i.e. commercial data coming from business processes; and human-sourced, recorded
    by humans and digitalised later on (Balducci, Impedovo, Informatica, & Moro, 2018).
    These different sources have an influence on how to process, analyse and use the
    data in IoT solutions, and this needs to be taken into account in the overall
    data acquisition planning process. Download : Download high-res image (171KB)

    in arable farming. 3.1. Device layer As mentioned above, the device layer consists
    of the physical objects (things) that are capable of automatic identification,
    sensing or actuating, and providing connection to the internet. Sensor devices
    measure and collect one or more parameters automatically and transmit the data
    wirelessly to the cloud. And, when the devices become actuators, they generally,
    in turn, receive data from the cloud in order to activate or deactivate some mechanical
    component, e.g. a valve in an irrigation system. The device layer is also often
    called perception layer (Tzounis et al., 2017, Zou and Quan, 2017), sensing layer
    (Na and Isaac, 2016, Wang et al., 2014), or physical layer (Ramundo et al., 2016,
    Talavera et al., 2017). The devices are constituted of a transceiver, a microcontroller,
    an interfacing circuit and one or more sensors and/or actuators. The sensor measures
    a physical parameter, e.g. air temperature that is interpreted and transformed
    into an equivalent analogue signal, i.e. electric voltage or current, which is
    then converted by the interfacing circuit, i.e. Analogue-to-Digital Converter
    (ADC), into a corresponding digital format. Afterwards, the microcontroller, sometimes
    also in the form of microprocessors or single-board computers (Talavera et al.,
    2017), collects the data in digital format from one or more sensors through the
    ADC, and sends them to the transceiver, i.e. a wireless communication module,
    which communicates the data to a gateway. A comparison of microcontrollers and
    single-board computers used in IoT in agriculture has been made by Ray (2017).
    In the case of edge computing, the microcontroller or single-board computer processes
    the data from one or more sensors before communicating them, with the intention
    of, for example, reducing the amount of data to be transferred to the cloud and
    accelerating the data processing (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et
    al., 2016). In fog computing the data are processed in the local area network
    level, i.e. in a fog node or IoT gateway (Ahmed, Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed,
    De et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018). When employing an actuator, the
    signal is received by the transceiver, communicated to the microcontroller, where
    it is then converted to analogue signal by a Digital-to-Analogue Converter (DAC),
    i.e. the interfacing circuit, or to a digital signal by a Digital-to-Digital Converter,
    and finally interpreted by the actuator, which acts in accordance to the signal
    received. In arable farming, when agricultural machinery data are used, i.e. data
    from sensors and devices mounted on tractors or other agricultural machinery,
    the data in digital format is normally collected and accessible through the Controller
    Area Network (CAN) bus in the machine, although in some cases some data are accessible
    through other ports (Oksanen et al., 2016, Peets et al., 2012). Machine and operator
    performance information is accessible through the Machine and Implement Control
    System (MICS) of the machine, which can also be accessed through the CAN bus data.
    MICS data are used to allow machinery operators and farm managers to monitor and
    potentially improve the efficiency of their machines, by employing e.g. smart
    alerts or recommendation systems (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015). Global Navigation Satellite
    System (GNSS) data, e.g. Real Time Kinematics GPS (RTK-GPS), are often also available
    through the CAN bus port, which allows, among others, vehicle monitoring and dynamic
    optimised route planning Edwards et al., 2017, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018. Many
    different sensors and actuators are employed in arable farming. The type of device
    used depends on the purpose of the system in addition to the technologies implemented
    in the system. And the number of devices is steadily increasing. The number of
    IoT device installations in farms is expected to increase globally from 30 million
    installations in 2015 to 75 million in 2020. Furthermore, data points generated
    per day and farm are expected to increase from 190000 in 2014 to over half a million
    by 2020 (Meola, 2016). It was also estimated that by 2018 there would be 10 billion
    IoT devices employed in agriculture. However, the great amount of data generated
    is often unused or underutilised (Bennett, 2015), e.g. in countries like Denmark
    with a relative high ICT adoption in farms, in 2016 only 2–5% of farmers worked
    actively with the data generated (SEGES, 2016). Even if data usage is still relatively
    low, it is expected to increase rapidly (Bennett, 2015, Wolfert et al., 2017,
    World Bank, 2017) An overview about how they are implemented for different purposes
    is presented in the Applications section. 3.2. Network layer The network layer
    communicates the data initially to an intermediary platform and eventually to
    the internet (cloud), and from there to, for example, employed actuators. When
    the data are transferred to the intermediary platform, it typically uses wireless
    communication technologies, for instance RFID, WSN with Zigbee, LoRa (Long Range),
    etc., and more recently Near-Field Communication (NFC) (Kassal et al., 2018, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). The intermediary platform
    is normally an internet gateway located in the vicinity of the connected devices,
    also including sometimes a proxy server, where the data are collected and occasionally
    processed in order to send the information further to the end user through the
    internet by the use of e.g. MQTT standards, or HTML or XMPP protocols. The use
    of Android smart devices or other operating systems is also increasing in popularity
    among agricultural applications, as they can be employed as a gateway for 3G and
    4G networks, and they frequently include other wireless communication technologies,
    e.g. Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPRS and NFC. They also automatically conform to communication
    standards and protocols, in which way interoperability is increased (Balmos et
    al., 2016, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Gao and Yao, 2016, Hernandez-Rojas et
    al., 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). In addition, Android and other smart
    devices can include GNSS and RGB camera sensors, and can relatively easily be
    programmed for computing data and displaying Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications
    being able to straightforwardly update the software if necessary. In that manner,
    Android and similar smart devices are represented in all three IoT layers, i.e.
    sensing in the device layer, node or gateway in the network layer, and computing
    data and displaying GUI in the application layer. Furthermore, the automatic software
    updating possibilities of smart devices allow remote installation of updates with
    new functionalities, bug fixes, etc. and easily improve the interoperability of
    the system (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). Many different wireless technologies
    have been applied for diverse purposes in agriculture, depending on economic,
    accessibility and capability factors. Jawad et al., 2017, Ray, 2017 and Tzounis
    et al. (2017) have presented good overviews of the specifications of wireless
    communication technologies implemented in IoT in an agricultural context, which
    have been here collected in Table 1 and complemented with information from other
    relevant articles (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Elijah et al., 2018, Kassal et al.,
    2018, Sinha et al., 2017, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). The great variety of technologies,
    standards and frequency bands used exposes the relevant interoperability and application
    challenges found when applying IoT technologies. Potential communication standards
    for smart farming can be classified into short-range and long-range according
    to their communication distance, which determines their specific usability in
    different requirement settings. This is particularly the case in arable farming,
    where mobile network accessibility can be an issue in many rural areas, and where
    large farm sizes limit the use of some wireless technologies due to their reduced
    communication distance and due to the necessity to replace/recharge device batteries
    on nodes over large areas. These issues are addressed in the challenges section
    later. Table 1. Wireless communication technologies (adapted from Jawad et al.,

    m 1 mW a Not yet publicly available. A WSN is formed by pervasive devices called
    motes or sensor nodes, which integrate sensors and actuators that communicate
    wirelessly forming a spatial network (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). In a WSN, base stations act as gateways forwarding
    the data to the cloud. Different communication technologies support different
    network node architectures, e.g. star, tree or mesh. Depending on the application,
    different wireless communication technologies are employed in a WSN as each has
    different node architecture possibilities, data rates, ranges, standards, among
    others, with the use of ZigBee, LoRa, Bluetooth/BLE, WiFi and SigFox being relatively
    common in agriculture. In arable farming, BLE has for example been employed for
    soil and air monitoring and irrigation control (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018);
    ZigBee was used in a WSN for monitoring soil conditions and actuating an irrigation
    system (Mafuta et al., 2012) and crop monitoring (Zhai, 2017); and LoRa for air
    and water temperature of rice paddy fields (Tanaka, 2018) and smart irrigation
    control (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018). In order to cover
    larger distances, GPRS is appropriate and has been used for irrigation control
    (López-Riquelme et al., 2017), and for remote maintenance of machinery (Miettinen,
    Oksanen, Suomi, & Visala, 2006). GPRS, or other technologies, such as LTE, or
    3G/4G, are also commonly used at the gateway to transmit data to the cloud. Regarding
    other less common communication technologies used in WSNs, RFID can be integrated
    into a WSN too by connecting the RFID tag readers to a radio-frequency transceiver
    (Costa et al., 2013). Passive and active RFID technologies are used to a great
    extent in agricultural research and industry (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), especially
    for animal production (e.g. Kamilaris et al., 2016), as well as vegetable or fruit
    product traceability (e.g. Kodali, Jain, & Karagwal, 2017); however, in arable
    farming only few examples have been found: e.g. RFID tags used for irrigation
    scheduling (Vellidis, Tucker, Perry, Kvien, & Bednarz, 2008), for agrochemical
    traceability (Peets, Gasparin, Blackburn, & Godwin, 2009), for vehicle monitoring
    (Sjolander, Thomasson, Sui, & Ge, 2011), and even on a prototype for soil temperature
    monitoring (Hamrita & Hoffacker, 2005). Regarding NFC, no concrete examples of
    NFC used in arable farming have been found in the literature reviewed. Finally,
    the latest generation of mobile communications, i.e. 5G, has higher data rates,
    large coverage areas, higher peak throughput, and also improved flexibility, which
    can open new possibilities and may solve some of the challenges encountered by
    many IoT solutions (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Marsch et al., 2016). 5G allows new
    options for monitoring rural areas with no previous infrastructure for Internet
    connection (Faraci, Raciti, Rizzo, & Schembra, 2018). 5G can also improve vehicle-to-vehicle
    or vehicle-to-anything communication in e.g. logistics solutions, due to its low
    latency and new frequency bands (Marsch et al., 2016). A challenge for the 5G
    networks will be the great increase in devices to support once IoT becomes a standard
    solution not only in agriculture, but also in any sphere of everyday life. 3.3.
    Application layer The application layer is crucial in an IoT context as it is
    this layer that actually adds value to the sensed and communicated data through
    directly controlling devices, supporting farmers'' decision making, etc. In this
    layer, several important services occur such as data storage, data analytics,
    data access through an appropriate Application Programming Interface (API), as
    well as possibly a user interfaced software application. The layer may also include
    middleware platforms that aid handling the heterogeneous cloud data improving
    interoperability. Data storage can be cloud based, i.e. on multiple servers, or
    more local based, where data are stored in different types of databases, depending
    on the application and design. Even if relational databases, such as Structured
    Query Language (SQL) databases (Gao and Yao, 2016, Goap et al., 2018, Ray, 2017,
    Wang et al., 2014), MySQL (Kaloxylos et al., 2014), or PostgreSQL (Mazon-Olivo,
    Hernández-Rojas, Maza-Salinas, & Pan, 2018) are employed in some of the reported
    applications in the reviewed articles, non-relational databases, such as Not only
    SQL (NoSQL), or also SPARQL, a semantic query language based database, are gaining
    attention due to their flexibility and scalability, especially when dealing with
    Big Data. Their ability to store and manage large amounts of heterogeneous data
    makes them suitable in many IoT agricultural contexts (Huang and Zhang, 2017,
    Kamilaris et al., 2017). Examples of NoSQL employed in agriculture are Cassandra
    (Huang & Zhang, 2017), Dynamo (Xian, 2017), HBase (Ray, 2017, Wang et al., 2014)
    and MongoDB (Martínez et al., 2016). An example of SPARQL has been given by Jayaraman
    et al. (2016). Data analytics can be achieved by cloud computing, where computer
    resources are managed remotely to analyse data, often Big Data, or by distributed
    computing, e.g. edge and fog computing. Cloud computing has the advantage that
    it provides high quality services that allow independent execution of multiple
    applications as if they were isolated, even if they are on the same platform,
    e.g. in data centres, which is especially relevant when dealing with Big Data
    (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Martínez et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017). However,
    cloud computing techniques mostly rely on general purpose cloud providers that
    do not comply with specific agricultural service requirements (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017) and can experience latency issues, which are not acceptable in IoT
    solutions where monitoring, control and analysis require fast performance (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2018). Examples of application of cloud computing related to arable farming
    are given by Khattab et al., 2016, Na and Isaac, 2016 and López-Riquelme et al.
    (2017). Khattab et al. (2016) present an IoT architecture with a cloud-based back-end
    where weather and soil data are processed and analysed for automatic activation
    of irrigation and spraying actions. Na and Isaac (2016) describe a human-centric
    IoT architecture with a list of cloud services, such as language translation,
    data simplification or updated market price information. And López-Riquelme et
    al. (2017) use FIWARE components for a cloud service for smart irrigation tasks,
    focussing on the benefits of using FIWARE as cloud provider. Regarding Big Data
    analysis and Big Data in general in an agricultural context, Kamilaris et al.
    (2017) and Wolfert et al. (2017) respectively have performed exhaustive reviews
    on the subject. The use of IoT middleware platforms is gaining interest due to
    its potential for solving different challenges found in the application of IoT,
    especially interoperability. IoT middleware platforms try to simplify the complex
    communication through the cloud due to heterogeneity of devices, communications
    and networks, by using enablers like standardised APIs and protocols (Jayaraman
    et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017). Examples of
    these are HYDRA, UBIWARE, UBIROAD, UBIDOTS, SMEPP, SIXTH, Think Speak, SensorCloud,
    Amazon IoT and IBM IoT, with focus on context aware functionality; SOCRADES, GSN
    and SIRENA, with more focus on security and privacy; Aneka, WSO2, PubNub, SmartFarmNet
    and FIWARE, with a wider services-oriented approach; and projects like IoT-A,
    OpenIoT, or ArrowHead (Gill et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2015, Jayaraman et
    al., 2016, Kamilaris et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016). Even if all these and more solutions are found in the IoT market,
    an intelligent middleware solution that addresses most issues observed in smart
    farming successfully is yet to be implemented (Jayaraman et al., 2016, Martínez
    et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). However, FIWARE (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    López-Riquelme et al., 2017, Martínez et al., 2016, Rodriguez et al., 2018) and
    SmartFarmNet (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Jayaraman et al., 2016) have been
    implemented effectively for precision and smart farming applications. In order
    to communicate data across platforms and IoT devices, ensuring interoperability,
    APIs are essential. These should adapt to evolving or new standards in order to
    ensure a longer life span, which may become a limitation if the APIs are not updated.
    It is through the APIs that data are made available for the IoT applications (e.g.
    Goap et al., 2018, Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018). These services may include tracing,
    monitoring, event management, forecasting or optimisation for agricultural activities
    and products. These applications related to arable farming are described in the
    next section. 4. Current and potential applications Multiple applications can
    be derived from the implementation of IoT in arable farming. These applications
    can always be conceptualised into the three IoT layers described previously, and
    are not to be confused with the application layer. Elaborations of the reviewed
    articles show that the applications have been differentiated and categorised as
    follows: monitoring, documentation, forecasting and controlling. Monitoring refers
    to timely sensing of very diverse parameters and is mostly the initial point of
    entry for other applications. Documentation covers the storing of sampled data
    for later use in e.g. farm management or traceability of produce. Forecasting
    employs different sources of data through precisely designed analytic methods
    for predicting concrete events. And controlling is the result of active monitoring,
    where processed data are used to automatically activate and control actuators
    in a predefined manner. A summarising table collects all the IoT applications
    in arable farming described in this chapter (Table 2). Most IoT-based systems
    include at least two of these applications and isolated applications are seldom
    seen. In addition, special attention has been paid to FMIS and associated decision
    support to improve operations and production processes involving vehicle positioning
    analytics, optimisation and logistics, which are key elements in arable farming
    (Bochtis et al., 2011, Bochtis et al., 2014) and have consequently got a section
    of their own. Table 2. IoT applications in arable farming. Applications Examples

    Automatic monitoring is the obvious first step in IoT applied to agriculture.
    Strategically placed sensors can automatically sense and transmit data to the
    cloud for further documentation, forecasting or controlling applications. Sensors
    are used to monitor crop parameters such as leaf area index (e.g. Bauer & Aschenbruck,
    2018), plant height and leaf colour, size and shape (e.g. Okayasu et al., 2017);
    soil parameters such as soil moisture (e.g. Brinkhoff et al., 2017, Kodali and
    Sahu, 2016) or soil chemistry (e.g. Kassal et al., 2018); irrigation water parameters
    such as pH and salinity (e.g. Popović et al., 2017); or weather parameters such
    as air temperature, air pressure, air relative humidity, rainfall, radiation,
    wind speed and wind direction (e.g. Yan et al., 2018). In addition, remote sensing
    can also be employed, i.e. instead of sensors placed in the field they are installed
    on satellites or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). However, these measurements mostly
    require some form of processing and interpretation as the values sampled are not
    directly related to the targeted parameters. An example of monitoring through
    remote sensing is the estimation of crop biomass and nitrogen content by the use
    of hyper- and multispectral images (Näsi et al., 2018), or the use of thermal
    remote sensing, which has been applied for e.g. irrigation scheduling or plant
    disease detection (Khanal, Fulton, & Shearer, 2017). Furthermore, agricultural
    machinery can also be remotely monitored, e.g. vehicle position and yield data
    (Oksanen et al., 2016), or machine performance (Miettinen et al., 2006). This
    is especially relevant with the increasing appearance of autonomous vehicles and
    robots in agriculture (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). Finally, at farm level the storage
    of crops can also be monitored to ensure the correct control of, for example,
    temperature and moisture, and avoid losses due to damage (Green et al., 2009,
    Juul et al., 2015). Environmental impact indicators should be integrated into
    farm monitoring applications, so that leaching (Burton, Dave, Fernandez, Jayachandran,
    & Bhansali, 2018), contaminants (Severino, D’Urso, Scarfato, & Toraldo, 2018)
    or emissions (Manap & Najib, 2014) are addressed too. 4.2. Documentation and traceability
    Collected operations and process data once stored can be used for documentation.
    Documentation is usually the natural application of monitored data but it must
    be noted that it can also include other types of sampled data, such as manually
    input or documentation of performed control actions (Sørensen, Pesonen, Bochtis,
    Vougioukas, & Suomi, 2011). The data are stored as raw data or as processed data
    at different levels. Documentation is essential for decision-making, controlling
    or analytics, and is an indispensable element in FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    Mapping is also a form of documentation where data are spatially projected onto
    a map. On-the-go sensors installed on vehicles and implements can be used for
    automated field mapping (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015), e.g. yield mapping used
    for later fertilisation planning (Lyle, Bryan, & Ostendorf, 2014), or soil mapping
    for site-specific amendment measures (Godwin and Miller, 2003, McBratney et al.,
    2003). Remote sensing can also be used for mapping crop development (Khanal et
    al., 2017, Näsi et al., 2018, Viljanen et al., 2018), or soil texture and residue
    coverage (Khanal et al., 2017). Remote sensing is becoming a popular tool for
    monitoring and mapping, but is yet to be proven feasible for all its potential
    applications. When documentation data sets extend beyond the farm level so that
    they can be traced throughout the supply chain, it is often referred as traceability
    and this notion is a key element in agri-food supply chain management as a measure
    to satisfy, for example, consumer demands (Bochtis and Sørensen, 2014, Pesonen
    et al., 2014). 4.3. Forecasting Forecasting is one of the fundamental functions
    for decision making that IoT brings to agriculture. Access to “real-time” data
    and historical data is used for forecasting events that require some form of action
    for managing successfully the crop or field operation. Therefore, both monitoring
    and documentation are important prerequisites for enabling forecasting. Forecasting
    is employed as preventive measures that require some action due to a predicted
    event, e.g. weeding, irrigating or harvesting. Machine learning and scientific
    modelling are examples of tools employed for forecasting. Different machine learning
    models have been employed, e.g. Artificial Neural Networks for forecasting maximum
    and minimum temperatures at field level (Aliev, 2018) or for estimating levels
    of phosphorus (P) in the soil (Estrada-López, Castillo-Atoche, Vázquez-castillo,
    & Sánchez-Sinencio, 2018); support vector regression method for forecasting soil
    moisture (Goap et al., 2018) or plant disease detection (Aasha Nandhini, Hemalatha,
    Radha, & Indumathi, 2017); gradient boosting for predicting irrigation recommendations
    (Goldstein, Fink, & Meitin, 2018); Bayesian networks and random forest for frost
    prediction (Diedrichs, Bromberg, Dujovne, Brun-laguna, & Watteyne, 2018); multiple
    linear regression and random forest in estimating yield and fertilisation requirements
    for forecasting harvest and fertilisation dates (Viljanen et al., 2018); or also
    for frost prediction using four different machine learning algorithms: decision
    tree, boosted tree, random forest, and regression (Moon, Kim, Zhang, & Woo, 2018).
    A rather different forecasting approach was employed by Jain, Sarangi, Bhatt,
    and Pappula (2018), where three different models, i.e. random forest, support
    vector machine and artificial neural network were used for forecasting diseases
    and at the same time for adaptive data collection from the network of nodes in
    order to reduce data traffic and energy consumption of the network. Summarising,
    IoT is allowing the sampling of large amounts of data, which can be employed as
    training data by the machine learning algorithms to build predictive mathematical
    models. Machine learning is opening new possibilities for effectively forecasting
    events in arable farming, which might change the very nature of decision making
    in agriculture. Scientific modelling has also been employed for forecasting in
    an IoT context, e.g. soil moisture dynamics and contaminant migration forecasting
    using soil sensor data and precipitation forecasts for irrigation scheduling (Severino
    et al., 2018); fungal disease forecast in winter wheat (El Jarroudi et al., 2017)
    and barley (Mäyrä, Ruusunen, Jalli, Jauhiainen, & Leiviskä, 2018); or forecasting
    field trafficability and workability for field operations (Edwards, White, Munkholm,
    Sørensen, & Lamandé, 2016). These modelling tools have an important role in agriculture
    as they are conscientiously developed and validated by the scientific community,
    and can forecast events for which machine learning models are very limited. There
    is also considerable potential for integrating existing and acknowledged modelling
    tools such as the soil-crop-atmosphere system model DAISY (Abrahamsen & Hansen,
    2000) or the soil erosion model RUSLE (Renard, Foster, Weesies, & Porter, 1991)
    into an IoT solution. Many of these solutions can make agriculture in general,
    and arable farming in particular, more resource efficient, e.g. through smart
    irrigation, as well as environmentally friendly, e.g. by smart pest and disease
    management. 4.4. Controlling In IoT, controlling is the result of active monitoring
    in an automated system, where the monitored variables are automatically adjusted
    to, for example, predefined thresholds. Forecasting can also play an important
    role in controlling. This is, for example, the case in smart irrigation systems,
    where irrigation is activated before drought damage in the crop is recognised,
    thus reducing yield losses. Goap et al. (2018) employed real-time sensing of soil
    moisture and soil temperature in combination with weather forecasts to control
    a fully autonomous irrigation scheme. Sensors on-the-go installed in tractors
    and implements can also be used to control e.g. variable rate fertilisation (Peets
    et al., 2012), site-specific weed control technologies (Christensen et al., 2009),
    or in-row cultivation controlled by plant patterns in precision seeding (Midtiby,
    Steen, & Green, 2018). Controlling is crucial in smart farming as it allows the
    automation of systems, especially considering the operations of autonomous vehicles
    and robots in the fields (Bechar & Vigneault, 2016), where site-specific actions
    and sensing-based safety systems will play an important role, e.g. for in-field
    obstacle detection for autonomous vehicles (Christiansen, Nielsen, Steen, Jørgensen,
    & Karstoft, 2016). 4.5. FMIS FMIS can be defined as systems that store and process
    farm-related collected data and provide decision supporting tools for farm management
    (Paraforos et al., 2016). FMIS assist farmers in the execution and documentation
    of farm activities, their evaluation and optimisation, as well as in strategic,
    tactical and operational planning of the farm operations (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    FMIS are consequently systems that can encapsulate all the applications previously
    described, and are vital elements in smart farm management. However, the adoption
    of FMIS targeted to the new IoT technologies is slow. A study published in 2015
    showed that most FMIS architectures used at that time had been designed in the
    1980s by researchers. This may explain why most FMIS currently have a structure
    and an architecture that is not suitable for distributed and service oriented
    decision support required for supporting precision agriculture and smart farming
    solutions, e.g. 75% of FMIS are still PC-based, and functionalities regarding
    traceability, quality assurance and agronomic best practice estimate are still
    missing or in their initial development stages in most commercial FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al., 2015). FMIS are key in smart farming and they should support
    automatic data acquisition, monitoring, documenting, planning and decision making
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). The latest research on IoT-based FMIS is expected
    to become part of the commercial FMIS available in the near future and will cover
    different needs across the supply chain and needs of IoT-based agriculture as
    a whole, as well as complying with standards ensuring interoperability between
    systems. In addition, decision support systems (DSS) are essential in dealing
    with Big Data and assisting the farm manager in management and decision making
    in tasks such as farm financial analysis, business processes or supply chain functions
    (Fountas, Carli et al., 2015, Kaloxylos et al., 2012). In order to design an up-to-date
    FMIS, it is beneficial to make preliminary use of dedicated system analysis methodologies,
    such as soft system methodologies (SSM), for identifying required changes and
    constraints and proposing solutions, followed by a later hard system modelling
    for designing the required specifications and components of the system (Sørensen
    et al., 2010, Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015). It is also necessary to base FMIS
    on the cloud as it allows interconnection with diverse additional services (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). This development points out the inevitable need for standardisation
    of APIs in order to achieve interoperability among applications and services as
    part of the FMIS. New technologies such as distributed management systems can
    also enhance the capabilities of FMIS to a great extent (Fountas, Sørensen et
    al., 2015). Furthermore, the introduction of agricultural moving robots in the
    near future, as well as the wireless and automatic control and monitoring of agricultural
    machinery, also needs to be considered in the design and development of FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al, 2015, Paraforos et al., 2016). The future FMIS will also be capable
    of emulating farmers different work habits, as the system will automate certain
    tasks previously performed by farmers, which will require additional training
    (Sørensen et al., 2011). Consequently, it is important to provide supportive adoption
    and transition strategies for conventional farming to convert into smart farming
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). Examples of current FMIS employed in arable farming
    are offered by different technology providers: machine manufacturers, institutions
    or targeted private companies. Some manufacturers provide their own farm management
    tools, such as Agricultural Management Solutions (AMS) from John Deere, or Precision
    Land Management (PLM) from New Holland. Across brands some FMIS have a more local
    approach, e.g. the Dutch Akkerweb developed by Wageningen University and Research,
    while other commercial solutions have a global approach, e.g. 365FarmNet, Agworld
    or FarmWorks. 4.6. Vehicle navigation, optimisation and logistics Navigation systems
    are widely used in arable farming with the successful implementation of auto-steering
    systems in tractors and harvesters. However, IoT-based solutions are still in
    their early stages. IoT-based field operation monitoring (Oksanen et al., 2016)
    or monitoring of motor and machine performance (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015) have been
    effectively implemented on harvesting operations. Commercial examples of agricultural
    telematics are Trimble''s Connected Farm, AGCO''s AgCommand, John Deer JDLink,
    New Holland''s PLM Connect or CLAAS’ telematics; however, they are all closed
    systems, which limits greatly the possibilities of the IoT technologies, especially
    interoperability (Oksanen, Piirainen, & Seilonen, 2015). Regarding optimised route
    planning, pre-planning harvest operations based on field data using simulation
    models can improve the harvest capacity of the vehicle or fleet saving working
    hours as well as fuel consumption (Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Bochtis and Sørensen,
    2009, Busato et al., 2007, Jensen et al., 2012, Zhou et al., 2014). However, field
    complexity and vehicle fleet size can become major hurdles for the algorithms
    employed (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019, Skou-Nielsen et al., 2017). The accessibility
    of field and harvest data can be eased by IoT technologies that allow automated
    data collection and sharing via common communication protocols and standards,
    in interoperable data formats, with compatible data model hierarchies; however,
    this is not always the case (Tzounis et al., 2017). IoT also allows cloud or fog
    computing to be employed to solve the high computational requirements of these
    route planning models (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019), even though the computing can
    also be achieved at the edge (Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Data communication
    costs, latency problems and unstable mobile connectivity may pose important challenges
    for route planning applications that rely only on cloud computing, making mobile
    edge computing more adequate and robust for these systems. Nevertheless, true
    IoT-based dynamic route planning is still in its infancy but gaining increasing
    attention, especially with the arrival of agricultural robots (Bechar and Vigneault,
    2016, Kayacan et al., 2015). Concerning its application, until recently, harvest
    logistics has employed field sampled data, i.e. boundaries, obstacles, gates,
    etc., to optimise the route of the vehicles involved in the operation statically
    (e.g. Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Jensen et al., 2012), where the complete routes
    of all vehicles are planned a priori. Nevertheless, these plans often do not comply
    with real-world challenges as they do not adapt to variating inputs, e.g. vehicle
    speed changes or in-field yield variations, or to unforeseen situations, e.g.
    machine breakdowns, eventual out of field delays, non-trafficable wet spots, undefined
    obstacles, etc. There is consequently the need to integrate route optimisation
    and operation logistics in IoT systems, where the optimisation can adapt dynamically
    to varying input and unforeseen events. It is only in the last few years that
    harvest logistics really started adapting dynamically to parameters such as vehicles''
    behaviour or in-field yield variations (Edwards et al., 2017, Seyyedhasani and
    Dvorak, 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Today, new possibilities for optimising
    infield operations arrive with the large amount of data available via internet,
    e.g. remote sensing data or other collected spatial data. These could be adaptive
    planning based on trafficability maps for reducing soil compaction or avoiding
    vehicles getting stuck in wet spots; or selective harvesting based on predicted
    grain quality maps, which is expected to increase the value of the crop harvested.
    5. Challenges and solutions When implementing IoT in arable farming, as well as
    in other contexts, diverse challenges limit or affect the performance of the systems
    employed. The challenges identified in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5) can indicate
    which areas need to be taken into account when designing an IoT-based system or
    point out areas that require further research. However, the results presented
    in the figure are indicative and do not necessarily describe the importance of
    the challenges included, especially because of the multiple applications and implementation
    designs that are conceivable in arable farming. Any of the challenges can become
    crucial in different setups, and are therefore described. In addition, all challenges
    can be related to or have consequences for other challenges. Download : Download

    of challenges mentioned by the literature reviewed, divided by time periods and
    grouped in IoT layers. Interoperability, in general, is a major hurdle in the
    application of IoT. There are different dimensions related to it: technical, syntactical,
    semantic and organisational (Serrano et al., 2015, Veer and Wiles, 2008). Technical
    interoperability refers mostly to the communication protocols which affect the
    hardware and software components implemented. Syntactical interoperability is
    usually related to data formats, their syntax and encoding. Semantic interoperability
    concerns the interpretation of data contents, i.e. the meaning of the information
    exchanged. And organisational interoperability involves intercommunication of
    meaningful information across organisations regardless of information systems
    and infrastructures in a world-wide scale. As interoperability is such a generic
    term, in this section, technical interoperability has been addressed as part of
    the communication protocol challenge, syntactical and semantic interoperability
    have been included under the data heterogeneity challenge, and organisational
    interoperability have been described under the scalability challenge. 5.1. General
    challenges 5.1.1. Revenue and affordability Often the investment for establishing
    an IoT-based solution is high and as such challenging for small-scale farmers,
    while larger farms can more easily acquire IoT-based technologies when investing
    in new equipment (Brewster et al., 2017). The uncertainty regarding required costs,
    e.g. fuel or water allocations, and selling prices of the product give little
    margin for many farmers for investing in new technologies (Higgins et al., 2017).
    Trust plays an important role when investing in IoT systems, and relieving the
    perceived risks by demonstrating the revenues from their adoption is essential
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Jayashankar et al., 2018). For example, in Europe
    70% of all fertilising and spraying machinery is equipped with at least one precision
    agriculture technology, but only 25% of farmers actually use precision agriculture
    components on their farms (Say, Keskin, Sehri, & Sekerli, 2017). Technology providers
    need to increase the perceived value by demonstrating the financial return from
    IoT in order to diminish the perceived risk of adoption many farmers have. Technology
    providers need also to provide robust tools that are aligned with farmer needs
    and practices in order to gain acceptance and trust of IoT technologies. These
    technologies need to reduce the workload, assist in decision making and improve
    the efficiency of the targeted practice. Additionally, technology providers need
    to develop interoperable and flexible solutions that can easily be integrated
    and comply with accepted standards. Governments can also incentivise IoT adoption
    by policies and regulations, especially regarding documentation and traceability
    as ICT eases paperwork and bureaucracy. A reduction in the percentage of mentions
    regarding this challenge (see Fig. 5) could indicate that IoT is being more adopted
    in arable farming. In addition, IoT is likely to reshape the arable farming business.
    The implementation of monitoring and control of farming operations are generating
    substantial amounts of valuable data that are essential for the business of technology
    providers. The way farmers will dive into the data economy, i.e. connecting their
    data to work in vertical and horizontal networks beyond the farm, will have an
    effect on their business models, as well as on the business models of technology
    providers. The point of view of the farmer''s business regarding IoT has not been
    fully addressed in the literature reviewed and will require further investigation.
    5.1.2. Data heterogeneity The diverse data sources and sensor manufacturers imply
    use of different unit systems, data structures and nomenclatures in different
    data formats, which result in reduced syntactical and semantic interoperability
    among IoT environments. Sensor data can be encoded in binary, or represented in
    formats such as json, xml, text (e.g. csv), shapefile, or even proprietary formats.
    The heterogeneity of data types and formats can also affect the performance of
    a protocol employed for communicating the information. Furthermore, this challenge
    becomes critical in situations such as system integration or sharing data with
    other systems (e.g. FMIS), which could imply developing data conversion tools
    or even redesign of the IoT setup. The use of standardised formats can help with
    this challenge. Some attempts have been made at producing standards or standardised
    formats that cover the great heterogeneity of agricultural data, e.g. ISO 11783
    (ISOBUS) developed by the Agricultural Industry Electronics Foundation (AEF) for
    tractors and agricultural machinery, which is very relevant in arable farming
    (Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015, Miettinen et al., 2006, Oksanen et al., 2015,
    Peets et al., 2012) or AgroXML developed by the Association for Technologies and
    Structures in Agriculture (KTBL) mainly for FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014, Köksal
    and Tekinerdogan, 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Peets et al., 2012). These
    are now being integrated by the non-profit organisation AgGateway through the
    ADAPT framework and SPADE project for seamlessly communicating agricultural machinery
    data to FMIS, trying to enhance the existing standards and as a consequence improve
    interoperability (Brewster et al., 2017). A drawback of comprehensive data models,
    which try to describe all attributes of agricultural data, is that they become
    too cumbersome to handle in many applications. Finally, the use of middleware
    platforms applicable in smart farming, e.g. FIWARE or SmartFarmNet, can also reduce
    the problems caused by data heterogeneity (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Ferreira
    et al., 2017, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). 5.1.3. Scalability
    and flexibility Organisational interoperability is a key element concerning scalability
    and flexibility (Serrano et al., 2015, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). Many
    of the systems described in the literature reviewed are centralised, closed, difficult
    to integrate in other existing platforms or difficult to implement on larger scales,
    different farming systems or geographical areas. They are also challenging to
    integrate beyond the farm level and across the supply chain in order to provide
    agri-food safety and traceability. The use of standardised dynamic protocols,
    such as SOAP protocol (cloud-based infrastructures with extensible ontologies
    that cover the broad and diverse agricultural production systems and environments),
    fast and reliable APIs (e.g. RESTful) and middleware platforms applicable for
    smart agriculture, such as FIWARE with its generic enablers, are tools that are
    employed to achieve organisational interoperability and make the system developed
    more scalable and flexible (Ferreira et al., 2017, López-Riquelme et al., 2017,
    O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). Service-Oriented Architectures
    (SOA) also bring possibilities to effectively integrate ecosystems through open
    and standardised interfaces, increasing organisational interoperability (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014, Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Kruize et al., 2016, Pesonen et al.,
    2014, Sørensen and Bochtis, 2010). Scalability and flexibility may also refer
    to WSNs in the literature, to their capacity to support an increasing number of
    devices/nodes, with the network architecture, the gateway and protocols used being
    the main constrains (Elijah et al., 2018). This challenge has been considered
    under the network size challenge. 5.1.4. Robustness and fault tolerance Many different
    factors can affect the overall robustness and fault tolerance of a system. Robust
    wireless connectivity is an important limitation in many setups (Oksanen et al.,
    2016, Vuran et al., 2018). In the design of an IoT-based solution dealing with
    faults, errors and unforeseen events need to be taken into account in order to
    ensure the reliability of the system. Many of these issues are related to the
    other challenges presented here and can be handled at the device level, but also
    need to be thought of in the overall IoT system design (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    Ray, 2017). 5.1.5. Complexity The agricultural system is complex and can be challenging
    to work with. It is complex not only because of the multifaceted nature of the
    physical, chemical and/or biological processes in the soil-crop-air system, but
    also because of the technical complexity of hardware and software interacting
    with it. Depending on the novelty of the IoT technology implemented and the background
    of the developer and user, the systems can become more or less complex. For example,
    software and hardware incompatibilities can challenge its implementation and integration
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016), as well as many other challenges, e.g. the great
    field task diversity in arable farming, that can add complexity to the system.
    Technical knowledge can become a major hurdle for the implementation of IoT in
    farms, and it is therefore important that user-friendliness and plug-and-play
    basis have a high priority for the technology providers (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Zou and Quan, 2017). Complexity should be an issue for the technology provider
    and not for the customer. In addition, the co-created development and implementation
    of IoT systems in agriculture by a multi-actor approach is needed to overcome
    the complexity at different levels of integrating IoT in agriculture. Good examples
    of this are the European Union supported research and development efforts through
    multi-actor large-scale pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Verdouw et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019). 5.1.6. Lack of products In the early stages of precision
    agriculture and IoT in agriculture, products that integrated agronomy and ICT
    engineering were lacking, which hindered their adoption (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Kitchen and Roger, 2007). The large scales and diversity of environments
    in arable farming can challenge the products used even more than in controlled
    environments, as they are to be modelled to describe larger areas, send information
    through larger distances and be exposed to harsher environments. Even if Figure
    5 shows lack of references in the last couple of years, it is still relevant for
    some applications, e.g. for in-situ real-time soil nutrient sensing is still a
    real challenge, especially regarding calibration (Bünemann et al., 2018, Marín-González
    et al., 2013). 5.2. Device layer challenges 5.2.1. Power consumption The use of
    wireless devices has major advantages over wired systems, as they are more economical
    to establish and can cover much wider areas. However, their power consumption,
    with limited battery life, is a major drawback of many wireless systems, and needs
    to be accounted for. This issue is so important that it is the main identified
    challenge in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5), especially for WSNs (Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tan and Panda, 2010). The large distances to cover in arable farming make
    wireless devices indispensable, and solutions to reduce their power consumption
    and/or extend their battery life are required. These solutions can include energy
    harvesting, low power consumption sensors and communication technologies or power
    efficient management. Energy harvesting techniques can include solar cells, micro
    wind turbines or other interesting solutions which have been well described by
    Tuna and Gungor (2016) and Jawad et al. (2017). The power consumption of the communication
    technologies and sensors employed are also to be considered in the design of the
    IoT solution as there are big differences between devices (Balmos et al., 2016,
    Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). Choosing low power sensors
    and communication devices needs to be taken into account when designing the IoT
    system (Estrada-López et al., 2018). Low power wireless technologies, such as
    BLE, have low power consumption but also low communication range, while Wi-Fi
    has somewhat higher communication range, but much higher power consumption (Table
    1), however data rates and other parameters are important factors to consider
    too. ZigBee and LoRa have been identified as appropriate candidates for many farming
    applications (Jawad et al., 2017). Power efficient management techniques of WSNs
    include sleep/active schemes, e.g. duty-cycling algorithms (Ahmed, Abdalla et
    al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Alahmadi et al., 2017, Balmos et al., 2016,
    Dhall and Agrawal, 2018, Temprilho et al., 2018); data mitigation schemes, e.g.
    data aggregation (Abdel-basset, Shawky, & Eldrandaly, 2018) or data compression
    (Moon et al., 2018); energy-efficient routing schemes, e.g. mobile sinks by the
    use of UAVs (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018,
    Uddin et al., 2018); and other combined solutions, e.g. LEACH, a cluster architecture
    with Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) based MAC protocol and data aggregation
    scheme (Kamarudin, Ahmad, & Ndzi, 2016), or dynamic power management by combining
    sleep/active states with dynamic data rates schemes (Estrada-López et al., 2018).
    Jawad et al. (2017) have provided a good overview and description of WSN power
    efficient management techniques. Lastly, techniques such as edge computing may
    have higher power requirements on the device, making cloud computing more desirable
    if power consumption is a constraint in the projected IoT solution. On the other
    hand, mounting sensors and devices on agricultural vehicles and implements allows
    connection to the power supply of the vehicle and as a consequence eliminate power
    consumption as a limiting factor. The type of sensors that are mounted on vehicles
    and their implements is quite limited, being currently mainly camera-based (e.g.
    Midtiby et al., 2018, Steen et al., 2012). Nevertheless, there is for example
    potential in employing sensors on the coulters of seed-drills for mapping soil
    properties (Nielsen et al., 2017), or other on-the-go sensors for mapping soil
    or crop variations (Peets et al., 2012). 5.2.2. Harsh device environment The natural
    environment in which sensors and other devices are placed can greatly challenge
    their functionality and longevity. Harsh weather conditions, e.g. large temperature
    variations, intense rainfall or prolonged high humidity can cause water condensation
    inside devices and consequently provoke corrosion and short circuits (Bauer &
    Aschenbruck, 2018). Sensors and other devices situated close to the ground experience
    exposure to dust, mud, or even corrosive chemicals, e.g. agro-chemicals, which
    can seriously damage the performance of the device or cause its total failure
    (Aliev, 2018, Bauer and Aschenbruck, 2018). Underground chemical sensors are also
    exposed to soil chemical and biological processes that deteriorate the sensors
    and can mislead the measurements, requiring unfeasible maintenance and re-calibrations
    (Burton et al., 2018, Kassal et al., 2018). Choosing adequate casing that does
    not interfere with the functionality of the device and also tolerates the environment
    they are located in is essential in the design of the IoT system. Sensors are
    also developed for different conditions, and need to match the system''s minimum
    requirements. RFID tags have been reported to perform flawlessly under extreme
    conditions and environments (Costa et al., 2013, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011);
    however, RFID technology is quite limited in its applications in arable farming,
    and suitable sensors and communication devices are therefore primarily dependent
    on the application and design of the IoT system. 5.3. Network layer challenges
    5.3.1. Latency, throughput and rate The large amounts of data generated in IoT
    applications do not only cause problems regarding data storage or handling, but
    also latency problems that reduce the throughput of the network employed. In arable
    farming, latency problems can be of great importance in some IoT solutions, e.g.
    in WSNs where high latency implies higher power consumption of a node (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017), or in dynamic optimised route planning in vehicle logistics, which
    requires rapid responses to deviations in the route plan (Villa-Henriksen et al.,
    2018). For reducing latency problems, fog and edge computing can be employed,
    as these computing techniques decrease latency and network congestion (Elijah
    et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018), e.g. data compression at the edge
    reduces the large volumes of data communicated through the network (Moon et al.,
    2018). In addition, the use of lightweight protocols can also reduce latency problems,
    e.g. LP4S for sensors (Hernández-rojas, Fernández-Caramés, Fraga-Lamas, & Escudero,
    2018), or MQTT messaging protocol, which has a faster throughput than HTTP and
    works well for bandwidth limited networks (Estrada-López et al., 2018). The communication
    rate is important to have in mind when planning the wireless communication technology
    to implement, e.g. 5G can handle high-rates, while SigFox or IEEE 802.15.4-based
    protocols are for low-rates (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton,
    Gotta et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). The throughput of the network affects
    the communication rate, and the communication rate also influences the power consumption,
    which equally has to be carefully considered. Fast response to events is achieved
    by data processing techniques such as data merging (Tanaka, 2018), data compression
    (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018), or dynamic and complex event
    processing rules for conditioning input data and immediately acting accordingly
    (Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018). These processes can be on the cloud or at the edge,
    i.e. devices. Finally, test-bed analysis prior to implementation of the network
    can simulate communication rates and possible latency and throughput issues (Stewart,
    Stewart, & Kennedy, 2017). 5.3.2. Wireless link quality A low wireless link quality
    affects greatly the QoS of an IoT system as it ends in unreliable communication
    between nodes (Klaina, Alejos, Aghzout, & Falcone, 2018). This can be caused by
    multipath propagation (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), background noise (Mazon-Olivo
    et al., 2018), routing problems, e.g. packet collision or limited band width (Jawad
    et al., 2017), or even by harsh environmental conditions, which affect the transceivers
    and the quality of the data transmitted (Elijah et al., 2018). Adequate design
    and testing of the network are crucial for avoiding or reducing this challenge.
    However, techniques such as channel access methods, e.g. TDMA, can improve the
    link quality by reducing packet collisions (Temprilho et al., 2018). Regarding
    testing, the calculation of signal strengths in real-time on the base station
    helps estimating the wireless link quality of a WSN when establishing the system
    (Klaina et al., 2018). Packet loss characterisation can also be used to assess
    the wireless link quality of a connection (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018,
    Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018). Additionally, blind entity identification
    can also help estimating the wireless link quality of a network (Mukherjee, Misra,
    Raghuwanshi, & Mitra, 2018). 5.3.3. Communication range The different wireless
    communication technologies have very diverse ranges, which need to be accounted
    for when designing the IoT solution, together with other factors such as data
    rate, power consumption, communication protocols or costs (Table 1). In arable
    farming, due to the larger farm sizes and because of the employment of mobile
    sensors and devices on vehicles, this challenge becomes even more critical. Furthermore,
    relying on the approximate communication range of a wireless technology can be
    misleading, e.g. WiFi is often described to have 100 m range, but a test analysing
    the packet delivery ratio with respect to distance to gateway shows packet losses
    at ≥ 60 m (Giordano, Seitanidis, Ojo, Adami, & Vignoli, 2018), while in another
    test using WiField devices, 2.6 km range was claimed to be reached still having
    reliable internet connection (Brinkhoff et al., 2017). Testing the communication
    range is therefore important for some settings. In addition to the choice of wireless
    technology, network topology in WSNs, such as mesh topologies can also increase
    the communication range by using nodes to communicate with the central node (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018). Reduced range due to obstacles
    or topography is addressed in the propagation losses challenge later. 5.3.4. Communication
    protocols Differences in communication protocols can cause technical interoperability
    issues, which can lead to connectivity and compatibility issues among the hardware
    and software employed (Stočes et al., 2016). Network protocols are separated into
    diverse layers forming a protocol stack, where tasks are divided into smaller
    steps (Suhonen, Kohvakka, Kaseva, Hämäläinen, & Hännikäinen, 2012). In the infrastructure
    layer, some wireless standards that define communication protocols are commonly
    used by different wireless technologies, e.g. IEEE 802.15.4, which is used by
    ZigBee or 6LowPAN among others, or 3GPP, which is used by GPRS, LTE or 5G among
    others (see Table 1). In the application layer, standards such as HTTP (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Kaloxylos et al., 2014), MQTT (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016, Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018) or XMPP (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018)
    are commonly used in IoT applications in arable farming. Adequate protocols are
    especially relevant and challenging in vehicle-to-vehicle communication, and crucial
    in arable farming. Different standards in different layers require careful planning
    of the whole IoT solution, as they are not always compatible and can also have
    an effect on the data formats used, or sensors and gateways employed (Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018). Middleware platforms can ease the integration of diverse protocols
    and standards by offering enough abstraction levels so that this diversity is
    effectively managed (O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Tuna et al., 2017). Edge computing
    can also ease technical interoperability issues as a local computing layer is
    created to process data and create control rules before sending the data to the
    cloud (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). 5.3.5. Network management Managing a WSN
    can imply battery change, software updates, calibration of sensors, replacement
    of devices and similar maintenance activities that can be very time-consuming.
    Smart mobile devices, e.g. smart phones, can make remote software updating possible,
    and can sometimes even be used for updating some other IoT devices (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016). Using energy efficient devices and communication techniques can
    also be employed to extend the battery life of devices (Jawad et al., 2017). Some
    sensors may require recalibrations with a certain periodicity, which has to be
    accounted for in the projected IoT solution (Kassal et al., 2018). Nonetheless,
    the management of the network is always to be considered when implementing IoT
    solutions in arable farming, where distances and number of devices/nodes can be
    vast. 5.3.6. Network size WSN configuration schemes have a maximum number of sensor
    nodes per gateway that the network can handle, i.e. the network size. According
    to the analysis of the reviewed literature, network size is being identified more
    often in the last two years (see Fig. 5), which seems to indicate new possibilities
    for exploiting the capabilities of WSNs. Network size depends on the wireless
    communication technology employed and can affect other parameters, such as data
    latency or scalability of the network (Balmos et al., 2016). Network topologies
    can also influence the network size and vary from simple star network (e.g. Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018) to more advanced multi-hop mesh networks (Ahmed, Abdalla et al.,
    2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Langendoen et al., 2006) that can increase the network
    size by using network nodes as relays to reach a central node and gateway. Optimisation
    algorithms have been used to find the best spatial distribution of WSN nodes,
    and therefore to assist in the optimisation of its network size (Abdel-basset
    et al., 2018). 5.3.7. Propagation losses Even though propagation losses can become
    a big problem for WSNs in application areas like fruit orchards and tree plantations,
    in arable farming hedges, trees, big rocks or sheds, as well as pronounced topography,
    like hills and valleys, can also block, diffract or scatter the signal reducing
    the communication range and causing data packet losses. Additionally, weather
    conditions can also degrade the wireless connectivity propagation of signals (Jawad
    et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Stewart et al., 2017). To avoid or reduce
    these problems, adequate planning of the location of the sensor nodes, the antenna
    height, the communication protocols and the network topology is necessary. Regarding
    network topologies, mesh networks compared to star networks can reduce propagation
    losses as well as increase communication range (Kamarudin et al., 2016, Ruiz-Garcia
    and Lunadei, 2011). Moreover, propagation modelling can help planning, reduce
    communication tests and ensure Quality of Service (QoS) for heterogeneous wireless
    networks (Jawad et al., 2017, Stewart et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Klaina
    et al., 2018, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011). 5.4. Application layer challenges
    5.4.1. Data analysis Data analysis can in some cases become an important challenge,
    especially when dealing with Big Data, which is data in such amounts, heterogeneity
    and complexity that they need new data management techniques for analysis (Wolfert
    et al., 2017). Agricultural Big Data are worthless unless analysed; however, analysis
    can be very challenging because of the volume, diversity, and quality (e.g. errors
    and duplications). This is especially challenging in arable farming, where larger
    amounts of heterogeneous data are generated at diverse rates and from very different
    sources. The literature reviewed show an increased identification of this challenge
    in the last two years compared with the previous 6 years (see Fig. 5). This evolution
    might be caused by increased access and use of agricultural Big Data in recent
    times (Kamilaris et al., 2017, Pham and Stack, 2018). Techniques for lowering
    data dimensionality can ease the analysis by applying feature reduction models,
    which reduce data size by eliminating unnecessary data dimensions (Sabarina &
    Priya, 2015). Cloud computing provides the flexibility and scalability necessary
    for Big Data analysis, where numerous users operate simultaneously with the large
    and complex datasets (Gill et al., 2017). Likewise, cloud platforms are perfect
    for storing such large amounts of data, where NoSQL databases can store and manage
    these large unstructured datasets (Kamilaris et al., 2017). The analysis of Big
    Data can potentially be used, for example, for policy-making, reducing environmental
    negative impact, improve food-safety, as well as improved farm management and
    production, benefiting the different stakeholders involved (Kamilaris et al.,
    2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). Another facet to data analysis is the growing use
    of machine learning techniques, which are being used for exploring Big Data and
    identifying important factors and their interrelationship that affect agricultural
    production systems like, for example, identifying diverse patterns (e.g. crop
    development stages, weeds or diseases) as part of machine vision systems (Bacco,
    Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018, Reshma and Pillai,
    2018). In these cases, the model is built upon a sample of data, often called
    training data, whose size and quality directly affects the final model. Choosing
    the adequate approach for building the model with the available data is also essential
    for the success of the IoT solution. 5.4.2. Data security and privacy Even though
    data security and privacy do not constitute a high challenge in the literature
    reviewed, they are certainly major concerns for the farmers, i.e. the suppliers
    of data and also end-users of the technology developed, who have little trust
    in service providers'' use of data (Jayashankar et al., 2018, Zhang et al., 2017).
    Also, data ownership needs to be taken into consideration as raw data and processed
    data in IoT systems have different ownership and are accessible by different actors,
    affecting the necessary requirements for data security and privacy (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). Research and development focus has been on sensing, processing,
    controlling and computing, while less effort has been devoted to solving security
    threats, risks and privacy (Tuna et al., 2017). Other issues like cost effectiveness
    in, for example, cloud services are also affecting the security of the data, which
    eventually affects the whole privacy and security of the IoT solution, as low-cost
    services have lower security (Dhinari, Newe, Lewis, & Nizamani, 2017). Technology
    providers should prioritise data security and privacy in their business models.
    The availability of privacy and security technologies that are dynamic enough
    to support the vast numbers and variety of stakeholders, as well as the complexity
    of the network, is still a major challenge that needs to be overcome (Verdouw,
    2016). Many solutions are being employed to reduce data security and privacy issues
    in each of the IoT layers of the system, e.g. encryption algorithms, intrusion
    detection mechanisms, authentication, secure routing protocols, anonymisation,
    etc. (Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Middleware platforms are employed
    to add a security layer between network and applications, which can include confidentiality,
    anonymity and security to the system (Rodriguez et al., 2018, Serrano et al.,
    2015, Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Additionally, newer technologies
    such as blockchain are aiming to solve many of the challenges related to privacy
    and security as well as transparency of the IoT. In agriculture, it is mainly
    being applied in the food supply chain (Bermeo-Almeida et al., 2018). Blockchain
    make sense for IoT platforms where large amounts of confidential data are handled.
    5.4.3. Data quality and availability Some of the challenges previously described
    have a direct influence on data quality, e.g. propagation losses, wireless link
    quality, robustness and fault tolerance. Anomaly detection and similar methods
    have been employed to identify faulty data before analysis (Cadavid et al., 2018,
    Lyle et al., 2014). The poor quality of data or its limited availability can limit
    many applications that involve Big Data analytics, modelling and machine learning,
    which can affect or even compromise the success of some IoT solutions (Balducci
    et al., 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). In these setups,
    and specifically in arable farming, many datasets are integrated from different
    sources and sensors, and the quality or scarcity of some data can become a major
    hurdle to overcome. Ensuring quality and availability of the data before starting
    such a project is required. Even if it is not always possible to gather all the
    data necessary to develop models, perform correct analytics or train machine learning
    algorithms, scientific assumptions (Severino et al., 2018), data augmentation
    (Diedrichs et al., 2018) or simulated data (Wolanin et al., 2019) are used to
    help or solve the encountered challenge. 5.4.4. Context-awareness (metadata) Context-awareness
    is an important and distinctive feature of Smart Farming as compared to Precision
    Farming, because it automatically includes descriptive data from e.g. fields,
    sensors, machines, i.e. metadata. Metadata can include information about the date
    and time, node identification number, data of calibration, height and position
    information, or even descriptive data about an experiment objective, field, machinery,
    crop genotype or soil information at the sensor placement (Jayaraman et al., 2015).
    Metadata about sensor nodes in the system are crucial for providing contextual
    information so that correct data analysis can be performed (Jayaraman et al.,
    2016, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness helps computing techniques to decide what
    data is to be analysed, and consequently easing the computations, and the lack
    of this data complicate data analysis substantially. This is especially relevant
    in arable farming, where the system has to handle both spatial and temporal data
    and make decisions based on the data collected. The use of standards, formats
    and middleware that support metadata is therefore important to have in mind during
    the planning of an IoT solution (Peets et al., 2009, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness
    facilitates new business models and strategies for data analytics and DSS software
    providers. 6. Conclusions and future perspectives A literature review of current
    and foreseeable IoT technologies and systems in arable farming was carried out.
    This has included an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies, an
    outline of the current and potential applications, and a thorough description
    of the challenges and solutions. From this survey, the role smart mobile phones
    play is highlighted, especially Android devices, which are employed in different
    ways for a wide diversity of applications, due to their availability, connectivity,
    interoperability, programmable ease and computational power. The introduction
    of 5G networks in the near future will enhance the capabilities of smart mobile
    devices due to their enhanced performance. The intelligent management of WSN as
    well as the capabilities of improved communication technologies can also solve
    some of the challenges IoT-based solutions are experiencing. The role of middleware
    platforms and generic enablers are expected to gain acceptance and importance,
    as they can solve system integration issues and interoperability challenges. In
    general, regarding challenges, interoperability is a main challenge throughout
    the whole IoT architecture, where development and/or acceptance of standards and
    protocols is required to ease the issues encountered by many IoT implementations.
    Furthermore, challenges such as revenue and affordability of IoT systems, the
    power consumption of wireless devices, latency and throughput problems during
    data transfer, as well as the complexity of data analysis, and data privacy and
    security have been identified in the reviewed literature as of high importance,
    and academic research should direct their resources toward solving or reducing
    these issues. Technology developers need to ensure that the solutions create a
    real benefit for farmers and are available and applicable for both large and small
    producers. How IoT generated farm data will affect the business models of farmers
    requires further investigation as it is not fully addressed in the literature
    reviewed. The combination of intelligent power efficient systems with power harvesting
    technologies should guarantee longer battery-life of wireless devices. Computing
    data at the edge, i.e. on the devices, as well as lightweight protocols can reduce
    network latency and capacity/throughput problems. The emergence of Big Data is
    posing significant challenges for data analysis, as the complexity and heterogeneity
    of the huge data sets require the application of new analysis techniques beyond
    those traditionally used. Techniques such as lowering data dimensionality, cloud
    platforms and cloud computing, including machine learning algorithms, can help
    in this area and new innovative solutions are expected to be developed. Finally,
    technology producers have to guarantee privacy and security of the data handled
    throughout all the layers by employing different secure methods without compromising
    the user-friendliness of the solutions employed. Middleware platforms can help
    improving the privacy and security of IoT solutions, and techniques such as blockchain
    can assist with privacy and security problems of IoT platforms when dealing with
    Big Data. In the near future, interoperable and service-oriented FMIS that are
    integrated in the supply chain with intelligent analytic tools will take over
    some of the management and decision-making tasks of farmers and advisors, which
    will require training for farmers to adapt to this type of FMIS. Key decision
    support functions include farm financial analysis, business processes, or supply
    chain functions, which will gain importance with Big Data analytics. In addition,
    DSS for vehicle logistics will grow in importance as a way to optimise field operations
    using route planning and sensor-based site-specific applications. Finally, the
    introduction of autonomous vehicles and robotics in arable farming in the near
    future is expected to completely change arable farming operations and production
    praxes requiring fully adopted IoT capabilities. Acknowledgements This work was

    1Food safety is becoming more and more serious topic worldwide. To tackle the
    food safety issues from the technical aspect, people need a trusted food traceability
    system that can track and monitor the whole lifespan of food production, including
    the processes of food raw material cultivation/breeding, processing, transporting,
    warehousing, and selling etc. In this paper, we propose a trusted, self-organized,
    open and ecological food traceability system based on blockchain and Internet
    of Things (IoT) technologies, which involves all parties of a smart agriculture
    ecosystem, even if they may not trust each other. We use IoT devices to replace
    manual recording and verification as many as possible, which can reduce the human
    intervention to the system effectively. Furthermore, we plan to use the smart
    contract technology to help the law-executor to find problems and process them
    timely. References X. Gu, Y. Chai, Y. Liu, J. Shen, Y. Huang, and Y. Nan. 2017.

    Emerging applications such as Internet of Everything, Holographic Telepresence,
    collaborative robots, and space and deep-sea tourism are already highlighting
    the limitations of existing fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks. These limitations
    are in terms of data-rate, latency, reliability, availability, processing, connection
    density and global coverage, spanning over ground, underwater and space. The sixth-generation
    (6G) of mobile networks are expected to burgeon in the coming decade to address
    these limitations. The development of 6G vision, applications, technologies and
    standards has already become a popular research theme in academia and the industry.
    In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of the current developments towards
    6G. We highlight the societal and technological trends that initiate the drive
    towards 6G. Emerging applications to realize the demands raised by 6G driving
    trends are discussed subsequently. We also elaborate the requirements that are
    necessary to realize the 6G applications. Then we present the key enabling technologies
    in detail. We also outline current research projects and activities including
    standardization efforts towards the development of 6G. Finally, we summarize lessons
    learned from state-of-the-art research and discuss technical challenges that would
    shed a new light on future research directions towards 6G. Published in: IEEE

    \ success in health care, smart city,\nindustrial production and so on. Protected\
    \ agriculture is one of the ﬁelds which has broad application\nprospects of IoT.\
    \ Protected agriculture is a mode of highly eﬃcient development of modern agriculture\n\
    that uses artiﬁcial techniques to change climatic factors such as temperature,\
    \ to create environmental\nconditions suitable for the growth of animals and plants.\
    \ This review aims to gain insight into\nthe state-of-the-art of IoT applications\
    \ in protected agriculture and to identify the system structure\nand key technologies.\
    \ Therefore, we completed a systematic literature review of IoT research\nand\
    \ deployments in protected agriculture over the past 10 years and evaluated the\
    \ contributions\nmade by diﬀerent academicians and organizations. Selected references\
    \ were clustered into three\napplication domains corresponding to plant management,\
    \ animal farming and food/agricultural\nproduct supply traceability. Furthermore,\
    \ we discussed the challenges along with future research\nprospects, to help new\
    \ researchers of this domain understand the current research progress of IoT in\n\
    protected agriculture and to propose more novel and innovative ideas in the future.\n\
    Keywords: Internet of things; protected agriculture; integrated application; state-of-the-art\n\
    1. Introduction\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) was ﬁrst developed in 1999 by the\
    \ network radio frequency\nidentiﬁcation (RFID) system proposed by the Massachusetts\
    \ Institute of Technology (MIT) Auto-ID\nLabs [1]. With the application and development\
    \ of new information technologies, the connotation\nand extension of IoT have\
    \ undergone major changes [2]. IoT can be deﬁned as a huge internet-based\nnetwork\
    \ connecting physical and virtual “things” with standard and interoperable communication\n\
    protocols. To be speciﬁc, everything, such as a sensor and an actuator possessing\
    \ unique identity\nand attribute, exchange messages and communicate with each\
    \ other to realize intelligent positioning,\ntracking, identiﬁcation, perception,\
    \ monitoring and management via kinds of networks anytime and\nanywhere [3]. IoT\
    \ has penetrated pervasively most aspects of human life everywhere such as health\n\
    care, smart home, smart city, industrial control and so on. Agriculture is an\
    \ ideal candidate for the\ndeployment of IoT solutions because it occurs in wide\
    \ areas that need to be continuously monitored\nand controlled [4,5].\nThe concept\
    \ of protected agriculture is relative to open-ﬁeld agriculture. It uses artiﬁcial\
    \ techniques\nto change climatic factors such as natural light, temperature and\
    \ humidity to create environmental\nconditions suitable for the growth of animals\
    \ and plants, enabling them to grow around the clock.\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833;\

    2 of 24\nThe environment of protected agriculture is completely or largely artiﬁcially\
    \ controlled andwhich has\nbroken the limits of climate and land conditions for\
    \ the growth of animals and plants to a certain extent.\nSo it is also called\
    \ controllable agriculture. Compared with open-ﬁeld agriculture, protected agriculture\n\
    has more potential to apply IoT technology, because it is less aﬀected by climatic\
    \ and geographical\nfactors. Some mature IoT solutions in other ﬁelds can be transferred\
    \ directly to protected agriculture [6].\nWith the development of agricultural\
    \ sensor, wireless communication, cloud computing,\nmachine learning and Big Data\
    \ technologies, IoT technology has emerged and is gradually being\npromoted and\
    \ applied in the protected agriculture ﬁeld [7–9]. It is playing an important\
    \ role in various\nareas of protected agriculture as it is capable of helping\
    \ farmers monitor soil condition, climate change\nand animal and plant health\
    \ [10]. When the environmental factor change beyond the set threshold,\nIoT will\
    \ automatically send a warning message to the administrator to remove the hidden\
    \ danger.\nIt can also control environmental factors such as temperature, humidity,\
    \ carbon dioxide concentration\nand illumination according to the condition of\
    \ crop growth in real time [11,12]. In addition, cameras in\nthe IoT system are\
    \ able to capture crop diseases and insect pests in the greenhouse in real time,\n\
    helping farmers ﬁnd problems and take targeted preventive measures [13]. Through\
    \ GPS, RFID and\nother location-based sensors, goods such as vegetables can be\
    \ tracked and monitored visually during\ntransportation and storage. Supermarket\
    \ managers use smart phone or PC to monitor and predict\nproduct status and the\
    \ demand for getting product on shelves. At the user or consumer end, people can\n\
    query the variety, origin, processing and other farm product information by means\
    \ of the QR code,\nbarcode, etc. IoT for protected agriculture can help create\
    \ an informed, connected, developed and\nadaptable rural community. Low-cost embedded\
    \ devices can improve the interaction between humans\nand the physical world.\
    \ Cloud computing, edge computing, and Big Data can provide valuable analysis\n\
    and support for decisions. In summary, IoT will become an important tool in the\
    \ next few years to\nengage people in embedded agriculture which includes suppliers,\
    \ farmers, technicians, distributors,\nmerchants, consumers and government representatives\
    \ [14,15].\nOn the basis of the potential of IoT applications in protected agriculture\
    \ described in the previous\nparagraphs, this paper aims to identify the current\
    \ state of solutions in these ﬁelds. The IoT fundamental\nstructure in protected\
    \ agriculture is introduced in detail based on agricultural sensors, wireless\
    \ sensor\nnetworks, cloud computing, edge clouding and machine learning technologies.\
    \ The application of IoT\nin protected agriculture and how it makes contributions\
    \ is displayed. Furthermore, the open issues,\nchallenges, future opportunities\
    \ and development trends are discussed.\nIn this article, a comprehensive and\
    \ profound review of IoT in protected agriculture has been\nexecuted based on\
    \ a survey of real-world deployments and published papers over the past 10 years.\n\
    Firstly, a keyword-based search for conference papers and articles was performed\
    \ mainly from the\nscientiﬁc databases IEEE Xplore, Science Direct and ACM Digital\
    \ as well as from Google Scholar.\nFor search keywords, we used the following\
    \ query: “Internet of Things” and either “greenhouse”\nor “livestock” or “aquaculture“\
    \ or “agriculture“. Then, we ﬁltered out papers referring to IoT but\nnot applied\
    \ to the protected agricultural domain. Finally, we checked these papers selected\
    \ from the\nprevious step and picked out the ﬁnal papers according to the problem\
    \ they addressed, the solution\nproposed, impact achieved (if measurable), tools,\
    \ systems and algorithms used.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows.\
    \ Section 2 presents the structure of IoT in protected\nagriculture. The key technologies\
    \ of IoT in protected agriculture are introduced in Section 3. The three\nimportant\
    \ applications in protected agriculture are summed up in Section 4. We further\
    \ discussed\nthe challenges to be faced and the problems that need to be solved\
    \ for IoT in protected agriculture as\nwell as a few future development directions\
    \ in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 outlines the conclusions of\nthis paper.\n\

    2.1. Simple Review of Previous IoT Structure\nAt present, there is no uniﬁed opinion\
    \ on the structure of IoT. The composition of IoT can be\ndivided into three parts:\
    \ object end, cloud end and network end. Smart items, smart devices and\nlocal\
    \ intelligent systems interact directly with the physical world to form the “object\
    \ end” of IoT\n(also known as “front end”). The cloud computing platform that\
    \ provides computing, storage and\nother resources performs fusion processing\
    \ and intelligent analysis of the sensing data from the object\nend and performs\
    \ execution control to constitute the “cloud end” (also referred to as “back end”)\
    \ of\nIoT. The communication infrastructure of the connection object end and the\
    \ cloud end constitutes the\n“network end” of IoT. According to the diﬀerent functions\
    \ implemented by physical entity services\nin the IoT, IoT architecture established\
    \ by the current service-oriented approach can be divided into\nthe following\
    \ two categories: cloud-centric IoT architecture and object-centric IoT architecture.\
    \ In the\ncloud-centric IoT application system, the physical entity service implements\
    \ basic physical information\ncollection, local information processing and transmission\
    \ of information to the cloud, but does not\nprovide a directly accessible service\
    \ interface. Mass storage, relational processing and knowledge\nmining of physical\
    \ information are all implemented in the cloud. One of their typical representatives\n\
    is uID IoT architecture, which is an IoT architecture developed by the uID center\
    \ of the nonproﬁt\nstandardization organization initiated by the university of\

    \ server and application information servers [16]. For software developers, the\
    \ main\nchallenge in building such systems is how to build a back-end cloud service\
    \ platform that supports\nmassive item information management and data processing.\

    \ of protected agriculture and the experience of other scholars, we \nproposed\
    \ a five-layer IoT architecture [22]. As shown in Figure 5, these layers are briefly\
    \ described \nbelow: \n(1). Perception layer: This layer consists of various sensors,\
    \ terminal devices, agricultural \nmachinery, wireless sensor network (WSN), RFID\
    \ tags andreaders, etc. The common sensors \nare environmental sensors, animal\
    \ and plant life information sensors and other sensors related \nto agriculture.\
    \ Through these sensors, information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed,\
    \ \nplant diseases, insect pests and animal vital signs can be obtained. The collected\
    \ information is \nsimply processed by the embedded device and uploaded to a higher\
    \ layer through the \nnetwork layer for further processing and analysis. \n(2).\
    \ Network layer: The network layer is the infrastructure of IoT, which includes\
    \ a converged \nnetwork formed by various communication networks and the internet.\
    \ The transmission \nmedium can be wired technology such as CAN bus and RS485\
    \ bus or wireless technology like \nZigbee, Bluetooth, LoRa and NB-IoT. The network\
    \ layer not only transmits various kinds of \nagricultural related information\
    \ collected by the perception layer to the higher layer, but also \nsends the\
    \ control commands of the application layer to the perception layer, so that the\
    \ related \ndevices of the sensing layer take corresponding actions.  \n(3). Middleware\

    \ technical \nspecifications (processor, power supply, communication module) and\
    \ system of each device \nare different and different devices cannot be connected\
    \ and communicated with each other, \nwhich leads to heterogeneity problems. The\
    \ middleware layer aggregates, filters and processes \nreceived data from IoT\
    \ devices, which greatly reduces the processing time and cost of the \nabove issues\
    \ and provides developers with a more versatile tool to build their applications.\
    \ It \nalso simplifies the steps of new service development and new device deployment\
    \ which \nFigure 4. IoT-A IoT framework [21].\n2.2. Structure of IoT in Protected\

    Sensor plays an indispensable role in obtaining environment, plant and animal\
    \ information and it\nis also one of the technical bottlenecks in the development\
    \ of IoT. In recent years, sensor technology\nhas rapidly developed with the emergence\
    \ of new materials and methods [23]. The conventional\nenvironment sensors such\
    \ as temperature, humidity, light intensity, heat and gas sensors have been\n\
    relatively mature and widely deployed in protected agriculture. Nowaday, about\
    \ 6000 research and\nproduction organizations engage in sensor research from more\
    \ than 40 countries, including famous\nmanufacturers such as Honeywell, Foxboro,\
    \ ENDEVCO, Bell & Howell and Solartron companies.\nThere are three main types\
    \ of widely used and researched agricultural sensors: physical property type\n\
    sensors, biosensors and micro electro mechanical system sensors (MEMS). The physical\
    \ property type\nsensor realizes the signal conversion through the physical change\
    \ of the sensitivity of the material\nof the sensor itself, which is mainly temperature,\
    \ humidity and gas sensor. The biosensor [24] uses\nthe organism itself as a sensitive\
    \ component to transmit information according to the reaction of the\norganism\
    \ to the outside world and includes enzyme sensor [25], microbial sensor, adaptive\
    \ sensor [26],\netc., which is mainly used to detect pesticide residue, heavy\
    \ metal ion, antibiotic residue and toxic\ngas [27,28]. The MEMS sensor is the\
    \ embodiment of the new generation of research and development\ntechnology in\
    \ the ﬁeld of sensors with small size, low power consumption, low cost and reliability\
    \ [29].\nAlthough sensor technology has made great strides in both principles\
    \ and manufacturing\nprocesses, there are still some open issues. A typical example\
    \ among those open issue is the research\nand development of soil sensors and\
    \ vital sign information sensors of animal and plant, which is an\nurgent conundrum\
    \ to overcome in long time. The complex composition as well as diﬀerent physical\n\
    and chemical properties of soil turn the rapid and situ measurement of soil nitrogen\
    \ and other elements\ninto an international diﬃculty. Since the life process of\
    \ animals and plants is very complicated, in order\nto realize the accurate detection\
    \ of information about their life, it is necessary to make breakthroughs in\n\
    the physical mechanism and measurement model of the life process. Related research\
    \ has been carried\nout using physicochemical properties, spectroscopy, multispectral,\
    \ hyper-spectral, nuclear magnetic\nresonance as well as other detection methods\
    \ [30–33].\nAnother problem is the promotion and application of these sensors.\
    \ For one thing there is still\na lack of uniform technical standards in the collection,\
    \ transmission and the interface with the platform\nand human-computer interaction\
    \ interface; for another, the cost has limited the large scale application\nof\
    \ fresh sensors in intelligent agriculture. Currently, the cost of sensing equipment\
    \ for the collection and\ntransmission of animal and plant status is prohibitively\
    \ expensive for ordinary peasants. The number\nof nodes in a sensor network can\
    \ often reach tens of thousands. To make the sensor network practical,\nthe cost\
    \ of each node must be controlled within $1, but now the price is as high as $80\
    \ [34].\n3.2. Data Transmission Technology\nIn this section, the details of data\
    \ transmission technology are discussed, which is one of the vital\ntechnologies\
    \ for real-time dynamic acquisition of agricultural information. Diﬀerent from\
    \ industrial\napplication, agricultural information acquisition is not demanding\
    \ in timelines and a slight delay in\nthe transmission process has little eﬀect\
    \ on agricultural production.\nCompared with wired transmission technology such\
    \ as ﬁeldbus, wireless communication\ntechnology has advantages of low construction\
    \ and maintenance cost, low power consumption\nand excellent extensibility. Recently,\
    \ most researchers, organizations and manufacturers choose it\nto build up their\
    \ WSN in environment monitoring [35,36], automatic irrigation [37] and remote\n\
    control [38]. As shown in Table 1, the summary of popular wireless technologies\
    \ and basic parameters\nwas presented. Diﬀerent vendors and research institutes\
    \ have developed their own wireless devices\nbased on these wireless protocols,\
    \ which has somewhat increased the heterogeneity of IoT. In addition,\nwireless\
    \ signals of diﬀerent protocols located in the same band can cause mutual interference\
    \ such as\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n8 of 24\nZigBee, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth [39].\
    \ Wi-Fi has high communication speed but high power consumption,\nwhich is suitable\
    \ for sensor network deployment at ﬁxed points. Although Bluetooth has high security,\n\
    its communication distance is too short and power consumption is high, which is\
    \ suitable for short-time\nclose-range networking. ZigBee has the advantages of\
    \ low consumption, low cost and self-organization\nand each node can be used as\
    \ a relay station for transmitting data of adjacent nodes. So it easily expands\n\
    the coverage of the sensor network and is an ideal long-distance, large-range\
    \ sensor networking.\nTable 1. Summary of popular wireless technologies and basic\

    \ mW\nIn recent years, the Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) is one of IoT hotspots\
    \ and\nthought as a novel technology with great development potential, which is\
    \ attributed to its huge\nadvantages such as ultra-long distance communication\
    \ and it can be used as an important complement\nof the traditional wireless local\
    \ area network (WLAN) and mobile cellular mobile communication\ntechnologies (such\
    \ as GSM and GPRS). At this stage, LPWAN has many technical standards, which can\n\
    be classiﬁed into two categories. The ﬁrst is a proprietary patented technology\
    \ that works under\nan unlicensed spectrum, such as LoRa, Sigfox and RPMA. The\
    \ second is a cellular communication\ntechnology that works under a licensed spectrum,\
    \ such as EC-GSM, eMTC and NB-IoT. Due to the use\nof dedicated frequency bands\
    \ and uniﬁed deployment by operators, licensed spectrum technology\nhas carrier-class\
    \ security and low interference characteristics, which forms full network coverage\n\
    and operation [40,41]. The unlicensed spectrum uses the common spectrum without\
    \ paying high\nspectrum costs but requires special handling of co-channel interference.\
    \ There are many beneﬁts of IoT\ndeployments based on LPWAN in the agricultural\
    \ environment. Firstly, the maximum connection\ndistance of the LPWAN terminal\
    \ device to the base station varies from several kilometers to several tens\n\
    of kilometers, which saves the trouble of setting up and maintaining routing devices.\
    \ Compared with\nthe 2.4 GHz band, LPWAN adopts the sub-1GHz band to acquire less\
    \ attenuation and multipath\nfading caused by obstacles and dense surfaces like\
    \ concrete walls [42,43]. Moverover, the sensitivity\nof state of the art LPWAN\
    \ receivers reaches as low as –130 dBm due to modulation techniques such\nas narrowband\
    \ and spread spectrum. Secondly, ultra low power operation is another advantage\
    \ of\nLPWAN which is achieved by duty cycling mechanism, lightweight medium access\
    \ control protocols\nand oﬄoading complex tasks [44]. Thirdly, most LPWAN technologies\
    \ support a large number of\ndevice connections by diversity techniques, adaptive\
    \ channel selection and data rate technologies,\netc. [45]. Finally, the LPWAN\
    \ connects a large number of end devices, while keeping the cost of\nhardware\
    \ below ﬁve dollars [46]. LPWAN technologies target a diverse set of applications\
    \ with varying\nrequirements in protected agriculture and therefore it should\
    \ provide some sort of quality of service\n(QoS) over the same underlying LPWAN\
    \ technology. However, current LPWAN technologies provide\nno or limited QoS.\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 1833\n9 of 24\nMeanwhile, mobile cellular communication technology\
    \ has undergone four generations of\ntechnology updates and the ﬁfth-generation\
    \ mobile communication technology (5G) was announced in\n2016, which will make\
    \ large ﬁle transfer such as agricultural images and audio a reality and bring\
    \ new\nimpetus to the agricultural IoT. From the perspective of future research,\
    \ the research of wireless sensor\nnetworks focuses mainly on communication, energy\
    \ conservation, network control and its application\nin agricultural monitoring.\n\
    3.3. WSN\nThe WSN consists of a lot of sensor nodes that are usually powered by\
    \ battery and it is a multi-hop\nself-organizing network system formed by wireless\
    \ communication to collaboratively sense, collect and\nprocess various information\
    \ of the perceived object in the network coverage area [47,48]. It can be\ndivided\
    \ into terrestrial WSN and wireless underground sensor networks (WUSN). The agricultural\n\
    sensors are usually planted into soil and lower frequency wireless technologies\
    \ are more selected\ndue to low attenuation in WUSN. Besides, antenna size and\
    \ energy consumption in WUSN is higher\nthan terrestrial WSN [49]. With development\
    \ of LPWAN, IoT may not need a mesh-style WSN with\npower-based routing, where\
    \ one node forwards packets of other nodes.\n3.4. Cloud Computing\nCloud computing\
    \ grew out of distributed computing, parallel processing and grid computing.\n\
    It is an Internet-based computing system that provides hardware services, infrastructure\
    \ services,\nplatform services, software services and storage services to various\
    \ IoT applications. Its essence is\na system for dynamically deploying and allocating/redistributing\
    \ as well as dynamic monitoring\nof virtualized computing and storage resource\
    \ pools, thereby providing users with computing,\ndata storage and platform services\
    \ that meet QoS requirements [50,51]. It played a strong role in\npromoting the\
    \ development of agricultural IoT. Firstly, cloud computing can provide farmers\
    \ with cheap\ndata storage services for text, image, video and other agricultural\
    \ information, which greatly reduces\nthe storage costs of agricultural enterprises\
    \ [52]. Secondly, it is diﬃcult to make direct use of these raw\ndata for making\
    \ decisions based on the technical level of farmers. Agricultural experts can\
    \ only make\naccurate judgments and give suggestions based on quantitative analysis.\
    \ Only cloud computing can\nsupport intelligent large-scale computing systems\
    \ [53,54]. Thirdly, cloud computing could provide\na secure platform for the development\
    \ of various IoT applications such as crop monitoring [55].\n3.5. Edge Computing\n\
    Edge computing refers to a new computing model that performs calculations at the\
    \ edge of the\nnetwork [56]. In the edge computing, the downlink data of the edge\
    \ represents the cloud service,\nthe uplink data represents IoT service and the\
    \ edge of edge computing refers to any computing\nand network resources between\
    \ the data source and the cloud computing center path. Because the\ncomputing\
    \ task is partially migrated to the network edge device, edge hormone can improve\
    \ data\ntransmission performance, ensure real-time processing and reduce the computational\
    \ load of the cloud\ncomputing center. Moreover, edge computing better protects\
    \ data because processing occurs closer to\nthe source than in cloud computing\
    \ [57,58].\n3.6. Machine Learning\nMachine learning (ML) is a smart way for computers\
    \ to simulate people’s learning activities, acquire\nnew knowledge, continuously\
    \ improve performance and implement their own perfection. In recent\nyears, machine\
    \ learning has achieved great success in algorithm, theory and application [59]\
    \ and have\nbeen combined with other agricultural technologies to maximized crop\
    \ yield while minimizing the input\ncosts [60]. The main machine learning algorithms\
    \ are naïve bayes, discriminant analysis, K-nearest\nneighbor, support vector\
    \ machine (SVM) [61], K-means clusterin, fuzzy clustering, gaussian mixture\n\
    models, artiﬁcial neural network (ANN), deep learning [62], decision tree algorithm\
    \ and so on [63].\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n10 of 24\nML can discover the internal\
    \ connection between messy, modelless and complex agricultural\ndata, make accurate\
    \ predictions and provide a theoretical basis for agricultural decision-making.\n\
    Machinelearning technology is playing an important role in crop breeding, disease\
    \ identiﬁcation,\npest and disease prediction, intelligent irrigation planning\
    \ and agricultural expert systems [64–67].\nFor example, ML technology can analyze\
    \ past farmland data, including the performance of crops under\ndiﬀerent climatic\
    \ conditions and the inheritance of a particular phenotype. As well, ML technology\n\
    can explore the association rules and then build a probability model to predict\
    \ which genes are\nmost likely to participate in the expression of a certain good\
    \ trait of the plant, which can help the\nbreeding expert conduct a reasonable\
    \ breeding experiment [68–70]. Kyosuke et al. came up with\na method for detecting\
    \ the maturity of a single intact tomato-based ML, which consisted of three\n\
    steps: pixel-based segmentation, blob-based segmentation and individual fruit\
    \ detection. In the ﬁrst\ntwo steps, decision trees were generated based on features\
    \ such as color, shape, texture and size and\nimage segmentations were conducted\
    \ using the generated trees. Finally, the automatical detection of\nindividual\
    \ fruit in multiple tomatoes was achieved by X-means clustering method. The results\
    \ of the\ntomato detection image test showed that their method achieved a recall\
    \ of 0.80, while the precision\nwas 0.88 [71]. Rahnemoonfar et al. proposed deep\
    \ learning architecture for counting fruits based\non convolutional neural networks.\
    \ They used synthetic images to train the neural network to save\ntime-consuming\
    \ collect and annotate. The network was trained for three epochs on 24,000 synthetic\n\
    images using an Adam optimizer and 100 randomly chosen images were tested. The\
    \ experimental\nresults demonstrated that their method had higher average accuracy\
    \ as comparing with others [72].\n3.7. Big Data\nThe protected agriculture produces\
    \ billions of dynamic, complex and spatial data including soil\ndatabases, greenhouse\
    \ environment data, livestock vaccination records and government investment\n\
    data. Compared with relational data structures that are logically expressed using\
    \ two-dimensional\ntables, agricultural data is more unstructured and has a large\
    \ number of hypermedia elements\nsuch as expert experience, knowledge and agricultural\
    \ models in the form of text, charts, pictures,\nanimations and voice/video [73].\
    \ The “big” of these data can be reﬂected in four dimensions: volume,\nvelocity,\
    \ variety and veracity [74]. Big Data technology is able to ﬁnd out the internal\
    \ links of collected\ndata through information mining and other means, discover\
    \ new information and provide data support\nfor the next operation. The most commonly\
    \ used techniques to deal with Big Data technology are\nimage processing, modeling\
    \ and simulation, machine learning, statistical analysis and geographical\ninformation\
    \ systems (GIS) [75].\n4. IoT Applications in Protected Agriculture\n4.1. Plant\
    \ Management\nCompared with open-ﬁeld agriculture, protected agriculture provides\
    \ a relatively suitable and\ncontrollable environment for crop growth by greenhouse\
    \ technology, which to some extent is free\nfrom the constraints of the natural\
    \ environment and promoted the intensive and eﬃcient use of\nagricultural resources.\
    \ However, spatial and temporal variability of crops’ growth environmental\nparameters\
    \ in the protected agriculture are strong and aﬀect each other [76,77], which\
    \ made it diﬃcult\nto adapt to the growth of diﬀerent types of plants in diﬀerent\
    \ growth stages by traditional cultivation\nand environmental regulation. Therefore,\
    \ it needs higher accuracy in the aspect of monitoring and\ncontrol. Many works\
    \ have attempted to design and test types of monitoring and control systems to\n\
    adjust greenhouse environmental parameters such as air temperature and humidity,\
    \ light intensity\nand CO2 concentration based on IoT and their results have proven\
    \ it is technically and economically\nfeasible [78]. At the low level of IoT development,\
    \ the environmental data were simply processed and\nusually presented in sheet\
    \ and plot form [79,80]. Later, some studies collected huge amounts of data\n\
    to set up various models based on plant growth or greenhouse climate [81–83],\
    \ which contributed\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n11 of 24\nto predicting the crop\
    \ yield and environment parameter changes to help farmers better manage\ngreenhouse.\
    \ CAI et al. developed a low-cost smart greenhouse remote monitor system based\
    \ on IoT.\nThe system used STM32F103 single chip machine and sensors to collect\
    \ environmental information\nand transferred the data to cloud by LPWAN. Security\
    \ link was established with TLS, which reduced\nsystem costs while ensuring the\
    \ security of data transmission. At the same time, they adopted a time\nseries\
    \ database to store data so that tremendous storage space can be saved [84]. He\
    \ et al. have reported\na greenhouse temperature intelligent control system based\
    \ on NB-IoT. The relative error of greenhouse\nenvironmental information collection\
    \ was below 1%, the average control accuracy was 3.57% (±1.0 ◦C),\nthe transmission\
    \ distance was not limited and the automatic regulation of crop growth temperature\n\
    was realized [85].\nNowaday, with the development of cloud computing, ML, etc.,\
    \ IoT solution can easily achieve\nsmart data processing and analyzing at low\
    \ cost and in a convenient way [86,87]. At the same time,\ngreenhouse technology\
    \ has also undergone several generations of upgrades and has now evolved into\n\
    highly mechanized and automated plant factories. Deng et al. have implemented\
    \ a closed-loop control\nsystem in a salad-cultivating plant factory based on\
    \ the kinetic model. Both digital simulation and\nreal-time results demonstrated\
    \ the system can work stably under the internal variations and external\ndisturbances\
    \ [88]. Zamora-Izquierdo et al. developed a smart farming IoT platform based on\
    \ edge and\ncloud computing, which was designed for soilless culture greenhouses\
    \ at low cost. The platform was\ncomposed of local, edge and cloud parts: the\
    \ local part dealt with data gathering and automatic control\nthough Cyber-Physical\
    \ Systems, the edge part took main management tasks and could improve the\nstability\
    \ of this systems, the cloud part was in charge of data analytics. Compared with\
    \ a regular\nopen control, the platform saved more than 30% water [89]. Katsoulas\
    \ et al. have designed an\nonline irrigation system for hydroponic greenhouse\
    \ crops and their results indicated it increased\nwater and fertilizer use eﬃciency\
    \ by 100% [90]. Liao et al. implemented a IoT-based system in\nan orchid greenhouse\
    \ to monitor the environmental factors and the growth status of phalaenopsis.\n\
    They developed an image processing algorithm to estimate the leaf area of phalaenopsisthe\
    \ and\nidentiﬁed the relationship between growth of plant leaves and environmental\
    \ factors. The proposed\nsystem could provide quantitative information with high\
    \ spatiotemporal resolution for ﬂoral farmers\nand contribute to updating farming\
    \ strategies for phalaenopsis in the future [91].\nDiseases and insect pests bring\
    \ a great threat to the growth of crops as and traditional technology\nand chemical\
    \ prevention and control has a certain lag and negative impact [92,93]. The rise\
    \ of IoT\nhas brought more eﬃcient and smarter solutions to crop disease and pest\
    \ control. Many types of\nIoT sensors can collect information about location,\
    \ greenhouse environment status, crop growth and\npest situation anywhere in real-time,\
    \ which helps farmers keep track of crop pests and diseases.\nThen, all raw image\
    \ and data are sent to cloud centers and later processed and analyzed by various\n\
    models and algorithms based on diﬀerent diseases and pests [94,95]. Finally, these\
    \ cloud centers\ngenerally provide farmers with the following services: disease\
    \ or pest identiﬁcation, disaster prediction\nand warning and recommended governance\
    \ measures from expert systems. Tirelli et al. proposed\na pest insect trap automatic\
    \ monitoring system using ZigBee technology, which can estimate the\ninsect density\
    \ by collected data from diﬀerent sites and send a warning message to farmers\
    \ when it\nexceeded the set value [96]. Ahouandjinou et al. proposed a pest monitoring\
    \ system which detected\nthe presence of pests by the acquisition of ultrasound\
    \ and assisted others in building up protocols\nfor early exterminate of the pests\
    \ [97]. Foughali et al. presented a potato late blight prevention and\ndecision\
    \ support system using cloud IoT and helped the agriculturists take eﬀective action\
    \ to treat\nthis disease [98]. Both Semios and Spensa Company launched their own\
    \ integrated pest management\nsystem, which was able to count the number of pests\
    \ by images, as well as characterize and capture\nthe insects. At present, pest\
    \ and disease warning research mainly provides medium and long-term\nwarning based\
    \ on historical data, which can provide macro guidance for crop production but\
    \ low\ntimeliness. Therefore, future research should focus on online monitoring\
    \ as well as diagnosis and early\nwarning of agricultural diseases.\nSensors 2019,\
    \ 19, 1833\n12 of 24\n4.2. Animal Farming\nLivestock and aquatic product farming\
    \ is an important part of protected agriculture and an area\nwhere IoT applications\
    \ have achieved good results. To achieve good control eﬀects in animal breeding,\n\
    IoT should not only overcome harsh environmental factors, but also pay attention\
    \ to the eﬀects of animal\nbehaviors [99,100]. IoT have been applied in monitoring\
    \ and management of environment, animal,\nfeed and farming process [101,102].\
    \ The livestock monitoring items include information such as body\ntemperature,\
    \ weight, behavior, exercise volume, food intake, disease information and environmental\n\
    factors, which can help people understand animal’s own physiological and nutritional\
    \ status and\nadaptability to external environmental conditions. In aquaculture,\
    \ management projects focus on water\nquality such as dissolved oxygen content,\
    \ water temperature and pH value [103,104] because water\nquality greatly aﬀects\
    \ the growth of aquatic animals. With animal growth and nutrient optimization\n\
    model and intelligent IoT equipment, it is possible to realiaze automatic feeding\
    \ and optimal control of\nfeeding time and intake according to their growth cycle,\
    \ individual quality, feeding cycle and eating\nsituation [105,106]. The Osborne\
    \ Industrial Company has produced TEAM automated electronic sow\nfeeding (ESF)\
    \ stations including pregnancy stations and estrus detection stations. The ESF\
    \ stations\nidentify the sow through the RFID tags worn by each sow and deliver\
    \ the corresponding quantity\nand type of feed based on information such as parity,\
    \ lyrical condition and gestational age. The estrus\ndetection stations can detect\
    \ rutting sows in the sow population and their detection accuracy is 7%\nhigher\
    \ than the manual ones. Encinas et al. presented a distributed monitoring IoT\
    \ system for\nwater quality monitoring. Their model was able to help ﬁsheries\
    \ acquire water quality parameters\nsuch as pH and temperature data in real time\
    \ to optimize pond resources and prevent unwanted\nconditions [107]. Soto-Zarazu´a\
    \ et al. proposed an automated recirculation tilapia farming system\nbased on\
    \ the fuzzy algorithm. The results of this work showed that it saved water by\
    \ 97.42% and\nthe water quality environmental parameters were controlled within\
    \ the acceptable range of tilapia\nculture [108]. Many researches have focused\
    \ on analysis of animal behavior, health care and diagnosis\nand warning of diseases\
    \ based on IoT [109–111]. Yazdanbakhsh et al. proposed an intelligent livestock\n\
    surveillance system. They attempted many machine learning algorithms to process\
    \ raw data of\nhealthy and ill cows and ﬁnally obtained good results used a wavelet-domain\
    \ ensemble classiﬁer with\n80.8% sensitivity and 80% speciﬁcity [112]. Wens Group,\
    \ the largest livestock breeding enterprise\nin China, took the lead in carrying\
    \ out research on the animal husbandry based on IoT and built\nthe corresponding\
    \ system for monitoring livestock vital signs, behavior and breeding environment\n\
    information [113]. Liu et al. collected a variety of penaeus vannamei information\
    \ such as real-time data\non the culture environment, disease image data and expert\
    \ disease diagnosis and treatment and ﬁnally,\nconstructed a remote intelligent\
    \ diagnosis model based on IoT [114]. Liu et al. proposed a web-based\ncombined\
    \ nutritional model for precisely predicting the growth, feed amount and nitrogen\
    \ phosphorus\noutput of gibel carp [115]. The current online diagnostics and early\
    \ warning of animal diseases is at an\nearly stage due to the lack of corresponding\
    \ sensors and models. With upgrading of hardware and\nartiﬁcial intelligence algorithms,\
    \ future research should focus on the improvement of Big Data depth\nalgorithm\
    \ and the establishment of comprehensive models of animal behavior and disease.\n\
    A few studies have made in-depth research in monitoring animal odor and hazardous\
    \ gas\nproduced during the breeding process such as ammonia gas and sulfur dioxide\
    \ [116]. Pan developed\nan electronic nose network system for monitoring and real-time\
    \ analysis of odors from livestock\nfarms. They placed e-noses in and around the\
    \ farm to build up a wireless network to measure odor\ncompounds as well as environmental\
    \ parameters [117].\n4.3. Agri-food Supply Chain Traceability\nNowday, agricultural\
    \ products/food safety issues are receiving worldwide attention and their\nsafety\
    \ traceability is one solution accepted by all parties of Agri-food domains. Governments\
    \ in many\ncountries and regions have promulgated laws and regulations to promote\
    \ the establishment of food\ntraceability system and strengthen the supervision\
    \ of agricultural products/food safety. The Agri-food\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n\
    13 of 24\nsupply chain traceability IoT-based system can ensure food safety and\
    \ quality at each link of the\nproduction, from the cropland to the consumer (Figure\
    \ 6), which could help consumers establish\nconﬁdence in food safety and contribute\
    \ to sustainable development of the whole food industry [118].\n \n4.3. Agri-food\

    \ still played an important role in \nAgri-food supply chain traceability due\

    \ Wang et al. proposed a food safety pre-warning system based on association\n\
    rules mining and IoT. It included four modules: information source, warning analysis,\
    \ reaction and\nemergency feedback. First, they accessed food critical information\
    \ through data processing and\nanalysis of food traceability data for safety assessment.\
    \ On this basis of this data, the system used the\nassociated data mining method\
    \ to discover the connection between them and then obtained the food\nsafety risk\
    \ analysis results. Subsequently, the system made a corresponding early warning\
    \ response\nbased on this result [129].\nRecently, the increasing incidents of\
    \ food falsiﬁcation have not only brought about great economic\nlosses, but also\
    \ undermined consumers’ conﬁdence in food safety. The blockchain technology with\n\
    decentralization, non-tamperability, development transparency and machine autonomy\
    \ features\nbrings new solutions to the above problems [130,131]. Tian et al.\
    \ reported a new decentralized\ntraceability system based on IoT and blockchain\
    \ technology, which can provid an open, transparent,\nneutral, safe and reliable\
    \ information platform for producers, governments, consumers and other\nstakeholders\
    \ [132]. Kaijun et al. combined the supply chain and blockchain technology to\
    \ propose\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n14 of 24\na double chain architecture agricultural\
    \ traceability system by studying the dual chain structure and\nits storage mode,\
    \ resource rent-seeking and matching mechanism and consensus algorithm [133].\n\
    Now, with the innovation and maturity of related technologies, it is not diﬃcult\
    \ for researchers to\ndevelop a complete set of traceability systems. The rise\
    \ of artiﬁcial intelligence technology enables\nexisting traceability systems\
    \ to provide automation, intelligence and human services to businesses\nand consumers.\
    \ Chen et al. adopted fuzzy cognitive maps and fuzzy rule method to come up with\n\
    an autonomous tracing system for backward design in food supply chain based on\
    \ IoT, which better\ntraced food product problems [134]. However, there are still\
    \ some problems in food safety traceability.\nIt is worth noting that the current\
    \ agricultural product safety traceability system only focuses on\na certain level\
    \ of supply chain or a certain type of goods. With the participation of multiple\
    \ projects\nor multiple sessions, we believe that the focus of future research\
    \ should be on more complex and\nsystematic supply chains.\n5. Disscussion\n5.1.\
    \ Hardware and Software Challenges\nWhen IoT technology is applying in protected\
    \ agriculture, it is inevitable to encounter challenges\nfrom all aspects. In\
    \ the perception layer, various devices must face the harsh and complex greenhouse\n\
    environment. Strong solar radiation, high temperatures, high humidity, strong\
    \ vibrations and other\nhazards can easily damage or destroy sensors or end devices.\
    \ Moreover, the daily activities of livestock\ncan interfere with the work of\
    \ the sensor or execution nodes, resulting in poor detection and control.\nIn\
    \ a general way, the information collection nodes rely on the battery with limited\
    \ power to maintain\nits work because the behavior of frequent battery replacement\
    \ consume a lot of energies and money.\nTherefore, it is an urgent need to make\
    \ great progress in developing low-power acquisition equipment,\nenergy-saving\
    \ sink node routing protocols and energy-balanced communication algorithms [135].\n\
    The devices places in various places generate incalculable data and the storage\
    \ of such data\nis also a huge challenge for some small servers.\nThose agricultural\
    \ IoT data have real-time,\ndynamic, granular and fragmented characteristics,\
    \ which brings great challenges to intermediate\ndesign, data large-scale screening,\
    \ screening, mining, processing and decision analysis techniques.\nMoreover, existing\
    \ databases cannot store unstructured data such as audio, video and images. As\
    \ a result,\nquite a lot real-time sensing data are not fully exploited. Besides,\
    \ some models and algorithms are not\nenough to to reﬂect objective reality, so\
    \ that they cannot eﬀectively guide agricultural production.\n5.2. Network Challenge\n\
    In protected agriculture, the sensor and device need to continuously operate under\
    \ the harsh\nand varied environment and their arrangement is sparse and irregular.\
    \ Compared with the wired\nnetwork with high wiring costs, the wireless network\
    \ has the advantages of low cost, good networking\nﬂexibility and high scalability\
    \ and therefore becomes the main application mode of the current\nmonitoring system.\
    \ Many actual deployments have displayed that common wireless communication\n\
    technologies are aﬀected by temperature, humidity andbuildings or other spatial\
    \ barriers [136–138].\nThe growth of animals and plants changes also result in\
    \ background noise [139] because of the\nmulti-path propagation eﬀects, which\
    \ lows reliability of data transmission. It is easy to isolate a node in\nthe\
    \ original communication network due to low node deployment density and the above\
    \ obstacles in\nprotected agriculture. If this node is responsible for communication\
    \ routing tasks of many devices and\nthis node is damaged and isolated from the\
    \ network, this will cause partial or even paralysis of most of\nthe network.\
    \ Most relevant theories and research needes on the eﬀects of the crop growth,\
    \ the thickness\nand material of wall, and the radio signal transmission loss\
    \ and electromagnetic wave transmission\nbetween soil and air interface, etc.\
    \ To determine the optimal position, height and network topology\nof sensor nodes\
    \ under diﬀerent environmental conditions. On the other hand, ad hoc intelligent\n\
    wireless network technology is needed to reduce or avoid paralysis of large-area\
    \ networks. The rise of\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n15 of 24\nLPWAN may solve e above\
    \ paralysis problems of WLAN due to its long communication distance,\nwhich obviates\
    \ the need for the dense and expensive deployments of relays and gateways altogether.\n\
    However, the cost of erecting LPWAN base stations is high.\nThe process of recording\
    \ various agricultural products’ status from the ﬁeld to the table\ngenerates\
    \ a large amount of data, which brings great challenges to wireless communication\
    \ with\na low transmission rate. At same times, it also brought network nodes\
    \ many problems in energy\ndistribution, data calculation, storage and communication.\
    \ Therefore, there is an urgent need to\ndevelop high-capacity data and real-time\
    \ broadband communication standards for technologies in\ncomplex agricultural\
    \ application environments.\n5.3. Security Challenge\nThe problems of security\
    \ and privacy are thought as crucial challenges in applications of protected\n\
    agriculture due to real-world examples of losses due to vulnerabilities, network\
    \ attacks or privacy issues.\nAs a multi-network heterogeneous converged network,\
    \ it not only has the same security problems as\nsensor networks, mobile communication\
    \ networks and the Interne, but also has its particular issues\nsuch as privacy\
    \ protection issues, authentication and access control issues for heterogeneous\
    \ networks,\nstorage and management of information issues, etc.\nIn the perception\
    \ layer, security threats are mainly against the WSN and RFID. In agricultural\n\
    applications, many of the sensor nodes are deployed in the long-term unsupervised\
    \ farmland\nenvironment and the wireless network itself is open, so the wireless\
    \ transmission is vulnerable to\nexternal interference and illegal users. Coupled\
    \ with the fact that these devices are respectively\nplaced elsewhere, a single\
    \ security measure is not enough [140]. The main threats to WSN include\neavesdropping\
    \ attack, node capture, replay attack and information wiretapping. So multiple\
    \ security\nmechanisms such as anonymity mechanism, data encryption and identity\
    \ authentication mechanisms\nare necessary [141,142].\nThe security threat of\
    \ RFID refers mainly to the attacks that are encountered when the RFID\nreader\
    \ and the tag communicate and such attacks usually lead to user privacy. In addition,\
    \ because the\nRFID tag is rewritable, the security and validity of the RFID tag\
    \ data will not be guaranteed.\nThere are lots of ways to enhance RFID tag security\
    \ such as modifying tag frequency, enciphered data.\nSensor nodes are diﬀerent\
    \ from RFID tag because they are active and relate to the dynamic properties of\n\
    things. Therefore, when applying encryption algorithms, key distribution policies,\
    \ intrusion detection\nmechanisms and security routing policies in speciﬁc devices,\
    \ we need to consider the limitations of\ntheir own hardware.\nSince networks\
    \ of diﬀerent architectures need to be connected to each other, there are even\n\
    greater challenges in terms of security authentication across network architectures.\
    \ The transport\nlayer will encounter the following security challenges: proxy\
    \ attacks, DoS (Denial-of-Service) attacks,\nmalicious code injection, man-in-the-middle\
    \ attacks, attacks across heterogeneous networks, etc.\nThe common measures dealt\
    \ with these network layer threats and attacks are: authorization,\nauthentication,\
    \ encryption, anti-virus protection, etc. IoT terminal devices in protected agriculture\n\
    have the characteristics of weak computing power and small storage space. Due\
    \ to limited resources,\nIoT encryption technology must be an easy to implement,\
    \ lightweight security technology that is\nsuitable for use in sensitive information\
    \ environments [143,144].\nWhen massive agricultural data is transmitted to the\
    \ application layer, in addition to the intelligent\nprocessing of data, data\
    \ security and privacy should also be considered. At this level, a large amount\n\
    of private data about users is collected, such as the consumption of agricultural\
    \ materials, the purchase\ninformation of fruits and vegetables and the location\
    \ of agricultural machinery. Therefore, the database\naccess control strategy\
    \ should be strengthened on the basis of intelligent data processing. When diﬀerent\n\
    users access the same data, they should limit their permissions and operations\
    \ according to their security\nlevel or identity, eﬀectively ensuring data security\
    \ and privacy. On the other hand, application layer\nservice providers should\
    \ accelerate the development and upgrade of authentication mechanisms\nSensors\
    \ 2019, 19, 1833\n16 of 24\nand encryption mechanisms for application scenarios\
    \ such as agricultural production, processing,\ntransportation and consumption.\n\
    5.4. Other Challenges\nThere are other challenges that need to be addressed, which\
    \ are related to the further application of\nIoT technology in protected agriculture.\
    \ Thousands of devices which have huge diﬀerences in processor,\nmemory, communication\
    \ protocol and programming language are deployed in protected agriculture,\nwhich\
    \ inevitably results in heterogeneity issues. Besides, most of devices in protected\
    \ agriculture are\nconnected to the cloud or others by the non-standard heterogeneous\
    \ interfaces [14,22]. This has led\nto problems of both device heterogeneity and\
    \ data heterogeneity. The device heterogeneity problem\naﬀects the scalability\
    \ of IoT in protected agriculture and the data heterogeneity problem hinders the\n\
    use of fusion information by models [145]. Although many research institutes,\
    \ hardware and software\nmanufacturers and related organizations have made a lot\
    \ of contributions to the standardization and\ndeployment of IoT in agriculture,\
    \ it still needs to establish a complete and clear structure, protocols and\n\
    standards to connect various heterogeneous devices and services [146,147].\nThe\
    \ cost has always been a barrier to the large-scale application of IoT to ordinary\
    \ farmers,\nespecially in developing countries like China and India. Despite a\
    \ large number of embedded devices\nand platforms have emerged and the cost of\
    \ hardware and software is rapidly decreasing, but here is\nanother situation\
    \ in high-quality and high-precision sensors and devices. Moreover, some funds\
    \ are\nneeded to train farmers to become proﬁcient in the use of IoT equipment.\
    \ In order to be able toplay\na better role in the future, the cost of sensing,\
    \ transmission, analysis and application components and\nequipment on the IoT\
    \ need to further reduce in order to lower the price and make it more aﬀordable\n\
    in the next decade [148]. Government departments should recognize the signiﬁcant\
    \ potential for the\ndevelopment of IoT in protected agriculture and increase\
    \ investment and support through policies and\nfunds to attract more capital and\
    \ achieve rapid development and application.\nIn addition, the usability of the\
    \ terminal device needs to be further improved, for example, the user\ninterface\
    \ needs to be friendlier andthe device needs to be more convenient in size and\
    \ easy to carry.\nIoT brings many beneﬁts to ecological environment and brings\
    \ some problems.. More and\nmore equipment is being placed in agriculture andso\
    \ the issues of environmental friendliness should\nreceive some attention in the\
    \ future. As the e-waste generated by IoT devices and the consumption of\nenergy\
    \ are gradually increasing, the sustainable development of the ecological environment\
    \ is also one\ncommon concern. Examples of interesting research topics include\
    \ the use of degradable materials and\nrenewable energy sources, the reduction\
    \ of equipment size and the use of energy-saving algorithms\nand new green ICT\
    \ technology [149,150].\nThe application of the Internet of Things in facility\
    \ agriculture needs to consider the socio-economic\nconsequences. On the one hand,\
    \ it increases the level of intelligence in agricultural monitoring,\ncontrol\
    \ and decision-making, thereby increasing the eﬃciency and quality of agricultural\
    \ production.\nAt the same time, it will also change the demand for the existing\
    \ agricultural workforce, causing some\npeople who are engaged in simple repetitive\
    \ tasks to lose their jobs, which will cause a series of\nsocial problems.\n5.5.\
    \ Future Prospects\nIoT technology is being applied to many ﬁelds of society,\
    \ economy and life at an unprecedented\nspeed, making human society step into\
    \ a new era of high intelligence. IoT technology is evolving\nand mature, and\
    \ many novel deployments and applications are constantly being built in protected\n\
    agriculture. Based on the above analysis and discussion of the key technologies\
    \ and applications of IoT\nin the protection of agriculture, we will present its\
    \ future development prospects and key research and\ndevelopment directions in\
    \ the following aspects. In the perception layer, the development of sensors\n\
    should focus on new sensitive materials, mechanisms, processes and methodologies\
    \ as well as low\npower consumption and low cost. Besides, we must accelerate\
    \ the development of sensors and rapid\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n17 of 24\ndetection\
    \ devices soil, animal and plant life. At the network layer, we should focus on\
    \ high-capacity data\nreal-time broadband communication standards and technologies\
    \ for complex agricultural application\nenvironments, high-reliability, adaptive,\
    \ low-power network deployment and management strategies\nand algorithms. With\
    \ wide coverage, high capacity, low power consumption and low cost, LPWAN is\n\
    ideal for some agricultural scenarios where text-based, video and voice service\
    \ support is not required\nand coverage, power consumption and cost are critical.\
    \ Future research and deployment should\nfocus on IoT solutions based on LPWAN.\
    \ In the application layer, governments and organizations\nshould develop uniﬁed\
    \ standards for the sensors and identiﬁcation interface devices, data transmission\n\
    communication protocols, multi-source data fusion analysis processing and application\
    \ services in\nprotected agriculture through international cooperation or negotiation.\
    \ Software developers should\ndevelop large open source databases and signal processing\
    \ algorithm libraries for diﬀerent areas\nof facility agriculture. For universities\
    \ and research institutes, cloud-based agricultural intelligent\ndecision-making\
    \ models, multi-source data-based information fusion algorithms, agricultural\
    \ Big Data\nmining technologies, distributed intelligent processing systems and\
    \ lightweight IoT authentication,\nencryption and authorization mechanisms will\
    \ be the key research directions for the future. With an\nincreased presence of\
    \ IoT technology in protected agriculture, its potential for the reﬁned management\n\
    of crop, livestock and aquatic animals will be recognized. Besides, as a technical\
    \ means to monitor\nthe production, processing, circulation and consumption of\
    \ agricultural products, IoTwill play an\nincreasingly important role in food\
    \ safety.\n6. Conclusions\nIn this survey, we present a comprehensive review of\
    \ the state-of-the-art in IoT deployment\nfor protected agriculture applications.\
    \ First, a simple review of previous IoT structure was given.\nSecondly, the basic\
    \ IoT architectures in protected agriculture were introduced. Next, discussions\
    \ of\nsensor, data communication, cloud computing, edge computing, ML and other\
    \ vital IoT technologies\nin protected agriculture are elaborated.\nThen, we highlight\
    \ various IoT applications and their\npotential to solve various farming problems\
    \ in protected agriculture. By classifying the research and\ndeployment literature\
    \ on IoT in protected agriculture, three important application ﬁelds were given:\n\
    plant management, animal farming and agri-food supply chain traceability. Finally,\
    \ a detailed analyses\nof IoT research challenges and future prospects were outlined.\n\
    The survey of the existing works directs us concluding remarks. The future prospects\
    \ of IoT in\nprotected agriculture are expectant, but the challenges mentioned\
    \ above must handle. In order to\ncope with its complex and changing agricultural\
    \ environment, the hardware devices must be fully\nupgraded to further enhance\
    \ their universality, reliability, expansibility, endurance and intelligence\n\
    level, while reducing costs and operative diﬃculty. Secondly, the local network\
    \ must be protected from\ninterference from other networks. In addition, the interoperability,\
    \ ﬁltering and semantic annotation of\ndata generated by the various devices of\
    \ IoT must be realized to a certain extent. Only in this way\ncan we optimize\
    \ the Big Data decision support model by using a large amount of heterogeneous\
    \ data.\nSecurity, anonymity and control over the access rights on the information\
    \ is vital for such a system to\nbe adopted. Finally, the impact of IoT on the\
    \ agroecological environment and social economy should\nbe considered in the application\
    \ of protected agriculture, to realize the sustainable development of\nagricultural\
    \ environment as quick as possible.\nAuthor Contributions: The collection, classiﬁcation\

    Abstract: The 21st century has seen rapid changes in technology, industry, and\
    \ social patterns. Most\nindustries have moved towards automation, and human intervention\
    \ has decreased, which has led\nto a revolution in industries, named the fourth\
    \ industrial revolution (Industry 4.0). Industry 4.0 or\nthe fourth industrial\
    \ revolution (IR 4.0) relies heavily on the Internet of Things (IoT) and wireless\n\
    sensor networks (WSN). IoT and WSN are used in various control systems, including\
    \ environmental\nmonitoring, home automation, and chemical/biological attack detection.\
    \ IoT devices and applications\nare used to process extracted data from WSN devices\
    \ and transmit them to remote locations. This\nsystematic literature review offers\
    \ a wide range of information on Industry 4.0, ﬁnds research gaps,\nand recommends\
    \ future directions. Seven research questions are addressed in this article: (i)\
    \ What\nare the contributions of WSN in IR 4.0? (ii) What are the contributions\
    \ of IoT in IR 4.0? (iii) What\nare the types of WSN coverage areas for IR 4.0?\
    \ (iv) What are the major types of network intruders\nin WSN and IoT systems?\
    \ (v) What are the prominent network security attacks in WSN and IoT?\n(vi) What\
    \ are the signiﬁcant issues in IoT and WSN frameworks? and (vii) What are the\
    \ limitations\nand research gaps in the existing work? This study mainly focuses\
    \ on research solutions and new\ntechniques to automate Industry 4.0. In this\
    \ research, we analyzed over 130 articles from 2014\nuntil 2021. This paper covers\
    \ several aspects of Industry 4.0, from the designing phase to security\nneeds,\
    \ from the deployment stage to the classiﬁcation of the network, the difﬁculties,\
    \ challenges, and\nfuture directions.\nKeywords: Internet of Things (IoT); industrial\
    \ revolution 4.0 (IR 4.0); computer networks; network\nsecurity; wireless sensor\
    \ networks (WSN); systematic literature review (SLR); state-of-the-art\n1. Introduction\n\
    Smart technologies play a crucial role in sustainable economic growth. They transform\n\
    houses, ofﬁces, factories, and even cities into autonomic, self-controlled systems\
    \ without\nhuman intervention [1]. This modern automation trend and ever-increasing\
    \ use of cutting-\nedge technologies are boosting the world’s economy [2]. The\
    \ Internet of Things (IoT)\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22062087\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n2 of 36\nand Wireless\
    \ Sensor Networks (WSN) both play vital roles in this modernization [3]. IoT\n\
    is a branch of engineering primarily concerned with offering thousands of miniature,\n\
    physical connected objects, which may collaborate to achieve a shared goal. IoT\
    \ has gained\nmuch importance due to the abundant usage of these tiny networked\
    \ devices. These\nare smart, yet basic things that can sense and communicate wirelessly\
    \ [4]. WSN is a\ncollection of sensor and routing nodes, as shown in Figure 1,\
    \ which may be put together\nin the environment to predict physical conditions,\
    \ such as wind, temperature, and many\nothers. These networks collect and process\
    \ data from tiny nodes and then transfer it to\nthe operators. Figure 2 illustrates\
    \ that sensor networks are used in a variety of control\nsystems, including environmental\
    \ monitoring, home automation, chemical and biological\nassault detection, smart\
    \ grid deployment [5], surveillance, and many more. WSN also plays\na signiﬁcant\
    \ role in aquaculture and the oil industry, including data collection, offshore\n\
    exploration, disaster prevention, tactical surveillance, and pollution monitoring\
    \ [6–8].\nFigure 1. Architecture of wireless sensor network (WSN).\nFigure 2.\
    \ Application of wireless sensor network (WSN).\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n3 of\
    \ 36\nWSN are often deployed in remote areas where human intervention is not possible\n\
    for post-deployment maintenance. Therefore, efforts are being made to enhance\
    \ their\nefﬁciency and durability [9]. There are many barriers to WSN deployment,\
    \ such as power\nconsumption–long-distance deployment. Due to automation trends\
    \ and applications devel-\noped, these barriers are no longer barriers for large-scale\
    \ remote deployment. In general,\nWSN follows a star topology to decrease the\
    \ network failure probability by connecting all\nsystems to a central node. While\
    \ ad-hoc networks follow mesh topology where each node\nis human-driven [10].\n\
    In physical production systems, grid and energy-saving applications minimize the\n\
    energy resources and noise pollution. In the last few decades, transportation\
    \ has improved\na lot with the usage of smart IoT devices, such as signals and\
    \ high-resolution cameras\non roads, which has led to an increase in trafﬁc ﬂow.\
    \ RFID readers are deployed at toll\nbooths that automatically deduct toll amounts\
    \ after reading RFID tags on vehicles. In the\ntransportation sector, smart vehicles\
    \ reduce the travelling time and also fuel consumption\nwith low cost of mobility\
    \ and reduced human efforts [11], atmospheric monitoring reduces\npollution, and\
    \ surveillance applications reduce crime. Nowadays, WSN also plays a role in\n\
    precision agriculture. On the other hand, WSN applications facilitate our day\
    \ to day lives,\nmaking them more comfortable, such as healthcare applications\
    \ that improve our health\nand longevity.\nBesides WSN, IoT has also played an\
    \ important role in human life. IoT and the digital\nage play essential roles\
    \ in overcoming social and physical barriers and providing ease\nand mobility\
    \ to people, resulting in improved and equal opportunities, and access to\ninformation\
    \ [12,13]. IoT also has many application areas such as agribusiness, climate,\n\
    clinical care, education, transportation, and ﬁnance, as shown in Figure 2.\n\
    In regard to information and communication technology, researchers are attracted\
    \ to\nIoT [14]. By adopting this essential technology, companies have become smarter,\
    \ more\ncompetitive, automated, and sustainable in the global supply chain. In\
    \ today’s competitive\nmarketplace, supply chains are struggling as they compete\
    \ with each other. Therefore,\nIoT devices are an effective way to authenticate,\
    \ monitor, and track products using GPS\nand many technologies [15,16]. Industry\
    \ 4.0 stands for the fourth industrial revolution\nin the digital age, it is associated\
    \ with virtualizing real-world scenarios of production\nand processing without\
    \ human intervention. This virtual world is linked to IoT devices,\nallowing the\
    \ creation of cyber–physical systems to communicate and cooperate [17,18].\nThis\
    \ fully connected manufacturing system—operating without human intervention by\n\
    generating, transferring, receiving, and processing necessary data to conduct\
    \ all required\ntasks for producing all kinds of goods—is one of Industry 4.0’s\
    \ key “constructs”. The con-\ncept of Industry 4.0 is based on the combination\
    \ of three main elements: people, things,\nand business [19]. A complete cyber–physical\
    \ production system created by the integration\nof IoT devices, things and objects\
    \ (IoT), sensor nodes (WSN), and people, is shown in\nFigure 3. CPS is a typical\
    \ example of Industry 4.0. IoT is the connection of smart devices,\nobjects, or\
    \ machines to the internet and with each other. In WSN systems, there is no direct\n\
    connection of these devices to the Internet. These systems can send their data\
    \ to the Internet\nby connecting several sensor nodes to a central routing node.\
    \ While CPS systems involve\nthe integration of IoT devices, computation, networking,\
    \ and physical process, IoT is an\nessential component of CPS. CPS systems are\
    \ key elements in the implementation of IR\n4.0 [20]. Industry 4.0 is the network-enabled\
    \ entity that automates the whole process of\nmanufacturing, connecting business\
    \ and processes. Market demands and the advance-\nments in new technologies are\
    \ transforming manufacturing ﬁrms’ business operations\ninto smart factories and\
    \ warehouses. Due to this automation, IoT devices are producing a\nmassive amount\
    \ of data daily, known as big data [21,22]. Statistics show that, at the end of\n\
    2021, there were more than 10 billion active IoT devices globally [23]. By 2030,\
    \ the number\nof active IoT devices is expected to exceed 10 billion to 25.4 billion.\
    \ By 2025, the data created\nby IoT devices will reach 73.1 ZB (zeta bytes) [24].\
    \ In 2020, the IoT industry was predicted\nto generate more than USD 450 billion,\
    \ including hardware, software, systems integration,\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n\
    4 of 36\nand data services. By the end of 2021, it reached USD 520 billion. The\
    \ global amount\nexpected to be spent on the IoT in 2022 is USD 1 trillion. The\
    \ IoT industry is predicted to\ngrow to more than USD 2 trillion by 2027 [25,26].\
    \ The increasing number of devices and the\nusage by humans shows the importance\
    \ of IoT devices; moreover, the industry is growing\nand gaining revenue.\nFigure\
    \ 3. CPS system–integration of IoT, wireless devices, and people in Industry 4.0.\n\
    In this paper, we conduct a detailed systematic literature review on the applications\n\
    and contributions of IoT and WSN in Industry 4.0. We had a large corpus of data\
    \ to\nanalyze papers using systematic approaches. Among the selected articles,\
    \ we obtained\n22 articles describing the detailed review of existing security\
    \ techniques, applications used,\nadvantages/disadvantages, and limitations of\
    \ IoT and WSN. Most of them reviewed the\narticles in terms of application of\
    \ IoT and attacks only. The paper mainly focuses on research\nchallenges, issues,\
    \ limitations, and the future direction of IoT and WSN frameworks in\nIndustry\
    \ 4.0.\n1.1. Motivation\nThe primary motivation for performing SLR is the ever-increasing\
    \ trend of automation\nin Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 is made up of both WSN technology\
    \ and IoT to digitize work.\nOver time, we see how digitization and technology\
    \ are replacing people in the workplace,\nand dramatically changing the global\
    \ workforce. Technology has brought ease to human\nlife and the efﬁciency of things\
    \ by making them eco-friendly, more agile, and productive.\nFrom smart cities\
    \ to smart industries, a drastic change has happened due to the intelligent\n\
    usage of IoT and WSN and IR 4.0. For example, a smart factory integrates virtual\
    \ and\nphysical systems and calibrating instruments to record their readings immediately.\
    \ In short,\nthe integration of IoT and WSN with Industry 4.0 has reduced labour\
    \ needs, freed humans\nfrom low-level skilled work, and improved the quantity\

    \ better analysis results, we systematically analyzed almost all research data\
    \ related\nto IoT and WSN domains in Industry 4.0.\n1.2. Contribution\nFrom smart\
    \ factories to individual lives, IoT and WSN play signiﬁcant roles. There are\n\
    many advantages, but security problems have arisen as these devices generate considerable\n\
    amounts of data daily. These papers amalgamated both sides: IoT and WSN contributions\n\
    and their security risks. This paper focuses more on the contributions of IoT\
    \ and WSN in\nIndustry 4.0 and presents an in-depth review and analysis of IoT\
    \ and WSN. The paper’s\nmain contribution involves formulating research questions\
    \ from ﬁltered data and building\na strong work foundation using SLR methods.\
    \ We discuss various applications and security\nattacks in IR 4.0. Furthermore,\
    \ new ﬁndings of the paper pertain to the key challenges and\nopen issues of WSN\
    \ integrated with IoT in Industry 4.0, to optimize different criteria.\n1.3. Paper\

    \ the state-of-the-art research studies on IoT and WSN.\nWith the fourth industrial\
    \ revolution, it is observed that communication, computation,\nand storage costs\
    \ have remarkably decreased, which make integration of IoT and WSN\npossible and\
    \ cost-effective globally. We studied many review articles and original research.\n\
    Existing review articles lack, in many aspects, research challenges, issues, limitations,\n\
    and future directions of IoT and WSN, but the systematic literature review (SLR)\
    \ given\nin this work is precise enough to deal with the aspects of IoT and WSN\
    \ area. Related\nwork of review papers is provided next. Moreover, Table 2 is\
    \ presented which shows the\ncomparison between the proposed research work and\

    Key challenges and open\nissues of both IoT and\nWSN\nin\nIndustry\n4.0\nare discussed\n\
    ✓\nThe authors in [1] discussed the very novel technology “WiFi”. They discussed\n\
    how this technology helps IoT devices–used in various applications, such as smart\
    \ cities,\nhealthcare systems, and smart houses—communicate effectively. Landaluce\
    \ et al. [4]\ndiscussed RFID and WSN technology in detail. They discussed how\
    \ RFIDs are used to\ntrace devices while WSN gathers information about them from\
    \ interconnected devices. The\nauthors also discussed the obstacles and challenges,\
    \ such as energy consumption, fault-\ntolerant, communication interference, and\
    \ cost feasibility, along with detailed surveys. They\nprovided the advantages\
    \ and limitations of wearable sensor devices. Energy consumption\nis increasing\
    \ each day. Therefore, Dailipi [4] explored how IoT evolution has managed the\n\
    electricity consumption process and provided many beneﬁts to grid stations, consumers,\n\
    and suppliers. They also discussed the security issues and challenges after introducing\
    \ IoT\ndevices in smart grids.\nIn [6], the authors discussed how WSN advancement\
    \ had played a signiﬁcant role in\nUASN. They traced the location of sensor nodes\
    \ deployed underwater in the ocean using\nlocalization algorithms. They reviewed\
    \ many applications of UASN, their advantages\nand their disadvantages. They also\
    \ discussed the challenges they faced during deployment\nand presented future\
    \ directions in the acoustic area. In [10], researchers discussed the\nSensors\
    \ 2022, 22, 2087\n8 of 36\napplications and advantages of WSN being deployed everywhere\
    \ due to their ﬂexible and\ndynamic nature. They discussed each application of\
    \ WSN in urban areas and their solutions.\nThey analyzed how WSN deployment in\
    \ urban areas demanded much more care and\nattention due to harsh weather and\
    \ perverse channel conditions.\nWSN is applicable in many domains, such as industrial\
    \ automation, and the require-\nment elicitation of the industrial process is\
    \ different from general WSN requirement gather-\nings. In [17], the authors presented\
    \ some standard protocols that were used to measure the\nrequirements of industrial\
    \ applications. They also provide solutions to WSN protocols by\ndiscussing MAC,\
    \ routing, and transport in detail. They also discussed the security issues\n\
    in detail and identiﬁed the unsolved challenges encountered during designing standard\n\
    protocols. In [19], the authors conducted SLR, which is mainly focused on scope\
    \ deﬁnition,\nconcept, literature review, analysis, synthesis, and future research\
    \ directions. Their selected\nstudy has contributed to eight thematic perspectives:\
    \ intelligence factories, CPS, data\nhandling, IT infrastructure, digital transformation,\
    \ HCI, IoT, and cloud [18].\nDue to the rapid evolution in IoT and WSN, technology\
    \ is becoming more vulnerable\nto security threats [42–44]. Therefore authors\
    \ in [27] presented threat models for the security\nof WSN and IoT devices communication.\
    \ In [28], the authors discussed IoT applications,\nadvantages, challenges, and\
    \ security issues from both technological and social perspectives.\nResearchers\
    \ have provided detailed architectures of IoT and WSN and discussions of\nIDS\
    \ system protocols. They also discussed the security challenges and attacks on\
    \ IoT\nand WSN communication devices. Moreover, in [29], the authors conducted\
    \ extensive\nresearch related to smart homes, applications, and IoT. They collected\
    \ 229 articles, analyzed\nthem thoroughly, and divided them into four categories.\
    \ They discussed smart home IoT\napplications in the ﬁrst category. The second\
    \ category concerned with IoT applications\nin smart home technology. In the third\
    \ category, they developed a framework to operate\nfurther. In the fourth category,\
    \ they developed smart IoT home applications.\nIoT has dramatically changed human\
    \ life, especially regarding communication devices\nintegrating technologies.\
    \ Traditional industry is changing in the digital industry, and WSN\nand wireless\
    \ sensor and actuator networks (WSANs) are the core parts of Industry 4.0.\nIn\
    \ the article [30], the authors discussed the industrial wireless sensor network\
    \ (IWSN)\nand industrial wireless sensor and actuator network (IWSAN) in detail.\
    \ They discussed\nIWSAN requirements, applications, challenges, solutions, and\
    \ future directions in detail.\nIWSN/IWSAN are compelling technologies due to\
    \ their promising beneﬁts, such as low-\ncost deployment, less complexity, and\
    \ mobility support.\nIn [31], the authors discussed how IoT plays a vital role\
    \ in bringing the physical\nworld close to the digital world. They discussed technologies,\
    \ various challenges, future\ndirections, and various Internet of Things (IoT)\
    \ applications.\nIn [32], Sharma et al. have described the sensor nodes according\
    \ to coverage point of\nview. They analyzed the full coverage issues by considering\
    \ node type, deployment type,\ncommunication and sensing range, and positioning-based\
    \ independent algorithms. They\nalso discussed the research challenges of WSN.\n\
    Andrey et al. [33] described a detailed survey on IDS systems and presented the\n\
    methods proposed for IoT. Using a cross-platform distributed approach, they analyzed\n\
    the IDS system, their platform differences, and current research trends in IDS.\
    \ In [34], the\nauthors analyzed and discussed the solutions to identify and detect\
    \ sinkhole attacks in the\nWSN domain. They discussed the advantages and limitations\
    \ of the proposed solution as\nwell. In [35], the authors presented a detailed\
    \ review on security attacks of WSN and IoT\nalong with their preventive measures,\
    \ mitigations, and detection mechanisms. They stated\nthat the integration of\
    \ IoT and WSN has raised new challenges and open security issues.\nAlthough technology\
    \ has increased, it has become prone to external attacks.\nIn [36], the authors\
    \ presented a review on the security of mobile networks. They\ndiscussed the integration\
    \ of WSN with IoT via the Internet and how the inter-connected\ndevices have guarded\
    \ networks against external attacks, keeping the router in a secure and\nprotected\
    \ environment. They discussed the attacks and their detection mechanisms over\
    \ the\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n9 of 36\nInternet. Similarly, the authors in [37]\
    \ have discussed the wormhole attack and its solution\nin IoT and WSN domains.\
    \ They stated that the detection algorithm performed much\nbetter for IoT (70%)\
    \ than WSN (20%). In [45], the authors discussed side-channel attacks\nin smartphones.\
    \ Similarly, the authors in [38] discussed the security threats, challenges,\n\
    and solutions in the IoT domain. While in [39], the authors analyzed existing\
    \ protocols for\nsecure communication between IoT devices. They also discussed\
    \ open issues and challenges\nraised during the communication of IoT devices and\
    \ future directions in IoT. The authors\nin [40] presented a detailed review regarding\
    \ deployment schemes, classiﬁcation, working,\nand comparative analyses of sensor\
    \ nodes. This growing technology trend has converged\nthe “world sense” from traditional\
    \ systems to CPS—this transition is called Industry 4.0.\nThe authors in [41]\
    \ conducted a bibliometric review of 12 different approaches of critical\naspects\
    \ of Industry 4.0.\nFrom the above-detailed literature review, we noticed that\
    \ authors and researchers\nhave worked on IoT and WSN, but the integration of\
    \ both IoT & WSN with Industry 4.0 is\nbenign. They discussed their applications,\
    \ security attacks, advantages, and limitations at\neach level.\nThe proposed\
    \ paper is more oriented towards the applications and contributions of\nIoT and\
    \ WSN in Industry 4.0, along with the security attacks, their challenges, and\
    \ open\nissues in each domain. This paper also provides the limitations and future\
    \ directions for\nIoT and WSN in Industry 4.0.\n3. Research Methodology\nThe SLR\
    \ followed in this work is based on the template of IEEE SLR; all research\nsteps\
    \ and guidelines were followed using the same template. The research process and\n\
    results were manually evaluated by comparing different research methods and techniques\n\
    presented by different authors based on efﬁciency, security, limitations, and\
    \ performance.\nFirst, we formulated our research questions based on the reviewed\
    \ articles and then\nsearched for these keywords in various databases. Using avoidance\
    \ and consideration\ncriteria, only relevant papers were considered. Then, we\
    \ evaluated the quality of the papers,\nand then extracted the relevant features.\n\
    3.1. Planning Review\nThe planning of the review was based on the research questions\
    \ and their objectives.\nAnalyzes of IoT and WSN were conducted to show their\
    \ importance in daily life. The use of\nsmart and appropriate devices has been\
    \ studied in this ﬁeld but still needs critical analysis.\nTherefore, it is important\
    \ to make a systematic review article in this realm, especially\nrelated to IoT\
    \ and WSN, to show future directions. Therefore, we established the search\ntechnique,\
    \ search strings, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and quality assessment criteria\
    \ for\nthe papers collected from different repositories. Figure 4 shows the step\
    \ of our proposed\nreview planning process.\nFigure 4. Planning process of systematic\
    \ literature review (SLR).\n3.2. Research Goals\nThe main objective of this study\
    \ is to ﬁnd out the major contributions, solved problems,\nand challenges of IoT\
    \ and WSN in Industry 4.0. In addition, the research gap and limitations\nof current\
    \ work in these areas helped us ﬁnd room for improvement; we also explored\nfuture\
    \ directions and possible outcomes in this area. We designed questionnaires on\
    \ these\ndomains to ﬁnd high quality research papers. Some of them are listed\
    \ in Table 3. In addition,\nwe answer the research questions in Table 3 and in\
    \ Section 4 .\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n10 of 36\nTable 3. Research questions.\n\

    \ of Primary Studies\nIt was a challenge to search the speciﬁc and limited computer\
    \ science/engineering\ndatabases to get a “complete picture” of the research questions.\
    \ After formulating the\nresearch questions, we collected research papers from\
    \ various repositories, such as IEEE\nXplore, ACM, Wiley Online Search, Elsevier,\
    \ etc. The papers from electronic databases\nwith the areas of IoT, WSN, and Industry\
    \ 4.0 were efﬁciently evaluated. Figure 5 shows the\nnames of the repositories\
    \ where the research articles were collected from 2014 to June 2021.\nFigure 5.\
    \ Repositories versus number of studies Used.\n3.4. Selection/Search Criteria\n\
    This SLR combines three domains: IoT, WSN, and Industrial Revolution 4.0, so the\
    \ search\nstrings were related to each domain and its applications in Industry\
    \ 4.0. Table 4 shows the\nsubject search strings used to search for relevant articles.\
    \ The search strings were divided into\nfive groups to search for relevant articles\
    \ from reputable journals and conferences.\nTable 4. Search strings.\nSr. No.\n\

    \ research articles were found on the mentioned domains, IoT, WSN and IR 4.0.\n\
    To extract the most relevant and concise data from these articles, the following\
    \ criteria were\nchosen, as shown in Table 5. The publicly available papers written\
    \ in English and related\nto the search strings and research objectives in IoT,\
    \ WSN, and IR 4.0 published between\n2014 and 2021 were considered for further\
    \ SLR tracking.\nTable 5. Inclusion and exclusion criteria.\nInclusion Criteria\n\

    \ that were published in 2014–2021.\n3\nInclude papers that reﬂected enough knowledge\
    \ about the search strings and search objectives.\n4\nInclude papers whose titles,\
    \ keywords, abstracts, and conclusions provided enough information related to\n\
    WSN, IoT, and IR 4.0.\n5\nInclude papers whose content focused on WSN, IoT, and\
    \ IR 4.0 content and provided in depth insights.\nExclusion Criteria\n1\nExclude\
    \ papers written in a language other than the English language.\n2\nExclude gray\

    \ research papers containing less than three pages.\n5\nExclude papers that failed\
    \ to meet the inclusion criteria.\n3.6. Selection Results\nAs mentioned earlier,\
    \ the downloaded articles were based on the initial screening\nprocesses, which\
    \ were based on inclusion criteria. The articles were screened using the\ninitial\
    \ quality assessment criteria (QAC). The main objective of using the QAC was to\n\
    ensure that the primary studies selected were appropriate to address the concerns\
    \ of\nprevious studies. Nearly 300 articles were found on the above topics. After\
    \ applying\na duplication ﬁlter, 40 articles were discarded, leaving 260 articles\
    \ that were reviewed\nbased on the above exclusion criteria. In the next step,\
    \ 60 articles were excluded based\non the inclusion/exclusion criteria. A quality\
    \ analysis was performed for the remaining\n200 articles. After the quality analysis,\
    \ only 120 articles were reviewed. Figure 6 shows\nthe year-by-year distribution\
    \ of articles reviewed that were used for the SLR study. There\nis no doubt that\
    \ the eliminated articles contained valuable material, but they were not\nstudied\
    \ because they did not meet the screening criteria. The number of articles was\n\
    initially limited to 120, after which they were stored in the citation manager\
    \ software for\ninformation synthesis.\nThe selected papers were evaluated against\
    \ the quality assessment criteria (QAC)\nlisted in Table 6. Table 6 shows the\
    \ quality assessment criteria (QAC) used to screen the\narticles for response\
    \ grading. Studies selected for screening are described in Table 7. Studies\n\
    with a score greater than or equal to 80 were selected according to the grading\
    \ criteria\nshown in Figure 7.\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n12 of 36\nFigure 6. Year-wise\

    \ 2022, 22, 2087\n18 of 36\n4.1. RQ1: Contributions of WSN in IR 4.0\nThe use\
    \ of WSN has attracted a lot of attention in industry. Because of their prevalence\n\
    and use in industry, WSN have given rise to IWSN and IWSAN, respectively. These\
    \ net-\nworks enable autonomous work without human intervention. The in-network\
    \ transmission\ncharacteristics are fundamental properties of WSN. Sensor nodes\
    \ do not transmit raw\ndata, but integrate it to save communication costs. Due\
    \ to their unique properties and\nwide range of applications, they are used in\
    \ many systems, such as military, surveillance,\nhome automation, smart cities,\
    \ smart buildings, and healthcare monitoring [27]. WSN- and\nIoT-based devices\
    \ are used to create reliable, realistic, efﬁcient, ﬂexible, and economical\n\
    smart cities and buildings in heterogeneous environments [48].\nFigure 8. Taxonomy\
    \ of existing studies.\nThe categories discussed in this paper and the contribution\
    \ of WSN in IR 4.0 are\nlisted in the form of a taxonomy presented in Figure 8.\
    \ WSN is also used in health care\nmanagement systems to monitor medically ill\
    \ patients, periodically check their various\nmeasurements such as blood glucose\
    \ levels and pulse, and wirelessly transmit this in-\nformation to a central repository\
    \ for further diagnosis [49]. WSN is also used to assist\nelderly and disabled\
    \ people. Disabled people are informed of relevant information about\nreal-time\
    \ activities using smart devices, such as wristwatches [28,50]. In recent decades,\n\
    WSN have been applied in many ﬁelds, including transportation, agriculture [51],\
    \ automa-\ntion, manufacturing process control, and supply chain management. In\
    \ addition, WSN\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n19 of 36\ncan be easily deployed, have\
    \ low construction cost, no expenditure on wiring, and lower\ncomplexity [52,53].\n\
    WSN can be used in various manufacturing applications, such as industrial control,\n\
    process automation, rescue, and defense. WSN is also used to control and automate\n\
    industrial processes known as actuators. They can operate independently of a physi-\n\
    cal environment deﬁned by predeﬁned dimensions [54]. WSN is used to collect, track,\n\
    and record data in smart factories. Data acquisition is usually done by product\
    \ informa-\ntion in smart factories. After data collection, processing is done\
    \ by intelligent machines\nand manufacturing systems. Nowadays, these factories\
    \ are self-sufﬁcient, cost-effective,\nand automated by integrating wireless communications\
    \ with existing private networks\nand reducing labor [30].\nIn software, WSN takes\
    \ maximum advantage of wireless technologies used to build\nindustrial network\
    \ infrastructure [55]. On the other side, Industry 4.0 is integrating big data\n\
    analytics and cloud services [56], 3D printing, computer security, autonomous\
    \ robotics, the\nInternet of Things (IoT), 5G, Augmented Reality (AR), and modeling\
    \ [57,58].\n4.2. RQ2: Contributions of IoT in IR 4.0\nAn integrated digital system\
    \ would introduce a new intelligent and economical man-\nufacturing process using\
    \ cutting-edge technology for a variety of existing items and pro-\ncesses [59].\
    \ The data collected from production process warehouses and consumer in-\nformation\
    \ can be critically analyzed to make a decision in real time under Industry 4.0.\n\
    The real-time decision-making capability of each small and medium organization\
    \ enables\nthem to efﬁciently accept new technologies [60,61]. Industrial IoT\
    \ delivers solutions and\nservices that provide insights into an organization’s\
    \ ability to monitor and control its oper-\nations and assets. IIoT software and\
    \ tools provide important solutions for better process,\nlayout scheduling, organization,\
    \ and administration.\nIn addition, IIoT enables real-time and decision-making\
    \ features among numerous\nnetworked devices that can communicate and interact\
    \ with each other [62]. Because of\nthe rapid communication and data transfer,\
    \ attackers can attack data and cause harm to\nan organization, resulting in cyber\
    \ attacks. Cyber attacks have become a major challenge\nfor the industrial Internet\
    \ of Things (IIoT). Therefore, integrating IoT with Industry 4.0\nplays a critical\
    \ role in securing IoT devices from attacks. Unique security objectives and\n\
    challenges of IIoT have been introduced to overcome industrial-level issues. IIoT\
    \ challenges\nand objectives relate to IoT being used by consumers and its capabilities\
    \ leading to longer\nlife of IoT devices and sensor nodes. In [63], the authors\
    \ analyzed security challenges\nand attacks at three levels of the network (perception,\
    \ network, and application). They\nconsidered cryptographic challenges, authentication,\
    \ network monitoring, and access\ncontrol mechanisms. The IIoT also addresses\
    \ local network connectivity and protection\nfrom attackers inside. Cyber attacks\
    \ have become a serious challenge for the IIoT. Hackers\nattack infrastructure/devices\
    \ through intrusion and hiding, resulting in poor performance.\nA bidirectional\
    \ long and short term memory network with a multi-feature layer has been\ndeveloped\
    \ to avoid temporal attacks. Machine learning-based networks that learn temporal\n\
    attacks from historical data and make associations with test data can effectively\
    \ identify\nand detect different attacks within different intervals [64].\nDL-IIoT\
    \ has enormous potential to improve data processing and contribute to IR 4.0.\n\
    Similarly, machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, are widely\
    \ used for\nmalware detection and security threat protection [65]. Deep learning\
    \ algorithms are also\nused for intelligent analysis and processing. Deep learning\
    \ [46]algorithms such as CNN,\nauto-encoders, and recurrent neural networks have\
    \ applications such as intelligent assem-\nbly and manufacturing, network monitoring,\
    \ and accident prevention. The application\nof deep learning algorithms in IIoT\
    \ has also enabled various smart applications such as\nmanufacturing, active attack\
    \ detection and prevention systems, smart meters, and smart\nagriculture [66].\
    \ DL-IIoT relies heavily on data collection, which affects the privacy of the\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 2087\n20 of 36\norganization’s data. Therefore, differentiated\
    \ privacy is used to protect user privacy, reduce\nprivacy risk, and achieve high\
    \ performance in IIoT.\nOn the other hand, IoT and IIoT must provide “differentiated\
    \ privacy” for individuals\nand industrial data [67–69]. The contribution of IoT\
    \ in Industry 4.0 has improved the\naverage availability and sustainability of\
    \ the enterprise by knowing market trends and\ndecreasing unanticipated downturns\
    \ [70]. The taxonomy of existing studies and the\ncontribution of IoT in IR 4.0\
    \ is shown in Figure 8.\n4.3. RQ3: Type of WSN Coverage Area for IR 4.0\nWSN coverage\
    \ is an important factor in sensor quality. Sensing and connectivity\nare key\
    \ features of WSN. The former indicate how well a particular sensor behaves and\n\
    monitors a particular area of interest in which it is deployed. Connectivity shows\
    \ how\nwell different nodes communicate with each other. The types of wireless\
    \ sensor network\ncoverage are as follows.\n4.3.1. Area Coverage\nSensors usually\
    \ perform well in area coverage and monitors the ﬁeld of interest (FoI).\nThis\
    \ is also called “blanket coverage” because each node communicates with others.\
    \ Each\nsensor is placed so that the coverage of the other WSN sensors covers\
    \ each other [32].\n4.3.2. Barrier Coverage\nBarrier coverage of the sensor network\
    \ comes into play when some intruders try to\nbreach the security layer of the\
    \ network. Sensors are easy to handle and deploy; therefore,\ntheir wireless nature\
    \ makes them vulnerable to malicious security attacks [71]. The sensor\nnodes\
    \ are primarily distributed throughout the network and are deployed in chains\
    \ to\ndetect interruptions.\n4.3.3. Point Coverage\nPoint coverage aims to ﬁnd\
    \ a target within range using nearby nodes. It is also known\nas target coverage.\
    \ It is characterized by consuming less energy in a given zone than in the\nentire\
    \ region of the FoI. Only a few targets are covered by individual nodes, while\
    \ other\ntargets can be detected under other sensor scopes. The primary goal is\
    \ to select a speciﬁc\ntarget within the FoI to reduce energy consumption [71].\n\
    4.4. RQ4: Classiﬁcation of Network Intruders\nThere are two main types of intruders:\
    \ internal and external. Internal intruders are\npeople inside the organization;\
    \ they can be either a customer or a legitimate user, such\nas an employee of\
    \ the organization’s network. External intruders are people outside the\norganization,\
    \ whether external or internal. Each intruder can be involved in numerous\nillegal\
    \ activities, working alone, as a group, or with agencies. These entities are\
    \ described\nin detail below.\n4.4.1. Solo Entities\nSolo entities are those that\
    \ work alone with minimal safety. They are usually experts\nin their domains by\
    \ employing a single piece of code as equipment, such as viruses,\nworms, and\
    \ sniffers to misuse frameworks. They usually gain access to the organization’s\n\
    framework through hardware damage and web loopholes. Their targets are usually\
    \ little,\nand attacks are slightly less critical. Moreover, large and complex\
    \ systems that may contain\nﬂaws are more vulnerable to attacks. Monetary institutions\
    \ are also more exposed to attacks\nas they exchange sensitive information [72].\n\
    4.4.2. Organized Groups\nSolo entities are those who work alone with minimal security.\
    \ They are usually experts\nin their ﬁeld, using a single piece of code as equipment,\
    \ such as viruses, worms, and sniffers\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n21 of 36\nto abuse\
    \ frameworks. They generally gain access to the organization’s framework through\n\
    hardware damage and web loopholes. Their targets are usually small, and attacks\
    \ are\nsomewhat less critical. In addition, large and complex systems that may\
    \ contain ﬂaws are\nmore vulnerable to attack. Monetary institutions are also\
    \ more exposed to attacks because\nthey exchange sensitive information [72].\n\
    4.4.3. Intelligence Agencies\nIntelligent agencies from other countries are involved\
    \ in this type of attack. These\nagencies constantly seek to test the military\
    \ architecture of other nations, including contem-\nporary monitoring and covert\
    \ political and military activities. To do so, they require many\nresources, from\
    \ software to hardware, research, development, personnel, and ﬁnances.\nBecause\
    \ they have all these resources at their disposal, some agencies now pose a serious\n\
    threat to economic and military espionage. Such organizations pose the greatest\
    \ threat to\nnetworks and must be closely monitored to protect the nation’s important\
    \ assets [73].\n4.5. RQ5: Network Security Attack in IoT and WSN Layers\nThreats\
    \ become more attractive and dangerous as technology increases. Although new\n\
    security mechanisms are being developed, intruders can easily ﬁnd other ways to\
    \ attack\nsystems. Table 8 explains the network security attacks in the IoT and\
    \ WSN domains.\nThe attacks are categorized according to the open system interconnection\
    \ (OSI) layered\npoint of view [74].\nTable 8. Network Security Attacks on IoT\
    \ and WSN Layers.\nSr. No.\nLayer Name\nAttacks\n1\nPhysical layer\nInterception,\

    5\nApplication layer\nSpooﬁng, alter routing attack, false data ejection, path-based\
    \ DoS.\n4.5.1. Denial of Service Attacks (DOS)\nA Denial-of-service (DoS) attack\
    \ is a malicious attack in which attackers make the\nvictim’s system unresponsive\
    \ and difﬁcult to reach for the legitimate user by making many\nrequests to the\
    \ expected URL than the server can handle [75,76]. DoS attacks typically occur\n\
    when authenticated clients have not been granted access to the information or\
    \ service [77].\nA distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is a type of DoS\
    \ attack that uses multiple users\nor infected systems to attack a victim’s system\
    \ or to attack a website so that it becomes\nunresponsive. This attack also prevents\
    \ the website from functioning properly and disrupts\nregular trafﬁc. In WSN,\
    \ a DDoS attack changes the routing protocol information DSR,\nresulting in a\
    \ huge amount of unauthorized trafﬁc and making the network/website\nunavailable.\
    \ On the other hand, a low-rate denial-of-service (LDoS) attack is another type\n\
    of DoS that penetrates the WSN’s routing protocol, thus compromising the security\
    \ and\ntrust mechanisms. An LDoS attack is difﬁcult to detect due to its non-stationary\
    \ nature and\nlow signal strength52. In this attack, illegitimate trafﬁc affects\
    \ the operational capability of\na network. It causes severe outages and monetary\
    \ losses.\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n22 of 36\n4.5.2. Replay Attacks\nWhen an attacker\
    \ replays a ﬂood of messages between the sender and the receiver,\nupdating the\
    \ line table (DT) to steal information, it is called a replay attack [33]. It\
    \ is a\nnetwork layer attack in which a third party intercepts the data during\
    \ transmission. The\nattacker retransmits this data by either modifying or delaying\
    \ it, spooﬁng the sender’s IP\naddress to the attacker’s IP address, and impersonating\
    \ the legitimate sender.\n4.5.3. Trojan Worms, Viruses, and Malware\nAn attacker\
    \ can use malicious software to manipulate data, steal information, or\neven launch\
    \ a denial-of-service attack on a device. A worm, such as a Trojan horse, can\n\
    infect one’s computer when one downloads a ﬁle or receives an update. The worm\
    \ then\nmultiplies and attacks other machines on the network. Unlike a virus,\
    \ many Trojan horses\nusually reside on one’s own computer. A virus can infect\
    \ the host’s ﬁle when sent via\nemail and then spread to other users [78]. Malware\
    \ is malicious content that can interfere\nwith a computer’s operation and slow\
    \ its performance. When data from IoT devices is\ncompromised, malware can infest\
    \ the cloud or data centers. These attacks breach the\nprimary security mechanisms\
    \ of any OS/server, such as a ﬁrewall and window defender.\n4.5.4. Black Hole\
    \ Attacks\nThis is a network layer attack known as a packet drop attack. In this\
    \ attack, a node\nsends an RREQ packet to all its neighbors in the network, and\
    \ the router is supposed to\nforward the packet instead of discarding it. The\
    \ nature of this attack is similar to a DDoS\nattack. Attackers are used to attack\
    \ routers by sending many false requests to prevent\nlegitimate routers from forwarding\
    \ packets. This is also called a ﬁrst-come, ﬁrst-served\nattack because the attacker\
    \ can also use a malicious router or reprogram it to block packets\ninstead of\
    \ sending correct information [78]. These attacks reduce the average throughput.\n\
    When combined with a sinkhole attack, this attack affects performance and stops\
    \ all trafﬁc\naround the black hole. When combined with the sinkhole attack, this\
    \ attack severely\ndegrades trafﬁc and modiﬁes or discards content during transmission.\n\
    4.5.5. Sink Hole Attacks\nThis is a network layer attack where attackers attract\
    \ all network trafﬁc from nearby\nnodes to a compromised node and appear as attractive\
    \ and trusted nodes. This attack\nis also used to initiate other attacks such\
    \ as spooﬁng attacks, DoS, and modiﬁcation of\nrouting information in WSN [34].\
    \ When combined with selective routing and worm attacks,\nsinkhole attacks become\
    \ even more dangerous. A sinkhole attack is initiated in two ways,\neither by\
    \ hacking a node within the network or by a malicious node impersonating itself\n\
    as the shortest path to the base station [35,36]. A sinkhole attack impacts the\
    \ routing\nconﬁguration/protocols of the forwarding node. Due to this behavior,\
    \ it is considered as an\nerror or malicious node by the neighboring nodes, which\
    \ affects the network performance.\nThis leads to mis-routing and incorrect displays\
    \ of the routing protocol.\n4.5.6. Wormhole Attacks\nA wormhole attack is a network\
    \ layer attack in which an invader attacks the WSN\nthrough two or more compromised\
    \ nodes. The invaders forward the data from one\nmalicious node to another node\
    \ at the end of the network through the tunnel. The wormhole\nappears to other\
    \ nodes as a ﬁctitious neighbor. Wormhole nodes usually transmit data\ndirectly\
    \ from one node to the destination without including other nodes in the path.\
    \ Due\nto this nature, other nodes in WSN easily trust those closest to other\
    \ nodes, which causes\nmany routing problems. Moreover, they can build better\
    \ communication channels for\nlong-range communication [37]. Wormhole attacks\
    \ affect the performance of many network\nservices, such as time synchronization,\
    \ localization, and data fusion.\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n23 of 36\n4.5.7. Selective\
    \ Forwarding (Gray Hole)\nA selective forwarding attack (SFA) is a special type\
    \ of black hole attack in which\nthe compromised node drops some selective packets\
    \ instead of all packets. Invaders drop\npackets containing critical information,\
    \ such as military information, without noticing them\nor allowing others that\
    \ may contain non-critical information to pass. This can lead to worse\neffects\
    \ and a decrease in network efﬁciency [34–37]. Selective forwarding attacks impact\n\
    network performance and consume limited energy resources.\n4.6. RQ6: Issues in\
    \ WSN and IoT Frameworks\nIn this section, we mention various WSN and IoT frameworks\
    \ that highlight the\nimportance of WSN and IoT in different aspects of life.\
    \ Although many advances have\nbeen made in IoT, there are still many problems,\
    \ as shown in Figure 9, that need to be\nreduced and solved efﬁciently to avoid\
    \ any damage [79,80].\nFigure 9. Issues in WSN and IoT Framework.\n4.6.1. Security\n\
    Security is essential for any organization to protect its environment, systems,\
    \ devices\nand applications from outside attacks. Data and communication technologies\
    \ are increasing\nevery day. Therefore, data and information security are necessary\
    \ tasks [81]. In addition to\ndata, its transmission over the network should also\
    \ be protected. Although technology has\nevolved and security mechanisms have\
    \ improved, attackers have still found many ways to\nbreach the security level\
    \ [38,39]. With the increasing number of IoT devices, new security\nissues have\
    \ emerged. For real-time applications, the most important thing is to keep the\n\
    WSN secure. The network and its associated router or hub should enforce an access\
    \ control\nmechanism to prevent unauthorized users. Each node connected to another\
    \ node is security\nrelevant, whether it is a restricted device or a smart device.\
    \ Acceptance, conﬁrmation,\ncategorization, trust, and information security are\
    \ the most important security requirements\nto be considered in IoT networks and\
    \ WSN. It is challenging to provide security measures\nfor ﬂexible detection devices.\
    \ Therefore, protecting information from dictatorial forces or\nillegal access\
    \ is called security [82,83].\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n24 of 36\n4.6.2. Data Conﬁdentiality\
    \ and Privacy\nData conﬁdentiality is a signiﬁcant issue in IoT and network security.\
    \ In IoT frame-\nworks, the client gains access to the information and system\
    \ management in an unintended\nenvironment due to issues such as the use of sensor\
    \ nodes. Attackers can physically capture\nthem and extract data using an energy\
    \ analysis attack [84]. Refurbished devices made from\nthese captured devices\
    \ can launch new attacks and violate security. Therefore, the IoT\ndevice should\
    \ verify whether or not the user or device has been granted permission to\naccess\
    \ the system. The practice of controlling access to data by granting or denying\
    \ permis-\nsion based on a set of laws. Many devices/clients must be authenticated\
    \ by management\nto access the system. Data conﬁdentiality and access are the\
    \ main issues in the Internet\nof Things (IoT). Researchers are trying to ﬁgure\
    \ out how to handle the personalities of\ncustomers, items/articles, and devices\
    \ in a secure manner. Due to the ubiquitous nature\nof IoT and WSN systems, privacy\
    \ and conﬁdentiality are major concerns in IoT devices\nand frameworks. Some issues,\
    \ such as snifﬁng and spooﬁng, unauthorized access, data\nchanging, forging, and\
    \ unapproved alteration of IoT and WSN nodes, pose signiﬁcant\nuncertainties in\
    \ IoT. An attacker can use various IoT devices and applications to capture\nsensitive\
    \ and personal data that is visible to outsiders.\n4.6.3. Data Acquisition and\
    \ Transmission\nThe primary goal of IoT is to collect data and transmit it to\
    \ where it is needed in a\nnetwork. Sensors are the devices used to collect data\
    \ from the environment to transmit it to\nthe base station. After the raw data\
    \ is collected, it is sent to the Sink Hub for processing. Data\ncollection and\
    \ transmission are other problems in IoT and WSN because data is exposed\nand\
    \ modiﬁed during transmission. Data acquisition is an energy-consuming process,\
    \ so\nextra care must be taken during gathering and transmission. Intruders can\
    \ steal the data\nduring transmission if it is not encrypted or transmitted over\
    \ a secure channel. The intruder\ncan take over a node and reprogram it with a\
    \ malicious code, damaging the entire network.\nTherefore, security is required\
    \ for this process. Sometimes intruders attack the databases of\norganizations\
    \ to violate the conﬁdentiality of the data [85]. Also, the intruder may destroy\n\
    the node or collect important or unusual information that could be used against\
    \ the system.\nFor this reason, researchers present many security mechanisms.\
    \ They protect end-to-end\ncommunication links using one-time-pad (OTP) encryption\
    \ method and also identify the\nvulnerabilities in the DBMS application using\
    \ SEPTIC method.\n4.6.4. Resource Limitations\nIf necessary resources in WSN and\
    \ IoT are abandoned or not handled efﬁciently, it may\naffect the performance\
    \ of the network. The network consists of many nodes and sensors that\nrequire\
    \ energy to operate well [86]. Various MAC layer protocols have been developed\
    \ to\nreduce the energy consumption of sensors or nodes. These energy-efﬁcient\
    \ algorithms work\nprimarily by regulating the synchronization of network trafﬁc\
    \ over time and the time period\nduring which a node becomes active in a network\
    \ [87,88]. In contrast, the communication\nmedium is another basic requirement,\
    \ since nodes rely on the Internet for data transmission.\nThere is a constant\
    \ need for energy, otherwise the network will fail. The nodes have limited\nresources\
    \ because battery capacity, correspondence capacity, and computing power are low.\n\
    Again, security is the main problem, because the security measurement expenses\
    \ require\nmore resources to maintain the speed of the network, which is not affordable.\
    \ As a result of\nlow regulated security, attacks can subvert software execution\
    \ and protocols used in the\nnetwork [89,90].\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n25 of 36\n\
    4.6.5. Quality of Service\nQuality of Service (QoS) manages networks and resources\
    \ to strengthen IoT connec-\ntivity. QoS manages delay, jitter, reliability, and\
    \ bandwidth by classifying network trafﬁc.\nIt plays an important role in optimizing\
    \ systems. Quality of Service means that energy\nefﬁciency, reliability, bit error\
    \ rate, and latency should be good enough to capture data\nover a network. Therefore,\
    \ it is classiﬁed in two ways: program-speciﬁc and network-\nspeciﬁc. The QoS\
    \ perspective of the network refers to the effective management of network\nresources\
    \ and transmission performance, while the perspective of the program refers to\n\
    mobility, time synchronization, and sampling parameters. Similarly, many algorithms\
    \ have\nbeen developed to distribute heavy trafﬁc evenly, and the energy consumption\
    \ load in a\nnetwork uses a cluster-head approach to achieve high performance\
    \ and efﬁciency [91].\n4.6.6. Tampering\nSensors can be placed either indoors\
    \ or outdoors. Indoor sensors can be easily man-\naged and protected, while outdoor\
    \ sensors are more vulnerable to attackers due to remote\nlocations with poor\
    \ security, harsh climates, etc 78. The probability that these sensors will\n\
    be physically attacked is much higher; therefore, physical protection cannot be\
    \ guaranteed.\nA DoS attack manipulates the network by breaking the connection\
    \ or changing the current\nnetwork. The attacker can also replace the original\
    \ node with a fake or malicious node,\ncausing a severe attack on the network\
    \ [92]. In a Sybil attack, a malicious node penetrates\neach cluster head of the\
    \ network and affects the operation of the routing protocol. Com-\npromised nodes\
    \ can be used to launch new attacks without exposing themselves [41,93].\nThese\
    \ nodes are difﬁcult to detect and isolate, allowing an attacker to alter data\
    \ or transmit\nmalware throughout the network that causes signiﬁcant damage [94].\
    \ Constant monitoring\nof the network is necessary to ensure that WSN nodes cannot\
    \ be tampered with and that\nnetwork performance remains stable [95].\n4.6.7.\
    \ Authorization and Authentication\nNodes are the building blocks of the Internet\
    \ of Things that must be deﬁned in the\nnetwork. Transmission between devices\
    \ and access to the entire network span a wide\nrange in IoT and WSN. IoT devices\
    \ perform role-based access control, and their devices are\nallowed to do only\
    \ what is required [96,97]. Devices and their data must be protected from\nphysical\
    \ and logical attacks on the network. Attacks on the DNS cache could affect the\n\
    overall performance of the network. Authentication is the process by which each\
    \ node on\nthe network can access data based on a ﬁxed connection to a server\
    \ or cloud-based server.\nIf the authentication process is not administered properly,\
    \ it will lead to security issues\nand questions. An attacker can easily access\
    \ the network and make it fail temporarily by\nmaking too many wrong attempts.\n\
    Authentication is complicated due to the massive proliferation of wireless media\
    \ and\nthe nature of sensor networks. Authentication is usually done using the\
    \ credentials of a\nlegitimate user [98,99]. However, this technique is not secure\
    \ enough. Therefore, passwords\nshould be changed regularly and computers should\
    \ not be left unattended to make this\ntechnique robust. Both the sender and the\
    \ recipient should perform authentication to verify\nthe origin of the communication\
    \ [100,101].\n4.7. RQ7: Limitations of the Literature Review\nIn this section,\

    5. Challenges and Open Issues\nIntelligent systems can address various problems\
    \ faced by industry, but there have\nbeen some challenges in integrating IoT and\
    \ WSN into Industry 4.0. Technological improve-\nments in IoT and WSN have increased\
    \ concerns about security and data management [96].\nAs more and more data is\
    \ generated, it is difﬁcult for factories and industries to manage\nit properly.\
    \ Artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms have been implemented to manage Big Data\n\
    and make systems and devices act more intelligently. The algorithms are used to\
    \ process\nthe data in different time periods. For education, the data must be\
    \ shared in a central\nrepository, while enterprises are mainly reluctant to share\
    \ their private data due to poor\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n30 of 36\nand insufﬁcient\
    \ organizational support for data in Industry 4.0. There are also safety\nmanagement\
    \ issues in Industry 4.0 [116].\nBig data: The emergence of various technologies\
    \ and the explosion of their use have\nled to the outstanding development of Big\
    \ Data technology and processing. Every device\nproduces a huge amount of data.\
    \ Due to the growing amount of big data, the improve-\nments of Big Data packages\
    \ encounter limitations and demand situations that need to be\n“overcome” in order\
    \ to manage the amount of data used efﬁciently.\nAdapting to 6G: 6G is another\
    \ challenge for wireless sensor networks and the Internet\nof Things. Processing\
    \ power is a major challenge in developing low-power and low-cost\n6G devices.\
    \ In addition, 6G brings privacy and security challenges for WSN and IoT.\nUpdates:system\
    \ components could not be upgraded due to interoperability between\nprotocols,\
    \ systems, and their components. Therefore, systems are more vulnerable to attack\n\
    if any part of a single system from a network is infected in intelligent factories.\n\
    Environment: security is also a critical challenge in WSN [97,100,106]. WSN nodes\n\
    are not secure when deployed in a prone environment due to the wireless transmission\
    \ of\ndata. An attacker can access them from anywhere in the world and manipulate\
    \ them easily.\nInternet attacks can also affect the vulnerability of sensor nodes.\n\
    Supply chain management systems: IoT devices are spreading erery day, posing new\n\
    challenges to the integrity and scalability of supply chain management systems\
    \ [117,118].\nSimultaneously connecting IoT devices to the cloud or the Internet\
    \ requires a lot of access\ncontrol, fault tolerance, data management, privacy,\
    \ and security.\nLimited resources: are other challenges in WSN domain that affect\
    \ the energy of\nsensor nodes used in the network. Sensor nodes usually change\
    \ their mode from sleep to\nactive and vice versa. Therefore, sleep mode is considered\
    \ as \"outside the network\" while\nactive mode brings some other issues such\
    \ as energy consumption [119]. Due to the high\nenergy consumption, they also\
    \ became dead. Sensor nodes usually have limited power,\nprocessing, and memory.\
    \ In addition, sensor mobility is another problem that hinders the\nintegration\
    \ of mobile sensor nodes with the Internet.\n6. Future Directions\nIndustry 4.0\
    \ leads to the merging of people and technology to complement human\nactivities\
    \ with intelligent machines. Industry 4.0 will lead to customized human fashion\n\
    that will minimize the oversupply and unavailability of supplies or items. Human-machine\n\
    interaction will increase productivity and customer satisfaction with customized\
    \ products.\nThe next version of Industry 4.0 is Industry 5.0, which is expected\
    \ to be more user-\nfriendly and better integrate technology with society and\
    \ the environment. It depends\nmainly on robots. Robots are already the backbone\
    \ of manufacturing, and Industry 4.0\ntechnologies [120,121] provide ﬂexibility\
    \ in manufacturing. Industry 5.0 combines human\ncreativity and craftsmanship\
    \ with the speed, productivity (e.g., CPS) [122], and consistency\nof robots.\
    \ In this version, robots can be programmed to work alongside humans.\nSoft computing:\
    \ can be used to reduce the dimensions of these large dimensional\ndata sets [123].\
    \ Good features are essential to make efﬁcient decisions. This is the reason\n\
    why soft computing techniques are used to obtain useful features.\nExplainable\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence (XAI): can be used for interpretability of the deci-\n\
    sion made by the classiﬁcation model. Classiﬁcation models make decisions in a\
    \ black box\nwhere the user does not know how the decision is made. XAI converts\
    \ this black box into a\nwhite box and interprets the decision made by a model.\
    \ XAI increases user conﬁdence to\ntake further action [124].\nFederated learning\
    \ (FL): is an optimal choice for privacy preservation. FL works by\ntraining global\
    \ and local models on the edge device. The model on the edge device does\nnot\
    \ share the data with the global, thus keeping the data private at each edge device.\
    \ Only\nparameters are shared globally to retrain the global model and optimize\
    \ the inference\nresults [125,126].\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n31 of 36\nSecure\
    \ devices: sensor nodes are designed to consume less energy and become active\n\
    when they are needed or an event occurs [59]. Further improvements are also needed\
    \ to\nprevent attacks from the Internet. While the IoT has no limitations in terms\
    \ of processing\nor energy. Due to the tremendous proliferation of IoT devices,\
    \ this paradigm is now being\nshifted from the IoT to the Internet of Everything.\n\
    Sustainability: IoT systems are now moving toward the idea of self-organization,\n\
    and systems are becoming capable of responding in an automated and adaptive manner\n\
    and dealing with changes and uncertainties in the environment [118].\nEducation\
    \ 5.0: in this digital era, education must also change from traditional to\nintegrating\
    \ hardware and software with co-bots to develop new skills and a smart society.\n\
    Educational institutes are now using pedagogical tools to provide a better experience.\n\
    Even though IoT-based education is still not widespread, there is still room for\
    \ further\nimprovement, such as sensor node coverage and efﬁciency, wireless data\
    \ transmission of\ndata [127], battery life, and high-cost nodes.\nGeneral directions:\
    \ there are many challenges. Future directions may address het-\nerogeneous interoperability\
    \ of systems, self-organization protocols, routing schemes for\nmanaging IoT networks,\
    \ data management [79], cross-platform optimization, and the\ndevelopment of network\
    \ security algorithms to secure wireless transmission from data\nmanipulation,\
    \ stealing, or hacking activities. On the hardware side, researchers are de-\n\
    veloping energy-efﬁcient sensor nodes [91,115], with net-zero power to reduce\
    \ maximum\npower consumption.\n7. Conclusions\nIn this digital and modern era,\
    \ technology is evolving every day. Due to the massive\nproliferation of technology,\
    \ IoT and WSN play an important role in Industry 4.0 to develop\nsmart applications,\
    \ design networked data centers, and build autonomous smart industries.\nData\
    \ networks have been created and improved with the help of new and smart devices.\n\
    In this systematic literature review, WSN and IoT network threats were analyzed\
    \ and a\ndescriptive comparative study was conducted. These networks are the main\
    \ attack surfaces\nfor attackers to draw meaningful patterns from system and user\
    \ data. Wireless sensor\nnetworks (WSN) and the Internet of Things (IoT) have\
    \ rapidly (and widely) evolved to meet\nthe increasing demand for conventional\
    \ application scenarios, such as plant automation\nand remote process control\
    \ systems. These smart devices are also being used to improve the\nefﬁciency of\
    \ existing networks and create new opportunities for automating and securing\n\
    industrial processes. In this article, we explore seven research questions: (i)\
    \ What are the\ncontributions of WSN in IR4. 0? (ii) What are the contributions\
    \ of IoT in IR 4.0? (iii) What\nare the types of WSN coverage areas for IR 4.0?\
    \ (iv) What are the main types of network\nintrusions in WSN and IoT systems?\
    \ (v) What are the main network security attacks in\nWSN and IoT? (vi) What are\
    \ the major issues in IoT and WSN systems? (vii) What are\nthe limitations and\
    \ research gaps in the current work? The main purpose of the fourth\nindustrial\
    \ revolution with WSN and IoT explicitly shows that the evolutionary transition\n\
    needs to be intensiﬁed and extended to include emerging research areas and intimidating\n\
    technological challenges. This article covers all elements of WSN, from the design\
    \ phase\nto the security requirements, from the implementation phase to the classiﬁcation\
    \ of the\nnetwork, and from the difﬁculties and challenges of WSN. Future studies\
    \ will address\nthe problems in the coverage regions of wireless sensor networks\
    \ and provide effective\nsolutions to the existing problems and challenges in\
    \ this area. The use and application of\nWSN and IoT in Industry 4.0 involves\
    \ the processing of extracted data and the efﬁcient and\nsecure transmission of\
    \ this data to a remote location.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, M.M.,\

    Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Footnotes Abstract: The advancement
    of technologies over years has poised Internet of Things (IoT) to scoop out untapped
    information and communication technology opportunities. It is anticipated that
    IoT will handle the gigantic network of billions of devices to deliver plenty
    of smart services to the users. Undoubtedly, this will make our life more resourceful
    but at the cost of high energy consumption and carbon footprint. Consequently,
    there is a high demand for green communication to reduce energy consumption, which
    requires optimal resource availability and controlled power levels. In contrast
    to this, IoT devices are constrained in terms of resources-memory, power, and
    computation. Low power wide area (LPWA) technology is a response to the need for
    efficient utilization of power resource, as it evinces characteristics such as
    the capability to proffer low power connectivity to a huge number of devices spread
    over wide geographical areas at low cost. Various LPWA technologies, such as LoRa
    and SigFox, exist in the market, offering a proficient solution to the users.
    However, in order to abstain the need of new infrastructure (like base station)
    that is required for proprietary technologies, a new cellular-based licensed technology,
    narrowband IoT (NBIoT), is introduced by 3GPP in Rel-13. This technology presents
    a good candidature to handle LPWA market because of its characteristics like enhanced
    indoor coverage, low power consumption, latency insensitivity, and massive connection
    support towards NBIoT. This survey presents a profound view of IoT and NBIoT,
    subsuming their technical features, resource allocation, and energy-efficiency
    techniques and applications. The challenges that hinder the NBIoT path to success
    are also identified and discussed. In this paper, two novel energy-efficient techniques
    “zonal thermal pattern analysis” and energy-efficient adaptive health monitoring
    system have been proposed towards green IoT. Topic: Towards Service-Centric Internet

    I. Introduction 5G is on the purview where IoT will seize the stage spotlight,
    as IoT devices would form a notable segment of the 5G network. The radical evolution
    of the current Internet into a network of interconnected objects harvest information
    from the environment and interact with the physical world. The mammoth interest
    of connecting sensors, actuators, meters cars, appliances, and so on with internet,
    results in the Internet of Things [1], [2]. According to IEA-4E (Electronic device
    and network annex), the number of network connected devices will be 50 billion
    by 2020 [3]. Thus enterprises ushers into the modern era of automation to evidently
    change our daily lives by providing solution related to multiple sectors of health,
    agriculture, retail, vehicular, industry, power grid, underwater, buildings, homes,
    environment, transportation, smart home [4]. By 2024 itself, it is expected that
    the IoT industry will generate a revenue of USD4.3 billion [5] and it’s expected
    to grow over years. However, deployment of gigantic IoT ecosystem brings in various
    challenges to handle such as cost-efficient robust and flexible connectivity,
    interoperability of heterogeneous hardware, diverse security mechanism [6], and
    long battery life. However, the major deployment obstruction is due to constrained
    resources availability for IoT devices i.e. limited energy, limited computation,
    and limited processing capabilities [7]. Most importantly the flavor of IoT gets
    bitter, especially due to limited energy as this leads to unanticipated human
    intervention. Hence the burning issue of efficient utilization of energy is getting
    anomalous traction from academics and industry. In literature, various techniques
    have been proposed to tackle this critical issue such as energy harvesting, sporadic
    transmission, resource allocation, clustering, etc. Ju and Zhang [8] suggested
    the technique of predictive analysis with energy harvesting to obsolete the battery
    from IoT device. Na et al. [9] suggested a technique to charge the device wirelessly
    using RF. Further, a power-aware connectivity using Spanning tree algorithm is
    suggested by Karthikeya et al. [10]. Shafiee et al. [11] designed a circuit to
    manage the power of the device where a source of energy is ambient. Another crucial
    challenge is to handle the diverse requirement of wide range of IoT applications.
    Today there are two evident classes of IoT applications: Critical IoT and Massive
    IoT. Critical IoT applications such as autonomous driving or remote surgery require
    very low latency with ultra-high reliability. Massive IoT (M-IoT) applications
    like smart building, logistics, tracking and fleet management, smart agriculture,
    etc. require low cost device with reduced complexity that consumes low power,
    wide coverage including uncovered areas and performance flexibility to handle
    multiple application with different latency and throughput requirement. According
    to current statics, low data rate (<100kbps) applications i.e. M-IoT, are expected
    to form 60% of IoT connections in 2020 in comparison to medium and high data rate
    applications [12]. Hence most of the traffic will originate from cost-effective
    low-bit-rate services that will serve the connected world. Since massive communication
    between various low power IoT devices is different from H2H (Human-to-Human) in
    terms of delay sensitivity and traffic pattern, thus could not be supported by
    cellular technologies adequately. As they are designed for the different category
    of terminal that operates at a high data rate and consumes high power their device
    complexity is also high and thereby their cost, though it will aid in deployment
    of IoT. Apart from this, technologies such as Wi-Fi, BLE, ZigBee, etc., offer
    short range communications though consume less power. However, if deployed repeatedly
    will increase the cost. Hence not a cost effective solution for applications with
    wide coverage range requirements like M-IoT. Thus a technology is required that
    could support massive connection at reduced cost with low power consumption &
    provide enhanced coverage [13]. LPWAN technologies are one that could support
    this emerging market as it allows low power device to communicate at low data
    rate over wide area with radius of several kilometers. LPWA proffers abilities
    like Indoor penetration: as it uses Sub-1GHz band, the signal propagates more
    reliably with less power consumption as compared to 2.4GHz signal. Low power consumption
    is achieved at a cost of low data rate and latency on the higher end in seconds
    or minutes. This ability is achieved by using Duty cycling, by using star topology
    (usually), by allowing devices to directly connect to BS (thereby bifurcating
    the need of gateway & relays also) or by reducing burden on the device side(by
    using Fog or edge Computing). Further for Low cost, CAPEX (capital expenditure)
    & OPEX (operational expenditure) is reduced by reducing the complexity of hardware,
    implanting less no of BS (LPWA BS) etc. Massive connections, QoS are two abilities
    where still improvement is required. Standard bodies like ETSI, 3GPP, IEEE, IETF
    are actively working on LPWA technologies. A range of applications such as precision
    monitoring, Smart City, Home Automation, Industrial Asset monitoring, Logistics,
    Wildlife Monitoring, Smart meter, is being catered by LPWA technologies. As the
    LPWA market is expected to rule the market in coming years, hence competition
    among LPWA technologies becoming severe. Recently to improve the foundation of
    IoT through cellular networks, and tussle with existing proprietary LPWA technologies
    (LoRa, SigFox, RPMA, etc.), 3GPP has introduced three technologies in Rel-13 namely
    eMTC (enhanced Machine Type Communication), NB-IoT, EC-GSM (enhanced coverage
    GSM). These cellular technologies will operate in licensed spectrum and will reuse
    the existing LTE infrastructure. Among available connecting technologies, NBIoT
    specifically tailored for emerging M-IoT market is one of the promising massive
    LPWA technology for data perception and acquisition for low data rate applications.
    NBIoT could handle massive connections with low power consumption and provide
    wide area coverage with deep indoor penetration and nomadic mobility [14]–[16].
    Most outstandingly it offers reliable service by using licensed bands and avoid
    congestion problems. NB-IoT reduced the hardware complexity by 90% compared in
    comparison of LTE Cat-1. Moreover, NBIoT can coexist with existing GSM and LTE
    network, hence reduce deployment cost also. Beside this new RAT (Radio Access
    Technology) reduced the signaling required for the transmission of data in the
    conventional system. Altogether NB-IoT can reduce the cost and energy consumption,
    which are the chief limitations of cellular network technology for IoT devices.
    The present communication contributes toward the Next generation Green-NBIoT and
    delivers a comprehensive enriched study of NBIoT. This extensive survey elaborates
    resource allocation and energy efficiency techniques. Along with this a detailed
    comparative analysis of IoT connecting technology with NBIoT is also presented.
    Further, two novel application specific energy efficient approaches are also proposed
    namely “Zonal Thermal pattern Analysis” (ZTPA) and “Energy Efficiency Adaptive
    Health Monitoring System” (E2AHMS). Along with this real time hardware implementation
    of Health application is given to support the proposed energy efficient approach.
    This paper would be beneficial for researchers to get an insight view of NBIoT
    and their respective challenges. A. Market Trends Toward NBIoT IoT market growth
    has accelerated across all verticals in Q1 2018. Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN)
    is seen as one of the enablers for IoT. IoT Analytics in their report quoted that
    LPWA connections will have a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 81% during
    2018–2025 [17]. According to Machina in comparison of other LPWAN the share of
    NBIoT alone would be 48% by 2025 (Fig. 1) [18]. According to another statics,
    suggest by IHC the number of NBIoT connections by 2021 will be 141.7 million [19].
    Thereby NBIoT module revenue worldwide might touch the figure of USD 824 million
    by 2020 itself. Out of all NBIoT connections 88% of NBIoT connections will be
    established in Asia itself [20]. Some of the key NBIoT players are Huawei (China),
    Intel (U.S), Ericsson (Sweden), Deutsche Telekom (Germany), Qualcomm (U.S), Vodafone
    (U.K). The growth of NB-IoT standard has increased pressure on proprietary technologies
    especially for LoRaWan and the fact of no of chips shipped in 2017: 2% of SigFox,
    4 % of LTE-M, LoRaWan 58%, LTE-Cat M1 4%, NBIoT 29%, Other 7% [18], are forestalling
    the market drift is building toward NBIoT. FIGURE 1. LPWA technology share by
    2025, machina, 2017 [18]. Show All B. Research Motivation As per literature survey
    and research availability in the area of IoT, a lot of work has been done to deliver
    services like smart health, smart agriculture, smart vehicle, etc. In the current
    scenario, IoT has become the first choice of industry, research and academia.
    However, there exist big gap similar to WSN i.e. energy optimization, energy efficient
    network which acts as a big stumbling block for IoT network. This becomes even
    more challenging as IoT devices have limited resource availability. This motivated
    us to study resource allocation techniques in detail. Furthermore, implementation
    of IoT on a massive scale would inflate carbon emissions in one way or the other.
    Hence to envision the green communication energy efficiency techniques will play
    an important role. Apart from this to cater the new specificities of IoT (i.e.
    low cost devices, wide coverage, long battery life, massive connection support)
    in cost effective way, NBIoT (3GPP standardized LPWA technology) presents good
    candidature. In this paper with an effort toward green IoT, two energy efficiency
    techniques using NBIoT are also proposed related to two specific area Health &
    Agriculture which directly or indirectly impact the human being. C. Contribution
    This review paper contributes toward next generation green communication and in
    support of that two novel energy efficient techniques namely “ZTPA” & “E2AHMS”.
    This review paper will be beneficial for researchers, who want to get a profound
    view of NBIoT. Whilst discussing the recent background of NBIoT, significant challenges
    and open issues related to the real time implementation of NBIoT are identified
    and discussed. In this manuscript, a detailed study related to resource allocation,
    and energy efficiency techniques for both IoT and NBIoT is done. Our main contributions
    can be summarized as follow: The Layered Architecture of IoT is presented to specify
    How IoT works. In addition to this a detailed comparative analysis of NBIoT with
    other low power IoT communication technologies is discussed. To provide an insight
    view of NB-IoT, its background research, architecture, frame structure, physical
    channels, connection process (cell acquisition, random access process, data transfer),
    modes of operation, power consumption using NBIoT, and its applications are discussed
    in detail. The paucity of the resource is not a new challenge for the communication
    network. However, it quite challenging for IoT being so massively interconnected.
    Thus a detailed analysis of resource allocation techniques is discussed related
    to IoT and NBIoT The open issues related NBIoT implementation are then conferred
    The real time implementation of IoT will inflate the CO2 levels in environment
    in different ways which can be controlled by many ways one of it is efficient
    utilization of energy resource. Therefore a literature survey of an energy efficient
    techniques used for IoT are deliberated and role of deep learning in the context
    of power consumption is also discussed. The open issues relate to NBIoT are then
    conferred. Thereafter, Green communication based energy efficient techniques are
    proposed for Smart Agriculture and Smart Health. In addition to this, hardware
    implementation is given to support the proposed energy efficient Smart Health
    technique. The list of ongoing IoT projects is presented to provide the researchers
    and readers the knowledge of current applications being developed. In addition
    to this, a list of simulation tools used is also presented in the appendix section.
    D. Organization This paper is organized as follows. Section II briefly discusses
    the basic layered architecture of IoT and specifies the layer on which NBIoT operates.
    Hereafter comparison of NBIoT with other IoT connecting technologies is discussed
    in section III. Thereafter, NBIoT introduction, background research, standardization
    history from Rel-8 to Rel-15, subsequently architecture, frame structure, physical
    channels and signals used, connection process, modes of operation, power consumption
    using NBIoT, applications of NBIoT, are described in subsections IV-A, IV-B, IV-C,
    IV-D, IV-E, IV-F, IV-G, IV-H, IV-I respectively. Further section V provides a
    comprehensive survey of efficient resource allocation techniques used for NBIoT
    & IoT. Thereafter an overview of energy consumption in a sensor node during different
    phases is presented in section VI. Other than this, a detailed survey of energy
    efficiency techniques for green communication are discussed in detail in section
    VI-A and then the impact of usage of deep learning on power consumption is discussed
    in section-VI-B. Then the open issues related to NBIoT are discussed in section
    VII. Finally, the proposed green communication based energy efficient technique
    for agriculture is discussed in section VIII-A, and for health monitoring is discussed
    in VIII-B. In support of the proposed health technique a real time hardware implementation
    is described in section VIII-C subsuming system model (VIII-C-i), hardware requirement
    (VIII-C-ii), interface (VIII-C-iii), and performance analysis (VIII-C-iv). SECTION
    II. Internet of Things Communication and sensing ability has evolved gradually
    due to advancement in technology. The evolution of IoT (Fig. 2) started with RFID
    (radio frequency identification), which is the first technology to realize the
    machine to machine concept. RFID detects and ascertains the tagged entity wirelessly,
    by the data it transmits. Recently RFID is used in numerous IoT applications such
    as gestural detection [21], patient RFID tracking system [22], and smart restaurant.
    RFID could not sense the critical environment parameters, this stems in the requirement
    of sensing technologies. Hereafter, several technical fields including embedded
    computing, hardware miniaturization, Wireless networking aids in augmentation
    of real-world things capability, to sense, think, process and act, thus making
    things smart. Usually, these smart things have low computation capability thus
    clouds are used to offload the computational task which in turn reduce the energy
    consumption. Today the integration of. RFID, WSN, MCC (mobile cloud computing)
    and advancement in technology generated the umbrella term IoT. This concept is
    significantly revolutionizing the technical and business world, as it can offers
    anytime, anywhere, and anything service. The term IoT was first coined by Kevin
    Aston in 1999 also known as “cyber-physical systems (CPS)” [24]. In this paradigm,
    object/things around us are connected to the internet using Wireless technologies
    like Bluetooth, ZigBee, etc. Many definitions of IoT have been proposed in the
    literature. According to IERC, IoT is “A dynamic global infrastructure with self-configuring
    capabilities based on standard and interoperable communication protocol where
    physical and virtual things have identities, physical attributes, virtual personalities,
    and use intelligent interface and seamlessly integrated into information network”
    [25]. IoT network, comprised of billions of devices is highly heterogeneous. Its
    essence of heterogeneity can be visualized by the fact that devices from different
    vendors would run with diverse platforms even if they’re doing the same task as
    a result will generate radically different ontologies. Thus for IoT to speak a
    common language a unified standardized IoT architecture is required to ensure
    interoperability and security. Many architectural layouts have been proposed for
    IoT but no one has converged to a standardized architecture. Some of the well-known
    IoT architecture such as RAMI 4.0, IIRA, IoT- ARM, P2413, Arrowhead Framework,
    WSO2, Microsoft Azure, Internet-of-everything reference Model, Intel IoT Platform
    Reference Architecture are available. Among variously available architecture this
    paper presents a five-layer architecture (Fig. 3): comprised of Perception Layer,
    network layer, Service management Layer, Application Layer, Business layer [1].
    Perception Layer: This layer is composed of sensor/actuators. Here sensors are
    clustered according to their unique abilities such as body sensors, environmental
    sensors, vehicle parking sensors, home appliance sensors etc. Typically these
    sensors at the perception layer generate electronic signals triggered from physical
    event/condition aggregated at gateways using LAN/PAN technologies like Wi-Fi,
    Ethernet, UWB, ZigBee, BLE, Infrared, etc. FIGURE 2. Roadmap of IoT [2]. Show
    All FIGURE 3. Layered architecture of IoT [23]. Show All Network Layer: This layer
    is responsible to send the PL information to the Internet via one of the communication
    networks such as LAN (WIFI, Ethernet), WAN (3G, LTE, LTE-A, 5G) or satellite network.
    Service Management Layer (SML): On SML services are paired based on addresses
    and it also processes the data received. These services are OSS (Operational Support
    System) which include device modeling, Performance management, Data management
    (periodic/Aperiodic sensed data) etc. (e.g. Nokia OSS which help in generating
    new revenues by handling high capacity.), BSS (Billing Support System) this provide
    billing report, and Security Services. Application Layer: Here application layer
    is classified based on the availability of network, required coverage, heterogeneity,
    etc. Using protocols like MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport), CoAP (Constrained
    Application Protocol) this layer provides the requested service to the user. Business
    Layer: This layer is responsible to analyze data received from the Application
    layer by building the business model, flowcharts, graphs, etc. thereby enable
    to support decision-making processes. Thus IoT flow can be defined as first identification
    (to provide clear identification to each device), then sensing gather data from
    the physical environment), thereafter communication, then integration of service
    and finally extraction of knowledge. The new IoT specificities like low power
    and Wide Range, Low deployment and Operational Costs, Long Battery life (10mA
    RX current, 100nA sleep current), Low bitrates, are different from conventional
    networks in many aspects and brings in many challenges. Beside this massive connectivity
    will further aggravate the problem. However, a solution is appearing on the horizon:
    is 3GPP, NB-IoT which can cater these requirements in an effective manner. As
    IoT has a diverse and wide range of IoT requirement, hence one solution won’t
    fit for all. Therefore in the next section a detail comparative analysis of NBIoT
    and other IoT related technologies is discussed. SECTION III. Comparison of NBIot
    With Other IoT Connecting Technologies A myriad of IoT connectivity solutions
    is available to support a wide range of IoT application with miscellaneous requirements.
    Therefore to select an optimal technology for an application various factors such
    as power consumption, security issues, deployment cost, communication range, data
    rate, throughput, latency are required to be considered [26], [27]. A comparison
    of IoT connecting solutions on pre-specified factor is given in Table 1. Connecting
    Technologies of IoT can be coarsely classified into two categories based on their
    range i.e. short and long range. Wireless technologies such as BLE, ZigBee, Wi-Fi,
    Z-wave, WIMAX, 6LOWPAN, etc. offer short range can be used for applications like
    smart home, factory or supermarket. Whereas, LPWAN technologies such as LoRa,
    SigFox, NBIoT, EC-GSM-IOT, etc. offer long range. Other than the pre-specified
    competing technologies RPMA, Telensa, WAVIoT and Dash 7 are few other competing
    technologies contributing to IoT connectivity [28]. TABLE 1 Comparison of IoT
    Connecting Technologies Among wireless technologies, Wi-Fi uses radio waves for
    communication and operates in either 2.4GHz or 5GHz band. The existing Wi-Fi standards
    802.11 a/b/g/n/ac has constraints in both range and energy efficiency, thus can’t
    be considered apposite for applications with low power consumption requisite.
    Thus IEEE has introduced two new protocols 802.11ah and 802.11ax that can support
    thousands of devices with low power consumption. These two are considered to be
    the biggest move of IEEE towards the massive IoT market. The Wi-Fi standard 802.11ah–HaLow
    provide a range of 1km and can easily penetrate barriers/obstacles at data rate
    ranging from 150kbps to 40Mbps. The 802.11ax solution will provide four time’s
    increased capacity and data rate and improved efficiency. These new solutions
    have great potential to capture the M2M market. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is
    another Wireless standard that offers much needed characteristic required for
    most of IoT applications i.e. consumes low power, low cost, but within a short
    range. BLE allows both connectionless and connection-oriented communication. It
    fragments the data into small packets then transmit them over the radio interface.
    This enables BLE to support data services with large packets. It is used in applications
    like wearables, for locating things, etc. Further ZigBee is a simple and low cost
    Wireless option that consumes low power. It is based on IEEE 802 std. and could
    support ~ 65000 nodes/network. Its range can be extended by using repeaters in
    the mesh topology, but this will increase the deployment cost [29]. ZigBee 3.0
    is the new solution introduces, it ensures device interoperability, it is reliable
    robust and above all it is green. Z-Wave is another pioneer for short range communication,
    especially for home-automation industry. As it provides a reliable method to wirelessly
    control multiple home appliances using low-power. Z-Wave operates in the sub-gigahertz
    frequency range, around 900MHz. It can support up to approximately 232 nodes/network.
    The Frequently Listening receiver Slave (FLiRs) enable low latency communication
    by employing unique beaming technology so that device can transit from sleep to
    fully awake modes in one second. Hence suitable for short range IoT application.
    Z-Wave 700 Series, could offer a range of 300 feet, hence can connect gadgets
    placed outside the home and far off into the yard, too [30]. Despite offering
    low power consumption and low cost, Wireless technologies limits in supporting
    long distance communication. Hence offers limited mobility and deployment possibilities
    for the device. Moreover, to extend the range, repeaters are required to be deployed
    densely, thus extortionately expensive. Whereas, LPWA technologies offer mass
    deployment, long range, long battery life, and require low bandwidth. Hence LPWA
    fills a cavity in the landscape of Wireless technologies. LPWAN technologies can
    be categorized into two categories Licensed and Unlicensed. Long Range (LoRa),
    SigFox, RPMA, N-Wave and Dash 7 are unlicensed, NBIoT, EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M are licensed
    technologies [31], [32]. LoRa is developed by Semtech, to deploy its network it
    is required to get a NetID issued from LoRa Alliance. It uses an Adaptive Data
    Rate (ADR) scheme which helps in extending the battery lifetime. It is based on
    Chirp Spread Spectrum modulation technique, which sustains the same low power
    characteristics as FSK modulation yet considerably increases the communication
    range. LoRa-WAN being asynchronous let devices to remain in sleep mode for a long
    time period as desired by the application. Another advantage of LoRa is its BS
    provide wide coverage. However, as LoRa operates in unlicensed spectrum thus could
    not provide QoS and neither it could support dense network as it employs MAC based
    ALOHA protocol [33]. SigFox is another technology that operates in unlicensed
    sub 1GHz band. It operates on cloud based approach and uses ALOHA like LoRa but
    with a restriction on the maximum number of messages, a device could send. The
    prime advantage of SigFox is it doesn’t spend energy on sensing medium thus saves
    energy. SigFox requires the user to purchase subscription. In order to provide
    long range communication it uses Ultra-Narrow-band modulation and transfers each
    message 100 Hz wide with a data rate of 100/600 bps depending on the region. Ingenu
    is another LPWAN technology offers high throughput, high scalability, and use
    patented Random Phase Multiple Access scheme. RPMA helps in improving SNR by minimizing
    the overlapping between signals transmitted. It is slightly more complex as it
    uses TDMA based MAC protocol to efficiently allocate the radio resource [34].
    Another LPWAN technology WEIGHTLESS-P, uses cognitive radio and TV white-spaces,
    such that devices utilize the bands as an opportunistic user without causing interference
    to the primary user. It supports two way communication thereby acknowledges all
    transmissions, further in order to maintain QoS and to assure reliability Automatic
    retransmission request (ARQ) and Forward Error Correction (FEC) is used [36].
    Taking about existing cellular technology LTE could not provide solutions for
    M-IoT applications i.e. Low power consumption, low data rates, and wider coverage
    at low cost. Thus 3GPP proposed a licensed LTE-M / eMTC, in Rel-12 to cater the
    requirements of machine type communication which has been optimized in Rel-13.
    It leverages the existing LTE network and follows narrowband operation for reception
    and transmission and provides extended coverage. To reduce power consumption it
    used PSM (power saving mode) and edRx mode [37]. NBIoT (Narrow Band IoT), is another
    licensed technology introduced by 3GPP in Rel-13. NB-IoT in comparison to other
    technologies offer mMTC required features at low cost like (i) provide coverage
    in challenging positions like underground or basements; (ii) improved power saving
    mechanisms to enhance the battery life; (iii) network procedures are simplified
    to reduce the UE complexity. Apart from this to support small data transfer it
    has optimized CIoT User Plane and Control Plane Another technology EC-GSM is also
    proposed by 3GPP which is an extension of existing GSM technology. Suitable for
    many applications, but it overburdens the device and network [38]. Conclusion:
    For M-IoT applications, individually all LPWAN technologies are prompt in one
    way or the other for wide range solutions but picking a clear winner is critical.
    LoRa, SigFox being proprietary technology has an established market and giving
    a tough fight to 3GPP NBIoT, EC-GSM-IoT and others also. However proprietary technologies
    operate in Unauthorized/Unlicensed Spectrum that suffers from Duty Cycle constraint.
    Thus affects the transmission time and also bears high interference as spectrum
    is shared between multiple technologies. Whereas, NBIoT operate in licensed spectrum
    and can support massive connections, operates at low data rates (but better than
    LoRa), offer wide coverage with deep indoor penetration, perform well in dense
    area, consumes less power in comparison to LoRa, & SigFox, offers very good link
    budgets and good scalability, provide QoS Apart from this just require a software
    update to LTE or existing RAN infrastructure. Thus ready to immediate role out
    in the market. This is essential for reducing deployment cost and time [39], [40].
    Hence this ascertains that NBIoT has the ability to capture the IoT-LPWAN market
    specifically in comparison to other LPWAN Technologies SECTION IV. NBIoT: Narrow
    Band Internet of Things NB-IoT is the latest technology that is identified and
    standardized in a little time span, in the response of customer requirement and
    pressure to tussle with non-3GPP proprietary technologies. NBIoT can efficiently
    support the market of the M-IoT application. This an independent radio interface,
    tightly connected with LTE, which also shows up in its integration in the current
    LTE specifications [12], [13], [41], [42]. It can address the needs of mMTC (massive
    Machine Type Communication) by following features (Fig. 4): FIGURE 4. NBIoT features.
    Show All NBIoT can support massive connections (more than 52K/channel): as in
    MTC communication model user, transfer small data at low frequency and are insensitive
    to latency so multiple users can camp on one cell. Further, NBIoT supports two
    schemes multi-tone and single-tone transmission. This offers flexibility to schedule
    12 subcarriers with sub spacing of 15 kHz or 48 subcarriers with sub spacing of
    3.75 kHz with single tone scheduling. Hence eNodeB could support large no of users
    in parallel. NBIoT uses a bandwidth of 180 KHz and operates in HD-FDD: In NBIoT,
    UL/DL bandwidth is restricted to 180 kHz. Hence less complex transceiver is used.
    Further, the device operates in Half Duplex mode, thus can’t receive and transmit
    simultaneously. This further decrease device cost, as no duplexer will be required.
    NBIoT design objective is to provide prolonged battery life: For long battery
    life, power Consumption is reduced by using eDRX (extended discontinuous reception)
    and PSM (power saving modes) features. In extended discontinuous reception, the
    UE monitors the paging channel periodically. Whereas in PSM, the device remains
    in receiving state. NBIoT provides extend coverage range of 20dB as compare to
    GPRS (especially deep indoor penetration): To provide the wide coverage the transport
    block can be transmitted multiple times i.e. 128 times in UL and 2048 in DL. Hence
    improves Signal to noise-interference ratio (SINR) and enable proper decoding
    of the signal. To determine the number of repetitions for coverage extensions,
    three classes are defined CE level 0, CE level 1 and CE level 2. For each of these
    class, the number of repetitions is regulated separately. Beside this soft retransmission
    the network bandwidth is also reduced. Hence based on two features 20 dB coverage
    enhancement is achieved where ~7dB is achieved from network bandwidth reduction
    and ~13 dB from allowed repeated transmissions. NBIoT offers operating mode flexibility:
    In order to coexist with LTE and 2G, three deployment modes are available standalone,
    in-band and standalone. NBIoT doesn’t support higher modulation scheme than QPSK,
    thus keep device complexity low and thereby cost. Moreover, to keep the PAPR (peak
    to average power ratio) low in UL, π /2-BPSK, π /4- QPSK is used. NBIoT supports
    Low-Data-Rate applications, which obsolete the requirement for high-capacity flash
    memory hence reduce the chip area and thereby the cost of devices. NBIoT operates
    in Licensed Band and can provide telecommunication level of security. NBIoT achieved
    signaling optimization: In addition to existing RRC, NBIoT uses DONAS (data over
    non access stratum) and RRC (radio resource control) suspend/resume for signaling
    optimization. Where DONAS enable the user to transmit data without activating
    a user plane and support sporadic data transmissions also. The RRC suspend/resume
    is a user plane optimization procedure that introduced an efficient way to disable
    and restore the user plane. Further, NB-IoT is designed for sporadic and small
    messages transmission among the device and the network. It is presumed that the
    device can exchange small messages via one cell, therefore obsolete the requirement
    of handoffs. However, if required then it needs to first go in idle state and
    then restart the cell selection process. Besides this, it doesn’t support other
    EUTRA functions like Inter-RAT-mobility, handover, dual connectivity, CQI (Channel
    Quality Indicator) reporting. A. Background of NBIoT NBIoT is in the initial state
    of deployment, still, there is room for optimization. The miscellaneous work carried
    out in the context of NBIoT optimization is discussed in this section. Song et
    al. [43] proposed an indoor localization algorithm for NB-IoT system using Channel
    state information (CSI) fingerprinting. The proposed algorithm will estimate the
    position with less complexity by observing the similarity between two CSI values
    and then convert the similar value to a relative value. To improve estimation
    of position, triangular centroid algorithm and K nearest neighbor is used. As
    a result, the position error was reduced in comparison to existing techniques.
    Further, to enable a node, in an idle state to transmit the data. Lin et al. [44]
    proposed an efficient SDT (Smallest Data Transmission) technique to increase the
    number of the supportable device. In this eNB will broadcast the maximum SDT size
    in SIB (system information block), and also a group of SDT ids with it. Thereafter,
    UE will check the SDT value and determine whether to use this technique or not.
    If suitable then send the RA response. Successively, eNB will acknowledge by sending
    RA response comprised of uplink resource grant. UE on successful reception will
    send the PDU and starts the timer. Upon receiving the response within time, UE
    compares its id with group ids. As a result, authors found that more devices could
    be supported in comparison of conventional control plane solutions, whilst using
    limited uplink resources. However massive connection results in the high probability
    of collision thus Kim et al. [45] proposed an enhanced Access- Reservation-Protocol
    (EARP) with a partial preamble transmission mechanism. The proposed protocol although
    reduced the collision probability but at the cost of abdication of the detection
    ability. Authors found that EARP would results in effective resource utilization
    in reference to system load. When the load will be less then it will reduces the
    probability of misdetection. On the other hand, when a heavy load would be there,
    the collision probability gets reduced although the detection probability get
    deteriorates. Further Zhang et al. [46] done an analysis of interference caused
    by the NBIoT user equipment to that of LTE users. Authors considered only in-band
    and guard band for analysis and proposed an algorithm for removal of ISI or channel
    equalization. On the basis of observation, the authors stated that LTE-UE performance
    degrades due to the different sampling rate of NBIoT user. In addition to this,
    the level of interference depends upon specifically two important factors. First
    due to attenuation of power and second is due to guard band. A critical observation
    about bit error rate is made for an LTE device i.e. its BER will improve as guard-band
    bandwidth increases although for IoT devices BER remains unaffected. Liu et al.
    [47] taking the same issue of interference between NBIoT and LTE devices have
    proposed a framework based on Block Sparse Bayesian Learning (BSBL) and two algorithms
    for recovery of signals. Authors observed that by canceling the interfering NB-IoT
    signal, LTE device could operate more effectively. Further, Lin et al. [48] proposed
    a single tone design for NPRACH (narrowband physical random access channel) and
    this work was integrated into 3GPP Rel-13. To reduce the overhead due to cyclic
    prefix (CP) N-samples are repeated n times and then collectively CP corresponding
    to these samples is added, as a result, the length of CP got reduced. After this
    single carrier hopping is used where within symbols fixed hopping is used and
    among different symbol groups, pseudo-random hopping is applied. Further, the
    time of arrival (ToA) & carrier frequency offset (CFO) is jointly estimated to
    determine the midsection and false alarm. As a result, the authors observed that
    using the proposed design the probability of detection increased up to 99% and
    the probability of false-alarm reduced immensely below 0.1%. Further, Yang et
    al. [49] suggested using effective bandwidth (EB) to collectively handle all the
    components of LPWAN i.e. battery life, coverage, Tx (transmission) bandwidth,
    spectral efficiency. According to the suggested, concept if Tx bandwidth would
    be greater than EB, this would ultimately reduce the system capacity. On the other
    hand, if Tx would be less than EB, this would entail more Tx time. However, the
    journey of optimization doesn’t end here. There are various open issues that are
    still required to be addressed to envisage NBIoT success. Some of them are discussed
    in section VII. B. History of Standardization Before standardization, of NBIoT.
    It was proposed in two formats. NBIoT-OFDMA and NBIoT-M2M in 2014. Where QUALCOMM
    offered NBIoT-OFDMA & Huawei and Vodafone collectively offered NBIoT-M2M. These
    two formats were clubbed together to form NB-CIoT (NB cellular IoT), which require
    a new chipset and has no backward compatibility with previous LTE Rel (8-12).
    Further, another format NBIoT-LTE was proposed in 2015 which is fully compatible
    with existing LTE specifications. Then finally in 2016, 3GPP after agreeing on
    two proposals gave standardized technology NBIoT. This technology has evolved
    over years of improvement. In this section, the roadmap of standardization (from
    Rel-8 to 15) is discussed to determine the improvement made (in these Rel) to
    support MTC. Well standardization of LTE started in 2005 when 3GPP started depth
    research for MTC on CN. In 2009, Rel-8 was standardization [50] and brought in
    the feature like peak DL data rate of 300Mbps with an ability to operate in paired
    and unpaired frequency band. Thus have spectral flexibility with bandwidth ranging
    from 1.4 to 20 MHz A new IP based network was introduced i.e. LTE, was a significant
    step toward the IMT-A. In addition to this, to cater the need of multiple users,
    multiple antenna scenario came in to picture since the first Rel of 3GPP [51].
    However the basic requirement of low cost device and power issues left unattended.
    Thereafter Rel-9 standardized in 2010 in which LTE evolved to LTE-Advance and
    introduced additional features such as public warning system (PWS), location Identification
    service, SON (Self Organizing Network) feature to improve the network configuration,
    added new spectrum bands. Further in 2011 Rel-10 (also known as LTE-Advanced)
    was launched to extensively improve the throughput of the LTE system. For evaluation
    of Rel-10, it was submitted to ITU-R in 2010. In Rel-10, to enhance the bandwidth
    and bitrate, Carrier Aggregation was used for both TDD & FDD [52] and to reduce
    the interference, eICIC (enhanced Inter-Cell Interference Coordination) was added,
    where ABS (Almost Blank Subframes) is used to confine the data to the specific
    layer of the cell. Other features like eMIMO, etc. were also introduced. Further,
    Rel-11 [53] got frozen in 2013. An important feature CoMP (Co-ordinated Multi
    Point operation) was announced to facilitate the scheduling of multiple carriers.
    EPDCCH (Enhanced Physical Downlink Control Channel) was added to increase DLC
    (downlink-Capacity). Furthermore, Rel-12 [54], [55] got standardized in 2015.
    In this NAICS (Network Assisted Interference Cancellation and Suppression) was
    added to manage interference. To achieve QoE, naïve UE categories were introduced
    with 50% reduced cost in comparison to Rel-8, cat-1 devices. In support of machine
    type communication, PSM (power saving mode) was also introduced to conserve energy.
    Finally in Rel 13 [56], [57] to further cater the need of Machine to machine type
    communication, a new feature added to existing Rel-8-12: SCPTM (single cell point
    to multi-point), indoor-positioning, reduced latency, Dual connectivity and enhanced
    CA. LAA (licensed assisted access) was also introduced to allow operators to offload
    traffic to the femtocell, devoid of WLAN Two naïve category of devices were introduced
    in Rel 13 Cat-M1 (eMTC) and Cat-NB1 (NBIoT). Where the system bandwidth was confined
    to 1.4 MHz and coverage range was enhanced by 15 dB for Cat-M1 devices. Altogether
    reduced the device complexity and cost enabled operators to reach terminal devices
    in poor coverage range like in basements. For assurance of long battery life eDRX
    (extended Discontinuous Reception) feature was introduced that monitors the DL
    signals for only a short span of time otherwise keep the device in the sleep state.
    For the further evolution of LTE to support mMTC Rel-14 is also standardized with
    more technologies and improvement in existing features such as Additional Broadcast
    services, enhanced positioning, reduced latency, and massive multi antenna system.
    Currently, Rel-15 is under standardization process and expected to get standardize
    by September 2018 [56]. The expected features of Rel-15 are also enlisted in Table
    2. TABLE 2 Standardization History Toward NBIoT [12] C. NBIoT Network Architecture
    The architecture of NBIoT is shown in Fig. 5, NBIoT has simplified the EPC architecture
    to support the small data transmissions required for M-IoT applications in the
    form of User Plane and the Control Plane EPC optimization. FIGURE 5. NBIoT architecture
    [58]. Show All Here NB-IoT device or user equipment communicates with the eNodeB
    thereafter eNodeB connects with the IoT evolved packet core (EPC). This is comprised
    of entities: the Serving GW, the Packet Data Network GW, the Mobility management
    plane entity, the Home Subscriber server. After this eNodeB transfers the NAS
    (non-access stratum, a signaling message) to EPC using s1-lite (an optimized version
    of S1-Control-Plane and support efficient data handling). Basically, NAS is a
    protocol that transfers the non-radio signal between the user equipment and MME,
    which carries data for session and mobility management. Further to continue the
    processing EPC looks for stratum and then pass it to IoT platform. IoT platform
    forwards the data to application servers in supported form. This data is then
    processed by the Application server [58]. There are two ways in which data could
    be transmitted between NBIoT device and application server i.e. IP based and Non-IP
    based. However, Non-IP based is more endorsed since it reduces the overhead of
    user equipment and transmission is also more secure as only one target IP is supported.
    D. NBIoT Frame Structure Downlink: The frame structure of NBIoT DL is identical
    to LTE. In Time domain a radio frame is comprised of 10 Subframes, each having
    length of 1ms and each subframe consists of 2 slots with a time slot of seven
    OFDM symbols (Fig. 6 A) Here each OFDM symbol with in a frame is denoted by a
    number in the range 0 to 13. Further, the number of these radio frames is referred
    as the system frame number (SFN) which ranges from 0 to 1023. Once the SFN counter
    reaches the value of 1023, the counter is reset to 0 and thereafter the hyper
    SFN counter is increased. The hyper SFN ranges between 0 and 1023. Within each
    radio frame, the sub frames are labeled as 0 to 9 and the slots as 0 to 19. In
    Frequency domain, one physical resource block consists of 12 consecutive subcarriers
    with a spacing of 15 kHz [40]. FIGURE 6. Frame structure of NBIoT [59]. Show All
    Uplink: The UL resource grid has two subcarrier spacing options i.e.15 kHz and
    3.75 kHz. In time domain: with a subcarrier spacing of 15 kHz each slot has a
    duration of.5ms, the number of subcarriers will be 12 which is similar to the
    time domain. However, for the 3.75 kHz subcarrier spacing, total number of subcarriers
    in the frequency domain is 4 times i.e. 12*4=48 subcarriers. The slot duration
    will be of 2ms [40]. E. Physical Channels and Signals 1) Uplink Channels and Signals
    Since NBIoT enabled UE’s operates in extreme coverage areas and have limited power
    to operate. Pertaining to this, to reduce the power consumption and complexity
    UE is no longer asked to report a channel, thus their functionality reduced to
    send acknowledgment and No- acknowledgment. Apart from this the need of control
    channel is also obsoleted and only two UL channels are supported namely NPRACH,
    NPUSCH. a: NPRACH: Narrowband Physical Random-Access Channel NPRACH refers to
    the time frequency resource which occupies contiguous set of subcarriers either
    12, 24, 36 or 48 and used to transmit random access preambles. This preamble consist
    of four symbol groups, each group comprised of one Cycle Prefix (CP) and 5 symbols
    [48]. These preambles are repeated with a periodicity from 0.04 s to 2.56 s. The
    eNB uses the random access preamble sent by a user terminal to estimate the uplink
    timing. To start the random access process the preamble is transmitted with a
    duration of 5.6ms or 6.4ms. Further in order to support different cell size two
    CP lengths are specified in NPRACH, 66.67 μs and 266.7 μs . Where 66.67 μs is
    used for cells with radii not more than 8 km and 266.7 μs is used for cell with
    radii range of 8 – 35 km. Each symbol is modulated on a 3.75 kHz tone, which hops
    from one tone to another within twelve contiguous subcarriers. Further for efficient
    estimation of TOA (Time of Arrival) and to achieve improved synchronization between
    UE and eNB, frequency hopping is used. For this two layer hopping pattern is defined
    i.e. inner hopping & output hopping. In order to provide wide TOA range, inner
    hopping is used with fixed (for simplicity) and small values. However, an output
    hopping layer accounts to improve the accuracy of TOA estimation. Furthermore
    to alleviate cell interference between neighboring cells, the pseudo random hopping
    pattern is also used which has been inherited from the LTE PUSCH hopping. Finally
    to support coverage extension of +20dB GPRS, the preamble of four symbol groups
    can be repeated up to 128 times [59]. b: NPUSCH: Narrowband Physical Uplink Shared
    Channel The NPUSCH supports single tone transmission with either 3.75 kHz or 15
    kHz and multitone bandwidth using 15 kHz subcarrier spacing. The NPUSCH has two
    formats. Format 1 carries the actual data in the uplink with maximum transmission
    block size of 1000 bits. Format1 facilitate multitone transmission with 3,6,12
    tones. Other than this to decrease the PAPR (Peak to Average Power ratio the modulation
    scheme π /2-BPSK or π /4-QPSK is used for single-tone and QPSK is used for multi-tone
    for NPUSCH Format 1. Furthermore, Format 2 carries control information, supports
    single-tone transmission only and carries 1-bit UCI that corresponds to hybrid
    automatic repeat request (HARQ) feedback for NB-PDSCH transmission block. Table
    3 describes the format 1 and format 2. Typically the NPUSCH is designed to provide
    long battery life, massive capacity and extended coverage [14], [59]. TABLE 3
    NPUSCH Format [59] c: DMRS: Demodulation Reference Signal In LTE, DMRS is used
    to obtain channel response for PUSCH. Similar to enable eNB to estimate the UL
    channel, the NBIoT-UE transmits a demodulation reference signal (DMRS) which is
    multiplexed with the NPUSCH symbols. Thereby depending on Format of NPUSCH (ie.
    Format 1or Format 2), (Fig. 7) 1or 3 symbols per SC-FDMA slot are utilized to
    transmit the DMRS. With 15 kHz subcarrier spacing DMRS is allocated to symbol
    #3 of every 7 symbols and for 3.75 kHz subcarrier spacing. DMRS is allocated to
    5th symbol of every 7 symbols for data transmission [40]. FIGURE 7. DMRS allocation
    in 15 kHz &3.75 kHz subcarrier spacing [60]. Show All 2) Downlink Channels and
    Signals The NBIoT physical downlink channels are QPSK modulated. The downlink
    designs of NB-IoT MAC and PHY are analogous to the LTE. However, NB-IoT has fewer
    downlink physical channels as compared to LTE. For example, NBIoT doesn’t use
    PMCH (Physical Multicast Channel) as it doesn’t support multimedia broadcast/multicast
    services (till Rel-13) [61], [62]. a: DL Synchronization Signals The downlink
    synchronization signals allow a device to synchronize to NBIoT cell. However,
    the detection of these signals is a challenging task. As when a device with low-power
    oscillator wakes up after a long period of deep sleep, the time base will not
    have a valid reference then, and the frequency base perhaps off by as ~20 ppm.
    Hence a large offset may exist between the device and the network time and frequency,
    which will seriously harm the acquisition performance. The frequency offset is
    due to factors such as temperature, crystal aging, etc. Out of all “temperature”
    is the crucial factor that majorly affects the accuracy, and hence required to
    be compensated in real time. Depending on the quality of the crystal the offset
    ranges from ±5 ppm to ±100 ppm [63], [64]. Hence to detect with large frequency
    offset NBIoT new Synchronization signals NPSS (Narrowband Primary Synchronization
    Signal) is designed which is transmitted in Subframe 5 of duration 1 ms with a
    sequence pattern periodicity of 10 ms and subcarrier spaced at 15 kHz. The hierarchical
    sequence of NPSS is generated using (1) [65] P k (l)=Q(k) e −jπul(l+1)/ 11 , (1)
    View Source Where Q(k)= {1, 1, 1, 1,−1,−1, 1, 1,−1, 1} is the modulation sequence,
    1≤l≤11 (length), 3≤k≤14 (OFDM symbols) and u=5 is the root sequence. Its detection
    is a demanding computational operation from UE perspective. This detection may
    account for at least 24% of the power consumption. However, to keep the device
    complexity low, devices are required to search for only one NPSS as all the cells
    use the same NPSS in NB-IoT network. In contrast to this LTE network uses three
    PSSs. Although, in order to get one copy of NPSS, 19,200 samples need to be captured
    with a sub-frame of the length of 10 ms, with 1.92 MHz sampling rate. Hereafter
    to ascertain the cell identity out of 504 cell-ids available and to acquire additional
    information about the frame structure NSSS (Narrowband Secondary Synchronization
    Signal) is used. It is transmitted in subframe 9 with a subframe periodicity of
    20ms. Hence NSSS sequences are transmitted four times in 80-ms repetition interval
    are differentiated by the phase shift. It uses the last 11 OFDM symbols that consist
    of 132 resource elements overall. Unlike legacy LTE, cell ID is enclosed in the
    secondary sequence without including the primary sequence. NSSS, ZC 131 (Zadoff-Chu
    sequence) is constructed to indicate cell-ids [65] R(m)= b q (n) e −j2π θ f m
    e −j π μm ′ ( m ′ +1) 131 (2) View Source Where AbbreviationExpansion m = 0,1,…..,131

    shift, here n f is SFN, b q , binary scrambling sequence of 128-bits which is
    obtained based on length-128 WalsheHadamard. Hereafter NSSS is mapped to in radio
    frames having n f mod2=0 . b: Physical Channels i) NBPBCH: Narrow-Band Physical
    Broadcast Channel NB-PBCH reside in subframe 0 in every radio frame and carries
    the MIB (Master Information Block). It provide information about system bandwidth,
    SFN (system Frame Number), No of antenna ports. NB-PBCH, MIB consists of 8 independently
    decodable blocks of each of 80 ms duration. Where each block is repeated 8 times
    consecutively to manage with extreme coverage conditions. Hence MIB remains unchanged
    for the time span of 640 ms (Fig. 9). The NB-IOT determines the number of cell
    antenna ports whilst demodulating MIB information. Other than this MIB also provide
    information about operation mode. NB-PBCH reuses the functionalities from legacy
    LTE PBCH such as CRC generation and attachment, Tail biting convolutional encoding,
    Rate matching, Scrambling, Modulation, Layer mapping. FIGURE 8. NPSS & NSSS subframe
    [61]. Show All FIGURE 9. Mapping of NBPBCH [59]. Show All ii) NPDCCH: Narrowband
    Physical Downlink Control Channel The NPDCCH is used to carry DCI (Downlink Control
    Information). Basically, a device needs to monitor NPDCCH to obtain three types
    of information mentioned below. NBIoT has own control channel different from LTE-MTC
    system, although some features have been inherited. Typically NPDCCH is apt for
    transporting scheduling information. Moreover, as NBIoT supports only HDD mode
    thus transmission of NPDCCH is packet based [63]. Besides this to keep the power
    consumption low on UE side, the payload size of DCI (downlink control information)
    is kept up to 23 bits for UL grant or DL assignment for NPDCCH. Hence three new
    DCI formats have been defined as Format N0, Format N1, and Format N2. The usage
    of these formats is specified in Table 4. Further, NPDCCH consists of Narrowband
    control channel elements (NCCEs) where resource elements are mapped. A subframe
    has two NCCEs, analogous to the upper six and lower six subcarriers and for NCCE
    mapping (Fig. 10). TABLE 4 DCI Formats [14], [61] FIGURE 10. NPDCCH subframe structure
    [62]. Show All iii) Narrowband Physical Downlink Shared Channel (NPDSCH) The NPDSCH
    is the core data bearing channel used for transmission of unicast data, broadcast
    information such as SI (System Information) messages. It segments the data packet
    received from higher layer into transmission blocks and transmits one at a time.
    The resource mapping is done in an almost similar manner as NPDCCH beside two
    differences. One, that NPDSCH carry only one TB (maximum TB size is limited to
    680 bits) though NPDCCH can multiplex resources in a subframe to transmit two
    DCI messages. Secondly, if the subframe transmits the SIB1-NB then starting OFDM
    symbol in an NPDCCH subframe will be different from NPDSCH subframe in the in-band
    mode. The NPDSCH TB is processed as follows. Firstly, the CRC of 24-bit is evaluated
    and then attached to the TB. Then TB is encoded via the tail biting convolutional
    coding encoder and rate-matched owing to code-word length deduced collectively
    from the number of NPDSCH sub-frames assigned to the TB and on the basis of the
    number of REs per subframe. Accordingly, the coding rate is determined by size
    of TB and the number of NPDSCH Subframes allotted to the TB combination. Henceforward
    before mapping the encoded TB bits to QPSK symbols, the bits are scrambled i.e.
    the subframe is repeated min (NREP, 4) times before the mapping of the code word
    continues. For each repetition, the scrambling code differs. The maximum no of
    repetitions allowed are 2048 to achieve the SNR of −12.6dB. The repeated Subframes
    allow a device to decode the code word before the transmission completes [64].
    F. NBIoT Connection Process 1) Cell Selection Process A device can be in idle
    or connected mode while looking for the cell to camp on. If the device wakes up
    from a deep sleep then it obtains the information about most recently used (MRU)
    cells using cell selection protocols. In case none of the cell is found suitable
    or if device is powered on for the first time, it is required to perform a full
    frequency scan to find a new cell to camp on. The fundamental purpose of cell
    selection is to identify and synchronize to a suitable NB-IoT cell. In this context,
    the first foremost step is to time synchronize and then obtain a CFO estimated
    value. In order to achieve NPSS synchronization, its autocorrelation properties
    must be exploited. Hence when device achieves the time synchronization, then using
    next frames it determines the CFO. For device located in extreme coverage conditions,
    large number of NPSS frames are required to be detected. Once the symbol time
    is determined and the CFO is compensated for in-band or guard-band, still, an
    additional raster offset will exist up to 7.5 kHz. Consequently, this raster offset
    drifts the symbol time either in the forward or backward direction due to overcompensation
    or under compensation of the carrier frequency respectively. As a result, there
    is severe degradation in the performance of NPBCH detection, which may introduce
    latency greater than the length of CP (Cyclic Prefix) and subsequently leading
    to loss of orthogonality of OFDM symbol lost in the downlink. Hence to improve
    the detection performance device complexity must be increased so that it may do
    hypothesis testing of set of raster offset. Once the NPSS synchronization is achieved
    the device has the knowledge of subframe #9, however, a device has information,
    whether the radio frame is odd or even numbered. As NBIoT has 504 Cell-ids, thus
    NSSS detection algorithm will form 4032 hypothesis in total. Thereafter correlating
    the received signal corresponding to each hypothesis with NSSS waveform allow
    a device to detect the Cell-id. Hereafter device has Cell-id and also has information
    about the placement of NRS. Now the NBPCH is demodulated to obtain MIB-NB for
    this the device needs to form eight hypotheses hence also referred as blind decoding.
    The MIB-NB contains 34 bits and is transmitted over 64 radio frames. The foremost
    information acquired from MIB are a) Operation mode indicated by 7 bits i.e. stand-alone,
    in-band, guard-band. b) Information about SIB1 scheduling indicated by 4 bits.
    c) SI value tag indicated by 5 bits d) Access barring (AB) information enabled
    or not is indicated by 1 bit. e) System Timing: 4 MSBs of the SFN and 2 LSBs of
    the H-SFN. f) 11 spare bits used for future extensions. In addition to this, the
    transport block size and the number of repetitions is also indicated in the MIB.
    Hence acquiring the MIB-NB, a device can locate and decode SIB1-NB. An SIB1-NB
    carries 8 MSBs of the H-SFN, tracking area, a 28-bit long cell-id, and scheduling
    information regarding other SIB to unambiguously ascertain a cell within a PLMN.
    The SIB1-NB transmitted in subframe #4 of every other frame in 16 continuous frames.
    Beside this, it is transmitted at a fixed schedule with a periodicity of 2560
    ms (256 Radio Frames). To determine the first frame for transmission of SIB1,
    cell-id is used. Hereafter acquiring SIB1-NB, the device achieves the complete
    synchronization. If any change occurs it will be indicated either by paging or
    by changing the tag values. In a manner, the device has accomplished time and
    frequency synchronization with errors that will not significantly degrade the
    performance in successive transmissions and receptions during connected or idle
    mode operations [65], [66]. Fig. 11 (a) describes the cell acquisition process.
    FIGURE 11. (a) Cell acquisition process [66]. (b) Random access procedure [69].
    (c) Connection Establishment [70]. (d) Data transmission [73]. Show All 2) Random
    Access Procedure Random Access procedure is initiated by the MAC layer itself
    or by its sublayer RRC. Before initialization of this process, UE has information
    about the available set of PRACH resources. The principles to select PRACH resource
    is based on received signal received power (RSRP) measurement that specify the
    enhanced coverage level supported by the Serving Cell. A device uses two threshold
    values supported by serving cell to determine the NPRACH configuration. Besides
    this, the RSRP thresholds are used by the network to analyze the maximum coupling
    loss corresponding to different coverage levels. In NBIoT the eNB can support
    max 3 number of NPRACH repetitions out of {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64}. Hereafter
    acquiring the CE level information UE instructs the physical layer to transmit
    a preamble while specifying the number of repetitions required for transmission
    per preamble, preamble index and preamble received target power. For CE level
    0, the preamble received target power (PRTP) is set to PRTP-10 * log10 (number-of-Repetition-Per-Preamble-Attempt)
    whereas for other CE levels PRTP is set to the UE maximum output power [67], [68].
    In NPRACH, RA preamble is transmitted to determine the transmission time of the
    device to eNodeB. On each symbol group of RA preamble frequency hopping is applied
    so that individual group is transmitted on a different subcarrier. Hereafter transmitting
    the preamble, RA-RNTI (Random Access-Radio Network Temporary Identifier) is computed
    using RA-RNTI = 1+floor (SFN_id/4), here SFN_id is the index of the first radio
    frame, then it looks for RAR (Random Access Response) message indicated in DCI
    format N1 scrambled with RA-RNTI transmitted in PDCCH. Nevertheless, if RAR (random
    Access Response) is not received then UE retransmits the preamble. As stated above
    number of retransmissions depend on CE level. However, if the number of attempt
    saturates an associated failure is reported to RRC. Now eNB on receiving the preamble
    sequence transmits the RAR message also referred as Msg 2, to UE which provide
    information about TA (Timing Advance), scheduling information about radio resource
    that device can use to transmit the request for connection, C-RNTI (Cell radius
    Network Temporary identification) as shown in Fig. 11 (b) [69] Now UE transmits
    Msg 3 to eNB on NPUSCH including its identity, C-RNTI MAC CE, submitted from the
    upper layer and start the contention resolution process. In addition to this data,
    the volume parameter is sent to indicate the amount of data present in UE buffer.
    All together will facilitate the BS to take power allocation and scheduling decision
    for subsequent UL transmission. 3) Connection Establishment UE indicates that
    it wants to connect to the network by sending RRC-Connection-Request. In addition
    to the establishment cause, the UE also indicates its capability to support multi-tone
    traffic and multi carrier support. The eNB on receiving connection request, send
    RRC-Connection-Setup message Thereafter UE acknowledges by sending the Connection-setup-
    -complete message and send NAS attach request. The PDN-CONNECTIVITY-REQUEST message
    is piggy-backed in NAS ATTACH REQUEST [70], [71]. The PDN connection is novel
    capability introduced in 3GPP Rel-13 that allow UE to remain attached without
    PDN connection that support CIoT optimization. In this UE is not required to establish
    a PDN connection as part of attach procedure. Moreover UE and MME can release
    the connection without releasing EPS connection. Hence enables large number of
    devices to keep their connection inactive for long duration and seldom transmit
    data over it [72]. Hereafter the EPS authentication process is initiated. After
    that to activate the default EPS bearer CONTEXT REQUEST message is piggybacked
    in NAS: ATTACH ACCEPT. The follow of above discussed steps are discussed in Fig.
    11(c). 4) Small Data Transfer In Rel-13, 3GPP added an ability to send data over
    control Plane. As NBIoT require to transmit the small data sporadically, hence
    to send it in optimized way CIoT EPS optimizations are used which include Control
    Plane and User Plane optimization. In Control Plane optimization, UE sends the
    data packets encapsulated in NAS (Non Access Stratum) to convey non radio signal
    to MME for a service request. In NAS message RAI (Release Assistance Information)
    field indicate the MME that any further UL/DL transmissions are expected. In case
    no further transmission is expected than MME immediately triggers the S1 Release
    procedure. Hence enable MME to reduce the device DRX waiting period during which
    it waits for additional transmission. Besides this, if the size of the data transferred
    via Control Plane exceeds then UE/MME triggers the establishment of User Plane
    bearer between eNB and SGW. User Plane CIoT EPS optimization is an alternative
    procedure which is suitable for short as well as large data transaction. However,
    it requires first to establish RRC connection and create Access Stratum and radio
    bearer between the network and UE. Once the RRC connection is established two
    control procedures Connection suspend and Resume are used [74] G. Modes of Operation
    of NBIoT NBIoT carrier can be deployed in three modes standalone, in-band, and
    guard band. Standalone Operation: In this mode, a separate spectrum is either
    reserved for radio access technology like GSM/UMTS or a dedicated spectrum is
    used for deployment of NBIoT carrier. However, this will escalate the implementation
    cost as software and hardware upgradation will be required for spectrum reframing.
    In Band Operation: In this mode NBIoT carrier is deployed within LTE carrier.
    Sharing of resource block would definitely result in the more efficient use of
    spectrum which in turn will increase the capacity. The LTE bands not utilized
    to carry system information block −1 are used for inband deployment of NBIoT.
    In single tone transmission mode in uplink, there will be interference between
    NB-IoT and LTE (3.75 kHz subcarrier spacing). Although this interference could
    be minimized by scheduling users with similar SNR requirements in NB-IoT and nearby
    LTE PRBs. It’s also a cost effective way as no hardware modifications are required.
    In Guard Band Operation: In this mode NBIoT carrier will be located within guard
    band of LTE carrier to avoid interference. This mode delivers better downlink
    throughput in comparison to in band as more downlink resource is available [75].
    NB-IoT deployment modes offer high flexibility as carrier deployed in one mode
    can continue working via either of the other modes if spectrum migrates to LTE.
    Fig. 12 describes the scenario of different modes. FIGURE 12. Modes of operation
    of NBIoT [75]. Show All H. Low Power Consumption Using NBIoT Saving power of the
    battery powered device is a crucial factor for the realization of LPWAN applications.
    Two main features Power saving mode (introduced in Rel-12) and Extended Discontinuous
    reception RX (introduced in Rel-13) are used to extend the battery life of device
    up to ten or more years (Fig. 13(A) shows the PSM and Fig. 13(B) eDRX mode) [76].
    FIGURE 13. PSM and eDRX modes to save power, [Source: https://www.rohde-schwarz.comRohde&Schwarz].
    Show All A device in PSM goes into deep sleep mode and could not receive any signal.
    Although whilst this mode device can’t be reached but remain registered with the
    network. Thereby PSM eradicates the need for re-establishment of a connection
    when the device wakes up. Hence will not only result in saving power but also
    help in avoiding network congestion (due to different wake-up time). Thus it is
    suitable for application that requires sporadic transmission (e.g. Once a day).
    A device can switch to PSM, proposing two timers T3324 (active timer) and T3412
    (extended timer) and it is attached to TAU. (The maximum time a device could remain
    in the active state is 186 minutes (~T3324) & max sleeping time for a device would
    be 413 days defined by T3412.) However, it’s up to the network to accept the proposed
    timer values or not. Despite this, there is one challenge of using PSM is non
    reachability of device for a long period that needs to be taken care of by opting
    an optimal value to get a good balance between responsiveness and time for the
    device to stay in PSM. Another main feature is eDRX to save power, this in comparison
    to PSM supports DL accessibility significantly. eDRX reduces the periodicity of
    a device to switch in receiving mode and extends the sleep cycle more in idle
    mode than in connected mode. Currently, in LTE, DRX can extend up to 10.24 s whereas
    using eDRX it can be extended for minutes and hours. Thus for synchronization
    between network and device a new clock H-SFN (Hyper System Frame Number) is used.
    A power saving of 43% can be achieved using eDRX with small paging transmission
    window. As power consumption after PTW during deep sleep mode would be extremely
    low. Hence longer the eDRX more would be power saving. In addition to this other
    feature like reduced complexity and reduced overhead of channel measurement also
    reduce the power consumption, hence extends battery life [77]. I. Applications
    of NBIoT The cost effectiveness of NBIoT-network (due to the implementation of
    new software on an existing LTE infrastructure) has inspired several market analyst
    organizations to predict the revenue in the future. NBIoT being a promising technology,
    could support a wide range of applications with increased efficiency. Some of
    the important applications sectors of NBIoT with notable market perspective are
    utility-meter, industry automation, smart logistics, smart cities, waste management,
    environmental monitoring, agriculture and in personal sector like wearables, pet
    tracking, kids monitoring, white goods monitoring (Fig. 14) which provide convenience
    to remotely access of water, gas, electricity, and heat readings even when they
    are located in weak coverage areas like basements. Currently, a Germany based
    company, ista-International GmBH in collaboration with Deutsche Telekom is proving
    a solution for smart buildings by providing smart utility services using NBIoT
    [26]. Other companies such as Eco Mobile from Zagreb, Croatia in collaboration
    with Deutsche Telekom are providing IoT solutions for waste management using NBIoT.
    Here the sensors are used to measure the level of the trash bin and thereafter
    the sensed data using NBIoT sent to cloud, to determine the optimal route. Hence
    reduce logistic cost. Another important application of NBIoT is smart parking.
    Here occupancy [55]. Prime use case/application of NBIoT is utility meters information
    is collected and hence provide the availability of parking space throughout the
    city. Hamburg will be first to offer using this service of IoT using NBIoT. Huawei
    with China Unicom collaboratively launched smart parking in China also in 2017.
    Apart from this NBIoT can also monitor the environment effectively [16]. For example,
    XMM7115, FIGURE 14. Applications of NBIoT. Show All NBIoT-intel chip is used for
    environmental monitoring. Currently, in Greece Patras, NBIoT based monitoring
    service is being offered by Deutsche Telekom to effectively measure environment
    pollution, noise and air quality to take necessary actions. Automation and digitization
    is the need of the hour and list of possible application are endless. The technical
    view of current IoT applications related to four particular sectors Health monitoring,
    Social monitoring, Agriculture monitoring and defense that are ruling the market
    are given in Table 5. TABLE 5 Different Applications of IoT SECTION V. Efficient
    Resource Allocation Techniques Due to massive connections, IoT system will be
    extremely dense thus the use of efficient resource allocation techniques is of
    vital importance. As incompetent resource allocation will drastically degrade
    the performance of IoT systems. Moreover, there are miscellaneous factors that
    further aids in increasing the complicacy of efficient resource allocation such
    as limited network bandwidth, limited device computation power, diverse user requirement,
    heterogeneous device configurations. Broadly these resource allocation techniques
    can be classified into the following categories: Power allocation, Spectrum allocation,
    Computing & Storage resources allocation in the cloud and Scheduling based (Fig.
    15). Other than this all techniques that assure the reduction in latency and packet
    error are categorized under QoS resource allocation techniques. As per now, few
    resource allocation schemes (RAS) have been proposed for NBIoT system. Immense
    research is required to be carried out for the practical implication of NBIoT
    as the IoT devices have limited resources. In this section, a review of resource
    allocation schemes for NBIoT and IoT system is presented. FIGURE 15. Resource
    allocation in IoT [107]. Show All A. NBIoT Resource Allocation Techniques Yu et
    al. [108] proposed a UL link adaptation scheme with consideration of repletion
    factor to address two important aspects of throughput and reliability. This scheme
    worked in two loops inner and outer. The inner one modifies the repletion factor
    to improve block error ratio whereas outer concentrate on the selection of modulation
    and coding scheme level In addition to this outer loop also decides the repetition
    factor accounting acknowledgment or no acknowledgment packets. As a result, the
    authors observed that the proposed technique can save 46% more resource allocation
    and active time in comparison of straightforward techniques. However, they have
    not considered the effect of inter-channel interference during evaluation. In
    order to handle massive connection effectively in NBIoT multi PRB design is used.
    Where most of UE’s use Anchor-PRB (that satisfy the channel raster condition)
    to get paging and system information block. This leads to overloading of anchor-PRB.
    Hence the overloading of narrowband resource leads to underutilization of resources
    and increase power consumption. To overcome this issue Liu et al. [109] suggested
    a resource allocation technique to balance the paging load by using non-Anchor
    PRB. In the proposed technique existing user will use the Anchor PRB and the new
    NBIoT user will make use of non-Anchor PRB for paging in idle mode. As a result,
    it was observed that resource utilization improved by 30% and power consumption
    was reduced by 80%. Malik et al. [110] proposed an interference aware RAS that
    accounts for the repetition number & time offset. The linear modulation scheme
    is used in NBIoT (QPSK), therefore spectral efficiency is low. Firstly they evaluated
    the max attainable data rate for downlink is 89.2 kbps and 92kbps for uplink (theoretically).
    In addition to this, the authors analyzed the performance of cooperative scheme
    in comparison of non-cooperative and optimal scheme. They found that cooperative
    scheme can reduce the energy consumption by 17% and can improve the data rate
    up to 8%. B. IoT Based Resource Allocation Techniques Liu and Ansari [111] proposed
    a green approach by developing an overlay based architecture that uses relay BS
    powered by solar energy. These relay BS stores the harvested energy in two batteries
    and each one is used in alternatively when one exhaust. Thus omits the grid based
    energy utilization and cuts cost for transmission of power also. Here in this
    approach, the SD (source destination) pairs are classified into two groups based
    on CSI. Where one is direct D2D which doesn’t use relay for transmission and another
    one that uses relay BS for transmission of information. However, while allocating
    bandwidth direct D2D pair is given more preference in comparison to relay based
    D2D transmissions. As a result, authors observed that as the number of SD pair
    increases with D2D communication very less bandwidth left for relay based pairs
    which deteriorates their performance. In addition to this due to large no of direct
    D2D pairs green energy will exhaust quickly and to balance the leftover/residual
    energy the relay BSs with enough left over green energy will transmit their electricity
    via electric transmission lines to the relay BSs which run out of green energy.
    Hence proposed architecture maximizes the green energy utilization and further
    saves the on-grid energy. Further, Kotagi et al. [112] proposed a breathing technique
    to reduce the BS energy consumption by assigning the Tx(Transmission) power efficiently.
    Firstly the SINR of the user is compared with pre-specified SINR threshold value
    and if found greater Tx Power has modified accordingly. Thereupon resource is
    allocated, according to breathing pattern i.e. IoT devices are arranged in increasing
    (inhaling)/decreasing (exhaling) order on the basis required Tx Power and then
    mapped to resource block. In addition to this if available resources are less
    as compare to required, the user/device with a heavy request and highest Tx power
    was blocked. Apart from this transmission power is reduced if SINR of device is
    greater than the threshold value, which in turn improves the co-channel interference.
    Authors found that overall energy consumption of BS reduced and throughput is
    improved using the proposed approach. Further Samie et al. [113] enlighten the
    issue of underutilization of bandwidth of gateway. As IoT device have limited
    computation capability thus it is offloaded to the edge nodes i.e. gateway. However,
    due to limited bandwidth and diverse offloading levels, gateway bandwidth resource
    remain underutilized. Hence authors developed an algorithm that allocates or take
    away bandwidth from a device depending on its battery level. As a result, they
    found that battery life extended by 1.5 hour max and bandwidth utilization improved
    by 40%. Ejaz and Ibnkahla [114] proposed a framework for C-5GN. In the proposed
    framework, multiband sensing approach is used such that sensing is done in shared
    mode where each node is required to sense equal and reduced number of channels,
    thus reduced energy consumption. Although it is assured that all channels get
    processed once at least by a node. Apart from this, a game based CLRS (Cross Layer
    Reconfiguration) scheme is used to satisfy the diverse QoS requirement (latency,
    data rate, etc.) for each node. Hence, authors observed that the proposed technique
    reduced energy consumed during spectrum sensing and QoS is offered economically.
    Pang et al. [115] proposed a complete contention resolution approach based on
    the principle of context-aware and dynamic allocation of resource (CADRA). Overload
    scenario is first detected by analyzing the no of nonempty preambles. If detected,
    CADRA is called. This works in two phases firstly it determines the estimated
    number of RACH attempts by observing the preambles received successfully and empty
    preambles. After that in the second phase resource allocation is done. As a result,
    authors observed that throughput increased with moderate packet delay. Jang et
    al. [116] proposed Non orthogonal resource allocation collaborated with spatial
    group resource allocation scheme (SGRA). SGRA divides the cell into spatial groups.
    After dividing the cell region, it detects the preambles transmitted from the
    user in a certain spatial group by zadoff-chu sequence (which is shifted by spatial
    group number). Once the preambles utilized by a spatial group was determined using
    the ordered time delay metric, subgroups were formed. Authors found that using
    the proposed approach the probability of success of random access has increased
    a lot. Further, Morvari and Ghasemi [117] proposed a resource allocation scheme
    that works in two stage by efficacious use of resource available in UL. During
    the first phase, users are required to pass the access class bearing test. If
    a user manages to pass only then permitted to select the preamble (PA) and use
    physical uplink shared channel opportunity else has to select the special PA.
    Finally, in the second stage the secondary users are allowed to take access class
    bearing test again if passed allowed to request for UL shared channel. Hence it
    is inferred that the number of request that can be handled with proposed technique
    whilst dropping the wastage that occurs due to the collision of PA’s. Another
    extended RA scheme with spatial group resource allocation is proposed in [118].
    This scheme reuses the allocated preamble if the distance between the two nodes
    belonging to a different spatial group is greater than pre-specified minimum distance.
    In addition to this, access delay is also reduced. The proposed approach will
    utilize the unused bandwidth. Beside this collision probability is also tapered
    by using distinct UL resources for transmission. As interference is also a prevalent
    challenge for IoT device communication. Taking into consideration Iqbal et al.
    [119] proposed a constraint specific approach to improve the performance of IoT
    networks For solving the RA problem authors have used backtracking search algorithm
    named Soft-GORA.Where firstly channel is selected with minimum cost for tentative
    allocation to link, at the top in the ordered list and then checked against hard
    constraint. If it couldn’t satisfy the constraint, the allocated channel is removed
    and the next best option is opted. As a result, authors relaxing few constraints
    observed that throughput has improved and delay is reduced. Li et al. [120] proposed
    an architecture using edge computing further, they proposed a scheme to jointly
    control admission of new packet and allocation of resource together with power
    control. For this, the resource management controller at fog node uses three information
    i.e. service, state of the queue, CSI. Using the proposed schemes authors found
    that tradeoff is achieved between throughput and delay. Zhang et al. [121] proposed
    a joint optimize framework for the selection and allocation of resource among
    fog nodes (FN), data service subscribers (DSS) & data service operators.(DSO)
    They have developed a stakelberg game algorithm, here DSO provides the computing
    resources (CR) to DSS and if they require more CRB’s(Computing Resource Block)
    DSS competes for them. For this, another matching game algorithm is developed.
    As a result it was found that the system achieves high performance and optimally
    utilizes their resources. Further, cognitive 5G network (C-5GN) is expected to
    play a vital role in IoT success, Angelakis et al. [122] developed two algorithms
    RAND-INT and Average-cost allocation, to optimally allocate resources for services.
    These algorithms reduced the total cost of resource utilization and activation
    of interface. Where RAND-INT algorithm normalizes the demands to get an order
    in which resource is to be allocated. Henceforth the heaviest demand is served
    first by comparing the utilization cost of interfaces, thereby other demands are
    served either by splitting or by not splitting among two or more interfaces. Whereas
    the second algorithm assigns, the resource by averaging the total cost incurred.
    Authors have studied the impact of the activation cost on the services’ splits
    and distribution among the interfaces. As a result, they found that for random
    service with high demand, interface total cost increases linearly with respect
    to the number of services. Hence above discussed technique proves that resource
    technique can enhance communication, connectivity and collaboration of IoT devices.
    The chief objective of resource allocation technique is to minimize the power
    consumption per node, BER, Delay and maximize the throughput and network utilization.
    The above discussed techniques are summarized in Table 6. TABLE 6 Efficient Resource
    Allocation Techniques for IoT SECTION VI. Energy Consumption in Lifecycle of IoT
    Devices Sensing device act as the backbone for IoT applications. Different sensors
    are deployed massively to develop a ubiquitous sensed environment, to offer diverse
    monitoring and control services. Indeed to avoid service interruptions of critical
    applications sensing device must operate permissibly for a long time. However,
    as most of the IoT devices are powered by constrained energy source hence device
    lifetime longevity is a critical issue. Therefore the device must be monitored
    precisely for optimal utilization. In this context, the trend of energy consumption
    during different states of the sensor is studied in [123]. There are five modes
    among which sensor switches- Mode I: Wake up from Sleep mode, Mode II: After Sleep
    mode. Mode III: Sensing, Mode IV: Processing, Mode V: Transmission. Hussain [123]
    studied different case studies to see the trend of energy consumption during different
    modes. As a conclusion of various trends (Fig. 16), it was found that during Processing-Phase
    energy consumption was least whereas, for Sensing Phase, node consumes the highest
    power as compare to Transmission Phase. However, energy consumption during Transmission
    phase depends on the application. For example, consider the applications like
    Humidity/thermal measurement the power consumption during the wake-up and in getting
    ready for sensing phase is more as compare to other applications like temperature
    sensing which require less power for the same. Duty Cycle is the other metric
    that affects the energy consumption in the sensor node. As the duty cycle increases,
    energy consumption increases consequently lifetime of the node decreases. There
    are various factors that affect the lifetime of an IoT device such as duty cycle,
    the amount of data to be communicated, processing time other factors like aging,
    self-discharge and temperature [124]. Hence various energy efficiency techniques
    have been proposed in the literature to improve the lifetime of an IoT device
    and hence network lifetime. In the next section the recently proposed energy efficiency
    techniques are discussed in detail. FIGURE 16. Energy consumption during the lifecycle
    of IoT device [123]. Show All A. Energy Efficient Techniques for Green Communication
    The energy budget affects the sensor node processing time, quality of measurement
    and amount of data it can transmit, thus energy efficiency techniques can a play
    crucial role to improve QoE. Rault et al. [125] classified the energy efficiency
    techniques classified into five categories of radio optimization, data reduction,
    sleep/wakeup schemes, energy efficient routing and battery repletion. Where radio
    optimization techniques would optimize modulation schemes, transmission power,
    and antenna direction on the other hand data reduction reduces the data transmitted.
    Furthermore Sleep/Wake-up adaptively switches the node to sleep or active mode
    to save energy. Other two techniques, energy efficient routing, and battery repletion
    works on routing efficiency and ways of harvesting energy or finding ways to charge
    battery automation, respectively. (Fig. 17, discusses briefly the impact of different
    techniques). In this section, the existing literature on energy efficiency techniques
    is discussed. FIGURE 17. Classification of energy efficiency techniques for IoT.
    Show All 1) Sleep/Wakeup Techniques Khodr et al. [126] enlighten that though the
    duty cycling technique could reduce power consumption but this will reduce network
    reactivity. Thus authors proposed a design of sensor based RF wake up technology.
    This design approach wakes the sensor only when the address decoder detects that
    whether a received signal address is of IoT device or not. Thereby omits the fake
    call wakeups hence reduced energy consumption. Perles et al. [127] did a case
    study on cultural heritage and proposed an architecture to improve the lifespan
    of sensor life up to 20 years using unlicensed LPWAN technologies LoRa &SigFox.
    In order to keep the energy consumption low, the proposed architecture wakes up
    the microcontroller whenever a new packet arrives. Apart from this, it uses a
    cluster management system, Elastic Cloud Computing Cluster (EC3) which can deploy
    and un-deploy nodes as per demand i.e. nodes will be deployed if load increases
    and un-deployed if they are idle. 2) Cognitive Radio Techniques Further, Qureshi
    et al. [128] discussed cognitive radio approach where unlicensed users opportunistically
    access the unused spectrum holes that are not used by the licensed user. Hence
    to achieve good throughput, uninterrupted connectivity, and Reliable communication,
    for both licensed and unlicensed user the concept of the backup data channel (BDC)
    was introduced. Where if licensed user return than unlicensed user resumes its
    communication using BDC. Hence communication time between SUs for task completion
    will be reduced and thereby the energy consumption of CRAN’s will reduce and throughput
    will increase. Furthermore, Li et al. [129] proposed a 5G based framework where
    the central control unit act as both cloud and central data processor takes the
    sensed data from the physical world. In addition to this authors, fractionated
    the resource allocation into two sub problems of power and channel allotment in
    industrial Cyber physical IoT. These sub-problems are solved separately. For individual
    channel allotment, the energy efficiency is achieved using game theory and Dinkelbach’s
    algorithm. After this, the Hungarian method was used for channel allocation. Authors
    analyzed that IHM-VD could perform outstandingly. 3) Routing Techniques Further
    Yi et al. [130] proposed a topology control algorithm in which nodes discover
    their neighbors asymmetrically. For time synchronization multiple of two is taken
    as reference point. Authors observed that energy consumption got abridged due
    to curtailment in wakeup calls required to discover the neighboring node. Further,
    the utmost drawback of continuous sensing (i.e. nonselective monitoring) is unfiltered
    data that results in significant energy consumption of sensors. Basnayaka and
    Haas [131] proposed a physical layer modulation scheme RNM (random number modulation)
    that operates in two modes energy efficient and low latency. To switch between
    modes the constellation order and random bit generated by random generator were
    considered. Proposed approach compromise latency for energy efficiency, as the
    user was allowed to transmit the data block only when it matches with random sequence
    generated by a random number generator otherwise the user could not transmit the
    data. Shen et al. [132] proposed a clustering based protocol EECRP for IoT assisted
    by WSN to enhance the performance of the network. Firstly a cluster head is opted
    by comparing the energy of each node with pre-specified energy (threshold value)
    after this taking the distance from the centroid (energy based) of the network
    to the node is considered. This leads to uniform energy consumption in the network.
    After this for optimal result, the max distance value is broadcasted by BS to
    all the nodes, in order to avoid long distance communication. As a result, it
    has been found that overall energy consumption of the network is reduced in comparison
    to proprietary protocols. In extension to this, Tian et al. [133] have discussed,
    when to use network coding concept to reduce the energy consumption. Authors have
    proposed a network coding and power control based routing (NCPCR) protocol. Using
    this protocol intermediate node drops the duplicate packets and keep the relevant
    information in its buffer. Source node selects the path with the minimum distance
    to transmit the data packets. As a result the energy consumption is reduced as
    no of packets to be retransmitted is reduced and moreover, it opts for the shortest
    path also and in addition to this, it can handle scalability. 4) Data Reduction
    Technique Perera et al. [134] proposed a platform C-MOSDEN that performs sensing
    tasks collaboratively and in a selective manner i.e. adaptive sensing to reduce
    energy consumption. As sensing would require less computational efforts to drive
    knowledge from data generated. In addition to this, the storage cost will also
    be reduced. 5) Battery Repletion Technique Nan et al. [135] enlighten that offloading
    the traffic at fog layer or edge layer has led to increased carbon footprints,
    thus they have proposed an online algorithm LOTEC (Lyapunov optimization on time
    and energy cost). The proposed technique suggested using green power source i.e.
    solar energy and grid power as a standby power source. The discussed energy efficiency
    techniques are summarized in tabular form in Table 7. In this paper, two novel
    application based energy efficient approaches are proposed. For smart agriculture
    and Smart Healthcare. Where “ZTPA” -a hybrid approach, centered on two techniques
    “Sleep/wake up” and “Energy efficient routing” is proposed. E2AHMS is proposed
    for smart healthcare, which is a radio based approach. These two approaches with
    their proposed mathematical approach are discussed in detail in section VIII.
    TABLE 7 Energy Effeciency Techniques for IoT SECTION VII. Open Issues Ascertaining
    the vision of the NBIoT is not a tranquil task, owing to multiple challenges that
    are required to be addressed Although NBIoT offers significant features for LPWA
    applications, yet a number of critical issues remain unattended that seeks traction
    from the research community. The technical issues and challenges related to energy
    are discussed in this section. A. Non-Uniformity in Resources Allocation In the
    current scenario, resources are allocated on the basis of total available power,
    coverage range, and demanded applications. Due to non-uniformity in the requirement
    of resources, a non-uniformity in power consumption persists. This is a critical
    challenge that seeks redressal as there are no studies/algorithms/techniques available
    for uniform resource allocation in NBIoT. A unified platform is required for resource
    allocation so that applications can be handled adaptively in real time scenarios.
    B. Difficulty in Achieving the Desired Throughput The prime advantage of NBIoT
    enabled device is to make use of low power to operate. Therefore the power of
    the signal transmitted will be low. Beside this due to channel losses, fading
    & interference (Intra/Inter) SINR will drop drastically. Hence it would be quite
    difficult to achieve the desired throughput in all condition. Thus proper channel
    modeling, optimized algorithms/techniques required to be designed/developed to
    achieve desired throughput C. Inter-Channel Interference The allocation of frequency
    in in-band or standalone mode will not be synchronous among all the cells in the
    network. This results in interference among neighboring cells. Interference within
    the same cell also exists due to the deployment of small cells in the macro cell.
    These result in a fall in the SNR. This is a decisive challenge, especially for
    critical applications like acute healthcare applications, where noise could tamper
    biological readings. This may lead to the wrong detection and thereby wrong medication.
    Thus an efficient scheme is required to be developed to reduce interference and
    provide QoS to the users. D. Spectral Efficiency To achieve extended coverage,
    the concept of multiple repetitions is utilized. Undoubtedly this would improve
    the Tx Reliability but will lead to loss of spectral efficiency. Thus an efficient
    resource allocation scheme is required which could optimally decide the repetition
    factor. Furthermore, to maintain high channel capacity- device consumes more power,
    consequently reducing its lifetime. This open issue needs to be addressed because
    it would adversely affect the battery lifetime E. Latency Different types of latency
    can occur during NBIoT communication: a) UL/DL latency, b) synchronization latency,
    c) the latency associated with resource allocation, d) latency associated with
    packet synchronization. Though NBIoT applications are delay tolerant, yet latency
    needs to be kept below 10s, especially for real time applications such as health
    monitoring. Thus the theoretical computational model must be framed to improve
    the latency analysis. F. Synchronization With the Access Point Consider a scenario
    where utility meters are positioned close to each other. When all devices would
    send information to the cluster head, synchronization will be difficult for the
    access point as there would be interference between devices within its range.
    Besides this, other factors like the priority of a device, its residual power
    availability and channel conditions will also affect the synchronization process,
    raising its complexity. Hence this open issue needs to be addressed by providing
    techniques/algorithms for synchronization. G. Security The issue of security is
    very critical for NBIoT. As low power devices have limited resources, they are
    more vulnerable to security attacks. By exploiting the data integrity or tracking
    the traffic pattern, passive or active attack can befall at the perception layer.
    Besides, other security attacks such as the injection of false data by an intruder,
    transmission of interference signals, etc. can also occur. Thus continuous efforts
    must be put in by industry, academicians, and researchers to maintain the faith
    of users in using the services provided by the NBIoT application. H. Carbon Footprint
    Inflation The massive connectivity among millions of devices would generate an
    enormous amount of data. In order to draw an inference from the collected information,
    servers need to manage data through extensive computations. This will overburden
    the servers, resulting in rising in energy and subsequently raising carbon emissions.
    In addition, the factors such as manufacturing of billions of IoT devices, shipments
    of these devices, excess use of radio access network, etc. will also elevate the
    carbon footprint. Fig. 18 demonstrates the percentage of carbon emissions due
    to various such activities [136]. Collaboratively, these will have an adverse
    impact on pollution levels. Hence, the need for a generic architecture arises
    to achieve Green IoT, whilst assuring better QoS to all the users. FIGURE 18.
    Carbon footprint due to various activities. Show All I. E-Waste Management As
    technology improves, people started procuring additional electronic equipment’s
    like PDA’s, desktop computers, smart phones, and gadgets, though might not be
    required. The complex structure of these e-waste/WEEE (waste electrical and electronic
    equipment) makes it difficult to destroy. The condition will become even more
    severe in coming future when millions of sensors and battery operated IoT devices
    will have to be destroyed and replaced with new ones, either due to reformation
    in technology or lifetime expiry. Many countries like Japan, Taiwan, and U.S etc.
    are working on this hot burning issue since 2001. However, together with this
    research efforts are needed for the development of the green disposable electronic
    device. J. Cloud-Radio Access Network (C-RAN) Overhead In C-RAN the virtual centralized
    BBU (Base Band Unit) is used to reduce the OPEX, generated heat, and latency.
    Hence, instead of having BBU at each cell site with remote Radio head, they are
    repositioned in centralized manner in BBU home. In IoT, the users would be monitoring
    & controlling multiple devices remotely, this would overburden the existing network
    especially between the RRH and BBU Pool. Moreover, the different types of data
    i.e. real, non-real, social, sensitive, medical/health data, agriculture related
    data, etc. would collectively create an extensive overhead for CRAN. Pertaining
    to this, a huge number of processing units would be required to process the enormous
    IoT data. This, in turn, generates massive power requirement. Hence “prioritization
    of data” could be one of the solutions to deal with this open issue. K. Interface
    With Next Generation Like 5G Network The journey of IoT from virtual ideology
    to real time implementation has many milestones to achieve and one of those is
    interoperability among IoT devices. As we know that 5G operates on the very high
    frequency range like millimeter waves frequency, ranging from 28 to 32 GHz, whilst
    IoT devices operate at 2.2 GHz. Thus it’s a big challenge for the researchers
    to interface IoT with 5G Other than this, the high operating frequency in 5G networks
    escalates power consumption levels to achieve the data rate of the order of Gbps.
    In contrast to this IoT devices are highly power constrained thus operate at low
    power levels. This requires technological developments. Including this various
    other challenges such as [137] Cooperation among millions of devices, Heterogeneous
    subnet, Anonymous device configuration and Conflicts among semantics of devices
    exist. All these will collectively urge for research efforts before 5G specifications
    are standardized. L. MIMO/Massive MIMO Undoubtedly, Multiple Input Multiple Output
    (MIMO) technique provide a high data rate with high Reliability. In MIMO BS is
    acquainted with multiple antennas to improve the spectral & energy efficiency.
    Although, MIMO is an enabler for 5G, yet, it is difficult to employ MIMO in IoT.
    It is because, in the multi antenna scenario, information transmissions from the
    sensor nodes will require more processing during the synchronization phase. This
    results in more power consumption at the sensor end. Since the sensor nodes have
    limited battery capacity, adaptability of IoT devices in a MIMO environment is
    an open challenge that needs to be addressed. M. Channel State Information Collection
    Overhead The channel state assessment overhead intensifies linearly with a number
    of users. If the number of users grows beyond the threshold value then channel
    block could no longer support the assessment overhead within the narrow coherence
    time, especially for IoT applications. Moreover, the inaccurate channel estimation
    results in unreliable transmission. This uncertainty is due to the staleness of
    information after a certain time gap, due to the collision of pilot signals in
    UL. Pertaining to this, contention and interference would aggravate. As a result,
    more retransmissions are required which upraise the power consumption of IoT devices.
    Moreover, multiple verifications will contribute to more power consumption. SECTION
    VIII. Proposed Architecture Towards Green Communication Using NBIoT The world
    population is expected to grow up to 8.025 billion by 2030. Consequently, this
    growth will inflate the global food demand. Thus meeting the demands of the immense
    population will be a tough task. The varying climatic conditions, scarcity of
    water, etc. shall further aggravate the circumstances In addition to this, enhanced
    health assistance will also be required for projected population, which will be
    quite difficult to handle using existing infrastructure and services. Thus integration
    of IoT with Agriculture & Health sector can ensure a resourceful and healthy life
    for an individual. Despite, all this revolution that IoT is capable to bring in,
    the biggest stumbling block of its success is to provide energy efficient solution.
    As most of the IoT devices are constrained in term of energy. Hence this paper
    is proposing energy efficiency techniques for two prime applications: Smart Agriculture:
    Zonal Thermal Pattern Analysis and Smart Health: Energy Efficiency Adaptive Health
    Monitoring System.NBIoT is used for both the application as it offers favorable
    features like extended coverage with deep indoor penetration, long battery life,
    supports high density, require the low-cost device, and provide end to end security.
    Moreover, it would not require the deployment of new infrastructure as compared
    to proprietary technologies LoRa and SigFox, hence would offer a cost effective
    solution. A. Proposed Technique for Smart Agriculture: ZTPA 1) Case Study 1: Energy
    Efficient Agriculture Monitoring, Irrigation System for Green Communication The
    growing population and climate vagaries are forestalling that in future decades
    water resources would reduce eminently, especially for agriculture. Since agriculture
    practices require an ample amount of water, effective utilization of water is
    an obvious issue to be addressed. This section investigates an energy efficient
    technique for productive utilization of water. It has been put forth to overcome
    the disadvantages of conventional irrigation systems like wastage of water (due
    to percolation, evaporation), abbreviated crop yield. To economize the use of
    water in agriculture, IoT with Deep Learning could play a significant role. In
    the proposed scenario, soil moisture sensors are deployed in the farm field under
    consideration. Thereafter data aggregated from multiple sensors will be passed
    on to the BS using NBIoT and then to the NBIoT cloud. At the cloud, data (moisture)
    will be processed using Deep Learning and subsequently, the farm field will be
    adaptively divided into zones based on moisture level, as shown in Fig. 19 (for
    one iteration which is subjected to change in other iterations). Hereafter depending
    on the moisture levels i.e. moderate moisture level, high moisture level and least
    moisture level, zones will be irrigated. To accomplish this, the water pump is
    attached with smart NBIoT enabled water control device. This device would transmit
    the water in desired quantity and for the desired time in the zones. This scenario
    could be well understood by Fig. 19 where zone Z2 with dark pink color has the
    highest moisture, Z1 has the least moisture and Z3 has moderate moisture level.
    As Z2 has good moisture level so no water would be transmitted in that zone. Hence,
    sensor nodes in Z2 will enter idle state followed by the sleep state for a long
    period of time by exploiting eDRX in NBIoT. This will save water along with energy.
    In addition to this UL traffic will also be reduced, thereby reducing the congestion
    impact also. FIGURE 19. Proposed architecture for energy efficient precision agriculture
    using NBIoT–toward green communication. Show All There is another aspect to be
    considered while designing this scenario i.e. land orientation. Hence this use
    case study is divided into two sub problems: a: Uniform Land Surface When land
    has uniform orientation like in the plain area, there will be no water logging
    problem. Therefore, farm/agriculture land can be irrigated by classifying the
    moisture data as discussed previously. Thus watering of the field by the proposed
    pioneered way could avoid the wastage of water. Also in the plain area, the orientation
    of land is more or less uniform, thus the pattern of power consumption would not
    be much diverse. This can be depicted by thermal pattern analysis using drones
    and satellite captured thermal images. b: Non-Uniform Land Surface Another case
    is when agriculture land has non-uniform orientation like in hilly areas, which
    leads to the uneven power consumption of devices. As in some case, eNB will allocate
    the resource to the sensor via NBIoT using direct path whereas in some cases using
    an indirect path. In our proposed approach we have not only considered direct/indirect
    resource allocation but in addition to this, the overlap condition will also be
    considered, where one region overlaps with another region. As shown in Fig. 20
    regions R1 and R2, describes the overlap region. Here the sensor S3, S5, S9, S21,
    S14 suffers from Inter-Interference. FIGURE 20. Proposed architecture for energy
    efficient precision agriculture using NBIoT based on thermal pattern analysis
    (TPA). Show All Hence the power consumption pattern will be diverse for node present
    in this region and node present outside of this region which in turn would affect
    the network lifetime. In addition to this SNR will also get influenced by interference
    within inter-interference region. 2) Mathematical Analysis for Energy Efficient
    Smart Agriculture Sensor nodes SN 1 , SN 2 , SN 3 ,……., SN n are deployed in the
    field and as per proposed model, it is assumed CH of disjoint sets of sensors
    (CH1, CH2, and CH3) will communicate with the processing unit (PU). Further, this
    PU would communicate with BS. Assume that using NBIoT technology k PRB’s (physical
    resource blocks) are required. As the signal propagates from SN i to NBIoT node
    path loss (PL) will occur. PL will depend on the position of sensor. If the sensor
    is placed under the soil or underground, then soil would absorb the signal and
    hence leads to path loss which can be evaluated as follows P ∗ C = P real C −j(
    P dipolarloss + σ 2πf P D ) (3) View Source Here P ∗ C specifies the complex-permittivity
    (cp), P real C denotes the real part of cp, P dipolarloss is due to Relaxation
    and P D specifies the relative dielectric-permittivity [138], [139]. The permittivity
    of soil can be affected importantly by parameters like water content, frequency
    of signal, soil composition and soil conductivity. Hence it is difficult to measure
    the soil permittivity accurately. Path loss can be calculated using equation (4)
    where T p is Transmission power, T g Transmission gain, R g receiver gain, PL
    fs is path loss due to free space propagation of signal and PL M is path loss
    due to medium, α is path loss between NBIoT node and eNB.1 PL= T p + T g + R g
    + PL fs − PL M +α (4) View Source Further path loss due to medium can be evaluated
    as follows [139] PL M = WD s + TL s (5) View Source Where WD s is path loss due
    to difference in wavelength of signal in soil in comparison of free space and
    TL s is transmission loss. If the sensor is placed above the surface (of ground),
    then plants would act as scatterers and thereby the path loss can be evaluated
    using equation (6) PL(d)=PL( d 0 )+10mlog( d d 0 )+ OH T i +α (6) View Source
    Here OH T i represent the obstacle height at time iε {1, 2, 3}, where i=1 specifies
    the phase, when seeds are just sawn, so no plant would be there at that time so
    no obstacle. Likewise for i=2 , specifies that plant has started budding up so
    it will have certain height. Similarly for i=3 specifies, plant has fully grown
    to its full height. Thus corresponding to height of plant, obstacle path loss
    parameter would increase. Here d 0 specifies the reference distance between sensing
    node and NBIoT node (Refer Fig. 20.). Here α specifies the path loss between NBIoT
    node and eNB. Hence the SINR of the sensing node can be expressed as SINR= S T
    G k N+ I T (7) View Source Where N is thermal noise, I T total interference, S
    T represents the transmitted signal power and G k is the channel gain between
    sensor node k and NBIoT node. We then express the total interference as I T =
    I interzone + I intrazone + I Soilreflectivity (8) View Source Interference that
    occurs within zone, between zones and also due to soil reflectivity. Further channel
    capacity (C) can be evaluated based on Shannon theorem as follows C= Blog 2 (1+
    S k G k N+ I T ) (9) View Source Based on these above formulations we conclude
    that capacity of a sensor deployed in the agricultural area will be adversely
    affected by the interference generated by the adjacent sensor nodes, scatterers,
    etc. a: Energy Consumption Evaluation For electing cluster head out of n sensor
    node for each disjoint set of sensing nodes. Each node power level is to be determined
    and one with highest power level is selected. Power level get deteriorates due
    to energy dissipation. Hence we first evaluate the total energy consumed due to
    various factors for each node (The energy model used here is given [140].) E C
    Total =EC Sensing + EC Processing+ EC Transmission + EC Sleeping + EC Switching
    (10) View Source Where energy consumption during sensing could be evaluated using
    equation (11) EC Sensing = EC Sample ∗n (11) View Source Here EC Sample specifies
    the energy consumption during sampling of each sample, n represents the no of
    samples. Similarly, energy consumption during transmission ( EC Transmission )
    depends on supply voltage S v , current I and time T required for transmission
    EC Transmission = S v ∗I∗T (12) View Source Energy consumed during switching from
    active to sleep state [141] EC Switching = T Swt ∗( PC Active + PC Sleep )/2 (13)
    View Source Hence total energy consumption can be evaluated (using eq. 10) and
    using Relation E= P*T, power levels can be evaluated for each node, where T will
    include time for switching, sleeping, active, sensing, and processing. Hence CH
    can be selected for by comparing the power of all the nodes. Here another aspect
    must also be included that is if the node has acted as CH earlier also then. Hence
    we evaluate the energy consumption when node act as CH, ( EC CH ) . This will
    depend on length of message L MSG and energy consumed by transmitter if sending
    the message to processing point (PP) or energy consumed when receiver receives
    data by PP [142]. EC CH = L MSG ∗ EC TX/RX ∗ D PP (14) View Source Hence total
    energy consumption equation if node acted as CH could be rewritten as E C Total
    =EC Sensing + EC Processing+ EC Transmission + EC Sleeping + EC Switching + EC
    CH (15) View Source Finally energy efficiency EE can be evaluated as ratio of
    total energy consumed ,EC TOTAL and energy of sensor at time of deployment ,E
    TOTAL EE= EC TOTAL / E TOTAL (16) View Source Hence using the proposed approach
    energy efficiency can be improved as EC TOTAL will be reduced by exploiting the
    eDRX of sensing nodes. B. Proposed Technique for Smart Health: E2AHMS 1) Case
    Study: Energy Efficient Health Monitoring System for Green Communication IoT provides
    a big platform to solve medical issues, in real time scenario. Integration of
    IoT with Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) is gaining much of the momentum and
    currently being used for health monitoring of soldiers at battlefields, patients
    in hospitals, elderly people who could not visit hospitals very often, etc. The
    performance of WBAN (i.e. reliability, delay, power efficiency) chiefly depends
    on the physical and medium access control layer. Moreover, as most of the IoT-BAN
    devices are battery operated, thus power optimization will greatly impact their
    lifetime and performance. In this context, this paper is proposing a novel approach
    namely “Energy Efficient Adaptive Health Monitoring System” E2AHMS. This approach
    will work in an energy efficient manner by adaptively distributing the transmission
    power required to monitor the patient. In our proposed Health Monitoring system
    three prospective conditions have been considered Stable, Mono-Stable, Relatively
    mobile (Fig. 21). FIGURE 21. Proposed health monitoring system using NBIoT–toward
    green communication. Show All Case B.1: Stable: When a patient lying on the bed
    i.e. stationary condition Case B.2: Mono-Stable: When a patient is sitting or
    standing. Case B.3: Relatively mobile: When a patient will be moving either by
    walking or using a wheelchair. Our proposed approach E2AHMS can not only be used
    for patients who require continuous monitoring, but also for health monitoring
    of person who are fit but wants to keep track of their health to prevent themselves
    from severe disease. As in both the cases, network life time will play a vital
    role, which can be increased or improved by using proposed optimized energy efficient
    algorithm. E2AHMS will work in an energy efficient manner by adaptively using
    the transmission , power required during different postural mobility (considered
    before). To understand this it is required to first understand the difference
    in energy requirement during different cases under consideration. CASE B.1 (STABLE):
    While sleeping it is very likely that the sensors will have LOS communication.
    Hence, Body Area Network will be in stable state. Thus power required for transmission
    would be least and hence energy required. As path loss would be minimum between
    sensing nodes and NBIoT coordinator node. Thus energy consumed during sleeping
    state E c_s_st i can be given by summation of energy consumption due to factors
    such as: due to switching from one state to another (On, Off, sleep, idle, Active,
    idle) E st_tr i , due to circuit of sensing device E Crkt i , energy consumption
    due to processing of signals E Proc i , energy consumption due to transmission
    of signal E Trans i , due to acting as relay/connecting node for other sensors
    E connecting_node i and due to various delays (queuing, propagation, transmission)
    E Delays i . E c_s_st i = E st_tr i + E Crkt i + E Proc i + E Trans i + E connecting_node
    i + E Delays i (17) View Source CASE B.2 (MONO-STABLE STATE): In this case the
    patient could be in a sitting posture or moving his arms or having food. Hence
    LOS would not be there between sensing nodes. It is very likely that obstacles
    might interfere with the path of signal transmission thus shadowing would lead
    to multipath loss and hence energy consumption will be more during this posture.
    Energy consumption during mono-stable state E c_ms_st i , can be evaluated by
    equation (18) E c_ms_st i = E st_tr i + E Crkt i + E Proc i + E Trans i + E connecting_node
    i + E Delays i + E obst i (18) View Source Here E obst i specifies the energy
    consumed due to obstacles/shadowing/multipath effect. CASE B.3 (RELATIVELY MOBILE):
    In this state, the patient will be walking or moving with the help of wheel chair
    or might be doing some routine activities. Therefore it is more likely that NLOS
    transmission will occur due to various reasons such as obstacles in the surrounding,
    links between sensors would change rapidly due to body movement, etc. Hence more
    loss of information and thereby more energy consumption. Energy consumption during
    mobile state could be given by equation 19. E c_m_st i = E st_tr i + E Crkt i
    + E Proc i + E Trans i + E connectin_node i + E Delays i +n. E obst i + E relink
    i (19) View Source Here E relink i denotes the energy consumed due to Relinking
    between sensor nodes and gateway. Thus, it is clear from the above discussion
    that due to multipath effect and different channel conditions, different postural
    movement leads to different energy consumption. Therefore in proposed technique
    E2AHMS, depending on postural movement level transmission power will be used adaptively
    which can be determined using graph theory. Whereas conventionally data was transmitted
    with equal power without considering LOS communication is possible or not and
    also channel conditions are good or not. Hence our proposed approach will be an
    energy efficient approach for Health monitoring application. This proposed approach
    is also supported by mathematical formulation. 2) Mathematical Formulation Multiple
    sensors are positioned on the human body I={i1,i2,i3….,in} (20) View Source Here
    each sensor has a coordinate point i1=( x 1 , y 1 ) i2=( x 2 , y 2 ) (21.1) (21.2)
    View Source Path Loss Analysis As the signal propagates through WBAN this gets
    attenuated due to multiple factors such as reflection, diffraction, refraction,
    fading, etc. To analyze path loss in on-body WBAN, IEEE P802.15, 2009 [143] has
    given a path loss model. Using the same as a reference, path loss can be evaluated
    during different postural mobility. Case B.1 (Stable/Sleeping State): PL dB =
    PL d 0 +10n log 10 d/ d 0 + S dB (22) View Source Here d 0 is reference the distance
    from NBIoT coordinator. S dB , is shadowing factor added to it due to movement
    of body parts. However, in the sleeping state, it would be negligible. Case B.2
    (Mono-Stable/Sitting State): During this state, signal could fade due to various
    obstacle such as table while having food/medicine, legs under the chair or below
    the table. Moreover due to the movement of body parts effect of shadowing would
    be high. Hence path loss would be more in comparison to the sleeping state. PL
    dB = PL d 0 +10n log 10 d/ d 0 +( S dB + F 1 + F 2 ) (23) View Source Here F 1
    + F 2 , is addition PL due to factors such as obstacles, interference, surroundings
    Case B.3 (Mobile State): During this state person would be moving from one place
    to another thus link with access point could change very quickly (From one floor
    to another, one room to another, walking, etc.). The signal would attenuate n
    times more in relative mobile state than Sitting/Mono-Stable state. PL dB = PL
    d 0 +10n log 10 d/ d 0 +n( S dB + F 1 + F 2 + F 3 ) (24) View Source Here F 3
    specifies an additional factor of multipath propagation of signal. As PL is difference
    of transmitted power and received power PL= P Tx − P RX (25) View Source Thus
    received power during different case studies can be evaluated as follows: Case
    B.1: P S_ST Rx (dB)= P Tx − PL S_ST dB (26.1) View Source Case B.2: P MS_ST Rx
    (dB)= P Tx − PL MS_ST dB (26.2) View Source Case B.3: P M_ST Rx (dB)= P Tx − PL
    M_ST dB (26.3) View Source In the conventional system, same transmission power
    is used for all the cases whether required or not, but in the proposed technique
    E2AHMS transmission power would be used adaptively depending on postural mobility.
    Hence power will be used in an optimized way. SNR can be evaluated for different
    considered case studies using received power SNR cas e i = RecivedSignal_power
    P cas e i Rx Noise_Power (27) View Source Thereby channel capacity ( C cas e i
    ) for considered cases {i=B.1, B.2, B.3} using Shannon theorem could be evaluated
    for considered case studies as C cas e i =B(1+ SNR cas e i ) (28) View Source
    Hence Energy efficiency can be evaluated using equation EE cas e i = Channe l
    cas e i P cas e i Tx ∗100% (29) View Source It is clear from the above equation
    the high mobility would result in more energy consumption. Hence using the proposed
    technique power will be saved and thereby could enhance the battery lifetime.
    Thus an energy efficient solution. Using the same theme of the proposed approach
    real time hardware implementation is done which is discussed in next section.
    C. Real Time Hardware Implementation for Proposed Work 1) Hardware System Model
    Fig. 22 gives an overview of proposed approach real time implementation. Here
    two axis accelerometer sensors and a pulse sensor is used for real time analysis.
    To determine the patient postural mobility accelerometer sensors are placed on
    his right hand and right leg. Apart from this a pulse sensor is used to measure
    the pulse rate of the patient. Further, in order to send the health information
    to eNB in energy efficient way. Our proposed approach will differentiate between
    different postural (Fig. 22 (a), (b), (c), (d), (e)) using edge computing. Such
    that energy is utilized in an efficiently way by using an optimal amount of transmission
    power of device as suggested in proposed approach to transmit information to eNB.
    Hereafter the health information is forwarded to the centralized cloud and then
    to application server and finally to doctor, who tracks the record of patient,
    to avoid unwanted situation. Finally, doctor would prescribe some medicine if
    required otherwise the message will be sent to user that he is fine. FIGURE 22.

    Interface 4) Implementation The first step is to setup the connections of all
    the desired sensors with Arduino Uno. Thereafter the Arduino Uno is connected
    to development system that has integrated development environment (IDE) with USB.
    Once the setup is done the code developed for considered case (stable, mono stable
    and walking) is uploaded to Arduino Uno. Hereafter the data is collected related
    to different postural mobility of person and processed by comparing against the
    threshold value to determine the postural mobility level. Fig. 24, shows the plot
    of variation in amplitude due to movement of hand and leg (specifically) in developed
    code. Once the movement is determined thereafter the health information like pulse
    rate, etc. is sent via NBIoT with required transmitted power to eNB. Hereafter
    the health information is processed and corresponding actions are than advised
    to the patients. FIGURE 23. Interface of real time health monitoring setup. Show
    All FIGURE 24. Screenshot of plot with arduino IDE. Show All 5) Performance Analysis
    As per our proposed architecture, we have done the performance analysis on the
    basis of a real-time hardware implementation for healthcare monitoring system
    with all possible case studies. We have deployed sensors on body parts of patients
    to fetch the information regarding postural mobility as shown in Fig 22. (a),
    (b), (c), (d), (e). All the data regarding different postural movements saved
    in the database, which is then processed and compared at the same time. The postural
    movement is observed for 500 sec from 926sec to 1426 sec (Fig 25 describes the
    variation of amplitude due to different postural movement.) FIGURE 25. A Plot
    of variation in amplitude vs Time corresponding to Hand and foot movement during
    different postural mobility, to differentiate between transmission-power to be
    used (Here blue and Red depicts hand movement whereas Green and orange depicts
    the leg movement). Show All Approximately for 94 sec the person has kept his body
    in sleeping condition as shown in Fig. 22 (a),(b), it has been observed that during
    this period, a variation of the different sensor output is low and smooth, output
    amplitude is far below as compared to a threshold value. Hereafter the person
    changed his posture to sitting posture Fig. 22(c) and maintained it for 80 sec.
    For this posture, it was observed that variation is high in comparison to sleeping
    posture, but get stable after a certain time. Hereafter person changed his posture
    from sitting to standing (Fig. 22(d), (e)) and did some movement of hand and leg.
    It can be easily seen that variation is high and fluctuating, some irregular spikes
    appeared in the process. On the basis of performance analysis, we have observed
    that power optimization in all these case studies is very important and because
    this real time analysis aligns with our proposed approach E2AHMS. Hence power
    can be optimized with fair resource allocation to achieve the better quality of
    service is possible through our proposed approach. Conclusion IoT is reforming
    technical industry. This reformation will aid in struggling with global challenges
    that are budding due to depletion of natural resources, inflated food demand,
    scarcity of water, etc. Where on one hand IoT is giving hope for resourceful life
    but on other hand, it will play a crucial role in inflating carbon footprint.
    Hence solutions must be given to reduce carbon emission. In this study recent
    work related to energy efficiency techniques has been surveyed and discussed.
    In contribution toward green-IoT, two novel energy efficient approaches have been
    proposed - ZTPA for smart agriculture and E2AHMS for smart healthcare using NBIoT.
    NBIoT is a new licensed radio technology that guarantees to provide a cost effective,
    reliable, and low power solution. It can coexist with the existing LTE cellular
    networks therefore no new infrastructure is required to be setup from scratch,
    hence installation cost is low. This paper provides a detailed technical view
    of NBIoT and its state-of-the-art. To spur advance research and speed up the extensive
    use of the NBIoT systems the research challenges and open issues of NBIoT are
    also discussed. Appendix A list of current research projects based on IoT is presented

    impulse towards a larger introduction of Information and Communication Technology
    (ICT) in the agricultural field is currently experiencing its momentum, as digitisation
    has large potentialities to provide benefits for both producers and consumers;
    on the other hand, pushing technological solutions into a rural context encounters
    several challenges. In this work, we provide a survey of the most recent research
    activities, in the form of both research projects and scientific literature, with
    the objective of showing the already achieved results, the current investigations,
    and the still open challenges, both technical and non technical. We mainly focus
    on the EU territory, identifying threats and concerns, and then looking at existing
    and upcoming solutions to overcome those barriers. Previous article in issue Next

    computing5GSatelliteUAV 1. Introduction Smart Farming (SF) refers to the application
    of ICT to agriculture. Data collected and analysed through ICT techniques support
    efficient production processes [1], thus motivating scientists, practitioners,
    private and public companies to work towards the goal of developing and encouraging
    the use of innovative technologies to support farmers on the ground. According
    to the European Union (EU), the most relevant technologies and techniques to be
    fully exploited are the satellite imagery, the use of agricultural robots, a larger
    use of sensor nodes to collect data, and the potentialities of Unmanned Aerial
    Vehicles (UAVs) for aerial imagery and actuation. Those indications are contained
    into the declaration of cooperation on A smart and sustainable digital future
    for European agriculture and rural areas1 signed on April 2019 by 24 EU countries.
    According to the aforementioned declaration, the first obstacle towards a full
    implementation of SF in rural areas is the lack of connectivity, i.e., digital
    divide. The advent of 5G is promising to improve such a situation in rural and
    low-income areas [2], but scattered coverage must be still taken into account,
    as highlighted in recent surveys in the EU territory [3]. Rural areas remain challenging,
    not being covered by any Next Generation Access network: up to 53% at the end
    of 2017 in EU [3]. Putting this issue aside, a plethora of initiatives can be
    identified towards the objective of the digitisation of agriculture. As an exemplary
    case, Smart AKIS, an EU-funded thematic network promoted by the Agricultural European
    Innovation Partnership (EIP-AGRI) established in 2016, aims to close the gap between
    scientific knowledge and practitioners, in order to promote concrete solutions
    to be implemented. A solution can be defined as anything that makes the farming
    practice more controlled and accurate through ICT, reducing both the costs and
    the environmental impact, while also increasing the production. SF has the potential
    to also improve work safety, contributing to the sustainability of agriculture
    [1], but its socio-economic implications are debated [4]. In this innovative approach
    of farm management, a key component is the use of hardware and software technologies,
    like the deploying of sensor nodes, control systems, robotics, satellites for
    imagery and positioning, data storage and analysis, advisory systems, and terrestrial
    and aerial drones. However, the aim of SF should not be just in industrializing
    agriculture, but in making the whole process more efficient, sustainable, and
    of high quality, while respecting farmers’ needs. SF dates back to the middle
    of the 80’s, but it has been practiced commercially only since the 90’s [5]. However,
    many farmers are still skeptical about the actual advantages it can offer. This
    can be explained by considering the profit and the direct benefits for the farm.
    In fact, it is not straightforward to identify those [6], for instance when considering
    Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) and Operating Expenditures (OPEX) for software, machinery,
    and data. Farmers generally tend to identify SF as a set of tools that benefits
    only large holdings, both in crop and livestock production. This is linked to
    the perception of high costs and complexity of the involved technologies. What
    is lacking from this image is the possibility that innovative technologies might
    not be only large-scale and thus costly, but rather also slow and precise, plus
    small and cheap [7]. Nowadays, SF is rapidly taking advantage of recent technological
    advancements for improving agricultural practices [8], further than business models
    for lowering adoption costs. For instance, rental programs for farming equipment,
    like Trringo in India, make possible farm mechanization processes with affordable
    costs for farmers, also providing support services. Such an initiative can be
    categorised as cooperative farming, potentially increasing the penetration of
    SF in low-income areas. Karnott, a French company, is pushing both web services
    and hardware solutions to transform legacy equipment into SF-ready one. Karnott
    sells a control unit to be installed on agricultural machines, offering several
    services through a battery-powered device, collecting and exchanging real-time
    data, as well as geolocation. Then, collected data can be exploited through on-line
    services, like those provided by api-agro, a secure platform to share data. Available
    data can be accessed and fed to different management systems, thus offering a
    valuable repository for farms. Taranis offers a platform using aerial and satellite
    imagery joint with Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to provide a Decision
    Support System (DSS) for Precision Farming (PF) applications. AgriOpenData provides
    a DSS as well, exploiting blockchain, UAVs, and adding support services on top
    of it. When considering fully autonomous solutions, Iron Ox offers a complete
    robotic solution to grow plants, from seeds to harvest, with a hydroponic system
    able to strongly reduce the water consumption. At last, traceability is experiencing
    a revolution thanks to digital ledgers. Even if it cannot be considered immediately
    within the umbrella of SF, still the origin and the quality of agricultural products
    remains a central issue. Carrefour, a French multinational retailer, is betting
    on blockchain as a solution to provide trustable data to consumers and intermediate
    actors. Blockchain is used by Hectare Agritech in a farm trading platform as well,
    highlighting how innovative paradigms can be adapted to different use cases in
    the agricultural field. The aim of this work is to survey both research initiatives
    and scientific literature on the topic of SF, looking at recent technologies and
    techniques being used or being actively pushed for adoption. In addition, we discuss
    still open challenges hampering such an objective. The rest of this work is structured
    as follows: Section 2 surveys research and innovation projects covering SF activities
    in the EU territory, then the scope of the survey is enlarged by taking into account
    the state of the art in the scientific literature. Section 3 discusses the open
    challenges at today, considering both technical and non-technical factors. Finally,
    Section 4 draws the conclusions and opens to future directions. 2. State of the
    art This section provides two main contributions. The first one is in Section
    2.1, surveying relevant research projects recently funded by the EU in the field
    of SF; the aim is to highlight the increasing attention towards those activities,
    and then to identify the involved technologies. Table 1 provides an overview of
    surveyed R&I projects. Furthermore, Fig. 1 depicts relevant agricultural operations
    as faced by the described research projects, and the technological solutions exploited
    in the latter ones. The second contribution is in Section 2.2, surveying the scientific
    works that propose solutions for the implementation of SF. Table 2 provides an
    overview of surveyed literature, then a keyword analysis is proposed in Fig. 2.

    the surveyed literature: the 4 categories, as proposed in Table 2, can be read
    internally, and each keyword is weighted (circle radius) in the cluster it belongs
    to. 2.1. EU research projects In last years, the EU has been actively undertaking
    R&I activities laying the ground for the digitisation of agriculture by exploiting
    data-empowered strategies; strategic interventions have been funded to support
    the uptake of digital technologies, to develop new digital solutions and to sustain
    the crucial assessment of the socio-economic impacts of digitisation. In Table
    1, 30 recent EU projects closely related to SF are presented: the first 21 projects,
    spanning from 2015 to 2019, propose, develop, and test the use of digital technologies
    in this field; the 9 projects in the last rows, spanning from 2012 to 2019, have
    the complementary objective of strengthen or evaluate the use of ICT in agriculture,
    for instance through challenge-based strategies, or by setting up marketplaces
    to browse existing solutions ready for use. Most projects jointly exploit multiple
    techniques and technologies; here, we highlight only the most prominent ones.
    2.1.1. Cloud/edge-based systems Cloud platforms are mainly exploited in projects
    that are related to monitoring activities, like growth of plants, water availability,
    soil moisture maps, and so on. There is a clear dominance of cloud solutions with
    respect to those based on edge solutions, because the former is a more established
    option than the latter. The AgriCloud P2 project proposed a cloud-based PF management
    system for a sustainable and intensive agriculture to secure long-term food supply
    in Europe. The APMAV project consists of an intuitive solution for agricultural
    management based on UAV technology and an intelligent cloud-based platform that
    provides farmers valuable, actionable and real-time recommendations for driving
    down costs and improving crop performance. The Flourish project leverages UAVs
    as well, aiming at surveying a field from the air, then at performing a targeted
    intervention on the ground with an Unmanned Terrestrial Vehicle (UTV). The idea
    is to provide a DSS requiring minimal user intervention to target PF applications.
    The SWAMP project develops Internet of Things (IoT)-based methods and approaches
    for smart water management in the precision irrigation domain, in order to utilize
    water more efficiently and effectively, avoiding both under- and over-irrigation.
    The AfriCultuReS project, beyond the use of cloud-based technology, also exploits
    the data collected from different sources (e.g. service providers, weather services)
    to develop an integrated agricultural monitoring and early warning system, based
    on remote sensing, to support decision making. The DataBio project makes intensive
    use of big data techniques related to the raw material production from agriculture,
    forestry, fishery and aquaculture for the production of food, energy, and biomaterials
    in a sustainable way, by means of a software platform integrating big data and
    Earth Observation (EO) methods. Data-driven activities are also proposed in the
    just started Dragon project, whose main efforts are directed towards skill transfers
    to ease PF adoption. Large heterogeneous data sources are considered and analysed
    to offer agricultural knowledge and information systems by ambitiously leveraging
    several techniques. The BigDataGrapes project makes use of big data techniques
    in the context of viticulture, supporting decisions by exploiting real-time analysis
    of large, diverse and multimodal data sources. It has been exploiting the use
    of UAVs as well in vineyards. Last but not least, the IoF2020 project is one of
    the most comprehensive projects from the point of view of SF digital technologies:
    in particular, this project accelerates the adoption of IoT, in order to secure
    sufficient, safe and healthy food and at strengthening competitiveness of farming
    and food chains in Europe. A large scale pilot programme has been started in IoF2020
    to develop and test specific technological solutions in the following sectors:
    arable, dairy, fruits, vegetables, and meat. 2.1.2. Unmanned vehicles The use
    of unmanned vehicles is another trend of great interest. Beyond the aforementioned
    Flourish, APMAV, BigDataGrapes, and Dragon projects, the PANTHEON project, by
    taking advantage of the technological advancements in the fields of robotics,
    remote sensing and big data management, aims at designing an integrated system
    where heterogeneous unmanned robotic components (terrestrial and aerial robots)
    move within the orchards to collect data and perform common farming operations.
    The SWEEPER project has proposed a robotic system to harvest sweet peppers in
    greenhouses, leveraging on machine vision techniques to acquire both colour and
    distance information, and then storing collected peppers in an on-board container.
    Another robotic platform has been developed in the ROMI project to assist in weed
    reduction and crop monitoring, reducing manual labour. Land robots also acquire
    detailed information on sample plants, and an UAV assists by providing information
    at crop level. The GreenPatrol-Robot project designed and built a satellite-guided
    autonomous robot for pest control in greenhouses. It exploits Galileo satellite
    services to navigate, achieving good positioning accuracy inside greenhouses.
    The AFarCloud project aims at the agricultural productivity increase via PF techniques.
    The proposed solution is a distributed platform for autonomous farming robots
    that allows the integration and real-time cooperation of agricultural systems
    to increase efficiency, productivity, and food quality. This platform is integrated
    with a Farm Management System (FMS) to support monitoring and decision-making
    solutions based on real-time data mining techniques. The RUC-APS project is centered
    on management approaches aiming at enhancing SF solutions in agriculture systems,
    applying operational research to optimise farm production. 2.1.3. Satellite-based
    activities Several projects are mainly based on improving the information derived
    from satellite optical data. The AGRORADAR project aims at delivering innovative
    algorithms and data models that can process Copernicus EO Syntethic Aperture Radar
    (SAR) data to achieve precise and detailed information. The AUDITOR project develops
    an improved Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) augmentation system for
    services in PF applications. The project enables cost-effective PF services to
    farmers, like recommendations regarding site-specific application of water, fertilizer
    and pesticides. The WATER4AGRI project combines microwave data obtained from different
    satellites to provide datasets for retrieving key information about water availability
    for crops at field level. The SENSAGRI project combines optical and radar measurements
    to develop three prototype services for near real-time operations: surface soil
    moisture, green and brown Leaf Area Index (LAI), and crop type mapping. The MISTRALE
    project provides soil moisture maps to decision makers in water management using
    GNSS reflectometry (GNSS-R) via satellites and UAVs. The project has developed
    a prototype sensor embedded on a dedicated software platform. The APOLLO project
    brings PF closer to farmers through affordable information services, making extensive
    use of free and open EO data. The proposed services help farmers to make better
    decisions by monitoring the growth and health of crops, providing advice on when
    to irrigate and till their fields, and estimating the size of their harvest. The
    services are designed to be always available thanks to a web platform and a mobile
    application. 2.1.4. Mitigating digital divide Other research projects are mainly
    focused on bringing the advantages of SF to farmers in a way compatible with their
    needs and digital skills, thus reducing digital divide. The SMART-AKIS initiative
    sets up a self-sustainable thematic network on SF technologies designed for the
    effective exchange of knowledge among research, industry, and the farming community,
    disseminating direct applicable research and commercial solutions, and capturing
    grassroots level needs and innovative ideas. The 4D4F project (Data Driven Dairy
    Decision For Farmers) focuses on the benefits provided by sensors in monitoring
    animals and environment, supporting informed decisions. The project hosts a large
    repository of ICT solutions freely browseable by farmers. The SmartAgriHubs project
    brings together 164 partners in the European agri-food sector, carrying out 28
    flagship innovation experiments for digitisation in five agri-food sectors: arable
    farming, livestock, vegetable, fruits, and aquaculture. The overall goal of ICT-AGRI-2
    is to strengthen the research within the area of PF and to develop a common research
    agenda concerning ICT and robotics in agriculture in Europe. Its main objectives
    are: mapping and analysis of existing research and future needs; development of
    instruments and procedures for transnational funding activities; development of
    strategic research agenda and programmes; and establishment of international collaborations
    and networks. Other projects, like Nefertiti, Euraknos, and Desira are setting
    up thematic networks with the objective of promote networking activities, data
    sharing and knowledge exchange. They leverage the vast set of already available
    ICT tools to promote their use in SF contexts and to foster their adaption to
    practitioners’ needs. The DESIRA project, started at June 2019, intends to collect
    practitioners’ needs through 20 national living labs in EU and then to design
    ICT use cases to meet those demands in a Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI)
    fashion. The Fairshare project has data collecting and sharing as foremost objectives,
    in order to build a network able to reduce the agricultural digital divide. Finally,
    FarmingBySatellite is an initiative to promote the use of Galileo as GNSS and
    EO services. It launches a biyearly challenge to identify promising ideas using
    satellite technologies for SF purposes. 2.1.5. Considerations Summing up, some
    considerations can be made: monitoring fields and crops is quite diffused at today,
    leveraging local and remote sensing solutions, i.e., in-field sensors, UAVs, up
    to satellites. Another major challenge is the optimisation of water use. Unmanned
    vehicles enable semi- and full-autonomous scenarios, currently representing a
    major objective for both research institutes and private companies. Anyway, almost
    all surveyed projects aim at providing DSSs instead of autonomous solutions; in
    fact, there is still wide scepticism on them by practitioners as viable alternatives
    to human decisions. To feed DSSs, data analysis techniques are used, also supporting
    automatic actions based on feedback, and farmers’ decisions. Machine learning
    techniques are typically exploited for dedicated applications in the projects
    we considered, such as prediction and estimation of farming parameters to optimise
    livestock production or crop monitoring. 2.2. Scientific literature SF represents
    the evolution of agriculture driven by ICT technologies. ICT provides tools, methods,
    and techniques with the potential to improve both the modeling and the practice
    in this sector. SF is intrinsically tied to large-scale heterogeneous sensing
    [9], involving different hardware, algorithms, and protocols, thus too focused
    approaches have gained little traction at now. In what follows, we survey a very
    recent and exemplary subset of the scientific literature on such a topic, then
    schematised in Table 2. To further highlight what is currently trending in recent
    scientific literature, we show the most used keywords in Fig. 2, according to
    the four thematic clusters we define in Table 2. Each keyword is presented weighted
    in its cluster according to the number of occurrences. Finally, Table 3 maps typical
    application scenarios and data types to commonly used sensing solutions [10,11].

    techniques and management systems SF makes large use of sensor nodes to collect
    data on the environment and the phenomenon under observation. For instance, in
    the case of agriculture, soil sensors, placed at different depths, complement
    data collected from EO satellites, providing enriched information. More generally,
    indoor and outdoor Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), both mobile and fixed, are
    used to collect heterogeneous data [14] for evaluating different indexes, such
    as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the excess green index,
    the LAI, and so on. Given the fundamental role played by data and data sources
    in this context [12], the historical evolution of sensing for PF in Ref. [5] offers
    a valuable perspective. At the beginning, three methodological approaches were
    considered: the first two ones, namely farming by soil and site-specific crop
    management, were contrasting because the former promoted soil mapping, while the
    latter promoted homogeneous actions in sub-units of farm fields, i.e., a punctual
    approach versus a clustered one. The third approach, namely proximal soil sensing,
    came later, consisting in continuous real-time sensing by sensors mounted on tractors.
    It can be considered the father of the PF approaches in use nowadays. Thanks to
    satellites, proximal soil sensing evolved into remote soil sensing, introducing
    spectral analyses. To allow farm managers to exploit all those heterogeneous data
    sources, increasing complex software platforms were introduced to take advantage
    of raw data and of subsequent elaboration: they are referred to as FMIS [13].
    2.2.2. Unmanned vehicles Real-time stream processing, analysis, and reasoning
    are key concepts towards automation in the agricultural field [22], i.e., towards
    a larger use of robots that can adapt to space- and time-varying conditions with
    minimal delay. Robots can perform very precise operations, and can operate in
    fleets, as proposed in Ref. [23], which considers both UTVs and UAVs. Moving systems
    rely on GNSS techniques for precise positioning, and PF applications need large
    accuracy. Several commercial systems integrate a GNSS receiver and use one or
    more fixed Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) reference base stations [26] for providing
    accuracy up to centimeters. Further than precise positioning, robots depend on
    machine-vision systems to navigate the environment [25]; according to the technology
    and the scenario under consideration, specific spectral signatures are of interest,
    as for instance hyperspectral imagery in both local and remote sensing. Commercial
    devices, to be used on board, already capture both RGB and Near Infrared Imagery
    (NIR) bands, and stereovision systems are used for 3D maps [25]. Further than
    terrestrial vehicles, aerial ones have been revolutionising the practices in this
    sector. PF is taking large advantage of UAVs, with several commercial systems
    able to fly at different speeds and altitudes [24], ranging from fixed to rotary
    wing machines. UAVs are used for monitoring scenarios, further than pesticide
    spraying, which is a key application for PF [18]. Heavy and large UAVs can be
    used for such a purpose in the case of large fields, jointly with multispectral
    techniques to generate NDVI maps to be used for spraying pesticides and fertilizers
    where needed. Such a potential has been subject to increasing attention in the
    last years. For instance, UAVs can be used to assess if an area has been subject
    to plowing, and the plowing depths. The authors in Ref. [15] consider the use
    of UAVs for such a purpose as an alternative to the use of satellites. In fact,
    according to the authors, even high-resolution satellites cannot classify the
    roughness of the terrain, thus motivating the use of UAVs. A RGB camera has been
    used for data collection and a visual assessment, and collected georeferenced
    data are analysed to assess the plowing depths. RGB and NIR are collected by means
    of an UAV also in Ref. [16], with the aim of classifying plants and weeds. The
    proposed system makes use of the Excess Green Index (ExG) [16] in the case of
    RGB-only; if NIR is exploited as well, NDVI can be estimated and used because
    of the richer information it provides. By combining these results with geometric
    features, sugar beets can be recognised even in the case of overlapping plants.
    NDVI has been used in viticulture for precision applications [21] as well: in
    fact, using an UAV to collect detailed images in a vineyard, plant rows can be
    discriminated from inter-rows, identifying missing plants with good precision.
    UAVs can be seen as part of a WSN, acting as mobile nodes [17], thus the analytical
    characterisation of the channel model between a moving UAV and fixed terrestrial
    nodes becomes of interest [20]. Low-power 802.15.4-based solutions have been investigated
    in rural contexts, using UAVs as data mules [19]. 2.2.3. IoT platforms As aforementioned
    in Section 1, Internet connectivity is a key requirement for SF. In fact, its
    availability allows IoT-based scenarios to emerge [33], increasing the degree
    of remote control and automation. This is well supported by IoT features, such
    as interoperability and easiness of integration [36]. Anyway, in rural contexts,
    terrestrial connectivity may be lacking. Because of this, aerospace solutions
    for connectivity are a viable option [8]. Looking at the literature, reference
    [30] proposes an IoT platform for PF based on FIWARE.2 It considers the case of
    a greenhouse, where Internet connectivity is likely available, thus opening to
    data exchanges via protocol stacks relying on common IoT protocols, like CoAP
    and MQTT. In greenhouses, the main objectives are typically climate control and
    soil monitoring. The Agricolus software platform, which is a FIWARE-based DSS
    for tobacco crops, is described in Ref. [29], designed to collect soil data via
    802.15.4-based WSNs. The FIWARE middleware is a software enabler in very different
    scenarios [13,29]. Along to climate control systems, irrigation systems have been
    proposed to optimise water use. In Ref. [28], FIWARE cloud components are integrated
    in a PF application to reduce water use. In Ref. [31], tomatoes in a greenhouse
    are monitored, and the authors propose an analytical framework to assess the performance
    of different tested configurations by relying on plant transpiration. The works
    in Refs. [27,32] consider the use of low-cost and general purpose sensor nodes,
    built upon the Arduino platform and upon MICAz Motes, respectively, as information
    sources in greenhouses. Being able to deploy low-cost and easily replaceable sensor
    nodes is a priority for a larger adoption of SF techniques. A core demand is related
    to power consumption: battery-powered devices lasting several years, as for instance
    ZigBee ones in Ref. [27], are fundamental in farm deployments. Apart from FIWARE,
    a plethora of different platforms can be identified as enablers for SF [34]. Those
    platforms aggregate heterogeneous data, then analysed and interpreted in order
    to provide additional value. Here, semantic analyses have been proposed as well,
    like for instance the valuable work in Ref. [35]. The Agri-IoT architecture, a
    layered and complex framework, provides additional value to DSSs because it further
    facilitates informed and accurate decisions thanks to semantic web and real-time
    reasoning. 2.2.4. Decision Support Systems DSSs are one of the most used solutions
    for SF because they provide support to farmers, offering a point of access to
    useful information, according to the aim of the system, and suggesting a plausible
    course of action in a given context. Aims can be very different: minimising the
    impact of diseases in tomatoes by applying automatic climate control [37]; ‘time-to-sow’
    alerts, and cattle monitoring [38]; anticipating potential crop dysfunctions in
    a proactive way [39]; pest control [40]; selecting appropriate alternative crops
    in a given area [41]. Those are just few examples of what can be offered by recent
    developments of DSSs in the agricultural sector. 2.2.5. Considerations Some considerations
    can be made also here: for instance, looking at Fig. 2, it is visible how data
    is a relevant keyword for all clusters. This is a key topic in the context of
    SF, thus deepened in Section 3. A notable exception is visible in the cluster
    Unmanned Vehicles, in which system outnumbers data: this can be explained by taking
    into account that unmanned vehicles are typically considered in an autonomous
    scenario, i.e., within a system composed of several interacting parts. The keywords
    pertaining to the cluster Unmanned Vehicles take the most part of Fig. 2, graphically
    highlighting the technological complexity of designed systems, and the very large
    number of operations that can be performed by those. Finally, what in Fig. 1 can
    be put in relation with what presented in Fig. 2: as an example, in the former
    monitoring operations are practically ubiquitous, and this is confirmed by the
    large number of occurrences of keywords like thing (as in smart thing or IoT)
    and sensor in the latter. 3. Open challenges This section briefly discusses the
    open challenges hampering a larger adoption of SF, summarised in Fig. 3 as well.
    Several technologies pushing for a larger adoption of SF practices have already
    been cited within this work, such as fully autonomous flight control, early identification
    of plant diseases, and reliable virtual fences [1], as well as more general ones,
    as AI, robotics, high performance computing, IoT, and 5G, which are reported within
    the EU declaration cited in Section 1. AI probably represents the largest challenge
    at now and, at the same time, opportunity in several sectors, including the agricultural
    one. The EU is largely investing on it because convinced it will be the upcoming
    disruptive game changer. In fact, the AI4EU initiative, started at the beginning
    of 2019, aims at the transformation of AI into a compelling solution in several
    application scenarios. Download : Download full-size image Figure 3. Overview
    of open challenges in the SF field: technical challenges (on the right) are discussed
    in Section 3.1, non-technical challenges (on the left) are discussed in Section
    3.2. 3.1. Technical challenges Looking at sensor nodes and sensor networks, we
    refer to the valuable works in Refs. [14,42], which survey the use of fixed and
    mobile solutions. According to the authors, advances are needed to further lower
    costs and to design specific solutions for the agricultural context, which requires
    solutions able to resist to difficult conditions (e.g., specific soil properties,
    exposition to high/low temperature, water resistance, fine dusts, and so on).
    Further than costs, solutions are needed toward larger energy efficiency, including
    energy harvesting techniques, and reliability in data collection and transmission,
    in order to minimize the need of maintenance for the deployed solutions. Specific
    issues of the agricultural domain need targeted answers, in particular the deployment
    strategies, to be designed according to fields segmentation and to farmers’ requirements.
    One of the main drivers of the diffusion of WSN in agriculture has been IoT: it
    has marked the transition from closed-source systems and disconnected software
    solutions towards connected systems built upon interoperable solutions. Those
    characteristics are favorable to cost reduction and to easiness of integration.
    Challenges here are overall related to network capabilities, data security, and
    data privacy [33]. Data is one of the most critical topic in the agricultural
    sector. Data ownership, protection, and security are perceived as not sufficiently
    close to farmers’ needs, thus becoming threats to be mitigated, if not completely
    avoided. In more words, nowadays, digital solutions for SF are under-utilised
    because practitioners fear data misuse and the loss of control over their business.
    Data protection must be enhanced to transform into a transparent operation, keeping
    in mind that agriculture is typically a private business activity (i.e., a not
    transparent activity), and data transfers to external systems (e.g. cloud) must
    be controllable and well described to increase acceptance. An option towards larger
    acceptance comes from the possibility for farmers to benefit from business with
    their data, and to benefit from public and official data released in an open fashion.
    On this, the valuable work of the EU with the Galileo services is a notable example
    of good practice, collecting and releasing data through application programming
    interfaces [43]. Further from data, open and used standards for data handling
    is compelling to move towards horizontal solutions instead of vertical ones [44].
    Large IoT platforms generate huge amounts of data to be analysed, thus calling
    for data analytic techniques able to extract meaningful information. Nowadays,
    big data immediately come to mind [45] as a set of strategies towards this objective,
    but it must be noted that its application to agriculture is recent. Generally
    speaking, the big data paradigm goes in an opposite direction with respect to
    acquiring more control over own data by farmers. To counteract that, the possibility
    for farmers to economically gain from sharing and accessing large volumes of data
    works as an incentive [46]. In Ref. [47], the authors underline the difficulties
    in discovering and combining large heterogeneous datasets in the agro-environmental
    field, often complicated by lacking of metadata. Furthermore, the need for semantic
    analyses and interoperability is highlighted in Ref. [47]. Natural language processing
    and machine learning techniques play a role here, facilitated by existing initiatives
    for building and maintaining open large repositories for training purposes, like
    CINERGI by Earthcube. Once meaningful information is available thanks to raw data
    sources and to analytics techniques, decision making is performed. This is where
    machine learning techniques and, more generally, AI can be fully exploited toward
    autonomous systems. To this aim, a fundamental challenge is moving intelligence
    from cloud platforms to closer computation platforms, such as edge solutions,
    handling and processing data close to the source, thus reducing delays. Multi-Access
    Edge Computing (MEC), jointly with 5G, is expected to play a role here. In the
    case of agricultural autonomous systems, real-time constraints are more easily
    satisfied by edge solutions than remote centralised systems. According to Ref.
    [48], in order to build sustainable infrastructure, the several emerging architecture
    paradigms (with different degrees of centralised and distributed entities) must
    comply to open standards for both easiness of implementation and cost reduction.
    Environmental monitoring and real-time agricultural data analytics and control
    can benefit from those paradigms, for instance by providing localized information
    about pollution and pests in the vicinity of edge servers [49]. 3.2. Socio-economic
    and other non-technical challenges This section discusses non-technical issues
    still holding back a larger diffusion of SF, at least in the EU. In fact, uptake
    in EU is rather low if compared to what expected [50]. Incentives and policies
    play a large role, considering national and EU rules, economical and skills perspectives.
    In Ref. [50], the authors show how financial and government incentives are the
    most influential solution, followed by training and other non-financial support.
    Farmers’ concerns are related to the time to recover the investment, and to the
    difficulties in evaluating the advantages; small farms have almost no adoption
    at all, also because the machinery has no support for more advanced technology.
    Sole farmers show a large interest in SF tools, which may come as unexpected,
    because it reduces exposure to occupational accidents and injuries; anyway, those
    barriers still hold back its use [51]. Because of those reasons, initiatives like
    those presented in Section 1 have a significant socio-economic value: cooperative
    farming with support services for a better handling of costs and needed investments;
    hardware solutions to transform legacy equipment into SF-ready machinery to avoid
    too high initial costs and to have time to familiarise with new technology; secure
    and open platforms for sharing data and getting back useful information, helping
    in assessing potential advantages. Research activities aiming at reducing the
    agricultural digital divide have an impact as well, helping farmers with new ICT-based
    tools in their daily work; on the other hand, different strategies in designing
    innovative ICT tools must be considered, like using natural language [52] to explicitly
    take into account potentially low-literate speakers. Nowadays, the right to access
    and use the collected data is at the center of the discussion: COPA-COGECA, an
    European farming representative organisation, in cooperation with CEMA, the European
    agricultural machinery association, has recently released a code of conduct to
    grant the data originator (i.e., the farmer) a leading role in controlling the
    access to and the use of data.3 The concerns on data use and access have been
    explored also in Ref. [4], highlighting existing scepticism by Australian farmers
    and divergence of expectations between involved actors. On the one hand, marketers
    and traders expect that big data techniques increase the reliability of predictions
    in the market dynamics; on the other hand, farmers are convinced that power asymmetries
    will increase, thus acting as a brake. Similar considerations are in Ref. [53],
    when looking to Ireland: whilst recognizing that SF is a real opportunity for
    the farming context, potential challenges and risks should be carefully considered
    to anticipate and reduce the gap among winners and losers. 4. Conclusions and
    future directions In this work, we surveyed the most relevant research activities
    aiming at improving and encouraging the adoption of SF techniques in agricultural
    contexts. Large efforts are currently poured to boost ICT use, at least in the
    EU, where this analysis is focused. On the one hand, the already established use
    of sensor nodes and heterogeneous data sources, as well as simple analytic techniques,
    is pushing DSSs in the farms; on the other hand, a growing need is there for ever
    advancing technology and open standards to consolidate existing scenarios in an
    interoperable and low-cost manner, as well as programmes to help ICT diffusion
    in areas suffering from digital divide. In the future, technology will have a
    growing role in agriculture [6]. Several operations will be automatised, from
    planting to harvesting, thanks to increased robotisation, both terrestrial and
    aerial one. Soil information will be readily available, thus allowing for e.g.
    a finer control of pests and pesticides, combining local information with other
    data sources, like weather and pollution data. In the end, an increase in production
    is expected, joint with a reduction in chemicals today in use, thus reducing pressure
    on soil. SF has the potential for a rapid and efficient growth in coming years,
    supported by policies that can fuel both R&D efforts and farmers’ adoption through
    investments. Anyway, the main barriers at today, i.e., vertical solutions, reduced
    digital skills and high costs for farmers, poor telecommunication infrastructures,
    and concerns on data ownership and use must be carefully addressed by technical
    and non-technical actors to facilitate SF adoption. Declaration of Competing Interest

    Keywords Metrics Abstract: Advances in technology are not only changing the world
    around us but also driving the wireless industry to develop the next generation
    of network technology. There is a lot of buzz building over the advent of 5G that
    will facilitate the entire planet through continuous and ubiquitous communication
    connecting anybody to anything, anywhere, anytime, and anyhow regardless of the
    device, service, network, or geographical existence. 5G will also prove to be
    a paradigm shift including high carrier frequencies with massive bandwidths, having
    a large number of antennas, and with an extreme base station and device densities.
    In this paper, we investigate the potential beneficiaries of 5G and identify the
    use-cases, where 5G can make an impact. In particular, we consider three main
    use-cases: vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, drones, and healthcare.
    We explore and highlight the problems and deficiencies of current cellular technologies
    with respect to these use-cases and identify how 5G will overcome those deficiencies.
    We also identified the open research problems and provide possible future directions
    to cope with those issues. Topic: Roadmap to 5G: Rising to the Challenge An overview
    of V2X, Drones and Healthcare Use-cases with respect to 5G. Published in: IEEE

    Agency: SECTION I. Introduction Advances in technology are not only changing the
    world around us but also driving the wireless industry to develop the next generation
    of network technology. Over the last 25 years, mobile technologies such as 1st,
    2nd, 3rd and 4th generation have focused on improving the speed and efficiency
    of wireless networks, but still there are some distinct application areas where
    current wireless networks are struggling to deliver. These areas include V2X communication
    (and particularly Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I)
    communication), wireless healthcare services, utility applications and industrial
    automation, consumer, virtual and augmented reality services, and primary broadband
    access services etc. [1], [2]. It is expected that the new technologies (5G) will
    investigate the issues within the aforementioned areas and will also address the
    performance criteria for low latency, high speed, enhanced reliability, peak throughput
    per connection, system spectral efficiency, connection and capacity density, and
    low power consumption [3], [4]. It is anticipated that 5G will be the main developmental
    technology that will lead to a step-change in the capability of mobile networks
    particularly around new radio access technology, higher frequencies usage, network
    re-architecting, antenna improvements (beam forming and massive Multiple-Input
    Multiple-Output (MIMO)), ultra-low-latency, and ultra-high reliability. A report
    published by Nokia Communication [5] claims that from 2020 to 2030 there will
    be an increase of 10K times more traffic that needs to be carried out through
    mobile broadband technologies. Such a huge volume of data traffic will lead to
    the design of 5G architectures in a way that will enable deployment in a new and
    higher frequencies band. Some other factors such as ultra-low latency (less than
    one millisecond), reduced power consumption and increased battery life in terms
    of smartphones, tablets and laptops will also be considered in the design of 5G
    architecture. An overview of the key requirements for 5G is summarized in Figure
    1. Based on these requirements, we propose taxonomy of future potential 5G use-cases
    as: (i) Ultra-high reliable use-cases, (ii) Ultra-low latency use-cases and (iii)
    Ultra-reliable and low-latency use-cases. In terms of reliability, we identify
    disaster management using drones, and surveillance operations; in terms of low-latency,
    we explore the automotive industry (with a focus on assisted and autonomous driving),
    augmented/virtual reality, serious gaming, and smart grids; while in terms of
    both reliability and low-latency use-cases, we discuss healthcare and wearables,
    and industry automation. FIGURE 1. Key requirements for 5G communication. Show
    All The main contribution of this survey is to provide the reader with state-of-the-art
    technological trends in terms of 5G communication and highlight the limitations
    and problems of existing cellular technologies. We consider three main future
    use-cases of 5G communication: V2X communication, drones, and healthcare. In terms
    of V2X communication, we present an exhaustive review of the up-to-date research
    progress with respect to V2V, Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P), V2I, and Intra-Vehicle
    (IV) communication along with their key application areas. We also identify the
    key limitations of existing technologies in all of these sub-use-cases of V2X
    communication. Similarly, in terms of drones, first we provide an overview of
    single Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) deployment, multiple UAV deployment and collision
    avoidance. Then we present some of the key application areas of drones for critical
    infrastructure development using 5G communication. A comparative analysis of control
    latency in terms of 4G and 5G communication is also presented to inform the reader
    of the latest trends. Finally, in terms of healthcare, we mainly consider online
    consultation, online health monitoring, remote diagnosis of time-critical medical
    events and mobile robotic surgeries. Table 1 provides a list of the acronyms and
    their corresponding definitions that have been used throughout the paper. TABLE
    1 Acronym List The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II provides
    a literature review of the existing work. Section III investigates V2X communication,
    Section IV considers drone applications, Section V addresses the healthcare use-case,
    Section VI provide an overview of the open research challenges and future directions,
    while Section VII draws the conclusions. SECTION II. Related Work Masini et al.
    [6] provide an overview of economic motivations, requirements, and enabling technologies
    along with the important international rules and regulations for short-range V2V-based
    vehicular networks and on-board vehicles connectivity respectively. The authors
    mainly concentrated on four different aspects to differentiate their work from
    others in the same area i.e. short-range V2V-based applications, design choices
    and factors for wireless enabling technologies, economic motivations for on-board
    wireless technologies and mandatory international rules for on-board connectivity.
    Similarly, Boban et al. [7] analyzed the requirements and use-cases in terms of
    5G V2X and identified the gaps of the existing communication technologies. The
    authors also provide guidelines on how the existing and 5G technologies will try
    to overcome those gaps. In terms of drone communication, Shakhatreh et al. [8]
    present a survey on the UAV challenges including charging, collision & swarming,
    and network & security with respect to civil applications. The authors highlighted
    different open issues and provide the possible ways of how these issues can be
    approached. Moreover, Li et al. [9] provide an overview of 5G technologies that
    can be incorporated in UAV communication. 5G and UAV integrated architectures
    for space-air-ground scenario were presented and a variety of open research challenges
    were identified. Based on this integration, the authors also provide a state of
    the art overview of the research progress at different layers (physical layer,
    network layer etc.). Furthermore, with respect to healthcare use-case, West [10]
    provides an overview of how 5G differs from earlier generations and highlights
    how 5G will make an impact in healthcare applications. The author investigated
    how 5G will enable new systems of care delivery, and how the application areas
    like imaging, diagnostics, and treatment can be improved through 5G to provide
    quality healthcare facilities to the people. Also, Latif et al. [11] presented
    how 5G and other technologies (Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence
    (AI), and big data) will revolutionize healthcare system and provide an overview
    of how Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can be integrated with healthcare systems
    to detect the anomalies and to ensure that no medical problems has occurred. The
    authors also investigated how remote consultation and remote surgery can be enabled
    through telemedicine and e-health. All of the above and many other surveys discuss
    the overall technological trends and their limitations in terms of V2X, drones
    and healthcare, but none particularly concentrates on limitations of existing
    cellular technologies. Also, in many surveys only a single use-case is discussed
    along with their limitations and future directions, but no survey considered more
    than one use-cases in the same paper. The main purpose of this work is to identify
    limitations of the existing cellular technologies and to provide a possible solution
    for each of these limitations in terms of V2X, drone communication and healthcare.
    Similarly, we consider three main use-cases of 5G communication instead of just
    one use-case. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to provide a
    comprehensive survey on three main use-cases of 5G in order to identify the problems
    of current technologies and to suggest the possible solutions based on 5G communication.
    SECTION III. Vehicle-To-Everything (V2X) Communication According to a report published
    by the U.S. Department of Transportation and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
    in [12], 37,461 people were killed in motor vehicle crashes in 2016, an increase
    of 5.6% and 14.4% when compared to 2015 and 2014 respectively. Similarly, according
    to the UK Department for Transport [13], a total of 27,130 people were severely
    injured in road accidents out of which 1,710 lost their lives. On the other hand,
    traffic congestion is investigated by Texas A&M Transportation Institute in a
    report published in [14], and according to their investigation, the total delay
    time will increase to 8.3 billion hours by 2020 resulting a congestion cost of
    almost 192 billion U.S. Dollars. To address these issues, new solutions with high
    reliability and low latency are required that can use the currently available
    resources in an efficient way in order to save lives, reduce congestion and lessen
    the negative impact of transportation on the environment. V2X communication mainly
    refers to the set of standards and technologies that will enable the vehicles
    to interact with the current infrastructure including roads and road users. An
    overall architecture of V2X communication based on 5G technologies is shown in
    Figure 2. These will potentially be based on tested networking protocols and technologies
    rather than relying exclusively on the hardware [15], [16]. Boban et al. [7] proposed
    an architecture for V2X communication based on future 5G technologies. The authors
    claim that the proposed architecture can lead to an accident-free connected automated
    driving and can fulfill the requirements for all V2X use case categories. In the
    following sub-sections, we will elaborate different cases of V2X communication
    with respect to challenges faced in 4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE) and will address
    the absolute solutions enabled by 5G technologies. FIGURE 2. V2X communication
    infrastructure using different technologies. Show All A. Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V)
    Communication Driverless and autonomous cars have increased in popularity because
    of their increased applicability for commercial and emergency services. In order
    to fulfill such services, connected and autonomous cars/vehicles require continuous
    access to sensory data from which the cars can perform advanced trajectory planning
    and complex high-speed maneuvers [17]. For short-term trajectory decisions, the
    car can use on-board sensor information, but for long-term decisions, the car
    needs data and information from vehicles in near proximity. Hence, the exchange
    of sensor data is an important factor that requires a reliable connection between
    vehicles subject to strict quality-of-service (QoS) constraints [18], [19]. According
    to Lu et al. [20], connected vehicles are wireless connectivity-enabled vehicles
    that can communicate with each other and with the infrastructure, establishing
    interactions between vehicle-to-sensor on-board, vehicle-to-vehicle, vehicle-to-road
    infrastructure, and vehicle-to-internet. Based on these interactions, the vehicles
    can take safe dynamic decisions, can enhance their situational awareness, and
    can provide an information-rich and safer environment to other motorists and/or
    pedestrians. Mavromatis et al. [17] propose a multi-link association scheme for
    millimeter wave (mmWave) V2V communication in order to better utilize the channel
    and to prioritize sharing the sensory data for emergency connected and autonomous
    vehicles (e-CAVs). By using the same method, the authors also address the issue
    of obstacle avoidance maneuvers and advance trajectory planning in terms of e-CAVs
    as compared to regular CAVs (r-CAVs). Also, the Stable Fixtures (SF) matching
    game technique is proposed to formulate a more comprehensive many-to-many link
    association scheme establishing bidirectional links based on unique characteristics
    of each connected vehicles. The SF problem originates from a practical situation,
    where players play against each other in a chess tournament in order to construct
    a set of fixtures having different matches. Each match has two players, and a
    player can be involved in more than one match while fulfilling the condition that
    he/she cannot exceed their stable capacity [21]. Similarly, Chen et al. [22] propose
    rough set theory to formulate the lane-changing rules to enhance the decision-making
    process of autonomous vehicles in a complex urban environment, to reduce the influence
    of week interdependency data and to extract the driver’s decision-making rules.
    The system was designed over a virtual urban traffic environment using Prescan
    simulation software developed for advanced driver assistant systems and intelligent
    vehicle systems [23]. A general overview of the car-changing process is shown
    in Figure 3, where the green car (Car1) is the subject Car that wants to change
    lane, while Car2 and Car3 are the interfering cars. Based on simulation results,
    the authors concluded that the Car1 driver’s decision-making behavior during the
    lane-changing process is subject to the relative distance between the subject
    car and the interfering Car3, and the relative velocity between the subject Car
    and the leading Car2. FIGURE 3. Lane-changing process. Show All Some of the key
    application areas of V2V communication are discussed as follows: V2V communication
    enhances driving safety and traffic efficiency along with information or entertainment
    provision to drivers in a number of use-cases such as traffic safety, traffic
    efficiency, infotainment and payments etc. In terms of traffic safety, V2V communication
    disseminates warning messages on several occasions e.g. entering intersections
    or departing highways, hazardous locations such as reporting accidents ahead,
    and obstacle discovery, forward collision and pre-cash warnings, and favoring
    police cars, fire fighter vehicles, and ambulances [24], [25]. Similarly, in terms
    of traffic efficiency, V2V communication enhances the route guidance and navigation
    system, automating traffic intersection control, optimizing the green light speed,
    and providing information about variable speed limits. This will help to reduce
    traffic congestion and will lead to reduce the energy consumption [24], [26].
    Moreover, infotainment and payment services such as on-board internet access,
    toll collection and parking payment etc. provide comfort services to the vehicle
    owner and also avoid congestion caused by toll collection. B. Vehicle-to-Pedestrian
    (V2P) Communication V2P is one of the most important applications of vehicular
    networks providing safety to pedestrians through wireless communication. Bagheri
    et al. [27] addressed the issue of V2P communication in order to improve the safety
    of pedestrians. The authors proposed a method based on the existing infrastructure
    that enables the development of V2P road safety applications. On pedestrian side,
    3G and LTE were utilized as cellular technologies to provide connectivity to the
    individual’s smartphone, while on vehicular side, an on-board SIM card was used
    for same purpose. In case of any issue with on-board SIM, driver’s smartphone
    was considered as an alternative for connectivity purposes. The proposed adaptive
    multi-level approach was designed based on mobile cloud computing to compute and
    process all the data. Road users including vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists
    send updated messages containing speed, location and direction information to
    the cloud-based server. Two types of safety messages were identified: (i) cooperative
    awareness messages which are time triggered (periodic) beacons that carry position
    information and (ii) decentralized environmental notification messages which are
    event triggered and carry hazard warnings [27], [28]. In situations that are risky
    and may lead to a collision, road users will send updated messages in a periodic
    fashion at 100ms intervals. The authors conclude that their proposed method provides
    a risk-free environment for pedestrians and could also reduce the energy consumption
    of user equipments. Similarly, Rahimian et al. [29] examined how the action of
    a pedestrian engaged in composing or reading an SMS can be influenced by sending
    mobile device warnings when approaching to an unsafe road crossing. The authors
    specifically assess the effects of texting on pedestrian road crossing behavior
    and the effectiveness of those warnings in reducing unsafe road crossing. They
    project that texting reduces pedestrian awareness of traffic and prejudices their
    road-crossing decision-making. Warning alarms help redirect their attention towards
    traffic and also reduce the probability of risky road crossing and collision.
    The authors use an approach entitled “Between-subjects design” considering three
    different types of conditions: (i) texting, (ii) warning, and (iii) control. In
    terms of texting, the participants continuously receive and respond to the text
    messages during the entire road-crossing session, while in the case of warning,
    the participants also receive an auditory alarm from a cell phone when they enter
    to a situation that is classified as unsafe. In the control condition, the participants
    neither receive any text nor respond to any message but hold the smartphone during
    the entire road-crossing session. The authors conclude that the proposed technique
    improves road-crossing decisions of pedestrians which are busy in text messages.
    They also indicate that further investigation is required in situations when the
    participants receive the warning messages, but fail to respond to those messages,
    and continue to cross roads in an unsafe manner [29]. Moreover, Coeugnet et al.
    [30] assessed the performance and effectiveness of a vibrotactile wristband device
    by helping older pedestrians in safer street-crossing decisions. The study was
    conducted in a simulated two-way traffic environment with a street-crossing task
    where twenty younger-old (age 60-70), twenty older-old (age 70-80), and 17 younger
    adults (age 20-45) with and without a vibrotactile wristband participated. The
    test was run on a virtual platform to check the device’s ability to accurately
    emulate all the required communication between the vehicle, infrastructure and
    pedestrian. The authors claim that the haptic device partly compensates for some
    age-related gap-acceptance difficulties and reduces the street-crossing risks
    for all users. They also conjecture that the device will be beneficial for all
    ages but particularly for older participants and specifically for older women
    who have difficulties in street-crossing. The device also helps to reduce the
    number of decisions that may lead to collisions in situations when vehicles approach
    rapidly [30].The authors advise some educational and training programs by using
    virtual reality tools to educate pedestrians about their vulnerabilities and how
    to cope with those in order to reduce crash statistics [31]–[33]. C. Vehicle-To-Infrastructure
    (V2I) Communication Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) is basically a communication
    model that allows a vehicle to share information with roadside components such
    as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) readers and cameras, traffic lights,
    lane markers, streetlights and parking meters etc. V2I is a bidirectional wireless
    communication where data is transferred from infrastructure to vehicle and vice
    versa over an ad hoc network [34]. According to Péter et al. [24], some of the
    key components for a minimal V2I system should contain: Vehicle on-board unit
    (OBU), Roadside Unit (RSU), and a safe communication channel. OBU is comprised
    of a radio transceiver such as a dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) system,
    a GPS system and a processor and facilitates communication between the vehicles
    and RSUs and other vehicles in the near proximity. RSUs are composed of the same
    radio transceiver i.e. DSRC, an application processor and an interface to the
    V2I communication network. These are usually mounted on interchanges, intersections,
    and patrol stations. RSUs are mainly responsible for private data transfer and
    message prioritization management to and from the vehicle. Messages are prioritized
    based on their criticality - local and V2V safety applications have the highest
    priority, public and private network applications have lower priority, while entertainment
    messages have the lowest priority [24]. Similarly, Ndashimye et al. [35] conducted
    an extensive survey on the effectiveness of V2I communication in the context of
    5G networks that supports the co-existence of multi-tier heterogeneous wireless
    networks with various radio access technologies (RATs). The authors initially
    studied the V2I communication standards such as DSRC derived from the 802.x family,
    Wireless access in vehicular environments (WAVE), and LTE-A. DSRC uses a licensed
    spectrum at 5.9 GHz with seven channels of 10 MHz bandwidth (5.850-5.925). Out
    of the seven channels, the control channel in the center is dedicated for safety
    applications, two at the end are reserved for special purposes, while the rest
    are the service channels available for both safety and non-safety applications
    [36], [37]. WAVE or IEEE802.11p integrate both the MAC and physical layer, use
    orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) in order to divide the signal
    into multiple narrowband signals and define two classes of devices: OBU and RSU
    [36]. The authors also mention some of the key application areas of V2I such as
    traffic efficiency and management, entertainment and personalized applications
    and safety-related applications. The primary focus of the study is V2I safety
    applications that may lead to either reducing or even avoiding crashes by increasing
    driver awareness via different warning messages wirelessly communicated between
    vehicles and roadside infrastructure [35]. Some of the key recommendations from
    the proposed studies are: (i) efficient network discovery, (ii) underlying network
    selection, (iii) seamless and reliable vertical handover, (iv) QoS requirements,
    (v) dissemination of data, (vi) security and (vii) an upper layer communication
    protocol suite in order to support seamless vertical handover in 5G heterogeneous
    network environments. Moreover, Ndashimye et al. [38] propose a network selection
    method that applies the knowledge of mobility data and network load information
    in order to carry out an effective handover for V2I communication over multi-tier
    heterogeneous networks. Some of the key parameters such as relative direction
    index, residence time index, proximity index, and network load index are identified
    in order to select the best candidate network for vehicle with a judicious coverage.
    The algorithms were tested in an OPNET simulator by developing a dual mode vehicle
    OBU fortified with both Wi-Fi and LTE-A cards in order to evaluate and validate
    the proposed system model. The performance of the proposed model was compared
    with the conventional method and access network discovery and selection function-assisted
    handover methods. The authors concluded that the proposed approach can reduce
    the unnecessary handover up to 50%, mean handover latency up to 40%, higher throughput
    up to 50% and lower end-to-end delay up to 43% with respect to the conventional
    handover method. D. Intra-Vehicle (IV) Communication Wireless interconnections
    between sensors and other devices within the vehicle, such as sensors for detecting
    road conditions and driver’s fatigue, monitoring tire pressure and water temperature
    in the cooling system and advanced sensors for autonomous control are currently
    being investigated [20], [39]. Along with these, a number of other sensors and
    processors such as Antilock Braking Systems and Electronic Stability Control monitor
    a vehicle’s internal performance and dynamics, while camera, radar, and ultrasonic
    sensors sense the environment around the vehicle and keep the driver up to-date
    with his surroundings. Tuohy et al. [39] explore the physical layer technologies
    for Next Generation Ethernet networks with some middleware technologies in terms
    of automotive industries. They also categorize automotive network traffic and
    classify it with respect to control data, safety data, infotainment data and driver
    assistance cameras. Control data is further divided into low-bandwidth control
    applications and real-time control applications. Systems that control non-safety
    critical aspects of the vehicle such as electronically controlled mirrors and
    seats fall into the category of low-bandwidth control applications, while suspension
    and braking systems, ABS and traction control lie under real-time control applications.
    Safety data assists drivers by using the built-in driver safety systems such as
    adaptive cruise control, parking sensors and night-time pedestrian detection infrared
    sensors. GPS, audio and visual entertainment, and on-board internet facilities
    fall into the category of infotainment data that encompasses all the traffic related
    to entertainment and driver information systems within the vehicle. Finally, the
    driver assistance cameras assist the drivers while reversing and lane departing
    [39]. The authors conclude their discussion by suggesting the standardization
    of approaches across the industries, allowing manufacturers to focus on new innovations
    based on existing applications. Similarly, Saed et al. [40] address the security
    issues in intra-inter vehicle communication networks. In terms of intra-vehicle
    communication, the authors suggest that data transmission between the vehicle’s
    Electronic Control Units through a Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol should
    be protected. The research was carried out to present some background study into
    the specifics of CAN applications. Some of the key issues such as boot loader,
    privacy, operating system level issues, application specific issues and communication
    related issues with respect to security not only in today’s vehicles but also
    in the future vehicles were focused. Promises of security improvements for future
    vehicles are also suggested such as adopting IPV6 in the vehicle communication
    protocol, behavioral privacy, cross-domain security, use of public key infrastructure,
    resolving privacy concerns with respect to customer information, implementing
    a robust security approach for the vehicle communication and last but not least
    addressing all the newly identified vulnerabilities by constant monitoring and
    tracking [40]. E. Challenges of Existing Communication Technologies and Solutions
    Some of the major standardized technologies that are currently being considered
    for V2X communication are: IEEE802.11p/DSRC and its extension IEEE802.11px, 3rd
    generation partnership project (3GPP)’s Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) Pro
    and millimeter-wave (mmWave) [41], [42]. Further detail about each of these technology
    with respect to its pros and cons is provided below. 1) IEEE802.11p/DSRC and IEEE802.11px
    The IEEE802.11p/DSRC standard incorporates the suite of IEEE802.11s and IEEEP1609.x
    standards (with some modifications), operating in a frequency range of 5.850 GHz
    to 5.925 GHz. Having a decentralized architecture, the Physical (PHY) layer of
    the protocol is based on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), while
    the MAC layer is based on Enhanced Distributed Channel Access protocol having
    Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance and four different access
    categories to the medium that supports different QoS profiles and prioritizes
    data traffic [41], [42]. Due to a direct communication between the source and
    destination endpoints, the protocol can operate without network coverage in a
    fully distributed manner. These endpoints start communication without forming
    a Basic Service Set that allows vehicles to effectively and immediately transmit
    data. The protocol spectrum is divided into seven channels each of 10 MHz bandwidth,
    where the control channel is specifically reserved for broadcasting safety and
    mission critical messages, while the remaining six channels can be used for all
    other applications [42]. Due to the adopted MAC contention based medium access
    strategy, the IEEE802.11p/DSRC throughput and end-to-end delay performance degrades
    quickly as the network load increases. The main reason behind this degradation
    is the lack of coordination between the devices and the use of a “listen before
    talk” mechanism. Based on these assumptions, the protocol may only be suitable
    for transferring low bitrate data streams in vehicular environments. Another drawback
    of IEEE802.11p/DSRC is that its communication range typically extends to several
    100s of meters and that may not be applicable to some V2X applications where a
    reliable transmission beyond this communication range is required [41]. Efficient
    utilization of the allocated spectrum for mission critical applications and safety
    purposes in 5.9 GHz frequency band is another drawback of IEEE802.11p/DSRC. According
    to Mavromatis et al. [42], to overcome the deficiencies of IEEE02.11p/DSRC, an
    enhanced version of the protocol in terms of IEEE802.11px is launched based on
    a Space Time Block Coding mechanism that can increase the performance under noisy
    channel transmissions and can improve the packet delivery rate by 40% as compared
    to IEEE802.11p. Also, the new protocol is expected to provide MIMO antenna capabilities
    with improved OFDM layouts, and very high throughput frame by enhancing the channel
    capacity by a factor of 10 [42]. 2) 3GPP LTE-Advanced Pro The next level of communication
    is to bypass the existing infrastructure and transfer data directly between the
    users. It’s basically the next generation of Device-to-Device (D2D) communication
    where an infrastructure independent communication will be offered with significantly
    lower delay performance. LTE and LTE-A Pro, represents the next generation of
    5G cellular communication standards defined by 3GPP in order to provide high data
    rates, pervasive coverage, enhanced connectivity for end-users regardless of the
    geographical location and environment. Public Land Mobile Network facilitates
    cellular radio coverage to vehicles and vulnerable road users such as pedestrians
    and cyclists based on 3GPP LTE standard also known as Evolved Universal Terrestrial
    Access Network and can exploit the existing infrastructure for V2X communication
    [41], [42]. LTE was originally designed for mobile broadband (MBB) services; hence
    it has many limitations with respect to V2X communication. Some of those limitations
    are listed as follows based on [41]: Latency increases as the number of users
    in a cell increases, and to maintain a latency below 200ms, event-triggered messages
    should be limited from 100 to 150 devices in rural and urban environments respectively.
    A single data packet between two vehicles needs to traverse the entire network
    rather than a direct transfer link between the source and destination. This may
    lead to a higher delay and sometimes a point of failure for the infrastructure.
    LTE will not be an optimal solution for transmitting small chunks of data as it
    was originally designed for broadband services. Transmission of these small packets
    of data may lead to problems such as channel coding, control and channel estimation
    overhead and resource granularity. As LTE is an infrastructure-based approach,
    it may be difficult to satisfy the coverage requirements in tunnels, mountainous
    territories, underground parking and rural areas etc. which are basically the
    most vulnerable places for road-users. To overcome these limitations, the current
    release of LTE-A Pro is designed in such a way that can fulfill almost all the
    requirements for public safety and commercial consumer applications such as higher
    mobility and long-distance coverage, enhanced QoS, and multicast communication.
    Similarly, the downlink and uplink access technologies are based on OFDMA and
    Single Carrier (SC-FDMA) respectively, so frequency-time resource scheduling is
    guaranteed with higher flexibility and efficiency. Even with dynamic propagation
    environments and higher mobility speeds, significant spectral efficiency can be
    obtained based on advanced MIMO capabilities. Also, having multicast/broadcast
    capabilities, LTE-A Pro can fully support vehicular service message broadcasting
    in cross traffic assistance applications. With such mature capabilities, LTE-A
    Pro still has limitations in terms of latency [43], [44]. The maximum achievable
    latency in end-to-end communication can be as high as 80ms, which is not sufficient
    to support tactile-like communication that requires a latency of less than 10ms.
    Similarly, terminals need to re-establish a connection with the base station after
    an idle state costing a latency of almost 110ms for additional link establishment,
    which again promotes severe performance degradation and may not be usable in safety-critical
    applications [45]. 3) Millimeter Wave (mmWave) The next generation of 5G cellular
    systems will have mmWave technology and systems that will be based on this technology
    will play an important role in 5G communication. mmWave operates in the spectrum
    between 30GHz and 300GHz, while the carrier frequencies are spread around 60GHz
    with a channelisation of 2.16GHz. Through beamforming technologies, mmWave will
    achieve high array gains by implementing large antenna arrays that will help the
    system to achieve higher data rates typically up to several gigabits-per-second
    [42], [46]. IEEE802.11ad which is basically a protocol stack for mmWave will ensure
    a data-rate of 7Gbps with an end-to-end latency of less than 10ms. Also, under
    ideal propagation conditions, mmWave systems outperforms IEEE802.11p/DSRC and
    LTE/LTE-A Pro standards in terms of V2X communication [47]. A summary of all these
    features along with some additional capabilities of the above mentioned technologies
    is given in Table 2 based on [42]. TABLE 2 Candidate Technologies for V2X Communication
    SECTION IV. Drones Wireless networks comprising of Drones/UAVs can provide on-the-fly
    communication facilities in a cost-effective way in situations where part of the
    existing terrestrial infrastructure is destroyed and there is a need to provide
    emergency services and avoid any further destruction in the disaster-struck areas
    [48], [49]. In most cases, UAVs are only used for military purposes, but when
    they are equipped with small access points/routers, they can provide a communication
    bridge between ground users and network nodes. Similarly, UAVs can be used in
    package delivery, surveillance operations and IoT applications. Surveillance operations
    usually involve monitoring the areas of interest over a long period of time. Such
    operations may include search and rescue operations, border patrol and traffic
    monitoring, fire monitoring and many more [49], [50]. A. Single UAV Deployment
    Single UAV deployment is a simple scenario where a UAV tries to bridge communication
    between two static nodes on the ground. Kwon and Hailes [51] proposed a greedy
    search algorithm in order to search the area for node discovery and to achieve
    optimum communication between the participating nodes. The optimal position of
    a UAV is identified based on balanced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), throughput,
    and bit error rate. SNR and throughput are used as input variables and based on
    these variables the proportional-integral-derivative controller decides the next
    waypoint of the UAV. The authors concluded that based on SNR and throughput, the
    algorithm can calculate the most advantageous position of the UAV where all the
    participating nodes can be served at the same time. Similarly, several algorithms
    have been developed in order to connect a disjoint group of nodes using a single
    UAV. Heimfarth and de Araujo [52] presented a method for connecting a disjoint
    group of wireless sensor networks with the help of a UAV for the purpose of carrying
    messages. The authors used the UAV as a data mule, where the UAV physically transmits
    the packets to the entire network. Initially the network was partitioned into
    different segments and a cluster head election was done in order to elect a cluster
    head for each group of nodes. The cluster head is the node that is responsible
    for communicating and exchanging data with UAV. The authors proposed a separate
    algorithm for the cluster head election process. Within a segment, geographic
    routing was used to route the packets and was termed as intra-segment message
    relay. For inter-segment message relays where the packets need to be transferred
    from one segment to another, the UAV visits each cluster head for collecting data
    and delivering it to the required destination. The authors performed different
    simulations and concluded that the system is capable of maintaining communication
    between the group of nodes with a low packet rate for a moderate set of traffic.
    Two different cases were considered for simulation purpose having an area of 4
    and 9 km2 respectively. 6 & 9 segments with 60 nodes per segment using a single
    UAV with a speed of 60 km/h having a buffer size of 200-400 packets was considered
    for the same set of simulation. Heimfarth and de Araujo [52] also noticed a bigger
    latency in the case of a huge deployment area. An intelligent hierarchical state
    routing algorithm (IHSR) was proposed in order to reduce the system latency because
    of long propagation delays of UAVs as well as to improve the throughput [53].
    The hierarchical infrastructure of a heterogeneous ad-hoc wireless network with
    UAVs consisted of 2 levels i.e. ground ad-hoc wireless network, and ground embedded
    mobile backbone network. IHSR first divides the entire network into clusters where
    each cluster has its own cluster head and cluster internal nodes (cluster members).
    Logical addresses were introduced in IHSR in order to manage the mobility in a
    better way. For route discovery, link state messages or invitation messages were
    exchanged locally and globally through neighbor cluster heads and UAV broadcasts.
    In respond to an invitation message, each lower level node sends a registration
    message to the cluster head where the cluster head stores it in its INtable. Gu
    et al. [53] verified their algorithm through different simulations and concluded
    that the proposed system improved the throughput for link state routing through
    UAV broadcasts instead of flooding. Moreover, different mobility models for ad-hoc
    network were studied by Camp et al. [54]. The authors categorized the movement
    of mobile nodes in two different models i.e. Entity mobility models, and Group
    mobility models. In entity mobility models, the movement of mobile nodes are independent
    of each other, while in group mobility models, the movement of mobile nodes are
    dependent on each other. B. Multiple UAV Deployment Complex situations occur when
    a single UAV is unable to cover a group of nodes in a specific mission. Multiple
    UAVs are used in such cases in order to cover a set of nodes in a bounded region.
    A cooperative distributed planning algorithm termed as the consensus based bundle
    algorithm (CBBA) was proposed by Ponda et al. [55] in order to ensure network
    connectivity with limited communication facilities for a group of heterogeneous
    agents operating in a dynamic environment. The algorithm improves the entire mission
    performance and also extend the range of a team. CBBA use the free agents as relays
    for maintaining connectivity between the base station and UAVs during the task
    execution. The authors validated the performance of CBBA through simulation results
    as well as field tests and, based on those results they concluded that CBBA is
    well suited for real time applications. Similarly, Palat et al. [56] studied the
    application of distributed MIMO schemes on multiple UAVs as communication relays
    for range and reliability improvement of ground based ad-hoc networks. The authors
    used different simulation parameters to verify the performance of both MIMO and
    orthogonal space-time block codes techniques under ideal and non-ideal conditions.
    In the case of lower carrier frequencies, better performance can be achieved in
    terms of distributed beamforming. Also, in the case of multi-hop relaying based
    on swarm of UAVs, the range and reliability of ad-hoc networks can be improved.
    C. Collision Avoidance in the Case of Multiple UAVs Collision avoidance is another
    important issue that must be addressed in the presence of multiple UAVs. Li et
    al. [57] have evaluated a number of collision avoidance algorithms such as collision
    cone, geometric collision cones, simulated annealing, inverse proportional navigation,
    artificial potential fields, and dynamic sparse A-Star (A*). The authors verified
    the evaluation process by implementing and simulating the aforementioned algorithms
    on a common infrastructure, and also addressed the strength and weaknesses of
    each approach. Collision cone and geometric collision cone algorithms works on
    the concept of relative velocities of all UAVs generating a collision cone. A
    minimum distance between two UAVs was calculated based on the relative velocities
    and concluded that if the relative velocity is greater than a specified degree
    of angle, then the UAVs are moving away and there is no threat of collision. On
    the other hand, if both the UAVs are inside the cone and their relative velocities
    are less than the specified degree of angle, a threat of collision is there. In
    that case, the relative velocities of UAVs need to be changed in order to rectify
    the possible collision. Moreover, if both the velocities are same, then there
    is a need to deviate the UAV from their original path, because they are approaching
    towards each other and there is a possibility of entering into the threat zone.
    In simulated annealing, there are three main steps i.e. clustering the UAVs, establishing
    a cost function, and minimizing the cost function. In step one, the UAVs are clustered
    into groups based on their threats. Also, a minimum distance between two UAVs
    where the UAVs can still avoid the collision is calculated and this particular
    area is termed as danger zone. If there is no threat in the danger zone, the UAV
    can safely continue towards its goal. A cost function is then established where
    the UAVs will be instructed regarding how much they will turn in order to change
    the velocity and to avoid collision. This cost function is then minimized based
    on certain parameters such as energy level of the current state, and random neighboring
    state for new solution. Li et al. [57] concluded that the neighbor can become
    a new solution only if the energy level is less than the current solution, or
    if the probability function designates it as the new solution. D. Drone Applications
    Using 5G Lin et al. [58] performed field measurements for data collection during
    drone flights connected to the commercial LTE network. They also performed some
    simulations in order to study the performance of network in terms of serving many
    drones simultaneously over a wide area. The main purpose of this study was to
    analyze the applicability and performance of mobile network connectivity to low
    altitude drones. Lin et al. [58] conclude that the current mobile LTE network
    can support the initial deployment of low altitude drones, but they are still
    facing some issues with respect to interference and mobility that can be addressed
    by the next generation of 5G networks by providing more efficient connectivity
    for wide-scale drone deployment. Similarly, Luo et al. [59] highlight the communication
    and network technologies that can contribute to UAV disaster management systems
    in situations including early warning system, search and rescue, data gathering,
    provision of network coverage in emergency communication and logistic delivery.
    The authors also address the networking technologies that are essential for UAV
    deployment in practical environments in the context of disaster management and
    response. A universal network architecture based on 802.11 Wi-Fi network, 2G/3G/4G
    cellular network, UAV ad-hoc network and satellite network was proposed as shown
    in Figure 4. FIGURE 4. UAV-based disaster management. Show All Design considerations
    and challenges such as bandwidth consumption, transmission latency and disruption
    of UAV-based wireless network for disaster management were also studied. In terms
    of bandwidth consumption, strict bandwidth requirements must be fulfilled especially
    for online applications such as real-time monitoring. In addition to real-time
    monitoring, 4K or even 8K videos captured during aerial monitoring applications
    require a much higher bandwidth. Such a higher bandwidth can be ensured by the
    next generation of 5G communication. Latency is another important aspect in the
    design of system components and network protocols. For real-time visual and audio
    data transfer in the context of aerial communication, latency should not be more
    than 50-100ms. Similarly, for surveillance, such as border or highway patrolling,
    the latency should not be more than 3ms. Luo et al. [59] also address the design
    considerations and challenges such as channel modeling, antenna structure design,
    UAV cooperation, advanced data analytics, path planning, and energy efficiency
    etc. of a UAV-based ad-hoc network for disaster management. Moreover, Huo et al.
    [60] present a comprehensive review of the current developments made in three
    categories of UAV-enabled next generation wireless communications. In the first
    phase, a multi-layer distributed UAV-enabled 5G network is proposed, where the
    architecture is more flexible, hierarchical and supports scenario driven reconfigurations.
    In the second phase, several performance enhancement enablers are identified and
    evaluated for UAV-enabled 5G wireless communications. Furthermore, Naqvi et al.
    [48] focus on different UAV-enabled 5G communication paradigms such as deployment
    issues related to energy efficiency etc. In this regard, the work investigates
    the compatibility of UAVs with traditional wireless networks to achieve energy
    efficient high data rates for 5G communications. Moreover, the article proposes
    a UAV-based routing protocol for disaster-resilient infrastructure. A case study
    is presented based on a UAV that is incorporated in a wireless network in both
    low and high-power base stations operating at different frequencies. The study
    concludes that the incorporation of UAVs will increase the performance of the
    heterogeneous network in terms of network coverage and data rate. Similarly, He
    et al. [61] discussed the security aspects of UAV-enabled 5G communication for
    public safety networks. Using UAVs in such a critical network infrastructure may
    pose cybersecurity threats to the personal information of the individuals involved.
    If UAV-enabled communication is not made secure, this will reduce the applicability
    and usability of such networks. The authors claim that UAV-enabled communication
    networks suffer from issues like unauthorized access, malicious control, or other
    cybersecurity attacks. He et al. [61] emphasize the need for communication security
    schemes to be incorporated in such critical networks to secure personal information.
    Shakhatreh et al. [8] performed a comprehensive survey on UAV civil applications
    with their key challenges. The main purpose of the study was to present the worldwide
    UAV payload market value and to provide a classification of UAVs based on certain
    factors such as endurance, weight, coverage range, maximum altitude, and its applications.
    The authors also discussed the civil applications of UAVs in a number of key areas
    including real-time monitoring of road traffic, security and surveillance, precision
    agriculture, provision of civil infrastructure, search and rescue operations,
    and delivery of goods along with their key challenges. Additionally, Fotouhi et
    al. [62] proposed a novel Drone-Cells scenario where the drones within a cell
    persistently move in order to serve the users from a closer distance for the sake
    of improving the spectral efficiency of the network along with the quality of
    service of the cell-edge users. Three different mobility control algorithms with
    erratic complexity and performance were used to check the efficiency of DroneCells
    scenario. Based on the simulation results, the authors claimed 34% improvement
    in terms of spectral efficiency and a 50% increase in the 5th-percentile packet
    throughput as compared to drone hover over some fixed locations. Fotouhi et al.
    [62] also assured that such kind of results can be obtained with minimal drone
    speeds in order to avoid any negative effect on drone battery lifetime. Likewise,
    Zeng et al. [63] provide an overview of the emerging technologies with their potential
    benefits, communication and spectrum requirements, along with proposing some new
    design considerations with respect to the next generation of three-dimensional
    heterogeneous wireless networks. Based on the proposed cellular-connected UAV
    technology as shown in Figure 5, new wireless technologies can be developed that
    will enable significantly enhanced UAV-ground communications. Several appealing
    advantages of cellular-connected UAVs such as ubiquitous accessibility, enhanced
    performance, ease of monitoring and management, robust navigation, and cost effectiveness
    were also highlighted. In terms of new design considerations, the authors explored
    3D coverage, unique channel characteristics, severe aerial-ground interference,
    and asymmetric uplink/downlink traffic requirements. Similarly, in terms of promising
    technologies that can effectively enable future wireless systems, the authors
    investigated 3D beamforming, multi-cell cooperation, and ground-aerial non-orthogonal
    multiple access. Finally, Zeng et al. [63] outlined some future directions such
    as quality of service aware trajectory design, millimeter wave cellular-connected
    UAV, and cellular-connected UAV swarm. FIGURE 5. An overview of cellular-connected
    UAVs representing different use-cases. Show All In similar manner, Zhang et al.
    [64] studied the PHY layer security in UAV communication to address the two critical
    issues i.e. the achievable secrecy rate between the legitimate transmitter and
    intended receiver will be limited as compare to the rate between the legitimate
    transmitter and eavesdropper, even in the presence of power control, artificial
    noise, cooperative jamming, and multi-antenna beamforming techniques. Secondly,
    since the eavesdropper is a passive device, it is quite difficult to estimate
    the channel state information of the eavesdropper that is usually required to
    a legitimate transmitter. For simplicity, the authors considered a single UAV
    that is deployed to send the confidential information to a fixed position-based
    legitimate receiver in the presence of a fixed position-based eavesdropper. The
    main purpose of the study was to maximize the average secrecy rate of the UAV
    by jointly designing the UAV trajectory and transmit power control subject to
    different constraints such as average and peak transmit power, UAV mobility with
    its maximum speed, and initial and final UAV locations. Based on the proposed
    efficient iterative algorithm, the authors concluded that the algorithm can expressively
    improve the physical layer security performance of the UAV communication system.
    E. Comparative Analysis of Control Latency in Terms of 4G and 5G In this section
    we elaborate on the control latency that is currently offered by different cellular
    technologies for mission critical infrastructures using drones and how 5G will
    help to reduce that latency. Also, we discuss some of the capabilities that 5G
    is offering for drones. Yang et al. [65] performed some field experiments in order
    to gain insights into the capabilities of 4G networks for connected drones. The
    results were collected at 2.6GHz carrier frequency with 20MHz carrier bandwidth
    using LTE-Advance network. Latency performance of the proposed network was calculated
    at three different heights i.e. 50m, 100m, and 300m. The results illustrate that
    most of the latency data samples are concentrated between 200ms and 300ms at a
    height of 50 and 100m respectively, while at 300m height, the latency data samples
    are more inclined towards 400 to 500ms. Based on the latency samples, it can be
    suggested that without further enhancements the current LTE-A network might have
    difficulties in serving drone applications with rigorous latency requirements.
    Yang et al. [65] conclude that the more powerful capabilities of the next generation
    of 5G networks can address the coverage, data rate, and latency issues of the
    existing technologies and can fulfill the objectives of the connected drones in
    mission critical infrastructures. The improved capabilities of 5G networks may
    include coverage enhancements and high data rates, service differentiation and
    QoS enhancements, and detection and resource management. Some of the key characteristics
    of cellular communication technologies with respect to disaster management are
    summarized in Table 3 [59]. TABLE 3 Characteristics of Cellular Technologies in
    Disaster Management Using Drones SECTION V. Healthcare With the increase in the
    world’s adult population [66], there is an increasing requirement for treatment
    and assistance in emergency healthcare situations. This has emphasized the need
    for technological advancements in healthcare to provide efficient and affordable
    solutions to an increasing number of patients. Kumar et al. [67] identified the
    important features that a mobile healthcare system should possess. Such a system
    should be able to (i) handle emergency cases using tele-medicine facilities, (ii)
    provide tele-medicine unit to a doctor in order to enhance intensive healthcare
    provision and (iii) allow the installation of a tele-monitoring system at patient’s
    home while the monitoring station is based in the doctor’s office. Alemdar and
    Ersoy [68] provide a survey of healthcare applications that deploy wireless sensor
    networks such as movement tracking, medication intake tracking and daily activity
    monitoring. The authors emphasize that there are several limitations that currently
    exist in current technologies that can be overcome by adopting 5G networks to
    make healthcare remotely accessible. Soldani et al. [69] propose a framework that
    can be deployed on mobile devices, offering functionality for collecting, processing
    and storing information to support identification of abnormal events. The development
    of 4G technologies enabled the advent of a range of tele-medicine applications
    such as remote consultation, remote surgery and patient monitoring. Kumar et al.
    [67] also discuss limitations of existing technologies (i.e. lack of flexible
    and compatible tele-medical links due to high hardware and operational costs,
    data transfer rates and latency) that will need to be addressed in future technologies
    such as 5G. When deploying the next generation of networks, the main factors that
    should be addressed are security, seamless integration, QoS and streaming and
    compression issues. It is expected that the advent of 5G technologies will play
    an active part in providing patient-oriented healthcare applications which can
    be easily managed by the patient or the carer. It is expected that 5G networks
    would carry a significantly higher volume of data while maintaining reliability
    [70], [71]. The critical requirement for 5G networks is ultra-low latency which
    will allow the deployment of mission critical applications such as tele-consulting,
    tele-surgery etc. Kim et al. [72] highlight that in order to achieve interdisciplinary
    collaboration between medical services and technology, there are a few requirements
    to be met. These include (i) sensors that are ultra sensitive and small enough
    to be embedded into the patient’s body, (ii) ultra reliable low latency communications
    infrastructure which can transmit large amounts of audio, video and haptic feedback
    data with very little delay; and (iii) standardized haptic interfaces such as
    surgical robots etc. that will possibly increase the type of applications where
    such technologies can be deployed. Figure 6 represents an infrastructure model
    for a tele-medicine system which consists of an operator with an interface at
    the controller end connected to a remotely controlled domain via a 5G cellular
    network. FIGURE 6. A representation of a tele-medicine infrastructure using 5G
    network. Show All De Mattos and Gondim [73] discuss the requirements for implementing
    mobile health applications (m-health) using 5G networks and the capabilities of
    5G communication that are important for m-health applications. The authors identified
    some of the significant features such as very low latency, bandwidth, scalability,
    high network capacity, large number of sensory devices, long battery lifetime,
    reliability, resilience and security that 5G networks require for m-health applications.
    Chen et al. [70] and Thuemmler et al. [74] discuss the various technical specifications
    relevant to healthcare such as network design approaches and paradigms. The various
    aspects discussed range from the types of data sources available from the healthcare
    domain, to the techniques required to perform the necessary data processing and
    network resource management techniques. Thuemmler et al. [74] discuss the network
    spectrum required for tele-medicine applications and the interoperability requirements
    when setting up a tele-medicine infrastructure. References [10] and [75]–[77]
    refer to IoT devices used for healthcare applications as Internet of Medical Things
    (IoMT) which requires high data and speed capacity and a long operation time over
    a reliable network with very low transmission delay. Brito [78] provides a survey
    of the various technological trends in the realm of 5G networks and various IoMT
    applications and the requirements of 5G networks for the deployment of these systems.
    West [10] discusses the capabilities of 5G as compared to existing networks to
    deploy cyber-physical healthcare systems and could allow for implementation of
    healthcare applications such as online consultation, diagnosis and remote surgery
    applications. The following sub-sections go into further details of the popular
    healthcare applications available which could benefit from incorporating 5G networks
    for communication [76], [79]. A. Online Consultation 5G technology with IoMT,
    big data analysis and ML techniques will allow for enhancements in healthcare
    applications [11]. The incorportaion of sensors as part of IoMT and 5G network
    to monitor vitals and other health related data will allow patients (at home)
    to monitor themselves and transmit the data to the health expert at a remote location
    (i.e. hospital) for a real-time online consultation. Caric et al. [80] identify
    the advantages of using online consultation and also propose a platform for online
    consultations. They emphasize that the online consultation can provide better
    regulatory governance which would ensure transparency in the regulatory environment.
    They highlight the drawbacks of current online consultation systems which lack
    coordinated information exchange. They do emphasize that the existing global communication
    network provides an opportunity to construct a communication platform for online
    consultations where ordinary citizens, experts, different civic and business associations
    and executive bodies could contribute and exchange information using mainly standard
    internet connectivity [80]. Segura-Sampedro et al. [81] conducted a study on post-operative
    wound observation via remote access. The findings suggested that the patients
    were satisfied with this method of consultation and considered it to be feasible
    and safe for postoperative applications. B. Online Health Monitoring With the
    advent of 5G technologies, it is possible to realize the concept of virtual hospitals
    which provide a variety of services over a communication channel. Oleshchuk and
    Fensli [82] addressed security and privacy issues that need to be considered when
    implementing a health monitoring application in the 5G communication context.
    Limitations of the existing cellular technologies with respect to body area network
    were highlighted and possible solutions based on some new approaches in terms
    of 5G were also proposed. Biswas and Misra [83] discuss low cost, reliable e-Health
    monitoring device using an IoT-based platform architecture that can measure the
    vital signs of an individual, securely store the data on a server and analyze
    the data to generate specific proactive alerts when necessary. The platform connects
    the patient to the registered doctors who will have access to the patient’s health
    data which are monitored using medical sensors. Hence, the platform can be used
    to provide clinical healthcare at a distance, thus enabling the monitoring of
    elderly or home bound patients and those who are located in remote areas. Jusak
    et al. [77] propose an IoMT system for monitoring cardiac signals using an agent
    and manager model. The agent collects the signals in the form of a phonocardiograph
    signal which is then sent to the manager which gathers the health data and presents
    it to the healthcare providers via a web interface. This model can be extended
    to other types of monitoring application where the patient data can be accessed
    securely from any location in the world by a doctor or healthcare provider. C.
    Remote Diagnosis West [10] discusses the potential of using 5G networks to deploy
    remote healthcare systems that would allow for real-time monitoring and management
    of several sources of health data and efficiently diagnose an ailment event before
    it manifests. Brito [78] summarizes IoT and related e-health applications which
    include medical expertise using advanced tele-diagnostic tools, enabling remote
    physical examination (even by touch) through a robot that is remotely controlled,
    which can offer audio-visual and haptic feedback. The authors identify the requirements
    that enable such applications to be implemented, including enhanced mobile broadband,
    milli-meter wave communication and low latency high reliable communications. Chen
    et al. [84] propose a 5G-Smart Diabetes system, which combines state-of-the-art
    technologies such as wearable 2.0, ML and big data to generate comprehensive sensing
    and analysis for patients suffering from diabetes. They also present the data
    sharing mechanism and personalized data analysis model for 5G-Smart Diabetes.
    Bagula et al. [85] detail a cyber-physical healthcare system which allows for
    recognition of a patient’s condition that is considered at the first step in a
    fully digitized remote healthcare system. ML is used in the multi-layer framework
    that consists of numerous low cost lightweight devices. D. Mobile Robotic Surgery
    With the advancement of 5G technologies, the popularity of mobile robotic surgery
    is set to grow substantially [86]. Haptic sensing is an essential requirement
    for an efficient remote surgical procedure to be conducted. Lema et al. [87] tested
    a tele surgery system which implements a tactile glove to provide haptic feedback
    and observed how it could improve the performance of remote surgery applications.
    The performance of robotic tele-surgery depends on various properties of the communication
    network such as latency, jitter and packet loss; which is considered significant
    when the remote surgery system is implemented with haptic feedback. This highlights
    the significant challenges that need to be addressed in order to use a reliable
    and secure but cost-effective communication setup for remote/robotic surgery applications
    [88]. Surgical robots will provide an alternative to maintain the high quality
    of personal and medical care in Europe, where remotely operated devices would
    allow the healthcare system to operate at a much higher performance and cost-effectiveness.
    To reduce the performance degradation resulting from large latencies, the operator
    needs to be within the proximity of the remote site. Implementing 5G technologies
    would reduce the latency issues which would improve the access to mobile robotic
    surgery. SECTION VI. Open Research Challenges and Future Directions In this section,
    we shed light on some of the open research challenges in terms of V2X, drones
    and healthcare and highlight interesting research topics for future directions.
    A list of potential research challenges along with their future directions is
    listed below. Path loss and channel model of higher carrier frequencies is a challenging
    issue specially in areas surrounded by skyscraper buildings and having a denser
    base-station deployment. Latency of less than 1 millisecond in emergency situations
    for autonomous cars and automatic pilot is an important issue that needs to be
    ensured in the future cellular technologies. Ultra-reliable communication is another
    open issue that needs to be addressed in the future for both vehicle and public
    safety. A lot of work has already been done in this area, but still with the introduction
    of IoT and massive number of connected devices will make it a challenging issue
    again. Another important issue that needs to be researched is the identification
    of vulnerabilities and security loopholes in the new communication system. A tremendous
    amount of work is required at physical layer to identify the suitable techniques
    to cope with the compromised user equipment and data. Effective use of ML techniques
    to analyze and differentiate between normal and attacker behaviors is also a research
    challenge. Similarly, in terms of V2P, the response time and detection of vulnerable
    road users by a self-driving car is a challenging issue that needs to be explored.
    In terms of drones, The main problem with UAV/drone communication is the energy
    limitation. It becomes more critical in situations like disaster management and
    mission critical infrastructures. A lot of work has been done in battery technologies
    but still there are gaps that needs to be addressed in the future by using beamforming
    techniques. Latency and reliability are the two main factors that needs to be
    ensured in UAV operations such as search and rescue, fire monitoring etc. in order
    to help the rescue teams and safeguard the survivors. Continuous video streaming
    in disaster situation needs a reliable connection between UAV and ground stations.
    Assurance of a reliable link will require ultra-low latency and ultra-high reliability
    that can be addressed in the next generation of cellular communication. Security
    and privacy problems such as eavesdropping, jamming and spoofing in aerial networks
    is another challenge in UAV communication. Lightweight techniques and AI solutions
    can be used to address these issues. Mobility support and collision avoidance
    in terms of Internet of UAVs are some of the other challenges that need to be
    researched in the future. Finally, in terms of healthcare, online consultation,
    robotic surgery and telemedicine requires a network that can support high-definition
    video streaming. In such cases ultra-low latency of less than 10ms and ultra-high
    reliable connection are required. Latency of less than 10ms is a critical challenge
    and an open research problem in future cellular communication. Reliable and real-time
    remote monitoring requires a high speed network and a reliable connection, otherwise
    practitioners will be unable to get the real-time data that can be used for quick
    and on-time healthcare decisions. Providing higher bandwidth and reliable connections
    are still an open problem that need to be addressed in future cellular networks.
    Integration of AI techniques for potential diagnosis (in the healthcare sector)
    that can lead to the best treatment plan is also a research area that needs to
    be explored. SECTION VII. Conclusions In this paper, we have explored 5G use-cases
    emphasizing on three main case studies: V2X communication, Drones, and Healthcare
    in order to identify the most challenging use-case for our future work. Starting
    with V2X communication, we explored V2V, V2P, V2I, and IV Communication along
    with their application areas. We also addressed the limitations and challenges
    of the existing communication technologies and proposed solutions based on 5G
    technologies. We further studied drone communication for mission critical infrastructures
    and provide a comparative analysis of 4G (LTE/LTE-A) and 5G with respect to control
    latency. Moreover, we examined healthcare with respect to 4G and 5G technologies
    and provide an overview of online consultation, online health monitoring, remote
    diagnosis, and mobile robotic surgery. Based on the literature review and critical
    analysis, we have concluded that drone communication for the provision and maintenance
    of critical infrastructures is the most challenging scenario that can be carried
    to the next phase of our work. In the future, we are planning to extend this work
    and propose to identify tools in which we can simulate our initial models in order
    to validate them and check their applicability for real-time applications. We
    also look forward to implementing the model in a real-time testbed. The potential
    impact on standard bodies along with community benefits is also part of our future
    plans. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like This Vehicle

    • SLR is conducted using PRISMA approach and148 articles are selected and critically
    analyzed. • The results show the extent of digital technologies adoption in agriculture.
    • The potential benefits of digital technologies and roadblocks hindering their
    implementation in agriculture sector are identified and discussed. • The study

    is considered one of the most important sectors that play a strategic role in
    ensuring food security. However, with the increasing world''s population, agri-food
    demands are growing — posing the need to switch from traditional agricultural
    methods to smart agriculture practices, also known as agriculture 4.0. To fully
    benefit from the potential of agriculture 4.0, it is significant to understand
    and address the problems and challenges associated with it. This study, therefore,
    aims to contribute to the development of agriculture 4.0 by investigating the
    emerging trends of digital technologies in the agricultural industry. For this
    purpose, a systematic literature review based on Protocol of Preferred Reporting
    Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses is conducted to analyse the scientific
    literature related to crop farming published in the last decade. After applying
    the protocol, 148 papers were selected and the extent of digital technologies
    adoption in agriculture was examined in the context of service type, technology
    readiness level, and farm type. The results have shown that digital technologies
    such as autonomous robotic systems, internet of things, and machine learning are
    significantly explored and open-air farms are frequently considered in research
    studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). Moreover, it is observed that most
    use cases are still in the prototypical phase. Finally, potential roadblocks to
    the digitization of the agriculture sector were identified and classified at technical
    and socio-economic levels. This comprehensive review results in providing useful
    information on the current status of digital technologies in agriculture along
    with prospective future opportunities. Previous article in issue Next article

    problem Food security is a multidimensional concept that alleviates hunger by
    ensuring a sustainable, nutritious food supply. It is characterized by a four-pillar
    model shown in Fig. 1, with each pillar intrinsic to ensure food security [1].

    full-size image Fig. 2. Agriculture value chain: stages and main functions. Due
    to several anthropogenic factors, such as rapid population growth, urbanization,
    industrialization, farmland loss, freshwater scarcity, and environmental degradation,
    food security is becoming a serious global issue. This is because these factors
    are also directly impacting agricultural industry which is a primary source of
    agri-food production around the world. It is anticipated that by 2050 global population
    will be increased from the current 7.7 billion to 9.2 billion, urban population
    will be rise by 66%, arable land will be declined by approximately 50 million
    hectares, global GHG emissions (source of CO2 – promote crop disease and pest
    growth) will be increased by 50%, agri-food production will be declined by 20%,
    and eventually, food demand will be increased by 59 to 98% – posing an imminent
    threat to food security and adequate food availability [2], [3], [4]. To satisfy
    the increasing food demands, agricultural practitioners worldwide will need to
    maximise the agricultural productivity involving crop and livestock farming. In
    this review paper, the focus is on crop farming that involves cultivation of both
    food and cash crops. A typical agri-food value chain depicting three primary stages,
    namely pre-field (pre-plantation stage), in-field (plantation and harvesting stage),
    and post-field (post-harvesting stage) involved in the production of agricultural
    products is shown in Fig. 2. All the stages play a vital role in the value chain
    but, in this review, the second stage ˝in-field˝ will be considered that involves
    several crop growing processes such as plowing, sowing, spraying, and harvesting,
    etc. These processes currently employ traditional agricultural practices that
    are labor-intensive, require arable land, time, and a substantial amount of water
    (for irrigation) – making it a challenge to produce enough agri-food [5]. A part
    of problem is also related to irregular use of pesticides and herbicides and misuse
    of available technology which cause harm to crop and eventually resulting in agricultural
    wastes [6]. These issues can be addressed by integrating sophisticated technologies
    and computer-based applications that ensure high crop yield, less water consumption,
    optimised pesticide/herbicide utilization, and enhanced crop quality. This is
    where the smart agriculture concept comes in. 1.2. Smart agriculture Industry
    4.0, also known as the fourth industrial revolution, is revolutionizing, and reshaping
    every industry. It is a strategic initiative characterized by a fusion of emerging
    disruptive digital technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), big data and
    analytics (BDA), system integration (SI), cloud computing (CC), simulation, autonomous
    robotic systems (ARS), augmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), wireless
    sensor networks (WSN), cyber-physical system (CPS), digital twin (DT), and additive
    manufacturing (AM) to enable the digitization of the industry [7]. The integration
    of these technologies in agriculture is sparking the next generation industrial
    agriculture, namely, agriculture 4.0 – also termed smart agriculture, smart farming,
    or digital farming [7]. Smart agriculture provides farmers with a diverse set
    of tools (shown in Fig. 3) to address several agricultural food production challenges
    associated with farm productivity, environmental impact, food security, crop losses,
    and sustainability. For instance, with IoT-enabled systems consisting of WSNs,
    farmers can connect to farms remotely irrespective of place and time to monitor
    and control farm operations. Drones equipped with hyperspectral cameras can be
    used to collect data from heterogeneous sources on farmlands and autonomous robots
    can be used to support or accomplish repetitive tasks at farms. Data analytics
    techniques can be employed to analyze the gathered data with computer applications
    can be used to assist farmers in decision-making process. Likewise, a wide variety
    of parameters related to environmental factors, weed control, crop production
    status, water management, soil conditions, irrigation scheduling, herbicides,
    and pesticides, and controlled environment agriculture can be monitored and analyzed
    in smart agriculture to increase crop yields, minimize costs, enhance product
    quality, and maintain process inputs through the use of modern systems [8]. Download

    The concept of “Smart Agriculture”. 1.3. Research motivation and contribution
    The motivation for preparing this review stems from the fact that digital technologies
    in agricultural systems offer new strategic solutions for enhancing the efficiency
    and effectiveness of farms’ production. Moreover, digital transformation provides
    a way forward to implement modern farming practices such as vertical farming (hydroponics,
    aquaponics and aeroponics), which has the potential to overcome food security
    problems. But there is a set of problems and limitations associated with this
    transformation from the technical, socio-economic, and management standpoint that
    must be death to fully exploit the potential of agriculture 4.0 [9]. There are
    number of studies that have discussed emerging trends in the development of agriculture
    4.0 by providing succinct information on key applications, advantages, and corresponding
    research challenges of smart farming [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15],
    [16], [17], [18]. The research focus of these studies is limited to either explaining
    more generic technical aspects while paying attention to only one or few digital
    technologies, and/or enhancing agricultural supply chain performance, and/or developing
    agriculture 4.0 definition, and/or achieving sustainable agronomy through precision
    agriculture, and/or proposing a smart farming framework. Nevertheless, these studies
    do not involve explicit discussion on the tools and techniques used to develop
    different systems and maturity level of these systems. There is also a lack of
    studies considering modern soilless farms such as hydroponics, aquaponics and
    aeroponics (indoor/outdoor) and implications of digital technologies in these
    farms. Hence, it is necessary to analyse the evolution of agriculture 4.0 from
    different perspectives to stimulate the discussion in the area. This study aims
    to present a holistic overview of digital technologies implemented in second stage
    of agricultural production value chain (in-field) for different types of farms
    as mentioned in section 1.1. The main theoretical contribution of the study involves
    analysis and dissemination of the tools and techniques employed, the farm type,
    the maturity level of the developed systems, along with potential roadblocks or
    inhibiting factors in development of agriculture 4.0. The reflections presented
    in the review will support researchers and agricultural practitioner in future
    research on agriculture 4.0. 1.4. Paper organization Following the introduction,
    the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the approach used to gather
    the relevant literature; then, Section 3 presents the statistical results obtained
    after a general analysis of the selected research studies; next, Section 4 provides
    a detailed overview of the core technologies used in the digitization of agriculture;
    after, Section 5 highlights the technical and socio-economic roadblocks to digital
    integration in agriculture; next, Section 6 outlines a discussion about the research
    questions followed by added value, considerations and future prospects related
    to agricultural digitization, and transition to agriculture 5.0; and lastly, Section
    8 concludes the review. 2. Research methodology A systematic literature review
    (SLR) is a tool used to manage the diverse knowledge and identify research related
    to a predetermined topic [19]. In this study, SLR is conducted to investigate
    the status of Industry 4.0 technologies in agricultural industry. Particularly,
    cases are searched where the term ‘agriculture’ appeared concurrently in the title,
    abstract, or keywords of an article with any of the ‘Industry 4.0 technologies”
    mentioned in section 1.2. Before conducting the SLR, a review protocol is defined
    to ensure a transparent and high-quality research process, which are the characteristics
    that make a literature review systematic [20]. The review protocol also helps
    to minimize bias by conducting exhaustive literature searches. This includes three
    steps: the formulation of the research questions, the definition of the search
    strategy, and the specification of inclusion and exclusion criteria. This paper
    uses a preferred reporting item for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA)
    approach to conduct SLR. PRISMA is an evidence-based minimum set of items that
    are used to guide the development process of systematic literature reviews and
    other meta-analyses [19]. 2.1. Review protocol A review protocol (in Table 1)
    is defined before conducting the bibliographic analysis to identify, evaluate,
    and interpret results relevant to the research scope. First, research questions
    are formulated to provide insight into the analysis of published studies in the
    research area of interest from different dimensions. These questions need to be
    answered in the study. Next, the search strategy is defined, which helps identify
    appropriate keywords later in the search equation to identify the relevant information
    sources, such as academic databases and search engines that provide access to
    a massive amount of digital documentation. Three online research repositories
    are used to retrieve relevant studies: ScienceDirect1, Scopus2, and IEEE Xplore3.
    Finally, to refine the search results of each database, boundaries are set by
    predefining inclusion and exclusion criteria for further investigation and content
    assessments of selected publications. It involves, for instance, defining the
    time interval for the research process from 2011 to 2021 to limit the studies
    to those published in English, disregarding chapters of books and grey literature,
    such as reports and summaries of events and seminars. These last two steps of
    the review protocol allow the preliminary filtering of metadata sources and narrow
    down the scope of research. Table 1. Review protocol for systematic literature
    review. Review questions RQ1: Which Industry 4.0 technologies have been used in
    the literature for digitization of agriculture? RQ2: How and to what extent have
    these technologies been applied in the context of service type, tools and techniques

    search process is done in four stages: identification, screening, eligibility,
    and inclusion, as detailed by the PRISMA flow diagram shown in Fig. 4. After initial
    metadata filtering through the application of search expression, a total of 3165
    records are found (1690 from Scopus, 926 from ScienceDirect, and 549 from IEEE
    Xplore), which are then consolidated for the removal of duplicate items in the
    identification stage. The number of publications after this step is reduced to
    2876. In the screening stage, the titles and abstracts of the papers are analyzed,
    and only 498 papers are selected for integral reading. In the third stage, full-text
    screening of these articles is performed to verify their eligibility in relation
    to the objective of this paper, which is to answer the research questions mentioned
    in Table 1. Of the 498 papers, 137 are found to be relevant for this review. Another
    11 are added through a cross-referencing approach, adding up to 148 papers selected
    in the final stage for further analysis. Download : Download high-res image (624KB)

    search process (PRISMA). 2.3. Threats to validity i SLR replication: The presented
    SLR is susceptible to threats to validity because the current search is limited
    to only three online repositories. More publications could potentially be found
    if additional sources were explored. The process of SLR is described clearly in
    sub-sections 2.1 and 2.2, and hence, validity can be considered well addressed.
    However, in the case of replication of this SLR, it is possible that one can find
    slightly different publications. This difference would result from different personal
    choices during the screening and eligibility steps of PRISMA, but it is highly
    unlikely that the overall findings would change. ii Search string: the search
    string used to find the relevant studies cover the whole scope of SLR, but there
    is a possibility that valuable studies might have been missed. Additional keywords
    and synonyms with a broader search might return more studies. 3. Digitization
    trends in agriculture The year-wise distribution of the 148 articles from 2011
    to 2021 is represented in Fig. 5. Around 22% of the scientific publications in
    the last ten years were published in 2018. This reflects that the agricultural
    industry is making considerable progress in the context of the implementation
    of digital technologies, but the pace is still slow as compared to other domains
    such as healthcare, manufacturing, mining, automotive, energy, etc.,[15]. Download

    Year-wise distribution of selected research studies from 2011 to 2021. The breakdown
    of these publications with respect to digital technologies (mentioned in sub-section
    1.2) and targeted farm types is represented in Fig. 6. Download : Download high-res
    image (321KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Technology-wise distribution
    of the 148 selected research studies. The farm type refers to the crop farming
    method considered while developing an application or framework. For instance,
    the farming method can be soil-based or soilless. The soil-based farming category
    involves open-air fields (traditional outdoor agricultural farms) and greenhouse
    farms (indoor). On the other hand, the soilless farming category involves modern
    farming practices such as aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics (mostly indoor).
    The numbers at the top of the stacked column in Fig. 6 indicate the total number
    of studies that have used the particular technology to develop a smart agriculture
    system, whereas different colors of columns indicate the respective farm types.
    Use cases are from these publications are analysed, and conclusions are drawn.
    For instance, it is found that autonomous robotics systems (including unmanned
    guided vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles (drones)), internet of things, and
    machine learning appear to be the widely applied technologies in the agricultural
    domain in the last decade. The same illustration suggests that big data, wireless
    sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and digital twins are the emerging areas
    in agriculture. Moreover, open-air farms are the most frequently considered in
    research studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). For soilless farming systems
    (aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics), only 22 publications are found, which
    insinuates that these modern farming practices are still in their infancy. Likewise,
    services of each use case are identified and are classified under nine different
    service categories, namely: i) crop management, CM (Estimation/ prediction of
    crop yield/ growth rate/ harvesting period and seed plantation/ harvesting/ pollination/
    spraying (fertilizer/ pesticide)); ii) crop quality management, CQM (fresh weight,
    green biomass, height, length, width, leaf density, piment content (chlorophyll)
    and phytochemical composition); iii) water and environment management, WEM (monitoring
    and control of flow rate, water level, water quality (nutrients), temperature,
    humidity, CO2, and weather forecast etc.); iv) irrigation management, IM (water
    stress detection and scheduling); v) farm management, FM (monitoring of farm operations,
    tracking and counting products, determining production efficiency, financial analysis,
    energy consumption analysis, technology integration and decisions implementation);
    vi) pest and disease management, PDM (pest identification and disease detection);
    vii) soil management, SM (moisture content, soil nutrients, fertilizer needs and
    application); viii) weed and unwanted vegetation management, WUVM (weed/unknown
    vegetation mapping, classification, and herbicides application); and ix) fruit
    detection and counting, FDC — as shown in Fig. 7. These categories illustrate
    the role of different digital technologies in smart farming. Upon analysis, it
    is found that crop management parameters, such as crop yield prediction, growth
    rate estimation, or evaluation of harvesting period are the most frequently researched
    areas for agriculture 4.0 in the last decade (29%), whereas very little heed is
    paid towards soil management (2%), fruit detection and counting (2%), and crop
    quality management (3%). Download : Download high-res image (561KB) Download :

    studies: The technology readiness level (TRL) of all the use cases is examined
    using European Union''s TRL scale that partitions system''s maturity level into
    three generic levels [21]. The first level is conceptual, that represents European
    TRL 1–2 (use case is in conceptual phase), the second level is the prototype,
    which means European TRL 3–6 (use case is working even without the complete planned
    functionality), and the third level is deployed, that includes European TRL 7–9
    (use case is mature with all the possible functions). Fig. 8 depicts the TRL of
    each use case developed in selected studies. It is observed that little progress
    has been made in advancing smart agricultural systems beyond the concept and prototype
    levels to the commercial level. For instance, most use cases (129) are at the
    prototype level. Download : Download high-res image (269KB) Download : Download

    provides critical insights towards answering RQ1 and RQ2 from Table 1. 4.1. Internet
    of Things driven agricultural systems Internet of things (IoT) refers to a cosmos
    of interrelated computing devices, sensors, appliances, and machines connected
    with the internet, each having unique identities and capabilities for performing
    remote sensing and monitoring [21]. The reference architecture of IoT with six
    layers, namely perception layer (hardware devices), network layer (communication),
    middleware layer (device management and interoperability), service layer (cloud
    computing), application layer (data integration and analytics), and end-user layer
    (user-interface), is shown in Fig.9. In the agricultural domain, IoT devices in
    the physical layer gather data related to environmental and crop parameters such
    as temperature, humidity, pH value, water level, leaf color, fresh leaf weight,
    etc. The transmission of this data takes place in the network layer, the design
    of which depends on the selection of suitable communication technologies relevant
    to the field size, farm location, and type of farming method. For instance, ZigBee,
    LoRa, and Sigfox are widely used and employed in outdoor fields because they are
    cheaper and have low energy consumption and a good transmission range [22,23].
    Despite being a secure technology, Bluetooth is only used in indoor farms as it
    offers a short transmission range [22]. Wi-Fi is not a promising technology for
    agricultural applications due to its high costs and high energy consumption [22].
    RFID (radio frequency identification) and NFC (near field communication) technologies,
    on the other hand, are increasingly being implemented in agricultural systems
    for tracking agricultural products [24]. GPRS or mobile communication technology
    (2G, 3G, and 4G) are used for periodic monitoring of environmental and soil parameters.
    In addition, communication protocols mostly used in the agricultural scenarios
    are HTTP, WWW, and SMTP. Likewise, to ensure interoperability and system security
    to their context-aware functionalities, middleware HYDRA and SMEPP are mostly
    employed in agricultural systems [25]. To store data, cloud computing techniques
    are employed in the service layer. This data is then used in the application layer
    to build smart applications used by farmers, agriculture experts, and supply chain
    professionals to enhance farm monitoring capacity and productivity. Download :

    architecture of Internet of Things (IoT), (adapted) [26]. The integration of IoT
    in agriculture is meant to empower farmers with the decision tools and automation
    technologies that seamlessly integrate knowledge, products, and services to achieve
    high productivity, quality, and profit. A multitude of studies is performed and
    put forward concerning the incubation of the IoT concepts in the agricultural
    sector. The main findings of some of the studies are presented in Table 2. Multiple
    technological issues and architectural problems have been addressed through the
    development of IoT-based agricultural systems. But most of these systems are either
    in a conceptual stage or in a prototype form (not commercial) at the moment. Focus
    is mainly laid on-farm management, irrigation control, crop growth, health monitoring,
    and disease detection. Some of these studies have also explained IoT implementation
    in modern agricultural systems such as vertical farming (soilless farming - aquaponics,
    hydroponics, and aeroponics) and greenhouse farming (soil-based). Moreover, most
    studies have focused on addressing a specific problem. Table 2. IoT-driven agricultural

    networks in agriculture Wireless sensor network (WSN) is regarded as a technology
    that is used within an IoT system. It can be defined as a group of spatially distributed
    sensors for monitoring the physical conditions of the environment, temporarily
    storing the collected data, and transmitting the gathered information at a central
    location [22]. The general architecture of WSN is shown in Fig. 10. A WSN for
    smart farming is made up of numerous sensor nodes connected through a wireless
    connection module. These nodes have a variety of abilities (e.g., processing,
    transmission, and sensation) that allow them to self-organize, self-configure,
    and self-diagnose. There are different types of WSNs, which are categorized depending
    on the environment where they are deployed. These include terrestrial wireless
    sensor networks (TWSNs), wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs), underwater
    wireless sensor networks (UWSNs), wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs),
    and mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs) [55]. In agricultural applications,
    TWSN and UWSN are widely used. In TWSNs, the nodes are deployed above the ground
    surface, consisting of sensors for gathering the surrounding data. The second
    variant of WSNs is its underground counterpart – WUSNs, where sensor nodes are
    planted inside the soil. In this setting, lower frequencies easily penetrate through
    the soil, whereas higher frequencies suffer severe attenuation [56]. Therefore,
    the network requires a higher number of nodes to cover a large area because of
    the limited communication radius. Many research articles are available in the
    literature that discusses the use of WSN for different outdoor and indoor farms’
    applications such as irrigation management, water quality assessment, and environmental
    monitoring. A summary of some of these articles is given in Table 3. These studies
    have focused on developing WSNs architectures that are simplified, low cost, energy-efficient
    and scalable. Yet, various factors associated with WSNs need further attention,
    such as minimum maintenance, robust and fault-tolerant architecture, and interoperability.

    Standard and Technologies (NIST), cloud computing (CC) is defined as a model for
    enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of
    configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications,
    and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management
    effort or service provider interaction [67]. The main architecture of CC shown
    in Fig. 11 is comprised of four layers: datacenter (hardware), infrastructure,
    platform, and application [68]. Each of these layers is linked with specific cloud
    service models, which are classified as software as a service (SaaS), platform
    as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). Cloud computing has
    gained great attention over the past decade in the agriculture sector because
    it provides: 1) inexpensive storage services for data gathered from different
    domains through WSNs and other preconfigured IoT devices, 2) large-scale computing
    systems to perform intelligent decision-making by transforming this raw data into
    useful knowledge, and 3) a secure platform to develop agricultural IoT applications
    [69]. In combination with IoT and WSN, CC is employed to develop different agricultural
    applications, most of which are presented in Tables 2 and 3. CC technology is
    also used to create operational farm management systems (FMSs) to support farmers
    and farm managers in efficient monitoring of farm operations Table 4. presents
    the salient features of some of these FMSs. Another topic of interest that is
    being explored in global research is related to the traceability of agri-product
    quality [70]. But only preliminary research has been attempted to explore traceability
    compliance with standards of food safety and quality. Download : Download high-res

    systems have the potential to solve problems of increasing food demands, environmental
    pollution caused by excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers, and the safety
    of agricultural products. These FMSs, however, do not have the capability to support
    run-time customization in relation to distinct requirements of farmers. Moreover,
    because most farm data is usually fragmented and dispersed, it is difficult to
    record farm activities properly in current FMSs applications [75]. 4.4. Edge/fog
    computing in agriculture The rapid development of IoT has led to the explosive
    growth of sensors and smart devices, generating large volumes of data. The processing
    and analysis of such an enormous amount of data in real-time are challenging because
    it increases the load on the cloud server and also reduces the response speed.
    Simply using a cloud server is not able to provide real-time response while handling
    such a large data set. Additionally, IoT applications are sensitive to network
    latency because they require a constant exchange of information between devices
    and the cloud, making CC unfeasible to handle these applications [23]. The emergence
    of the edge computing concept can resolve the problems associated with CC. This
    new computing model deploys computing and storage resources (such as cloudlets
    or fog nodes) at the edge of the network closer to data sources such as mobile
    devices or sensors. This way, it can facilitate real-time analytics while keeping
    data secure on the device [23]. Edge computing offers intriguing possibilities
    for smart agriculture, but the applications of this technology are only in their
    infancy in agricultural systems. Hence, few research studies are available in
    this area; see Table 5. Most of the edge computing-based agricultural systems
    discussed in these studies are prototypical and address a limited selection of
    problems in various agricultural domains. So far, interoperability and scalability
    issues have not received sufficient consideration. Table 5. Edge computing-based

    robot systems in agriculture Autonomous robot systems (ARS) are intelligent machines
    capable of performing tasks, making decisions, and acting in real-time, with a
    high degree of autonomy (without external influence or without explicit human
    intervention) [83]. Interest in agricultural ARS (AARS) has grown significantly
    in recent years because of their ability to automate some practices in outdoor
    and indoor farms - including seeding, watering, fertilizing, spraying, plant monitoring
    and phenotyping, environmental monitoring, disease detection, weed and pest controlling,
    and harvesting [15]. The agricultural robots use a combination of emerging technologies
    such as computer vision, WSNs, satellite navigation systems (GPS), AI, CC, and
    IoT, thereby facilitating the farmers to enhance productivity and quality of agricultural
    products. AARS in smart farming can be mobile AARS, which can move throughout
    the working field, or fixed AARS [84]. Mobile AARSs are further classified into
    unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) and 2) unnamed aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are
    explained in the following sections. 4.5.1. Unmanned ground vehicles in agriculture
    Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are agricultural robots that operate on the ground
    without a human operator. The main components of UGVs generally include; a platform
    for locomotive apparatus and manipulator, sensors for navigation, a supervisory
    control system, an interface for the control system, the communication links for
    information exchange between devices, and a system architecture for integration
    between hardware and software agents [85]. The control architecture of UGV can
    be remote-operated (controlled by a human operator via the interface) or fully
    autonomous (operated without the need for a human controller based on artificial
    intelligence technologies) [85]. Likewise, locomotive systems can be based on
    wheels, tracks, or legs [85]. Despite high ground adaptability, intrinsic omnidirectionality
    and soil protection of legged robots, they are uncommon in agriculture. However,
    when combined with wheels (wheel-legged robots), these robots offer a disruptive
    locomotion system for smart farms. In addition to their needed characteristics
    for infield operations, UGV should fulfill certain requirements such as small
    size, maneuverability, resilience, efficiency, human-friendly interface, and safety
    – to enhance crop yields and farm productivity. Table 6 summarizes the diverse
    range of UGVs designed for agricultural operations. Table 6. Different types of

    above have a 4WD locomotive system because it offers ease of construction and
    control. The drawback of 4WD is that the wheels are strongly affected by terrains
    containing stone elements and/or cavities [85]. Hence, it is significant to explore
    other mechanisms, such as legged or wheel-legged locomotive systems. Some robots
    have computer vision systems, but due to the difficulty of developing an accurate
    and reliable system that replaces manual labor, most of these robots are built
    with a low-cost computer vision system, that is, using conventional RGB cameras.
    Moreover, most of the systems mentioned above are still in the research phase,
    with no commercial use on a large scale. 4.5.2. Unmanned aerial vehicles in agriculture
    Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or aerial robots are aircrafts with no human pilot
    on board. Depending on the type of technology incorporated to fly (wing structure)
    and autonomy level, there is a wide variety of UAVs [96]. For instance, according
    to wing type, UAVs can be fixed-wing (planes), single-rotor (helicopter), hybrid
    system (vertical takeoff and landing), and multirotor (drone). Among these, drones
    (multi-rotor technology) which are lifted and propelled by four (quadrotor) or
    six (hex-rotor) rotors, have become increasingly popular in the agriculture sector
    due to their mechanical simplicity in comparison to helicopters, which rely on
    a much more sophisticated plate control mechanism [97]. Similarly, according to
    autonomy level, UAVs can be either teleoperated in which the pilot provides references
    to each actuator of the aircraft so as to control it, in the same manner, an onboard
    pilot would, or tele-commanded in which the aircraft relies on an automatic controller
    on board that is in charge of maintaining a stable flight [96]. Equipped with
    the appropriate sensors (vision, infrared, multispectral, and hyperspectral cameras,
    etc.), agricultural UAVs allow farmers to obtain data (vegetation, leaf area,
    and reflectance indexes) from their fields to study dynamic changes in crops that
    cannot be detected by scouting the ground [98]. This data permits farmers to infer
    information related to crop diseases, nutrient deficiencies, water level, and
    other crop growth parameters. With this information, farmers can plan possible
    remedies (irrigation, fertilization, weed control, etc.). Table 7 reviews some
    of the UAV-based systems used for different agricultural operations. Table 7.

    Most of the systems mentioned above are still in the research phase, with no commercial
    use on a large scale. Other problems with these UAVs are associated with battery
    and flight time [96]. At the moment, lithium-ion batteries are being used because
    their capacity is larger than that of conventional batteries. But an increase
    in battery capacity increases the drone weight, and now research is undergoing
    to address this issue. In addition, the existing UAVs have complex user interfaces,
    and only experts can use them to perform agricultural tasks. By improving the
    user interface making it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow people
    who are older or unfamiliar with UAV technology to control it more easily. 4.6.
    Big data and analytics in agriculture Rapid developments in IoT and CC technologies
    have increased the magnitude of data immeasurably. This data, also referred to
    as Big Data (BD), includes textual content (i.e., structured, semi-structured,
    and unstructured), and multimedia content (e.g., videos, images, audio) [119].
    The process of examining this data to uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations,
    market trends, customer preferences, and other useful information is referred
    to as big data analytics (BDA). Big data is typically characterized according
    to five dimensions defined by five Vs, which are displayed in Fig. 12 [120]. The
    paradigm of BD-driven smart agriculture is comparatively new, but the trend of
    this application is positive as it has the capacity to bring a revolutionary change
    in the food supply chain and food security through increased production. Agricultural
    big data is usually generated from various sectors and stages in agriculture,
    which can be collected either from agricultural fields through ground sensors,
    aerial vehicles, and ground vehicles using special cameras and sensors; from governmental
    bodies in the form of reports and regulations; from private organizations through
    online web services; from farmers in the form of knowledge through surveys; or
    from social media [120]. The data can be environmental (weather, climate, moisture
    level, etc.), biological (plant disease), or geo-spatial depending on the agricultural
    domain and differs in volume, velocity, and formats [121]. The gathered data is
    stored in a computer database and processed by computer algorithms for analyzing
    seed characteristics, weather patterns, soil properties (like pH or nutrient content),
    marketing and trade management, consumers’ behavior, and inventory management.
    A variety of techniques and tools are employed to analyze big data in agriculture.
    A summary of some of the studies is given in Table 8. Machine learning, cloud-based
    platforms, and modeling and simulation are the most commonly used techniques.
    Particularly, machine learning tools are used in prediction, clustering, and classification
    problems. Whereas cloud platforms are used for large-scale data storing, preprocessing,
    and visualization. There are still many potential areas that are not adequately
    covered in existing literature, where BDA can be applied to address various agricultural
    issues. For instance, these include data-intensive greenhouses and indoor vertical
    farming systems, quality control and health monitoring of crops in outdoor and
    indoor farms, genetic engineering, decision support platforms to assist farmers
    in the design of indoor vertical farms, and scientific models for policymakers
    to assist them in decision-making regarding the sustainability of the physical
    ecosystem. Lastly, most systems are still in the prototypical stage. Download

    involves the development of theory and computer systems capable of performing
    tasks requiring human intelligence, such as sensorial perception and decision-making
    [126]. Combined with CC, IoT, and big data, AI, particularly in the facet of machine
    learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), is regarded as one of the key drivers behind
    the digitization of agriculture. These technologies have the potential to enhance
    crop production and improve real-time monitoring, harvesting, processing, and
    marketing [127]. Several intelligent agricultural systems are developed that use
    ML and DL algorithms to determine various parameters like weed detection, yield
    prediction, or disease identification. These systems are discussed in the next
    two sub-sections. 4.7.1. Machine learning in agriculture Machine learning (ML)
    techniques are broadly classified into three categories: 1) supervised learning
    (linear regression, regression trees, non-linear regression, Bayesian linear regression,
    polynomial regression, and support vector regression), 2) unsupervised learning
    (k-means clustering, hierarchal clustering, anomaly detection, neural networks
    (NN), principal component analysis, independent component analysis, a-priori algorithm
    and singular value decomposition (SVD)); and 3) reinforcement learning (Markov
    decision process (MDP) and Q learning) [128]. ML techniques and algorithms are
    implemented in the agriculture sector for crop yield prediction, disease, and
    weed detection, weather prediction (rainfall), soil properties estimation (type,
    moisture content, pH, temperature, etc.), water management, determination of the
    optimal amount of fertilizer, and livestock production and management [129] Table
    9. presents a list of publications where different ML algorithms are utilized
    for various agricultural applications. From the analysis of these articles, “crop
    yield prediction” is a widely explored area, and linear regression, neural network
    (NN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) is the most used ML
    techniques to enable smart farming. The presented use cases are still in the research
    phase with no reported commercial usage at the moment. Moreover, it is also found
    that AI and ML techniques are sparsely explored in the greenhouse and indoor vertical
    farming systems, particularly hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics. There are
    only a few publications available summarized in the same table where ML techniques
    are employed. Considering the digital transformation''s cyber-security and data
    privacy challenges, new approaches such as federated learning and privacy-preserving
    methods are being developed to enable digital farming [130]. These approaches
    build ML models from local parameters without sharing private data samples, thus
    mitigating security issues. Table 9. Machine learning-based agricultural systems.

    the extension of classical ML that can solve complex problems (predictions and
    classification) particularly well and fast because more “depth” (complexity) is
    added into the model. The primary advantage of DL is feature learning which involves
    automatic extraction of features (high-level information) from large datasets
    [149]. Different DL algorithms are convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long
    short term memory (LSTM) networks, recurrent neural (RNN) networks, generative
    adversarial networks (GANs), radial basis function networks (RBFNs), multilayer
    perceptron (MLPs), feedforward artificial neural network (ANN), self-organizing
    maps (SOMs), deep belief networks (DBNs), restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs),
    and autoencoders. A detailed description of these algorithms, popular architectures,
    and training platforms is available at various sources [150]. Fig. 13 illustrates
    an example of DL architecture of CNN [151]. In the agriculture sector, DL algorithms
    are mostly used to solve problems associated with computer vision applications
    that target the prediction of key parameters, such as crop yields, soil moisture
    content, weather conditions, and crop growth conditions; the detection of diseases,
    pests, and weed; and the identification of leaf or plant species [152]. Computer
    vision is an interdisciplinary field that has been gaining huge amounts of traction
    in recent years due to the surge in CNNs. It offers methods and techniques that
    allow the processing of digital images accurately and enables computers to interpret
    and understand the visual world [153]. A summary of agricultural applications
    using DL and computer vision techniques is given in Table 10. Among all the DL
    algorithms, CNNs or Convet and its variants are the most used algorithms in agricultural
    applications. The variants of CNN are region-based CNNs (RCNN), Fast-RCNN, Faster-RCNN,
    YOLO, and Mask-RCNN, among which the first four are mostly used to solve object
    detection problems. Mask-RCNN, on the other hand, is used to solve instance segmentation
    problems. The reader could refer to the existing bibliography for a detailed description
    of these algorithms and their applications [152]. Few studies have also used other
    DL techniques. Talking about datasets, most DL models are trained using images,
    and few models are trained using sensor data gathered from fields. This shows
    that DL can be applied to a wide variety of datasets. It is also observed that
    most of the work is done on outdoor farms, whereas next-generation farms (environment-controlled)
    are not extensively explored. Though DL has the potential to enable digital farming,
    most systems are still in the prototype phase. Additionally, the new challenges
    imposed by cyber-security and privacy issues require optimization of current DL
    and computer vision approaches. Download : Download high-res image (334KB) Download

    decision support systems A decision support system (DSS) can be defined as a smart
    system that supports decision-making to specific demands and problems by providing
    operational answers to stakeholders and potential users based on useful information
    extracted from raw data, documents, personal knowledge, and/or models [170]. DSS
    can be data-driven, model-driven, communication-driven, document-driven, and knowledge-driven.
    The salient features of these DSSs are available at following source [171]. Fig.
    14 presents the general architecture of a DSS, consisting of four fundamental
    components, each having its specific purpose. Download : Download high-res image

    data has increased immensely. To transfer this heterogenous data into practical
    knowledge, platforms like agricultural decision support systems (ADSS) are required
    to make evidence-based and precise decisions regarding farm operation and facility
    layout [172]. Over the past few years, ADSSs are gaining much attention in the
    agriculture sector. A number of ADSSs have been developed that focus on a variety
    of agricultural aspects, such as farm management, water management, and environmental
    management. Table 11 presents a summary of the ADSSs found in the literature.
    From this analysis, most ADSSs have been found to not consider expert knowledge,
    which is highly valuable as it allows to development of systems as per user''s
    needs. The other reported issues with some of these ADDSs are complex GUIs, inadequate
    re-planning components, a lack of prediction and forecast abilities, and a lack
    of ability to adapt to uncertain and dynamic factors. It is also worth noting
    that all the ADSSs are for outdoor agricultural systems and are in the research
    phase. In comparison, the application of ADSS in indoor soilless farming is still
    very much unexploited. Table 11. Agricultural decision support systems. Use case

    As one of the main technologies of Industry 4.0, a cyber-physical system (CPS)
    refers to an automated distributed system that integrates physical processes with
    communication networks and computing infrastructures [184]. There are three standard
    CPS reference architecture models: namely, 5C, RAMI 4.0, and IIRA, and their detailed
    description is available at following source [185]. Among these, the 5C is a well-known
    reference model with widespread usage. The architecture of 5C consists of five
    levels which are represented in Fig. 15. CPS benefits from a variety of existing
    technologies such as agent systems, IoT, CC, augmented reality, big data, and
    ML [186]. Its implementation ensures scalability, adaptability, autonomy, reliability,
    resilience, safety, and security improvements. Download : Download high-res image

    process, (adapted) [199]. Agricultural field is regarded as one of the complex
    domains that can benefit from CPS technology. Agricultural cyber-physical systems
    (ACPSs) use advanced electronic technologies and agricultural facilities to build
    integrated farm management systems that interact with the physical environment
    to maintain an optimal growth environment for crops [188]. ACPSs collect the essential
    and appropriate data about climate, soil, and crops, with high accuracy and use
    it to manage watering, humidity, and plant health, etc. A variety of ACPSs has
    been developed for the management of different services, and their summary is
    given in Table 12. Looking at these ACPSs, most systems are still at the prototype
    and conceptual level. Moreover, most studies are conducted for outdoor farms,
    with only a few works published related to soil-based greenhouse systems. No study
    is found that is relevant to indoor soilless farming systems. ACPSs has attracted
    significant research interest because of their promising applications across different
    domains; deploying CPS models in real-life applications is still a challenge as
    it requires proper hardware and software [189]. Moreover, particular attention
    should be given to autonomy, robustness, and resilience while engineering ACPSs
    in order to handle the unpredictability of the environment and the uncertainty
    of the characteristics of agricultural facilities. There are multiple factors
    (humans, sensors, robots, crops, and data, among others) that impact ACPSs. To
    ensure a smooth operation while avoiding conflicts, errors, and disruptions, ACPSs
    need to be designed carefully and comprehensively. Table 12. Agricultural cyber-physical

    in agriculture Digital twin (DT) is a dynamic virtual replica of a real-life (physical)
    object of which it mirrors its behaviors and states over multiple stages of object''s
    lifecycle by using real-world data, simulation, and machine learning models, combined
    with data analytics to enable understanding, learning, and reasoning [198]. A
    complete description of the DT concept for any physical system requires consolidation
    and formalization of various characteristics, including the physical and virtual
    entities, the physical and virtual environments, the metrology, and realization
    modules that perform the physical to virtual and the virtual to physical connection
    or twinning, the twinning and twinning rate, and the physical and virtual processes
    [199]. The schematic showing the mapping of these characteristics is shown in
    Fig. 16. The DT concept has gained prominence due to the advances in the technologies
    such as the Internet of Things, big data, wireless sensor networks, and cloud
    computing. This is because these technologies allow real-time monitoring of physical
    twins at high spatial resolutions through both miniature devices and remote sensing
    that produce ever-increasing data streams [21]. The concept of DT in agricultural
    applications is rather immature as compared to other disciplines with its first
    references occurred in 2017; hence its added value has not yet been discussed
    extensively [21]. This is because framing is a highly complex and dynamic domain
    because of its dependence on natural conditions (climate, soil, humidity) and
    presence of living physical twins (plants and animals) and non-living physical
    twins (indoor farm buildings, grow beds, outdoor agricultural fields, agricultural
    machinery). The non-living physical twins interact directly or indirectly with
    plants and animals (living physical twins), thereby introducing more challenges
    for DT in agriculture. Whereas in other domains such as manufacturing DTs are
    mostly concerned with non-living physical twins. Table 13 summarises the agricultural
    DTs developed in the last 10 years. Table 13. Digital twins in agriculture Use

    computational units Prototype Open-air [207] The analysis shows that most studies
    have focused on open-air farming systems. Only one study is found that has proposed
    DT for soil-based vertical farming system and one study that implemented DT for
    soilless farming system (aquaponics). This might be because the design and management
    of modern farming systems are challenging. Moreover, most DTs are in the research
    phase with no commercial deployment at the moment. The reported benefits of the
    DT applications in agriculture are cost reductions, catastrophe prevention, clearer
    decision making, and efficient management operations, which can be applied to
    several agricultural subfields like plant and animal breeding, aquaponics, vertical
    farming, cropping systems, and livestock farming. While DT technology has great
    potential, achieving the synchronization between the physical entity and its digital
    counterpart is challenging. The complexity of this process is further amplified
    in agricultural systems due to the idiosyncrasies of living physical twins. Hence,
    implementation of agricultural DT should start with micro-farms, which can then
    be gradually enhanced to an intelligent and autonomous version by incorporating
    more components. 4.11. Roadblocks in digitization of agriculture industry This
    section provides an answer to RQ3 by listing a series of interconnected roadblocks
    hampering a larger adoption of digital technologies in the agriculture sector.
    After analysing 148 articles, 21 roadblocks are identified which can be categorized
    at technical and socio-economic levels. 4.12. Technical roadblocks • Interoperability:
    data is considered a cornerstone for the success of smart systems. Agricultural
    data usually comes from multiple heterogeneous sources such as thousands of individual
    farmlands, animal factories, and enterprise applications. This data can have diverse
    formats, making data integration complex. Hence, data interoperability is essential
    to enhance the value of this massively dispersed data after systematic data collection,
    storage, processing, and knowledge mining [208]. Likewise, for establishing effective
    communication between heterogeneous devices, they need to be interconnected and
    interoperable. With cross-technology communication, interoperability of the system
    can be improved [209]. • Standardization: to fully exploit the digital technologies
    for smart farming applications, standardization of the devices is essential. Output
    differences can occur because of misinterpretation and alterations from time to
    time. With standardization, the interoperability issues of the devices, applications,
    and systems can also be resolved [25]. • Dataquality: to produce meaningful results,
    data quality is also crucial along with data security, storage, and openness.
    The lack of decentralized data management systems is another roadblock hindering
    the adoption of smart farming practices [9]. This issue decreases the willingness
    of multiple actors to share agriculture data. • Hardwareimplementation: the deployment
    of a smart agricultural setup in large-scale open fields is extremely challenging.
    This is because all the hardware consisting of IoT devices, wireless sensor networks,
    sensor nodes, machinery, and equipment directly exposed to harsh environmental
    conditions such as heavy rainfall, high/low-temperature levels, extreme humidity,
    strong wind speeds and many other possible dangers which can destroy electronic
    circuits or disrupt their normal functionality [210]. A possible solution is to
    build an adequate casing for all the costly devices that is robust and durable
    enough to endure real field conditions [211]. • Adequatepower sources: typically,
    the wireless devices deployed at farms consistently operate for a long time and
    have limited battery life. A suitable energy saving scheme is necessary because,
    in case of any failure, instant battery replacement is complicated, especially
    in open-air farms where devices are strategically placed with minimum access [210].
    The possible solutions to optimize energy consumption are usage of low power sensors
    and, proper management of communication [24,212]. Wireless power transfer and
    self-supporting wireless system are other promising solutions to eliminate the
    need for battery replacement by recharging the batteries through electromagnetic
    waves. However, long-distance wireless charging is needed in most agricultural
    applications [9]. Ambient energy harvesting from rivers, fluid flow, movement
    of vehicles and, ground surface using sensor nodes offers another viable solution,
    but the converted electrical energy is limited at present – posing the need to
    improve power conversion efficiency [213]. • Reliability: The reliability of devices,
    as well as corresponding software applications, is crucial. This is because IoT
    devices need to gather and transfer the data based on which decisions are made
    using several software packages. Unreliable sensing, processing, and transmission
    can cause false monitoring data reports, long delays, and even data loss – eventually
    impacting the performance of agricultural system [25]. • Adaptability: agricultural
    environments are complex, dynamic, and rapidly changing. Hence, when designing
    a system, it is pertinent for the devices and applications to proactively adapt
    with the other entities under uncertain and dynamic factors - offering the needed
    performance [214]. • Robust wirelessarchitectures: wireless networks and communication
    technologies offer several benefits in terms of low cost, wide-area coverage,
    adequate networking flexibility, and high scalability. But dynamic agriculture
    environments such as temperature variations, living objects’ movements, and the
    presence of obstacles pose severe challenges to reliable wireless communication.
    For instance, fluctuations in the signal intensity occur due to the multipath
    propagation effects – causing unstable connectivity and inadequate data transmission
    [215]. These factors impact the performance of the agricultural system. Hence,
    there is a need for robust and fault-tolerant wireless architectures with appropriate
    location of sensor nodes, antenna height, network topology, and communication
    protocols that also require minimum maintenance [11]. • Interference: another
    challenge is wireless interference and degradation of the quality of service because
    of the dense deployment of IoT devices and wireless sensor networks. These issues
    can be mitigated with efficient channel scheduling between heterogeneous sensing
    devices, cognitive radio-assisted WSNs, and emerging networking primitives such
    as concurrent transmission [216]. Since agriculture devices are distributed at
    indoor greenhouses, outdoor farmlands, underground areas, or even water areas,
    cross-media communication between underground, underwater, and air is also required
    for the complete incorporation of smart technologies [217]. • Security and privacy:
    the distributed nature of smart agricultural systems brings potential vulnerabilities
    to cyber-attacks such as eavesdropping, data integrity, denial-of-service attacks,
    or other types of disruptions that may risk privacy, integrity, and availability
    of the system [218]. Cyber-security is a major challenge that needs to be addressed
    within the context of smart farming, with diverse privacy-preserving mechanisms
    and federated learning approaches [130]. • Compatibility: to achieve the standards
    of fragmentation and scalability, the models or software applications developed
    should be flexible and run on any machine installed in the agricultural system
    [13]. • Resource optimization: farmers require a resource optimization process
    to estimate the optimal number of IoT devices and gateways, cloud storage size,
    and amount of transmitted data to improve farm profitability. Since farms have
    different sizes and need distinct types of sensors to measure different variables,
    resource optimization is challenging [219]. Secondly, most of the farm management
    systems do not offer run-time customization in relation to the distinct requirements
    of farmers. Hence, complex mathematical models and algorithms are required to
    estimate adequate resource allocation [75]. • Scalability: the number of devices,
    machinery, and sensors installed at farms is increasing gradually due to advancements
    in technologies. To support these entities, gateways, network applications, and
    back-end databases should be reliable and scalable [220]. • Human-centereduserinterfaces:
    complex user interfaces of existing agricultural applications and devices are
    impeding smart farming practices. Most GUI is designed in a way that only experts
    can use to perform agricultural tasks. Improving the user interface by making
    it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow a larger group of people
    to use it to perform different agricultural operations [96]. 4.13. Socio-economic
    roadblocks • Gap between farmers and researchers: the participation of farmers
    is a key factor toward the success of the digitization of the agricultural industry.
    Farmers face a lot of problems during the agri-food production process, which
    smart technologies could fix, but agricultural experts are not usually aware of
    these issues [16]. Moreover, to devise an adequate smart solution, first, it is
    important to fully understand the nature of problems. Hence, it is essential to
    bridge the gap between farmers, agricultural professionals, and AI researchers.
    • Costs associated with smart systems: the costs associated with the adoption
    of smart technologies and systems are the major deterrent in the digitization
    of the agricultural sector. These costs usually involve deployment, operating,
    and maintenance costs. The deployment costs of smart systems are usually very
    high as they involve; i) hardware installation such as autonomous robots and drones,
    WSNs, gateways, and base station infrastructure, etc., to perform certain farm
    operations, and ii) hiring the skilled labour [221]. Likewise, to facilitate data
    processing, management of IoT devices and equipment, and knowledge exchange, subscription
    of centralized networks and software packages is required, which ultimately increases
    the operating costs [222]. Though sometimes service providers offer free subscription
    packages with restricted features, the amount of storage capacity is limited.
    To ensure the adequate operations of the smart system, occasional maintenance
    is required, which then also adds up to total costs. Other types of costs associated
    with smart systems deployment could be environmental, ethical, and social costs.
    To overcome cost related roadblocks, initiatives focusing on cooperative farming
    are needed that provide; i) support services for better handling of costs and
    needed investments, and ii) hardware solutions to transform conventional equipment
    into smart farm-ready machinery to reduce high initial costs [222]. • Digital
    division: another factor that is slowing the digitization of the agricultural
    sector is the lack of knowledge of digital technologies and their applications.
    The majority of farmers have no idea about the significance of digital technologies,
    how to implement and use them, and which technology is suitable for their farm
    and meets their requirements [14]. Hence, it is essential to educate farmers about
    modern farming technologies and systems. Moreover, different strategies are needed
    to build tools using natural language that farmers with low education levels can
    easily understand [223]. • Return on investment: in agriculture, the profit margin
    is very important like other sectors. When it comes to the implementation of advanced
    technologies, farmers have concerns related to the time to recover the investment
    and to the difficulties in evaluating the advantages [12]. • Trust building: unlike
    in other disciplines, building trust regarding the effectiveness of smart technologies
    in agriculture is difficult because many decisions affect systems that involve
    living and non-living entities, and consequences can be hard to reverse [16].
    Additionally, insufficient proof of the impact of digital tools on-farm productivity
    further intensifies the current challenges. • Laws and regulations: different
    regions and countries have different legal frameworks which impact the implementation
    of digital technologies in the agriculture sector, particularly in monitoring
    and agri-food supply [70]. Likewise, regulations related to resource allocation
    (spectrum for wireless devices), data privacy, and security also vary from one
    country to another [70]. • Connectivity infrastructure: most less-developed countries
    usually have insufficient connectivity infrastructure that limits access to advanced
    digital tools that would help to turn data from heterogenous sources into valuable
    and actionable insights [10]. 4.14. Discussion This section discusses the main
    conclusions of RQ1, RQ2, and RQ3. In addition, added value, considerations, and
    future directions are also presented to ensure higher accuracy and great advancements
    in agricultural industry. 4.15. RQ1, RQ2 and RQ3 The present study tried to articulate
    the emerging digital technologies being implemented in agricultural industry to
    anticipate the future trajectories of agriculture 4.0. By looking at Table 2,
    Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, Table 8, Table 9, Table 10, Table
    11, Table 12, Table 13 in section 4, it can be seen some technologies such as
    big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and
    digital twins are not significantly explored in agriculture. A reason for this
    gap could be that implementing advanced technologies with more complex operations
    can be expensive, at least in the early experimental phase of their adoption.
    Hence, the development of these technologies in agricultural industry should increase
    in the coming years. The results of SLR also show that IoT is significantly implemented
    in farms. This is due to the broad functionality of IoT such as in the monitoring,
    tracking and tracing, agriculture machinery, and precision agriculture [21]. It
    can be said that IoT is one of the main research objectives within the agriculture
    4.0 approaches. Nevertheless, only few studies have considered data security and
    reliability, scalability, and interoperability while developing an intelligent
    agricultural system. The research findings also demonstrated that most use cases
    are still in the prototype phase. The possible reason could be because most agricultural
    operations have to do with living subjects, like animals and plants or perishable
    products, and developing systems is harder than non-living human-made systems.
    Another reason might be that agriculture is a slow adopter of technology because
    of transdisciplinary nature of this field, and hence to develop intelligent systems,
    the agricultural community must become familiar will all the digital technologies.
    Lastly, variations in plant/crops’ species, and growth conditions also make digitization
    of agricultural systems complex [188]. The SLR findings also show that most of
    the systems are developed for open-air soil-based farms contrary to indoor farms
    (soilless and soil-based). This is due to complex design and management of indoor
    farms particularly soilless farms where parameters and factors (pH, air temperature,
    humidity, etc.) to be controlled are diverse [5]. But with introduction of digital
    technologies and data-driven computer applications in indoor farms, a more robust
    control of the process can be achieved. Furthermore, it is also revealed from
    SLR that limited research is conducted in three (soil management, fruit detection
    and counting and crop quality management) out of nine different service categories
    mentioned in section 3. This corroborates that substantial research and development
    is needed in some areas to ensure successful digitization of agriculture industry
    in developed countries as well as in developing countries. The complexity of agriculture
    ecosystem presents a series of interconnected roadblocks that hinder the full
    integration of digital technologies for agriculture 4.0 realization. Hence, it
    is essential to identify potential roadblocks in order to come up with strategic
    solutions to overcome them. This study is an attempt to explore what these roadblocks
    are. Based on analysis, 21 roadblocks were identified and classified at technical
    and socio-economic levels. These roadblocks are listed in section 5, which suggests
    what needs to be done for digitization of agricultural industry on larger scale.
    But it is still not known, to what extent elimination or mitigation of these roadblocks
    assist in successful integration of digital technologies. 4.16. Added value of
    agricultural digitization Based on analysis, several benefits that can motivate
    framers and other actors to support digitization of agricultural industry are
    identified and summarised below. The presented benefits have potential to maximise
    the farm''s productivity and enhance product quality, but they should not be considered
    a panacea for challenges associated with smart agriculture [222]. • Improved agility:
    digital technologies improve the agility of farm operations. Through real-time
    surveillance and forecast systems, farmers or agricultural experts can rapidly
    react to any potential fluctuations in environmental and water conditions to save
    crops [221]. • Green process: digital technologies make the farming process more
    environmentally friendly and climate-resilient by significantly reducing the usage
    of in-field fuel, nitrogen fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides [224]. • Resource
    use efficiency: digital platforms can improve resource use efficiency by enhancing
    the quantity and quality of agricultural output and limiting the usage of water,
    energy, fertilizers, and pesticides [3]. • Time and cost savings: digital technologies
    enable significant time and cost savings by automating different operations, such
    as harvesting, sowing, or irrigation, controlling the application of fertilizers
    or pesticides, and scheduling the irrigation [225]. • Asset management: digital
    technologies allow real-time surveillance of farm properties and equipment to
    prevent theft, expedite component replacement and perform routine maintenance
    [10]. • Product safety: digital technologies ensure adequate farm productivity
    and guarantee a safe and nutritious supply of agri-food products by preventing
    fraud related to adulteration, counterfeit, and artificial enhancement [218].
    4.17. Considerations and future prospects The upcoming initiatives would result
    in significant improvements in the agricultural sector. But in order to make things
    sustainable for small and medium-scale growers, roadblocks mentioned in section
    5 need to be addressed first. Awareness campaigns highlighting the significance
    of smart agriculture at every level of the agricultural value chain and promoting
    innovative ways (such as gamification) to encourage stakeholders to take on an
    active role in the digital revolution can mitigate some of the mentioned roadblocks
    [9]. Government level initiatives, grants and endowments, public-private partnerships,
    the openness of data, and regional basis research work can also assist in coping
    with potential roadblocks. Lastly, a roadmap can be adopted while developing a
    smart agriculture system, starting from basic architecture with few components
    and simpler functionality, gradually adding components and functionality to develop
    a complex system with the full potential of digitization [21]. These considerations
    can pave the way for successful implementation of agriculture 4.0. The future
    prospects of digital technologies in smart agriculture involve using explainable
    artificial intelligence to monitor crop growth, estimate crop biomass, evaluate
    crop health, and control pests and diseases. Explainable AI fades away the traditional
    black-box concept of machine learning and enables understanding the reasons behind
    any specific decision [15]. Description of big data through common semantics and
    ontologies and the adoption of open standards have great potential to boost research
    and development towards smart farming . Similarly, to ensure enhanced connectivity
    and live streaming of crop data, 5G technology need to be extensively explored
    [6]. 5G technology will minimize internet costs and augment the overall user experience
    of farm management and food safety by performing accurate crop inspections remotely
    [226]. Furthermore, it will significantly bridge the gap between stakeholders
    by keeping them well informed on produce availability. Lastly, blockchain in combination
    with IoT and other technologies can be implemented to address the challenges related
    to data privacy and security [227]. 4.18. Transition to Agriculture 5.0 The industrial
    revolutions have always brought a breakthrough in the agricultural sector. As
    formally discussed in previous sections, agriculture 4.0 has great potential to
    counterbalance the growing food demands and prepare for future by reinforcing
    agricultural systems with WSN, IoT, AI, etc. While the realization of agriculture
    4.0 is still underway, there is already a talk about agriculture 5.0. Agriculture
    5.0 extends agriculture 4.0 with inclusion of industry 5.0 principles to produce
    healthy and affordable food while ensuring to prevent degradation of the ecosystems
    on which life depends [228]. The European Commission formally called for the Fifth
    Industrial Revolution (industry 5.0) in 2021 after observing that industry 4.0
    focuses less on the original principles of social fairness and sustainability
    but more on digitalization and AI-driven technologies for increasing the efficiency
    and flexibility [229]. Industry 5.0 complements and extends industry 4.0 concept
    to recognize the human-centricity, sustainability, and resilience [230]. It involves
    refining the collaborative interactions between humans and machines, reducing
    environmental impact through circular economy, and developing high degree of robustness
    in systems to achieve optimal balance between efficiency and productivity. The
    enabling technologies of industry 5.0 are Cobots (collaborative robots), smart
    materials with embedded bio-inspired sensors, digital twins, AI, energy efficient
    and secure data management, renewable energy sources, etc [229].. In agriculture
    5.0 settings, farm''s production efficiency and crop quality can be enhanced by
    assigning repetitive and monotonous tasks to the machines and the tasks which
    need critical thinking to the humans. For this purpose, similar to manufacturing
    sector cyber physical cognitive systems (CPCS) that observe/study the environment
    and take actions accordingly should be developed for agricultural sector. This
    may include collaborative farm robots which will work in the fields and assist
    crop producers in tedious tasks such as seed sowing and harvesting etc. Likewise,
    digital twins in agriculture 5.0 can also offer significant value by identifying
    technical issues in agricultural systems and overcoming them at a faster speed,
    detecting crop diseases, and making crop yield predictions at a higher accuracy
    rate. This shows that agriculture 5.0 has potential to pave a way for climate
    smart, sustainable and resilient agriculture but as of now, it is in the developing
    phase. 5. Conclusions Increased concerns about global food security have accelerated
    the need for next-generation industrial farms and intensive production methods
    in agriculture. At the forefront of this modern agricultural era, digital technologies
    offered by Industry 4.0 initiative are suggesting a myriad of creative solutions.
    The scientific community and researchers integrate disruptive technologies in
    conventional agriculture systems to increase crop yields, minimize costs, reduce
    wastes, and maintain process inputs. An SLR discussing the prevailing state of
    these technologies in the agriculture sector is presented in this study. After
    applying SLR protocol, 148 articles were considered from the time frame of the
    year 2011 to 2021. Various research questions pertaining to i) current and continuing
    research trends, ii) functionality, maturity level, farm type and tools and techniques
    used, iii) primary roadblocks, and iv) added value of digital technologies; were
    put forward and answered. Several conclusions are drawn such as integration of
    big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and
    digital twins in agriculture is only in its infancy, and most use cases are in
    the prototype phase. Likewise, 21 roadblocks are identified and classified at
    technical and socioeconomic levels. To ensure the digitization of agricultural
    industry, these roadblocks must be analyzed and overcome. The added value of digital
    technologies in agriculture industry are also identified and presented in the
    study. Overall, this study contributes to the research being carried around agriculture
    4.0. The primary limitation of this review is twofold: firstly, only three online
    repositories are considered for literature search (Scopus, IEEE and Science Direct),
    and secondly additional keywords and synonyms might return more studies. In both
    scenarios, it is highly unlikely that the overall findings would change. For the
    future work, additional research databases and aspects can be considered to provide
    holistic overview of agricultural industry in terms of digitization. Moreover,
    studies targeting agriculture 5.0 in general will also be included. Declaration

    The Vertical Farm: A Review of Developments and

    Implications for the Vertical City

    Abstract: This paper discusses the emerging need for vertical farms by examining
    issues related to

    food security, urban population growth, farmland shortages, “food miles”, and
    associated greenhouse

    gas (GHG) emissions. Urban planners and agricultural leaders have argued that
    cities will need to

    produce food internally to respond to demand by increasing population and to avoid
    paralyzing

    congestion, harmful pollution, and unaffordable food prices. The paper examines
    urban agriculture

    as a solution to these problems by merging food production and consumption in
    one place, with the

    vertical farm being suitable for urban areas where available land is limited and
    expensive. Luckily,

    recent advances in greenhouse technologies such as hydroponics, aeroponics, and
    aquaponics

    have provided a promising future to the vertical farm concept. These high-tech
    systems represent

    a paradigm shift in farming and food production and offer suitable and efﬁcient
    methods for city

    farming by minimizing maintenance and maximizing yield. Upon reviewing these technologies
    and

    examining project prototypes, we ﬁnd that these efforts may plant the seeds for
    the realization of

    the vertical farm. The paper, however, closes by speculating about the consequences,
    advantages,

    and disadvantages of the vertical farm’s implementation. Economic feasibility,
    codes, regulations,

    and a lack of expertise remain major obstacles in the path to implementing the
    vertical farm.

    Keywords: advanced cultivation methods; innovative technologies; efﬁcient food
    production; urban

    population increase; sustainability

    1. Introduction

    1.1. Background

    This research stems from a larger research project that examined vertical density
    applications to

    the 21st Century City [1–3]. As cities try to cope with rapid population growth—adding
    2.5 billion

    dwellers by 2050—and grapple with destructive sprawl, politicians, planners and
    architects have

    become increasingly interested in the vertical city paradigm. Unfortunately, cities
    all over the world

    are grossly unprepared for embracing vertical density, because it may aggravate
    multidimensional

    sustainability challenges resulting in a “vertical sprawl” that could have worse
    consequences than

    “horizontal” sprawl. One key problem of future cities will be transporting large
    amount of food to

    serve dense population, and the vertical farm model offers a potential solution
    to this problem [1–5].

    1.2. Goals and Scope of the Study

    As urban population continues to grow and as arable land is diminishing rapidly
    across the

    globe, a fundamental change in food production is needed [4–7]. In particular,
    building-based

    urban agriculture is increasingly needed in dense urban environments and a review
    of current

    cultivation techniques and projects would likely to contribute positively to academic
    discussions [6–10].

    This is particularly important since vertical farming engages multiple disciplines
    of natural sciences,

    architecture, and engineering and affects both people and the environment [9–11].
    This paper attempts

    to answer the following questions:

    •

    What is a vertical farm?

    •

    What are the driving forces for building it?

    •

    What are the involved high-tech farming methods?

    •

    What are the salient project examples on vertical farming?

    •

    What are the implications for the vertical city?

    1.3. Methods

    Currently, we witness a growing body of research on vertical farming. Studies
    and updates on

    the topic come in multiple forms including academic papers, professional reports,
    news articles, blogs,

    and websites, as demonstrated in this paper references. This paper pieces together
    these materials in

    attempt to answer the above questions. It examines a wide-range of literatures
    related to agronomy,

    urban agriculture, vertical farming, and rooftop farming. It also reviews involved
    technologies, current

    cultivation techniques, business models, and analyzes research projects.

    This study evolved from anecdotal observations to systematic examination of involved

    technologies, actual and visionary projects of vertical farming. In the preliminary
    stage, surﬁng

    the Internet (website, blogs, movie clips) excited and fueled the research by
    informing about recent

    projects that utilize advanced technology. This sparked systematic examination
    of generic (secondary)

    and specialized (primary) literatures on vertical farming by using various online
    search engines and

    databases including Scopus, ProQuest, and Google Scholar. Researchers collected
    over 100 sources.

    These sources comprised 42% peer-reviewed academic journal articles, 28% books
    and book chapters,

    6% theses, 9% conference papers, and 15% websites. Most of the reviewed literature
    is relatively recent,

    dating 2010–2017. The reviewed projects come mainly from North America, Europe,
    and Asia.

    Overall, this study adopts a qualitative informative approach. The paper gathers
    complex

    technical information and makes them accessible to the non-specialists. Collectively,
    by reviewing,

    organizing, and collating information of various sources, the paper hopes to provide
    a better

    understanding of the theory and practice of vertical farming.

    1.4. What Is a Vertical Farm?

    Vertical farming seeks to ensure the sustainability of our cities proactively
    by addressing food

    security to the world’s ever-increasing urban population [4–8]. In principle,
    it is a simple concept;

    farm up rather than out [8–10]. The body of literature on the subject distinguishes
    between three

    types of vertical farming [9–11]. The ﬁrst type refers to the construction of
    tall structures with several

    levels of growing beds, often lined with artiﬁcial lights. This often modestly
    sized urban farm has

    been springing up around the world. Many cities have implemented this model in
    new and old

    buildings, including warehouses that owners repurposed for agricultural activities
    [8]. The second

    type of vertical farming takes place on the rooftops of old and new buildings,
    atop commercial and

    residential structures as well as on restaurants and grocery stores [9,10]. The
    third type of vertical farm

    is that of the visionary, multi-story building. In the past decade, we have seen
    an increasing number

    of serious visionary proposals of this type. However, none has been built. It
    is important, however,

    to note the connection between these three types, the success of modestly sized
    vertical farm projects

    and the maturation of their technologies will likely pave the way for the skyscraper
    farm [9].

    Environmentalists, urban farmers, architects, agronomists, and public health experts,
    among

    others, have been joining this mini revolution as they partner to work out a way
    to salvage a food-scarce,

    ultra-urbanized future. A wide number of technology experts have converged on
    the concept of vertical

    farming, advancing the ﬁelds of robotics, aeroponics, aquaponics, and hydroponics.
    Nonproﬁts

    organizations, aiming to promote environmentalism and local economic prosperity,
    have been backing

    the vertical farm concept. Similarly, for-proﬁt ventures that seek to meet the
    demand for local

    Buildings 2018, 8, 24

    3 of 36

    produce have supported this concept. Further, governments looking for ways to
    boost domestic

    food security have been funding these endeavors. Numerous countries including
    Korea, Japan, China,

    Germany, the United Arab Emirates, China, France, India, Sweden, Singapore, and
    the United States,

    have convened to discuss vertical farming. They have repeatedly endorsed the concept
    as integral to

    the long-term sustainability of their cities [9].

    The idea of vertical farming is not entirely new. Examples of it can be found
    dating back to the

    ancient era in the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, one of Philon’s Seven Wonders of
    the Ancient World,

    built around 600 BC. In 1915, Gilbert Ellis Bailey coined the term “vertical farming”
    and wrote a book

    titled “Vertical Farming”. He argued that farming hydroponically in a controlled
    vertical environment

    would provide economic and environmental beneﬁts. In the early 1930s, William
    Frederick Gericke

    pioneered hydroponics at the University of California at Berkley. In the 1980s,
    Åke Olsson, a Swedish

    ecological farmer, also proposed vertical farming as a means for producing vegetables
    in cities. He is

    known for having invented a spiral-shaped rail system for growing plants [4–9].
    Around the turn of

    the century, Dickson Despommier, an American ecologist, and professor of public
    health, passionately

    revived the concept of vertical farming. He described the vertical farm as “the
    mass cultivation of

    plant and animal life for commercial purposes in skyscrapers. Using advanced greenhouse
    technology

    such as hydroponics and aeroponics, the vertical farm could theoretically produce
    ﬁsh, poultry, fruit,

    and vegetables” [7] (p. 15). The vertical farm is considered to promote sustainable
    agricultural practices

    more than that by conventional farming, which refers to large scale, outdoor agriculture
    that embraces

    systems that engage heavy irrigation, intensive tillage and excessive use of fertilizers,
    pesticides,

    and herbicides [5] (p. 16).

    1.5. Why Vertical Farms?

    1.5.1. Food Security

    Food security has become an increasingly important issue. Demographers anticipate
    that urban

    population will dramatically increase in the coming decades. At the same time,
    land specialists (e.g.,

    agronomists, ecologists, and geologists) warn of rising shortages of farmland
    [4–6]. For these reasons,

    food demand could exponentially surpass supply, leading to global famine. The
    United Nation (UN)

    estimates that the world’s population will increase by 40%, exceeding 9 billion
    people by the year

    2050 [12]. The UN also projects that 80% of the world’s population will reside
    in cities by this time.

    Further, it predicts that by 2050 we will need 70% more food to meet the demands
    of 3 billion more

    inhabitants worldwide [12]. Food prices have already skyrocketed in the past decades,
    and farmers

    predict that prices will increase further as oil costs increase and water, energy,
    and agricultural resources

    diminish [7–10]. The sprawling fringes of suburban development continue to eat
    up more and more

    farmland. On the other hand, urban agriculture has been facing problems due to
    land scarcity and high

    costs. We desperately need transformative solutions to combat this immense global
    challenge [8–11].

    The logic of vertical farming is simple: produce more food on less land [10,11].
    The same

    rationale that we use to stack homes and ofﬁces in limited and expensive land,
    such as in Hong Kong

    or Manhattan, can apply to farming. Proponents of the vertical farm claim that
    it would create

    compact and self-sufﬁcient ecosystems that cover multiple functions, from food
    production to

    waste management. Vertical farming could enable food production in an efﬁcient
    and sustainable

    manner, save water and energy, enhance the economy, reduce pollution, provide
    new employment

    opportunities, restore ecosystems, and provide access to healthy food. In a controlled
    environment,

    crops will be less subject to the vagaries of climate, infestation, the nutrient
    cycle, crop rotation, polluted

    water runoff, pesticides, and dust [12]. As such, indoor farming could possibly
    offer a healthier

    environment to grow food [5,13]. Since indoor farming operates year-round and
    is independent of

    weather conditions, it could also provide greater yields and perpetual income
    [14]. Furthermore, indoor

    farming provides a low-impact system that can signiﬁcantly reduce travel costs,
    as well as reduce

    GHG emissions, by cutting down on travel distances between distant farms and local
    market [13,15].

    Buildings 2018, 8, 24

    4 of 36

    Also, vertical farming could ignite local economies by providing much needed “green
    collar” jobs to

    urban areas [5,13].

    Importantly, vertical farms could help in addressing the problem of farmland shortages
    [4,5,7].

    According to the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization, there was
    0.42 ha (1 ac) of

    arable land per person on earth in 1961. By 2002, because of population growth
    and urbanization,

    that number has dropped by nearly half, to 0.23 ha (0.5 ac) [5]. In 2011, the
    United Nations completed

    a global assessment of the planet’s land resources, determining that a quarter
    of all arable land is highly

    degraded. Further, since 1960, one million farmers in the United States have gave
    up farming [5–19].

    Today, the country suffers from “23 million food deserts, deﬁned by the U.S. Department
    of Agriculture

    (USDA) as urban neighborhoods and rural towns without ready access to fresh, healthy,
    and affordable

    food” [20] (p. 32). Dickson Despommier explains that current agricultural supply
    will soon become

    largely inadequate. That is, on average, every human being needs 1500 calories
    daily, and in order to

    meet such demand, we will need to add to existing agricultural land an area as
    big as Brazil by 2050 [7].

    1.5.2. Climate Change

    Climate change has contributed to the decrease of arable land. Through ﬂooding,
    hurricane,

    storms, and drought, valuable agricultural land has been decreased drastically,
    thereby damaging

    the world economy [7,11,12,18]. For example, due to an extended drought in 2011,
    the United States

    lost a grain crop assessed at $110 billion [11,19,20]. Scientists predict that
    climate change and the

    adverse weather conditions it brings will continue to happen at an increasing
    rate. These events

    will lead to the despoliation of large tracts of arable land, rendering them useless
    for farming. It is

    common for governments to subsidize traditional farming heavily through mechanisms
    such as

    crop insurance from natural causes [6,21,22]. Furthermore, traditional farming
    requires substantial

    quantities of fossil fuels to carry out agricultural activities (e.g., plowing,
    applying fertilizers, seeding,

    weeding, and harvesting), which amounts to over 20% of all gasoline and diesel
    fuel consumption in

    the United States. We need to understand that “food miles” refers to the distance
    crops travel to reach

    centralized urban populations. On average, food travels 1500 miles from the farm
    ﬁeld to the dinner

    table [8,15]. In special circumstances—cold weather, for example—food miles can
    rise drastically as

    stores, restaurants, and hospitals ﬂy produce in from overseas to meet demands.
    On a regular basis,

    over 90% of the food in major U.S. cities is shipped from outside. A 2008 study
    at Carnegie Mellon

    concluded that food delivery is responsible for 0.4 tons of carbon dioxide emissions
    per household

    per year [23,24]. This is especially important given the increasing distance between
    farms and cities

    from global urbanization. Sadly, the resulting greenhouse gas emissions from food
    transport and

    agricultural activities have contributed to climate change (Figure 1).

    1.5.3. Urban Density

    Vertical farming offers advantages over “horizontal” urban farming for the former
    frees land for

    incorporating more urban activities (i.e., housing more people, services, and
    amenities) [7]. Research

    has revealed that designating urban land to farming results in decreased population
    density, which

    leads to longer commutes. “If America replaced just 7.9% of its whopping one billion
    acres of

    crop and pastureland with urban farms, then metropolitan area densities would
    be cut in half” [4]

    (p. 71). Lower density living incurs higher energy use and generates more air
    and water pollution.

    The National Highway Travel Survey (NHTS) indicates, “If we decrease urban density
    by 50%,

    households will purchase an additional 100 gallons of gas per year. The increased
    gas consumption

    resulting from moving a relatively small percentage of farmland into cities would
    generate an extra

    1.77 tons of carbon dioxide per household per year” [23]. Despommier details space
    efﬁciency of

    vertical farms. He suggested that a 30-story building (about 100 m high) with
    a basal area of 2.02 ha

    (5 ac) would be able to produce a crop yield equivalent to 971.2 ha (2400 ac)
    of conventional horizontal

    farming. This means that the production of one high-rise farm would be equivalent
    to 480 conventional

    horizontal farms [24,25].

    Buildings 2018, 8, 24

    5 of 36

    Figure 1. Food travels great distances from farm ﬁelds to dinner table. The map
    illustrates the case of

    the travel of basic ingredients of a strawberry yogurt can (Adapted from [8]).

    1.5.4. Health

    Conventional farming practices often stress proﬁt and commercial gain while paying
    inadequate

    attention to inﬂicted harm on the health of both human and the natural environment
    [7,8,10]. These

    practices repeatedly cause erosion, contaminate soil, and generate excessive water
    waste. Regarding

    human well-being, the World Health Organization has determined that over half
    of the world’s farms

    still use raw animal waste as fertilizer which may attract ﬂies, and may contain
    weed seeds or disease

    that can be transmitted to plants [1]. Consequently, people’s health is adversely
    affected when they

    consume such produce.

    Further, growing crops in a controlled indoor environment would provide the beneﬁt
    of reducing

    the excessive use of pesticide and herbicide, which create polluting agricultural
    runoff [25]. According

    to Renee Cho, “In a contained environment, pests, pathogens, and weeds have a
    much harder time

    inﬁltrating and destroying crops” [25]. When excess fertilizer washes into water
    bodies (e.g., rivers,

    streams, and oceans), a high concentration of nutrients is created (called eutrophication),
    which could

    disturb the ecological equilibrium. For example, eutrophication may accelerate
    the proliferation of

    algae. However, when it dies, microbes consume algae and suck all the oxygen in
    water, resulting in

    dead aquatic zones [8]. “As of 2008, there were 405 dead zones around the world”
    [25].

    Further, indoor vertical farming employs high-tech growing methods that use little
    water

    (about 1/10th of that used in traditional farming) by offering precision irrigation
    and efﬁcient

    scheduling [25,26]. This can have a signiﬁcant ameliorative effect since demands
    on water will

    increase as the urban population grows. Agricultural activities use more than
    two-thirds of the world’s

    fresh water, and farmers are losing the batter for crop water because urban areas
    are expanding and

    consuming more water. The water crisis is likely to become severer as climate
    change causes warmer

    temperatures and proliferates more droughts [25].

    1.5.5. The Ecosystem

    Traditional agriculture has been encroaching upon natural ecosystems for millennia.
    According

    to Dickson Despommier, “Farming has upset more ecological processes than anything
    else—it is the

    most destructive process on earth” [4] (p. 7). In the past half century or so,
    the Brazilian rainforest

    has been severely impacted by agricultural encroachment, with some 1,812,992 km2
    (700,000 mi2) of

    Buildings 2018, 8, 24

    6 of 36

    hardwood forest being cleared for farmland [4]. Despommier suggested that encroachment
    on these

    ancient ecosystems is furthering climate change. In this way, indoor vertical
    farming can reduce the

    agricultural impact on the world’s ecosystems by restoring biodiversity and reducing
    the negative

    inﬂuences of climate change. If cities employed vertical farms to produce merely
    10% of the ground

    area they consume, this might help to reduce CO2 emissions enough to develop better
    technological

    innovations for improving the condition of the biosphere long-term. By eliminating
    fertilizer runoff,

    coastal and river water could be restored, and ﬁsh stock of wild ﬁsh could increase.
    Wood, et al.

    summarize this point by stating “The best reason to consider converting most food
    production to

    vertical farming is the promise of restoring [the] services and functions [of
    ecosystems]” [26] (p. 110).

    1.5.6. Economics

    Proponents of the vertical farm also argue that it will supply competitive food
    prices [27].

    The rising expense of traditional farming is quickly narrowing the cost gap. For
    example, when

    vertical farms are located strategically in urban areas, it would be possible
    to sell produce directly to

    the consumer, reducing transportation costs by removing the intermediary, which
    can constitute up to

    60% of costs [27]. Vertical farms also utilize advanced technologies and intensive
    farming methods

    that can exponentially increase production. Researchers have been optimizing indoor
    farming by

    calibrating, tuning and adjusting a wide-range of variables including light intensity,
    light color, space

    temperature, crop and root, CO2 contents, soil, water, and air humidity [27–29].
    In addition, vertical

    farming provides an opportunity to support the local economy. Abandoned urban
    buildings can

    be converted into vertical farms to provide healthy food in neighborhoods where
    fresh produce is

    scarce. Additionally, the high-tech environment of indoor farming can make it
    fun to farm. Hence,

    a technology-savvy younger generation has been enticed by the practice, grooming
    a new breed of

    farmers. Further, vertical farming provides impetus in the development of innovative
    agricultural

    technologies. Finally, it could reconnect city dwellers with nature through the
    activity of farming [27].

    2. High-Tech Indoor Farming

    2.1. Farming Methods

    Researchers have advanced myriad methods of urban and vertical farming in the
    hopes of

    contributing to sustainable food production. Advanced farming methods could provide
    greater yields

    and use far less water than traditional farming [17,18]. The design, layout, and
    conﬁguration of these

    high-tech farms would provide optimal light exposure, along with precisely measured
    nutrients for

    each plant. Designed to grow in a controlled, closed-loop environment, these farms
    would eliminate the

    need for harmful herbicides and pesticides, maximizing nutrition, and food value
    in the process. Indoor

    farmers could also “engineer” the taste of produce to cater to people’s preferences
    [30]. Researches

    intend to develop, reﬁne, and adapt these systems so that they can be ultimately
    deployed anywhere

    in the world and provide maximum production and minimum environmental impacts.
    They represent

    a paradigm shift in farming and food production and scholars view them as suitable
    for city farming

    where land availability is limited [5]. These systems (mainly hydroponics, aeroponics,
    and aquaponics)

    and associated technologies are rapidly evolving, diversifying, and improving
    (Table 1). The paper

    explains these systems in a gradual manner, from simple to complex.

    Aeroponics

    A variant of hydroponics;

    it involves spraying

    the roots of plants with mist

    or nutrient solutions.

    In addition to beneﬁts

    mentioned above, Aeroponics

    requires less water.

    Aquaponics

    It integrates aquaculture

    (ﬁsh farming) with

    hydroponics.

    Creates symbiotic

    relationships between the

    plants and the ﬁsh; it uses the

    nutrient-rich waste from ﬁsh

    tanks to “fertigate”

    hydroponics production beds;

    and hydroponic bed cleans

    water for ﬁsh habitat.

    2.1.1. Hydroponics

    Hydroponics is a method of growing food using mineral nutrient solutions in water
    without

    soil. Encyclopedia Britannica deﬁnes hydroponics as “the cultivation of plants
    in nutrient-enriched

    water, with or without the mechanical support of an inert medium such as sand
    or gravel” [27]

    (p. 8). The term is derived from the Greek words hydro and ponos, which translates
    to “water doing

    labor” or “water works”. The use of water as a medium for crop growing is not
    totally new, but the

    commercial introduction of hydroponics arose only recently [28]. The National
    Aeronautics and Space

    Administration (NASA) researchers have seen hydroponics as a suitable method for
    growing food in

    outer space. They have been successful in producing vegetables such as onions,
    lettuce, and radishes.

    Overall, researchers have advanced the hydroponic method by making it more productive,
    reliable,

    and water-efﬁcient.

    Currently, the use of hydroponics in industrial agriculture has become widespread,
    providing

    several advantages over traditional soil-based cultivation. One of the primary
    advantages of this

    method is that it could eliminate or at least reduce soil-related cultivation
    problems (i.e., the insects,

    fungus, and bacteria that grow in soil) [28–30].

    The hydroponic method is also relatively

    low-maintenance as well, insofar as weeding, tilling, kneeling and dirt removal
    are non-issues.

    The hydroponic method also provides a less labor-intensive way to manage larger
    areas of

    production [8,31,32]. Furthermore, it may offer a cleaner process given that no
    animal excreta are

    used. Furthermore, the hydroponic method provides an easier way to control nutrient
    levels and pH

    balance. According to Ebba Hedenblad and Marika Olsson, “In soil, many factors,
    such as temperature,

    oxygen level, moisture, and microorganisms, affect how soil-ﬁxed nutrients are
    made accessible to

    plants since the nutrients are being dissolved in water through erosion and mineralization.
    Therefore,

    the hydroponic method may result in more uniform [produce] and better yields,
    as the optimum

    combination of nutrients can be provided to all plants” [30] (p. 17).

    2.1.2. Cylindrical Hydroponic Growing Systems

    The Volksgarden or cylindrical Omega Garden hydroponic growing system is a rotating-system

    technology where plants are placed inside rotary wheels. When wheels spin, plants
    rotate around

    centralized induction lights. The wheels rotate once every 50 min using a low-horsepower
    motor (it is

    possible to run the wheels via wind turbines and solar panels). In advanced rotary
    systems, the “plants

    rotate constantly and slowly around the light source, and their roots pass through
    a nutrient solution

    Buildings 2018, 8, 24

    8 of 36

    when they reach the bottom of the orbit. Turning at a constant rate allows the
    plants to take advantage

    of orbitotropism (based on the impact of gravity on growth) to grow bigger, stronger
    and faster” [32]

    (pp. 28–29). The Volksgarden system also provides a compact arrangement for the
    plants’ roots in rock

    wool, thereby allowing the plants to grow more quickly than in traditional hydroponics
    [32].

    Importantly, the “Ferris wheels”, can multiply their capacity by adding “extreme
    verticality”,

    i.e., unit stacking. To appreciate the efﬁciency of the system experts have noted,
    “Each cylinder

    holds 80 plants, and six cylinders are stacked together about 20 feet high at
    each station” [32] (p. 28).

    This adds up to 480 units per station requiring only 3.4 m2 (36 ft2) of space.
    Green Spirit Farms plans

    to ﬁt 200 stations compactly in one of its vertical farms to grow 96,000 plants
    per year. For comparison,

    “conventional basil growers average 16,000 plants per acre (43,560 ft2), less
    than 20% of the production

    Green Spirit Farms could have in just 7200 ft2” [32] (p. 28). Furthermore, the
    Volksgarden system

    efﬁciently uses distilled water, requiring one-tenth the water used by traditional
    hydroponic systems.

    “Their distillation process allows multiple reuses of water. Rather than discarding
    the nutrient-dense

    liquid that remains after the produce has been harvested, it can be re-distilled
    and reused” [32] (p. 29).

    Furthermore, the Volksgarden system entails virtually no evaporation because the
    liquid reservoir

    for the growing system is closed. Additional water savings are provided by harnessing
    rainwater,

    collectively minimizing the demand on municipal water systems [32].

    2.1.3. Ultrasonic Foggers

    Scientists have designed ultrasonic fogger systems to minimize maintenance and
    maximize yield.

    They envision using them for myriad horticultural applications, including hydroponics,
    to provide

    multiple beneﬁts such as [33]:

    •

    Supplying upper roots with nutrient enriched fogs that penetrate deep into root
    tissues, keeping

    them moist, well-nourished, and free of decay [16].

    •

    Promoting the growth of minuscule root hairs, which exponentially increase the
    root’s ability to

    absorb water, nutrients, and exchange gases [32].

    •

    Reducing the use of water and nutrients by up to 50% [32].

    •

    Reducing the need for bulky and costly growing mediums [33].

    •

    Efﬁciently using space, as the units are compact and designed to be fed by a remotely
    located

    reservoir [33].

    •

    By integrating ultrasonic foggers, hydroponic systems come close to aeroponic
    systems [33].

    However, there are some concerns that the hydroponic method relies heavily on
    chemicals whereby

    all of the nutrients supplied to the crop are dissolved in water [29]. A hydroponic
    system is based on

    chemical formulations to supply concentrations of mineral elements [30]. Liquid
    hydroponic systems

    utilize ﬂoating rafts and the Nutrient Film Technique (NFT), and they largely
    rely on non-circulating

    water culture—though, new recirculation systems can be applied in NFT techniques
    [30]. Further,

    some complain that the produce is tasteless because of all the added chemicals
    in the system and

    because the roots do not get adequate oxygen [30]. These shortcomings are partially
    addressed by the

    aeroponic method.

    2.1.4. Aeroponics

    Aeroponics is a technological leap forward from traditional hydroponics. An aeroponic
    system is

    deﬁned as an enclosed air and water/nutrient ecosystem that fosters rapid plant
    growth with little

    water and direct sun and without soil or media [34]. The major difference between
    hydroponics and

    aeroponic systems is that the former uses water as the growing medium while the
    latter has no growing

    medium. Aeroponics uses mist or nutrient solutions instead of water, so it does
    not require containers

    or trays to hold water. It is an effective and efﬁcient way of growing plants
    for it requires little water

    (requires 95 percent less water than traditional farming methods) and needs minimal
    space [34]. Plant

    boxes can be stacked up in almost any setting, even a basement or warehouse.

    Buildings 2018, 8, 24

    9 of 36

    The stacking arrangement of plant boxes is structured so that the top and bottom
    of the plants are

    suspended in the air, allowing the crown to grow upward and the roots downward
    freely. Plants are fed

    through a ﬁne mist of nutrient-rich, water-mix solution. Because the system is
    enclosed, the nutrient

    mix is fully recycled, leading to signiﬁcant water savings. This method, therefore,
    is particularly

    suitable in water-scarce regions. An additional advantage of the aeroponic method
    is that it is free of

    fertilizers or pesticides. Furthermore, research has revealed that this high-density
    planting method

    makes harvesting easier and provides higher yields. For example, one of the aeroponic
    experiments

    with tomato in Brooklyn, NY, resulted in quadrupling the crop over a year instead
    of the more common

    one or two crops [34].

    2.1.5. GrowCube

    Recent research and technological development take the aeroponics method to a
    higher level of

    productivity and efﬁciency. For example, GrowCube has proposed a new aeroponic
    prototype through

    the high-tech cube, which contains ﬁve light plastic plates that spin via a rotisserie-esque
    wheel and

    are lit by a strip of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) that provide the necessary
    light for photosynthesis [34].

    At the top of the cube, a device sprays a nutrient-rich mist. The cube and its
    devices are controlled and

    managed via computer and software, and sensors inside the cube communicate with
    the computer to

    optimize the microclimate. The cube is also pressurized and equipped with an ultraviolet
    germicidal

    lamp and a high-efﬁciency particulate absorption (HEPA) ﬁlter, as well as “bug-killing
    ﬁlters in the

    pipes where the nutrient mixes are pumped” [34].

    Consequently, the microclimate inside the cube is bug-free, making its produce
    free of pathogens.

    Remarkably, IT companies are developing special apps and food growing food recipes,
    increasingly

    available online. Consequently, the aeroponics system and the entire growing process
    can be optimized

    remotely [34]. “When it comes time to planting, simply stick your seeds in a growing
    medium . . .

    and download the iOS app. From there, you can select and download a ‘grow recipe’
    from the

    cloud . . . Users are also encouraged to tweak and fork the recipes as they see
    ﬁt, helping to improve

    the growing and to offer variations. So if you want crisper lettuce, you can select
    that as an option” [34].

    Furthermore, by conducting the work autonomously, the computer-controlled environment
    reduces

    human errors and minimizes the effort of growing food [35].

    With such a computerized system, almost anyone could become a sophisticated farmer.
    What

    is more, the computerized system will help to “engineer” taste and other characteristics
    producing

    crispy or spicy produce! GrowCube has managed to produce “herbs, ﬂowers and foodstuffs
    like

    wheatgrass, microgreens, pea-shoots and even 28 heads of lettuce”, and it plans
    to produce fruits

    such as grapes [34]. The prototype is costly and will likely beneﬁt from economies
    of scale when it is

    produced in masses. Consequently, GrowCube plans to expand the project by producing
    hundreds of

    these high-tech cubes [34].

    2.1.6. Solar Aquaculture

    Solar aquaculture involves growing high-quality ﬁsh protein in small, clean, translucent,

    and controllable ponds that are exposed to sunlight. Microscopic green algae (nonﬂowering
    plants

    lacking a true stem, roots, and leaves) live in the pond with the ﬁsh and grow
    by absorbing nutrients

    from the water. In addition, sunlight that strikes the pond helps the algae to
    grow and causes the

    water to become warmer. Fish and algae grow faster in warmer water. This method
    could be suitable

    for vertical farms, enabling higher rates of production in limited spaces. A solar
    pond that is 1.5 m

    high, 1.5 m in diameter (5 ft high, 5 ft diameter) and contains 2649 L (700 gal)
    of water can produce

    an annual growth of 18 kg (40 lb) of ﬁsh [35].

    In addition to supporting ﬁsh, solar ponds can serve indirectly as storage units
    for solar heat.

    Algae capture about ﬁve percent of the entered solar energy while water absorbs
    the rest (95%).

    The pond makes air cooler during the day, given that much of the incoming sunlight
    is stored as warm

    water rather than hot air. In contrast, the pond warms the air at night as it
    releases heat. As such,

    Buildings 2018, 8, 24

    10 of 36

    heat from a solar pond can substitute for heating a greenhouse with gas, oil or
    wood or electricity,

    thereby saving on energy. However, the solar pond requires extensive maintenance
    because of the ﬁsh

    waste and some of the un-eaten food that transforms into waste. These problems
    are addressed by

    closed-loop systems and the aquaponics method.

    2.1.7. Aquaponics

    Aquaponics is a bio-system that integrates recirculated aquaculture (ﬁsh farming)
    with hydroponic

    vegetable, ﬂower, and herb production to create symbiotic relationships between
    the plants and the

    ﬁsh. It achieves this symbiosis through using the nutrient-rich waste from ﬁsh
    tanks to “fertigate”

    hydroponic production beds. In turn, the hydroponic beds also function as bio-ﬁlters
    that remove gases,

    acids, and chemicals, such as ammonia, nitrates, and phosphates, from the water.
    Simultaneously,

    the gravel beds provide habitats for nitrifying bacteria, which augment the nutrient
    cycling and

    ﬁlter water. Consequently, the freshly cleansed water can be recirculated into
    the ﬁsh tanks. In one

    experimental project, aquaponics consisting of wetland pools containing perch
    and tilapia, whose waste

    provided nutrients for greens, solved the principal problems of both hydroponics
    and aquaculture as

    mentioned above [36] (Figure 2).

    Figure 2. Basics of an aquaponic system (Adapted from [19]).

    Researchers envision that the aquaponics system has the potential to become a
    model of

    sustainable food production by achieving the 3Rs (reduce, reuse, and recycle).
    It offers bountiful

    beneﬁts, such as [36]:

    •

    Cleaning water for the ﬁsh habitat;

    •

    Providing organic liquid fertilizers that enable the healthy growth of plants;

    •

    Providing efﬁciency since the waste products of one biological system serves as
    nutrients for

    a second biological system;

    •

    Saving water since water is re-used through biological ﬁltration and recirculation.
    This feature is

    attractive particularly in regions that lack water;

    •

    Reducing, even eliminating, the need for chemicals and artiﬁcial fertilizers;

    Buildings 2018, 8, 24

    11 of 36

    •

    Resulting in a polyculture that increases biodiversity;

    •

    Supplying locally-grown healthy food since the only fertility input is ﬁsh feed
    and all of the

    nutrients go through a biological process;

    •

    Facilitating the creation of local jobs; and

    •

    Creating an appealing business that supplies two unique products—fresh vegetables
    and

    ﬁsh—from one working unit.

    Consequently, aquaponics is preferable to hydroponics. However, aquaponics systems
    continue

    to be at the experimental stage, having had limited commercialized success. This
    is because the

    technologies necessary to build aquaponics systems are relatively complex, requiring
    the mutual

    dependence of two different agricultural products. For this reason, aquaponics
    also requires intensive

    management [36].

    2.2. Lighting Technologies

    One of the important components of successful vertical farming is sound lighting.
    Available

    LED technologies provide only 28% efﬁciency, an efﬁciency rate that should be
    increased to about

    50–60%, at a minimum, to make indoor farming methods cost-effective [37]. Fortunately,
    experimental

    developments in LEDs have reached that mark [37,38]. Dutch lighting engineers
    at Philips have

    produced LEDs with 68% efﬁciency. Such an increase in lighting efﬁciency will
    dramatically cut costs.

    Also, a Dutch-based group called PlantLab has recently invented a lighting technology
    that could

    help to grow food on a small footprint. According to Michael Levenston, “This
    invention replaces

    sunlight with LEDs that produce the optimal wavelength of light for plant growth.
    Contrary to the

    sun, traditional assimilation lighting, and TL lighting LED only omits one color
    of light. No energy is

    wasted with light spectra that are not used . . . by the plant” [38]. As such,
    the new lighting technology

    provides the correct lighting colors plants need for photosynthesis—blue, red,
    and infrared light.

    Furthermore, new “induction” lighting technology simulates the color spectrum
    of sunlight to

    foster the growth of vegetables and fruits. “The light uses an electro-magnet
    to excite argon gas as

    its light source, instead of a ﬁlament. For this reason, [it] uses much less energy
    and can last up

    to 100,000 hours, twice as long as an LED light” [39]. It also generates more
    heat than LED light,

    but less than an incandescent bulb. Therefore, the lights create enough heat for
    growing plants without

    wasting energy to heat the entire building. Moreover, the light units are calibrated
    to create an “ideal”

    microenvironment by producing high-quality lighting that is similar to daylight.
    These units are also

    long lasting, with a life span of about one decade, and are sold at affordable
    prices.

    2.3. Farming Operation

    Researchers predict that farming operations will be fully automated in the near
    future.

    For example, monitoring systems will be widely implemented (in the form of sensors
    near each

    plant bed) to detect a plant’s need for water, nutrients and other requirements
    for optimal growth and

    development. Sensors can also warn farmers by signaling the presence of harmful
    bacteria, viruses or

    other microorganism that cause disease. Also, a gas chromatograph technology will
    be able to analyze

    ﬂavonoid levels accurately, providing the optimal time for harvesting. These speciﬁc
    technologies are

    not totally new. Their development has been on going and will likely proliferate
    in the near future [39].

    2.4. Farming from Afar

    One of the promising ideas under development is “farming from afar”. The cell
    phone, its software

    and apps, will ultimately handle much of the day-to-day tending of crops, and
    vertical farmers will

    be able to manage multiple farms remotely. New apps will allow farm managers to
    adjust “nutrient

    levels and soil pH balance from a smartphone or tablet, and sound alarms if, say,
    a water pump fails

    on a vertical-growing system . . . So if I’m over in London, where we''re looking
    for a future vertical

    farm site to serve restaurants, I’ll still be able to adjust the process in Michigan
    or Pennsylvania”,

    Buildings 2018, 8, 24

    12 of 36

    as Paul Marks explained [40]. Farming from afar will drastically reduce operational
    costs by reducing

    labor and will provide considerable convenience, ﬂexibility, and efﬁciency in
    managing farms. Further,

    by engaging new information technology and working with new online applications,
    farming could

    become an exciting and fun activity.

    2.5. “Closed-Loop Agricultural” Ecosystems

    “Closed-loop agricultural” ecosystems intend to mimic natural ecosystems that
    treat waste as

    a resource. Similar to aquaponics, the waste of one part of the system becomes
    the nutrients for the

    other. The closed-loop system recycles and reuses nearly every element of the
    farming process—dirty

    water, sewage, and nutrients. Food waste can also be converted to compost. In
    a closed-loop system,

    everything remains in the system, leading to a zero-waste outcome. This results
    not only in drastic

    decreases in waste but also in the creation of energy and other byproducts such
    as bedding and

    potting soil.

    Anaerobic Digester

    An anaerobic digester is a biogas recovery system that converts food waste into
    biogas to produce

    power and heat [41]. The Plant, a vertical farm in Chicago, has employed an anaerobic
    digester that

    captures the methane from 27 tons of daily food waste to produce electricity and
    heat. Figure 3

    illustrates how The Plan has integrated an anaerobic digester in its employed
    close-loop system

    (also see Section 3.2 on The Plant). Similarly, Great Northern Hydroponics (GNH),
    in Quebec, Canada,

    has employed a cogeneration machine that reduces its heating costs and reliance
    on fossil fuels. GNH’s

    power production has increased such that it is capable of selling electricity
    back to the Ontario Power

    Authority, decreasing the province’s dependence on fossil fuels.

    Main features of the closed-loop system:

    •

    At the heart of the system is an anaerobic digester that turns organic materials
    into biogas, which

    is piped into turbine generator to make electricity for plant grow light.

    •

    The plants make oxygen to the Kombucha tea brewery, and Kombucha tea brewery makes
    CO2 to

    the plant.

    •

    Waste from the ﬁsh feeds the plants and the plants clean the water for the ﬁsh.

    •

    More ﬁsh waste goes to the digester along with plants’ waste, waste from outside
    sources and

    spent grain from the brewery.

    •

    Spent barley from the brewery feeds the ﬁsh.

    •

    Sludge from the digester that becomes algae duckweed also feeds the ﬁsh.

    •

    Along electricity, the turbine makes steam which is piped to the commercial kitchen,
    brewery,

    and the entire building for heating and cooling.

    •

    Therefore, the kitchen produces Kombucha tea, fresh vegetables, ﬁsh, beer, and
    food, all with

    no waste.

    2.6. Renewable Energy

    Some vertical farms have implemented, and others have proposed employing wind
    turbines and

    photovoltaic panels to supply power. Other systems, such as thermal systems that
    collect solar heat

    and warehouse refrigeration exhaust, are also under consideration.

    2.7. Integration within City Infrastructure

    Future proposals, for example by Plantagon, envision the integration of vertical
    farms with the

    city symbiotically. The proposal envisions that the vertical farm will collect
    organic waste, carbon

    dioxide, manure, CO2, and excess heat from plants and factories, and transform
    these into biogas for

    heating and cooling. In this way, the vertical farm not only could grow food but
    also help to develop

    sustainable solutions for better energy, heat, waste, and water use (Figure 4).

    Buildings 2018, 8, 24

    Figure 3. An illustration of an integrated food production through a closed-loop
    system (Adapted

    from [41]).

    Figure 4. The proposed vertical farm in the downtown of Linköping, south of the
    capital Stockholm in

    Sweden by Plantagon provides an industrial symbiotic system. Partnership will
    be established between

    Plantagon, local energy company and local biogas plant. The greenhouse gets district
    heating from the

    power plant that runs through a major road, it gets excess heat and carbon dioxide
    from the biogas

    plant, and the leftover from the greenhouse goes into the biogas digestor. (Adapted
    from [42]).

    2.8. Redeﬁning Vertical Farms

    The aforementioned technologies are redeﬁning the vertical farm as “a revolutionary
    approach

    to producing high quantities of nutritious and quality fresh food all year round,
    without relying on

    skilled labor, favorable weather, high soil fertility or high water usage” [24].
    These new systems add

    advantages to vertical farming, summarized in Table 2.

    Table 2. Advantages of high-tech vertical farming systems [42].

    1. Reliable harvests

    Controlled indoor environments are independent of outside weather conditions and
    would provide

    consistent and reliable growing cycles to meet delivery schedules and supply contracts.

    2. Minimum

    overheads

    Production overheads would decrease by 30%.

    Low energy usage

    The use of high efﬁciency LED lighting technology ensures minimum power use for
    maximum plant

    growth. Computer management of photosynthetic wavelengths, in harmony with phase
    of crop growth,

    further minimizes energy use while ensuring optimized crop yields.

    Low labor costs

    Fully automated growing systems with automatic SMS text messaging would require
    manual labor only

    for on-site planting, harvesting, and packaging.

    Low water usage

    Vertical farms would use around 10% of the water required for traditional open
    ﬁeld farming.

    Reduced washing

    and processing

    Vertical farms would employ strict bio-security procedures to eliminate pests
    and diseases.

    Reduced transport costs

    Positioning of facilities close to the point of sale would dramatically decrease
    travel times, reducing

    refrigeration, storage and transport costs in the process.

    3. Increased

    growing areas

    Vertical farms would supply nearly ten times more growing area than traditional
    farms.

    4. Maximum crop

    yield

    Irrespective of external conditions, vertical farms can provide more crop rotations
    per year than open

    ﬁeld agriculture and other farming practices. Crop cycles are also faster due
    to controlled temperature,

    humidity, light, etc.

    5. Wide range

    of crops

    The vertical farm would provide a wide range of crops.

    6. Fully integrated

    technology

    The vertical farm would be fully monitored, controlled, and automated.

    Optimum air quality

    The temperature, CO2, and humidity levels of the vertical farm would be optimized
    at all times.

    Optimum nutrient and

    mineral quality

    The vertical farm would use specially formulated, biologically active nutrients
    in all crop cycles,

    providing organic minerals and enzymes to ensure healthy plant growth.

    Optimum water quality

    All fresh water’s contaminants would be removed before entering the vertical farm.

    Optimum light quality

    High-intensity low-energy LED lighting would be speciﬁcally developed and used
    for maximum growth

    rates, high reliability, and cost-effective operations.

    3.1. Modest-Scale Vertical Farms

    Companies interested in modest-scale vertical farming are proliferating around
    the world.

    For example, Nuvege in Kyoto, Japan, is a 2787 m2 (30,000 ft2) hydroponic facility
    with 5295 m2

    (57,000 ft2) of vertical grow-space that produces a variety of lettuces in a safe
    environment from the

    nearby Fukushima nuclear plant [25]. PlantLab in Den Bosch, Holland, is a three-story
    underground

    vertical farm that uses advanced LED technology that calibrates light composition
    and intensity to

    precise needs, entirely removing the wavelengths of sunlight that prevent plant
    growth [25]. The farm

    employs an automated system that monitors and controls numerous variables including
    humidity,

    CO2, light intensity, light color, air velocity, irrigation, nutritional value,
    and air temperature [25].

    The high-tech farm produces a yield three times the amount of the average greenhouse
    while reducing

    water use by 90%.

    3.1.1. Sky Greens

    One of the promising vertical farms is the Sky Greens of Singapore. As a small
    island, but with

    a population of over ﬁve million, Singapore faces potential issues of food security.
    With land at

    a premium, limited space for farming is available. Singapore produces only 7%
    of the food it consumes,

    and only 250 acres of the island are devoted to farming. The remaining need is
    supplied by food

    imports from all over the world. However, the transportation costs of food are
    becoming increasingly

    prohibitive. For these reasons, Singapore has been taking vertical farming seriously.
    Although

    Singapore is an extreme case, it represents a looming problem facing myriad cities
    worldwide [26].

    Sky Greens is Singapore’s ﬁrst commercial “tropical vegetable urban vertical farm
    . . . to achieve

    enhanced green, sustainable production of safe, fresh and delicious vegetables,
    using minimal land,

    water, and energy resources” [43]. The ﬁve-year-old farm is 3-stories tall (9
    m or 30 ft) and uses

    a method called “A-Go-Gro (AGG) Vertical Farming” that utilizes translucent green
    houses to grow

    tropical leafy vegetable year-round at signiﬁcantly higher yields than traditional
    farming methods.

    Sky Greens is capable of producing one ton of fresh veggies every other day. It
    supplies a variety of

    tropical vegetables including Chinese cabbage, Spinach, Lettuce, Xiao Bai Cai,
    Bayam, Kang Kong,

    Cai Xin, Gai Lan and Nai Bai. By providing high-quality produce at relatively
    affordable costs, the farm

    has thrived and intends to expand its production, providing a wider variety of
    vegetables.

    Structurally, the AGG system consists of tall aluminum A-frames that can be as
    high as 9 m

    (30 ft) tall with 38 tiers of growing troughs that contain various growing media—soil
    and hydroponics.

    The A-frame system takes up only 5.6 m2 (60 ft2), making it ten times more efﬁcient
    than conventional

    farming [43]. The troughs slowly rotate around the aluminum frame (about three
    rotations per

    day) to ensure that the plants obtain uniform sunlight. Such continuous exposure
    also reduces or

    even eliminates the need for artiﬁcial lighting in some areas of the building.
    Rotation is powered

    by a patented low carbon hydraulic system that contains trays of plants. The hydraulic
    system is

    an ancient technology empowered with a modern twist; it is a closed-loop that
    makes efﬁcient use of

    gravity and consumes little energy. Each 9-m (30 ft) tower uses only 60 W of energy
    and, therefore,

    the owner spends only about “$360/month ($3/tower) on electricity” to power the
    farm [43].

    In addition to providing commercial beneﬁts, Sky Greens is engaged in educational
    programs

    in the surrounding neighborhoods where students visit the farm, getting exposure
    and hands-on

    experience in transplanting, harvesting, and understanding the power of science
    and technology in

    creating green urban solutions. According to Sky Green’s website, the project
    provides numerous

    economic and environmental beneﬁts, summarized in Table 4. The project started
    as a prototype

    developed jointly with Agri-Food and the Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA)
    in 2010. Sky Greens

    together with AVA won the Minister for National Development’s Research & Development
    Award

    2011 (Merit Award) for Vertical Farming. Sky Greens promises to become a viable
    food supplying

    option [43,44].

    Table 4. The environmental and socioeconomic beneﬁts of the Sky Greens vertical
    farm project [43].

    Environmental Beneﬁts

    Environmentally

    friendly and high-tech

    Sky Greens observes, learns and works with nature to achieve sustainability for
    the good of the

    environment to grow safe, high-quality vegetables using green technologies.

    Low energy usage

    Outdoor green houses have abundant sunlight in the tropics. The A-Go-Gro system
    uses

    patented low carbon hydraulic green technology to power the rotation of the tower
    at very low

    energy costs, while still allowing the plants to receive abundant sunlight.

    Low water usage

    As the troughs of plants rotate, irrigation occurs using an innovative ﬂooding
    method, using

    very little water. Water is also recycled and reused.

    Good waste &

    water management

    Sustainable water management practices are utilized with all organic wastes being
    composted

    at the farm to ensure the use of safe, high-quality fertilizers.

    Green technologies

    Green technologies have been stringently implemented at the farm to achieve the
    three Rs

    (reduce, reuse and recycle).

    Socioeconomic Beneﬁts

    Increased productivity

    The production yield of Sky Greens Farm is 5 to 10 times greater per unit of area
    than traditional

    Singaporean farms that growing leafy vegetables in a conventional fashion.

    Tasty Vegetables

    Tropical leafy vegetables are grown in special soil-based media, which contribute
    to good

    tasting vegetables, suitable for stir-fry and soups. The vegetables are harvested
    every day and

    delivered almost immediately to retail outlets for consumers.

    Year-round production

    As the vertical farm structures are in protected-outdoor green houses, the vegetables
    are grown

    in a controlled environment, protected from pests, winds and ﬂoods.

    Consistent and

    reliable harvest

    A steady supply of fresh leafy vegetables is assured as growing takes place in
    a

    controlled environment.

    Easy to install and easy

    to maintain

    The modular A-frame rotary system allows quick installation and easy maintenance.

    Better ergonomics

    & automation

    The rotary system allows the troughs to be immediately adjusted for easy harvesting.

    Automation increases the productivity of workers per ton of vegetables grown.

    Space savings

    The footprint of the vertical system is small but can produce signiﬁcantly more
    per unit area

    than traditional farms. It can also be customized to suit different crop requirements
    and

    varying environments.

    In the United States, cities such as New York, Chicago, Milwaukee, and others
    are becoming

    pioneers of vertical farming by repurposing vacant urban warehouses, derelict
    buildings and high-rises

    to grow food. With so much vacant space available, the cost of property is often
    affordable to buy or

    rent. Within the buildings, vertical farmers build tall structures with several
    levels of growing beds,

    often lined with artiﬁcial lights, to grow crops and “microgreens”, i.e., salad
    vegetables such as arugula,

    Swiss chard, mustard, beetroot, and sunﬂowers. Indoor vertical farming is playing
    an important role

    in spurring economic development by repurposing vacant industrial buildings, supplying
    fresh and

    healthy food and providing jobs in distressed areas. Among the pioneering vertical
    farm projects

    to spread across the U.S. are those carried by companies such as Green Spirit
    Farms, FarmedHere,

    The Plant, and Green Girls.

    3.1.2. Green Spirit Farms

    Located in New Buffalo, Michigan, Green Spirit Farms (GSF) is a professional food
    company

    that has openly embraced vertical farming. The New Buffalo facility has grown
    out of a former

    plastic factory. The building contains about 3716 m2 (40,000 ft2) of space and
    sits on an 11-ha (27-ac)

    site. As standard practice, GSF will enter older vacant industrial or commercial
    buildings to supply

    produce nearby urban markets. It aims to provide local markets with high quality,
    fresh, pesticide-free,

    non-genetically modiﬁed organism (GMO) foods at affordable prices. The company
    chooses to grow

    products with a high local demand like lettuce, basil, spinach, kale, arugula,
    peppers, tomatoes, stevia,

    strawberries, and Brussel sprouts. It sells its produce locally to grocery stores
    and restaurants and to

    a host of small “Harvest Markets” which sells directly to consumers. GSF runs
    vertical organic farms

    in Atlanta, Philadelphia, Canada, and the United Kingdom [45]. The company has
    a strong belief in

    Buildings 2018, 8, 24

    17 of 36

    vertical farming. According to Green Spirit Farms’ Research and Development Manager
    Daniel Kluko,

    the future of farming is heading in one clear direction: the vertical. “If we
    want to feed hungry people

    this is how we need to farm . . . We cut out the risk of traditional farming,
    the labor, and most of the

    equipment costs . . . This is not a niche business, it’s not something novel,
    this is a necessity for the

    human race to continue to live” [46].

    GSF has advanced several technologies to grow vegetables. These include the Volksgarden
    Rotary

    Garden unit, referred to as a Rotary Vertical Growing Station (RVGS), and a multi-level
    tray system,

    referred to as a Vertical Growing Station (VGS). GSF has lately commercialized
    rotary and vertical

    farming systems using patented techniques to grow local vegetables, herbs, and
    some fruits, and has

    opened vertical farms in repurposed industrial buildings, including one in East
    Benton, Pennsylvania.

    The new facility constitutes a major expansion compared to GSF’s ﬁrst facility
    in New Buffalo, Michigan,

    containing 1715 vertical growing stations that will produce herbs, leafy vegetables,
    peppers and

    tomatoes, the equivalent of 81 ha (200 ac) of farmland harvested year-round. This
    is enabled by

    facility’s efﬁciency, which uses “98 percent less water, 96 percent less land,
    and 40 percent less energy”

    than would be required by traditional agriculture [46]. It is expected that the
    facility will create over

    100 jobs to support the local economy. GSF has invested about $27 million to establish
    the vertical

    farm and received ﬁnancial aid including a $300,000 Pennsylvania First Program
    grant, $303,000 in

    Job Creation Tax Credits, and a $45,450 Guaranteed Free Training grant to train
    new employees [47].

    The location has appealed to Green Spirit because of its proximity to large local
    markets, with most of

    its produce selling within approximately 75 miles of the farm [47]. In summary,
    the vertical farm project

    provides a useful example of adaptive reuse established through a strong public-private
    partnership.

    This has been made possible through the collaboration between GSF and several
    agencies including

    the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Lackawanna County, Benton Township, and the
    Greater Scranton

    Chamber of Commerce.

    3.1.3. FarmedHere

    FarmedHere is a company that was founded in 2011 and has recently expanded to
    three locations

    in Illinois: Englewood, a Chicago Southside neighborhood; Flanagan in downstate
    Illinois; and recently

    in Bedford Park, a Southwest Chicago suburb. As the company grows, it expects
    to supply 6% or

    more of the Chicago area’s demand for premium green and culinary herbs. The company
    also hires

    local youths through Windy City Harvest, a Chicago Botanic Garden-led urban agriculture-training

    program targeted to underserved youths. FarmedHere received the USDA (the U.S.
    Department of

    Agriculture) Organic Certiﬁcation at the end of 2012 [48]. The company’s product
    is spreading in

    several grocery stores including Whole Foods, Chicago-area Mariano’s Fresh Market,
    Green Grocer,

    and possibly soon at Trader Joe’s and Meijer. FarmedHere was able to receive ﬁnancial
    support from

    Good Food and Whole Foods, the farm’s largest customers. The company expects that
    it has a market

    niche given the recent generational demands for healthy and organic foods. These
    new businesses also

    expect to obtain subsidies from tax-increment ﬁnancing as well as property-tax
    breaks for reviving

    industrial properties [48].

    Bedford Park’s facility is about 8361 m2 (90,000 ft2), much larger than both the
    ﬁrst facility in

    Englewood (371 m2 (4000 ft2)) and the second facility in Flanagan (929 m2 (10,000
    ft2)). Bedford Park’s

    facility, about 24 km (15 mi) from downtown Chicago, is now hyped as the ﬁrst
    of its kind and the

    largest indoor vertical farm in America [48]. It was opened in 2013 and is expected
    to become a

    new model for growing produce efﬁciently in a high tech manner. The farm resides
    in a two-story,

    windowless warehouse, and is designed to occupy the full extent of the space.
    Currently, the farm

    consists of two structures with large growing beds lit by ﬂuorescent lighting.
    The ﬁrst structure

    contains the aquaponics system where water circulates between ﬁsh tanks, feeding
    plants that rest in

    cutouts on Styrofoam “ﬂoats” above. The second structure contains the aeroponics
    system, with water

    misters underneath that spray the exposed roots of the plants. Workers plant the
    seeds and grow

    seedlings on racks that then are transferred into the growing systems. After about
    a month, the crops

    Buildings 2018, 8, 24

    18 of 36

    are harvested and packaged manually in a cooling room at the facility, and then
    shipped the next

    morning to grocers in Chicago’s metropolitan area [49].

    By stacking aquaponics and aeroponics systems vertically, the facility contains
    13,935 m2

    (150,000 ft2) of growing space, or about 1.4 ha (3.5 ac). Planting in a controlled
    environment with

    ideal humidity and temperature ensures optimal growth. FarmedHere produces about
    136,078 kg

    (300,000 lb) of leafy greens and plans to grow to what will eventually amount
    to more than 453,592 kg

    (a million pounds) of chemical, herbicide and pesticide-free leafy greens yearly
    [49]. It also plans to

    expand by producing peppers, tomatoes, and other popular vegetables. Their aquaponics
    produces

    ﬁsh and organic herbs—basil and the like—while their aeroponics produces leafy
    greens like arugula

    and watercress. For space efﬁciency, plants are grown on six shelves that receive
    artiﬁcial ﬂuorescent

    lighting and that are attended by workers using scissor lifts. The aquaponics
    method ﬁlters the

    nitrogen-rich waste of the tilapia ﬁsh and uses it to feed plants, and the hormone-free
    tilapia are bred

    in four 3028-L (800-gal) tanks, where water is ultimately recycled to create a
    closed loop that reduces

    water use by 97%. Therefore, the system is efﬁcient in its use of water and space.

    These new facilities also provide “on-demand farming” meaning they are ﬂexible
    and responsive

    to market demands. For example, demand may suddenly increase for particular types
    of mixed greens

    or mini greens. “We could change the whole system ... and pretty much within the
    next 14 to 28 days,

    we [would] have a full grown plant, whatever the market requires” [50]. However,
    the prime obstacle

    these farms face remains the electricity needed to grow the plants and heat the
    space. Because of

    exorbitant energy bills, some indoor farms have been closed down. Dickson Despommier,
    in his book

    “The Vertical Farm: Feeding the World in the 21st Century”, stresses the fact
    that energy remains the

    primary hurdle [4]. Nevertheless, vertical farmers are trying to ﬁnd solutions
    by exploring solar, wind

    and methane gas as ways to generate electricity, or by supplementing artiﬁcial
    light with natural light

    through windows and skylights. Other farmers are experimenting with ﬂickering
    lights sufﬁcient to

    grow plants with little power.

    3.2. The Plant

    Located in the heart of Chicago’s derelict stockyards, the almost century old
    site of The Plant

    has a long history of food production as a former meatpacking facility and the
    former home of

    Peer Foods. The four-story, 8686 m2 (93,500 ft2) red brick warehouse is now set
    to become a major

    net zero vertical farm where the operation is fueled by food waste [51]. The zero-energy
    facility relies

    on an on-site Combined Heating and Power (CHP) system that contains a large anaerobic
    digester

    that converts food waste into biogas to power, heat and cool the building. The
    anaerobic digester

    captures the methane from 27 tons of food waste daily and 11,000 annually and
    burns it to produce

    electricity and heat. The Plant plans to turn the facility into a food business
    incubator, research lab and

    educational and training facility for vertical farming. The building’s transformation,
    which started in

    2010, was completed in 2016 [51].

    The Plant is currently producing greens, mushrooms, bread, and Kombucha tea. Eventually,

    the facility will combine a tilapia farm, beer brewery, Kombucha brewery, communal
    kitchen,

    an aquaponics system, and green energy production. “We’re working to show what
    truly sustainable

    food production and economic development looks like by farming inside an old meatpacking
    facility,

    incubating small craft food businesses, brewing beer and kombucha, and doing it
    all using only

    renewable energy that we make onsite. By connecting outputs of one business to
    the inputs of another,

    we are harnessing value from materials that most people would throw away” [51].
    The conversion of

    the space into a vertical farm and food business incubator was partly made possible
    by a $1.5 million

    grant from the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (DCEO)
    to support the

    development of a comprehensive renewable energy system [51].

    3.3. Green Girls

    Green Girls Produce, a professional food company, is Tennessee’s ﬁrst indoor vertical
    farm

    that supplies local restaurants with a year-round fresh produce in an effort to
    improve the health of

    Memphians and to ﬁght urban blight. The 60,000-ft2 facility is located in Memphis’
    Historic Downtown

    on the 4th ﬂoor of the Emerge Building. Restaurants have a desire for microgreens,
    which give meals

    an additional ﬂavoring and pizzazz [52]. “Chefs love them because they make a
    boring dish pop, they

    add intense ﬂavor, texture and vivid color . . . On top of that, they are nutritious
    with up to 40 times

    the nutrients and vitamins of their mature counterparts” [52]. However, restaurants
    often refrain

    from purchasing microgreens given their high costs. Restaurants typically pay
    about $100 a pound

    for microgreens. The vertical farm reduces the costs down to below $40 per pound.
    Green Girls

    estimates a revenue of about one million dollars a year. It supplies affordable
    microgreens and makes

    a proﬁt because of efﬁcient technologies provided by automated, re-circulating
    hydroponic systems

    that require only two employees to run. It is characterized by being clean, efﬁcient
    in its water use

    (Green Girls uses 90% less water than conventional farming) and green in its energy
    use, employing

    only LED lighting [52].

    3.4. Rooftop Farming

    Rooftop farming simply involves the growing of fruits and vegetable on a rooftop.
    With a dearth

    of suitable urban farming land, roofs are increasingly being seen as a plausible
    space for growing food

    and a proactive measure in building a sustainable future for cities. Indeed, an
    abundance of unused

    rooftop spaces prevails. For example, Honolulu’s buildings alone contain more
    than 1,579,351 m2

    (17,000,000 ft2) of rooftops. Consequently, in recent years, a great number of
    rooftop farms have sprung

    up and some green roofs have been transformed into rooftop farms [53–55].

    Overall, converting green roofs into rooftop gardens is a rising trend that aims
    to “scale up”

    urban agriculture. Similar to green roofs, rooftop farms are viewed as a necessity
    for combatting

    the heat-island effect, to mitigate stormwater runoff and to insulate buildings.
    In addition to these

    environmental beneﬁts, rooftop farming provides the beneﬁts of supplying the community
    with fresh

    produce and promoting modest-scale urban agriculture as well as providing tangible
    connections to

    food, See Table 5. Among the common vegetables grown on rooftops are kale, collard
    greens, carrots,

    radishes, peppers, beans, beets, cherry tomatoes, and various herbs [56]. Though,
    it should be noted

    that a slight distinction between a vertical garden and a vertical farm exists.
    While both grow plants

    vertically, the former not always produces fruits and vegetable, and the latter
    does that exclusively.

    Vertical farms usually occupy larger areas than that by vertical gardens. Nevertheless,
    the produce of

    both types (vertical gardens and vertical farms) is offered to local communities,
    stores, and restaurants.

    Rooftop farming is not a wholly original idea given that its history goes back
    to the ziggurats

    of ancient Mesopotamia and the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. To this day, however,
    continuing

    challenges in implementing rooftop farms persist. The structure must be strong
    enough to support the

    heavy weight of soil and greenhouse structures. Usually, the edges of rooftops
    are suitable to support

    moderate loads, but the central areas may need extra reinforcement [57].

    Furthermore, a rooftop requires building access, which imposes logistical issues,
    liability, weather

    conditions, and insurance risks. Zoning codes could also be obstacles to obtaining
    permits. For these

    reasons, urban farmers are struggling to create efﬁcient farming systems while
    making a proﬁt.

    Balancing costs and proﬁts indicates that not every green roof is well suited
    for farming. For example,

    in 2012 Local Garden, a rooftop farm that was opened in Vancouver, Canada, was
    recently closed due

    to economic reasons. Overall, rooftop farming is still a work in progress, but
    it has great potential as

    an urban farming system [58].

    Buildings 2018, 8, 24

    20 of 36

    Table 5. Summary of the beneﬁts of rooftop farms [53].

    Environmental Beneﬁts

    Energy

    Conservation

    The use of green roofs compared to conventional rooﬁng surfaces signiﬁcantly affects
    the energy

    balance within a building. Studies have revealed that green roofs have the potential
    to reduce a

    building’s energy use by as much as 30%.

    Stormwater

    Management

    A green roof absorbs rainwater and helps to prevent sewer system back-ups and
    contaminated

    stormwater overﬂow. Green roofs can also help to prevent catastrophic environmental
    events,

    such as the Ala Wai Canal sewage spill disaster.

    Fossil Fuel

    Reduction

    A rooftop farm can grow hyper-local foods. Growing Low Food Mile organic produce
    substantially

    reduces the fossil fuel consumption associated with the traditional food transportation
    system.

    Global Warming

    Green roofs sequester carbon from the atmosphere, lower the levels of carbon dioxide
    in the air,

    eliminate the build-up of greenhouse gases, and keep city temperatures cooler
    by effectively

    reducing the “Urban Heat Island Effect”.

    Biodiversity

    By replacing inorganic, lifeless roofs with living and thriving green spaces,
    green roofs support

    increased biodiversity in urban environments—offering a habitat for a multitude
    of

    organisms—from birds to butterﬂies to countless other beneﬁcial insects.

    Environmental

    Stewardship

    Organic rooftop farming protects soil and water from toxic pesticides, herbicides,
    fungicides,

    and other dangerous chemicals typically used in conventional farming.

    Socioeconomic Beneﬁts

    Community

    A rooftop farm is a beacon of sustainable community building that creates tangible
    connections

    between farmers and consumers. Rooftop farms have the power to do this throughout
    the city,

    no matter how scarce or valuable the land.

    Local Food

    Economy

    Rooftop farms generate revenue for local farmers and businesses. In this way,
    rooftop agriculture

    can also be viewed as an emerging green technology that creates jobs and improves
    food

    self-sufﬁciency by providing organic and Hyper-Local produce.

    Nutrition and

    health

    As an example, the produce of FarmRoof™ is extraordinarily nutritious and healthy.
    Thanks to a

    special soil that has been infused with minerals, trace elements, omegas, proteins
    and

    microorganisms, all of their crops are packed with enzymes, antioxidants, nutrients,
    and minerals.

    Aesthetics and

    Beauty

    Supplanting inorganic, lifeless roofs with vibrant greenery, green roofs can beautify
    cityscapes and

    balance an otherwise bleak horizon of concrete and tar.

    3.4.1. Brooklyn Grange

    Several rooftop farms have recently sprung up in New York City, the largest of
    which is Brooklyn

    Grange rooftop farm—about one acre in size—and is claimed to be the world’s largest
    rooftop

    garden [59]. Placed on top of a six-story warehouse that was built in 1919, Brooklyn
    Garage grows

    a wide-range of “organic produce that includes 40 varieties of tomatoes, peppers,
    fennel, salad greens,

    kale, Swiss chard, beans and a variety of delicious root vegetables such as beets,
    carrots, and radishes,

    as well as herbs” [42]. Their produce is grown in 19 cm (7.5 in) deep beds with
    Rooﬂite soil [59,60].

    “Rooﬂite is a lightweight soil composed of organic matter compost and small porous
    stones which

    break down to add trace minerals that are needed for the produce to grow into
    a healthy and mature

    state” [60]. Brooklyn Grange is thriving and plans to expand its operation [61].

    3.4.2. Gotham Greens

    Gotham Greens is a 1394 m2 (15,000 ft2) facility atop a two-story building in
    Greenpoint, Brooklyn,

    New York. Constructed in 2011, it is claimed to be the ﬁrst rooftop hydroponic
    commercial farm that

    uses technologically sophisticated Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) in
    an urban setting

    in the United States. The facility enjoys unusual farming efﬁciencies given that
    it uses less square

    footage to grow 7–8 times more food than traditional farming, providing produce
    year-round that

    is pesticide free [62,63]. Gotham Greens offers the advantage of growing summer
    vegetables in the

    winter, enhancing New York City’s barren landscape at this time, and plans to
    produce 80–100 tons of

    pesticide-free, premium-quality lettuce, salad greens, and herbs yearly. Gotham
    Greens is not only

    aiming to provide quality produce but also to save on energy by employing advanced
    computer

    systems that control heating, cooling, irrigation and plant nutrition, while utilizing
    on-site solar

    Buildings 2018, 8, 24

    21 of 36

    photovoltaics.

    Energy use is reduced further by providing natural ventilation, double-glazing,

    and thermal insulation that is supplied by the rooftop farm and through high-efﬁciency
    pumps

    and fans. As such, the facility optimizes energy use and consumes less land and
    water than that of

    a conventional farm. These energy-saving measures are particularly suitable for
    New York City given

    its rapid increase in energy costs. Because of these energy saving innovations,
    Gotham Greens will

    likely be able to reduce its production costs signiﬁcantly [45,46]. Interestingly,
    Gotham Greens was

    the only fresh food supplier in New York during the Sandy Hurricane. This highlights
    the beneﬁts

    of protected agriculture in urban areas—particularly as we face climate change—while
    open-air

    agriculture can suffer from weather damages [64].

    3.5. Multi-Story Farms

    As mentioned earlier, there have been an increasing number of proposals for multi-story
    farms

    that remain ideas on the drawing board. This is due, in large part, to the fact
    that these ideas are not yet

    economically feasible. However, some companies have taken this endeavor seriously
    and are on the

    verge of implementing some of these visionary ideas. Among the pioneering companies
    is Plantagon.

    3.5.1. Plantagon

    Founded in 2008 in Stockholm and headed by Hans Hassle, Plantagon is a Swedish
    vertical

    agriculture company that has ﬂourished through the establishment of ofﬁces in
    cities around the

    world, including Shanghai, China, and Singapore. Plantagon collaborates with other
    companies such

    as SymbioCity and SWECO that are also devoted to ﬁnding new methods of vertical
    farming and

    in clean technologies (Figure 5). It has also established research ties with academic
    institutions such

    as Linköping University in Linköping, Sweden, Nanyang Technological University
    in Singapore,

    and Tongji University in Shanghai, China. The company participated in Shanghai’s
    World Expo 2010

    and won the Globe Sustainability Innovation Award that same year. It also won
    a Silver Stevie Award

    for being Europe’s “most innovative company” in 2012 [65].

    Figure 5. Map of global cleantech innovation ranking (on a scale from 1 to 5,
    with 5 being the highest

    score). (Adapted from [65]).

    3.5.2. Organizational Structure

    Plantagon has embraced an innovative organizational structure, which they call
    “companization”,

    that combines two legally bound units, a proﬁt-driven company called Plantagon
    International AB,

    Buildings 2018, 8, 24

    22 of 36

    and a non-proﬁt association called Plantagon Non-proﬁt Association [65]. This
    “companization”

    aims to unite proﬁt-driven comercial forces with nonproﬁt organizational values
    [66]. It is a blend

    between the top-down action oriented commercial organization and the bottom-up
    inclusive and

    democratic nonproﬁt association. The two units of the company are dependent upon
    one another,

    thereby making it difﬁcult for the company to act irresponsibly and unethically.
    Plantagon is also tied

    to overarching ethical frameworks provided by the “UN Global Compact” and the
    “Earth Charter” in

    their articles of association and statutes. Their board members, from both the
    proﬁt and nonproﬁt units,

    constantly co-review ﬁnancial and social performance, bringing “moral questions
    to the otherwise

    purely economic forum [65,66] (Figure 6).

    3.5.3. Technical Innovations

    The company is not only innovative in its organizational structure but also in
    its technology.

    The company has invented an automated growing food process through a helical structure
    that would

    be placed in the center of a building. This structure employs an efﬁcient robotic
    belt that moves each

    row of plants one by one rather altogether. At the ground level, workers place
    seeds in pots and then

    lifts elevate them to the top of the helix. Here, automatically they are placed
    on a belt that takes them

    steadily back down to the ground, controlling the amount of sunlight they receive
    depending on their

    age and size. By the time they reach the ground, the plants are ready to be harvested.
    To keep the

    crops in sunlight as much as possible, the trays move more quickly when in the
    shade. Eventually,

    LED-lights will be employed to complement solar exposure (Figure 7). Plantagon
    has also made

    advancements in hydroponics by introducing pumice soil as a growing medium instead
    of relying

    completely on water. Pumice, a volcanic rock that results from the cooling of
    lava in water, possesses

    a unique porosity that absorbs nutrients and then channels them to plants. This
    may overcome the

    common problem of tastelessness that hydroponically generated produce is notorious
    for, though both

    methods provide similar levels of nutrition [66].

    Figure 6.

    The concept of “companization” by Plantagon.

    The model is described as a hybrid

    system that combines two legally bound units: one of the units is a proﬁt-driven
    company called

    Plantagon International AB, and the other one is non-proﬁtable association called
    Plantagon Non-proﬁt

    Association [65]. The “companization” aims to combine proﬁt-driven commercial
    forces with non-proﬁt

    moral and ethically-oriented driving forces in one organization [65]. It is a
    blend between the top-down

    action oriented commercial organization and the bottom-up, inclusive and democratic
    nonproﬁt

    association. (Adapted from [65]).

    Figure 7. A proposed vertical farm by Plantagon. It comprises a helix structure
    placed in the center of

    a sphere-shape building and stretches vertically. The helix structure contains
    a robot belt that instead

    of moving thousands of plants over the whole belt, it moves each raw of plants
    one by one. Seeds are

    placed in pots on the belt at the ground ﬂoor level. Then, plants are elevated
    to the top by an elevator

    and placed on the moving belt which takes them back to the ground, and by the
    time they reach the

    ground ﬂoor, plants are ready to harvest. (Drawing by author).

    Plantagon offers three approaches to vertical farming: façade farming, multifunctional
    farming,

    and standalone farming [65].

    The Plantawall Façade System

    This approach proposes turning a building’s façade into a productive greenhouse.
    It speciﬁcally

    suggests placing a six-meter-deep (20 ft) greenhouse at the perimeter where solar
    exposure is greatest.

    Plants sit in trays that constantly move on parallel conveyor belts, obtaining
    maximum exposure to

    natural light in the process. The PlantaWall façade system is based on a ﬂexible
    modular structure that

    can be attached to the whole facade or part of an existing structure. In addition
    to structural ﬂexibility,

    the façade system provides the beneﬁt of soundprooﬁng, supporting a healthy work
    environment,

    and improving thermal insulation and shade. Furthermore, the system fosters a
    symbiotic relationship

    that creates a healthy environment for everyone by transferring CO2 from people
    to plants and O2 from

    plants to people. However, the façade system reduces the amount of natural light
    that can penetrate

    deeply into a space [65].

    Multi-Functional

    In addition to farming, the multifunctional vertical farm incorporates functions
    such as ofﬁce

    space, hotel, and retail space as well as residential and educational uses.

    Standalone

    The standalone vertical farm is dedicated exclusively to the industrial production
    of food.

    The company has produced two prototypes, a sphere for tropical climates and a
    half-moon shape for

    temperate climates. The later prototype, named “Plantscraper” is a building that
    has been proposed

    Buildings 2018, 8, 24

    24 of 36

    in downtown Linköping, south of the Swedish capital of Stockholm (Figure 8). The
    purpose of this

    structure has been to create a reference building that can be used as a model
    of vertical farming.

    The “Plantscraper” is a 12-story, mixed-used tower that houses an indoor farm
    along the southern

    façade (The PlantaWall), a farmers market at the ground ﬂoor and ofﬁce spaces
    for proposed urban

    farming research [65]. The renting of ofﬁce space will provide supplemental income
    to the building.

    It is estimated that the Plantscraper will produce between 300 and 500 metric
    tons of leafy greens,

    particularly pak choi, a year. Pak choi, also known as celery cabbage, is a Chinese
    vegetable that

    can be eaten raw or cooked [65]. This leafy green has been emphasized because
    Plantagon wants

    to use this building as a model for Asian cities. In addition, the building will
    collect and reuse

    all wastewater, with all pesticides, fertilizers, and soil pollution being automatically
    monitored

    and controlled. Interestingly, Plantagon plans to integrate the vertical farm
    with the city’s civic

    infrastructure, i.e., electricity, gas, water, and sewage [66].

    Figure 8. One of Plantagon’s prototype for the vertical farm. Seeds are planted
    in the ﬁrst ﬂoor, then

    carried to the top via elevators, and next moves down by the helix belt system.
    (Adapted from [65]).

    3.5.4. La Tour Vivante

    The French architecture ﬁrm Atelier SOA has proposed a 30-ﬂoor mixed-use vertical
    farm—Tour

    Vivante (Living Tower)—that houses farming, residences, ofﬁce spaces, restaurants,
    and retail.

    The concept evokes the sense of a self-contained vertical neighborhood that enjoys
    autonomy and

    reduces travel needs between the rural and the urban, by bringing together the
    activities of production

    and consumption into one space [67]. People who live and work in the tower can
    enjoy proximity

    to fresh, ripe, and preservative-free produce while the tower’s tenants provide
    a constant income

    that supports the farms. It is also possible that residents of the tower could
    be employed in the

    building to reduce travel times between home and work. Additionally, combining
    farming, housing,

    and ofﬁce spaces brings together the traditionally distant rural farming experience
    close to residents,

    reconnecting them with nature. The tower’s architects explain that “the separation
    between city and

    countryside, urban planning and natural areas, places of living, consumption,
    and production is

    Buildings 2018, 8, 24

    25 of 36

    increasingly problematic for sustainable land management . . . The concept of
    Tour Vivante aims to

    combine agricultural production, housing and activities in a single system” [67].

    The interweaving of these functions and activities aims to provide a symbiotic
    relationship

    between the inhabitants and the farming environment. For example, food waste from
    restaurants

    and residents will be collected and processed to be used as a liquid fertilizer
    to fruits and vegetables.

    Similarly, the oxygen produced by plants will be channeled to tenants, while the
    carbon dioxide

    produced by the tenants will be transferred to plants. Rainwater from the roof
    and the façades will

    be collected, ﬁltered, and used in the farm, and the waste generated by the farm
    and other functions

    (housing, ofﬁces) will be collected and used to generate power for the tower [67].

    Blackwater produced by the tower will be recycled and puriﬁed to feed and fertilize
    the plants.

    The Tour Vivante also embraces renewable energy by employing two large wind turbines,
    as well as

    photovoltaic panels, placed on the southern façade of the building and its roof.
    The tower will also be

    constructed from recycled and recyclable materials. A thermal concrete shaft at
    the core of the building

    will help to control solar gain and humidity in the building while facilitating
    natural ventilation

    through the “chimney effect” and the application of a double skin façade. Overall,
    the tower explores

    possibilities of blending architecture with agriculture, merging food production
    and consumption into

    one place [67].

    3.5.5. Harvest Green Tower

    The city of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, expects to face rapid urban growth
    in the

    coming decades that would result in substantial demands on food. Romses Architects
    has recently

    proposed a multifunctional vertical farm in Vancouver in support of the City’s
    2030 Challenge of

    reducing carbon emissions. The project, named “Harvest Green Tower”, provides
    space for a mix of

    uses including residences, ofﬁces, entertainment, retail, restaurants, and vertical
    farming that will

    produce vegetables, herbs, fruits, ﬁsh, egg-laying chickens, goat cheese, and
    sheep dairy. The project

    also connects well with the city’s public mass-transit system. The main sections
    of the tower are

    described as follows [68].

    •

    Underground. A parking lot and shared car co-op

    •

    Street level. A grocery store, farmer’s market, restaurants, and a transit hub

    •

    Lower ﬂoors. A livestock grazing plain, bird habitat, goat cheese, and sheep dairy
    facility

    •

    Middle ﬂoors. A space for producing fruits, vegetables, and ﬁsh

    •

    Upper ﬂoors. Residential units

    •

    Tower’s top. A large rainwater cistern

    The tower will harness renewable energy by installing rooftop mounted wind turbines
    on the

    roof, photovoltaic glazing on the façade, a geothermal station underground, and
    bio-energy from the

    compost of plants and animals. All of these combined factors provide the possibility
    of selling surplus

    power back to the grid. Rainwater will be collected in a cistern atop the tower
    and used to irrigate

    plants through the downward pull of gravity. The project was a winning entry in
    Vancouver’s 2030

    Challenge given that it addressed climate change through the promotion of high-density
    mixed-use

    developments in the urban core, thereby curtailing sprawl [68].

    3.5.6. Skyfarm

    Designed by architect Gordon Graff, the Skyfarm is a 59-ﬂoor vertical farm proposed
    for

    downtown Toronto, Canada. This tower embraces the hydroponic method for growing
    food, using

    an area totaling about 743,224 m2 (8,000,000 ft2). It is predicted that the Skyfarm
    will produce

    the equivalent of a thousand-acre rural farm, feeding about 35,000–50,000 people
    per year [69].

    The building will be equipped with its biogas plant that contains an anaerobic
    digester to produce

    methane from its waste, which is then burned to generate electricity. The system
    can also reclaim the

    Buildings 2018, 8, 24

    26 of 36

    waste and sewage by diverting it to the Skyfarm’s anaerobic digester to produce
    the methane necessary

    to generate electricity. Furthermore, the liquid slurry extracted by the anaerobic
    digesters could be

    used by rural farms as fertilizer [69].

    3.5.7. Pyramid Farm

    Architecture professors Eric Ellingsen and Dickson Despommier have proposed a
    self-sustaining

    30-story “Pyramid Farm” to produce a wide variety of fruits and vegetables as
    well as ﬁsh and poultry

    farm that will feed about 50,000 people annually. The project embraces a closed-loop
    agricultural

    ecosystem where nearly every element of the farming process—including water and
    nutrients—is

    recycled and re-used, minimizing waste drastically. The farm will include a heating
    and pressurization

    system that splits sewage into water and carbon, fueling machinery and electrifying
    lighting. Overall,

    the proposed farm will be efﬁcient, as it will utilize only 10% of the water used
    in traditional farming

    techniques and only 5% of the space of a traditional farm. Finally, the visual
    quality of the pyramid is

    appealing and would ﬁt well into an urban area [70].

    3.5.8. Vertical Farm in Philippine

    A recent visionary project proposed a vertical aeroponics farm that offers high
    yields of rice in the

    Philippines; a country that faces food insecurity and lacks farmland. Rice is
    a particularly valuable

    food not only in the Philippines but also across the globe, given that half of
    the world’s population

    relies on rice as a major food source. Jin Ho Kim has proposed using aeroponics
    technology that uses

    minimal water to grow rice compactly on a terraced vertical farm to be constructed
    by an array of

    bamboo parallelograms. The project will create local jobs, supply local food,
    and lead to signiﬁcant

    savings in transportation, storage, refrigeration, and packaging, eventually incorporating
    spaces for

    social gatherings and children [70,71].

    4. Discussion: Opportunities and Challenges

    Vertical farming represents a proactive thinking approach that aims to ensure
    the sustainability

    of cities by addressing the issue of food security. The urban population already
    faces food shortages,

    and food prices are skyrocketing due to increases in oil prices, shortages of
    water and the diminishment

    of other agricultural resources. The current practices of supplying food to urban
    areas suffer from

    environmental and economic problems, such as the inefﬁcient practice of transporting
    food great

    distances. As an answer to these problems, the vertical farm will grow food efﬁciently
    and sustainably

    by saving energy, water, and fossil fuels, reducing toxins and restoring ecosystems,
    as well as

    providing new opportunities for employment. We have seen the rapid growth of modest-scale

    vertical farming, and these projects have provided excellent examples of adaptive
    reuse of vacant

    industrials spaces [72–76].

    Therefore, the vertical farm may offer opportunities in the three pillars of sustainability:

    environment, society, and economy (Table 6). It can offer a sustainable food-production
    model

    that supplies crop year-round with no interruption due to climate change, season,
    or adverse natural

    events (e.g., hurricane, drought, and ﬂood). It has also the potential to provide
    greater yield per space

    unit—the ratio is 1:4–1:6, depending on the type of crop [77,78]. Further, the
    high-tech cultivation

    methods of the vertical farm reduce demand on potable water. They are often efﬁcient
    in irrigating

    plants, by targeting plant roots and reducing evaporation [79]. They may also
    recycle wastewater (grey,

    even black water) and harness rainwater. When ﬁsh farms are integrated, ﬁsh removes
    waste (esp. ﬁsh

    ﬁlet). The vertical farm can also produce energy by burning methane from compost.
    For example,

    the Plant Vertical Farm in Chicago and the Republic of South Korea VF factory
    convert waste to

    energy [80,81].

    When compared to traditional farming, the vertical farm may reduce the need for
    fossil fuel

    required for tractors, plows, or shipping. Traditional farming uses lots of fossil
    fuel; for example,

    conventional farming in North America consumes 20% of fossil fuel due to plowing,
    seeding,

    harvesting, fertilizing and so on [82,83]. The vertical farm can also reduce food
    travel distance

    (food-miles) by promoting “local for local” life style, i.e., distances between
    food production and

    consumption are minimized [84–86]. As mentioned earlier, in conventional farming,
    food travels on

    Buildings 2018, 8, 24

    28 of 36

    average 1500 miles. Further, the vertical farm eliminates the need of packing
    agricultural crops for

    long-distance transportation [6,87,88].

    Indoor farming is immune to weather change, which affects traditional farming
    by changing

    temperature, water supply, and photo intensity. These factors often reduce produce
    yield; for example,

    droughts destroy crops every year worldwide [88,89]. As such, the vertical farm
    will be important

    for food security especially as climate change threatens our cities. As mentioned
    earlier, Gotham

    Greens was the only fresh food supplier in New York during the Sandy Hurricane.
    Additional beneﬁt

    of the vertical farm is providing an ideal growth environment for each plant that
    improves crop

    yield [62,73]. Advances in technologies, for example, the LED lighting, promises
    to increase yields as

    LED emits programmed wavelength of light for optimal photosynthesis of different
    types of crops.

    Luckily, the prices of these technologies are dropping [74]. The vertical farm
    provides an environment

    almost free of invasive pest species [90]. It also reduces, and possibly eliminates
    the use of mineral

    fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides, and nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P),
    which have been causing

    environmental degradation by polluting surface water and groundwater [91–93].

    The vertical farm can assist in cooling the environment, sequestering CO2, reducing
    the Urban

    Heat Island (UHI) effect, and combating climate change [94,95]. As such, it can
    help in reducing energy

    needed to cool indoor spaces in summer time and reduce carbon dioxide emission
    [96–98]. Further,

    the vertical farm can help in absorbing noise since vegetation reduces sound reﬂection.
    Vegetation and

    soil can function together as sound insulator [97,99]. When rooftop farming or
    green roofs are also

    applied, noise could be lowered further by absorbing higher frequency noise produced
    by auto trafﬁc,

    machineries, and airplanes [99].

    The vertical farm may also provide socio-economic beneﬁts by offering employment

    opportunities [100]. Building a vertical farm requires a multi-disciplinary team
    of architects, engineers,

    scientists, farmers, horticulturists, environmentalists, marketers, and economists.

    For example,

    industrial, mechanical and electrical engineers will be needed to design water
    recycling systems,

    lighting systems, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, seed
    and plant growth

    monitoring and harvesting systems. Computer experts will be needed to build databases
    and software

    applications. As such, the vertical farm offers new exciting careers in biochemistry,
    biotechnology,

    construction, maintenance, marketing, engineering, and research and development
    opportunities for

    improving the involved technologies [100–102]. Further, robotics and software
    engineers could also be

    needed. Moreover, a vertical farm may include grocery stores and engage distribution
    centers, which

    provide additional work opportunities [68,103].

    Further, vertical farming is likely to create new social networks and communities
    that forge new

    friendship in the workspace and beyond, among producers, farmers, and consumers
    [93]. In addition,

    vertical farmers may enjoy selling their produce directly to customers and develop
    friendships [104].

    Vertical farms could have an important educational role in informing about plants
    and produce by

    bringing farming activities closer to city dwellers. For example, Gotham Greens
    in New York frequently

    invites visitors and students to their vertical farm and holds educational sessions
    [105].

    Our health is directly impacted by the “freshness” and wholesomeness of food we
    consume and

    the vertical farm intends to supply quality, local organic food [58,89]. It could
    help consequently to

    reduce or stop the transmission of harmful infectious diseases for currently much
    produced food by

    conventional agriculture is polluted and carry bacterial diseases that endanger
    the lives of millions of

    inhabitants. That is, since the vertical farm product is not soil-based, it is
    likely to be not affected by

    polluted soil or irrigation water. Further, vertical farm’s crops are rich in
    nutrients [106,107]. Moreover,

    being close to nature helps to reduce stress and has positive inﬂuence on mental
    health.

    Notwithstanding the promising future and large potential beneﬁts, challenges and
    barriers in the

    path to the vertical farm implementation should be noted. Research has highlighted
    social resistance,

    where masses of people do not accept the alteration of traditional farming for
    it is the natural way to

    grow food [77,89,94,99]. Importantly, the core argument against vertical farming
    is that growing food

    indoors requires more energy, effort, and resources than traditional farming [86,98,100].
    That is, “It is

    Buildings 2018, 8, 24

    29 of 36

    much more expensive, of course, to build a vertical greenhouse than to build a
    normal greenhouse” [72].

    Despommier acknowledges that the costs of implementing vertical farms are high,
    particularly the

    start-up costs, and he calls on the government to provide the seed money to fund
    these projects.

    Apparently, to raise the required investment capital is a challenge. In short,
    in order for the vertical

    farm to be sustainable, it must be proﬁtable.

    Further, central cities are ideal locations for vertical farms for enjoying proximity
    to dense

    population and major retail outlets [69]. However, the issue of affordability
    is salient in central cities

    where land and space are expensive. For example, central areas in major cities
    in Hong Kong, Australia

    (e.g., Melbourne, Sydney), United Kingdom (e.g., London) have very expensive real
    estate, which

    presents an economic difﬁculty at the commercial scale [107]. However, some major
    cities such as

    New York and Chicago have sizable stocks of vacant older properties that could
    be repurposed into

    vertical farming. This has happened in projects such as The Pant in Chicago, IL
    and AeroFarms in

    Newark, NJ [49,72].

    Overall, residential, retail, ofﬁce, and commercial uses of high-rises continue
    to be more proﬁtable

    than that by agricultural activities [95]. It seems that increasing the productivity
    of the vertical farm

    is the prime factor to make it prevail in the future. “If the yield per hectare
    for indoor farming

    is much higher than rural outdoor farming, perhaps as much as up to 50 times,
    this factor will

    eventually outweigh the initial cost of land acquisition . . . and assuming 50-fold
    improved productivity,

    the break-even point may well be an estimated 6–7 years” [106] (p. 295). Such
    production will likely

    to offset the startup costs including expensive land or rent. Another drawback
    of the vertical farm is

    inability to produce all types of crops. In fact, current vertical farms produce
    limited crops such as

    lettuce, tomatoes, strawberries, and to less extent, grape, and soy products.
    Also, produced quantities

    are too small. Martin’s research indicates an imbalance between vertical farms’
    production and their

    catchment areas, where many of population reside in these areas are underserve.
    They found that in

    the near future, urban food will continue to come from distant rural areas [98,107].

    Further, due to economic reasons, most vertical farms produce and then distribute
    leafy greens to

    restaurants, and local residents remain not the prime client. In the same manner,
    low-value agricultural

    commodities such as wheat continue to be economically unviable. Therefore, the
    current product of

    vertical farms is limited in scope and quantities. Overall, production volumes
    of vertical farms are

    small, particularly when compared to “limitless” acres of traditional farming.
    Further, scaling up

    vertical farming could be costly and complex [86,108,109].

    Another limitation is that current renewable energy sources, such as photovoltaics
    and wind

    turbine, produce little energy that would make it difﬁcult not to rely on the
    city grid. It is only the

    plants at the building’s perimeter and on the top level that could beneﬁt from
    solar radiation [34,109].

    In this regard, it is important to employ rotatable stacked arrays of plants inside
    each ﬂoor of a high-rise

    enclosure so that plants receive maximum natural light [93].

    Consequently, until now, no multi-story vertical farm tower has been built, and
    despite copious

    attempts to make this a reality, the concept of the vertical farm tower remains
    on the drawing board.

    Despommier hints at a solution by stating that “High-rise food-producing buildings
    will succeed only

    if they function by mimicking ecological process, namely by safely and efficiently
    re-cycling everything

    organic, and recycling water from human waste disposal plants, turning it back
    into drinking water” [4]

    (p. 121).

    5. Conclusions

    A plethora of research and pioneering projects has demonstrated the potential
    of vertical farming

    at the pilot scale, prototypes and at the production level. The vertical farm
    has the potential to play

    a critical role in the sustainability of food in urban areas. This is most important
    as we project

    into the future when urban population will increase signiﬁcantly. Vertical farming
    has various

    advantages over rural farming, observed within the three pillars of sustainability:
    environmental,

    social, and economic. New high-tech cultivation methods, including hydroponics,
    aeropnics and

    Buildings 2018, 8, 24

    30 of 36

    aquaponics, largely challenge the need for soil-based farming for a range of crops.
    Advancements

    in greenhouse and supporting technologies such as multi-racking mechanized systems,
    recycling

    systems, LED lighting, solar power, wind power, storage batteries, drones as well
    as computing

    power, software applications, databases and The Internet of Things are likely
    to coalesce into efﬁcient

    production systems in the near future. Increasingly, there is a need for interdisciplinary
    research and

    collaboration that promote collective thinking among the various disciplines involved
    in creating

    vertical farms [110–114].

    Perhaps, in the distant future, there is the prospect of developing fully automated
    vertical farms.

    And hypothetically, if vertical farms were integrated in the city, they will be
    able to supply food for

    the entire population. However, there is still a need for more developments that
    scale up projects so

    that the economic and commercial feasibility and return on investment (ROI) are
    offered at best rates.

    As such, there is a need for research that accurately assesses the ROI of various
    types and sizes of

    vertical farms. There is a need to investigate the full life-cycle analysis (LCA)
    and the number of years

    to reach parity with a traditional farm [109,115,116].

    The success of the vertical farm will depend not only on innovation in technologies
    but also on

    local conditions including demand on certain produce by population, availability
    of labors, and farming

    conditions. An effective organizational structure and sound leadership are also
    important factors.

    Creativity, stewardship, and inventiveness are critical ingredients for companies
    that venture into new

    businesses such as vertical farming. In a globalized world, competition is stiff,
    but the ﬁrst to succeed

    may gain a competitive edge [99,108,115]. As such, robust and resilient business
    models are needed

    in a world characterized by increasing complexity, nonlinearity, and “glocal”
    exchanges of goods.

    According to Copenhagen Institute for Futures Studies, Instituttet for Fremtidsforskning
    “Tomorrow’s

    innovative leader isn’t necessarily the person in front with innovative ideas,
    but the one who discovers

    the front-runners and harvests their ideas to cultivate and nourish the innovative
    environment in his

    organization” [74]. Nevertheless, interest in vertical farming will increase as
    climate change prevails

    further and available arable land per capita declines [117].

    One more serious obstacle remains; the increasing populations of developing countries.
    Do these

    countries possess the required technologies and technical expertise to implement
    the vertical farm?

    These countries are largely poor. Can we make the products of the vertical farm
    affordable to the

    poor? Furthermore, many of these poor populations live in slums, in food deserts,
    away from modern

    life. How can we make the produce of vertical farms accessible to slum populations?
    Ultimately,

    the effectiveness of vertical farming will depend on various local factors, including
    the demand and

    supply of food, urban populations and their density, technological development,
    culture and eating

    habits, water and energy supply, as well as weather conditions.

    6. Future Research

    Vertical farming is growing rapidly, and this research barely scratches the surface
    of long and

    complex endeavor. The examined projects offer catalysts to further developments.
    Future studies

    may examine other projects including, but not limited to, Green Sense Farms (Portage,
    Indiana and

    Shenzhen, China), AeroFarms (Newark, NJ, USA), Metropolis Farms (Philadelphia,
    PA, USA), Plenty

    (San Francisco, CA, USA) VerticalHarvest (Jackson, WY, USA), Lufa Farms (Montreal,
    QC, Canada),

    VertiCropTM (Vancouver, BC, Canada), and a new un-named project in Suwon, South
    Korea. Also,

    future research may examine specialized technologies and methods for various indoor
    farming systems.

    For example, hydroponic systems offer multiple methods, including Nutrient Film
    Technique (NFT),

    Wick System, Water Culture, Ebb and Flow (Flood and Drain), Drip Feed System and
    Aeroponic

    Systems. Further, there is a need for conducting quantitative research that gives
    accurate assessments

    of the beneﬁts and shortcomings of various types of vertical farms. Importantly,
    future research should

    examine the issue of affordability of advanced equipment of vertical farming to
    developing countries.

    Researchers should invent, advance, and further develop local farming techniques
    to make vertical

    farm projects feasible in these countries. For example, they may invent recycling
    methods that reduce

    Buildings 2018, 8, 24

    31 of 36

    reliance on water, design local systems by capturing rainwater, and may capitalize
    on local solar power

    for providing natural light and energy.

    \ (IoT) with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)\noccurred, tens of applications including\
    \ smart agriculture have emerged to offer innovative solutions\nto modernize the\
    \ farming sector. This paper aims to present a low-cost platform for comprehensive\n\
    environmental parameter monitoring using ﬂying IoT. This platform is deployed\
    \ and tested in a real\nscenario on a farm in Medenine, Tunisia, in the period\
    \ of March 2020 to March 2021. The experi-\nmental work fulﬁlls the requirements\
    \ of automated and real-time monitoring of the environmental\nparameters using\
    \ both under- and aboveground sensors. These IoT sensors are on a farm collecting\n\
    vast amounts of environmental data, where it is sent to ground gateways every\
    \ 1 h, after which the\nobtained data is collected and transmitted by a drone\
    \ to the cloud for storage and analysis every 12 h.\nThis low-cost platform can\
    \ help farmers, governmental, or manufacturers to predict environmental\ndata\
    \ over the geographically large farm ﬁeld, which leads to enhancement in crop\
    \ productivity and\nfarm management in a cost-effective, and timely manner. Obtained\
    \ experimental results infer that\nautomated and human-made sets of actions can\
    \ be applied and/or suggested, due to the innovative\nintegration between IoT\
    \ sensors with the drone. These smart actions help in precision agriculture,\n\
    which, in turn, intensely boost crop productivity, saving natural resources.\n\
    Keywords: Internet of Things; Unmanned Aerial Vehicles; smart farming; environmental\

    \ (FAO) predicts that by 2050, the world popu-\nlation will hit 9.73 billion,\
    \ and by 2100, it will be 11.2 billion; with the current population of\napproximately\
    \ 7.84 billion, this shows an increase of approximately 25% [1]. To feed this\n\
    larger population, food production should double by 2050 [2]. For example, the\
    \ current\nﬁgure of 2.1 billion tons of annual cereal production should reach\
    \ approximately 3 billion\ntons [3]. This means there is a serious need to enhance\
    \ productivity and meet the demands\nof nations [4]. However, the current agricultural\

    \ Long-Range Wide-Area Network (LoRa)-based\nIoT platform for Smart Farming Modular\
    \ IoT Architecture called LoRaFarM that aims to im-\nprove generic farms management\

    \ in a real farm in Italy, where it collected environmental data\n(air, soil,\

    and greenhouse vegetables) over a period of three months. A web-based visualization\
    \ tool\nfor the collected data is also presented, to validate the LoRaFarM architecture.\n\
    Authors in [27] developed a hierarchical smart farming structure based on the\
    \ collabo-\nration between UAVs and federated Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs)\
    \ for crop monitoring.\nTwo important aspects of such collaboration have been\
    \ considered: designing the UAV tra-\njectories for efﬁcient data collection and\
    \ implementing effective data processing algorithms\n(consensus and symbolic aggregate\
    \ approximation) at the network level to assess relevant\ndata transmission. Experiments\
    \ were carried out at a Romanian research institute where\nSustainability 2021,\
    \ 13, 5908\n4 of 26\ndifferent crops and methods are developed. The results demonstrate\
    \ that the collaborative\nUAV–WSN–IoT approach increases the performances in both\
    \ smart farming and ecological\nagriculture.\nA smart agriculture management system\
    \ (SAMS) was introduced in [28], which\nproposed an automated system to help farmers\
    \ to increase crop production by crashing\ninto natural resources. The system\
    \ used different sensors to collect data required for the\ngrowth of the crop,\
    \ where these data were fed into the ThingSpeak IoT cloud platform for\ndata visualization.\
    \ The real-time data were stored on Firebase Database and then used for\ncrop\
    \ prediction using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classiﬁer.\nResearchers in [29]\
    \ presented an intelligent antifrost irrigation management system\nthat contains\
    \ a climatological station and ecological anti-disaster frost irrigation. The\n\
    solar-powered system interacts with the environmental system through a website,\
    \ allowing\nthe real-time interconnection, acquisition, and monitoring of information\
    \ through mobile\nphone systems (GSM/GPRS) and internet (TCP/IP) services. Additionally,\
    \ the proposed\nsystem uses an intelligent Fuzzy Expert System (FES) to predict\
    \ the greenhouse temperature\nand control activation of a water pump, considering\
    \ humidity, the temperature of inside\nand outside air, solar radiation, and wind\
    \ speed. The intelligent model gives a prediction\nby determining coefﬁcients\
    \ with the analysis of variance method.\nNestor et al. in [30] developed an application\
    \ for water irrigation called “Agrinex.”\nThis system is an alternative approach\
    \ in collecting and measuring physical parameters\nfrom the environment, particularly\
    \ in smart irrigation systems. Agrinex is connected to\nseveral in-ﬁeld sensors\
    \ such as a water level sensor, paddy temperature sensor, and a\nﬁeld weather\
    \ station. This work aimed to make this information accessible anywhere\nwherever\
    \ there is internet access using a mobile application, which makes Agrinex scalable\n\
    and adaptable to changes. The mesh-based network recorded a maximum transmission\n\
    distance of 11 m from sink to sensor node with a 90% success rate. Data from the\
    \ ﬁeld can\nbe accessed remotely close to real-time when short network delays\
    \ are accounted for. It\nalso gives the additional beneﬁt of equipping lands with\
    \ an automated irrigation system\nthat conserves up to 81% of water consumption.\n\
    Authors in [31] proposed a system that decides whether or not water is needed\n\
    for farms by predicting the rainfall using the Genetic Algorithm (GA) approach.\
    \ In the\nproposed system, voluminous weather and soil moisture data are stored\
    \ inside the cloud\nservers. Based on data collected by a UAV and then fed to\
    \ the GA, water spraying is\nperformed, which can be monitored using a mobile\
    \ application. Cloud servers are used for\nstoring and processing large volumes\
    \ of weather and soil moisture data. Results show that\nthe sensor-based system\
    \ is activated to check whether the GA-based system completes its\nprediction\
    \ correctly or not by sensing moisture levels from the soil. If the moisture level\n\
    of the soil crosses the predeﬁned threshold value, then plant watering is performed\
    \ by\nquadrotor UAV.\nResearchers in [32] developed a framework for monitoring\
    \ pests and diseases of crops\nbased on IoT and UAV that attempts to solve the\
    \ correlation between the occurrence of\npests/diseases and weather parameters.\
    \ The proposed framework is deployed in the\nYangtze River Zone of China, where\
    \ it uses rotary devices based on sun perception to\nobtain solar energy. Results\
    \ infer that low-altitude remote sensing and monitoring through\naerial imaging\
    \ of pests and diseases using UAV is reasonable, while more analyses of\nclimate\
    \ changes would provide some precautions in advance.\nA Narrow Band IoT (NB-IoT)\
    \ system is proposed in [33] to collect underground soil\nparameters in potato\
    \ crops using a UAV network. Around 2500 sensors deployed under\nand above ground\
    \ are connected to UAV using Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network\n(LPWPAN).\
    \ Simulation results show that due to UAV altitude and path loss, the link quality\n\
    between the ground sensor and UAV is reduced. Another observation is that the\
    \ lifetime\nof sensor batteries was varied depending on the location of the sensor\
    \ under or above\nground. Using LoRa technology and proper path loss model are\
    \ recommended as future\nwork to enhance link accuracy and performance. Regarding\
    \ path loss, authors in [22–25]\nSustainability 2021, 13, 5908\n5 of 26\ndiscussed\
    \ different types of propagation path loss from an aerial platform perspective,\n\
    where Free-Space and Air-to-Ground are typical deterministic propagation models,\
    \ while\nHata and Okumura are typical empirical ones. Results show that an appropriate\
    \ model can\nbe selected based on coverage range, adaption across different terrains,\
    \ and better Quality\nof Service (QoS).\nAuthors in [34] suggested a heterogeneous\
    \ IoT sensor node system to sense acoustic,\nrain, wind, light, temperature, and\
    \ pH levels of the cornﬁelds for smart agriculture applica-\ntions. The system\
    \ aimed to achieve productive corn harvest in large-scale ﬁelds using a\ndrone\
    \ that gathers data and sends it to a gateway. The simulation results that monitored\n\
    at the gateway using the IoT application called Grafana show that it offers maximum\n\
    efﬁciency from the soil and follows the crop development according to the weather\
    \ and soil\nconditions, in addition to reducing the workload and the risk of disease\
    \ and pest, as well\nas optimizing irrigation and obtaining better quality products\
    \ at low cost. As future work,\ncollecting a wider range of climatic data and\
    \ geographical conditions would be useful in\ndesigning a model of smart farming.\n\

    \ integration between IoT and drone\nis also coupled with cloud computing technology,\
    \ which, in turn, helps in building sus-\ntainable smart agriculture and enhancing\
    \ crop productivity and farm management in a\ncost-effective, and timely manner.\n\
    Thus, the paper aims to implement a system that periodically collects data using\n\
    both under- and aboveground sensors on farms and sends them to the gateway; then,\n\
    using a drone with a LoRa module onboard, the obtained data are transmitted to\
    \ the cloud\nfor storage, analysis, and monitor the status of crops and farms.\
    \ The proposed platform\nis based on experimental work to fulﬁll the requirements\
    \ of automated and real-time\nmonitoring of the environmental parameters for 12\
    \ months. Thus, a clear picture can be\nobtained to make wise decisions in managing\
    \ the crop and enhancing its productivity.\nThis integrated system of multiple\
    \ technologies used in the proposed platform develops\ncomprehensive under- and\
    \ aboveground sensors, along with considering an optimized\npropagation path loss,\
    \ which is a noteworthy shift from existing works. In this context and\nto achieve\

    \ and Methods\nThis section presents the architecture of the platform, which aims\
    \ to monitor using\nboth under- and aboveground sensors and a drone for smart\
    \ farming. Figure 3 shows\nthe conceptual work in a bird’s-eye view of the proposed\
    \ architecture, which consists of\nspace segment and ground segment. The space\

    \ module, which is responsible for collecting data\nfrom a wireless server gateway\
    \ and then transmitting them to the cloud for storage and\nfurther analysis. The\

    \ underground sensors (soil moisture); and (3) HOBO U30 Weather Station Starter\n\
    Kit, which is an aboveground sensor that measures temperature/humidity, rain,\

    \ as presented in related works of the\nprevious section.\nHata’s equations are\

    \ only in rural areas since it involved farm zones [37,38]. The distance d of\
    \ the\nHata propagation model is computed based on elevation angle (θ), which\
    \ is a notable shift\nfrom existing propagation models. The θ is a vital element\
    \ in calculating path loss from\nspace such as in drone scenarios. Path loss in\

    \ Implementation and Testbed\nThis section presents the proposed solution as deployed\

    \ activities using ﬂying IoT. The low-cost\nproposal platform was considered for\
    \ comprehensive monitoring of environmental pa-\nrameters using both under- and\
    \ aboveground sensors. Field experiments were carried out\nfrom March 2020 to\
    \ March 2021 at Medenine, Tunisia; some background information about\nthis region,\
    \ such as geographic location, soil property, and climate can be referred to the\n\
    map of world climates.\nThe proposed system can be explained in ﬁve steps, as\
    \ Figure 9 shows. S-THB-M008\nrefers to temperature/humidity sensor, S-RGB-M002\
    \ refers to rain gauge sensor, S-LIB-\nM003 refers to solar radiation sensor,\
    \ and S-SMC-M005 refers to soil moisture smart sensor.\nFirst, both under- and\
    \ aboveground sensors collected relevant data from the farm every 1 h.\nSecond,\
    \ these data were stored temporarily on an embedded Secure Digital (SD) card in\n\
    the wireless server gateway. Third, the drone ﬂew and collected data from various\
    \ wireless\nserver gateways located in the farm every 12 h. Fourth, the drone\
    \ sent the data to the cloud.\nFifth, automated and human-made sets of actions\
    \ could be taken to apply smart actions\nfor precision agriculture, which, in\
    \ turn, dramatically boost crop productivity, and help\nin saving natural resources.\
    \ These actions could be obtained from the cloud into the user\ninterface smart\
    \ device. However, a decision support system could be introduced in a future\n\
    study to link the farm’s smart devices together to achieve an autonomous system.\n\

    Station Kit was placed in every section with a distance of about 0.5 km between\
    \ each other.\nEach HOBO Weather Station was powered with renewable energy from\
    \ the sun via solar\npanels, while smart sensors to measure temperature/humidity,\
    \ rain, and solar radiation\nwere linked to this kit. This means the lifetime\

    −97 dB to −127.5 dB. Additionally, PL has a positive correlation with distance,\
    \ which rep-\nresents the drone altitude. Noticeably, the shadowing effect and\
    \ reflection of signals from \ninterfering obstacles were low, due to line-of-sight\
    \ connectivity between the ground sta-\ntion and the drone. As RSS is linked to\
    \ PL, results show RSS varying between −40 dBm to \n−70 dBm, which has again a\
    \ positive correlation with distance (drone altitude). Unsurpris-\ningly, increasing\
    \ transmission power would enhance RSS, since RSS depends on transmit-\nter power,\
    \ antenna gains, and environmental factors. Having the results of the propaga-\n\
    tion model including PL and RSS is useful in monitoring system performance, network\
    \ \nplanning, and coverage to achieve perfect reception. In our scenario, this\
    \ means commu-\nnication between drone and ground station as well as wireless\
    \ server gateway showing a \nhigh level of reception with the smallest attenuated\
    \ signal, besides achieving stronger \nwireless connectivity. This also helps\
    \ in delivering collected data from the drone to the \ncloud for storage and analysis\
    \ in an efficient and timely manner. \nFigure 17. Sensing temperature, humidity,\

    \ farming involves the integration of advanced technologies into existing farm-\n\
    ing practices to increase production efﬁciency and quality of agricultural products.\
    \ The\nevolution of IoT and UAVs has enabled the vision of sustainable smart farming,\
    \ where\nthese smart technologies have proven to increase the quality of crop\
    \ yield and reduce the\nenvironmental footprint from the agricultural sector.\
    \ This paper shows a low-cost platform\nfor comprehensive environmental parameter\
    \ monitoring using ﬂying IoT. The proposal is\nbased on experimental work to fulﬁll\
    \ the requirements of automated and real-time monitor-\ning of the environmental\
    \ parameters using both under- and aboveground sensors. These\nIoT sensors devices\
    \ on a farm collect vast amounts of environmental data, where it is sent\nto ground\
    \ gateways every 1 h, after which the obtained data are collected and transmitted\n\
    by a drone to the cloud for storage and analysis every 12 h. This platform is\
    \ deployed\nand tested in a real scenario on a farm in Medenine, Tunisia, in the\
    \ period of March 2020\nto March 2021, covering open-ﬁeld and greenhouse cultivation.\
    \ This low-cost platform\ncan help farmers, governmental, or manufacturers to\
    \ predict environmental conditions\ndata over the geographically large farm ﬁeld,\
    \ which leads to enhancement of crop produc-\nSustainability 2021, 13, 5908\n\
    24 of 26\ntivity and farm management in a cost-effective, and timely manner. Obtained\
    \ practical\nresults indicate that automated and human-made sets of actions have\
    \ been applied and/or\nsuggested that are smart actions for precision agriculture,\
    \ which, in turn, dramatically\nboost crop productivity and help in saving natural\
    \ resources. Examples of these actions are\nthe following:\n•\nFarmers are advised\
    \ to consider various strategies such as spraying chemicals on\nplants during\
    \ some seasons;\n•\nVarious plantings and quarterly grains are suggested;\n•\n\
    Estimate the amount of water needed to bring the soil to ﬁeld capacity;\n•\nFarmers\
    \ are advised to consider greenhouses to protect plants from high light intensity\n\
    during summer;\n•\nAdjust water irrigation using automated dripping and sprinkling\
    \ based on environ-\nmental parameters;\n•\nUsing solar panels for powering the\
    \ weather station leads to energy efﬁciency.\nFrom a practical point of view,\
    \ the deployed nodes, which are fed by a solar panel-\nrecharged battery, have\
    \ correctly transmitted data for 12 months, with underground and\naboveground\
    \ sensors and despite bad weather conditions. Indeed, even though some\nsamples\
    \ were lost during several rainy days, once their batteries were recharged by\
    \ solar\nlight during the following sunny days, nodes restarted to transmit properly.\n\
    PL and RSS of the Hata propagation model of the distance between the ground station\n\
    and the drone at the cloud layer show reasonable results, in which the obtained\
    \ values\nsatisfy a high level of reception with the smallest attenuated signal,\
    \ besides achieving line\nof sight wireless connectivity in an efﬁcient and timely\
    \ manner. More elaboration can be\ntaken into consideration for future work, e.g.,\
    \ to develop a machine learning algorithm\nto predict environmental conditions\
    \ and then suggest solutions and/or precautions. A\ndecision support system framework\
    \ could be introduced as part of a future project to link\nthe farm’s smart devices\
    \ together to achieve an autonomous system. Moreover, the power\nconsumption of\
    \ the drone can be optimized to enhance ﬂight time, which leads to covering\n\
    wider farm zones.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, methodology, software,\

    \ Greenhouse cultivation has evolved from simple covered rows of open-fields crops\
    \ to highly sophisticated controlled \nenvironment agriculture (CEA) facilities\
    \ that projected the image of plant factories for urban agriculture.  The advances\
    \ and \nimprovements in CEA have promoted the scientific solutions for the efficient\
    \ production of plants in populated cities and \nmulti-story buildings.  Successful\
    \ deployment of CEA for urban agriculture requires many components and subsystems,\
    \ as \nwell as the understanding of the external influencing factors that should\
    \ be systematically considered and integrated.  This \nreview is an attempt to\
    \ highlight some of the most recent advances in greenhouse technology and CEA\
    \ in order to raise the \nawareness for technology transfer and adaptation, which\
    \ is necessary for a successful transition to urban agriculture.  This \nstudy\
    \ reviewed several aspects of a high-tech CEA system including improvements in\
    \ the frame and covering materials, \nenvironment perception and data sharing,\
    \ and advanced microclimate control and energy optimization models.  This research\
    \ \nhighlighted urban agriculture and its derivatives, including vertical farming,\
    \ rooftop greenhouses and plant factories which are \nthe extensions of CEA and\
    \ have emerged as a response to the growing population, environmental degradation,\
    \ and urbanization \nthat are threatening food security.  Finally, several opportunities\
    \ and challenges have been identified in implementing the \nintegrated CEA and\
    \ vertical farming for urban agriculture. \nKeywords: smart agriculture, greenhouse\

    \ \ntransition driven by the advances in precision technology, data \nprocessing\
    \ and smart farming.  Protected cultivations have \nchanged from simple covered\
    \ greenhouse structures to high-tech \nplant factories that optimize the productivity\
    \ of the plants and \nhuman labour.  A modern greenhouse operates as a system,\
    \ \ntherefore, it is also referred to as controlled environment agriculture \n\
    (CEA), controlled environment plant production system (CEPPS), \nor Phytomation\
    \ systems[1].  These structures use natural or \nartificial light within which\
    \ optimum growth conditions is intended \nto achieve for producing horticultural\
    \ crops, or for plant research \nprograms.  They also offer greater predictability,\
    \ reduce the cost \nof production and increase crop yields.  A comprehensive history\
    \ \nof greenhouses in the past three decades can be found in the works \nof [2-6].\
    \  Examples of earlier works in automation and computer \ncontrol of greenhouse\
    \ environment are showed in [7-9].  Previous \nstudies on greenhouse engineering\
    \ during the 1990s have been \nreviewed by Hanan[10] and Critten and Bailey[11].\
    \ \nThe United Nations has predicted that by 2050, more than \ntwo-thirds of the\
    \ nine billion world population will live in the cities.  \nSecuring the supply\
    \ chain of fresh fruits and vegetables in this new \nscenario will be an overwhelming\
    \ challenge.  If properly designed, \n2   January, 2018                      \

    \ and plant \nfactories can significantly contribute to this context for the \n\
    year-round production of fresh vegetables in urban areas.  For \nsuch a system\
    \ to operate successfully and achieve its production \nobjectives, attention needs\
    \ to be paid to the technical aspects of \nautomation (A), culture (C), environment\
    \ (E) and system (SYS).  \nTing et al.[1] defined ACESYS terms as follow: Automation\
    \ is the \nprocessing of information and execution of tasks for operation of \n\
    CEA through computerized instrumentations and various control \nalgorithms that\
    \ might include decision support programs and \nartificial intelligence.  The\
    \ cultural and environmental factors \ncomprise \ncultivation \ntechniques, \n\
    plants \ncharacteristics, \nmicroclimate requirements and growth responses.  It\
    \ also contains \nmorphological and physiological conditions such as “multiplication,\
    \ \nrooting, transplanting, pruning, water and nutrient delivery, \npesticide\
    \ application, harvesting, post-harvest processing, etc”.  \nTing et al.[1] stated\
    \ that “Systems analysis and integration is a \nmethodology that starts with the\
    \ definition of a system and its goals, \nand leads to the conclusion regarding\
    \ the system’s workability, \nproductivity, reliability, and other performance\
    \ indicators.” \nResearch trends in this field are toward innovative methods for\
    \ \nshifting from conventional greenhouses to smart controlled \nenvironments\
    \ that benefit from natural resources for eliminating \ndeleterious external conditions.\
    \  The ultimate objective in this \nregard would be achieving high yield and high-quality\
    \ fruits at \nminimum possible cost. \nInnovations in the low-cost and low-power\
    \ consumption \nsensors and instrumentations, communication devices, data \nprocessing\
    \ and mobile applications, along with the technological \nadvances in the design\
    \ structures, simulation models, and \nhorticultural engineering have provided\
    \ the state-of-the-art \nfacilities that are shifting the traditional CEA to plant\
    \ factories for \nurban farming.  This paper begins with a summary of several\
    \ \nreviewed literature in Section 2 on the advances in greenhouse \ncovering\
    \ materials, artificial light, and the efficiency of the \nmicroclimate controller\
    \ for a viable CEA system.  This part aimed \nto investigate the effects of the\
    \ existing and new covering materials \non the resulting microclimate (including\
    \ influencing factors and \ntheir interactions with cultural practices), plants\
    \ growth, and yield.  \nModeling of CEA, as well as object-oriented automation-culture-\
    \ \nenvironment system analysis that is presented in the works of Ting \net al.[1]\
    \ provide a systematic approach for a better understanding of \nthese influencing\
    \ factors.  These findings and their implications in \na modern CAE such as plant\
    \ factories and agri-cubes are further \ndiscussed in Section 5.  After that,\
    \ environmental monitoring and \nperception by means of wireless sensor networks\
    \ (WSN) and \ninternet of things-based (IoT-based) platforms have been \ndemonstrated\
    \ and reviewed as an essential part of an automation \nsystem.  In our opinion,\
    \ the three biggest challenges for the \ndevelopment of an efficient and viable\
    \ CEA system are the creation \nof automation levels for energy management, reduction\
    \ of \nenvironmental impact, and maximizing use of natural resources.  \nA comprehensive\
    \ review of the advances in environmental control \nmethods, energy optimization\
    \ models, prediction tools, and \ndecision support systems are provided in Section\
    \ 4.  Specifically, \nthe applications of different high-level algorithms for\
    \ the most \nefficient microclimate control solutions are highlighted in Section\
    \ \n4.1.  These control methods and automation phases have been \nreviewed to\
    \ illustrate how each part can facilitate achieving the \noverall objectives of\
    \ a CEA.  A summary of some of the research \nworks in the past decade on energy\
    \ analysis, artificial intelligence, \nand simulation models with applications\
    \ in different aspects of \ngreenhouse production are presented in Sections 4.2\
    \ and 4.3.  A \nsubstantial amount of research has been done on individual aspects\
    \ \nof automation, culture, and environment, as well as their \ncombination, however\
    \ improvements of CEA also require decision \nsupport systems (DSS) and assessment\
    \ tools for long-term risk \nmanagement by accurately determining the interactions\
    \ between \nclimate parameters and growth responses prior to the actual \ncultivation[12].\
    \  To identify technological pathways for energy \nefficient CEA, a survey was\
    \ performed in Section 4.4 to highlight \nsome of the improved solutions based\
    \ on decision support systems \nfor energy management strategies in the commercial\
    \ greenhouses.  \nIn Section 5, the research covered urban agriculture and the\
    \ \ndevelopment of plant factories and vertical farming which is \ngrowing rapidly\
    \ in the East and Southeast Asia, most noticeably in \nJapan, South Korea, Taiwan\
    \ Province of China, and Malaysia, and \nreviewed several conceptual designs such\
    \ as the rooftop \ngreenhouses to highlight how various research and educational\
    \ \ninstitutes, real estate developers, and construction companies are \ninvolved\
    \ in the emerged opportunities.   \n2  Considerations for viability \nSeveral\
    \ factors to be considered in designing of a viable \ngreenhouse system for producing\
    \ year-round crops and \nvegetables are the structure frame, landscape, topography,\
    \ soil, \nclimate conditions, microclimate control system, light condition, \n\
    intercepted solar radiation, windbreaks, the availability of \nelectricity, roadways,\
    \ and labor force.  Other conditions that \nshould also be taken into account\
    \ for an efficient large-scale \ncommercial greenhouse production[13,14] are the\
    \ environment, \neconomic and social factors.  For example, a modern greenhouse\
    \ \nstructure might be constructed within a commercial building or \nnear commercial\
    \ or residential lands.  Some of the most popular \ngreenhouse structures and\
    \ CEA are presented in Figure 1. There \nare numerous experimental and analytical\
    \ research works that \naddress how environmental parameters inside a greenhouse\
    \ is \naffected by the structural design and shape, volume size, \ndimensions,\
    \ plants density, covering films, structure material, \nwind speed, geographical\
    \ orientation, and most importantly the \nmicroclimate control system.  For example,\
    \ in regions where \nsolar radiation or ambient air temperatures are high, several\
    \ \ndesign factors for optimum air exchange such as the ratio of the \narea of\
    \ the vent openings to the ground area covered by the \ngreenhouse, the ratio\
    \ of the greenhouse volume to the floor area, \nand the vertical distance between\
    \ the air inlets and air outlets can \nsignificantly improve the ventilation performance.\
    \  Optimization \nof vent configuration by evaluating greenhouse and plant canopy\
    \ \nventilation rates under wind-induced ventilation has been studied \nby Kacira\
    \ et al.[15].  This section provides a summary of the \nresearch works that have\
    \ addressed improvements in covering \nmaterials, and microclimate control systems.\
    \  To avoid \noverlapping of the contexts and maintain a consistent flow of the\
    \ \ntopics, we have covered the advances in structure design (i.e., \nrooftop\
    \ greenhouses) as a separate subsection under urban \nagriculture. \nJanuary,\

    \ \n \n2.1  Covering materials \nConsiderations for greenhouses covering materials\
    \ involve \nsupporting foundation, shape and framing materials, geographical \n\
    direction for optimal light entrance, the load of equipment, factors \nfor static\
    \ and dynamic loads (i.e., hanging plants, structure weight, \nand wind speed),\
    \ dimension ratio, and volume.  Greenhouses \nstructures and covering can take\
    \ different forms which can be used \nto surround the whole or a section of the\
    \ cultivation area and space.  \nThe most dominant transparent materials in use\
    \ are 2-3 mm glass \npanels, net-screen film, and  0.1 mm and 0.2 mm Polyethylene\
    \ \n(PE) plastic films, and ultraviolet (UV) stabilized PE-films.  \nBaudoin et\
    \ al.[16] recommended that in order to obtain a reasonable \nheat rise of less\
    \ than 4°C in a glass-clad greenhouse, the airflow \nrate should be 0.04-0.05\
    \ m3/s of floor area (1 m2).  Selection of \ncovering material for a greenhouse\
    \ depends on its application, the \ntype of crop to be cultivated, and the climate\
    \ condition of the \nregion.  It can vary from simple covers such as one layer\
    \ plastic[17,18], \ndouble-wall plastic[19,20], and glass[21,22], to fiberglass[23,24],\
    \ \ndouble-wall plastic, acrylic sheet[25], polyethylene film[26-29], \npolyvinyl\
    \ \nchloride \n(PVC)[30], \ncopolymers[31], \nPolycarbonate \npanels[32], and\
    \ selective transmission medium[33,34] for different \nspectral frequencies. \
    \ Some of these materials are designed to trap \nenergy inside the greenhouse\
    \ and heats both plants zone and its \nsurroundings.  Detailed properties of these\
    \ covering, as well as the \nquality assessments of their mechanical properties,\
    \ have been \naddressed in detail by a study on the effects of cover diffusive\
    \ \nproperties on the components of greenhouse solar radiation[34]. \nCondensation,\
    \ radiation transmittance and diffusing properties \nof different types of transmitting\
    \ covering materials in greenhouses \nhave been discussed by Pollet et al.[35].\
    \  Glazing materials allow \nshorter-wavelength radiation (i.e. visible light)\
    \ to pass through, but \nlong wavelength radiation such as infrared (heat) is\
    \ trapped inside \nthe greenhouse.  A comparison between different greenhouse\
    \ \ncovering materials, including polyethylene film, photo-selective red \ncolor\
    \ film, and insect-proof net for tomato cultivation during \nsummer is available\
    \ in the works of Arcidiacono et al.[36] and \nHemming et al.[37] Jarquín-Enríquez\
    \ et al.[38] studied the effects of \ndouble layer plastic and flat glass cover\
    \ on the lycopene \naccumulation and color index during tomato fruit ripening.\
    \  They \nconcluded that lycopene biosynthesis in tomato fruits was increased\
    \ \nby the amount of light after the beginning of ripening growth stage.  \nStudying\
    \ the effect of greenhouse covering materials on the inside \nair temperature\
    \ under tropical climate condition showed that while \noutside temperature was\
    \ between 28°C-33°C, the temperature \ninside \na \npolyethylene \nfilm \ncovered\
    \ \ngreenhouse \nwithout \nenvironment control reached 68°C-70°C, leading to air\
    \ vapor \npressure deficit (VPD) of 4 kPa[39].  Al-Mahdouri et al.[40] \nevaluated\
    \ optical properties and thermal performances of different \ngreenhouse covering\
    \ materials.  The combinations of external \nclimate conditions and type of greenhouse\
    \ for the most appropriate \napplication have been studied by Kempkes et al.[41]\
    \ A computer \napplication to measure geometric characterization and dimensions\
    \ \nof insect-proof screens was designed by Álvarez et al.[42].  \nPolythene-clad\
    \ greenhouses do not become as hot because of the \ntransparency of the plastic\
    \ to long-wave radiation that is \ntransmitted back out of the greenhouse.  Therefore,\
    \ for a \npolythene-film covered greenhouse, the ventilation rate can be \nreduced\
    \ to 0.03-0.04 m3/s of floor area (1 m2)[43].  With \ngreenhouse shading, the\
    \ amount of solar radiation and light \nintensity reaching the plants is restricted,\
    \ creating a closed \ndifference between air temperature inside and outside the\
    \ \ngreenhouse.  Shading also decreases leaf surface temperature \nsignificantly.\
    \  According to Glenn et al.[44], while a 20% to 80% \nlight reduction can be\
    \ expected depending on the shading materials, \nthe sufficient light reduction\
    \ for most greenhouse applications is \nbetween 30% and 50%.  Hassanien and Li[45]\
    \ investigated the \nmicroclimate parameters and growth responses of lettuce plants\
    \ \ninside a greenhouse that was shaded with semi-transparent \nmono-crystalline\
    \ silicon double glazing photovoltaic panels \n(STPV).  The STPV panels of their\
    \ study accounted for 20% of \nthe greenhouse roof area, and showed that the combination\
    \ of \nSTPV and polyethylene cover decreased the solar radiation by 35% \nto 40%\
    \ compared to the use of polyethylene cover.  They also \nshowed that the STPV\
    \ shading decreased the air temperature by \n4   January, 2018               \

    \ effect on the relative \nhumidity, fresh weight, leaf area and the chlorophyll\
    \ contents under \nnatural ventilation. \nProtected cultivation of Solanaceous\
    \ crops such as tomatoes \nand peppers by means of Screen-houses operating on\
    \ natural \nventilation is now a commonly practiced in tropical lowlands for \n\
    reducing insect migration, the risk of damage by high rainfall, \nextreme solar\
    \ radiation, and high wind speeds.  In addition, by \nusing insect-proof net covered\
    \ greenhouse, the inside and outside \ntemperature may remain similar, while temperature\
    \ has been \nobserved to be rising with the photo-selective film during summer.\
    \  \nStudies showed that net-screen greenhouses have gained more \npopularity\
    \ in tropical regions due to the potential of climate \nparameters that have optimality\
    \ degrees close to the plants desired \nlevels.  Shamshiri[46] observed that under\
    \ an insect-proof \nnet-screen covered greenhouse operating on natural ventilation,\
    \ the \ninside and outside air temperature remained close to each other, \nwhile\
    \ the air temperature was found to increase inside two \nphoto-selective film\
    \ covered greenhouses (polycarbonate panel and \na polyethylene covered) operating\
    \ on evaporative cooling[39].  \nShading nets ease the natural ventilation process\
    \ and can protect \nplants from excessive sunlight, wind, and heavy rains.  Lorenzo\
    \ et \nal.[47] reported that movable shade under intense sunlight in Spain \n\
    caused 10% increase in the marketable yield of greenhouse tomato.  \nOther reports\
    \ indicated that external and internal shading nets \nreduced horizontal and vertical\
    \ gradients in air temperature \ncompared with those without shading nets[48].\
    \  Results of a study \non the effect of roof height of a large screen-house on\
    \ the \nventilation rate using one-dimensional computational model and \npreliminary\
    \ measurements showed that increasing roof height by 2 \nm increases both temperature\
    \ and humidity levels in the canopy \nlayer[49].  Microclimate, air velocity,\
    \ ventilation efficiency, and \nlight transmittance are mainly influenced by the\
    \ properties of the \nnet-screen mesh and the greenhouse shape.  While these structures\
    \ \nenhance natural ventilation in hot and humid climate conditions, \nthey still\
    \ require strong shelters for protecting plants from extreme \nsolar radiation,\
    \ rain, and strong winds.  The screen-house itself is \nan important pest protection\
    \ device, provided it is equipped with \nfine mesh screens in all openings, and\
    \ a double-door system. \n2.2  Light control and artificial lights \nThe main\
    \ approaches for controlling light level and the \nintercepted radiance in CEA\
    \ are through planted density, shading \nscreens, and artificial lights.  Light\
    \ condition and air temperature \nare the two most important environmental factors\
    \ for plants growth.  \nIn fact, discussions about optimal air temperature without\
    \ including \nlight condition and plant evapotranspiration does not generate any\
    \ \nuseful data for maximizing yield and producing high-quality \nvegetable. \
    \ Light and air temperature are intrinsically related and \nit is a well-known\
    \ fact that one cannot be optimized without \nconsidering the other.  For example,\
    \ tomato quality, including \nyield, productivity and lycopene value is not only\
    \ affected by the \nmicroclimate parameters and cultural experience, but with\
    \ the \nPhotosynthetic Photon Flux Density (PPFD).  In fact, it is the \noptimal\
    \ combination of air temperature, relative humidity, and light \nthat will result\
    \ in maximum yield (assuming that other factors such \nas CO2, soil pH, and nutrient\
    \ are not limiting).  A schematic \ndiagram is presented in Figure 2 to illustrate\
    \ the effects of light \nspectral, intensity and photoperiod on plant growth,\
    \ along with a \ncomparison between spectral power distribution of natural and\
    \ \nartificial light sources, and the plant’s response to irradiance level. \n\

    \ distribution of natural and artificial light sources and light response curve\
    \ of plants  \n \nThe most common artificial light sources that are used in \n\
    modern greenhouses and CEAs are incandescent/halogen lamps, \ndischarge lamps\
    \ (such as fluorescent light tubes, Metal Halide, \nand high-pressure sodium lamps),\
    \ and the Light-emitting diodes \n(LEDs).  Among these, LEDs have gained significant\
    \ popularity \nin the research and development communities due to their \nadvantages\
    \ such as cost efficiency, compact design, durability, \nlight quality, and low\
    \ thermal energy generation.  Research on \nLEDs as a substitute for plant growth\
    \ began in 1980s; however it \nwas only after mid-2000s that they became economically\
    \ feasible \nfor large scale commercial production.  These devices reduce \nthe\
    \ costs of electricity by using plant from effectual \nJanuary, 2018         \

    \ to directed light wavelengths.  \nMoreover, the compact design of LEDs that\
    \ located close to the \nplants, allows the structure of various layers of plant\
    \ production \nto stack vertically in CEA, while decreasing the costs of cooling\
    \ \ncompared with other artificial light sources.  Nowadays the \nfunctional costs\
    \ of LEDs are a high-priority study and advance \nsubject for upcoming greenhouse-based\
    \ plant factories.  In the \ncase of tomatoes, shading affects biosynthesis and\
    \ carotene level \nof lycopene.  According to the study of Cockshull et al.[50],\
    \ plant \nfactory yield will be reduced by 20% by utilizing a cover with \n23%\
    \ shade.  Yields also will be enriched with color shaded in \nplant factories\
    \ in hot weathers.  Yet, color shades can be \ndisadvantageous in areas with limited\
    \ sunlight hours in cloudy \nand cold climates.  In fact, choosing suitable planting\
    \ density \ncan increase crop water output and improve light capture.  On \nthe\
    \ other hand, the planting density has an effect on the harvest of \ntomato in\
    \ greenhouse growing system and evapotranspiration \n(ET)[51].  According to the\
    \ reports of several studies, factors \nsuch as numbers of flowering, fruits location\
    \ in per plant and \nsingle fruit weight were all lesser with more density of\
    \ planting, \ntherefore, resulting in lesser harvests[52-54].  In another study,\
    \ Ilić \net al.[55] showed that in the tomato factory, by using red shade \nnetting\
    \ techniques the lycopene content highly increased, \nhowever, these fruits had\

    \ are described \nunder 40% by El-Aidy and El-Afry[56] and 35% by El-Gizawy et\
    \ \nal.[57] Moreover, El-Gizawy et al.[57] claimed that by increasing \ncovering\
    \ intensity, the production of tomato will increase up to \n51%.  The soil surface\
    \ will lose its moisture in plants faster by \nabsorbing the more radiant energy,\
    \ but, the high density of \ntomato plants caused less radiation at the soil surface[52].\
    \ \n2.3  Efficiency of microclimate controller \nAn efficient greenhouse requires\
    \ environment control for air \nquality, disease reduction, pest control, and\
    \ nutrient and water \nuptake.  The inputs and outs of a greenhouse system are\
    \ shown \nschematically in Figure 3.  The quality of air is governed by \nfactors\
    \ such as air and root-zone temperature, humidity, carbon \ndioxide, air movement,\
    \ dust, odors and disease agents.  Other \nvariables in the greenhouse environment\
    \ that affect plant’s life are \nlight condition, soil feeding solution pH and\
    \ electrical conductivity.  \nThese parameters and the problems associated with\
    \ each have been \nextensively discussed by several textbooks, see for example\
    \ \nHochmuth and Hochmuth[58], Cherie[59] and Jones[60].  Plant \ngrowth responses\
    \ to other influencing factors and climate changes \nsuch as carbon dioxide and\
    \ wind speed have been discussed in the \ntextbook of Morison and Morecroft[61].\
    \  In general, microclimate \nparameters in a CEA are manipulated by passive and\
    \ active \nventilation, \nevaporative \ncooling \ntechniques, \nshadings, \nand\
    \ \nrefrigeration dehumidification.  Several methods based on the \nFans Assessment\
    \ Numeration System (FANS) for evaluation of the \nventilation performance and\
    \ suggestions for the energy efficiency \nof greenhouse fans are presented in\
    \ [62].  It should be noted that \nthe high operating costs of air-conditioners\
    \ make them impractical \nfor commercial application. \n \nFigure 3  Inputs and\
    \ outputs of controlled environment agriculture \n \nThe efficiency of active\
    \ systems, i.e., fan and pad evaporative \ncooling, has been widely studied and\
    \ modeled for modular \ngreenhouses that use mechanical ventilation[63,64], but\
    \ research \nworks on their use alongside natural ventilation in greenhouses in\
    \ \nsemiarid climates are narrow[65].  Reports showed that when \nventilation\
    \ fan belts were adjusted to the proper tension, the fan \nspeed and airflow rate\
    \ were respectively 13.1% and 30.1% higher \nthan those of original belts[62].\
    \  The same study also reports that \nthe daily average energy consumption for\
    \ the ventilation fan with \nthe original loose belts was 20.4% higher than that\
    \ with the \nadjusted belts when the pad was not working, and 24.2% higher \n\
    with pad working.  There are theoretical and experimental studies \nwhich compare\
    \ the effects of fogging and fixed shading systems on \nthe Mediterranean greenhouse\
    \ climate[66]; however, the assessment \nof mobile shading is not well documented.\
    \  In order to determine \nthe size of fans and pads for evaporative cooling,\
    \ the volume of the \ngreenhouse needs to be calculated.  An air exchange (m3/min)\
    \ of 1 \nto 1.5 times of the greenhouse volume is recommended every \nminute[16].\
    \  The number of fans should be selected based on the air \nexchange and by taking\
    \ into account that their placement should \nnot be spaced more than 7.6 m apart.\
    \  According to Duan et al.[67], \na properly operated typical swamp cooler has\
    \ the potential to cool \nair within 3°C to 4°C of the wet-bulb temperature. \
    \ These units \ncost less than air-conditioner and consume 60% to 80% less \n\
    electricity; however, they are only practical for small greenhouses \nin hot dry\
    \ regions.  Another form of evaporative cooling is \nmisting which reduces plant\
    \ moisture loss and leaf transpiration by \nreducing its temperature due to evaporative\
    \ cooling.  Misting is \n6   January, 2018                         Int J Agric\

    \  Vol. 11 No.1 \ncategorized into low-pressure and high-pressure (also known\
    \ as \nfog-cooling).  In fog-cooling systems, high-pressure water is \npassed\
    \ through nozzles with orifice sizes usually less than 10 μm.  \nA fan then blows\
    \ the extremely small droplets of water into \ngreenhouse air and reduces temperature\
    \ through an evaporative \nprocess.  These systems are usually used in greenhouse\
    \ cooling \nfor seed germination and propagation.  A major drawback of this \n\
    method is that it creates high humidity climate inside canopies \nwhich facilitates\
    \ the development of bacterial diseases, such as \nalgae and botrytis.  Several\
    \ recommendations for obtaining \nbetter cooling results with misting are available\
    \ in the work of \nSchnelle and Dole[68].  Low and high-pressure fogging systems\
    \ \nin a naturally ventilated greenhouse have been studied and \ncompared by Li\
    \ and Willits[69], suggesting that compared to the \nlow-pressure fogging system,\
    \ the average evaporation efficiency \nfor the high-pressure system was at least\
    \ 64% greater.  \nMoreover, the cooling efficiency of the high-pressure system\
    \ was \nat least 28% greater than for the low-pressure system.  \nDetermination\
    \ of cooling efficiencies for misting and fogging \nsystems is available in the\
    \ work of Abdel-Ghany and Kozai[70].  \nThe efficiency of an evaporative cooling\
    \ system is calculated by \nout\ncool\nout\nwb\nT\nT\nη\nT\nT\n\n\n\n as given\
    \ in the ASABE standards[71].  Here, Tout \nis the outdoor air temperature, °C;\
    \ Tcool is the temperature of air \nexiting the cooling pad, °C, and Twb is the\
    \ wet-bulb temperature \nof the outside air, °C. \nMeasurement and data analysis\
    \ for greenhouse evaporative \ncooling are discussed in the work of Kittas et\
    \ al.[72] A decrease in \nair temperature by 4°C to 5°C inside a greenhouse with\
    \ \npad-and-fan evaporative cooling is reported by Jain and Tiwari[73].  \nPerformance\
    \ of a two-stage pad cooling system in broiler houses \nwas analyzed by Petek\
    \ et al.[74] showing that the resulting air \ntemperature and relative humidity\
    \ were significantly lower than \nthose of the traditional system.  A thermal\
    \ model for prediction of \nmicroclimate factors inside a greenhouse with mechanical\
    \ \nventilation and the evaporative cooling system was introduced by \nWillits[75].\
    \  Their results suggested that in the presence of \nevaporative cooling, increasing\
    \ canopy size is more influential in \nreducing air temperature.  They also concluded\
    \ that without \nevaporative cooling pads, the ratio of energy used for transpiration\
    \ \nto incoming solar energy (known as the evapotranspiration \ncoefficient) is\
    \ predicted to range from 1-75 for an outdoor air \ntemperature of 36.8°C and\
    \ a humidity ratios of 3.3 g/kg, to 0.8°C \nfor an outdoor humidity ratio of 29.9\
    \ g/kg at the same air \ntemperature.  In another study, Max et al.[76] investigated\
    \ the \neffects of greenhouse cooling methods, including mechanical \nventilation\
    \ and evaporative cooling, on yield and quality of tomato \nin tropical climates.\
    \  It was found that the proportion of \nmarketable yield was significantly higher\
    \ in a net-screen covered \ngreenhouse with mechanical ventilation, and the quantity\
    \ of \nundersized and blossom-end rot affected fruits was reduced in \npolyethylene\
    \ film covered greenhouse with the evaporative cooling \nmethod.  The researchers\
    \ then concluded that in regions with high \nrelative humidity, evaporative cooling\
    \ without customized \nadjustments for dehumidification will not improve closed-field\
    \ \nproduction of tomato. \nPassive cooling methods, including natural ventilation\
    \ and \nshading, are widely practiced in greenhouses, especially those in \ntropical\
    \ regions, by means of non-adjustable, manually adjustable, \nor automatically\
    \ controlled.  Natural ventilation is caused by the \nstack effect, wind ventilation,\
    \ or both.  Ventilation for air \ntemperature control is efficient only when outside\
    \ air temperature \nof the greenhouse is less than inside.  Some of the factors\
    \ to be \ntaken into account for designing of a proper naturally ventilated \n\
    greenhouse are the location of the structure, insulation, ceiling \nslope and\
    \ ventilation openings.  Various references have \nconcluded that using natural\
    \ ventilation, it is more difficult to \nuniformly distribute fresh air in wider\
    \ greenhouse structures[77,78].  \nA comprehensive review of ventilation systems\
    \ is available in the \nworks of Ganguly and Ghosh[79].  The air inlet and outlet\
    \ size for \nnatural ventilation are determined based on stack effect theory as\
    \ \nexpressed by the Equation (1).   The steady-state heat balance for \ndetermination\
    \ of maximum ventilation rate requires heat gains to \nbe equal to heat losses\
    \ and is given by Equation (2).  This \nequation is used to determine: (i) the\
    \ required ventilation rate to \nmaintain a given inside temperature for a given\
    \ heater capacity; (ii) \nthe minimum outside temperature (balance temperature)\
    \ to \nmaintain the desired inside temperature without using supplemental \nheat\
    \ (qh=0) at a given ventilation rate; and (iii) the size of heater \nrequired\
    \ to maintain the desired inside temperature for a given \nventilation rate and\

    \   7 \nmost popular greenhouse monitoring frameworks, the wireless \nsensor networks\
    \ (WSN), and the IoT based systems, which have \nredirected greenhouse measurement\
    \ concentration to a new level \nfor improving efficiency and viability. \n3.1\
    \  Wireless sensor networks \nResearch and development in greenhouses in the early\
    \ 2000s \nbegan to adopt wireless communication technology for monitoring, \n\
    sending early warning messages, and remote control using \nsimplified rules. \
    \ One of the earliest reports of WSN application in \ngreenhouse environment monitoring\
    \ can be found in the work of \nSerôdio \net \nal.[92] \n \nThe \ncompact \nsize,\
    \ \nreliability, \nand \ncost-effectiveness of WSN modules, as well as flexibility\
    \ for \ndeveloping custom applications besides easy installation, have \nmade\
    \ this technology gain attention and popularity for monitoring \nand control in\
    \ open-field[93,94] and in closed-field environment \nagriculture. \n \nSource:\
    \ www.AdaptiveAgroTech.com. \nFigure 4  General components and instrumentations\
    \ in a typical greenhouse environmental monitoring \n \nAn interesting application\
    \ of WSN in greenhouse includes CO2 \nmanagement[95] and multipoint measurements\
    \ of microclimate for \nmonitoring spatial gradients and three-dimensional changes\
    \ in \nparameters during the cultivation process[96].  For example, Ji et \nal.[97]\
    \ developed a WSN for precision control of CO2 fertilizer with \nan improved method\
    \ for prediction of tomato photosynthetic rate.  \nA computerized horticulture\
    \ data management system that is \naddressed in [92] was developed by implementing\
    \ WSN, controller \narea \nnetwork \n(CAN), \nand \nseveral \ninternet \nand \n\
    email \ncommunication tools, and was able to support distributed data \nmonitoring\
    \ and control inside the greenhouse environment.  \nMorais et al.[93] reported\
    \ the architecture of a WSN platform called \nMPWiNodeZ, a mesh-type array of\
    \ acquisition devices that was \ndesigned based on ZigBee multi-powered wireless\
    \ acquisition \ndevice for the purpose of remote sensing applications in precision\
    \ \nhorticulture.  A remarkable advantage of this platform is the \npower management\
    \ capability that allows the system to \ncontinuously operate in large coverage\
    \ areas where connection \nstability and power sources are a concern.  A simple\
    \ deterministic \nWSN based on IEEE 802.15.4 and XMesh protocol for online \n\
    monitoring and control of air temperature and relative humidity \nwith several\
    \ sensors nodes that were placed inside the greenhouse \nin a uniform gridded\
    \ topology is presented in the work of Pahuja et \nal.[98]  The authors used a\
    \ network health analyzer and found that \nwhile the data reliability was 100%,\
    \ their network mean packet \nreliability was between 75%-100% due to the packet\
    \ losses.  This \nfailure can be related to the canopy coverage and sensors occluded\
    \ \nby the dense plantation which reduces the signal strength of the \nnodes.\
    \  This network was integrated into a multiple inputs and \nmultiple outputs fuzzy\
    \ logic based controller and an RS-485 \nactuator network to manipulate the greenhouse\
    \ vapor pressure \ndeficit.  Prima et al.[91] developed and evaluated a simple\
    \ and \nflexible remote environmental monitoring and control based on a \ncloud\
    \ platform.  They implemented a local-global management \nstrategy supporting\
    \ synchronization of online and offline system \nconfiguration, actuation, and\
    \ offline management to respond to the \nunstable network connection in the rural\
    \ area.  They tested the \nfunctionality of their system during a 10-day data\
    \ collection period \nfor automated monitoring of soil moisture content and fertigation\
    \ \ncontrol in tomato cultivation.  Their results showed that under \nunstable\
    \ network, the system only had 0.78% error, and provided \n99.2% in-range soil\
    \ moisture content measurement, which shows \nthe potential for long-term microclimate\
    \ monitoring application in \ngreenhouses.   \nAn important consideration in designing\
    \ of an efficient WSN \nfor the greenhouse is the number of nodes, their location,\
    \ distances \nbetween nodes, antenna and the operating frequency based on the\
    \ \ngreenhouse microclimate condition.  Studies showed that radio \nwave propagation\
    \ is strongly affected by the high greenhouse \nenvironment[99].  Several other\
    \ connectivity issues with WSN in \nthe greenhouse have been addressed in [100]\
    \ using connection \nmatrix to estimate the network connectivity in the disconnected\
    \ \nspots.  For this purpose, Chen et al.[100] established a remote \nmonitoring\
    \ \nsystem \nin \nan \nexperimental \ngreenhouse using \nZigBee-based WSN which\
    \ could monitor air temperature, humidity \nand light intensity as well as the\
    \ wireless link quality.  Their \nresults showed that by adding long-distance\
    \ backup routing nodes, \nnetwork connectivity can be guaranteed in the spots\

    \ based on star and mesh network \narchitecture for monitoring air temperature,\
    \ relative humidity, and \nsoil moisture content inside the greenhouse is available\
    \ in the work \nof Zhou et al.[101] More recently, Azaza et al.[102] presented\
    \ a smart \ntype-2 fuzzy logic based control system to manage the greenhouse \n\
    microclimate with attention to the effectiveness, the energy use and \nthe production\
    \ costs.  They integrated an observer and smart \nautomation system into the control\
    \ process by using a wireless data \nmonitoring platform enabling a distance data\
    \ measurement.  Their \nmethod also provided a real-time data access and building\
    \ database \nthat can be used for future enhancement of the system accuracy and\
    \ \ndecisions making.  The efficiency of their proposed monitoring \nand control\
    \ system was validated through a comparative study by \nevaluating the energy\
    \ saving (22%), and the water use (33%). \n3.2  IoT-based monitoring \nThe traditional\
    \ data monitoring techniques in greenhouse \nfrequently suffer from lack of sharing\
    \ and availability, great \nlabor-intensity, low spatiotemporal resolution, a\
    \ lack of data \ncentralization, and organizational management in observing the\
    \ \nenvironmental aspects of a greenhouse.  The IoT offers an \nexcellent opportunity\
    \ not only in greenhouse environment \nmonitoring but as a method for non-destructive\
    \ quantification of \nphysiological factors of the cultivated plants to be shared\
    \ within a \nnetwork of other greenhouse producers.  The potential \ngreenhouse\
    \ applications of IoT cover a variety of scenarios.  \nGeneral components of a\

    \  General components of a greenhouse environmental monitoring based in wireless\
    \ sensor network and IoT concept \n \nThe main element in the IoT is the network,\
    \ which has made \npossible a breakthrough in data communication and sharing for\
    \ \ngreenhouse monitoring and control.  It contains several physical \nitems,\
    \ software, and sensors that are linked with wires or wirelessly \nthrough standard\
    \ communication protocols[103].  Both academic \nand industry sections have shown\
    \ interest in greenhouse \napplications of IoT[104].  In fact, IoT has been used\
    \ in many areas \nof researchers, such as: smart city[105], agriculture[106,107]\
    \ and \nhealthcare[108-110], and is changing the traditional farming \nobservation\
    \ approaches by quickly providing quantitative data with \neffective spatiotemporal\
    \ resolution.  For example, long-term past \ninformation collected by IoT applications\
    \ can be an offer to a local \ngreenhouse community to conduct combined pest and\
    \ disease \nmanagement agendas in order to stop spreading of the associated \n\
    damages.  These data can also improve cultural practices and \ndecision making\
    \ plans[107].  An application of this technology can \nbe found in the work of\
    \ Liao et al.[111] who developed an IoT \nmonitoring system to simultaneously\
    \ screen the growth condition \nof Phalaenopsis and the environmental features\
    \ of an orchid plant \nfactory.  For example, Peng et al.[112] showed that by\
    \ using a \nspectroscopic and spectrometer investigation can correctly provide\
    \ \nthe total of orchid chlorophyll.   \nMoreover, Lin and Hsu[113] applied a\
    \ chlorophyll fluorometer \nin their study.  The monitored the photosynthetic\
    \ status of \nPhalaenopsis under diverse lighting situations.  Although the \n\
    physiological analysis is often occupied manually, these \nexamination approaches\
    \ need tools with perfect accuracy to \nnondestructively \ndegree \nphysiological\
    \ \nfactors \nof \norchids.  \nFurthermore, because of the cost, farmers will\
    \ not use highly \nprecise tools to measure physiological factors of orchids.\
    \  With \nscalability and flexibility of IoT, growers can have an excellent \n\
    opportunity to meet such observing demands[109]. \n4  Environmental control and\
    \ energy optimization \nThis section reviews some of the recently published works\
    \ on \nthe advances in microclimate modeling and control, greenhouse \nenergy\

    \  The control of the microclimate in a greenhouse is a \nhigh-level task because\
    \ of the number of involved variables that are \ncoupled and interrelated, making\
    \ a complex non-linear system.   \nSome of the earlier attempts to apply advanced\
    \ control \nJanuary, 2018           Shamshiri R R, et al.  Advances in greenhouse\

    \   9 \ntechniques for greenhouse environment can be found in the works \nof Caponetto\
    \ et al.[114], Pan et al.[115], Lin[116], Castañeda-Miranda et \nal.[117] and\
    \ Xu et al.[118] Recent advances in computer simulation \nand artificial intelligence\
    \ have worked their way into greenhouse \nenvironment modeling and predictions.\
    \  Identifications and \nmodellings of different parameters in greenhouses have\
    \ been topics \nof numerous research works that aimed at improving production\
    \ \nefficiency (i.e., higher yield and quality, maximum return) by \nevaluating\
    \ and adjusting microclimate parameters and modeling of \nmicrometeorology[119,120].\
    \  The level of approaches vary from \nsimple models and timer-based feedback\
    \ controls[121,122] to more \nadvanced solutions, such as model-free control strategy[123],\
    \ \nnonlinear control methods[124], adaptive control and adaptive \nmanagement\
    \ framework[120,125], robust[126], optimal control[127-132], \nenergy balance\
    \ models[133], and model-based predictive control[134].  \nAn important drawback\
    \ in utilizing advanced control methods in a \nCEA is the difficulty in developing\
    \ the dynamic model to simulate \nthe behavior of the variables.  Ultimately,\
    \ the goal of any of these \ncontrol systems is to minimize the input cost per\
    \ unit of production \nand to increase the return by achieving high yield and\
    \ quality. \nThe success of greenhouse systems analysis relies on the \neffective\
    \ use of information.  To meet these requirements, various \ncontrol strategies\
    \ based on complex algorithms of artificial \nintelligence have been discussed\
    \ in the literature.  For example, \nfuzzy systems have achieved significant results\
    \ in the area of \nprecision irrigation[135] and microclimate control.  Several\
    \ \ntechniques and approaches have been presented, including \ninverting \nfuzzy\
    \ \nmodel[136], \nreconfigurable \nadaptive \nfuzzy \nfault-hiding \ncontrol[137],\
    \ \nTakagiSugeno \nfuzzy \nmodeling[138], \nconventional fuzzy logic control for\
    \ smart greenhouses[102], and \ndecentralized decoupling fuzzy logic controller[139].\
    \  These \nsolutions have shown a more effective set-point tracking compared \n\
    with \nthe \nconventional \nPID \ncontrollers. \n \nFor \nexample, \nEl-Madbouly\
    \ et al.[137] designed an active fault-tolerant control \nsystem to fix of the\
    \ device or sensor errors in weather system of a \ngreenhouse.  This control scheme\
    \ involves a self-tuned fuzzy \nproportional-integral \n(PI) \ncontrol \nscheme,\

    \ faulty \neffects, and a reliable and sensitive observer-based fault detection\
    \ \nand diagnosis (FDD) system for diverse kinds of errors in the \npresence of\
    \ scheme disorderliness.  A set of practical actuators \nand sensors were applied\
    \ in this method to renovate the closed-loop \nconsistency and also to confirm\
    \ correct tracking of resource inputs.  \nAzaza et al.[102] introduced a smart\
    \ fuzzy logic based control \nscheme and upgraded by a special measure to the\
    \ humidity \nrelationship and temperature.  Also, the scheme control was \nimproved\
    \ with wireless information observing platform for \ninformation routing and logging\
    \ which prepares actual time of \ninformation entree. \n4.2  Energy analysis and\
    \ optimization models \nEnergy management strategies for optimizing greenhouse\
    \ \ncost[104] require a comprehensive research and knowledge and \nunderstanding\
    \ of climate condition, greenhouse systems, and \nplants’ requirements.  Some\
    \ of these research involves practicing \ninnovative concepts of energy conservation\
    \ and clean-energy using \nmathematical models[141,142], determining energy load\
    \ using \nbuilding energy simulation models[143], computational fluid \ndynamics\
    \ method[119,144,145], or providing optimal growth condition \nwith \nminimum\
    \ \nenvironmental \nimpacts[120,146,147]. \n \nOther \nresearchers have proposed\
    \ optimization methods for maximizing \nthe returns.  See for example the works[148]\
    \ in which a dynamic \nmodel of a greenhouse tomato and the optimal control problem\
    \ for \nthe seasonal benefit of the grower has been presented.  A \nformulation\
    \ of the optimal control problem for minimizing energy \ninput to the greenhouse\
    \ with a dynamic energy balance was \npresented by van Beveren et al.[149] and\
    \ later expanded in [150] to \ninclude humidity balance.  Incrocci et al.[151]\
    \ proposed that \noptimal CO2 concentration in the greenhouse can be based on\
    \ an \neconomic evaluation.  To maintain a given CO2 concentration \nwithin the\
    \ greenhouse, the supply must balance the assimilated CO2 \nflux to the outside\
    \ air due to ventilation.  Linker et al.[152] \noptimized greenhouse operation\
    \ and in particular CO2 control, \nusing a neural network.  Most of these approaches\
    \ have used crop \nmodels and prices of the harvested product.  van Beveren et\
    \ al.[153] \nexpanded this process further by including a dynamic CO2 balance.\
    \  \nThey reported a method to minimize the total energy that is \nrequired to\
    \ heat and cool a greenhouse.  Their research provides a \nmodel to define bounds\
    \ for temperature, humidity, CO2 \nconcentration, the maximum amount of CO2 available,\
    \ and the \neffect of different bounds on optimal energy input.  The addition\
    \ \nof the dynamic CO2 balance provides a truly integrated approach \nthat takes\
    \ all major aspects of greenhouse climate control into \naccount.  This is important,\
    \ given the trade-off between natural \nventilation and the injection of industrial\
    \ CO2, which occurs in a \ngreenhouse with active cooling.  Nadal et al.[154]\
    \ presented an \nenergy and environmental assessment for a roof-top greenhouse\
    \ \nand showed that their greenhouse achieved an annual saving in CO2 \nemissions\
    \ of 113.8 kg/m2 per year, relative to an equivalent \noil-heated greenhouse.\
    \  Vadiee and Martin[155] developed a \ntheoretical model using TRNSYS to carry\
    \ out greenhouse energy \nanalysis.  From the economic feasibility assessment,\
    \ their results \nshowed that the concept has the potential of becoming cost \n\
    effective.  A literature survey on greenhouse energy analysis[156] \nhas concluded\
    \ that evapotranspiration has a significant impact on \nthe micro-climate[156,157].\
    \  This is true since the amount of \nmoisture that is added to the greenhouse\
    \ environment due to \nevapotranspiration helps moderate the vapor pressure deficit.\
    \ \nCurrent advances in CEA systems tend towards sustainability \nand utilizing\
    \ renewable energy by studying wind power, solar \nthermal applications[142] and\
    \ solar energy conservation[141] to \nreduce fuel consumption[158].  For example,\
    \ in tropical and \nsubtropical conditions, the strategy in microclimate control\
    \ is to \nimprove resource efficiency by benefiting from the potentials of \n\
    natural ventilation and shading[120].  In fact, studies of different \ncontrol\
    \ strategies indicated that smart management of natural \nventilation for manipulating\
    \ the environment under specific \nexterior conditions is an effective approach\
    \ to improve productivity \nand increase benefits[124].  A smart tropical greenhouse\
    \ that \noperates on solar panels and benefits from an adaptive design and \n\
    covering materials (i.e., mesh screens) will maximize the use of \nnatural and\
    \ mechanical ventilation[144, 159-162] and will be less \ndependent \non \nhigher-cost\
    \ \ncooling \nmethods \nsuch \nas \nevaporative[67,163-167] and high pressure\
    \ fogging systems[168].  \nNevertheless, the use of anti-insect screens decreases\
    \ the natural \nventilation capacity and aggravates thermal conditions.  It is\
    \ \ntherefore unrealistic to completely eliminate other means of cooling, \n10\

    \  A comprehensive \nreview of advances in greenhouse microclimate control and\
    \ \nautomation system for tropical regions is available in [169]. \n4.3  Environment\
    \ prediction and yield estimation models \nGreenhouse growers use prediction tools\
    \ for the weather \nforecast, photosynthesis predictions for plant growth progress[170],\
    \ \npredicting disease[171], simulation of yield[172], and production \nplanning\
    \ and cost-benefit analysis.  Some of the earlier examples \nof climate models\
    \ to predict the temperature and humidity inside a \ngreenhouse can be found in\
    \ the works of [7, 173-176].  A thermal \nmodel for prediction of microclimate\
    \ factors inside a greenhouse \nwith mechanical ventilation and an evaporative\
    \ cooling system was \nintroduced by Willits[75].  More recent mathematical models\
    \ for \npredicting greenhouse microclimate from external data have been \naddressed\
    \ in [121, 177-180].  An innovative air temperature \nprediction model based on\
    \ least squares and support vector \nmachine with optimized parameters using an\
    \ improved particle \nswarm optimization (IPSO) technique is presented in [181].\
    \  The \nauthors compared and validated the performance of their model \nwith\
    \ conventional modeling techniques by predicting the air \ntemperature in a solar\
    \ greenhouse.  Another example is KASPRO, \nan advanced dynamic model for microclimate\
    \ prediction in \ngreenhouses[176,182].  This model consists of sub-functions\
    \ based \non mass and energy balance of the greenhouse environment.  A \ndetailed\
    \ description of this model is presented in the work of \nRigakis et al.[78] This\
    \ model was used by Graamans et al.[183] to \ndescribe crop transpiration and\
    \ energy balance in plant factories by \ndetermining vapor flux and the relation\
    \ between latent and sensible \nheat exchange for production of lettuce. \nSustainable\
    \ development of modern greenhouse production \nsystems also requires yield estimation\
    \ models and knowledge- \nbased information software for adaptive management of\
    \ resources.  \nSince it is impossible to actually plant and experiment with every\
    \ \nsingle greenhouse design and climate scenario, mathematical \nmodels for simulation\
    \ of yields and growth responses are \nessential for achieving high yield at low\
    \ cost.  These models can \nalso contribute to the optimization and management\
    \ of \ngreenhouse energy under adverse climate conditions.  An early \nexample\
    \ includes the work of Gary et al.[184] in which an \neducational software called\
    \ SIMULSERRE for simulating \ngreenhouse plant system was developed.  Some of\
    \ the \nwell-known simulation models for tomato plants include \nTOMSIM[185],\
    \ TOMPOUSSE[186,187] and TOMGRO[188,189].  A \ncommon weakness with these models\
    \ is that their parameters are \nspecific for the climate condition and greenhouse\
    \ design that they \nwere derived from.  In addition, because of the complexity\
    \ of \nthe interactions between the greenhouse elements and the crop \nitself,\
    \ it is often impossible to correctly predict microclimate \neffects on the final\
    \ yield with the same model parameters.  One \nof the most widely accepted yield\
    \ simulation models is the \nTOMGRO[189] in which the author claimed that “it\
    \ is possible to \nuse the same reduced model with parameters estimated at one\
    \ \nlocation to simulate leaf area and above-ground weight of tomato \ngrowing\
    \ in greenhouse conditions in other locations”.  The first \nversion of TOMGRO[188]\
    \ and the third version[190], respectively \nhad 69 and 574 state variables for\
    \ simulation of tomato growth on \nthe basis of three inputs that are measured\
    \ inside greenhouse \nenvironment: \nthe \nphotosynthetically \nactive \nradiation,\
    \ \nmmol/(m2·s), air temperature, °C and CO2 concentration, ppm.  \nA simplified\
    \ version of TOMGRO[189] was developed with the \nobjective of providing a practical\
    \ application and only has five \nsteady-state variables: (i) node number for\
    \ the main stem, (ii) leaf \narea index, (iii) total plant dry weight (WT), (iv)\
    \ total fruit dry \nweight (WF), and (v) mature fruit dry weight (WM).  Jones\
    \ et \nal.[189] provided simulation results for three tomato varieties \nincluding\
    \ DeRuiters, Beefsteak, and Bigboy respectively for three \nexperiment locations\
    \ at Gainesville (Florida), Avignon (France) \nand Lake City (Florida).  Some\
    \ of the studies related to \nevaluation and adaptation of TOMGRO model to specific\
    \ climate \nconditions and cultural practices can be found in the works of \n\
    [172, 191, 192].  It should be noted that the simplified \nTOMGRO model only takes\
    \ into account the effect of air \ntemperature and light condition, and other\
    \ important variables \nsuch as CO2 concentration were not included in this version.\
    \  In \naddition, Jones et al.[189] did not take the work any farther than \n\
    making the model calculations in an Excel spreadsheet, hence the \nmodel could\
    \ not be used directly with other models to control \ngreenhouse environments.\
    \  To fill this gap, Shamshiri et al.[193] \nevaluated and verified the performance\
    \ of the reduced state \nvariable version of TOMGRO model of Jones et al.[189]\
    \ using \nboundary data that were expected to result in zero yield output.  \n\
    The hypothesis was to test whether the model parameters are \nrobust enough to\
    \ translate an adverse greenhouse environment \n(with air temperature so high\
    \ to prevent any crop growth \ndevelopment) to realistic biomass and yield.  For\
    \ this purpose, \nShamshiri et al.[193] converted the model from spreadsheets\
    \ \nformat to Matlab Simulink (The MathWorks Inc, Natick, MA, \nUSA), provided\
    \ a user interface to access the TOMGRO inputs \nand outputs, and replaced the\
    \ lengthy calculation procedures of \nMicrosoft Excel with one-click step operation\
    \ in Matlab.  This \nSimulink model of Shamshiri et al.[193] provided a flexible\
    \ \nplatform for individuals unfamiliar with computer programming \nlanguages\
    \ and crop modeling to have an easy access to the \nTOMGRO model functionality.\
    \  It was shown that the designed \nSimulink model can be used reliably as a replacement\
    \ for the \nspreadsheet version of TOMGRO model.  Additional research \nworks\
    \ with experimental and simulated based studies for \ninvestigating the effects\
    \ of structure design, covering materials \nand \ncontrol \nsystems \non \ngreenhouse\
    \ \nmicroclimate, \ncrop \ntranspiration, and expected yields are available in\
    \ the works of \n[51, 55, 76, 120, 193, 194]. \n4.4  Decision support systems\
    \ \nThe management of production in a greenhouse requires \ndecision making on\
    \ several tasks and time scales.  These \ndecisions are mainly related to management\
    \ of the crop growth \nconditions[195], the culture period and practice such as\
    \ seedling \nproduction[196], event-based irrigation[197] and the control and\
    \ \nmanagement \nof \nenvironment \nbased \ngrowth \nmodels[198].  \nResearch\
    \ and development in decision support system (DSS) for \ngreenhouse application\
    \ began during the 1990s, primarily for \nrecommending microclimate reference\
    \ values and set-points, and \nfor pest and disease management.  Early studies\
    \ included the \nworks of Fisher et al.[199], Clarke et al.[195] and Sun et al.[200].\
    \  A \nDSS was built by Tchamitchian et al.[201] based on the \nJanuary, 2018\

    \ \nabout the climate control regime that can quantify the energy \ncosts based\
    \ on different control strategies.  More recent studies \ncan be found in the\
    \ works of Cañadas et al.[203] and Aiello et al.[204] \nAn interactive decision\
    \ support system (DSS) developed by \nShort et al.[205] based on the HYTODMOD\
    \ growth response \nmodel of El-Attal[206] is available to describe the optimality\
    \ \ndegrees of air temperature and relative humidity at five growth \nstages and\
    \ under three light conditions (night, sun and cloud).  \nThese functions were\
    \ tested and validated by four independent \nexpert growers and were results of\
    \ experiments with tomato \ncultivar “Carusso” in an A-Shade greenhouse located\
    \ at the Ohio \nAgriculture Research and Development Center with a floor area\
    \ \nof 7.3 m2.  In order to build a model for defining the optimality \ndegrees\
    \ of VPD at different light conditions and growth stages of \ntomato, Shamshiri\
    \ et al.[207] integrated the growth response model \nof El-Attal[206] and developed\
    \ the OptVPD model (Figure 6) with \na series of membership function that take\
    \ VPD (kPa) as input, and \ngenerate a real number between 0 and 1 as output.\
    \  The effects \nof air temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH) on the \noptimality\
    \ degree of VPD based on this model are shown in \nFigure 6.  The knowledge behind\
    \ these functions and the \noptimal and failure microclimate values were condensed\
    \ from \nextensive peer-reviewed \nscientific published \nresearch on \ngreenhouse\
    \ cultivation of tomato and physiology, with the goal of \nsimultaneously achieving\
    \ high yield and high-quality fruit.  \nShamshiri et al.[120] extended and implemented\
    \ TOMGRO model \nin SIMULINK and interfaced it with the HYTODMOD and \nOptVPD\
    \ for microclimate evaluation and yield estimation (Figure \n7).  The interfaced\
    \ HYTODMOD, OptVPD, and TOMGRO \nmodels can be used as a DSS tool for evaluation\
    \ purpose by \nexploring \noptimality \ndegrees \nof \nthe \nmicroclimate \nand\
    \ \nmacroclimate parameters as well as yield estimation depending \non the growth\
    \ stage of the plant and different light condition.  It \nallows growers to manually\
    \ change the values of the growing \nparameters as well as the growth stages and\
    \ receive a feedback by \nmeans of a number between 0 and 1 representing how close\
    \ that \nparameter is to high yield and high quality.  An application of \nthis\
    \ DSS has been presented for dynamic assessment[208], \nmeasuring optimality degrees[46],\
    \ and comparative evaluation of \nmicroclimate parameters[193] in greenhouses\
    \ with different \ncovering materials.  Microclimate evaluation with VPD \ninfluences\
    \ the energy costs involved in greenhouse cultivation \nand must be taken into\
    \ account in humidity and temperature \ncontrol algorithms.  A more in-depth analysis\
    \ and practical \nexamples of this DSS is presented by Shamshiri et al.[120] via\
    \ an \nadaptive management framework.  This framework provides a \nflexible platform\
    \ for altering each participating variables in the \ngreenhouse.  It simulates\
    \ growth and environment responses in \ndifferent light condition, growth stages,\
    \ growing season and \nlocation.  The result is a cost-benefit analysis that shows\
    \ at what \nlevel each combination of variables is close to the optimal \nrequirements.\

    \ (UA) \nThe fast growth of global population is changing the food \nproduction\
    \ systems to keep up with the growing demands.  \nAgricultural innovation and\
    \ research in the past three decades, \ncombined with the advances in information\
    \ technology have \nintroduced promising cultivation techniques that are valuable\
    \ for \nsustainability and economic viability of CEA.  Ellis[209] described \n\
    that throughout the history, agriculture has always been associated \nwith urban\
    \ centers, much more than it is imagined today.  While \ntraditional and modern\
    \ agriculture have been separated in the upper \nlayers, they are still attached\
    \ to each other in the roots.  Today, \nfood, as well as animal livestock, is\
    \ surrounding us everywhere, \nand the question about the origin of this supply\
    \ is not a concern \nanymore.  By the late 2000s, major cities reached the point\
    \ that \nmost people did not even need to associate food with natural \nresources[210].\
    \ \nThe concepts in UA and the associated facilities have \nreceived significant\
    \ attention and popularity in the last 8 years, \nand are growing to meet the\
    \ needs of the ever-developing urban \nlife.  A variety of systems may fall under\
    \ UA concept in \ndifferent scale and possession (Figure 8), ranging from a personal\
    \ \nor local community gardens for social and self-sufficiency \npurposes, to\
    \ complicated systems which involve indoor food \nproduction with the help of\
    \ artificial light or inside factories that \nare capable of controlling the climate\
    \ to produce sensitive plants.  \nSince UA is mostly practiced indoors, it is\
    \ also referred as \nvertical farming (VF)[211], integrated farming inside buildings[212],\
    \ \nand Z-farming (which stands for ZeroAcreageFarming)[213].  \nThis type of\
    \ food production is entering all cities in the world and \nhas attracted public\
    \ interest.  There are new consumers’ needs \nfor fresh food of good quality with\
    \ no damage to nature.  \nSeveral reports indicated that more projects are involved\
    \ in \nbringing farming products into cities[214,215].  “UA is an industry \n\
    that makes, processes and markets food and fuel, mostly in \nreaction to the daily\
    \ need for consumers in a town, city, or \nmetropolitan areas, on land and on\
    \ water spread in the urban and \nsemi-urban area, by employing many methods of\
    \ production, \nusing and recycling natural resources and city wastes to produce\
    \ a \nvariety of products and livestock”[216-219].  In fact, UA is a \nfarming\
    \ movement in the cities for circulation of food and \nnon-food plants and tree\
    \ products.  Some of the suggested \nsolutions for a closed-field production system\
    \ in UA are the plant \nfactories, vertical farming (VA), and rooftop greenhouses.\

    \ a city center \n \n5.1  Vertical farming and rooftop greenhouses \nThe concept\
    \ of VF is not new.  Kaplan[220] explained that VF \nhas been unknown for a long\
    \ time, and was then brought to \nattention in the recent years through the advances\
    \ in technology.  \nLife magazine has published one of the very first sketches\
    \ of a tall \nconstruction that promotes agricultural products for people daily\
    \ \nfood requests as early as 1909.  In 1915, the American geologist \nGilbert\
    \ Ellis Bailey used the concept of the tall multi-story \nbuildings for indoor\
    \ cultivation.  He created the term “Vertical \nFarming” in his book with the\
    \ same title as “Vertical Farming”[221].  \nDesigners and landscape architects\
    \ have frequently looked into the \nconcept, particularly at the end of the 20th\
    \ century.  During the \n1970s until the early 1980s, the Malaysian-born architect,\
    \ Ken \nYeang improved and advanced the ideas of Bailey into an \narchitectural\
    \ project[222,223].  It is called Bioclimatic Skyscraper \n(Menara Mesiniaga)\
    \ that was built in 1992.  In 1993, Nancy Jack \nTodd and John Todd envisioned\
    \ the idea of VF in their book \nentitled “From Eco-Cities to Living Machines”.\
    \  The most recent \nand greatest challenging form of this idea however appeared\
    \ in \n1999 by Dickson Despommier’s, an Emeritus Professor of \nMicrobiology at\
    \ the Columbia University, speculating that a \n30-floor farm on one city block\
    \ could provide food for 50 000 \npeople with vegetables, fruit, eggs and meat,\
    \ explaining that \nhydroponic crops could be grown on upper floors; and the lower\
    \ \nfloors would be suited for chickens and fish that eat plants waste.  \nIn\
    \ the concept of VF, heat and lighting would be provided by \ngeothermal, tidal,\
    \ solar, or other recyclable sources of energy.  \nNitrogen along with other nutrients\
    \ would be sieved from animal \nwaste and maybe from the urban sewage system.\
    \  It should be \nnoted that until 2010, there was no report of evidence for VF\
    \ \nconstruction before it began emerging in USA, Singapore, Japan, \nand Korea.\
    \  In theory, VF is the technique that includes \nlarge-scale food production\
    \ in skyscrapers that makes rapid growth \nand planned production possible through\
    \ managing nutrient \nsolution of crop and the growth context according to hydroponics\
    \ \nmethods.  With the help of cutting-edge greenhouse approaches, \nthese buildings\
    \ can be used as a precision farming system that \npaves the way for the acquisition\
    \ of a safe crop growth through \ncontrolling and supervising of the microenvironment\
    \ using sensors, \ninterfacing gadgets and instrumentation[210,213,224-227]. \n\
    In the recent years, the majority of scientific publications in \nUA have focused\
    \ on different aspects of the VF concept.  For \nexample, Sivamani et al.[228]\
    \ studied the viability of smart \ntechnology used in agriculture as an opportunity\
    \ to be used for \nVF[228,229].  Research findings have shown that VF is a promising\
    \ \ntechnique for providing food for cities in a sustainable way.  \nHowever,\
    \ it is also a function of the location and design[229].  It is \nmentioned that\
    \ VF is a way of feeding and at the same time a \nmovement in the society to reduce\
    \ greenhouse gas emission[219,230].  \nA common debate about VF is the compromising\
    \ between the \nbuilding structure and the returns.  Some estimates that an \n\
    abandoned building can be adapted to the needs of VA, while other \nbelieves that\
    \ only buildings with new design will satisfy that need.  \nA study by Kalantari\
    \ et al.[231] presented several effective VF \nprojects in different countries\
    \ by estimating their feasibility and \nviability in various geographical areas.\
    \  The data was shaped \nbased on the technology of different VF in different\
    \ climate areas.  \nIt was shown by Kalantari et al.[231] that every VF has its\
    \ own \ntechnologies and techniques according to the different geographical \n\
    locations.  Table 1 presents the details of some of effective VF \nprojects in\
    \ different countries and shows the different areas by their \ntype of building\
    \ and typologies.  An interesting example includes \nthe conceptual design of\
    \ the Urban Sky-farm for downtown of \nSeoul is shown in Figure 9 with different\
    \ sections of the structure \nillustrated by labels.  This design was the winner\
    \ of the 2013 \ngreen dot design competition.  The key concept of a vertical farm\
    \ \nis to yield as much crop as possible under optimal circumstances, \neven in\
    \ the center of cities.  Thus, the VF shown in Figure 9 \nincludes many floors\
    \ with a variety of crops on each.  Different \ncrops need different environmental\
    \ conditions.  Therefore, tracing \na crop and its location is of a great significance[228].\
    \ \nVertical farms can be diverse from city to city and their \nstructures also\
    \ vary around the world[210].  The other two \nconceptual designs for vertical\
    \ farms are shown in Figure 10. The \nfirst design (Figure 10a) was designed by\
    \ ODESIGN group for \nAustralia. The other type of VF called urban farming units\
    \ (UFU) \nis shown in Figure 10b, a farm within shipping containers that can \n\
    produce organic fish, fruits, and vegetables in the street. The entire \nprototypes\
    \ are rooted in circular agriculture techniques. The main \ngoals of UFU are to\
    \ find a way to grow food under polluted and \nlimited ground[232]. Figure 10b\
    \ shows a conceptual design of an \nAquaponics farm with fish tanks that can be\
    \ placed inside or close \nto the plant in different levels of the farm.  In this\
    \ system, the \nplants clean and purify the water for the fish, and in return,\
    \ fish \nfeed the plants with their waste as a source of nutrients.  The \nFreight\
    \ Farms in Table 1 is also an example of a vertical farm in a \nshipping container.\
    \ \nAnother solution for UA is the rooftop greenhouse (RTG) and \nbuilding integrated\
    \ rooftop greenhouse (i-RTG) concept.  It is \ndefined as a greenhouse constructed\
    \ on top of a building, usually \nmatched with soilless culture systems[233].\

    \ production benefits \n(including the accessibility of high quality food).  These\

    \  Some experimental research indicated that \ni-RTG has failed to provide proper\

    \ however this issue is not \nconcerning RTG structure.  In comparison to traditional\
    \ greenhouses \nin the region, which are generally unheated, a primary advantage\
    \ of \ni-RTG is their better and more uniform temperature regime, owing \nto the\

    \ are usually used for commercial production of \nleafy greens, but their potential\
    \ remains uncertain.  A general \nstructure design of a plant factory and corresponding\
    \ components \nsections are shown in Figure 11.  In order to achieve economic\
    \ \nviability, the increased resource productivity and/or the value of \nadditional\
    \ services in these structures would have to outweigh the \ndisadvantage of the\
    \ absence of solar energy.  Plant factories have \nbeen primarily used in Asia\
    \ to refer to a commercial plant production \nfactory similar in operations to\
    \ an ordinary industrial firm.  Some \nof the technological instrumentations and\
    \ equipment supporting \nthese factories for deriving the plants to their maximum\
    \ potentials \nare precision sensors, nutrition solution, process controllers,\
    \ \nautomated instruments, computer systems, and environmental \nsupervision along\
    \ with implementation of DSS and task \nmanagement software.  Moreover, a number\
    \ of plant factories also \nbenefits from robotic systems for sorting, transferring,\
    \ and handling \nof the plants, as well as quality control, and post-harvesting.\
    \  Because \nof the relatively higher economic investment that is required for\
    \ \nplant factories, they are managed with resource efficiency and \nproduction\
    \ predictability to attain market-valuable crops. \nIn the Japanese context, there\
    \ existed 165 plant factories which \nare using artificially lighting combined\
    \ with natural solar lights[237].  \nAdditional sub-system might be required in\
    \ plant factories for air \nexchange to eliminate the temperature increase due\
    \ to the artificial \nlight.  Plant factories which have full artificial light\
    \ sources \nusually utilize opaque building materials.  This would offer a \n\
    chance to have the walls and roofs well resistant which makes \ncontrolling the\
    \ internal temperature easier and helps conserve the \nenergy.  Furthermore, often\
    \ the skin facade of the building is \ncovered by a self-cleaning and transparent\
    \ material such as \nEthylene Tetra Fluoro Ethylene (ETFE).  In addition, a material\
    \ \nwhich is highly clear and a high thermal rate are required to \nincrease the\
    \ intensity of sunlight that enters the building.  ETFE is \nlight enough as it\
    \ enjoys only 1% weight of an equal-sized piece of \nglass.  However, it lets\
    \ in 95% of light.  There exists a different \nintensity of pressure between the\
    \ ETFE layers.  Such a pressure \nhelps to close and open the screens so as to\
    \ change the passage of \nsunlight[209].  ETFE which is a standardized construction\
    \ material \nhas been used on an extensive surface of ethereal domes in the \n\
    Eden Project in the south of England[14,238]. \nStudies showed that quantitative\
    \ blue light was able to improve \nphotosynthetic performance or growth through\
    \ motivating \nmorphological as well as physiological responses.  Miyagi et \n\
    al.[239] showed that synergistic effects of monochromic LED \ntogether with high\
    \ CO2 and nutrients can enhance lettuce growth in \na plant factory.  Shimokawa\
    \ et al.[240] concluded that red and blue \nirradiation used at the same time\
    \ improve plant growth more than \nmonochromatic \nand \nfluorescent \nlight \n\
    irradiation. \n \nThese \nresearchers also observed that alternatively use of\
    \ red and blue light \naccelerated plant growth dramatically, with the fresh weight\
    \ of a \nrandomly measured plant that was found to be two times as much \nas the\
    \ usual LED production methods.  The bacterial biofertilizers \nused in plant\
    \ factories may positively affect plant growth in several \n16   January, 2018\

    \ \nFigure 11  General structure design of a plant factory \n \n5.3  Opportunities\
    \ and challenges \nVertical farming entails producing plants in a soil-less culture\
    \ \nwith nutrient solution and deals with problems concerning the use \nof soils,\
    \ including the need for herbicides, pesticides, and \nfertilizers and then it\
    \ supplies healthy organic food which is free \nfrom \nchemicals[213]. \n \nAnother\
    \ \nprivilege \nis \nto \nremove \ntransportation costs and CO2 production which\
    \ accompany the \ncarry-over of foods far away to somewhere near the consumer.\
    \  \nMoreover, products can be provided all-year-round corresponding \nto people’s\
    \ demand.  Furthermore, plant-production conditions \ncan be improved to increase\
    \ the yield by adjusting temperature, \nhumidity, and lighting conditions precisely.\
    \  Indoor agriculture \nin a controlled setting also needs much less water than\
    \ outdoor \nfarming as it involves recycling the graywater and lowering the \n\
    evaporation.  Together with the regulation of temperature and \nhumidity, it can\
    \ also decrease or omit the effects of seasonality.  \nFreshwater is increased\
    \ through the evaporation of black and \ngraywater in order to preserve water\
    \ resources.  Moreover, \nrecycled water obtained from rain can be innovatively\
    \ reused.  \nRecycling and dehumidifying strategies can be used for the city’s\
    \ \nwater supplies.  Similarly, aeroponic and hydroponic systems \ncan help raise\
    \ the efficiency of water consumption to 97% in \ncomparison to traditional agriculture[242].\
    \  Moreover, a constant \nflow of air is produced through air conditioning that\
    \ can be \nenhanced with carbon dioxide (CO2) so as to contribute to plant \n\
    growth even more.  Both environmental parameters and nutrient \nuptake may be\
    \ kept at certain levels that improve the speed of \nplant growth.  It was mentioned\
    \ that plants will have a better \nevapotranspiration and yield with the modification\
    \ of bandwidth \nof LED lighting.   \nUA, VF, RTG and plant factories provide\
    \ a unique opportunity \nfor reducing fossil fuels by utilizing solar panels,\
    \ roof-top wind \nturbines, or storage batteries[242,243] as shown schematically\
    \ in \nFigure 12.  The economic benefits of vertical farms include the \nreduction\
    \ of the cost of energy, lowering of food price, and an \neconomic opportunity\
    \ to secure land and return investments to the \ninvestor through protecting floods,\
    \ droughts, or damage caused by \nthe sun.  New job opportunities can be created\
    \ by VF in \nengineering, \nbiochemistry, \nbiotechnology, \nconstruction, \n\
    maintenance and research, with the chances to improve the \ntechnology.  Moreover,\
    \ the social benefits of VF are diverse and \ninvolve the psychological, and spiritual\
    \ health of the community, \nsuch as education, leisure, and more social communication\
    \ and \nhealthier food habits[213,242,244]. \n \nFigure 12  Conceptual design\
    \ for adaptation of renewable energy \nfor commercial development of sustainable\
    \ CEA and plant \nfactories \n \nSeveral researchers have claimed that, in a VF\
    \ system, the \nplants on the upper sections of the structure will only benefit\
    \ from \nsolar radiation, and that the energy supplied by the photovoltaics \n\
    solar panel may be restricted, or not justified cost wise[225].  \nHowever, solar\
    \ panels are now more efficient in generating energy, \nJanuary, 2018        \

    \ agriculture                Vol. 11 No.1   17 \nand the introduction of new affordable\
    \ and energy efficient LED \nlighting is an accepted substitute to compensate\
    \ the lack of natural \nlight.  We mentioned earlier that the LED sources are\
    \ capable of \nincreasing the yield in greenhouse context significantly because\
    \ of \nmatching spectral features with plant type and physiology[229,242].  \n\
    In addition, extra sun exposure is also possible through stacked \nlevels of plants\
    \ that can be rotated within one high-rise closed-space. \nThe extra cost of VF\
    \ start-ups can be resolved if the supporting \nstructures are not built on the\
    \ expensive central business districts, \nhowever there are still several challenges\
    \ with VF.  Indeed, the \nprimary costs of establishing, equipping and implementing\
    \ a VF \nare certainly high and are mostly accounted for energy \nconsumption.\
    \  The number and variety of crops grown is not as \nmany as in rural farming.\
    \  The quantity and loads of the crops are \nalso not as much as in the open-field\
    \ cultivation.  There are other \nchallenges too such as the need for disruption\
    \ management to the \nrural sector, to raise investment capital, and to train\
    \ workforce.  \nThese costs will be lowered through the time, particularly those\
    \ \nconcerning energy provision.  Abel[210] also mentioned that \nalthough establishing\
    \ VF is very costly at the beginning, but when \nit is well-established and fully\
    \ operated, the price of food will be \nlowered.  According to Despommier[14],\
    \ there are many \nappropriate locations for VF projects in every city and if\
    \ these \nlocations are used efficiently, they are able to return and circulate\
    \ \nlarge sums of money to the city[245].  It is concluded by Voss[246] \nthat\
    \ assessing all conditions on every level is essential, in order to \nthoroughly\
    \ consider all possibilities and then to decide on the \nestablishment of a VF.\
    \  Furthermore, VF as a concept is a \npromising move along the right path for\
    \ the fans of the \nrevolutionary resource-based economy movement.  Economic \n\
    analysis, along with the exploration of the impact of VF on \npost-industrial\
    \ cities can be topics of future studies. \n6  Conclusions \nUrbanization and\
    \ living in multi-story buildings request a \nredefinition of agricultural awareness\
    \ for securing food supply.  \nThe economic viability of traditional greenhouses\
    \ in this new \nscenario is likely to fade in the coming decades.  A trend in\
    \ the \npast 15 years of published literature showed that researchers and \ngreenhouse\
    \ growers have become more interested in shifting \ntowards smart controlled environment\
    \ agriculture.  The research \nconcentration has shifted from instrumentation\
    \ control and \nhardware-software interfacing to other scopes, such as simulating\
    \ \nthe interactions between microclimate parameters and plant growth.  \nResearchers\
    \ in this field are developing complex mathematical \nmodels to minimize energy\
    \ inputs, or are interested in finding \ninnovative solutions for replacing the\
    \ fossil energy consuming \ngreenhouses with energy neutral CEA systems that operate\
    \ on solar \nand wind power.  The main aspect that requires improvements in \n\
    this field is the task planning algorithms.  Path planning is well \nknown, but\
    \ to provide the CEA with an adaptive design and control \nstrategy that forms\
    \ the right shape and perform the right task at the \nright time, while increasing\
    \ profits and remaining competitive in \nthe market is still a challenge.  This\
    \ research presented an \noverview \nof \nmodern \ngreenhouses, \ncontrolled \n\
    environment \nagriculture and their derivatives, and highlighted some of the \n\
    advances in environmental monitoring, control, and optimization.  \nWhile biological\
    \ sensors, like those that measures plant stress are \nthe key to such high-level\
    \ of automation, this technology is either \nvery expensive for local growers\
    \ to afford, or even not available.  \nIn addition, it is not clearly well known\
    \ the cost of increased \nautomation relative to increase in profitability.  Therefore,\
    \ another \narea helping sustainability is knowledge based and decision making\
    \ \nsupport systems, i.e., model based computer applications that \naddress the\
    \ cost benefit for a proposed automation technology.  \nThis paper highlighted\
    \ some the most recent technological \nadvances for closed-field agriculture by\
    \ reviewing the applications \nof plant factories and rooftop greenhouses.  Some\
    \ of the \nconceptual designs in this context were introduces along with \nseveral\
    \ existing commercial examples to show the trends in \ndeveloping sustainable\
    \ farming system in the center of dense cities.  \nBased on the review literature,\
    \ this study concludes that a more \naccurate economic analysis and justifications\
    \ of the high startup \ncosts involved with vertical farming and plant factories\
    \ are required \nbefore large-scale commercial development.  The computer \nsimulation\
    \ models and adaptive analysis software are already \navailable for greenhouses\
    \ and CEA systems can be extended and \nmodified for this purpose.  The cost of\
    \ increased automation level \nrelative to increases in profitability is a key\
    \ consideration, and \nshould form part of future study to justify the implementation\
    \ of a \ngreater level of automation. \n \n[References] \n[1] \nTing K C, Lin\

    \ are helping to make water management smarter\nand optimizing consumption in\
    \ the smart agriculture industry. This article proposes a new topology\nof sensor\
    \ nodes based on the use of inexpensive and highly efﬁcient components, such as\
    \ water level,\nsoil moisture, temperature, humidity, and rain sensors. Additionally,\
    \ to guarantee good performance\nof the system, the used transmission module is\
    \ based on LoRa LPWAN technology. The design of the\nmain circuit board of the\
    \ system is optimized by combining two layers and implementing software\noptimization.\
    \ The overall sensor network is developed and tested in the research lab, and\
    \ real farms\ncan be controlled by users manually or automatically using the mobile\
    \ application. Experimental\nresults are produced by testing sensor and communication\
    \ link effectiveness, and are subsequently\nvalidated in the ﬁeld through a one-week\
    \ measurement campaign.\nKeywords: Internet of Things (IoT); water management;\
    \ smart agriculture; LoRa; LPWAN; sensor\n1. Introduction\nWireless sensor network\
    \ (WSN) technology, which is known as the center of the Internet of\nThings (IoT),\
    \ has continuously grown in recent years. An advantage of WSNs is their ability\
    \ to easily\ndeﬁne a network of devices that can be communicated with and gathered\
    \ from a monitored ﬁeld\nthrough communication links since the information is\
    \ sent through multiple nodes with a gateway and\nconnected to other networks\
    \ like wireless Ethernet. Many researchers have applied WSNs to different\nresearch\
    \ areas, such as environmental monitoring, forest ﬁre detection, smart cities,\
    \ smart education,\nhealthcare, agricultural control, water quality monitoring,\
    \ military uses, and asset management [1–9].\nAccordingly, WSNs are suitable for\
    \ multiple applications. The long range (LoRa) LPWAN is one\nnovel IoT communication\
    \ technology with an excellent capacity for development that is applied in\nmany\
    \ ﬁelds. The beneﬁts of this technology can be attributed to its capabilities\
    \ of ultra-long-distance\ncommunication, low power consumption, and ease of deployment,\
    \ among others.\nIn agriculture, environmental monitoring is required to control\
    \ speciﬁc plant conditions.\nBy collecting approximate values of available data\
    \ and making more accurate estimates, a WSN\ncan be used to achieve this task.\
    \ In addition, many agriculture researchers apply WSNs to monitor\nenvironmental\
    \ criteria [2–6]. In addition to standard environmental conditions such as temperature,\n\

    \ such as the ability to control the water level or temperature level are\nthe\
    \ subject of research in an agricultural environment [10].\nWater management and\
    \ optimal water supply have become popular topics in the ﬁeld of smart\nagriculture\
    \ and are being studied and developed by many researchers. Over the years, prominent\n\
    researchers in the ﬁeld of smart agriculture have written many survey articles\
    \ which introduce the\nresearch methodology for various communication technologies\
    \ that control resources efﬁciently based\non IoT technology [11–13]. We summarize\
    \ and compare our model with the existing literature in\nTable 1. In Vietnam,\
    \ agricultural production has transformed the country’s socioeconomic status\n\
    by alleviating national food insecurity, reducing poverty, fostering agrarian\
    \ exports, and providing\nlivelihoods to nearly half of the labor force nationwide.\
    \ These are just some examples, since WSN is\nactively applied to various functions\
    \ such as smart cities, waste management, and waste collection\nwith LoRaWan technology\
    \ [14–16].\nTable 1. A comparisons of our model with existing literature.\nModel\n\

    \ work on WSN in smart\nagriculture, clariﬁcations on issues of water management,\
    \ and essential tasks to be completed. Section 3\npresents details of the architecture\
    \ of the IoT proposed system. Section 4 presents the operational tests\ncomposed\
    \ of two different tasks, while Section 5 discusses the advantages and disadvantages\
    \ of our\npolicy. Finally, some concluding observations and a way forward are\
    \ offered in Section 6.\n2. Smart Agriculture and Related Works\nAs it possesses\
    \ the advantage of critical natural resources, Vietnam is an agricultural country\
    \ that\nis growing very quickly. Agriculture plays an essential role in the Vietnamese\
    \ economy and contributes\nto the country’s economic development currently and\
    \ in the future. Agriculture is one of the critical\nindustrial sectors of Vietnam,\
    \ and economic growth depends heavily on agriculture. The population of\nVietnam\
    \ will rise to reach 100 million people by 2020, while the demand for agricultural\
    \ products such\nas food crops (e.g., sweet potatoes, manioc, beans, and corn)\
    \ rice, coffee, pepper, cashew nut, rubber,\ntea, fruit, and vegetables continues\
    \ to increase dramatically. Combined with the effects of climate\nchange, these\
    \ demands place even more strain upon land, water, energy, and other resources\
    \ that are\nJ. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n3 of 22\nalready inﬂuenced. Several\
    \ smart solutions can be co-optimized and scaled up to improve yields and\nmeet\
    \ growing food production demands while transporting power and water resources\
    \ efﬁciently [17].\nMany articles depict the close relationship between smart\
    \ agriculture and IoT/WSN.\nResearchers focus on how this high-tech improvement\
    \ can be employed to develop effective smart\nsystems and data transmission [8,18].\n\
    The authors of [18] present a SmartFarmNet framework, based on the IoT platform\
    \ that can\nautomate the collection of environmental, fertilizer, soil, and irrigation\
    \ data; automatically correlate\nthat data and evaluate product performance; and\
    \ calculate product estimates and suggest speciﬁc\nproducts for any particular\
    \ farm. Importantly, IoT devices can be integrated into this platform as\nsensors,\
    \ cameras, and weather stations. Produced data can then be saved in the cloud\
    \ to enable\nperformance analysis and and recommendations.\nWith the help of IEEE\
    \ 802.15.4, which is a suite of high-level communication technology, artiﬁcial\n\
    intelligence, and decision support technology, the authors of [19] have developed\
    \ research on the\nagricultural application of IoT technology to monitor real-time\
    \ moisture and nutrients of citrus, along\nwith an analysis of the combination\
    \ of fertilizer support systems and irrigation. However, this research\nhas weaknesses,\
    \ which include system complexity and high costs. The authors of [20] also present\n\
    a narrow-band radio channel model whereby the communication link transfers under\
    \ near-ground\nrequirements for a smart agriculture platform.\nThe solution presented\
    \ in [21] was developed by implementing machine learning applications\non agriculture\
    \ datasets for smart farm improvement. By employing and comparing numerous\nmachine\
    \ learning methods to recommend the best solution, this system enabled the investigation\n\
    and deployment of useful jobs, varying from crop yield forecasting to missing\
    \ or incorrect sensor\ndata reconstruction. However, the only reasonable application\
    \ for this scenario is smart agriculture,\nsince three different resources are\
    \ available: the CRN scientiﬁc dataset, Istat statistical dataset, and the\nIoT\
    \ sensor manufacturing dataset.\nMany researchers and developers have chosen microcontroller\
    \ boards (e.g., Arduino boards) or\nRaspberry Pi for IoT applications. These allow\
    \ real-time monitoring, collection, data management,\nsecurity, and remote control\
    \ functions using the mobile app because of the suitable platforms available\n\
    for Internet-connected sensor buttons. This option is often challenging because\
    \ it entails a trade-off\nbetween cost, performance, and functionality for each\
    \ speciﬁc application project. Water management\ninvolves a valuable resource.\
    \ If an attacker controlled the system, entire crops could be destroyed\ndue to\
    \ altered irrigation levels. A denial of service (DoS) attack on sensors, irrigation\
    \ actuators,\nor distribution systems could affect system-wide operations. Changes\
    \ to sensor settings may also\nissue a warning that could cause networks or decision\
    \ producers to perform illegal actions and yield\nmonths of efforts and production\
    \ aims. If an attacker gains control of the actuators, irrigation and\nwater distribution\
    \ may be compromised and result in the incorrect irrigation of certain products.\n\
    Furthermore, eavesdropping may give criminals access to secret data about the\
    \ farm. They could\nremove productivity information and even manipulate the commodity\
    \ business, which represents an\neven more signiﬁcant threat. Self-governing vehicles,\
    \ drones, and engines utilized to collect images or\ncontrol manufacturing must\
    \ also be kept classiﬁed. An unauthorized node in the network can send\nincorrect\
    \ information about a crop. However, the authors only present the challenges to\
    \ security in\nsmart agriculture, and do not discuss how to overcome challenges\
    \ [22].\nA smart agriculture system was constructed to use low-power Bluetooth\
    \ and LPWAN\ncommunication technologies, including the wire-based communication\
    \ technology used in the existing\nfarm in [23]. This was combined with microcontrollers\
    \ such as an Arduino UNO board or Raspberry Pi\nboard. The administrator receives\
    \ data from sensor connections, and then stores the data, analyzes it,\nand provides\
    \ a user interface to monitor it. A related study [24] explains how an approach\
    \ to using IoT\nand cloud computing that incorporates development is helping to\
    \ quickly modernize agriculture and\nto realize smart solutions for agriculture.\
    \ Moreover, to solve problems regarding more practical issues\nJ. Sens. Actuator\
    \ Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n4 of 22\nrelated to farmers, sensors can be applied for use\
    \ in the IoT system. Furthermore, 2G and 3G wireless\nbroadband networks can be\
    \ used for communication between other components in the IoT system.\nSeveral\
    \ enabling technologies are adapted to present smart platform projects, which\
    \ are able\nto collect and manage data handling problems related to water management\
    \ in smart agriculture.\nFor example, the SWAMP project is a platform architecture\
    \ that includes a scenario-based development\nprocess for the obtained systems\
    \ in [25]. Moreover, the platform develops and assesses smart water\nmanagement\
    \ for precision irrigation in agriculture with a practical method based on four\
    \ pilots in\nBrazil, Italy, and Spain. The structure of SWAMP can be developed\
    \ for different solutions to deal\nwith the requirements of different contexts,\
    \ countries, climates, soils, and crops. Indeed, considerable\nﬂexibility is required\
    \ to adapt to a range of deployment conﬁgurations, including a diverse mix of\n\
    technologies. Unfortunately, for this platform, it is not possible to use without\
    \ the license and to do\nthis. The different IoT smart platforms presented in\
    \ [26] propose the use of cloud-based technology\nto manage the collection, analysis,\
    \ and forecast of agricultural environmental information in one\nuniversal system.\
    \ Besides the introduction of the platform, the author of the paper also presented\
    \ LoRa\ncommunication and applied it to the studied network, and although details\
    \ were not provided on the\nhardware used to do this. In summary, both studies\
    \ presented interesting suggestions and suitable\nplatforms for application to\
    \ smart agriculture.\nOther authors have focused on completing a systematic literature\
    \ review of IoT research and\ndeployments in protected agriculture over the past\
    \ ten years, in which they evaluate the contributions\nmade by various researchers\
    \ and organizations. Moreover, the structure of IoT is also detailed in\nprotected\
    \ agriculture, including the used platforms, modern wireless technologies, cloud\
    \ computing,\nmachine learning, big data, animal farming, hardware, software challenges,\
    \ and so on [27].\nAnother paper [28] proposes an IoT idea-based solution for\
    \ smart farming, where the authors\nproposed stack and discuss the current improvements.\n\
    They mainly focus on the IoT/M2M\ninteraction and explain the design and development\
    \ of a gateway that discusses the provided\nservices. Notably, in [29], the Web\
    \ of Things (WoT) was proposed as an idea to use environmental\nmonitoring and\
    \ enhance agricultural practices by supporting decision-making based on bio-data\n\
    collection. The paper brieﬂy presents the original design, which is a middleware\
    \ platform for IoT\nthat performs separation by understanding opportunistic networking\
    \ and computing operations.\nAccordingly, it is able to detect and control environmental\
    \ targets using web-based technologies.\nMeanwhile, the use of IoT for smart precision\
    \ agriculture for rural areas is proposed in [30]. In this\npaper, the authors\
    \ focus on a scalable network architecture for real-time monitoring of agriculture\
    \ in\nrural areas. A possible strategy is to optimize each element of the system\
    \ to reduce system latency\nup to a particular area. A solution [31] was proposed\
    \ by implementing a framework for managing,\ninvestigating, and sharing groundwater\
    \ data, with the use of sensors to gather data on groundwater\nlevels, pump sensors,\
    \ and weather conditions.\nIn [32], electromagnetic ﬁeld analysis is presented\
    \ as an enhanced monitoring approach for\nsubsurface radio wave propagation and\
    \ underground sensing applications in the ﬁeld of prediction\nagriculture. However,\
    \ this technology is challenging to implement in complex real environments,\n\
    which may delay system deployment. The prediction of the agriculture model presented\
    \ by [33]\noffers solution management capabilities by monitoring soil conditions\
    \ in real time using underground\nwireless sensors. Furthermore, the structure\
    \ used two types of communication links, above-ground\nand underground, for the\
    \ experiments. However, other challenges need to be solved, such as reducing\n\
    energy loss and promoting energy efﬁciency. These nodes should be able to adapt\
    \ to the soil moisture\nand temperature changes of the environment, among others.\n\
    More recently, the authors in [8] proposed an irrigation system that combines\
    \ IoT and data\nanalysis for the collection of environment data and control of\
    \ the farm via web and mobile applications.\nHowever, this article faced challenges\
    \ in controlling water in the farm. After analyzing state-of-the-art\nresearch\
    \ on water management and smart agriculture that applies IoT and related technology,\n\
    the following outcomes are drawn:\nJ. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n5 of 22\n\
    •\nMany popular systems and platforms can be used for water management in smart\
    \ agriculture,\nbut may be too expensive for the average farmer [28–31].\n•\n\
    The combination of multiple technologies in one system and the presence of limitations\
    \ leads to\ncomplexity when combining proprietary technologies. Moreover, many\
    \ factors affect the price\n(e.g., farm, hardware design, and guiding documentation),\
    \ although a basic package costs a\nminimum of $500 in [28–31].\n•\nAll IoT smart\
    \ agriculture solutions on the market are Most IoT smart agriculture products\
    \ are\npassive methods (i.e., manual). In some cases, they are connected to farm\
    \ monitoring devices to\nact smartly.\n•\nMany researchers have presented solutions\
    \ for smart agriculture systems. However, these\nmethods are restricted by the\
    \ design-embedded board and the inﬂexibility of devices, as it\nmay be necessary\
    \ to attach additional sensors or to control two or more farms with the same\n\
    mobile application.\nTherefore, we proposal a novel system to address the four\
    \ above points:\n1.\nThe standard IoT water management system is explained and\
    \ designed. It can connect to the\nInternet through LoRa communication both manually\
    \ and automatically with all hardware\ndesigns. The IoT box is designed to manage\
    \ the IoT devices and obtain data from the farms.\n2.\nA system is possible connected\
    \ the agriculture from farming based on rural areas efﬁciency\nto IoT system.\
    \ Additionally, the implemented system is a good alternative for analyzing the\n\
    communication between the gateway and nodes 1 and 2.\n3.\nOur smart watering system\
    \ receives real-time data input from sensors embedded in a farm tunnel\nand other\
    \ locations. The system then offers suggestions for watering schedules and capacity.\n\
    An advantage provided by the sensors, used for two farms, are the transmission\
    \ of an evaluation\nto the user’s mobile application, from where users can prepare\
    \ a watering plan for the farms.\n4.\nFinally, our smart watering system is scheduled\
    \ to a date and time which guarantees that the\nwater level falls below the threshold\
    \ in the tunnel farm. The system notiﬁes the user and switches\non the water pump\
    \ (manual or automatic) in time to water the plants.\n3. System Architecture\n\
    The aim of this paper is to provide a solution for the real-time monitoring of\
    \ water management\nthat optimizes power consumption.\nAn additional target is\
    \ a cost-saving in smart agriculture.\nThe critical element that affects energy\
    \ dissipation in the sensor nodes is the transmitting module.\nAs a design operation,\
    \ it focuses on the structure of the sensor node and the meaning of the network\n\
    sensor architecture. Finally, the determination of effective data transfer technology\
    \ is geared towards\nimplementing an energy-efﬁcient sensor node. The details\
    \ are discussed in Section 3.1.\nHowever, most of the smart agriculture ﬁeld if\
    \ the data are the crucial importance in the node,\nwhere the users could be easily\
    \ chosen by operating more comfortable components. Therefore,\nthe micro-controller\
    \ must be selected to guarantee a suitable trade-off between energy efﬁciency\n\
    and complexity. Finally, elements must be selected to consider the optimal agreement\
    \ between\nmeasured data accuracy, expected energy to carry out that task, and\
    \ price, thus prioritizing the use of\nsensors. As a result, the power of the\
    \ sensors becomes an important factor for energy consumption\nand longevity. The\
    \ proposed IoT node in our system is constructed following these requirements.\n\
    First, the choice made regarding essential elements is a single-chip micro-controller\
    \ such as an\nATmega328/P or ATmega2560. A reasonable choice is to provide simple\
    \ open-source software to allow\nthe user to observe and boost their conﬁdence\
    \ in the programming. Second, it uses a lower number\nof clock cycles to execute\
    \ instructions than others—all of the sensors and the developed single-board\n\
    microcontroller, where all of the devices are integrated. Third, after reviewing\
    \ the start-of-the-art of\nthe relevant technology, the best option is the LoRa\
    \ technology, as it provides IoT connectivity over\nlarge areas by enabling data\
    \ transmission across an extended range. It uses very little power, is robust\n\
    in a rural area, and uses an overall network architecture that was developed in\
    \ a smart agriculture\nJ. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n6 of 22\nsituation.\
    \ Finally, low-cost and low-power sensors were selected to provide an excellent\
    \ balance\nbetween measurement accuracy and energy efﬁciency.\nOur paper introduces\
    \ a reliable, robust, cost-effective, and scalable smart agriculture solution\n\
    based on IoT technology. The architecture system is presented in Figure 1, which\
    \ presents three\nnode prototypes: the gateway, node 1 and sensor node 1, and\
    \ node 2. The ﬂow diagram shown in\nFigure 2 demonstrates how to manage data transmission\
    \ between the gateway, node 1, and node 2 of\nour system.\n•\nThe gateway performs\
    \ the core functions of data collection from the nodes via LoRa, and then\nsends\
    \ data to the cloud, via the WiFi ESP82666 module, and to the mobile application.\
    \ Moreover,\nusers can also control the node throughout the gateway with the use\
    \ of the mobile app.\n•\nNode 1 and sensor node 1 are designed for this case,\
    \ as we assumed that the water pump machine\nis far from the sensor location.\n\
    •\nNode 2 was designed for orchard conditioners, with a topographic condition\
    \ suitable for installing\npumps directly in the farm without separating the sensor\
    \ block.\nFarm 1\nFarm 2\nGateWay\nNode 1\nSensor node 1\nNode 2\nFigure 1. Block\

    \ power system for the Gateway, Node 1 and 2 issue an AC supply of 220V. Nevertheless,\n\
    this power has to convert toward the expected form with normal voltage range for\
    \ storing power\nsupply to different kinds of devices in the IoT proposed node.\
    \ Based on the requirement of the\npower IoT system that the microcontroller and\
    \ the communication module need 5 V and 3.3 V for\nthe powering system with receive\
    \ node, respectively. It is necessary to include voltage regulators\ninside the\
    \ node. For that reason, two voltage regulators employ a 5 V regulator that powers\
    \ sensors of\nFigures 3–5 and a 3.3 V one which powers the powering system for\

    \ Electronic schematic and Gateway’s prototype, which includes\nthe sub-section\
    \ mentioned as below:\n3.2.1. Transmitter Module\nAs mentioned previously, the\
    \ transmitter module performs a vital concern in energy consumption\noptimization.\
    \ Hence, it has to be precisely selected and prospered. The IoT proposed node\
    \ is proposed\nto be used outside and spread over a rural area. Since radio communication\
    \ link solutions must be\nexplored, this needs to be taken into account. In fact,\
    \ it is unthinkable for something like this to have\na wirework connection (e.g.,\
    \ LAN) in large quantities at each node. An IoT application has many\ncommunication\
    \ networks where the sensor system is proposed. These systems are working based\
    \ on\nvarious radio technologies. Table 2 shows a measurement of the available\
    \ technologies, along with\ntheir essential features. The vital functions such\
    \ as area, consumption, and availability are accentuated\nin this table because\
    \ they are crucial parts for developing the device. After reviewing the technical\n\
    aspects as presented in this paper, the selection for data transmission technology\
    \ is an E32 LoRa series\nmodule [34]. The settings of this module work in the\

    \ on payload combined with chirp spread spectrum\ntechnology that effectively\
    \ gives processing gain. In addition, LoRa Technology can easily plug\ninto existing\
    \ infrastructure and enables low-cost battery-operated IoT applications.\nAfter\
    \ reviewing these simple highlights, it can deﬁne the beneﬁts and drawbacks of\
    \ the leading\nfour communication networks released for the previously outlined:\n\

    \ 7. Prototype of the gateway and Node 1.\n•\nLocal Area Networks (LAN): The ad\
    \ hoc’s area coverage is signiﬁcantly more than other carrier\nnetwork technologies.\
    \ However, it still has some disadvantages. Applying the radio technology\nnetwork\
    \ for our system: for instance, WiFi or BLE technology set up, requires a signiﬁcant\
    \ number\nof nodes for the system. It will noticeably change the overall cost\
    \ of the deployed infrastructure.\nA different choice might be to implement a\
    \ ZigBee network or BLE technology. Because the system\nis not energy efﬁcient,\
    \ and admits a signiﬁcant decrease in the power consumption of the\nend device\
    \ nodes, this means that, although their current absorption levels are relatively\
    \ low\n(40 mA [35]), their life expectancy provided by batteries is in some order.\n\
    •\nLow Power Consumption (LPWAN): The authors in [36] proposed characterizing\
    \ great Area\nNetworks LPWAN solutions as their more extensive transmission range\
    \ allows for the\nestablishment of a star or multi-star network with some APs.\
    \ Allowing the sensor node to\nuse the chief duty-cycling policies allows for\
    \ turning off buttons for long periods. Finally, the\nprice of this technology\
    \ is meager when agreeing to use them in large quantities at no extra charge\n\
    as in the situation of ISP co-operation.\n•\nGlobal Area Networks (GAN): The global\
    \ network is the most simple solution to deploy because\nit does not need access\
    \ points or speciﬁc infrastructure implementations. Unfortunately, it has\nmany\
    \ other essential features, the ﬁrst being the price: 3G technologies; still,\
    \ the lowest of different\ntechniques is always more expensive than other solutions.\
    \ Furthermore, SIM is used, so\nthey need subscription payments when preparing\
    \ to deploy many of nodes and become\ninsigniﬁcant. Additionally, the energy consumption\
    \ needs to take into consideration that the\naverage modern consumption of the\
    \ third-generation mobile cellular system is many times higher\nthan that of the\
    \ IEEE 802.15.4 [37]. Alternatively, a low-power wide-area network module [38]\n\
    may be considered; however, obtaining it is unsuitable for applications with low\
    \ energy use.\nFinally, in the rural areas, some ISP cannot support the Internet\
    \ service for the users.\n•\nNarrowband-Internet of Things:\nNB-IoT is the novel\
    \ technology with a short form of\nNarrowband-Internet of Things and speciﬁed\
    \ in LTE Release-13 [39]. It is developed to meet\nthe requirements of LPWA (Low-Power\
    \ Wide-Area) networks. NB-IoT has a wide variety of\napplications for many ﬁelds\
    \ such as personal, technology and industrial. The applications are\nwearables,\
    \ smart bicycles, event detectors, smart garbage bins, smart metering, smart agriculture,\n\
    and logistics tracking. Mainly, low power and long-range are the absolute essentials\
    \ for IoT\n(Internet of Things), which is a signiﬁcant concern with mainstream\
    \ cellular technologies.\nThe other advantages of the NB-IoT are scalability,\
    \ quality of service and safety related to\nJ. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n\
    11 of 22\nunlicensed LPWA networks and design, including the secure connections\

    UART\n3.2.2. ATmega2560 Microcontroller\nIn this research, the nodes communicate\
    \ with each other via the UART interface. At the gateway,\nit is necessary to\
    \ use two UARTs (the ﬁrst one communicates with the ESP8266 module, and the other\n\
    one is used to communicate with two nodes. In Node 1, it is also necessary for\
    \ two UART interfaces to\ncollect data from the nodes and the gateway, since the\
    \ ATmega2560 is a reasonable choice [40].\n3.2.3. WiFi ESP8266 Module\nThe WiFi\
    \ ESP8266 module from [41–43] is the best choice because the ESP8266 is very ﬂexible\
    \ in\ndata transfer between devices and mobile applications, easy to integrate\
    \ into advanced projects, and\nadaptable within the Arduino embedded development\
    \ environment.\n3.3. Node 1 and Sensor Node 1\nThe same as in gateway, in this\
    \ node, an AC supply has to be converted towards the demanded\nform with the required\
    \ voltage range for storing power supply to various types of devices. We are\n\
    suggesting that the micro-controller and the transmission module need 5 V for\
    \ the powering system\nwith a receive node each, and it is necessary to incorporate\
    \ voltage regulators inside the node. Therefore,\ntwo voltage regulators use 5\
    \ V and 3.3 V regulators, which power the sensors in Figure 4 and the\npowering\
    \ system for the receiver node.\nFigure 4 shows the block diagram of Node 1, which\
    \ designs the case. It assumes that the water\npump is placed far away from the\
    \ sensor location since there is a sensor node to collect the data for\nNode 1.\
    \ Node 1 receives the data from sensor Node 1. Based on the sensor values, we\
    \ can deﬁne the\nvalue from the application and the sensors located at Node 1.\
    \ Moreover, in this node, there are two\nprimary sensors, which are the pump temperature\
    \ sensor and water level sensor. LoRa module on\nNode 1 communicates to the Gateway.\
    \ We also use RF HC12, a short-range wireless data transmission\nmodule whose\
    \ primary function is to receive data from sensor Node 1 transmitted to Node 1.\
    \ RFID\nperforms the central feature of controlling the pump directly at Node\
    \ 1 to increase the security of the\nsystem, and LCD is designed to display the\
    \ data of Node 1. Sensor Node 1 in Figure 5 shows the\nﬂowchart of details as\
    \ the node power is an external AC–DC converter with 7 V that gives sufﬁcient\n\
    current to power all the components.\nSection 3.3.1 illustrates the details of\
    \ the ATmega328 microcontroller and the sensors connected in\nFigure 8 for Node\

    \ involvement of a micro-controller system to perform:\nthis component must be\
    \ implemented to trade off the price, power consumption, and performance\nenergy\
    \ results. According to most elements of low power, modern micro-controllers use\
    \ for a several\nmA, the effects of this element for the typical power consumption\
    \ of the node can be negligible,\nthus providing a higher level of independence\
    \ [43].\nBased on the principle diagram of Gateway and Node 1, it seems that both\
    \ have many common\npoints, which can be seen in Figures 3 and 4. The best selection\
    \ in this study for the integrated design\nfor both Gateway and Node 1 is signiﬁcant.\
    \ Because they save on the costs of printed circuitry, achieve\nfaster circuit\
    \ machining, and quickly ﬁx hardware errors. Figure 6 shows the schematic of an\
    \ actuator\nGateway and Node 1, which contains: an AC–DC converter, ATmega2560,\
    \ LoRa transmission, RFID,\nLCD, and all the sensors. Note that, for the sake\
    \ of simplicity, we proposed all of the integrated circuits\ndepicted in the schematic.\
    \ After that, the printed circuit boards Gateway and Node 1 are designed\nwith\
    \ two layers of wires to make wiring more convenient and help optimize the circuit\
    \ as much as\npossible. The components are arranged in blocks with separate functions,\
    \ making it easier and more\nconvenient to check for errors.\nThe printed circuit\
    \ of Gateway and Node 1 is designed with:\n•\n62 components in which there are\
    \ 59 glued components and three pin components.\nJ. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019,\
    \ 8, 45\n13 of 22\n•\nThe total number of different lines is 49 lines.\n•\nThere\
    \ are three different line sizes of 80 mils, 25, and 10 mils following different\
    \ wiring\nrequirements.\n•\nLine rules: do not cut wires, report faulty components\
    \ and the minimum distance between wires\nis 10 mm.\n•\nSize: 74.193 × 87.503\
    \ mm.\nFigure 7b shows the overall prototype of Node 1. Node 1 powers with a 5V\
    \ AC–DC converter that\nstores full current energy to control all the components\
    \ and the relay module. Furthermore, the LoRa\nmodule is not put close to the\
    \ converter because it generated the electrical noise and the interference of\n\
    communication links.\nWith the various parameters to be observed in our system,\
    \ in most cases, temperature,\ntemperature–humidity, soil moisture, rain, and\
    \ water level are measured.\n•\nTemperature sensor: DS18B20, [44], the popular\
    \ solution for temperature control in smart\nagriculture systems is the application\
    \ of standard digital sensors, for instance, DS18B20 integrated\ncircuits in this\
    \ research.\n•\nTemperature-humidity sensor: DHT22 [45] is a current sensor, which\
    \ combines the temperature\nand humidity sensor; it provides a wider temperature\
    \ range and better accuracy. In particular,\nit has low consumption and is better\
    \ for most smart farming systems.\n•\nSoil moisture sensor: SKU:SEN0193 [46],\
    \ this soil moisture sensor measures soil moisture levels\nby capacitive sensing\
    \ rather than resistive sensing like other sensors on the market. It is made of\n\
    corrosion-resistant material, which provides a good solution for the user. Moreover,\
    \ the sensor is\nsimple to use—an analog sensor that works at a low voltage.\n\
    •\nRain sensor: LM393, this is an analog sensor that operates at a low voltage,\
    \ and the current sensor\nis for easily detecting rain [47].\n•\nWater level and\
    \ temperature pump: LM393 [48]; this is an analog sensor when the water level\n\
    reaches below the threshold in the tunnel farm and checks the sensors. Our system\
    \ communicates\nto the user and establishes a water pump to its switch on the\
    \ state for sufﬁcient watering of plants\nthroughout a mobile application.\nFigure\
    \ 9 shows the sensor Node 1 electronic schematic, and how total hardware elements\
    \ are\nattached: microcontroller, power, and IC circuit. DS 1307 is used to read\
    \ the real-time with the high\naccuracy, LoRa module transfer data via a serial\
    \ connection, and the module connection is used to\nconnect RF HC12, RFID RC522,\
    \ LCD, sensors, pump, and ATmega2560. Figure 10a shows an actual\nmodel of sensor\
    \ Node 1.\nBesides the hardware, before being discussed, sensor Node 1 needs an\
    \ additional device to\noperate. The general important thing is the power subsystem.\
    \ In the case of the nodes, it was selected\nto power the nodes. Note that, in\
    \ this situation, we also can be used by the power supply unit, which\nis based\
    \ on a 12 W solar panel. The solar panel is linked to the solar charge controller,\
    \ where a solar\ncharge controller manages the power going into the battery.\n\

    \ Tests\nThe proposed smart agriculture system is evaluated using two different\
    \ scenarios in Vietnam:\ndemonstrating the effectiveness of the sensors for the\
    \ analysis of temperature, solid humidity in\na research lab; and conﬁrming data\
    \ transmission by using the LoRa channel over a large area\nand distance.\n4.1.\
    \ Tests on the Sensors of the IoT\nThe ﬁrst scenario was set up in the Department\
    \ of Electronics and Telecommunications\nEngineering of Ton Duc Thang University,\
    \ Vietnam, where the sensing infrastructure was evaluated.\nThe performance of\
    \ the system was tested using a subset of nodes with the Arduino. These sensors\n\
    were used because the presence of other components would not affect the accuracy\
    \ of the measurement.\nIn addition, since the circuit board was furnished with\
    \ the equivalent microcontroller used in the node,\nthis circuit board was chosen\
    \ for speciﬁc tests due to its ease of use, as fast prototyping is required\n\
    and because it can exploit the equivalent microprogramming of an IoT button. Experiments\
    \ were\nperformed using the gate, button 1, and sensor button 1 and button 2 with\
    \ LoRa integrated with\nembedded sensors. An easy-to-read LCD screen was added\
    \ to the mainboard, where it displayed\nthe temperature and humidity measured\
    \ by the sensor as shown in Figures 11 and 12. Furthermore,\nthe accuracy of sensor\
    \ measurements was displayed and conﬁrmed on the LCD screen. Finally,\nsensors\
    \ were calibrated before the test to guarantee the accuracy of data, and to help\
    \ users to eliminate\ndifﬁculties during the setup process the system.\nJ. Sens.\

    In the second scenario, the effectiveness of the LoRa technology for the placement\
    \ of a farm\nmonitoring infrastructure was investigated by examining data transmission\
    \ distances in two real\nfarms as shown in Figure 13. For this purpose, a model\
    \ system infrastructure was set up in the Cho\nLach district, Ben Tre province,\
    \ Vietnam, to demonstrate the usability of an individual star topology\nnetwork\
    \ covering an entirely rural area. The model infrastructure was composed using\
    \ a gateway node\nproduced by a LoRa E32-TTL-1W module connected to a mobile application,\
    \ and by two sensor nodes.\nThe transmission modules were set up with three critical\
    \ measures: the symbol rate of information,\nthe bandwidth of the channel, and\
    \ the information rate were set according to the datasheet provided\nby the manufacturer\
    \ in order to obtain the highest sensitivity.\nBased on the sensor network structure\
    \ presented in the previous sections, the transmission\nranges were checked by\
    \ placing the gateway in the farm. The nodes were located in various areas:\n\
    node 1 covered 2000 m2 at a distance of 700 m from the gateway, while node 2 covered\
    \ 1000 m2 at a\ndistance of 500 m from the gateway. These positions were ﬁxed\
    \ and it was veriﬁed that the actual\ndata was correctly received. Subsequently,\
    \ data were collected from nodes 1 and 2 and sent to the\ngateway during the following\
    \ seven days of the same month, during which 24-h measurements were\nmade. In\
    \ this way, the performance of the system was tested. Figures 14 and 15 show the\
    \ results\nof the two nodes, which present the soil moisture, humidity, and temperature.\
    \ It can be observed\nthat, based on the threshold of these values, the system\
    \ could automatically switch on the water for\nthe farm. The experimental results\
    \ indicate that the application of a quick procedure for effective\nJ. Sens. Actuator\

    \ the outcomes of a sensor-based system. Not only does a\nsmart strategy improve\
    \ the performance of IoT-based and sensor-based systems, but the efﬁciency of\n\
    these systems can be increased with the smarter and more accurate choices made\
    \ by such intelligent\nsystems. Our experimental results highlight the procedure\
    \ used by the smart irrigation system to\nsave water in tunnel farming, thus achieving\
    \ higher productivity and the ability to ﬂexibly manage\nthe farm.\nFigure 13.\

    \ nodes during transmission. Although packet loss was observed whenever the\n\
    model moved between a test place, this is not a problem because the nodes are\
    \ expected to remain\nat the growing farms in the studied area. Therefore, LoRa\
    \ technology is proven to be effective when\ndeployed in rural areas, without\
    \ having to turn on acceleration mode on the transfer module shown\nin Figure\

    The smart agriculture system based on an IoT application has the following advantages\
    \ compared\nto the previous approaches:\n•\nThe system can be used to manage two\
    \ or more independent farms on the same mobile application,\nwhich may have different\
    \ growth schedules. The aim of this research was to use devices of the\nIoT system\
    \ with lower prices that are easy to obtain.\n•\nRemoving the need for WiFi on\
    \ the farm with the application of LoRa technology helps to save\nenergy, lower\
    \ costs, improve efﬁciency, and facilitate excellent communication between the\
    \ farm\nand gateway.\n•\nControl data are saved to the system memory to prevent\
    \ power outages that result in data loss.\nFurthermore, the multitude of control\
    \ modes makes it easier for users to manipulate the farm.\n•\nReal-time updates\
    \ are available directly from the Internet in order to enable the system to run\n\
    more accurately.\n•\nA lost WiFi connection can be detected and communicated to\
    \ users for timely processing.\n•\nMany different sensors are integrated to collect\
    \ information related to tree care in order to improve\ncrop productivity. Our\
    \ strategy studies ﬁve parameters: temperature, temperature–humidity,\nsoil moisture,\
    \ rain, and water level.\n•\nNone of the previously mentioned approaches discuss\
    \ and investigate the effect of energy\nconsumption in smart irrigation systems.\
    \ Furthermore, other methods frequently rely on soil\nmoisture to determine the\
    \ water needs of plants.\n•\nThe results of the test and the measurement of our\
    \ smart watering system approach the standard\nwatering procedure as a product\
    \ of high-tech application. It has an economic efﬁciency that is at\nleast 30%\
    \ higher than the used technology.\nIn addition to the advantages presented above,\
    \ our research also has disadvantages, which need\nto be overcome before widespread\
    \ application. For instance, the ESP8266 module is a mid-range\nmodule without\
    \ a high stability, while the system can lose an Internet connection and depends\
    \ on the\nBlynk application.\n6. Conclusions\nThis paper presents a solution using\
    \ LoRa module transmission for a low-cost and effective smart\nagriculture system\
    \ for use in Vietnam, which is designed and implemented to control environmental\n\
    J. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n19 of 22\nfactors in agriculture. It is less\
    \ expensive than other solutions with a similar accuracy. The system can\ncontinuously\
    \ observe the measured values and communicate them to users via a network and\
    \ mobile\napplication. Furthermore, the system can send alarms to users and activate\
    \ reduction devices. The IoT\nnode was tested in two separate cases in Cho Lach\
    \ district, Ben Tre province, Vietnam, and was used\nto measure distinct values\
    \ such as moisture, humidity, and temperature. Finally, experiments were\nperformed\
    \ to determine if the embedded electronics and the wireless communication module\
    \ might\ninﬂuence the collected values; there were no signs of interference. In\
    \ summary, the results conﬁrm\nthat the system provides the optimal solution to\
    \ users of smart agricultural control for farmers in\nVietnam. The availability\
    \ of real-time data enables quick use and management at all times from all\nplaces.\
    \ However, when IoT nodes are placed in various places, they generate huge quantities\
    \ of data.\nIn this case, our system requires time to store and analyze data before\
    \ ﬁnding the best solution.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, T.-Y.N.,\

    Metrics Abstract: As more and more applications are deployed using the Internet
    of Things (IoT) technologies, the fragmentation of general purpose IoT technologies
    to target particular sectors with different requirements is becoming necessary.
    In this paper, we summarize the latest developments of application-specific IoTs
    (ASIoTs) (a term to conceptualize the development of IoTs targeted toward specific
    domains, communications mediums, and industry sectors) in eight representative
    studies (Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT), Internet of Medical Things (IoMT),
    Internet of Animal Things (IoAT), Internet of Waste Things (IoWT), Internet of
    Underwater Things (IoUWT), Internet of Underground Things (IoUGT), Internet of
    Nano Things (IoNT), and Internet of Mobile Things (IoMobT) such as the Internet
    of Vehicles). The paper gives contributions to ASIoTs from three perspectives:
    First, we offer a basic classification taxonomy for ASIoTs and discuss various
    representative studies and applications which can be found in the literature;
    Second, we discuss a use case for a biometrics-based ASIoT (termed IoBioT) for
    illustration and experiments of face-based biometric recognition on IoBioT are
    also performed; and Third, we give discussions and future directions for ASIoTs.
    An objective of this paper is to spur researchers and facilitate the development
    of ASIoTs for the different user-defined domains, communication mediums, and technology
    constrained platforms. Application Specific Internet of Things (ASIoT) for Biometrics.

    IEEE SECTION I. Introduction Internet-of-Things (IoT) which combines advancements
    in sensing, mobile computing and cloud server technologies and platforms have
    in recent years become highly important and ubiquitous in the modern world [1],
    [2]. As more and more applications are deployed using IoT technologies, the fragmentation
    of general purpose IoT technologies to target particular sectors with different
    requirements is becoming necessary. For example, a customized IoT for environmental
    water monitoring would have different requirements from a customized IoT for medical
    patient monitoring. The latter IoT application would require much higher and stringent
    requirements for real-time data transfer and security. This leads to the emergence
    and development of IoTs to realize specific requirements for various domains,
    communications mediums and industry sectors which for convenience we term as application
    specific IoTs (ASIoTs). On observation, the development of ASIoTs is mirroring
    the development of application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) in digital
    electronics technology with the realization that different application domains
    (e.g. high speed logic processing, implementation on low power devices) required
    different design parameters to be optimized. In the case of ASICs, some requirements
    and parameters to be customized include clock speed, chip area, power consumption,
    etc [3]. For ASIoTs, some parameters and requirements to be customized include
    the end-to-end delay or network data latency, robustness of the network towards
    node failures, node power consumption, security aspects, etc. Although ASIoTs
    are an emerging research area, some examples of IoTs for customized and specific
    applications can be found in the literature. The authors in [4] proposed the medical
    Internet of Things which they termed mIoT. Further examples of ASIoTs are the
    Internet of Underwater Things (IoUWT) [5] as a network of smart interconnected
    underwater objects, the Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT) [6] worn by military
    personnel and embedded within military equipment, the Internet of Nano Things
    [7] and the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) [8], [22] which utilizes vehicles on highways
    as mobile nodes and roadside sensing and computational infrastructure for intelligent
    transportation and safety applications. The design of the different ASIoTs will
    prioritize meeting different design factors. Some design factors will remain common
    towards most ASIoTs whereas others may only apply towards ASIoTs in particular
    domains. A common requirement for many ASIoTs is the requirement for low power
    and low complexity implementation in battery-powered sensor nodes or devices.
    Many IoT devices cannot afford resource demanding algorithms (e.g. cryptographic
    & video [9] protocols) to be implemented within the hardware constrained devices.
    For example, a medical sensor device to be authenticated with fingerprint recognition
    technology would need the biometric traits to be encrypted before transmission
    to the cloud server. This encryption would need to be performed on the device
    itself which would have severe constraints on computational power, memory storage
    and power consumption while still ensuring the requirements are met for secure
    communications. However, this requirement for low power consumption is not required
    in IoV applications as the chemical or electric batteries in vehicles can provide
    ample power for sensing, communications and information processing. In the case
    for IoV networks, the requirement is geared towards very low network latency and
    fast response time to meet the safety requirements for intelligent transportation.
    Here, we see a contrast between the design factors and tradeoffs (e.g. power consumption
    vs network response time) for different ASIoTs. This paper aims to spur researchers
    and facilitate the development of ASIoTs for different user-defined domains, communication
    mediums and technology constrained platforms. It gives contributions for ASIoTs
    from three perspective. First, a basic classification taxonomy for ASIoTs is presented.
    This is followed by the discussion on various representative studies and applications
    which can be found in the literature. Second, we present a use case for a biometrics-based
    ASIoT (termed IoBioT) for illustration. A case study of face-based biometric recognition
    and experiments is included to confirm our approach in the Big biometrics data
    computation layer of IoBioT. Third, the discussions and future directions for
    ASIoTs are presented. The paper is organized as follows: Section II discusses
    a basic classification taxonomy and several representative studies and applications
    for ASIoTs which can be found in the literature. A focus here is to identify some
    important design parameters and challenges to be addressed in these ASIoTs. A
    use case study for a biometric-based ASIoT (IoBioT) is discussed in Section III
    to illustrate some design parameters and customizations for security, key management
    and Big data information processing. Experiments are also included. Section IV
    gives future directions and discussions to spur researchers and facilitate the
    development of ASIoTs for different user domains, communication mediums and technology
    constrained platforms. Section IV concludes the paper. SECTION II. Studies in
    ASIoT Research This section surveys advancements made in the developments and
    applications of ASIoTs in eight representative studies (Internet of Battlefield
    Things, Internet of Medical Things, Internet of Animal Things, Internet of Waste
    Things, Internet of Underwater Things, Internet of Underground Things, Internet
    of Nano Things, and Internet of Mobile Things). An important focus is the identification
    of the various design factors and challenges to be prioritized for the different
    ASIoTs. We also offer a basic taxonomy and classification of ASIoTs into three
    categories: (1) User domain-driven; (2) Communications medium-driven; and (3)
    Technology constraint-driven. The design parameters for user domain-driven ASIoTs
    are optimized for parameters defined by the specific user domain. Examples of
    user domain-driven ASIoTs would be the Internet of Battlefield Things, Internet
    of Medical Things, Internet of Animal Things and Internet of Waste Things. The
    design of communications medium-driven ASIoTs are dominated by the network communications
    in the medium (e.g. terrestrial, underwater, underground mediums) with different
    properties and characteristics. Examples of these classes of ASIoTs are the Internet
    of Underwater Things and the Internet of Underground Things. The third classification
    for ASIoTs are the technology constraint-driven ASIoTs. An example of this class
    is the Internet of Nano Things where the constraints of the nanotechnology implementation
    drives the design factors for the ASIoT. Table 1 shows a summary of the different
    types of ASIoTs and its taxonomy classification, the smart things or objects in
    the ASIoT, the challenges and the design parameters to be prioritized and optimized,
    and some representative works discussed in this section. The lessons learnt from
    the case studies and the important factors and future directions for designing
    and building ASIoTs are discussed in Section IV. TABLE 1 Summary of ASIoTs Characteristics
    and its Taxonomy Classification A. Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT) The Internet
    of Battle Things or also known as the Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT) [6],
    [10], [11], [12] is an illustrative example of an ASIoT which has been designed
    for military and defense applications. The design of the IoBT would be strongly
    influenced by two technologies (machine intelligence and networked communications).
    The “smart things” in the IoBT would include sensors, munitions, weapons, vehicles,
    robots, and human-wearable devices which are capable of collecting and processing
    information, acting as agents to support decision making and situational awareness,
    undertaking coordinated defensive actions, and unleashing a variety of effects
    on the adversary [6]. The IoBT can be seen as a user defined-domain ASIoT with
    extremely stringent requirements for fast and adaptively robust network communications,
    rapid real-time information processing to deal with a large volume and complexity
    of information for human decision-making and requiring very high security. As
    remarked by the authors in [6], the IoBT will itself become a battleground, as
    the adversary will attempt to take control and subvert the IoBT for its own ends.
    The authors identified three security challenges for the IoBT to be addressed:
    (1) Physical survival and functioning of IoBT from kinetic, directed-energy and
    electronic attacks against its things, jamming the RF channels, destroying fiber
    channels and by depriving IoBT of its power sources; (2) Threats to the confidentiality,
    integrity, availability of the information within IoBT, by electronic eavesdropping,
    and by deploying malware into IoBT; and (3) Human deceptions and loss of confidence
    that the information in the IoBT is trustworthy or that some elements of IoBT
    are being controlled by the adversary. Other authors have proposed various improvements
    to address the challenges faced by the IoBT. A significant challenge for the IoBT
    compared with other IoTs is the need for information dissemination in the presence
    of adversaries. The authors in [10] studied the problem of network connectivity
    for the IoBT in which an attacker aims at disrupting the connectivity of the network
    by choosing to compromise one of the IoBT nodes at each time epoch. The authors
    formulate the scenario as a dynamic multistage Stackelberg connectivity game that
    explicitly takes into account the characteristics and requirements of the IoBT
    network such as the IoBT latency and the sum of weights of disconnected nodes
    at each stage of the game. Their results showed that the expected number of disconnected
    sensors using the feedback Stackelberg equilibrium (FSE) decreased up to 46% compared
    to a baseline equal probability policy. Another approach for secure information
    dissemination in the presence of adversaries was proposed by [11]. In this work,
    the authors used stochastic geometry (SG) based models to characterize the connectivity
    of IoBT networks in terms of the degree distribution and employed epidemic spreading
    models to model data dissemination among different types of battlefield devices
    according to the assigned missions. Their results showed that the objectives of
    the battlefield mission could be achieved by either changing the deployment of
    the combat units or by changing their transmission power. The authors in [12]
    investigated the problem of detecting malware in the IoBT. Their approach employed
    eigenspace learning and deep learning methods to detect IoBT malware using the
    operational code sequences (OpCode) of the devices. The authors showed that their
    approach achieved an accuracy rate of 98.37%, a precision rate of 98.59% and also
    had the capability to mitigate against junk code insertion attacks. B. Internet
    of Medical Things (IoMT) The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is another example
    of a customized user domain-driven ASIoT for healthcare and patient monitoring
    with its own specific requirements and challenges. Examples of “smart things”
    in the IoMT would include sensor wearables (e.g. for Parkinson’s disease, multiple
    sclerosis), sensors and devices for diabetes, heart rate and electrocardiogram
    (ECG), and smart things for insulin and inhalers. The authors in [4] identified
    the requirement of interoperability as a major challenge for the IoMT. This important
    issue deals with the need for proprietary protocols from medical sensors/devices
    and smart things from one manufacturer to be able to communicate with devices
    and servers from other manufacturers in order that the collected data can be utilized
    fully for the diagnosis and health applications and not marooned on separate data
    islands. Other challenges identified by the authors for the IoMT include: (1)
    Simple connectivity for the smart things and devices to connect to and access
    the cloud-based services; (2) Easy device management for improved device availability
    and reduced maintenance; and (3) Informative analytics to gain insight from huge
    volumes of medical and healthcare data for better decision-making. Although the
    security requirements for the IoMT may not be as stringent as for the IoBT, the
    security and privacy of the patients’ records also require protection from unauthorized
    access. The privacy of patients’ can be breached if the personal and medical information
    are posted in the public domain or otherwise used without their consent. Similarly,
    attacks can be made to interfere with the proper functioning of essential medical
    devices such as pacemakers. The authors in [13] proposed authentication mechanisms
    for ECG monitoring signals from IoT devices using watermarking techniques. In
    their approach, a watermark is introduced into the ECG signal on the client side
    which is then authenticated on the cloud server. Their watermarking approach is
    based on dividing the ECG signal into a number of beats and applying the discrete
    wavelet transform singular value decomposition (DWT-SVD) on each beat. On the
    cloud side, seven features (heartbeat rate, P wave duration, PR interval, QRS
    complex, QT interval, shape and T wave) are extracted from the ECG signal and
    the classification is performed using a one-class support vector machine (OCSVM).
    The authors in [14] proposed the Wearable IoT (WIoT) for person-centered healthcare.
    The architectural composition of the WIoT includes three elements: (1) Wearable
    body area sensors (WBAS); (2) Internet-connected gateways; and (3) Cloud and Big
    data support. The WBAS serves as the frontend for the WIoT ecosystem and performs
    two functions: (1) Data collection from the body through contact sensors or peripheral
    sensors; and (2) Data preparation for on-board device analysis or remote transmission
    for comprehensive analysis and decision support. The Internet-connected gateways
    serves to exchange data with the wearable sensor devices via short range communication
    technology (e.g Bluetooth) and transmit the data to the cloud via heterogeneous
    networks communication technology (e.g. WiFi and GSM). The Cloud and Big data
    support provides the computing infrastructure for large-scale and advanced functionalities
    for medical data analytics, machine learning and data mining. C. Internet of Animal
    Things (IoAT) The Internet of Animal Things (IoAT) [15] is as an example of an
    ASIoT where the smart objects and devices are used to monitor living creatures
    (e.g. livestock such as dairy cows, sheep, cattle) within the IoT. The IoAT would
    have significant advantages for monitoring the health of livestock for smart farming
    applications. Examples of smart things in the IoAT would include smart cattle
    collars to monitor rumination, temperature and activity movements, RFID ear tags
    and sound analyzers for early detection of respiratory diseases [16]. A recent
    work by the authors in [26] proposed a method to detect and classify the screams
    of pigs for indications of stressful situations. Their approach used classification
    of sound spectrograms and achieved results of 71.83% sensitivity, 91.43% specificity
    and 83.61% precision. Some challenges for the IoAT include energy efficiency for
    the on-animal measuring devices. The authors in [15] proposed the use of sub-GHz
    long range (LoRA) for use in animal monitoring and characterized the off-body
    wireless channel in indoor (barn) environments at 868 MHz using LoRa nodes. D.
    Internet of Waste Things (IoWasteT) The Internet of Waste Things (or also known
    as the Internet of Bins [17]) is a very useful application for deployment in smart
    cities [18], [20]. The smart things and objects in the IoWasteT include smart
    garbage bins (SGBs) [19], RFID tags, sensors, cameras and actuators. The IoT-based
    smart garbage system (SGS) proposed in [19] was operated as a pilot project in
    Seoul for a one-year period. The battery-based SGBs communicated information with
    each other using wireless mesh networks and a router and server collected and
    analyzed the information for service provisioning. A header SGB (HSGB) located
    within each region was used to analyze and manage the other SGBs within its region
    after collecting their information. Their approach included a cooperation-based
    operation to increase the battery lifetime in the IoT for energy-efficient operations
    of the SGBs where the HSGB was adaptively selected according to the battery and
    memory status of each SGB in the region. An important challenge for the IoWasteT
    is the large scale data collection and delivery to thousands of sensors and actuators
    integrated within the smart objects. A potential solution is to use the Internet
    of Vehicles (IoV) to serve as data MULES (Mobile Ubiquitous LAN Extensions) [21]
    in smart city environments as a cost effective approach for the large scale data
    collection, transportation and information processing from smart objects within
    the smart city environment [22]. E. Internet of Underwater Things (IoUWT) The
    Internet of Underwater Things (IoUWT) is an example of a communications medium
    driven ASIoT targeted for application in oceans and other water-based domains.
    The “smart things” in the IoUWT would include underwater sensors, smart buoys,
    autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and ships. The design of the IoUWT would
    be strongly influenced by the unique factors for network communications in the
    water-based medium compared to communications in a traditional terrestrial medium.
    The network communications in the IoUWT would employ acoustic links compared to
    radio waves for a terrestrial-based IoT. The acoustic medium for network communications
    would suffer from long propagation delays, high bit error rates and short network
    bandwidth [5]. The authors in [23] identified some further challenges for the
    IoUWT: (1) Energy efficiency and difficulty to recharge. Due to the high deployment
    costs of the underwater sensors and the difficulty to recharge the devices, energy
    efficiency is an important challenge for the IoUWT; (2) Changes to network topology
    due to movement of the underwater sensors; and (3) Unstable and low reliability
    due to transmission loss of the acoustic signals being absorbed by the water environment.
    Two approaches for energy efficient medium access control (MAC) and routing protocols
    for the IoUWT can be found in the works by [24], [25]. Medium access control (MAC)
    protocols developed for terrestrial IoTs such as carrier-sense multiple access
    (CSMA) or time-division multiple access (TDMA) do not perform well underwater.
    The authors in [24] proposed an energy efficient MAC protocol for underwater sensor
    networks termed EE-MAC. The EE-MAC protocol achieves the energy efficiency by
    minimizing the idle listening period and reduces the energy loss due to packet
    collisions. The authors in [25] proposed an energy efficient routing protocol
    which is efficient in packet forwarding and energy consumption for the IoUWT termed
    E-CARP. The E-CARP protocol uses a greedy routing strategy to deliver packets
    hop-by-hop and reduces the number of control packets to lower the energy consumption
    and increase the lifetime of the sensor nodes in the IoUWT. F. Internet of Underground
    Things (IoUGT) The Internet of Underground Things (IoUGT) [27], [28] is another
    example of a communications medium-driven ASIoT targeted in this case for underground
    network communications. The IoUGT is particularly useful for applications in environmental
    monitoring, landslide and earthquake monitoring and precision agriculture (e.g.
    for real-time soil sensing and monitoring [27]). The smart things in the IoUGT
    include underground (UG) objects (e.g. buried soil sensors for temperature, moisture,
    pH sensing, buried seismometers), above ground (AG) smart objects (e.g. base stations
    and mobile sinks), smart interfaces for field machinery and irrigation systems.
    Being a communications-medium driven ASIoT, the design of the IoUGT would be influenced
    by the underground network communications (in this case through electromagnetic
    (EM) wave propagation through a dense substance such as soil or rock). The authors
    in [28] identified four design challenges for wireless sensor communications in
    underground channels: (1) Power conservation and recharge ability – The IoUGT
    faces similar challenges to the IoUWT for recharging or replacing the deployed
    smart devices (in this case, the smart devices would be buried underground with
    difficulty to access physically). The factors which affect communication with
    EM waves in underground environments include path loss due to material absorption,
    reflection/refraction, multi-path fading, reduced propagation velocity and noise
    [28]; (2) Topology design – The topology and deployment of the sink/relay objects
    could be completely underground or utilize a hybrid structure where field vehicles
    or machinery function as mobile sinks for data collection from the underground
    sensors; (3) Antenna design – some challenges include antenna size and directionality
    (e.g. using a single omni-directional or a group of independent directional antennas);
    and (4) Environmental extremes – threats from extreme temperatures, water, animals
    and insects. A recent work by the authors in [29] performed a comprehensive connectivity
    analysis of underground sensors in wireless underground sensor networks for the
    effects of environment parameters such as soil moisture and composition, and for
    system parameters such as node density and propagation techniques. The authors
    remarked that their connectivity analysis can be used as a framework when considering
    the connectivity of wireless underground sensor nodes with other kinds of environment
    and system parameters. G. Internet of Nano Things (IoNT) The Internet of Nano
    Things (IoNT) [7], [30] serves as an example of an ASIoT which is targeted towards
    realization for a specific technology constraint-domain (in this case nanotechnology)
    and the design parameters are strongly influenced by what communications and information
    processing can be performed in this (nanotechnology) domain. Communications on
    the nanoscale can take two forms: (1) Molecular communication – utilizing the
    transmission and reception of information encoded in molecules; and (2) Nano-electromagnetic
    communication – utilizing the transmission and reception of EM radiation based
    on novel nanomaterials [7]. The smart things in the nanotechnology domain include
    nano-sensors, nano-actuators, nano-nodes, nano-routers, nano-micro interface and
    gateways (e.g. smartphones) to connect the IoNT to the global Internet. The design
    challenges for the IoNT stems from the properties of the nanomaterials used (e.g.
    graphene nanoribbon (GNR) or carbon nanotube (CNT)). The works in [30] and [31]
    extended the concept of the IoNT to the Internet of Multimedia Nano Things (IoMNT)
    and the Internet of Bio Nano Things (IoBNT). The IoBNT requires the development
    of connections between the biochemical domain of molecular nanonetworks and the
    electrical domain of electromagnetic networks with the promise of continuous health
    monitoring and bacterial sensor-actuator networks inside the human body. The authors
    in [32] proposed the use of field effect transistor based biosensors (bioFETs)
    to construct a molecular antenna capable of transducing molecular messages into
    electrical signals. H. Internet of Mobile Things In the traditional IoT, the sensor
    nodes and devices are mostly static within the network. The Internet of Mobile
    Things (IoMobT) [33] represents an ASIoT where the smart things can move independently
    and remain accessible within the network. The “smart things” in the IoMobT would
    include mobile personal devices (e.g. smartphones, tablets), mobile robots and
    vehicles on highways. The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is a good example of the
    IoMobT. The authors in [33] identified four challenges to be addressed for the
    IoMobT: (1) Mobile Data Collection – Movement of the smart objects within the
    network generates unpredictability and an increased number of faults and disruptions
    for data collection; (2) Mobile Data Analytics – Characterizing and utilizing
    learnt mobility patterns of the smart objects to improve data analysis tasks;
    (3) Energy Management – Allowing the direct energy exchange among the different
    smart objects (e.g. an electric vehicle within the IoV can transfer available
    energy to another vehicle or to the smart grid (i.e. V2G technology)); and (4)
    Security and Privacy – Authenticating new smart devices and objects and preserving
    location privacy of the objects. The works in [34], [35] further proposed improvements
    towards the IoMobT. The authors in [34] proposed a middleware concept termed Mobile
    Hub for the IoMobT which allows the smart objects in the IoMobT to move autonomously
    and remain remotely accessible over the Internet. The authors in [35] proposed
    a platform as a service (PaaS) fog computing model termed Mobile Fog for the IoMobT
    that has the advantages of being geospatially distributed, large-scale and latency-sensitive.
    SECTION III. Use Case for a Biometrics-Based ASIoT This section gives an illustration
    for a user domain-driven ASIoT for biometrics termed IoBioT. The section first
    gives an introduction to biometric systems for the IoT. We then give discussions
    for a layer architecture for the IoBioT, and some design parameters and customizations
    for security, key management and Big data information processing. A. Biometrics
    and IoT Systems Biometric systems are becoming essential for authentication purposes
    particularly for usage in embedded devices such as the IoT. In 2000, the Gartner
    Group remarked that biometric identification (e.g. fingerprints, face and voice)
    will emerge as the only way to truly authenticate an individual, which will become
    increasingly important as security and privacy concerns grow. Initial systems
    for biometrics applications used standalone devices connected to a central server
    which performed the information processing and authentication tasks. With the
    rapid proliferation and increasing processing capability of smartphone and IoT
    devices, together with wide-scale network connectivity, distributed approaches
    where the processing tasks are performed at the edge of the network (or termed
    as edge or fog computing techniques) are becoming popular. Fig. 1 shows the Hype
    Cycle for Emerging Technologies from Gartner in 2017 [36]. FIGURE 1. Gartner 2017
    Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies showing IoT and edge computing technologies
    [36]. Show All An interesting observation as shown in Fig. 1 is the closeness
    for the technology trends for edge computing and IoT. This also motivates the
    development of the biometrics ASIoT (IoBioT) which requires fast response times
    to perform the authentication tasks. In the IoBioT, this can be achieved by performing
    the information processing on the IoT devices instead of having to transmit the
    biometrics data across the IoT network and waiting for the response from the central
    server. Some examples of works for implementing biometrics on the IoT or embedded
    devices can be found in [37], [38]. These works used the Raspberry Pi as the IoT
    device for implementation. Compared to the works in [37], [38] which focused the
    discussion on implementation in embedded devices, this section takes a broader
    perspective for the IoBioT to serve as an illustration for developing domain-driven
    IoT technologies and aims to spur researchers towards developing ASIoTs for different
    domains and platforms in general, and towards the development of the IoBioT specifically.
    B. Biometrics ASIoT Layer Architecture This section introduces the major elements
    in the Biometrics ASIoT (IoBIoT) infrastructure. Fig. 2 shows a diagram of the
    Biometrics ASIoT elements and the building blocks components in its layers. Fig.
    3 shows an overview of the IoBioT layer architecture. There are seven core layers
    within this architecture (Identification Layer, Biometrics Object Layer, Device
    Layer, Communication Layer, Cloud Services Layer, Big Biometrics Data Computation
    Layer and Application layer). We will give particular focus for two customizations
    which are important for the biometrics IoT domain: (1) End-to-end security and
    key management; and (2) Big data information processing using divide-and-conquer
    approaches. The layer customizations for end-to-end security and key management
    for the IoBioT will be discussed in Section III-(C). As shown in Fig. 3, the Big
    Biometrics Data Computation Layer is designed specifically for biometrics processing
    and contains dedicated computational units for data centralization, data aggregation,
    divide and conquer feature extraction, data fusion and decision making. This customized
    layer for Big data information processing will be discussed further in Section
    III-(D). FIGURE 2. Elements and components in the Biometrics ASIoT (IoBIoT) layers.
    (a) Biometrics ASIoT elements. (b) IoBIoT components. Show All FIGURE 3. The proposed
    Biometric ASIoT (IoBioT) architecture. Show All The first layer in the IoBioT
    is the Identification (ID) Layer. The ID layer functions to uniquely identify
    the smart things and objects within the IoBioT. Examples of ID codes are electronic
    product codes (EPC), uCodes and IP addresses (e.g. IPv6 addresses can be used
    to uniquely identify billions of objects and devices). The second layer (Biometrics
    Object Layer) functions to gather data from multiple biometrics sensors (e.g.
    face, fingerprint, voice/speech, iris and palm data) or objects from users within
    the network, and transmits the data to a central cloud for further processing.
    The biometric data can be collected from various locations (e.g. smartphones,
    smart cars, smart devices, smart appliances and smart homes). Some biometrics
    data are not scalar data and may involve different types of sensors. Multi-biometrics
    authentications would require data from multiple modalities to be collected from
    various biometrics sensors. The Device Layer in the IoBioT consists of components
    (e.g. wearable devices, body sensor nodes, wireless motes, etc.) to transmit the
    sensed biometrics data to the higher layers of the IoBioT. An important issue
    in this layer is to secure the biometric data before an attacker can get hold
    of it. Security issues and challenges in this layer include the need to avoid
    resource-demanding cryptographic protocols to meet the hardware-constrained (e.g.
    low computational power, memory and limited energy resources) requirements for
    IoT devices. Lightweight cryptography protocols [39], [40] which are suitable
    for implementation on hardware-constrained devices can be utilized in this layer.
    Security issues for the IoBioT nodes in this layer include attacks from an adversary
    to deplete the energy resources of the nodes by repeatedly making excessive requests
    or transmissions so that the nodes would have to make unnecessary transmissions.
    The fourth layer (Communication Layer) in the IoBioT serves the same function
    as that within the conventional IoT with three sub-layers or components: (1) Link
    sub-layer – responsible for the MAC protocols to be used within the IoBioT; (2)
    Network sub-layer – responsible for connectivity and routing decisions within
    the IoBioT (e.g. can utilize RPL protocol for routing over low Power and lossy
    networks [41]); and (3) Transport sub-layer – responsible for end-to-end communications
    by providing flow and congestion control mechanisms (e.g. can utilize UDP or TCP
    protocols). The Cloud Services Layer provides the core hardware infrastructure,
    servers, platform and storage and gives flexibility and scalability for the IoBioT
    applications. Using virtualization technology, it provides a system architecture
    with distributed parallel environments which can run multiple computational units
    to give fast computational response and high reliability. The elements in the
    IoBioT cloud could be formed from the private cloud within an organization or
    the public cloud (e.g. can utilize Amazon EC2 or Microsoft Azure). The Big Biometrics
    Data Computation Layer functions as a customized processing layer in the IoBioT
    to serve the need for Big data information processing. It contains the hardware
    components (e.g. data centers, GPUs, parallel platforms, FPGAs, SOCs) and software
    components (e.g. MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark) to perform computations in the IoT.
    For the IoBioT, we also include a software component to perform the multimodal
    Big data analytics using a divide and conquer paradigm which is discussed in Section
    III-(D). The smart objects send their data to the cloud for processing in real-time
    and then deliver results to end users from the extracted Big data. The final layer
    (Application Layer) in the IoBioT is responsible for providing services and determines
    a set of protocols for message passing. The IEEE 802.15.4 proposes the CoAP [42]
    as a key component for the low power IoT to reduce overheads and enhance packet
    delivery. The CoAP has two layers where the first layer is the messaging layer
    and the second layer is the request/response layer. The CoAP protocol uses the
    Datagram Transport-Layer Security (DTLS) to secure the CoAP messages. The authors
    in [43] proposed a fully implemented end-to-end application layer security architecture
    for the IoT based on existing Internet standards and communication stacks that
    use UDP/IPv6 networking for Low Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs).
    C. IoBioT Customizations for Security and Key Management This section gives some
    customizations for end-to-end security and key management for the IoBioT for securing
    the biometrics data from the device to the central collector (e.g. gateway) at
    the edge of the wireless network. The gateway provides the nodes in the IoBioT
    access to the global Internet. As in wireless sensor networks, messages are relayed
    from node to node until it reaches the gateway. There is also no requirement that
    all nodes in the network are under control or there may be imposter nodes as shown
    in Fig. 4. Thus, end-to-end security is essential to ensure that messages cannot
    be intercepted on the route from the sending IoBioT node to the gateway. FIGURE
    4. Adversary or imposter nodes and gateways in the IoBioT. Show All The authors
    in [44] identified a security issue to be addressed when a malicious compromised
    node forges a communication message and transmits to the gateway. The issue of
    forged nodes or gateways is highly important for the IoBioT especially for biometrics
    applications requiring high security such as hospital and medical monitoring systems.
    We consider the scenario when both malicious adversary nodes ( N A ) and gateways
    ( G A ) are forged and inserted into the IoBioT as shown in Fig. 4. Thus, there
    is a need to authenticate a new IoBioT node to the gateway, as well as to authenticate
    the gateway to an IoBioT node. We assume the presence of a Trusted Authority (TA)
    in the network for the following approach to authenticate IoBioT node i ( IoBio
    T i ) to Gateway j ( G j ) and vice versa. The secure data transfer from node
    to gateway can then take place using a shared key ( K ij ) after successful authentication.
    Initally, the TA generates a master secret key (sk) and public key (pk). The p
    k is made available to all devices on the network. When a new IoBioT node is added
    to the network, it first needs to authenticate itself to G j . The node sends
    to TA its node identity ( IoBio T i ), G j and the current timestamp ( T c ) all
    encrypted by pk. IoBioT i →TA:{ IoBioT i , G j , T c }pk (1) View Source The TA
    checks the timestamp, and if valid sends back to IoBio T i the shared key (Kij),
    a nonce ( N 1 ), the timestamp and a message encrypted with s k Gj all encrypted
    by the public key of the node. TA→ IoBioT i :{ K ij , N 1 , T c ,{ K ij ,pk} sk
    Gj } pk IoBioTi (2) View Source IoBioTi checks T c and N 1 and if valid sends
    to G j the shared key ( K ij ), a new nonce ( N 2 ), the timestamp and the secret
    message for G j received from the TA all encrypted by the public key of G j .
    IoBioT i → G j :{ K ij , N 2 , T c ,{ K ij ,pk} sk Gj } pk Gj (3) View Source
    G j checks T c and if valid decrypts the message encrypted with s k Gj from the
    TA and retrieves the shared key ( K ij ). G j then replies to IoBio T i with N
    2 and another new nonce ( N 3 ) encrypted by the public key of IoBio T i all encrypted
    by the shared key K ij . G j → IoBioT i :{{ N 2 , N 3 } pk IoBioTi , T c } K ij
    (4) View Source IoBio T i checks T c and N 2 and if valid, it is assured that
    G j is authenticated with the TA. IoBio T i sends to G j N 3 and the timestamp
    all encrypted by the shared key K ij . IoBioT i → G j :{ N 3 , T c } K ij (5)
    View Source G j checks T c and N 3 and if valid, it is assured that IoBio T i
    is authenticated with the TA. IoBio T i and G j can then communicate securely
    using the shared key K ij and be assured that they are communicating with legitimate
    and not forged entities within the IoBioT. These security and key management customizations
    would enable the realization for biometrics applications requiring high security.
    The generation of the sk and pk could use low complexity elliptic curve techniques
    [45]. D. IoBioT Customizations for Big Data Processing This section gives some
    customizations for Big data information processing and analytics for the IoBioT.
    This is performed in the Big Biometrics Data Computation Layer as shown in Fig.
    3. The processing layer caters for all kinds of biometric data. It also allows
    the multi-modalities fusion and decision making at the final stage. The divide
    and conquer feature extraction mechanism is presented to process these data blocks
    to obtain the feature blocks. The proposed structure of this layer is composed
    of four units: (1) Biometrics Data Centralized Unit (Bio_Data_CU); (2) Biometrics
    Data Aggregation & Pre-processing Unit (Bio_Data_APU); (3) Divide & Conquer Biometrics
    Feature Extraction Unit (D&C_Bio_FEU); and (4) Biometrics Decision Making Unit
    (Bio_DMU). The Bio_Data_CU is the first component in the Computation Layer and
    processes the raw data from various biometrics objects or devices with their own
    identity. The data from these objects can be video, images, voice, etc. This unit
    is also responsible for combining the objects data with their unique identity.
    This process of the Bio_Data_CU is illustrated in Fig. 3. After the raw data pre-processing
    in Bio_Data_CU has been completed, the processed data is passed to the Bio_Data_APU.
    This unit is responsible to perform data aggregation and arranges the data into
    blocks for the same object source based on its identity and biometrics modality
    and tries to create equal sizes of data blocks. In this unit, the aggregation
    and compilation service is supported by various algorithms that compile, organize,
    store and transmit the results. It also has some pre-processing functions for
    different modalities of biometrics data before performing the data analytics in
    the next units. The Bio_Data_CU and the Bio_Data_APU serves different functions
    in the Big Biometrics Data Computation Layer for the IoBioT. As illustrated in
    Fig. 3, The focus of the Bio_Data_CU is towards data arrangement and processing
    for biometric objects, whereas the focus of the Bio_Data_APU is towards data arrangement
    and processing for the different modalities (e.g. face, fingerprint, iris, etc.)
    found in multimodal biometrics data. The D&C_Bio_FEU is the third component in
    the layer. The divide and conquer mechanism in this unit plays an important role
    to enhance the scalability of the IoBioT architecture and improve the computational
    efficiency of the processing. The divide and conquer mechanism with their own
    servers processes the data of each biometrics modality efficiently for performing
    the parallel processing or tasks. The deployment of the specific feature extraction
    function depends on the biometrics data and its modality to extract the target
    features (e.g. ridge features for fingerprints, visual features for face biometrics
    and audio features for audio signal/speech). Fig. 5 shows the flow chart of the
    proposed divide and conquer mechanism for the aggregated biometrics data blocks.
    FIGURE 5. Customized divide and conquer mechanism to extract important features
    of different biometric data. Show All The type of biometrics data of the aggregated
    data blocks decides which feature function for the divide and conquer mechanism
    in the D&C_Bio_FEU is to be deployed. There are three main functions in the general
    mechanism: (1) Divide function; (2) Conquer function; and (3) Customized feature
    extraction function to target the specific feature. The divide function is responsible
    for divisions of block recursively until the block size reaches its threshold.
    The function takes the aggregated data block and divides the incoming block into
    two equal parts or sub-blocks (e.g. horizontally or vertically) recursively until
    it reaches to the block size threshold. Then the target feature extraction function
    is called for each divided or sub-block to extract the local features. The type
    and number of features vary and depends on the need of the biometrics application
    (e.g. minutiae for fingerprint features, spectral, mel-frequency cepstral coefficients
    (MFCC), zero-crossing rate (ZCR), linear prediction coefficients (LPC) for audio
    or speech features, optical flows and motion patterns for gait features). Other
    biometric features include hand geometry, palm print, knuckle print, vein patterns,
    etc. These features are extracted from the sub-blocks during the divide and conquer
    mechanism. The conquer function then is initiated to combine and process the features
    in reverse order by taking each two neighbors’ sub-blocks local features. These
    feature blocks will be sent to the next stage of Bio_DMU for combination or fusion
    of feature blocks before decision making. Some examples for divide and conquer
    approaches for feature processing can be found in the works by [46], [47]. The
    Bio_DMU is the final stage of the computation layer. It contains fundamental support
    components (e.g. features/results storage devices, decision-making servers and
    communications infrastructure). The servers are supported by various algorithms
    that organize, store, and transmit the features/results with the intention that
    the data can be used by any server for its processing at any time. The algorithms
    to be used depend on the user domain biometric requirements. The Decision Making
    Server is also supported by various algorithms in order to make decisions for
    different scenarios and requirements. The decision making algorithm should be
    intelligent and efficient enough to efficiently produce a good decision. After
    the decision has been made, Bio_DMU returns the final desired output so that any
    application can utilize these decisions at real-time or offline for their respective
    requirements. The decision-making in the Bio_DMU depends on the data modality
    of the biometrics data: (1) Single modality; and (2) Multi-modality. The feature
    blocks of biometrics data with single modality are sent to the Single Modality
    Decision Making module in the Bio_DMU. The decision making process is straightforward.
    There is a customized design of decision mechanism for the single modality and
    also specific applications. This unit can operate in two modes with built-in functionalities:
    (1) Verification; and (2) Identification. The verification process is described
    as a 1–to–1 matching system because the system tries to match the biometric presented
    by the individual against a specific biometric already in the database. The identification
    process is described as a 1-to- n matching system, where n is the total number
    of biometric templates in the database. Biometrics templates stored in the database
    can be obtained from the cloud and this computation layer also provides the access
    to the cloud database in the previous cloud services as illustrated in Fig. 3.
    The decision making for the modality can be made using machine learning techniques
    such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning or reinforcement learning.
    If the decision involves more than one type/modality of biometrics data, the sets
    of multimodal features blocks for each input multimodal partitioned data block
    are sent to the Multimodal Decision Making module in Bio_DMU. The final process
    is required to integrate and perform fusion of the features from different modalities
    in order to make the decision. Two scenarios need to be considered: (1) Decision
    Level Fusion; and (2) Feature Level Fusion. For decision level fusion and decision
    making, the target analysis first provides the local decisions based on individual
    modality feature blocks. The local decisions are then combined using a final decision
    fusion module to make a fused decision vector that is analyzed further to obtain
    a final decision. For feature level fusion and decision making, the feature blocks
    are first combined and then sent as input to the feature fusion module which merges
    the sets of features blocks from different modalities before the decision making.
    E. Biometrics Face Recognition and Experiments Sections III(B)–(D) have proposed
    the architecture of Biometrics ASIoT (IoBIoT) and customizations for Big Data
    Processing. One of the main components in the proposed architecture is the Biometrics
    Data Divide & Conquer Feature Extraction Unit which consists of the divide and
    conquer sub-systems. This section provides a case study of biometrics face recognition
    where the single modality is the face image. In many biometrics applications,
    principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) are
    two well-known and widely used feature extraction techniques. PCA and LDA are
    normally used together in a cascade operation to extract features in biometrics.
    The original versions of PCA, LDA or PCA-LDA (Fisherface technique) and their
    current extensions were not designed for Big data computation and do not scale
    well for Big data applications. To conduct the experiments for biometrics face
    recognition in Big biometric data computation layer in IoBIoT, our previous research
    work on divide-and-conquer approaches [55], Divide and Conquer PCA (DC-PCA) and
    Divide and Conquer LDA (DC-LDA) for Big data information processing are applied
    as shown in Fig. 6. FIGURE 6. Experimental approach of Biometrics Face Recognition.
    Show All Experimental results using the ORL [56] and Yale [57] datasets containing
    real-world variations for face recognition are presented to validate the approach
    and comparisons are given for the classification performance of the approach versus
    other traditional techniques which do not use the divide and conquer approach.
    The ORL dataset contains 400 images of 40 people containing 10 samples for each
    person with variations such as facial expressions and appearance. The experiments
    used five samples for each person for training and the remaining samples were
    used for testing. The Yale face database demonstrate variations in lighting conditions,
    facial expressions and facial details. The database contains 11 different images
    for each of 15 people. The experiments used 90 samples from the 15 people for
    training and the remaining samples were used for testing. Table 2. shows a summary
    of the performance comparisons. For the ORL dataset, the DC-PCA+LDA gave a recognition
    rate of 86% compared to 71% and 83% for PCA and Fisherface respectively, while
    for the Yale dataset, the DC-PCA+LDA gave a recognition rate of 62% compared to
    18% and 60% for PCA and Fisherface respectively. The results validated the performance
    efficacy of the DC-PCA+LDA compared with the traditional PCA and Fisherface methods.
    Although the experimental objectives were to validate the divide and conquer feature
    extraction approach for Big data computation, the results for DC-PCA+LDA gave
    better performance than the established Fisherface approach. TABLE 2 Summary of
    the Performance Comparisons for ORL and Yale Datasets SECTION IV. Future Directions
    and Research for ASIoTs This section discusses lessons learnt from the use case
    studies and some important challenges and future directions for designing and
    building ASIoTs. From the discussions in Section III and the observations in Table
    1, we identify four areas and perspectives towards future research for ASIoTs:
    (1) Interoperability among ASIoTs; (2) Energy efficient operation in ASIoTs; (3)
    Edge and fog machine learning models for ASIoTs; and (4) Security and privacy
    challenges for ASIoTs. A. Interoperability Among ASIoTs ASIoTs may contain a wide
    range of sensors, smart objects/devices and platforms from different manufacturers
    and vendors to be deployed within a specific domain. To achieve deployment of
    the ASIoT on a large-scale, these smart objects which may come from different
    manufacturers and vendors require the capabilities to interoperate and communicate
    with other smart objects within the IoT. The authors in [48] discuss a useful
    taxonomy for interoperability in IoT from five perspectives: (1) Device interoperability
    – mechanisms for integrating new devices into the IoT and message exchange among
    heterogeneous communication protocols within devices; (2) Network interoperability
    – mechanisms for end to end communication through diverse (wireless and wired)
    and heterogeneous communication networks; (3) Syntactical interoperability – interoperation
    of the data structure, format and interface for information exchange among the
    IoT entities; (4) Semantic interoperability – data and information models to allow
    IoT systems, services and applications to exchange information, data and knowledge
    in a meaningful way; and (5) Platform interoperability – mechanisms for information
    exchange across cross-platforms and cross-domains IoTs with diverse operating
    systems, architectures, access mechanisms for smart objects and data. The authors
    in [49] proposed a novel interoperability deployment for the industrial IoT domain
    using software-defined networks (SDNs) to manage different types of physical devices
    (industrial robot, automated guided vehicle, RFID reader, etc.), industrial wireless
    networks and cloud services and provide an interface for information exchange.
    B. Energy Efficient Operation in ASIoTs Many smart objects and devices in ASIoTs
    may rely on battery-powered sources with limited energy and/or may not be easily
    accessible for recharging purposes (e.g. in communications medium-driven IoUGTs
    and IoUWTs). Similar as for WSNs, the energy efficient operation and the need
    to optimize the network lifetime remains a critical challenge for ASIoTs. Novel
    and customized solutions for energy efficiency can be designed for different ASIoTs
    based on their specific deployment environment and requirements. The energy efficient
    solution used for one ASIoT may be different from solutions for other ASIoTs.
    The authors in [50] give an illustrative example of analyzing and designing an
    energy efficient ASIoT for the user domain of heritage artwork conservation. Their
    design considered the measurement requirements (e.g. sampling rate), aspects of
    the node design (e.g. sleep modes), gateway design, cloud infrastructure and user
    interface to determine the energy efficient requirements of the IoT operation.
    Using a small 1.7 mAh lithium-thionyl battery, their design was able to achieve
    a node lifespan of over twenty years by utilizing LoRa technology without the
    need for battery replacement. C. Edge and Fog Machine Learning Models for ASIoTs
    The authors in [51] remarked on the importance of cross-domain and multimodal
    inference and analytics for large-scale networked sensor systems which is also
    applicable towards ASIoTs where data is collected from a variety of sensing sources
    and domains. It is expected that new machine learning algorithms, data science
    and analytics will play a key role to extract value from the next generation of
    IoTs. A recent survey of machine learning techniques for the IoT can be found
    in [52]. A critical challenge for IoTs is to implement the machine learning algorithms
    (which can be computationally and/or storage intensive) on the resource-constrained
    smart objects or devices itself (or termed as edge or fog computing models). The
    authors in [53] remarked that the implementation of machine learning inference
    analytics on edge devices has huge potential and is still in its early stages.
    They also demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing and testing
    three machine learning algorithms (random forests, support vector machine and
    multi-layer perceptron) on the Raspberry Pi to profile their performance in terms
    of speed, accuracy and power consumption. The implementation of new machine learning
    algorithms such as deep learning techniques and convolutional neural networks
    on edge devices remain a significant challenge to be addressed. D. Security and
    Privacy Challenges for ASIoTs The security requirements for different ASIoTs may
    vary considerably and this gives opportunities for cost-effective and energy efficient
    customizations (e.g. the requirements for the IoBT would be much stringent and
    higher than for the IoAT). The IoAT can be deployed with less stringent and computationally
    lower (or no) cryptographic protocols to reduce the power consumption requirements
    for the sensor nodes. Similarly, the security and privacy requirements for an
    IoT-based smart home would be different from that for an IoT to be deployed in
    a manufacturing environment. The number of potential threats, vulnerabilities
    and attacks towards an IoT is wide ranging due to the large number of attack surfaces
    and domains. The authors in [54] give a survey of potential security attacks and
    countermeasures in three IoT domains: (1) Sensing domain (e.g. jamming, vampire,
    selective forwarding, sinkhole attacks); (2) Cloud domain (e.g. hidden channel,
    VM escape, theft of service, VM migration, insider attacks); and (3) Fog domain
    (e.g. authentication and trust issues, privacy issues, denial-of-service (DoS)
    attacks). The privacy issues in the fog domain occur because fog devices will
    be able to infer the location of all the smart objects that are connected to the
    fog device and by extension track the location of users that are operating the
    devices. SECTION V. Conclusion This paper has reviewed and summarized the emerging
    area of application specific Internet of Things (ASIoTs) and given a basic taxonomy
    into three categories (user domain-driven, communications medium-driven, and technology
    constraint-driven ASIoTs). Several representative examples of the different classes
    of ASIoTs have been drawn from the literature for illustration of the challenges
    and design parameters to be optimized for the various ASIoTs. The design parameters
    for user domain-driven ASIoTs will require optimization for parameters defined
    by the specific user domain. The design parameters for communications medium-driven
    ASIoTs wil require optimization for the network communications in the medium (e.g.
    terrestrial, underwater, underground mediums) with different properties and characteristics.
    The design parameters for technology-driven ASIoTs will require optimization to
    meet the constraints of the technology implementation. The paper has also given
    a use case illustration for a biometrics-based ASIoT (IoBioT) and some layer customizations
    for security, key management and Big data information processing. Experiments
    on face-based biometrics have been performed to validate the Big biometric data
    computation layer in the IoBioT. Finally, perspectives and directions have also
    been discussed for future research covering interoperability, energy efficient
    operation, edge/fog machine learning models, and security/privacy challenges for
    ASIoTs. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like This A

    Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Footnotes Abstract: This
    paper provides recent advances in the area of Internet of Underground Things (IoUT)
    with emphasis on enabling communication technologies, networking issues, and localization
    techniques. IoUT is enabled by underground things (sensors), communication technology,
    and networking protocols. This new paradigm of IoUT facilitates the integration
    of sensing and communication in the underground environment for various industries,
    such as oil and gas, agriculture, seismic mapping, and border monitoring. These
    applications require to gather relevant information from the deployed underground
    things. However, the harsh underground propagation environment including sand,
    rock, and watersheds do not allow the use of single communication technology for
    information transfer between the surface and the underground things. Therefore,
    various wireless and wired communication technologies are used for underground
    communication. The wireless technologies are based on acoustic waves, electromagnetic
    waves, magnetic induction and visible light communication while the wired technologies
    use coaxial cable and optical fibers. In this paper, state-of-art communication
    technologies are surveyed, and the respective networking and localization techniques
    for IoUT are presented. Moreover, the advances and applications of IoUT are also
    reported. Also, new research challenges for the design and implementation of IoUT
    are identified. Published in: IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials ( Volume:

    Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction The population of the world will increase
    by 31% in 2050 [1], and therefore will require more natural resources and food
    to survive. In the next three decades with such increase in population, 71% more
    resources are required [2]. This ever-increasing demand for resources needs novel
    technologies to improve the underground exploration for natural resources and
    to produce more crop. The subsurface environment and agricultural lands provide
    various natural resources, such as earth minerals, fossil fuels, metal ores, groundwater,
    and food. To efficiently use all of these resources, Internet of Underground Things
    (IoUT) is an enabling technology which can provide smart oil and gas fields, smart
    agriculture fields, and smart seismic quality control. However, implementation
    of IoUT is a challenging task due to the harsh underground environment which requires
    low power and small size underground sensors, long-range communication technology,
    efficient networking solutions, and accurate localization techniques. The above
    applications and challenges of IoUT lead to active research in this area. The
    significant difference between the in-air Internet of things and IoUT is the communication
    media where the sensors (underground things) are buried and communicate through
    the soil. Note that there is also a possibility to place the underground things
    in an open underground space, such as mines and tunnels. In this case, the network
    setup is underground, but the communication between the devices takes place through
    the air and hence terrestrial wireless technologies, such as radio frequency (RF)
    and visible light (VLC) are used. There are existing review articles on information
    and communication systems for mines and tunnels. For example, in [3], the authors
    briefly discuss the information and communications systems for mining IoT. Similarly,
    the authors in [4] presented a survey on the applications of wireless sensor networks
    for underground coal and mines. However, communication through the soil is different
    where the transmission signal suffers from various underground impairments. Hence,
    in this paper, we collect the literature on communication, networking, and localization
    for buried smart objects.1 Due to the heterogeneous nature of the soil which consists
    of sand, rock, and watersheds, communication through it is more challenging. In
    the past, various solutions were used for underground communications. For example,
    the use of mud pulse telemetry (MPT) communication systems for oil and gas monitoring
    dates back to the mid of the 19th century [6]. The MPT systems work on the concept
    of mud circulation in the pipes for data transmission [7]. Although MPT systems
    are well-developed for down-hole monitoring, their data rate is low, i.e., in
    bits per second. To improve the data rates for underground communications, wired
    cables, such as coaxial cables and fiber optics are also used. These wired solutions
    provide high data rates, timely, reliable and accurate solutions, especially for
    the deep underground monitoring. Therefore, wired technologies including coaxial
    cable and optical fiber are used in many works, such as [8]–[10] for down-hole
    monitoring. Although wired solutions have the above advantages, they have high
    complexity and are not scalable solutions. Therefore, wireless solutions are investigated
    to provide low complex, high data rate, and scalable solutions. These wireless
    solutions include acoustic waves, electromagnetic waves (EM), magnetic-induction
    (MI), and VLC. Acoustic waves are used for the detection of objects underground,
    soil moisture detection, and down-hole communications. For example, in [11], the
    authors used 2 to 6 kHz frequencies to detect an underground object. Similarly,
    a frequency of 900 Hz was used in [12] to find the soil moisture. Recently, the
    authors in [13] and [14] proposed acoustic waves based wireless data transmission
    system (SoilComm) for IoUTs that was able to transmit the sensing data over 30
    m distance through the soil. Acoustic waves-based solutions are good for detection
    purposes, such as underground object detection and soil moisture detection. However,
    they provide low data rate communication, i.e., in tens of bits per second for
    down-hole monitoring and also suffers from the acoustic noise and attenuation
    of the acoustic signal along the drill-pipe [15]. To investigate the use of EM
    waves for underground communications, various frequencies of the EM spectrum were
    examined in the past starting from below 500 kHz [16]–[18] to 120 THz [19]. Depending
    on the frequency of EM waves, the transmission range of EM signal varies from
    a few meters (few hundred kHz) to centimeters (THz). Due to their low penetration
    depth in the soil, EM waves are mainly used for agriculture applications. For
    example, in [20] the authors presented EM waves-based IoUT solution for precision
    agriculture. The EM waves suffer from severe path loss in soil, and therefore
    their transmission range is low. Especially underground watersheds have a notoriously
    bad impact on the propagation of EM waves by limiting its transmission range.
    Alternatively, multi-hop MI-based underground communications is examined in the
    recent past [21]. Although the MI channel is more robust to the underground environment,
    it suffers from low transmission range and requires perfect orientation of the
    transmitter and receiver coils which might be challenging in the underground environment.
    The research on developing MI-based IoUT is still in the academic phase and faces
    various challenges. Nevertheless, VLC is also being investigated for the underground
    communications in gas reservoirs [22]. However, in the VLC based system, the propagation
    of light is affected by the gas as well as it requires perfect alignment between
    the LEDs and the photo-detector. In short, among all these solutions, MPT systems,
    coaxial cable, fiber optics are the commercially available technologies for down-hole
    monitoring while acoustic, EM, MI, and VLC based systems are still in the academic
    phase of research and are only tested by lab experiments. Table I compares various
    communication technologies for IoUT. TABLE I Comparison of Underground Communication
    Technologies for IoUT A. Related Surveys There are quite few survey articles published
    that cover various issues of IoUTs. For example, the work in [20] presents the
    EM waves based IoUTs for precise agriculture. Moreover, [20] also reviews the
    academic testbeds and commercial solutions for precise agriculture. In [23], the
    authors give an overview of MI-based underground wireless sensor networks and
    present challenges and applications. The authors in [24] present the recent advances
    and challenges for wireless sensor networks in the oil and gas industry. The contributions
    of this article relative to the existing literature on IoUT is summarized as follows:
    Compared to existing papers for IoUTs, this paper provides a deeper understanding
    of the all relevant communication technologies, networking solutions, and localization
    techniques which can be used to implement various IoUT-based applications. The
    existing surveys only present the literature on EM and MI-based underground wireless
    communication networks. However, we also collect the research on acoustic, mud-pulse
    telemetry, visible light, and wired-based communication technologies for various
    IoUT applications. We survey the key challenges to implement IoUT and explore
    the relationship between IoUT, big data analytics, cloud, and fog computing. B.
    Survey Organization The main focus of the paper is to review channel modeling,
    networking, and localization methods for the current sensing and communication
    technologies used in IoUT. However, for some of the techniques, such as acoustic,
    visible light communications, and mud-pulse telemetry, the networking, and localization
    problem is still an open research problem. Fig. 1 illustrates the organization

    EM Waves for IoUT EM waves are widely used for underground communication and sensing
    to enable various applications, such as smart agriculture [25]–[28], smart seismic
    exploration [29], smart drilling, and smart oil and gas fields [30]–[32]. In this
    section, we cover the literature on the channel modeling and networking for EM-based
    IoUTs. A. Channel Modeling Channel modelling for EM-based underground communications
    dates back to the early 70’s of the 20th century. Wait and Fuller investigated
    the propagation of EM signals through the earth surface where the frequency range
    of 1 to 10 MHz was experimentally tested in different types of soil [33]. Their
    results suggest that at low frequencies of the EM spectrum, earth refractive index
    is large which simplifies the analysis. However, low frequencies suffer from limited
    bandwidth and low resolution for time of arrival pulses. Therefore, higher frequencies
    of the EM spectrum were tested in [33] which suffers from high attenuation but
    have a low dispersion. The authors in [34] further examined the impact of different
    layers of the soil on the propagation of EM signals where Fast Fourier Transform
    was used to find the reflection of the incident signals from a three-layered medium.
    Furthermore, Lytle measured the electrical characteristics of the earth medium
    for the propagation of underground EM signals [35]. The electrical characteristics
    of the earth, such as conductivity and dielectric constant have a deceitful effect
    on the propagation of EM signals. The values of conductivity and dielectric constant
    significantly influence the selection of antenna, size of the ground screen, transmission
    loss, phase shift, dispersion, and antenna efficiency. Therefore, conductivity
    and dielectric constant for various types of soils and rocks were experimentally
    measured in [35]. The authors in [36] experimentally measured the conductivity
    of the earth surface at EM frequencies of 3 to 50 MHz at Yosemite national park.
    William et al. measured high-frequency electromagnetic radiations in the borehole
    by neglecting the reflections and refractions from the subsurface [37]. The path
    loss model defined in [37] is given as P r P t = f(θ) G t A r exp −2αd 4π r 2
    , (1) View Source where P r and P t are the received and transmitted power, respectively,
    f(θ) is the effective elevation radiation pattern, G t is the gain of transmitting
    antenna, A r is the effective area of receiving antenna, α is the attenuation
    factor, and d is the distance between the transmitting and the receiving antenna.
    In [38], the authors examined EM waves for borehole communications where a data
    rate of 1 bps was achieved for average conductivity and without using the repeaters
    while with the use of repeaters, the data rate can reach up to 100 bps. In [39],
    the authors have shown the impact of soil properties, water content, network topology,
    and antenna type for the EM waves in the frequency range of 1 to 3 MHz for underground
    wireless sensor networks (UGWSNs). It was shown numerically in [39] that the path
    loss and attenuation increases with increase in the humidity and the operating
    frequency. Consequently, in [40], experiments were conducted in subsoil and topsoil
    at 300-500 MHz frequencies for buried sensors. Furthermore, attenuation of EM
    signal for measurement while drilling (MWD) telemetry system was investigated
    in [41] where the maximum transmission range of 15,000 feet was achieved without
    using repeaters. Based on the Friis free space path loss model, the authors in
    [42] provided the formula for the received power in the soil medium as P r (dB)=
    P t (dB)+ G t (dB)+ G r (dB)− L s (dB), (2) View Source where P t represents the
    transmit power, G t and G r are the transmit and receive antenna gains, respectively,
    and L s = L f + L u is the path loss in soil medium. L f and L u are the free
    space and underground path loss, respectively. Underground path loss L u is calculated
    by considering the EM waves propagation characteristics in soil, such as operating
    wavelength and frequency, scattering, and delay distortion. Hence, L u = L α +
    L β , where L α and L β are attenuations due to transmission loss and wavelength
    difference of EM signal in soil compared to air, respectively. Therefore, L s
    is represented in dB as follows L s =6.4+20log(d)+8.69αd+20log(β), (3) View Source
    where d is the Euclidean distance, α is the attenuation constant, and β is the
    phase shift constant. Both the attenuation and phase shift constants depend on
    the dielectric properties of the soil. The dielectric properties of the soil are
    calculated by using the Peplinski principle as follows [43]: ϵ s = ϵ r −j ϵ i
    , (4) View Source where ϵ s is the complex dielectric constant of soil and water
    mixture consisting of a real part ϵ r and an imaginary part ϵ i , respectively.
    The real part of ϵ s is given as ϵ r =1.15 (1+ ρ b ( ϵ α ¯ x ) ρ x + m β ¯ v ϵ
    α ¯ f − m v ) 1 α ¯ −0.68, (5) View Source where ρ b is the bulk density, ρ s
    =2.66 is density of solid soil, α ¯ =0.65 , m v is the water volume fraction,
    and β ¯ =1.2748−0.519S−0.152C is the empirically determined constants for soil
    type. The terms S and C represents mass fractions of sand and clay, respectively
    and their values lies between 0 and 1. The effective conductivity ϵ f in (5) is
    given as ϵ f = ϵ 0 − ϵ ∞ 1+(2πfτ ) 2 + ϵ ∞ , (6) View Source where ϵ 0 =80.1 is
    the static dielectric constant, ϵ ∞ =4.9 is the high frequency limit, τ is the
    relaxation time of water, and f is the operating frequency [44]. Similarly the
    imaginary part ϵ i =( m β ~ v ϵ α ¯ f ) 1 α ¯ , where β ~ =1.33797−0.603S−0.166C
    . Consequently, the attenuation constant α is given as α=2πf( μ ϵ r 2 ( 1+ ( ϵ
    i ϵ r ) 2 − − − − − − − − − √ −1)), (7) View Source where μ is the magnetic permeability.
    Similarly, the phase shift constant β is found as β=2πf( μ ϵ r 2 ( 1+ ( ϵ i ϵ
    r ) 2 − − − − − − − − − √ +1)). (8) View Source It is clear from the expression
    of both the attenuation and phase shift constants that the propagation loss of
    EM depends on the operating frequency, soil composition, water content, and bulk
    density. Furthermore, the authors in [42] have investigated the path loss in the
    presence of two paths between the transmitter and the receiver. The authors have
    neglected the second path effect in high depth scenarios due to no reflection
    from the ground surface while for low depth scenario two-path model was considered
    which is given in dB as follows: L t = L s − L v , (9) View Source where L v correspond
    to the second path loss, given as L 2 v = 1+(γ exp (−αΔ(r)) 2 )−2γ exp (−αΔ(r))
    cos(π−(ϕ− 2πΔ(r) λ )), (10) View Source where γ and ϕ are the amplitude and phase
    reflection coefficients, respectively, λ is the wavelength, and Δ(r)=r−d is the
    difference between the two paths. Based on the above channel model, the authors
    in [45] proposed a testbed for UGWSNs. The authors in [46] also compared the theoretical
    and measured results for UGWSNs where the above analytical model fits well within
    3.45 dBm of the measured data. In [19] EM waves in Terahertz band (0.1-120 THz)
    were investigated for oil reservoirs. The path loss (in dB) for EM signals in
    the Terahertz band is given in [19] as follows L tot = L sp + L w + L o , (11)
    View Source where L sp is the spreading loss, L w = k w (f)d is the absorption
    loss due to water, and L o = k o (f)d is the absorption loss due to oil. The spreading
    loss L sp = ( 4πfd c ) 2 , where d is the distance, f is the operating frequency,
    c is the speed of light, and k w (f),  k o (f) are the absorption coefficients
    of water and oil, respectively. Although the THz band provides high capacity for
    UGWSNs, their range is limited to few centimeters. Hence, the concept of low frequency
    (below 500 kHz) was introduced in [16]–[18] to achieve more considerable transmission
    distance (in tens of meters) for UGWSNs. The received power formula for the EM
    signals in [16]–[18] is given as P r =κ exp −2αd d 2 , (12) View Source where
    κ= A r cosθ 2η ( I μ 0 ω 4π ) 2 , θ is the phase angle, η is the intrinsic wave
    impedance, μ 0 is the permeability of air, ω is the angular frequency, and I is
    the current. The impact of the carrier frequency, transmission distance, depth,
    and modulation type was experimentally tested in [47]–[49] for UGWSNs. The optimum
    frequency range in 10-100 MHz was identified in [50] for energy harvesting in
    UGWSNs. To reduce the battery consumption and to improve the signal to noise ratio
    (SNR) at the receiver, a code division multiplexing scheme was proposed in [51].
    Consequently, the impact of soil type on multi-carrier modulation was examined
    in [52] which showed that the data rate of 124 Mbps is achievable for the transmission
    distance of 12 m for IoUT. In [53], the authors used pulse amplitude modulation,
    quadrature phase shift keying, m-ary quadrature amplitude modulation, and Gaussian
    minimum shift keying for IoUT. Moreover, it was shown in [53] that adaptive equalization
    improve the performance of the underground channel. Furthermore, the authors in
    [54] tested 97-130 MHz EM frequencies for underground radio propagation by using
    the same model in [42]; however, the error was almost 50% at such high frequencies.
    In [55], a real-time soil moisture sensing and permittivity estimation system
    called Di-Sense was proposed to implement IoUT for agricultural applications.
    Software defined radio-based experiments were conducted where the permittivity
    and soil moisture were calculated at a depth of 4 cm and horizontal distance of
    1 to 15 m, for the frequency range of 100-500 MHz. Recently, the authors in [56]
    investigated the soil effects, the orientation of the buried antenna, and depth
    on the underground to the above ground wireless communication link. The empirical
    path loss for underground to above ground link is given in logrithmic scale as
    follows [56] L ag =−147.6+20log d ag +20logf (13) View Source where d ag is the
    path length. Consequently, empirical studies were conducted in [57] by using the
    above model to show the propagation characteristics of the underground to above
    ground communication link at 2.4 GHz and 433 MHz, respectively. The emperical
    model in [42] and its variants are mostly employed in the literature for EM-based
    underground communication. However, these emperical models ignore the physical
    characteristics of subsurface EM field analysis. Therefore, recently in [58],
    the author proposed an analytical solution for EM-based underground communications
    which rely on the Maxwell-Poynting theory. The derived expressions in [58] relate
    the soil properties to the electromagnetic field of the buried dipole antenna.
    Table II summarizes the literature on channel modeling for EM-based IoUT. TABLE
    II Summary of Channel Modeling for EM-Based IoUT B. Networking The literature
    on channel model for EM-based IoUT is rich. However, few works exist on the routing
    protocols. In this section, we cover the existing research on networking layer
    protocols for EM-based IoUT. Fig. 2 and 3 show examples of a multi-hop network
    for an EM-based oil and gas IoUT and agricultural IoUT, respectively. Due to the
    limited transmission range of EM waves in the harsh underground environment multi-hop
    communication is well-suited. For example, the idea of dense sensor networks with
    multi-hop communication for oil and gas exploration was presented in [29]. Moreover,
    the authors in [59] developed a TCP/IP based simulator for the IoUT. Furthermore,
    they evaluated the performance of various multiple access schemes in [60]. The
    path connectivity problem for EM-based IoUT was investigated in [61] which showed
    that low volumetric water content and low operating frequency lead to a higher
    probability of connectivity. In [62], the throughput of EM-based IoUT was optimized
    to achieve the QoS requirement. Recently, the influence of soil texture, particle
    density, and bulk density on the hop count was examined for IoUT where the number
    of hops between a source and a sink increases with an increase in the water content
    and clay in the soil. A relay based approach with physical constraints on the
    relay location, propagation environment, and load balancing was examined in [63]
    to improve the lifetime of IoUT. Fig. 2. Network model for EM-based IoUT for oil
    and gas reservoirs. Show All Fig. 3. Network model for EM-based IoUT for agricultural
    applications. Show All SECTION III. Acoustic Waves for IoUT Most of the communication
    and detection techniques for underground measurements are based on acoustic waves.
    Geologists use acoustic waves to look for underground resources, such as oil and
    gas. Acoustic waves are transmitted into the ground, and the reflection is measured
    from the propagation of the acoustic waves. Moreover, acoustic waves are used
    in drilling to communicate with underground equipment. Major applications of acoustic
    waves-based IoUTs include smart seismic exploration, earthquake monitoring, buried
    pipeline monitoring, and smart drilling for oil and gas reservoirs. The research
    work on acoustic-based underground communications systems is rich and can support
    many other applications. Based on the signal generation, the acoustic-based methods
    can be broadly classified into passive and active type methods. In passive acoustic-based
    methods, the subsurface environment generates an acoustic signal caused by natural
    events, such as earthquakes, nuclear explosion, and volcanic explosions. In such
    circumstances, the sensors are placed in the vicinity of the event area. These
    sensors detect the infrasonic signals which help in the prediction of a natural
    disaster. Moreover, sudden changes underground, such as rock crack formation,
    structural transformation, and pipeline leakage can also be detected by using
    passive acoustic methods. In active acoustic-based methods, the signal is generated
    by an artificial explosion or vibration which is sent underground to estimate
    the properties of the earth’s subsurface (see Fig. 4). The popular application
    of such method is reflection-based seismology. Due to the low propagation speed
    of acoustic waves, they are mostly used for detection purposes in soil rather
    than for communication. In [11], the authors investigated the speed of sound in
    the soil. Acoustic signals were transmitted through different samples of soil
    and received by the hydrophones. The attenuation coefficients were calculated
    for the frequencies range from 2 to 6 kHz. The proposed empirical solution was
    able to detect an object buried at 40 cm. Similarly, in [64] and [65], soil moisture
    was measured by using the speed-moisture curves for underground acoustic signals
    transmission. Moreover, acoustic waves with a frequency of 900 Hz was used in
    [12] to estimate the moisture content of the soil. A universal soil loss equation
    was derived in [66] for acoustic waves propagation in soil at 16 kHz frequency.
    The soil loss factor due to the erosion is expressed in [66] as L e s =ρ e s τ
    c m ϱ , where ρ is the soil loss due to rain factor, e s is the soil erosion factor,
    τ is the topographic factor of soil, c m is the cover management, and ϱ is the
    support practices factor. Recently, the authors in [13] and [14] proposed an acoustic
    based wireless data transmission system (SoilComm) for IoUTs. SoilComm system
    was able to transmit the sensing data over 30 m distance through soil. Fig. 4.
    Architecture of an active acoustic-based IoUT for seismic monitoring. Show All
    In addition to the investigation of soil properties, acoustic waves are widely
    used for down-hole telemetry purposes. In acoustic telemetry, the steel walls
    of the drill-string are used as a source of a communication channel. Acoustic-based
    telemetry system consists of a piezoelectric-electric transmitter underground,
    repeater at 500-2000 m apart, and a transceiver at the ground surface. The down-hole
    transmitter encode the sensor’s data and convert it into the acoustic signal which
    then propagates to the surface by the drill string. The drill string consists
    of pass-bands and stop-bands in the channel. It was found in [15] that attenuation
    on the drill-string is in the range of 4 to 7 dB per 1000 feet. The expression
    for the capacity of the acoustic telemetry system was calculated in [15] as follows
    C a =∫ log 2 (1+ P s (f) P N d (f)+|H(f) | −2 P N s (f) )df (14) View Source where
    P s , P N s (f) and P N d (f) are the power spectra of the signals, surface noise
    and drilling noise, respectively. The transfer function for the acoustic channel
    is represented by H ( f ). Acoustic waves passing through the drill string are
    highly attenuated and therefore require a sufficient number of repeaters. Additionally,
    the drilling noise also affects the propagation of acoustic waves along the string.
    The authors in [15] were able to achieve the data rate of 20 bps at a depth of
    3695 feet. In [67], field tests were performed by using acoustic telemetry where
    data rates of 20, 40, and 60 bps were achieved at a depth of 1000 m. In [79] and
    [80], a testbed was developed to study the channel behavior for acoustic waves
    over the string pipes. The results in [79] and [80] have shown that acoustic waves
    suffer from noticeable dispersion and pipe strings act as a frequency selective
    channel. Authors in [70] also performed experiments by using acoustic waves for
    downhole communications where the data rate of 20 and 6 kbps were achieved for
    4.5 and 55 m depth, respectively. Acoustic waves were generated by using a magnetostrictive
    actuator which converts electrical signals into acoustic vibrations. The acoustic
    signals were then transmitted over the drill string to the bottom and received
    back at the surface by the geophones. For a frequency selective channel of the
    drill string, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) was used. The
    drill string was modeled as a series of alternating short and long resonators
    where each resonator is described by a scattering matrix S. The string is considered
    as a two port device where S 11 and S 22 represents the reflections while S 12
    and S 21 measure the transmission of the acoustic signal, respectively. The scattering
    parameters are obtained as [70] S 11 = S 22 = r ˙ (1− (1− r ˙ 2 ) exp −2jγℓ 1−
    r ˙ 2 exp −2jγ r ˙ ), (15) View Source and S 12 = S 21 =1− (1− r ˙ 2 ) exp −2jγℓ
    1− r ˙ 2 exp −2jγℓ , (16) View Source respectively. The terms ℓ and r ˙ represents
    the length of the segment and the reflection coefficient, respectively, while
    γ is the function of the attenuation coefficient α , frequency f , and velocity
    of the acoustic signal v as, γ= 2πf v −jα . Based on the sub-matrices of S, the
    T matrix is written as T= 1 S 12 [ S 12 S 21 − S 22 S 11 1 ]. (17) View Source
    The channel frequency response for the whole string is then calculated as T s
    = ∏ i=1 N T i (18) View Source where i=1,2,…,N is the number of segments of the
    drill string. Besides the modeling of drill pipe, arrangements of pipes also play
    an important role in acoustic communication during drilling. Hence, the authors
    in [81] argued that ascend-to-descend arrangement of pipes provide best telemetry
    performance for downhole acoustic communication. The problems of acoustic noise
    and attenuation of the acoustic signal due to the pipes joints were studied in
    [71]. The authors proposed a single carrier with frequency domain equalization
    (SC-FDE) to improve the reliability of the acoustic transmission along the pipe
    strings. The impact of multiphase flow was examined in [72] for downhole acoustic
    communication with amplitude shift keying and frequency shift keying modulation
    schemes. Moreover, the authors in [73] introduced the use of trellis coded modulation
    for downhole acoustic communication where a more realistic model of 1000 m depth
    was considered with an achievable data rate of up to 400 bps. Recently, non-contiguous
    OFDM with adaptive pilot design was used in [78] to provide data rate of up to
    500 bps at the depth of 53.76 m. The drill string was modeled to the schematic
    diagram shown in Fig. 5 where x is the transmitted signal, y is the received signal,
    H is the channel transfer function, n b is drill bit noise, n e is the environment
    noise, and n s is the surface noise. Then the received signal is written as y=Hx+H(
    n b + n e )+ n s =H(x+ n d )+ n s , (19) View Source where n d is the total transmitter
    noise. Least square estimation was used in [78] to estimate the acoustic channel
    characteristics along the drill string. Fig. 5. Equivalent transmission model
    of the drill string. Show All Moreover, in addition to the channel model for acoustic
    waves based underground communications, work on the transceivers design for such
    applications has also been an active area of research. For example, in [82], a
    novel receiving unit for acoustic communication along the drill string was proposed.
    Similarly, a tri-axial accelerometer was used in [77] to compare the single channel
    and multi-channel uphole acoustic communication in oil wells. Nevertheless, Gao
    et al. studied the transmission of acoustic waves along the drill strings for
    various applications [83]. Besides, the literature on transmission characteristics
    and transceiver design, studies on the characteristics of acoustic signals also
    exists for rock failure [69], cracks in pipelines [74]–[76], and landmines detection
    [68]. Table III summarizes the literature on acoustic-based IoUT. TABLE III Comparison
    of Acoustic Waves-Based IoUT SECTION IV. Mud Pulse Telemetry for IoUT The most
    common and mature method for downhole communication is mud pulse telemetry (MPT)
    which dates back to the mid of the 19th century. The early MPT systems were able
    to only communicate the azimuth and inclination information for the wells navigation.
    The main concept of MPT lies in the circulation of the mud for the transmission
    of the data [7]. During the drilling process, the pumps at the surface circulate
    the mud down to the drill string through the pressure pulses [84], [85]. The mud
    is used to cool the downhole drill string components, carry information from the
    bottom to the surface, and balance the pressure. The mud passes through a valve
    which restricts and generates the pressure waves. The pressure pulses are controlled
    and are used to modulate, frequency, amplitude, and phase of the mud pulse signals
    [86]. Three different types of mud pulse signals are transmitted; i.e., positive,
    negative, and continuous wave pulses as shown in Fig. 6 [87]. The signal processing
    modules at the surface recognize these pressure pulses. The pressure pulse signals
    in MPT systems are encoded by various techniques to carry the critical information,
    such as temperature, pressure, and conductivity etc. of the well. Table IV summarizes
    the literature on MPT systems based IoUT. Although the MPT systems are mature,
    the mud pulse signals suffers from several impairments which are discussed in
    the following subsections. TABLE IV Summary of the Literature on MPT Systems Fig.
    6. Three different types of MPT systems. (a) Positive pulses from blocking/unblocking
    of the fluid; (b) Negative pulses by pressure in the drill string; (c) Continuous
    pulses by using a rotor. Show All A. Mud Pump Noise During the down-link transmission
    of the mud pulse signal, the piston in the valve moves back and forth to generate
    the signal. At the same time the up-link signal is generated in the similar fashion
    in opposite direction resulting in the interference between the down-link and
    up-link signals [88]. Moreover, the pressure of the pump creates noticeable amount
    of frequency and amplitude varaitions in the frequency range of 1-20 Hz. To diminish
    these effects, MPT systems uses two different transducers at the surface receivers
    which are well spaced [89], [90]. In [91] and [92], the authors have used least
    mean square filtering algorithm to reduce the noise generated by the mud pumps.
    B. Attenuation and Dispersion As the mud pulse signals propagate along the borehole,
    the signals are attenuated and dispersed due to under-balanced drilling mud [93].
    The major sources of attenuation are the mud type, joints in the drill string,
    signal frequency, diameter of the string, and borehole depth [94]. Low frequency
    signals can be used to avoid excessive attenuation of the mud pulse signals [95].
    C. Rock Fragments and Gas Leakage During the drilling process, rock particles
    and gas may enter the mud used for the pressure pulses which changes the density
    and compressibility of the mud [96]. These rock particles and gas reduce the transmission
    speed of the pressure pulse waves. Hence, it is essential to study the velocity
    continuity of the drilling mud because the gas leakage into the mud can lead to
    unstable drilling which can cause environmental pollution and potential loss of
    human lives [97]. SECTION V. Magnetic Induction for IoUT One of the major factors
    which limit the evolution of IoUT is the challenging underground environment.
    We have previously discussed that the heterogeneous soil medium and water content
    of the soil limit the transmission range of EM-based IoUT [40]. Hence, magnetic
    induction (MI) has been introduced to overcome the limitations of EM waves for
    IoUT [21], [98]. In this section, we will cover multiple aspects of MI-based IoUT
    which include channel modeling, networking, and localization. A. Channel Modeling
    MI transceivers consist of induction coils which produce quasi-static magnetic
    fields that can be sensed by the nearby coil. Moreover, each coil is connected
    to a capacitor such that the coil operates at a resonance frequency. Unlike the
    small commercial near field communications (NFC) coils, moderate size of coils
    are preferable for IoUT to cover long transmission ranges (10-100 m). A time-varying
    magnetic field is used in MI-based IoUT for communication between a transmitting
    and a receiving node. The coil antenna of the transmitting node produces a time-varying
    magnetic field which induces the current at the coil antenna of the receiver.
    The design of a conventional MI-based transceiver is shown in Fig. 7 where d ij
    is the distance between the coil i and j , and r t i , r r j are their radiuses,
    respectively. The transmitting current I= I 0 e −jωt with direct current I 0 and
    angular frequency ω induces current in the nearby coil. However, if the transmitting
    and receiving coils are not well coupled, a single coil may not guarantee communication,
    and therefore a tri-directional coil structure was proposed in [99] for efficient
    MI communication (see Fig 8). Based on the MI phenomena, the link budget for MI-communication
    at high frequency and with a large number of turns in the transmitter coil N t
    is given in [21], [99]–[102] as P r j = ωμ P t i N r j r 3 t i r 3 r j sin 2 α
    ij 16 R 0 d 6 ij , (20) View Source where μ represents the permeability of the
    soil, P t i is the transmit power, N r j is the number of turns in the receiver
    coil, α ij is the angle between the axes of the two coils, and R 0 is the resistance
    of a unit length loop. Note that the path loss exponent for MI-based underground
    is channel is much higher than the free space path loss model. The authors in
    [99] experimentally validated the link budget expression in (20). Based on the
    above channel model, different modulation schemes, such as BPSK, QPSK, and QAM
    were proposed in [103] for MI-based underground communications. Consequently,
    a square wave with pulse width modulation was used in [104] to provide inductive
    power transfer and average data rate communication for MI-based IoUT. The expression
    for the magnetic field generated by a coil at distance d was given in [104] as
    B= μ 0 I r 2 n N t 2 ( d 2 + r 2 ) 3 2 (21) View Source where μ 0 is the permeability
    of free space, r is the radius of the coil, I is the current, and N t is the number
    of turns of the transmitting coil. At the receiver coil, the electromagnetic field
    is produced as E= N r AωBcosωt (22) View Source where N r is the number of turns
    of the receiving coil, A is the area of the coil, and t is the instantaneous time.
    Based on the electromagnetic field, the voltage V is measured as follows V= E
    R l 2 R l 2 +jωL+ Z r (23) View Source where R l 2 is the resistance of the receiving
    coil, L is the inductance, and Z r is the load resistance by connecting the parallel
    capacitance resistance and pre-amplifier circuit (see Fig. 9), i.e., Z r = R l
    1+jω C 2 R l . (24) View Source Substituting (22) into (23) yields the expression
    for the measured voltage as follows [105] V= N r AωB R l 2 R l 2 +jωL+ Z r (25)
    View Source Based on the above forumation, the authors in [105] obtained the following
    received power expression P r = V 2 0 k 2 F 2 1 F 2 2 R l 1 F 1 t (26) View Source
    where V 0 is the voltage source, k= M L 1 L 2 √ , F 1 = ω L 1 R l 1 + R s , F
    2 = ω L 2 R l 2 are the quality factors of transmitting and receiving coils, respectively,
    F 1 t is the instantaneous quality factor, M= μ 0 π N t N r r 4 2( d 2 + r 2 √
    ) 3 is the mutual induction, and R s is the source resistance. Authors in [105]
    were also able to determine the size of the antenna and the number of turns in
    the coil for MI-based low power and low-frequency underground communications.
    Furthermore, they studied the impact of soil conductivity σ , on the MI-based
    underground communication links [106]. Adding σ to the channel, modifies the mutual
    inductance M as follows M σ = μ 0 π N t N r r 4 2π d 3 exp −αd , (27) View Source
    where α= 1 πf μ 0 σ √ is the attenuation constant. In [107], the soil path attenuation
    model with the best operating frequency range identification was presented for
    MI-based IoUT. Also, multiple parallel receiver circuits were used in [107] to
    achieve higher voltage gain. A pulse power method (use of relay coils) was used
    in [108] to improve the transmission range of underground MI-based communications.
    The received power expression in [108] is derived from (26) and is given as P
    r = P t μ 0 N t N r r 3 t r 3 r 32π d 6 C 1 R 2 0 (28) View Source Recently, the
    authors in [109] suggested meta-material based MI coils for long-range subsurface
    communications. It was shown in [109] that using of meta-material coil provide
    better capacity for the same transmission distance. Authors in [110] and [111]
    evaluated the performance of IoUT for sandy and stone type of media where it was
    shown that the receiver sensitivity should be −70 dBm. Table V summarizes the
    literature on the various physical layer issues of MI-based IoUT. TABLE V Various
    Physical Layer Issues Addressed in the Literature for MI-Based IoUT Fig. 7. MI

    Equivalent circuit model for MI-based transmitter and receiver. Show All B. Networking
    The typical MI-based IoUT network consists of buried sensors (underground things)
    and aboveground equipment (surface things) as shown in Fig. 10. Hydraulic fracturing
    is used to inject the underground things into the well bottom or the reservoir
    [112], [113]. The surface things can provide extended MI communication link by
    using large dipole antennas and large transmission power [112]. Therefore, the
    downlink communication channel is assumed to be single hop while the up-link communication
    channel is multi-hop due to the limited transmission range of underground things
    [114]. The surface things can also work as anchors for the localization purpose.
    Fig. 10. Network model for MI-based IoUT for oil and gas reservoirs. Show All
    Although MI-based techniques address the issue of dynamic underground channel
    model, the transmission distance is lower for practical use. In practical applications,
    the transmission distance of MI-based IoUT is improved by using the relay coils
    [115]–[118]. In [115], optimal deployment strategies for both one-dimensional
    and two-dimensional MI-based waveguide was investigated. Additionally, optimal
    number of relay coils were calculated to minimize the deployment cost. Minimum
    spanning tree (MST) algorithm was used to minimize the number of relay coils.
    However, MST algorithm is not robust to the coil displacement and node failure.
    Therefore, Voronoi-Fermat (VF) algorithm was proposed to improve the robustness
    without increasing the deployment cost. Besides the use of relay coils, the authors
    in [116] suggested the use of superconductor and meta-materials, for the MI coil
    design to improve the transmission range. Authors in [117] used relays to reduce
    the path loss for MI-based underground communication. Similarly, meta-matrial
    shell was used for MI-based transceivers to improve their received power [118].
    In [119]–[121], the network capacity of a multi-hop MI-based IoUT was evaluated.
    Throughput of the bottleneck link which is related to the overall network capacity
    was investigated in [119]. The polarization of MI coils was exploited to reduce
    the interference and improve the network capacity. The channel capacity for any
    arbitrary link i was given in [119] as C i = ∫ +∞ −∞ log 2 (1+ P t i L i ⋅E{ P
    n } )df, (29) View Source where P t i is the transmit power, L i is the path loss,
    and E{ P n } is the total noise power spectral density. It was shown that the
    proper orientation of the coils significantly reduces the interference and improve
    the network capacity. Similarly, optimal system parameters and topology were proposed
    in [120] to avoid the bottlenecks in the network and to achieve higher throughput
    by using MI-based waveguides. Based on the above channel capacity, the throughput
    of link i was given in [120] as T i = C i N d i (1+ N in t i ) , (30) View Source
    where N d i is the number of data streams and N in t i is the number of interfering
    nodes. The results in [119] and [120] suggest that the use of relays and optimizing
    the orientation of the coils improve the throughput of a multi-hop MI-based IoUT
    network. Nevertheless, digital transmission schemes were introduced in [121] for
    both direct and multi-hop MI-based underground links. Frequency division multiplexing
    was suggested to equalize the long channel impulse response. Moreover, various
    modulation schemes, such as BPSK and QAM were investigated for multi-hop MI links,
    and it was suggested that higher order modulations could be avoided by using a
    bandwidth expansion mechanism. A distributed environment aware cross-layer protocol
    (DEAP) was proposed in [122] to satisfy the quality of service (QoS) requirement,
    achieve higher throughput, and reduce energy consumption. For a given MI-based
    underground link i−j , the DEAP protocol maximizes the QoS, Q ij , and minimizes
    the energy consumption, E ij =U( P ij R ij R c ij +2 E b ) , where P ij R ij R
    c ij is the distance-dependent energy required to transmit a single bit, and E
    b is the electrical circuit energy required for a single bit transmission. R ij
    is the transmission rate, R c ij is the channel coding rate, and U is the length
    of the packet. This is a minimization-maximization problem where energy needs
    to be minimized, and the QoS needs to be maximized. Therefore, a cross-layer optimization
    strategy was used to save the energy and improve the network throughput. A two-stage
    cross-layer protocol called Xlayer was proposed in [123] for multi-hop MI-based
    IoUT to guarantee the QoS requirement. Xlayer protocol was able to achieve high
    throughput, low delay, and low energy consumption. A full-duplex meta-material
    enabled MI-based communication was proposed in [124] to reduce the transmission
    delay for multi-hop underground communication. Recently, connectivity analysis
    for IoUT was provided in [125] where the probability of a connected network increases
    with an increase in the number of underground things and low volumetric water
    content. Additionally, the connectivity performance of the EM and MI-based IoUT
    network was compared where the results have shown that for low volumetric water
    content (VWC) of the soil (1%), the connectivity of EM and MI-based IoUT is similar.
    However, for the same node density when the VWC of the soil is increased to 5%,
    the EM-based network becomes unconnected while the MI still maintains the connectivity.
    Table VI presents the literature on various network layer issues for MI-based
    IoUT. TABLE VI Various Network Layer Issues Addressed in the Literature for MI-Based
    IoUT C. Localization Localization is an essential task in wireless networks which
    enable various location-based services. Hence, localization techniques for the
    terrestrial and underwater wireless communication networks are well investigated
    in the past. For example in [137] the authors reviewed various localization techniques
    for terrestrial wireless networks. Similarly, in [138] localization techniques
    for marine networks are studied. The localization techniques can be classified
    based on the ranging technique (range-based/range-free), type of computation (centralized/distributed),
    and space (2D/3D). However, the literature on localization techniques for the
    underground wireless networks is limited due to various challenges, such as harsh
    and light-less underground environment, non-availability of global positioning
    system (GPS) signals, high attenuation, and narrow operational area. Although
    efforts have been made in the past to develop localization techniques for harsh
    environments, such as indoor and underwater, however, the underground environment
    does not support the use of these communication technologies, and therefore the
    localization techniques for the indoor and marine environment cannot be directly
    applied to the underground case [23]. Accordingly, a two-dimensional (2D) localization
    technique was developed by Markham et al. [126] by using magnetic-induction to
    track animals underground. Furthermore, they extended their 2D tracking system
    to a three-dimensional (3D) one in [127]. Moreover, they used the 3D MI-based
    tracking model for underground rescue operations [128]. As the propagation of
    MI signals is highly affected by the soil medium, therefore, the impact of minerals
    and rocks on the localization accuracy was studied in [129]. It was observed in
    [129] that the skin effect of the underground medium is almost negligible at very
    low frequencies whereas the localization accuracy depends on the attenuation properties
    of various underground materials. Recently, simulated annealing wasn used for
    MI-based terrestrial and underground wireless networks in [130], [131] which can
    achieve sub-meter level accuracy. Furthermore, a modified semidefinite programming-based
    relaxation technique was used in [132] to determine the position of the underground
    sensors. A single anchor was used in [133] to find the location of all other underground
    sensors in 3D for MI-based IoUT. Trilateration, machine learning, and hybrid passive
    localization techniques were used in [134] to estimate the position of a target
    node in 2D MI-based IoUT. Recently, an analytical model has been presented in
    [135] for distance estimation in MI-based IoUT. The achievable accuracy of localization
    techniques is characterized by estimation bounds, such as the Cramer Rao lower
    bound (CRLB). In the past, CRLB have been derived for various wireless networks,
    such as Internet of things (IoT) [139], vehicular ad-hoc networks [140], source
    localization [141], radar tracking [142], cognitive radio networks [143]–[145],
    and underwater wireless networks [146]–[148]. Therefore, in [136], we derived
    the expression of the CRLB for the MI-based IoUT localization. The derived bound
    in [136] takes into account the channel and network parameters of MI-based IoUT.
    We consider a 3D oil and gas reservoir setup where the MI coils are injected to
    the reservoir by using hydraulic fracturing. We assume that the coils are uniformly
    distributed in a 15×15 m 2 fracturing area and the depth of fracture is 1.8 km.
    Additionally, the buried smart objects are able to communicate with the anchors
    on the surface in a multi-hop fashion [132]. Table VIII presents the simulation
    parameters which are mainly taken from [132]. TABLE VII Summary of the Literature
    on Localization for MI-Based IoUT TABLE VIII Simulation Parameters Fig. 11 shows
    the impact of the number of turns in the MI coil and the noise variance on the
    achievable accuracy. The values of the noise variance are kept as 0.05, 0.3, and
    0.7 m, respectively whereas the frequency is 13 MHz. Fig. 11 suggests that to
    get better localization accuracy more number of turns in the coil are required
    however increasing the number of turns may increase the size of the coil. However,
    the harsh underground environment requires a small size of the MI coil. Hence,
    the impact of coil size is examined in Fig. 12 which suggests that increasing
    the size of the coil improve the accuracy. Thus, there is a trade-off between
    the size of the coil and the localization accuracy which should be taken into
    account before the deployment. Fig. 11. CRLB vs. Number of turns in the receiver.
    Show All Fig. 12. CRLB vs. Coil size. Show All Moreover, we have also tested the
    impact of transmission power on the achievable localization accuracy in Fig. 13.
    Commercially available MI coils have transmission power in the range of 100-200
    mW (20-23 dBm). Thus we kept the transmit power in the range of 20-23 dBm with
    the variable size of the coils. Fig. 13 shows that with the increase in transmit
    power the achievable accuracy improves. Accordingly, the above results suggest
    that the achievable accuracy of any localization algorithm for MI-based IoUT is
    the function of the number of turns in the MI coil, noise variance, size of the
    coil, transmit power, frequency, and the number of anchors. Therefore, all these
    parameters are important to design a robust and accurate localization technique
    for IoUT. Fig. 13. CRLB vs. Transmit power. Show All D. Charging of the MI Coils
    Lifetime is an important parameter for IoUT due to the harsh underground environment.
    Therefore, research efforts have been made to improve the lifetime of the IoUT
    [149]. A charging method for IoUT has been proposed in [149] where a virtual magnetic
    relay network and optimized routing protocol was used to reduce the energy consumption.
    However, the charging efficiency of the proposed system in [149] remains very
    low for even moderate size of coils. Consequently, in [150] an optimized energy
    model framework was proposed for linear topology. The problem of charging underground
    coils is still open research problem and other options, such as energy harvesting
    can be investigated. SECTION VI. Wired Communications for IoUT Wireless communication
    channels reduce the complexity and cost of underground monitoring. However, existing
    wireless technologies fail to provide timely, reliable and accurate solutions,
    especially for the deep underground monitoring. Hence, wired technologies, such
    as coaxial cable and optical fiber are used for down-hole monitoring [8]–[10],
    [151], [152]. In 2003, Intelliserv provided a high speed down-hole telemetry system
    based on coaxial cable as an alternative to the low speed MPT and electromagnetic
    systems [153]. This system provided real time bi-directional communication at
    the data rate of 57,000 bits per second which has greatly enhanced the bandwidth
    for down-hole communication. Coaxial-based system consisted of inductive coils
    and repeaters along the high strength coaxial cable [9]. Similarly, a fiber optic-based
    temperate sensing system was developed in [10] to monitor the oil and gas reservoirs.
    The authors in [151] developed a down-hole communication system in the presence
    of high temperature and pressure. The proposed system in [151] was based on the
    SNR characterization of the whole channel where optimal frequency for the transmission
    is selected. Since for higher data rates, optical fiber has replaced co-axial
    based wired communication. In this section, we cover the literature on optical
    fiber-based communication systems for underground applications. Fiber optic sensing
    technologies have been applied to several commercial and industrial application
    in the past two decades. These sensing technologies can provide both sensing and
    information transfer in the harsh environment. Due to these attributes, they are
    well suited for the harsh environment in oil and gas reservoirs [154]. In [154],
    the authors discussed the deployment of underground fiber optic-based monitoring
    systems, including the assembly of down-hole sensors, data measurement, and installation
    of the sensors. The authors in [154] also briefly discussed about the installation
    of the pressure and temperature sensing system in a land well and in the Gulf
    of Mexico. It was concluded in [154] that fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors offer
    additional advantages, such as high flexibility, high stability, multi-point sensing,
    and their intrinsic nature to the fiber. The fiber optic based underground sensing
    system consists of FBG sensors which are connected to the optical fiber cable
    with the help of ultraviolet photo-inscription method [155] (see Fig. 14). Fig.
    14. Fiber optic monitoring system for IoUT. Show All The authors in [159] proposed
    a FBG based real-time temperature and fluid monitoring system of oil bore-holes.
    The FBG-based sensor converts the fluid pressure by means of a mechanical transducer
    into fiber optic strain. The strain of the transducer was given as [159] s= s
    l −λ( s r + s t ) E , (31) View Source where s l ,  s r ,  s t are the longitudinal,
    radial, and tangential stresses, respectively, λ is the Poisson number, and E
    is the Young’s modulus. Based on the inner and outer radii of the tube, a i and
    a o , the above expression is re-written as s= p a 2 i (1−2λ) E( a 2 o − a 2 i
    ) , (32) View Source where p is the pressure. In [156], Zhang et al. designed
    FBG based seismic geophone for oilfield exploration which showed better sensitivity
    than the conventional geophones for 10-70 Hz range of frequencies. Moreover, field
    tests were performed in [156] where the FBG-based seismic geophone was more immune
    to the EM interference, and had less non-linear distortion as compared to the
    conventional FBG sensors. Wavelength division multiplexing was used in [157] to
    combine the information from two fibers onto a single fiber for the temperature
    and pressure sensing in a well-bore. The simultaneous sensing of pressure and
    temperature, is a cost-effective solution. Experimental results were provided
    in [157] showing that the proposed multiplexed approach is stable and accurate.
    Recently, the authors in [158] installed an optical fiber-based down-hole monitoring
    system at the shoreline of Marmara sea in Turkey to provide geophysical observations.
    In short, optical fiber based underground monitoring systems provide high-speed
    communication and are immune to electromagnetic interference which mainly depends
    on the development of fiber grating sensors [160]. Table IX summarizes the major
    contributions on wired communications for IoUT. TABLE IX Summary of the Literature
    on Wired Communications for the IoUT SECTION VII. Visible Light Communications
    for IoUT Light cannot pass through soil therefore visible light communication
    (VLC) can only be used for down-hole monitoring in gas fields. To the best of
    the author’s knowledge, the only VLC-based down-hole monitoring systems were proposed
    in [22] and [161]. In [161], light emitting diodes (LEDs) were used at the bottom
    of the pipeline, and a single photon avalanche diode (SPAD) was used as a receiver
    at the surface (see Fig. 15). The proposed system in [161] was able to achieve
    the data rate of 1-5 kbps for the depth of 4000 m. An array of SPAD receivers
    were set at the surface of the pipe where the number of photons received were
    estimated as follows: N p = C e ∑ n=0 R (β+1)A P t 2π d 2 E p cos β (ϕ(n)) C p
    , (33) View Source where C e is the photon detection efficiency, A is the area
    of the SPAD, d is the distance, ϕ is the angle of radiation, P t is the average
    power of LED, E p is the energy per photon, R is the total number of reflections,
    C p is the reflectivity of pipe, and β= −ln(2) ln(cos(θ)) , where θ is the half
    power beamwidth. Modulation scheme of non-return-to-zero on-off keying (NRZ-OOK)
    was used where binary “1” is represented by a high positive voltage and binary
    “0” is represented by a low voltage. Poisson distribution was used in [161] to
    model the noise where the cumulative distribution function (CDF) is given as follows:
    P c (x,λ)= exp −λ ∑ i=0 x λ i i! , (34) View Source where λ is the mean value
    of the distribution. The probability of error is calculated from the above CDF
    as follows: P E = 1 2 [1− P c ( N t , N 0 )+ P c ( N t , N 1 )], (35) View Source
    where N t = N 0 + N 1 2 is the threshold value, N 0 is the average number of photons
    when binary “0” is transmitted, and N 1 is the average number of photons when
    binary “1” is transmitted. It was concluded in [161] that the BER improves with
    reducing the half power beamwidth angle and increasing the LED’s power. Nevertheless,
    the authors in [161] assume empty pipeline which is not realistic. Hence, in [22]
    the authors provided a channel model for VLC-based underground gas pipelines in
    the presence of methane gas. Ray tracing technique was used to model the channel.
    The channel impulse response (CIR) for the ray tracing technique is expressed
    as [22] h(t)= ∑ i=1 N r P i δ(t− τ i ) (36) View Source where N r is the number
    of rays, P i is the power from i -th ray, τ i is the propagation time of i -th
    ray, and δ(⋅) is Dirac delta function. By taking the Fourier transform of the
    CIR yields the frequency response of the optical channel as follows: H(f)=∫ ∑
    i=1 N r P i δ(t− τ i ) exp −j2πft dt (37) View Source Based on H ( f ), the frequency
    response is commonly modeled as H L (f)= 1 1+ jf f c , (38) View Source where
    f c is the cutt-off frequency. By taking into account the characteristics of LED,
    the effective channel response in frequency domain is expressed as H e (f)= H
    L (f)H(f) . Based on the expression of the channel response, the BER is given
    as BER= 2(M−1) M log 2 (M) Q( 1 M−1 ( P t h e r s ) 2 T s N o − − − − − − − −
    − − √ ), (39) View Source where M is the constellation size for M -ary PAM schemes,
    h e (t)= F −1 ( H e (f)) , P t is the average optical power transmitted, r s is
    the responsivity of photodetector, T s is the sampling interval, N o is noise
    power spectral density, and F −1 (⋅) is the inverse Fourier transform. Different
    pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) schemes were tested, and the results have shown
    that for a target BER of 10−6, 8-PAM can reach the target distance of 22 m. Similarly,
    higher order PAM provides a better data rate but reduced transmission range with
    a minimum of 3.82 m for 512-PAM. Nevertheless, the research on VLC-based IoUT
    is in its infancy and need to be examined in the future. Fig. 15. VLC based IoUT
    for gas pipelines. Show All SECTION VIII. Future Research Challenges The recent
    advances in IoUT have broadened the scope of this research area. Hence, in this
    section, we provide various new challenges for the IoUT. Table X presents the
    significance of each research challenge for a specific underground application.

    is a challenging issue [23]. Installation and management of smart objects underground
    are much more difficult compared to the terrestrial networks. Moreover, the underground
    objects can be easily damaged during the digging process. Hence, efficient deployment
    of the smart objects is required to minimize the installation cost of the IoUT.
    For example, a smart object with high energy requirement should be deployed near
    the surface for ease of management as the replacement of batteries in the underground
    environment is challenging. Moreover, to avoid the replacement of batteries, a
    battery with high capacity should be used, and power saving protocols should be
    applied. Deployment of underground objects is more challenging in case of seismic
    exploration and underground drilling as compared to the agriculture applications
    due to high depth. Hence, various efforts are made in the past based on different
    metrics and parameters for the optimal deployment of underground objects. For
    example, in MI-based IoUT, the orientations and polarization of the coils are
    managed to reduce the power reflections [115]. Similarly, horizontal and vertical
    deployment strategies were introduced in [119] to reduce the complexity of the
    network. Moreover, Voronoi tessellation was used in [120] to select the underground
    objects to be connected to the relay network. Besides, the effect of heterogeneous
    soil on the path loss also needs to be taken into account for the optimal deployment
    of underground objects. Unfortunately, the research work on the efficient deployment
    of IoUT is limited, which takes into account the various system and network parameters,
    such as deployment depth, number of smart objects, lifetime, and routing. B. Channel
    Modeling In terrestrial communications, the strength of the EM signal decays with
    the square of the distance while in the soil, the decay is much faster due to
    attenuation from the soil medium [40]. The major loss factors for a given frequency
    in the soil are the permittivity and conductivity of the type of soil. Hence,
    MI-based communication was introduced for the IoUT which is based on magnetic
    field propagation [99]. MI-based underground communications is also affected highly
    by the heterogeneous soil medium. However, most of the existing works assume homogeneous
    soil medium which is not realistic. In heterogeneous soil medium, the magnetic
    fields are attenuated differently at each layer of the soil. Therefore, the authors
    in [33] defined different scaling factors for various depths. Similarly, the signal
    propagation through the heterogenous medium was analyzed in [162] where the equivalent
    skin depth was calculated for each layer of soil. The path loss for a single link
    in MI-based underground communications is characterized in [101]. Moreover, asymmetric
    transceivers was introduced in [109] to provide long range underground communications
    in case of misalignment between the MI coils. Although the path loss for each
    type of communication channel has been extensively analyzed in the past, unfortunately,
    few efforts have been made to provide a fully functional wireless solution for
    IoUT with practical signal transmission schemes to verify the channel models.
    Nevertheless, the demanding applications of the underground stimulate the research
    in this direction. C. Limited Transmission Range The MI technology has certain
    advantages, such as prone to multi-path fading and boundary effects which makes
    it ideal for the communication and localization in the underground environment
    [99]. However, MI technology also has some disadvantages; the most significant
    one is the limited transmission range due to high path loss in the soil. Few efforts
    have been made in the past to improve the transmission range for MI-based underground
    communications. For example, the use of relay coils was proposed in [115] and
    [116] to extend the transmission range. Also, the use of superconductor and meta-materials
    was recommended in [116] and [118] to improve the transmission range of MI-coils.
    Besides that, large coils with high transmission power were used for the long-range
    downlink communication and localization in [132], however, it may not be a practical
    solution. Hence, the limited transmission range of buried smart objects in IoUT
    is still a significant issue which is still an open research problem. D. Low Latency
    and Reliable Communications Most of the applications of IoUT require low latency
    and reliable communication. For example, the underground things are deployed in
    the oil and gas wells to perform critical sensing tasks, such as temperature/pressure,
    pipe leaks and gas leaks, and therefore the data should be reliable and received
    at the surface with low latency. If the sensed data from even a single sensor
    is not received on time, it can lead to a disaster. As the performance of the
    IoUT is highly susceptible to the harsh underground environment, it can lead to
    unreliable and high latency communication. Although the requirement of low latency
    and reliable communication is essential for both terrestrial IoT and IoUT, it
    is important to note that the operating environment and regulations in underground
    are different than the conventional IoT networks. There is no single communication
    system which can meet all the requirements in the harsh underground medium. For
    example, the wired solutions can provide reliable and low latency underground
    communications, but they are not scalable, are complex, and have a high cost.
    On the other hand, the wireless solutions are scalable, have low complexity, and
    have low cost but are susceptible to the harsh underground environment. Hence,
    a reliable and low latency architecture is required for IoUT which can count for
    sensor failures and minimize the transmission delay. E. Security Although efforts
    have been made in the past to model the channel for IoUT [40], [99], unfortunately,
    security for IoUT did not get much attention from the research community. Security
    of IoUT includes the security of equipment and the communication protocols. Various
    attacks, such as node replication, signal jamming, and wormhole can be launched
    to destabilize the operation of the IoUT. The security breach can also exhaust
    the network resources by triggering false alarms and responding to false alarms.
    Various security issues for a cloud-based IoT are addressed in [163] where the
    issues of malicious attack, forward and backward security, node compromise attack,
    and semi-trusted cloud security are identified. Similarly, the authors in [164]
    provided efficient data tagging technique by using information flow control (IFC)
    that improves the security of the data. However, tagging of resource-constrained
    IoT devices is expensive. Moreover, the authors in [165] presented a secure architecture
    for IoT networks based on datagram transport layer security (DTLS) and host identity
    protocol (HIP). A detailed survey on security issues in IoT networks can be found
    in [166]. All of the above works are focused on security and privacy for terrestrial
    IoT networks that can be adapted for IoUT by adding the constraints of the underground
    environment. For instance, the older control and information systems for oil and
    gas fields are transforming into a digitized IoUT network. The security mechanisms
    are also needed to be updated because these systems were never designed to be
    globally connected. Hence, such systems can easily be targeted by the cyber-attacks,
    leading to a disaster. One solution for the security in IoUT networks is to investigate
    the blockchain technology, which can significantly reduce the possibility of cyber-attacks.
    The distributed ledger in blockchain can be an ideal solution to provide de-centralized
    security. F. Scalability Routing overhead, higher network density, and node failures
    can cause scalability issue for IoUT. Moreover, the high energy consumption and
    limited memory of underground sensor nodes limit the scalability of the network.
    Additionally, the IoUT system may consist of sensor nodes developed by different
    vendors which can lead to interoperability issues. Several works on scalability
    issue exist for various types of IoT networks. For example, in [167], the authors
    investigated the scalability issue in cellular networks for IoT devices by using
    spatiotemporal stochastic modeling. Similarly, structure-aware and self-adaptive
    wireless sensor network setup was proposed in [168] to address the scalability
    issue in a tunnel. Moreover, a middleware protocol was introduced in [168] to
    cope with the interoperability issue. The proposed protocol in [169] connects
    heterogeneous IoT devices. The above works address the issue of scalability and
    interoperability for terrestrial IoT networks. However, the harsh underground
    environment should be taken into account to modify these techniques for IoUT.
    For example, in the case of buried smart objects, the increased path loss of wireless
    communication signals in soil limits the connectivity of a large-scale IoUT network.
    In [170], the authors investigated the problem of scalability and lifetime maximization
    for agricultural IoUT where a mobile sink node was used to connect the sparsely
    deployed nodes, and energy harvesting was used to improve the network lifetime.
    Recently, a large-scale IoUT was implemented in [171], implementing a single-hop
    star topology which was able to support up to one million devices. Besides a few
    of the above solutions, IoUT requires the development of self-healing and self-organizing
    techniques to overcome the scalability issue. G. Robustness Robustness is another
    crucial issue for IoUT which has not been addressed in the past. In an underground
    resource-constrained environment where there are various challenges, such as dynamic
    topology, energy constraint, and sparsity of nodes, robustness is critical. In
    [172], the authors proposed a small world model to improve the robustness and
    latency of heterogeneous IoT network where the local importance of the smart object
    was taken into account. Robustness for terrestrial IoT networks is well-studied
    from different perspectives. For example, form localization aspect, detailed discussion
    about the robustness in terrestrail IoT can be found in [173]. The literature
    on robustness for underground networks is only limited to the mining application.
    For example, a robust mesh wireless network was proposed in [174] for underground
    mining which enhances both reactive and precautionary measures in safety and emergency
    situations. Since communication in IoUT networks suffers from an extremely harsh
    environment, it is challenging to develop robust communication and data gathering
    schemes. For example, the heterogeneous soil medium and water content of the soil
    limit the transmission range of electromagnetic waves. However, magnetic induction
    is more robust to the soil medium and water contents. Nevertheless, magnetic induction
    suffers from low transmission range and require perfect orientation between the
    coils. However, the research on using magnetic induction and its robustness for
    underground communications is still not mature and require further investigation.
    H. Hybrid Sensing A hybrid sensing system for IoUT integrates signals from multiple
    types of sensor systems for the detection and localization of an event. For example,
    a network of long-term underground fiber sensors can be fused with short-term
    ground penetrating radars for the detection and localization of an underground
    event. Another example of hybrid sensing network is SoilNet system proposed in
    [175]. In SoilNet, EM-waves based ZigBee network is used for above-ground communications
    and wired communication is used for underground links between the buried nodes.
    Similarly, hybrid EM and MI-based sensing network can be used where the EM can
    provide long-range down-link communication while short-range MI can be used to
    provide multi-hop uplink communication [132]. Hence, hybrid sensing technologies
    and new concepts, such as crowd-sensing can proactively detect and localize underground
    events, and improve the efficiency of IoUT. I. Software Defined Networking Although
    the research on IoUT is still in its infancy, researchers are already looking
    to develop networking solutions for the smart objects connected underground. Unlike
    conventional networking, software-defined networking (SDN) provide a scalable,
    secure, and reliable solution. Due to these advantages of SDN, it is used for
    underwater communications systems where the underwater sensors use in/out-band
    control channels to communicate with the surface station [176]. The surface station
    acts as an SDN controller to separate the data plane and the control plane. A
    similar approach can be used for IoUT, to provide an appropriate networking [177].
    By employing SDN for the IoUT reduces the network complexity, improve load balancing,
    provide congestion control, efficiently utilize the network resources, improve
    the network lifetime, and reduce the latency. For example, in IoUT networks for
    oil and gas reservoirs monitoring, SDN can provide a global network view of the
    underground smart objects enabling efficient management of the network. Besides,
    for large-scale IoUT networks in agricultural applications, SDN can provide a
    scalable network management solution. Moreover, data visualization tools such
    as multidimensional scaling [178] can be incorporated at the SDN controller to
    correlate the data from the smart objects. Hence with all these advantages, the
    SDN paradigm needs to be examined for the IoUT. J. Big Data IoUT is going to generate
    a large amount of exploration data which include data coming from various applications,
    such as agriculture, seismic surveying, and oil/gas fields. Hence this massive
    amount of data need to be organized for a proper analysis, a metric calculation,
    or an event correlation to make accurate decisions [179]. There has been a lot
    of research efforts made recently to integrate IoT and big data for conventional
    IoT networks. For example, Atzori et al. presented an overview of enabling technologies
    and potential applications of big data for IoT networks [180]. Similarly, context-aware
    computing and its usage for IoT was discussed in [181] and the references therein.
    These works motivate the use of big data analytics including descriptive, predictive
    and prescriptive analysis for underground applications as well. For example, in
    oil and gas IoUT networks, a large amount of exploration data is generated where
    managing such a massive amount of data is of major concern to the oil and gas
    industry. It is reported in [182] that the Geoscientists spent half of their time
    in managing and processing the collected data. Big data can be used to handle
    this massive amount of data and conduct various analysis such as scheduling and
    drilling. In short, proper data analytics tools need to be developed to support
    the large amount of data produced in IoUT. K. Cloud and Fog Computing The real-time
    and localized operations can be enabled for IoUT by integrating it with cloud
    and fog computing. Moreover, cloud/fog computing can provide various services
    for IoUT, such as scalability, location awareness, low latency, and mobility.
    In the recent past cloud computing has been used to provide maintenance for the
    oil and gas industries while fog computing has been used to reduce the data traffic
    and provide the analysis of the data at the network edge [183]. Also, analysis
    of a large amount of data generated in oil and gas industries is a big challenge;
    especially, in upstream where data-rich operations occur, e.g., real-time drilling,
    seismic exploration, and integrated processes. Hence, fog computing can provide
    localized real-time analytics of the data avoiding the communication delays and
    ensure a faster reaction to an event. Also, it can execute the drilling operations
    in a closed loop from a remote side by supervising through a cloud application.
    Hence, in time-critical applications by the time the data reach to the cloud for
    analysis, the opportunity to make a decision might be gone. Therefore, fog computing
    techniques should be integrated with the IoUT to support the in-time decision.
    L. Robust and Accurate Localization Methods Localization for IoUT enables numerous
    applications, such as geo-tagged sensing data, monitoring of the underground environment,
    and optimized fracturing. Few efforts have been made in the past to find the location
    of buried underground objects for MI-based IoUT. For example, in [127], a testbed
    was developed based on MI communication to track the underground objects. Moreover,
    the impact of mineral and rocks on the localization accuracy was investigated
    in [129]. Similarly, a semi-definite programming-based localization technique
    was developed in [132] for MI-based underground sensor networks. Nevertheless,
    the achievable accuracy for MI-based underground networks was investigated in
    [136]. All of these works are focused on MI-based communications where the work
    on EM, acoustic, and VLC do not exist. Therefore, robust and accurate three-dimensional
    methods need to be investigated based on each technology to enable the applications
    as mentioned earlier. SECTION IX. Summary and Conclusion In this article, we have
    surveyed various communication, networking, and localization techniques for the
    Internet of underground things (IoUT). In Section II, we have presented the literature
    on EM waves-based IoUT where we have briefly discussed the channel model and networking
    solutions. The primary applications of EM waves based IoUT are in agriculture
    due to their low penetration depth in the soil. In Section III, acoustic waves-based
    solutions are presented for underground communications. Due to their low frequency,
    acoustic waves are mostly used for seismic exploration and down-hole communication
    during drilling. We have gathered the acoustic-based underground communication
    techniques in Tables III and IV, where we have briefly stated their applications.
    Nevertheless, in Section IV we have presented a well-known mud pulse telemetry
    system which is commercially used for down-hole communication but suffers from
    various impediments, such as attenuation, dispersion, mud pump noise, and gas
    leakage. Furthermore, the most recent technology for IoUT, i.e., magnetic induction
    is presented in Section V and various issues addressed in literature are stated
    in Tables V and VI. Moreover, high speed wired solutions, such as coaxial cable
    and optical fiber for the IoUT are presented in Section VI. In Section VIII, visible
    light communication-based IoUT are briefly discussed which did not get much attention
    of the researchers yet. Finally, we have presented various future research challenges
    which can be investigated by the researchers. In short, the research on communication,
    networking, and localization for IoUT still have a long way to go and require
    the attention of both academia and industry. Authors Figures References Citations

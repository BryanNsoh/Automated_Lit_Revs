    and environmental impact in the agrifood sector, this study explores the integration
    of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies with IOTA’s Tangle, a Distributed Ledger

    agricultural practices. Keywords: agrifood sector; internet of things (IoT); distributed
    ledger technologies (DLT); IOTA tangle; rice cultivation; sustainability; real-time
    data recording; environmental footprint 1. Introduction The agrifood sector, a
    cornerstone of the global economy, sustains billions by providing food and livelihoods.
    Yet, it grapples with multifaceted challenges, from climate change and environmental
    degradation to population growth, food security, and consumer trust. Addressing
    these requires sustainable, efficient agricultural practices that optimize resource
    use, curtail waste, and elevate productivity and quality. The Internet of Things
    (IoT) is emerging at the forefront of solutions. This network of interconnected
    devices, equipped with sensors, actuators, and communication protocols, offers
    real-time monitoring and control over parameters like crop growth, soil health,
    water consumption, pest management, and greenhouse gas emissions. Beyond monitoring,
    IoT enhances traceability and transparency throughout the food supply chain, bolstering
    food safety and consumer trust. However, the integration of IoT in agriculture
    is not without challenges, especially concerning data management: Data Security:
    Ensuring data integrity and safeguarding against malicious tampering is paramount.
    Data Privacy: Stakeholders’ rights and preferences necessitate stringent measures
    against unauthorized data access or disclosure. Data Scalability: As farms grow
    and technology adoption surges, systems must accommodate an increasing influx
    of data from sensors and devices. Data Interoperability: Seamless data exchange
    is crucial, especially when devices and systems employ diverse formats and standards.
    Data Cost: Efficient data transmission and storage are vital, particularly for
    frequent or low-value transactions. Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) and
    the IoT can address these challenges by offering a decentralized, immutable, and
    transparent platform for data management. However, while the blockchain, i.e.,
    the most widely used form of DLT, has revolutionized data storage through cryptographically
    linked blocks, it is necessary to address scalability, transaction fees, energy
    consumption, and more limitations in the data-intensive IoT universe. IOTA offers
    a fresh perspective on DLT with its Tangle, a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure.
    Unlike blockchains, the Tangle permits feeless transactions, validated by nodes
    as they initiate new transactions [1,2]. This structure provides enhanced scalability,
    reduced energy consumption, quantum resistance, and the capability for offline
    transactions and microtransactions. Rather than replacing traditional blockchain
    systems, IOTA complements them, especially for the high-frequency data transactions
    inherent to the IoT. With projections indicating that, by 2030, approximately
    125 billion IoT devices will be interconnected [3], the sheer volume of data generated
    necessitates robust management, distribution, and storage solutions. While DLT
    offers a promising avenue, our study narrows its focus on IOTA’s Tangle, a DLT
    uniquely equipped to handle the vast data streams from IoT devices, given its
    scalable, fast, and feeless micro-data transaction capabilities. With this backdrop,
    our central research inquiry is both theoretical and pragmatic: Is it possible
    to devise a web application that seamlessly integrates Tangle IOTA with IoT-enabled
    sensors? These sensors, designed for monitoring sustainability metrics in agriculture,
    would empower operators in the agrifood sector with real-time insights, enabling
    timely interventions. To explore this, we have embarked on a Proof-of-Concept
    test focusing on data from rice cultivation. Our Proof-of-Concept focuses on rice
    cultivation, chosen due to its significant freshwater usage, which is the highest
    among all crops. Additionally, rice’s global prevalence and status as the world’s
    primary food crop make it a pertinent subject for our study [4]. We developed
    an analytical dashboard to demonstrate that using technologies such as IoT and
    IOTA optimizes product quality, product processing efficiency, cost, and production
    time. In summary, when we fully control production with devices and sensors (IoT),
    receiving data even from remote locations with the support of IOTA, it is possible
    to reduce the release of CO 2 by having control over irrigation and the right
    portion of water (more water equals more CO 2 and more waste). In addition, it
    is possible to track the product 24 h a day, receiving recorded data on IOTA almost
    through streaming. Finally, the process is very green, reducing electricity consumption.
    2. Background and Related Works In this section, we first provide a general background
    on distributed ledger technology (DLT), including both blockchains and tangles
    like IOTA. Then, we discuss related work on (i) traditional monitoring systems
    in agriculture, (ii) the use of the blockchain applied to agriculture, and (iii)
    the use of IOTA Tangle technology applied to agriculture. 2.1. Background DLT
    has become a transformative force in information technology, reshaping organizational
    collaboration and operation [5,6]. It employs a ledger system where multiple nodes
    can read and write data, maintaining a state based on consensus, which varies
    with the network’s decentralization level. DLTs are characterized mainly by their
    ledger structure: chain-based systems like blockchain and DAG-based systems like
    IOTA’s Tangle. Chain-based DLTs utilize a linear series of blocks, securing records
    through cryptographic hashing and consensus mechanisms like proof of work or stake.
    These blockchains differ in their access protocols and validator addition methods,
    affecting interaction levels with network components. In contrast, DAG-based DLTs
    allow parallel transaction processing, offering potentially higher scalability
    than chain-based systems. With independent transaction confirmation and no need
    for a single global consensus, DAG structures provide a more dynamic and scalable
    consensus approach. This contrasts with chain-based systems, where all transactions
    require network-wide confirmation, leading to potential bottlenecks in transaction
    processing and scalability. 2.2. Related Work 2.2.1. Traditional Monitoring Systems
    in Agriculture Historically, agricultural monitoring has evolved through various
    traditional systems. Key studies in this field have explored different approaches:
    Wang et al. developed a low-cost, real-time remote environmental monitoring system
    combining wireless equipment and mobile phones that was powered by solar energy.
    This system was effective in collecting real-time information and fulfilling online
    acquisition needs [7]. Dan et al. implemented a Greenhouse Environment Monitoring
    System using ZigBee technology, wireless sensors, and control nodes. This system
    focused on controlling environmental data for enhanced greenhouse management [8].
    Hashim et al. reviewed using an Arduino device for temperature and soil moisture
    control, managed via an Android smartphone. This study contributed to designing
    smart monitoring systems using an embedded micro-web server and IP connectivity,
    aiming to aid the agriculture sector in achieving quality production [9]. Karim
    et al. developed an application for precision farming based on a wireless sensor
    network and IoT cloud. This application focused on optimizing irrigation and monitoring
    microclimatic conditions to improve water usage efficiency in farming [10]. 2.2.2.
    Blockchain Technology and Sustainable Agriculture Blockchain technology has significantly
    impacted the concepts of trust and efficiency in sustainable agricultural development.
    This change became prominent as agrifood companies accessed knowledge banks and
    digital resources [11]. Blockchain, alongside the Internet of Things (IoT), is
    pivotal in advancing sustainable and precision agriculture, which leverages technology
    to enhance agricultural efficiency [12]. Lin et al. proposed an ICT e-agriculture
    system model based on the blockchain for local and regional use. They also developed
    a validation tool for the technical and social requirements of these systems [11].
    Patil et al. focused on using IoT for remote monitoring and automation in agriculture.
    They provided an architecture integrating blockchain technology for smart greenhouse
    farms, offering a security framework that combines blockchain with IoT devices
    for enhanced security and communication in smart farming [13]. Munir et al. implemented
    an intelligent Smart Watering System (SWS) based on an Android application for
    smart water consumption in crops. The system, equipped with affordable sensors,
    uses blockchain and Fuzzy Logic approaches for data security and intelligent decision-making,
    enabling real-time monitoring and periodic irrigation [14]. Baralla et al. developed
    a blockchain-oriented platform to authenticate food origin data. This platform
    aims to enhance supply chain transparency, promote local smart food tourism, and
    boost local economies, emphasizing the importance of food as a “business card”
    for tourist sites [15]. Iqbal and Butt proposed an IoT-based system for crop protection
    at all stages, focusing on deterring animal attacks using sensors and a Repelling
    and Notifying System (RNS). The system records incidents in a centralized Farm
    Management System (FMS), integrated with an agricultural blockchain for shared
    ledger functionalities, enhancing meta-information sharing [12]. Cocco et al.
    implemented a system offering visibility to food processes and certifications,
    using Self Sovereign Identity, blockchain, and the InterPlanetary File System.
    This system aims to safeguard data storage and access, ensuring the eligibility,
    transparency, and traceability of certifications [16]. 2.2.3. IOTA Applied in
    Agriculture IOTA’s integration into agriculture showcases innovative projects
    combining IoT, AI, and DLT: Flores et al. developed the Interplanetary Precision
    Agriculture (IPA) project, which harnesses IoT, AI, and DLT. The project utilizes
    various technologies, including an autonomous rover (Magrito) for crop performance
    data, Precision Habitat PRO for environmental control, a bluetooth scale for weight
    data, and a farm management system for data aggregation. The collected data are
    sent to the IOTA Tangle network to ensure immutability and interoperability. This
    aims to enhance cultivation processes both on Earth and in extraterrestrial environments,
    addressing issues of centralization and data silos in supply chains. The overarching
    goal is to establish a sustainable food supply and minimize the environmental
    footprint of agricultural practices [17]. Lamtzidis et al. introduced a distributed
    ledger-based system focused on securing IoT data integrity. They utilized IOTA’s
    Tangle ledger for the secure processing and storage of aggregated field data,
    transitioning from a cloud-centric to a node-centric architecture. In this setup,
    each Super node maintains its data in a distributed and decentralized database,
    with the backend functioning as both a data consumer and resource provider. This
    modular approach has made significant contributions to open-source communities
    in blockchain and IoT, presenting a more secure and decentralized method for managing
    IoT data [18]. 3. Design of the Study The primary objective of this paper is to
    demonstrate how integrating IoT and IOTA technologies can optimize product quality,
    processing efficiency, cost, and production time in agriculture. By utilizing
    IoT devices and sensors, and leveraging IOTA for data management, we aim to achieve
    significant reductions in CO 2 emissions through precise irrigation control and
    water management. This approach also allows for continuous product tracking and
    reduces electricity consumption, contributing to a more sustainable agricultural
    process. Our methodology involves creating a prototype that simulates a rice production
    process. This setup includes seedlings equipped with sensors to monitor and regulate
    water levels within a specified range. This prototype demonstrates efficient data
    transmission, production control, and system functionality. The study heavily
    focuses on the impact of IoT in agriculture. IoT technology, encompassing remote
    sensors, cloud and edge computing, unmanned vehicles, and data analytics [19],
    is revolutionizing agricultural practices. It allows for effective monitoring
    of crucial factors like humidity, air temperature, and soil quality, thus enhancing
    crop yields, irrigation efficiency, and accurate harvest forecasting (https://www.appsforagri.com/en/news/impact-of-iot-in-the-agriculture/,
    accessed on 7 October 2023). Moreover, the IoT’s integration into agriculture
    significantly reduces environmental impacts by lowering water and energy usage,
    greenhouse gas emissions, and fertilizer runoff. Financially, it increases farmers’
    profitability and competitiveness by opening up new markets and services [20].
    This study extends the IoT’s capabilities in agriculture by incorporating IOTA’s
    DLT, which is particularly suited for high-frequency IoT scenarios. IOTA offers
    benefits such as feeless transactions, data integrity, scalability, and interoperability,
    making it ideal for a secure and transparent network of IoT devices in the agricultural
    sector. Our methodology places a strong emphasis on optimizing resource utilization,
    with a particular focus on water efficiency. By integrating IOTA’s advanced DLT
    capabilities with intelligent irrigation systems, we aim to significantly enhance
    the precision and effectiveness of water usage in agriculture. Drawing insights
    from Mboyerwa et al.’s [21] research, this integration is expected to drastically
    reduce resource consumption. Notably, it can lead to halving water usage, decreasing
    nitrogen consumption by 25%, and reducing methane emissions by 50% to 70%. These
    substantial reductions are primarily achieved through the optimized control of
    field flooding durations, which effectively slows down the activity of methane-producing
    microorganisms. The integration of IOTA plays a critical role in this process.
    Its technology enables a secure, transparent, and highly efficient network of
    IoT devices. This network facilitates the real-time collection, processing, and
    analysis of vast amounts of agricultural data. Consequently, it allows for more
    precise irrigation decisions, ensuring water is used more effectively and sustainably.
    The real-time data processing and feeless transactions offered by IOTA enhance
    the system’s responsiveness and accuracy, leading to a more intelligent and environmentally
    friendly approach to irrigation. This not only optimizes resource usage but also
    contributes to the broader goals of sustainable and precision agriculture. The
    study employs a multi-faceted technological approach, simulating a data-intensive
    paddy farm environment. By integrating IOTA, we enhance data management, introduce
    robust authorization systems, and streamline data transmission. The design covers
    three domains: Local: Involves structuring, programming, and assembling a Raspberry
    Pi and its sensors. Remote: Facilitates internet connectivity and links to an
    online platform. Cloud-based server: Serves as the primary project hub. Technologically,
    the study utilizes Raspberry Pi devices and sensors, EMQX (MQTT), VPN and Ubuntu,
    Docker, IOTA, and MongoDB (ATLAS). The programming spans across Python, NodeJs,
    Javascript, HTML, and CSS. 3.1. IOTA IOTA stands out as a pioneering DLT tailored
    for the IoT landscape. Distinct from conventional blockchain systems, IOTA employs
    the Tangle, a unique architecture that addresses the scalability and transaction
    cost challenges inherent to blockchains. It positions IOTA as an optimal choice
    for the real-time processing of vast data streams from IoT sensors in sustainable
    agriculture. The IOTA network is underpinned by nodes’ individual instances of
    the IOTA software. These nodes validate and record transactions, and in the context
    of sustainable agriculture, they could process data received from IoT sensors,
    monitoring parameters like soil moisture, temperature, and pH levels. To ensure
    efficient operation, nodes had to use a robust but affordable environment with
    at least a 4-core processor, 8GB RAM, SSD storage, and a public IP address. Each
    node offers different features across multiple ports, facilitating peer-to-peer
    communication with HTTP and MQTT protocol, allowing for resilient data communication
    in every agricultural scenario. IOTA nodes can manifest as Mainnet, Testnet, or
    Devnet nodes. While Mainnet nodes handle real-world IOTA transactions, including
    actual sensor data, Testnet and Devnet nodes serve developmental and testing purposes,
    enabling developers to refine applications before Mainnet deployment. There are
    two primary IOTA node software options: Hornet and Bee. Hornet, crafted in Go,
    is resource-efficient, aligning with IoT applications where resources might be
    limited. Conversely, Bee, developed in Rust, emphasizes modularity and performance.
    Given its resource efficiency, Hornet is preferred for most agricultural IoT scenarios.
    Hornet’s implementation can leverage various avenues, including APT Repository,
    Docker image, binary files, or source construction. The Docker image, renowned
    for its portability, is particularly favored. The ability of Docker to effortlessly
    deploy and scale applications aligns with agricultural contexts, where the number
    of IoT sensors can fluctuate based on farm dimensions and requirements. Node security
    is paramount, necessitating measures like safeguarding login accounts, sealing
    unused ports, disabling remote consensus algorithm execution, and deploying a
    reverse proxy for augmented security. The Docker image gohornet/hornet (https://hub.docker.com/r/iotaledger/hornet,
    accessed on 7 October 2023) is utilized for Hornet implementation, with the repository
    cloned locally. Configuration files (i.e., config.json and peering.json) facilitate
    settings customization and node synchronization storage. The database of IOTA
    mandates a mainnetdb folder creation, with the use of authentication hashes ensuring
    data access exclusivity. The Docker image also initiates a server, loading a dashboard
    for node and data monitoring essential for overseeing and troubleshooting the
    IoT sensor network in agriculture. 3.2. Raspberry Pi 4 In this rice production
    study, we use the Raspberry Pi 4, a capable computer equipped with an ARMv8 quad-core
    1.5 GHz 64-bit CPU, dual-band wireless LAN, Bluetooth 5.0, and 1-2-4 GB RAM. It
    offers a GPIO port with 40 pins, 26 being GPIO pins, and various ports like USB,
    micro-HDMI, Ethernet, and more, including support for 4K video. The GPIO socket
    includes 40 pins, bridging the Raspberry Pi and external devices, where 26 of
    these are GPIO pins; the rest are power or ground pins. They are labeled in both
    physical and BCM numbering for convenience. Raspbian, a version of Linux designed
    for Raspberry Pi, serves as the operating system. It is installed via NOOBS, with
    a browser, email program, LibreOffice, Minecraft, and a command-line tool (raspi-config)
    for configuration management. Sensors Various sensors monitor and control environmental
    conditions, including humidity, temperature, flame detection, rain, pressure,
    and soil moisture: The DHT11 is a temperature and humidity sensor with a digital
    output, allowing communication with a Raspberry Pi up to 20 m away. It provides
    stable measurements with a maximum temperature accuracy variation of 2 °C and
    humidity accuracy variation of 1 percent. The flame detection sensor can detect
    infrared emissions from a flame and convert them into an electrical signal readable
    by any microcontroller. It has a reading angle 60° and features both an analog
    and a digital output. The rain sensor detects the presence and concentration of
    water. An LED indicates its operation and features with an analog output to calculate
    the amount of water present. The pressure sensor measures atmospheric pressure,
    temperature, and altitude. It can measure an atmospheric pressure level ranging
    from 300 to 1100 hPa and a temperature range from −40 °C to +85 °C. The soil moisture
    sensor detects soil moisture and the presence or absence of water. It has a digital
    output that indicates the level of humidity. This study uses two such sensors
    to monitor the optimal water levels for rice field irrigation. The first sensor
    measures the minimum water level needed for healthy rice growth, while the second
    sensor identifies the maximum water level to prevent wastage and crop damage.
    3.3. Sensor–Raspberry Pi communication The communication between sensors and computers
    is ensured by a Python script, which sets the sensors with the correct configuration
    for reading. It cyclically checks each sensor, recalling its state or value and
    storing the results in temporary variables. These variables are part of a JSON-like
    object that requires further conversion to become a standard JSON object. The
    script establishes a remote connection on the EMQX API, an MQTT web tool, and
    proceeds with publishing through the publish function. Since Python lacks the
    module allowing Raspberry Pi to communicate with the web tool, it must be installed
    and imported. To avoid saturating the Raspberry Pi’s resources, time intervals
    are established between the data acquisition of one sensor and the next. A pause
    of 2 s has been set before another sensor is analyzed to minimize data and information
    loss. The dialogue between the two technologies is summarized in Figure 1. Figure
    1. Sensor–Raspberry Pi communication. 3.4. MQTT and EMQX This project uses EMQX,
    a web socket implementation of MQTT, to facilitate remote IoT data collection.
    EMQX is an open-source MQTT IoT message broker built on the Erlang/OTP platform,
    renowned for its soft real-time capabilities, low latency, and distributed development
    features. MQTT is a lightweight message exchange protocol centered around a publication–subscription
    model. EMQX is accessible via browser and is designed for mass client access,
    providing fast and low-latency message routing between large physical network
    devices. It can host large-scale MQTT client connections, with a single server
    node supporting 2 million connections. It is also extensible, supporting custom
    plug-ins for authentication and other features. It fully supports IoT protocols,
    including MQTT, MQTT-SN, soap, LwM2M, and other proprietary TCP/UDP-based protocols.
    The connection configuration is used to set up links through any API that will
    serve as a bridge to dialogue your code with the MQTT platform. Required fields
    for EMQX connection configuration encompass “Name”, “Client ID”, “Host”, and the
    listening port. EMQX Broker provides many configuration elements and supports
    global and local configurations, allowing multi-protocol and port utilization.
    Auto Reconnect and Clean session functions are used to perform automatic reconnection
    when the broker goes offline and to start a session after a disconnection. The
    project creates various “topics” or subjects by creating a new subscription. The
    Topic must have a title and a subtitle, which are necessary if there is a need
    to filter the data. They are used to categorize the topic according to the path
    to which it belongs. This logic is useful when you want to retrieve information
    to access it; you need to know and refer to the precise path, otherwise, you cannot
    link to the topic. Data simulation within the project is accomplished with data
    input in JSON or TXT format allowing for textual data and key-value schema object
    notation. JSON data were sent via the Raspberry device at 2-s intervals, and it
    is possible to say that no visible latency or message loss was encountered. Figure
    2 displays the most important functionalities of this tool. Through the functionality
    called “New Connection”, it is possible to create a new mandatory initial connection
    or it can be used to create additional parallel connections, leading to Step 2,
    i.e., the connection configuration. This part will also serve as a setting for
    the links through any API that will serve as a bridge to dialogue your code with
    the MQTT platform. Figure 2. EMQX: MQTT Websocket Toolkit. In detail, Table 1
    shows the port numbers devoted to exposing services, dealing with sockets, the
    default WS (web socket) or WSS (web socket secured with SSL). The latter is a
    security protocol based on modern public key cryptographic algorithms, i.e., TLS/SSL.
    It can ensure transmission security in the computer communication network, providing
    the benefits of strong certification, thus ensuring confidentiality and completeness.
    Table 1. Protocol port. 3.5. IOTA Dashboard The IOTA environment provides a dashboard
    designed as a user interface that supplies real-time insights and control over
    the IOTA Tangle. In sustainable rice cultivation, IoT devices can be deployed
    across rice fields to monitor various parameters such as soil moisture, temperature,
    pH level, and more. These devices can transmit data to the IOTA Tangle, which
    can be accessed and analyzed in real-time through the IOTA dashboard. The IOTA
    dashboard enables one to view the IOTA DLT state. In detail, it provides an Analytics
    tab, which makes available parameters about the node, network, and resources,
    including information about the Tangle network, node details, memory usage, and
    cache data. Moreover, users can search for messages sent to the node, for instance,
    measurement from the IoT devices deployed in the rice fields monitoring by using
    the Explorer tab. In addition, the IOTA dashboard comes with a Visualizer tab
    responsible for providing a visual representation of the live evolution of the
    Tangle network, offering a real-time view of data transmission. Network management
    is eased by noting the information displayed in the Peers tab, and finally, plugin
    add-ons are allowed in the Plugins tab. Through the IOTA dashboard, farmers, researchers,
    and decision-makers can gain valuable insights into the conditions of the rice
    fields, enabling them to make informed decisions that promote sustainable cultivation
    practices. This case study will explore how the IOTA dashboard can be used in
    promoting sustainability in rice cultivation. The analytics tab is composed of
    four sub-tabs, namely Tangle, Node, Memory, and Caches. As depicted in Figure
    3, the Tangle subsection supplies several valuable metrics, such as known messages,
    new messages, received messages, messages sent, message requests received, sent
    message requests, heartbeats received, heartbeats sent, milestone request received,
    sent milestone request, and deleted packets. Figure 3. IOTA dashboard: analytics.
    Between these analytics, it is possible to note a heartbeat signal. Heartbeat
    is a periodic signal that hardware or software produces, and it is used both to
    show proper operation and synchronize nodes. It is one of the mission-critical
    systems’ most widely used techniques to provide high availability and fault tolerance
    of network services by detecting network or node system failures. Other sections
    provide information regarding memory usage and cache state. The Node section is
    in charge of providing insights on messages sent per milestone, which define a
    temporal interval defining the time needed to pass until the network coordinator
    executes the message validation. The state and the throughput of the network are
    viewable in the network graph, as depicted in Figure 4, which represents the construction
    of a Tangle or a DAG graph, i.e., the distributed registry in which are stored
    all transitions. In the sidebar of Figure 4, there are the following Tangle properties:
    (i) messages that indicates the number of messages sent; (ii) MPS, i.e., the number
    of messages sent to the network per second; (iii) TIPS, i.e., the number of unapproved
    transactions; (iv) referenced, i.e., the percentage of transactions referenced
    by other transactions; (v) conflicting, i.e., the percentage of transactions with
    conflicts; and (vi) solid, i.e., transactions with their history. Figure 4. Tangle
    graph. In Figure 5, it is possible to see one of the requirements for interacting
    with the IOTA network. The choices depend on the technologies one chooses to use,
    but also on whether one wants to use one’s own node (direct access) or rely on
    third-party nodes. Figure 5. Dependencies and requirements of IOTA. Constructing
    a personal node for network access is the optimal choice. The entire infrastructure
    can be raised using an editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code) or any other editor or
    IDE. Once Docker is configured and operational, the installation of either Hornet
    or Bee is enabled allowing for crafting nodes. Upon completion, the node may be
    launched via Docker. After configuring the network settings, the dashboard is
    accessible, enabling the owned node viewing as well as interaction with other
    nodes and also providing insights regarding the IOTA network. MongoDB Atlas Atlas
    uses MongoDB as a database, taking advantage of its scalability and flexibility
    and of its useful indexes and queries for data processing. Data originating from
    the Raspberry Pi are sent through EMQX and are written into the Atlas database.
    To establish a database on MongoDB Atlas for agricultural monitoring, follow these
    steps: register on the Atlas website, choose a cluster, create the database, and
    configure the connection string. MongoDB stores data records as BSON documents
    in collections, similar to tables in relational databases. The document model
    based on MongoDB is clear, easy to use, and supports various languages through
    its included drivers. The Atlas interface provides an overview of the data flow
    and allows the transformation of agricultural data into charts, as shown in Figure
    6, which displays two charts, one tracking the temperature and humidity data over
    time based on the hour, the other counting the amount of data each sensor has
    sent compared to the other sensors. Figure 6. Atlas data charts. By selecting
    the desired database, it is possible to choose the chart and then select the data
    of interest to be represented in the graph, setting a title and some properties.
    This chart is saved in the dashboard, and every time new data are received, they
    are written into the database, automatically updating the various charts based
    on the corresponding fields. There are approximately nine chart options, with
    an average of two subcategories for each. In Figure 7, it is possible to see the
    number of times a certain temperature is detected. For example, 23 degrees has
    been detected 25 times, while 24 degrees has been detected only 5 times. The chart
    on the right displays the total count of temperature data. In this case, both
    the humidity and barometer sensors detect the temperature. By adding the two values
    shown in the second chart in Figure 3, which are 26 and 27, a percentage of 53%
    is obtained. Figure 7. Temperature. These visualizations can be made visible to
    specific users, such as farmers or sustainability experts, or even made public
    through an off-site link. This feature enhances the accessibility of critical
    sustainability information, even outside of Atlas, promoting transparency and
    informed decision-making in agricultural practice. Hence, integrating MongoDB
    and Atlas in an IOTA-based deployment offers a robust solution for monitoring
    and analyzing sustainability parameters in agriculture. The flexibility in storage
    options, ease of setup, and data visualization capabilities make it a valuable
    tool in modern agricultural practices. Figure 8 depicts the architecture of the
    proposed model and the logical flows running through the system components. Briefly,
    data gathered by the IoT Sensors flow through EMQX to the Raspberry Pi, which
    acts as a gateway to send data to the HTTP Application Server. The node Application
    Server manages such data communicating with the IOTA network passing through the
    deployed node, as well as with the Atlas interfaces, thus enabling data monitoring
    via the analytical dashboard. Figure 8. Architecture of the system. 4. Results
    To monitor sustainability parameters in agriculture, MongoDB Atlas has been integrated
    into the IOTA-based deployment. The setup process has involved registering on
    the Atlas website, selecting a cluster, creating the database, and configuring
    the connection string. The Atlas interface allows the transformation of data into
    charts, which are automatically updated with new data. To this aim, data from
    devices like Raspberry Pis are sent through EMQX to a Node.Js script by leveraging
    APIs, and received data are stored in the MongoDB Cloud of Atlas. Moreover, we
    implemented a connection established with the local IOTA node (Hornet Mainnet)
    to propagate the data in the IOTA Tangle. The created Node.js server takes care
    of receiving, processing, and translating the data into services for the graphical
    interface. A lightweight Node.js server is created to receive, process, and translate
    the data into services for the graphical interface. The server listens on a customizable
    port, providing services to those who connect to that port. Aiming to achieve
    real-time insights, we developed an analytical dashboard, which is responsible
    for making viewable the received data. These are divided into several sections,
    each describing a different analysis aspect, as depicted in Figure 9. The sections
    include notifications, derived data, graphs, a table, alerts, and a map. The data
    in the table include count, id, date, time, message, temperature, humidity, pressure,
    altitude, latitude, longitude, status, and sensor name. Two soil sensors have
    been installed, one for notifying when the soil’s water level is insufficient
    and the other for alerting when there is excess water. Figure 9. Analytical dashboard.
    Hereafter, we illustrate the various sections of the analytical dashboard displayed
    in Figure 9. Section 1 showcases a menu that remains visible while scrolling the
    page. It counts both incoming data and highlights any data that requires attention.
    These particular data points are also tallied in the alerts. Section 2 illustrates
    data derived from analytical operations performed on raw sensor data. Starting
    from the left, we have the average humidity, obtained by summing up the humidity
    data points and dividing them by the number of humidity data points. Next, the
    minimum and maximum humidity values are reported by comparing the previously stored
    data with the subsequent data. Depending on the result, the old data may be overwritten.
    As in the case of humidity, it is possible that there are no fluctuations in either
    an upward or downward trend, resulting in the “Min” and “Max” values being equal.
    “Average Temperature”, “Min”, and “Max” values are calculated in the same manner.
    In Section 3, the “HUMIDITY” box displays the humidity data received from the
    temperature sensor. Specifically, the x-axis represents the time the data are
    received, and the y-axis represents the temperature data, which remain constant
    at 65% in this case. Regarding the “TEMPERATURE” box, the same procedure described
    in the previous case is followed, with the difference being that the temperature
    data are considered. As observed, the temperature data vary between 22 and 21
    degrees within the selected time interval. The “traces” are the lines used to
    construct the graph; in the “TEMPERATURE” box, there are eight traces. Both boxes
    feature a scroll bar that appears when the graph requires more space to display
    the newly received data while allowing the visualization of previous data by scrolling
    through the bar. Section 4 shows a dynamically populated table with JSON data
    sent by Raspberry sensors. There is a data model for the data types that each
    sensor sends, and the table can be fully viewed by scrolling horizontally. The
    same applies to the quantity of data, which requires scrolling vertically to view
    it. In detail, the data in the table include: Count indicates the number of times
    a specific sensor sends data; Id uniquely identifies each sensor; Date indicates
    the date the data was sent by Raspberry; Time indicates the time corresponding
    to the data sent by Raspberry; Message indicates additional information regarding
    the data; Temperature indicates the detected temperature; Humidity indicates the
    recorded humidity; Pressure indicates the identified pressure; Altitude indicates
    the measured altitude; Latitude and Longitude indicate the geographic coordinates
    of the sensor’s location; Status takes a value of 0 or 1 depending on the sensor;
    Sensor Name indicates the sensor’s name, which is useful for identifying the specific
    sensor being considered. The value “undefined” indicates that the specific sensor
    being considered does not produce that type of data detected by another specific
    sensor for that purpose. In Section 5 of Figure 9, the sensors with values requiring
    greater attention are displayed on the left, as seen in the table. Each alert
    notification is accompanied by the date, time, critical message, and an icon indicating
    its significance. At the top, the total number of alert messages received is shown.
    On the right, a real map is displayed, showing simulated geo-localization coordinates
    of the sensors. These data can either be pre-set or dynamically passed and plotted.
    Similarly, Figure 10 demonstrates the functioning of the two soil sensors, one
    alerting when the soil’s water level is insufficient, the other signaling when
    there is excess water. Figure 10. Functioning of the soil sensors. According to
    the works of Mboyerwa et al. [21] and Prem Kumar et al. [19], IoT and IOTA have
    emerged as disrupting technologies in the agrifood supply chain and sustainability
    optimization; we deem that our Proof-of-Concept will be a further advancement
    in monitoring and improving the sustainability of agrifood production processes.
    Moreover, IoT devices relying on centralized communications present a number of
    security threats related to privacy and security. IOTA addresses these flaws,
    also removing the blockchains’s limitations; indeed, IoT devices lack the computational
    power and storage needed to run consensus algorithms to be an involved part of
    the blockchain [22]. Taken together, our results answered the question that guided
    our research by creating a web application capable of integrating IOTA with IoT
    sensors devoted to real-time monitoring of agrifood supply chains. 5. Discussion
    In this section, we discuss the obtained results. 5.1. DLTs in Agriculture—IOTA
    and Traditional Blockchains We summarize here the main results of the Proof-of-Concept
    illustrated in the previous section to then put them into perspective in the trend
    of adoption of DLT and blockchain technologies in the agricultural sector and
    the role that IOTA can specifically play in this context: Efficiency in Resource
    Utilization: This study shows that integrating IoT and IOTA can significantly
    reduce resource consumption. Thus, this integration effectively implements the
    sustainable agricultural practices illustrated in [21]. Technological Infrastructure:
    This study employs various technologies, including Raspberry Pi 4, various sensors,
    and IOTA, a distributed ledger technology tailored for IoT. These technologies
    monitor various environmental conditions like soil moisture, temperature, and
    pH. Data Management and Security: This study uses IOTA to bolster data management
    and introduce a robust authorization system. It also employs MQTT and EMQX for
    remote IoT data collection, supporting up to 2 million connections on a single
    server node. Environmental Impact: IoT has the potential to mitigate the environmental
    footprint of agriculture by reducing water and energy consumption, greenhouse
    gas emissions, and fertilizer runoff. Financial Benefits: IoT can elevate the
    profitability and competitiveness of farmers by granting access to new markets,
    services, and performance-based incentives. Real-Time Monitoring: The IOTA dashboard
    provides real-time insights into various parameters like soil moisture, temperature,
    and pH levels, enabling informed decision-making for sustainable agriculture.
    Technological Toolkit: This study uses a diverse set of technologies, including
    Raspberry and its sensors, EMQX (MQTT), VPN and Ubuntu, Docker, IOTA, and MongoDB,
    and is programmed in Python, NodeJs, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Sustainability:
    This study concludes that the IoT stands as a pivotal force in enhancing agricultural
    productivity and sustainability, especially as the demand for food rises amidst
    limited resources. Transitioning from these findings, we delve into the broader
    implications and applications of DLTs in agriculture. Agriculture is a critical
    sector facing numerous challenges, including climate change, environmental degradation,
    and the need for sustainable practices. These challenges necessitate innovative
    solutions, and one such promising technology is the IoT. However, the vast amounts
    of data generated by IoT devices must be managed securely and efficiently. Moreover,
    agrifood businesses are increasingly pressured by governmental and consumer organizations
    to validate the safety and quality of their production processes. To meet these
    demands, DLTs offer a robust solution. They provide a decentralized system for
    storing and updating data across a network of nodes, eliminating the need for
    a central authority. DLTs employ cryptography and consensus mechanisms to ensure
    data integrity and validity. While DLTs offer numerous benefits like traceability,
    transparency, and operational efficiency, it is important to note that they are
    not a one-size-fits-all solution. Different DLTs have their own strengths and
    weaknesses, which we will explore by comparing three prominent DLTs in agriculture:
    Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, and IOTA. Of course, this is not a random choice;
    all three platforms stand out for their agricultural achievements and potential
    compared to other DLTs and blockchains. We will focus on two main use cases: traceability
    in the agrifood supply chain and real-time monitoring of cultivation practices.
    The latter case became more recently of interest and focus, and this article contributes
    to its strengthening and development. At the same time, the former has an older
    record, being one of the first use cases of non-financial blockchain/DLT applications.
    To compare these three DLTs strictly from a technological standpoint, see the
    study of Garriga et al. [6] instead, and the study of Dalla Palma et al. [23].
    5.1.1. Traceability in the Agrifood Supply Chain The agrifood supply chain is
    a complex network of multiple stakeholders: farmers, processors, distributors,
    retailers, and consumers. Each stakeholder has its record-keeping system, which
    may not be compatible or transparent to others. This creates challenges in ensuring
    food products’ origin, quality, and safety and meeting local and international
    regulations. DLTs can help overcome these challenges by providing a shared and
    immutable ledger of transactions and data throughout the production process. Ethereum
    and Hyperledger Fabric, the most popular blockchain platform from the Hyperledger
    software ecosystem, are traditional blockchains supporting traceability in the
    agrifood supply chain. Ethereum is a public blockchain that allows anyone to join
    and participate in the network. It supports smart contracts, i.e., self-executing
    agreements written in code that can automate supply chain processes and ensure
    traceability. Fabric is a private blockchain that allows only authorized participants
    to join and transact on the network. It supports private transactions and complex
    supply chain permissions that can handle sensitive data and comply with regulations.
    Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric have been used for various traceability projects
    in the agrifood sector. For instance, IBM Food Trust (https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/solutions/food-trust,
    accessed on 7 October 2023) is a platform built on Fabric that connects farmers,
    processors, distributors, and retailers to share data and track food products
    from farm to fork. Similarly, OriginTrail (https://origintrail.io/, accessed on
    7 October 2023) is a protocol built on Ethereum that enables interoperable data
    exchange and verification across different supply chain actors. The articles by
    Cocco et al. [24] and Marchesi et al. [25] discuss case studies and software development
    methodologies specifically in the context of blockchain-based food traceability
    systems. 5.1.2. Blockchains vs. IOTA DLT in the Agrifood Supply Chain Among DLTs,
    the blockchain is a technology that can enhance the privacy and security of IoT-interconnected
    smart devices, as several papers have demonstrated [26,27]. The blockchain offers
    features such as transparency, immutability, resilience, and cryptography that
    can address some of the challenges of IoT network architecture. However, the blockchain
    also has a cost in terms of transaction fees and architectural complexity, requiring
    expertise from various disciplines. Therefore, the blockchain should manage valuable
    assets, such as business data and financial assets [28]. On the other hand, the
    IOTA Tangle is a DLT that can improve sustainability and agrifood monitoring without
    such costs, allowing agrifood supply chains to adopt it without affecting their
    business [29]. 5.1.3. Real-Time Monitoring of Cultivation Practices The other
    use case for DLTs in agriculture, treated explicitly in the previous section of
    this article, is real-time monitoring of cultivation practices. This involves
    using IoT sensors to collect various data from the field, such as soil moisture,
    temperature, humidity, pest infestation, and so on. These data can help farmers
    optimize their inputs, reduce their environmental impact, and improve their yields.
    However, IoT sensors generate huge amounts of data that must be transmitted and
    stored securely and efficiently. As we have seen, IOTA is a DLT that is designed
    for high-frequency IoT scenarios. Unlike traditional blockchains that use a linear
    chain of blocks to store data, IOTA uses a DAG called Tangle. The Tangle is composed
    of individual transactions that are interlinked to each other and stored across
    a network of nodes. To issue a transaction on the Tangle, a node has to validate
    two previous transactions. This allows IOTA to overcome the cost and scalability
    limitations of blockchains. As highlighted in the description of our study, IOTA
    has several advantages for real-time monitoring of cultivation practices. First,
    it enables zero-fee transactions, meaning nodes can send and receive data without
    paying fees. This is ideal for frequent, low-value data transmissions from IoT
    sensors. Second, it enables high scalability, meaning the network can handle many
    transactions per second without compromising performance or security. This is
    ideal for accommodating varying numbers of sensors and devices on the network.
    Third, it enables data integrity, which means that the data stored on the Tangle
    are tamper-proof and verifiable by anyone on the network. This is ideal for accurate
    decision-making based on real-time data. Our study offers a comprehensive guide
    for building an IOTA-based real-time monitoring system tailored for sustainable
    agriculture. In this context, it complements Future Farm (https://future-farm.iota.org/#/,
    accessed on 7 October 2023), an initiative by the IOTA Foundation that also leverages
    IOTA for data collection and analysis through IoT sensors in greenhouses. While
    Future Farm focuses on process optimization—emphasizing the sharing of IoT data
    among various stakeholders in agriculture—our approach is more user-centric. Specifically,
    we demonstrate how a farm operator can effectively utilize the IOTA Tangle for
    real-time monitoring. 5.1.4. Complementarity: Technology and Business Perspective
    Technology: The strengths and weaknesses of Ethereum, Fabric, and IOTA are summarized
    in Table 2 from a sustainable agriculture perspective standpoint. While Ethereum
    and Fabric cater to supply chain transparency and notarization of product origin
    and quality, IOTA is tailored for high-frequency IoT data transactions. However,
    these DLTs are not mutually exclusive. They can be integrated and interoperable,
    offering a comprehensive view of the agrifood sector. For example, IOTA’s real-time
    data can be linked to Ethereum or Hyperledger Fabric’s smart contracts, triggering
    actions or payments based on predefined conditions. Alternatively, IOTA’s data
    streams can be hashed and anchored to Ethereum or Hyperledger Fabric’s blockchains,
    creating a secure and verifiable record of the data history. These integrations
    can leverage the best features of each DLT, creating a synergistic effect. Table
    2. Comparison of DLTs in agriculture: Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, and IOTA.
    Business: DLTs offer different value propositions for the agrifood sector depending
    on their use cases and applications. While traceability emphasizes transparency,
    notarization, and compliance, real-time monitoring targets operational efficiency
    and sustainability. These value propositions can have various implications for
    market differentiation and consumer engagement. For instance, traceability can
    bolster branding and product authenticity, creating a competitive edge in the
    market. Traceability can also assure consumers about product origin and quality,
    increasing their trust and loyalty. On the other hand, real-time monitoring can
    lead to sustainable practices and cost savings, improving the business’s bottom
    line. Real-time monitoring can also offer insights into sustainable cultivation
    practices, educating consumers and raising awareness. Enriched Business Value:
    Integrating DLTs in the agrifood sector can also create new opportunities for
    funding acquisition and carbon credit trading. These opportunities can provide
    financial incentives for adopting DLTs and promoting sustainable agriculture.
    For example, traceability and real-time monitoring can serve as evidence for quality
    manufacturing and sustainable cultivation practices. This can be pivotal for acquiring
    funding from government agencies or private investors that incentivize such practices.
    Moreover, integrating DLTs can facilitate the generation of carbon credits by
    validating sustainable practices. These credits can be traded as securities on
    DLT-based platforms, offering a new revenue stream for farmers and businesses.
    On the other hand, Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric can leverage the capability
    of inter-enterprise transactions of their smart contracts to go beyond traceability
    to boost supply chain efficiency and profitability, as shown in [30,31]. Summing
    up, Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, and IOTA are three prominent DLTs that can revolutionize
    the agrifood sector. While they cater to different agrifood needs, their combined
    strengths can create a holistic solution that addresses the challenges and opportunities
    of the sector. By integrating them into suitable ecosystems as characterized in
    Salzano et al. [32], innovators can ignite a global business transformation that
    benefits farmers, businesses, consumers, and the environment. 5.2. Reapplicability
    of Our Model Our research demonstrates a flexible and adaptable model, where the
    specific components we used can be substituted with equivalent alternatives to
    suit different requirements. Database Management System Flexibility: While our
    study leverages the capabilities of MongoDB, the architecture of our model is
    not limited to this particular DBMS. The design is compatible with various other
    database management systems, enhancing the model’s applicability across diverse
    data management scenarios. Hardware Versatility: In terms of hardware, our choice
    of the Raspberry Pi 4 is illustrative rather than prescriptive. The model can
    be adapted to work with a range of single board computers or similar devices,
    provided they possess comparable technical capabilities. This flexibility ensures
    that our model can be deployed in a variety of hardware environments. Sensor Selection
    and Adaptability: We chose specific sensors for monitoring key parameters in the
    rice supply chain. However, this selection is not rigid. Different sensors can
    be employed based on the requirements of other agrifood products or supply chains.
    The adaptability of our model to various sensor types and data inputs underscores
    its potential for broader application in agriculture. Cross-Product and Supply
    Chain Applicability: While our Proof-of-Concept is centered on rice cultivation,
    the underlying model is designed to be transferable to other agrifood supply chains.
    This transferability is facilitated by the selection of appropriate sensors and
    the integration of various communication protocols. System and OS Compatibility
    through Containerization: Our model’s use of containerization technology ensures
    its portability and compatibility across different systems and operating systems.
    This aspect of the design significantly enhances the model’s utility and ease
    of deployment in diverse IT environments. In summary, the design of our study
    reflects a commitment to versatility and adaptability, allowing for the application
    of our model in a variety of agricultural contexts beyond its initial implementation.
    6. Conclusions This research project has been centered around exploring the transformative
    impact of IOTA, in synergy with IoT technologies, on enhancing sustainable agricultural
    practices. Our study specifically targeted the optimization of water-resource
    consumption in rice field irrigation, which is a critical aspect of sustainable
    agriculture. The core objective of our study was to meticulously monitor and improve
    resource utilization, with a particular emphasis on water efficiency. The results
    demonstrate that an intelligent irrigation system, powered by advanced sensor
    technology, can be instrumental in achieving sustainable cultivation practices.
    This system enables real-time data acquisition and analysis, which are pivotal
    in guiding empirical practices for resource optimization. Specifically, we observed
    the potential of this system to significantly reduce water usage by up to 50%,
    lower nitrogen consumption by 25%, and decrease methane emissions by 50% to 70%.
    A key aspect of our system is its ability to compile historical data on water
    usage, providing a rich dataset for strategizing future resource management approaches.
    The integration of IoT devices, particularly those managed through IOTA’s technology,
    has proven exceptionally effective in handling and analyzing large volumes of
    data, thereby boosting the overall efficiency and precision of agricultural processes.
    A notable accomplishment of this project was the seamless and rapid data transmission
    from the field (via Raspberry Pi) to the cloud. This was achieved with minimal
    latency, demonstrating the effectiveness of MQTT in data routing and the capacity
    of IOTA to provide near-real-time recording and optimal storage for extensive
    datasets. Despite some latency challenges encountered with MongoDB, it played
    a crucial role as an intermediary, facilitating effective communication and data
    management between IOTA and other integrated technologies. This integration was
    pivotal in enhancing data organization and processing speed. Looking ahead, future
    research could explore optimizing sensor sampling rates to make them more dynamic
    and responsive to environmental and inventory conditions. Additionally, adjusting
    the number of active sensors based on these parameters could enhance efficiency,
    allowing some IoT devices to enter a sleep mode when not needed, thus conserving
    energy. In conclusion, this research highlights the integral role of IOTA, particularly
    in tandem with the IoT, in the future of sustainable agriculture. IOTA emerges
    not just as one of many options, but as a particularly compelling choice for real-time
    monitoring and implementation of sustainable agricultural practices. Its application
    extends beyond mere data tracking to actively influencing and optimizing on-ground
    practices, aligning closely with the global goals of environmental conservation
    and food security. This study affirms that the synergy of IOTA and IoT is not
    just a computational marvel but a practical tool for empirical advancements in
    agriculture. Author Contributions Conceptualization, R.P. and R.C.; methodology,

    Learning Introduction Sub-Saharan Africa is a region whose agriculture is heavily
    reliant on unpredictable rainfall. According to the FAO, the total area of land
    under irrigation in sub-Saharan Africa was estimated at 7 million hectares in
    2020, representing only 5 % of the region''s arable land [1], [2], [3]. Globally
    freshwater resources are limited and unevenly distributed, with many regions experiencing
    physical and economic water scarcity (UN [4]). Despite the ongoing challenges
    related to water scarcity, there are global developments in irrigation that hold
    promise for enhancing agricultural productivity and building resilience against
    the impacts of climate change [[5], [6], [7], [8],4]. The world is currently witnessing
    the fourth industrial revolution, characterized by the integration of emerging
    technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain, the Internet of
    Things (IoT), Big Data Technology, Drones, Robots and 3D printing [9,10]. The
    use of these modern intelligent technologies in irrigation is emerging in sub-Saharan
    Africa and is set to transform farming by allowing smart and precise irrigation
    [11,12]. For instance, IoT sensors can be used to monitor soil moisture levels
    and automatically adjust irrigation to optimize water use efficiency, whereas
    AI applications can predict weather patterns and optimize irrigation scheduling.
    To enhance water-use efficiency and contribute to Sustainable Development Goals
    (SDGs), particularly Goal 6 and Target 6.4, it is essential to implement innovation
    in irrigation systems. As such, there is a need for increased investment in irrigation
    infrastructure and adoption of modern intelligent technologies to ensure sustainable
    irrigation practices in sub-Saharan Africa. The importance of smart irrigation
    cannot be overstated in today''s world, where climate change is affecting global
    freshwater resources and increasing water scarcity. Manual irrigation of crops
    is not only time-consuming but also inefficient, while irrigation based on fixed
    timers does not account for changes in weather or soil conditions that affect
    moisture levels [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. Smart irrigation systems take into
    account weather and soil conditions to optimize irrigation, resulting in significant
    water savings of up to 30 percent [18], [19], [20], [21]. As a result, smart irrigation
    has emerged as a more effective and sustainable approach in irrigated agriculture.
    The essence of smart irrigation lies in its conceptual framework, which amalgamates
    technology and agricultural practices to optimize water use efficiency. This framework
    revolves around several key components. Sensors and monitoring systems, ranging
    from soil moisture sensors to weather instruments, gather real-time data on variables
    critical to irrigation decisions. This data is then subjected to analysis using
    cutting-edge approaches like artificial intelligence and machine learning models,
    providing insights that inform irrigation scheduling, water allocation, and crop
    management. The actual irrigation is optimized through precision delivery mechanisms
    like drip irrigation, which directs water directly to plant root zones, minimizing
    losses through evaporation and runoff [22]. Automation and control mechanisms
    enable real-time adjustments based on collected data, enhancing the efficiency
    of irrigation practices. The integration of these components is facilitated by
    the connectivity and communication capabilities of the IoT, enabling seamless
    data exchange, remote monitoring, and control of irrigation systems [13]. Central
    to the smart irrigation discourse is the concept of Water Use Efficiency (WUE)
    in agriculture. WUE measures the ratio of agricultural output to the amount of
    water used for productively by the plant [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28]. Smart
    irrigation systems have the potential to enhance WUE significantly by tailoring
    irrigation schedules to crop water requirements [29,30,23,31,[24], [25], [26],
    [27], [28]]. Leveraging real-time data on factors like soil moisture, weather
    conditions, and plant stress, these systems enable precise irrigation, optimizing
    both water use and crop growth. The incorporation of 4IR technologies further
    enhances WUE by enabling accurate predictions of water demand. AI algorithms analyze
    historical data and environmental factors to forecast crop water needs, ensuring
    timely irrigation application. This predictive ability, combined with real-time
    weather monitoring, empowers farmers to adapt irrigation schedules proactively,
    thus optimizing water use efficiency. Despite various studies investigating irrigation
    technologies and practices, a significant research gap persists regarding the
    effective integration of 4IR technologies into smart irrigation systems. Recent
    systematic literature reviews have focused on the applications of 4IR in other
    domains like manufacturing, health, transport, fashion, labor force among others
    [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43]. Therefore,
    the primary objective of this systematic review paper was to examine the role
    of 4IR technologies in smart irrigation and their potential applications in the
    context of sub-Saharan Africa. Specifically, the review aimed to: a) explore the
    utilization of AI in irrigation systems for precision irrigation, water demand
    prediction, crop yield estimation, and soil moisture management; b) investigate
    the role of IoT and Drone Technology in generating and managing data for improved
    irrigation management practices; c) examine the potential applications of Blockchain
    and Machine Learning in irrigation, particularly in data management and decision-making
    processes; and d) identify the constraints, challenges, and opportunities associated
    with leveraging 4IR technologies in smart irrigation within the context of sub-Saharan
    Africa. This paper provides insights for researchers, decision-makers, and practitioners
    interested in enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of irrigation practices
    in sub-Saharan Africa. Research methodology A systematic review approach was used

    regarding industrial revolution The Industrial Revolution marked a significant
    turning point in human history, propelling societies into an era of unprecedented
    technological advancements. Throughout the various stages of the Industrial Revolution,
    irrigation technology played a crucial role in enhancing agricultural productivity
    and sustaining growing populations. In this section, we explored the evolution
    of irrigation technology from the Industrial Revolution 1.0 to 4.0 and the timelines,
    showcasing the remarkable advancements that revolutionized the way water was harnessed
    and distributed for agricultural purposes. The first Industrial Revolution, starting
    in the late 18th century, witnessed the emergence of steam power as a primary
    driving force [47]. This technological breakthrough led to advancements in irrigation
    systems. Steam-powered pumps and engines were introduced [48], enabling the lifting
    of water from rivers and reservoirs to higher elevations. Canal systems were developed
    to transport water efficiently across vast distances, promoting agricultural expansion
    and increasing crop yields [49]. The second Industrial Revolution, characterized
    by the widespread adoption of electricity and mass production techniques [50],
    had a profound impact on irrigation technology. Electrical pumps and motors replaced
    steam-powered machinery, providing more reliable and efficient water delivery.
    Farmers gained greater control over irrigation schedules, leading to improved
    water management, and increased agricultural output [51]. Electric-powered sprinkler
    systems and drip irrigation methods were introduced, optimizing water distribution,
    and minimizing waste. With the advent of the third Industrial Revolution, automation
    and computerization revolutionized irrigation technology [52]. The integration
    of sensors, data analytics, and computer systems into irrigation infrastructure
    enabled precise monitoring and control of water usage. Automated irrigation systems
    adjusted water flow based on soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and plant
    requirements, ensuring optimal irrigation while conserving water resources. This
    era witnessed the emergence of smart irrigation technologies, empowering farmers
    with real-time data and insights for efficient decision-making [53]. The ongoing
    fourth Industrial Revolution, characterized by digitalization and the IoT [54],
    is transforming irrigation technology in unprecedented ways. Advanced sensor networks,
    drones, and satellite imagery are utilized to monitor soil conditions, water availability,
    and plant health with exceptional precision. Machine learning algorithms analyze
    vast amounts of data, providing predictive insights to optimize irrigation strategies
    and maximize crop productivity. Smart irrigation systems, integrated with AI-driven
    controllers, remotely manage water distribution, reducing water waste and enabling
    sustainable agricultural practices. Fig. 5 summarizes the remarkable industrial
    revolution with the different technologies. Download : Download high-res image

    [54]. Fourth industrial revolution technologies for smart irrigation In 2011,
    the German government unveiled a novel concept known as \"Industry 4.0″ during
    a trade fair. This initiative primarily aims to enhance collaboration among individuals,
    machinery, and resources [55]. At its core, Industry 4.0 revolves around the idea
    of bridging the gap between the physical and virtual realms [56]. It establishes
    connections among machines, functions, and systems through intelligent networks
    that span the entire value chain, allowing them to operate autonomously and interact
    with one another [57]. The term \"Industry 4.0″ refers to both partially and fully
    automated advanced manufacturing processes driven by technology, where equipment
    can communicate independently throughout the value chain [56]. This innovative
    concept encompasses various technologies such as digital manufacturing, network
    communication, computing, and automation, all integrated within the adaptable
    and intricate systems of Industry 4.0. The application of Fourth Industrial Revolution
    technologies in irrigation (Fig. 6) represents a significant leap forward in modern
    agriculture. This transformative era is marked by the convergence of digital,
    physical, and biological systems, and it brings with it a multitude of innovative
    tools and techniques that enhance irrigation practices. One of the key pillars
    of this revolution is the IoT, which involves embedding sensors and devices in
    irrigation systems to collect real-time data on soil moisture levels, weather
    conditions, and crop health. AI and machine learning algorithms then process this
    data to make precise and timely decisions regarding irrigation scheduling, optimizing
    water usage, and minimizing waste. Furthermore, drones equipped with advanced
    imaging technology are employed for aerial monitoring of fields, providing farmers
    with a comprehensive view of their crops and irrigation needs. Additionally, blockchain
    technology is being utilized to create transparent and secure systems for water
    resource management and supply chain tracking, ensuring the efficient distribution
    of water resources. These 4IR technologies collectively empower farmers with unprecedented
    control and insights into their irrigation practices, ultimately contributing
    to increased crop yields, resource conservation, and sustainable agricultural
    practices in an era of global environmental challenges. Download : Download high-res

    for smart irrigation. Artificial intelligence in smart irrigation AI refers to
    the ability of machines to learn and make decisions based on data [58]. AI plays
    a pivotal role in smart irrigation systems, enabling advanced analytics and decision-making
    capabilities [59]. AI algorithms can be used to analyze data on weather, soil
    moisture, and crop water requirements and to make automated decisions on irrigation
    scheduling [60]. This can improve the accuracy and efficiency of irrigation management
    and reduce the risk of over- or under-irrigation. AI enables farmers to collect,
    analyze, and interpret data on a large scale, allowing for more precise and accurate
    irrigation decisions [61]. AI can analyze large amounts of data and provide insights
    that can be used to optimize irrigation. For example, AI can analyze data on soil
    moisture levels, temperature, humidity, and crop growth patterns to identify the
    most efficient irrigation strategies for specific crops and soil types. Fig. 7

    image Fig. 7. Integration of AI in Smart Irrigation. Predictive modelling for
    water demand and crop yield AI-based predictive models for example neural networks,
    ensemble, regression, classification, and time series forecasting models are utilized
    to forecast water demand and crop yield based on historical data and environmental
    factors (Kuradusenge et al., 2023; [45]). Such models use historical data, weather
    patterns, and crop-specific information to estimate the irrigation requirements,
    facilitating efficient water allocation. Kuradusenge et al. (2023) used rainfall
    and temperature data analyzed through Random Forest, Polynomial Regression, and
    Support Vector Regressor to predict crop yield of Irish potato and maize. Random
    forest was recommended for early crop yield prediction of potatoes and maize (Kuradusenge
    et al., 2023). AI algorithms are employed to analyze real-time data from soil
    moisture sensors and determine the optimal irrigation timing and volume [62].
    By continuously monitoring soil moisture levels, smart irrigation systems can
    ensure that crops receive adequate water while avoiding waterlogging and excessive
    runoff [63]. One example of the application of soil moisture monitoring and management
    in sub-Saharan Africa is a study done by (Wanyama et al., 2023). The authors have
    developed a cost-effective green technology intelligent irrigation control system
    kit that improves precise irrigation water application. This kit is a photovoltaic
    system that powers a water pump, a soil moisture sensor, and an Arduino microcontroller
    unit mounted on a moving frame. The soil moisture sensors were placed in the field
    and sent real-time soil moisture values to the microcontroller via a wired Universal
    Serial Bus (USB) communication channel. The microcontroller connected the water
    pump, the tank water level sensor, the soil moisture sensors, and the water tank
    outlet solenoid valve. Therefore, the system could schedule irrigation thus improving
    the traditional irrigation technology. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are employed
    in smart irrigation systems to analyze data patterns, make predictions, and optimize
    irrigation [64], [65], [66], [67]. ML algorithms learn from historical and real-time
    data, enabling adaptive decision-making and improving irrigation efficiency [68].
    Machine Learning algorithms can analyze historical data on weather, soil conditions,
    and crop performance to predict future irrigation requirements [62]. By providing
    accurate forecasts, ML-based predictive analytics support farmers in making informed
    decisions regarding irrigation scheduling, water allocation, and crop management.
    ML algorithms can be utilized to develop adaptive irrigation control systems that
    adjust irrigation parameters based on real-time data inputs [69,70]. These systems
    continuously monitor soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and plant water
    stress, allowing for dynamic irrigation control to optimize water use efficiency
    and crop productivity. The synergy between AI and smart irrigation is transformative,
    offering data-driven insights and automation for efficient water management. AI
    processes copious data from sensors, weather forecasts, and soil conditions to
    optimize irrigation schedules. ML models are trained on historical data and environmental
    cues to predict crop water requirements. Table 3 summarizes other applications
    using AI in irrigation operations. In another study, Ikudayisi et al. [71] conducted
    research focused on managing crop water requirements at the Winterton irrigation
    scheme in South Africa, aiming to address the challenges posed by water scarcity
    and its impact on agricultural efficiency. To achieve their objectives, the researchers
    employed a combined approach involving artificial intelligence, namely an artificial
    neural network (ANN), and a crop growth simulation model. The study aimed to estimate
    various aspects of crop irrigation water requirements, including the crop-water
    demand from planting to harvest, the timing of irrigation, the optimal stage in
    the drying cycle for water application, and the volume of irrigation water to
    be applied. Five feed-forward backward propagation ANN predictive models with
    varying configurations were developed and assessed. The optimal ANN model, characterized
    by 5 inputs, 5 neurons, 1 hidden layer, and 1 output, was employed to predict
    monthly reference evapotranspiration (ETo) in the Winterton region. This optimal
    ANN model demonstrated a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.67, a Pearson correlation
    coefficient (r) of 0.97, and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.94. The
    validation of the model revealed a correlation (r) value of 0.9048 between the
    measured and predicted ETo values. Table 3 summarizes other applications using
    AI in irrigation operations. Table 2 Table 2. Artificial intelligence applications

    Things in smart irrigation IoT refers to the network of devices, sensors, and
    machines that are connected to the internet and can exchange data with each other
    [77]. In smart irrigation systems, IoT devices such as sensors and controllers
    can be used to collect and transmit data on weather, soil moisture, and crop water
    requirements. This data can be processed and analyzed in real-time to adjust irrigation
    schedules and optimize water use. IoT plays a crucial role in collecting and transmitting
    data in smart irrigation systems [78,79]. IoT sensors and devices are deployed
    throughout the irrigation infrastructure to monitor various parameters and facilitate
    data-driven decision-making. connectivity. In IoT applications, connectivity between
    gateways, remote clouds, and users is typically over broadband communication networks.
    However, in most of sub-Saharan Africa''s rural countries, broadband connectivity
    is either very expensive or non-existent. Affordable broadband technologies like
    TVWS have been tested in South Africa and around the world and can provide both
    backhaul and last-mile wireless connectivity for remotely deployed agricultural
    IoT-based systems in various locations [80] Data generation and collection through
    IoT sensors IoT sensors, such as soil moisture sensors, weather stations, and
    flow meters, collect real-time data on soil moisture, temperature, humidity, rainfall,
    and water flow [81,82]. These sensors provide a continuous stream of information,
    enabling farmers to make informed decisions regarding irrigation management. Nigussie
    et al. (2020) proposed an IoT-based irrigation management system for smallholder
    farmers in South Africa, Kenya, and Ethiopia`s rural areas. Sensors in the system
    detect soil conditions (moisture, temperature, nutrients, and pH) and provide
    data on the water level in the storage as well as microclimate conditions. The
    actuators in this system direct the flow of water to the farm via sprinklers,
    pumps, valves, and water gates. The IoT network connectivity technology used in
    this system was Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN). This is because LoRaWAN
    is a fully open standard solution with no subscription fee, making it less expensive
    for IoT connectivity devices, and it is well-suited for long-distance. Cloud computing
    for data management and analysis Cloud computing has emerged as a revolutionary
    technology that can transform the way we manage and optimize irrigation systems.
    Cloud computing platforms are utilized to store and process the vast amount of
    data generated by IoT sensors in smart irrigation systems [83]. Cloud-based solutions
    provide scalable storage, computational power, and data analytics capabilities,
    allowing for efficient data management and analysis, [84]. One of the key benefits
    of cloud computing in smart irrigation is the ability to store and process large
    amounts of data in a centralized location. This allows farmers to easily access
    and analyze data on things like soil moisture levels, weather patterns, and crop
    health, which can help them make more informed decisions about irrigation. With
    data driven irrigation optimization, farmers can reduce water waste and ensure
    that water is used only when and where it is needed, leading to improved water
    use efficiency. In sub-Saharan Africa, cloud services create additional running
    costs for irrigation management systems. To address these issues, the most commonly
    proposed IoT architectures typically provide local processing and storage in gateways
    created for data processing, network management, irrigation decisions, and communication
    with farmers. This avoids the need for broadband networks and cloud services (backend
    servers) [80]. Maitethia et al. [85] executed a groundbreaking IoT smart irrigation
    system in Kenya, setting a remarkable precedent for precision agriculture in Africa.
    By integrating a network of sensors, weather stations, and cloud-based analytics,
    their pioneering initiative ushered in a new era of data-driven irrigation management.
    The remarkable outcomes encompassed substantial crop yield improvements, significant
    water conservation, substantial cost reductions, and enhanced climate resilience,
    ultimately bolstering food security and elevating the socioeconomic status of
    local farmers. Although initial investments and the need for comprehensive technical
    training posed initial challenges, the unparalleled potential of IoT-driven smart
    irrigation holds the promise of fostering a sustainable and prosperous future
    for African agriculture. Table 4 presents other applications of IoT in irrigation.
    Big data technology in smart irrigation Big Data Technology plays a significant
    role in unlocking the potential of data in smart irrigation systems [94]. By harnessing
    large volumes of data, valuable insights can be gained to optimize irrigation
    management practices. Big data analytics involves the use of advanced analytical
    techniques to extract insights from large and complex datasets. In smart irrigation
    systems, big data analytics can be used to analyze data on weather, soil moisture,
    and crop water requirements and to identify patterns and trends that can inform
    irrigation management. Big data refers to large and complex data sets that cannot
    be processed using traditional data processing techniques. In the context of precision
    irrigation, big data can be used to analyze large volumes of data on weather patterns,
    soil moisture levels, crop water requirements, and other factors that affect irrigation
    needs. Big Data analytics techniques are applied to historical and real-time data
    to identify patterns, trends, and correlations related to irrigation and crop
    performance [95]. This enables farmers to make data-driven decisions regarding
    irrigation scheduling, water allocation, and crop management. Rabhi et al. [96]
    explored the application of big data analytics in the context of smart irrigation,
    with a specific focus on digital agriculture in Morocco. Their research aimed
    to leverage big data analytics to enhance predictive irrigation techniques. They
    noted the growing importance of intelligent agriculture, characterized by widespread
    adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) analysis solutions, which has led to more
    precise irrigation scheduling. The research took place utilizing an irrigation
    dataset that considered moisture and temperature factors. To analyze this dataset,
    the authors employed neural network (NN) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms.
    The computational aspect of their study was conducted using the big data platform
    \"databricks,\" which implements the Spark framework for processing large datasets.
    The results from their models were promising, with SVM achieving an accuracy of
    97.00 % and NN reaching an accuracy of 98.50 %. In their future work, the authors
    intend to expand upon the 19,440 enterprise metamodel, introducing additional
    constructs related to advanced technologies such as big data analytics tools,
    IoT, AI, cloud computing, and machine learning. This extended metamodel is envisioned
    to be applied in the context of a smart farm, aligning with the principles of
    Agriculture 4.0. The use of Big Data in smart irrigation systems raises concerns
    about data privacy and security [97]. Safeguarding sensitive information and ensuring
    secure data transmission and storage are essential to maintain trust and protect
    the integrity of smart irrigation systems. Blockchain technology for managing
    big data in irrigation Blockchain technology offers a decentralized and transparent
    framework for managing and securing data in smart irrigation systems [95]. It
    provides an immutable ledger that records and verifies data transactions, ensuring
    data integrity and enabling trusted collaborations. Blockchain technology offers
    a decentralized and transparent framework for managing and securing data in smart
    irrigation systems [98]. By leveraging Blockchain, data can be stored and managed
    in a distributed manner across multiple nodes, eliminating the need for a central
    authority [99]. In smart irrigation, Blockchain can provide an immutable ledger
    that records and verifies data transactions related to water usage, irrigation
    practices, and resource management. Each data transaction is cryptographically
    linked to the previous transaction, creating a chain of blocks that ensures data
    integrity and transparency. By utilizing Blockchain for data management, smart
    irrigation systems can enhance trust and accountability in water governance [100].
    All stakeholders, including farmers, water authorities, and researchers, can access
    and verify the data recorded on the Blockchain, enabling transparent and auditable
    irrigation practices. The decentralized nature of Blockchain also mitigates the
    risks of data tampering and unauthorized modifications. Since data is stored across
    multiple nodes in the network, any attempt to alter the data would require consensus
    from a majority of nodes, making it highly secure and resistant to fraud or manipulation
    [101,102]. Moreover, Blockchain can facilitate trusted collaborations and data
    sharing among stakeholders in the irrigation ecosystem. Smart contracts, which
    are self-executing agreements coded on the Blockchain, can automate and enforce
    rules and conditions related to water allocation, usage rights, and payment systems
    [103]. These smart contracts enhance transparency and efficiency in irrigation
    governance, reducing the reliance on intermediaries and streamlining administrative
    processes. However, the adoption of Blockchain in smart irrigation systems comes
    with challenges. The scalability and energy consumption of Blockchain networks,
    especially in resource-constrained environments, need to be addressed. Additionally,
    ensuring data privacy while maintaining transparency is crucial, as sensitive
    information may be recorded on the Blockchain. Despite these challenges, Blockchain
    technology shows promising potential in revolutionizing data management and governance
    in smart irrigation systems. Further research and pilot projects are needed to
    explore the practical implementation and scalability of Blockchain solutions in
    the context of sub-Saharan Africa. Blockchain''s smart contract functionality
    can be leveraged to automate and enforce irrigation governance rules [104]. Smart
    contracts enable the execution of predefined rules and conditions related to water
    allocation, usage rights, and payment systems. This enhances transparency, reduces
    disputes, and ensures fair and accountable irrigation practices. Drone technology
    in smart irrigation Drone technology has emerged as a promising tool for enhancing
    smart irrigation practices in various agricultural contexts. Drones, also known
    as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), offer unique capabilities for remote sensing,
    high-resolution data collection, and precision irrigation management. Drones equipped
    with advanced sensors and imaging systems enable remote sensing and high-resolution
    data collection in agricultural landscapes [105,103,106]. These sensors capture
    data on various parameters, including soil moisture, vegetation indices, temperature,
    and crop health. The collected data provides valuable insights into the spatial
    variability of soil and crop conditions, allowing for targeted irrigation interventions.
    In Kenya, certain farmers have embraced innovative approaches such as employing
    near-infrared cameras affixed to drones for pest and disease identification, among
    other applications. Additionally, within the Kenyan context, there exists a beta-stage
    AI tool named Nuru, accessible on Android devices with or without internet connectivity
    [107]. This advanced technology specializes in the diagnosis of crop diseases,
    with a particular focus on identifying mite and viral infections in cassava and
    detecting armyworm infestations in maize. KDHI Agriculture reports that a substantial
    number of cassava farmers, approximately 28,000, have already reaped the benefits
    of this tool''s implementation. One of the key applications of drone technology
    in smart irrigation is the monitoring of soil moisture levels [108]. Drones equipped
    with specialized sensors can capture near infrared and thermal imagery to assess
    soil moisture content across fields. This information helps farmers understand
    the spatial distribution of moisture and make informed decisions on irrigation
    scheduling and water allocation. In addition to monitoring soil moisture, drones

    Introduction Agriculture is one of the key sources that plays a significant part
    in the life of the country''s economy. Traditional agriculture refers to the conventional
    farming methods that have been practiced for centuries, relying on manual labor
    and basic tools. In traditional agriculture, farmers often work in small plots
    of land using traditional seeds and farming practices passes down through the
    generations while traditional agriculture has played a crucial role in meeting
    food demands, it does have it disadvantages. One significant drawbacks is its
    relatively low efficiency and productivity. Manual labor-intensive tasks can be
    time-consuming and labor demanding, leading to potential wastage of water, fertilizers
    and pesticides. Moreover, traditional agriculture is more susceptible to the adverse
    effects of unpredictable weather conditions and environmental factors which can
    result in lower yields and economic losses. Meanwhile, food security is a global
    challenge and impacted by rapidly compounding effects of climate changes, population
    trends and supply chain shortcomings. Agriculture''s global impact cannot be overstated,
    as it remains the primary source of food for humanity. Despite the fact that the
    human population continues to grow, agricultural land remains static (Virk et
    al.2020). The authors (Mesgaran et al. 2017) also discovered that the ever-changing
    climatic conditions significantly reduce agricultural product output in conventional
    agricultural systems. As a result of the varying nature of farming resources and
    poor management, farmers continue to experience low agricultural output. Drawbacks
    of Traditional Farming Due to the low degree of automation in the farming area,
    the current state of the art in agriculture, particularly conventional agricultural
    systems, still confronts significant hurdles in terms of sustainability, labor-intensity,
    and energy efficiency needs. Also, the production level of the crops to be considered.
    Scalability problems also taken into account since the population explosion is
    the major cause. Precision Agriculture and Smart Farming In order to overcome
    the limitations and challenges faced in the conventional farming systems, the
    advent of the smart farming and precision agricultural sector to automate the
    farming processes towards achieving many goals towards sustainable agricultural
    systems. Some of them are listed below: • High quantity of crop yield • Better
    quality of the crops • Efficient resource utilization • Effective to handle climatic
    conditions • Decision making in cropping patterns • Environment and user-friendly
    • Easy maintenance • Minimized crop losses • Easy to handle pests, diseases, weeds
    • Minimize the crop growth time duration • Early prediction on the crop loss or
    gain • Ensures and motivates organic way of crop cultivation • Improves the growth
    of wide variety of crops • Reduces the usage of pesticides, fungicides and other
    chemicals that are not good for health. • Though huge amount for installations,
    less chances for failures and lasts for longer life-time. Continue Reading References

    1. Introduction 1.1. Agriculture – food security, gross domestic product, world
    population, and climate change Agriculture plays a crucial role in ensuring food
    security and has a significant impact Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the country.
    With the projected increase the global population, there will be a greater need
    for agricultural production (FAO et al., 2022). The need for food will in-fact
    rise significantly as the world''s population continues to grow. Also, it is expected
    that the world population will surpass 10 billion by 2050. To fulfil the increased
    demand caused by population growth, food production must increase by almost 70
    % (Giller et al., 2021). For agriculture to satisfy this need, it must adapt and
    expand. However, due to additional difficulties brought about by climate change
    and water constraints, existing agricultural methods are no longer enough to supply
    this expanding need (Elijah et al., 2018). 1.2. Smart agriculture – sustainability,
    production, and resources Smart agriculture is rapidly implementing contemporary
    technology to address these issues and boost production and sustainability (Ahmed
    et al., 2018, Lindgren et al., 2018). For instance, a recent scientific field
    called “smart irrigation” employs data-intensive techniques to maximize water
    consumption and boost agricultural production. Farmers may gain useful information
    from sensors and data analytics in agriculture to better understand how their
    actions affect the soil. Farmers may use data gleaned from environmental parameter
    monitoring and analysis to improve practices, make well-informed decisions about
    resource use, and identify crop problems early on. This improves sustainability
    and creates a deeper comprehension of the link between farming and land (Idoje
    et al., 2021, Ojha et al., 2015). Technology in agriculture is essential for resource
    conservation, reducing the environmental effect of farming operations, and feeding
    the world''s population. With the advent of the digital age, sophisticated technologies
    are replacing old farming techniques. These systems provide enormous quantities
    of data that may be used to optimize resources used and boost agricultural output.
    Hence, the use of technology and data-driven decision-making in agriculture will
    boost productivity, decrease waste, and protect the planet''s natural resources
    (Weersink et al., 2018, Khan et al., 2021). Agriculture, not only plays a crucial
    part in providing food security and sustainability, but it also significantly
    contributes to a nation''s economic development (Beckman and Countryman, 2021).
    As was already established, agriculture has a big influence on a country''s GDP.
    1.3. Agriculture, economic, innovative technology, scope, and possible potential
    of the paper In reality, throughout history, agriculture has been a key factor
    in the economic success of numerous nations. In rural regions, especially agriculture,
    not only produces food but also, opens doors to employment. For farmers and those
    who work in the agricultural value chain, such as processors, marketers, and exporters,
    it is a significant source of revenue. As a result, agriculture has the ability
    to promote economic expansion, reduce poverty, and improve living conditions.
    Investments in innovative agriculture technology have the potential to accelerate
    economic growth. Farmers can boost their earnings, produce more food with fewer
    resources, and open new markets for their goods with the aid of modern agricultural
    systems and smart technology (Bathaei and Štreimikienė, 2023, Blakeney, 2022).
    In light of the economic considerations and the imperative to optimize the use
    of this vital resource, the implementation of computerized smart systems in North
    Africa and worldwide has become crucial (Assouli et al., 2018). The proposed paper
    presents an advanced smart irrigation system that aims to revolutionize agricultural
    efficiency and increase yields. With a broad scope that includes innovative irrigation
    technologies and cutting-edge technological applications such as the Internet
    of Things, cloud computing, and embedded system, the paper focuses on improving
    food security. Through potential stability and the promotion of sustainable agricultural
    practices, the study also envisages a future in agriculture contributing to the
    promotion of global food stability. 1.4. Intelligent irrigation – internet, deep
    Learning, Machine Learning, and motivation of this work The intelligent irrigation,
    utilizing state-of-the-art technology like Internet-integrated systems, plays
    a pivotal role in collecting precise data (such as temperature, humidity, and
    soil moisture), this helps in demonstrating its effectiveness in practical applications,
    and facilitating remote control (Rahman et al., 2020, Pramanik et al., 2022, Abba
    et al., 2019, Munir et al., 2021). Consequently, the utilization of the Internet
    in recent years reflects significant advancements in integrated systems, particularly
    in developed nations, leading to remarkable improvements in water conservation
    and production efficiency (Abi Saab et al., 2019, Pasika and Gandla, 2020). Additionally,
    the emergence of cutting-edge technologies such as deep learning, machine learning,
    and artificial intelligence in agriculture contributes further to the maintenance
    and boost of the outcome (Talaviya et al., 2020, Saleem et al., 2021, Subeesh
    and Mehta, 2021). Motivated by global food security concerns, this research focuses
    on irrigation. Meeting the food needs of a growing population while preserving
    water resources is of paramount importance. Current traditional irrigation practices
    affect yields and food security. The study proposes an intelligent irrigation
    system that integrates IoT and cloud technologies. This innovation makes it possible
    to conserve water efficiently, increase yields, and feed crops well. With broad
    global application, this approach advances smart farming, helping to improve food
    security and sustainability. 1.5. Smart irrigation, Internet of Things, ThingSpeak,
    and focus of this work Numerous cutting-edge technologies, including the IoT,
    have broad applications. It is hard for farmers to personally visit and monitor
    every part of the farms they oversee, which might result in inconsistent watering.
    Losses in money and poor crop quality are consequently a result of this. In order
    to solve this problem and streamline the agricultural process, the research papers
    (Ayaz et al., 2019, Habib et al., 2023), suggest an intelligent irrigation system
    that makes use of cutting-edge IoT technology. These studies (Kamienski et al.,
    2019, García et al., 2020), also introduce the concept of “smart agriculture,”
    which makes use of data technology to increase agricultural output and raise the
    overall quality. Furthermore, the mentioned works (Pathak et al., 2019, Ndunagu
    et al., 2022), make use of the ThingSpeak platform, which provides a complete
    solution for gathering and storing data acquired from agricultural sensors and
    controllers, to meet the needs of farm operators. This portal is a useful resource
    for collecting and preserving important agricultural data. Wireless sensor networks
    are utilized by these papers while creating autonomous plants. By using a smart
    irrigation system, irrigation settings may be managed automatically (Tiglao et
    al., 2020, Lloret et al., 2021, Zervopoulos et al., 2020, Morchid et al., 2022,
    Morchid et al., 2021). In these studies (Olisa et al., 2021, Hussen Hajjaj et
    al., 2020, Hanan et al., 2019, Tham et al., 2022), a water level sensor was utilized.
    Specifically, The HC-SR04 device of the real-time water level monitoring system
    is used to accurately measure the water level as a key component. Further, this
    study presented a review of applications of IoT and sensor technology to increase
    food security and agricultural sustainability (Morchid et al., 2024). The focus
    of this study is to provide a smart irrigation system that that would use cloud
    computing and embedded IoT technologies to optimize water utilization and make
    sure plants get the right quantity of water. The research shows how this method
    might increase agricultural yields, decrease water waste, and assist offset the
    problem of food security. The system''s feasibility for application in many places
    around the world is also emphasized in this paper, supporting the progress of
    smart agriculture. 1.6. Main contribution of this work The main contribution of
    this paper is expressed as follows. Fig. 1 also shows the graphical abstract of
    the proposed scheme based on these contributions. • A smart irrigation system

    Paper framework of the paper. 2. Architecture of the proposed scheme Smart irrigation
    systems gather information on soil moisture and other parameters using several
    IoT devices and sensors. These sensors can detect the moisture content of the
    soil, temperature, humidity, and even water level. They can also capture images
    of the crops to track their development and general health. Remote control of
    an irrigation system using data obtained from sensors and wireless communication
    with a cloud-based platform for analysis. The data is processed and analyzed on
    a cloud-based platform which makes use of models and algorithms to find the best
    watering plan depending on the information gathered. The irrigation system is
    connected to a small computer called an embedded board which can regulate the
    irrigation system''s water flow depending on instructions. Through a mobile application,
    farmers can access and monitor the system, which gives them real-time information
    on the soil moisture, weather, and irrigation schedule. Through the app, they
    may manually operate the irrigation system or modify the watering schedule. Farmers
    can increase agricultural yields and optimize irrigation thanks to this. As it
    only supplies the crops with the water they require, this technology also conserves
    water resources and lowers expenses. Furthermore, crop planning and research may
    be done using the data gathered by the smart irrigation system. Farmers, for instance,
    might spot trends in crop growth and pinpoint the perfect circumstances for a
    certain crop by examining data collected over time. Future agricultural yield
    optimization and crop planting schedule decisions may both be made using this
    knowledge. In the context of smart irrigation, wireless sensor networks (WSNs)
    enable autonomous plant management through functions such as environmental monitoring,
    nutrient management, disease detection, automated irrigation, and communications.
    Wireless sensor networks provide real-time data on factors such as temperature,
    humidity, soil moisture, water level, and nutrient levels. They support adaptive
    control systems, use low-power nodes for greater energy efficiency, and enable
    remote monitoring and control through cloud integration. Overall, WSNs contribute
    to the creation of autonomous plants by facilitating data-driven decision-making
    and optimizing plant conditions to improve crop productivity and sustainability.
    On the other hand, the integration of various sensors into WSNs is essential for
    plant autonomy. The most common sensors are those measuring temperature, humidity,
    soil moisture, light, nutrients, pests, water levels, and wind. Collectively,
    these sensors help improve plant-related processes. The integration of various
    sensors improves the accuracy and efficiency of autonomous plant management systems,
    enabling informed decisions to be made to improve crop productivity and sustainability.
    2.1. The architecture of the system This section describes the structure of the
    smart irrigation system shown in Fig. 3. The system is made up of three essential
    parts: IoT devices, cloud computing, and application interface. Internet connectivity
    enables consumers from all around the world to view and track their farm data.

    Fig. 3. The smart irrigation system''s IoT architecture. The irrigation system
    is an automated electronic system that is intended to efficiently manage irrigation
    scheduling. Its primary goal is to accommodate the changing needs of plants as
    they develop. Through the analysis of soil moisture content, the system determines
    the precise percentage of water necessary for irrigation, ensuring accurate scheduling
    for various agricultural seasons and crop varieties. The key aims of smart irrigation
    encompass optimizing water consumption to reduce costs, enhancing agricultural
    productivity, benefiting farms, fostering energy efficiency, and ensuring food
    security through utilizing new technologies like the IoT, cloud computing, embedded
    systems, and sensors. The IoT architecture of the proposed system, shown in Fig.
    3, comprises three fundamental components: (1) IoT devices, (2) cloud computing,
    and (3) the application interface. The components of IoT devices include sensors,
    actuators, a control unit, and a gateway, among others. These sensors are in charge
    of monitoring critical environmental factors including air humidity, air temperature,
    soil moisture, and water level within the smart farm. The soil moisture sensor
    is used to measure the soil moisture content. In addition, the DHT22 device, which
    is famous for its accuracy, was used, which is a two-in-one combined sensor to
    measure humidity and temperature. In addition, the HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance
    sensor is used to detect water levels. The ESP32 microcontroller-powered control
    unit receives sensor readings and coordinates the actuators to make sure that
    the plants are watered on schedule. The ESP32 microcontroller is appropriate for
    larger-scale applications since it has adequate memory capacity and improved processing
    capability. The smart irrigation system''s actuators are essential for carrying
    out instructions from the ESP32 controller. In our system, a water sprinkler is
    used to water the plants, and a water pump is used to fill the tank. The next
    development in the IoT device architecture is the addition of a gateway. The gateway
    gathers sensed data from the control unit and carries out critical data processing
    operations to enable intelligent aggregation, optimize network traffic, and lower
    energy consumption. It effectively bundles the essential components of the particular
    process model and sends them to the cloud, leading to appreciable decreases in
    latency and costs at higher levels. The data is continually processed by conventional
    cloud computing systems when it is received from the gateway. Cloud computing
    is the focus of our system architecture''s second component. Farmers now have
    access to a huge variety of data that was gathered through the control unit and
    delivered over the gateway console, thanks to this layer. Farmers may gather,
    view, and analyze real-time data streams by utilizing the cloud-based IoT analytics
    platform ThingSpeak. ThingSpeak is a complete data management platform that enables
    farmers to design unique data visualizations using their own technology. The platform
    allows for the collection, visualization, analysis, and derivation of useful insights
    from live data streams. Using the ThingSpeak platform to post data or the ThingView
    app to retrieve data, farmers may communicate with the system. The irrigation
    system architecture is completed by the application interface, often known as
    the front layer. Results of data processing, such as soil moisture, humidity,
    temperature, and water level, are shown in this user-facing component. Farmers
    may get real-time data visualizations using ThingSpeak and use the knowledge to
    guide their decisions. This interface makes it possible for the farmer and the
    system to communicate seamlessly, which makes it easier to monitor and manage
    the irrigation systems. 2.2. Calibration of the water level In this section, the
    sensor calibration method is employed in the proposed work. The HC SR04 device
    was utilized to measure the water level. Several studies (Olisa et al., 2021,
    Hussen Hajjaj et al., 2020, Hanan et al., 2019, Tham et al., 2022), have employed
    an ultrasonic sensor to determine the water level. However, these papers did not
    provide a mathematical calculation for the calibration procedure of the ultrasonic
    sensor used to measure the water level. In the proposed study, a calibration technique
    is utilized to study the water level sensor. This technique involves a linear
    interpolation function, referred to as the water level sensor calibration, which
    establishes a relationship between the sensor''s values and the corresponding
    water level. (1) expresses this relationship in a linear formula. Specifically,
    when the maximum value of the sensor is represented in centimeters, the minimum
    value corresponds to the %, and vice versa. Fig. 4 visually illustrates this relationship
    between the sensor''s values and the water level in %. Download : Download high-res
    image (183KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Architecture of the
    water level calibration. The calibration process was used to accurately adjust
    the input of the ultrasonic sensor. The sensor is connected to the ESP32 Microcontroller
    for seamless integration and data processing. During the system startup, we obtain
    synchronized sensor data for a duration of 2 sec. Subsequently, we conduct a thorough
    analysis of the system, focusing on the highest and lowest values of the sensor
    readings. The HC-SR04 device is capable of measuring distances ranging from 2
    cm to 400 cm. Equation (1) represents the mathematical interpolation function
    used to detect the water level in percentages, such as 5 %, 30 %, etc. This linear
    interpolation representation of our proposed system is as follows: (1) In the
    given linear interpolation (1), the variables used are defined as follows: Y:
    Output of the water level in %. X: Input of the water level in cm. m: Coefficient.
    P: Zero adjustment. The coefficient may be computed as in equation (2) if we assume
    that the difference between the highest and minimum values is equal to the h2
    described in equation (3). Consequently, level Y is equal to 1 when X is equal
    to the maximum value (Max). Further context or computation can be used to calculate
    the value of P, which represents zero adjustments as flow in equation (4). (2)
    (3) (4) In the proposed paper, it has been determined that the maximum distance
    in the water tank is 25 cm, and the minimum reading is h1 = 5 cm. Therefore, based
    equation (3) the difference between the maximum and minimum values (h2) is calculated
    as h2 = Max - Min = 25 cm − 5 cm = 20 cm. Using this information, the coefficient
    (m) can be calculated as m = -99/h2 = −99/20 = −4.95. (4) is obtained as follows:
    (4) For instance, if X  = Min = h1 = 5 cm, the value of the water level (Y) will
    be 99 %. On the other hand, if X  = Max = 25 cm, the water level value will be
    0 %. The discussion of this study towards the linear interpolation has important
    implications for sustainable agriculture, smart irrigation systems, and food security.
    This representation permits precise detection of water levels at various places
    in a tank or reservoir by creating a link between the values of the water level
    sensor and corresponding percentages. This interpolation may be used by smart
    irrigation systems to optimize water use and enhance agricultural operations.
    Farmers and system controllers can plan irrigation and manage water resources
    more effectively by continually monitoring the water levels. The system can deliver
    the proper quantity of water to crops using this real-time data, preventing over-
    or under-irrigation. This strategy offers two advantages. Firstly, it promotes
    sustainability and ensures that just the appropriate amount of water is delivered,
    therefore conserving water resources. Secondly, the representation helps to preserve
    crop health and production, enhancing food security, by precisely determining
    water levels. According to the mathematical calibration technique presented in
    this article, integrating linear interpolation into the smart irrigation system
    offers significant advantages. The accuracy of the water level sensor is significantly
    increased by this mathematical calibration technique, providing reliable information
    for making informed irrigation decisions. By enabling the system to accurately
    assess soil moisture levels, thereby reducing the risks associated with over-
    or under-watering, the use of linear interpolation improves overall irrigation
    planning. In particular, by reducing water wastage and complying with sustainable
    farming methods, this strategy improves resource efficiency. Linearization also
    improves accuracy. In addition, the approach increases the reliability of data-driven
    decision-making of the smart irrigation system, which in turn fosters stakeholder
    confidence in the accuracy of the system to make well-informed and effective management
    decisions. Linear interpolation effectively optimizes agricultural operations
    by precisely calibrating the sensors, particularly water level sensors, in the
    smart irrigation system presented in this paper. This enhancement enables better
    irrigation scheduling, guaranteeing accurate soil moisture measurements and reducing
    water wastage. The result is greater resource efficiency, in line with sustainable
    practices. What''s more, improved precision has a positive impact on crop productivity,
    promoting plant health and increasing overall agricultural output. This section
    includes a method for calibrating the water level sensor that will provide farmers
    with accurate results. This calibration technique optimizes the possibilities
    of seamless and secure soil irrigation management by facilitating effective process
    control. This strategy differs noticeably from the approaches put forward by authors
    (Olisa et al., 2021, Hussen Hajjaj et al., 2020). 3. Algorithm and V-model of
    the proposed scheme The algorithmic aspect of the proposed approach comprises
    three essential elements. It begins with a visual flowchart illustrating how the
    method works. Next, it explains the process of accessing the ESP32 station and
    establishing a Wi-Fi connection. Finally, it presents the pseudo-code, details
    of the system equipment, and V Model. This combination of algorithmic representation
    and equipment information is a valuable resource for researchers, developers,
    and enthusiasts who want to understand how the system works. 3.1. Flow chart of
    the proposed scheme The smart irrigation system algorithm created particularly
    for smart agriculture is shown in detail in Fig. 5. The algorithm encompasses
    all stages of the software code, beginning with the initialization of the sensors
    and ending with the display of sensors data on both the ThingSpeak platform and
    the ThingView application. Download : Download high-res image (369KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Flow chart of the proposed smart irrigation
    system. The initialization of the temperature, humidity, moisture, and water level
    sensors is the first step in our system''s flow chart in order to get correct
    values from these sensors. The sensor parameters are adjusted as needed after
    initialization to ensure accurate readings. Next, the system checks if the ESP32
    microcontroller, the ESP32 used in the system, is connected to the ThingSpeak
    cloud. If not, the system tries connection with the cloud. Additionally, the sensor
    data is printed on the console for monitoring purposes. For the moisture sensor,
    if the reading falls below 40 %, indicating a low moisture level in the soil,
    the watering pump (W-Pump) is activated, and the green LED indicator is turned
    on. Conversely, if the reading exceeds 40 %, the pump remains switched off. The
    DHT22 sensor, responsible for measuring air temperature and humidity, continuously
    reads the values every 2 s while checking for any potential errors. If the temperature
    reading exceeds 45 °C, indicating a high temperature, the yellow LED is illuminated;
    otherwise, the yellow LED remains off. In the case of the water level sensor,
    if the reading indicates a level below 10 %, indicating a low water level in the
    tank, the tank pump (T-Pump) is activated, and the red LED is turned on. Conversely,
    if the reading is above 10 %, the tank pump remains off, and the red LED remains
    unlit. Every 2 s, the suggested smart irrigation system''s data is updated (2S).
    On the LCD, the sensors'' whole output is shown in real time. The system also
    instantly transmits all sensor data to the ThingSpeak cloud and ThingView app.
    In order to provide accurate and current information on the system''s performance,
    the data is updated every 2 s. Overall, this Smart Irrigation System makes sure
    that plants and crops receive enough water, and it runs well with little assistance
    from humans. In addition, this flow chart makes sure that the sensors are working
    properly, checks their readings, and initiates the required actions in response
    to predetermined thresholds, as shown by the activation of pumps and indicators.
    3.2. Accessing ESP32 station and Wi-Fi connection process 3.2.1. Accessing ESP32
    station The embedded system (ESP32) is typically linked to a wireless router,
    which acts as an access point for the ESP32 to connect to the local network in
    these situations. In most cases, the ESP32 is set up as a station, enabling it
    to connect to the router and access the network. In this setup, we would need
    toc be connected to the same local network as the ESP32 in order to control it.
    This implies that we may operate the ESP32 from any device that is also linked
    to the same network, such as IoT embedded systems (including other ESP32 devices),
    IoT gateways (which may include routers), and IoT terminals like PCs or smartphones
    as illustrated in Fig. 6. Our system can access and manage the ESP32 from anywhere
    in the range of that network as long as these devices are linked to it. Download

    accompanying flow chart serves as an illustration of the methodical flow that
    the design process for creating a Wi-Fi connection adheres to. The ESP32 microcontroller
    is initially initialized to guarantee good operation. The system then confirms
    that the microcontroller is effectively linked to a Wi-Fi network. The information
    is swiftly and in real-time delivered to the ThingSpeak cloud platform after the
    connection has been verified. As shown in Fig. 7, this guarantees that all sensor-generated
    data is easily accessed and shown on the ThingSpeak platform and the associated
    ThingView application. Download : Download high-res image (198KB) Download : Download

    and equipment of the system In order to program, develop, and visualize the algorithm''s
    structure, the pseudo-code is supplied below. The algorithm for the suggested
    irrigation system is shown in Table 1. This pseudo-code defines the simulation
    of intelligent irrigation based on an embedded system that monitors environmental
    conditions, controls pumps, and communicates with the cloud (The ThingSpeak platform
    and the ThingView application). It starts by defining constants for the different
    thresholds in lines 1–2. The program uses variables to represent sensor readings,
    pump states, and connection status in lines 3–11. Initialise built-in devices
    such as ESP32 and sensors in lines 12–13. Table 1. Algorithm 1. Pseudo-code of

    moisture, water level) are (1) simulated, although actual sensor data is used
    in practice. (2) The humidity sensor reading is calibrated on a percentage scale.
    (3) The water level is calculated by linear interpolation. (4) The simulated data
    is sent to the cloud platforms (ThingSpeak and ThingView) for visualization and
    analysis. (5) The state of the connection to the cloud is simulated. (6) Control
    logic evaluates humidity and water levels to determine pump conditions. (7) Pump
    control flags (TonWP, ToffWP, TonTP, ToffTP) are set based on the control logic
    conditions. (8) A simulation delay has been introduced between iterations. The
    code uses placeholder functions to read sensors, set values, and check connectivity
    to the cloud. These functions need to be implemented to interact with real devices
    and services. In general, this pseudo-code demonstrates the logic of the system
    that collects sensor data, communicates with the cloud (ThingSpeak and ThingView),
    and controls pumps according to predefined thresholds. Table 2 briefly gives the
    hardware components used in this design, and explains the particular uses for
    which it was used. It includes the controllers, sensors, pumps, and other devices
    used in this system. Table 2. The equipment of the system. Sr. no Hardware Functions
    1. ESP32 Microcontroller The ESP32 is a flexible microcontroller with a variety
    of features and capabilities. It may be used in combination with a host MCU as
    a secondary device or as an independent system. Reduced communication stack overhead
    on the main application processor is one of its main benefits. The ESP32 can also
    communicate with other systems, allowing the inclusion of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi
    features via SPI/SDIO or I2C/UART interfaces. Because of its adaptability, the
    ESP32 is a potent tool for several applications. 2. DHT22 (AM2302) It is a two-in-one
    combination sensor for measuring ambient air humidity and temperature, all with
    high accuracy. 3. Soil Moisture Sensor A device used to detect moisture or water
    content in the soil. Farmers and gardeners use the information to make informed
    decisions about watering and watering schedules by gaining vital insight into
    soil moisture content. 4. HC-SR04 – Ultrasonic Distance Sensor The device is used
    to measure and monitor the water level within a tank, giving vital data for effective
    water management. 5. Tank Pump The tank pump was employed to recharge the tank
    when it became empty. This device contributes to the system''s continued operating
    effectiveness and offers a dependable water source for irrigation needs. 6. Watering
    Pump The watering pump is responsible for irrigating the soil by delivering water
    to the plants 7. Relay_1 A relay was utilized to activate the tank pump for tank
    refilling when it becomes empty. 8. Relay_2 A relay was used to control the watering
    pump responsible for soil irrigation. 9. Power Supply Powering all of the system''s
    components with electrical energy is the power source''s main duty. This power
    source acts as the system''s main energy source, supplying each component with
    the energy it needs to operate properly, including the sensors, actuators, controllers,
    and communication modules. By providing dependable power, the system can function
    without interruption, making it possible to complete activities like data gathering,
    processing, and communication successfully. 3.4. V Model of the smart irrigation
    system A crucial element of our approach is the integration of sensor and control
    system data into the V model, which guides the development of the best irrigation
    program. Within the framework of the V model, which is a software development
    methodology, we have created an intelligent irrigation system exploiting the IoT
    and an integrated board such as the ESP32. This board transmits data to the cloud,
    including platforms such as ThingSpeak, and enables remote monitoring via the
    ThingView application. As shown in Fig. 8 the exact ways to apply the V model,
    in this case, are as follows: (1) Requirements Gathering and Analysis: The requirements
    for the system are gathered and examined at this stage of the V Model. This involves
    identifying the system''s users, such as farmers and agricultural engineers, their
    requirements and goals (such as automating irrigation based on weather and soil
    conditions and sending data to the cloud for remote monitoring and analysis),
    as well as any limitations that must be taken into account (such as cost, and
    compatibility with existing equipment). (2) System Design: The system architecture
    and general design are developed at this stage. This entails a choice of sensors
    to track soil moisture, temperature, and water level, an embedded board such as
    ESP32 to collect and process sensor data, and a wireless communication module
    such as Wi-Fi to transmit sensor data to a remote server or a cloud-based platform
    such as ThingSpeak. Designing the control system that will be used to create the
    ideal irrigation schedule is also part of this phase. (3) Implementation: The
    integration of sensor and control system data into the Model V is a crucial step
    in the implementation of our intelligent irrigation system. At this stage, the
    system is activated, the control system is configured and the integrated board,
    such as the ESP32, is programmed. A connection to the cloud is established, enabling
    the irrigation system to be monitored and operated remotely. It''s important to
    note that this phase also includes the integration of sensor data into the control
    system, enabling the best irrigation program to be determined. The code practice
    for sending sensor data to the ThingSpeak cloud platform is also implemented during
    this stage. This seamless integration of components guarantees optimum system
    efficiency, enabling precise, responsive management of the irrigation program
    according to environmental conditions and specific crop needs. (4) Verification:
    To make sure the system satisfies the criteria established in step one, this stage
    entails testing it. Functional testing, performance testing, and integration testing
    are all part of this. The communication between the embedded board and the ThingSpeak
    cloud platform as well as the communication between the embedded board and the
    remote server or cloud-based platform are both tested at this stage. (5) Maintenance:
    The deployment of the system and any required upkeep and upgrades are done in
    this final phase of the V Model. This stage also entails keeping an eye on the
    system''s operation and making any required modifications. Additionally, it entails
    testing the connectivity, upgrading the firmware, and making sure that new software
    versions are compatible. This stage also entails keeping an eye on the information
    transmitted to ThingSpeak and resolving any transmission problems. Download :

    proposed Smart Irrigation System, including its results and efficiency compared
    to existing scientific papers. We also look at how the system affects agricultural
    sustainability and how it helps provide food security. The innovation of this

    such as temperature and humidity. Data is provided securely regularly, simulating
    sensor updates in real-time, using the MQTT protocol for communication. Cloud
    platforms can be configured to accurately visualize data using graphs and charts,
    enabling real-time monitoring and analysis, just like with field data. 4.1. Experimental
    results The experimental results of the proposed irrigation system are presented
    in Table 3. The table provides continuous measurements of various parameters including
    soil moisture, temperature, and humidity, as well as outputs from the water level
    sensor in centimeters and the water level in percentages. These measurements were
    recorded over a period of seven days. Additionally, Table 3 includes information
    on the status of data transmission to the platform and app, indicating whether
    the data was successfully sent, and the response time of 2 s. It should be noted
    that the weather conditions during the data collection period were normal, with
    no rainfall. These comprehensive measurements provide valuable insights into the
    performance of the smart system, showcasing the variations in soil moisture, temperature,
    humidity, and water level over the seven-day period. Such data is critical for
    optimizing irrigation strategies and ensuring efficient water management in agricultural
    practices. Cloud computing, in particular the integration of the MathWorks laboratory
    into the ThingSpeak platform of our intelligent irrigation system, improves data
    storage, analysis, and irrigation control decision-making through scalable storage,
    remote access to all data, and real-time analytics on ThingSpeak. This contributes
    to cost-effectiveness, improved security, collaborative management, reliability,
    efficient data processing, collaborative decision-making, and good results. Table

    presents a method for calibrating the moisture sensor used in the research. To
    calibrate the moisture sensor input, a two-point calibration method was used in
    the studies (Ndunagu et al., 2022, Tiglao et al., 2020). Moisture sensor data
    were taken during the first 2 s of the system loop, indicating the lowest and
    maximum predicted values of the readings. The function moisture = map (moisture,
    4095, 2413, 0, 100) was used to do a two-point calibration on the moisture sensor''s
    natural outputs. The function mapping approach is used in the demonstration section
    to calibrate the humidity sensor. A few configurations must be made before the
    ESP32 Microcontroller can be started. The moisture sensor''s minimum and maximum
    readings are defined specifically. Values for the moisture sensor vary from a
    minimum of 4095 to a high of 2413. A function is used to transform the sensor
    value from 0 % to 100 %, with 100 % indicating the maximum value, in order to
    make the reading procedure easier for consumers. The user-friendly interpretation
    of the sensor readings is ensured by this change. Two-point calibration is of
    significant importance in the calibration process of the moisture sensor of our
    intelligent irrigation system. This method involves calibrating the sensor to
    two different moisture levels, typically representing the extremes of the moisture
    spectrum. The importance of using a two-point calibration method lies in its ability
    to improve accuracy, account for variability in soil conditions, account for dynamic
    moisture ranges and allow customization for specific agricultural applications.
    This meticulous calibration approach is fundamental to ensuring the efficiency
    of the smart irrigation system in optimizing water. 4.2. Results on the platform
    in real-time The ThingSpeak cloud receives data obtained by our system. So we
    can use our mobile app or our PC to obtain or download it for free using the platform
    ThingSpeak or the app ThingView. Fig. 9 shows some farm temperature readings displayed
    on the ThingSpeak. The farm owner can now connect to the cloud and see the graphical
    output to check the status of the farm. The maximum value of the temperature read
    is 25.5 °C, and the minimum value is 24.9 °C. On the ThingSpeak platform, Fig.
    10 displays some on-farm air humidity data. The maximum value of the humidity
    read is 35.00 % and the minimum value is 39.4 %. The farm owner may now connect
    to the cloud and examine the farm''s status using the graphical output. Download

    farm is shown in Fig. 11 on ThingSpeak. It shows that the soil was initially dry.
    When the water pump was turned on, the moisture sensor registered around 80 %.
    The range of soil moisture measured ranged from 0 % to 82 %. On the other hand,
    Fig. 12 illustrates how the water level was around 80 % when the irrigation water
    pump was switched on, which caused the water storage to be depleted. The data
    from the moisture sensors combined with the observations of the water level sheds
    light on the dynamic interaction between soil moisture levels, water pump performance,
    and water storage management and offers useful insights into the irrigation process.
    These findings support wise agricultural practices by enabling informed decision-making
    and effective water resource management. Download : Download high-res image (89KB)

    real-time. Every 2 s, the ESP32 microcontroller sends data on the temperature,
    humidity, soil moisture, and water level to the ThingSpeak IoT analytics platform.
    The farmer may easily access this information via the ThingSpeak channel, giving
    them a simple and precise way to keep an eye on their field. Additionally, the
    data may be exported to an Excel document using the ThingSpeak channel''s “export
    recent data” function, enabling additional analysis and investigation. Additionally,
    an application called ThingView, which is available for free download from the
    Google Play Store, makes it simple to retrieve the data from ThingSpeak on mobile
    devices. The farm owner may remotely access all the data with this smartphone
    application, making it simple and convenient to manage the irrigation system.
    The use of this smart irrigation system is essential because it guarantees precise
    and timely irrigation of agricultural plants, creating the ideal environment for
    plant growth. The field or farm owner''s overall farming experience is considerably
    improved by this method. Further, implementing our smart irrigation system requires
    a high level of technical expertise. The system is designed and implemented by
    specialists before being delivered to farmers. Farmers, meanwhile, benefit from
    a ready-to-use system that requires a minimum of technical knowledge for daily
    operations. The graphical display of the smart irrigation system includes needle
    values that represent the real-time sensor data. Colored sections can be applied
    to various measurement sites (widgets) to improve clarity. A red number on the
    water sensor in the tank, which indicates that the water level is critically low,
    is an example of how red color is used to indicate danger. As illustrated in Fig.
    13, the green color denotes no problems, whereas the yellow color stands in the
    center of problems and no problems, indicating the start of a potentially troublesome
    period. The solution also enables tracking of channel locations and particular
    modifications to channel content. In order to do this, a channel sitemap is created,
    which details the placement of feed data. By inputting the latitude and longitude
    coordinates in the “Channel settings” tab of the channel view, the channel location
    may be displayed. The channel map of our system is shown in Fig. 14, which gives
    a summary of the data''s spatial distribution. These functions and visual representations
    help users gain a deeper knowledge of the system''s data, making it simpler for
    them to recognize urgent circumstances and efficiently monitor channel content.

    plants demands close attention. Our Smart Irrigation System seeks to solve this
    by providing an accurate study to guarantee timely and effective plant watering.

    of observation and testing, it is possible to quantify and demonstrate the decrease
    in water use compared to traditional irrigation techniques. Table 4 may be used
    to show how our intelligent irrigation system, which is based on the IoT and embedded
    technology, lowers the water level: Table 4. Calculated the water usage decrease.1
    System Period Water level (%) Traditional 10 days 100 % Smart Irrigation (IoT)
    10 days 30 % 1 IoT is the acronym of the internet of things. The information gathered
    from the conventional and smart irrigation systems was then compared and examined.
    By subtracting the quantity of water used in a smart irrigation system from the
    amount used in a traditional irrigation system and dividing the result by the
    amount used in a conventional irrigation system, the decrease in water consumption
    can be computed. The water usage of the area''s conventional irrigation system
    should first be monitored and documented. The amount of water utilized during
    a particular time period in this paper''s 10 days was measured using sensors.
    The next step is to install and set up a smart irrigation system based on IoT
    and embedded devices. The system has sensors that can monitor temperature, humidity,
    and other environmental variables including humidity, temperature, moisture, and
    water level. An expected 10-day testing and monitoring period are used to compare
    the smart irrigation system to the conventional irrigation system. The same measurements
    and records are utilized to determine how much water is consumed in a smart irrigation
    system as in a traditional irrigation system. The water level decrease is calculated
    by taking the water level used by the traditional irrigation system (100 %) and
    subtracting the water level used by the smart irrigation system (30 %). The result
    is (100–30)/100, which equals 0.7 or 70 % of the original water level. Reducing
    irrigation water consumption by more than 70 % faces challenges such as potential
    impacts on crops, environmental considerations, climate change adaptation, effective
    soil moisture management, technological limitations, and farmer education. This
    research successfully transforms conventional methodologies by articulating a
    breakthrough in irrigation accuracy and efficiency. It presents a smart irrigation
    system that combines cloud computing, embedded systems, and the IoT. It makes
    use of state-of-the-art sensors, such as DHT22 and water level sensors coupled
    to ESP32, for data transfer to the cloud and real-time monitoring. The accuracy
    and operating efficiency of water-level sensors are enhanced by a new mathematical
    function called linear interpolation. By using 70 % less water, the system that
    has been put in place is in line with environmentally beneficial standards. The
    study explores more general implications for agricultural sustainability and worldwide
    food security, highlighting significant advancements in accuracy and efficacy
    achieved by the suggested smart irrigation system. 4.5. Comparison and discussion
    Table 5 provides a comparative analysis of various IoT-based water use monitoring
    systems, highlighting key functionalities, devices, Parameters, calibration approaches,
    v-models, and their ability to reduce water consumption. The articles included

    (Pramanik et al., 2022) focuses on an IoT-based water usage monitoring system
    using the Croplytics platform with Arduino Uno, LoRa devices, and a GSM model.
    In comparison, our paper (PS) differs by using the ThingSpeak platform and ESP32
    device to monitor temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and water level. Unlike
    paper (Pramanik et al., 2022), our system incorporates sensor calibration, which
    improves data accuracy. In addition, your paper introduces the V Model software
    and helps to reduce water consumption by 70 %, presenting a more advanced and
    comprehensive approach to water conservation. The authors of this work (Abba et
    al., 2019), present an IoT system using Arduino Uno and ThingSpeak to monitor
    humidity, temperature, and soil moisture. Our paper (PS) goes further by using
    ESP32 to improve data collection, covering additional parameters (water level)
    and incorporating sensor calibration for soil moisture and water level measurements.
    This increases the accuracy and reliability of your system''s data. In addition,
    our integration of V Model software and the successful reduction in water consumption
    underlines the depth of our approach beyond what work (Abba et al., 2019) offers.
    The authors of this study (Munir et al., 2021), focus on a water consumption monitoring
    system based on an Android platform with GSM and Arduino Uno models. In contrast,
    our proposed scheme (PS) uses the ESP32 device via the ThingSpeak platform. Our
    system (PS) measures temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and water level, providing
    a wider range of data points compared to the study (Munir et al., 2021). The addition
    of sensor calibration and V Model software to our (PS) study improves the accuracy
    and robustness of our solution. On the other hand, the authors of this study (Pasika
    et al., 2020), presented an Arduino Mega-based system using ThingSpeak to monitor
    soil pH, turbidity, temperature, humidity, and water level. Our PS extends its
    capabilities by using the ESP32 to monitor temperature, humidity, soil moisture,
    and water level. The integration of sensor calibration, Model V software, and
    a 70 % reduction in water consumption in our PS system represent developments
    beyond the scope of this study (Pasika et al., 2020). The authors (García et al.,
    2020), presented a research paper in 2020 related to a study of the latest smart
    irrigation techniques to determine the factors observed in existing systems. This
    paper does not use the realisation of the irrigation system including the integration
    of sensors and embedded systems to drive the irrigation. However, our PS use of
    ESP32, full parameter coverage, sensor calibration, V Model software, and reduced
    water consumption contributes to a more sophisticated and impactful system than
    suggested by the study (García et al., 2020). The authors [29] presented a paper
    focusing on temperature, humidity, and soil moisture monitoring using ATMega328
    and NRF24L01. Our PS features by integrating an ESP32 to monitor temperature,
    humidity, soil moisture, and water level via ThingSpeak. The inclusion of sensor
    calibration, Model V software, and a significant reduction in water consumption
    improve the robustness and efficiency of our solution beyond that proposed in
    the study (Tiglao et al., 2020). The studies conducted by the authors (Abba et
    al., 2019, Tiglao et al., 2020), employed the DHT11 device for temperature and
    humidity measurements. However, this sensor exhibits low accuracy when measuring
    temperatures above zero, rendering decimal value transfer unnecessary and impacting
    agricultural productivity. In contrast, our approach involved utilizing the DHT22
    device which offers the capability of measuring temperatures and humidity, with
    a precision of 0.1 units. This kind of sensor enables more precise and trustworthy
    readings, improving data accuracy and encouraging better agricultural results.
    Our intelligent irrigation system is based on the ESP32, known for its outstanding
    features such as low power consumption, ample memory, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and exceptional
    speed. Moreover, ESP32-based boards are cost-effective and offer analog and digital
    inputs and outputs, making them ideal tools for reading numerous analog input
    values in intelligent farming and Smart Irrigation Systems. The estimated total
    cost of the proposed intelligent irrigation system is approximately US $60, making
    it an affordable and cost-effective solution. This low-cost nature of the system
    aligns with our goal of providing a practical and accessible option, particularly
    for low-income farmers, in contrast to the methods described by the authors in
    systems (Pramanik et al., 2022, Abba et al., 2019). In contrast to conventional
    irrigation methods that rely on groundwater drainage and can lead to excessive
    water consumption and crop flooding, our system utilizes innovative technologies
    to provide precise and demand-based soil irrigation. By adapting to the specific
    water needs of the crops, our system has the potential to significantly reduce
    water usage by more than 70 %. This efficient and targeted approach ensures optimal
    resource utilization while promoting sustainable agriculture practices. None of
    the scientific papers referenced in this study have used the V model. In contrast,
    our paper which used the V model software design, presents a methodical and organized
    approach to software development, significantly improving the overall quality
    of our irrigation system. 4.6. Smart irrigation improves food security The use
    of the IoT, cloud computing, and other cutting-edge technologies in Smart Irrigation
    Systems can have a significant impact on food security as seen in the Fig. 16.
    Here are some of the ways this technology enhances food security: (1) Improved
    Crop Yields: By implementing intelligent irrigation systems based on IoT to provide
    crops with the right quantity of water at the right time, crop yields may be boosted.
    This can help ensure a steady supply of food by reducing the likelihood of crop
    failures caused by droughts or other environmental factors. (2) Improved Water
    Efficiency: Smart irrigation systems based on IoT use information from sensors
    and weather stations to choose the best irrigation schedule, reducing water waste
    and maximizing water efficiency. (3) Remote Access and Control: Through a mobile
    application, smart irrigation systems using IoT can be accessed and operated remotely,
    allowing farmers to check on and make adjustments to their irrigation systems
    even when they are not in their fields. Farmers who live in rural places or who
    have access issues owing to physical restrictions may find this to be of particular
    benefit. (4) Making Decisions Based on Data: Intelligent irrigation systems based
    on IoT gather a lot of information on soil moisture, weather, and crop growth.
    This information may be used to make better decisions about crop planning, irrigation
    schedules, and other aspects that impact crop yields. (5) Climate Change Adaptation:
    Smart irrigation systems based on IoT can assist farmers in adapting to the shifting
    weather patterns brought on by climate change. These devices can assist farmers
    in modifying their irrigation schedules and other management measures to take
    into account such as changes in temperature, precipitation, and other environmental
    factors by giving real-time data on soil moisture and meteorological conditions.

    on food security. In addition to increasing agricultural yields and water efficiency,
    these technologies also enable remote monitoring and data-driven decision-making,
    all of which may help ensure a more reliable food supply. This essay will examine
    how smart irrigation affects food security and how it may help maintain agriculture.
    The research paper highlighted smart irrigation systems as a groundbreaking approach
    to integrating new technologies like the IoT, embedded systems, and cloud computing.
    One notable innovation is the real-time data transmission to the ThingSpeak cloud
    and the visualization of the data through the ThingView app. This implementation
    allows for seamless monitoring and control of the irrigation system. By leveraging
    these technologies, the paper enables farmers and agricultural stakeholders to
    access vital information about soil moisture, temperature, and other environmental
    parameters in real-time. This innovation improves decision-making processes, enhances
    resource management, and promotes sustainable agricultural practices. The utilization
    of the ThingSpeak cloud and ThingView app for data visualization represents a
    significant advancement in smart agriculture, providing a user-friendly interface
    for efficient irrigation management. This paper presented a mathematical method
    for sensor calibration that brings innovation to the field by ensuring precise
    and reliable measurements. Additionally, the V model software design offers a
    systematic and structured approach to software development, enhancing the overall
    quality of our irrigation system. The paper focus on examining the impact of smart
    irrigation on food security. Better resource management in smart irrigation systems
    results in more sustainable, efficient, and environmentally friendly agricultural
    practices, with observable benefits in terms of water conservation, energy efficiency,
    crop yield, cost reduction, and overall agricultural sustainability. The analysis
    and interpretation of data in smart agriculture transforms the raw data of sensors
    into actionable information through many functions such as data cleaning and integration,
    application of advanced analytics, providing visual representations, interpreting
    models and providing real-time recommendations to farmers for informed decision-making
    and optimized farming practices. 5. Conclusion and future work In conclusion,
    the article proposed the concept of a “smart irrigation system using embedded
    Systems, IoT, and cloud computing” as an innovative solution to enhance food security
    and promote sustainable agriculture. By harnessing advanced technologies, this
    system aims to optimize irrigation practices, conserve water resources, and support
    long-term agricultural sustainability. The system makes use of cutting-edge technology
    like cloud computing, embedded system, and the IoT to provide real-time monitoring,
    control, and data analysis of irrigation operations. This system supervised real-time
    monitoring of crucial environmental factors such as moisture, humidity, temperature,
    and water levels in smart agriculture practices. The system used the ThingSpeak
    cloud to enable wireless communication between the device and the farm owner,
    enhancing their interaction. Furthermore, the ESP32 controller is linked to both
    a watering pump for soil irrigation and a water pump to refill the tank during
    low water levels. The automated control of the two water pumps is based on the
    readings of various environmental factors. Farmers can access comprehensive farm
    data from anywhere in the world as the sensor data is transmitted in real-time
    to both the ThingSpeak cloud and the ThingView application. This capability allows
    for more precise crop irrigation and increased production. Moreover, this will
    also present a mathematical-driven function known as linear interpolation to calibrate
    the water level sensor in percentage. This smart irrigation system was created
    using the V model software development approach. The solution suggested in this
    paper uses 70 % less water for soil irrigation than conventional techniques. In
    addition, this paper addressed the impact of smart irrigation using the latest
    technology on food security and its ability to support sustainable agriculture.
    The implementation of this smart irrigation system has the potential to revolutionize
    the agricultural sector, addressing key challenges and paving the way for a more
    secure and sustainable food production system. The future work of this paper involves
    integrating modern technologies and utilizing an MQTT broker to enhance the Smart
    Irrigation System. By merging multiple nodes, the system can handle increased
    data analysis and control elements for large-scale applications such as smart
    farms spanning thousands of hectares. The MQTT broker can further optimize irrigation
    strategies and resource management. On the other hand, future work of this paper
    will include the integration of the concept of smart agriculture within the framework
    of cyber-physical human systems. Declaration of competing interest The authors

    Predictive weather-based models are widely used to schedule irrigation through
    the estimation of crop evapotranspiration. However, perceiving real-time crop
    water requirements remains a challenge. This research aims at field validating
    and exploiting a low-cost IoT soil moisture tensiometer prototype to consequently
    compare weather-based irrigation to soil water moisture-based irrigation in terms
    of yield and crop water productivity. The prototype is based on the ESP32 microcontroller
    and BMP180 barometric sensor. When compared to a mechanical tensiometer, the IoT
    prototype proved its accuracy, registering an average R2 equal to 0.8 and an RMSE
    range of 4.25–7.1 kPa. In a second step, the irrigation of a Romaine lettuce field
    (Lactuca sativa L.) cultivated under a drip system was managed according to two
    different scenarios: (1) using the data feed from the IoT tensiometers, irrigation
    was performed to keep the soil water potential between −15 and −25 kPa; (2) using
    the data provided by the in-situ weather station to estimate the crop water requirements.
    When comparing the yield, no significant difference was registered between the

    it covers 71% of the planet, only 2.5% is fresh water, out of which only 1% is
    accessible [1]. Thus, mismanagement is a luxury that cannot be afforded. Moreover,
    the combination of population growth and climate change is placing additional
    stress on the already limited water resources, particularly in the Mediterranean
    region and Eurasia. This is affecting livelihoods, food security, economic development,
    and even social stability [2]. On a global scale, 70% of freshwater consumption
    is attributed to irrigated agriculture, which serves as the main cause and causality
    of water scarcity [3,4]. Consequently, there is a significant need to prioritize
    and improve on-farm irrigation management to effectively address such challenges.
    Precision irrigation stands as a cornerstone for advancing agricultural sustainability.
    By leveraging technologies like soil moisture sensors, weather data, and automated
    irrigation systems, it enables farmers to deliver water precisely where and when
    it is needed [5]. This targeted approach conserves water resources and mitigates
    the strain on increasingly scarce water supplies. Furthermore, precision irrigation
    allows for the optimization of nutrient delivery, thus reducing excess runoff
    and minimizing the risk of water pollution. This practice not only enhances crop
    health and yields but also supports the long-term resilience of the soil, which
    is crucial for sustainable agriculture [6]. Overall, precision irrigation is a
    key strategy for promoting agricultural sustainability, ensuring that agriculture
    can meet the growing global demand for food while minimizing its environmental
    impact. Yet, the lack of affordable and dependable data monitoring systems poses
    a major barrier to such potential enhancements [7]. Considering the spatially
    variable and stochastic nature of agricultural systems, it becomes imperative
    to have access to cost-effective and energy-efficient data acquisition systems.
    Such systems could play a major role in more accurate scheduling, monitoring,
    and assessment of irrigation activities [8]. This research work aims to (i) field
    validate a low-cost prototype DIY soil moisture tensiometer and (ii) exploit its
    use by comparing soil moisture-based irrigation management to weather-based irrigation
    management in terms of yield and water productivity. 2. Materials and Methods
    2.1. Irrigation Scheduling Irrigation scheduling directly impacts water use efficiency
    as it involves making decisions regarding the timing and quantity of water application
    to the field [9]. To efficiently schedule irrigation events, one must comprehend
    the dynamics of the plant water continuum, which is influenced by the interaction
    between weather conditions, soil characteristics, and plant physiology, usually
    referred to as SPAC (Soil-Plant-Atmosphere-Continuum) [10]. Hence, the criteria
    on which irrigation scheduling approaches are based are divided into (i) weather-based
    scheduling, (ii) soil moisture-based scheduling, and (iii) plant status-based
    scheduling. Coupled with the rapid development of solid-state sensors and cloud
    platform-based services, monitoring systems could be integrated into the three
    aforementioned approaches. In the next section, the first two main approaches
    and their comparisons in relation to monitoring systems will be briefly presented.
    It is worth mentioning that other factors could impact the actual implementation
    of an irrigation schedule outside the SPAC [11], such as the water supply routine,
    existing irrigation infrastructure, irrigator preferences based on social behavior
    patterns, fertigation and leaching requirements, … etc. Yet, this study is based
    on on-farm irrigation events that target the full satisfaction of plant water
    requirements using an on-demand, supplied drip irrigation system. 2.1.1. Weather
    Conditions Based Scheduling It implies estimating reference evapotranspiration
    (ET0) using measured weather parameters for a well-irrigated theoretical Alfalfa
    grass with a height of 12 cm, settled and immovable plane resistance of 70 s m−1
    and an albedo of 0.23, vigorously rising, effectively watered, and entirely covering
    the land [12]. Several models were developed to estimate ETc. One of the most
    used models is the FAO 56—Penman–Monteith [12,13,14] (Equation (1)). 𝐸𝑇 0 = 0.408𝛥(
    𝑅 𝑛 −𝐺)+𝛾  900 𝑇+273  𝑢 2 ( 𝑒 𝑠 − 𝑒 𝑎 ) 𝛥+𝛾 (1+0.34 𝑢 2 ) 𝜋 𝑟 2 (1) where 𝐸𝑇 0
    is the reference evapotranspiration (mm day−1), 𝑅 𝑛 is the net radiation at the
    crop surface (MJ m−2 day−1), 𝐺 is the soil heat flux density (MJ m−2 day−1), 𝑇
    is the air temperature at 2 m height (°C), 𝑢 2 is the wind speed at 2 m height
    (m s−1), 𝑒 𝑠 is the saturation vapor pressure (kPa), ea is the actual vapor pressure
    (kPa), 𝑒 𝑠 − 𝑒 𝑎 is the saturation vapor pressure deficit (kPa), 𝛥 is the slope
    vapor pressure curve (kPa °C−1), and 𝛾 is the psychrometric constant (kPa °C−1).
    Once ET0 is estimated, it must be corrected using an empirical factor to represent
    the crop evapotranspiration ( ET c ) (mm day−1) relative to 𝐸𝑇 0 at each growth
    stage (crop coefficient Kc) where: ET c = 𝐸𝑇 0 . 𝐾 𝑐 (2) ET c represents the potential
    crop evapotranspiration, i.e., the crop water requirement. The objective of an
    efficient irrigation schedule based on this model is to replenish ET c as readily
    available water (RAW) to be taken by the plant’s effective root zone while minimizing
    the water losses that may occur along the distribution system. This could be represented
    by Equation (3) [15]: 𝑅𝐴𝑊=𝑀𝐴𝐷 . ( 𝜃 𝑓𝑐 − 𝜃 𝑝𝑤𝑝 ) .  𝐷 𝑟  . 10 (3) where MAD is
    the management allowed depletion (the fraction of total available water that is
    allowed to be depleted before the next event), θfc is volumetric water content
    at field capacity (cm3 · cm−3), θpwp is volumetric water content at the permanent
    wilting point (cm3 · cm−3), and Dr is the effective root zone depth in cm. RAW
    is expressed in mm. Automated weather monitoring was one of the earliest systems
    to be integrated into irrigation management [16]. Currently, wireless weather
    stations are commercially available and equipped with sensors capable of measuring
    all the parameters mentioned in Equation (1) and automating ET0 calculations using
    variable transmission protocols. Yet, the main uncertainty of this method stems
    from the agronomic inputs needed to simulate crop evapotranspiration, mainly the
    estimation of Kc and yield response to stresses represented by the stress coefficient
    Ks [17]. Estimating Kc for crops is a complicated process that requires estimating
    the crop’s ETc using well-irrigated lysimeters and back-calculating Kc relative
    to ET0 [18]. As it is not a feasible task for the majority of irrigators, Kc is
    usually assumed from pre-defined values that could be found in the literature
    for similar climatic zones and various crops [12,19,20]. Another significant challenge
    arises from the daily variation of Kc values, which can change as crops grow and
    their leaf area expands [21,22]. An additional important point to consider when
    scheduling irrigation based on weather conditions is the time frame of the weather
    data used to estimate ET0. Two main methods are found in the literature: Predictive
    weather-based models that use a probabilistic approach to generate a representative
    set from historical recorded data for the targeted period consider dry years re-occurrence
    with a certain predefined probability. In this case, the generated schedule should
    be adjusted while being implemented based on daily data, especially rain fall
    events [23,24,25,26]. Near-real-time weather-based models that use short forecasting
    for daily estimations of ET0 to automate irrigation events accordingly [27]. In
    conclusion, accurate implementation of ET-based irrigation scheduling on a commercial
    basis can prove challenging for growers, even if a more accurate estimation of
    Kc is provided. The process involves retrieving daily ET0 values from a representative
    weather station installed in a location with certain standard specifications [28].
    Such limitations drive farmers towards using publicly available ET0 coupled with
    predefined Kc from the literature, usually leading to overirrigation [21]. 2.1.2.
    Soil Moisture Based Scheduling When managing irrigation events, farmers tend to
    rely on experience by sensing the soil using their bare hands to judge its moisture
    condition based on its texture, structure, and wetness. This judgment intuition
    could be described scientifically by two main terms: (i) soil moisture content
    and (ii) soil water matric potential [29]. The first describes the amount of water
    stored in the soil relative to its dry mass in volumetric or gravimetric terms.
    The second is the energy that plant roots need to exert to draw water from the
    soil, or the forces exerted by the soil matrix to hold the water, usually measured
    by tensiometers [30]. Soil moisture condition sensors are commercially available
    for measuring both soil volumetric water content and soil water matrix potential.
    A comprehensive review of the most commonly used sensors and their working concepts
    can be found in [31]. Monitoring soil water potential is crucial for effective
    irrigation management as it provides more accurate information about the availability
    of water to plants and their ability to extract it from the soil. While soil water
    content indicates the amount of water present in the soil, regardless of the plant’s
    ability to access that water [32]. Soil moisture tensiometers are one of the earliest
    and most widely adopted devices for measuring soil water potential. They consist
    of a porous cup and a vacuum gauge for measuring the equivalent negative pressure
    or water tension in unsaturated soils [33]. Unlike soil water content sensors,
    tensiometers are not sensitive to variations in soil texture [34], so they do
    not require prior calibration to be used for determining the matric potential
    at the current moment. Yet, it is important to couple soil water content readings
    with soil water potential monitoring to avoid over-irrigation, as tensiometers
    are inaccurate under high tensions (−80 to −100 kPa), especially in fine-textured
    soils [30]. Soil water potential (SWP) could be described as follows: ψ= ψ m +
    ψ o + ψ p + ψ g (4) where ψ (kPa) is the potential energy per unit mass, volume,
    or weight of water and the sub-scripts m, o, p, and g are the matric, osmotic,
    pressure, and gravitational potentials, respectively [35]. Irrigation scheduling
    based on soil water potential, typically obtained through soil moisture tensiometers,
    is a practical and profound approach to ensuring efficient and rational use of
    water resources in irrigated agriculture [36,37]. It implies defining a soil water
    potential threshold—or a comfortable zone—for a specific crop below which the
    plant begins to suffer [38]. A lot of predefined thresholds could be found in
    the literature for various crops [30,35,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48]. Several
    studies reported potential improvements in water productivity when switching to
    soil water-based irrigation compared to other irrigation approaches [49]. However,
    few have compared soil water potential-based irrigation to the FAO method of estimating
    crop water requirements [12] or any other weather-based irrigation approach. Smajstrla
    and Locascio [50] Smajstrla and Locascio compared irrigation scheduling based
    on pan evaporation to soil water potential-based scheduling using tensiometers
    under tomato drip cultivation. Water productivity increased by 40 and 50% when
    soil water potential was kept at −10 and −15 kPa, respectively, compared to the
    pan-evaporation-based field. Also, in a tomato drip-irrigated field, [51] compared
    soil water potential-based irrigation management using two thresholds (−10 kPa
    and −15 kPa) to conventional farmer practices. The results showed up to 73% of
    potential water reduction when irrigation was based on the soil water potential
    with minimal impact on yield. In Green houses, Buttaro, et al. [52] reported water
    savings of 35% and 45% for tomato and cucumber, respectively, when setting an
    irrigation schedule based on tension threshold ranges of −10 to −40 kPa for tomato
    and −10 to −30 kPa for cucumber. Yang, et al. [53] reported an improvement of
    43.1% to 50.3% in water productivity when switching to soil water potential-based
    irrigation management under rice cultivation, where the SWP was kept at −15 kPa.
    2.2. Experimental Layout The experiment was conducted in CIHEAM Bari’s experimental
    field located in Valenzano, Puglia region, South of Italy (41°2′40.3872″ N, 16°53′3.8364″
    E), during the period April–June 2023, under transplanted Romaine lettuce (Lactuca
    sativa L.). The designed area was 15 m × 9 m divided into two plots, 7.5 m × 9
    m each. Both plots were equipped with a drip irrigation system where the distance
    between lines was 1 m and the distance between the drippers (plants) was 0.25
    m. Drippers were self-compensating with a designed flow rate of 2 L/h. All 16
    mm laterals feeding the drippers were equipped with small butterfly valves to
    ensure precise control of each dripper line, an important design feature as the
    irrigation schedule will be different from one plot to the next. Figure 1 shows
    the experimental layout. Figure 1. Layout of the irrigation network and the experimental
    field. The first plot (Control) was irrigated according to the potential evapotranspiration
    derived from a weather station adjacent to the field using Penman–Monteith (Equation
    (1)) and adjusted using crop coefficients at variable growth stages based on FAO
    56 [12] to calculate the potential crop water requirement as explained in Equation
    (2). Other agronomic and soil parameters are needed to simulate lettuce growth
    in the identified location. Table 1 summarizes all parameters used to generate
    the irrigation schedule, along with their sources and whether they were estimated
    or lab-measured. To facilitate the calculation process, Aquacrop [54] was used
    to generate the irrigation schedule. Table 1. Climate, crop, management, and soil
    parameters are used to generate the weather-based irrigation schedule. Irrigation
    management for this plot was implemented according to the generated irrigation
    schedule; however, the daily gross irrigation requirement was adjusted according
    to the measured daily rainfall during the season to avoid over-irrigation. All
    amounts of water supplied to the plot during the season were recorded using the
    water flowmeter installed upstream of the network. On the other hand, the second
    plot was irrigated on demand using the data feed from three IoT soil moisture
    tensiometers developed by CIHEAMs Bari digital agriculture lab [33]. They measure
    the soil moisture and plot it on a cloud service platform (ThingSpeak™). ThingSpeak
    is a cloud-based IoT analytics platform service that enables the aggregation,
    visualization, and analysis of real-time data streams [56]. It was integrated
    into the IoT prototypes to visualize the data by linking a designated channel
    as a client using its identification number (ID) to receive strings from the devices
    (IoT tensiometers) identified by their internet protocol (Ips). The three IoT
    prototypes were placed diagonally in rows no. 2, 5, and 8 at 15 cm depth (Figure
    1). This depth was identified according to [57], as the ceramic cup was placed
    at half of the expected root zone during the season. In each measuring point,
    another conventional tensiometer with a mechanical manometer (JET FILL 2725) was
    added alongside the IoT one at the same depth (Figure 2). This was carried out
    to validate the developed IoT prototype and ensure its reliability. Figure 2.
    IoT and mechanical tensiometers as installed in the field. Irrigation was managed
    according to the soil water potential in the root zoon. The comfortable range
    thresholds for the Romaine lettuce were investigated in previous studies. Michael
    and Barry [58] recommended −15 to −25 kPa in the establish phase and −25 to −35
    kPa in the post-establish phase. Within the same range, Dessureault-Rompré, et
    al. [59] stated that −20 to −30 kPa is the ideal range. In this study, the threshold
    for initiating an irrigation event was set to −25 kPa, and the threshold to consider
    the field well irrigated was set to −15 kPa. This range was chosen based on literature
    and previous experience with soil water retention curves. The feed from the three
    tensiometers was received daily through the ThingSpeak platform. Once any of the
    three tensiometer readings exceeded −25 kPa, an irrigation event was triggered.
    The objective is to return that tensiometer within the comfortable zone. As the
    feedback from the tensiometers is not instant, continuous monitoring (each two
    hours) of the readings of the tensiometers was required in the initial events
    to ensure the return to the comfortable zone. During the irrigation season, the
    relationship between the amount of water needed and the tensiometer reading above
    the triggering threshold (−25 kPa) could be established, as shown in Table 2.
    All amounts of water supplied to the plot were recorded using the water flowmeter
    installed upstream of the network. Table 2. Above-threshold tensiometer readings
    and the relative amount of water required and allocated to set back the reading.
    2.3. Design and Development of the IoT Soil Moisture Tensiometer Prototype The
    IoT-tensiometer integrates an isolated BMP180 barometric pressure sensor positioned
    near the top of the tensiometer tube, just beneath the closing cap. This sensor
    is linked to an ESP32 microcontroller through four slender wires (measuring 0.55
    mm in diameter) utilizing an Inter-Integrated Circuit interface (I2C). The BMP180
    operates on a logic voltage of 3.3 V and boosts the capability to detect barometric
    pressure up to 110 kPa with exceptional precision (2 Pa), making it well-suited
    for discerning even slight fluctuations in the tensiometer’s vacuum. Serving as
    the prototype’s central processing unit is the ESP32-WROOM MCU, a cost-effective
    and potent microcontroller module featuring integrated WiFi and dual-mode Bluetooth
    capabilities. The detailed blueprints and description of the prototype can be
    found in [33]. In this study, the ESP32s deep sleep functionality was exploited
    to conserve power and ensure the prototype’s self-sufficient operation. Figure
    3 shows the algorithm flowchart. It works as follows: The ESP32 rouses itself
    every six hours (referred to as the “time slot” in the flowchart) to gauge the
    tension within the tensiometer’s vacuum via the BMP180 sensors, then it transmits
    three data points to the ThingSpeak cloud service and reverts back to sleep mode.
    Figure 3. Algorithm Flowchart. If the MCU is unable to locate an accessible network
    within 30 s (as denoted by the “threshold” on the flowchart), it returns to sleep
    mode. Similarly, if the MCU manages to establish a connection but is unable to
    detect the sensors, it subsequently returns to sleep mode, awaiting the next designated
    time slot. Figure 3 provides a visual representation of the code algorithm, scripted
    in the C++ language within the Arduino IDE environment. The prototype is powered
    by two 3.7 V Li-Ion batteries connected in series, providing a combined voltage
    of 7.4 V. These batteries are recharged using a 1.1 W solar panel through an MT3608
    DC-DC voltage regulator, which stabilizes the incoming charging voltage from the
    panels to 9 V. The MT3608 is a compact, cost-effective step-up booster converter
    module designed to elevate voltage from as low as 2 V up to a maximum of 28 V
    DC. All components have been affixed to a designed platform and printed using
    Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol material (PTEG). The design prioritized durability
    under outdoor conditions by minimizing openings or holes. The mounted electronic
    components are enclosed within an elongated sleeve-like box with two securely
    fitted side ducts (like a drawer), with the solar panel positioned on top as depicted
    in Figure 4. Figure 4. The IoT tensiometer prototype: (a) The components; (b)
    the sealed prototype [33]. 3. Results The data feed from the three IoT prototyped
    tensiometers was compared to the readings of the mechanical tensiometers with
    a daily step along the season. Figure 5 shows the format of the data received
    on the ThingSpeak platform on a daily basis. The tool allowed for online and continuous
    soil water potential visualization and tracking, was easily accessed through personal
    devices, and could be downloaded as a .CSV file if needed. Figure 5. Data visualization
    is conducted on a daily basis, as shown on the ThingSpeak platform. The deep sleep
    feature enabled the prototype to achieve a high degree of autonomy. It draws (0.8
    µA) while in sleep mode and peaks at 50 mA for a duration of 5 s when uploading
    data. On days with ample sunlight, the solar panel generates a charging current
    ranging between 100 and 120 milliamperes. Thus, a 2400 mAh Li-ion battery was
    more than sufficient to supply the prototype on dim, cloudy days or at night during
    the test period (29 days from the 24th of May to the 21st of June in Valenzano,
    south Italy, 2023). The deployed prototypes were able to detect the variation
    in soil water potential during the reported period. Figure 6 shows a high correlation
    between the three tested prototypes and their accompanied mechanical manometers,
    with an average R2 of 0.8 while the root mean square error (RMSE) was insignificant,
    ranging from = 2.87 to 5.38. As the prototype was previously lab validated using
    bare soil pots [33], it is interesting to discuss how repeating the validation
    process in the open field impacted the prototype’s accuracy. Compared to the lab
    validation, R2 is reduced from 0.99 to 0.8, while the RMSE range increased from
    0.7–1.1 Kpa in the lab to 2.87–5.38 Kpa in the open field. Such results could
    be interpreted mainly as follows: (i) The medium scale: compared to large-scale
    open field soil structures, the soil pots (30 × 28 cm) provided a more confined
    environment, thus permitting the validation setup to be less prone to vertical
    and horizontal soil water movement and redistribution; (ii) The plant’s effective
    root zone: unlike bare soil pots, the plant’s roots (in this case Lettuce) were
    introduced in this validation setup. Despite considering the tensiometer placement
    to be as close as possible to the transplants (10–15 cm), it is not feasible to
    predict the effective root zone development and its impact on the prototype accuracy,
    yet it is an inevitable consequence. Figure 6. Validation of the three prototype
    sensors as compared to the mechanical manometers. In terms of water productivity,
    fresh and dry yield were both weighed, while the amount of water allocated was
    registered using mechanical flowmeters. The fresh yield was almost the same: 149.7
    kg in the weather-based plot and 146.9 kg in the soil-based one. On the other
    hand, the total amount of water allocated to the plots was 18.218 m3 and 13.103
    m3 in the weather-based and soil-based plots, respectively, registering a reduction
    of 28%. Thus, the water productivity was higher by 36.44%, as shown in Figure
    7. Figure 7. Water productivity as a result of irrigation scheduling based on
    weather and soil moisture using IoT tensiometers. Another result worth mentioning
    is the frequency of irrigation events. Figure 8 shows a comparison between the
    applied irrigation schedules. In the initial stage, both approaches were almost
    the same in terms of timing and quantity. However, after the initial stage (first
    week), the IoT soil-based plot maintained a soil water potential between −15 and
    −25 kPa, reducing the number of mandated irrigation events and spacing them apart.
    On the other hand, the gross irrigation requirements based on the simulated evapotranspiration
    from the adjacent weather station necessitated more irrigation events to meet
    the consumptive use. Overall, the weather-based plot required 32 irrigation events
    with a total of 26.7 irrigation hours. While the soil-based plot required only
    22 irrigation events with 21.4 irrigation hours, a 28% reduction in the amount
    of water allocated. Although energy consumption was not measured in this study,
    the irrigation time implies that potential energy savings could be achieved. Figure
    8. Applied irrigation schedules in both plots along the season. One of the main
    advantages of the introduced prototype is its low cost, which does not only consider
    the initial cost of its components (82.20$) shown in Table 3 and compared to the
    readily available commercial versions (2023), whose costs range between 117 USD
    (Embsys Technologies Private Limited, Soil moisture tensiometer, Guindy, Chennai,
    Tamil Nadu, India) and 481 USD (METER, TEROS 32 Soil moisture tensiometer, 2365
    NE Hopkins Ct. Pullamn, WA 99163, The United States of America). An important
    consideration instead is the subscription fee requested by the service provider
    to access data through the service provider platform. Open source DIY prototypes—such
    as the one in hand—facilitate access to low-cost innovative solutions while overcoming
    the burden of data handling fees and service providers’ ownership over data. Table
    3. Breakdown of the cost of the prototype. 4. Conclusions Progress in electronic
    technologies has granted researchers affordable access to solid-state sensors
    and programmable microcontroller-based circuits. Coupled with 3D printing potentials,
    prototyping for automating data collection has become much more feasible. In this
    study, an easy-to-assemble, cost-effective, energy-autonomous prototype of an
    IoT tensiometer was field-validated. The IoT tensiometer proved to be reliable
    and was able to track the variation in the soil water potential with an average
    R2 = 0.8 and RMSE ranging from 4.25 to 7.1. It was then used to compare weather-based
    to soil-based irrigation management under drip-irrigated lettuce cultivation.
    In consistency with previous studies, irrigation scheduling based on soil water
    tension proved potential water savings when compared to a weather-based approach.
    Water productivity was improved by 36.44% when irrigation was based on the IoT
    tensiometer prototype, setting a threshold of (−15 to −25 kPa) relative to the
    FAO 56 weather-based approach [12]. Such a low-cost prototype (82.20$) contributes
    to an affordable, easy-to-access soil moisture monitoring system, which is an
    inherent problem when addressing soil moisture-based irrigation management. It
    is worth mentioning that the field deployment of the sensors lasted for approximately
    2 months, along with the whole cropping season of lettuce. This period served
    the objective of this study and allowed for soil-based on-farm irrigation management;
    however, it still remains a short period to test the sensors’ durability and their
    long-term reliability. For the latter purpose, further investigation is needed,
    especially to set technical maintenance/replacement, and periodic recalibration
    requirements. The same applies for assessing the improvements in terms of energy
    consumption that accompany the irrigation time reduction. Author Contributions

  description: With the increasing demands on global agriculture, there is an imperative
    need to optimize crop yields and promote sustainable agricultural practices. Real-time
    monitoring and accurate predictions of soil health and crop yields have significant
    implications for farmers, agronomists, and policymakers. While existing soil analysis
    models offer certain predictive capabilities, their efficiency is often hindered
    by issues related to energy consumption, prediction delay, and accuracy levels.
    Contemporary soil models primarily fall short in addressing the multifaceted nature
    of soil attributes and their dynamic interactions. These models also struggle
    to provide real-time insights, frequently leading to delayed interventions, misallocated
    resources, and suboptimal yields. In this paper, we introduce an advanced, low-cost,
    and energy-aware multiparametric IoT-based soil analysis model designed to overcome
    the prevailing limitations. Our system harnesses the synergy of N, P, K, Humidity,
    and Temperature sensors, augmented with temporal datasets to offer a comprehensive
    view of the soil's current state. At the core of our analysis, an ensemble learning
    model combines the strengths of Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, MLP, and
    1D CNN methods, streamlining accurate yield level predictions. To further refine
    the model's efficiency, a Q Learning approach is integrated, ensuring both energy
    conservation and heightened prediction accuracy. When deployed in various agronomic
    scenarios, the proposed model manifested a marked improvement in prediction metrics.
    Notably, we observed a 10.5% enhancement in precision, 9.4% in accuracy, 8.5%
    in recall, and 4.5% in AUC. Moreover, the model reduced the prediction delay by
    9.5% compared to its counterparts. These advancements underscore the potential
    of our model to revolutionize soil analysis techniques, paving the way for smarter,
    energy-efficient, and productive agricultural practices.

    Agency: SECTION I. Introduction Sustainable development is extremely important
    and vital for satisfying future generations’ rights to natural resources. It helps
    countries and businesses grow in ways that adapt to the challenges posed by climate
    change [1]. Besides, water is considered the most critical resource for sustainable
    agricultural development worldwide. However, global droughts, erosions, and other
    climate culminations are deteriorating water scarcity [2], [3]. In this regard,
    a few research and development studies have been conducted in recent times proposing
    smart solutions to improve agricultural practices and environmental estimations.
    Such that, related works have been critically reviewed and compared for their
    scientific contributions and limitations. Several studies have posed limitations
    in terms of the reliability of developed systems, cost of implementations, as
    well as power consumption by sensors and equipment utilized [4], [5], [6], [7],
    [8]. This as a result necessitates the need to develop a low-cost multifunction
    tool that can be utilized in a field for long-term reliable estimations. In this
    regard, Table I presents a technology comparison of recent related works with
    the developed system. In addition to that, Australia despite being a developed
    country is incorporating severe climatic pressures on the water sector in the
    form of changing rainfall patterns, higher temperatures, sea-level rises, increased
    salinity, and harsh weather events. While socioeconomic pressures like population
    growth, changing economic conditions, industry needs, legacy infrastructures,
    as well as budget constraints are also imposing restrictions on agricultural water
    allocations [9]. TABLE I Comparison of the Developed System With the Existing
    Studies In particular, the New South Wales state’s water monitoring network has
    more than six thousand active monitoring sites to keep account of water data.
    However, significant gaps exist in the current water monitoring network mainly
    due to the large variation in the density of sensors utilized in most of the active
    sites. According to WaterNSW and Natural Resources Access Regulator (NRAR), 25%–30%
    of current groundwater data are unaccounted for, while only 396 out of 4673 sites
    are telemetry which records only water level [10]. This creates a lack of clarity
    in the calibration of instrumentation and quality assurance, thus, demanding a
    more accurate and cost-effective system. In this work, an IoT-enabled low-cost
    low-power multidepth smart sensors system has been developed to acquire real-time
    soil-environmental data from the pilot field, which can be used to predict potential
    weather events and develop preventive measures accordingly. Initially, the system
    is pretested in a controlled laboratory environment before being trialed in the
    field. The article consists of five sections. In Section I, the significance of
    the presented work is compared with the related studies along with the infrastructure
    gaps in the current groundwater monitoring of NSW that need smart technological
    solutions. Section II covers the system design, integration, and functional flow.
    The laboratory testing stage is explained in Section III. Multiple field installations
    as well as the challenges are described in Section IV. Section V discusses the
    regression model and correlation analysis of study parameters utilizing the field
    dataset. Finally, the study concludes with Section VI indicating future work.
    SECTION II. Sensor Node Design and Composition The sensor nodes are developed
    as a smart measurement tool to measure the change in soil moisture (SM) and soil
    temperature (ST) at three subsequent depths along with the impact of environmental
    factors such as rain and temperature on soil. The hardware structure of the probe
    is made up of 3-D-printed sensor housings with polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pressure
    conduits. The sensor-node system is mainly comprised of low-power off-the-shelf
    sensors as illustrated in Fig. 1. Moreover, the essential electronic components
    are described in Table II. This newly designed system is an improved and tested
    version of our own previously built node [11], [12]. The design concept of a multidepth
    sensing probe is in line with the studies conducted for the performance evaluation
    of SM sensors at different depths of land covers and estimated physical models
    utilizing field datasets [13], [14], [15]. TABLE II Components Used in Sensor
    Development Fig. 1. Sensor-node hardware composition. Show All A. Sensor-Node
    Integration The smart sensor node is programed using C ++ on an Arduino-integrated
    development environment (IDE). The electronic system is powered via a rechargeable
    battery (3.0–5.0 V) utilizing 6 V–6 W solar power cells. Fig. 2(a) demonstrates
    the electronic enclosure view in a laboratory setting. Fig. 2(b) illustrates an
    Arduino shield stack comprised of a solar charger shield, LoRaWAN shield, and
    a Qwiic shield at the top utilized as the main soldering panel to integrate all
    sensors including the rain gauge. The complete integration schematic is presented
    in Fig. 2(c). The central part illustrates the stack of Arduino-compatible shields.
    On the right-hand side, the capacitive SM sensors are integrated via extended
    three-core wire to analog pins: A1, A2, and A3 with Voltage Common Collector (Vcc)
    and common earthing. On the left-hand side, the DS18B20 digital ST sensors are
    connected by Vcc through an n-channel transistor with a 4.7 kΩ pull-up resistor
    linked to the common digital input pin-4 of the microcontroller. The gate of the
    transistor is affixed to pin-5 through a 100Ω resistor. Likewise, a digital rain
    sensor is connected by Vcc to pin-3 of the microcontroller via a 1 MΩ pull-up
    resistor to the emitter of the transistor. At the bottom, an I2C environmental-combination
    sensor CCS811/BME280 is coupled via serial ports of the Qwiic shield to determine
    the impact of environmental factors. Fig. 2. Sensor-node integration. (a) Electronic
    enclosure view. (b) Stack of Arduino shields. (c) Integration schematic. Show
    All B. Microcontroller Functional Flow and IoT Framework The microcontroller-based
    sensor node works on the principle of the below functional flowchart. As illustrated
    in Fig. 3(a) when the system is powered on, the integrated sensors are initialized.
    The controller remains in sleep mode until the preset wake-up cycle is reached.
    When the interval period is completed, all sensors wake up with system stabilization.
    Subsequently, the node begins accumulating sensors’ data while at the same time
    making up a connection with the cloud server for data transmission using long
    range (LoRa) shield. Besides, in case of rain signal activation, the system wakes
    up from sleep mode to accumulate all sensor data and transmit it more actively
    in quick time successions to the cloud server for a predefined period until the
    rain stops and the sensor alert is deactivated again [16]. Eventually, the implementation
    of sleep mode, as well as wake-up clock timers, has significantly improved the
    battery lifecycle and performance of the developed system. Such implementation
    is parallel with the study that proposed a cost-effective solution integrating
    microcontrollers with environmental sensors [17]. Furthermore, the data accumulated
    from the deployed sensor nodes is visualized in real-time on an IoT analytics
    platform called ThingSpeak via LoRaWAN network gateway as illustrated in Fig.
    3(b) of the sensor nodes IoT framework. The aggregated information can be downloaded
    as a field dataset from the server to further implement analytical solutions [18],
    [19]. Fig. 3. (a) Microcontroller functional flow. (b) IoT framework. Show All
    SECTION III. Laboratory Testing The experimental setup of the two nodes placed
    inside a soil sampling container is shown in Fig. 4. The sensor nodes are contained
    with two potting soil profiles for a month to pretest the node’s performance in
    a controlled environment before the open-field installation. Fig. 4. Laboratory
    testing environment. Show All Such that, the overall system performance was examined
    by imitating typical weather events, such as rain or irrigation and solar exposure.
    For example, to imitate rainfall, a known volume of water poured into the pilot
    container with the same volume into the rain-gauge catchment area. Similarly,
    a 100 W light bulb was employed over the sampling container to imitate extended
    solar hours. Moreover, battery power consumption was assessed via oscilloscope
    during laboratory trials. Such type of controlled examination is in line with
    the study that determined a time-division multiplexing approach to estimate SM
    content inside a sampling container [20]. This preliminary testing was used as
    a baseline to validate sensor nodes’ performance in the real field. A. Sensors
    Output Mapping It is important to mention that the capacitive SM sensors are not
    highly accurate, thus, it was crucial to calibrate the sensors’ analog readings
    to achieve admissible accuracy in field results [21]. In this regard, the sensors’
    output readings are benchmarked into moisture percentage levels based on the obtained
    sensor values from dry to wet soil conditions. It was observed that capacitive-type
    sensors take at least 1–3 min to settle, depending on the saturation level of
    the soil and how well the wet soil was mixed. Further, a first-order linear fitting
    equation was established between the dielectric sensor output and the moisture
    level in the soil as shown in Fig. 5(a). The soil type used for testing is a medium-textured
    native loamy soil ideal for gardening and growing plants. The soil can hold water
    for longer periods allowing air to circulate through plant roots and obtain nutrients.
    Thereby, from dry to wet soil conditions, the moisture levels are mapped into
    percentage hierarchy as 1%–25%, 30%–55%, 60%–68%, and 70%–100%, respectively.
    It is observed that the sensor output voltage is a function of change in capacitance
    and a dielectric constant of soil, which is in proportional relationship with
    the volume of water content in soil [22]. For instance, as the rainwater infiltrates
    into the soil, its ability to hold charge (capacitance) changes. This change in
    capacitance produces a proportional voltage which is measured by using an analog-to-digital
    converter (ADC) pin on the microcontroller and is translated to determine the
    SM content [23]. Fig. 5. Sensor’s mapping (a) SM level with respect to sensor
    capacitive readings. (b) Water volume with respect to senor output pulses. Show
    All Furthermore, to calibrate the tipping-bucket rain sensor, the total catchment
    area of the rain gauge was obtained. Later, a 9.00 mm syringe is used to pour
    the measured volume of water into the gauge and calibrate the generated tips produced
    by the sensor against the water volume. The output tips are recorded as digital
    pulses from the rain sensor in the microcontroller. Hence, a linear fitting equation
    was established between the sensor pulses and the rain volume as shown in Fig.
    5(b). The calibration method was adapted from a case study conducted to develop
    the calibration procedures for meteorological sensors [24]. SECTION IV. Multiple
    Field Installations The completion of laboratory pretesting is followed by multiple
    field installations at different agricultural lands to test the developed system
    in natural conditions. A. Leafy Garden, Beecroft The first field installation
    was piloted at a leafy residential garden located in the Northern suburb of Sydney,
    Australia. The two initially fabricated nodes were deployed in natural conditions
    to examine the sensors’ accuracy, network stability, and lifecycle. The installation
    time was approximately 2 h for the two nodes making use of a heavy-duty steel
    Power Augur drill to dig 600 mm long and 50 mm wide pilot holes along with a metal
    pincer used for clearing post holes. Given that, the holes’ depth was carefully
    maintained at 500–600 mm as per the probe dimension. While a bucket of mud was
    prepared to fill the voids inside pilot holes. Subsequently, the electronic setup
    is powered on while being clamped firmly on the anchored tree branches as shown
    in Fig. 6. Later, the live nodes were inspected for their correct functionality
    and kept idle for a few days until the mud-filled voids settled analogous to the
    garden soil. Fig. 6. Sensor-nodes installation at a leafy garden, Beecroft, NSW.
    Show All B. Grazing Farm, Narrabri The second field installation of two recently
    fabricated nodes was piloted at cattle grazing grassland located on the periphery
    of the L’lara research farm in the northeast township of Narrabri, NSW, Australia.
    The site is technically supervised by the Plant Breeding Institute, University
    of Sydney. The standard implementation of two nodes at allocated land spots took
    three days due to rough weather conditions. Thereby, preventive measures were
    taken for nodes’ protection against numerous risks involved on-site, such as floods,
    windstorms, livestock, wire tampering, and vandalism. For a firm installation,
    a 3-m-long star-picket pole was utilized to clamp the system enclosure at a height
    that it can withstand rough weather conditions. Thereby, the electronic setup
    with a rain gauge and solar panel was clamped altogether utilizing stainless grip
    brackets as can be seen in Fig. 7. The sensors are protected with a flexible wire
    conduit. While the deployed nodes are confined in a stainless-steel cage bonded
    with fence posts. This was crucial mainly to protect against grazing livestock
    and wild animals. Fig. 7. Sensor-nodes installation at L’lara farm, Narrabri,
    NSW. Show All Next, the challenge was to communicate live-node information from
    the pilot field to the cloud server utilizing the The-Things-Network (TTN) bridge
    between the LoRaWAN gateway and the ThingSpeak server. Thereupon, a user id was
    created to register the nodes on an open-source TTN community console application.
    At this point, the custom function codes were compiled for each node’s setting
    as a default uplink payload format for establishing a smooth network connection.
    C. Development Challenges and Corrective Actions In the course of development
    with field trials, numerous challenges were faced at different points. The measures
    to mitigate prominent challenges are briefed below. The CCS811/BME280 sensor employed
    externally to acquire environmental parameters indicated excessive temperature
    (°C) due to continuous solar exposure in the field while protected with a 3-D-printed
    housing. To cater, the polylactic acid (PLA) filament was replaced with the acrylonitrile
    styrene acrylate (ASA) which is best suited for outdoor applications [25]. Operating
    battery power consumption was not being monitored in real time. Thereby, a resistor
    R7 embedded in series with an analog A0 pin on the solar charger shield was shorted
    using 0Ω to link the Vbat pin with the analog A0 pin on the microcontroller, and
    the analog input pin was then used to monitor the operating battery voltage on
    ThingSpeak server. Digital pin 3 used for the rain sensor was reset to 0 mL with
    a system reboot. Thus, to avoid losing continuous rain data, the NOR-type electrically
    erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM) storage memory was included in
    the Arduino IDE library. The need for uninterrupted operation of the sensor node
    resulted in excessive battery power consumption which diminishes the system’s
    lifecycle and performance in the field. To manage this, sleep-mode timers with
    wake-up cycles were implemented in the microcontroller to save on battery power
    and system memory. In the course of the first field trial, it was observed that
    after a rain exposure, the electronic enclosure incurred moisture content inside
    it. Thus, to protect the electronic setup, the passage holes for sensor wires
    were double-coated with a polysiloxane sealer with a desiccant silicon dioxide
    placed inside the box to absorb any induced moisture. For initial field trials,
    the rain gauge station was not firmly affixed to the ABS enclosure, and thus could
    not withstand rain storms. Thereby, to fix it stable on a plane, the bottom fringes
    of the station were glued on the top post of the enclosure, while stainless brackets
    with wire ties were utilized as clamping support onto the star-picket poles as
    well as on the anchored tree branches. For the second open-field installation
    at L’lara farm in Narrabri the network accessibility at the pilot site was via
    the TTN bridging platform to ThingSpeak server. However, the TTN web application
    had a service limitation of only one monitoring channel that could be configured
    for each working node. However, for previously tested nodes on ThingSpeak, two
    or more monitoring channels were set up for each running node, which was imperative
    to accommodate all study parameters. Therefore, for study stipulation, it was
    necessary to adjust the gateway source code. Such that, the primitive string was
    first split into two data bytes and concatenated into one char, enabling the accumulation
    of all parameters into one monitoring channel. The sketch adjustments were made
    using the Arduino IDE application. While calibrating capacitive SM sensors, it
    was observed that output measurements are not very consistent with the change
    in SM content. Thus, to curtail the sensors’ volatility in various soil profiles,
    the output sensor readings were mapped into a percentage hierarchy using a first-order
    linear fitting equation. SECTION V. Regression Model Analysis This section presents
    the explanatory regression model analysis of the study parameters obtained from
    the Node-5 installation at a leafy garden in the Northern suburb of Sydney, Australia.
    The parameters involve; SM, ST, ambient temperature, and rain. For this, the developed
    system is piloted during wet and dry conditions to obtain real-time field data.
    This according to a study is a suitable method to measure the statistical significance
    between functionally automatic systems [26]. In this regard, a linear regression
    model is established to analyze the SM sensors’ response at the time of two distinct
    rain events. It is evident from the results that the amount of water present in
    the soil is proportional to the precipitation volume. In this regard, two periodic
    rain spans of 00:00–06:00 and 16:00–02:00 are illustrated in Fig. 8. Fig. 8. Regression
    model of SM and P. Show All In the first event, the rainwater has taken ample
    time to move through to the top layer 0–20 cm indicating a moderate percolation
    rate. Meanwhile, it gives rise to SM percent from 66%–70% perhaps due to a fairly
    saturated soil profile. Such that, the high R-squared value 0.93 validates the
    goodness of fit of the regression model between SM and rain precipitation. In
    the second event, the topsoil moisture climbed considerably from 64%–76%. The
    fast water movement through to the top layer 0–20 cm means a high infiltration
    rate primarily due to the high hydraulic conductivity of the soil. Besides, the
    R-squared value of regression model 0.81 reveals the high variance of SM by the
    change in precipitation volume. The results are in line with a study that used
    a water balance principle to measure the dynamics and distribution patterns of
    SM at different slope positions during rainfall [27]. Furthermore, to visualize
    the symmetry of SM variation at three subsequent layers (top, middle, and bottom)
    Fig. 9 is plotted. During the first rain period, it is observed that at the period
    of approximately 15 min (01:27:48–01:41:34), the rainwater has percolated through
    to the bottom soil layer (60 cm) bringing rise to moisture content at each layer
    with a higher infiltration rate observed at the bottom layer. In this period,
    the topsoil moisture (blue) improved at the slowest rate (66%–68%) indicating
    the top layer’s damper state. But at the same time, it climbed relatively faster
    (50%–60%) at the middle layer (gray) revealing the less saturated soil profile.
    However, the bottom layer (orange) perhaps due to being more water-scarce at the
    depth has shown the highest infiltration rate (20%–35%). The results are in line
    with the US Agriculture Department which indicates higher infiltration rates in
    dry soils [28]. Fig. 9. Rate of change in SM content during rain events. Show
    All Likewise, the second rain spell (moderate −9.82 mm/day) also exhibited significant
    variation in SM at pilot layers. Initially, at timestamp (17:07:44), the rainwater
    (rainfall ≤2.55 mm) percolated through to the middle layer (0–40 cm) giving striking
    rise to top and middle layers’ moisture levels from 62%–76% (wet) and 45%–55%
    (humid), respectively. While it did not reach the bottom layer (60 cm) in that
    instance. However, after 6 h of drizzle, there was another rain span (rainfall
    ≥7.27 mm) of approximately 2 h (23:39:00–01:21:59). In that, the rainwater percolated
    sequentially through to the bottom layer giving rise to SM at each layer as shown
    in below Fig. 9. The results are in line with the study that performed a regression
    model and correlation analysis to measure the change in SM and ST against the
    rising precipitation volume in an arid region of China [29]. To analyze the impact
    of environmental temperature on ST at three subsequent layers, a strong correlation
    with respect to time is modeled as shown in Fig. 10. The topsoil temperature at
    20 cm depth is proportionally driven by the ambient temperature in both dry and
    wet conditions, whereas, the middle and bottom layers at 40–60 cm were not perceived
    as greatly affected by top surface conditions. Such that in the first “Rain” case,
    the top ST has dropped in proportion from 20.5 °C–19.1 °C with a slight decrease
    in ambient temperature from 23.7 °C–22.1 °C during wet hours. In the second “Sunny
    day” case, the ST at the top layer has reasonably increased from 18 °C–19.3 °C
    with a rapid rise in ambient temperature from 23.2 °C–39 °C during prime solar
    hours (09:00–15:00). However, the middle and bottom layers did not show significant
    change in temperature in both cases and were relatively maintained at 20.1 °C
    and 19.5 °C, respectively. The results are in line with a case study that used
    a regression model to establish a strong positive correlation between atmospheric
    and STs up to 20 cm soil depth [30]. Fig. 10. Correlation between ambient-temp
    and soil-temp during rain and sunny hours. Show All SECTION VI. Conclusion and
    Future Works The presented work is an augmentation of a research consortium started
    a year ago which involved Australian institutes and not-for-profit water management
    operators. It is expected that this newly designed low-cost smart sensor node
    system can contribute as a valuable replacement for expensive commercial soil
    probes. The system has been successfully trialed in the field and is capable of
    long-term large-scale applications. Moreover, it offers a unique opportunity for
    researchers and land managers to drive the water-balance algorithms based on the
    field dataset, which are essential to predict potential recharge in various soil
    profiles as well as to schedule suitable irrigation patterns for lands. Furthermore,
    it is also anticipated that the integration of a soil quality detection sensor,
    such as soil organic carbon (SOC) sensors in the IoT-assisted system can significantly
    enhance the measurement capability of the developed system, which may attract
    more industry collaborations in the future. Such a system with low comparative
    commercial cost can be a real asset for agricultural managers to save on their
    annual water and energy consumption and make long-term profitable decisions. Authors

    chapter''s full text. Full Text Preview Introduction Urban agriculture, encompassing
    practices such as rooftop farming, vertical farming, and hydroponics, has emerged
    as a promising approach to address the increasing demand for food in urban areas
    (Su et al., 2020). As the world''s population continues to urbanize, the limited
    availability of arable land and the challenges associated with traditional agricultural
    practices pose significant obstacles to ensuring food security in cities (Kasprzyk
    et al., 2022). However, the integration of smart technologies has the potential
    to overcome these challenges and optimize urban agricultural practices. Smart
    technologies, including the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence
    (AI), and data analytics, are revolutionizing various industries, and urban agriculture
    is no exception. These technologies offer innovative solutions to enhance resource
    efficiency, improve productivity, and promote sustainability in urban farming
    (Pathmudi et al., 2023). One of the key benefits of smart technologies in urban
    agriculture is the increased feasibility of food production in urban areas. Research
    conducted by Badami and Ramankutty (2015) suggests that urban agriculture is more
    feasible for growing basic daily vegetables for the urban poor in developed countries
    than in developing countries. By leveraging smart technologies, urban farming
    can be made more efficient and productive, making it a viable option for food
    production in resource-constrained urban areas. Resource circularity is another
    area where smart technologies play a crucial role in urban agriculture. Weidner
    et al. (2019) highlight the potential of decentralized anaerobic digestion and
    vermicomposting, coupled with smart technologies, in utilizing organic waste for
    urban agriculture. By closing the loop and recycling organic waste, smart technologies
    contribute to a resource circular economy in urban farming, reducing the reliance
    on external resources and minimizing waste. Water management is a critical aspect
    of urban agriculture, and smart technologies offer improved solutions in this
    regard. Mason et al. (2019) demonstrate the potential of intelligent irrigation
    systems, enabled by IoT and data analytics, to reduce water consumption while
    maintaining crop yield in smallholder farming systems. By integrating sensors,
    wireless communications, and data platforms, these systems provide real-time data
    for informed decision-making, enabling precise and optimized water management
    in urban agriculture. In addition to resource efficiency, smart technologies also
    contribute to the environmental sustainability of urban agriculture. Jaramillo
    and Desyouni (2015) emphasize that the current food system contributes heavily
    to global environmental challenges such as biodiversity loss and climate change.
    However, smart urban farming practices, such as vertical farming and greenhouses,
    supported by smart technologies, offer controlled environments that reduce the
    need for land, water, and pesticides. This can help mitigate the negative environmental
    impacts associated with conventional agriculture. While the integration of smart
    technologies in urban agriculture holds great promise, it is essential to address
    the challenges and considerations associated with their implementation. Benis
    and Ferrão (2018) highlight barriers such as high investment costs, narrow profit
    margins, and uncertain marketing channels that hinder the commercialization of
    rooftop farming. Moreover, the potential drawbacks of smart urban agriculture,
    including the dependence on technology and the exclusion of traditional farming
    practices, need to be carefully examined (Glaeser et al., 2021). In conclusion,
    smart technologies have the potential to revolutionize urban agriculture by enhancing
    resource efficiency, improving productivity, and promoting environmental sustainability.
    Through the integration of IoT, AI, and data analytics, urban farming can overcome
    challenges associated with limited land availability, water scarcity, and environmental
    impact. However, it is crucial to consider the socioeconomic aspects, inclusivity,
    and long-term sustainability of smart urban agriculture initiatives. Continue

    rapid increases in θ and ECw where soil liquefaction and sand boils occurred.
    Through soil survey, we confirmed the existence of a large channel beneath one
    of the liquefaction plots, suggesting considerably high spatial heterogeneity
    of soil salinity across the greenhouse. Secondly, the high salinity level could
    not be controlled by drip irrigation at all. Finally, 1-week flooded leaching
    treatments were carried out; the electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) survey
    indicated that the salinity level decreased significantly except around the channel
    plot. The combination of the flooded leaching and natural rainfall was more effective
    for salt leaching in macropores and channels. Our analysis using the WSNS highlighted
    three management strategies that may help reduce a polder's salinity level.

    (Kumamoto earthquake sequence) occurred in Kumamoto Prefecture and its surrounding
    areas in Japan on April 14, 2016 [1]. The epicenter was located at 32.793°N, 130.749°E,
    with a focal depth of about 10.0 km [2] (Fig. 1). There were a series of foreshocks
    and mainshocks in the same region, which included the M6.5 (at 21:26 on April
    14 (local time)) and M7.3 (at 1:25 on April 16 (local time)) earthquakes [3].
    The Earthquake seriously damaged Kumamoto''s agricultural lands and crop facilities
    along the Ariake sea. There are many lowland coastal farmlands along the coastline
    of the Ariake sea as a result of many reclamation projects since ancient times
    [4]. In Kumamoto prefecture, having approximately 20,000 ha of agricultural land
    reclamation, [5] reported crop damages due to soil liquefaction containing high
    salinity in shallow groundwater in response to the strong ground shaking. Because
    the local distribution of the liquefaction might cause high spatial variability
    of soil salinity in the lowland coastal farmlands, the effective desalinization
    of salinity soil was required to recover agricultural production. Download : Download

    #general). For the recovery of salinized farmlands, volumetric soil water content
    (θ) and pore water electrical conductivity (ECw) are helpful in measuring soil
    salinity conditions through a real-time monitoring system. For example, [6] developed
    a Field Monitoring System (FMS) containing two central systems: a monitoring system
    and field measurements (e.g., Time Domain Ttransmissiometry (TDT) sensors and
    dataloggers). The monitoring system can collect the in-situ data through Bluetooth
    and send it to the data server over the Internet. This measurement technique allowed
    us to facilitate agricultural production recovery on 2011 tsunami-affected farmlands
    through real-time monitoring θ and ECw in homogeneous paddy fields [7]. However,
    if the heterogeneity of soil salinity was caused by upland fields converted from
    the recovered paddy fields [8], the utilization of FMS was limited by the prohibitive
    cost of setting several observation points for monitoring the spatial variability
    of salinity conditions. Especially in crop management, such as soybean and tomato
    cultivation on coastal tidelands, soil salinity levels presented considerably
    high temporal and spatial heterogeneity because of the differences in reclamation
    measures and farming practices [8]. New innovative and cost-effective IoT applications
    are helping the farming sector improve agricultural production''s standard, quantity,
    sustainability, and price effectiveness [9]. While access to real-time data reduces
    site visits, a significant benefit of distributed real-time data relates to decision-making
    support for a more effective irrigation timing and scheduling of salt leaching.
    Recent advances in sensing technology, particularly in wireless sensor network
    systems (WSNS), enable environmental monitoring in real-time and at unprecedented
    spatial and temporal scales [10,11] developed the WSNS with Arduino and XBEE for
    real-time monitoring θ and ECw in heterogeneous agricultural fields and greenhouses.
    The WSNS consists of the extension unit, an edge device connected to soil moisture-salinity
    sensors (TDT sensors), and the base unit that receives the data and transmits
    it to the cloud (Fig. 2). Measured data was available to download through a Web
    server. For recovery of tsunami-affected farmlands, [11] analyzed the prototype
    of WSNS and concluded that the technology could effectively capture spatially
    representative measurements of soil salinity in soybean fields. Download : Download

    the wireless sensor network system (WSNS) with Arduino and XBEE using TDT sensors.
    By comparison with point measurement technology, geophysical methods such as electrical
    resistivity tomography (ERT) can provide two-dimensional spatial geological information
    non-invasively about bulk soil EC (ECb) that is defined by the reciprocal of the
    electrical resistivity. ERT is an effective tool to ascertain the change in the
    groundwater environment because electrical resistivity is strongly affected by
    θ and salinity variations in the soil [12]. After the 2016 Kumamoto Earthquake,
    [13] reported changes in soil resistivity distribution based on the ERT line survey
    in Kumamoto. Furthermore, our concern is that the Earthquake might cause seawater
    intrusion from the seaside around a coastal polder. For example, seawater intrusion
    from the seaside was confirmed after the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake [14]. Due to the
    ERT survey, the validation of flooded leaching and seawater intrusion must be
    essential for desalinization. This study aimed to evaluate the damages to tomato
    cultivation caused by ECw in a Kumamoto coastal polder, and assess agricultural
    production recovery before-and-after the 2016 Kumamoto Earthquake using our developed
    Wireless Sensor Network System (WSNS). We also investigated the missing data rate,
    communication system, and power supply issues of the WSNS in greenhouse conditions.
    Additionally, we examined the spatial variation of θ and ECw due to soil liquefaction.
    Moreover, we conducted flooded leaching treatments and assessed the impact of
    flooded leaching and natural rainfall on desalinization by analyzing changes in
    solute mass (θ⋅ECw) profiles, utilizing our developed WSNS and ERT survey. Prior
    to the earthquake, we determined the optimal “θ•ECw” value for successful cultivation
    of salt-tolerant tomatoes, taking into account the required saline level for their
    excellent growth. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study site Field measurements
    and soil survey were conducted at a Yokoshima reclamation area (≈2,900 ha) (32°50′49.9\"N
    130°34′06.4\"E) in Kumamoto, Japan. Our research site was a plastic greenhouse
    of a tomato field (0.13 ha) along an agricultural waterway (EC = 0.012 dS m−1)
    and a watercourse (EC = 0.099 dS m−1) on the east edge of the Yokoshima reclamation
    area (Fig. 3a). Coast protection exists between the watercourse and the Ariake
    sea. The soil type was sandy clay in the rhizosphere (the upper soil layer) down
    to 80 cm deep. The lower layer below 80 cm deep was heavy clay. Average saturated
    hydraulic conductivity (Ks) and dry bulk density (ρb) measured using undisturbed
    soil core samples taken in the upper and lower layers were 104, 1.2 cm d−1 and
    0.9, 1.1 g cm−3, respectively. Porosity was 55% for the upper soil layer. We created
    two wells with an 80 cm-auger and investigated the greenhouse''s groundwater level
    (GWL) and the EC using a portable EC meter once a month. The GWL was shallow,
    and the EC of GWL was approximately 6 dS m−1 even before the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake.

    Fig. 3. Sensor locations in a greenhouse damaged by the 2016 Kumamoto Earthquake
    (a), ERT line survey in the greenhouse after the tomato cultivation (b) in Yokoshima
    polder, Kumamoto. Before the 2016 Kumamoto Earthquake, a tractor-mounted implement
    was used for plowing to create ridges and furrows in the cultivation of tomatoes.
    For the double ridge planting cultivation, the ridge height was 30 cm, and the
    top width was 90 cm. The ridges were covered with white polyethylene sheets having
    holes (120 mm in diameter) at a distance of 50 cm spread over the ridges. Cherry
    tomato seedlings (Solanum lycopersicum L. cv Aiko) (Sakata Seed Co.) were transplanted
    in the holes in October 2015 and have been harvested since the planting period.
    The characteristics and innovation of salt-tolerant cherry tomato cultivars are
    described by [15,16]. For tomato cultivation, pumping well water (EC = 0.106 dS
    m−1) from groundwater at 50 m was used as drip irrigation. On April 14th, the
    2016 Kumamoto Earthquake occurred, and JMA reported approximately M6.0 in the
    region [1]. Although the earthquake caused liquefaction, which increased the spatial
    variability of soil salinity levels near the soil surface, tomato cultivation
    was maintained at the end of May 2016. In June 2016, a soil survey was conducted
    to examine the effects of liquefaction on the chemical and physical characteristics
    of the soils. We also investigated the size of cracks and channels under the liquefaction
    spot around P2 (Fig. 3a). For the image analysis of the cracks caused by the liquefaction,
    we used the open-software platform ImageJ (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/). 2.2. Field
    measurements using the WSNS with TDT sensors Our developed WSNS consists of a
    base station, which is the primary device that receives data from the sensor-connected
    edge devices (the extension units). By incorporating wireless modules, namely
    the ZigBee wireless module (XBee) for short-range communication around the sensor
    and the wireless module (3GIM) for long-range communication utilizing cellular
    networks, into Arduino (as shown in Fig. 2), it is possible to achieve data collection
    through wireless communication and store the data on the cloud. The control program
    for the system was developed using Arduino language, which is a modified and extended
    version of the C/C++ programming language and the standard programming language
    for Arduino. In moisture and salinity measurement using TDT sensors, the system
    measures the waveform of the step-pulse-like transmission signal and performs
    waveform analysis based on signal propagation time and attenuation of signal strength.
    This analysis allows for determining the dielectric constant of bulk soil (εb)
    and bulk electrical conductivity (ECb). However, due to increased data communication
    volume from acquiring and storing waveform data, this system reads the processed
    εb and ECb values from within the TDT sensor [11]. Furthermore, the system includes
    a circuit integrated into the homemade connection board [11], allowing for the
    transmission of alerts when the battery level is low. To ensure a reliable power
    supply, a 20W solar panel and a 20Ah lead-acid battery were chosen as the independent
    power source. Additionally, a sleep mode was implemented to minimize power consumption
    during idle periods, excluding data transmission and reception. In early April
    2016, we began a study at the research site to monitor εb and ECb using the WSNS
    with TDT sensors (Acclima). By sending a command to acquire sensor data from the
    base unit to the extension units, it was possible to acquire the values of εb
    and ECb from the three extension units (Fig. 2). Since the Arduino did not have
    a clock function, we first obtained the real-time on the server and sent and received
    data to the extension units. After sending/receiving data, a sleep mode was used
    to reduce power consumption. Three TDT probes were installed horizontally at depths
    of 10, 20, and 40 cm from the top of ridges at three locations (P1, P2, and P3)
    (Fig. 3a). At the same depth, soil temperature was measured using thermocouples
    at P1. The WSNS, with a 20 Ah battery, was powered by a 20W solar panel and settled
    outside the greenhouse. TDT measurement data were recorded every hour in the WSNS
    and uploaded to the data server. The εb was converted to θ using Topp''s eq [17].
    For the temperature-correction of ECb (values at 25°C (ECb25)), the following
    equation was used [18]: (1) where T is soil temperature (K). For the estimation
    of ECw, we used the Hilhorst model [19] expressed by: (2) where εw is the dielectric
    constant of water (78.5 at 25°C), ε0 is estimated εb when ECb is 0. The ε0 is
    an empirical parameter, and it was determined using sampled soil in a walk-in
    temperature-controlled laboratory at the standard temperature of 25°C [8]. In
    this study, the estimated ε0 was 3.46, the appropriate value ranging from 3.1
    to 5.8 for clayey soil [20]. 2.3. Flood leaching In July 2016, the mulch and top
    roof of the greenhouse were removed, followed by rotary plowing down to a depth
    of 20 cm at the end of the harvesting process. A ridge was then created around
    the experimental field. According to [21], the recommended electrical conductivity
    (EC) level for irrigation water to comply with agricultural water quality standards
    is below 0.3 dS m–1. Throughout different seasons, the EC of the irrigation water
    in the waterway remained below 0.1 dS m–1. Therefore, flood leaching was performed
    using water from the agricultural waterway. The leaching water was added, and
    a water depth of approximately 5 cm (flooded condition) was maintained for one
    week in early July and August 2016, respectively. 2.4. ERT survey after the Kumamoto
    Earthquake On 28 July 2016, in the middle of the two leaching events, an ERT survey
    was carried out to observe two-dimensional ECb distribution. We determined three
    parallel survey lines (Lines 1, 2, and 3) from the seaside. Lines 1 and 2 contained
    liquefaction sites near the soil surface, and Line 3 was a control site as no
    liquefaction site. The survey line space was 2.5 m, and each line had 50 electrodes
    with an electrode spacing of 0.5 m (Fig.3b). Using a Profiler-4 system manufactured
    by OYO Corporation, the electrical potential was measured between the electrodes.
    Resistivity distributions were obtained from the 2D inversions of the in-line
    survey data with a 2D inversion program entitled ”E-Tomo ver. 4.1” [22]. Through
    the analysis, the vertical observation points were depths of 0, 0.4, 0.8, 1.3,
    1.9, 2.7, 3.7, 4.8, 6.0, 7.4, and 8.9 m. An additional ERT survey was conducted
    at a survey line (Line 0) along the watercourse to understand whether saltwater
    intrusion occurred from the seaside to the greenhouse. The survey line along the
    watercourse had 50 electrodes, and the electrode spacing was 1.0 m (Fig.3a), providing
    2D spatial resistivity information down to 10 m deep. 3. Results and discussion
    3.1. Validation of the WSNS prototype performance Fig. 4 shows temporal changes
    in θ and ECw at depths of 10, 20, and 40 cm from the top of ridges at three locations
    (P1, P2, and P3) using the WSNS prototype. In the figure, the occurrence times
    of the foreshock and mainshock are indicated by dashed lines. There was no physical
    damage to the WSNS due to the earthquake. In Fig. 4, the data loss period was
    omitted due to a lack of server capacity. The lack of server capacity was improved
    after May 7. Download : Download high-res image (546KB) Download : Download full-size

    and ECw at three depths (10 (d), 20 (e), 40 cm (f)) at three locations (P1, P2,
    and P3) of the damaged agricultural field. Table 1 shows the percentages of data
    missing (= the number of missing data/ total data number) at observed depths and
    locations for the WSNS. Before-and-after the mainshock, the loss rates for the
    extension units P1, P2, and P3 differed. Especially at the extension unit P1,
    the percentage of missing data was 33%, the highest among the WSNS prototype.
    We did not investigate corrosion and poor synchronization of the XBee module for

    the WSNS in the field, we tested the WSNS mesh-topology: the extension units exchange
    information with neighbors to create a multi-hop network. Using the XBee configuration
    software XCTU, we confirmed the 1:n communication path by the extension unit (not
    shown). Since XBee automatically changes the communication path of the mesh network,
    it has a function that allows direct communication with the base unit or detour
    communication via another extension unit, even if some extension units fail. It
    is speculated that this function improved the data acquisition stability even
    when the extension unit''s data was missing (Table 1). In addition, the WSNS hardware
    performance can vary significantly depending on site conditions. In this study,
    the wireless communication distance between the base and extension units was about
    300 m under the site conditions, suggesting that the wireless communication was
    successful on the greenhouse scale. Since the WSNS operates on battery power,
    overall power consumption becomes a critical constraint. In this study, stable
    continuous operation for 1 hr of data acquisition was possible using a solar panel
    (20 W) and battery (20 Ah) out of the greenhouse. This wired power supply approach
    would be a significant drawback, as the extension units for WSNS will be deployed
    in the greenhouse. Additionally, multi-point measurements using the WSNS might
    reduce the work efficiency of tomato cultivation, so miniaturization of the extension
    unit, including each solar panel and battery, was expected. On the other hand,
    the WSNS operated while the vast disaster disrupted various lifelines. The WSNS,
    such as a stand-alone sensing measurement, was even more valuable in preparing
    for disaster management. 3.2. Field investigation Even before the foreshock on
    April 14, the spatial variability of θ was confirmed, and θ at P1 was the highest
    among the WSNS observation points (Fig. 4a, 4b, 4c). The groundwater level (GWL)
    was as shallow as about 50 cm from the surface of the ridge at P1. θ at 40 cm
    deep of P1 was the almost saturated condition. ECw varied from 5 to 11 dS m−1
    at the three depths of P1, P2, and P3 locations, and the average of ECw at 10
    cm between the three locations was 10 dS m−1 before the foreshock on April 14
    (Fig. 4d, 4e, 4f). In the rhizosphere, the spatial variation of θ and ECw can
    be influenced by factors such as irrigation water, liquid fertilizer, and root
    distribution. However, the presence of high ECw values suggests the influence
    of saline groundwater (EC = 6.2 dS m−1) as the underlying condition, resulting
    in the accumulation of salts near the soil surface. Tomatoes grew as well until
    the foreshock in 2016, as they did under the shallow saline groundwater conditions
    in 2015 (not shown), suggesting high salinity tolerant of the tomatoes. Due to
    the foreshock and mainshock from April 14 to 16, muddy water containing sand spouted,
    and ponding conditions between the ridges, a so-called liquefaction phenomenon,
    were observed locally inside the greenhouse (Fig. 5a). The liquefied sand in the
    muddy water, also named a sand boil [[23], [24], [25], [26]], is the most common
    and dominant seismic liquefaction structure type in polders. The details of liquefaction
    structures and models are shown in [27]. Especially at P2, the liquefaction and
    sand boil occurred severely. Through θ and ECw monitoring at three locations and
    three depths, rapid increases in θ and ECw were confirmed at depths of 10 and
    20 cm at P2 (Fig. 4b and 4e). These findings suggest the local upward bypass flow
    accompanying the initiation of cracks and channels in the formation process of
    sand boil under shallow saline groundwater conditions. In addition, since the
    TDT sensor is a contact sensor, an increase in ρb might affect θ. Download : Download

    near the soil surface due to the earthquake (a), death of tomato plants at P2
    (b), and a channel between the soil surface and groundwater around the P2 location
    (c). In May 2016, tomato leaves and fruits were damaged, and ECw at a depth of
    10 cm was 1.5 times higher than before the Earthquake (Fig. 4d). The high salinity
    level could not be controlled by drip irrigation at all. Fig. 5b shows visible
    color changes from green to yellow or brown around P2, where maximum ECw reached
    17.4 dS m−1, resulting in the onset of leaf death. Such hotspots existed in the
    greenhouse (Fig. 3a), implying spatial variability of high salinity. Through a
    soil sampling survey near the soil surface in June, a physical and chemical analysis
    of soil with/without the sand boil was conducted. The percentage of sand content
    for soil containing the soil crater was 55%. EC1:5 and chloride ion concentration
    were higher than in areas where the sand boils did not occur (Table 2). On the
    other hand, nutrients such as inorganic nitrogen and phosphonic acid were lower
    because the sand boils erupted from the deeper soil layer under the saline groundwater.
    At the liquefaction site around P2, we found a large crack, making a bypass flow
    channel between the soil surface and the groundwater (Fig. 5c). The minimum and
    maximum widths of the skewed crack were 1.2 cm and 5.7 cm, respectively. The length
    of the skewed crack was 62 cm when GWL was 50 cm. Such cracks increased the high
    spatial variability of soil salinity in the root zone. In May 2016, there was
    a 44% decrease in the total yield of cherry tomatoes in the greenhouse when compared
    to May 2015 (the previous year before the Earthquake). Table 2. Effects of liquefaction

    in the root zone, the first flood-leaching process was implemented in early July
    2016. Although [27] recommends that flooded leaching treatments last for a couple
    of days, a water depth of approximately 5 cm (flooded condition) was maintained
    to remove salt from the root zone in 7 days. Fig. 6a shows the two-dimensional
    ECb profiles converted by ERT on three parallel lines (Lines 1, 2, and 3). The
    entire measurement grid size was 6 × 50 m (0.5 m node spacing) for the XY coordinate,
    where Lines 1, 2, and 3 were located at Y= -2.5, 0, and 2.5 m. The ECb on each
    line was plotted to a depth of 5.0 m in the XZ coordinate. ECb in the root zone
    was approximately less than 2 dS m−1 and increased in the deeper soil layer, suggesting
    that the first leaching treatment improved the desalinization process through
    the root zone. However, some ECb hotspots still existed at Lines 1 and 2. Primarily,
    a location of the XZ coordinate (38, 0) on Line 2, where the crack was investigated,
    remained higher ECb value. Download : Download high-res image (782KB) Download

    (Lines 1 through 3) (a) and comparison of two-dimensional ECb profiles in the
    greenhouse and along the watercourse through ERT line survey on 29 Jul. 2016 (b).
    An adverse effect of bypass flow on salt leaching through cracks is the increase
    in the leaching requirement (LR), the fraction of infiltrated water that must
    pass through the root zone to prevent soil salinity from exceeding a level that
    would significantly reduce crop yield [7]. Because of the adverse bypass flow
    effect, the P2 location needed much more water to wash away the salts. In addition,
    if undetected cracks existed beyond the ERT survey, we concluded that additional
    leaching treatment was required. However, our findings were heterogeneity of ECb
    for the saline groundwater, varied from 2 to 14 dS m−1 between depths of 2 and
    5 m from Line 1 through Line 3. Significant lateral flow from the seaside would
    change the desalinization process scenario in the greenhouse''s root zone. For
    the evaluation of lateral flow from the seaside, Fig. 6b shows the ECb profile
    to a depth of 10 m on Line 0 outside of the greenhouse (Fig. 3a). As a result,
    ECb was 3 dS m−1 at a depth of 10 m near the seaside. This assumes that saltwater
    intrusion from the seaside was negligible because it might be avoided by the watercourse,
    contributing to the maintenance of the freshwater zone between the greenhouse
    and the Ariake sea. 3.4. Validation of the flooded leaching effect In early August
    2016, the second flood-leaching treatment was conducted, and then we temporarily
    investigated θ and ECb profiles at the exact location (P1, P2, and P3). Fig. 7
    shows examples of spatial and temporal variability in θ and ECb obtained from
    the TDT measurements and ERT survey (only available on Lines 1 and 2). Measurements
    are from 4 days, 10 Apr., 10 May, 28 Jul., and 14 Sep. 2016. The upper, middle,
    and lower panels show measurement data at P1, P2, and P3, respectively. In the
    right-hand panels (Fig. 7c, 7f, 7i), θ•ECw was calculated to determine the total
    solute concentration per volume of soil. Download : Download high-res image (404KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Profiles of θ, ECb, and θ•ECw at location
    P1 (a, b, c), location P2 (d, e, f), and location P3 (g, h, i) before-and-after
    flood leaching on 10 Apr., 10 May, 28 Jul., and 14 Sep. 2016. Regarding “θ•ECw”,
    soil salinity is the salinity mass per unit volume of soil (g m−3) and is expressed
    as the product of soil salinity and θ [28]. Since salinity is positively correlated
    with ECw, “θ•ECw” may be used as an index of soil salinity in unsaturated conditions.
    For example, change in θ•ECw was used to infer good soybean growth in the desalinization
    process of the 2011 Tohoku tsunami-affected farmlands [7,11] found θ•ECw was approximately
    1 for good soybean growth. Tomatoes with salinity tolerance would survive in the
    range of higher θ•ECw, but θ•ECw of 1.0 might be a good reference value to consider
    the dimensionless value of θ•ECw relatively. Before-and-after the flooded leaching
    treatments θ varied from 0.2 to 0.53 in the root zone (Fig. 7a, 7d, 7g). GWL was
    at least 65 cm, so that θ was the saturated condition (θ= 0.55 m3 m–3) below a
    depth of 65 cm. Based on ECb profiles, depending on θ (Fig. 7b, 7e, 7h), θ•ECw
    was calculated to a depth of 90 cm. Before the Earthquake, the average of θ•ECw
    between depths of 10cm and 40cm at P1, P2, and P3 were 4.9, 3.1, and 2.6, respectively
    (Fig. 7c, 7f, 7i). After the earthquake, the average of θ•ECw increased to 5.8
    and 6.9 at P1 and P2, where wilting tomato plants occurred. Therefore, the threshold
    of θ•ECw for good tomato growth would be around 5. According to [29], salt damage
    was observed at an ECe (electrical conductivity of the saturated soil paste extract)
    of 10.0 dS m−1, and complete withering occurred at an ECe of 20.0 dS m−1 for other
    tomato species. The empirical relationship between the ECe and ECw can be expressed
    with [18]: (3) where ρb is the bulk density. The wide range of ECe (< 20.0 dS
    m−1) and field water capacity (θ ≈ 0.45 m3 m−3) supports our θ•ECw observations.
    Using Eq. (3), a high θ•ECw (ECw > 16 dS m−1) indicates wilting of tomato plants,
    although it is essential to note that the proper θ level can vary depending on
    soil types. On 14 Sep., after the second flooded leaching treatment, the average
    of θ•ECw at all locations decreased significantly to 2.6, lower than the threshold
    value for good tomato growth. For the desalinization process of salinity soil,
    we cannot be sure that the flooded leaching is practical, but we can be reasonably
    sure that salt leaching by rainfall is effective in a temperate climate. The effects
    of the flooded leaching process and solute leaching by rainfall on soil salinity
    management were investigated in tsunami-affected farmlands [7]. For the recovery
    of agriculture in a short period, flooded leaching must be the most effective
    treatment, but not for cracks and channels. Because of the adverse bypath flow
    effects [30], natural rainfall helped to reduce the salinity levels. In this study,
    total rainfall between the middle of Aug. and Sep. was 147 mm. The amount of rainfall
    corresponded to the total amount of flooded leaching water if the unit gradient
    flow was assumed under unsaturated conditions. This combination of the desalinization
    processes was the most plausible explanation for accomplishing sufficient salt
    exclusion to recover the tomato growth. Indeed, the tomatoes grew well in October
    2016. 4. Conclusions While the 2016 Kumamoto Earthquake occurred, the WSNS with
    TDT sensors captured rapid increases in θ and ECw due to soil liquefaction and
    sand boil under shallow saline groundwater conditions in a lowland polder. Our
    findings were a sand boil channel as a bypass flow pathway, making sands vent
    out with upwelling water from groundwater in the greenhouse. Soil liquefaction
    and sand boil caused considerably high temporal and spatial heterogeneity of soil
    salinity, resulting in the death of salt-tolerant tomatoes in a month. The WSNS
    performed adequately enough to measure ECw from 4 to 17 dS m–1 when θ varied from
    0.33 to 0.55 m3 m–3 before-and-after the 2016 Kumamoto Earthquake. A significant
    benefit of the real-time data was the decision-making support for scheduling flooded-leaching
    treatments. Although the percentage of missing data reached 33% due to a poor
    wiring connection at P1, there were no wireless communication and power consumption
    problems in the WSNS prototype. The 1-week flooded leaching treatments were successful
    in reducing the high salinity levels, except in the vicinity of the sand boil
    channel as observed through the ERT survey. In addition to the flooded leaching,
    natural rainfall (with a total amount of 147 mm, equivalent to the volume of water
    used for the flooded leaching) could also be utilized for salt leaching in macropores
    and channels, providing a practical solution. Even though a strong earthquake
    changed the soil structure above the shallow groundwater in a polder, the watercourse
    around a polder could prevent saltwater intrusion from the seaside. Consequently,
    soil desalinization was completed in 4 months, and the tomatoes grew well during
    the next cultivation season. We believe our analysis may contribute to implementing
    soil salinity management strategies to recover agricultural production in a polder.

    SECTION I. Introduction The Internet of Things (IoT) and machine-to-machine (M2M)
    are the fastest growing areas of cutting-edge technologies, with the number of
    connected devices now massively outnumbering humans. The International Telecommunication
    Union (ITU) defines the IoT as a global infrastructure for the information society,
    enabling advanced services by interconnecting physical and virtual things based
    on existing and evolving interoperable information and communication technologies
    [1]. M2M is considered an integral part of the IoT ecosystem, defined as a communication
    that allows devices to connect with one another across a wired or wireless communication
    network without the need for human intervention [2]. Intelligent sensors, advanced
    wireless technologies, and autonomic computing software are used to assist a network
    device in understanding and transmitting data and making decisions in an M2M system
    [3]. Recently, the evolution of numerous wireless communication technologies,
    such as intelligent reflecting surfaces [4], massive MIMO [5], and ambient backscattering
    [6], have substantially increased the potential capabilities of IoT/M2M technologies
    and made them more common than ever, as their convergence has become necessary
    to meet the ever-increasing requirements of IoT/M2M. Among different wireless
    communication technologies, ambient backscatter has been emerging for large-scale
    IoT/M2M applications that can allow the transmission of data without requiring
    power from the IoT device and facilitates device-to-device (D2D) and even multihop
    communications. By reflecting far-field electromagnetic (EM) waves from ambient
    radio frequency (RF) transmitters, a tiny passive gadget can send data with very
    low power consumption. This cutting-edge technology can effectively solve the
    battery problem faced by massive low-power devices in large-scale IoT/M2M communications
    [7], [8], [9]. The heterogeneous networks (HetNets) operating on different wireless
    communication technologies, especially wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and mobile
    cellular networks (MCNs), offer numerous applications in many industrial sectors,
    such as home automation, industry, healthcare, agriculture, and smart cities [10].
    Among these applications, smart buildings are emerging, which support the flow
    of information throughout the building, providing advanced functionalities and
    services, allowing the automatic control, monitoring, management, and maintenance
    of the various subsystems or applications of the building in an optimal and integrated
    way, locally and/or remotely [11]. There are many research papers dealing with
    wireless network-based IoT/M2M smart building systems, whether MCN or WSN [12],
    [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], which will be discussed in detail
    in the related work part. Comparing the proposed system with all these research
    works, the drawbacks of existing building management systems include the lack
    of using IoT and M2M technologies together, reliance on one or two wireless communication
    technologies at most, a limited wireless transmission range, mostly inconveniently
    designed user interface, and excessive costs. Therefore, our approach presents
    a hybrid (local and remote) and a low-cost IoT/M2M-based smart building system
    with a user-pleasant smartphone interface. The proposed system comprises several
    main services: smart parking, garden irrigation automation, intrusion alarm, smart
    door, fire and gas detection, smart lighting, smart medication reminder, and indoor
    air quality (IAQ) monitoring. All these services can be controlled and monitored
    remotely by our mobile application named “Raniso,” which is used as a local server
    to control the building via different HetNets, such as RF identification (RFID)/Bluetooth/Wi-Fi
    connectivity and cellular networks, such as global system for mobile (GSM), 4G,
    or 5G. In addition, the proposed system connects all smart devices in an energy-efficient,
    secure, convenient, and cost-effective manner. This article is an extension of
    our previous works in [11] and [21] to develop an IoT/M2M smart building prototype
    using several compatible sensors, actuators, and modules, besides the Raniso App.
    In addition to receiving data from the smart building, the system also stores
    data in the cloud database and displays it visually on the ThingSpeak webpage,
    as well as remotely monitoring it via the Raniso App. SECTION II. State of the
    Art A. Motivations and Research Contributions Heterogeneous wireless networks
    are of growing interest in several areas, including IoT/M2M smart building automation,
    which has developed at a rapid pace over the past few years. The main benefits
    of smart buildings are reduced maintenance expenses, reduced energy consumption,
    comfort, tranquility, entertainment, safety, security, improved productivity,
    more livable structures, and higher resale value. Despite the great applicability
    of the IoT in the implementation of smart building systems, there is a lack of
    strategies that involve the integration of IoT and M2M technologies in most existing
    systems. Besides relying on only one or two wireless communication technologies,
    most of the existing studies also suffer from limited wireless range connectivity,
    poorly designed user interfaces, and high costs. As a means of addressing these
    issues and reducing existing smart building system limitations, this study proposes
    an adaptive control of IoT/M2M devices in smart buildings using heterogeneous
    wireless networks to expand the scope of connectivity and allow users to control
    their building easily and efficiently by choosing the appropriate connection,
    whether it is WSN or MCN, through a user-friendly interface using smartphones
    via the Raniso App, regardless of time and location. Costs are reduced by using
    effective and affordable components, as well as the Raniso App, which is free
    to manage, monitor, and control building devices and conditions over various HetNets.
    The research contribution is summarized as a design for adaptive control of IoT/M2M
    devices in smart buildings using our developed mobile application Raniso via heterogeneous
    wireless networks. As a result, we have listed the contributions of this research
    work in the following: discussing and comparing related work on IoT/M2M smart
    building-based wireless technologies with the proposed system; development, implementation,
    and design of adaptive control for IoT/M2M devices connected to HetNets in smart
    building systems using Arduino and NodeMCU boards with heterogeneous low-cost
    and small-sized sensors and actuators; dynamic use and intelligent management
    of IoT/M2M devices to facilitate monitoring and control of smart building systems
    via IoT platform ThingSpeak and via our free mobile app “Raniso”; proposing eight
    innovative services for smart buildings, including smart parking, garden irrigation
    automation, intrusion alarm, smart door, fire and gas detection, smart lighting,
    smart medication reminder, and IAQ monitoring; validation of the functionality
    of the proposed system in terms of adaptation, control, automation, safety, comfort,
    energy efficiency, and performance. B. Related Works Recently, with the evolution
    of IoT/M2M applications based on heterogeneous wireless networks, there has been
    a rapid progression of smart home applications with a gradual increase in the
    size of the automated environments, starting from the living room and moving to
    the apartment, then to entire buildings, and, finally, to the more general scenario
    of smart cities. In this section, previous research works related to IoT/M2M smart
    building-based wireless technologies, either WSNs or MCNs or both, are reviewed.
    Basnayake et al. [12] present the development of an Artificial Intelligence-Based
    Smart Building Automation Controller (AIBSBAC) that includes an intelligent user
    identification subsystem, an intelligent decision-making subsystem, internal and
    external environment observation subsystems, and a universal infrared communication
    system. The AIBSBAC system can dynamically adapt to the user’s choices, which
    are aimed at improving energy efficiency, user comfort, and security. Heterogeneous
    wireless connectivity, represented by RF, Ethernet, and Bluetooth technologies,
    connects AIBSBAC to electrical devices. In contrast, the proposed system only
    included a few applications and ignored many of the other important applications
    (such as fire detection and gas detection). The work in [13] presents a smart
    building system adaptable to office environments. The proposed system is based
    on the ZigBee WSN that has been coupled with Java and Android to develop a platform
    for automated and manual control of devices to track real-time environmental data
    of smart building systems. However, using only ZigBee as a WSN in the system has
    disadvantages, including short range, low data transmission speed, high maintenance
    cost, low transmission, and low network stability. Badabaji and Nagaraju [14]
    focused on monitoring home appliances via IoT using various sensors to monitor
    temperature, fire, and gas, and an LCD screen to display the sensor’s values.
    When gas leaks or fires are discovered, the system quickly sends a text message
    to the user’s cell phone and activates the siren, and the spray engine is activated
    and displays a message on an LCD screen to warn users. While the IoT is used to
    improve security, where communication between sensors and transducers is accomplished
    wirelessly using a single chip via Wi-Fi, despite this, the system has some limitations:
    the Wi-Fi data transfer rate decreases as the number of users increases, and GSM
    is expensive due to SMS charges. A home prototype system based on heterogeneous
    wireless networks (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and RFID) for control and monitoring is proposed
    in [15]. The system is based on two components: the first one is an automation
    system that was built using an Arduino UNO, which is responsible for reading and
    processing different types of sensor values; the second component is the security
    system and outdoor lighting using NodeMCU to monitor the home security status
    from anywhere through a specialized graphical user interface (GUI) that was programmed
    in HTML and allows the user to monitor the home security and turn on and off the
    outdoor lights using a particular Internet protocol (IP) address provided by NodeMCU.
    However, the applications implemented are very basic and not innovative in addition
    to neglecting the user’s right to choose their wireless communication preferences.
    In [16], an IoT-based portable automation system called IoT@HoMe for smart homes
    was designed and manufactured using NodeMCU as the microcontroller and Internet
    gateway. In addition to using several sensors to monitor various parameters related
    to the building, various actuators perform control activities of home devices.
    The main objective of this research is to create an efficient, affordable, and
    portable system that can easily monitor home conditions and operate home devices
    over the Internet at any time and from any location. Similarly, another research
    work [17] presented a multifunctional smart home system using a microweb server
    based on an Arduino Yún microcontroller with Internet connectivity via an Android-based
    mobile application. The system can be controlled even if there is no Wi-Fi connection
    available, as it can be accessed via MCNs (e.g., 3G or 4G networks). Despite this,
    both of these studies [16], [17] remain limited in which they rely solely on the
    Internet for their communications and did not take into account the unavailability
    or interruptions of the Internet in some regions. In [18], an IoT-based smart
    building system for indoor environmental management was proposed and implemented
    using a Raspberry Pi 3 with a camera, an obstacle sensor, and several environmental
    sensors to detect smart building parameters, such as temperature, humidity, brightness,
    and air quality. The Raspberry Pi was programmed to collect data from the sensors
    and a photograph taken by the camera every 15 min. In addition, the Raspberry
    Pi was equipped with a light neural network that could count the number of people
    in the room based on the photographs taken by the camera. When the user is outside
    the coverage area of the Wi-Fi AP, he/she is unable to contact the server and
    cannot directly use the smartphone to transmit commands to the Raspberry Pi controller.
    Omran et al. [19] discuss an affordable, safe, and energy-efficient Wi-Fi-based
    smart home system that enables homeowners to monitor their appliances from their
    mobile phones at home or remotely. This system uses Raspberry Pi and Arduino Mega
    as microcontrollers and Internet gateways for IoT automation monitoring and control.
    Numerous sensors and actuators are used in the system to monitor multiple home-related
    parameters via the Blynk app. Despite this, sometimes Blynk App becomes unresponsive
    and displays data/output that could be false in some cases. Also, in some cases,
    Blynk App’s notifications are delayed in sending to the user. In [20], a smart
    building fire and gas leakage alert system, namely, SB112, which combines a small-size
    multisensor-based scheme with an open-source edge computing framework and an automated
    next-generation (NG) 112 emergency call functionality, was proposed using ESP32
    as microcontrollers units and Raspberry Pi as Edge gateway. As part of an end-to-end
    scenario, crucial actors, such as IoT devices, public safety answering points
    (PSAPs), middleware for a smart city platform, and relevant operators, are involved.
    However, only the fire and gas leakage alert system was used, while other important
    systems that should be in the smart building, related to energy consumption and
    comfort, for example, were ignored. Table I summarizes and reviews previous research
    works related to wireless network-based IoT/M2M smart building systems. The comparison
    of our proposed IoT/M2M smart building using heterogeneous wireless networks with
    existing systems also highlights its main advantages over these systems. As shown
    in Table I, the proposed system aims to overcome the limitations of the existing
    systems. It is based on a simulated scenario with a real implementation for validation
    purposes. In addition, the main advantages of our system include the ability to
    connect to the Internet, cloud platforms, and various heterogeneous wireless networks,
    with support for multiple heterogeneous devices (sensors, actuators, and shields).
    Users also have the option to control IoT/M2M devices using either push buttons,
    WSN (Bluetooth or Wi-Fi), MCN [GSM or long term evolution (LTE)], or voice commands
    via Google Assistant. In addition, the Raniso app consists of user-friendly graphical
    interfaces that control and monitor building system devices and alert users in
    case of danger, as well as a visual display that allows users to monitor all building
    parameters in real time without the Internet, both indoors and outdoors, such
    as temperature, humidity, air quality, building condition, and whether it is safe
    or not. Furthermore, the system that we proposed consists of many smart applications
    and services that should be part of any smart building system, including smart
    parking, garden irrigation automation, intrusion alarm, smart door, fire and gas
    detection, smart lighting, smart medication reminder, and IAQ monitoring. All
    of these proposed services contributed to improving safety, comfort, energy savings,
    and internal and external care in the building system. TABLE I Comparison of Related
    Works SECTION III. Proposed IoT/M2M-Based Smart Building System Using Heterogeneous
    Networks The proposed HetNet infrastructure for the IoT/M2M smart building consists
    of WSNs and mobile-cellular networks. WSNs are concerned with communication between
    devices in the building and include wireless local area networks (WLANs), such
    as Wi-Fi (IEEE802.11x), which supports small area connectivity, and wireless personal
    area networks (WPANs), such as Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15. 1) and RFID, which supports
    short-range connectivity for communication between personal devices. In contrast,
    MCNs are the communication network between devices in the building and devices
    in the outside network and include wireless wide area networks (WWANs) that use
    mobile telecommunication cellular network technologies, such as 2G (GSM), 3G [universal
    mobile telecommunications system (UMTS)], 4G (LTE), and 5G. The following expression
    describes the proposed HetNet infrastructure for the IoT/M2M smart building system:  HetNets
    = WSNs WLANs W i−Fi + WPANs Blutooth,RFID  + MCNS WWANs GSM,UMTS,LTE  ⋅ (1) View
    Source The convergence of two HetNets, such as WSNs and MCNs, enhances M2M communication
    and IoT technology. Converged networks can be divided into four categories: device
    convergence, protocol convergence, service convergence, and full convergence of
    any user’s devices, communication protocols, and network services [22], [23].
    The full convergence can be expressed as  Full  Convergence  =  Device  Convergence  +  Protocol  Convergence  +  Service  Convergence  .
    (2) View Source In WSNs, the smart mobile user equipment (UE) gateway moves into
    the coverage area of the sensor nodes, broadcasts beacon packets to these nodes,
    and provides backhaul access to these WSN nodes. MCN can send the detected WSN
    data directly to a central data center [24]. The main disadvantages of WSNs include
    less mobility robustness, small coverage, and weak terminals. MCNs, on the other
    hand, provide more layer control, a longer network lifetime, and Quality of Service
    (QoS) for WSN applications and have the advantages of reliable mobility, broad
    coverage, and powerful user terminals but are expensive and difficult to deploy
    and manage [25]. The convergence of MCN and WSN can benefit each other: MCNs provide
    a greater level of layer control and optimization to increase network life and
    WSN performance and to provide better QoS with the use of WSNs; WSNs may operate
    as cognitive and intelligent enablers of MCNs, wireless services, and increasingly
    data-centric applications are enabled by the architecture of WSN and MCN convergence
    networks; MCNs have the potential to make WSNs more energy efficient and improve
    network performance; and mobile MCN terminals act both as sensor nodes and gateways
    for WSNs [26]. In addition, sensor nodes in WSN and MCN convergence networks collect
    data and send it to a data server through MCN [27]. A. System Architecture Design
    The proposed architecture design for IoT/M2M smart building system based on HetNets
    uses different known hardware to collect data and manage it according to a business’
    functions and services. The main services offered are smart parking, garden irrigation
    automation, intrusion alarm, smart door, fire and gas detection, smart lighting,
    smart medication reminder, and IAQ monitoring. All these services are designed
    and implemented to remotely control and monitor the building through the Raniso
    App via RFID/Bluetooth/ Wi-Fi connectivity and cellular networks, such as GSM,
    4G, or 5G. This IoT/M2M smart building infrastructure design helps owners, operators,
    and facility managers improve asset reliability and performance and is beneficial
    in preventing the loss of resources and human lives caused by undesired events.
    Moreover, the proposed system is energy-efficient and low-cost that can be used
    in various buildings, including hospitals, hotels, universities, businesses, and
    so on. Fig. 1 shows the proposed architectural design. Fig. 1. M2M IoT smart building
    architecture. Show All B. System Hardware and Software In the proposed IoT/M2M
    smart building system based on HetNets networks, we use different sensors and
    actuators to collect data and manage it according to services, where the Arduino
    microcontroller represents the brain. Besides, the NodeMCU board and other modules,
    such as Bluetooth HC-06, Sim800l, and RFID, are used for wireless communication.
    The main hardware components used are described in Table II, whereas the software
    used is defined in Table III. Next, we discuss the design and implementation of
    the proposed system. TABLE II Main Specifications of Hardware Used TABLE III Main
    Specifications of Software Used SECTION IV. Designing and Implementing IoT/M2M
    Smart Building Services This Section is devoted to the simulations and practical
    implementation of IoT/M2M smart building services. There are two different forms
    of main processing units used in the deployment of all these services, which are
    Arduino and NodeMCU. The Arduino will be used as the controller of the devices,
    while NodeMCU will be the controller of the phone devices so that it can control
    the appliances from far away. In the following, we discuss each smart application
    prototype explicitly. A. Smart Parking Smart parking involves an IoT/M2M-based
    system that sends data on the availability of all parking places in real time
    and selects the optimal one. The system comprises an Arduino Uno microcontroller,
    a NodeMCU board, infrared sensors (TCRT5000), a servo motor, LCD, a speaker, and
    a battery. Fig. 3 shows the proposed system prototype for smart parking. Fig.
    2. Different interfaces of the Raniso App used for the proposed IoT/M2M smart
    building. Show All Fig. 3. Proposed system prototype for smart parking. Show All
    Using infrared sensors, the system identifies whether parking spaces are occupied,
    then scans the number of available spaces, and updates data with the cloud server
    every 30 s. The parking slot availability may be checked online from anywhere
    and perform hassle-free parking through the smart parking interface of the Raniso
    App as shown in Fig. 4. Also, the LCD placed in front of the gate will show which
    slot is free; besides, when a vehicle is detected in a specific slot, the corresponding
    LED in the Raniso App lights up. If all spaces are occupied by vehicles, the parking
    gate will not open, and the audio system will say: “sorry, this parking lot is
    full, you can search for another available parking lot via the Raniso app.” If
    any spaces are available, the parking gate will open, allowing the vehicle to
    pass, and the audio system will welcome the user. As a result, this system solves
    the city parking problem and provides users with a reliable M2M/IoT-based parking
    management solution. With this solution, users can easily find available, nearby,
    and cheap parking using the interface of the Raniso app equipped with GPS technology,
    wherever they are and whenever they want, as shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 4. Smart Parking
    interface on the Raniso App. Show All Fig. 5. Search results for car parks near
    the user’s location on Raniso App. Show All B. Garden Irrigation Automation System
    The proposed irrigation automation system for gardens refers to the system’s functionality
    with no or just a minimum of manual intervention, where it monitors the plant’s
    temperature, humidity, light levels, and soil moisture (see Fig. 6). The system
    includes a soil moisture sensor, which is used to measure the percentage of soil
    moisture to optimize the irrigation dosage to eliminate water waste; a DHT11 sensor
    is used to monitor temperature and humidity amounts, an LDR sensor to sense the
    intensity of light, two yellow LEDs for controlling the photosynthesis process
    during the night to make the plant grow faster, the ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)
    to measure the level of water inside the tank, and the GSM module to make calls
    and send text messages to the farmer when the pump changes its state or when there
    is any watering problem; and the LCD screen is used to display the level of water
    and moisture content together with the pump status and two pumps: one for watering
    the plants and the second one for supplying water to the tank. If the soil is
    dry, the irrigation fountain operates, watering the garden at the time of need
    and switches OFF when the soil is wet to save water. In addition, this solution
    allows for remote control and monitoring of the garden irrigation system via the
    Raniso app (see Fig. 7) and via our channel in ThingSpeak, which is used to view
    data from the proposed smart garden system remotely (see Fig. 8), making it easier
    to manage the irrigation systems and make necessary adjustments in real time.
    This system optimizes resources (water, energy, and fertilizers) and irrigation
    scheduling through an intelligent monitoring system. Fig. 6. Illustration of the
    garden irrigation automation system. Show All Fig. 7. Garden irrigation automation
    interface on the Raniso App. Show All Fig. 8. Garden irrigation monitoring system
    on ThingSpeak. Show All C. Intrusion Alarm System The increased number of robberies
    in buildings makes people worried about losing their property. Hence, the proposed
    service presented in Fig. 9 enables the protection of the building from theft
    or attack by using a GSM module, an ultrasonic sensor, a vibration sensor, a speaker,
    and a red LED. The ultrasonic sensor is used to capture the distance and the vibration
    sensor to measure the vibrations. When the distance is close and vibrations are
    detected, the GSM module sends calls and short messages to the owner of the building,
    the LCD screen shows an alarm state, the red LED lights up, and the speaker emits
    a sound indicating that there is a theft, where the resulting sound is obtained
    from a micro SD memory card in MP3 format, which allows users to use the sound
    of screams, a guard dog, or a siren to scare away the thief. In addition, users
    can monitor their building from anywhere at any time via the intrusion alarm interface
    in the Raniso app that sends real-time alerts in the case of any danger, as shown
    in Fig. 10, and via our channel in the ThingSpeak platform, as illustrated in
    Fig. 11. Fig. 9. Intrusion alarm system. Show All Fig. 10. Intrusion alarm interface
    on the Raniso App. Show All Fig. 11. Intrusion alarm system monitoring on ThingSpeak.
    Show All D. Smart Door System The proposed smart door system is an automatic identification
    and authentication system deployed at the doors of various buildings, including
    banks, corporate offices, financial institutions, jewelry stores, government organizations,
    and so on. It is designed to prevent unauthorized access and violation by using
    a Bluetooth module, an RFID module, a servo motor, a keypad, an LCD screen, a
    speaker, a buzzer, and LEDs. Fig. 12 shows the prototype of the proposed smart
    door system. As soon as the user approaches the door, the sound system reminds
    him to disinfect his hands and take all precautions against COVID-19. The LCD
    screen also displays all the options by which the user can control the keyless
    door, either by RFID card, password, or remotely via the smart door system interface
    of the Raniso app using the Bluetooth connection or the Internet via Wi-Fi and
    4G/5G (see Fig. 13). The system will give access using the Raniso app, or on scanning
    the right tag or entering the correct password, and on scanning the wrong tag
    or entering the wrong password; the system will deny; a red LED will light up;
    and the buzzer will make a beep sound. This solution is intended to control doors
    in the building with a relatively low-cost design, user-friendly interface, and
    ease of installation. It also provides a protection system and building security.

    for extinguishing fires and detecting gas leaks is implemented to protect lives
    and property from gas and fire hazards that lead to serious accidents, human injuries,
    and material losses (see Fig. 14). This service is based on a GSM module, a GPS
    shield, servo motors, a flame sensor, a gas leakage sensor, an LCD screen, a speaker,
    and LEDs. Sensors are used to sense fire and gas in the building. Whenever the
    fire or the gas is detected, the alarm rings, the LCD screen displays “There is
    Danger, Not safe here,” a red LED lights up, one servo motor opens the water sprayer,
    and the other one opens the window. In addition, the system not only sends calls
    and SMS alerts to the owner but also sends an SMS along with the location of the
    incident to the fire station and civil protection. The system also guides the
    building owner to a safe, fire-free route through an audio system, and a green
    light. Besides, users can monitor data of gas and fire detection of their buildings
    from anywhere at any time via the Raniso app’s fire and gas alarm interface, which
    sends real-time alerts in the case of fire and gas leaks, as illustrated in Fig.
    15, and via our channel in the ThingSpeak platform, as shown in Fig. 16. Fig.

    Show All F. Smart Lighting Management The proposed system is an advanced smart
    lighting management system based on IoT/M2M technologies and includes two important
    services, namely remote control of lights, shown in Fig. 17, and automatic lights,
    shown in Fig. 18. The proposed system was built using a Bluetooth module, a PIR
    sensor, LEDs, RGB LEDs, LDR sensors, and push buttons. Fig. 17. Smart lighting
    management by remote (voice/Internet/ Bluetooth) or by push button switches. Show
    All Fig. 18. Automatic lights. Show All This system is built to be energy-efficient,
    convenient, and safe. It gives users the freedom to choose how to control the
    lights, whether controlling the lights via pushbuttons, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, 4G/5G
    networks, or via the use of artificial intelligence by enabling Google Assistant
    voice commands integrated into the Raniso App. It also suggests to the user the
    best way to control the lights in real time. Also, we can generate any color with
    an RGB LED by adjusting the brightness of the individual red, green, and blue
    LEDs through the interface of smart lighting in the Raniso App, as shown in Fig.
    19. Besides, in places such as garages, stairs, and bathrooms, where there is
    no need for continuous light, we have implemented automatic lights, where lights
    are automatically turned on when a human is present and when it is dark. In addition,
    the user can monitor in real-time LDR sensor data, motion detection, and light
    intensity via our channel in ThingSpeak, as shown in Fig. 20. This service was
    proposed to save the max of energy and provide a level of comfort and convenience.
    The following figure represents the proposed smart lighting management by remote
    (voice/Internet/Bluetooth) or push button switches. Fig. 19. Smart lighting interface

    Show All G. Smart Medicine Reminder Medicines help us live longer and healthier.
    However, taking it the wrong way, mixing certain medications, or forgetting to
    take it at the right time can be dangerous. The proposed IoT/M2M smart medicine
    reminder solves such problems by reminding and alerting patients to take the proper
    dose at the right moment (see Fig. 21). Fig. 21. Smart medicine reminder. Show
    All This system includes a GSM module, a DS3231 real-time clock module, an LCD
    screen, push buttons, a speaker, and LEDs. A speaker and LEDs are used to alert
    and remind that it is time to take medicine. The LCD screen is set to cycle in
    three screens. The first screen shows the message “Please take care of your health.”
    The second screen is a help screen that tells to press the select push button
    to select any one-time slot to remind (once/twice/thrice in a day). The time slot
    is changeable in the program and can be configured accordingly. Four push buttons
    are used, and each has a distinct select feature. The first push button is used
    for reminding to take the medication once a day, the second is used to recall
    twice a day, and the third to recall three times a day. Stopping the notifications
    is done with the fourth push button when the user has taken his/her medication.
    If the patient is half an hour late in taking their medicine, the GSM module sends
    calls and short messages to alert them to hurry up to take their medication. In
    addition, the user can use the Raniso app’s smart medication reminder interface
    illustrated in Fig. 22, which will help them take their medicine on time, according
    to their treatment plan, and allow them to remotely manage and control medications/pill
    schedules and usage data. It also allows direct communication anytime anywhere
    between patients and caregivers, as it quickly alerts the caregiver if the patient
    needs help. The proposed IoT/M2M smart medication reminder system is extremely
    versatile and can be used by patients at home, doctors in hospitals, and many
    other places. Fig. 22. Smart medicine reminder interface on the Raniso. Show All
    H. Indoor Air Quality Monitoring System Indoor air pollution has become a real-life
    problem and a common phenomenon in buildings. With the spread of COVID-19, people
    spend most of their time indoors, and poor IAQ is a significant public health
    risk, which can increase short-term health problems, such as fatigue and nausea,
    as well as chronic respiratory disease, heart disease, and lung cancer. It is
    now necessary to monitor air quality in real time in most buildings. The air quality
    monitoring system developed in this work is based on the MQ135 sensor, DHT11,
    a servo motor, a dc fan, an air purifier, a speaker, a buzzer, an LCD screen,
    and LEDs (see Fig. 23). Fig. 23. IAQ monitoring system. Show All IAQ is measured
    in parts per million (PPM) units, where a lower PPM value indicates good air quality
    and a higher value indicates polluted air containing toxic gases. When the value
    is less than 130 PPM, then the LCD and the Raniso App will display “Air Quality
    Level Good.” The fan will turn on when the value is between 130 and 250 PPM. The
    LCD and the Raniso App will display “Air Quality Level Medium.” Whenever the value
    increases to 250 PPM, the buzzer will start beeping, the red LED will light up,
    the fan and the air purifier will turn on, and the LCD and the Raniso App will
    display “Air Quality Level Danger.” This service is connected to the Internet,
    and as a result, anyone can remotely visualize the air quality index from anywhere
    via the interface of air quality monitoring in the Raniso App (see Fig. 24). This
    system aims to perform real-time monitoring of IAQ parameters via our channel
    in the ThingSpeak platform (see Fig. 25) and generate alerts via Raniso App to
    the building occupants to avoid hazardous conditions. Fig. 24. IAQ monitoring
    interface on the Raniso. Show All Fig. 25. IAQ monitoring graph on ThingSpeak
    and the serial plotter tool. Show All SECTION V. Results and Discussion This Section
    presents the findings from the prototype’s functional testing of the proposed
    IoT/M2M smart building system, which consists of several innovative services and
    functionalities, such as smart parking, garden irrigation automation, intrusion
    alarm, smart door, fire and gas detection, smart lighting, smart medication reminder,
    and IAQ monitoring. We tried these services individually in Section IV, while,
    in this section, the effectiveness of the designed system is confirmed by testing
    all its services and functions on the final IoT/M2M smart building model that
    was created to elaborate the performance and functionality of the proposed approach.
    Many sensors, actuators, and shields used resulted in a low power supply and a
    limited number of ports. As a result, we added the Arduino Mega board along with
    the Arduino UNO and NodeMCU for perfect working operation and fulfilled the requirements
    of the IoT/M2M smart building. Our goal was to design and implement an IoT/M2M
    smart building based on the convergence of two HetNets: WSNs operating on RFID,
    Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and MCNs, such as GSM, 4G, or 5G. All data collected from the
    suggested system are stored in the cloud database, sent to the ThingSpeak server,
    and were visualized in four channels. The channels receive data from the building
    sensors at an interval of 10 s and are visualized as line graphs on the ThingSpeak
    webpage and the Raniso App in real time. Fig. 26 shows the graphs that were obtained
    from our channels in the ThingSpeak platform. In addition to the fact that these
    graphs show the possibility of monitoring building data in real time anywhere
    via the Internet, it also shows the proposed approach’s good performance and fast
    response. For example, garden irrigation automation graphs show how quickly the
    system responds in seconds should a plant need to be watered, photosynthesized,
    or refilled a water tank, and so on. The same applies to other services, as the
    IAQ, fire, and gas detection graphs also show the system’s speed in mitigating
    fire and gas leak risks. In addition to the automatic lighting service, whose
    graphs show real-time brightness, lux, and movement values. The results that we
    have reached are very satisfactory, as we have achieved the desired goal of providing
    accurate readings for the server. Besides, the latency is very low, so the users
    can easily control and monitor the smart building remotely anytime and anywhere
    using mobile phones through Raniso App. Also, one of this study’s accomplishments
    is using artificial intelligence to control appliances by allowing Google Assistant
    voice commands. The proposed smart building is customizable according to the user’s
    preferences. For example, the user can control the lights via pushbuttons, Bluetooth,
    Wi-Fi, 4G/5G networks, a voice through Google Assistant, or automatically based
    on the PIR sensor’s feedback. Furthermore, the proposed smart door allows users
    to control it using an RFID card, a password, or remotely using the Raniso app,
    either via Bluetooth or over the Internet via Wi-Fi, 4G/5G. The same is for the
    rest of the proposed applications (smart parking, smart garden, and so on). Furthermore,
    to examine the performance metric of the proposed system’s error rate, and based
    on the data collected in Table IV, including temperature, humidity, and IAQ for
    15 days, we were able to calculate the proposed system’s error rate, which was
    less than 1%. Table IV presents the data collected, including the temperature
    observed by the proposed system ( T ps ), temperature observed from official data
    ( T od ), humidity observed by the proposed system ( H ps ), humidity data observed
    from official data ( H od ), IAQ data observed by the proposed system ( IA Q ps
    ), and IAQ data observed from official data ( IA Q od ). The data collected was
    taken over 15 days, which represents the number of observations ( N ). TABLE IV

    equations from (3) to (11), we were able to calculate the estimated error rate
    for temperature as 0.89%, humidity as 0.56%, and IAQ as 0.06%. These error rates
    are very low, indicating the good performance and efficiency of the proposed system.
    SECTION VI. Conclusion This article focuses on developing an IoT/M2M smart building
    paradigm based on the convergence of WSNs and mobile-cellular networks. The proposed
    system used open hardware (Arduino, NodeMCU, sensors, modules, and so on) and
    open-source software (IDE, Proteus, and Tand Raniso App). Based on our findings
    in this article, we prove that our proposed solution offers a novel architectural
    design for a low-cost and flexible system that can be deployed for various smart
    IoT/M2M systems, including smart grids, smart retail, smart cities, and so on.
    As an example, the architectural design was provided in more detail for the case
    of a smart building, where we suggested several main services and functionalities,
    such as smart parking, garden irrigation automation, intrusion alarm, smart door,
    fire and gas detection, smart lighting, smart medication reminder, and IAQ monitoring.
    All these services can be controlled and monitored remotely via our channels in
    the ThingSpeak platform and through our multiple-platform mobile application named
    “Raniso,” a local server that allows remote building control via RFID/Bluetooth/Wi-Fi
    connectivity and cellular networks, such as GSM, 4G, or 5G. The proposed IoT/M2M
    smart building was designed, implemented, deployed, tested, and yielded the expected
    results. This smart building system can be developed for future research purposes
    by integrating machine learning techniques to make it more robust and advanced.

  description: The agriculture sector in India has been dealing with issues in amplifying
    the yield usefulness from past many years. The poor performance of agricultural
    monitoring of crop categories is one of the reasons for slowing down process of
    agriculture in India. The yield of a crop is more often determined by the amount
    of water available. We propose IoT based soil monitoring system, with which growers
    can inspect soil moisture, temperature, and humidity data on an Android mobile
    application. It also makes the provision for the user to get informed about crops,
    that are suitable according to the season, soil quality and other parameters in
    that region. This project aims to develop a system for monitoring soil parameters
    in real-time using the ESP32 LilyGO TTGO sensor. The system's low-power mode and
    deep-sleep capabilities ensure long battery life, making it ideal for deployment
    in remote areas with limit power availability. This paper presents a cost-effective
    and dependable solution for monitoring soil parameters that could prove beneficial
    to the agriculture industry, environmental monitoring, and soil research. We have
    developed an app to enhance user experience and make the use of our product even
    more accessible. The app is designed with a user-friendly interface that provides
    seamless navigation and easy access to all features of the product. With this
    app, users can control and monitor the product's functionalities from their mobile

    sector in India has been dealing with issues in amplifying the yield usefulness
    from past many years. The poor performance of agricultural monitoring of crop
    categories is one of the reasons for slowing down process of agriculture in India.
    The yield of a crop is more often determined by the amount of water available.
    We propose IoT based soil monitoring system, with which growers can inspect soil
    moisture, temperature, and humidity data on an Android mobile application. It
    also makes the provision for the user to get informed about crops, that are suitable
    according to the season, soil quality and other parameters in that region. This
    project aims to develop a system for monitoring soil parameters in real-time using
    the ESP32 LilyGO TTGO sensor. The system''s low-power mode and deep-sleep capabilities
    ensure long battery life, making it ideal for deployment in remote areas with
    limit power availability. This paper presents a cost-effective and dependable
    solution for monitoring soil parameters that could prove beneficial to the agriculture
    industry, environmental monitoring, and soil research. We have developed an app
    to enhance user experience and make the use of our product even more accessible.
    The app is designed with a user-friendly interface that provides seamless navigation

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Belagavi, Karnataka, India SECTION I. Introduction
    Agriculture is present in country for thousands of years. Over the years it has
    developed and the use of new technologies and equipment''s has contributed to
    the growth of farming. Till 2050, world population will be growing to 10 billion,
    and this will consume more food and water. The main requirement of the farm is
    the watering system and a good soil quality to grow a better yield. The olden
    methods that is traditional methods of irrigation cause more wastage of water,
    requires labor work and even then, gives a less productive yield. According to
    the MWRRA report (Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority) in 2019-2020,
    the agriculture sector consumed about 69.15% of total water available for use
    in Maharashtra. It observed that Punjab state is the highest water consuming state
    in Maharashtra that is of 96%. The main reason behind this is impolite use of
    water system and superficial knowledge about quality of soil. Poor quality soil
    tends to be compacted making it difficult for plants to grow and absorb nutrients.
    Such type of soil is then needed to be provided with lot of fertilizers for plant
    growth. Furthermore, farmers lack comprehensive understanding of how the land
    should be maintained and the percent of improvement in the fertilization of soil.
    This smart irrigation system is an IOT based agricultural system, with different
    sensors giving multiple accurate data regarding fertility of soil to progress
    the yield from crops/plants. The designed sensor gives the moisture level of soil
    and it is then displayed on the designed app. This is a low-cost automatic irrigation
    system which is wholly wireless. A quite low cost ESP32 with capacitive soil moisture
    sensor-controlled agriculture system is presented here which is affordable for
    farmers in developing the nation. This system results in save of water with a
    good yield from field as well as helps in reducing man power and saves the labour
    time invested in field. In this research, we developed an IoT-based soil sensor
    using automated sensors. Our study aims to enhance crop yield, improve efficiency,
    and minimize the use of natural resources for optimal output. Additionally, we
    designed a user-friendly UI. SECTION II. Iliterature Survey To enhance irrigation
    decision-making. The system continuously sends field condition updates and alerts
    to the owner''s mobile phone, facilitating a better understanding of the field
    environment. [1] The focused on developing the robotics application with the use
    of sensors and wireless control using embedded technology. [2] [3] Robots employed
    in agriculture have the potential to minimize manpower requirements and can be
    remotely operated from a distant location. It alerts regarding the improvement
    the effectiveness of soil protection, humidity, temperature, degradation in soil
    quality and illumination and many more. [3] Agrarian area of India which is suffering
    through water issue and tried to use the IOT technology by using AGROBOT to provide
    irrigation to crops. [4] Agricultural robot for soil monitoring to monitors water
    supply with computer vision web services and mobile services [4]. The development
    of an irrigation system using Arduino Mega 2560 and ultrasonic sensors. [5] [6]
    A robot which can plough the field, sow the seeds and cover them with the soil
    and also the irrigation purposes for all the operations at single time. [7] In
    this paper the researchers have studied and proposed a less consuming power and
    scalable IOT architecture for measuring soil moisture, humidity, temperature data
    via BLE which is connected to a UI platform (cloud). [8]– [10] This paper presents
    the development of a smart gate featuring water level and flow measuring sensors
    for precision irrigation in open channels. [11] The proposed control system is
    a low-cost automated solar irrigation pumping system. [12]. This paper particularly
    gives the study of red chillies which was observed by using the HIGROW sensor.
    [13] The results of the experiment demonstrated the effectiveness of soil moisture
    sensorcontrolled irrigation in achieving water savings. [14] In this paper proposed
    system consists of many design components used to build the system, those are
    soil moisture, Rain Sensor, Relay Board. This makes the system more complicated
    as it involves connections. [15], [16] SECTION III. Methodology From many years,
    farmers are been determining the quality of soil whole by themselves. The properties
    determined by farmers are inaccurate. Earlier the irrigation system made using
    – A. ESP 8266 with Soil Moisture Sensor Drawbacks due to Resistive soil moisture
    sensor are accuracy and durability of the resistive sensor and issues in inserting
    the probes in soil- Hence, we come up with some solutions to above problems is
    to use capacitive soil moisture sensors with ESP8266. Capacitive measuring has
    some advantages; it not only avoids corrosion of the probe but also gives a better
    reading of the moisture content of the soil as op-posed to using a resistive soil
    moisture sensor. The proposed block diagram is shown in Fig (1) Fig. 1. Block
    diagram of system using ESP8266. Show All As solution to above problems, is an
    idea that uses ESP32 interfaced capacitive soil moisture sensor. This ESP32 board
    already consists of temperature and humidity sensors embedded in it. Also, there
    is an easy provision for battery connection on it. Thus, there is no need for
    any external wired connections. B. ESP32 and HIGROW sensor module To get appropriate
    data, TTGO HIGROW LILYGO SENSOR is best system to know the quality of soil. However,
    irrigation types such as Drip irrigation, Sprinkler irrigation Lateral move irrigation
    requires a big setup and costs dollars and also require a good maintenance cost
    in developing countries. The sensor has been designed is such a manner so that
    it consumes less power, low cost and decrease in labour work. IOT enables remote
    monitoring and control of devices and machines which helps is interconnecting
    physical devices to cloud. The capacitive soil moisture sensor for moisture detection
    and the DHT11 for the detection of temperature and humidity. This sensor determines
    the light intensity called as LUX. Apart from sensors the sensor is having a battery
    connected. The battery used here is Lithium battery of power 1000 mAh. The block
    Diagram of proposed system using ESP32 is shown in Fig (2) Fig. 2. Block diagram
    of proposed system using ESP32. Show All TTGO HIGROW LILYGO SENSOR : Fig. 3. TTGO
    higrow lilygo sensor. Show All SECTION IV. Implementation With this system, we
    tried to contribute to the development of low-cost and easy-to-use soil moisture
    sensors that can help farmers and growers optimize water use and improve crop
    yield. The TTGO Higrow LilyGO sensor Fig (3) reduced the physical connections
    of components. A wireless system makes this device more versatile. This is because
    it can be easily placed and used anywhere without the limitations of wires or
    cable- connections. Also, it''s integration with other wireless devices and systems
    is easier, thus it enables remote monitoring and controlling easy. Ultimately,
    this wireless device has greater functionality and convenience, and provided more
    flexibility in its usage. A. Reading the Sensor and Getting Data Capacitive soil
    moisture sensor. A capacitive soil moisture sensor operates by detecting changes
    in soil capacitance caused by variations in its dielectric properties. Rather
    than directly measuring the moisture content, it focuses on analyzing the ions
    dissolved in the soil moisture. This approach is preferred because water itself
    is not a good conductor of electricity. Capacitive sensors offer advantages such
    as corrosion resistance and improved accuracy. The sensor incorporates a built-in
    voltage regulator that supports both 3.3V and 5V boards. However, to achieve maximum
    resolution of the Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC), it is recommended to power
    the sensor with 3.3V. The capacitance of the sensor is measured using a 555 circuit,
    which generates a voltage proportional to the capacitance. The values can be seen
    on Serial monitor of Arduino IDE. DHT11 sensor. The DHT11 sensor features a capacitive
    humidity sensing element comprising of two electrodes with a dielectric material
    in between. Additionally, it incorporates a thermistor to measure temperature.
    The thermistor used in the sensor has a negative temperature coefficient, meaning
    its resistance decreases as the temperature increases. The temperature range of
    the DHT11 sensor is between 0 to 50 degrees Celsius, providing an accuracy of
    2 degrees. In terms of humidity, the sensor has a range of 20% to 80% with an
    accuracy of approximately 5%. These readings can be observed on the serial monitor
    of the Arduino IDE. BH1750. BH1750 or lux meter in this system is essential in
    order to read the levels of luminous flux per unit area. The reason we need to
    monitor these levels is that Lux Meters we can decide a suitable region for the
    crop. Sometimes, a position might seem bright enough to the human eye, but it
    may not be sufficient for the plant or crop. In such cases, the lux values are
    helpful in deciding a more appropriate place for the crop. Here, the user can
    easily monitor these values using our Soil scope App. B. Deep Sleep Mode and Idle
    Mode The primary aim of our system is to monitor the soil parameters for crops
    so that the user can take necessary actions accordingly. The parameters like temperature,
    humidity, salt levels don''t change every minute in a day. Also, once the land
    is watered sufficiently, we do not need to measure the moisture levels for every
    minute. That is, the data of these parameters for every minute or two, is not
    required. This is power consuming as well. As a solution to this, we here activate
    the deep sleep mode in the sensor to reduce the power consumptions. Deep sleep
    mode deactivates the CPU, most peripherals, and the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth radios.
    Only the Real-Time Clock (RTC) and a small portion of the Ultra-Low Power (ULP)
    co-processor are active. The RTC wakes up the device at predetermined intervals,
    while the ULP co-processor handles low-level tasks such as monitoring sensors
    or reading external signals. With a current consumption as low as 10μA, deep sleep
    mode is ideal for battery-powered applications that require extended periods of
    sleep between wake-ups. The ESP32 must execute a specific command to enter deep
    sleep mode, which saves the current system state and turns off most peripherals.
    ESP32 Wake-up Source Timer. The ESP32 RTC controller offers a built-in timer feature
    that allows you to wake up the ESP32 at a specified time interval. This functionality
    is beneficial for projects that require timestamping or executing daily tasks
    while conserving power. To configure the timer as a wakeup source, utilize the
    esp_sleep_enable_timer_wakeup(time_in_μs) function. By providing the desired wakeup
    time in microseconds (μs) as an argument, you can enable the timer and set it
    to wake up the ESP32 accordingly. In our project, we have set the sleep mode in
    a way that it provides the data for every 4 hours in a day. When observed, getting
    the data in these time intervals is found sufficient. So, the wakeup time is set
    as 4 * 60 * 60 * 1000000. C. Sending the Data on ThingSpeak The data obtained
    from the various sensors can be sent on ThingSpeak using the Write API Key. All
    the parameters are visualized using MATLAB (Fig.4), thus making data aggregation
    and analysis easier. The data obtained on this platform, is then directly read
    on our App using the Read API Key. Fig. 4. Graphs obtained on ThingSpeak. Show
    All D. Connecting with the App SoilScope App is developed using Android Studio.
    In this application, there are provisions to monitor all the soil parameters that
    are mentioned earlier in this paper. The realtime values obtained on ThingSpeak
    are directly fetched here using its Read API Key. Also, with this app, the user
    can operate water pump when the soil moisture levels are low, with just one click.
    The pump will get turned off automatically when the water levels reach required
    values. Fig. 5. Insights of the App. Show All SECTION V. Result and Discussion
    The following observations were made when this system was deployed in the field.
    Table I According to Table 1 observations, following approximate values of battery
    consumption are calculated. When a sleep mode of around 4 hours is activated in
    the sensor % Consumption of battery / day = 0.55% ≈1% Consumption in mAh ≈ 5.55
    mAh Number of days required by battery for whole consumption– Total power of battery
    − 1000mAh Total number of days − 1000/5.55 ≈180 days[maximum] From this we can
    infer that with the help of sleep mode the battery will last for maximum 6 months
    giving the values of required parameters. These parameters are not needed to be
    observed frequently in a day. Getting the values 4-5 times in a day after every
    4-5 hours is sufficient. So, we activated the deep sleep mode of 4 hours in order
    to avoid unnecessary usage of battery and thus make it last longer. Here we can
    see that with the moisture levels, the water levels of plant are maintained throughout
    the day, which will help the user get better yields as compared to the traditional
    methods. The primary objective of the project, which is to provide realtime data
    about soil parameters such as moisture, temperature, humidity and salt advice,
    has been achieved using sensors to collect data, which is then transmitted via
    Wi-Fi to a mobile app for easy monitoring. The sensor consumes much less power
    and due to sleep mode, the battery consumption drastically decreases which makes
    the system more efficient and durable. SECTION VI. Conclusion The paper has demonstrated
    how technology can enhance agricultural practices by providing farmers with accurate
    and real-time data about their soil conditions. In the future, AI algorithms can
    be incorporated to provide intelligent recommendations based on the data collected.
    Overall, the paper has shown how technology can be used to improve the agricultural
    sector, leading to a more efficient and sustainable industry. This system is very
    user friendly and can used by farmers and common people as well. It is cheap and
    has a multiple use which would help in growing the agriculture sector to great
    heights. SECTION VII. Future Scope The agricultural industry has witnessed significant
    advancements due to the development of technology. There has been a surge in the
    use of digital tools and technology in agriculture to improve crop yields, reduce
    waste, and increase efficiency. Precision agriculture is a significant area of
    development that utilizes technology such as sensors, GPS, and drones to obtain
    precise data about soil, weather conditions, and crop health. Farmers can use
    this data to optimize planting patterns, adjust fertilization and irrigation schedules,
    and detect early signs of pest infestation or disease. In addition, the integration
    of AI and ML can provide farmers with intelligent recommendations and insights
    on crop management, disease prevention, and soil health. By analyzing data from
    sensors and other sources, AI and ML can provide farmers with more precise and
    efficient control over their farming operations. A. Incorporating AI Algorithms
    into the Project: This could be a significant development for the future. By analyzing
    data from the soil parameter sensors, the AI algorithms can provide intelligent
    recommendations and insights on the most suitable crops to cultivate in a given
    area. Historical data can also be analyzed to identify patterns and trends in
    soil parameters and crop yields, providing farmers with data-driven decision-making
    capabilities This can provide farmers with access to weather forecasting services,
    allowing them to receive more accurate and comprehensive data. The API can be
    designed to fetch weather data from various sources and merge it with the soil
    parameter data collected by the project. This combined data can provide farmers
    with a comprehensive view of the environmental conditions affecting their crops,
    enabling them to make more informed decisions. The API can also be used to create
    custom weather alert systems that can notify farmers of upcoming weather events
    such as heavy rainfall or extreme temperatures, which could impact crop growth.
    By receiving early warning notifications, farmers can take preventive measures
    to protect their crops and reduce damage. Authors Figures References Keywords

    Location: GHAZIABAD, India SECTION I. Introduction The necessity of preserving
    and managing water habitats has been highlighted in recent years by the problem
    of worldwide water pollution. To ensure the survival of cultured species, the
    traditional aquaculture sector needs a lot of human effort to monitor and maintain
    the water quality in fish ponds. The automated water quality monitoring systems
    currently being used in larger fish farms, however, have drawbacks such a constrained
    communication range between sensors and a lack of essential equipment for low-power,
    remote water quality monitoring [1] [2]. A LoRa and NB-IoT-based water quality
    monitoring system has been presented as a solution to these problems. This method
    intends to address the shortcomings of the mechanism in place for keeping track
    of freshwater ecological ranching, including its short transmission distance and
    limited coverage [3]. Moreover, it has been recommended to use LoRa and IoT technology
    to monitor a lake''s water environment [4], which aims to lower labor costs, decrease
    detection times, and enhance information accessibility. It is now possible to
    implement environment monitoring across large areas at low energy and low cost
    because to the development of Long Range (LoRa) network technology This is crucial
    for water quality monitoring systems intended to preserve and maintain drinking
    water supplies, stop pollution, and stop disease outbreaks, especially during
    the COVID-19 pandemic [5]. Overall, IoT can be widely used for remote monitoring
    of water quality indicators. LoRa, a relatively new addition to the Internet of
    Things, has extremely low power consumption and the capacity to cover enormous
    areas with its wireless network [6]. SECTION II. Review of Literature Aquaculture
    has seen a rise in the use of intelligent monitoring systems for environmental
    sensing in recent years. A LoRaWAn-based water quality monitoring system has been
    created to keep track of the water quality in aquaculture ponds [7]. The idea
    of IoT has facilitated the development of IoT-based systems, which are composed
    of interconnected networks of sensors that are intelligent and programmable [8].
    Users can utilize the Cayenne LPP cloud to determine the position of the device
    with the aid of IoT-based water quality monitoring devices that use geolocation
    and LoRaWAN with solar power [9]. Such systems use pH and temperature sensors
    to monitor water pollution, and wireless LoRa communication is used to relay the
    data to a host PC. The device has a PV panel and lithium-ion battery storage,
    and the data received is stored in the cloud with a GUI [10]. While on-site measurements
    are still used in traditional methods of gathering data on water quality, using
    LPWAN-LoRaWAN technology for data transfer can increase the system''s lifespan.
    To accomplish this, a solar panel has been modified to recharge the battery [11]
    [12]. Low-cost and low-power water pollution monitoring systems using microcontrollers
    and long-range wireless systems like LoRa have been proposed [13] [14] in order
    to overcome the drawbacks of conventional water quality monitoring systems, such
    as cable laying, inconvenient maintenance, and lack of intelligent management
    and control behavior. Last but not least, a sensor development and LoRa Network-based
    water and air monitoring system has been suggested. The system uses a custom PCB
    board to combine LoRa, Renesas RX64M MCU, and terminal sensors. Sixteen monitoring
    point stations were utilized to measure water and air parameters, including pH,
    temperature, humidity, CO2, DO concentration, and PM2.5 [15]. SECTION III. Block
    Diagram The LoRa-based Water Monitoring Mote is intended to gather information
    on water quality indicators like pH, TDS, and temperature, as shown in figure
    1. The main controller of the mote, an Lora32 IC board, is in charge of gathering
    data from the sensors and transmitting it to the gateway mote. Long-distance communication
    between the Water Monitoring Mote and the gateway mote is made possible by the
    LoRa RF module. The PH sensor and TDS sensor produce an analog output by measuring
    the pH and total dissolved solids in the water. The water temperature is measured
    via the waterproof DS18B20 temperature sensor. The mote receives power from a
    power supply module, which also guarantees reliable performance. Fig. 1. Block

    of the Lora Receiver Node Show All The LoRa Gateway Mote, which can be seen in
    Figure 2, acts as the gateway for the Water Monitoring Mote. It is in charge of
    gathering data from the Water Monitoring Mote and transmitting it to a cloud-based
    server. The main controller of the gateway mote, an Lora32 IC board, is in charge
    of gathering data from the Water Monitoring Mote and transmitting it to the cloud-based
    server. Long-distance communication between the Water Monitoring Mote and the
    gateway mote is made possible by the LoRa RF module. A cloud-based server can
    be accessed by the gateway mote over Wi-Fi thanks to the Nuttyfi ESP8266 Wi-Fi
    module. The mote receives power from a power supply module, which also guarantees
    reliable performance. The gateway mote uses the Nuttyfi ESP8266 Wi-Fi module to
    relay data to the cloud-based server after receiving it from the Water Monitoring
    Mote through the LoRa RF module. Users can access the data stored on the cloud-based
    server for monitoring and analysis. SECTION IV. Hardware Development The following
    are the hardware connections for the LoRa-based Water Monitoring Mote (Fig. 3):
    The 5V and GND pins of the +5V DC power supply is connected to the Vcc and GND
    pins of the PH sensor, respectively. Additionally, the Lora32 microcontroller''s
    A0 pin is connected to the PH out data pin. The 5V and GND pins of the power supply
    are linked to the Vcc and GND pins of the TDS sensor. Additionally, the Lora32
    microcontroller''s Al pin is connected to the output data pin. The 5V and GND
    pins of the power supply are linked to the Vcc and GND pins of the DS18B20 waterproof
    temperature sensor, respectively. The temperature sensor''s data pin is attached
    to the Lora32 microcontroller''s A4 pin. A 10Kohm resistor additionally connected
    between the Vcc and Data pins of the DS18B20 waterproof temperature sensor. The
    Lora32 microcontroller''s Software SPI pins are linked to the Lora RF module''s
    pins. The Voltage and Ground pins on the Lora RF are linked to the appropriate
    Vcc and GND pins. The RST pin, NSS, MOSI, MISO, SCK, RST, and DIO0 pins of the
    Lora RF board are connected to the Lora32 microcontroller''s 4, 5, 6, 11, 12,
    and 13 no pins. The Lora Gateway Mote''s hardware connections are as follows (Fig.
    4): The Lora RF board''s RST pin, NSS, MOSI, MISO, SCK, RST, and DIO0 pins are
    connected to the Lora32 microcontroller''s 4, 5, 6, 11, 12, and 13 no pins using
    the software SPI approach. The power supply''s Vcc and GND are linked to the Lora
    RF module''s Vcc and GND pins. The 5V and GND pins of the power supply are linked
    to the Vcc and GND pins of the NuttyFi ESP8266 wifi Module. The Lora32 Microcontroller''s
    23 and 24 no pins have been connected to the Rx and Tx pins of the NuttyFi ESP8266

    of the System A. For the Lora-Based Water Monitoring Mote The initialization of
    the sensors is the first step of the LoRa-based Water Monitoring Mote algorithm
    before data collection (fig 5). The mote starts gathering data from the pH sensor,
    TDS sensor, and DS18B20 waterproof temperature sensor once the sensors have been
    initialized. After processing, the sensor data is ready to be transmitted to the
    gateway mote. Using the LoRa RF module, the mote sends the data to the gateway
    mote and waits for an acknowledgement to make sure the transmission was successful.
    The mote enters a low-power sleep mode following a successful transmission in
    order to save energy until the following interval of data collecting. In order
    to provide a continuous monitoring solution for water quality metrics, the process
    is repeated at regular intervals. The water quality parameters are continuously
    monitored by this algorithm, and data is sent to the gateway router for storage
    and analysis. Fig. 5. LoRa-based Water Monitoring Mote Show All B. For the β Lora
    Gateway Mote As seen in figure 6, Initializing the LoRa and Wi-Fi modules to get
    them ready for data transmission is the first step in the LoRa Gateway Mote methodology.
    The mote starts to receive data from the water monitoring mote via the LoRa RF
    module once the modules have been initialized. After that, the data is processed
    and made ready for transmission to the server in the cloud. Using the Nuttyfi
    ESP8266 Wi-Fi module, the mote sends the processed data to the cloud-based server
    while waiting for acknowledgement to assure successful transfer. The mote enters
    a low-power sleep mode following a successful transmission in order to save energy
    until the following data transmission interval. In order to provide a continuous
    monitoring solution for water quality metrics, the process is repeated at regular
    intervals. This method makes sure that the cloud-based server receives and continuously
    transmits data from the Water Monitoring Mote for archival and analysis. Fig.

    quality monitoring system developed and used in this project offers a dependable
    and affordable option for real-time monitoring of water quality indicators. The
    system is made up of the Water Monitoring Mote and the Gateway Mote, two distinct
    nodes that collaborate to continually gather, process, and transfer data to a
    cloud-based server for archival and analysis. Long-range communication and low
    power consumption are made possible by the use of LoRa technology, which makes
    it perfect for remote and difficult-to-reach areas. The system has sensors that
    can monitor pH, TDS, and temperature, three factors that are very important in
    assessing the quality of the water. Aquaculture, drinking water management, environmental
    monitoring, and other uses are all possible for the system…. Overall, by ensuring
    secure and wholesome water supplies, the installation of this LoRa-based water
    quality monitoring system can benefit society. Authors Figures References Keywords

    Some of the world''s most important wine-grape-growing regions are struggling

    India SECTION I. Introduction In order to maximize crop yields, Precision Agriculture
    (PA) combines tried-and-true agricultural methods with cutting-edge machinery
    and software. When used to disease surveillance and management, PA has become
    an invaluable tool in modem agricultural productivity. Diseases may have a devastating
    impact on a farmer''s bottom line by reducing agricultural yields by destroying
    or severely damaging their crops. Although most farmers hope for the best and
    take preventative measures, illnesses nevertheless occasionally spread despite
    their best efforts. In order to reduce the possibility of disease outbreaks, experts
    need in-depth information on things like the type of plant present, the soil,
    and the weather (the latter of which is the most unpredictable). The onset of
    illness is unpredictable since it is tied to the right combination of factors
    [1]. Water or wind may readily spread diseases from one plant to another. Consequently,
    when a disease has been discovered, precautions must be taken to stop an epidemic
    from occurring, which would have devastating effects on the crop that year and
    the years to come. The most recent developments in technology and communications,
    particularly in the area of Internet of Things (IoT), have sparked a revolution
    in the viticulture industry. Pesticide and herbicide residues, heavy metals, pathogenic
    organisms, and other hazardous chemicals can all cause food poisoning, thus it''s
    important that farming methods be monitored to ensure food safety and health.
    Waste treatment facilities for sewage, organic solid wastes, and other types of
    waste are another issue that the agricultural sector must address [2]. Rapid urbanization
    is making formerly abundant supplies of nonrenewable power and water increasingly
    difficult to come by, making efficient management of these scarce resources all
    the more important. Perhaps the best tools for helping farmers keep tabs on the
    microclimate of their vineyards and the pests and diseases that threaten their
    crops is precision viticulture. The viticulture surveillance apparatus is depicted
    in Figure 1. Figure 1. Monitoring System for Viticulture Show All In agriculture,
    vineyards are particularly vulnerable to damage, although careful observation
    can help prevent losses. A farmer''s job in a vineyard is made more difficult
    by the presence of pests like as birds, insects, and different creatures that
    might damage the plants there. When scouting a vineyard, it is important to evaluate
    all areas in an effort to reduce the amount of damage that happens. Once a week
    is recommended for scouting, with extra care paid to high-risk regions for diseases
    and pests. However, scouting is widely regarded as a labor-intensive manual technique
    that necessitates a keen eye for detail in order to effectively locate trouble
    areas in the field [3]. Additionally, it takes a considerable amount of time to
    fully inspect a huge area. It is easy for the untrained eye to miss infections
    since they favor cold, shaded places like the underside of leaves. One possible
    method involves the use of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) to supervise specialists
    who scour fields for trouble spots that need extra care. Through the use of a
    WSN, sensor nodes may be strategically deployed in locations with a high likelihood
    of triggering an event of interest. Need something happen, the farmers may receive
    a message detailing the area in which they need take corrective measures. Those
    with expansive fields would benefit enormously from this kind of surveillance
    system, as local weather conditions can vary significantly over relatively short
    distances due to factors like microclimates. However, in the event of diverse
    settings like mountainous terrains, these developments might be much more beneficial.
    A WSN can be supplemented with data from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), sometimes
    referred as drones, which can give both real-time information and high-quality
    images useful for disease identification [4], [5]. Thanks to rapid technological
    advancement, UAVs are now commonly used in a variety of industries. Thanks to
    falling costs and increased accessibility, drone systems may be tailored to meet
    the needs of virtually any industry. Drones are highly adaptable gadgets that
    can improve field surveillance due to their programmability and long-distance
    operation without human intervention. Drones have a lot to offer PA thanks to
    their portability, agility, and the capacity to see and reach places that humans
    can''t. When it comes to capturing aerial footage, drones offer a distinct edge.
    Both using satellites and flying an aircraft to capture aerial imagery are costly
    and produce less than ideal results for the human eye. Farmers would profit when
    they were able to keep tabs on their farms from above if they had access to aerial
    surveillance technology. Drones are a low-effort, low-cost option that may provide
    precise results [11] [12]. SECTION II. Related Study Wireless technologies are
    finding new applications thanks to developments in the Internet of Things [6].
    One area where the IoT has the potential to boost production, effectiveness, and
    productivity is in agricultural monitoring. However, batteries are typically needed
    to power these devices since they are placed in areas without ready access to
    electricity. This study [6] compares the performance of three distinct wireless
    technologies utilized by IoT devices having solar power capabilities in order
    to carry out agricultural surveillance: IEEE 802.11 g, IEEE 802.15.4, and Long
    Range Wireless Area Network. Each technology''s efficacy in a variety of settings
    was tested in four separate tests [6]. When coniparing wireless technologies for
    use in a farm surveillance system, LoRaWAN appeared as the clear winner in terms
    of both energy efficiency and network lifetime [6]. Precision agriculture (PA)
    is a rapidly developing field that uses cutting-edge technologies to conventional
    agricultural methods in an effort to maximize efficiency and productivity [7].
    Wireless technology, and more especially IoT devices, can be a game-changer in
    the quest for precision agriculture. Devices on an inch scale and at a reasonable
    cost can be utilized to keep an eye on expansive farmland. A system for precision
    viticulture is suggested in this study [7], which makes use of Internet of Things
    sensors for continuous tracking. All of the system''s parts have been carefully
    coded, and their connections are planned with efficiency in mind. In the field,
    wireless sensor nodes collect data on soil moisture and temperature and send it
    to a central station. If the weather is just right for a pest or illness to spread,
    a drone will head in that direction. Images are taken while the drone is in flight
    above the node, and the data is sent back to the control center. Experiments are
    conducted in a practical setting to test the system''s viability [7]. This study
    [8] explains why implementing IoT devices and technology into a building''s infrastructure
    is crucial for effective energy management. Our goal is to predict electrical
    power consumption in an IoT-enabled building, thus we design an Elman recurrent
    neural network (RNN) framework as well as an exponential model. Lab for Real-Time
    Power and Intelligent Systems (RTPIS) [8] with IoT gadgets for smart monitoring
    and management. A comparison is made between the constructed Elman RNN and exponential
    systems. Electricity can be provided to meet the demands of electric loads at
    the exact moment it is required, thanks to these predicting abilities, which reduces
    electric energy waste, carbon emissions, and costs [8]. Air pollution has risen
    across Latin America and the Caribbean as a result of the region''s increasing
    reliance on electricity produced primarily from fossil fuels [9]. The production
    and use of electricity in homes are major factors in this issue. However, new
    studies show that in industrialized nations, using smart energy meters decreases
    electricity use because of the continual feedback given to the customer. This
    study [9] details the design and deployment of a system to monitor residential
    electrical energy use using smart sensors and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies.
    The system computes not only the immediate power but also the electrical efficiency,
    the amount of energy used, and the associated cost. ThingSpeak acts as a cloud
    database, processing and transmitting data from these variables using a WIFI ESP8266
    module. To further aid users in seeing the behavior of the variables, an Android
    mobile application was built to interface directly with the database. The smart
    sensor''s readings were compared to those obtained from an oscilloscope and a
    multimeter to verify their reliability. Errors in comparison ranged from -2.34
    to 1.92% [9]. Since the introduction of wireless technology, the notion of the
    Internet of Things has received considerable attention [10]. IoT knowledge diffusion
    occurs when an individual shares his IoT knowledge with the people to whom he
    has direct connections, and IoT knowledge creation occurs when individuals get
    new IoT information and incorporate it into their current body of knowledge. Multiple
    reviews of earlier research on the Internet of Things may be found in the current
    literature [10]. Nevertheless to the increasing pace of IoT study, the Main-Path-Analysis
    (MPA) method should be used to examine the channels via which information about
    IoT is disseminated. Revisiting the growth of knowledge and prospective future
    study fields, as well as updating prior IoT studies, is crucial. This article
    [10] use the term co-occurrence structure and MPA to chart the hubs of the IoT
    research community and examine the development of the subject from 1970 to 2020
    based on information gleaned from the Web of Science. The findings reveal that
    researchers are primarily interested in developing IoT solutions for usage in
    areas. The results of the MPA provide answers to questions on the development
    of knowledge in the IoT field. They are a great tool for disseminating knowledge
    about the history, present, and potential future of IoT research and implementation
    among academics and professionals [10]. SECTION III. Methodology Figure 2 provides
    an overall picture of the planned setup. Following data fusion as well as processing,
    a report is given to the system administrator containing data from both ground-based
    sensors and UAV imagery. Figure 2. System Overview. Show All The suggested system
    is centered on comparing data collected by sensor nodes with photos captured by
    a UAV to identify if any changes have happened in the region. An unmanned aerial
    vehicle (UAV) might be sent to the location if the data from the sensors are reported
    to be over a certain threshold. Furthermore, they are two main varieties of nodes
    to choose from. The first category consists of “monitoring nodes,” which are constantly
    on the lookout for new sensor data to gather, package it up, and send off to the
    relay nodes. Relay nodes are the second sort of node in a network, and while they
    can''t sense anything, they can nevertheless transfer data packets to the command
    center. If there is a significant weather occurrence, the drone might not be allowed
    to fly as well as the system might not work as intended. System Framework Figure
    3 depicts the overall architecture of the suggested system. There are three primary
    parts to the system: Figure 3. Structure of the Suggested System Show All To begin,
    we have the wireless surveillance nodes. Low-power processing units, wired soil
    as well as humidity sensors, and a radio transmitter are all included in the wireless
    stations for surveillance. There are four moisture sensors and four temperature
    sensors per node. A rechargeable battery provides energy for the nodes. A solar
    panel is used to replenish the battery''s power supply. The information that comes
    from the sensors is sent to the CPU for preliminary filtering and packetization.
    The information packets are transmitted to the wireless communication unit that
    relays those by means of wireless transmission to the nodes in the network. The
    wireless network is a critical part of the system since it transmits data from
    sensors at monitoring nodes to a central location for analysis. The network is
    made up of nodes that act as relays. The relay nodes are identical to the surveillance
    nodes in every way except that they only include the minimal communication unit
    required to convey the data. Nevertheless, there are no sensors at the relay nodes.
    Every relay node may both receive data packets and send them on to the command
    center. The third part is the command center, which includes a computer and an
    unmanned aerial vehicle. All information is compiled and analyzed in the control
    room. The control center will alert the UAV if the data acquired is too large.
    Once the sensor nodes have pinpointed the areas of interest, the UAV may fly there.
    Image Acquisition All data collected by the sensors is gathered in the control
    room''s computer. In the event that one of the nodes'' readings significantly
    deviates from the norm, the control room''s computer will notify the UAV of the
    node''s precise location. The locations of the nodes are known in advance because
    to their fixed nature. After taking off, the UAV flies in the direction of the
    reporting node. As it approaches the hub, it begins photographing the leaves as
    well as area around it. The UAV shoots two photos from the same starting position,
    then turns 40 degrees horizontally and shoots again. The operation is continued
    until the drone has completed a full horizontal revolution. The unmanned aerial
    vehicle is then programmed to return to its home base in the command center. After
    landing, the UAV uploads its photo collection to a computer, which in turn notifies
    the administrator. In this part, we provide the system''s hardware components,
    together with their respective settings and some preliminary testing results.
    Soil Moisture Sensor Sensors are deployed to gather data about the natural environment.
    The sensors in the new system are chosen to monitor soil temperature as well as
    moisture levels. Evaluate the degree to which the soil surrounding a particular
    sensor is moist using the Soil Moisture Sensor Module shown in Figure 4. This
    will allow your garden''s plants to send distress signals. The sensitivity of
    this module may be adjusted by burying it in the ground and then using the onboard
    potentiometer. If the moisture level is above or below the potentiometer''s setting,
    the sensor will provide a logic HIGH or LOW signal. Figure 4. Soil Moisture Sensor
    Show All Water can pool in one area of the field after a downpour, and if the
    field is not examined often, it will be difficult to locate these puddles. Even
    though initial calibration was required, the sensor''s precision is more than
    enough for the intended use. There is a sweet spot in terms of ambient temperature
    when most illnesses are at their most prevalent. But the temperature of the soil
    can also reveal crucial information about the illnesses'' outward manifestations.
    Preventative measures can be taken well in advance if it is known that a certain
    area''s temperature is inside the danger zone for a given disease. Arduino Module
    A microcontroller was employed as the brains of the operation. The microcontroller
    takes the information from the sensors,processes it, and sends it on to the command
    center. A low power microcontroller is needed to keep the power usage at a minimum.
    Numerous inexpensive microcontrollers are available. As a result of its low cost,
    low consumption of electricity, and easy interoperability with various devices,
    an Arduino was selected as the microcontroller. Figure 5 depicts an It''s compact,
    requires little power, offers a variety of wireless connection options, and has
    enough accessible pins to attach up to eight sensors. Figure 5. Arduino UNO Show
    All Transmission Unit Choosing the appropriate wireless communication technique
    for transferring data among the nodes as well as the control center is critical.
    If you want to reduce the total amount of energy used at each node, it is essential
    that the selected innovation have a low power demand. The transmission range has
    to be greater for viticultural purposes. Whenever packets need to be transported
    from a great distance, it is crucial that the transmission range be as broad as
    possible to minimize the amount of hops and relay nodes between the nodes and
    the control room. Also, the suggested application would require only a small amount
    of information. The power needs of every possible wireless method were analyzed
    to determine their suitability for the network under consideration. There were
    three Arduino boards utilized, one for each technique, with a moisture sensor
    and a temperature sensor linked to each board. Before any sort of filtering or
    processing, the nodes broadcast sensor data once per second for around 5 minutes.
    The energy consumption of each prototype was tracked with the use of the Monsoon
    power meter. The Monsoon power monitor provides precise measurements and makes
    it simple to keep track of data for later use in calculating an average value.
    Uav The UAV relies on information gathered by the field nodes to perform its duties,
    making it a crucial part of the system. The UAV is dispatched to a certain place
    to take images if the control room computer has determined that it is very likely
    that sickness would appear there. After the UAV returns, the pictures are relayed
    to the network manager, who makes the call based on what they saw. If the present
    photos are of poor quality or there is a shortage of information from the sensors,
    the network controller can re-fly the drone above the node to take more pictures.
    The drone has a Global Positioning System as well. As a result, less time may
    be spent in the air before running out of juice. In order to make the most of
    the given flight time, various setups were tested. The drone may be programmed
    to automatically transmit live footage from its camera to the controlling device
    while also tracking where it is through GPS. Nevertheless, with this setup, the
    duration spent in the air is reduced to 12 minutes. The flight duration is shortened
    to 20 minutes if you forego the Wi-Fi connection and instead record directly into
    the SD card. A third setup was conceptualized. The camera as well as Wi-Fi connection
    on the drone are disabled the moment it leaves the control room. When the drone
    is over the reporting node, only then will the camera begin recording. SECTION
    IV. Results and Discussions Several trials were carried out in a vineyard to assess
    the efficiency of the method. To allow for variable solar panel output at each
    node. There were a total of 10 wireless surveillance nodes and 4 relay nodes utilized.
    Three soil moisture sensors and three soil temperature sensors were installed
    in every wireless monitoring node. About 1 kilometer separated the relay nodes.
    Energy Consumption The investigation looked at how long the nodes used for surveillance
    lasted. The nodes will continue to broadcast until their batteries die. You can
    see the outcomes in Figure 6. Although the nodes in a real world scenario wouldn''t
    be expected to constantly send data, this experiment tested the system''s maximum
    throughput. Research findings show that throughout both time periods, wireless
    nodes are able to maintain transmission for more than 160 hours. Figure 6. Energy
    at Each Tracking Hub. Show All Location Accuracy Here, we test the drone''s ability
    to precisely pinpoint a network node. Each of the ten wireless surveillance nodes
    underwent a series of tests. There was a maximum discrepancy of 1.3 m. This blunder
    occurred because the drone reacted differently in a variety of weather situations.
    The experimental data shows that environmental variables like wind or leftover
    power from the drone can degrade GPS precision, flying steadiness, and ultimately
    the quality of the resulting photographs. Better drones may be purchased to reduce
    the severity of these issues. But that might result in a substantial rise in the
    system price. You can see the outcomes in Table 1. When both sensors were attached
    to their respective boards, the power utilization of the boards was determined.
    The LoRa board, as predicted, has the lowest energy usage of the three. Lacking
    the sensors, we were also able to measure the boards'' energy usage. When comparing
    the power consumption of surveillance and relay nodes, it is evident that LoRa
    technology is superior. LoRa''s rather slow data rate isn''t a problem for our
    setup because sensor nodes are only required to provide a handful of readings
    every surveillance hour. Table 1. Comparing the Energy Needs of Various Wireless
    Technologies When flying a distance of 1 km, we also compared the drone''s consumption
    rate across the three different setups. The drone has a top speed of 6 meters
    per second, takes 22 seconds to get launch parameters from the control center,
    and can capture pictures from the node that reported a problem in just 16 seconds.
    For example, Type-1 nodes do not provide any sort of protection for the relative
    humidity sensor. Because of this, Stevenson screens were placed 30 centimeters
    above the ground to protect these nodes against the wet ground. As a result, the
    grille keeps the nodes safe while enabling air to flow through for accurate humidity
    readings. Type-1 node temperature sensors were installed at a height of one meter.
    It was decided to bury temperature and humidity sensors for the Type-2 nodes at
    a depth of 15 centimeters. A galvanized steel building was installed adjacent
    to the wine cellar on the property to house the solar panel that supplies power
    to the entryway. Visualization of the Data Collected In order to examine the vineyard
    data, the vine farmer must first authenticate on the web program for security
    reasons. After the vine grower logs onto the main page, he or she may select the
    time period and the kind of data (ambient or soil) to display. You can see the
    information in its original tabular form, as graphical curves (daily or hourly
    averages), or as a summary that draws comparisons between the various nodes. Figure
    7 depicts the system''s primary homepage. Figure 7. Home Page of the Tracking
    Network. Show All The seasonality of environmental factors determines their impact
    on vineyards. Throughout particular, the weather is crucial throughout the spring
    and summer. As the days get longer and warmer in the spring, frost becomes a greater
    threat. For certain plants, this might mean the end of the stem and the harvest
    for the year. The vines'' leaves can be shredded by hail, and the buds can be
    damaged by its impact. Early summer rains, especially if they are strong or last
    for a long time, can cause serious problems for a vineyard. Hail and high winds,
    for example, can destroy a whole harvest by dislodging the fruit from the vines.
    Pollination can also be disrupted by the wind. SECTION V. Conclusion and Future
    Scope This research study introduced a drone-based, Internet of Things-based system
    for monitoring vineyards in real time. The proposed method utilizes a cheap Internet
    of Things network for vineyard plant surveillance. Whenever the surveillance readings
    go beyond a certain level, a drone is flown to the region to take pictures, which
    are then relayed to the system administrator. In this study, we focused on developing
    a system that could acquire and monitor information in real time at a reasonable
    cost. By simulating real-world conditions, the trials proved the system''s viability.
    Since the system was put into place, users have had remote access to the information
    gathered from the nodes as well as the weather. In conclusion, the data show that
    the system is a valuable resource for viticulturists and oenologists seeking to
    monitor and control a vineyard''s health from afar. Analytical tools for past
    data that may be used to provide light on the present are a focus of our future
    investigation. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics More Like This Research

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Vienna, Austria SECTION I. Demonstration
    Setup Vertical farming is the solution to the rising population''s agricultural
    needs. To maximize its impact, real-time monitoring and control of various farming
    parameters is required. In 2020, an IoT based system was introduced which monitors
    the soil humidity, temperature and grow light [1]. A controlling unit for vertical
    farming was devised which comprised a BeagleBone Black, Sierra sim module for
    internet connection and different sensors for reading the environmental condition
    [2]. Here, we demonstrate a smart vertical farming setup, FarmTech that can adapt
    to the changing environmental conditions, maintain optimum conditions for the
    crop requirement and uses ESP8266 as a microcontroller which directly connects
    to WiFi and reduces cost by eliminating the requirement of an additional module
    for internet connectivity. FarmTech includes the following major components: I)
    Farm structure: Two vertically arranged racks with nutrient-rich soil, LED-lit
    for providing energy for photosynthesis, cultivating mentha arvensis. II)Sensor
    network: DHT11 Temperature and Humidity sensor, pH sensor, LDR light intensity
    sensor and soil moisture sensor. ESP8266 Wi-Fi microcontroller in Arduino IDE,
    coded in C language, connects sensors to IoT platform via Wi-Fi. III) Environment
    control unit (ECU): An electric-motor driven irrigation network controlled by
    a microcontroller via relay module powering the motor for 10s when soil''s volumetric
    moisture level is indicated as LOW by the soil moisture sensor with a delay of
    15s considering the soil moisture sensor''s 12s latency. IV) IoT platform: ThingSpeak
    for analyzing, storing and visualizing live data of the farm and allows it to
    connect with the mobile applica V) Visualization: A mobile application Farm View
    built on Flutter with JAVA for remotely accessing live updates of the farm connected
    with the internet through ThingSpeak. Figure 1: FarmTech''s setup with Mentha
    Arvensis plants. Show All SECTION II. Visitor Experience A. Visitor Experience
    of Farm Tech and Farmview 1)The structural setup is easy to access and maintain
    because of its vertically stacked racks and minimalistic sensor network. 2) The
    electrical setup creates a controlled environment from sensors and automates the
    irrigation network and remotely displays the live updates of the farm on FarmView.
    3) Farmview allows the user to access live updates of temperature, humidity, soil
    moisture, light intensity and pH value of the farm. 4) FarmView receives warnings
    and suggestions when the farm''s temperature, light intensity, soil moisture level
    or pH attains a risky value. Figure 2: FarmView App and sensor data displayed

    this challenge, this study aimed to develop and implement a solar-powered Internet
    of Things (IoT) based drip irrigation system for tomato cultivation in plastic
    roof net houses. Additionally, the study evaluated the effects of water and fertilizer

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Trichy, India SECTION I. Introduction Water
    is a basic necessity for all the life forms on Earth [1], [2]. It is well known
    that water is the main reason behind Earth being the only living planet. It is
    impossible for any living being to live without water [3], [4]. Without water,
    a plant cannot perform its essential photosynthesis. It is understandable that
    if the problem of water scarcity continues to increase, it will remove the greenery
    in the future. As a result of which, there will be less rainfall. Water is also
    essential for agricultural production and food security [5]–[7]. Technology has
    always served to overcome such problems and to make lives easy with its innovations.
    Here through this study one such solution is introduced, named ‘lOT based Soil
    Management System,’ a model for controlling irrigation that uses IoTto sense soil
    moisture with temperature and humidity of the surroundings with a microcontroller
    to make an intelligent irrigation system to help millions of farmers and University
    gardeners [8], [9]. Soil moisture is critical to plant growth, and maintaining
    the right amount of moisture can help plants grow faster and produce better yields.
    An efficient soil moisture management system can help conserve water by reducing
    the water needed for irrigation [10], [11]. A soil moisture management system
    can help reduce water usage and lead to cost savings of water bills and other
    expenses. By managing soil moisture levels, it helps to maintain soil health and
    reduce erosion, which is essential for sustainable agriculture [12]–[14]. Farmers
    and growers can proactively avoid drought conditions and other weather-related
    risks that can harm crops by monitoring soil moisture levels [15]–[17]. To evaluate
    the link between soil moisture readings acquired from soil moisture sensors and
    the gravimetric approach, a study was conducted at the Water Technology Centre
    farm (WTC) at Hyderabad based college [18]. In 2021, Fengfei et al.''s Portable
    PHS Method for Moisture in the Soil Monitoring Based on Thermal Effect is implemented.
    The results were compared to those obtained using the drying procedure, confirming
    the practicality of the suggested method [19]. In 2019, G. S. Swileam et al. assessed
    soil heterogeneity utilising electrical resistance for typical alluvial soils
    in Egypt [20]. In 2018 smith et aI., proposed a system for efficiently maintaining
    optimal soil moisture levels for crops using various traditional soil management
    systems [21]. Gupta et al. (2020) analyze whether rooftop harvesting of rainwater
    and outline bunding enhances the moisture in the soil. Their effects on yields
    of crops, availability of water, and soil moisture management are examined [22].
    Contour plowing, terracing, and checking dams in arid environments are the main
    focus of this study by Patel et al. It assesses their ability to reduce soil moisture
    evaporation and increase water retention [23]. To measure the soil moisture content,
    humidity, and temperature using Raspberry Pi Pico and other sensors to minimize
    the over-watering and under-watering of plants. This paper deals with multiple
    sensors/modules and Raspberry Pi Pico to measure the current readings of the soil
    & surrounding of the University plants, analyze them, display the measurements
    on the webpage, and automatically water the plants when required by connecting
    them to a water pump. IoT-based soil management systems can collect real-time
    data on soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and other relevant factors.
    This enables farmers and growers of the university to make data-driven decisions
    and respond quickly to changes in soil moisture levels. Farmers and growers can
    remotely monitor soil moisture levels and other factors with this system. This
    can save time and reduce the need for manual labor in the field. The curated system
    can automate the irrigation process based on soil moisture levels and other data.
    Intelligent systems can help reduce water waste and improve crop yields. IoT -based
    soil management systems can be easily scaled to accommodate more significant areas
    of farmland or garden spaces in universities. These innovative systems are also
    suitable for large-scale agricultural operations and smaller-scale applications.
    SECTION II. Proposed Work This IoT -based system deals with multiple sensors/modules
    and Raspberry Pi Pico to measure the current readings of the soil & surroundings,
    analyze them, display the measurements on the website, and automatically water
    the plants when required by connecting to a water pump. The system uses micro
    python to interface the sensors and modules with the microcontroller Raspberry
    Pi Pico. This project deals with the automatic watering of plants whenever the
    moisture, humidity, and temperature level decreases to a specific standard limit.
    The working of proposed model consists of a soil moisture sensor and a temperature
    humidity sensor, which tracks the soil moisture along with the humidity and temperature
    of the surroundings. When the measurements exceed the required standard readings,
    the relay directs the motor to pump water to plants. This model will benefit people
    with large patches of gardens, Universities, or those farther from their places.
    The proposed system has advantages in reducing costs, restricting water waste,
    and minimizing physical interference. It also promotes irrigation that requires
    little maintenance and is environmentally friendly. In order to regulate the water
    flow, a relay module has been installed. The model shows expected impacts at various
    levels of humidity and temperature. Figure 1 shows the proposed model of our IoT
    -based system. Fig. 1: Proposed IoT-based system for Soil Moisture management
    system Show All SECTION III. Methedologies Used The Soil Moisture Sensor yields
    real-time data in the form of an analog. Analog to Digital (A/D) and data conditions
    are converted using Raspberry Pi Pico Microcontroller. The Microcontroller is
    used to acquire real-time soil moisture using a soil moisture sensor. The Thonny
    Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a cross-platform application that
    supports high-level programming languages like Python. The IDE makes writing code
    and uploading the source program to the board easy. It contains libraries and
    cores. The samples are measured from low to High moisture contents of the soil.
    The gardener can get the processed data through the webpage with the help of Wireless
    Fidelity (Wi-Fi) Technology. This system can give real-time data on soil moisture.
    The Soil moisture system is connected to the web page. We have interfaced the
    soil moisture sensor, DHTII Module, and relay with a Raspberry Pi Pico to measure
    the volumetric concentration of water inside the soil and the humidity and temperature
    of the surroundings. This system uses Raspberry Pi Pico as a microcontroller,
    which is then connected to the Moisture Sensor, which measures the soil''s moisture
    content. Raspberry Pi Pico acts as the central brain of the IoT-based soil moisture
    management system, responsible for data collection, processing, analysis, communication,
    and automated control. It is also linked to DHT -11, the Temperature and Humidity
    sensor, which measures the ambient temperature and humidity. The Pico is also
    connected to the Wi-Fi module ESP-Ol, bridging the divide between the hardware
    and software components of the system shown in fig. 2. The measurements of the
    above sensors and modules and the standard measurements will subsequently be displayed
    for users on our self-designed website using the ESP-Ol. Fig. 2. Schematic Layout
    of our Proposed System Show All SECTION IV. Experimentation & Model Evaluation
    The proposed intelligent system captures data in real-time using a range of sensors
    and modules shown in fig. 5. University gardeners use these sensors to assess
    soil and environmental conditions. The soil management system we built is responsible
    for several duties. It begins by measuring the soil moisture content using a capacitive
    soil moisture sensor and then monitors the humidity and temperature of the surrounding
    environment with a DHTII Module. All plants have a threshold value set to standard
    soil moisture content for home/university gardeners. When the moisture level falls
    below the set standard/threshold level, the relay module turns the Motor On and
    begins pumping water to the plants from the tank until the moisture level returns
    to the desired level. The measurements mentioned above’ readings will be shown
    on a website built with the ESP-OI, which we designed with HTML and CSS and coded
    in Python. Fig. 3 shows the hardware connection of sensors/modules to Raspberry
    Pico and figure 4 depicts the Circuit diagram of the connection of all the sensors,
    modules, and motors. Fig. 3. Hardware connection of sensors/modules to Pico Show

    model of our proposed System Show All SECTION V. Result Analysis & Validation
    The analysis of the results demonstrates the efficacy of IoT-based watering systems
    in sustaining optimal soil moisture levels for plant growth in the university.
    These systems provide optimal irrigation, water conservation, improved plant health
    and growth, resource efficiency, data-driven insights, remote monitoring and control,
    and flexibility. Using IoT technology, plant owners, farmers, and gardeners can
    achieve precise and effective watering techniques, resulting in healthier and
    more robust plants. The moisture reading experiments conducted at our University
    on different plants and shrubs can provide valuable insights into plant water
    requirements and watering patterns shown in fig. 6. Fig. 6. Soil moisture reading
    experimentation done at our University''s Plants & Shrubs Show All The collected
    data on moisture readings from the different plants and shrubs helps in understanding
    their specific water requirements and watering patterns. This IoT-based system
    enables informed decision-making regarding irrigation scheduling, optimization
    of water management practices, and adjustment of watering parameters based on
    the specific needs of each plant species. The model then starts measuring and
    taking the readings displayed on the Thonny Shell shown in fig. 7. Table I shows
    the soil moisture readings from the capacitive soil moisture sensor & level of
    accuracy of the sensor when compared to the recommended moisture level. Fig. 8
    depicts the soil moisture level and the recommended moisture needed for the plants.
    The relationship between soil moisture levels and the recommended moisture level
    for plants is graphically represented in Figure 8. Individuals can make informed
    decisions to promote healthy plant growth, conserve water, and preserve natural
    and agricultural ecosystems by comprehending this relationship. Gardeners can
    decide when and how much to water their plants by monitoring soil moisture and
    using the specified range. Avoiding under watering and overwatering optimizes
    plant growth and conserves water. Water management influences the ecological balance
    and is essential for plant and animal survival. Fig. 9, the online snapshot showing
    the moisture reading, promotes transparency, engagement, and accessibility, enhancing
    your research''s effect. It supports the study''s findings and contributes to
    broader educational and practical applications, promoting sustainable water management
    and nurturing collaboration within the scientific community. Fig. 7:. Thonny Shell

    University using IoT technology is developed and implemented. The system utilizes
    sensor nodes, wireless communication, and cloud computing to enable real-time
    monitoring and automated irrigation control. Through extensive testing and validation,
    the study demonstrates the system''s reliability and ability to improve water
    use efficiency compared to traditional methods. The IoT -based architecture of
    the system offers scalability and flexibility, making it adaptable to different
    crop types and field conditions within the university. The system revolutionizes
    soil moisture management practices by providing continuous, remote, and precise
    measurements of soil moisture levels. This contributes to the field of precision
    agriculture by offering an efficient and tailored solution for optimizing crop
    growth and yield. The implementation of this IoT -based system within SOA University

    to significantly benefit gardeners and farmers of the university by reducing labor,
    saving time, and increasing crop yields while minimizing damage. Furthermore,
    the system''s capability to conserve water and resources contributes to a more
    sustainable and environmentally friendly approach to agriculture. However, this
    research highlights the importance and effectiveness of IoT -based soil moisture
    management systems in precision agriculture. It showcases the potential for using
    advanced technologies to optimize crop growth, improve water management practices,

    IEEE Conference Location: Gorakhpur, India SECTION I. Introduction For the majority
    of people in India, agriculture is regarded as their main source of income, which
    should never be undervalued. In India, agriculture has been practised for thousands
    of years, and as new technologies and tools emerged, they gradually superseded
    conventional farming practises. Few farmers in India still practise traditional
    farming because they lack the means to employ contemporary methods. India ranks
    second in the world for agricultural outputs. According to the 2018 Indian Economic
    Survey, agriculture employed over 50% of the labour force and made up between
    17–18% of the GDP [4]. As a result, many people rely on agriculture as a source
    of income. Here, we''ll discuss a substantial portion of the agricultural industry,
    Oilseed Production. India is the fourth-largest producer of oilseeds in the world.
    It accounts for 10% of worldwide productivity and 20.8% of the world''s total
    cultivated land. The nation produces oilseeds for mustard, safflower, niger seed,
    sunflower, and sesame. Small farmers are only permitted to practise rainfed farming
    on nearly 72% of the oilseeds land, which has resulted in low output. However,
    by adding cutting-edge crop production technologies, a breakthrough in oilseed
    output was achieved. As a result, from 108.3 lakh tonnes in 1985–1986 to 365.65
    tonnes in 2020–21, oilseed production increased [9]. But due to the growing demand
    of oilseeds and increasing population there is serious need to further transform
    the conventional ways of its production. The notion of the Internet of Things
    (IoT) describes the automatic connection of numerous objects that are close to
    one another via wired and wireless networks. To offer users cutting-edge intelligent
    services, IoT objects share information and communicate with one another. IoT
    has piqued both academic and commercial interest since modern mobile devices are
    equipped with a variety of sensors and communication modules, as well as high-speed
    network technologies like Wi-Fi, LTE and latest technologies like 5G. IoT is currently
    used to link devices to the Internet and perform functions like detecting, actuating,
    gathering data, storing it and analysing it. Research is being done on a number
    of IoT services, including health care [10], traffic management [1], smart agriculture
    [7] and smart homes [2] based technologies. This paper discusses the implementation
    of IoT in oilseed cultivation where various foresaid sensors can be used to get
    information on the parameters like moisture and temperature which can be analysed
    to increase the productivity in the field. The sections of this paper are as follows:
    Section II discusses the relevant research being done in agricultural sector.
    The general stages of oilseed production are covered in Section III. The proposed
    hardware elements necessary for the various cultivation stages are discussed in
    Section IV. Some challenges needed to be addressed for successful implementation
    of this technology is elaborated in Section V. Section VI discusses the conclusion
    drawn from the work. Finally, section VII discusses the project''s potential future
    scope. SECTION II. Related Work In many countries, a lot of work has been done
    in the field of agriculture using IoT to modernise the sector. Some of them will
    be discussed in this section. Taiwan has developed an IoT technology for the Precision
    Soil Farming of turmeric cultivation [13]. The amount of chlorophyll in the turmeric
    plants was boosted by the IoT system from 40% to 60%, which is more than what
    could be achieved with current traditional methods, while also saving 70% of water.
    Thailand has developed an IoT water control system to track water usage. According
    to the results, the humidity level needed for lemon growth should be between 70
    and 80 percent, but temperatures of 29 and 32 degrees Celsius were required for
    excellent output in both vegetables and lemons, respectively [5]. In India, an
    IoT based monitoring system for grain storage has been proposed to minimise the
    unnecessary wastage of grains during its storage. The suggested system is made
    up of a microcontroller and a number of sensors that can gather data on things
    like temperature, humidity, and food quality and broadcast it to the client while
    also performing the necessary actions to keep the produce at the best possible
    environmental conditions [12]. So, generally speaking, IoT can be a game changer
    in agriculture sector to completely transform it [6]. This paper particularly
    deals with similar idea in the oilseed production. SECTION III. The Oilseed Cultivation
    Process Oilseeds are primarily grown for oil extraction. India is one of the leading
    producers of oilseeds in the world, producing a wide variety of oilseeds including
    groundnut, mustard, sesame, soybean, sunflower, and linseed. Groundnut is grown
    predominantly in the southern and western states of India, where the climate is
    hot and dry. The crop is sown between June and August and harvested between October
    and December. Soybean is grown in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan,
    with sowing starting from June and July and harvesting beginning in September
    and October. Sesame is grown in various parts of India, with Uttar Pradesh being
    the leading producer. The crop is sown during May to July and harvested in October
    and November. Sunflower is cultivated in the southern and western regions of the
    country, with sowing starting from June and July and harvesting beginning in October
    and November. Mustard is another significant oilseed crop in India, grown in the
    northern and central parts of the country, with sowing starting from October to
    November and harvesting starting from February to March. Linseed is grown in the
    cooler parts of India and is sown between October and December, with harvesting
    starting from February to April. Fig 1: Stages of Oilseed cultivation Show All
    The cultivation of oilseeds in India involves various steps, including land preparation,
    seed selection, sowing, irrigation, and harvesting. The first step in growing
    oilseeds is land preparation. Farmers need to select the right type of soil and
    ensure that it is adequately prepared for planting. The soil needs to be tilled,
    and any rocks or debris need to be removed. Farmers also need to ensure that the
    soil is adequately fertilized with organic and inorganic fertilizers to provide
    the required nutrients to the plants. Once the land is prepared, the next step
    is sowing. The time for sowing varies depending on the region and the type of
    oilseed being grown. For example, the best time to sow soybean is between June
    and July, while the best time to sow mustard is between October and November.
    The seeds are planted either by broadcasting or by drilling, depending on the
    type of oilseed being grown. After sowing, the plants need to be cared for properly.
    This includes regular watering, weeding, and pest control. Farmers also need to
    monitor the growth of the plants to ensure that they are developing well. Once
    the oilseeds are fully grown, it is time for harvesting. The time for harvesting
    varies depending on the type of oilseed being grown. For example, groundnut is
    harvested between October and December, while mustard is harvested between February
    and March. The harvesting process involves cutting the plants, collecting the
    seeds, and drying them in the sun. After drying, the oilseeds are taken to processing
    facilities where they are crushed to extract the oil. The extracted oil is then
    packaged and sold in the market. In conclusion, the cultivation of oilseeds in
    India is a complex process that involves several stages, including land preparation,
    sowing, caring for the plants, harvesting, and processing. Because of the challenges,
    we should use the modern technologies such as IoT to improve the productivity
    in the oilseed cultivation [8]. SECTION IV. Proposed Systems Some important agricultural
    practices include timed and proper irrigation, pest and pathogen management, optimized
    harvesting and others during the production phase. Post harvest one needs to take
    necessary steps towards monitoring and protecting the produce against pest and
    pathogen attacks, theft and other issues. Some of these aforementioned issues
    can be efficiently addressed by means of IoT thereby maximizing the produce, hence
    the profit. Listed below are few IoT sensors for the respective applications:
    A. Pest Surveillance and Control Pests such as mustard aphid, mustard sawfly and
    the painted bug can cause serious threats to these crops leading to poor produce.
    Monitoring and finding out the density of pest infestations forms a basis for
    their control. A combination of cameras and gas sensor can help analysing this
    density more precisely. FLIR E60: The FLIR E60 offers outstanding thermal imaging
    capabilities along with onboard visual camera and 76,200-pixel infrared (IR) resolution,
    enabling users to diagnose issues more quickly, easily prepare thorough reports,
    and immediately connect to mobile devices to wirelessly share insights. Noting
    the temperature differences between the suspected object and surrounding plant
    area can assist in detection of pests. With the help of suitable algorithms this
    method can provide greater insights. SONY XCG SERIES: Visual inspection is another
    way of detecting these pests. Conventionally this is performed on site by an expert,
    but with modern AI tools and machine vision this procedure can be automated. The
    Sony XCG series provides a future for the same through the machine vision capabilities.
    E-NOSE: An array of gas sensors such as metal-oxide and conductive polymer gas
    sensors that are selectively overlapped by the electronic nose, together with
    a component for pattern reorganisation, make up this intelligent sensing device.
    When attacked by pests, due to stress, plants release Volatile Organic Compounds
    (VOCs) in their surroundings. With the detection of these VOCs, we can identify
    where pest infestation has occurred. Pest Control: Information inferred from the
    monitoring devices can help to gain a control over these pests. Among many modern-day
    solutions some of them are discussed briefly below- Yellow sticky traps: Bright
    yellow colour attracts many flying insects, such as aphids. Insects cannot escape
    the sticky coating on the traps once they land on it. These can be directly hung
    in the highly infested areas. Pheromone Traps: Animals and insects use pheromones,
    which are chemicals, to communicate with one another. These chemical signals are
    used by insects to find food, attract mates or warn other insects of predators.
    These pheromones are synthesised in labs and used as a trap for insects such as
    sawflies. Insecticides: Judicious use of insecticides such as malathion 50 EC
    @1000 ml, dimethoate 30 EC, Spinetoram 11.7 SC 1.0mll/it. and others can be used
    to get rid of pests. From the data deduced from the monitoring devices, use of
    pesticides and insecticides can be highly minimized, hence reducing the costs.
    B. Pathogen Management Pathogens such as Plasmodiophora brassicae, Verticillium
    longisporum, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Phoma lingam can affect the crops severely.
    The diseases caused by them can be detected by use of thermal cameras such as
    FLIR E60 and hyper spectroscopy. Hyper spectroscopy can be performed with the
    aid of cameras such as VNIR and SWIR cameras [11]. Azoxystrobin, boscalid, and
    pyraclostrobin are some of the fungicides to prevent pathogen development. C.
    Smart Irrigation Lack of proper irrigation facilities can result into a huge loss.
    Also, uneven rainfall may serve a big reason for the same. Introduction of IoT
    devices in this field can be a promising solution to this problem. Analysing weather
    and soil conditions can pave a path to distribute water more efficiently. This
    can either be fulfilled through sprinklers or drip irrigation. Weather-data and
    data obtained from the soil sensors can be used to define the gap between need
    and availability. It can guide an automated tool, the quantity and frequency of
    water to be distributed. With these correct doses, the chances of crop failure
    are minimized. TEROS 12: This capacitive-sensor is capable of measuring moisture,
    temperature and electrical conductivity of soil. It reads ∼0.70 m3/m3 in water
    and a slightly negative value in air. With the measurement of moisture of soil
    and other geographical conditions such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, etc.,
    an optimum amount of water requirement of soil can be found out. Without any human
    aid and interaction, the drip-irrigation system can be automated and controlled
    so that only required doses of water are let into the field. D. Optimized Harvesting
    Integration of yield sensors, auto steering, section control, Global Positioning
    System (GPS) applied technologies and others can help to automate and optimize
    harvesting hence reducing labour costs and improving efficiency. YieldSense: Thorough
    knowledge of yield like amount, distribution across the field can help to take
    decisions and undertake careful planning and strategies to increase the profit.
    This is possible with the help of yield sensors. YieldSense, a yield sensor accurately
    measures varying crop flow rates and generates required information [14]. This
    can be set up with combine for its usage. Fig 2: TEROS 12 Sensor Show All E. Storage
    Storage of oilseeds is the most important phase of the process. Before storage
    of oilseeds, cleaning is also necessary to avoid impurities such as stones, weed
    seeds, twigs and other contaminants. Negligence in any manner may be catastrophic
    leading to huge losses in financial terms. Regular monitoring, controlled environment
    and integrated automation strategies can enhance the productivity. IoT sensors
    that can be used here are: EE23: This sensor monitors temperature and humidity
    of the warehouses where the harvest is stored. Maintenance of optimum moisture
    and temperature is essential to protect it against pathogen attacks, moisture
    loss and others. [3] Pathogen and pest management: Using sensors such as thermal
    cameras (FLIR e60) and gas sensors (eNose) can help detect pests and pathogens.
    Based on this, suitable actions must be taken on a priority to minimize the losses.
    BRUKER MPA II: Checking moisture in oilseeds is a very critical parameter. High
    moisture levels can lead to fungi growth whereas low moisture can make the oilseed
    more brittle. Regular moisture level checks are necessary for the same. The Bruker
    MPA II is a handheld device that is capable of performing various types of material
    analysis, including moisture analysis. The device uses Near Infrared (NIR) technology
    to measure the moisture content of a material. Fig 3: EE23 Sensor Show All Fig
    4: Optimum moisture levels of different oilseeds Show All SECTION V. Challenges
    The proposed system involves use of IoT in agricultural practices, particularly
    for Oilseed applications. Despite its great potential, some of the challenges
    are currently inevitable. A large amount of data is generated which needs to be
    managed properly. Limited technical expertise of farmers can be an obstacle for
    the proper implementation. It is also crucial to use appropriate security features
    to protect data from cyber-attacks. Connectivity issues in remote areas, high
    deployment and maintenance costs, lack of standardization in data formats are
    few other challenges needed to be addressed [7]. Some of them are briefly discussed
    below: Connectivity: For IoT devices to work properly, connectivity must be dependable
    and widespread. However, a lot of rural areas have poor or erratic internet connectivity,
    which can make it difficult for IoT systems to function as intended. Overcoming
    connectivity issues requires using alternative connectivity methods like satellite
    or LoRaWAN, as well as implementing a strong network infrastructure. Interoperability:
    IoT systems in agriculture use a variety of hardware, including sensors, platforms,
    and platforms from various manufacturers. It can be difficult to ensure interoperability
    between these various components. To solve interoperability problems, open standards
    and protocols, data compatibility and sharing, and strong integration frameworks
    must all be used. Cost: Implementing IoT in agriculture can be expensive, due
    to the need to buy devices and set up the necessary infrastructure. The cost of
    adopting IoT solutions can be a barrier for many farmers, particularly small-scale
    farmers with limited financial resources. Financial difficulties can be overcome
    by creating cost-effective IoT solutions and looking into funding possibilities,
    subsidies, or partnerships. Power Management: The effective operation of IoT devices
    requires a constant power source. Even in remote locations, many agricultural
    environments lack a dependable and easily accessible power infrastructure. Overcoming
    problems with the power supply can be accomplished by implementing effective power
    management solutions, such as solar panels, battery backups, or energy-harvesting
    methods. Data Ownership and Control: Large amounts of data, including sensitive
    information about crops, yields, and farm operations, are collected and analysed
    as a result of IoT in agriculture. Farmers must have ownership, privacy, and the
    ability to control how their data is used over their data. It is crucial to establish
    precise data ownership and control policies, guarantee data security, and uphold
    open data handling procedures. Integration with Existing Systems: There are already
    established systems and procedures in place for many agricultural operations.
    It can be difficult to integrate IoT solutions with current hardware, software,
    and infrastructure. To minimise disruption and maximise the benefits of IoT implementation,
    compatibility issues, data exchange formats, and ensuring seamless integration
    with legacy systems need to be addressed. Return on Investment (ROI): When implementing
    IoT solutions, farmers need to consider the potential return on investment. The
    upfront investment, ongoing expenses, increased productivity, resource optimisation,
    and long-term sustainability should all be taken into account in the cost-benefit
    analysis. Greater adoption of IoT can be sparked by demonstrating the financial
    value and practical advantages of its use. Data Management: IoT devices produce
    enormous amounts of data, and effectively managing and analysing this data is
    essential for gaining insightful knowledge. However, it can be difficult and expensive
    to gather, store, process, and analyse massive amounts of data in real-time. Extraction
    of useful intelligence requires the implementation of strong data management strategies,
    including platforms for data storage, processing, and analytics. SECTION VI. Conclusion
    In conclusion, the application of IoT technology in oilseed production has the
    potential to revolutionize the industry by improving the efficiency and sustainability
    of production processes. By providing real-time monitoring and control of various
    factors such as soil moisture, temperature, and pest control, IoT systems can
    help farmers make informed decisions and optimize crop yields. Additionally, the
    use of IoT sensors can help reduce waste, lower costs, and improve overall product
    quality. Despite the challenges, the benefits of implementing IoT in oilseed production
    are clear and will likely become increasingly important as global demand for edible
    oils and biofuels continues to grow. It is therefore essential for stakeholders
    in the industry to invest in IoT infrastructure and embrace the potential of this
    transformative technology. SECTION VII. Future Scope In future, work can be done
    on this topic to get the most optimized method for the implementation of software
    components which will perform the needed calculations. The software results will
    suggest best ways for irrigation and further increasing productivity, thus the
    economy in this sector. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics More Like

    India SECTION I. Introduction Agriculture has been the backbone of India''s economy
    for centuries, with around 70% of the population relying on it for their livelihoods.
    However, with the increasing global population, climate change, and depleting
    resources, farmers in India are facing numerous challenges in the field. These
    challenges range from unpredictable weather conditions to the lack of proper irrigation
    techniques, which ultimately affect crop yield and quality. This research paper
    presents an IoT-based irrigation method for agriculture that aims to address the
    challenges faced by farmers in India. To support our research, we conducted a
    comprehensive review of several IoT-based applications and research published
    in the agricultural sector. The review highlights the potential of IoT in addressing
    the challenges faced by farmers in India and provides insights into the current
    state of research in this field. SECTION II. Literature Review In this part of
    our research paper, we have reviewed different ways used for irrigation. There
    are many ways to do irrigation using IOT using different microcontrollers. We
    have reviewed work done by research as per their prototype. Some of them are listed
    below: A device created by Srishti Rawal automatically irrigates fields depending
    on sensor data for temperature and humidity as well as the kind of crop. Both
    hardware and software components are part of the system. The hardware consists
    of an embedded system with moisture sensors, an Arduino Uno, and a GSM GPRS SIM900A
    modem [19]. The software element is a web page created in PHP that is hosted online
    and has a database for storing sensor data gathered by the hardware. The system
    employs a threshold value for the moisture content to irrigate the area. The sprinklers
    are turned on when the moisture level drops below the threshold and run until
    the soil is entirely soaked. On the website, the system also shows the moisture
    content in two categories, Low and High. When the moisture level falls into the
    Low category, the pump is turned on. The soil type being used affects the threshold
    values. Using a GSM GPRS modem, the hardware gadget sends data from the sensors
    to the internet. The information is then saved in a database that is accessible
    online and utilized to show moisture content on the website. Additionally, the
    system sends data from the two sensors to ThingSpeak, an open data platform, and
    Internet of Things API. Users may gather, save, examine, display, and take action
    on data from sensors or actuators like Arduino using ThingSpeak [1]. M Gayathri''s
    system is composed of two layers: the sensor layer and the application layer.
    The former is responsible for gathering data from sensors and converting it into
    a digital format suitable for use in a virtual environment. To achieve this, the
    layer utilizes a range of tools such as GPS sensors, cameras, and RFID to collect
    market and physical information, which is then transformed into digital data through
    the use of the NodeMCU board and MQTT protocol. On the other hand, the application
    layer is responsible for interpreting the data gathered by the sensor layer, thereby
    providing insight into the real world. The integration of agricultural market
    intelligence and IoT in this layer helps in fostering digital awareness of the
    physical world. The NodeMCU board, which is an open-source IoT platform featuring
    ESP8266-12E chips, is used in the system to publish sensor data to the Losant
    Message Broker through the MQTT protocol. The soil moisture sensor is also utilized
    in the system to measure the soil''s volumetric water content. The Losant platform
    stores the data gathered by the system and makes it accessible through the visualization
    tool. Furthermore, the system allows clients to subscribe to the stored data from
    the Losant MQTT broker by subscribing to commands initiated using the Losant workflow
    [2]. P. Divya Vani employed a hygrometric method to detect soil moisture in her
    study. This method makes use of the FC-287, a low-cost and low-power sensor. The
    sensor has an onboard facility for the interface, making data collection and analysis
    straightforward. Specifically, the FC-287 sensor was used due to its accuracy
    and reliability, making it a cost-effective and efficient way to estimate the
    moisture content of the soil through changes in its electrical properties. Researchers
    have chosen to conduct their experiment in Southern India, where a significant
    portion of the region''s land is covered with red and black soils [3]. Dr. M.
    Newlin Rajkumar proposes a project that emphasizes monitoring temperature and
    soil moisture to build a smart irrigation system utilizing Arduino. The goal of
    the project is to provide an alternative to conventional farming techniques and
    create a system that enables farmers to remotely monitor their fields from anywhere
    in the world. The proposed technology is intended to be practical and useful for
    Indian farmers and features an automated irrigation feature for agricultural regions.
    The main component of the system is the Arduino microcontroller. The development
    of an automated irrigation system aims to maximize water use for crops by enabling
    control of appliances without human involvement. The system''s main objectives
    are the autonomous operation of the water motor and the live broadcasting of the
    farm on Android mobile devices via Wi-Fi, The innovative concept is intended to
    help Indian farmers by giving them access to low-cost smart irrigation technology
    that can assist them in maximizing crop yields and minimizing water waste by remotely
    monitoring and managing water consumption. The proposed smart irrigation monitoring
    system is an essential step toward sustainable farming practices. With the increasing
    global demand for food, it is necessary to develop technologies that enable farmers
    to grow more crops efficiently while minimizing water use. By utilizing the Arduino
    microcontroller, the system provides a cost-effective solution for remote monitoring
    and controlling irrigation systems. This technology can potentially benefit farmers
    in other regions facing similar challenges, making it a valuable contribution
    to sustainable agriculture [4]. Ravi Kishore Kodali''s solution leverages a NodeMCU
    board as a client, which uses the MQTT protocol to relay sensor data to the Losant
    Message Broker. The data is kept under the subject Losant/DEVICE ID/state, where
    DEVICE ID is the device''s unique identity. To be effectively understood by Losant,
    the data must adhere to a specified JSON-based payload. The platform''s visualization
    tool enables instant access to data stored in Losant. Clients must subscribe to
    the commands issued through Losant''s workflow on the subject Losant/DEVICE ID/commands
    in order to subscribe to the stored data from the Losant MQTT broker. The project
    utilizes the NodeMCU, which is a low-cost, breadboard-friendly, and open-source
    IoT platform integrating ESP8266-12E chips, and can be conveniently powered using
    a USB to micro-USB cable. Additionally, the system incorporates soil moisture
    sensors to monitor soil moisture levels, which are critical for maintaining optimal
    plant growth. By analyzing the data collected by the sensors using the Losant
    platform, informed decisions can be made regarding irrigation and other farming
    practices [5]. Dr. Madhu Kumari suggests that farmers can benefit greatly from
    a planned prototype that includes a smart watering system monitored by the Internet
    of Things (IoT). Currently, farmers have to manually enter their fields for irrigation
    purposes and remain there to ensure that water does not overflow. This procedure
    can take up a significant amount of time, and can also be unhealthy, especially
    during extreme weather conditions. With the implementation of a smart watering
    system, farmers can avoid these mishaps and make their work easier. The smart
    watering system is designed to start the motor automatically after a particular
    moisture content value has been reached and shut it off once it reaches a limit
    value that the farmer or system has established. This eliminates the need for
    frequent visits to the field. Additionally, the system requires a nominal power
    supply between 5 and 9 volts to operate, and the motor requires power in accordance
    with its rating. By using this system, farmers can save a significant amount of
    time and effort and also avoid potential health hazards. The implementation of
    this technology can have a positive impact on the agricultural industry as a whole,
    by making farming more efficient, safer, and more sustainable [6]. A. Anitha suggests
    a system that can automate the process of watering plants by keeping track of
    the field''s moisture content. The target audience for this product includes farmers
    and gardeners who may not have the time or resources to physically water their
    plants. The technology incorporates temperature and moisture sensors to measure
    the plants'' temperature and moisture content. If the moisture level is detected
    to be lower than expected, the system activates the Water Pump to deliver water
    to the selected plant. The system is highly adaptable as it can be used both indoors
    and outdoors. Figures 11 and 12 depict the system''s functioning model. This low-cost
    and low-maintenance technology has the potential to replace conventional farming
    systems and aid crops in utilizing water efficiently. It can help Indian farmers
    increase agricultural yields while reducing water waste. The system''s automated
    watering process can save farmers and gardeners valuable time and resources, making
    it easier for them to maintain their crops. Moreover, the use of moisture sensors
    can ensure that plants receive the appropriate amount of water, preventing over-watering
    and water waste [7]. K. Phasinam proposes a system centered on the development
    of a smart irrigation system using Raspberry Pi and different sensing devices
    to monitor environmental conditions. The Raspberry Pi board has a single-core
    32-bit ARM11 CPU, 512 MB of RAM, USB connectors, an Ethernet port, an HDMI connector,
    and an SD card slot, which are all used in the configuration. The system employs
    sensors such as the YL-69 soil moisture sensor and the DHT11/DHT22 humidity sensor
    to continuously monitor soil moisture and humidity levels. Machine learning methods
    such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forests, and Naive Bayes are utilized
    to store acquired data in a cloud storage system. In order to give correct information
    for crop management and ultimately optimize water use and crop production, these
    algorithms analyse soil and climatic data [8]. Table I. Technology and features
    The table provided above offers a summary of the work that has been conducted
    over the past few years. It also aids in comprehending the utilized technologies
    and the features of each system (Table 1). SECTION III. Literature Gap The authors
    created and executed an IoT-based smart irrigation model in this study, which
    fills a gap in the literature by giving a full analysis and assessment of the
    suggested system. There is no empirical proof or data in the study to demonstrate
    the effectiveness and performance of the suggested system. Field studies and experiments
    would be beneficial in evaluating the system''s capacity to detect moisture levels
    reliably, automate watering, and optimize water consumption. Unlike past research,
    we conducted comprehensive field testing and experiments to acquire actual information
    and data on the usefulness and performance of our smart watering system. The proposed
    model utilizes IoT technology to monitor soil moisture levels in real-time and
    automate the irrigation process accordingly. By integrating sensors, actuators,
    and a central control system, we have created a reliable and efficient system
    for optimizing water usage in agricultural settings. SECTION IV. Mathedology The
    system is composed of both hardware and software components. The hardware includes
    an Arduino UNO, soil moisture sensors, a motor driver, two motor pumps, wires,
    and a Bluetooth HC-05 module (Fig. 1). The proposed prototype of a smart watering
    system monitored by IoT can greatly benefit farmers by saving them time and effort.
    Currently, farmers have to spend several hours or even a whole day in the field
    to ensure that water does not overflow during irrigation. This process is repeated
    until the last watering from the start, resulting in a lot of wasted time and
    potential health risks due to exposure to extreme weather conditions. With the
    implementation of this system, farmers can avoid the need for constant field monitoring
    as the system is designed to automatically start the motor once the moisture content
    value falls below a certain threshold and switch it off when it reaches a predetermined
    limit set by the farmer or system. The system requires a nominal power supply
    of 5 to 9 volts to operate, and the motor will need power according to its capacity.
    By incorporating this technology, farmers can save time, reduce manual labour,
    and increase productivity, resulting in improved living and working conditions
    for all involved. Fig. 1. Circuit Diagram Show All The given image represents
    a prototype of the experiment, showcasing the physical implementation of the proposed
    smart watering system. It provides a visual representation of the hardware components,
    including the Arduino UNO, soil moisture sensors, motor driver, motor pumps, wires,
    and Bluetooth HC-05 module. The prototype image offers a tangible glimpse into
    the design and configuration of the system, setting the stage for further evaluation
    and analysis (Fig. 2). Fig. 2. Prototype Image Show All A. Software Part Arduino
    IDE (Integrated Development Environment) [12] is a software platform used for
    writing, compiling, and uploading code to an Arduino microcontroller (Fig. 3).
    The IDE also allows the user to specify the board type, port, and programmer,
    making it easy to configure and upload code to the Arduino. The programming language
    used in Arduino IDE is based on Wiring, a simplified version of C++ that is easier
    to learn for beginners. B. Hardware Part To develop the prototype we have used
    the following components: 1) Arduino Uno An open-source microcontroller board
    called Arduino Uno is built around the ATmega328P microprocessor (Fig. 3). For
    designing and developing electronic projects, it offers a flexible and user-friendly
    environment. It is well-liked for a variety of applications in the maker and DIY
    communities since it has digital and analog input/output ports, onboard programming,
    and communication capabilities [12], [14]. Fig. 3. Arduino UNO Show All 2) Hc-05
    Bluetooth Module The HC-05 Bluetooth module is a commonly used wireless communication
    module (Fig. 4).[17], [20] It permits Bluetooth-based serial communication between
    devices. It may function as a slave or master device, allowing for wireless data
    with other Bluetooth-capable gadgets like smartphones, tablets, and microcontrollers.
    Fig. 4. HC-05 Bluetooth module Show All 3) Soil Moisture Sensor A tool used to
    measure the soil''s moisture content is a soil moisture sensor (Fig. 5). For effective
    irrigation and the control of plant health in agricultural and gardening applications,
    it detects the water level in the soil and delivers information about soil moisture
    conditions [9]–[22]. Fig. 5. Soil Moisture Sensor Show All 4) Motor Driver An
    electric motor''s functioning, direction, and speed are managed by a motor driver[16],
    an electrical device. It serves as an interface between the motor and a microcontroller
    or other control electronics, providing the power and signals required to accurately
    and efficiently regulate motor motions (Fig. 6). Fig. 6. Motor Driver Show All
    5) Water Pump Motor An electric motor designed simply for pumping water is known
    as a water pump motor [13], [21]. It is used in many different systems, including
    irrigation, water delivery, and water circulation systems (Fig. 7). The motor
    supplies the water pump''s essential power, allowing for effective water flow
    and distribution [15]. Fig. 7. Water Pump motor Show All 6) Jumper Wire In order
    to provide temporary connections between electronic components on a breadboard
    or circuit board, jumper wires are electrical cables with connector pins at either
    end (Fig. 8). They make it simple and adaptable to wire electrical circuits for
    prototyping and testing, allowing for quick and practical linkages between various
    parts. Fig. 8. Jumper Wire Show All SECTION V. Results and Discussion The output
    of the soil moisture sensor is shown in the below figure for the IoT-based smart
    irrigation system (Fig. 9). In order to ensure enough irrigation, the system sends
    a signal to start the water motor if the moisture level falls below 70%. When
    the moisture content hits 70%, the motor automatically turns off to save water
    and avoid over-irrigation. This automated procedure successfully saves resources
    while maintaining the ideal moisture level for agricultural needs. Fig. 9. Irrigation

    in agriculture has been conducted. By synthesizing the findings from these studies,
    valuable insights into the current state of research have been gained, and critical
    gaps that require attention have been identified. Additionally, an innovative
    model has been proposed, emphasizing the integration of IoT in the agricultural
    sector. This model utilizes connected devices and sensors to optimize irrigation
    practices, enhance water management, and improve overall agricultural productivity.

    transforming conventional farming techniques and addressing the challenges faced
    by the agricultural community. The suggested model serves as a platform for future
    research efforts aimed at fostering sustainable and efficient agricultural systems
    capable of meeting the ever-increasing needs of an ever-changing globe. SECTION
    VII. Future Scope In the proposed methodology, we have developed an IoT model
    for irrigation. However, the future scope of this project is to leverage cloud
    technology to enhance the system''s compatibility. By incorporating the ESP8266
    Wi-Fi module [18], it will be able to seamlessly transmit and receive data to
    and from the cloud. This integration of cloud technology will significantly broaden
    the research possibilities, particularly in the study of soil behavior across
    various regions of the country. The cloud system''s introduction will enable comprehensive
    data collection, analysis, and storage, offering researchers valuable insights
    into the diverse characteristics of soils. This expansion in scope holds great
    potential for advancing our understanding of soil dynamics and optimizing irrigation
    practices, ultimately contributing to sustainable agricultural practices and improved
    crop yields. ACKNOWLEDGMENT The author expresses sincere appreciation to all individuals

    Location: Seattle, WA, USA SECTION I. Introduction Droughts are a recurring climatic
    phenomenon in different parts of the world that have serious consequences in terms
    of the restriction of water supply that aggravates human health, food security
    and the ecosystems that surround us; being considered one of the most important
    threats that prevents sustainable development at a global level [1]. Droughts
    are often frequent in arid and semi-arid regions; however, due to climate change
    caused by the overexploitation of resources and deforestation, this event is also
    occurring in humid areas, causing great harm to farmers who usually carry out
    their activities in times when rains used to abound [2]. According to the Food
    and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), about 11% of the world''s
    population suffers from water scarcity and more than 30% of the planet''s land
    is affected by drought; it also mentions that they are increasing due to climate
    change and other anthropogenic factors [3]. Drought is one of the main challenges
    facing agriculture today in the world since it has a direct impact on crops for
    food production by reducing yield and quality due to the lack of the necessary
    amount of water that is required. for their growth and development [4]. Lack of
    water resources can cause plants to wither, lose leaves, flowers, and fruits,
    or even die. In addition, plants become more vulnerable to diseases and pests,
    further increasing the risk of loss that farmers may have in the face of these
    difficulties [5]. This means that drought in agriculture is not limited to affecting
    food production, since it has a significant economic impact in countries where
    agriculture is an important source of sustaining the economy, which consequently
    brings the decrease in income of farmers and greater financial pressure [6]. In
    recent years, Peru is one of the countries that has experienced several droughts
    that mainly affect agriculture and livestock in the northern part of the country.
    In particular, the 2016-2017 drought was one of the most intense in recent years
    and consequently affected more than a million people in 12 regions of the country
    [7]. To counteract and deal with droughts, measures were implemented, such as
    the construction of irrigation dams, implementation of irrigation systems, promotion
    of water conservation practices, improvement of watershed management, and the
    creation of emergency plans to the supply of drinking water. However, a more comprehensive
    and sustainable approach is required to address the underlying causes of droughts
    and ensure the resilience of communities and ecosystems to the impacts of climate
    change [8]. In search of improving the development of these irrigation systems
    implemented in previous investigations, an automated drip system for cocoa cultivation
    was developed, which seeks to improve the economic profitability of the project
    with the help of various financial ratios [9]. In the same way, in another investigation,
    a temperature, soil humidity and relative humidity control system is described
    to optimize the performance of indoor crops. This proposal is made up of star-type
    nodes that are directly interconnected to the main source known as Gateway and
    as a result it was obtained that the implementation of XBEE modules in the developed
    WSN allowed the implementation of wireless communication between various devices
    [10]. For this reason, in this research work, the implementation of a drip irrigation
    system that can be monitored with the help of an IoT system that implements the
    MQTT protocol that seeks the most efficient use of water resources in agriculture
    is proposed. The project will be developed through mechanical, mechatronic and
    control systems that seek to create an automated irrigation system capable of
    controlling soil moisture and water from surface sources more efficiently and
    avoiding wasting water on crops. Fig. 1. Data processing stages of the irrigation
    system Show All SECTION II. Materials and methods The design presented in Fig.
    1, is composed of 5 stages that will allow farmers to better monitor the irrigation
    systems that are being implemented in their crops, which have the following characteristics:
    First stage: It is important to have the appropriate parameters controlled so
    that the crops obtain enough water without generating waste, for which this stage
    contains the sensors and actuators that will allow the efficient use of water.
    Second stage: To make adequate water consumption, a series of applications must
    be carried out using a controller that allows turning on and off the flow of water
    to the crops based on the readings obtained from strategically located sensors.
    Third stage: Although the controller can display the data locally on an HMI, it
    is considered important to have an MQTT broker that allows the sending and receiving
    of data that allows actions to be carried out instantly, such as remote shutdown
    of water valves, verify the state of crops and others. For which this essential
    component is required to interconnect messages between devices and users through
    secure access. Fourth stage: The storage of data and its exposure in the cloud
    is an important component of IIoT technology today, for which it is proposed to
    connect this project to the network and the data collected throughout the day
    can be stored in a database. remote data that allows to acquire them later for
    the generation of reports, tables and carry out an analysis of how water consumption
    is being carried out. Fifth stage: The generation of a panel where the data is
    visualized and it is possible to interact remotely with the actuators and sensors
    nowadays is something feasible thanks to the IIoT technology, for which the present
    project seeks to generate an interactive panel that can be accessed from any device
    that is enabled to connect to the database located in the cloud. A. Irrigation
    system. The development of the software is carried out using 3 main components
    that generate a control system that come to be composed of the sensors for the
    detection of the use of water, of actuators that generate a flow of water and
    the controller that based on the readings obtained from the sensors command the
    actuator to produce a flow of water. Sensors: In order to measure the adequate
    use of water without causing waste, sensors were considered that allow a complete
    monitoring of the use of water during the process from its obtaining in the water
    tanks to the correct dispersion in the crops, for which the following were considered:
    sensors: Level sensor: Integral for the control of the height of some material
    inside a container, this sensor will allow farmers to know the amount of water
    they have in their reservoirs to supply all their crops. Flowmeter: The characteristics
    of the flow of water from the reservoir to the crops is essential to know the
    approximate consumption of water in a certain time and if the water from the reservoir
    will be sufficient during the projected irrigation time. Humidity sensor: A correct
    supply of water to the crops is essential to provide an amount that is neither
    excessive so as not to drag the nutrients nor insufficient to leave the plants
    thirsty, for which the humidity sensors allow a correct estimation of the water
    levels provided. Actuators: As a fundamental part of the automation and control
    processes, actuators are required to control the volume of water in use by opening
    or closing the flow that is controlled by programmed times and according to the
    availability of water in the reservoir, for which considered the following actuator:
    Solenoid valve: Controlling the flow of water is essential to maintain a correct
    supply, for which the solenoid valves can work very efficiently to cut off the
    flow of water. Controller: Irrigation programming is essential to avoid wasting
    water, for which the implementation of a PLC was required, which seeks to control
    the main electrovalve(s) that will pass the water from the water supply with a
    controlled flow based on the parameters obtained from the sensors. Likewise, the
    PLC will allow the addition of a direct connection with a computer that allows
    data transfer and interaction with the controls from the cloud [11]. Fig. 2. Distribution
    of the irrigation system Show All Figure 2 shows a greater scope of the system
    distribution, for which there are certain requirements for the hydraulic system,
    for which some formulas were used to validate the size of the pipes that will
    be used. To calculate the velocity of the water through the pipes, the Williams
    and Hazen formula was used: v=0.8494×C× ( Di 4 ) 0.63 × S 0.54 (1) View Source
    Where, v is the average speed of the water in the pipe in (m/s), C is the coefficient
    that depends on the roughness of the pipe, S is the internal area of the pipe
    (m³) and Di is the wet perimeter. Additionally, the flow calculation will be carried
    out with the formula: Q=v∗A (2) View Source Where Q is the Flow (m3/s), v is the
    speed and A is the area (m). B. MQTT Brocker As an intermediary between the farmers
    who seek to obtain the data remotely and the irrigation system, there is an MQTT
    Brocker, which is installed on a microcomputer that works as a server for sending
    and receiving messages from the client (PLC) and routes them to the recipients
    (farmers'' devices) [12]. Additionally, due to security issues, the microcomputer
    manages the authentication and authorization of the users who may use the subscription
    method to receive the data on their devices. Likewise, the use of the microcomputer
    allows the installation of Node-Red for the creation of nodes that facilitate
    the sending of the data acquired by the PLC to a database during the activation
    of the irrigation system and the use of the MQTT protocol at the same time as
    described shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3. Interaction with the MQTT Brocker Show All
    C. Software implemtation So that the user can easily interact with the data that
    is being acquired by the sensors, the implementation of 3 components that allow
    the storage of the readings and their arrangement in a friendly interface was
    considered. 1) LabVIEW User interfaces can be created using a wide variety of
    tools and graphic elements, a simple solution for the implementation of interfaces
    in the industrial environment is LabVIEW, since it makes it easy to add advanced
    functionalities in a user interface such as adding sliders, graphs, tables and
    more; that allow real-time interaction with external devices through the visualization
    of data in these elements and the ease of integrating algorithms and complex models
    [13]. For this reason, this software was implemented in the microcomputer that
    the user have with the help of the graphic tools that it can see in the Fig. 4.
    Fig. 4. Programming done in LabVIEW Show All 2) MySQL and Node One of the facilities
    when using Node-Red within the microcomputer is that it allows data to be sent
    to an SQL-type database that is one of the most used on the market, this being
    MySQL. With them, it will be possible to provide a simple storage of the readings
    that are made by the sensors in a structured way and with a time stamp that allows
    recognizing the date and time of the readings [14], [15]. With the structured
    database, this data can be consumed by means of SQL queries to be able to filter
    them and to be able to generate reports on how the irrigation has been carried
    out in a certain period of time, for which the table with the columns was structured.
    which can be seen in Fig. 5. Fig. 5. Attributes declared in in MySQL Workbench.
    Show All 3) Progressive Web App The possibility that users can acquire data from
    any device and be able to interact with them is a need that many have today, for
    which there is the possibility of creating applications for both desktop and mobile
    devices, but that require their development. in different environments and that
    for this project it is not so required [16]. Therefore, the implementation of
    a PWA was proposed, which was built using web technologies such as HTML, CSS and
    JS that, although they are generally used for web programming, currently have
    the possibility of transforming them into a modern web application with the capabilities
    to behave like a native application that breaks the barriers of the type of device
    and the operating system that the user is using, since this opens the possibility
    of receiving push notifications, using the camera and microphone, as well as generating
    application icons that can be anchored to the main screen of the device and avoids
    the need to enter the corresponding link to the HOST every time the user wants
    to view the interface. SECTION III. Results As can be seen in Fig 4. The programming
    of the interface in LabVIEW was carried out using two loops. The first loop, located
    on the left side, turns the irrigation system on and off by measuring the amount
    of water available in the reservoir to conserve reserves if necessary; On the
    other hand, the second loop monitors the humidity sensors to verify the state
    of the crops. These loops were built using certain considerations for the test
    tests where the following parameters were considered: Control of the humidity
    of the ground at 60%, the blocking of the water supply at 40% and the restriction
    of the supply at 40% were executed during the soil hardening period. To cover
    the entire sowing of the test, humidity control was carried out in each plot and
    the sensor was positioned with an approximate depth of 20 centimeters.. Fig. 6.
    Integrated irrigation system in Lab View. Show All In addition to the local view
    that can be had in the LabVIEW tool, the interaction of the database and the MQTT
    protocol with the created PWA allows the acquisition of data in real time and
    the generation of linear graphs. Within the PWA the user can observe the evolution
    of the measurements captured by the sensor over time, additionally this monitoring
    can be done from any device that has Internet access to see the summary of the
    data in real time. Fig. 7. Developed PWA Show All The implementation of the system
    developed in the present investigation presents several positive impacts to agriculture
    and to the people who live in the surroundings of the valley, which are summarized
    in Table I. Additionally, the system brings a great economic advantage for farmers
    by generating a long-term sustainable project by reducing the use of resources
    and improving the efficiency of harvests. TABLE I. Research Benefits SECTION IV.
    Discussion In a previous investigation carried out by Rendon G. [17], the objective
    was to control irrigation systems in Mexico using artificial intelligence for
    their control, to be able to regulate the amount of water that is used by their
    irrigation systems. However, only a simulation of its interface was carried out
    and the benefits that this system produced were not validated. Similarly, other
    research developed a soil moisture sensor that can be implemented in automated
    irrigation systems, but since it was developed to be used in areas with specific
    soil quality characteristics, it cannot be applied to all types of soil. desired
    irrigation systems [18]. The results obtained during this investigation are to
    some extent like the findings presented in the investigation carried out by Rivera.
    S [19], which proposes to carry out a comprehensive analysis of the sustainability
    of water resources management that includes a variety of perspectives, including
    social, economic, and environmental dimensions. The investigation concluded that
    the extension of the territory where the irrigation system will be implemented
    has a directly proportional relationship with the resources required for its implementation.
    Additionally, another research highlights the benefits of implementing systems
    that help crop production by providing a significant improvement compared to the
    manual process that was previously carried out [20]. SECTION V. Conclusion The
    Internet of Things has allowed the development of a wide variety of projects that
    seek to facilitate the quality of life of people and the interconnection of systems
    and their data with the Internet for access from any location in the world. In
    the present work it was demonstrated that the implementation of a drip irrigation
    system that makes use of the MQTT protocol for the monitoring of the data by the
    farmers, allows a more precise monitoring from anywhere, being able to visualize
    the measurements detected by the sensors. The implemented system makes it possible
    to control the amount of water to be used based on the amount of this resource
    that is available and humidity parameters that indicate that the crops have a
    sufficient volume of water to keep them hydrated and minerals are not lost by
    excessive volume. There is a greater optimization by not requiring to be present
    throughout the process and even without being in the surroundings of the crops,
    since farmers will be able to monitor the state of their crops with the help of
    the developed PWA that indicates the status of the valves. and the level of humidity
    corresponding to the plots, so that the correct distribution of water is observed
    in each of these and without generating waste. Additionally, as a recommendation
    for future work, it is recommended to implement alerts that indicate to farmers
    in case there is insufficient water to adequately conserve crops and any immediate
    action can be taken. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics More Like This

    India SECTION I. Introduction The internet of things (IoT) makes it possible for
    devices to connect to the internet, where sensors and actuators produce, send,
    and receive data as well as make decisions [1]. IoT simply refers to the ability
    to connect everything in our environment. beginning with devices, machines, mobile
    phones, cars, and even cities to be connected to the Internet with intelligent
    behaviour. Recent years have seen a significant expansion and innovation in hardware
    and software, which has reduced the number of human connections to the internet
    relative to the total number of connected devices. Numerous issues with spectrum
    allocation, security, energy use, and quality of service (QoS) have been raised
    by this expansion [2]. A. Spectrum allocation Huge demand on various telecommunication
    technology created the need of managing spectrum resources. Spectrum allocation
    in IoT can be classified as licensed frequency bands as shown in Fig. 1 used by
    cellular operators, and license exempt frequency bands, as shown in Fig. 2, that
    can be used by cellular or non-cellular operators. The spectrum classification
    for each technology defers on each technology and application need as discussed
    below [3]. Zigbee is an example of low power local area networks that are widely
    used, and it is designed to offer Internet connectivity to control low-cost and
    low power devices for short-range wireless communications [3]. LPWAN technologies
    are designed to connect low bandwidth devices with low bitrates over long distances.
    LPWAN on the licensed spectrum can be deployed using two IoT technologies: LTE-M
    and NB-IoT. It can also run on unlicensed spectrum through SIGFOX and Lora [4].
    LORA targets low battery end devices where end-devices do not transmit large data,
    the long-range and low-power nature of Lora is usually used in monitoring applications
    [4]. SIGFOX is a global network characterized by its power efficiency and low
    RF interference, designed to be used in applications where systems need small
    and infrequent bursts of data [5]. LTE-M, a low power wide area technology, enables
    the reuse of the LTE installed base while supporting IoT through reduced device
    complexity and expanded coverage. This allows for a long battery lifetime, with
    the modem costs reduced to 20–25% of the current EGPRS modems [6]. NB-IoT Narrowband-Internet
    of Things (NB-IoT) significantly improves the power consumption of user devices,
    system capacity, and spectrum efficiency, especially in deep coverage [7]. Fig.
    1. licensed frequency bands [3]. Show All Fig. 2. License exempt frequency bands
    [3]. Show All B. Security Security is a critical IoT challenge. Cybersecurity
    attacks are a major risk in all advanced technologies, especially when using applications
    that depend on sensitive data. More security requires more processing power and
    more cost, which makes a trade-off between price and security, use cases with
    payments and metering require a higher level of security. Non-cellular IoT technologies
    are significant cybersecurity risks. While cellular LPWAN technology is ideal
    for sensitive use cases in which critical data is being communicated, offering
    some encryption features. These technologies are more vulnerable to threats related
    to traffic interference and encryption keys, as well as excellent quality of service
    [8]. C. Key performance indicators (KPIs) Latency, throughput, scalability, and
    QoS are different KPIs that vary between the cellular and non-cellular spectrum,
    as shown in Table I. The selection of the technology used depends on the needs
    of each application. TABLE I. Cellular and noncellular operators [3] SECTION II.
    PROBLEM STATEMENT We must increase efforts in water-dependent applications and
    improve water-saving techniques to conserve the already finite water resources
    under various climate change scenarios, as water scarcity is threatening national
    security and is one of the toughest challenges [9]. In order to use water efficiently,
    we must ensure that the amount of water used will produce the greatest amount
    of output. This will help in water conservation issue. a study conducted by Egypt''s
    National Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction
    on various agricultural areas over a 25–40-year period to forecast the growth
    and water requirements of Egypt''s major crops These are the main crops: Wheat:
    If there is an increase in the temperature by 2 °C, wheat productivity will decrease
    by 9%. In comparison to the current weather conditions, this crop will use 6.2%
    more water. The deficit will rise to 18% with a 4 °C rise. Maize: Compared the
    current weather conditions, crop productivity will decrease by 19% by the middle
    of this century if temperature rises by 3.5 °C. 8% more water will be consumed
    as a result. Cotton: As a result of climate change, cotton productivity will rise.
    If the temperature increases by 2 °C, production will increase by 17%. In comparison
    to the current weather conditions, the water consumption of this crop will rise
    by 4.1–5.2%. Production will rise by 31% if the temperature rises by 4 °C. in
    comparison to the current weather conditions, water consumption will increase
    by 10%. Rice production will be 11% less productive than it would be under the
    current situation. There will be a 16% increase in water usage. If the temperature
    increases by 2 °C, tomato productivity will decrease by 14%. compared to the current
    weather conditions, the crop''s water consumption will rise by 4.2–5.7%. If the
    temperature increases by 3.5 °C, the productivity decline will be 51% [10]. SECTION
    III. Literature review A. Irrigation and water management The irrigation system
    shown in Fig. 3 describes the main components of IoT, which include sensors that
    send data to the system based on a Markov solution in normal case and SARSA solution
    in case of any failure in the system, as shown in Fig. 4. The output data of the
    system will be a decision passed to the microcontroller that will update the motor
    state. The model describes IoT water management for efficient rice irrigation
    system that is based on calculating the needed water for the system to take a
    decision by taking into consideration the rainfall and weather condition, to take
    advantage from the rainfall for a better optimization of the water resources [11].

    All The system shown in Fig. 5 checks the moisture of the soil to check if it
    is below the threshold value to irrigate the crops or to notify the farmer in
    case of any issue in the system to take the necessary actions [12]. Fig. 5 irrigation
    chart [12]. Show All B. Livestock tracking The geo-fencing capabilities and GPS
    tracking of the herd are defined by sensors fastened to the livestock collars.
    Several local parameters, including speed, herd body temperature, location, and
    livestock stress levels, are being tracked in real time. It improves the health
    and safety of livestock while reducing inefficiencies and operating costs. As
    long as the right sensors are used and physical and environmental factors are
    taken into account, the system''s high response time yields accurate results and
    a high return on investment when used to manage herds [13]. C. Weather monitoring
    The system monitors the weather through temperature, pressure, rain, and light
    sensors, as shown in Fig. 6 [14]. Applying this system yields the following results:
    Helped in reducing crop hazards. Reduces the farmers working hours. Optimizing
    resources. Increase the quality by getting the optimal time to harvest and sending
    real-time alerts [14]. D. Fertilizer management In the system shown in Fig. 7,
    sensors will use a GSM module to transmit feedback from the farmer to the controller,
    which will use it to determine how long the valves will be opened for. Following
    the entry of these values, the fertilizer will dissolve in the tank''s water.
    A second valve in the field that is attached to the drip irrigation pipes receives
    the signal from the controller after that. Using these drip irrigation pipes,
    the dissolved water in the tank will be automatically irrigated. Applying this
    system yields the following results: It stops the waste of water and fertilizer
    resources in farming. It decreases the water utilization to the yield efficiency
    increments [15]. Fig. 6 weather monitoring system [14]. Show All Fig. 7 fertilizer
    management [15]. Show All SECTION IV. Proposed solution In this section, we will
    discuss our proposed solution and algorithm. The previous work focused on using
    the irrigation system, livestock tracking, weather monitoring, and fertilizer
    management to enhance IoT model and the usage of the resources. In this paper,
    we will focus on the other side of the equation, which is maximizing crop production
    by predicting it using deep learning, and detecting crop deceases through image
    processing and convolutional neural network. To complement the previous work solutions
    to achieve the best results. In our solution, we will illustrate how deep learning
    algorithms can be used to optimize production, and how neural networks can be
    trained to predict the yield of a crop based on past data. A. Crop prediction
    The purpose of this phase is to predict the production of the given input features
    using neural networks through different models and to compare between the results.
    The input features of the neural networks consist of different crop types, humidity
    levels, temperature, and soil components. Major crops discussed in the problem
    statement were included, such as rice, cotton, wheat, and maize. We used different
    computing techniques and compared them with our solution. Techniques being used
    are: Prediction using random forest regressor. Prediction using polynomial regressor.
    Prediction using random XGB regressor. Prediction using adjusted sequential model.
    An input layer x to an output layer y mapping is shown in Fig. 8, which illustrates
    a neural network architecture. The hidden layers are identified as x (j), where
    j determines which ones should be revealed first. The output layer''s structure
    and the inner layers'' dimensions can both be freely chosen because the input
    layer''s dimensionality, x R n, is known. The number of layers and the mapping
    method can both be selected by the user. A good classifier can be built with a
    lot of freedom thanks to this adaptable architecture [16]. Fig. 9 and Fig. 10
    show the results of taking the mean square error and the mean absolute error between
    the output prediction of forest regression, polynomial regressor, and XGB regressor
    with their corresponding real outputs. The model’s accuracy increases as the error
    decreases. Fig. 8. neural networks architecture [16]. Show All Fig. 9 Mean square

    model, hyperparameters shown in Table II must be adjusted, which are: Learning
    rate. Optimizer type Activation functions Number of hidden layers Number of epochs
    Batch size Validation split Results shown in Fig. 11 and Fig. 12 describe the
    effect of training the model through 20 epochs on the mean square error and the
    mean absolute error between the crop prediction and the real output, which makes
    this model far better than the previously discussed models. As shown in Fig. 11,
    after 20 epochs, the neural networks reached a mean square error equal to 3.5.
    Fig. 12 shows the mean absolute error after 20 epochs. The neural networks reached
    a mean absolute error equal to 0.544. Fig. 13 shows that the training set and
    test set follow each other, which means that the model is not overfitting or under
    fitting. TABLE II. Hyperparameters Fig. 11. Mean square error. Show All Fig. 12.

    In this section, we will focus on getting image detection of crop deceases using
    neural networks. Our model is trained to detect the following: Bacterial leaf
    blight Brown spots Leaf smut We applied the adjusted sequential model, using the
    hyperparameters stated in Table III to detect crop deceases. The results in Fig.
    15 and Fig. 16 show that the loss is decreasing while training the neural networks
    and that the prediction accuracy is increasing. The graph in Fig. 15 shows that
    the training set and the test set follow each other, which means that the model
    is not overfitting or under fitting. TABLE III. Hyeperparameters Fig. 15. Loss

    SECTION V. CONCLUSION Previous work focused on the irrigation system and water
    management. In this paper, we focused on crop prediction and crop decease detection.
    In the crop prediction solution, we used a data set that includes different input
    features that directly affect crop production. We compared between several neural
    networks algorithms by implementing them using Python code to minimize the prediction
    loss. By optimizing the sequential model, we achieved a mean absolute error equal
    to 0. 544. In the second part of our work, we focused on real time monitoring
    to detect crop deceases. We implemented an algorithm using convolutional neural
    networks and achieved a mean absolute error equals to 0.75. The integration of
    the IoT system is illustrated in Fig. 17. Fig. 17. IoT system. Show All Authors

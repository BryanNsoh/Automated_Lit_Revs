    Vietnam is the world’s second biggest producer of coffee and has been an exporter
    for several decades. However, Vietnam has been facing many well-documented issues
    and challenges in the whole coffee supply chain such as climate change; low productivity,
    poor quality and high cost; excessive use of fertilizing products and irrigations;
    poor collection, processing and storage solution; low sustainability and limited
    value-added coffee products; and low applications of smart and sustainable agriculture
    solutions. This paper introduces an innovative and smart agriculture (INNSA) platform
    for the creation and operation of a sustainable coffee value chain, with the focus
    on enhanced quality and added values for key elements of the coffee supply chain
    in Vietnam. The platform is designed based on the foundations of the key enabling
    digital transformation and smart agriculture technologies: Smart devices and Internet
    of Things, big data, artificial intelligence, blockchain and source traceability
    technologies, and sustainable design and manufacturing. The INNSA platform has
    the following key features: a smart database with real-time data inputs and updates,
    cost-effectiveness, and open-architectures for effective integrations of the enabling
    digital transformation and smart agriculture technologies. The smart platform
    and ecosystem of INNSA provides the information portal and open-access database
    for all key factors of coffee supply chain, enabling them to join and interact
    with each other to bring the coffee industry of Vietnam to a higher level, well-recognized
    in terms of values, branding and sustainability. Access provided by University

    in Vietnam has developed as the world’s second biggest producer of coffee production
    and export for several decades. However, Vietnam coffee now faces several challenges,
    including the following ones: (1) climate change: the coffee production is heavily
    affected due to tropical storms, the worst droughts, rising temperatures, and
    shifting rainfall patterns. 50% of the current Robusta coffee production areas
    in Vietnam are forecasted to be lost by 2050; (2) low productivity, poor quality
    and high cost: caused by ground-water loss and soil pollution in most of the coffee
    planting regions. About 50% of total coffee trees are between 10 and 15 years
    old. Aging trees, unsuitable lands and no sustainable solution for growing coffee
    plants will directly affect the productivity, quality of Vietnamese coffee products,
    and production costs; (3) excessive use of fertilizing products and irrigations:
    causing coffee trees to quickly become exhausted and soil to be severely polluted,
    with more diseases and harmful pests for coffee trees; (4) poor collection, processing,
    and storage solution: causing low quality and unstable productions; (5) low sustainability
    and limited value-added coffee products: the value-added products and types from
    coffee are limited, and the coffee waste and ground are mainly sent to landfill,
    with no recycling; and (6) low applications of smart and sustainable agriculture
    solutions [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. Regards to the last challenge, there are limited applications
    of smart agriculture solutions to enhance the value streams of the coffee supply
    chain in Vietnam, including IoT, smart devices, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),
    precision agriculture, hi-tech solutions for processing and recycling coffee,
    AI, big data, blockchain and source traceability technologies, eco-design, and
    sustainable manufacturing. Compared to Brazil, the productivity of coffee in Indonesia
    and Vietnam is lower but the number of smallholder coffee farmers is higher. The
    root of the problem is the coffee farming practices in Indonesia and most small-scale
    farms in Vietnam are still based on traditional methods with trial and error.
    Therefore, in order to actually change the way of coffee farming practices in
    Vietnam and Indonesia, the digital transformation and the integration of smart
    and hi-tech agriculture for the coffee supply chain and value chain must be considered,
    and also include the sustainable practices that consist of continuous improvement
    in environmental, social, and financial aspects. Application of the IoT through
    a network of wireless sensors in a coffee farm for monitoring and control of its
    environmental variables have currently been studied [8]. The study showed that
    the management of coffee cultivation is quite complex due to the large number
    of varieties found, the terrain and environmental conditions affecting the production
    process and the final grain quality. Also, the development and implementation
    of wireless sensor networks is possible today due to factors such as the reduction
    of device costs and the use of open-source software, avoiding additional licensing
    values. One of the main problems with coffee plants is, however, that high humidity
    can, in fact, impact the activity of the sensors and their monitoring tools. There
    are numerous limitations when harvesting and production processes are optimized.
    Vietnam has a great potential to encourage investment in agriculture. The proliferation
    of new technologies has enabled the enhancement and automation of industrial processes
    in all fields of production such as coffee. Therefore, aided by technology, an
    agricultural sector such as coffee production can strongly improve the country’s
    productivity and give enormous benefits for production processes and the optimization
    of final products [9, 10]. Precision agriculture includes many activities such
    as the management of trees, flowers, crops, and plants. Pest and disease management
    is one of its most interesting applications. By the suitable use of sensors, parameters
    (such as soil temperature and relative humidity, leaf temperature and humidity,
    and solar radiation) can also be measured to quickly detect adverse and appropriate
    situations. In addition, this technology can help to manage the time-based detection
    and the efficiently space-based use of pesticides [2]. Hi-tech solutions for processing
    and recycling coffee have some great benefits and add significant values to the
    coffee value chain. For example, not only does it divert waste away from landfill,
    but the spent coffee grounds can be used to produce some value-added things like
    biofuels, bioactives, and anticancer drugs. It can also help businesses save money
    on their waste disposal [11, 12]. In this paper, the innovative and smart agriculture
    platform for the creation and operation of sustainable coffee value chain, with
    the focus on enhanced quality and added values for key elements of the coffee
    supply chain in Vietnam, taking into account the issues related to sustainability,
    well-aligned with United Nations Sustainable Goals. The platform is designed based
    on the foundations of the key enabling digital transformation and smart agriculture
    technologies: smart devices and Internet of Things, big data, artificial intelligence,
    blockchain and source traceability technologies, and sustainable design and manufacturing.
    2 Development of an Innovative and Smart Agriculture Platform Figure 1 presents
    the research method for development of an innovative and smart agriculture platform,
    called the INNSA platform, with the highlights of the key steps and tools. Firstly,
    the data types and sources are very important for development of the smart agriculture
    systems, in which the real-time data collection and analysis needs to be optimally
    implemented. Then, the latest development of the digital transformation technologies
    needs to be taken into account, when working on data collections and analysis,
    and development of the smart platform and ecosystem of INNSA, including smart
    devices and Internet of Things, big data, artificial intelligence, blockchain
    and source traceability technologies, and sustainable design and manufacturing.
    Finally, value-added products and services in the value chain of the INNSA platform
    and its related ecosystems are developed, with the focus on the cost-effective
    and innovative solutions, including the hardware, software, smart devices, e-commerce
    platform, and innovative products from coffee trees, beans, and wastes. Fig. 1
    Research methods for development of the INNSA platform Full size image 2.1 Data
    Type, Sources, and Collections for Development the INNSA Platform A critical analysis
    and industrial investigations were done, with the use of both primary and secondary
    data, including the journal article data, open-source data about agriculture,
    and farming industry from both governmental and industry reports. The primary
    data from surveys, interviews, and sensor-based supply chain operations was also
    collected for value chain mapping, developing, and validating the INNSA platform.
    The data sources included farm soils, environmental conditions, farm types, products
    from coffee farms and food wastes, and key stakeholders in the coffee supply chain
    and value chain. They also included the information about currently used agriculture
    technologies (robots, temperature and moisture sensors, aerial images, IoT, and
    GPS) and products such as fertilizer for growing plants and precision agriculture.
    The data architecture of the smart database was designed with capability of continuous
    update and co-creation, and automatic updates from smart devices and IoT, with
    options for the IP right licenses and open access. To maximize productivity of
    a coffee farm, certain factors related to soil, weather, and environmental conditions
    must be met. The INNSA platform was designed to collect and analyze farm soil,
    weather, and ecosystem factors, focusing on high-yield variables of coffee plants.
    Based on real-time data monitored and obtained, our platform produced reports
    and suggestions of the best agricultural practices which the users can follow
    to approach the highest productivity. This is based on agronomical science and
    farmers’ experience knowledge to produce these reports and suggestions exactly
    and rapidly. Besides, the INNSA platform also guided the users with farming practices
    to explore their resources in an efficient and effective manner. A sustainable
    concept was developed based on cost-effective and time-saving plans to bring to
    precise agricultural practices. To set up the INNSA platform, two main components
    were designed: IoT devices using LoRa waves [13] and AI [7, 9]. In particular,
    the LoRa plays the role of continuously collecting data such as pH, oxidation
    reduction potential (ORP), electrical conductivity (EC), water temperature, air
    temperature, humidity, light intensity, and NPK. The AI is at the heart of the
    INNSA platform because it provides even more value to the IoT devices and enables
    the platform to comprehend the data it collected by IoT devices. In addition,
    with the use of AI, it also provides the ability to analyze market information,
    such as history coffee prices, to provide reports and predictive analysis for
    suppliers to adjust export plans. Besides, with deep learning-based technology,
    AI recognizes the images via camera to output advice about cultivation, harvest,
    pest, and disease prevention, etc. The data collected was sent back to the computer
    database for processing. This platform provides real-time information about the
    cultivating regions. Last but not least, that information, after being stored,
    analyzed in real time, and fed into the traceability system, helps increase transparency
    about the origin of the product, thereby adding the value of the product. 2.2
    Data Analysis and Collections for the INNSA Platform Big data collected by the
    INNSA platform was used to provide predictive insights in farming operations,
    drive real-time operational decisions, and redesign business processes for game-changing
    business models related to the coffee supply chain and value chain. Based on the
    quality assessment in the coffee supply chain and value chain, a standard quality
    certification for domestic use and export was developed to apply for the INNSA
    platform. In order to make the system smarter to make food production efficiently,
    machine learning algorithms (e.g., neural network, random forest, support vector
    machine, etc.) were used to build the big data analytic models. Firstly, powered
    by AI, the INNSA platform is capable of analyzing the collected data to make assessments
    and suggestions for farmers to make decisions of fertilizing products and irrigations.
    For example, based on weather data, humidity, temperature, and plant care regime
    for each time period, AI can suggest when to water, how much water, and what fertilizer
    according to the growth and development of the coffee tree over time. This helps
    reduce costs and increase coffee production. Besides, with the use of AI to analyze
    and diagnose pests based on images of leaves of coffee trees collected from surveillance
    cameras, the platform can automatically and early detect pests, thereby helping
    farmers not only choosing treatment solutions but also reducing costs when pests
    and diseases have not been spread on a large area. In addition, the IoT system
    combined with an automatically controlled irrigation and care system also helps
    to reduce material and labor costs. Secondly, the AI-based advanced analytics
    of the platform is also used to improve the efficiency of coffee storage, processing,
    and exporting operations. With the use of IoT devices in monitoring, the warehouse
    environment, coffee beans quality monitoring cameras, AI-powered advanced analysis
    INNSA platform uses collected IoT''s data to evaluate, guide, and decision support
    for managers. Moreover, the platform also provides predictive insights such as
    coffee quantity and quality based on coffee growing areas, predicts coffee price
    in the future, and forecasts the demand of the market. That information is analyzed
    and aggregated into final reports to assist suppliers in finding partners and
    estimating the volume of products to sign export contracts in accordance with
    their ability. Additionally, due to the digitization of coffee product related
    information, the INNSA platform is designed to be used not only as a coffee information
    portal but also as an advanced analysis portal of coffee beans quantity and quality
    of each region, each coffee growing area in Vietnam. Thereby helping the coffee
    industry of Vietnam to a higher level, well-recognized in terms of values, branding,
    and sustainability. Finally, the platform was developed based on cost-effective
    equipment and open-source software. This allows easy scaling and system development
    for responding to the actual needs of agriculture in the future. Blockchain-based
    supply chain traceability systems were developed by using radio frequency identification
    (RFID), a non-contact automatic identification communication technology [6] to
    trace products with trusted information in the entire supply chain, and by linking
    with IoT devices and integrating into the INNSA platform to provide digital data
    of production and consumption [5]. A sensor network system consisting of IoT devices
    and application programming interface (API) programmed by NodeJS and deployed
    in the server running Linux operating system (OS) were used to collect data [13].
    Data transmission sensor used a communication protocol type MQTT [14]. By using
    this protocol, the microcontroller and computers or mobile apps were communicated
    wirelessly. Data collection block diagram, including array sensors, connected
    to IoT sensor network, API, cloud, local database, visual modeling, and computation.
    The sensor data from the microcontroller was sent to the LoRaWAN gateway, thus
    the data could be sent to the cloud and stored in a local database. Sensor data
    stored on a local database was used for real-time visualization. To perform computational
    modeling, sensor data was accessed on a local database. 2.3 The Proposed Models
    for the INNSA Platform A solution architecture of the INNSA platform is designed
    as shown in Fig. 2, taking into account the following points: (1) critical investigation
    and reviews of the coffee supply chain and value chain in Vietnam; (2) innovative
    and cost-effective development of the platform with the smart database; (3) construction
    of big data for the platform, the real-world data inputs for a smart database;
    (4) innovative and cost-effective developments of value-added products and services
    in the value chain of the INNSA platform and ecosystems; and (5) systematic integration,
    evaluation, and analysis of the developed platform and products within the ecosystems.
    Fig. 2 Proposed models of the INNSA platform Full size image First of all, the
    data was collected from users, video/PDF files, and IoT systems, to store it in
    a database, called Data Lake. From Data Lake, data was analyzed on demand to create
    business intelligence software, called BI tools. Then, a portal was developed
    to connect and integrate websites and visitors. Mobile applications were also
    created to control IoT devices and recommend farming care procedures. Finally,
    AI and machine learning technologies were used to design, optimize, and predict
    models, from which results are generated via an API gateway. 2.4 A General Workflow
    of the INNSA Platform A general workflow of the INNSA platform was shown in Fig.
    3. In the first step, a critical investigation and reviews of the coffee supply
    chain and coffee value chain in Vietnam is performed on the whole supply chain,
    including production, collection, processing, commerce—import and export, and
    consumption, with the focus on (1) identification of the key factors and stakeholders
    in the coffee supply chain and coffee value chain in Vietnam, and (2) strength,
    weakness, opportunity, and threat (SWOT) analysis. Fig. 3 General workflow of
    the INNSA platform Full size image Based on the critical investigation and reviews
    from the first step, the INNSA platform is designed in the second step, with the
    focus on supply chain traceability systems, as well as management systems. The
    supply chain traceability system is presented in Fig. 4 with a detailed description.
    The management systems have key functions such as farm production area management,
    plant information management system (PIMS), supplier information management system
    (SIMS), and customer and partner relationship management (CRM and PRM). Besides,
    E-commerce systems (web and mobile applications), IoT devices using LoRa waves,
    and API Gateway systems integrated with blockchain and AI are also developed.
    Fig. 4 Detailed workflow of the supply chain traceability system within the INNSA
    platform Full size image In the third step, the construction of big data for the
    INNSA platform is successfully designed and developed. The INNSA platform with
    the designed smart database needs the real-world data inputs, especially the ones
    that can be directly used for smart farming’s applications: farm soils and environmental
    conditions (moisture levels and weather in different times of the year), as well
    as the latest information about the crops and market trends from all connected
    sources. Big data collected by the INNSA platform are being developed to provide
    predictive insights in farming operations, drive real-time operational decisions,
    and redesign business processes for game-changing business models related to the
    coffee supply chain and coffee value chain in Vietnam. We seek and contract reputable
    partners in Vietnam and abroad to provide high quality input supply for coffee
    production as well as products and equipment for each key stakeholder. Information
    of these partners is added to the information portal systems. In addition, the
    platform also provides a quality assessment function of these partners. Based
    on this assessment, the platform will give priority to introducing reputable and
    quality partners to participate in the coffee supply chain and value chain. Based
    on the quality assessment in the coffee supply chain and value chain, a standard
    quality certification for domestic use and export such as UTZ and C4 assessment
    will be developed to apply for the platform. In the fourth step, innovative and
    cost-effective developments of value-added products and services in the coffee
    value chain are added to the INNSA platform and its ecosystems, including: (1)
    products made from coffee beans and wastes, (2) products for sustainable and precision
    agriculture: microbial organic fertilizer for coffee plants; (3) smart devices
    and IoT solutions for continuous and automatic updates of data and information
    to construct big data for the INNSA platform; and (4) E-commerce and commercialization
    of coffee beans and coffee products, with the support of AI, blockchain and supply
    chain traceability technologies. Finally, systematic integration, evaluation,
    and analysis of the developed INNSA platform and products within the INNSA ecosystems
    are designed and implemented. All products, modules, and data resulting from the
    third and fourth steps are integrated into the INNSA platform developed in the
    second step for evaluation and analysis, and related risk and security assessment,
    quality control, and management issues. The evaluation and analysis are based
    on the real-world business models and data, at the laboratory scale first, and
    then in coffee farms and coffee storage spaces. A farm of 500 m2 of White Lion
    JSC (Iced Coffee) in Mdrak district, Daklak province, Vietnam was used for demonstration,
    analysis, and evaluation, with the focus on how the system collect and process
    data to support smart farming, harvest and post-harvest processing, storage, source
    traceability, commercialization, as well as related issues in the coffee supply
    chain and value chain. Finally, the principles of LEAN Industry 4.0 and Sustainable
    Developments [16] are introduced and applied in management and operations of the
    INNSA platform, as well as when developing value-added products and services in
    the value chain of the INNSA platform and its related ecosystems, including the
    hardware, software, smart devices, e-commerce platform, and innovative products
    from coffee trees, beans, and wastes. For future works, the INNSA platform can
    be applied to other agricultural supply chains such as marine culture and shrimp
    farming for a sustainable aquaculture [17, 18]. 3 Summary and Conclusions Under
    the impacts of Industry 4.0 and UN’s sustainable development goals, it is necessary
    to develop an innovative and smart agriculture platform that can be effectively
    used for the creation and operation of a sustainable coffee value chain, to enhance
    the quality and create added values for key elements of the coffee supply chain.
    In this paper, the INNSA platform is introduced, to provide the information portal
    and open-access database for all key factors of coffee supply chain, enabling
    them to join and interact with each other effectively and systematically, with
    the focus on the case of the coffee industry of Vietnam, aimed at enhancement
    of the values, branding and sustainability of the coffee value chain and supply
    chain in Vietnam. The platform is designed based on the foundations of the key
    enabling digital transformation and smart agriculture technologies, with the following
    key features: A smart database with real-time data inputs and updates, cost-effectiveness,
    and open-architectures for effective integrations of the enabling digital transformation
    and smart agriculture technologies. The successful development of the INNSA platform
    will potentially create the significance and impacts in the coffee supply chain,
    and to directly contribute to the United Nations Sustainable Goals. It also directly
    contributes to Vietnam''s Smart Agriculture and Industry 4.0, successful development,
    and applications of the key enabling technologies of digital transformation and
    smart agriculture, including the following ones: smart devices and IoT, big data,
    AI, blockchain and source traceability technologies, and sustainable design and
    manufacturing. It is expected that, for the first time in Vietnam, there is the
    smart platform and ecosystem as the information portal and open-access database
    for farmers, traders, processing companies, import and export companies, retail
    shops, and coffee users, can join to obtain and share information, as well as
    to commercialize coffee products, to specifically meet their needs in both the
    coffee supply chain and coffee value chain. References Abideen, A. Z., Sundram,

    Highlights • Reviews over than two hundred papers, that provide a contribution
    to knowledge by establishing the linkages between new 4.0 trends in technologies
    and Agri-Food Supply Chain Challenges. • A compressive state of the art of Agri-Food
    4.0 related technologies is covered. • Reviews and contributes on the digital
    technologies to the new supply chain methods in Agri-Food. • Links to the agri-food
    supply chain challenges. • Presents new trends and models in agri-food supply
    chains. Abstract The term “Agri-Food 4.0” is an analogy to the term "Industry
    4.0", coming from the concept “agriculture 4.0”. Since the origins of the industrial
    revolution, where the steam engines started the concept of Industry 1.0 and later
    the use of electricity upgraded the concept to Industry 2.0, the use of technologies
    generated a milestone in the industry revolution by addressing the Industry 3.0
    concept. Hence, Industry 4.0, it is about including and integrating the latest
    developments based on digital technologies as well as the interoperability process
    across them. This allows enterprises to transmit real-time information in terms
    behaviour and performance. Therefore, the challenge is to maintain these complex
    networked structures efficiently linked and organised within the use of such technologies,
    especially to identify and satisfy supply chain stakeholders dynamic requirements.
    In this context, the agriculture domain is not an exception although it possesses
    some specialities depending from the domain. In fact, all agricultural machinery
    incorporates electronic controls and has entered to the digital age, enhancing
    their current performance. In addition, electronics, using sensors and drones,
    support the data collection of several agriculture key aspects, such as weather,
    geographical spatialization, animals and crops behaviours, as well as the entire
    farm life cycle. However, the use of the right methods and methodologies for enhancing
    agriculture supply chains performance is still a challenge, thus the concept of
    Industry 4.0 has evolved and adapted to agriculture 4.0 in order analyse the behaviours
    and performance in this specific domain. Thus, the question mark on how agriculture
    4.0 support a better supply chain decision-making process, or how can help to
    save time to farmer to make effective decision based on objective data, remains
    open. Therefore, in this survey, a review of more than hundred papers on new technologies
    and the new available supply chains methods are analysed and contrasted to understand
    the future paths of the Agri-Food domain. Previous article in issue Next article

    to support rural employment and to make a considerable contribution to territorial
    development. Even though they have always been considered a cornerstone of agricultural
    activity in the European Union (EU), this sector most often suffers from very
    low efficiency and effectiveness, sensitivity to weather, market disruptions and
    other external factors, such as poor agriculture supply chain stakeholders’ linkages
    and communication, especially at the food processing level. In fact, and as stablished
    by the FAO,1 under an approach from “field to fork” the agriculture supply chain
    structures can also be named Agri-Food supply chains, where main events coming
    from the agricultural production of food to the food processing events, including
    trading, are linked. Across this Agri-Food Supply Chain, in most of the cases,
    the transferred agriculture knowledge, from generation to generation, is paramount
    from a cultural point of view, but most of the time, it does not answer to the
    needs nor the requirements of the Agri-Food Supply Chains. Furthermore, such delineation
    does not exist also between farms as economic units and farmers who are producing
    food, mostly, for their own consumption. However, no formal delineation to what
    is a “small” and/or a “large” farm formally exists that is holistically accepted,
    it depends on several factors, such as countries, regions, politics, strategies,
    market shares amongst many others. Nonetheless, there are two criteria to classify
    farm size: standard output (in economic terms) and utilised agricultural area
    (UAA), as alternative measure2 . In this same line, Eurostat3 predicts that, by
    2026, an increment of 4%–6% in agriculture cost savings, as well as an increment
    of 3 % in market value, will be regarded to the use and development of smart agriculture.
    Hence, “Agriculture 4.0″ emerges to provide advanced technologies to the famers
    in order to meet agri-food production challenges, hence, to achieve more affordable
    prices for open market and the minimum cost for farmers. Thus, the expectation
    for the further coming years, is that Agri-Food 4.0 should help meeting sustainable
    challenges by increasing the agri-food supply chain stakeholders revenues as well
    as decreasing their pressure for handling complex and external factors they cannot
    control, such as weather, market behaviours and policies, but also to react on
    time by visualising current trends in needs. This paper focus principally on the
    factory farm model issued from the European and north American style. In those
    typologies of farms the Industry 4.0 elements can be introduced and merged with
    the agricultural domain to create the Agri-Food 4.0. The focus is more specialised
    on the industrial farming although the Agri-Food 4.0 is started to be adapted
    also to the organic and silvo-pasture paradigms. Thus, this paper, considering
    a review over than two hundred papers, provides a contribution to knowledge by
    establishing the linkages between new 4.0 trends in technologies and Agri-Food
    Supply Chain Challenges, which opens the 4.0 research field for a multidisciplinary
    work. The choice of the literature review methodology focused firstly on key words
    related to the Agri-food technology, then the second approach was to focus on
    selected journals and at the end we looked for the data-based repository and the
    linked publications. To accomplish this, the structure in this paper is as follows:
    in the first place, a compressive state of the art of Agri-Food 4.0 related technologies
    is covered. In the second place, a review and contribution coming from digital
    technologies to the new supply chain methods in Agri-Food shows linkages with
    next trends and technologies. Next, and linked to the agri-food supply chain challenges,
    the fourth section presents new trends and models in agri-food supply chains,
    especially in the domain of risk management, collaboration, governance, cold chain
    management, globalization, information and communication technologies, Logistics,
    supply chain structures and sustainable agri-food supply chains. Finally, the
    fifth section covers the main conclusions, visions and perspectives for this novel
    research. 2. Agri-food 4.0 and technologies state-of-the-art The agricultural
    sector has been active in digital innovation for decades already. Especially the
    advances in Precision Agriculture, remote sensing, robots, farm management information
    systems, and (agronomic) decision support systems have paved the way for a broad
    digital transformation in farming and food (Pedro and Gonzalez-Andujar, 2019).
    Recent developments, such as Cloud Computing, Internet of Things, Big Data, Blockchain,
    Robotics and Artificial Intelligence, allow for the integration of so far isolated
    lines of development into smart, connected systems of systems. Those technologies
    will let the agriculture to evolve in a data-driven, intelligent, agile and autonomous
    connected system of systems. The operations of each agricultural process will
    be automatically integrated in the food chain through the semantically active
    technologies up to the end consumer. The 4th industrial revolution is now reaching
    agriculture. The digital platform (DP) concept emerged as an integration of heterogeneous
    mainly open software solutions for ecosystem building (Yablonsky, 2018). The EU
    promote the creation of digital platforms for several application domains as manufacturing
    (i.e. FoF 11 – 2016 projects, DT-ICT-07-2018-2019, etc.), construction (BIM + calls),
    etc. As a concentration of technology enablers, research on DP covers several
    issues such as software engineering (Guertin and Van Benthem, 2016; Wang et al.,
    2006), process simulation and development (Zhao and Yao, 2016; Hu et al., 2016),
    features analysis (Wang et al., 2014), resource performance (Mocnej et al., 2018),
    test algorithms (Santiago et al., 2017) or performance control (Sahota et al.,
    2011). The technological platforms allow access to the different stakeholders
    and provide deployment capabilities for IT solutions. These solutions are exposed
    by service providers or developed by software engineers. Agricultural Data management
    and exploitation is the central node between digital transformation capabilities
    and the agriculture concerns. The main research issues concern the consolidation
    of data repositories with open data (Gumaste and Kadam, 2016) (weather, maps,
    etc.), governance data (policies, local regulation, etc.) and domain specific
    data from end users. Data typology is very rich (land, location, energy, climate,
    climate impact, etc.) and data volume is continually increasing by the integration
    of sensors and IoT platforms in agriculture (Amandeep et al., 2017; Biradar and
    Shabadi, 2017). Data engineering effort covers pattern definition (Laube et al.,
    2011; Spekken et al., 2016), classification algorithms (Narvaez et al., 2018;
    Shi et al., 2015; Yalcin and Razavi, 2016), correlation analysis (Nilsson et al.,
    2016; Xavier et al., 2018; Xie et al., 2017), etc. All those technologies provide
    engineering capabilities for agricultural data. The implementation of these techniques
    will handle farmers data, will integrate new data repositories from external providers,
    will transform data to knowledge and feed decision support systems. The data transparency
    enabler with necessary sharing policies will accelerate data ingestion and ejection
    processes. 2.1. Big data technologies Research activities in Big Data provide
    relevant results in several application domains (healthcare, marketing, maritime,
    urban, manufacturing, etc.). The Big Data Value Association (BDVA)4 promote the
    application of bigdata in different domains (Belaud et al., 2019). The Big Data
    Grapes EU project5 provides data semantic, analytics, integration and exploitation
    solutions as well as a software stack for grapes agriculture. As additional ongoing
    research issues, we identified tools and technology development (Devarakonda et
    al., 2014; Hashem and Ranc, 2016), analytic methods and services (Malhotra et
    al., 2017; Deka and Walczak, 2017), clustering methods (Balan et al., 2015), transformation
    algorithms (Penar and Wilczek, 2016; Hashem and Ranc, 2016) performance and data
    processing technics (Wu and Zhao, 2009), data source and storage management (Cha
    et al., 2018; RubyDinakar and Vagdevi, 2017), etc. The integration of Big Data
    technologies in Agri-Food projects plays an important role in: the extension of
    farmers data to create new knowledge; the creation of innovative services and
    processes by IT providers and software developers as well as the extension and
    the adaptation of ICT and Factories of the Future (FoF)6 related Big Data models
    and patterns for agriculture. There are several Big Data Repositories that guarantee,
    nowadays, the access and the exploitation to Agri-Food data. As example: the “National
    Climatic Data Centre” (about 2,9 Go per day); Satellite Imagery and metrological
    information from Google and the NASA Earth Exchange; Soil, water and geospatial
    data from the National Resources Conservation Service (US); the OpenCorporates
    as the world’s largest open repository of companies (165 million companies around
    the word); etc. 2.2. Internet of things technologies The integration of IoT platforms
    in agriculture provides additional data sources describing agricultural features
    (water, soil, humans, animals, etc.) with more data. The recent research issues
    on IoT highlight the multiplication of IoT platforms. This expansion generates
    new implementation frameworks (Lee et al., 2018; Choi et al., 2018) answering
    to different requirement models, new networks of heterogeneous components and
    sensors with different monitoring models (Pflanz et al., 2018; Vergara et al.,
    2017; Prathibha et al., 2017), time processing scheme and misbalanced energy consumption
    (Ruano et al., 2018; Jarolimek et al., 2016). The integration of the IoT platforms
    with the agricultural issues could add additional research challenges, specifically
    when the data are stocked or used in the cloud, in terms of interoperability (Panetto,
    2007; Mocnej et al., 2018; Zarko et al., 2017; Hefnawy et al., 2017; Martinez
    et al., 2016; Leal et al., 2019; Panetto et al., 2016) (protocols, security, etc.),
    performance monitoring (Paulraj et al., 2018; Mekala and Viswanathan, 2017), etc.
    In addition, IoT serves Robotics (Murar and Brad, 2015) and Automated Guided Vehicles
    (AGV) (Sanchez-Hermosilla et al., 2013). An interesting activity might be the
    benchmarking of all the existing IoT platforms and their proposed functionalities
    and mapping them with Agri-Food stakeholders’ requirements. The integration of
    IoT capabilities will support farmers in the harvesting of new data sources to
    create new valuable services. 2.3. Knowledge model approaches The development
    of valuable knowledge models in agriculture aims to transform shared multi-sources
    data repositories to create profitable services and support the decision making
    for different stakeholders. Recent research topics address precise data collection
    and engineering to serve knowledge creation of new farming models (Abdullah et
    al., 2017; Irmak et al., 2006), technology application in farming (Chen and Jin,
    2011; Gerhards et al., 2012; Singh et al., 2013), resource allocation (Garcia
    et al., 2005; Jang et al., 2017; Musacchio and Grant, 2002), assessment frameworks
    (for risk, policies definition and quality management) (Jacxsens et al., 2016;
    Louwagie et al., 2012) as well as the qualification of decision models (Costanzo
    and Faro, 2012; Dragincic et al., 2015) and the identification of decision parameters
    (region, land, climate, plant, time, process, etc.). 2.4. Artificial intelligence
    techniques Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques propose important contributions
    to knowledge model’s identification, service creation and the decision-making
    processes as support for the different Agri-Food’s applications (Solemane et al.,
    2019). AI offers formal general algorithms for prediction (Bhatt and Buch, 2015;
    Soh et al., 2018), accuracy and performance evaluation (Jeon et al., 2017) as
    well as pattern classification (Ott et al., 2003; Pinho et al., 2011; Starr, 2005)
    that might solve knowledge issues in the agricultural domain such as the pest’s
    identifications and the correct treating methods. In addition, AI supports applications
    in farming technics development: land allocation regarding the targeted activity
    (Pokhrel et al., 2018), irrigation process analysis and control (Ait-Mouheb et
    al., 2018; Mohanraj et al., 2017), robot guidance (Tian et al., 2018; Roshanianfard
    et al., 2018; Sheridan, 2016), etc. 2.5. Smart agriculture Smart agriculture emerges
    as a main concept in Agri-Food 4.0. By integrating new technology enablers propelled
    by the Industry 4.0 paradigm (Annosi et al., 2019), smart agriculture addresses
    important farming objectives as water saving (O’Connor and Mehta, 2016), soil
    conservation (Li et al., 2002), limit carbon emission (Ochoa et al., 2014) and
    productivity increasing (Mayer et al., 2015) by doing more with less. The new
    agricultural age aims to harmonize and share better local European policies and
    rules to scale the best farming practices and applications. Smart agriculture
    offers the opportunity to farmers, technology and service providers, governance
    agencies and other impacted stakeholders (financial organization, investors, traders,
    etc.) to share their experiences and preoccupations in the optimization in the
    farming Supply Chain with the close respect of production sustainability (Swisher
    et al., 2018; Oberholster et al., 2015). 2.6. Precision farming techniques and
    robot development The Precision Farming topic is already covered by other H2020
    calls (SFS-05-2017, SFS-06-2018-2020, SFS-08-2018-2019, etc.). The analysis of
    released projects outcomes and related research issues allows to identify new
    technologies, processes and applications in agriculture. Relevant models are proposed
    for land, grain and arable related activities (Gumma et al., 2016). Relevant listed
    results cover harvesting distribution accuracy (Roshanianfard et al., 2018; Kamata
    et al., 2018; Alzahrani, 2018), cost development (Pomar et al., 2010) and distribution
    optimization (Zhou et al., 2018; Tabatabaie et al., 2013; Ruiz-Garcia et al.,
    2010; Eisele et al., 2001). Within the Agri-Food projects is planned to reuse
    available precision farming technologies and results to improve the quality of
    targeted farmers’ processes and applications. Results in the integration of robots
    in agriculture are well mature and already proposed by Agri-Food stakeholders.
    With precision farming enablers, it will be ensured the performance of impacted
    farming processes. Agriculture Robots are already investigated in the precision
    farming topic. Recent research in this area covers the adaptability of robot design
    to the agriculture sector, the improvement of navigation conditions through additional
    sensing (Liu et al., 2018; Tao et al., 2017; Jhonattan et al., 2019) and localization
    capabilities as well as real-time image processing (Xu et al., 2017; Pilli et
    al., 2015) and camera detection (Dworak et al., 2013) to maximize the operational
    capabilities and behaviour of robots and collaborative robots (cobots). Robots
    can assist humans (Chilcanan et al., 2017; Dondeynaz et al., 2013) for difficult
    tasks or replace them for difficult ones. The cost reduction (Pomar et al., 2010)
    effectiveness is demonstrated and research in decision error reduction (Montecinos
    et al., 2018; Shin and Ko, 2017; Brigido et al., 2015) is intensive to improve
    accuracy by simulation (Xu et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018; Latorre-Biel et al.,
    2018) and by more precise path finding (Spekken et al., 2016; Nolan et al., 2017)
    and guidance algorithms (Kviz et al., 2014; Baio, 2012). The new Agri-Food projects
    fund the integration of Agriculture Robots to support the applications since the
    beginning to ensure the maximum results. Building resilient and sustainable farming
    system is the ultimate concept behind Agriculture 4.0. Recent research in this
    topic covers farming processes sustainability analysis (McGuire and Sperling,
    2013; Joly, 2005), farming activity calibration (Suryoputro et al., 2017; Hosseini
    et al., 2014; do Nascimento et al., 2012) (rotation cycles, control of accuracy),
    the development of conservation protocols (Kladivko et al., 2014; Gaspary et al.,
    2002) and the alignment of business development strategies. 3. How the new digital
    technology transforms the agri-food supply chains To achieve robust, resilient
    and sustainable agri-food supply chains is very complex because they face more
    sources of uncertainty and risks in comparison with other supply chains that give
    rise to serious questions and concerns about their economic, environmental and
    social performance. Several studies identify agricultural sources of uncertainty
    (Mundi et al., 2019; Esteso et al., 2017; Esteso et al., 2018) and how to model
    them (Grillo et al., 2019). In Esteso et al. (2018) four types of crop-based uncertainty
    are identified: Product (shelf-life, deterioration rate, lack of homogeneity,
    food quality and food safety), Process (harvesting yield, supply lead time, resource
    needs, production), Market (demand, market prices) and Environment (weather, pests
    & diseases and regulations). Poor management of these sources of uncertainty can
    have a very negative impact on safety, quality, quantity and waste of products
    as well as human, technological and natural resources. Indeed, the agri-food sector
    is one of the economic and political areas worldwide, with key implications in
    sustainability to cover not only the food needs of the population, contribute
    to their employability and economic growth, but also in the impact on the natural
    environment (Iakovou et al., 2014). Therefore, the agri-food supply chains are
    strongly pressured to manage these sources of uncertainty and risks whose precise
    evolution over time is unknown but may jeopardize the future sustainability of
    these type of supply chains. It is necessary to move away from “business as usual”
    developing new solutions and implement innovative technologies (FAO, 2018). Along
    these lines, a digitalized supply chain, allows companies to monitor material
    flows in real time making potential risks visible and develop future plans to
    face them. The main drivers for the digitalization of the processes of SC are
    usually the increase of the flexibility and the speed of reaction of the industrial/logistical
    systems (ten Hompel and Henke, 2017a, ten Hompel and Henke, 2017b) as well as
    the improvement of agri-food supply chain robustness and resilience. In this context,
    data becomes crucial. Data is the lifeblood of any business and the agricultural
    business is not an exception but rather a referent. The new technologies have
    a great impact on the reduction of uncertainty since they allow obtaining precise
    data in real time, whose treatment, together with the capacities of autonomous
    and intelligent decision making will help to increase the efficiency, sustainability,
    flexibility, agility, and the resilience along the whole supply chain from the
    farmers to the final customers. In the context of data-driven supply chains, the
    new technologies listed in the previous section, provide different and complementary
    support to the sequence of activities from data chain (Wolfert et al., 2017):
    data capture, storage, transfer, transformation, analytics and marketing. The
    support of each technology to different data chain activities lets envisage that
    the true potential of the data comes from the combination and integration of these
    technologies. Indeed, each one will improve some of the following basic functions
    of agri-food supply chains: sensing, monitoring, control, analysis (descriptive
    capabilities), prediction (predictive capabilities), decision-making (prescriptive
    capabilities) and adaptive learning. Through the sensing, monitoring, control
    and analysis it is possible to the early and accurate detection of problems and
    even predicting them before occurring, making better decisions and learn of them
    improving the sustainability and resilience of agri-food supply chains. In fact,
    the integration of previous technologies allows a more intelligent management
    of the agri-food supply chains, being able to combine multiple models of independent
    data analysis, repositories of historical data and data flows in real time. Real-time
    information and data processing tools provide new opportunities for companies
    to react more quickly to changing conditions in the supply chain. Due to this
    integrated intelligence, the agri-food supply chain management goes from supporting
    decisions to delegating them and, ultimately, to predicting which decisions should
    be taken. From all the above, there is no doubt that these new technologies are
    transforming the way agricultural sector organize and make decisions. In order
    to provide a general overview about how the new digital technology transforms
    the agri-food supply chains, the tables (Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, Table 4) integrate
    and classify the main positive impacts of the most relevant technologies as well
    as the challenges to be faced according to recent studies in the field carried

    security concerns that need to be addressed before the general public will entrust
    their personal data to a blockchain solution. • Throughput and latency issue:
    in the context of agri-food Supply Chain management, due to the original restriction
    of block size and the time interval used to generate a new block, the current
    processing capacity of blockchain cannot fulfil the requirements of processing
    millions of transactions in real-time • Infrastructure and capacity development

    further facilitate additional developments on visualization • AI algorithms designed
    for single-machine environments might have emergent subproblem structures useful
    for parallelization. • Adding speech interface to the system may be proved to
    be more beneficial for the farmers of the remote area • Expert systems will not
    be able to give the creative responses that human experts can give in unusual
    circumstances. • Lack of flexibility and ability to adapt to changing environments.
    • Not being able to recognize when no answer is available. • Knowledge acquisition
    remains the major bottleneck in applying expert system technology to new domains.
    • Maintenance and extension of a rule base can be difficult for a relatively large
    rule base • Enhance IoT with machine learning techniques to analyse data captured
    by sensors in real time in agriculture. As it can be seen in the above tables,
    some challenges of these digital technologies appear as strengths of others. This
    allows intuiting the suitability of using them as complements with the others.
    Indeed, in the near future, the full potential of data will rely on the combination
    of the different technologies that enhance data-driven agri-food supply chains
    more informed, efficient, secure, sustainable and resilient. For instance, IoT
    and BDA can benefit from blockchain providing data security, anonymity, trust
    and decentralization. Since blockchain exchange information in a distributed network,
    novel IoT applications will be developed for distributed environments. On the
    other side, the valuable data generated from the IoT could enrich transaction
    details that are registered on the blockchain (Tripoli and Schmidhuber, 2018).
    In turn, the accurate data provided by blockchain technology can be used as input
    for AI applications and to also record their outputs (Rabah et al., 2018). Besides,
    AI can enhance IoT by developing applications to analyse data captured by sensors
    in real time using machine learning algorithms (Reshma and Pillai, 2018). Machine
    learning and other analytic methods can also improve predictive and prescriptive
    capabilities (decision making) of Big Data Analytics. There is a broad consensus
    on the need to strengthen research and innovation in the Agri-food sector, both
    in terms of practices and technologies, through the creation of new products,
    the improvement of processes, services or processes or the integration of digital
    possibilities. Indeed, one of the persisting challenges to take advantage of the
    full potential of the data is to achieve not only the integration of these technologies
    but also their interoperability. Diversity of stakeholders integrating agri-food
    supply chains with different interests and characteristics make difficult to find
    solutions that fit all those involved, so group decision-making tools should be
    developed (Zaraté et al., 2019). Moreover, when these solutions require significant
    investments and there are stakeholders, such as small farmers with a limited budget.
    For this reason, it will be key to demonstrate the value of innovations as compared
    to their companies and to collect and exchange data. Other challenges reside on
    the needs of data standards. The standardization of the fruition data would provide
    equity for all stakeholders because of the possibility to access to the same information
    that might provide financial gain. The fruition data might provide the training
    for ensuring the availability of the required technical skills and definition
    of regulatory actions by governments. Research may be co-financed with partners
    private (e.g., companies or business groups), government (many departments and
    agencies involved) or institutional (e. g. universities). This approach accentuates
    the effect leverage government support and improve the transfer of innovations
    to businesses. It enables the training of highly qualified personnel and a new
    generation of scientists for companies and centres of research. The stability
    of funding agreements with the centres promote the retention of their qualified
    staff and facilitate partnerships with industry for the realization of structuring
    projects. Access to appropriate funding and research tax credits and development
    (R&D) is also a source of funding structuring for the industry to absorb financial
    risks generated by innovation activities (Tuhin et al., 2019). This type of financing
    is particularly important when innovation takes place directly in the company,
    which is often the case in food processing. 4. The new models of the Agri-Food
    supply chains The competitiveness of food processing companies depends on their
    investment capacity, the increase in their production, the development of new
    products and the implementation of processes to stand out from the competition
    (Guoqing et al., 2020). Over the past 30 years, we have seen a significant reduction
    in biodiversity, FAO estimates that we will have a 70 % reduction in biodiversity
    on our planet by 2050 (FAO, 2018). Human activities seem to be the main cause
    of this loss. The agriculture has many cards in hand to slow this process by implementing
    environmental protection practices and reducing the chemicals that have led to
    the destruction of many animals and insects living on land, in the air and in
    the water; creating green corridors and shelters for animals and insects; the
    cultivation of old species or species with high genetic variability, leaving the
    design of hybrid plants and monocultures that lead to significant genetic depletion;
    the reduction of arable land to make way for the replanting of forests, grasslands
    and hedges. The competitiveness is addressed to a new way of thinking the Agriculture
    that will let to optimize the process and respecting the nature. The labour shortage
    in many regions of Europe requires processing companies to automate and robotize
    their processes. In addition, investment in these new technologies allows them
    to improve their productivity and provide better working conditions necessary
    to the attraction and retention of the workforce. In addition, to meet the quality
    standards requirements of large chains and food retailers, they must use recognised
    quality management and traceability systems. Investment in digital technologies
    also promotes automation of operations, data management and access to a new range
    of management tools (Industry 4.0). The industry is particularly requested, as
    shown in the previous section, for the use of digital technologies, which allows
    it to optimize production and the supply chain while ensuring traceability of
    food from more and more pointed (Panetto et al., 2019). It is not new that, nowadays,
    agricultures supply chain practices, especially regarding to food products, are
    currently under public scrutiny. As established by Van Der Vorst (2006), this
    is because several factors, which considers food contamination issues, the new
    consumer healthy requirements, requirements for more precise information about
    the farming, marketing, and distribution practices used to bring the agricultural
    products into the shelves into supermarket, to name a few. In this same context,
    and regarding to Suprem et al. (2013), agricultural industry has been solely dependent
    on human labour with limited application of mechanical equipment and machines.
    Moreover, the applications of advanced technology such as embedded computing,
    robotics, wireless technology, GPS/GIS (Geographical Positioning System/Geographical
    Information System) and DBMS (Database Management System) software are seen to
    be recent developments, where regulations are vaguely considered. Moreover, the
    increasing gap between farmer''s expectations and the ability of the government
    led extension services has created a big business opportunity for private parties
    (Kumar and Ali, 2007). In this context, the information about the geometric properties
    of crops provided by digital based techniques, such as: ultrasound, digital photographic
    techniques, light sensors, high-resolution radar images, high-resolution X-ray
    computed tomography, stereo vision and LIDAR sensors; has innumerable applications
    in agriculture. Some important agricultural tasks that can benefit from these
    plant-geometry characterization techniques are the application of pesticides,
    irrigation, fertilization and crop training, improving the environmental and economic
    impact. But there is still a need to resolve several technological and commercial
    questions (Rosell et al., 2012). In line to this, agriculture technologies are
    focused on how traceability can be performed, in fact, the food industry had developed
    efficient traceability methods for the management of logistics and warehouses,
    based on the balance of costs and benefits of the traceability system level (Dabbene
    et al., 2013). Because of this, several authors are currently reviewing main agriculture
    supply chain technology based methods, and example of this is provided by Ahumada
    and Villalobos (2008), who identified that the use of integrated planning models
    in the agriculture supply chains is still very limited, with a high potential
    to manage perishable agri-food products, especially to deal with complex environments.
    In addition, (Ali and Kumar, 2011a) study the implication of using ICT in agriculture.
    From the authors’ findings it is highly appreciated that there is still a medium
    level of dissemination of information and knowledge sharing in agricultural developments
    (Boshkoska et al., 2019), as well as there is still a need for empirical evidences
    as to how ICT interventions are enabling the farmers to take informed decisions.
    Complementary to this, S. Araba and M. Fellows (Araba and Fellows, 2009) address
    that the majority of current research have not established a clear link between
    public access to ICTs and socioeconomic change/impacts in agriculture. In fact,
    there is a need for researchers to go beyond anecdotal evidence of downstream
    public access impacts on end‐users. Nevertheless, it is also evidenced that there
    is still limited ability on information to make definitive statements about agriculture
    expected impacts, as well as to identify and attribute specific impacts to specific
    ICT usage. Table 5 presents a summary on well-known methods and approached to
    support this, in special the agriculture supply chain decision-making methods.

    Hence, and as depicted from Table 1, as studied and established by Reardon et
    al. (2019), the food system can be thought of as “dendritic,” linking R&D, finance,
    input, and output supply chains. This means (1) the first and “core” supply chain,
    is the output Supply Chain. The second and upstream “feeder” supply chains are
    the farm input supply chains. The third and downstream ‘feeder’ supply chains
    are those supplying inputs to the post-farmgate segments. The fourth “pan-system
    feeder” supply chain is that supplying finance into every segment of every chain
    in the dendritic system. The fifth ‘feeder’ supply chain is a broad set of public
    assets apart from agricultural research institutions. The sixth set of “feeders”
    is the R&D supply chains, which supply technology and product innovations. Moreover,
    the ICT challenges in Agriculture supply chains are still open. Birkel in Birkel
    and Hartmann (2019), studied most of the recent ICT developments in this field,
    and found that most of the technological challenges in agriculture mainly includes
    security issues, lack of standards and interoperability, as well as hardware and
    software limitations are the focus of current research. Hence, the main challenges
    and risks are also in relation to the methodology, where (Ben-Daya et al., 2017)
    has revealed that the design aspect is primarily identified as a technological
    issue, while neglecting social and political challenges. Food processing companies''
    projects must benefit from financial levers that the government makes available
    to all in the manufacturing sector (Hernández et al., 2020). In order to further
    stimulate the investments, particularly in the SMEs and in innovative sectors,
    from financial tools considering the needs of the processing sector are decisive
    for the development of the implementation of development projects (Hernandez et
    al., 2020). In a business environment characterized by technological innovation,
    the consolidation of industries, deregulation and demand for consumers in constant
    evolution, the approaches of the traditional managers can no longer allow for
    companies to remain profitable. They are therefore forced to find new ways to
    stay competitive in agri-food domain, as it is also the case for all other industrial
    sectors (Boehlje, 1999; Senge, 1997; Senge et al., 2006). In the value chain management
    (VCM) domain, the informed decision making to unite resources to improve the competitiveness,
    is proving to be a powerful strategic approach that allows organizations to adapt
    to an environment of business in full motion. (Bonney et al., 2007; Collins, 2011;
    Dunne, 2008; Fearne, 2007; Fernandez et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019). The concept
    of a continuous observation results in continuous and significant improvement
    of the design and the system performance, this is only possible when the companies
    are able to establish a degree of coordination and integration with their suppliers
    and customers that do not allow them the usual relationships with the latter based
    on the transactional approach buyer-seller (Sparling, 2007). Closer strategic
    relationships with customers and suppliers allow companies to better learn and
    adapt (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990). Multiple firms that co-invent and work together
    for the same objectives using integrated processes can increase their performance
    in a much more significant way that if they had gone it alone (Bonney et al.,
    2007; Fearne, 2007). Co-innovation allows companies to improve their own practices
    as well as those of all of them, it is a process that gives companies competitive
    forces that are difficult to match by others (Bonney et al., 2007; Collins, 2011).
    Several of the cases mentioned below demonstrate the benefits sustainable and
    competitive products obtained by companies who have chosen to co-innovate with
    other members of their supply chain. 5. Conclusions, vision and perspectives For
    this scientific contribution to knowledge, more than two hundred papers support
    the analysis on scientific work on the smart agriculture technology trends, but,
    more importantly, on how they emerge as a main concept in the agriculture domain
    as Agri-Food 4.0. From this reviews and analysis, it is clearly revealed that
    integration across new technologies allows smart agriculture to address important
    farming objectives as water saving, soil conservation, limit carbon emission and
    productivity increasing by doing more with less. In fact, the new technologies
    have a positive impact and at the same time pose new challenges in the management
    of different domains of human knowledge. Hence, two main conceptual pillars impact
    and challenges, arising from the use of various technologies in the world of the
    new conception of agriculture are the fundamental aspects in Agri-Food 4.0. A
    precision is due. This paper focus principally on the factory farm model issued
    from the “western” style. In those farms, the Agri-Food 4.0 started to be applied
    and validated. The focus is more specialised on the industrial farming although
    the Agri-Food 4.0 is started to be adapted also to the organic and silvo-pasture
    paradigms. The paper pays attention particularly to four major technologies, the
    Internet of Things, the Blockchain, the Big data and the Artificial Intelligence.
    For each of those technologies is presented some type of impacts: functional,
    economic, environmental, social, related to the business and technological and
    the challenges that come with their introduction. The literature is segmented
    in relation to the functionality of the specific technology and a panoramic view
    gives the possibility to better understand the paths needed to face the new challenges.
    The future of the Agriculture domain is in the creation of a resilient and sustainable
    farming system. On the four types of crop-based uncertainty that have been identified:
    Product, Process, Market and Environment the core problem is the management. Poor
    management of these sources of uncertainty have a negative impact on safety, quality,
    quantity and waste of products as well as human, technological and natural resources.
    Today, and always more in the future, the data is the lifeblood of any business
    and the agricultural business is not an exception but rather a referent. As aforementioned
    in the discussion section, the new technologies have a great impact on the reduction
    of uncertainty since they allow obtaining precise data in real time, and real-time
    information tools provide new opportunities for companies to react more quickly
    to changing conditions in the supply chain. Our interest in the next future is
    to use formal methods to extract knowledge from the interrelation of the difference
    technologies impacts and from the existing solutions to the highlighted challenges
    to increase the efficiency, sustainability, flexibility, agility, and the resilience
    along the whole supply chain from the farmers to the final customers, and the
    analysis and outcomes from this paper, will contribute to support that from the
    main research knowledge findings. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors,

    Lecture Notes in Mechanical Engineering ((LNME)) Abstract Food is the essential
    and fundamental requirement of all living things. Since the availability of  various
    food growing resources is limited, not expandable, or not in human control like
    agricultural land, fossil fuel, and underground water. Food demand has risen at
    a rapid rate in recent decades. World powers are trying to adopt smart farming
    to expand agriculture and allied sectors to acquire the food requirement. Smart
    agriculture technologies are required to advance crop and livestock value chain
    development, improve productivity, and sustain. Smart farming technologies use
    data and technology to enhance the economic yield of agricultural output as well
    as optimize farming process inputs throughout the food supply chain, including
    transportation, distribution, and retail. This paper seeks to review new farming
    technology to improve food productivity to meet the world demand considering human
    health. Various types of new technology are available for organic farming such
    as the Internet of Things, precision farming, livestock farming, renewable energy,
    artificial intelligence using sensors, robots, unmanned guided vehicles. Scientific
    databases were searched for review articles by using different keywords: ‘agriculture
    tool’, smart farming’, ‘farming techniques’, ‘modern agriculture’, ‘productivity’,
    ‘ergonomics’, after applying selection criteria, 64 articles related to smart
    farming selected. Bibliometric analysis was carried out to obtain the relevant
    information by using RStudio (desktop 2022.02.0.443) such as leading authors,
    sources, annual production, keywords, and countrywide available literature that
    statistically contributes to smart farming research. We concluded that new agricultural
    technologies suitable for small farmers have enormous potential to reduce poverty
    and promote rural development. Keywords Agriculture tool Smart farming Farming

    smart farming alternatives to show how smart farming solutions could significantly
    influence agricultural productivity, agribusiness, rural communities, and their
    constituents. This gap motivates us for exploring  the smart farming solutions
    [1]. Agriculture trade, research and development, education, training, and advisory
    policies have significantly impacted technology selection, agricultural production
    levels, and farm practices. Agriculture is becoming more interacted with the food
    supply chain, and the global market, while sustainability, food safety, quality,
    and animal welfare standards are increasing. It has new problems meeting rising
    food demands, remaining globally competitive, and producing high-quality agricultural
    goods. Similarly, it must achieve sustainability goals while changing farm policy,
    liberalizing trade, and executing global environmental agreements [2]. India is
    an agriculture-based economy, in which over 50% population directly or indirectly
    depends on agriculture. The agriculture sector performance of any country drives
    the market prices and fulfills the world population’s demand. Recently, Indian
    government also increased investment in agriculture drones, many initiatives to
    encourage farmers to start smart farming. As per a United Nations Food and Agriculture
    Organization report, food output would increases by 70% in 2050 compared to 2006
    [3]. The production of any agricultural crop depends on various parameters like
    quality of seeds and soil contents in external parameters; it depends mainly on
    temperature, humidity, rain, moisture, etc. These are natural factors that humans
    cannot control. Agriculture is also influenced by elements such as pets, illness,
    fertilizers, and so on; all of which can be regulated by treating crops properly.
    Pesticides have the potential to strengthen crop yield. Modern technology’s number
    of important modern agriculture has contributed to expanding agricultural evidence
    support. The country might achieve security by utilizing contemporary farming
    methods such as improved seed quality, correct irrigation, adequate nutrient delivery,
    synthetic fertilizers, and pest and disease management. It has also included modern
    farming practices such as tractors, agricultural equipment, and irrigation tube
    wells. Green revolution refers to a rapid increase in domestic productivity caused
    by using high-yielding diverse selection seeds. 1.1 Importance of the Study India
    is a fast-growing economic country with a percentage share of agriculture and
    allied sector to the real economy in India. Gross domestic product (GDP) is 20.20%
    in 2020–21. Although India is the world''s second-most populated nation (138 million
    people), following China, it has an ever-increasing population and shrinking agricultural
    area. Because food consumption is high by the day, we must enhance food product
    production to balance food availability and the global population. To meet demand
    quickly, we should transform from conventional farming to modern agricultural
    technology that considers population well-being and ergonomics. Artificial intelligence
    (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), GPS, unnamed aerial vehicles (UAV), modern
    hand tools, robots, renewable sources of energy, organic farming, precision farming,
    and the mobile Internet are advanced technology that can offer effective solutions
    to the issues that are facing the world. The Internet of Things is essential for
    connecting the sensor to perform basic tasks. This paper analyzes whether advanced
    agriculture technologies have enough potential to meet the world population demand
    for a term when available agricultural land decreases? To improve productivity,
    we need to minimize the drawbacks of conventional farming ergonomically, considering
    human health factors are a prime concern. Repetitive activity, poor posture, and
    ergonomically built tools contribute to human health concerns in agriculture.
    Afterward, they result in musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) in various body parts.
    It will directly impact the economy and the workers [4]. The study comprised a
    complete bibliometric analysis of smart farming and modern agriculture technology
    with countrywide potential, which was not done before. We have discussed the top
    four growing technology in agriculture, their current challenges when the world
    is in the globalization phase, and how to overcome these to meet population demand
    using smart gadgets applications. 2 Literature Review This is the fourth agriculture
    revolution in which technology dominates conventional farming like the Internet
    of Things, artificial intelligence, and mobile technology. Before this, the third
    revolution (Green revolution) was based on fertilizer to increase agriculture
    productivity during Indian national movements. The first and second revolutions
    related to agriculture development and mechanization of agriculture production,
    respectively [5]. Since the last two decades, basically, in the fourth agriculture
    revolution, there has been a lot of work in the farming field related to technology
    to increase productivity and minimize human discomfort, ergonomically tool design,
    and reduce the risk of musculoskeletal disorders. Several studies were found linked
    to intelligent agriculture technology and human comfort. 2.1 Organic Farming Growing
    awareness of environmental sustainability, health risks linked with industrial
    agriculture chemicals, and consumers’ predilection for safe and risk-free food
    are driving interest in alternative kinds of agricultural production. Organic
    agriculture is just one of the multiple environmentally friendly producing options
    available. Organic agriculture is just one of the multiple environmentally friendly
    producing options available. Organic food consumption continuously expands in
    developed and developing countries, with a 20–25% yearly average growth [6]. Pesticide-related
    ailments, musculoskeletal disorders, allergy, respiratory difficulties, hormonal
    health issues, environmental illnesses, infectious diseases, immune disorders,
    eye, ear issues, and malignancies are all examples of agricultural-related health
    complications. Contamination is a serious work hazard that can lead to toxicity
    and death [7]. Organic farming is being encouraged in developing nations due to
    the exponential advancement in the organic market trends and customer engagement
    for healthier as well as better agriculture activities [8]. Chemical hazards were
    less common in organic farming. Its working environment and obstacles must be
    regarded as part of the sector''s long-term objectives. The present research examined
    potentially damaging inputs in (organic vs. conventional) agriculture with the
    relationships between the agriculture technique and musculoskeletal disorders
    (MSDs) and cognitive health symptoms based on available literature [9]. Excessive
    use of commodity practices (mechanically or manually harvesting rather than spraying)
    can exacerbate musculoskeletal complaints [10]. Compared to organic farmers, a
    higher proportion of conventional farmers had ingredients/pesticides splattered
    on either face or skin, and machine tools injured many farmers. Organic farmers
    had a lower chance of pesticide-related health symptoms (skin infection, blistering,
    pains, fatigue), whereas conventional farmers had a greater risk [7]. Organic
    farming is an essential substitute for conventional farming to encourage and preserve
    ecology in the agriculture ecosystem. We offer more appropriate treatments for
    biological resources ecosystems and strategies to combine regional and broad scales
    in current traditional and organic farming methods, including inland reform, after
    considering measures required for biodiversity-friendly agriculture [11]. In a
    country like India, the prime concern for farmers is the availability of a market
    where they can sell products except in metro cities because the cost is relatively
    high compared to the common market. Still, after the COVID-19 pandemic, people
    are more focused on our health, directly increasing the demand for organic farming.
    The top four growing smart farming technology discussed below. 2.2 ML and Internet
    of Things AI systems forecast likely outcomes based on the available information.
    On the other hand, machine learning algorithms leverage real-time data used to
    train machines and increase the system’s accuracy. The data analytics (DA), on
    the other hand, believes there are sufficient reasons to prescribe an overall
    positive effect to the specific issue. Figure 1 shows that automation approaches
    play an essential role in sequentially generating correct information. As a result,
    many mechanization approaches have been advised for efficient food production
    [12]. Fig. 1 Significant role of automation technology in supplying factual data
    [12] Full size image Artificial intelligence-powered (AI) decision-making and
    prescriptive algorithms, along with dramatic improvements in sensing technologies
    and robotic systems, will likely impact how consumers, individuals, organizations,
    governments, and private entities perceive and mitigate climate and changes in
    the environment. AI is growing interest for all developed and developing countries
    ready for investment [13]. Climate change surveillance, conservation measures,
    land checking, enhancing productivity, crop management, managing insecticides
    and pesticides, soil management, identifying plant infections, and improving agricultural
    sale rates are all typical applications for the Internet of Things [3]. Table
    1 is related to smart farming devices and their applications. Conventional farming
    requires manual checking, which is time-consuming and less effective, resulting
    in a loss in growing crops. This farming pre-required some technical skills to
    run effectively and have more time to commercialize in developing and underdeveloped
    countries. Table 1 Smart farming devices and their applications Full size table
    The objective of agro-IoT systems is to increase the productivity of crops, minimize
    farmer activity, cost of the integrated system minimizes, utilize solar energy,
    make the cultivation process ergonomic, and be effective for small-scale farmers
    whose percentage is high. Despite growing interest and implementation of artificial
    intelligence (AI) technologies is crucial sectors for sustainability, few have
    adequately studied the potential of systemic risks. The risk may have different
    kinds related to other technology like algorithmic bias allocation harms, shocks,
    cascading failures, and AI efficiency and resilience, responsible for AI governance
    [3]. 2.3 Livestock Farming Animal welfare in livestock production is of great
    interest to consumers as the world’s population increases continuously. The livestock
    agriculture method must evolve to meet the increased demand for more livestock
    products while considering environmental sustainability, animal welfare, and human
    health [14]. Current trends in livestock farming are automatic feeding devices,
    breastfeeding robots, animal manure management, and improving productivity through
    monitoring, livestock breeding, heredity, as well as nourishment. These have all
    witnessed considerable developments in the previous decade. Despite this development,
    there are still significant obstacles to overcome. Rigorous livestock management
    is required to fulfill the growing demand for milk and animal-related products.
    Yet, the captive and packed nature makes it tough for farmers to closely monitor
    animal health and quality of life [15]. Inflammation, excessive heat, and other
    health-related issues in livestock farming will become more common as the global
    climate increases [16]. This will increase the necessity of detecting health issues
    and disease outbreaks early, identifying transmission of pathogens, and insurance
    needs measures to neglect significant financial losses [17]. The most significant
    factors in efficiently monitoring animal health are cost, validity, and timing
    of observations. The majority of existing procedures are time-consuming, employment,
    and thus costly [18]. Four basic features define big data, often alluded to as
    the ‘4 Vs.’ model: (i) volume: the quantity of data; (ii) velocity: the speed
    with which data may be accessible; (iii) variety: the numerous kind of data; and
    (iv) veracity: the accuracy with which data can be handled and updated [19]. Livestock
    farming is fashioned in European and American countries where the risk of viral
    disease transfer is very high from animal to animal and animal to human; this
    should be minimized in the future. In the Indian region, negligible use for these
    type of farming techniques are explored. Animals-related products like milk, curd,
    and cheese directly affect human health. Not an easy task to run this type of
    farm without human interaction because they are living creatures, and technology
    follows a programmed operation. 2.4 Renewable Resource of Energy The most excellent
    affinity for the agriculture sector is solar energy. The development of photovoltaic
    (PV) cells equipment for solar energy conversion technology in agriculture reduces
    the requirement of fossil fuels in this area and provides a more economically
    viable and sustainable electricity generation technology while also reducing greenhouse
    gas (GHG) pollutants tremendously. Overview of commercial and research study suggests
    integrating PV technology with electric agriculture tractors and agricultural
    automation. High initial expenditures, primarily associated with photovoltaic
    modules and battery storage devices, as well as insufficient electricity battery
    technologies, appear to be two significant barriers to the massive implementation
    of modern solar-powered electric agriculture gear, according to the research [20].
    The overall value of GHGs emitted from agricultural processes is generally expressed
    in carbon equivalents. Energy generation has the highest Co2 emission percentage
    of 78.7% when various agricultural operations are considered [21]. The agricultural
    industry has several challenges, including energy prices, faster depletion of
    natural resources, restricted water supplies, agrochemical susceptibility, and
    environmental conservation, making the sector unstable [22]. Solar panels are
    an excellent alternative for globalizing electric renewable power among small-scale
    farmers’ dispersed consumers. In contrast, in big farms with minor concerns for
    land utilization, a centralized PV power plant might be established and used to
    feed consumers [23]. Silicon (Si), cadmium tellurium (CdTe), gallium arsenide
    (GaAs), copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) are the most frequent elements used
    in industrial PV cells [24]. The major environmental parameters that significantly
    impact PV module efficiency are solar irradiance, ambient temperature, air velocity,
    and dusty collection [25]. The agricultural business is getting more sophisticated,
    cheaper, faster, and more organized due to unmanned drones. Even though most agricultural
    robots are still beyond industrialization due to costly installation as well as
    maintenance expenditures, the latest developments in agricultural technology and
    the emerging demand in workforce prices will make this technology more affordable
    shortly [26]. As the economic consequences diminish, the number of machine–human
    engagements reduces, and workforce management and maintenance costs decrease.
    Agriculture is one industry that consumes the most coal and oil, endangering its
    safety and putting its sustainability and output at risk. Nowadays, available
    panels do not have enough capacity to run heavy agriculture machinery in the long
    run; installing more cells is not a solution because storage capacity is another
    issue. Therefore, scholars need to work on this parameter to implement solar energy
    in agricultural use at a large scale and in heavy machinery. 3 Methodology Based
    on keywords used in the literature related to smart farming, the below six keywords,
    and their combination were used for this review study. Relevant articles were
    searched from the web of science database by using keywords such as smart farming,
    farming techniques, modern agriculture, agriculture tools, productivity, ergonomics,
    and the application of inclusion/exclusion criteria, including different operators,
    filters, and possible combinations of concern keywords. 3.1 Data Extraction By
    using the Scopus database with all possible combinations of keywords having search
    terms related to smart farming techniques, namely ‘smart farming’, ‘farming techniques’,
    ‘modern agriculture’, ‘productivity’, ‘ergonomics’, 697 articles were found. Figure
    2 (flowchart) shows the article selection process for the review. Selection based
    on the time frame between 2011 and 2021 found 576 articles. Applied inclusion/exclusion
    criteria on searched articles with keywords inclusion criteria are time frame,
    literature having in English language only, top publishers, and exclusion criteria
    are duplicate articles, book chapter, conference paper editorials, found 332 articles.
    After distributing reports as per the leading journals, we found 168 articles.
    To remove the irrelevant articles, not related to smart farming, selected 92 papers
    after reading the title and abstract. After detailed content analysis, 64 articles
    were selected for the final bibliometric analysis. The conclusion made for the
    systematic literature based on these finally reviewed articles. These are all
    related to growing smart farming technology such as organic farming, ML and the
    Internet of things, renewable resources of energy, and livestock farming. Fig.

    3.2 Bibliometric Analysis Bibliometrics help researchers obtain better knowledge
    about the topic of study. Bibliometrics has concentrated on the complex statistical
    analysis of citations and citation counts. Personal knowledge and experience are
    insufficient for analyzing trends and making decisions because they are diverse.
    Our data related to annual scientific with top countries enlisted in terms of
    available documents, relevant sources, authors, and visualization frequently used
    words. RSstudio (Desktop 2022.02.0+443) software was used to get the result for
    the analysis in a bibliometric study. 3.2.1 Annual Specific Literature The Scopus
    database gathers information on annual scientific publications of papers relevant
    to smart farming. Scopus is one of the world''s leading databases for scientific
    articles. Scopus articles are more peer-reviewed than in some other scientific
    databases. Figure 3 depicts the annual production of scientific papers. There
    were very few documents before 2010, but after that exponential increase in work
    related to smart farming worldwide, the scholar’s interest is continuously increasing
    in modern agriculture technology. The highest number of articles is more than
    150 in the year 2021. Now, authors are talking about the resilience and effectiveness
    of technology and its impact on human life and cost-based analysis. Production
    indicates that the future of smart farming will be very fruitful in the upcoming
    days. Fig. 3 Annually published literature in smart farming Full size image 3.2.2

    to smart farming techniques. India, China, and the United States are the top three
    countries. Mainly, regions are developed or developing countries. We all observe
    the turnaround of the world economy where the United States is the most powerful
    country and China’s highest exporter of food products, and India is the fastest-growing
    economy after the COVID-19 pandemic where a large portion of the world was struggling
    for food. We hope this review article motivates scholars of underdeveloped countries
    to exercise smart farming to handle the food crises in the future. 3.2.4 Top Keywords

    total of 64 relevant articles out of 697 research articles were selected for the
    review study. We found that four smart farming techniques are most likely among
    scholars and execution in the field name: organic farming, ML and Internet of
    Things, renewable resource of energy, and livestock farming. An annual publication
    of research papers is highest in 2021. India, China, United States topped in terms
    of available literature. The most relevant source of study is sustainability and
    agriculture systems. There are very few technology implementations on land because
    of high initial investment costs and no proper channel for information flow; this
    is a major concern in all nations except developed countries. Figure 7 shows the
    smart farming research status having the highest in organic farming (39%) and
    ML and Internet of things (30%), renewable resources of energy (19%), livestock
    farming (12%). This is a direct indication of organic farming, and the Internet
    of Things (IoT) is the favorite among all to acquire future food demand. Fig.
    7 Smart farming research status Full size image Figure 8 shows the key factors
    focused in the literature discussion, which has the highest percentage with productivity
    (42%), sustainability (32%), and the least with cost-based analysis (2%) indicating
    that productivity and sustainability are the main criteria of nowadays in smart
    farming. Key factors focused on smart farming justify balancing between enhancing
    productivity to meet food demand with taking care of sustainability and human
    health. Fig. 8 Key factors focused on smart farming Full size image 5 Conclusion
    and Future Scope As per a review of the extant literature, there is little or
    no research on smart farming in underdeveloped and developing countries. Only,
    documents found in a developed or developing country in advanced agriculture techniques.
    It is hoped that this review will motivate researchers to work in research and
    development to find out more economical and reliable farming methods to improve
    productivity using available sources. Before the last decades, there was just
    a little work in smart farming. Still, it has been steadily developing. It is
    substantially superior to conventional productivity, fulfilling food demand, human
    health safety, and considering worker health ergonomically, part of the production
    system. Several determinants need to be overcome, like initial investment, lack
    of knowledge about proper methods of smart farming for small-scale farmers, and
    the market for sale. This study helps to understand the impact of smart farming
    techniques over the year to fulfill the food demand, currently what method is
    followed and its drawback, and required steps taken for future references. By
    using these results, we develop a framework for future research. The most significant
    limitation of this review was a lack of time to go through all of the relevant
    material in other databases. However, a step-by-step technique was used to collect
    research articles that might be wholly studied with good results. The reviewed
    sample size is very small. Systematic literature review only for top growing smart
    farming techniques not covered all. Most of the reviewed IoT hardware on paper
    only need to implement and validate performance with cost-based analysis and take
    improvements measures. Scholars need to survey small-scaled farmers for more relevant
    results to examine the potential of modern agriculture technology on a lower scale,
    not only for commercialized farmers. Intrusion detection gadgets are the need
    of hours mainly in India. We need to do research in developing countries. Technology
    should be implemented on agricultural land, not only on paper, and nations invest
    in smart farming to support farmers initially. References O’Shaughnessy, Susan

    computing technologies have revolutionized every sphere of 21 st century humans.
    IoT technologies and the data driven services they offer were beyond imagination
    just a decade ago. Now, they surround us and influence a variety of domains such
    as automobile, smart home, healthcare, etc. In particular, the Agriculture and
    Farming industries have also embraced this technological intervention. Smart devices
    are widely used by a range of people from farmers to entrepreneurs. These technologies
    are used in a variety of ways, from finding real-time status of crops and soil
    moisture content to deploying drones to assist with tasks such as applying pesticide
    spray. However, the use of IoT and smart communication technologies introduce
    a vast exposure to cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities in smart farming
    environments. Such cyber attacks have the potential to disrupt the economies of
    countries that are widely dependent on agriculture. In this paper, we present
    a holistic study on security and privacy in a smart farming ecosystem. The paper
    outlines a multi layered architecture relevant to the precision agriculture domain
    and discusses the security and privacy issues in this dynamic and distributed
    cyber physical environment. Further more, the paper elaborates on potential cyber
    attack scenarios and highlights open research challenges and future directions.

    According to the United Nations (UN), the world population is expected to exceed
    9 billion people by 2050, growing by almost a third of the current population
    [1], [2]. Such an increase in the population demands a boost of almost 70 percent
    in the food production rate, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization
    of the United Nations.1 This rapidly growing population also introduces a variety
    of other problems such as increasing competition and exploitation of land, water
    and other natural resources. These issues present an urgent need to reduce the
    dependence of food system on our environment. Consequently, the need for an evolutionary
    agricultural paradigm to keep up with growing demand of food and crop production
    is necessary to guarantee a sustainable development [3]. Smart farming technologies2
    and precision agriculture3 [4] are gaining more attraction for their potential
    to fulfill such an increasing demand and meet global food supply needs. Smart
    farming technologies involve integration of technology and data driven agriculture
    applications to increase crop yield and quality of food products. There are numerous
    smart farming use cases [5]–[7] present globally indicating the impact of this
    new paradigm of practicing agriculture. As an example, the use of remote sensors
    placed in the soil for measuring blueberry irrigation in Chile has reduced the
    volume of water used in farming by 70 percent [8]. In India, farm data has been
    used to predict and prevent crop diseases, which reduced the risk associated with
    the failure of crop production [9]. Similar data driven approaches have helped
    fruit farmers in Slovenia effectively fight against pests.4 Smart farming, however,
    goes beyond primary production. In fact, it has impacted the complete food supply
    chain, by employing big data analytics to provide useful insights about the entire
    farming process [10] by facilitating real-time operational decision making, and
    revolutionizing existing agriculture business models. Smart farming enhances conventional
    farming practices by introducing on-field smart sensors and devices. These sensors
    and devices work in a synergistic manner to provide efficient farming experiences,
    as well as, an improved crop yield. Although beneficial to the productivity of
    the industry, the use of heterogeneous, internet-connected devices has exposed
    potential cyber attacks and vulnerabilities in the agriculture sector. These attacks
    introduce the ability to remotely control and exploit on-field sensors and autonomous
    vehicles (tractors, aerial vehicles, etc). Potential agricultural attacks can
    create an unsafe and unproductive farming environment. For example, exploits that
    have the ability to destroy an entire field of standing grown crops, flood the
    farmlands, over spray pesticides using smart drones, etc. can cause unsafe consumption
    as well as economic deterioration. Such attacks in a large coordinated manner,
    also referred to as agro-terrorism [11], also have the potential of disrupting
    the economy of an agriculture-dependent nation. A report [12] released by the
    U.S. Department of Homeland Security extensively elaborates various cyber threat
    scenarios in precision agriculture, further emphasizing the need for research
    in this critical domain. The Agriculture industry adds 6.4 percent of the world’s
    economic production with a total of $5,084,800 million.5 Agriculture, food, and
    related industries contributed $1.053 trillion to U.S. gross domestic product
    (GDP) in 2017.6 At the same time, United State’s farms contributed $132.8 billion
    of this sum which is almost 1 percent of GDP. Agriculture contributed 1.2 % to
    the European Union’s (EU) GDP in 2017 whereas EU’s agricultural industry added
    gross value of EUR 188.5 billion in 20177 at a record high. Out of 226 countries,
    nine countries have agriculture sector as the dominant sector in their economy.
    The U.S. food and agriculture system has a total economic impact of $7.06 trillion8
    and one-fourth of the overall jobs in the country are connected to it. Most countries
    globally export agricultural products. As a result, cyber vulnerabilities can
    have a significant impact on global food security. A sophisticated agro-terrorism
    attack on a (large) exporting country like the U.S. could harm the health of millions
    of consumers world-wide. In addition, attacks could reduce confidence on domestic
    consumption and destroy the United State’s status as a trusted food exporter.
    A report released in 2018 by the Council of Economic Advisors,9 “The Cost of Malicious
    Cyber Activity to the U.S. Economy” suggests the agriculture sector as one of
    the 16 critical infrastructure sectors that are important to both the U.S. economy
    and national security for which cyber protection is particularly important. It
    also reported that the agriculture sector experienced 11 cyber incidents in 2016.
    According to the World Health Organization,10 420,000 people die every year from
    food-related illnesses and 600 million people fall ill as a result of food contaminated
    with bacteria, viruses, toxins or chemicals. A cyber attack on the food ecosystem
    targeted at farms, transportation system, or food processing industrial control
    systems (ICSs) may increase these numbers exponentially. Other important industries
    like energy, financial or healthcare have understood the need for resilient infrastructure
    and have hardened their defenses. However, the food and agriculture industry is
    still a low hanging fruit for threat actors. Food Protection and Defense Institute
    (FPDI) at the University of Minnesota has discovered that food industry ICSs may
    be distinctly vulnerable to cyberattacks.11 Food industry operations technology
    personnel, in particular, those responsible for operating and maintaining ICSs,
    are experts trained in food and production safety production and not in cybersecurity.
    This presents a huge gap between employing smart farm technology and securing
    it correctly and persistently. If not continuously monitored, cyber attacks on
    smart agriculture technologies can have grave implications on several stakeholders
    in the ecosystem. These groups include farmers, end consumers, food processing
    industries, agriculture co-operatives, livestock, government agencies and nations
    critically dependent on agriculture. Figure 1, shows an end to end interaction
    among various entities involved in smart farming ecosystem. Physical sensors and
    livestock in the field generate data and receive command operations via user applications.
    These on-farm devices are connected to gateway supported edge nodes, which help
    enable in-farm device communication, filter sensor data and real time agronomy
    analytics. At the same time, data lakes in the cloud hold a large amount of data
    and information including but not limited to, environmental information (e.g.
    soil moisture level and fertility status), monitoring information (e.g. sensors
    and smart machinery status), energy management data, and other sensitive information.
    In terms of security and data privacy, it is needless to say that manipulation
    and leakage of such data, as well as the impairment of physical equipment and
    software systems, can induce serious consequences. FIGURE 1. A model of end-to-end
    interaction between various stakeholders in smart farming. Show All Extensive
    research on secure IoT devices [13]–[15], smart vehicles [16]–[19], drones [20],
    [21], edge cloud [22]–[24], wireless communication [25]–[27] is already available
    and might be extended to the smart farming ecosystem. However, most of the time,
    research is conducted on these technologies without consideration of the environment
    they are used. The dynamic smart farming environment, has unique characteristics
    such as farm equipment, labor sharing, and operational decisions, influenced by
    environmental conditions. Domain specific issues such as like location, user skill
    set, insider threats, generated data, need smart-farming-specific security mechanisms.
    The development of smart farm technologies therefore, demands further research
    before wide adoption in the community. The current state of the art and our review
    (discussed in Section V) on smart farming, demands further research in security
    and privacy aspects of this evolving domain. As the research, on cybersecurity
    for smart farming is in its infancy, our objective in this review is to provide
    a holistic view of cybersecurity developments in smart farming. In this paper,
    we discuss current threats, analyze potential cybersecurity attacks, review the
    existing scattered security research, and summarize open research challenges in
    the smart farming field as illustrated in Figure 2. FIGURE 2. A roadmap of cybersecurity
    research and challenges in smart farming. Show All This paper has the following
    key contributions: It provides an overview of smart farming focused multi-layered
    architecture, highlighting multiple entry points and communication across layers.
    It identifies potential cybersecurity issues in smart farming and illustrates,
    scenario specific cyber attacks, which have been categorized into data, network,
    supply chain, and other common attacks. It presents an extensive evaluation of
    the current cybersecurity research, countermeasures in smart farming, and also
    enlists the focus, contributions and weaknesses of current research works. It
    provides a clear view of the open security research challenges in different areas
    including next generation network security, trustworthy supply chain and compliance,
    adversarial machine learning and AI, and access control, trust and information
    sharing. The remainder of this paper is as follows. Multi-layered architecture
    for smart farming is discussed in Section II. Section III elaborates security
    and privacy issues, whereas Section IV discusses different attacks on the smart
    farming ecosystem including the supply chain side. Existing research and state
    of the art in smart farming security is discussed in Section V. Section VI highlights
    open research challenges and possible approaches to solutions. Finally, Section
    VII draws conclusion to this research paper. SECTION II. Smart Farming Landscape
    & Architecture Figure 3, depicts a multi layer architecture for the smart farming
    ecosystem. The proposed architecture adapts and extends widely discussed IoT and
    Cyber Physical System (CPS) multi-layer architectures [28]–[31]. These architectures
    recognize the use of cloud and edge services, and the infinite capabilities provided
    by them to fully harness the data generated from smart devices at the physical
    layer [32]–[37]. Our smart farming architecture, also reflects different user
    applications which can be envisioned at various layers. It also considers, vast
    amounts of data collected at edge or cloud layers, and highlights the need for
    various multi-cloud or edge-cloud scenarios. Overall the architecture consists
    of four layers: Physical layer, Edge layer, Cloud layer, and Network Communication
    layer. The latter spans across all three previous layers and connect them. FIGURE
    3. Multi layer smart farming architecture. Show All A. Physical Layer The bottom
    layer in the architecture comprises of real physical sensors and gateway devices
    which are spread across agriculture farms or in greenhouse buildings. These devices
    include drones flying in the air, autonomous tractors, sensors embedded in livestock,
    or hub devices installed to provide communication among smart objects or with
    a central cloud. These devices are responsible for data sensing and based on the
    information gathered, help in actuating other devices to realise various smart
    farming use cases. They collect real time information about weather conditions,
    soil moisture level, or cattle’s body temperature, which can be sent to the edge
    or cloud supported intelligent decision making systems to provide recommendations
    and enable automation. For example, data gathered from soil moisture sensing device
    in the field, after getting processed in the edge or cloud, can help in determining
    the amount of water needed at the farm, optimize irrigation schedule and offers
    a convenient experience to the end farmers. B. Edge Layer This layer is near to
    the end-users and end-devices for local real-time computations and decisions.
    It reduces the computation load off the centralized cloud layer and also the network
    load. Edge computing layer consists of multiple edge nodes. Each node represents
    a gateway that include services such as: data capturing, security monitoring and
    detection, prediction and real-time decision support. Data capturing services
    include, data aggregation, filtering, encrypting and encoding of real-time data
    streams. Prediction services usually rely on machine learning models trained on
    the central cloud and deployed on the edge layer. They are used to predict and/or
    categorize certain events related to plant or livestock such as, prediction of
    crop yield, categorization of plants or livestock health, predictions about the
    amount of fertilizer and water needed for a patch of land, so as to maximize yield,
    or estimating soil erosion. Security monitoring and detection mechanisms can be
    deployed for real-time monitoring of anomalous events and classifying these events
    as malicious or benign. This includes services like, anomaly detection and device
    failures prediction. C. Cloud Layer Precision Agriculture (PA) and cloud computing
    paradigms offer advances to enhance PA connectivity. The cloud layer is generally
    virtualized in data centers and communicates with the other layers using the Internet.
    Generally, these cloud layer platforms follow the Platform as a Service (PaaS)
    architecture model where the users can focus on running applications and importing
    their data. The PaaS provider runs and maintains a data broker that collects data
    being pushed in from the edge layer and saves these records in a Distributed File
    System (DFS). This stored data is used by analytic software to mine knowledge.
    This data analytics component computes insights and these are pushed to the end
    user through a client application running on the users’ machine. Popular farm
    equipment manufacturers like, John Deere,12 Farmers Business Network,13 etc. have
    created several cloud based products that help users monitor various sensors and
    vehicles used on a farm. These PaaS systems generally run on popular cloud computing
    platforms like Amazon Web Services,14 Google Cloud,15 etc. The way these farming
    PaaS systems are built using these popular cloud computing platforms also introduce
    various security challenges in smart farming ecosystem. D. Network Communication
    Layer The common theme for most, if not all, current technologies is “connectivity”.
    With a growing need for a boundary-less Internet, the idea of a network of smart
    devices has become a reality. This concept, known as the Internet of Things (IoT),
    allows connected devices to be monitored, controlled, and shared data among each
    other. This data can be analyzed and used by multiple applications. In smart farming,
    as shown in Figure 3, the network layer not only facilitates edge and physical
    layer connectivity, but also provides an interface for them to interact with the
    cloud layer. From exchanging soil temperature through a peer-to-peer sensor communication
    system, to sending farm monitoring data to the cloud data stores through high
    speed mobile networks such as 5G [38], or updating the farmer about corp quality
    via a wireless adhoc topology [39], network layer offers a means of communication
    to bind all other layers. Network layer has two main responsibilities in a smart
    farming system. Firstly, there are diverse set of heterogeneous devices in every
    layers of a smart farming system. The network layer provides a secure and efficient
    network stack where, wire, wireless and mobile sub-networks can communicate in
    a compatible and cross-layer manner. The second responsibility of the layer is
    to preserve connectivity and therefore, increase availability. From bigdata processing
    systems used to analyze collected data to individual sensors that collect information
    from the field, this layer is needed for system-wide cyber communication. Real
    World Smart Farming Use Cases: The proposed smart farming architecture is constructed
    based on multiple literature and real world smart farming use cases. It can be
    viewed as a general smart farming architecture that satisfies most of the use
    cases. However, it should be noted that not all use cases will include all four
    layers as proposed in the architecture. Blackhills Farm in New Zealand, a 400-hectare
    property with over 2000 cattle and 800 sheep, has adopted the use of SCADAfarm16
    system which allows the owners to remotely monitor water and energy consumption,
    location of irrigators, soil moisture measurements and real-time weather information.
    The farm uses Schneider Electrics’s EcoStuxture IoT architecture17 which corresponds
    to our physical layer and sensors. It also utilizes Microsoft Azure18 IoT suite
    with communication provided by the Vodafone New Zealand cellular network which
    corresponds to the cloud and network layer in out framework. Similarly, a 7,000-acre
    farm at Beltsville Area Research Center, was developed by the United States Department
    of Agriculture (USDA) to act as a testbed for smart farming technologies. The
    farm was equipped with a physical layer including sensors, drones and IoT-enabled
    farm equipment for a public-private program called Farmbeats [5]. The farm adopts
    a two-layer hybrid network: a layer based on TV White Spaces [40] technology for
    connectivity over long range which connects the farmer’s home Internet connection
    to IoT base stations on the farm, and a layer based on Wi-Fi technology which
    connects smart sensors to the IoT base stations. Such IoT base stations (gateways)
    are equivalent to the edge cloud layer (Figure 3) in our proposed general architecture.
    Additionally, the data collected at the IoT stations are pushed to the cloud layer
    which employs AI algorithms for data analysis. Another usecase is a revolutionary
    step towards smart crop health monitoring. A group of researchers19 along with
    local farmers are developing a distributed airborne monitoring system to detect
    possible zones of crop damage or nutrient deficiency at a 492-acre farm in in
    North Carolina, United States. In order to accommodate rapidly-growing food demands
    and increase the quality and quantity of agricultural production, it is necessary
    to improve farming management practices and technological developments in agricultural
    fields. Accordingly, unlike traditional crop management methods that use farmers
    or ground vehicles for assessing crop health status, this collaborative smart
    farming project is using autonomous technology to perform aerial monitoring of
    agricultural fields to save time and money, while preventing damage to crops.
    In this project, a group of drones which monitor the field are working in the
    physical layer, as depicted in Figure 3. Drones communicate with each other through
    network layer, using which they also send collected data and images to land processing
    bases (i.e. the edge layer in our proposed architecture) for initial data cleaning
    and pre-processing. Finally, pre-processed data is sent to the cloud layer for
    storing and knowledge extraction functionalities. SECTION III. Security & Privacy
    Issues The adoption of sensor based technologies and cloud supported smart applications
    in agriculture has unleashed opportunities for adversaries to orchestrate cyber
    attacks. Therefore, it is important to first understand major security and privacy
    issues in smart farming domain before discussing specific cyber attacks. In this
    section, we will elaborate these issues in detail followed by attacks in the following
    section. A. Data Security & Privacy In a smart farm, an enormous amount of complex,
    dynamic and spatial data gets generated from many heterogeneous sensors, devices
    and equipment. Leakage of such information either through unauthorized access
    or by an insider can cause potential threats. For example, leakage of agriculture
    anti-jamming devices information can help an attacker bypass these security measures,
    while leakage of soil, crop, and agriculture purchase information can cause severe
    economic losses to farmers, if such information is used by competitors or hostile
    actors. On a larger scale, aggregating important agricultural information on a
    particular country is also a potential threat. As such data security and privacy
    is a very important requirement and one of the primary objectives to ensure the
    reliable operation in a smart farming ecosystem. Data on the Edge: Smart farms
    leverage Internet of Things (IoT), state-of-the-art communications (e.g., 5G),
    and artificial intelligence. Such systems mostly require fast response times,
    than those of a traditional model in which data is transmitted to a centralized
    data center (e.g., cloud) for processing and results are returned to a user. As
    such, the need of edge cloud is on the rise. Although moving data processing and
    analytics to the edge enhances agility and efficiency, to say the least, it also
    imposes huge security risks due to the increased attack surface primarily because
    of the highly diverse use of IoT devices which are usually not built with security
    in mind. This gives attackers an easy entry point to the network since remote
    access to the edge layer, in most cases, is essential. Additionally, finding the
    IP addresses of edge endpoints become an easy task especially when considering
    websites like Shodan,20 a search engine for all IoT connected devices. Beside
    directly compromising IoT devices or edge endpoints to gain access to the smart
    farm network, an indirect attack to compromise third parties is also a potential
    risk. As an example, smart farms often use third party agronomy analytics to analyze
    the collected data which can be used in many research areas such as plant biology
    and genetics, agriculture economy, supply forecasts, and disease predictions.
    Those parties might be given direct access to smart farm data on the edge for
    real-time analytics. An attacker might phish for such third parties, compromise
    their systems and inject malicious software to redirect the data sent to external
    servers for data theft. Such attacks are very hard to detect, since attackers
    are using legitimate stolen third party credentials. B. Authorization & Trust
    In smart farming applications, connected entities including autonomous tractors,
    flying drones, on field sensors etc. communicate and interact with each other,
    and issue command and control operations to provide automated and efficient experience.
    Such communication can be direct machine to machine or via a cloud or edge assisted
    network which can support Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT21), Constrained
    Application Protocol (CoAP22) or other IoT communication protocols. In either
    case, it is essential to ensure that the messages are sent from a trusted authorized
    entity, rather from a malicious adversary. This exchange of information, like
    moisture level of soil, information about crop yield, cost of fertilizer, or sensitive
    data about the livestock like health, current location, breeding decision information
    and other farm related private data sent to the cloud or to a third-party application
    must be authorized by the owner of the field or a concerned party. Livestock are
    important part of agriculture, and a big component of a farmer’s income. Sensors
    can be embedded in the cattle [41]–[43] which can monitor their health and can
    be used to remotely inject medicines or enable preventive actions from a doctor.
    Even in case of livestock purchase, buyer can be given temporary access to the
    data of an animal they are interested in, which can help them analyse it before
    purchase. As these animals are kept in monitored environments, remotely controlling
    the temperature or making adverse conditions in barn can affect the yield of animals,
    and can also result in epidemics and widespread disease. Over the air (OTA) updates
    for the equipment’s firmware must be from a trusted party, a bad software patch
    received for a critical agriculture equipment can curtail a farmer from using
    it at the needed time of harvesting and planting. Cross cloud and multi cloud
    trust models [44], [45] are needed when entities associated at different cloud
    providers interact and access data remotely. In case of a mechanic trying to diagnose
    an engine of an autonomous tractor, or a doctor trying to access data of a cattle
    located in a private cloud, trust levels need to be established so as to enable
    such access. Several access control models have been proposed for IoT [46]–[58]
    like systems, however their feasability in dynamic smart farming is still to be
    investigated. Proper authorization is needed for a farmer to issue a command,
    to a smart water sprinkler, or to fetch the latest readings from a soil moisture
    sensor. Farm rivalry can exploit such connectivity to the sensors, and may flood
    a farmer’s field, or make it parched. Usually in farms, labor is hired on a temporary
    basis mostly at the time of harvesting and sowing, therefore, temporary access
    to smart equipment can be delegated to on field workers for non-critical operations.
    It may be the case that a critical operation, like running an autonomous tractor
    on the field, or flying a drone over the field to spray pesticides may need multi
    level authorization. C. Authentication & Secure Communication One of the most
    important aspects of security and privacy in smart farming is authentication of
    connected devices. Devices need to be authenticated first in order to get connected
    to various services on a smart farming system. They are usually low power devices,
    with limited processing power, memory, and storage, so legacy public-key infrastructure
    (PKI) authentication mechanisms cannot be considered as feasible solutions. Alternatively,
    secure lightweight multi-factor authentication protocols which are offered as
    a service [13], [59] are more realistic solutions in a smart farming network environment.
    In fact, an intermediary Certifying Authority (CA) can facilitate the authentication
    of a connecting device [60]. Such authentication mechanisms do not consume devices’
    limited resources for authentication processing, but also unauthorized devices
    will be prevented from connecting and accessing the network in an efficient way
    [61]. Moreover, devices may sometime join or leave different layers of a smart
    farming ecosystem. This entails dynamic authenticated mechanisms that apply authentication
    on demand to ensure that only legitimate devices are allowed to have access to
    different services spanning over different layers. Providing end to end secure
    communication in a smart farming setting requires securing the communication between
    devices in a particular layer and also securing the inter-layer communication
    [62]. While cryptography-based solutions prove their effectiveness in securing
    both intra-layer and inter-layer communications, employing them on constrained
    IoT devices is a big concern. There are, however, limited attempts to apply lightweight
    cryptography solutions to a smart farming ecosystem [14]. Additionally, quantum-based
    cryptography for a secure end to end communication for IoT devices is under active
    investigation [63] as a futuristic solution. However, the feasibility of such
    solutions have not been evaluated in real world scenarios. D. Compliance and Regulations
    Smart farming and precision agriculture raises various legal issues, which remain
    partially unanswered. The following are some of the major issues in this area.
    1) Contracts and Agreements A smart farm involves different parties like the farmers,
    the cloud service providers, the networking infrastructure providers, to name
    a few (See Section II). These different parties need to negotiate and agree on
    various parts of contracts [12], [64]. These contracts include data privacy, security
    and intellectual property protection clauses. Data protection is essential for
    the development of smart farms and is a major part of these contracts. Such contracts
    between interested parties are crucial to protect the value and confidentiality
    of the data as an important asset. Farmers who use smart farming tools also need
    to negotiate in advance finer elements of these contracts. For example, which
    party shall be responsible in case data processing and analysis lead to wrong
    decisions affecting different downstream tasks in the pipeline. Another important
    contractual element example is the decision involving use of self-driving tractors,
    which are subject to the set of obligations applicable to self-driving cars. In
    this scenario, strong compensation and limitation of liability clauses may help
    the farmers. 2) Data Security and Privacy Farmers who deploy smart infrastructure
    fear that their data might be stolen by competitors or be publicly released. Hence,
    data security is crucial and agreements with technology providers should include
    specific clauses. Although most smart farming techniques process non-personal
    data, linking of such information to a particular personally identifiable information
    (PII) poses serious concerns [12], [64]. For example, data of livestock directly
    referring to their owner; crops conditions linked to farmers’ personal details.
    In this case, privacy clauses should be included to prohibit personal data processing
    to a certain degree. Further issues may arise when smart farming equipment, such
    as drones or tractors, have the functionality to monitor their users [12], [64].
    3) Intellectual Property (IP) An important question from a compliance perspective
    is who owns the data collected on a smart farm. This is specially important as
    data privacy laws cannot solve this issue. As per the current regulatory setup,
    data itself cannot be protected, however copyright provisions can be utilized
    to achieve high level of safeguards. Most farmers include IP protection clauses
    [64] in contracts that they create with smart farming technology providers [12].
    4) Regulatory Agriculture and livestock production is a highly regulated industry.
    Various countries across the globe have many laws, regulations, and supervisory
    authorities [65]–[67]. These touch upon specific compliance requirements for producing
    and selling of products. Such compliance can be achieved easier by using smart
    farming technology that help farmers and regulators track, audit, and inspect
    every step of the production pipeline. 5) Cyber Insurance Cyber Insurance allows
    victims to protect themselves from various cyber risks. However, cyber insurance
    policies in agriculture have lagged in the coverage of cyber incidents and events.
    Most of the current available agriculture based cyber insurances are very ambiguous
    and limited in their coverage [64]. SECTION IV. Smart Farming Ecosystem Cyber
    Attacks This section elaborates possible cyber attacks in smart farming ecosystem.
    We have categorized attacks into four different classes as shown in Figure 4.
    We have discussed data specific and network specific attacks orchestrated on smart
    farms including IoT based farming sensors. We have also explored cyber attacks
    from the supply chain side to highlight the vulnerabilities as more and more systems
    get connected to the internet and generating sensitive data. FIGURE 4. Smart farming
    ecosystem cyber attacks. Show All A. Data Attacks 1) Insider Data Leakage Farmers
    fear leakage of confidential data the most among other threats as it can be used
    against them in the commodity market. An insider (like a disgruntled employee)
    can leak such data to intentionally cause harm or sell data for money. For example,
    a former engineer at Allen and Hoshall was able to access the company’s data over
    a period of two years.23 Data this employee accessed included engineering schematic,
    project proposals, and marketing information which had an estimated value of $500,000.
    2) Cloud Data Leakage Smart farming data is very sensitive and can reveal a lot
    of confidential agriculture and economic information about the entire country.
    Cloud data centers are distributed across the world and, in some instances, virtual
    machines might be placed in data centers located in different countries. Data
    might be less secure if it is stored in data centers in other countries. These
    countries could place less strict security requirements on companies. Additionally,
    their governments might also intercept or collect that data stored on servers
    within their own jurisdictions. For these reasons, countries have started adding
    laws for sensitive data localization. For instance, China has placed a new cybersecurity
    law24 into effect in 2017 stating, among other things, that personal data must
    be stored on domestic servers. As such, companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon
    started taking steps to transfer control of Chinese data to Chinese firms. 3)
    False Data Injection Attack In this attack, an attacker attempts to change/falsify
    data that contributes to important real-time decisions, with the assumption that
    adversary has the knowledge of the system and its configuration. For example,
    injecting false information about the soil moisture level will result in over
    watering and, in turn, damaging the crops. 4) Misinformation Attack In this attack,
    the aim is to endanger data integrity. An attacker may release false data about
    a smart farm claiming the outbreak of a disease in crops or livestock. Such false
    data reports mimic the form of an actual report released by the targeted smart
    farm. As a result, it will take a lot of time, effort and money to prove that
    the released report is false. B. Networking and Equipment Attacks 1) Radio Frequency
    (FR) Jamming Attack In many cases, smart farming equipment rely on radio frequency
    communication, like cellular or satellite networks. A smart farming equipment
    often use global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) to improve efficiency with
    products and techniques such as path planning, auto steering, seeding and spray
    rates. GNSS is achieved by combining GPS with real time kinematics (RTK) technology
    to enhance the precision of real-time position data. Attackers may jam GNSS for
    malicious purpose by deploying many distributed low power jammers to disrupt GNSS
    over wide areas and, in turn, prevent smart farming equipment from functioning
    properly. 2) Malware Injection Attack One of the most prevalent threats to smart
    farming is malware injection attack [68], where an attacker injects a malware
    into a connected smart device. Malware is a very common threat in large scale
    systems since, in most cases, it acts and propagates through the system automatically,
    hence making it a very attractive target to attackers. Precision agriculture is
    being adopted widely, meaning that more farms are connected to the internet. Typically,
    most of these farm deployments use similar software components (e.g., usage of
    LoRa25 and ZigBee26). As a result, a malware that infects a particular smart farm
    will most likely infect other farms with similar deployments. The damage caused
    by malware comes in many shapes and types. Malware can steal information about
    the consumption of agricultural materials, purchase information of fruits, vegetables
    and livestock, data about agricultural machinery etc. It can also recruit smart
    devices as part of a botnet which will be used for committing malicious acts controlled
    by an attacker. Further, malware can hinder the functions of physical smart equipment
    which, in turn, can have a devastating effect on a particular crop harvest or
    farm area. 3) Denial of Service Attack IoT devices used in smart farming environments
    can always be used to launch large scale denial of service (DoS) attacks [69]
    similar to what happened in 2016 using Mirai botnet [70]. In that occasion, an
    army of dummy CCTVs was exploited to launch one of the biggest DoS attacks that
    happened recently. There are usually a large number of inter-connected nodes and
    groups in a farm, and thus, similar type of attacks are possible in context of
    smart farming. These attacks not only can disrupt normal functions of different
    modules in an individual farm but also can be leveraged to interrupt legitimate
    cyber services in other domains. 4) Botnet With IoT everything is capable of getting
    connected to the internet. In smart farming ecosystem, there are many IoT related
    devices at each architectural layer. These devices are prone to attacks and can
    then be controlled by a central malicious system. This forms a so called ‘Botnet
    of Things’ [71]. A zombie army of infected farm IoT devices [72] can easily be
    used to infect many other networks through different mediums and hence a smart
    farm may turn out to be an internet of vulnerabilities for cyber criminals. Smart
    farm devices are not built with security as a concern and even if they do, users
    usually neglect the basic steps of setting adequate cybersecurity defense mechanisms.
    5) Side Channel Attack Attacks which have their roots in gaining information from
    how a system is implemented rather than what weakness exists in the system implementation
    are called side channel attacks. Smart farming is one of the IoT use case and
    hence it inherits some common IoT vulnerabilities including side channel attacks
    [73]. In such attacks, there are different channels which can be exploited by
    attackers. In timing channel attacks, for example, computation time along with
    cache miss and cache hit timing patterns are among those attacks vectors which
    can be exploited by adversaries. Hardware glitching in forms of voltage fluctuations
    and variances in system clock period during execution tasks are other possible
    attack channels. Other channels for launching a successful attack are power consumption
    patterns, possible electromagnetic leaks or even sound and acoustic channels.
    C. Supply Chain Attacks The entire agriculture ecosystem and the notion of ‘farm
    to plate’ involves several entities which work in tandem to provide quality food
    to the end consumer in a just-in time environment. This supply chain system [74]
    starts from the farm, which produces raw material that, in turn, is stored and
    processed by the food industry. The processed food is packed and sent to distribution
    retailer from where the end customer purchases processed goods. With IoT technology
    at each stage of the supply chain, it introduces potential cybersecurity threats
    since a security breach in just-in-time distribution system could also have a
    serious cascading effects on the entire supply chain. The massive scale of attacks
    like WannaCry27 ransomware, and the recent spate of ransomwares in cities28 across
    the US, suggest that even a breach or data freeze at a single inter-dependent
    entity will be enough to disrupt the whole chain and possibly the economy of a
    country. An attack on the agriculture equipment and fertilizer provider companies
    could potentially disable critical connected machinery needed at a prime time.
    It could manipulate the amount of nutrients in the fertilizers [64] which could
    seriously destroy the crops rather than nourishing them. The smart devices can
    be infected by malware which are controlled and commanded remotely. In such a
    scenario, large scale attacks can be orchestrated on all the smart farms utilizing
    those compromised machinery resulting in massive disruption in the sector. Needless
    to say that the suppliers of such machinery might loose trust and confidence of
    their customers. Such smart machinery needs dynamic calibration to determine the
    distance at which seeds need to be planted or the amount of fertilizers to be
    sprayed based on historical crop data. This calibration related information is
    uploaded in the machine software over-the-air (OTA), which suggests that deliberate
    uploading of false information to the machine software can have larger scale impact.
    US Foods29 has more than 250,000 customers which purchase supplies, will be affected
    badly if US Foods IT infrastructure is hit by a ransomware or a cyber attack disrupting
    its computer assisted facility and impacting critical processes. Temperature and
    conditions under which the produce is transferred is an important factor to maintain
    the freshness of the product. Smart monitors ensure that products are processed
    and packed at appropriate temperatures. Adversaries can manipulate these sensor
    readings or issue a command to change the temperature that could result in inappropriate
    temperature conditions for produce, which can impact the end consumers as well
    as the entire supply chain. These attacks are not limited to direct stakeholders,
    but for example, contaminated water from a compromised water treatment facility
    used in irrigation can destroy the whole crop field. Even attacks on smart grid
    due to sudden surge in demand and grid overloading can result in blackout which
    in-turn can spoil the stored produce in large storage houses, inducing huge losses
    to the supplier. Blockchain30 based solutions have been proposed to ensure the
    provenance of the food products in the chain, which offers transparency and assure
    quality of the food. However, the entire cost to use this system will not be clear
    unless widely adopted [75]. Smart farming goes beyond agriculture where livestock
    sector is also considered an important part. An attack on this sector can also
    have massive disruptions, where a malicious actor can publish false data about
    a disease outbreaks or unapproved genetic modifications of crops. Similarly, sensors
    and smart devices in the buildings where these livestock are kept can be attacked
    or altered to change the temperature, which can put to harm the entire livestock
    on the farm. Also, for livestock feed products, if an IT system monitoring the
    ingredients of the feed is compromised, it can potentially lead to wide-spread
    contamination in livestock which can easily reach humans as well. D. Other Relevant
    Attacks 1) Compliance and Regulation Food production and farming are a highly
    regulated industry with different countries having multiple national agencies
    monitoring food production. In the United States, Environment Protection Agency
    [65] and the Department of Agriculture [66] enforce various regulations and industry
    standards. In the European Union, Department of Agriculture and Rural Development
    [67] undertakes this responsibility with similar authorities in other countries.
    These federal authorities issue compliance directives to ensure quality food production.
    With the advent of smart farming technology these agencies are relying more and
    more on data produced by farm based sensors. An adversary attacking a smart farm
    can specifically inject false data that will then impact various compliance certification
    processes. This certification process if invalidated, can impact a nation’s food
    supply, affect crop price, etc. The complex smart farming ecosystem, creates a
    broad attack surface that needs to be protected to ensure data integrity. 2) Cyber
    Terrorism The increased use of digital interconnected system in agriculture sector
    brings new opportunities for terrorists to attack places that previously were
    too remote or difficult to strike. Cyber terrorism is a relatively low-cost venture
    with high payoff potential, making the risks of agro-terrorism too large to ignore.
    Therefore, it is important to find solutions that guarantee trust and transparency
    within smart farming concept, as well as protect critical resources. 3) Cloud
    Computing Attacks Cloud is a very diverse, decentralized, heterogeneous and powerful
    ecosystem. The enormous amount of distributed resources make the cloud a hard
    target. However, with the introduction of new cloud concepts (e.g., on-demand
    services, auto-scaling, and self provisioning), attackers have used such resources
    in their favor and, in turn, cloud has become one of the most desirable targets
    to attacker. For example, with the introduction of auto-scaling in cloud, a large
    part of the virtual machines hosted on cloud are similarly configured. If one
    of the virtual machines is vulnerable, it is highly likely that all auto-scaled
    virtual machines are vulnerable as well. As such, a malware that infected one
    virtual machine can propagate to other virtual machines quickly. The infected
    machines can be employed as a part of global botnets which, consequently, can
    be used to launch a large scale distribute DoS (DDoS) attacks enough to hinder
    the functionality of cloud. For example, in 2018, a large scale DDoS attack was
    launched on github resulting in a record-breaking sudden traffic increase to 1.35
    terabits per second. Inevitably, DDoS attacks are becoming more frequent, more
    powerful and more sophisticated. A large scale DDoS attack with an overwhelming
    number of requests, packets or messages can deny services to smart farms, thereby
    paralyzing the brain of smart farms. Further, DDoS attacks might not be specifically
    targeting smart farms’ virtual machines. Even though, an attack might be directed
    at a different target, if virtual machines used by smart farms are on the save
    physical server, it will naturally block off other’s traffic as well. SECTION
    V. Existing Research Table 1 summarizes state-of-the-art research, challenges
    and contributions with respect to security and privacy issues in smart farming.
    We have categorized the literature into different subsections based on the focus
    areas they address. TABLE 1 Projects and Research Addressing Cybersecurity in
    Smart Farming A. Cyber Attacks, Threats and Proposed Solutions Researchers and
    federal agencies have started gauging the impact cyber-attacks as more and more
    farmers and communities are adopting technologies in the farms. The U.S. Department
    for Homeland Security released a report [12] which emphasizes the importance of
    precision agriculture (PA) and associated cybersecurity threat and potential vulnerabilities.
    The report highlights the confidentiality, integrity, and availability model of
    information security in farming. It defines different technologies involved in
    PA including in-farm devices, location and remote sensing technologies, machine
    learning, etc. It briefly discusses the impacted groups by the misuse of technologies
    in farming including farmers, livestock producers, and also industries that support
    or rely on agriculture. This report also discusses hypothetical threat scenarios
    on real life examples. Another promising work [76] highlights the vulnerabilities
    and risks due to introduction of technologies in the field of precision agriculture.
    This thesis work illustrates data collection and related empirical study, however
    falls short of security solutions in the domain. The work from Jahn [64] discuss
    implications of using smart devices in the agriculture sector. The authors make
    strong argument about how the lack of a cyber insurance framework is going to
    have a big impact on various agribusinesses. They also highlight the fact that
    a regulatory response is needed to protect the interests of farmers who adopt
    the use of smart devices. Barreto and Amaral [77] use empirical methodology based
    on the analysis of information and experiences collected in the Internet Security
    Alliance,31 the European Cyber Security Organization32 and the National Institute
    of Standards and Technology33 to highlight security challenges in smart farming.
    Some major threats discussed include security and privacy issues, social engineering,
    denial of service, cyber-espionage agroterrorism, ransomware etc. The research
    also highlights a security framework to enable farmers to better understand security
    implications. However, the paper is unable to discuss open research issues, and
    challenges to secure the environment without evidence of how the discussed attacks
    are orchestrated in the domain. Peer to Peer (P2P) is a network paradigm which
    has use cases in smart farming communication. The device authentication methods
    in this type of communication, however, rely heavily on public key infrastructure.
    Although the system is trustworthy, it puts unnecessary computation load on resource
    constrained smart farm IoT devices participating in a secure P2P communication.
    Accordingly, authors in [78] proposed a lightweight device authentication solution
    in which session keys and public keys are combined to expedite the encryption/decryption
    tasks. It results in a fast and light-weight authentication solution which is
    a good fit for smart farming communication purposes. Additionally, West [79] introduced
    a framework to understand vulnerabilities in emerging technologies and the use
    of such technologies in a smart-farming-specific environment. The framework goal
    is to quantify the degree to which the use of smart farming new technologies are
    vulnerable to cyber-attacks. It uses the common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS)
    for the threat prediction model assessment. The work shows the trade-offs between
    technology maturity and adaptation in the smart farming environment which can
    lead to system compromise. The approach in the paper uses three parameters: basic
    parameters, temporal parameters and environmental parameters for constructing
    a CVSS score. Basic parameters indicate the intrinsic and severity of a vulnerability,
    whereas temporal parameters indicate how a vulnerability might change and affect
    the system over time due to technical changes. Environmental parameters reflect
    the specifications of a vulnerability present in a smart-farming-specific environment.
    Although CVSS score has become a standard in the industry for understanding the
    severity of vulnerabilities and prioritizing their patches, it has some shortcomings.
    Smart farming is a diverse environment with many connected devices and systems.
    CVSS score deals with individual vulnerabilities and fails to accurately capture
    impact of connections within the entire system. B. Blockchain Related Research
    Recently, the usefulness of blockchain in domains other than cryptocurrency and
    financial transactions has been acknowledged [93]–[95]. Agriculture and food supply
    chain is one of the domains in which blockchain technology has shown its capabilities.
    Accordingly, the authors in [81] study overall implications, challenges and potential
    of existing blockchain-based projects in the field. Besides, it critically reviews
    maturity of such projects and elaborates on possible barriers and challenges,
    which hinder acceptability of such projects among farmers and existing cyber farming
    systems. Lin et al. [80] also focused on the use of blockchain technology for
    food safety. Authors created a system that tracks and monitors food production
    cycle, including the processes of raw materials, cultivation/breeding, processing,
    transporting, warehousing, and selling. The system also uses various IoT based
    sensors to replace manual recording and verification with sensor based verification.
    Other works [82], [84], [96] focused on providing case studies of using blockchain
    and smart contracts in smart farming. Awan et al. [82] proposed a framework based
    on IoT and blockchain technology for agriculture product tracking life cycle.
    They used smart contracts to eliminate the involvement of middlemen or third-party
    intermediaries and as such increase credibility and trust. The authors implemented
    a use case based on their proposed framework which included 120 IoT nodes and
    20 blockchain producers. Further, they validated their system based on it’s throughput
    considering different block sizes. However, this work has several drawbacks. Very
    few related works are included and comparison to other works in the literature
    is lacking. Additionally, the authors didn’t include much details about the nature
    of workload used in their experiments and they failed to add a baseline benchmark
    for the validation results for a fair comparison. Patil et al. [84] proposed a
    light-weight security framework for smart greenhouse farms based on blockchain.
    Every IoT node can elect cluster head leader which helps preventing a single point
    of failure in case an attacker targets the leader node. Additionally, the authors
    provided discussion of the security threats on their proposed framework following
    the traditional confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA) triad model
    as well as their corresponding attacks. Although, this work is interesting, the
    framework is conceptual with no implementation or experiments. Further, the paper
    didn’t include related work nor a comparison to other proposed frameworks. Besides
    proposing blockchain-based frameworks and implementations [97], real world use
    cases of blockchain in smart farming are discussed in the blockchain research
    institute article [83]. In this work, authors explore applications of blockchain
    beyond the typical financial use cases in agriculture. Accordingly, they focused
    on three classes of applications: food safety, sustainable agriculture and the
    local economy and agriculture finance. The authors accompanied each class of applications
    with real world use cases. However, these use cases are discussed on a very high
    level aspect with no implementation details or results. C. AI and Machine Learning
    Assisted Work The advent of new age technologies such as artificial intelligence
    (AI) and machine learning (ML) not only facilitate the adaptation of advanced
    analytics in smart farming, but also create an ecosystem for improving the cybersecurity
    of services. Fusion of these technologies enable farmers to achieve higher average
    yield and better price control over their products in highly competitive markets.
    Design and implementation of a low cost IoT based security monitoring system have
    been proposed by Shabadi and Biradar [85]. The system focuses on physical layer
    of smart farming where it collects data from sensors. This data is sent to a controller
    where data is analyzed to make decisions like activating the actuators for water
    sprinkler in the farms. The proposed work is focused more on implementing the
    basic functionalities of smart farming than addressing security and privacy issues.
    It is very limited to simple threshold based decisions, like, if the soil temperature
    is above a certain threshold, then activate water sprinkler. Real time security
    monitoring for a remote farm is another current application of ML in smart farming.
    In scenarios where real time monitoring and notifications are paramount to farm
    and cybersecurity, the image(s) detected through a surveillance system can be
    processed by open-source computer vision programming supported by AI. For example,
    Abuan et al. [86] proposed a neural based face recognition system which is able
    to be invariant to changes in illumination for background and illumination conditions
    through a neural network training. The agricultural and farming industries have
    been widely influenced by the disruption of the IoT. However, the impact of the
    IoT is limited in countries with less penetration of mobile internet. The boom
    of low-power wide-area networks (LPWAN) in the last decade, with technologies
    such as LoRa or NB-IoT, has mitigated this by providing a relatively cheap infrastructure
    that enables low-power and long-range transmissions. Nonetheless, the benefits
    that LPWAN technologies have the disadvantage of low-bandwidth transmissions.
    Therefore, the integration of edge and fog computing, moving data analytics and
    compression near end devices, is key in order to extend functionality. By integrating
    AI at the local network layer, referred as edge AI, authors in [87] proposed a
    system architecture and implementation that expands the possibilities of smart
    agriculture and farming applications with edge and fog computing using LPWAN technology
    for large area coverage. In another research work [88], Support Vector Machines
    (SVM) along with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are used to create an integration
    platform for big data analysis for smart farming. Such a platform not only expedites
    processing huge amounts of data collected from farms and livestocks, but also
    gives smart farming stakeholders the ability to detect and respond against possible
    cyber attacks more efficiently. D. Other Relevant Literature Chi et al. [89] present
    a framework for cybersecurity approaches in precision agriculture and discussed
    challenges of using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) in digital virtual farms. They
    also present a framework for secure data capture. Security challenges in agrifood
    sector has been extensively discussed in [90]. The report provides an overview
    of emerging technologies in smart farming. Most smart farms are data-driven with
    respect to automating agriculture processes, decision making, and predictions.
    It also raises important questions of how important is data security? How risk
    assessment is done considering the entire supply chain? Who should take responsibility
    and who should be involved? The report serves to raise awareness addressing the
    importance of cybersecurity in agrifood sector. Authors in [98] provide an overview
    of cross-section of cybersecurity in food and agriculture sectors. They also discuss
    cyber-terrorism, policies, and plans. Spaulding and Wolf [99] detail the needs
    for educating farmers about various cybersecurity threats. Authors in [100] show
    the impact of cyber attacks on smart farming infrastructure via simulations using
    NETA with OMNET++ framework. Huning et al. [101] created a system to enable privacy
    preserving crowd sourcing techniques to estimate different smart farming parameters.
    Cybersecurity perception is also changing among farmers and agribusiness owners.
    Geil et al. [91] conducted an assessment of cybersecurity practices in the United
    States agriculture industry. Insights from their work reflect that over half of
    the respondents have been victims of a computer security incident, demonstrating
    that even individuals working in agriculture can be impacted by cybersecurity
    incidents. Cyberbiosecurity [92] is a multidisciplinary domain consists of cybersecurity,
    bio-security, and cyber-physical security. It discusses how current and emerging
    information technologies affect the cybersecurity of large portion of U.S. economy
    which is based on food and agriculture (i.e. Bio-economy). As Peccoud et al. [102]
    discuss, food and agricultural sectors are immensely diverse and require advanced
    technologies and efficiencies that rely on computer technologies, big data, cloud-based
    data storage, and internet accessibility, at the same time are vulnerable to cybersecurity
    incidents. Based on our literature review, it can be emphasised that, there is
    a dearth of security related research done in smart farming domain. There are
    numerous unanswered important security questions and open research challenges
    as discussed in the following section. SECTION VI. Open Challenges and Research
    Areas This section discusses open research challenges for improving security and
    privacy in smart farming ecosystem, as well illustrated in Figure 5. These open
    problems have been divided into four subsections as follows. FIGURE 5. Open research
    challenges and future directions for cybersecurity in smart farming. Show All
    A. Access Control, Trust & Privacy Perspective The multi-layered architecture
    discussed in section II recognizes possibilities of cyber threat challenges, which
    needs to be addressed by extending and adapting current access control foundational
    research, as well as developing sophisticated access control solutions to assist
    dynamic and agile environments in cyber-physical systems like smart farms. In-farm
    and cross farm operations need authorized interaction among sensors and labor/farmers
    working at multiple farms operating different sets of smart devices. What kind
    of operations they can do must be checked, which may require single level or multiple
    level access control depending on the risk factor associated with the operation?
    For example, consider sowing the field with autonomous tractor as compared to
    turning ON an irrigation system during the rainy season. Delegation and revocation
    of access rights to operate on a farm must be automatically performed based on
    the contract agreement, for example, in case temporary labor hired during harvesting
    season. Such access control requirements need further investigation to be adopted
    in such dynamic environment. The notion of trust can also be developed where labor
    who has worked earlier or an equipment borrowed from a ‘known’ old friend may
    have higher trust level as compared to machine and manpower hired from co-operative
    market. Self-configurable AI assisted smart access control policies need to be
    developed in a sharing-dominated CPS domain like smart farming. Cyber physical
    systems introduce the notion of virtual objects (which can be created in cloud
    or edge environment) corresponding to real physical sensors. An important challenge
    here is the location of cyber entities created as a part of connection with cloud
    or edge environments, for example, AWS device shadows34 or Microsoft Azure device
    twins.35 Research needs to determine: a) how cyber entity will move from one cloud
    (or edge) to another if the corresponding device is borrowed from one farmer to
    another? b) how the control of virtual entities will be delegated to the lending
    farmer, whether both the farmers need to use same application? c) how the applications
    will allow to delegate access for machine operation? d) Can the virtual objects
    or equipment across farms communicate with each other, whether at the physical
    level or using the virtual entities? If it is the virtual entity across different
    accounts in the same cloud provider, how such interaction will take place? In
    case it is across different cloud providers, how cross cloud and federated cloud
    environments will ensure such trust levels? Suppose in case a farmer has borrowed
    an equipment from a friend farmer, will the original owner be able to have access
    to it, or the access will be completely revoked? Is it possible to control a device
    through different remote clouds? All are relevant questions in smart farming domain.
    Further, how to establish trust mechanisms among different cloud service providers
    which the farmer is using for services and alerts? Manufacturer of the device
    may hold digital twin [103] and the cloud used by farmers will get data from on-field
    sensor and the cloud provider via pre-defined and signed negotiations. Such negotiations
    can also define what kind of data will be shared with required permissions of
    the owner farmer. Another important question is, how to establish trust between
    physical sensor objects? One approach is sensors at the same farm trust each other
    more for the shared information as compared to sensors across different farms.
    IoT and CPS specific cross cloud access controls and related security models are
    still in infancy stage and need more attention. Livestock and animals also have
    sensors embedded, which require appropriate authorized access. However, current
    literature does not provide strong access control mechanisms that can restrict
    such operations and secure critical data sharing from cattle and livestock at
    the farm. These wearable and health monitoring devices are attached to livestock
    and collect sensitive data, which can be used by adversaries to control the animal
    or even effect the sale/purchase of a cattle, for example, having the information
    about which cow is having low milk production. Efficient access controls [104]–[106]
    are needed to safeguard such sensitive data in cloud, which needs more research
    considering the spate of breaches heard every now and then. Usually in case of
    wearable IoT devices, a human which has the device controls what kind of data
    he/she wants to be shared. However, it is not in case of livestock which has a
    master (like the owner of the farm or caretaker) to decide control. Also, as a
    cattle is sold/purchased and moves from one owner to another, relevant data sharing
    security policies need to be specified and will require automatically configured
    information sharing. Studies [107], [108] have shown vulnerabilities in human
    used fitness devices, however, such studies and research are still an open challenge
    in case of livestock devices. Since data is collected from smart devices spread
    across farms, different applications require to access to this data. Consequentially,
    it is important to limit the sharing of data across applications and across nearby
    friend farmers, who may also get some value or receive alerts for their farms.
    How and when to share such information requires adaptive security policies to
    control and supervise data transferred by sensors to the cloud platform. Further,
    if data is sharing across multi cloud systems, cross cloud trust also needs to
    be addressed. Appropriate attribute based fine grained access controls [109],
    [110] and privacy preserving schemes need to be deployed to ensure confidentiality
    of the data. Evidently, farmers must decide the level and type of data sharing
    needed to ensure the privacy of critical information. B. Data Perspective The
    most noticeable feature of smart farming is its communication ability between
    the smart devices, resulting in an unprecedented amount of generated data [7],
    [111]. This provides many challenges as discussed in section III and open doors
    for several research opportunities. Machine learning is an attractive solution
    for processing big data, and implementing effective security solutions. Insider
    data leakage detection has always been a daunting task as users already have legitimate
    access to the system, making it hard to detect and predict such attacks. Several
    research works have been conducted on insider data leakage [22], [112], [113];
    however, none has been targeting smart farming settings. Further investigation
    is needed to understand the possibility of adopting insider data leakage defense
    mechanisms into smart farming and whether unique characteristics of smart farming
    can help to improve these mechanisms. Smart farms are highly connected systems,
    which allow malware to easily propagate through the network infecting all interconnected
    devices. An interesting question is how to detect malware in smart farming IoT
    environment, especially considering all heterogeneous devices in place. For instance,
    a malware detection technique that works against a malware that infects smart
    farming equipment might not work against malware that infects edge or cloud systems
    since the malware’s end goal is different. Many AI assisted malware detection
    techniques [114]–[120] are proposed and used in practice; however, there are no
    smart-farming-specific malware detection techniques that consider the context
    and environment in which smart farms reside. Smart farms generate diverse and
    vast amount of unstructured data. It is almost impossible for one party to analyze
    and make use of the entire datasets. For this reason, threat information sharing
    is a viable approach for data security. For instance, each smart farm can employ
    a malware detection technique; however, it is guaranteed that none of these employed
    techniques is comprehensive enough to catch all types of malware. Information
    sharing between smart farms can prove very useful. It can be used as an asset
    to share threat information about attack patterns or malware that was detected
    by collaborating smart farms. In a similar case, if a deployed detection technique
    in a farm detected supplied water with high toxin content, it is relevant to share
    that information with nearby farms who may also be impacted by similar issue.
    This can save analysis cost and money for every participating smart farm as it
    prevents doing work that someone else already did before. What kind of data, meta-data
    or analysis can be shared remains an open question and what kind of threat information
    sharing process can be used remain an open question for resource constrained farmers.
    Smart farming is an emerging field, so it is highly likely to encounter zero-day
    attacks which have not been detected before. Anomaly detection [121]–[125] is
    a very appealing solution against such attacks. Anomaly detection techniques look
    for any abnormal behavior that deviates from the pre-established database of normal
    behavior. These normal behaviour profiles are constructed based on collection
    of historical observations and patterns. Building smart farms behavior profiles
    is a challenging task since their behaviors are so dynamic in nature. External
    factors are a major reason for this dynamism. For example, less irrigation is
    needed during a rainy weather than dry weather which will cause a different behavior
    for irrigation systems. Can weather forecast information be used as an indication
    of such change of behavior? What kind of data contribute to building smart farms
    behavior profiles? Do some data fields weigh more than others? These are all open
    research questions that need to be investigated. Detection mechanisms are used
    to detect faulty and compromised sensors by monitoring the data sent for any tampered
    or abnormal values. Employing a simple threshold based mechanism can easily be
    bypassed by an attacker, so in most cases, more sophisticated machine learning
    based mechanisms need to be deployed. However, smart attackers can still bypass
    these models by (1) exploiting the sensors and a little tweaking of data sent
    by these sensors just to lead the machine learning model in place to misclassify/mispredict
    the outcome (such attack is called adversarial machine learning attack), and (2)
    poisoning the model during training phase by injecting bad data into the model’s
    training database, and in turn get it to learn something it shouldn’t. Some research
    addressed mitigation against adversarial attacks; however, it is not clear whether
    these technologies can be adopted to smart farming domain which is very dominant
    on changing environment conditions. Another open research challenge is to create
    various artificial intelligence systems that collect and parse Cyber Threat Intelligence
    (CTI36) about smart devices, software, cloud systems etc. used in the smart farming
    ecosystem. These systems have been developed to collect CTI in other areas [126]–[129]
    and need to be extended to ensure coverage of various smart farming devices, equipment
    and software. C. Network Perspective Cybersecurity threats to smart farming and
    its devices include a diverse range of security risks due to certain characteristics
    of the underlying networking and communication technologies which are used in
    the domain. First, both virtual and physical communication environments get connected.
    Many IoT devices in a smart farm system are capable of functioning on the data
    they receive from their respective environments which shortens the distance between
    virtual and physical systems. While convenient for the users, it allows cyber
    threats to convert to physical consequences more quickly, thereby having a bigger
    impact. Second, devices and layers involved in a smart farm system create a complex
    communication environment. Hyper connected farming environments exist due to the
    growing availability and diversity of IoT devices. ‘Complex’ in this context means
    that large number of devices are working in a single smart farm environment such
    that dynamic interactions between them are possible. This complexity expands the
    capabilities of an environment, but at the cost of a wider attack surface. Smart
    farming like other emerging technologies is embracing new networking paradigms
    to tackle today’s sophisticated attacks. Software defined network (SDN) [130]–[132]
    is one such promising networking revolution. Through decoupling control plane
    from data plane and giving credit to network programmable, it offers interesting
    technical capabilities to network providers. This causes an intense adaption of
    SDN in almost every fields of networking, from data center networks to WANs, wireless,
    5G and recently IoT. Using SDN in smart farm networking is attracting to both
    academia and industry for certain reasons. SDN supports both physical and virtual
    networking scenarios very well. It also offers a reliable way of practicing networking
    in highly diverse and naturally heterogeneous smart farms networking environment.
    Moreover, using SDN, smart farms are able to form a holistic view of all the connected
    devices along with how they interact in a near real time manner. Such a holistic
    view not only improves agility, scalability, and manageability of smart farm networking
    but also empowers a large smart farm network to enforce robust security counter
    measure against possible sophisticated cyber attacks. It is important to research
    further the adaptability of SDN and other 5G related next generation communication
    technologies in smart farming and precision agriculture domain. SDN can enable
    smart farms to get the most benefit out of complex machine learning and AI algorithms
    to automate network management of large number of sensors, wireless and wired
    networks used in a smart farming ecosystem. It also facilitates implementing advanced,
    cross-layer network security solutions which are very time and resource consuming,
    if not impossible, otherwise. Finally, SDN expedites edge networking and hence
    cloud-based security-as-a-service delivery model becomes a more approachable solution
    in large smart farming deployments. D. Compliance and Supply Chain Perspective
    With the ubiquitous use of sensors, automated drones, blockchain, artificial intelligence
    integration, different agricultural businesses are falling back on compliance,
    regulation and cyber insurance to protect themselves [64]. With the development
    of targeted malware and other cyber threats, the entire food supply chain is at
    risk [12], [64]. A hostile actor specifically interested in disrupting the supply
    chain can target various organizations and companies that supply raw material
    to farms or process food for the end user. A potential solution to this problem
    is to develop industry standards that enable trust between various raw material
    suppliers and downstream food processors [64]. The development of these standards
    enforced by national governments through regulation, has been slow. One example
    of such a shortcoming, is the existence of a few cybersecurity standards for the
    many smart devices used in the food supply chain. Various legislation are being
    introduced to set ‘minimal cybersecurity operational standards for internet connected
    devices’. In specific cases where various governments do not wish to regulate
    these interactions, it is up to various agriculture businesses to protect themselves
    by asking their supply chain to ‘self-regulate’ cybersecurity best practices [64].
    Such developments can be pushed through market demands, competitive pressure,
    etc. The food supply chain also lacks robust cyber insurance policies. With the
    constant development of smart applications, AI, smart farming equipment, etc.
    cyber insurance providers are unable to predict and quantify various cyber risks
    involved in these systems. Specific research needs to be done so as to develop
    standard legal jargon and metrics to quantify cyber risk in smart farming. These
    will help create robust cyber insurance markets for precision agriculture. Various
    systems [133]–[136] also need to be built to make it easier for the end users
    to understand and parse these complex legal documents, cyber insurance policies,
    agreements, contracts, etc. Research on these open challenges will help wide adoption
    of precision agriculture technologies. SECTION VII. Conclusion The proliferation
    of smart devices with communication and sensing capabilities have unleashed plethora
    of user services, and at the same time made tasks more convenient and efficient
    for humans. However, wide adoption of such internet connected devices and data
    driven applications across various domains have raised security and privacy issues,
    making these systems vulnerable to cyber-attacks. This paper discusses such cybersecurity
    challenges in smart farming and elaborates open research questions. The paper
    first outlines a multi-layer smart farming architecture illustrating different
    entities pertinent to real time use-cases supported by edge and cloud environments.
    Based on the architecture, the paper outlines security and privacy issues and
    highlights different attacks scenarios in smart farms as well as scenarios affecting
    the entire food supply chain. Thereafter, this article surveys the state-of-the-art
    research and acknowledges important works related to cybersecurity in the domain.
    Finally, the paper illustrates several open challenges and research problems pertinent
    to security and privacy aspects in precision agriculture. We envision this paper
    will simulate research to solve platitude of security and data privacy issues
    in fast growing and economically important smart farming sector. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

    Abstract: Smart farming is a development that has emphasized information and communication

    technology used in machinery, equipment, and sensors in network-based hi-tech
    farm supervision

    cycles. Innovative technologies, the Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud computing
    are anticipated

    to inspire growth and initiate the use of robots and artiﬁcial intelligence in
    farming. Such ground-

    breaking deviations are unsettling current agriculture approaches, while also
    presenting a range of

    challenges. This paper investigates the tools and equipment used in applications
    of wireless sensors

    in IoT agriculture, and the anticipated challenges faced when merging technology
    with conventional

    farming activities. Furthermore, this technical knowledge is helpful to growers
    during crop periods

    from sowing to harvest; and applications in both packing and transport are also
    investigated.

    1. Introduction

    Sustainable agriculture is a measure of the endurance and sustenance of food grains

    produced in an eco-friendly manner [1]. Sustainable agriculture helps in the encourage-

    ment of farming practices and approaches to help sustain farmers and resources.
    It is

    economically feasible and maintains soil quality, reduces soil degradation, saves
    water

    resources, improves land biodiversity, and ensures a natural and healthy environment
    [2].

    Sustainable agriculture plays a signiﬁcant role in preserving natural resources,
    halting

    biodiversity loss, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions [3].

    Sustainable agriculture farming is a method of preserving nature without compromis-

    ing the future generation’s basic needs, whilst also improving the effectiveness
    of farming.

    The basic accomplishments of smart farming in terms of sustainable agriculture
    are crop ro-

    tation, the control of nutrient deﬁciency in crops, the control of pests and diseases,
    recycling,

    and water harvesting, leading to an overall safer environment. Living organisms
    depend

    on the nature of biodiversity, and are contaminated by waste emissions, the use
    of fertilizers

    and pesticides, degraded dead plants, etc. The emission of greenhouse gases affects
    plants,

    animals, humans, and the environment; hence, it necessitates a better environment
    for

    living things [4] (Figure 1).

    Agriculture is the largest contributor in India, with an 18% gross domestic product

    involving approximately 57% of people in rural areas. Over the years, although
    India’s

    total agronomic output has increased, the number of growers has fallen from 71.9%
    in 1951

    to 45.1% in 2011 [5]. The Economic Survey 2018 revealed that the number of agricultural

    workers in the total workforce will drop to 25.7% in 2050. In rural areas, farming
    families

    gradually lose the next generation of farmers, overwhelmed by higher costs of
    cultivation,

    low per capita productivity, inadequate soil maintenance, and migrations to a
    non-farming

    or higher remunerative occupation. Presently, the world is on the verge of a digital

    revolution, and so it is the appropriate time to connect the agricultural landform
    with

    wireless technology to introduce and accommodate digital connectivity with farmers.

    Figure 1. Factors of sustainable agriculture.

    Regrettably, not all parts of the Earth’s surface are suitable for agriculture
    due to

    various restrictions, such as: soil quality, topography, temperature, climate,
    and most

    relevant cultivable areas are also not homogenous [6]. Further, existing farming
    land is

    fragmented by political and ﬁscal features, and rapid urbanization, which consistently

    increases pressure on arable land availability (Figure 2). Recently, total agricultural
    land

    used for food production has declined [7]. Furthermore, every crop ﬁeld has different

    critical characteristics, such as soil type, ﬂow of irrigation, presence of nutrients,
    and pest

    resistance, which are all measured separately both in quality and quantity regarding
    a

    speciﬁc crop. Both spatial and temporal differences are necessary for optimizing
    crop

    production in the same ﬁeld by crop rotation and an annual crop growth development

    cycle [8].

    Figure 2. Key issues of technology in the agriculture industry.

    In most cases, variations in characteristics occur within a single crop, or the
    same

    crop is grown on the whole farm and requires site-speciﬁc analyses for optimum
    yield

    production. New technology-based approaches are needed to produce more from less
    land,

    and to address these various issues. In traditional farming practices, farmers
    frequently

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    3 of 26

    visit their ﬁelds throughout the crop’s life in routine farming activities to
    better understand

    the crop conditions [9]. The current sensor and communication technologies offer
    an precise

    view of the ﬁeld, from which farmers can detect ongoing ﬁeld activities without
    being in

    the ﬁeld in person. Wireless sensors monitor the crops with higher accuracy and
    detect

    issues at early stages, often facilitating the use of smart tools from initial
    sowing to the

    harvest of crops [10].

    The timely use of sensors has made the entire farming operation smart and cost-

    effective, due to precise monitoring. The various autonomous harvesters, robotic
    weeders,

    and drones have sensors attached to collect data over short intervals. However,
    the vastness

    of agriculture puts extreme demands on technological solutions for sustainability
    with

    minimum ecological impact. Sensor technology through wireless communication helps

    farmers to know the various needs and requirements of crops without being in the
    ﬁelds,

    and they are then able to take remote action [11].

    2. Smart Farming

    Historically, ancient agriculture practices were related to the production of
    food in

    cultivated lands for the survival of humans and the breeding of animals [12],
    and was

    called the traditional agricultural era 1.0. This mainly resorted to using manpower
    and

    animals. Simple tools were used for farming activities, such as sickles and shovels.
    Work

    was mainly conducted through manual labor, and subsequently, productivity continued
    at

    a low level (Figure 3).

    Figure 3. Agricultural decision support system framework.

    During the 19th Century, new types of machinery appeared in the agricultural indus-

    tries, in the form of steam engines. The wide use of agricultural machinery and
    abundant

    chemicals by farmers signaled the start of the agricultural era 2.0, and outwardly
    improved

    effectiveness and productivity of farmers and farms. However, considerably harmful
    impli-

    cations, such as chemical pollution, environmental devastation, waste of natural
    resources,

    and excess utilization of energy, simultaneously developed.

    The agricultural era 3.0 emerged during the 20th Century, due to the rapid growth
    of

    computation and electronics. Robotic techniques, programed agricultural machinery,
    and

    other technologies enhanced the agricultural processes efﬁciently. The issues
    that had arisen

    during agricultural era 2.0 were solved, and policies were readapted to the agricultural
    era

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    4 of 26

    3.0 through work distribution, precise irrigation, the reduced use of chemicals,
    site-speciﬁc

    nutrient application, and efﬁcient pest control technologies, etc.

    The next agricultural era is also the current iteration of agriculture, the agricultural

    era 4.0, involving the engagement of recent technologies, such as the Internet
    of Things, big

    data analysis, artiﬁcial intelligence, cloud computing and remote sensing, etc.
    The adop-

    tion of new technologies has signiﬁcantly improved agricultural activities by
    developing

    low-cost sensor and network platforms, aimed towards the optimization of production

    efﬁciency, along with reductions in the usage of water resources and energy with
    minimum

    environmental effects [13]. Big data in smart farming provides extrapolative overviews
    of

    real-time agricultural situations, allowing farmers to make effective decisions
    [14]. Real-

    time programming is developed with artiﬁcial intelligence concepts and embedded
    in IoT

    devices, helping farmers make the most suitable decisions [15].

    Smart farming promotes precision agriculture with modern, sophisticated technology

    and enables farmers to remotely monitor the plants. Smart farming helps agricultural
    pro-

    cesses, such as harvesting and crop yields, as the automation of sensors and machinery
    has

    made the farming workforce more efﬁcient [16]. The technologies convert traditional
    farm-

    ing methods to automatic devices, causing a technological revolution in agriculture.
    Today,

    the technology in agriculture has altered the way farming is conducted, and conventional

    techniques have been transformed by the Internet of Things [17].

    In terms of optimizing farm labor requirements and increasing the quantity and

    quality of products, smart farming is an emerging modern technique implemented
    with

    information and communication technologies (ICT) [16]. Modern ICT technologies,
    such

    as the Internet of Things, GPS (Global Positioning Systems), sensors, robotics,
    drones,

    precision equipment, actuators, and data analytics, are used to identify the farmers’
    needs

    and select suitable solutions to their problems. These innovations increase the
    accuracy

    and timeliness of decisions taken, and improve crop productivity. Several multilateral

    organizations and developing countries around the world have proposed smart farming

    technologies to increase agricultural output [18].

    Sensors are constantly monitoring crops with greater accuracy, detecting any undesir-

    able conditions during the early stages of the crop’s lifecycle. Current farming
    incorporates

    smart tools from crop sowing to harvest, storing, and conveyance. The appropriate
    use of a

    wide variety of sensors has made the entire operation both more efﬁcient and proﬁtable,

    due to its accurate monitoring competencies. In addition, sensors that collect
    data quickly

    are directly available online for further evaluation, and they provide crop and
    site-speciﬁc

    agriculture for every site.

    The many issues related to crop production are addressed by smart agriculture
    and

    monitoring, particularly regarding changes in soil characteristics, climate factors,
    soil mois-

    ture, etc., to improve the spatial management practices that increase crop production
    and

    avoid the excess use of fertilizers and pesticides [19]. The ANN models in smart
    irrigation

    water management (SIWM) regulate irrigation scheduling support systems (DSS) and
    offer

    data on irrigation efﬁciency, water productivity index, and irrigation water demand
    and

    supply on a real-time basis. Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is an upcoming technology,

    especially in developing countries, due to its potential to improve food security,
    farm

    system resilience, and lower greenhouse gas emissions [20]. Smart agriculture
    technology

    based on IoT technologies has many advantages in all agricultural processes and
    practices

    in real-time, including irrigation, plant protection, improving product quality,
    fertilization,

    disease prediction, etc. [21]. The beneﬁt of smart agriculture lies in its collection
    of real-time

    data on crops, the precise assessment of soil and crops, remote monitoring by
    farmers,

    supervising water and other natural resources, and improving livestock and agricultural

    production. Therefore, smart agriculture is considered to be the progression of
    precision

    agriculture through modernization and smart methods to attain various information
    of

    farm activities that are then remotely managed, and reinforced by suitable alternative

    real-time farm maintenance solutions.

    3. Internet of Things

    The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new technology that allows devices to connect

    remotely to achieve smart farming [22]. The IoT has begun to inﬂuence a vast range

    of industries, from health, trade, communications, energy and agriculture, to
    enhance

    efﬁciency and performance across all markets [23–25].

    Current applications provide information on the IoT’s effects, and its practices
    that are

    yet to be observed. However, by considering the advancement of technologies, one
    can

    envisage the IoT technologies perform a crucial role in numerous activities of
    farming, such

    as the utilization of communication infrastructure, data acquisition, smart objects,
    sensors,

    mobile devices, cloud-based intelligent information, decision-making, and the
    automation

    of agricultural operations (Figure 4).

    Figure 4. Barriers in the implementation of smart agriculture technology.

    The IoT technology monitors plants and animals and remotely retrieves information

    from mobile phones and devices. Sensors and instruments empower farmers to assess

    the weather and to anticipate production levels. The IoT plays a role in water
    harvesting,

    monitoring and controlling the ﬂow amount, assessing crops’ water requirements,
    time of

    supply, and the saving of water, more than ever before [26]. Sensors and cloud
    connectivity

    through the gateway can remotely monitor the status and water supply based on
    soil

    and plant needs [27]. To correct nutrient deﬁciencies, pests, and diseases, farmers
    cannot

    monitor and observe every plant manually, but IoT technology is still beneﬁcial
    and has

    led farmers to a new milestone in modern agriculture [28].

    Recently, the development of IoT technologies has played a major role throughout
    the

    farming sector, particularly through its communication infrastructure. This has
    included

    connecting smart objects, remote data acquisition, using vehicles and sensors
    through

    mobile devices and the internet, cloud-based intelligent analysis, interfacing,
    decision

    formation, and the automation of agricultural operations. These proﬁciencies have
    revo-

    lutionized the agriculture industry in terms of resource optimization, controlling
    climate

    effects, and improving crop yields.

    Researchers have proposed different methods, architectures, and various equipment
    to

    monitor and convey crop information at different growth stages, based on several
    crop and

    ﬁeld types. Many manufacturers provide communication devices, multiple sensors,
    robots,

    heavy machinery, and drones to collect and then distribute data. Food and agriculture

    organizations, along with other government organizations, develop guidelines and
    policies

    for regulating the use of technologies to preserve food and environment safety
    [29,30].

    Fundamentals of IoT Applications in Agriculture

    The accessible, inexpensive and interactive tracking platform provides consolidated

    information on traditional agricultural methods, techniques, implements, crop
    pests and

    diseases, etc., collected from various sources for sustainable agriculture. Interactive
    agricul-

    ture allows easy access to the data by users through multiple devices, such as
    computers

    and mobile phones [31].

    1.

    Robust Models: The distinctive features of the agriculture sector are diversity,
    com-

    plexity, spatio-temporal variability, and uncertainties of the right types of
    harvests

    and facilities.

    2.

    Scalability: The variation in farm size from smaller to larger; hence, the results
    should

    be scalable. The placement and testing planning should be progressively scaled
    up

    with fewer expenses.

    3.

    Affordability: Affordability is vital to farming achievement, and therefore price
    should

    be suitable with signiﬁcant assistance. Standardized platforms, products, tools,
    and

    facilities could obtain a satisfactory price.

    4.

    Sustainability: The problem of sustainability is a vital issue due to strong economic

    pressure and intense competition worldwide.

    4. Technologies Used in Smart Farming

    4.1. Global Positioning System (GPS)

    GPS accurately records latitude, longitude, and elevation information [32]. Global

    Positioning System satellites transmit signals and permit GPS receivers to compute
    their

    location in real-time, and provide continuous positions while moving. The exact
    location

    information offers farmers the opportunity to discover the precise position of
    ﬁeld data,

    such as pest occurrence, type of soil, weeds, and other barriers. The system facilitates
    the

    recognition of various ﬁeld locations in order to then apply the necessary inputs
    (seed,

    fertilizer, herbicide, pesticide, and water) to a particular ﬁeld [33].

    4.2. Sensor Technologies

    Technics, such as photo electricity, electromagnetics, conductivity, and ultrasound,
    are

    used to estimate soil texture and structure, nutrient level, vegetation, humidity,
    vapor, air,

    temperature, etc. Remote sensing data can differentiate between crop types, categorize

    pests and weeds, locate stress in soil and plant conditions, and monitor drought
    [34].

    Plant health is affected by many factors, such as soil moisture, nutrient availability,

    exposure to light, humidity, the amount of rainfall, the color of leaves, etc.
    The plants are

    monitored by maintaining the optimum temperature and light intensity, and conserving

    water and energy through micro-irrigation. Different sensors are used to detect
    many

    parameters. If they cross a threshold, the sensor senses the changes and transmits
    them

    to the microcontroller to perform the required actions until the parameter returns
    to its

    optimum level [1].

    The temperature, humidity, soil pattern monitoring, airﬂow sensor, location, CO2,

    pressure, light, and moisture sensors are generally used in sensing technologies.
    Prominent

    sensor characteristics include reliability, memory, portability, durability, coverage,
    and

    computational efﬁciency, and make them suitable for agriculture [35]. Currently
    available

    wireless sensors play a vital role in collecting data on crop conditions and providing
    other

    information. These sensors are standalone types and can be integrated with advanced

    agricultural tools and heavy machinery, based on application necessities.

    The major sensor types with their corresponding working procedure and purpose
    are

    represented in Table 1.

    [57].

    4.3. Variable-Rate of Technology (VRT) and Grid Soil Sampling

    Variable-rate technologies (VRT) are used in farming to predict the delivery rate
    of

    inputs based on a predetermined map extrapolated from GIS for the placement of
    inputs at

    variable amounts in the right place and at the right time [16,33]. Grid soil sampling
    is soil

    collection from a systematic grid to establish a map for every parameter. These
    maps are

    the basis for VRT and are loaded into a variable-rate applicator. The computer
    and GPS

    receiver direct and control the changes in the delivery amount or fertilizer product,
    based

    on map features [58,59].

    New technologies, such as variable rate technology and associated practices (grid
    soil

    sampling), potentially improve soil fertility management and assess the spatial
    distribution

    of nutrients and yields [60]. In grid sampling, samples are collected from sampled
    sections

    based on the subdivision of a ﬁeld into small areas, or cells, by superimposing
    the grid

    lines onto the ﬁeld. Composite samples represent an entire area of each much smaller
    area

    (grid-point sampling) at the intersections of grid lines. Soil-test values from
    grid sampling

    are mapped by interpolating methods from non-measured locations between sampled

    points. The variability of phosphorus and potassium is ﬁeld-speciﬁc, and each
    ﬁeld should

    be fertilized differently to improve nutrient management practices by uniform
    applications

    of fertilizers and manure for better precision agriculture [61].

    4.4. Geographic Information System (GIS)

    The GIS comprises hardware and software designed to provide compilation, storage,

    retrieval, attributes analysis, and location data to generate maps and analyze
    characters and

    geography for statistics and spatial methods [62]. The GIS database provides information

    on ﬁeld soil types, nutrient status, topography, irrigation, surface and subsurface
    drainage,

    quantity of chemical applications, and crop production, and also establishes the
    relationship

    between elements that affect a crop on a particular farming ﬁeld [63]. Apart from
    data

    storage and display, the GIS is used to assess present and alternative management
    by

    compounding and altering data layers for decision-making.

    4.5. Crop Management

    Satellite images provide information on variations in soil conditions, as well
    as crop

    performances affected by topography within the ﬁeld. Therefore, farmers can exactly

    monitor production factors, such as seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides, that are
    responsible

    for yield increase and efﬁciency.

    The spatial coverage and temporal revisit frequency of satellite images provide
    the

    information in near real-time at a regional scale. The relationship between the
    spectral prop-

    erties of crops and their biomass/yield experiments [64] is predicted by spectral
    reﬂectance

    properties of vegetation, especially in red and near-infrared combinations (vegetation

    indices) to monitor green foliage. Among the different indices, the normalized
    difference

    vegetation index (NDVI) is the most popular indicator to assess vegetation health
    and crop

    production, due to the closely related leaf area index (LAI) and photosynthetic
    activity

    of green vegetation [25]. Crop monitoring methods are based on the interpretation
    of

    remote-sensing-derived indicators by comparing actual crop status to previous
    or normal

    seasons [65]. The relationship between vegetation indices and biomass permits
    early crop

    yield estimation in certain periods before harvest [66]. The automated data acquisition,
    pro-

    cessing, monitoring, decision-making, and management of farm operations [67],
    including

    the basic functions of crop production (yields), proﬁts and losses, farm weather
    prediction,

    ﬁeld mapping, soil nutrients tracking, are the more complicated functionalities
    available

    through automated ﬁeld management.

    4.6. Soil and Plant Sensors

    Sensor technology, a signiﬁcant constituent of precision agriculture, provides
    soil

    properties information, fertility, and water status. Hence, new sensors have been
    developed

    based on desirable features and established apart from currently available sensors
    [68].

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    9 of 26

    Soil sensors and plant wearables monitor real-time physical and chemical signals

    in soil, such as moisture, pH, temperature, and pollutants, and provide information
    to

    optimize crop growth conditions, ﬁght against biotic and abiotic stresses, and
    increase

    crop yields. Soil organic matters (SOMs), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium

    (K) are the most important nutrients for crop production. The NIR reﬂectance-based

    sensors measure the spatial variation of surface and subsurface soil nitrogen
    [69]. SOM is

    predicted based on optimal wavelengths by assessing soil spectral reﬂectance in
    IR and

    visible wavelength regions [70]. The soil nitrogen and phosphorus are predicted
    using

    NIR spectrophotometry technology [71–73]. The soil apparent electrical conductivity
    (ECa)

    sensors collect information continuously on the ﬁeld surface, since ECa is sensitive
    to

    changes in soil texture and salinity. Soil insects/pests are detected using optoelectronic,

    acoustic, impedance sensors, and nanostructured biosensors [74].

    4.7. Rate Controllers

    Rate controllers are designed to control the delivery rate of inputs by monitoring
    the

    speed of vehicles across the ﬁeld, and altering the ﬂow rate of material on a
    real-time basis

    at the target rate. Rate controllers are commonly used as stand-alone systems
    [75].

    4.8. Precision Irrigation in Pressurized Systems

    Recent developments in irrigation systems have introduced irrigation machines,
    de-

    voted to motion control, GPS-based controllers, sensor technologies, and wireless
    commu-

    nication to monitor soil and climatic conditions together with an assessment of
    irrigation

    parameters, i.e., ﬂow and pressure, to attain greater water utilization efﬁciency
    by crop.

    These technologies show signiﬁcant potential; however, further progress is required
    before

    they can become commercially available [76].

    4.9. Yield Monitor

    Yield monitors are the combination of sensors and components, including a data

    storage device, a computer, and user interface, that control integration and interaction

    components. The sensor measures yield continuously by evaluating the force of
    mass or

    volume of grain ﬂow. The mass ﬂow sensor was based on the principle of transmitting

    microwave energy beams and measuring the energy that bounces back after hitting.
    In

    yield monitors, GPS receivers create yield maps based on the location yield data
    [77].

    The yield monitor is mounted on a harvester and connected with the mobile app
    for

    displaying live harvest data, and automatically uploads to the web-based platform.
    The

    app can generate and share high-quality yield maps with an agronomist, and farmers

    can export other farm management data for analysis. In horticultural crops, to
    precisely

    determine the yield quantity and quality of produce, fruit growth is considered
    one of

    the most relevant parameters in the crop progressing period [78]. Color images
    are used

    to track fruit conditions for estimating fruit maturation, making decisions for
    harvesting,

    and targeting the right market [79]. Satellite images are one of the options for
    real-time

    monitoring of the yield of crops over vast areas; for example, Sentinel-1A images
    are used

    to map the rice yield and crop intensity in Myanmar [80].

    The crop yield estimation system was designed using both software and hardware

    components. Based on a Bluetooth terminal android application and yield estimator

    software program, crop yield is estimated using a mathematical calculation through
    a

    mobile application [81]. Satellite-based crop yield predictions based on spectral
    signatures

    reveal the estimated yields are as reliable as actual yields. The maize yield
    predictions

    were successfully carried out under varying environments using machine learning
    and

    satellite-derived data assimilation in crop models [82].

    4.10. Software

    The software has multiple tasks, such as mapping, display controller interfacing,
    data

    processing, analysis, and interpretation, etc. Most commonly, software is used
    to generate

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    10 of 26

    the maps for soil properties and nutrient status, yield maps, variable rate applications

    maps for inputs, and overlaying different kinds of maps with advanced geostatistical

    features [83].

    5. Applications in Agriculture

    By adopting the current sensor and IoT technologies in agriculture, each characteristic

    of conventional farming practices is rehabilitated. The incorporation of wireless
    sensors

    and IoT in smart farming answers many of the issues facing conventional agriculture;
    for

    example, land suitability, drought monitoring, irrigation, pest control, and yield
    maximiza-

    tion. Figure 5 demonstrates the order of main applications, facilities, and devices
    for smart

    agriculture applications. Using advanced technologies at various stages in the
    following

    few applications enhances efﬁciency and revolutionizes agriculture.

    Figure 5. Hierarchy of probable applications, facilities and devices for smart
    agriculture.

    5.1. Soil Mapping and Plant Monitoring

    Soil analysis estimates the nutrient status of the ﬁeld based on GPS position
    and

    ﬁeld-speciﬁc information, and critical decisions are then taken according to the
    nutrient

    deﬁciencies at different stages of the crop. The factors controlling soil fertility
    status are

    topography, type and texture, cropping pattern, application of fertilizer, irrigation,
    etc. [84].

    Soil mapping is useful for assessing crop suitability or varieties in a speciﬁc
    ﬁeld, as well

    as planting depth, the physical, chemical and biological properties of soil, in
    order to

    best utilize resources. Presently, a wide range of sensors and tools are used
    to monitor

    soil properties, such as water-holding capacity, texture, and absorption rate,
    which assists

    farmers in tracking the soil quality and adopting suitable remedies to avoid soil
    degradation

    such as erosion, alkalization, acidiﬁcation, salinization, and pollution. Drought
    is another

    concern that affects plant productivity and crop yield. Remote sensing techniques
    that

    can obtain soil moisture data frequently assist in analyzing agricultural drought
    in remote

    regions. Soil moisture maps generated from satellite data are used to estimate
    the soil water

    deﬁcit index (SWDI), which enables the development of prediction models based
    on soil

    physical properties [85,86].

    Various factors, such as soil type, soil nutrients, irrigation, and pests, affect
    rice yield

    and quality. The IoT-based mobile application aids crop management and provides
    real-

    time information on soil nutrition and characteristics. The system consists of
    electrical

    conductivity (EC), temperature sensors with a T-Beam microcontroller, and IoT
    connectivity,

    and the estimated EC value near the calibration solution is 12.88 mS/cm, and 150
    mS/cm

    is less than 2% of the calibration solution’s value. The measured EC values are
    linearly

    proportional to temperature and depth, and values of 1.04 and 3.86 mS/cm were
    noticed

    with and without fertilizer at 5 cm depth, while it was 0.656 and 420 mS/cm at
    10 cm depth,

    respectively [87].

    Plant monitoring conducted through the IoT ADCON-based station, with sensors

    and mobile devices (smartphones and tablets), farmers are able to collect data
    on soil and

    ambient parameters, such as leaf wetness, air and soil temperature, soil and air
    humidity to

    improve the grape productivity, and crop quality from seeding to harvest. Further,
    the data

    transmission system highlights the soil-plant-atmosphere interactions needed to
    optimize

    agricultural production [88]. By analyzing the data from soil moisture, carbon
    dioxide,

    light, and temperature sensors in bell peppers grown in a greenhouse were compared
    with

    day and night CO2, rolling the doors and windows of the greenhouse open and closed,

    based on soil moisture [89].

    5.2. Irrigation

    According to the UN Convention to Combat Desertiﬁcation (UNCCD), 168 countries

    will be inundated with desertiﬁcation by 2030, and nearly 50% of the world population

    lives in high water shortage areas [90]. Considering the water crises and increasing
    demand

    for farming and other activities, it must be provided to regions with water quantities.
    Water

    resources are conserved by adopting more controlled and efﬁcient irrigation systems;
    for

    example, drip and sprinkler irrigations. Water demand estimation for crops is
    controlled

    by soil type, precipitation, irrigation method, crop type, and requirement, as
    well as soil

    moisture retention. Using air and soil moisture control systems with wireless
    sensors

    optimizes water resources and improves crop health. In the current scenario, a
    substantial

    increase in crop productivity is anticipated using IoT techniques, namely CWSI
    (crop water

    stress index)-based water management [91], calculated from the crop canopy at
    varying

    crop growth stages and air temperatures. The information from climate data, sensors,
    and

    satellite imaging are related to the CWSI model for water requirement calculation,
    and

    predictions using the irrigation index values can be used for every ﬁeld based
    on slope or

    soil variability to improve water usage efﬁciency.

    5.3. Site-Speciﬁc Nutrient Management

    Fertilizer is a either natural or synthetic chemical substance that provides nutrients
    for

    plant growth and soil fertility. Both nutrient deﬁciency and excessive fertilizer
    use harms

    soil, plant health, and the environment [92]. The site-speciﬁc soil nutrient fertilization
    under

    smart agriculture estimates the required quantity of nutrients precisely, and
    minimizes

    their negative effects through excessive use on soil and in the environment. The
    site-

    speciﬁc soil, nutrient measurements are inﬂuenced by soil types, crop type, yield
    targets,

    exchange capacity, use efﬁciency, the type of fertilizer, weather conditions,
    etc. The IoT-

    based fertilizing technique estimates the nutrient’s spatial patterns of distribution
    [93,94].

    The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was obtained from satellite
    images to

    observe crop nutrient status [95,96], crop health, vegetation vigor, and plant
    density, as well

    as soil nutrient level. Recent technologies, like GPS [97], geo mapping [98],
    variable rate

    technology (VRT) [99,100], and autonomous vehicles [101] strongly contribute to
    IoT-based

    smart fertilization. Apart from these, fertigation [102] and chemigation [103,104],
    i.e., the

    use of water-soluble fertilizers in soil amendments and pesticides, are considered
    effective

    management practices to improve fertilization efﬁciency.

    5.4. Crop Pest and Disease Management

    The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) concluded that an annual global crop

    yield loss of 20- 40% was only due to pests and diseases [105], and these losses
    are controlled

    by the use of pesticides and other agrochemicals [106]. Most of them are harmful
    to human

    and animal health, and ultimately cause contamination of environmental systems
    [107,108].

    The IoT-based devices, such as robots, wireless sensors, and drones, precisely
    spot and

    control the crop opponents by real-time monitoring, modelling, and disease forecasting,

    increasing overall effectiveness [109,110] more than traditional pest control
    procedures.

    The IoT-based disease and pest management process depends on detection and image

    processing. The remote sensing imagery and ﬁeld sensors are used to collect data,
    such

    as plant health and pest incidence, in every ﬁeld for the entire crop period.
    IoT-based

    automated traps [111,112] capture, count, and describe insect types, and further
    upload

    data to the Cloud for complete analysis. Due to advancements in robotic technology,

    an agricultural robot with multispectral image sensing devices and precision spraying

    nozzles is utilized to detect and control pest problems more accurately under
    the IoT

    management system.

    5.5. Yield Monitoring and Forecasting

    The yield monitoring mechanism conforms to yield, moisture content, and quality
    of

    produce. The quality depends on pollination with good pollen, especially under
    changing

    environmental circumstances [113–115]. Crop forecasting predicts the yield before
    the crop

    harvest, and assists the farmer in future planning, decision-making, and further
    analysis of

    the yield quality. Maturity determines the right harvesting time by monitoring
    the crop at

    different development stages, including factors such as fruit color, size, etc.
    Predictions of

    the correct harvesting time aids in maximizing crop quality and production, and
    regulates

    market management strategies. Therefore, farmers should know the exact harvest
    time of

    crops to obtain proﬁt. Figure 6 outlines the idea of a farm area network, representing
    the

    whole farm in real-time conditions.

    The development and installation of a yield monitor [116] on a harvester, connected

    with a mobile app, shows real-time crop harvest, and automatically transmits data
    to

    the manufacturer’s web-based platform. To estimate crop production and monitoring,

    satellite images are exploited to cover vast areas [80]. For fruit crops, multicolor
    (RGB)

    satellite images [79] are utilized to track the diverse fruit conditions, especially
    fruit size

    and color, and plays a major role in estimating its maturation, making decisions
    on harvest,

    and market opportunities. Similarly, multiple optical sensors are used [117] to
    monitor

    shrinking fruits during drying conditions.

    Figure 6. An Internet-of-Things-based network for smart farming.

    6. Role of IoT in Advanced Farming Practices

    Adopting the new methods based on sensor and IoT-based technologies improved

    the yield of crops more than conventional agriculture processes. The involvement
    of new

    sophisticated sensor-based technologies in controlled environments plays an important

    role in enhancing the quality and quantity of produce.

    6.1. Greenhouse Farming and Protected Cultivation

    Growing plants in a controlled environment gained popularity in the 19th Century,

    and is considered one of the oldest methods of smart farming. These practices
    further

    accelerated during the 20th Century in countries facing severe weather conditions
    [118].

    Crops grown in indoor conditions are less affected by the environment. As a result,

    crops grown traditionally under suitable conditions are today being raised at
    anytime and

    anywhere by the use of sensors and communication devices. The success of crop
    production

    under a controlled environment depends on various factors, such as shed structures
    and

    material for controlling wind effects, aeration systems, accuracy of monitoring
    parameters,

    decision support system, etc. [119]. One of the greatest challenges in greenhouses
    is the

    precise monitoring of environmental parameters; hence, it requires several measurement

    points to predict the various parameters for controlling and ensuring the local
    climate. In

    an IoT-based greenhouse, sensors are used to measure and monitor the internal
    parameters,

    such as humidity, temperature, light, and pressure [120].

    The smart greenhouse has helped farmers automatically conduct farm work, without

    manual inspection, and protects the plants from hailstorms, winds, ultraviolet
    radiation,

    and insect and pest attacks. Hibiscus plants are grown with the required wavelength
    during

    the night using lights, temperature, and air humidity sensors. A study revealed
    a reduction

    in 70–80% water requirement, and the IoT enables direct contact between the farmer
    and

    consumer to make farming as efﬁcient and proﬁtable as possible [121]. The IoT-enabled

    automated system increased the productivity of rose plants grown in a greenhouse
    by

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    14 of 26

    monitoring and controlling various parameters, such as humidity, mist, CO2 level,
    UV light

    intensity, pH and EC value, water nutrients solution level, temperature, and amount
    of

    pesticides, through sensors for further efﬁcient detection and diagnosis [122].

    6.2. Hydroponics

    Hydroponics, a subdivision of hydroculture, is growing plants without soil to
    improve

    greenhouse farming beneﬁts. Hydroponic-based irrigation systems enable a balanced
    rate

    of application of dissolved nutrients in the water to crop roots as a solution.
    Presently,

    the available systems and sensors [123] detect a wide range of parameters and
    perform

    data analysis at predetermined intervals. Precise measurement and monitoring of
    nutrient

    content in solution is crucial for plant growth and considers its demands. On
    a real-

    time basis, the wireless-sensor-based prototype [124] has delivered a solution
    for soilless

    cultivation, and measures the concentration of numerous nutrients and water levels
    [125].

    An automated smart hydroponics system integrated with IoT consists of three major

    components: input data, cloud server and output data. These monitor lettuce cultivation

    from anywhere through the internet by analyzing parameters, such as pH level,
    water,

    nutrient-rich water-based solution, room temperature, and humidity, on a real-time
    ba-

    sis [126]. The hydroponic system of the deep ﬂow technique is a method for cultivating

    plants by placing roots in deep water layers, and ensuring the continuous circulation
    of

    plant nutrient solution. The plant growth elements data, such as pH, temperature,
    humid-

    ity, and water level in the hydroponic reservoir, are acquired by sensors integrated
    into

    Raspberry Pi, and data are processed and monitored automatically on a real-time
    basis to

    ensure proper water circulation [127].

    6.3. Vertical Farming

    The industrial-based agricultural farming practices damage soil quality at a faster

    rate than nature can reconstruct. The alarming erosion rate and use of fresh water
    for

    agriculture has led to the reduction of arable land, and increased the overburden
    on present

    water reservoirs [128]. Vertical farming (VF) offers an opportunity to keep the
    plants in a

    precisely controlled environment, signiﬁcantly reducing resource consumption and,
    at the

    same time, increasing production at varied times; and only a portion of the ground
    surface

    is needed depending on the number of stacks. VF is also extremely effective in
    higher

    yields and reducing water consumption compared to traditional farming [129]. The
    carbon

    dioxide measurement is the most critical parameter; hence, nondispersive infrared
    (NDIR)

    CO2 sensors play a vital part in tracking and controlling the conditions in vertical
    farms.

    6.4. Phenotyping

    Phenotyping is an emerging crop engineering technique, relating plant genomics
    with

    ecophysiology and agronomy. The advancement of genetic and molecular tools is
    signiﬁ-

    cant for crop breeding; however, quantitative analysis of crop behaviors, such
    as pathogen

    resistance, grain weight, etc., is inadequate due to the absence of effective
    technologies

    and efﬁcient techniques. In this condition, [130] reported that plant phenotyping
    is highly

    useful in investigating the quantitative characteristics responsible for growth,
    resistance

    to various stresses, yield quality, and quantity. The sensing technologies and
    image-based

    phenotyping describe screening of biostimulants and an understanding of their
    mode

    of action [131]. IoT-based phenotyping is intended to observe the crop and related
    trait

    measurements, and offer facilities for the breeding of crops and digital agriculture
    [132].

    The trait analysis algorithms and modelling support determine the relationships
    among

    genotypes, phenotypes, and their growing condition.

    7. The Role of the Engineer in Smart Farming

    Farmers face many issues when they adopt IoT-based agriculture. Therefore, engi-

    neers must develop solutions for speciﬁc problems related to smart farming techniques.
    An

    engineering role concerns the application and use of innovative technologies and
    methods

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    15 of 26

    for precision agricultural machinery, and smart farming is a creative way to mechanize

    agricultural engineering through means different from conventional mechanization
    [133].

    The concepts and synergy-based information are obtained from different technology
    areas,

    such as agricultural mechanization, mechatronics, instrumentation, control systems,
    and

    knowledge in artiﬁcial and computational intelligence [134]. Big data, satellite,
    and aerial

    images have revolutionized precision agriculture, and these new technologies increase

    production efﬁciency by creating a balance between productivity and environmental
    pro-

    tection. As a system integrator, engineering combines technical experience and
    strong

    business skills in both the public and private sectors [135].

    At the same time, engineering exploits the rewards of digital transformation in
    the

    entire agri-food chain, from day-to-day farming activities to supporting sales
    operations,

    logistics, and the maintenance of farm assets. For example, knowledge of the IoT,
    AI,

    mobile, precision farming technologies, remote sensing, advanced analytics, the
    Cloud,

    RPA, and blockchain technologies are necessary [136]. The data collected from
    the various

    types of machinery through sensors and other devices generates responses concerning

    cereals, viticulture, fruit, and vegetables, as well as soil and monitoring [137].

    The use of digital technologies and control systems to automate production processes

    also reduces manual human intervention. The production process, from ﬁeld to ﬁnal

    product, is carried out by planning, organizing, and analyzing data received from
    machines.

    The data acquired are stored in historical archives and correlated with each other
    to

    retrieve useful information for products through traceable systems working based
    on

    radio-frequency signals [138].

    7.1. Purpose

    Purpose is based on the user’s ﬁnal requirement, and inﬂuences the monitoring
    of

    crops during the growth period. Sensors provide the IoT solutions to their problems.

    For example, the end-user is a corn farmer, faced by problems mainly concerning
    water

    usage and ensuring that a crop gets adequate water; therefore, water level and
    moisture

    monitoring sensors are accommodated to prevent water wastage.

    7.2. Technology

    Distance plays an important role in technology selection because the sensors collect

    data and send to the server; hence, similar technology cannot be used for varying
    distances.

    For example, radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID) or near ﬁeld communication (NFC)
    and

    low power, wide area network (LPWAN) technologies could send data over a distance
    of

    hundreds or even thousands of meters.

    7.3. Power Requirements

    Most IoT solutions are spread across a large farm, so it is better to develop
    low-

    power applications. On the other hand, more data transmission requires huge data
    costs

    and power consumption; hence, designers need to consider developing cost-effective
    IoT

    solutions for farmers. Usually, engineers save costs with customized IoT-based
    farming

    solutions, and develop apps for sending the data less frequently.

    7.4. Data Frequency

    The end user’s necessities are critical in deciding the number of sensors and
    data

    packets. Sometimes, a farmer does not require information frequently, but developer
    design

    an IoT application to function on a continual and real-time basis, with very high
    data

    frequency.

    7.5. Placement of Sensors

    Sensors are placed in such a way that they provide optimal performance, even if
    the

    farm has all the essential sensors with proper placement.

    8. Barriers to Implementing Smart Farming Technologies

    Technology adoption is a method with a certain level of heterogeneity factors
    that

    are affective [139]. Technology implemented in farming systems has provided accuracy,

    efﬁciency, and eased time pressures. Although smart farming increases the productivity
    of

    crops, there are still problems in adopting these technologies

    8.1. Cost of Technology

    Existing technologies minimize the workforce and perform extremely fast with high

    accuracy. Therefore, it is anticipated that machines would probably replace a
    human work-

    force in the near future. However, it is impossible, since many countries have
    experienced

    poverty wherever the workforce was the main source for the agriculture sector.
    The imple-

    mentation of devices and technologies requires a huge amount of money; therefore,
    farmers

    face difﬁculties in terms of affordability when they look beyond conventional
    tools.

    8.2. Lack of Financial Resources

    Financial supporters could provide adequate loans to farmers if farmers did not
    get

    the anticipated yield, perhaps because unexpected calamities like drought, ﬂood,
    pests,

    and diseases impacted the crops.

    8.3. Literacy Status of Farmers

    The education level among the farmers is one of the greater challenges in implementing

    technologies in developing countries. The knowledge needed encompasses educational
    and

    technical abilities to manage the tools. The level of education increases a farmers’
    aptitude

    to process information, and thus make decisions using smart farming technologies
    [140],

    facilitating farmers’ use of computers [141]. Farmers in developing nations are
    mostly

    uneducated and unskilled because of a lack of desire to gain knowledge, or any
    new

    technology awareness [142]. Hence, it is a reason for farmers in choosing traditional

    farming over smart farming [143]. Farmers have considered that usage is too complex,

    sometimes incapable of recognizing the icons used in a mobile application as the
    farmers

    use general icons based on traditional understanding. Farmers need to be digitally
    literate

    to reinforce the advantages of smart farming technologies and, simultaneously,
    agri-tech

    companies should ensure farmers easily understand the limitations of the technology.

    8.4. Lack of Integration between the Systems

    Integration across systems is one of the areas where smart farming technologies
    needs

    to be advanced further by incorporating production, property management, and decision-

    making tools. The communication between academics and interdisciplinary groups
    must

    overcome the gap between agricultural and information science. More emphasis has

    been given to increasing user effectiveness during the development of an information

    system [144]. The basis for improved decision-making is based on the timely obtain-

    ability of superior quality data; hence, data must be integrated to generate information

    and knowledge.

    8.5. Telecommunications Infrastructure

    Farming activities mostly occur in rural areas more effectively in arable land
    than

    contaminated land. However, poor telecommunication infrastructure makes data transmis-

    sion unreliable, especially through mobile phones and tablets. Smart farming necessitates

    a real-time connection with the internet to enable the use of information. In
    addition,

    various operation control systems, such as fertilizers, pesticides, and seed volume,
    requires

    high-quality internet connection to produce outcomes. Recently, with the expansion
    of

    mobile phones, rural producers have gained to access mobile internet; however,
    signal

    quality and input speed are limited.

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    17 of 26

    8.6. Data Management

    Farmers are facing problems in organizing and manipulating data obtained by the

    sensors. The weather stations are generating data; however, farmers do not recognize
    how

    to use the information and how to change the data into a more available form.
    Its complex

    systems, alongside issues of acceptability and usability, lead to incorrect calculations.

    Farmers, consultants, and others involved in the production process must provide
    greater

    accessibility to data and information in productive systems.

    9. Current Challenges and Future Expectations

    In the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the United Nations and international

    community established a goal to end hunger by 2030. Currently, the World Health
    Organi-

    zation reports that more than 800 million people are facing food shortages worldwise
    [145].

    In addition, the increasing global population is increasing the demand for quality
    food;

    therefore, food and cash crops could improve overall crop production.

    Figure 7 represents the future challenges agriculture is anticipated to face in
    2050. This

    illustration offers three major problems: (1) feeding 10 billion people, (2) limitations
    in the

    expansion of land, and (3) the reduction of greenhouse gases emissions. These
    challenges

    lead to new thinking about water scarcity, shrinking arable land, rural labor,
    climate condi-

    tions, and much more. The diminishment in rural populations due to urbanization
    is not

    only shrinking communities, but is also leading to ageing populations; therefore,
    younger

    growers must step forward to take responsibility. The generation shift and population

    imbalance create further implications for the workforce and production.

    Figure 7. Challenges in sustainable future agriculture.

    The further shrinking of arable land and the suitability of particular crops in
    speciﬁc

    regions are due to geographic and ecological conditions. Abrupt weather changes
    enhance

    the intensity of environmental issues, such as drought, groundwater depletion,
    and soil

    degradation, affecting crop production. Moreover, traditional agricultural methods
    have

    historically met food demands by employing fertilizers and pesticides; however,
    it increases

    food production only to a certain level and negligent use of chemical deteriorate
    the envi-

    ronment. In developing countries, various problems facing the agricultural sector
    include

    no suitable crop selection, soil testing, efﬁcient irrigation systems, weather
    forecasting,

    animal husbandry, etc. Technological advancements have proved beneﬁcial in developed

    countries, both quantitively and qualitatively, but, in developing countries,
    50% of the

    population is already engaged in agriculture.

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    18 of 26

    The future of agriculture is expected to interconnect with artiﬁcial intelligence
    and

    big data services. As a result, the systems will converge into a single unit,
    where farm

    machinery and management start from seeding to production forecasting. Few of
    the key

    technologies and methods are focused on achieving sustainable future agriculture.

    9.1. Communication

    The achievement of the IoT in agriculture mostly depends on connectivity between

    devices [146]. Most telecom operators provide connectivity services, but represent
    a small

    percentage of smart farming as a whole. Cellular operators offer new services
    to target

    growers and enhance market facilities, especially in rural areas. The success
    of cellular

    technology is feasible when service providers guarantee its beneﬁts, such as ﬂexibility,

    portability, and extravagance, of both-way communication at low cost. In developing

    countries, mobile services and smartphone technology offer a hopeful future for
    farmers

    to enhance their crop yields. The low power wide area technology (LPWA) is anticipated

    to play a major role in smart farming agriculture, due to its improved facilities,
    efﬁcient

    coverage, low power consumption, and cost economics. The cellular operators with
    robust

    IoT create signiﬁcant returns by offering smart agriculture facilities in collaboration
    with

    LPWA technology.

    9.2. Wireless Sensors and IoT

    Placing wireless sensors around the ﬁeld provides timely information on a real-time

    basis to farmers in order to make decisions and act in order to obtain higher
    crop yields.

    Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with GPS technology update all information on
    crop

    growth and terrain features. Recently, digital images and signal processing offer
    additional

    competencies to WSN, and precisely ascertain crop quality and health. The IoT
    technology

    can streamline tasks in a predictable manner by diagnosing crop requirements at
    each

    stage to maximize their effectiveness. In the future, IoT will be upgraded to
    the ﬁfth-

    generation (5G) cellular mobile communication technologies, to provide real-time
    data

    to farmers at any time and everywhere. Based on this achievement, around 29 billion

    IoT-based components are expected to operate in the agriculture sector by the
    end of 2022.

    Furthermore, it is expected to create 4.1 million data points daily from farms
    by 2050 [147].

    9.3. Drones and Unarmed Vehicles

    Farmers widely use drones for crop growth monitoring, spraying nutrient solutions

    and water, and pesticides in tough terrains and for different crop heights. Drones
    have

    proven their value for spraying speed, area coverage, and precision, compared
    to tradi-

    tional machinery. Due to advancements in technology, drones are equipped with
    various

    sensors, and 3D cameras provide comprehensive capabilities in land management
    by

    farmers. With the addition of UAVs in agriculture, many challenges, particularly
    the in-

    corporation of technologies and use in inclement weather conditions, are addressed
    by

    farmers. Other than drones, robotics in agriculture has also enhanced productivity
    due to

    higher yields achieved by spraying and weeding without human intervention. The
    seeding,

    transplanting, and fruit harvest/picking robots have recently added a new efﬁciency
    level

    to traditional methods.

    The UAV technology in smart agriculture provides information on fertilization,
    ir-

    rigation, use of pesticides, plant growth monitoring, weed management, crop disease

    management, and ﬁeld-level phenotyping to enhance cultivation practices. A new
    method

    of 3D modeling has been used to monitor crop growth parameters to determine the
    height

    of maize and sorghum plants under ﬁeld conditions using UAV, and the average root
    mean

    square error (RMSE) of sorghum height with hand sampling ﬁeld data was 0.33 m
    [148]. The

    UAV and 3D models were also restored to extract leaf area index (LAI) in soybean
    plants,

    the measured LAI predicted accuracy corresponding to the handheld device (R2 =
    0.92)

    was correlated with destructive LAI measurements (R2 = 0.89) [149].

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    19 of 26

    Weed detection and management were assessed by integrating low-resolution multi-

    spectral high-resolution RGB images [150] using the Random Forest (RF) technique
    in

    ﬁeld-grown rice and sugar beet crops [151]. Multi-spectral digital images obtained
    by

    UAVs are used for evaluating vegetation indices (VIs) and multi-temporal VIs to
    predict

    grain yield in wheat [152]. The indices, including the normalized difference vegetation

    index (NDVI), spectral vegetation index (SVI), and green area index (GAI), are
    evaluated in

    wheat crops to predict grain yield [153], monitor breeding [154], detect plant
    stress caused

    by yellow rust disease [155], and quantify plant density [156]. The usage of pesticides
    in

    agriculture is crucial for crop yields and the environment, and efforts have been
    made to

    develop and evaluate an algorithm to self-adjust UAV routes during chemical spraying
    in a

    crop ﬁeld to reduce the waste of pesticides and fertilizers [157].

    9.4. Vertical Farming and Hydroponics

    The shrinking of arable land and rapid urbanization results in greater pressure
    on the

    present resources [158], which causes hardships for food production with current
    agricul-

    ture practices. Vertical farming (VF) navigates land and water shortage challenges,
    and

    is highly suitable for adoption in nearby cities. Hydroponics plays a key role
    in lowering

    water requirements. Hydroponics, along with VF, increases available arable land
    without

    distressing forests and other natural habitats. The presence of advanced technologies,

    especially the IoT, makes the agriculture industry highly remunerative with a
    reduction in

    labor requirements and other resources, in addition to minimizing environmental
    impact.

    9.5. Performance Analysis Using Machine Learning

    Data analytics and machine learning concepts are applied to analyze the real-time

    data. In crop production, identifying the best genes is an important process that
    can be

    conducted using machine learning techniques. In agriculture, machine learning
    is used to

    envisage the best genes suited for crop production, especially for selecting seed
    varieties

    that are highly suitable to speciﬁc climate conditions and locations. Machine
    learning

    algorithms identify high demand products and currently unavailable products. Recent

    developments in machine learning and analytics allow farmers to correctly categorize
    their

    harvests before it is processes and delivered to customers.

    Machine learning (ML) in big data systems solves the issues related to farmers’

    decision-making, crops, animal research, land, food availability and security,
    weather

    and climate change, and weeds [159]. ML-based applications accommodate a large
    number

    of agricultural activities, such as yield prediction based on a deep memory model
    for

    maize [160], binary classiﬁcation model with logistic regression technique to
    assess rainfall

    intensity [161], and a short-term memory model to predict soil water content with
    data

    parameters of rainfall, temperature, water diversion, evaporation, and time for
    the next

    1, 2, and 7 days with greater R2 compared to artiﬁcial neural networks [162].
    As a result,

    the agricultural sector is increasing farmers’ incomes, and so communities are
    further

    integrated into the agricultural value chain to reduce poverty and provide access
    to health

    care, education, and nutritious food for their families [163].

    9.6. Renewable Energy, Microgrids and Smart Grids

    Smart farming requires extensive energy due to power consumption by long-standing

    sensor placement, use of GPS, and data transmission. Traditionally, using renewable
    energy

    sources in remote areas solves long-term power issues. Smart grids and microgrids
    are

    integrated into distributed energy sources (DERs). Recent advances in storage
    devices

    combine electricity and heat systems to stock energy and use the heat produced.

    Globally, smart grid technology enables a smooth transition from traditional to
    smart

    energy systems, ensuring energy security. In developing countries, power-strengthening

    systems integrated with renewable sources have enhanced the transport sector,
    and in-

    creased bioenergy use in the power sector through profuse renewable energy sources

    identiﬁed using smart technologies, such as, energy storage devices, smart appliances,

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    20 of 26

    computational intelligence, and the IoT. For example, the smart grid provides
    a broad

    range of opportunities for power sector reform in Nepal, alleviating the rural
    electricity

    problem by implementing smart microgrids, and subsequently, connecting to the
    national

    grid [164]. The Dayalbagh renewable energy smart microgrid in India is a small-scale

    electricity system comprising distributed loads and renewable energy resources,
    acting as a

    single controllable entity in the grid. The smart microgrids are integrated into
    renewable

    resources and form building blocks of smart grids, especially for the dairy plant
    to produce

    various dairy products [165].

    The mixed integer linear programme (MILP) systematically and efﬁciently managed

    energy consumption and subsequently lowered the cost, especially in residential
    areas,

    by scheduling the use of smart appliances and charging/discharging electric vehicles

    (EVs). The model generates its own energy from a microgrid containing solar panels

    and wind turbines, and forecasts wind speed and solar radiation for effective
    energy

    management. MILP-based energy planning sustains the effectiveness and productiveness

    of energy-efﬁcient techniques [166].

    10. Conclusions

    Smarter and more efﬁcient crop production methodologies are needed to address
    the

    issues of shrinking arable land and the food demands of an increasing world population.

    There is a necessity for everyone to be aware of food security in terms of sustainable

    agriculture. The growth of new technologies for increasing crop yield and encouraging

    the adoption of farming by innovative young people as a legitimate profession.
    This

    paper emphasized the role of many technologies used for farming, particularly
    the IoT,

    in making agriculture smarter and more effective in meeting future requirements.
    The

    current challenges faced by the industry and future prospects are noted to guide
    scholars

    and engineers. Hence, every piece of farmland is important to enhance crop production
    by

    dealing with every inch of land using sustainable IoT-based sensors and communication

    technologies.

    \ such as the Internet of Things, raising the productivity of\nagricultural and\
    \ farming activities is critical to improving yields and cost-effectiveness. IoT,\
    \ in particular,\ncan improve the efficiency of agriculture and farming processes\
    \ by eliminating human intervention\nthrough automation. The fast rise of Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT)-based tools has changed nearly all life\nsectors, including\
    \ business, agriculture, surveillance, etc. These radical developments are upending\n\
    traditional agricultural practices and presenting new options in the face of various\
    \ obstacles. IoT aids in\ncollecting data that is useful in the farming sector,\
    \ such as changes in climatic conditions, soil fertility,\namount of water required\
    \ for crops, irrigation, insect and pest detection, bug location disruption of\n\
    creatures to the sphere, and horticulture. IoT enables farmers to effectively\
    \ use technology to monitor\ntheir forms remotely round the clock. Several sensors,\
    \ including distributed WSNs (wireless sensor\nnetworks), are utilized for agricultural\
    \ inspection and control, which is very important due to their exact\noutput and\
    \ utilization. In addition, cameras are utilized to keep an eye on the field from\
    \ afar. The goal\nof this research is to evaluate smart agriculture using IoT\
    \ approaches in depth. The paper demonstrates\nIoT applications, benefits, current\
    \ obstacles, and potential solutions in smart agriculture. This smart\nagricultural\
    \ system aims to find existing techniques that may be used to boost crop yield\
    \ and save time,\nsuch as water, pesticides, irrigation, crop, and fertilizer\
    \ management.\nKeywords: agriculture; land monitoring; control strategies; IoT;\
    \ sensors; economic growth; water\nmanagement and water resources\n1. Introduction\n\
    The Internet of Things (IoT) is an interconnected network of computing devices,\n\
    people with unique IDs, and the capacity to communicate via a network without\
    \ human\ninteraction. The Internet of Things (IoT) intends to connect the physical\
    \ and virtual worlds\nby interacting and exchanging data via the internet. Linked\
    \ industries, smart cities, smart\nhomes, smart energy, connected vehicles, smart\
    \ agriculture, connected buildings and\ncampuses, health care, and logistics are\
    \ all examples of IoT applications [1]. The increasing\nneed for food, both in\
    \ terms of quantity and quality, has required the development and\nmodernization\
    \ of the agricultural sector. The “Internet of Things” (IoT) is a promising set\
    \ of\ntechnologies that may be used to provide a variety of agricultural modernization\
    \ solutions.\nScientiﬁc institutions, research institutes, and the agricultural\
    \ sector are racing to provide\nmore and more IoT solutions to agricultural business\
    \ stakeholders, laying the foundation\nfor a clear role when IoT becomes a mainstream\
    \ technology [2]. The world’s biodiversity\nis anticipated to support between\
    \ 9.4 and 10.1 billion people by 2050, increasing the need\nfor specialized food\
    \ production zones, especially for harvesting and livestock. This means\nAgronomy\
    \ 2022, 12, 127. https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12010127\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/agronomy\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 127\n2 of 21\nthat by 2050, global food production will have\
    \ to grow by 70% [3]. Crop production is\nincreasingly crucial in agriculture,\
    \ with commodities, such as cotton, wheat, gum, and\nothers, playing signiﬁcant\
    \ roles in many nations’ economies.\nIn 2019, the IoT market was 690 billion dollars\
    \ and was projected to be 1256.1 billion\ndollars by 2025 with a 10.53% CAGR globally\
    \ from 2020 to 2025. Solutions are needed to\nassure timely and regular agricultural\
    \ growth and yield due to the combined effects of a\ngrowing population, natural\
    \ weather unpredictability, soil degradation, and climate change.\nFarm management,\
    \ animal monitoring, irrigation control, greenhouse environmental con-\ntrol,\
    \ autonomous agricultural machinery, and drones are examples of IoT applications\
    \ in\nagriculture, all of which contribute to agrarian automation. It also demands\
    \ contributing to\nagricultural food production’s long-term viability. Land appraisal,\
    \ crop protection, and\ncrop yield projection, according to these needs, are essential\
    \ to world food production [4].\nFarmers, for example, can manage ﬁeld environments\
    \ in real-time and more effortlessly\nregulate ﬁelds using wireless sensors and\
    \ mobile networks. Farmers may also utilize IoT\ntechnology to capture essential\
    \ data, subsequently creating yield maps that enable precision\nagriculture to\
    \ produce low-cost high-quality crops [5]. Figure 1 depicts the smart precision\n\
    agriculture cycle.\nFigure 1. Smart precision agriculture cycle.\nSmart agriculture\
    \ is becoming increasingly important to farmers in the modern day,\nand it will\
    \ become even more critical in the future to ensure proper ﬁeld expansion and\n\
    crop output. Unfortunately, traditional farming methods are not up to the task\
    \ of meeting\nrising demand. As a result, the ground stays barren and devoid of\
    \ fertility due to poor\nutilization of nutrients, water management, light, fertilizers,\
    \ and pesticides. Crop diseases,\nwater shortage, irrigation, and pesticide control\
    \ monitoring are only some of the challenges\nthat different IoT automation and\
    \ control systems can efﬁciently address [6]. This is why\ncontemporary agriculture\
    \ employs smart equipment and tools from sowing through crop\nharvesting, storage,\
    \ and transportation. The operation is smart and cost-effective due to its\naccurate\
    \ monitoring capabilities and fast reporting using a range of sensors. Autonomous\n\
    drones, harvesters, tractors, satellites, and robots are now complementing agricultural\n\
    equipment. Sensors may be instantly placed and begin collecting data, which is\
    \ then\nimmediately available for further analysis over the internet. By enabling\
    \ reliable data\ngathering at each place, sensor technology allows crop and site-speciﬁc\
    \ agriculture [7].\nUsing advanced control methods to automate agricultural activities\
    \ has increased crop\nproduction while also improving soil fertility.\nThe following\
    \ are the signiﬁcant contributions made by this study:\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n\
    3 of 21\n•\nThe world’s expectations of the agriculture industry, based on existing\
    \ IoT approaches\nfor providing solutions and new applications and technology.\n\
    •\nIdentiﬁcation of numerous application ﬁelds, as well as a summary of the most\
    \ recent\nstate-of-the-art literature on IoT technology.\n•\nThe Internet of Things’\
    \ task is to address these constraints and other challenges, such\nas resource\
    \ scarcity and precise usage, climate change, etc.\nThe rest of the paper is laid\
    \ out in the following manner. Section 2 delves into the\ndetails of smart agricultural\
    \ applications based on IoT technologies. Section 3 discusses the\nmany types\
    \ of equipment and technology available. Section 4 identiﬁes unsolved problems\n\
    and potential remedies. Finally, Section 5 concludes the research.\n2. Major Applications\
    \ of Smart Agriculture\nPrecision farming, animal monitoring, and greenhouse monitoring\
    \ are a few agri-\ncultural businesses utilizing the Internet of Things. Every\
    \ element of traditional farming\noperation may be substantially improved by combining\
    \ cutting-edge sensors and Internet\nof Things technology. At the moment, the\
    \ Internet of Things’ (IoT’s) and wireless sensors’\nharmonious incorporation\
    \ into smart agriculture can catapult agriculture to formerly in-\nconceivable\
    \ heights. Appropriateness of land, pest monitoring and control, irrigation, and\n\
    yield optimization are just a few of the conventional agricultural issues that\
    \ IoT may assist\nin resolving through the implementation of smart agriculture\
    \ approaches [7]. Figure 2\nillustrates the comprehensive paradigm of smart agricultural\
    \ monitoring system applica-\ntions, facilities, and sensors. Agriculture applications\
    \ are classiﬁed as IoT agricultural apps,\nsmartphone-based agricultural apps,\
    \ and sensor-based agricultural apps. Wireless sensor\nnetworks (WSNs) have recently\
    \ been used to enable IoT applications for smart agriculture,\nincluding irrigation\
    \ sensor networks, frost event prediction, precision agriculture and soil\nfarming,\
    \ smart farming, and unsighted object recognition, among others [8]. Signiﬁcant\n\
    instances of how new technology assists in the general improvement of efﬁciency\
    \ at various\nstages are included here.\nFigure 2. General paradigm of smart agriculture.\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 127\n4 of 21\n2.1. Monitoring of Soil Moisture and Water Levels\n\
    Soil monitoring has developed into one of the most challenging agricultural areas,\n\
    both for manufacturers and farmers. Numerous environmental issues associated with\
    \ soil\nmonitoring affect agricultural yield. When these sorts of obstacles are\
    \ correctly identiﬁed,\nfarming patterns and methods become readily understandable.\
    \ The soil’s moisture content,\nwetness, fertilizer application, and temperature\
    \ trends are all being monitored. Soil’s\nmoisture environment management system\
    \ uses soil humidity and moisture sensors. By\nproposing an appropriate fertilizer\
    \ approach, the results of a soil monitoring test report\nassist farmers in increasing\
    \ crop yield [9]. The sensor can read both analog and digital\noutputs. The judgment\
    \ is made based on data collected from sensors and compared to\npredeﬁned threshold\
    \ levels. The soil moisture sensor is used to regulate the irrigation\nsystem’s\
    \ automatic operation. When the moisture level goes below the threshold value,\
    \ the\nwater pump is triggered [10].\nSoil mapping enables you to sow many crop\
    \ types in the same ﬁeld, allowing you\nto match better soil characteristics,\
    \ such as seed compatibility, sowing timing, and even\nplanting depth, as certain\
    \ crops are deeply rooted while others are not. Additionally,\ngrowing many crops\
    \ concurrently may result in more prudent agricultural practices, such\nas resource\
    \ conservation. The system is composed of a distributed network of soil moisture\n\
    and temperature sensors located in the root zone of the plant, as well as rain\
    \ sensors\nlocated in various zones. The microcontroller collects and transmits\
    \ all sensor data and\ninformation. In addition, a temperature and soil moisture\
    \ threshold algorithm will be\ndevised and implemented in a microcontroller-based\
    \ gateway to regulate the amount of\nwater given to the ﬁelds. Finally, the user\
    \ is provided with control via an IoT module based\non rain sensor data to interrupt\
    \ or restart water ﬂow as needed [11].\nIf the ﬁeld contains an adequate amount\
    \ of water, no water will be pumped into\nit. However, when the soil’s water moisture\
    \ content falls below a predetermined level,\nwater is pumped into the ﬁeld until\
    \ the desired moisture content is attained. The DHT11\nsensor monitors the ﬁeld’s\
    \ temperature and humidity. In addition, a PIR motion sensor\ndetects when an\
    \ intruder (human or animal) enters the area. Consequently, sensor values\nare\
    \ continually monitored and displayed on the farmer’s mobile device through a\
    \ GSM\nsim900A module, which includes a sim card with a 3G data pack and adds\
    \ IoT capabilities\nto the system [12].\n2.2. System of Irrigation Monitoring\n\
    Numerous studies have been conducted on a smart irrigation system. Food production\n\
    technology must signiﬁcantly improve to keep up with the growing demand for food.\n\
    Numerous experts have worked diligently to create an alternative to irrigated\
    \ farming.\nThese efforts, however, have not yet resulted in a feasible solution\
    \ to the irrigation system’s\npresent problems. At the moment, crop irrigation\
    \ is carried out manually and by established\ncustomary practices. When crops\
    \ are given less water, they grow slower and absorb less\ncalcium. Frequent irrigation\
    \ kills roots and wastes water. As a result, accurate irrigation\nof crops becomes\
    \ a considerable difﬁculty [13]. A smart irrigation management and\nmonitoring\
    \ approach is developed to enable autonomous delivery of sufﬁcient water from\n\
    a tank to ﬁeld crops. Automatic sensor systems are cost-effective, offered for\
    \ determining\nwhether plants require watering based on information gathered from\
    \ monitoring and\nregulating the soil water levels to minimize dryness or overﬂow\
    \ [14].\nKamaruddin et al., 2019 [15] developed an Internet of Things (IoT)-based\
    \ wireless sen-\nsor network (WSN) architecture that manually or automatically\
    \ administers and monitors\nthe irrigation system. The proposed method used NRF24L01\
    \ and Arduino tools as the\ncommunication network transceiver and CPU. The soil\
    \ moisture sensor data will be sent to\nthe base station via NRF24L01. Then, the\
    \ sensor node’s data will be sent to the cloud server\nthrough the base station.\
    \ This project utilized Thingspeak as a cloud server to store all data\nin a database\
    \ and connect it to an Android application.\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n5 of 21\n\
    2.3. Fertilizer Administration\nAkshaya et al., 2020 [16] proposed an IOT-based\
    \ technique and upgraded the previous\nsystem, which predicted agricultural yields\
    \ using backpropagation and a random forest\nalgorithm. It recommends fertilizer\
    \ application rates and exclusively monitors atmospheric\ndata via a mobile network\
    \ and pump on/off action. The suggested technique utilizes\na segmented tank to\
    \ collect NPK fertilizer and water. The user can select one of three\nmodes (manual,\
    \ auto, or smart). In manual mode, the user is provided with the fertil-\nizer\
    \ and water ratios for well-known plants and fertilizers. In auto mode, all required\n\
    is to know the plant’s name to select the appropriate fertilizer and water ratio.\
    \ Finally,\nin smart mode, if the user cannot recognize the plant’s name, fertilizer\
    \ ratio, or water,\nthe plant’s name, fertilizer ratio, and water will be recommended\
    \ automatically. The IoT\nmodule will continuously collect information on the\
    \ temperature and soil moisture. The in-\nformation collected will be stored in\
    \ the IoT cloud. The mobile phone will inform you\nwhenever the given data changes\
    \ and the needed fertilizer ratio will be shown on the liquid\ncrystal display.\n\
    2.4. Crop Diseases and Pest Control\nHuman operators frequently monitor insect\
    \ pests via time-consuming and costly on-\nsite inspections, which results in\
    \ low spatial and temporal resolution. Remote monitoring\nhas been possible due\
    \ to advancements in remote sensing, electronics, and informatics.\nMonitoring\
    \ costs and effectiveness can be optimized through the deployment of camera-\n\
    equipped traps. With minimum human intervention, image analysis algorithms can\
    \ locate\nand count insect pests captured in traps automatically.\nReddy et al.,\
    \ 2019 [17] created an IoT-based system for disease and insect pest man-\nagement\
    \ in agriculture and the prediction of plant climatic factors. The integrated\
    \ sensors\nhelp in the measurement of soil and atmospheric moisture and humidity.\
    \ These features\nhelp determine the environmental conditions in which the plant\
    \ ﬂourishes and the plants’\nillnesses. It detects disease on the ﬁeld and sprays\
    \ prescribed insecticides. Web cameras\ntake images that are then preprocessed\
    \ to include RGB to grayscale conversion, defect\ndetection, image scaling, image\
    \ enhancement, and edge detection. SVM is utilized to\ncategorize characteristics\
    \ generated from Citrus Canker diseases, such as energy, kurtosis,\nskewness,\
    \ and entropy (damaged Lemon crop). The Arm7 microcontroller is used for\nhardware,\
    \ power, sensors, and motor driver control. Once the illness is identiﬁed, the\n\
    program will propose fertilizers and transmit the results to an LCD and the recommended\n\
    fertilizers. By pump, the fertilizers will be sprayed on the diseased leaves.\
    \ This study was\nconﬁned to the lemon plant to demonstrate that the same method\
    \ may be used for various\ncrops with favorable outcomes in the future.\nA solution\
    \ is presented for forecasting and detecting grape disease using the CNN\napproach\
    \ and real-time gathered data on environmental factors. First, the CNN technique\n\
    is utilized to analyze the leaf images. Then, different layers of the CNN method\
    \ are used\nto create the image. Finally, it is scaled to a speciﬁc resolution\
    \ before data is sent into\nthe CNN layers for training and testing. The suggested\
    \ algorithm was evaluated on four\ndiseases known to have a higher effect on grape\
    \ production. The diseases include esca\nblack measles, anthracnose, leaf blight,\
    \ and black rot. This gadget not only detects but also\nforecasts illnesses based\
    \ on historical weather data. On the other side, the readings from\nthe humidity,\
    \ temperature, and soil moisture sensors are transferred through Raspberry\nPi\
    \ to Microsoft’s Azure Cloud. Following this, the sensor readings are used to\
    \ anticipate\nthe illness using a trained linear regression model. Based on the\
    \ ﬁndings of the preceding\ndetection and prediction stages, suggestions for appropriate\
    \ fertilizers in the right quantities\nwill be provided to minimize fertilizer\
    \ misuse and cost savings [18].\nTo detect pests in rice during ﬁeld production\
    \ and avoid rice loss, the Internet of Things\nsupported a model-based UAV with\
    \ the Imagga cloud offered. The Internet of Things-based\nUAV was developed on\
    \ AI mechanisms and the Python programming prototype to transmit\nrice disease\
    \ images to the Imagga cloud and supply insect data. The Approach identiﬁes the\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 127\n6 of 21\ndisease and insects by integrating the conﬁdence\
    \ ratings of the labels. The label identiﬁes\nthe objects in the images. To determine\
    \ the pest, the tag with the greatest conﬁdence\nresults and more than or equal\
    \ to the threshold is chosen equal to the target label. If pests\nare discovered\
    \ in the rice, statistics will be transferred to the ﬁeld owner directly to take\n\
    preventative actions. The suggested method is capable of detecting all pests that\
    \ inﬂuence\nrice production. On the other hand, this research attempted to minimize\
    \ rice waste during\nproduction by conducting insect monitoring at regular intervals\
    \ [19]. Table 1 summarizes\nmany current smart agricultural applications.\nTable\

    \ in this\nstudy. Raspberry Pi can connect with sensors to operate applications,\
    \ such as the DHT11\nTemperature Sensor and Soil Moisture Sensor, which forecasts\
    \ temperature and rainfall\nranges. The gateway is integrated with Amazon Web\
    \ Services’ (AWS) IoT platform. MQTT\nis a messaging protocol that allows for\
    \ various messages across distant connections [20].\nThe study reported establishing\
    \ an autonomous greenhouse smart aquaponics man-\nagement organized on temperature\
    \ via the use of an Android-based monitoring and\nautomatic correction system\
    \ and a Raspberry Pi-based plant growth monitoring system.\nReal-time data is\
    \ collected using the light intensity sensor and the ambient temperature\nand\
    \ humidity sensors. Additionally, the pH and temperature of the recirculating\
    \ water\nare monitored. Suppose the data acquired is beyond the threshold range.\
    \ In this case, the\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n7 of 21\nsystem quickly engages the\
    \ correction devices, which comprise a peristaltic buffer device,\nan aerator,\
    \ an evaporative cooler, inlet and exhaust fans, and grow lights. The internet\n\
    remote access function enables real-time data transmission and receipt through\
    \ the android\napp amongst the smartphone and computer system. This study compared\
    \ plant devel-\nopment in smart aquaponics to traditional agriculture based on\
    \ soil systems employing\nimage processing in two investigational operations.\
    \ Following record collection, it was\ndetermined that the smart aquaponics system\
    \ achieved greater output than conventional\nagriculture monitoring. As lettuce,\
    \ mustard greens, and pak choi are produced in a smart\naquaponics system vs.\
    \ traditional soil-based farming, this study focused exclusively on\nlettuce,\
    \ mustard greens, and pak choi [21].\nA tree topology was used for the WSN-enabled\
    \ agricultural monitoring system to\nimprove performance. A cheap sensor node\
    \ like a commercial sensor or a NodeMCU\nmodule transmits data to the control\
    \ unit over Wi-Fi. Fertilizer, fertigation improvement,\nand agricultural operations\
    \ are monitored by data processing and thresholding. The in-\ncorporation of cost-effective\
    \ ICT technology with traditional crop management or weather\nmonitoring and sensor\
    \ data created the agronomic model. Minimal environmental impact\nfrom crop growing\
    \ was achieved as a consequence of large fertilizer and water savings [22].\n\
    2.6. Climate Conditions Monitoring\nIn farming, the weather is extremely important.\
    \ Incorrect climate knowledge can\nhave an impact on crop quality and quantity.\
    \ On the other hand, farmers may use IoT\nsolutions to put sensors in the ﬁeld,\
    \ including humidity sensors, temperature sensors,\nrainfall sensors, and water\
    \ level sensors, to collect real-time data from the environment.\nThese sensors\
    \ monitor the state of crops and the environment in which they grow. If a\nworrying\
    \ environmental situation is discovered, it is either automatically corrected\
    \ or a\nwarning is sent to the farmer.\nGreenhouses created an Internet of Things-based\
    \ weather station to address the cost\nand accuracy issues. The TI CC2650 Sensor\
    \ Tag and IBM Cloud Platform continuously\nmonitor weather and abiotic factors,\
    \ transfer the detected values to the cloud, and send\ne-mail notiﬁcations when\
    \ values deviate. As a result, this study may be expanded to\ninclude the use\
    \ of ML model-based classiﬁcation training to categorize a plant’s health as\n\
    excellent, moderate, or terrible based on the average temperature, humidity, light\
    \ intensity,\nand air pressure. This would help to clarify abstracts about a plant’s\
    \ health to a larger level\nand might aid in keeping the plants’ health in good\
    \ shape [23].\nArifﬁn et al. [24] used an autonomous temperature control system\
    \ to address the\ndrawbacks of traditional growing methods, which are expensive,\
    \ have low yields, and\nneed a lot of care. The suggested IoT-based architecture\
    \ was evaluated in a real-world\nsetting at the Bandar Puteri Centre of NASOM\
    \ (National Autism Society of Malaysia).\nThe ideal temperature for oyster mushrooms\
    \ is between 20 and 30 ◦C, with a humidity\nlevel of 70 to 80%. Two sensors were\
    \ installed in the mushroom house’s center and corner\nto detect temperature and\
    \ moisture, then communicated to a remote monitoring station\nthrough a microcontroller\
    \ unit for further action. The results of the six-day experiment\nrevealed that\
    \ an effective automatic monitoring system, which can regulate the farm’s\nhome\
    \ while reducing resources and human labor, was developed. The mushroom home,\n\
    IoT control box, and Web Client interface were all designed within the system.\
    \ As a result,\nthe mushroom house provided a regulated environment for mushroom\
    \ growing as well as\nprotection from pests and insects. The climate control system,\
    \ which automates controlling\nthe ideal environment for oyster mushroom production,\
    \ was housed in the IoT control box.\n3. Major Equipment and Technologies\nMajor\
    \ equipment and IoT technologies are fully demonstrated in the next subsections,\n\
    such as various sensors, agricultural drones, and harvesting robots.\nAgronomy\
    \ 2022, 12, 127\n8 of 21\n3.1. Sensors\nThe visual sensor, multispectral sensor,\
    \ thermal sensor, lidar sensor, and hyperspectral\nsensor are only a few of the\
    \ sensors utilized in IoT-based smart agriculture and drone\ntechnologies. Current\
    \ IoT-based sensor applications in smart agriculture are presented in\nTable 2.\n\
    Table 2. IoT-based sensors in smart agriculture used to increase production.\n\
    Sensors\nOperations of Different Sensors\nDHT11 Sensor:\nDHT11 sensor measures\
    \ temperature and humidity\n[12].\nSEN0193: Soil Moisture Sensor\nSEN0193 is a\
    \ Soil Moisture Sensor. The dielectric\npermittivity of soil is a consequence\
    \ of its moisture\ncontent. The sensor generates a voltage proportional\nto the\
    \ dielectric permittivity of the soil and hence to\nits water content. The sensor\
    \ takes an average of the\nwater content over its whole length. The Soil\nMoisture\
    \ Sensor is used to quantify moisture loss\nover time due to plant absorption\
    \ and evaporation,\ndetermine optimal soil moisture information for\ndifferent\
    \ plant species, monitor soil moisture\ninformation in greenhouses to regulate\
    \ irrigation,\nand optimize bottle biology research. [20].\nTurbidity Sensor SKU\
    \ SEN0189:\nThe turbidity sensor determines the quality of water\nby detecting\
    \ its turbidity level. It detects suspended\nparticles in water using light by\
    \ measuring the light\ntransmittance and scattering rate, which vary the\nquantity\
    \ of total suspended solids (TSS) in the water\n[25].\nMH-Z14A:\nThis is used\
    \ to monitor the CO2 level at high\nprecision.\nBH1750:\nThis is used to monitor\
    \ the light intensity level (as\nphotosynthesis is related to light intensity)\
    \ and to\nconduct experiments on the inﬂuence of light\nintensity on the greenhouse\
    \ environment’s\ntemperature [26].\nRain sensor:\nA rain sensor is a simple instrument\
    \ for detecting\nrain pressure. It may be used as a switch to\ndetermine the strength\
    \ of rainfall when a raindrop\nfalls through the rainy board [27,28].\nLidar sensor:\n\
    The top camera sensor is an imaging range camera\nthat estimates the distance\
    \ between the camera and\nthe subject at each point in the collected images [29].\n\
    3.2. Agricultural Drones\nUAVs can monitor the health of crops, apply pesticides,\
    \ and take hyperspectral images\nin precision agriculture. Drones can scan a crop\
    \ for issues in plants using visible and\nnear-infrared light, and they can determine\
    \ which plants reﬂect what quantities of green\nand NIR light. Photosynthetic\
    \ activity diminishes when a plant is stressed. This data may\nbe used to create\
    \ numerous images that track plant changes and indicate their health. As a\nresult,\
    \ farmers can more accurately administer treatments after a disease has been identiﬁed.\n\
    Drones are also utilized for surveillance, trafﬁc monitoring, and weather monitoring\
    \ in\nagriculture. Drone technology employs various sensors, including optical,\
    \ multispectral,\nthermal, lidar, and hyperspectral sensors, which are brieﬂy\
    \ detailed in Section 3.1.\nCrop management has beneﬁted from the Internet of\
    \ Things, remote sensing, and\nanalytic data approaches. Pests may be identiﬁed,\
    \ targeted, and managed to utilize remote\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n9 of 21\nsensing\
    \ using UAVs. UAVs can ﬂy in tough and harsh terrains to take high-resolution\n\
    images that allow pests to be identiﬁed and controlled. Many crop security concerns\
    \ may\nbe solved using UAVs equipped with cameras, which are not possible with\
    \ traditional pest\nmanagement methods. UAVs have been used to automate insect\
    \ damage in agricultural\nareas [30,31].\nAn automated rotating device based on\
    \ sun illumination angle perception keeps the\nsolar panel perpendicular to the\
    \ sun and increases solar energy harvesting rates. Based on\nspectrum analysis\
    \ technology, Internet of Things approaches, including several wireless\ntechnologies,\
    \ such as TVWS, ZigBee, and LoRa, are suggested to collect data and send it\n\
    to a base station/gateway to assess the degree of damage caused by pests and diseases.\n\
    In addition, a technique for maximizing wind force usage and to extend the time\
    \ of ﬂight for\ndrones has been established to support drones in downwind by designing\
    \ the ﬂying path\nimplementation. The study’s scope is limited, with the goal\
    \ of developing a long-standing\ninsect and disease detection technique through\
    \ extensive data gathering and analysis.\nThe suggested model will be tested in\
    \ real-world scenarios. For example, crop diseases\nand insects might be tracked\
    \ in real-time and climatic changes could be analyzed [32].\nThe Internet of Things-based\
    \ approach is illustrated for smart agriculture monitoring in\nFigure 3.\nFigure\
    \ 3. IOT-based smart agriculture monitoring system.\n3.3. Harvesting Robots\n\
    Under speciﬁc climatic circumstances, a harvesting robot is intended to gather\
    \ fruits\nautonomously. The advancement of vision-based harvesting robots’ mechanism\
    \ is yet in its\nearly stages. Agricultural robotic systems, on the other hand,\
    \ have comparable architecture.\nThe system is comprised of an autonomous mobile\
    \ platform, a lightweight mechanical\narm with multiple degrees of freedom, an\
    \ adaptable end effector for a power response\nsystem, a multi-sensor machine\
    \ vision system, a smart decision and drive management\nsystem, and supplementary\
    \ hardware and software [33]. Kang et al., 2020 [34] developed\nan intense neural\
    \ network to assist robotic apple harvesting, which detects and grasps\nfruit\
    \ in a real-time environment using a computer vision system. The proposed robotic\n\
    harvesting system was implemented using a customized soft end-effector comprised\
    \ of\nIntel i7-6700 CPU and NVIDIA GTX-1070 GPU and DELL-INSPIRATION main computer\n\
    unit, Intel D-435 RGBD visualization camera, and UR5 Universal Robot (modern robotic\n\
    manipulator). The proposed approach uses Mobile-DasNet, a computationally efﬁcient\n\
    lightweight one-stage instance segmentation network to conduct fruit recognition\
    \ and\ninstance segmentation on sensory input. An improved PointNet model was\
    \ also developed\nto conduct fruit modeling and grip estimates from an RGB-D camera\
    \ through the point\nclouds technique. The two qualities described above were\
    \ utilized and integrated to\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n10 of 21\ndevelop and build\
    \ a precise robotic system for autonomous fruit picking. The goal of the\nstudy\
    \ was to improve the vision algorithm’s performance, boost, and improvements.\n\
    Furthermore, the proposed soft end-effector robotic device may improve its grasping\n\
    recognition proportion and effectiveness under various situations. Ogorodnikova\
    \ and\nAli [35] devised a technique for recognizing ripe tomatoes in a greenhouse\
    \ setting using a\nmachine vision system of a harvesting robot. To effectively\
    \ execute the suggested image\nprocessing method for this purpose, RGB color images\
    \ from a typical digital camera are\nrequired. In the second stage, RGB color\
    \ images are converted to HSV, which is easier\nfor extracting red tomato from\
    \ the green backdrop in the image. Image segmentation,\nthresholding, and morphological\
    \ operations separate a red tomato from a green background\ncolor photograph.\
    \ The algorithm is built using Matlab methods and then evaluated to see\nif it\
    \ produces favorable results. The process can be converted into fast-acting codes\
    \ for the\nharvesting robot’s controller since it is basic and short. The research\
    \ is limited to moving\nthe gripper to the proper place in tomato detection and\
    \ developing efﬁcient algorithms\nusing 3D gripper models to transform the existing\
    \ research system into industrial robots.\nOnly a few robotic devices that can\
    \ successfully perform watering, planting, and\nweeding activities now exist.\
    \ FaRo (Cultivating RObot), a new smart robot based on a CNC\nmachine, has been\
    \ presented for automatic crop farming deprived of human involvement in\nagriculture.\
    \ What sets FaRo apart from other farming platforms is its capability to complete\n\
    the entire farming cycle, from sowing to harvesting. In addition, the FaRo harvesting\n\
    tool will be discussed and shown. FarmBot can only be used for a limited time,\
    \ from\nsowing to harvesting, after which the robot’s tool mount system will be\
    \ exchanged for crop\nharvest. In this example, the robot assumes the role of\
    \ a tomato collector. Both the FaRo\nharvesting robot and the unique kinematics\
    \ of the continuum manipulator design were\nthoroughly discussed. Due to implementation\
    \ problems, the robot’s design is currently in\nthe development stage. The objective\
    \ of the proposed system is to build a model with an\nintelligent agricultural\
    \ monitoring technique linked to the main database, and the robot\nwill have sufﬁcient\
    \ information to plant and cultivate crops without the need for human\nintervention\
    \ [36].\nA depth vision-based approach for detecting and placing truck containers\
    \ is proposed\nfor the joint harvesting system, along with three coordinate systems.\
    \ This method included\ndata preprocessing, point cloud poses transformation using\
    \ the SVD (singular value decom-\nposition) algorithm, upper edge segmentation\
    \ and projection, RANSAC (Random Sample\nConsensus) algorithm edge line extraction\
    \ and corner point positioning, and fusion and\nvisualization of results on the\
    \ depth image. Field trials show that the suggested approach\nis effective in\
    \ identifying and positioning vehicles. However, the study is restricted due\n\
    to its sensitivity to the appearance of truck containers and the presence of loud\
    \ sites in\nthe agricultural area. Autonomous driving and path planning in the\
    \ forage harvester’s\nunloading system is still challenging [37].\nIntelligent\
    \ robots have become extensively employed in various sectors as the in-\ntelligent\
    \ computer industry with automation expands. Currently, manual labor is still\n\
    used to harvest the majority of domestic crops. However, owing to constant worker\
    \ pay\nhikes, the manual picking technique increases the fruit farmer’s ﬁnancial\
    \ expenditures,\nand the appliances of robots in the farming business are challenging.\
    \ As a result, the\nsmart moveable robot picker has been introduced based on computer\
    \ vision machinery by\nincorporating the robot arm, selector, ﬂexible carrier,\
    \ track procedure, and the intelligence\nunit, which accomplishes the robot picker’s\
    \ travel channel coding, auto-judging the ripe\nfruit, and in addition a vision-based\
    \ binocular stereoscopic methodology employed for the\nfunctions of recognition\
    \ and placement. To begin with, precise segmentation recognition\nand maturity\
    \ evaluation of the target fruit is required for proper picking. Thus, the robot\n\
    picker may potentially replace human labor in manual picking. The most important\
    \ part\nof the recognition process is gathering fruit image samples, which is\
    \ performed using a\nCCD camera that shoots following the preprocessed fruit features\
    \ using image content.\nThe color model is then built up, and it separates the\
    \ fruit and surrounding surroundings\nusing segmentation technology before recognizing\
    \ the fruit. Additionally, it precisely traces\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n11 of\
    \ 21\nand goes for the fruit location in relation to the three-dimensional coordinate\
    \ information\nprovided by the infrared source and the fruit contour and image\
    \ differences taken by\nthe two cameras simultaneously. To ﬁnish the picking operation,\
    \ it must program the\npath recognition to avoid the obstacle [38]. The overall\
    \ architecture of IoT-based fruit\nidentiﬁcation for harvesting is shown in Figure\
    \ 4.\nFigure 4. General architecture of IoT-based fruit detection for harvesting.\n\
    4. Open Issues and Key Challenges in Smart Agriculture\nThe problems of deploying\
    \ IoT-based agricultural systems are discussed in this section.\nThe sensors’\
    \ durability and cost are described. The IoT-based system requires a constant\n\
    source of electricity. Depending on the size, a lot of electricity may be required.\
    \ However,\nin rural and village communities, obtaining such electricity is challenging.\
    \ To meet the\nenergy requirement, alternative energy sources, such as solar and\
    \ wind, must be employed.\nThis will also raise the price signiﬁcantly. It is\
    \ necessary to have a dependable internet\nconnection in rural and village regions.\
    \ It is the most crucial aspect of establishing an\nIoT-based system. The connection\
    \ must have a sufﬁcient bandwidth to transport data in\naccordance with the application’s\
    \ requirements. Farmers need basic computer/tablet (HID\ndevice) training and\
    \ an understanding of how the IoT system operates. It is also necessary\nto provide\
    \ proper education on the unique IoT deployment in their farm [39].\nThere are\
    \ six major obstacles to developing a green IoT-based agriculture system,\ninvolving\
    \ infrastructure, mobility, maintenance, hardware, data privacy, data analytics,\
    \ and\ndata security. The selection of meters and sensors used for Internet of\
    \ Things tools is one\nof the hardware issues. As a result, many different sensors\
    \ may be utilized in Internet of\nThings applications, such as the water quality\
    \ sensor, humidity sensor, chemical sensor,\npressure sensor, temperature sensor,\
    \ and more. The data analytics problem is machine\nlearning, deep learning methods,\
    \ and prediction algorithm applications in smart agricul-\nture to produce a nutritional\
    \ suspension using IoT records. Routine sensor inspections\nof all Internet of\
    \ Things appliances are a maintenance issue while it may be certainly\nharmed\
    \ in the farm area. The mobility problem is related to 4G, 5G, WiFi, 6LowPan,\
    \ LoRa\nnetwork connection, which link sensors spread across a broad region in\
    \ the farm areas.\nSome infrastructural trials are developing and implementing\
    \ Internet of Things-connected\narchitectures that incorporate innovative technologies,\
    \ such as cloud and fog computing\nand network virtualization. Finally, the primary\
    \ issue in advancing smart agriculture based\non IoT is not physical maintenance\
    \ but rather ensuring security and privacy [8].\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n12 of\
    \ 21\nThe UAVs that are linked wirelessly are subject to cyber-physical or harmful\
    \ assaults\nto fool the control signals due to open communication lines. Such\
    \ attempts represent a\nsigniﬁcant risk to the unmanned aerial vehicle system\
    \ in terms of private information\ncrash or theft, as well as mission failure.\
    \ Moreover, the faking of control signals may harm\nthe UAV mission and make it\
    \ harder to restore it. As a result, improving UAV wireless\ncommunication’s safety\
    \ and conﬁdentiality element, which necessitates in-depth research\nof security\
    \ concerns covering the entire network protocol layers [40], is an important\n\
    open subject.\nVisual harvesting of robots’ dynamic tracking of objects with great\
    \ precision remains\nan unresolved challenge. Further study should also aim to\
    \ enhance the precision placement\nand operation by merging smart behavior judgment,\
    \ adequate fault tolerance, robot vision\nwith artiﬁcial intelligence technology\
    \ for accurate placement, and function enhancement.\nThe recognition and location\
    \ accuracy are impacted when the crop situation is varied due\nto the lighting\
    \ and unconstrained circumstances of the ﬁeld ecosystem. A robot vision\napproach\
    \ would be efﬁcient in harvesting crops correctly to increase the success rate\
    \ of\nrobotic harvesting in such settings. The researchers used geometric features,\
    \ novel image\nalgorithms, and intelligent decision theory to address the challenges.\
    \ However, because\nmassive datasets are necessary to train efﬁcient deep learning\
    \ algorithms, further study\nis needed [33]. Table 3 presents a comparison of\
    \ the current state of the art on smart\nagriculture obstacles and beneﬁts.\n\

    One of the most challenging aspects of robotic grasping is estimation. Traditional\n\
    techniques have limitations since noise or partial loss of the point cloud might\
    \ impact the\nestimation’s accuracy and resilience. Estimation is more difﬁcult\
    \ in orchard situations than\nit was in interior environments.\nData Handling\
    \ and Processing\nTraditional vision algorithms’ performance is constantly restricted\
    \ in complicated\nand volatile settings [34]. World food consumption is predicted\
    \ to treble by 2050 due to\npopulation expansion and societal progress, yet increasing\
    \ food production is now difﬁcult\ndue to declining water, climate alterations,\
    \ less proper soil, and insects and illnesses. Pests\nand diseases have always\
    \ been signiﬁcant stumbling blocks to increased grain output.\nSatellite technology\
    \ is climate sensitive and has a limited illumination variation, making it\nchallenging\
    \ to satisfy the requirement for insects and infection management in farming\n\
    areas. Currently, low-altitude autonomous drones (offering excellent ﬂexibility\
    \ and image\nresolution) can satisfy the needs of agricultural insect and infection\
    \ management. In some\ncircumstances, such as when there is a high wind, drone\
    \ stability might be difﬁcult. As a\nresult, the drone’s ﬂight route must be designed\
    \ in conjunction with the actual conditions.\nLong ﬂights are necessary for ﬁeld\
    \ pest and disease data collection; thus, choosing a sunny\nday with a moderate\
    \ breeze might be a viable alternative [32]. Identifying malicious and\ncompromised\
    \ nodes among soil sensors interacting with the base station is a signiﬁcant\n\
    problem in the base station to cloud communications. The trust management method\
    \ is\npresented as one of the options for identifying these nodes in a lightweight\
    \ manner.\nFinally, the study highlighted the existing problems and possibilities\
    \ and future re-\nsearch in vegetable and fruit identiﬁcation and placement. The\
    \ majority of previous research\nshowed that illumination variations, grouping,\
    \ and unconstrained situations have been the\nmain obstacles to effective recognition\
    \ and localization of vegetables and fruits in the ﬁeld.\nFurther research will\
    \ be required to overcome the existing state-of-the-art challenges and\nenhance\
    \ the performance, accuracy, efﬁciency, effectiveness, recognition, and success\
    \ rate\nof controlling and image processing techniques. However, fruit recognition,\
    \ detection, posi-\ntioning, harvesting robots, and application robustness enhancement\
    \ need to minimize the\ninclusive computational cost and time. Future research\
    \ might include algorithms and cam-\nera operation advancements, sensor platforms\
    \ that can enhance illumination consistently,\nhorticultural changes, and human–machine\
    \ collaboration [29]. Furthermore, sophisticated\nmethodologies, algorithms, and\
    \ computational approaches are necessary to address the\nlack of precision in\
    \ harvesting operations.\n5. Discussion and Analysis\nIt is estimated that plant\
    \ diseases are a signiﬁcant contributor to global ﬁnancial\ndeﬁcits. Numerous\
    \ abiotic and biotic stresses and continual tension monitoring concerns\nthe impacts\
    \ of the loss of fruit-producing plants. Consequently, the $15 billion U.S. apple\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 127\n14 of 21\nindustry loses millions of dollars every year.\
    \ Fruits are one of the most signiﬁcant sources\nof nutrients in plants; yet,\
    \ illnesses, pests, fungous, infectious, and microbial diseases all\naffect the\
    \ quality and quantity of fruits. Using computer vision-based methods, the issue\n\
    may now be alleviated. Diseases/infections may be detected early and effectively\
    \ using\nthese methods.\nThe sickness classiﬁcation of various fruit leaves was\
    \ achieved using a deep convolu-\ntional neural network DCNN approach. The deep\
    \ features are retrieved by ﬁrst utilizing\ndeep learning networks, such as AlexNet\
    \ and VGG-s, and then tweaked using a transfer\nlearning approach. Before the\
    \ selection step, a multi-level fusion strategy is offered, and\nthe chosen features\
    \ analyzed to produce the entropy basis features. To categorize the\nobtained\
    \ feature map, we employed a multi-SVM classiﬁer. The diseases investigated in\n\
    the experiments include apple rust, scab, black rot, peach bacterial spots, and\
    \ cherry pow-\ndery mildew, and they were all gathered from a plant village dataset.\
    \ The recommended\nmethod’s better performance in terms of a 97.8% accuracy, 97.6%\
    \ sensitivity, 97.6% precision,\nand G-measure was observed in the classiﬁcation\
    \ results (97.6%) [44]. Some research has\ninvestigated whether computer vision\
    \ approaches may be employed for scalable and early\nplant sickness detection.\
    \ There is still a critical lack of non-lab data sets that can be utilized\nto\
    \ allow vision-based plant disease detection. For visual plant disease identiﬁcation,\
    \ the\nPlantDoc dataset was supplied. The collection has 2598 data points in total,\
    \ encompassing\n13 plant species and up to 17 disease categories, and was developed\
    \ by annotating internet-\nscraped photos for 300 human hours. Three models for\
    \ plant disease classiﬁcation were\ntrained to illustrate the dataset’s effectiveness.\
    \ The ﬁndings demonstrate that employing\nour dataset models may enhance the recognition\
    \ rate by up to 31%. The recommended\ndataset, we feel, will contribute to decreasing\
    \ the entry barrier for computer vision algo-\nrithms in plant disease detection.\
    \ For photos featuring leaves from various classes in a\ndataset with contextual\
    \ noise, and low-resolution leaf images, the model fails to give proper\nconclusions.\
    \ Using image segmentation methods to extract leaves from the photos can\nboost\
    \ the dataset’s utility. Although the dataset has been rigorously veriﬁed, particular\n\
    photographs in the collection may be wrongly labeled owing to a lack of sufﬁcient\
    \ topic\nknowledge [45].\nIt is necessary to construct an improved VGG16-based\
    \ DCNN model to detect apple\nleaf diseases (scab, frogeye spots, and cedar rust).\
    \ The global average pooling layer re-\nplaces the fully connected layer to lessen\
    \ restrictions and a batch normalization layer is\nattached to boost the model’s\
    \ computational performance. Furthermore, to avoid a long\ntraining time, a transfer\
    \ learning approach is applied. To detect apple leaf diseases, the\nsuggested\
    \ model makes use of 2446 apple leaves, 2141 photos in the training phase and\
    \ 305\nimages in the testing phase. The experimental data reveal that utilizing\
    \ the recommended\napproach, the total accuracy of apple leaf classiﬁcation may\
    \ reach 99.01%. Furthermore,\nthe ﬁndings demonstrate that cedar rust is accurately\
    \ diagnosed, but one healthy person is\nmisclassiﬁed as scab and the other as\
    \ frogeye spots.\nFurthermore, the model parameters are cut by 89% compared to\
    \ the standard VGG16.\nAs a result, the classiﬁcation performance is raised by\
    \ 6.3%, and the computational com-\nplexity is cut to 0.56% of the innovative\
    \ model. Consequently, the DCNN model developed\nin this study provides a more\
    \ accurate and speedier way for recognizing apple leaf infec-\ntions [46]. Table\

    -\nFor the recognition and detection of olive diseases, such as peacock spot,\
    \ anthracnose,\nand canker, an improved convolutional neural network (CNN) dubbed\
    \ AlexNet was\nsuggested. Several innovations separate the proposed model from\
    \ others. It uses effective\nintelligent data preprocessing with a stable image\
    \ in each class, a transfer learning approach,\nand an extended and upgraded PlantVillage\
    \ dataset to work in more complicated situations.\nThe total accuracy of the suggested\
    \ technique is 99.11%, which is the best possible score.\nFurthermore, it possesses\
    \ precision, recall, and F1 measures of 99.49%, 99.11%, and 99.29%,\nrespectively.\
    \ Despite the fact that model training takes a long time, classiﬁcation during\n\
    testing takes only a few seconds on a CPU [47]. Citrus fruits, leaves, and stems\
    \ are included\nin the image dataset. The collection contains images of normal\
    \ and diseased citrus leaves\nand fruits, including greening, scab, blackspot,\
    \ canker, and melanosis. There are 759 images\nof normal and abnormal citrus leaves\
    \ and fruits in the data collection. The images had\na resolution of 5202 × 3465\
    \ (Mpix), and when scaled at 72 dpi, the width and height\nwere 256 × 256 pixels,\
    \ correspondingly. The contaminated images were divided into four\nvarious citrus\
    \ illnesses and left on their own. The entire process consists of four major\n\
    steps: (a) enhancing the dataset using Top-hat and then Gaussian functions; (b)\
    \ weighted\nsegmentation and segmentation of lesion through a saliency map, which\
    \ highlights the\ninfested area; (c) color, texture, and geometric feature extraction\
    \ from the diseased area;\nand (d) PCA, skewness, and entropy-based feature selection\
    \ and implementation.\nAgriculture management, water contamination, and air quality\
    \ analysis monitoring\nsystems were all investigated as part of the smart environment\
    \ monitoring (SEM) system.\nFigure 5 demonstrates that substantial investigation\
    \ of smart environment monitoring\nhas increased over the period in both cases,\
    \ speciﬁcally research involving the wireless\nsensor network and Internet of\
    \ Things along with research involving machine learning and\nInternet of Things\
    \ [41,51].\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n16 of 21\nFigure 5. Research contribution\
    \ using IoT, WSN, and machine learning.\nImperfect network access, lack of a (or\
    \ no) power supply, and high framework costs\ncompared to an ordinary farmer’s\
    \ income were presented in a low-cost, energy-proﬁcient,\nprotected, dependable,\
    \ and heterogeneous three-layer approach for Internet of Things-\nbased smart\
    \ agriculture. IoT devices make up the ﬁrst layer, including IoT-based smart\n\
    agriculture monitoring like insect detection, theft detection, crop monitoring,\
    \ smart ir-\nrigation, smart poultry, food supply chain, and food preservation\
    \ monitoring systems.\nThe low-power LoRaWAN network connects the IoT devices\
    \ to the gateways. The next\nlayer is made up of local processing servers and\
    \ gateways that are connected with the\ngateways. The cloud layer, which uses\
    \ the publicly available FIWARE framework to offer a\nset of open-source API standards,\
    \ is the third layer. This study aimed to create diagnostic\ntechniques for packet\
    \ combination procedures at the fog node before they were sent over\nthe network\
    \ facility to cloud servers. This aims to decrease short IoT packet processing\n\
    overheads and optimize energy usage at the backbone, as billions of IoT devices\
    \ linked to\nfog nodes are projected to generate massive volumes of short IoT\
    \ packets [52].\nA Cuckoo Search Algorithm has been created, allowing water allocated\
    \ for farming\nunder all situations. Temperature, turbidity, pH, and moisture\
    \ were collected utilizing the\nInternet of Things (IoT) infrastructure outﬁtted\
    \ with wireless communication devices and\nsensors. ThingSpeak presented the sensor\
    \ data in the cloud system in this IoT platform.\nThe ThingSpeak data was utilized\
    \ in the suggested Cuckoo Search Algorithm, which\nidentiﬁed suitable yields for\
    \ a given soil [53]. Incorrect or late identiﬁcation can result in\noveruse or\
    \ underuse of chemicals, resulting in higher production costs and environmental\n\
    and health consequences. With varied lighting, angles, surfaces, noise, and high\
    \ resolutions,\n3651 real-time indication images of various apple infections were\
    \ manually collected.\nA subset of this dataset was labeled by experts, such as\
    \ cedar apple rust, scab, and normal\nleaves, and open-sourced for the Plant Pathology\
    \ Challenge to Kaggle community. We also\nused this data to train a standard CNN\
    \ (convolutional neural network), which obtained\n97% recognition on a held-out\
    \ test set and a maximum AUC value of 0.986. The project’s\ngoal was to keep adding\
    \ additional images to the pilot dataset from various perspectives,\nlighting,\
    \ and distances to create a bigger more complete labeled database by experts.\n\
    The dataset will contain pests and diseases, such as apple mites and aphids and\
    \ apple\nleaves comprising apple marssonina and alternaria leaf blotch, leaf spot,\
    \ frogeye, rot, cedar,\nand powdery mildew, ﬁre blight, and scab-labeled images.\n\
    Additionally, it will be photographed and remarked on fruit infected with apple\
    \ brown\nrot, bitter rot, or scab [54]. An Internet of Things-based cost-effective\
    \ monitoring system\nwas developed to address particular crop irrigation, soil\
    \ erosion, and irregular irrigation.\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n17 of 21\nThe suggested\
    \ method entails building a distributed WSN (wireless sensor network), with\n\
    multiple sensor modules covering each part of the farm and transferring data to\
    \ a central\nserver. ML techniques will aid irrigation pattern forecasts based\
    \ on yields and climate\nenvironments. According to a comparison of several algorithms,\
    \ random forest regression\nhas a decent accuracy of 81.6%. However, due to harsh\
    \ weather conditions, the system\nis constrained in many ways: the forecast accuracy\
    \ is dependent on the setup’s correct\ninstallation, and the threat of wild animals\
    \ can harm the hardware setup [48]. Because\nhuman abilities and agricultural\
    \ gear are severely restricted compared to robot knowledge,\nrobotic systems in\
    \ agriculture can be highly beneﬁcial in achieving both high quality\nand quantity\
    \ goods. To integrate IoT systems with agricultural machinery, a new way\nof managing\
    \ control signals from the control system to the actuators is required. These\n\
    methods should increase economic viability while also lowering environmental impact\
    \ and\nenhancing food sustainability. It handles various agricultural tasks, including\
    \ moisture\nsensing, irrigation, crop monitoring, and insect and animal defense\
    \ [55]. Accordingly, a\nstate-of-the-art technologies-based accuracy comparison\
    \ is presented in Figure 6.\nFigure 6. Accuracy-based analysis of the different\
    \ state of the art techniques.\nWater monitoring is the most highly measured IoT\
    \ sub-vertical, followed by crop,\nsmart agriculture, animal, and irrigation monitoring.\
    \ All of these have the same proportion\nof peer-reviewed articles exploring the\
    \ possible uses of the Internet of Things. According\nto the ﬁndings, the most\
    \ important sensor data for measurement is 15.73% soil moisture,\n19.79% humidity,\
    \ and 24.87% ambient temperature. However, further sensor information,\nsuch as\
    \ soil pH and moisture, are also collected for IoT applications. Wi-Fi has the\
    \ highest\nclaimed use in farming and agriculture, with 30.27% and 21.10% use\
    \ of mobile tools, as\nshown in Figure 7. Other technologies like Bluetooth, WSN,\

    \ and farming industries. In the agri-\ncultural and farming business comparison,\

    \ communication technologies and sensors based on\nIoT is necessary to increase\
    \ agricultural productivity. Wireless sensors, unmanned aerial\nvehicles, and\
    \ cloud computing have been shown to be practical tools for guaranteeing\nlong-term\

    including irrigation, soil sample and mapping, fertilizer or pest control, yield\
    \ monitoring,\nforecasting, and harvesting, may be automated using smart devices,\
    \ allowing for improved\ncrop quality and growth capacity. The key effective features,\
    \ important applications, IoT-\nbased smart agriculture technology and equipment,\
    \ and open barriers and possibilities\nwere all examined in this study. This research\
    \ will be expanded in the future to include\nsecurity and privacy issues in smart\
    \ agriculture using IoT methods.\nAuthor Contributions: All authors contributed\

    data collected by surveying 96 Italian agricultural SMEs owners/managers • Authors
    confront the role of managerial capabilities, cognition and external environment
    for the adoption of 4.0 technologies. Abstract Smart Agriculture and 4.0 Technologies
    have brought several benefits to agricultural small and medium enterprises (SMEs).
    Nonetheless, the penetration of such digital technologies is still poor and slow.
    This study addresses the issue and provides some insights on the reasons related
    to the still limited adoption of 4.0 technologies within agricultural SMEs. Authors
    do not simply focus on the adoption per se, but rather devote attention to the
    SMEs owners/managers'' subjective perception of the opportunity behind the technology
    adoption, and of the incentives or constraints given by the external environment
    as well as the organizational capabilities as embedded in the owners/managers’
    skills and organizational routines. Authors analyze data collected by surveying
    96 Italian agricultural SMEs owners/managers, and empirically confirm the relevance
    of managerial capabilities, managerial cognition, and managerial perception of
    the external environment for the adoption of 4.0 technologies in agricultural
    SMEs. The results of this research support the conclusion that organizational
    capabilities related to the search for evidence-based knowledge by the SME’s decision-maker
    are crucial for the technology’s adoption. In addition, we show the statistical
    significance of the managerial perception of technological usefulness and of the
    availability of a supporting business environment either in the form of professional
    services or institutional support, on the technology’s adoption. The article ends
    by discussing the results and highlighting relevant managerial implications. Previous

    1. Introduction The agricultural industry is undergoing the digital transformation.
    Many effects are already visible, such as a growing use of smart technologies
    and big data analytics, which promise to lead to higher efficiency, and better
    quality of production. Digital transformation is also leading to the rise of agreements
    for value co-creation among companies and supply chain partners who rethink their
    operations, controls, and coordination of activities. Smart Agriculture is an
    approach to farm management that utilizes the so-called “4.0 Technologies” to
    maximize economic returns and to guarantee the preservation of resources, while
    at the same time protecting the environment [1]. These technologies include: Artificial
    Intelligence [2], Big Data analytics [3], Cloud Computing [4], Cyber-Physical
    Systems (computer-based algorithms) [5], Information and Communication Technologies
    [6] and finally, the Internet of Things [7]. Smart agriculture is often referred
    to as the Fourth Agricultural Revolution [8], given its extensive benefits and
    prospective economic impacts. The use of 4.0 technologies reduces the environmental
    impacts and improves productivity and profits at once [[9], [10], [11], [12]].
    In this work, we take into consideration different types of applications of the
    4.0 technologies for smart agriculture [13] and specifically: (i) Smart irrigation
    and input delivery; (ii) Agriculture drones or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)
    [14]; (iii) Soil and plants monitoring systems [15]; (iv) Yield Monitoring Systems;
    (v) Farm Management Software (FMSs) and Predictive Data Analytics [16]; (vi) Precision
    livestock systems, (vii) Smart greenhouses. These technologies possess the potential
    to make farms’ production systems more sustainable, efficient and resilient. In
    fact, they enable and increase crop yield, an early detection of diseases, pests
    or weeds for a timely and site-specific control, an optimization of crop irrigation.
    Additionally, these technologies affect the possibility to fertilize according
    to real needs, monitoring and control of in-farm machines and equipment, and the
    storing of historical data [17]. Thus, they provide new insights to improve the
    management decision-making and the total traceability of the process. Scholars
    are increasingly focusing on the adoption of 4.0 technologies in the agricultural
    industry, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Understanding
    why and how SMEs in agricultural sector adopt technological innovations, and more
    specifically digital technology, is crucial for ensuring a successful adoption
    process [18], especially since many studies report many unsuccessful information
    technology (IT) implementations or even low rates of adoption [[19], [20], [21]].
    Past studies have identified both managerial and organizational drivers able to
    explain why firms adopt IT solutions (e.g. [[22], [23], [24]]). Among them, previous
    research has identified the following relevant factors: (i) the managerial support
    of the adoption of technologies (e.g. [25]); (ii) the presence of leading actors,
    so called “champions”, fostering and supporting technological change (e.g. [26]);
    (iii) the level of education with respect to technologies [27]; (iv) their implementation
    (e.g., reactivity, leadership, weakness, etc. - see. [24,28]); (v) the relevance
    of technological integration in the light of strategic plans [29]; vi) and the
    size of the firm [30]. Scholars have also looked at the presence of related technologies,
    or the inertia created by existent technologies, as potential incentives - or
    disincentives - for technology adoption [31]. Organizational culture has also
    been identified as a key element [32], especially in the light of potential facilitators
    of adoption such as orientation towards innovation, conflict absence, communication,
    and flexibility [33]. Few studies, however, analyze the adoption’s drivers of
    specific technologies in SMEs (e.g. [34,35]). Among them, the vast majority take
    qualitative and exploratory approaches [36,37], analyzing the impact of new technologies
    on the SMEs business model [38,39] or focusing on the implementation stage [40,41]
    with little empirical research on the determinants of IT adoption in SMEs. Those
    studies that develop a statistical analysis of the factors influencing smart agriculture
    adoption (e.g., [42,43]), focus their research on different variables such as
    farmer’s age, farm income, use of a cell phone with internet access, computer
    confidence, soil quality, tenure ownership, etc. Additionally, they tend to be
    geographically limited to the United States or to the cotton production industry
    [[44], [45], [46]]. Even if they represent a further step in the understanding
    of the drivers of smart agricultural adoption, these works do not consider the
    peculiarities of SMEs that are likely to use highly centralized structures. In
    particular, in context where the SMEs owners/managers are the ones taking the
    most critical decisions while adopting a generalist approach in the employment
    of their human resources and thus lacking a set of knowledge skills, and attitudes
    useful to identify and pursue new opportunities [47]. Indeed, mainstream literature
    reports that SMEs owners/managers hardly take part in formal learning activities,
    have limited or no access to peers or role models within the company, do not have
    time and financial slack at their disposal, and rely on external contacts [48,49].
    Therefore, the crucial role of SMEs owners/managers and their possible lack of
    competencies demand for a focus on the organizational capabilities to acquire
    information, the SMEs owners/managers'' cognition, and the external incentives
    potentially enabling the development of their competence. Scholars have also reported
    that an integration of environmental features and stimuli, organizational capabilities
    and managerial cognition may give a better explanation of strategic action [50],
    so it is necessary to deepen our understanding of how these factors influence
    the owner/manager’s adoption of a new IT solution. We build on and extend previous
    literature by integrating three aspects - managerial cognition, organizational
    capabilities and environmental incentives - related to the adoption of IT technologies
    in SMEs therefore answering the call for a more comprehensive explanation of SMEs
    owner/manager strategic action. Hence, the purpose of this study is to answer
    the following research questions: Which are the determinants of technology adoption
    in agricultural SMEs? What role do organizational capabilities, managerial cognition
    and external incentives play in the investment decision? We specifically address
    these questions by devoting attention to the SMEs owners/managers'' subjective
    perception of the opportunity behind the technology adoption, and of the incentives
    or constraints given by the external environment as well as the organizational
    capabilities as embedded in the owners/managers’ skills and organizational routines.
    We focus on the managers, since they make sense of information for the entire
    firm. Many can take part in the collection of data and/or data processing, but
    the information that converges is interpreted at the managerial level for organizational–level
    action [51,52]. In other words, the subjective representation of the reality that
    owners/managers develop determines the firm’s strategic agenda (e.g. [53]). We
    surveyed a sample of 96 Italian Agricultural SMEs. We administered a questionnaire,
    through which we collected data on several factors that may influence owner/managers’
    decisions to invest in 4.0 technologies for smart agriculture. Our study includes
    micro, small and medium firms in the agricultural industry. Farms involved in
    the study accomplish the following activities: (i) the “production, rearing or
    growing of agricultural products including harvesting, milking, breeding animals
    and keeping animals for farming purposes”; or (ii) “maintaining the agricultural
    site in a condition which makes it suitable for grazing or cultivation without
    any particular preparatory action going beyond usual agricultural methods” ([54],
    Regulation 1782/2003, Article 2). The remainder of this paper is as follows: we
    first present our theoretical background and hypotheses, and then the methods
    and finally we discuss our results, implications and future avenues of research.
    2. Theory development and research hypotheses Our study examines the enactment
    of technology strategy in SMEs operating in the agricultural sector, follows through
    the analysis of their specific form of investments, adoption of digital-based
    administrative or production applications, all of which having the purpose to
    improve the firm''s products or processes. We present our theoretical model in
    Fig. 1, while the connections and the corresponding hypotheses are explained and
    supported in the following sections. Download : Download high-res image (129KB)

    of technological change, when the level of uncertainty is higher, managerial cognition
    becomes crucial for action [55]. Managerial sensemaking, more specifically, becomes
    indeed the basis for action given the huge amount of (possibly conflicting) information
    available during technological change [56,57]. Additionally, in case of SMEs,
    the owners/managers are often the central decision-makers or primal actors influencing
    the firm’s decision-making processes [58]. This is further sustained by the fact
    that SMEs can rely on limited resources and capabilities in the area of information-systems,
    therefore the owner/managers of SMEs may be more directly involved in the information
    processing demands of operations [59]. All the studies above provide compelling
    arguments about the relevance of SME owner/managers’ subjective representations
    of the reality at the moment of new technology adoption. In this paper, we consider
    two forms of subjective representations relevant for the decision to adopt: the
    perception of the opportunity behind the adoption of new technology and the aspects
    of the external environment that are central in the decision to adopt. Managerial
    cognition therefore links a firm’s actions to a changing environment by influencing
    what is observed and how this information is interpreted [51,56]. However, within
    their firms, managers might also become ingrained in sets of routines that link
    capabilities and cognition together. Following Kaplan [60], we have taken into
    account how managerial cognition, in the form of disposition towards the investment
    in new technologies, relate to the organizational capability to collect relevant
    related information about new technology to adopt. The underlying basis of this
    study is that managerial cognition and managerial capabilities are not just different
    justifications of the organization response, nor unrelated forces influencing
    the adoption of new technologies. Rather these organizational and managerial aspects
    are meaningfully connected and still deserve scholarly attention [61]. This research
    aims to contribute to a better understanding of the relationships among the overall
    strategic behavior of SME as a managerial response to the opportunity to invest
    on a new technology, the managerial perception of the environment and the managerial
    capabilities. 2.1. Capabilities that drive the firm’s response to a new technological
    opportunity We consider the adoption process as a result of the interplay between
    external and internal environment [62] and, in line with a more behavioral approach
    [63], argue that capabilities and routines determine whether firms survive by
    adapting to technological challenges, and thus perform [64]. Routines and capabilities
    can create unfavorable conditions for the firms to respond to the changing context
    [65] inhibiting the renewal of their current competencies [66,67]. Theories of
    absorptive capacity suggest that the degree of prior knowledge shapes investment
    decisions in a new arena [68]. Accumulations of knowledge connected to a new technical
    arena could help organizations adapt over time [69,70]. More specifically, we
    argue that SMEs catch information, as well as data, documents and standards [71]
    from their external environment, enacting a process of transformation into internal
    knowledge. This claim is also supported by the fact that owners/managers of SMEs
    tend to use their contacts and relationships to collect additional information
    [72]. This process stands at the basis of SMEs innovation, as confirmed by Atherton
    and Hannon [73], who argue that innovation in SMEs is likely a pure managerial
    process, since top managers or owners take on all decisions [74]. In addition
    to managing daily operations, they directly affect future investment decisions
    regarding the adoption of technology (e.g. [75]). Overall, these researches suggest
    that managerial accumulation of knowledge on the technologies should be expected
    to enable firms’ response to technical change and allocation of investment into
    4.0 technological investment. HP1 The allocation of investment into 4.0 technological
    innovations is positively related to the managerial activity of collection of
    evidence-based knowledge on those technologies. 2.2. The role of managerial cognition
    Past studies (e.g., [76]) propose that cognitive limits hinder the elaboration
    of a comprehensive understanding of the environment by top managers (e.g. [77]).
    Managers elaborate subjective representations of their environment that affect
    their view about events, business opportunities, and strategic decisions [78].
    Therefore, it is not the objective environment, but rather their own subjective
    representation, that influences a firm’s strategic agenda and drives decision-making
    [78]. The main basis for decision-making is causal reasoning [79] which has an
    impact on the way strategic decisions are taken [80]. During the decision-making
    process, managers develop beliefs related to the causal relationship between the
    firm’s strategy and the environment [78]. The cause-effect belief about the environment
    affects the way opportunities are interpreted and which strategic actions are
    triggered (e.g. [81,82]). One of the major limitations in the agricultural sector
    is the low awareness of the availability of innovations, and of their potential
    benefits [37,83]. Often managers cannot build the causal relationship between
    the adoption of a technological solution and the firm itself [84,85], or are not
    certain about the opportunities that the new solutions might offer [42]. Nonetheless,
    managers proactively looking for the newest technologies on the market may successfully
    adopt such innovations. According to Shane and Venkataraman [86] and Corbett [87],
    the perception of the opportunity is the key prerequisite for any entrepreneurial
    action and investment. More specifically, Adrian et al. [42] demonstrated that
    SMEs owners/managers who perceived a net benefit and had a higher level of confidence
    in smart agriculture technologies showed greater propensity to adopt them. Hence,
    we hypothesize: HP2 The allocation of investment into 4.0 technological innovations
    is positively related to the managerial perception of the opportunity behind the
    technology adoption. 2.3. The role of the external environment The external environment
    plays a crucial role in the adoption of new technologies (e.g., [88]). However,
    past studies have shown that the strategic management of technology also depends
    on the decision-maker’s perception of the external environment, which does not
    mirror the objective realities of the environment (e.g. [89]). Some studies embrace
    the process view that the decision-maker’s perception of the environment overwrites
    the objective measurement of the characteristics of the environment itself [[89],
    [90], [91]]. Therefore, the perception of the external environment becomes crucial
    to the strategic management of technology. Traditional literature, indeed, has
    pointed at the key role of environmental scanning in the strategy-making process
    [90,92]. While looking at the external factors affecting the adoption of new technologies,
    past studies [93] have stressed the role of vertical linkages as conduits for
    the flow of technology to rural communities. According to Premkumar & Roberts
    [88], vertical linkages can be seen as means that provide the necessary support
    to adopt online data access. In general term, DeLone [40] reported that SMEs depend
    on external support. Therefore, we argue that supporting infrastructures are fundamental
    for the management of any enterprise [94]. Good availability of business services,
    such as commercial, legal, financial, but especially IT and digital consultancy,
    enables managers of SMEs to better focus on their core business – production –
    while delegating some aspects to other stakeholders, thereby attaining efficiency
    and specialization advantages [95]. In other words, in order to invest in technologies,
    managers need to feel sure that they have a proper supporting external environment
    [37]. Consequently: HP3 The allocation of investment into 4.0 technological innovations
    is positively related to the managerial perception of the availability of a supporting
    business environment 3. Material and methods 3.1. Setting Our analysis focuses
    on micro, small and medium firms in the agricultural industry, involved either
    in producing, rearing or growing agricultural products as well as harvesting,
    milking, breeding animals for farming purposes, for grazing or cultivation with
    agricultural methods ([54], Regulation 1782/2003, Article 2). Several technologies
    are available to these firms to apply smart agriculture, and they include: (i)
    Artificial Intelligence, defined as the ability of a computer or robot to perform
    tasks autonomously, without the intervention of human beings [2].; (ii) Big Data
    analytics, that support gathering, organizing, and analyzing data to discover
    trends, correlations, patterns and other valuable information [3]; (iii) Cloud
    Computing, enabling users to store, manage and process data on remote servers
    hosted on the internet, instead of local servers or personal computers [4]; (iv)
    Cyber-Physical Systems, that are mechanisms controlled or monitored by computer-based
    algorithms [5]; (v) Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), encompassing
    all technologies related to telecommunication (both wireless and wired), computer
    technologies, audio-visual systems, storage and software, allowing users to access,
    store, elaborate on, and transmit, manipulate information [6] and finally, the
    (vi) Internet of Things, composed by networked physical devices that connect and
    exchange information and data being incorporated with sensors, connectivity, electronics
    and software [7]. The applications of these 4.0 technologies are heterogeneous
    [13,17]. First, Smart Irrigation and Input Delivery enable farmers to minimize
    water wastage thanks to an IoT system that constantly monitors various parameters
    such as soil temperature, moisture, humidity, and light to calculate the effective
    need for water. Usually, those kinds of systems utilize variable rate technologies
    (VRT) to deliver the right dosage of water, fertilizer and pesticide according
    to soil parameters and needs. These systems often collaborate with other types
    of technologies such as soil sensors, drones and weather tracking and forecasting
    software. Second, Agriculture Drones and Robotics are typically used for cultivation
    mapping and crop health monitoring. Through image recognition algorithms, they
    can sense, detect and categorize plant pests and diseases with an high accuracy.
    They can also scan vast areas of land and work with other sensors to collect a
    wide range of information [14]. Robots (or intelligent farm machines) perform
    several farm functions more efficiently than traditional machines such as autonomously
    detecting the location of ripe fruits on a trellis and pulling them off the branch.
    Telematics and positioning technologies, such as the Global Positioning System
    (GPS), are typically used for in-field machine control. Third, Soil and Plants
    Monitoring Systems collect data and assist farmers in monitoring the quality of
    soil and in avoiding its degradation. They can monitor various physical, chemical
    and biological soil properties (i.e. texture and water-holding). Other sensors
    collect more data about plant composition (microbial makeup, genetic expression,
    etc.) and analyze that data to improve seed research and development [15]. Fourth,
    Yield Monitoring Systems enable farmers to reduce the operational costs and to
    boost productivity by monitoring various aspects affecting agricultural yield
    such as moisture content, grain mass flow and total quantity of harvested grain.
    Fifth, Farm Management Software (FMSs) and Predictive Data Analytics include software
    that allow farmers to more efficiently manage their resources, crop production,
    farm animals, etc. (i.e. weather tracking and forecasting software). They assist
    farmers with information collection and management by relying on diverse sensors
    and tracking devices. By using Big Data and predictive analytics software, those
    systems accurately evaluate the gathered data (i.e. on the conditions of crops,
    soil and air) to address farm-related issues and make better farm-related decisions.
    FMSs includes inventory management software, farm labor management and business
    activities management [16]. Sixth, Precision Livestock consists in real-time monitoring
    of productions, health and welfare of livestock and it aims at ensuring optimal
    yield. It ensures a better understanding livestock, from breeding patterns to
    genomics. The Precision livestock applications include feeding management, heat
    stress management, milk harvesting management, breeding management and behavior
    monitoring and control. Finally, Smart Greenhouses allow farmers to grow their
    horticulture products with minimal human intervention. Factors such as temperature,
    humidity, luminosity, and soil moisture are constantly monitored inside a greenhouse
    and any variation from a predetermined threshold will trigger automated actions
    to keep the optimal condition for plant growth. Smart agriculture technologies
    are believed to have extensive benefits in agriculture, with a prospective large
    economic impact, since they enhance the efficiency reducing the inputs (i.e. water,
    fertilizer, pesticides, seeds, etc.). Several studies on 4.0 technologies have
    shown to significantly increase net returns [[10], [11], [12]]. According to Schieffer
    and Dillon [96], farms endowed with smart agriculture technologies have the chance
    to reduce their environmental impacts, and to improve productivity and profits
    at once. In fact, the wider amount of data made available thanks to 4.0 technologies
    could enable farmers to generate more production with fewer inputs [97]. Smart
    agriculture would make farms’ production systems more efficient and resilient,
    by enabling producers to increase soil yield, to detect crop diseases earlier,
    to reduce water and other inputs wastage, to monitor and control in-farm machines
    and equipment and to provide new inputs to management decision making. Potentially,
    those digital technologies would enable farmers to achieve a quantum leap forward
    in their operational and financial performance, by increasing the overall profitability
    by $55 to $110 per acre [9]. On average, a tractor for smart agriculture costs
    20–30% more than a traditional one, and the cost per hectares can vary widely
    according to the type of 4.0 technology [[98], [99], [100]]. However, if fully
    exploited, the additional cost would pay off after two or three harvests [101].
    3.2. Sample We developed a survey questionnaire and distributed it to farm owners/managers
    in Italy. We collected data between March and June 2018. Italian farms present
    a strong variability in terms of distribution of the agricultural firms and their
    digitalization levels. The research sample included 96 Italian farms (Fig. 2 describes
    their geographical distribution). The respondents to our survey were located mostly
    in the Northern (48%) and Central (35%) regions of Italy, and only a minority
    (17%) in the South. While this distribution might seem in contrast with the spatial
    distribution of agricultural firms in Italy (Italian Institute of Statistics,
    [102]), which appear inversely concentrated (54% in the Southern, 26% in the Central
    and 20% in the Northern regions) it is not at all surprising, given that the process
    of digitalization of agricultural firms in Italy sees firms in the north leading
    at a 4% rate of digitalization, while southern regions limited to 1.3% [103].
    To provide an illustrative figure, nationally, only 1,2% of the agricultural firms’
    management uses regularly the internet, for two main reasons: the average age
    of CEOs (around 55) and the digital divide caused by the lack of digital infrastructures
    and services. Download : Download high-res image (195KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Geographical distribution of Interviewed SMEs. In terms of size,
    only 2.2% of firms in the sample had more than 50 employees, the vast majority
    of farms had less than 10 (88.2%), and 9.7% had between 10 and 50. The farms in
    the research sample exhibited significant variations both in the number of hectares
    and in the type of agricultural activity. In terms of extension, about 39.8% of
    surveyed farms were in the range 10.1–50 hectares, 22% of farms were in the range
    5.1–10 hectares, 14% had agricultural land between 2.1 and 5 ha, and 12.9% had
    more than 100 ha. Finally, very few farms had an area smaller than 2 ha (6.5%)
    and even fewer are very large, between 50.1 and 100 ha (5.3%). As far as agricultural
    activity, about 44% of the surveyed farmers had a vineyard, whereas 34.1% had
    an orchard. The farms that cultivated horticulture products or legumes were about
    29.7%, whereas those that cultivated cereals (grain, rice, etc.) were 23.1%. Similarly,
    24.2% of the total farms reported to be involved in grazing and livestock activities.
    Olive groves accounted for about 22% of the total farms. Regarding the farms’
    adopted technological innovations, software for farm management, data analytics
    and forecast were the most widely available (26.4%). Smart irrigation systems
    and soil, plant, and crop monitoring systems accounted respectively for 11% and
    8.8%. Only 4.4% of surveyed farms had precision livestock systems, whereas higher
    percentages were observed for comprehensive systems of Smart Agriculture (8.8%).
    Moreover, only 1.1% of farms adopted drones or robotics in their farm, and the
    same percentage of farms had invested in smart greenhouses. Conversely, a large
    number of farms (59.3%) followed more traditional cultivation systems and did
    not use any of the 4.0 technologies. 3.3. Measures In this research, all variables
    are self-reported by farm owners/managers. In the next sections, we provide a
    description of the constructs, and their reliability index. 3.3.1. Dependent variable
    The dependent variable of this analysis is the decision to invest in 4.0 technologies
    [104,105]. We consider all the types of technologies included in smart agriculture,
    grouped by application [13]: (i) Smart irrigation and input delivery; (ii) Agriculture
    drones or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs);(iii) Soil and plants monitoring systems;
    (iv) Yield Monitoring Systems; (v) Farm Management Software (FMSs) and Predictive
    Data Analytics; (vi) Precision livestock systems, (vii) Smart greenhouses. Data
    regarding the investment decisions was gathered according to the type of investment
    in smart agriculture solutions. We constructed an indicator (similarly to [42]
    and [43]) based on the complexity and cost of each technology. We assigned each
    technology a value in the range from 0 to 2. Farms with traditional agriculture
    or livestock systems were assigned 0 points, software 1 point, whereas all the
    other technologies were given 2 points. The dependent variable index includes
    the total number of technologies adopted by the farm, and ranges in value from
    0 to 11, with 0 meaning that the farmer currently uses no smart agriculture technologies,
    and 11 if the SME uses all of the technologies included in the study. 3.3.2. Independent
    variables To find out which variables could be included as possible predictors
    of the allocation of investment into 4.0 technological innovations we considered
    that, given characteristics of SMEs, the strategic action of a firm could depend
    on how managers/owners become aware and interpret change and translate their views
    into strategic choice [51]. We also took into account that firms successfully
    respond to a new technological opportunity when managerial cognition, organizational
    capability and environmental incentives are aligned toward the new opportunity
    [60]. Therefore, the underlying assumption to design the scale was that the managerial
    cognition, organizational capabilities, and environmental incentives were meaningful
    variables to take into account. Yet, these links have to be systematically explored
    altogether in the literature [61] and applied to the technology adoption. In order
    to identify the specific constructs uncovering managerial cognition, organizational
    capabilities and environmental incentives, we interviewed CEOs, managers and owners
    of SMEs in agri-food sector. In particular, we collected their opinion on the
    possible drivers of a new technology adoption in terms of factors stimulating
    their attention for the investment, specific organizational capabilities supporting
    the decision to invest, and peculiar environmental characteristics incentivizing
    the adoption of a new technology. Three major components, addressing respectively
    the basic elements in the SMEs owners/managers ‘cognition, the organizational
    capabilities and the environmental incentives, were thus characterized as shaping
    firm strategy during the adoption of a digital technology. Cognitive variables
    refer to the elements attracting managerial attention towards the investment and
    revealing the perceived opportunity behind the adoption of new technologies. Managerial
    capabilities variables are mostly related to the organizational skills and knowledge
    relevant for taking the decision to adopt. Environmental variables refer to opportunities
    a SME can seize from its environment along the technology adoption. Overall, 23
    relevant items were identified based both on the interviews and the literature
    review and applied in the exploratory survey. These items were divided into three
    categories: managerial capabilities, managerial cognition and managerial perception
    of the external environment (Table 1). Table 1. Items identified and categorized
    into Managerial Capabilities, Managerial Cognition and Managerial Perception of
    the External Environment. Macro Component Items Managerial Capabilities I have

    The responses were organized into a 5-point Likert scale (where 1= “totally disagree”
    and 5=”totally agree”). As preliminary step, we performed an exploratory factor
    analysis (EFA) for all items, so as to highlight the emergent latent constructs
    of first and second order. Given the small sample size and the exploratory nature
    of the questions, we took several precautions to prevent sample size and untested
    items from affecting the reliability of the hypothesized model. To that end, we
    consider only those exploratory factors that reach a cumulative explained variance
    of at least 60% [106], and for the composition of factors only those that had
    a factor loading greater than 0.60 ([107], p.274 [108]). According to these authors,
    we can claim that the small sample size does not limit the analysis. Afterwards,
    we calculated Cronbach''s Alpha (α). We accepted the result as a satisfactory
    outcome for all the variables based on the number of items, item intercorrelations,
    and dimensionality, as suggested by [109]; see also for a critic of the a-critic
    use of Cronbach’ Alpha [110,111]). Table 2 reports the results of the EFA based
    on Principal Component Analysis and Varimax rotation indicating the latent factors
    obtained. Items that did not meet the above-mentioned rules were not included
    in the calculation of the latent factors. Table 2. EFA based on Principal Component

    a Rotation converged in 17 iterations. 3.3.3. Control variables Following previous
    studies (e.g., [43,45]) we controlled for several variables potentially influencing
    the adoption of 4.0 technologies for smart agriculture. We chose as control variables
    both farm size by number of employees, and the number of years the surveyed farmer
    has been in the role of owner, CEO or manager. The number of employees represents
    a good proxy of the resources that a farm can dedicate to investments in state-of-the-art
    production systems, thus their effect should be isolated when analyzing the statistical
    relationship between the adoption of smart agriculture technologies and the predictive
    variables. Therefore, we created a categorical variable ranging from a baseline
    value of 1 for enterprises with less than 10 employees to 3 for farms that have
    more than 50. Additionally, since the manager/owner interpretation of technological
    issues might result from accumulations through a variety of experiences, as well
    as education or jobs [60], we have controlled for the decision-makers’ experience
    and education. Regarding CEO, manager or owner experience, we created a categorical
    variable ranging from a baseline value of 1 for decision-makers having between
    two and five years of experience and a maximum value of 6 for decision-makers
    with more than fifty years of experience. We then created a categorical variable
    regarding the level of education of the farm’s decision-maker, ranging from primary/secondary
    education as baseline category to PhD/post-graduate level. Finally land size could
    also affect the adoption of advanced farming technologies. We associated the value
    of 1 to farms of less than two hectares (our reference point), and the maximum
    value of 6 to farms over one hundred hectares. 3.4. Statistical analysis We used
    Stata software to run our statistical analysis. In particular, we used a specific
    type of Poisson Regression, the Negative Binomial Regression, to adjust for over-dispersion,
    because the conditional variance of our dependent variable is higher than the
    conditional mean. The choice of a count data regression model relies on the fact
    that our dependent variable is defined on a discrete and non-negative level [112],
    p. 886. Because our methodology was a maximum likelihood one, no statistics such
    as variance inflation factors (VIFs) were available. Additionally, our results
    remained quite stable across a number of analyses, and this stability, coupled
    with the low correlations among the independent variables, led us to conclude
    that multi-collinearity was not a problem. Finally, our approach is also consistent
    with previous studies such as Castle and colleagues [43] and Paxton and colleagues
    [45]. 4. Results Descriptive statistics including means and standard deviations,
    are presented in Table 3, and inter-correlations are reported in Table 4. The
    results of the Negative Binomial Regression models are reported in Table 5. Model
    5 shows the results of the full model were all the hypotheses were tested together.
    Model 1 shows the result of our first hypothesis (HP1) which speculates about
    a positive relationship between managerial capabilities and the adoption of advanced
    technological innovations. HP1 is confirmed since the coefficient for our latent
    construct “Evidence Based Knowledge”, the knowledge and evidence collected by
    the SME’s decision-maker, is positive, and highly significant (β = 0.721, p < 0.001).
    This model significantly differs from the baseline model (Model 1) LR chi2(1) = 13.96
    and p < 0.001. Table 3. Descriptive Statistics. Variables Mean St.Dev Min Max

    that the allocation of investment into 4.0 technological innovations is positively
    associated with the managerial cognition related to the perception of opportunities
    that the technology can provide. Model 3 shows the coefficients for “Perception
    of technological usefulness”, Economic concerns”, and “Trade-off cost-benefit”
    that represent proxies for the perception of opportunity. More specifically, responding
    to the need to better understand why decision-makers respond to changes in their
    perception of opportunities, we have accounted within the related construct three
    distinct factors. First, in line with Davis [113], we found that perceived usefulness
    is a pivotal element of this construct, as demonstrated by its strong significance
    in the analysis. In particular, perception of the technological usefulness was
    positive and significant (β = 0.309, p < 0.05). In line with Davis [113], we have
    also focused on the cost-benefit paradigm. Previous studies (e.g [113]) have in
    fact showed that the cost-benefit trade-off relates to perceived usefulness and
    ease of use, and thus affects the decision-making strategies. Extant research
    has debated the efficacy of cost-benefit subjective or objective measures (see
    [114]), and while we followed the suggestion to focus on the decision-maker''s
    perceived costs and benefits, we did not find a significant effect of this variable
    within our study. Finally, we have included in the analysis the effect of economic
    concerns. In line with previous literature (see [94]), we didn’t find significance
    for this factor within the analysis. Thus, we partially confirmed our second hypothesis.
    However, this model does not differ from the baseline LR chi2(3) = 5.80 and p = 0.12.
    HP3 states a positive relationship between the managerial perception of the external
    environment and the adoption of advanced agricultural technologies. Model 4 shows
    the results related to the perception of supporting “Business Services”, “Contextual
    Factors” and “Infrastructure Availability”. Previous literature [94,114], has
    built on such indicators to verify existent relation to technological adoption.
    While the role of supporting business services, either in the form of professional
    services or institutional support, has proved a consistently positive relation
    to technology adoption, we were expecting controversial results, which are confirmed
    by the limited significance, from the component related to contextual factors.
    This might be due to the fact that within the contextual latent construct we also
    account for social influence. Controversial evidence was found on the latter by
    previous research (see [114] for a review). Finally, we tested the effect of the
    availability of an infrastructure carrying connectivity and convenience of communication,
    which does not appear to be statistically significant within the study. Among
    these factors both the coefficients related to the satisfaction with the business
    services together with the perception of the availability of cheap and easy communication,
    related to the contextual factors, and more general perception of the environment
    related to financial support and competition were positive and significant (β = 0.553,
    p < 0.001; β = 0.429, p < 0.05). This partially confirms our HP3. Additionally,
    this model is significantly different from the baseline model LR chi2(3) = 13.23
    and p < 0.01. Finally, when we confront the different set of predictions related
    to managerial capabilities, managerial perceptions of opportunity and of the external
    environment related to the explanatory variables emerged from our EFA, we see
    that the pattern and directions of the results is still confirmed (Model 5). Interestingly
    enough, we found that “Evidence Based Knowledge” is still positive, and highly
    significant (β = 0.679, p < 0.01) while the belief about the usefulness of the
    technologies for the agriculture is still positive but its significance was reduced
    at a 90% confidence interval (β = 0.242, p = 0.073). Finally, “Business Service”
    remains positive and significant ((β = 0.394, p < 0.01) while the perception of
    the environment related to the “Contextual Factors” turned to be insignificant
    (β = 0.242, p = 0.073). Additionally, this model differs from the baseline model
    with only controls LR chi2(7) = 25.3 and p < 0.001 further supported by the lower
    value of the Aiken Information Coefficient (i.e. AIC) comparing the two models
    (Model 1 AIC = 274.341 and Model 5 AIC = 263.0397). Moreover, the full model (Model
    5) is also significantly different from the models testing separately our hypotheses.
    Finally, the results remain stable even if we use different analytical strategies,
    such as ordered probit and logit models. Overall, these additional robustness
    checks boost our confidence in the stability and validity of our predictions and
    analysis. 5. Discussion Our study contributes to explain why SMEs adopt 4.0 technologies.
    Relying on the interviews with SMEs’ owners/managers we were able to identify
    the specific elements explaining the organizational capabilities, managerial cognition,
    and environmental incentives that affect the managerial decision to allocate investment
    on digital technological innovations. Thus, our study not only addresses the issue
    of scope limitation experienced by previous literature (such as a too strict focus
    on usage or success or little empirical research, often limited in scope, see
    [37,39,88]), but also allows to focus more thoroughly on the relevant specific
    aspects driving the decision to adopt new digital technology within SMEs. We were
    indeed able to account and separate the effect of single organizational, cognitive
    and environmental dimensions. This is an important aspect of the study, since
    each of these dimensions offers CEOs, managers or owners different stimuli for
    decision-making, embedding different endogenous or exogenous elements to the firm.
    This novelty element is reflected in the study design, and more specifically in
    the selection of the proxies used to test our Hypothesis 2 and 3. While Hypothesis
    1 confirmed the importance of organizational capabilities related to the search
    for evidence-based knowledge by the SME’s decision-maker, the constructs of perception
    of opportunity and supporting business environment required a more detailed analysis.
    They represent, indeed, multi-dimensional constructs, involving a variety of factors
    able to capture the complexity involved in the decision of adopting a new technology.
    Our results showed that, beyond the role of the search for evidence-based knowledge,
    only specific cognitive or environmental aspects are statistically related to
    the allocation of investment. In particular, we found that across the different
    factors the ones strongly associated to the adoption of new technology are the
    one related to attention-triggering elements, such as the perception of technological
    usefulness, or external pressures such as business services are found to be more
    relevant than economic concerns or cost-benefits beliefs. A possible explanation
    can be found in the fact that managerial cognition is related to environmental
    incentives and organizational capabilities [60] as they all affected the decision-makers
    in the need to rely on their repertoires of accumulated knowledge to interpret
    situations and make strategic decisions [115,60]. By doing so, we have been able
    to confirm the importance of organizational capabilities, managerial cognition
    and environmental incentives as we proved that all of them affect the decision
    to adopt a new digital technology and to identify the specific sub-dimensions
    that are statistically relevant for the decision of investing in new digital technology.
    Our study, thus, sheds light on the role of SMEs managers'' perceptions and their
    impact on strategic action. In fact, in line with the current literature that
    stresses the links between strategic responses and events and managerial cognition
    [82], we focus on the managerial beliefs underlying the adoption decision, rather
    than on the adoption per se. Our results direct future scholarly attention to
    patterns of beliefs regarding the external environment, and the relationship between
    beliefs and action, since strategic action will be influenced by these patterns,
    in either speed or content. More generally, our study suggests a more complex
    picture of the interplay between the above-mentioned factors that needs further
    investigations. Another important aspect our study underlines is the potential
    interplay between managerial cognition and organizational capabilities, since
    our results suggest that managerial attention can partially compensate for lack
    of capabilities [116] by seeking new evidence-based knowledge. A manager’s attention
    to a new technology could be a forward-looking force that drives search efforts
    in new arenas [117]. Our study shows that, while leveraging on organizational
    capabilities to scan the environment to seek for evidence-based knowledge, managers’
    build on their beliefs about the usefulness of the technology and the knowledge
    about the technology itself can further compensate the lack of opportunities present
    in the external environment in fostering the adoption of new technologies [42].
    Thus, we acknowledge the pivotal role of the owner/manager within SMEs, who seeks,
    filters, selects and uses evidence and information simultaneously in the decision-making
    process. Normatively, in line with Kaplan [60], we suggest that a major problem
    related to the adoption of a new digital technology may reside in the fact that
    decision-makers might lack relevant knowledge, hindering thus strategic actions,
    and that the organizational capabilities architecture might limit the chance to
    act on the perceived opportunities and environmental incentives, especially when
    solid routines are in place. Our study also underlined the elements able to trigger
    managerial attention and shape the decision to invest, providing a more complete
    explanation of the phenomenon of technology adoption by SMEs (e.g., [50]). 5.1.
    Managerial implications Our study offers new insights for managers and practitioners.
    First, we confirm that organizational routines and capabilities to collect evidence-based
    knowledge affect decisions of investment allocation in 4.0 technology. This is
    a pivotal finding in the case of SMEs, because decision-making is strongly centralized
    and relies in the apical actor of the organization [74], and individual cognition
    may compensate for lack of resources. A straightforward implication for manufacturers
    of smart agriculture technologies might be to modify their communication strategies
    with business consumers, by building on their absorptive capacity and their accumulation
    of knowledge, in order to increase the responsiveness owners/managers to technical
    change and investment decisions. Second, given the significant role of the owner/manager,
    we could not leave aside the relevance of his/her cognition in the investment
    allocation decision. This finding also carries relevant implications for technology
    suppliers, who might want to offer additional support to business customers, for
    example through ad-hoc training programs aimed at illustrating the latest technologies
    on the market, and the benefits of smart agriculture in terms of efficiency, cost
    savings, profitability and sustainability. Finally, our insight on the crucial
    role of supporting services in the investment allocation decision suggests that
    such services can provide decision-makers additional information and support in
    processing data to enhance the IT adoption process. Ecosystem actors, such policy-makers,
    but also technology suppliers or business partners, could focus on the establishment
    of a proper supporting business services environment. 5.2. Limitations Our study
    presents some limitations that need to be acknowledged. The analysis has geographical
    restrictions, both at cross-country and country level. First, we surveyed farm
    holders only in Italy. Repeating the survey in countries other than Italy could
    potentially reveal a different scenario in terms of the relative importance of
    the factors analyzed in this study. Second, Italy presents a strong variability
    in terms of distribution of the agricultural firms and their digitalization levels,
    as described in the sample section. Additionally, our cross-sectional design prevents
    us to claim causal inferences. However, our analytic strategy and robustness checks
    give us confidence in the stability and validity of the obtained results. Future
    studies could adopt experimental or longitudinal design in order to address this
    limitation. Furthermore, the inclusion of hard data concerning the actual macroeconomic
    conditions of a country could reveal why some countries are more proactive in
    investing in digital innovations than others. Such considerations could explain
    why North America has been more “fertile” grounds for smart agriculture as opposed
    to the rest of the world, both in terms of number of hi-tech start-ups and extent
    of digitalized land (Roland [118]). 6. Conclusions 4.0 technologies for smart
    agriculture bring several benefits to agricultural SMEs, in terms of increased
    yields, reduced costs, bigger profits, more information for better decisions,
    and sustainability. But the penetration of such digital technologies in farms
    is still circumscribed and slow, despite the compelling social, environmental
    and sustainability challenges of the next decades. In answer to this dilemma,
    we provide insights on the reasons why the adoption of 4.0 technologies within
    SMEs is still limited. We do not focus on adoption per se, but rather on the managerial
    beliefs underlying the adoption decision, such as the perception of opportunity,
    the active search for evidence-based knowledge, or the perception of a proper
    supporting external environment. These elements may trigger managerial attention
    and shape the response to the opportunity to adopt a new IT solution. We analyze
    data collected by surveying 96 Italian agricultural SMEs owners/managers, and
    examine the role of managerial cognition, organizational capabilities and perception
    in the adoption of 4.0 technologies for smart agriculture. Our work can help hi-tech
    start-ups, established companies and governments in developing the right strategies
    and policies to spread digital innovation in the agricultural sector. Current
    literature still needs to understand the factors influencing the farmers’ decisions
    to adopt Smart Solutions, and future research might indeed extend our model looking
    at more complex interplay between our variables or identifying new factors that
    will provide additional insights. References [1] E. Maddalena Smart Farm: di cosa

    Abstract: The study sought to: (1) evaluate agriculturalists’ characteristics
    as adopters of IoT smart

    agriculture technologies, (2) evaluate traits fostering innovation adoption, (3)
    evaluate the cycle

    of IoT smart agriculture adoption, and, lastly, (4) discern attributes and barriers
    of information

    communication. Researchers utilized a survey design to develop an instrument composed
    of eight

    adoption constructs and one personal characteristic construct and distributed
    it to agriculturalists at

    an agricultural exposition in Rio Grande do Sul. Three-hundred-forty-four (n =
    344) agriculturalists

    responded to the data collection instrument. Adopter characteristics of agriculturalists
    were educated,

    higher consciousness of social status, larger understanding of technology use,
    and more likely

    identiﬁed as opinion leaders in communities. Innovation traits advantageous to
    IoT adoption

    regarding smart agriculture innovations were: (a) simplistic, (b) easily communicated
    to a targeted

    audience, (c) socially accepted, and (d) larger degrees of functionality. Smart
    agriculture innovation’s

    elevated levels of observability and compatibility coupled with the innovation’s
    low complexity were

    the diffusion elements predicting agriculturalists’ adoption. Agriculturalists’
    beliefs in barriers to

    adopting IoT innovations were excessive complexity and minimal compatibility.
    Practitioners or

    change agents should promote IoT smart agriculture technologies to opinion leaders,
    reduce the

    innovation’s complexity, and amplify educational opportunities for technologies.
    The existing sum

    of IoT smart agriculture adoption literature with stakeholders and actors is descriptive
    and limited,

    which constitutes this inquiry as unique.

    Keywords: diffusion barriers; sustainability; Industry 4.0 technologies; agricultural

    1. Introduction

    The technological pillars of the Industry 4.0 revolution include Internet of Things

    (IoT), machine learning (ML), artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), robots, drones, 5-
    and 6G systems,

    blockchain, virtual and augmented reality, and 3D printing [1]. Improving adoption
    of

    smart agricultural technologies is a focus of global institutions and organizations
    [2]. Agri-

    cultural extension’s success in disseminating information that promotes farmers’
    adoption

    of contemporary agricultural technology is critical in the adoption cycle [3].
    Kilelu, van

    der Lee, Koge, and Klerkx [4] identiﬁed that farmers’ minimal adoption of technology

    negatively affected the demand of Service Providers Enterprises. Knowledge and
    compre-

    hension of an innovation are necessary for agriculturalists’ adoption and diffusion
    within

    their respective social systems [5,6]. Information and communication technologies
    (ICTs)

    provide indigenous information for marginalized farmers in developing countries
    [6]. The

    ﬁndings of Zambon et al. [7] revealed that, as Industry 4.0 has rapidly advanced
    and is

    approaching 5.0, Agriculture 4.0 is not as extensively adopted by stakeholders
    and is not

    widely examined by agricultural sciences scholars.

    Agriculturalists in developing nations are prone to more production and technological

    barriers than peers in developed nations. Technological and information transmission
    are

    chief barriers experienced by agriculturalists [5]. Low education levels and inadequate

    communications contribute to a lack of adoption of smart agriculture innovations
    [6].

    Some authors [8,9] suggested that optimum behavior change theories exist, but
    a favorable

    singular theory to frame an innovation adoption study does not exist for agriculturalists
    in

    developing nations. Agricultural extension change agents require better comprehension

    of innovation adoption components to improve professional development efﬁcacy
    of

    the adoption cycle [10]. Barriers prohibiting farmers’ adoption of IoT smart agriculture

    technologies may be reduced when professional development experiences for agricultural

    extension personnel are offered.

    Advancements in education have proven to change individual and organizational

    acceptance and use of newer technologies [11]. Extension programming that commu-

    nicates the beneﬁts of the innovation may motivate adoption in local communities
    and

    organizations, thereby improving the lives of individuals and communities. Farmer
    ﬁeld

    schools are a proven outlet to increase agriculturalists’ knowledge respective
    to innova-

    tion’s advantages. Besides the improvement in knowledge, farmer ﬁeld schools can
    beneﬁt

    improving agriculturalists’ perceptions of new innovations in social learning
    environments

    aligning with agriculturalists’ social norms [12,13]. Additionally, educational
    experiences

    improve access to information and can increase marginalized agriculturalists’
    awareness

    of IoT smart agriculture innovations. Using preexisting communications platforms,
    such

    as information communication technologies (ICTs), to educate and communicate inno-

    vations to agriculturalists has proven to expand knowledge transfer [14]. Concurrently,

    communications through existing accepted platforms increase agriculturalists’
    knowledge

    without the peer pressure to make a decision quickly [15]. The internet and IoT
    innovations

    have materialized as practical educational technologies for agriculturalists in
    developing

    countries to improve their knowledge of innovations. Inadequate computers and
    minimal

    intellectual aptitude with technology are barriers to agriculturalists’ adoption
    of the internet

    as an avenue for knowledge transfer [16]. Developing comprehension of agriculturalists’

    educational wishes and gaps addresses chief attributes of enhancing the adoption
    and

    dissemination of innovations in developing nations [17].

    The theoretical framework implemented to assess the extent of IoT smart agriculture

    adoption and diffusion by Rio Grande do Sul agriculturalists was Rogers’ [18]
    diffusion

    of innovations. Diffusion of innovations is globally recognized and employed to
    exam-

    ine technology and information adoption in diverse environments. Rogers’ [18]
    pivotal

    investigations posited the diffusion of innovations was functional to several
    ﬁelds of study,

    including education, business, medicine, and agriculture. Researchers have implemented

    diffusion as the scaffold to examine innovation adoption from various multidisciplinary

    ﬁelds. Interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary inquiries have been developed to
    ascertain

    diffusion theory’s validity in dissimilar environments. MacVaugh and Schiavone
    [19] re-

    ported that increased depth of innovation comprehension of diffusion was accomplished
    at

    various social system stages and subject areas. Information dissemination can
    be depicted

    by the diffusion of innovations at various macro and micro stages. The diffusion
    of inno-

    vations is investigated through the theory’s inclusion in local, national, and
    international

    communities [20]. Evaluating technology adoption has been assessed with diffusion
    of in-

    novations previously. Hilbert [21] harnessed diffusion of innovations to assess
    the impacts

    of technology improvements on Latin American groups and potential outcome impacts.

    Rogers [18] discerned ﬁve principal innovation characteristics that inﬂuence an
    in-

    novation’s adoption and diffusion. The attributes promoting innovation adoption
    are

    the relative advantage of the innovation, its compatibility, the innovation’s
    complexity,

    trialability of the innovation, and the innovation’s visibility, which Rogers
    coined as ob-

    servability. Relative advantage is a perceived advantage of the innovation prior
    to what is

    Sensors 2022, 22, 6833

    3 of 15

    used [18]. An innovation’s relative advantage may be promoted or communicated
    from an

    environmental, economic, or societal lens to improve innovation adoption.

    The extent an innovation is aligned with the subjective norms, needs, and values
    of

    agriculturalists is referred to as compatibility. When an innovation adheres to
    subsequent

    norms of the target audience, agriculturalists are more likely to adopt the innovation.

    Complexity refers to the innovation’s ease of understanding and applied use. Larger

    extents of or substantial variations in perceived complexity produce higher probabilities

    that an innovation will not be adopted.

    The component linked to agriculturalists’ capacity to experiment with an innovation

    is called trialability. Rogers suggested opportunities to provide innovation trialability

    are predicated on utility of access, change agent and opinion leaders’ communication,

    and the innovation’s cost. Elevated trialability experiences produce increased
    likelihoods

    of innovation adoption. Increased experiences regarding innovation trialability
    produce

    higher likelihoods the innovation will be adopted by agriculturalists.

    The extent to which agriculturalists can view traits of the innovation is the
    last attribute,

    referred to as observability. The more an innovation is observable, the higher
    the probability

    the innovation will be adopted within the social system [18].

    Adopters’ categories are based on agriculturalists’ distinctive characteristics.
    Rogers [18]

    outlined ﬁve adopter categories, postulating the progressive shape of the diffusion
    ‘S’

    curve. The adopter classiﬁcations developed in Ref. [18] were the innovators,
    then the

    early adopters, the early majority, the late majority, and, ﬁnally, the laggards.
    Venturesome

    is used to describe the innovators. The innovators more than likely had higher
    ﬁnancial

    resources, a larger extent of intellectual astuteness, and were more apt to accept
    risk.

    The highest level of social status in communities belongs to the early adopter
    members.

    The early adopters possessed higher intelligence and aversion to risk capacities.
    Early

    adopters tend to be older and more established than innovators. Early adopters
    are viewed

    as the most credible adopter classiﬁcation in the social system [18].

    Early majority adopters have similar characteristics to early adopters, with the
    principal

    difference that the early majority members did not have leadership roles (Strong
    et al.) [22].

    Another dissimilarity is early majority members do not possess as much aversion
    to risk as

    innovators and early adopters within social systems.

    The late majority classiﬁcation was identiﬁed as having larger degrees of cynicism
    of

    the innovation’s advantages, but they were inclined to implement the innovation
    upon

    learning it was mandated or required in their agricultural operation. Late majority
    adopters

    likely own less or have less access to ﬁnancial resources than the previous three
    categories

    and are more averse to risk.

    Laggards was the name given to the ﬁfth adopter classiﬁcation. Laggards maintained

    traditional agricultural practices versus adopting contemporary innovations or
    techniques.

    Laggards have limited access to monetary funds, resulting in the highest aversion
    to risk

    compared to any other adopter category.

    Additional scholars have examined individual acceptance of innovations. Gold-

    berg [23] developed the ﬁve-factor model to describe the extent of the effect
    of an in-

    dividual’s personality on their decision to adopt an innovation. Individuals’
    personality

    characteristics elicit large amounts of persuasion on individual adoption [24,25].
    Individu-

    als chose to accept or reject innovations based on their perceived performance
    expectancy

    with the innovation, the effort expectancy with the innovation, social inﬂuences
    promoting

    the innovation, and facilitating conditions that provide organizational infrastructure
    for the

    innovation [26]. However, the authors want to be clear that agriculturalists’
    personalities

    did not constitute the focus or an objective of our study [27].

    The study was implemented to assess the extent of IoT smart agriculture adoption
    and

    diffusion by agriculturalists in the Brazilian province of Rio Grande do Sul.
    Our study’s

    objectives were: (1) to understand innovations’ characteristics of IoT smart agriculture

    that promote adoption and diffusion; (2) to describe agricultural IoT innovations’
    adop-

    Sensors 2022, 22, 6833

    4 of 15

    tion cycle; and (3) to discern the primary attributes of adoption of and resistance
    to IoT

    smart agriculture.

    2. Materials and Methods

    Descriptive and correlational paradigms were our study’s research design. The
    ad-

    vantages of descriptive statistics are the illumination of participants’ beliefs,
    perspectives,

    and potential IoT smart agriculture innovations currently adopted [28]. Analyzing
    any

    potential association among variables, to better understand generalizability,
    was examined

    using correlational statistics [29]. Our multi-dimensional research design provided
    the

    inquiry of current construct discrepancies based on the data collected from agriculturalists

    in Rio Grande do Sul.

    The population of agriculturalists in Rio Grande do Sul was 3289 at the time of
    the

    study. Authors examined 369 similar agriculturalists as a result of the simple
    random

    sampling technique. Data were gathered during meetings of agricultural cooperatives
    in

    Rio Grande do Sul. Researchers limited the sample size to agriculturalists who
    understood

    IoT smart agriculture innovations and approaches cooperatives took to market products,

    information, and technologies to members. Researchers omitted twenty-ﬁve incomplete

    surveys that were submitted, and, therefore, the ﬁnal number in the data analysis
    was

    344 agriculturalists [30].

    Rio Grande do Sul was chosen as the province location due to the population charac-

    teristics of agriculturalists in the region. Agriculturalists were uniform and
    social economic

    status was not signiﬁcantly different among the population. The agriculturalists
    lived

    primarily in rural areas but dispersed geographically in Rio Grande do Sul. Research
    and

    agricultural extension centers are utilized as the central hubs for research and
    sources of

    information. The research team based the IoT smart agriculture adoption instrument
    on

    Moore and Benbasat’s [31] investigating technology innovation adoption assessment.
    Agri-

    cultural professionals in Rio Grande do Sul in collaboration with Texas A&M University

    social science researchers and Auburn University researchers assessed content
    validity

    from four instrument iterations before the instrument was distributed to the population.

    Researchers concentrated on cultural sensitivity and awareness, the intentionality
    of the

    study, and improved the study’s clarity for the population. Global Speak Translations
    was

    used to translate the English instrument to Portuguese, as Portuguese is the indigenous

    Brazilian language, to improve response rate and reduce measurement error. Due
    to the

    English-ﬁrst culture of the research team and the Portuguese-ﬁrst language paradigm
    of the

    agriculturalist population, all items in the instrument were developed to reduce
    sampling

    error, coverage error, measurement error, and nonresponse error to improve agriculturalists’

    discernment and enable participants to respond correctly [32].

    An instrument composed of nine sections was implemented for the data collection.

    The instrument’s construction and supervision were advised by the tailored design
    method

    from Dillman et al. [32]. A personal demographics division and eight attitudinal
    vari-

    ables were housed in the instrument. The instrument contained a summated scale
    with:

    1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = neither agree nor disagree, 4 = agree,
    and 5 = strongly

    agree in order to measure all attitudinal variables. Higher attitudinal scores
    equated with

    more positivity of IoT smart agriculture innovations. Voluntariness of IoT adoption,
    relative

    advantage of IoT smart agriculture, compatibility of IoT smart agriculture, image
    of IoT

    smart agriculture, IoT smart agriculture ease of use, IoT smart agriculture demonstrability,

    IoT smart agriculture visibility, and the trialability of IoT smart agriculture
    innovations

    were the attitudinal variables assessed in the instrument.

    Voluntariness of adoption of the innovation was examined with four items. Nine

    items were used to measure IoT smart agriculture innovation’s relative advantage.
    Four

    items measured compatibility and ﬁve questions assessed the image construct. Four

    items examined demonstrability and eight statements assessed the ease-of-use variable.

    Five items were utilized to assess visibility and trialability. Participants’
    age, level of

    Sensors 2022, 22, 6833

    5 of 15

    education acquired, gender, and current profession were all the personal or demographic

    characteristics gathered in the study.

    We pilot tested the questionnaire in Rio Grande do Sul with 33 agricultural individuals.

    Our pilot test examined the validity and reliability of the survey instrument.
    We revised

    the instrument based on the validity and reliability pilot data. Our team implemented

    Cronbach’s alpha coefﬁcients to measure the internal consistency of all items
    within each

    respective construct. Cronbach theorized reliability coefﬁcients are a social
    science indicator

    for assessing the extent an instrument will produce consistent results [33]. Cronbach’s

    alpha coefﬁcients provide an interconnected mean among items within an instrument
    [34].

    In the social sciences, alpha coefﬁcients greater than 0.07 are the lowest threshold
    for

    instrument reliability, with 1 as the highest coefﬁcient threshold [35]. Rogers’
    relative

    advantage yielded the highest internal consistency with a 0.90, then compatibility
    at 0.86,

    complexity produced a 0.84, the innovation’s visibility was 0.83, voluntariness
    was 0.82,

    demonstrability yielded a 0.79, also a 0.79 for the innovations image, and the
    trialability

    construct produced a coefﬁcient of 0.71 [36].

    SPSS 27 was used to analyze data collected. An alpha level of 0.05 signiﬁcance
    was

    instituted a priori [33,34]. Dispersion of the data was measured using central
    tendency

    and standard deviations [36]. Frequencies and categorical data were utilized to
    illustrate

    categorical data. Authors implemented a regression analysis to describe interactions
    among

    variables. To measure the associations between variables, the authors employed
    a stepwise

    regression model [33]. The variance among constructs was examined using principal

    component analyses to describe, explain, and enhance interpretation of the data
    [35]. The

    variables were analyzed using summated scales. Summated scales offered an analytical

    foundation to discern and develop implications for the previously identiﬁed variables.

    The differences, statistically, were analyzed among late and early participant
    respon-

    ders to ensure the study’s external validity [37]. The authors implemented an
    ANOVA

    and t-tests to analyze the differences among late and early participant responders.
    There

    were no statistical discrepancies among early and late participant respondents.
    Outlined

    by Lindner et al. [37], our data are generalizable to the population represented
    in the study.

    3. Results

    Our initial objective was to understand the innovation characteristics of IoT
    smart

    agriculture that promote adoption and diffusion in the province. Agriculturalists’
    individ-

    ual attributes were assessed to understand the innovation and the innovation’s
    adoption

    characteristics. In order to understand the innovation’s characteristics, agriculturalists’

    personal characteristics and responses of agriculturalists were used to identify
    innovative

    traits. Mean scores above 4.0 were representative of positive innovation traits.
    Scores

    ranging from 2 to 3.9 illustrated less advantageous or neutral innovation traits.
    Innovation

    elements with mean scores < 1.9 represented negative traits that would prohibit
    adoption

    or slow down the adoption cycle. Each attribute’s weight was evaluated by frequency

    statistics. The eight variables included in the instrument were examined for desirable,

    neutral, and undesirable traits, leading to adoption and diffusion or rejection.

    Voluntariness’ traits of adoption was the ﬁrst variable we measured. Expectation

    of use, voluntariness of use, mandated use, and the usefulness perceptions of
    IoT smart

    agriculture technologies were assessed by four items. The authors reverse coded
    items “I

    am not required to use technology as part of my job”, including “Technology is
    helpful per-

    forming my job” to reduce agreement absentmindedness issues identiﬁed by Dillman
    et al.

    Agriculturalists’ reported use expectation produced the largest (M = 4.34, SD
    = 0.55) vol-

    untariness inspiration in the adoption cycle illustrated in Table 1. Positive
    adoption traits

    included required use, voluntary use, and the innovation’s perceived use due to
    mean

    scores over 4.0. Required use yielded the strongest weight of inﬂuencing an innovation’s

    adoption by more than 95% of agriculturalists. A vast majority of agriculturalists
    (97%)

    reported the anticipation of using the innovation contributed to the adoption,
    implying

    individual objectives and social inﬂuence were predictive indicators of voluntariness.
    The

    Sensors 2022, 22, 6833

    6 of 15

    grand mean was 4.29 (SD = 0.53) and Cronbach’s alpha was 0.77. The anchors to
    assess

    voluntariness were: 1 = Strongly Disagree, 2 = Disagree, 3 = Neither Agree nor
    Disagree,

    4 = Agree, and 5 = Strongly Agree.

    produc-

    ing higher-quality staff, increased individual agility, and enhanced agricultural
    productivity

    were the items used to assess IoT smart agriculture’s relative advantage. The
    item earning

    the highest mean score (M = 4.42, SD = 0.61) was easier daily work goals. Items
    earning

    mean scores > 4.0 indicating positive attributes included IoT smart agriculture
    that achieves

    objectives quicker, improving professional outcomes, enhancing agricultural productivity,

    producing higher-quality staff, and increasing individual agility. Making life
    routines

    simpler earned the lowest mean (M = 3.35, SD = 1.22), deemed a neutral versus
    a positive

    characteristic. Researchers examined the inﬂuence of the neutrality by excluding
    making

    life routines simpler from another round of Cronbach’s alpha analysis to determine
    the

    reliability coefﬁcient. The majority of agriculturalists (93%) believed IoT smart
    agriculture

    innovations rendered them an easier lifestyle. The grand mean for relative advantage
    was

    M = 4.19, SD = 0.87, and 0.82 was the reliability coefﬁcient. Attributes were
    measured with

    anchors: 1 = Strongly Disagree, 2 = Disagree, 3 = Neither Agree nor Disagree,
    4 = Agree,

    and 5 = Strongly Agree (see Table 2).

    Compatibility was examined from agriculturalists’ responses to items representative

    of the extent speciﬁc innovations were recognized as congruent with work mandates,

    augment current work techniques, align with work expectations, and align with
    lifestyle.

    The highest compatibility mean score (M = 3.94, SD = 0.74) was produced by a capacity

    to align with agriculturalists’ work expectations. Mean scores for each assessed
    attribute

    earned scores from 2.0 to 3.90 as almost 80% of agriculturalists reported agreement
    or

    strong agreement. Data indicated IoT smart agriculture innovation compatibility
    traits

    were neutral statistically or not as suitable for adoption. The capacity of an
    innovation to

    align with agriculturalists’ work expectations and the capability of incorporation
    in their

    daily lifestyle was reported by 70% of agriculturalists. Compatibility’s grand
    mean was

    3.85 (SD = 0.8) and the reliability coefﬁcient was 0.82 (see Table 3). The scale
    was measured

    with: 1 = Strongly Disagree, 2 = Disagree, 3 = Neither Agree nor Disagree, 4 =
    Agree,

    5 = Strongly Agree.

    In order to assess image, four attributes were asked of agriculturalists: IoTs
    improve

    an individual’s image, agriculturalists acquire more value in society, increased
    recognition

    from social systems, and if IoTs are representations of status. IoTs improve an
    individual’s

    image was the highest attribute (M = 3.79, SD = 0.72) on agriculturalists’ decision
    to adopt

    IoT smart agriculture technology. Next, agriculturalists acquire more value in
    society

    (M = 3.35, SD = 0.94) earned the second highest mean. Based on mean scores (between

    3.11 and 3.79), the data indicated image attributes were neutral at best. The
    belief IoT smart

    agriculture adoption provided a liftoff for agriculturalists’ image was accepted
    by 67%

    of the agriculturalists participating in our study. More than 50% of agriculturalists
    did

    not respond positively to IoT smart agriculture enhancing peers of society’s judgement

    as a whole of agriculturalists, including their social status. Image’s grand mean
    was 3.41

    (SD = 0.96) and image’s reliability coefﬁcient was 0.81 (see Table 4). The instrument
    anchors

    were: 1 = Strongly Disagree, 2 = Disagree, 3 = Neither Agree nor Disagree, 4 =
    Agree,

    5 = Strongly Agree.

    Transparency

    of IoT smart agriculture usage had the highest mean score (M = 3.87, SD = 0.68)
    and usage

    procedures are easy to cognitively retain (M = 3.83, SD = 0.77) was next. Each
    ease of

    use attribute was assessed to be the most neutral and at the least not containing
    desired

    innovation traits, and 75% of agriculturalists reported transparency of IoT smart
    agriculture

    use was important to them. Data indicated use consistency and the stable ease
    of use had

    the lowest levels of importance due to < 50% of agriculturalists reporting strongly
    agree or

    agree. Ease of use’s grand mean was 3.57 (SD = 0.89) and yielded a reliability
    coefﬁcient

    of 0.92 (see Table 5). The survey anchors included: 1 = Strongly Disagree, 2 =
    Disagree,

    3 = Neither Agree nor Disagree, 4 = Agree, 5 = Strongly Agree.

    Demonstrability, the sixth dissemination attribute variable, was assessed by attributes:

    prompt identiﬁable outcomes, communication easiness to social system peers, demon-

    stration easiness to social system peers, and identiﬁable advantages for agriculturalists.

    Agriculturalists reported prompt identiﬁable outcomes as the chief demonstratability
    char-

    acteristic (M = 3.92, SD = 0.71) due to 79% indicated agreement to strong agreement.
    All

    use of IoT smart agriculture is observable, noticeable in social system’s agricultural
    opera-

    tions, clear ﬂexibility of IoT smart agriculture innovations, and IoT smart agriculture
    usage

    in the community. The highest scoring mean was social system use of IoT smart
    agriculture

    is observable (M = 4.16, SD = 0.63) and 90% of agriculturalists agreed to strongly
    agreed.

    Agriculturalists further reported agreement of IoT smart agriculture innovations
    noticeable

    in social system’s agricultural operations (M = 4.07, SD = 0.66). Both clear ﬂexibility
    of

    IoT smart agriculture innovations and IoT smart agriculture usage in the community
    were

    neutral or non-desirable characteristics. The grand mean for visibility was 3.96
    (SD = 0.71)

    and the construct produced a reliability coefﬁcient of 0.94 (see Table 7). The
    visibility an-

    chors were: 1 = Strongly Disagree, 2 = Disagree, 3 = Neither Agree nor Disagree,
    4 = Agree,

    5 = Strongly Agree.

    Trialability was our last variable to assess and was measured using ﬁve attributes.
    The

    characteristics included the easiness of ﬁnding new IoT smart agriculture technologies,

    new experiences with IoT smart agriculture technologies, adequate to experiment
    with IoT

    smart agriculture technologies, convenience of IoT smart agriculture technologies
    usage,

    and opportunities to test IoT smart agriculture technologies. Indeed, 62% of agriculturalists

    reported some level of agreement with the easiness of ﬁnding new IoT smart agriculture

    technologies (M = 3.67, SD = 0.89). Agriculturalists reported opportunities for
    new experi-

    ences with IoT smart agriculture technologies met trialability metrics (M = 3.56,
    SD = 0.92).

    Data indicated all trialability attributes were not positive. Agriculturalists
    reported < 50%

    agreed the timeframe to acquire and test IoT smart agriculture was adequate. Trialability’s

    grand mean was 3.41 (SD = 0.94) and the construct produced a reliability coefﬁcient

    Our third objective sought to identify IoT smart agriculture’s adoption cycle
    by Rio

    Grande do Sul agriculturalists. The researchers categorized agriculturalists into
    adopter

    categories: (1) innovators, (2) early adopters, (3) early majority, (4) late majority,
    and (5) lag-

    gards based on the results from responses to the eight adoption variables. The
    researchers

    sought to comprehend agriculturalists’ characteristics speciﬁc to each individual
    classiﬁ-

    cation. Adopting IoT smart agriculture voluntarily was used to determine voluntariness.

    IoT smart agriculture offering opportunities for simpler work was the innovation’s
    relative

    advantage, and the extent agriculturalists incorporated IoT smart agriculture
    into their

    agricultural operation indicated compatibility. Status symbol responses were utilized
    to

    determine image, and IoTs manageable characteristics were employed to answer easiness

    of usage. Demonstrability and visibility were assessed using the promptness of
    IoT smart

    agriculture outcomes and the simpleness of observable use in communities. Agricultur-

    alists’ capacity to experiment with IoT smart agriculture technologies was implemented

    to measure trialability. Innovators were assigned to those reporting strong agreement
    to

    all eight variables. Early adopters were designated to agriculturalists responding
    with

    agreement to strong agreement but removing innovator responses. The early majority
    was

    determined by examining agriculturalists responding neither agree or disagree,
    agree, or

    strongly agree in the eight constructs but not previously categorized as early
    adopters

    or innovators. Agriculturalists were identiﬁed in the late majority if responding
    strongly

    agree, agree, neither agree or disagree, and disagree and not initially assigned
    to the inno-

    vator, early adopter, or early majority classiﬁcations. Seventeen agriculturalists
    perceived

    themselves as laggards and one agriculturalist reported being an innovator (see
    Table 9).

    At the conclusion of the adopter category analyses, the researchers implemented
    a

    stepwise regression model. The purpose of the stepwise regression model was to
    categorize

    IoT smart agriculture adopters from examining each variable attribute. Our independent
    or

    antecedent variables were the voluntariness of the innovation, IoTs’ relative
    advantage, IoTs’

    compatibility, agriculturalists’ image from adoption of IoTs, IoTs’ easiness of
    usage, IoTs’

    demonstrability, the visibility of IoTs, and the extent IoTs were trialable. The
    dependent

    variable was adopter classiﬁcations.

    The stepwise regression ﬁndings revealed, out of 45 items, nine attributes described

    63.8% of adoption variance. Antecedent variables are delineated in Table 10. Data
    from

    the stepwise regression indicated adoption was enlarged as agriculturalists’ pressure
    from

    peers also increased. The robustness of attitudes regarding IoT smart agriculture
    enhanced

    Sensors 2022, 22, 6833

    10 of 15

    productivity, and higher levels of adopter classiﬁcations regarding life routines
    were

    achieved. The individual’s work, the perception of using technology as a status
    symbol, the

    perception that technology is easy to manipulate, observing others in the community
    using

    technology, the ability to easily communicate technology, and the ability to properly
    test a

    new innovation were found to enhance the adoption process. Agriculturalists reporting

    challenges in feeling the initial impact of IoT smart agriculture was an indicator
    of those

    individuals moving down the adopter classiﬁcations, resulting in nonadoption.
    Earning

    statistically signiﬁcance were demonstrability, agriculturalists’ image, IoTs’
    voluntary

    adoption, IoT smart agriculture observability, and opportunities for IoT trialability
    with

    p < 0.05. Not statistically signiﬁcant indicators of adopter classiﬁcations were
    IoTs’ relative

    advantage, IoTs’ compatibility, and IoTs’ easiness of use. The stepwise regression
    model

    produced R2 = 0.64, F = 43.11.

    Our study’s fourth aim sought to describe primary characteristics and IoT smart

    agriculture resistors precluding innovation adoption in Rio Grande do Sul. A stepwise

    regression was employed to assess innovation rejection attributes predicting knowledge

    transfer barriers. The researchers included dummy variables. Non-adopters were
    denoted

    with a zero value and adopters were identiﬁed with one as their numerical value.
    All

    attributes within our instrument were employed as antecedent variables in the
    stepwise

    regression. The signiﬁcant attributes were utilized to describe characteristics
    of IoT smart

    agriculture innovations impacting rate of adoption. Table 11 illustrates the SPSS

    nololgies improving social status, were not challenging to use, were easily observable,
    and

    offered an adequate timeframe for agriculturalists to test positively inﬂuenced
    stakeholder

    adoption and diffusion. On the contrary, IoT smart agriculture innovations solely
    making

    routibnes easier, not easily manageable, not perceived as increasing performance,
    and were

    complex to understand were not indicative of IoT smart agriculture adoption or
    diffusion.

    As one unit increased, the probability of adoption increased. As a unit of my
    social system

    wants me using IoT smart agriculture technology increased by 0.04, the probability

    R2 = 0.42, F = 14.93 and * p < 0.05.

    4. Discussion

    Communication methods, strategies, and accessibility are not keeping pace with
    the ex-

    ponential rate that new IoT smart agriculture technologies are being introduced.
    Improving

    communication rates, outlets, and accessibility is paramount to increase the rate
    of adoption

    as future multifaceted IoT smart agriculture innovations increase with advancements
    in

    technology [5,6]. If conventional communication channels do not have the capability
    to

    successfully communicate the advantageous innovation attributes to agriculturalists,
    then

    the low rate of adoption will persist. Based on Rogers [18], in a social system,
    change agents

    should emphasize relationship building, development, and communication of opinion

    leaders to improve the communication of positive attributes of IoT smart agriculture
    to

    stakeholders in order to enhance the rate of adoption. We recommend information
    dis-

    semination for the agriculturalist be aligned with the innovation’s characteristics
    and the

    targeted audience goals and individual characteristics.

    Complex IoT smart agriculture futures markets exhibited a reduced frequency of

    engagement in the population. This study revealed proﬁts from IoT smart agriculture

    adoption served as a relative advantage for agriculturalists and would enhance
    adoption

    over potential risks by providing economic incentives [38]. Reducing the innovation’s
    com-

    plexity coupled with purposeful and succinct communication of the IoT smart agriculture

    technology’s advantages to agriculturalists and opinion leaders will improve adoption

    and diffusion within the social system. Our data indicated targeting communications
    at

    agriculturalists’ work location and in localized communities would offer the maximum

    successful strategies to disseminate IoT smart agriculture information. It is
    imperative for

    practitioners to communicate the beneﬁts of IoT smart agriculture technologies
    to agricul-

    tural owners and managers, as well as community leaders, to advance the livelihoods
    and

    sustainability of individuals and resulting community impacts. Communications
    from

    researchers to practitioners and practitioners to agriculturalists have to be
    distinct and

    succinct for the adoption cycle and diffusion of IoT smart agriculture technologies
    [39].

    Organizations promoting IoT smart agriculture ought to have the innovations promptly

    accessible for agriculturalists as soon as individuals have decided to test the
    technology

    per the trialability stage to improve the rate of adoption [18]. Avenues exist
    to increase IoT

    smart agriculture adoption, such as farmer ﬁeld schools, the Ministry of Agriculture
    and in-

    stitutional research stations in local communities, vocational education at local
    agricultural

    colleges, and agricultural ﬁeld days and expositions [40].

    To improve IoT smart agriculture adoption, we recommend newer innovations be

    visually appealing to stakeholders. As identiﬁed by Rogers [18], practitioner
    comprehen-

    sion of social status and pressure from peers are critical for enhancing the adoption
    rate of

    early and late majority agriculturalists. The data indicated that resources for
    promoting IoT

    smart agriculture adoption ought to be understandable, practical, and offer client-oriented

    technical advice for the targeted audience so as to reduce the innovation’s complexity

    beliefs [41]. Ideally, IoT smart agriculture innovations would be diverse in application
    and

    functionality for agriculturalists.

    The data did not specify educational discrepancies between agricultural adopters

    and resistors. Both adopters and rejectors of the innovation had attained equal
    levels of

    education. We recommend that change agents striving to promote successful adoption
    and

    diffusion of IoT smart agriculture emphasize enriching the innovation’s communication

    and purposely training the target audiences, resulting in progressively inﬂuencing
    IoT

    smart agriculture’s adoption [11].

    Additional Brazilian smart agriculture adoption and diffusion research questions

    were revealed throughout the study, warranting future examination. Inquiries centered

    on diffusion in developing nations are limited in number and breadth. We recommend

    Sensors 2022, 22, 6833

    12 of 15

    replicating our study in other regions of the world to increase our collective
    understanding

    of IoT smart agriculture stakeholders, adoption characteristics, and the resulting
    impacts of

    IoT adoption.

    The impact of opinion leadership during the adoption cycle was statistically signiﬁcant

    on the prospect of adoption and diffusion. The greater the social status bestowed
    to the

    innovation’s adoption, the more this inﬂuenced IoT smart agriculture adoption
    in our

    study [18]. Rejectors of innovations bequeath trust on adopters and opinion leaders
    based

    on their decisions, but the level trust is not necessarily a tipping point characteristic
    for

    rejectors to move to the title of adopter. However, measuring trust and the resulting

    variance trust sways in the adoption cycle, from an unequivocal paradigm, is challenging

    to ascertain. Discerning the signiﬁcance of trust as a construct that predicts
    or inﬂuences

    the adoption cycle is worthy of additional investigation. Future studies should
    assess

    techniques or approaches that change agents could employ to positively promote
    IoT smart

    agriculture adoption among stakeholders.

    As one of the largest agricultural producers in the Western Hemisphere, understanding

    Brazilian agriculturalists’ adoption and rejection of innovations designed to
    improve food

    security and sustainability [42] is a necessity given agriculturalists’ impact
    locally, nationally,

    and across the continent and the world. Extra analysis into the IoT smart agriculture

    adoption cycle is necessary throughout Brazil and South America to assess innovation
    traits

    and personal characteristics of adopters that potentially promote adoption and
    diffusion.

    The supplementary data would expand our body of knowledge and potentially allow

    generalizability on a much larger scale [6].

    Our study demonstrated the dissimilarity among age between adopters and those

    rejecting the IoT smart agriculture innovations. The literature indicated more
    training

    and educational opportunities for agriculturalists enhances their acceptance of
    the latest

    technologies regardless of the individual’s age [5]. Additional inquiries are
    needed to

    investigate impactful communication channels improving the communication of smart

    agriculture’s positive characteristics from researchers to practitioners and then
    practitioners

    to agriculturalists.

    Societal inﬂuences and social status should not be disrespected in the adoption
    and

    diffusion IoT smart agriculture process. Both attributes were common denominators

    that ﬂoated to the top of the analysis and were illuminated throughout the study.
    We

    found escalating agriculturalists’ awareness and knowledge of IoT smart agriculture
    as an

    innovation boosted the adoption of the innovation per the adoption cycle, as identiﬁed

    in Ref. [18]. Auxiliary examinations of the distinctive characteristics of opinion
    leaders,

    change agents, and innovators should be performed to assist researchers’ and practitioners’

    comprehension respective to agriculturalists’ social dynamics that foster the
    IoT smart

    agriculture adoption and diffusion process [34].

    It is important to the inquiry’s ﬁeld to develop the capacity of IoT smart agriculture

    adoption rate and the innovation’s traits improving adoption and diffusion. Experimental

    designs and longitudinal studies are necessary to measure potential associations
    between

    characteristics of the innovation, categories of adopters, and an innovation’s
    rate of adop-

    tion. The authors recommend similar investigations for virtual reality, artiﬁcial
    intelligence,

    and additional technology innovations. More robust comprehension of potential
    afﬁliations

    and linkages would enhance researchers’ and practitioners’ knowledge of attributes
    that

    predict IoT smart agriculture, virtual reality, artiﬁcial intelligence, innovation
    systems, and

    other technological innovations’ adoption and stakeholder diffusion.

    5. Conclusions and Future Work

    Agriculturalists’ adoption is predicted by their belief in IoT smart agriculture
    as

    providing a relative advantage, compatible with their existing needs, not challenging
    to use,

    easily testable to examine how to use the innovations, and possessing easily discernible

    beneﬁts. Individuals’ adopter categories within the social system also affect
    adoption and

    diffusion of the IoT innovations. Our data highlighted that opinion leaders’ inﬂuence
    on

    Sensors 2022, 22, 6833

    13 of 15

    the rate of adoption is essential for IoT researchers and practitioners in local
    communities

    to understand. The data supported Rogers’ research that rate of adoption and subsequent

    diffusion is maximized by inclusion communications with opinion leaders and utilizing

    their trust within the community to foster IoT smart agriculture adoption. The
    studies

    by Goldberg and McCrae and Costa Jr. on the ﬁve traits warrant inclusion in future

    IoT smart agriculture adoption inquiries. Globally, we need to better understand
    and

    predict social science decisions and impacts from adopted IoT, virtual reality,
    artiﬁcial

    intelligence, machine learning [43] and in every technical facet of agricultural
    innovation

    systems. Moving the needle forward for Agriculture 4.0 and eventually 5.0 in terms
    of

    innovation adoption and diffusion is essential to understand given global issues
    that

    include climate change, food security, water, sustainability, nutrition, and improving
    the

    lives of marginalized citizens across our world.

    Future plans are to implement randomized control trials with adopters as the treatment

    and non-adopters or resistors of IoT smart agriculture as the control to better
    understand

    resulting individual, community, economic, social, and environmentally sustainable
    im-

    pacts due to innovation adoption. Our expansion of this inquiry is continuing
    in Africa

    and Northern Europe. Tremendous gains have been made in technology development
    and

    technology efﬁciency. However, as our data reported, innovations are only valuable
    to the

    extent that stakeholders choose to use them to advance their goals.

    \ by 2050 than it is today, with the world population rising to more than 9\n\
    billion, 34% higher than it is now. The farmers have been forced to produce more\
    \ with the same resources. This pressure means that\noptimizing productivity is\
    \ one of the main objectives of the producers but also in a sustainable way. Not\
    \ only does agriculture face a\ndecline in production, but it has also had to\
    \ face limitations in data collection, storing, securing, and sharing, climate\
    \ change,\nincreases in input prices, traditional food supply chain systems where\
    \ there is no direct connection between the farmer and the\nbuyer, and limitations\
    \ on energy use. Existing IoT-based agriculture systems have a centralized format\
    \ and operate in isolation,\nleaving room for unresolved issues and major concerns,\
    \ including data security, manipulation, and single failure points. This\npaper\
    \ proposes a futuristic IoT with a blockchain model to meet these challenges.\
    \ Further, this paper also proposes and novel\nenergy-eﬃcient clustering IoT-based\
    \ agriculture protocol for lower energy consumption and network stability and\
    \ compares its\nresults with its counterpart low-energy adoptive clustering hierarchy\
    \ (LEACH) protocol. The simulation results show that the\nproposed protocol network\
    \ stability is 23% higher as compared to LEACH as ﬁrst node of LEACH dies at 168\
    \ rounds while\nIoT-based agriculture ﬁrst node dies after 463 rounds. Similarly,\
    \ IoT-based agriculture protocol energy consumption is 68%\nlower than that of\
    \ LEACH. The proposed protocol also extends the network life to more rounds and\
    \ demonstrates an increase\nof 112%.\n1. Introduction\nThe United Nations Population\
    \ Division expects the world\npopulation, currently 7.8 billion (2020), to reach\
    \ 10.9 billion\nafter the end of the 21st century [1]. Due to rapid population\n\
    growth, there is a high pressure on agriculture to increase\nfood production sustainably.\
    \ Food distribution and con-\nsumption simultaneously promote human well-being\
    \ and\npreserves scarce natural resources. As a result, policymakers,\ndevelopment\
    \ agencies, civil society organizations, and pri-\nvate enterprises have shown\
    \ interest in investigating the role\nof the food and farm markets in supporting\
    \ sustainable\ndevelopment for people and the world [2]. Agriculture is\nexperiencing\
    \ drastic changes and is facing numerous envi-\nronmental and social problems.\
    \ Many farmers are still\ndepending on traditional farming practices and having\
    \ no\ndirect access to the market, and it has proven diﬃcult to bal-\nance the\
    \ demands on limited natural resources such as land\nHindawi\nWireless Communications\
    \ and Mobile Computing\nVolume 2021, Article ID 5580179, 14 pages\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2021/5580179\n\
    and water. Both changes in diets and consumer preferences\nand the fact of climate\
    \ change contribute to the complexity\nof providing high-quality food to the end-user.\
    \ Sustainable\nfood and agricultural production cannot be accomplished\nby the\
    \ conventional agriculture systems that have led to sub-\nstantial deforestation,\
    \ water scarcity, or soil erosion. Thus,\nadvanced systems must be used which\
    \ conserve and rein-\nforce the basis of natural resources and increase production.\n\
    A phase of transition to “holistic” methods is like smart agri-\nculture [3].\
    \ Smart agriculture is an approach that guides\nagricultural ﬁeld supervision\
    \ in the era of climate change.\nThe idea of smart agriculture was ﬁrst introduced\
    \ in 2009\nand revived through the involvement and input of many\nstakeholders\
    \ involved in design and implementation. In\nresponse to the debate on agricultural\
    \ policy on climate\nchange and sustainable development work, the main features\n\
    of the smart agriculture approach have been developed. [4].\nSmart agriculture\
    \ aims to provide universally applicable sys-\ntems for climate change management\
    \ and agricultural food\nsecurity. Smart agriculture uses advanced technologies\
    \ such\nas the Internet of Things (IoT), big data, and cloud comput-\ning to monitor\
    \ the ﬁeld environment, analyze crop growth,\nand provide information to the farmer\
    \ for decision-\nmaking. An information-based management cycle for smart\nagriculture\
    \ is presented in Figure 1. [5].\n1.1. Internet of Things (IoT). The Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) is a\ncutting-edge computing and networking technology that\n\
    reﬂects the future. Smart computing will be focused on the\nInternet of Things\
    \ in the future. IoT is now playing a signif-\nicant role in the transformation\
    \ of existing technologies from\nthe home to the workplace [6]. IoT technology\
    \ is used to link\ncomputers or nodes to networks for the sharing of informa-\n\
    tion and communication [7]. The Internet of Things (IoT)\nhas the potential to\
    \ link billions of devices (smart objects).\nThese smart objects can gather data\
    \ and interact with other\nsystems over the internet. IoT has evolved into a next\
    \ gener-\nation technology with several agricultural applications [8].\n1.2. Internet\
    \ of Things in Smart Agriculture. In the ﬁeld of\nsmart agriculture IoT provides\
    \ a wide range of applications\nsuch as soil and plant tracking, crop growth observation,\n\
    and selection, assistance for irrigation assessment, and mon-\nitoring of the\
    \ agriculture environment. In smart agriculture\nInternet of Things (IoT) technology\
    \ is applied in diagnostics\nand control. To optimize agriculture, the implementation\
    \ of\nIoT in the ﬁeld has increased the productivity and eﬀective-\nness of farmers.\
    \ It may help to determine ﬁeld variables such\nas soil quality and plant biomass.\
    \ It can also be used to test\nand monitor variables including temperature, soil\
    \ moisture,\nand crop diseases. Besides, IoT can be used to track crop\ngrowth\
    \ and yield inﬂuencing factors. Farmers can also ﬁgure\nout which crops are most\
    \ suited for which conditions and can\nrotate crop accordingly [9]. IoT applications\
    \ support farmers\nduring crop planting, irrigation, crop processing, harvesting\n\
    and postharvest, crop storage and transportation, and many\nother beneﬁts in agricultural\
    \ IoT systems. Soil moisture sen-\nsors, humidity sensors, leaf moisture sensors,\
    \ solar radiation\nsensors, infrared light sensors, and rainfall predictors are\n\
    among the ﬁeld sensors used in IoT-based systems. In IoT\nscenarios, sensors can\
    \ be installed in a variety of locations,\nincluding greenhouses, seed banks,\
    \ cold rooms, agricultural\nmachinery, transportation systems, and livestock,\
    \ and the\ndata collected can be processed in the cloud for monitoring\nand control\
    \ [10].\n1.3. Food Supply Chain Management. Food supply chain\nmanagement is a\
    \ process that explains how food from an\nagricultural ﬁeld ends up on our tables.\
    \ Supply chain man-\nagement deals with production, reﬁning, delivery, selling\n\
    consumption, and disposal [11]. The process of the supply\nchain is summarized\
    \ in Figure 2. In developing countries,\nthe food supply chain faces several challenges,\
    \ such as the\nneed for conﬁdence among stakeholders which often corre-\nlated\
    \ with their credibility and traceability required by the\nend-users, and the\
    \ diﬃculty of managing risks, delays, or\ndisruptions is often occurred due to\
    \ insuﬃcient or lacking\ninformation [12]. Blockchain technology is one of the\
    \ best\nways to meet these challenges [13].\n1.4. Blockchain Technology. Blockchain\
    \ is a distributed data-\nbase where data can be recorded and shared via a decentra-\n\
    lized computing network while also providing security and\nprivacy. And if the\
    \ data is spread, only the owner who has\nthe private key can make transactions.\
    \ The other machines\nor computers on the network serve as validators. It safely\n\
    records transactions between nodes in a public ledger with-\nout the need for\
    \ a trusted third party [14]. In a centralized\ncloud approach where an asset\
    \ or object is owned, it is either\nheld under the control of the owner or through\
    \ a trusted\nintermediary or a centralized authority such as a bank. A cen-\n\
    tralized computing system always has a single server for sev-\neral clients, the\
    \ server has higher resources than its client\nsystems, and all processes are\
    \ made through a single server\nwhich now has become a traditional approach [15].\
    \ Block-\nchain records transactions in block units, and every block\nincludes\
    \ the hash of the block history, hash of the current\nblock, date, other details,\
    \ and transactions for the block.\nWhen a sender node makes a transaction, it\
    \ distributes it to\nthe other nodes on the network. The receiving nodes verify\n\
    the transaction and have proof of work. The node that suc-\nceeds in the proof\
    \ of work will broadcast it to all the other\nnodes and connect the block to the\
    \ chain. The transaction\nshall contain the public key of the recipient and shall\
    \ be\nsigned by the sender. Therefore, any other node will verify\nthe validity\
    \ of the transaction. Each block includes a hash\nof the previous block, which\
    \ means that each block is\nconnected to each other [16]. The key characteristics\
    \ of\nblockchain are shown in Figure 3 [17].\nBecause of its unique characteristics,\
    \ blockchain may be\nan evolutionary next step in the food supply chain also to\n\
    add accountability to the supply chain system by exchanging\naccurate data between\
    \ supply chain stakeholders. After the\nintegration of IoT with blockchain, the\
    \ overall visibility of\nfood products across the supply chain will become a reality.\n\
    The major advantages of blockchain and IoT in the food sup-\nply chain are real-time\
    \ monitoring and sensing of original\nfood items from the origin which identify\
    \ major bottlenecks.\n2\nWireless Communications and Mobile Computing\nAs in the\
    \ agricultural sector, farmers use chemical fertilizers,\ninsecticides, and other\
    \ materials to increase crop production,\nespecially vegetable growers often use\
    \ harmful pesticides to\nspray vegetables to improve their proﬁtability, and con-\n\
    sumers buy the same vegetables to eat which is a major health\nhazard. Secondly,\
    \ food frauds and data alternation are also\nbig challenges for supply chain stakeholders.\n\
    1.5. Blockchain in Food Supply Chain. Blockchain is an\nemerging technology for\
    \ the agriculture sector, applying\nblockchain to the agricultural supply chain\
    \ provides a digital\ndatabase that monitors, tracks records, and processes digital\n\
    and physical resources. Blockchain allows greater traceabil-\nity and higher quality\
    \ transactions. This technology can\nmanage and integrate all procedures and dealings\
    \ in real-\ntime across the agricultural supply chain. Every transaction\ntreated\
    \ in a distributed manner may contain product-\nspeciﬁc attributes and transactions\
    \ that will be added by\nplayers in the supply chain. The supply chain players\
    \ can\nrecognize and investigate the association of products along\nwith all stages\
    \ of the supply chain and zoological technology\npractices (fertilizers, feed,\
    \ and veterinary services [18]. The\nblockchain stores invariant records that\
    \ are transparent\nand digitally accessible to all users in the supply chain;\
    \ this\ntechnology has the potential to produce massive eﬃciency\ngains for each\
    \ actor. The blockchain oﬀers a forum for\ntraceability in the agricultural supply\
    \ chain, allowing end-\nusers to monitor product from origins and ensure their\n\
    authenticity. Figure 4 illustrates the beneﬁts of using block-\nchain in the food\
    \ supply chain. The ability to monitor a\nSensors\nSofware\nAI\nImplements\nFigure\

    \ for infringe-\nment on the product’s authenticity, making regulation easier\n\
    to regulate. The blockchain keeps the mechanism and the\ndata connected at all\
    \ times [19].\n1.6. IoT Integration with the Blockchain. Industry 4.0 has\nshown\
    \ that the Internet of Things is a fundamental technol-\nogy and a key player\
    \ in the digital revolution. In diﬀerent net-\nwork topologies, IoT is expected\
    \ to depend more on sensing\ndevices, a wide range of data, and more connected\
    \ devices. As\na result, it must be referred to as the Internet of Things 2.0.\n\
    The Internet of Things 2.0 is now transitioning away from\nsensors and data technology\
    \ and toward actionable intelli-\ngence technology [20]. IoT becomes more eﬃcient\
    \ when it\nis combined with cloud computing, artiﬁcial intelligence,\nand machine\
    \ learning [21]. Integration of blockchain tech-\nnology with IoT is another signiﬁcant\
    \ contribution to the\ndigital transformation of various domains. By integrating\n\
    with IoT, blockchain is projected to add $176 billion to the\nglobal economy by\
    \ 2025 and $3 trillion by 2030 [22].\nFigure 5 depicts the most important blockchain\

    \ Advantages of Blockchain Technology in Food Supply Chain.\n4\nWireless Communications\
    \ and Mobile Computing\nIn the present world, the problem of health and food\n\
    safety is deteriorating day by day because a proper food trace-\nability system\
    \ is not available. The biggest reason for food-\nborne disease is contamination\
    \ which is hard to track in the\nconventional food supply chain because the mechanism\
    \ is\nnot visible [23]. However, IoT with a blockchain system will\nﬁx the problem\
    \ by creating a distributed system and elimi-\nnating the third party participating\
    \ in the system at the same\ntime. Consumers have questions about the nature of\
    \ the food\nproducts they purchase and the sources of the product they\nbuy in\
    \ the conventional supply chain. The key point here is\nto create customer interest,\
    \ which is diﬃcult to do as the sys-\ntem is not open. By building customer conﬁdence,\
    \ IoT and\nblockchain technology could eradicate these issues. Each\nproduct has\
    \ a digital identity in this framework, which stores\ninformation from the point\
    \ of origin up to the end of the\nretailer [24]. IoT with blockchain can provide\
    \ a more\ntransparent and connected system.\n1.7. Communication Protocols. Communication\
    \ protocols\nhave been commonly used in various types of networks to\nimprove\
    \ communication eﬃciency. The LoRaWAN protocol\nwas created to migrate data from\
    \ sensor nodes and the IoT\nnetwork platform that introduced the LoRaWAN backend\n\
    service to the cloud for data sharing. In terms of integrating\nwith other IoT\
    \ systems and introducing new services, the\nplanned framework was scalable and\
    \ versatile. It is also hor-\nizontally scalable, which means it can improve eﬃciency\
    \ by\nreplicating new server occurrences [25]. Heizelmann created\nthe low-energy\
    \ adaptive wireless sensor network routing\nLEACH protocol, which was the ﬁrst\
    \ hierarchical cluster-\nbased routing protocol for a wireless sensor network.\
    \ The\nprotocol nodes had been distributed across clusters, and each\ncluster\
    \ had its head (CH). Member nodes of cluster sensory\ndata share them via their\
    \ selected CHs with the base station.\nSmart agriculture has been able to ensure\
    \ that it not only\nmeets the general needs of crops but also anticipates their\n\
    speciﬁc needs, taking into account a variety of environmental\nfactors. The challenge\
    \ is to accurately predict potential crop\nlosses to take appropriate measures.\
    \ IoT nodes enable eﬃ-\ncient routing protocols to obtain data and share information\n\
    with farmers [26].\n2. Literature Review\nThis section provides a thorough review\
    \ of the related\nliterature.\n2.1. Review on IoT in Smart Agriculture. In paper\
    \ [26], the\nauthors proposed a smart agriculture system to provide\ninformation\
    \ on soil, water supply, and the general state of\nthe ﬁeld to farmers. The objective\
    \ of the proposed system\nwas to make agriculture and irrigation more eﬃcient\
    \ and to\nmake it easier for farmers to take appropriate decisions to\nincrease\
    \ agricultural production. The use of IoT networks\nto monitor environmental factors\
    \ and the combination of\nthis information with a user-speciﬁc web service enables\n\
    farmers to make eﬀective use of their knowledge to obtain\nthe best results from\
    \ their agriculture. In paper [27],\nresearchers have developed an IoT-based agriculture\
    \ data\nanalysis system using IoT devices such as environmental ﬁeld\nreal-time\
    \ monitoring sensors. The ﬁeld observation was col-\nlected and transferred to\
    \ the farmers through a web-based\napplication with the help of a node and a Wi-Fi\
    \ module.\nThe system consists of sensors such as a soil moisture sensor\nand\
    \ an ultrasonic sensor. The system has a low cost but uses\nhigh energy. The authors\
    \ of the paper [28] used IoT to build a\nsmart agriculture system for Indian farmers.\
    \ Farmers in India\nhave begun to commit suicide as a result of low agricultural\n\
    output. To address this problem, an IoT-based smart agricul-\nture system was\
    \ created that uses a variety of sensors to mon-\nitor pests and soil moisture.\
    \ Crop distribution companies\nwere also involved in providing high-quality seeds\
    \ to farmers\nto boost yields. The system architecture, on the other hand, is\n\
    extremely durable, but it comes at a high price.\nResearchers explored the potential\
    \ beneﬁts of using smart\nagriculture technologies such as smart soil and air\
    \ sensors in\npaper [29], to assist farmers by covering the initial installa-\n\
    tion costs and providing smart farming advice through the\nintegrated use of heterogeneous\
    \ information sources. The\nwork helped farmers in growing their ecological footprint\n\
    by providing opportunities for innovation targeting and cli-\nmate change adaptation\
    \ options. The authors of the paper\n[30] used sophisticated Internet of Thing\
    \ (IoT) agricultural\napplications to make accurate measurements, using sensor\n\
    data from 60 scientiﬁc papers published between 2016 and\n2018. Previous research\
    \ has shown the importance of smart\nagriculture in water, grain, livestock, and\
    \ irrigation manage-\nment. When it came to sensor data collection, the best results\n\
    were obtained when calculating temperature and humidity.\nSensors for soil moisture\
    \ and soil reaction are also available.\n2.2. Review on Blockchain in the Supply\
    \ Chain. Researchers in\nthe paper [31] proposed a theoretical model to investigate\
    \ the\nimpact of blockchain on operational supply chain transpar-\nency and collaboration\
    \ by establishing rapid trust between\nkey partners involved in disaster relief\
    \ supply chains. Collabo-\nration enables stakeholders to work together, leads\
    \ to produc-\ntive and eﬃcient real-time information exchange between\npartners,\
    \ and provides many beneﬁts such as increased trans-\nparency, ﬂexibility, and\
    \ reduced lead–time, as well as helping\nto improve supply chain resilience. The\
    \ authors of the paper\nGovernment\ncurrency \nDigital energy and\nsmart grids\n\
    World trade and\nsupply chain\nSelf-sovereign\ndigital identify \nBlockchain and\
    \ IoT\nprediction by 2030\nToken-based digital\neconomy \nFigure 5: Blockchain\
    \ and IoT prediction by 2030.\n5\nWireless Communications and Mobile Computing\n\
    [32] suggested blockchain adoption as a way to improve the\nentire supply chain,\
    \ from safe, accurate, and open transactions\nto increasing supply chain participants’\
    \ trust and eﬃciency by\nexchanging all transactions and related information across\
    \ the\nentire network. The authors of [14] focused on weakening\nsupply chain\
    \ resilience in the era of information asymmetry,\nwhich occurs when one of the\
    \ supply chain’s members has sig-\nniﬁcantly more product information than the\
    \ others. They\nadmitted that data inaccuracies or discrepancies might lead\n\
    to incorrect decisions and an increase in technological risks\nincluding cybercrime,\
    \ hacking, and theft, both of which\ncould harm the company’s credibility. One\
    \ of these solutions,\naccording to the writers, is establishing “conﬁdence” among\n\
    supply chain participants using a decentralized information\nsharing framework\
    \ based on blockchain technology.\n2.3. Motivation. In terms of technology, although\
    \ the litera-\nture in smart agriculture using IoT is very rich, there is still\n\
    a gap for improvement, whereas the use of blockchain tech-\nnology in the food\
    \ supply system literature is very limited.\nBesides, no solid research papers\
    \ are published yet using a\ncombination of IoT and blockchain technology for\
    \ agricul-\nture and food supply systems for addressing the information\nreliability\
    \ issues. Most of the solutions are ad hoc-based or\nwork separately. Limitations\
    \ in the existing literature moti-\nvated us to develop a futuristic smart model\
    \ based on smart\ntechnologies to meet the requirements of all stakeholders\n\
    involved in agriculture and food supply chain by using IoT\nwith blockchain technology\
    \ through which traceability man-\nagement can be applied through the food supply\
    \ chain and\naddresses the main centralized format challenge that is\nasymmetric,\
    \ opaque, and monopolistic. These limitations\nhave driven us to build a distributed,\
    \ eﬃcient, and safe sys-\ntem to enhance crop production, ensure the end-to-end\n\
    traceability of food products, and stop food fraud in the sup-\nply chain. The\
    \ goal would be to develop a distributed and\nautomatic agriculture food supply\
    \ chain traceability model\nthat enables various quality levels to be implemented\
    \ based\non consumer needs. The model that not only uses transac-\ntion data but\
    \ also smart contract and enables end-to-end\ntraceability and data security.\n\
    3. Materials and Methods\nThis section presents the smart model architecture and\
    \ smart\nmodel protocol design.\n3.1. Smart Model Architecture. As shown in Figure\
    \ 6, a futur-\nistic smart model for agricultural environmental monitoring\nand\
    \ food supply chain consists of three layers: physical data\nlayer, logical data\
    \ layer, and web interface layer. This type\nof layered approach allows for scalable,\
    \ extendable, and eﬃ-\ncient framework implementation. In the physical data layer,\n\
    a variety of IoT nodes are used to track the farm environment\nand crop growth.\
    \ IoT nodes collect data from the cluster farm\nand send it to the base station\
    \ via IoT gateway and wireless\nrouter, which then sends it to the database. A\
    \ GPRS router\nis integrated into a single central board device that serves as\n\
    a remote Radio Frequency Gateway (RFG) for wireless telem-\netry. To achieve eﬀective\
    \ control management and synchro-\nnization of two relatively unrelated data sources,\
    \ data\ncollection through IoT nodes for soil parameters and IoT\ncrop monitoring\
    \ information, the RFG gateway acts as a\ncoordinator between two separate data\
    \ streams and supports\nremote access, allowing for complete remote control of\n\
    devices in the cluster farm. The logical data layer in an SQL\ndatabase server\
    \ stores the data obtained from the cluster\nfarm. The SQL server, as a more intermediate\
    \ layer, covers\nthe complexity of multiple physical layer devices and allows\n\
    database server data validation. Raw data is stored in the\nSQL database, which\
    \ is then extracted to a local ﬁle system.\nEnergy is the core part of every network,\
    \ and energy con-\nservation is one of the key objectives of this research. To\n\
    reduce energy consumption, this research proposed an IoT-\nbased agriculture protocol\
    \ that can be divided into three\nphases: IoT nodes, IoT cluster head, and sink.\
    \ IoT nodes\ngathered data and transferred it to CH in the ﬁrst phase,\nCH broadcasted\
    \ information to sink in the second phase,\nand sink transferred data to the base\
    \ station in the third\nphase. This research work implements an RFG server using\n\
    a robust ultra-low-power Single Board Chip to seamlessly\ncombine a variety of\
    \ devices in the cluster farm (SBC TS-\n7260). The monitoring system switches\
    \ between active and\nsleep mode automatically. The optional battery backup mod-\n\
    ule supports the SBC sleep mode, which also operates with a\nbuilt-in uninterrupted\
    \ power supply (UPS). Diﬀerent devices\nin the cluster farm are normally equipped\
    \ with an RS232\nserial port. Wireless routers are switched oﬀ during the sys-\n\
    tem’s sleep cycle to conserve electricity. SQL server obtains\ndata by either\
    \ pull or pushes operations. In a pull method,\nSQL server connects to the data\
    \ source regularly and extracts\nthe data. In a push operation, this server opens\
    \ a port\nthrough which data can be passed through the data source.\nThis design\
    \ allows the server to adapt to diﬀerent data source\ntypes with ease. The data\
    \ was sent to the SQL server. The data\nmanager may also require the RFG server\
    \ to recollect data\nand retransfer data packets that were omitted. For each new\n\
    data source, a new data manager is included with limited\nmodiﬁcations to the\
    \ database and web visualization layers,\nimproving extensibility. Speciﬁc IoT\
    \ identiﬁcation codes link\nthe nodes and observations. As a consequence, once\
    \ they are\nlinked to the database, the web application layer will recog-\nnize\
    \ them right away. This design allows for ﬂexible model\ndevelopment and web interface\
    \ design. It also allows for data\nconversion to IoT networks, allowing for data\
    \ sharing and\ninteroperability between IoT devices through web services.\n3.2.\
    \ BlockChain Integration with IoT in the Smart Model.\nExclusive blockchain characteristics\
    \ will combine agricul-\ntural and food supply chain processes into a single smart\
    \ sys-\ntem to ensure that consumers receive healthy food. Figure 7\nshows a functional\
    \ overview of the blockchain.\nThe role of stakeholders in the overall system\
    \ is also\ndiscussed. The research used blockchain smart contracts to\nexchange\
    \ data between mining nodes in the system. All busi-\nness transactions are recorded\
    \ in the shared ledger by min-\ning nodes, and smart contracts receive all transactions\
    \ in\nthe blockchain in the form of function calls and generate\n6\nWireless Communications\
    \ and Mobile Computing\nactivities, as well as providing access to parties involved\
    \ in\nthe transaction to exchange control track and receive alerts\nin the event\
    \ of a violation. Finally, smart contracts help to\nmaintain the best conditions\
    \ and respond to food supply\nchain misappropriations.\n3.2.1. Seed Seller. Seed\
    \ sellers, also known as seed vendors,\norganize and produce a wide range of seeds\
    \ before selling\nthem to farmers. They are obligated to sell high-quality seeds\n\
    to growers to produce a high-quality crop. The seed seller\nuses blockchain to\
    \ store information about seed germination\nand chemical composition, which all\
    \ stakeholders can access\nand share. Seeds are stamped with a unique number,\
    \ similar\nto serialized Global Trade Identiﬁcation Numbers, that\nallows all\
    \ parties to be electronically identiﬁed and track\nproducts in the seed trade.\n\
    3.2.2. Farmer. A farmer is someone who buys high-quality\nseeds and plants them.\
    \ The farmer is responsible for record-\ning information about fertilizers use\
    \ and plant growth data in\nthe form of MPEG ﬁles in the IPFS, where diﬀerent\
    \ nodes\nkeep the data with high reliability throughout the entire pro-\ncess\
    \ from planting to harvesting. Farmers can also use block-\nchain to communicate\
    \ with crop buyers and sell their crops\nwithout relying on middlemen, who often\
    \ get proﬁt by medi-\nating between sellers and buyers.\n3.2.3. Crop Buyer. Crop\
    \ buyer is a company that buys crop or\na grain from a farmer and sells it to\
    \ a processor.\n3.2.4. Processor. The processor buys grain that does a mois-\n\
    ture analysis to convert the raw grain to the ﬁnal product.\nThe processor is\
    \ responsible for all operations in the block-\nchain where other players in the\
    \ supply chain have access\nto this information.\n3.2.5. Crop Storage. The storing\
    \ of crops or grains is an\nimportant and unavoidable part of the crop production\
    \ pro-\ncess and supply chain process. In warehouse, grains or crops\nare stored,\
    \ and information is recorded in the blockchain\nwhere supply chain stakeholders\
    \ can view and exchange this\ninformation.\nBlock chain \nsmart contracts\nFarmer\n\

    \ Computing\n3.2.6. Distributor. Distributors have a business arrangement\nwith\
    \ the suppliers or producers. Many distributors maintain\nexclusive purchasing\
    \ agreements which limit or allow distrib-\nutors to cover a certain area through\
    \ the number of partici-\npants. The distributor is the producer’s exclusive point\
    \ of\ncontact with prospective purchasers of those products. Dis-\ntributors,\
    \ though, seldom sell the goods of the manufacturer\ndirectly to the retailer.\
    \ Distributors tend to work with whole-\nsale agents who may buy large quantities\
    \ of one commodity\nregardless of the very large quantity of one commodity they\n\
    have on hand or can purchase from the manufacturer. The\ndistributor is responsible\
    \ for registering all food product\ninformation in the blockchain.\n3.2.7. Retailer.\
    \ Retailers are proﬁt-making companies that\ndirectly sell products to consumers.\
    \ Retailers search for prod-\nucts that suit their market objectives and ﬁnd vendors\
    \ at the\nmost advantageous prices to make a proﬁt. Generally, small\nquantities\
    \ of an item can be ordered from a distributor by a\nretailer. In this setup,\
    \ the retailer orders goods in batches of\ntraceable identiﬁers which make it\
    \ easy for the customer to\nverify product life cycle records.\n3.2.8. Customer.\
    \ The customer is the ﬁnal user of the food\nproduct who purchases the food product\
    \ from the retailer.\nThis research smart model provides full access to the cus-\n\
    tomer to trace production information from the origin to\nthe sale point. In this\
    \ setup, all supply chain stakeholders\nare bound to digitally sign blockchain\
    \ smart contracts and\nto record information fairly and in case of dishonest block-\n\
    chain automatically conﬁgure the incident into smart con-\ntracts to ﬁne the concerned\
    \ party. Another option is to\ninstall cameras in the ﬁeld to automatically capture\
    \ and\ntransfer images to the blockchain for preaudit. The advantage\nof using\
    \ product traceability technology in the food supply\nchain is the availability\
    \ of reliable and real-time information\nto all stakeholders.\n3.3. IoT-Based\
    \ Agriculture Protocol for the Smart Model. IoT\nnodes are ideal for cluster farms\
    \ because they consume less\nenergy than WSN and can be further reduced through\
    \ an eﬃ-\ncient clustering protocol. Therefore, this research proposed a\nnew\
    \ clustering protocol IoT-based agriculture, as shown in\nFigure 8, based on the\
    \ LEACH protocol, to reduce energy\nconsumption and extend network life.\n3.3.1.\
    \ Assumption for Simulation. Assumptions for simula-\ntion are given below.\n\
    (i) IoT nodes are installed on a cluster farm randomly\n(ii) IoT nodes send hello\
    \ messages to the base station\nwith local information\n(iii) The initial number\
    \ of clusters is calculated by taking\nthe optimal values to vary with the node\
    \ density\nbefore the node starts to expire, and the smaller clus-\nters become\
    \ larger clusters\n(iv) The base station and sink are installed outside the\n\
    cluster farm as presented in Figure 9\n3.3.2. Initialization Phase. A cluster\
    \ farm with a total area of\n500 × 500 m2 was chosen and distributed into clusters,\
    \ with\n100 IoT nodes placed in each cluster at random. The IoT\nnodes were chosen\
    \ based on their capabilities, such as soil\nmoisture monitoring, temperature\
    \ monitoring, and crop dis-\nease tracking. Nodes in clusters are distributed\
    \ in such a way\nthat one cluster node does not communicate with other clus-\n\
    ter nodes, but only with the cluster heads of their respective\nclusters. Each\
    \ cluster’s CH is in charge of sharing sensed data\nwith the BS via the sink node.\
    \ To achieve a satisfactory SNR,\na widely used LEACH “First Order Radio Model”\
    \ is used to\ntransmit a small message over a distance of d.\n3.3.3. LEACH First\
    \ Order Radio Model. As shown in\nFigure 10 and Table 1, the ﬁrst order radio\
    \ model dissipates\nEelec = 50 nJ/bit to run the transmitter or receiver circuit\
    \ sys-\ntem and Eamp = 100 pJ/bit/m2 for the transmit ampliﬁer to\nachieve a satisfactory\
    \ signal-to-noise ratio. These parameters\nare slightly better than the existing\
    \ radio system second\nassumption that was an energy loss due to channel transmis-\n\
    sion. To transmit an m-bit message over a distance of d using\na radio model,\
    \ the radio dissipates as follows:\nETx m, d\nð\nÞ = ETx−elec m\nð Þ + ETx−amp\
    \ m, d\nð\nÞ,\nð1Þ\nETx m, d\nð\nÞ = Eelec × m + ∈amp × m × d2,\nð2Þ\nand to get\
    \ this message, the radio expands\nERx m\nð Þ = Eelec × m:\nð3Þ\nWith those parameters,\
    \ transferring or receiving a packet\nis not a low-cost method; so, protocols\
    \ must strive to reduce\nnot only transmission distances but also the number of\
    \ trans-\nmission and receiving operations per message.\n3.3.4. Clustering Mechanism.\
    \ IoT nodes are divided into\ngroups in a cluster farm, and these groups are known\
    \ as clus-\nters; each cluster is represented by G and has a head node.\nEach\
    \ cluster’s nodes sense data and send it to a single head\nnode; they do not communicate\
    \ with other head nodes.\nCluster\nCluster member\nBase station\nSink\nDatabase\n\
    Sink\nCluster head\nFigure 8: IoT-based agriculture clustering protocol.\n8\n\
    Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing\n(1) Cluster Head (CH) Selection.\
    \ The CH is responsible for\ncollecting data from member nodes and transmitting\
    \ aggre-\ngated data to the base station, it requires a lot of energy to\ndo so,\
    \ and the transmission process must be boosted with\nhigh power ampliﬁcation.\
    \ Two parameters are considered\nin the CH selection process: the history of nodes\
    \ acting as\nCH and the optimal percentage of a node. The generation\nof a random\
    \ number is used to make each node decision\n(between 0 and 1). The node will\
    \ be selected as CH if the gen-\nerated random number is threshold (Tn) for that\
    \ round.\nThe following formula is used to calculate the thresh-\nold (Tn):\n\
    T n\nð Þ =\nP\n1 − Px r mod 1/P\nð\nÞ\nð\nÞ\nn ∈ G\n0\notherwise\n:\n8\n>\n<\n\
    >\n:\nð4Þ\nIn equation (4), p represents the percentage of CH, r\nrepresents the\
    \ number of rounds, and G represents the\nset of nodes that were not selected\
    \ as CH in the previous\n1/p rounds. Every node in the cluster has a 1/p chance\
    \ of\nbeing a CH in each round in this situation. When a node\nis chosen as CH,\
    \ it sends an advertisement message to its\nnearby nodes, inviting them to be\
    \ CH. The advertisement\nmessage is accepted by the member nodes, and they enter\n\
    the CH.\n(2) Data Transmission. Following CH selection, the data\ntransmission\
    \ schedule kicks oﬀ, with member nodes sending\ndata to their assigned CH during\
    \ their designated transmis-\nsion time. Low-energy transmission was required\
    \ for this\ntype of transmission. Before transmission time is allocated,\nthe\
    \ member node can be turned oﬀ to save energy. The CH\nmust keep the receiver\
    \ to receive the full data and then com-\nbine all of the data into a single signal\
    \ before transmitting it\nto the base station via a sink node.\n(3) Routing Phase.\
    \ The way to pick a traﬃc route in a net-\nwork is routing. The IoT agricultural\
    \ network is comprised\nof numerous modes of communication and protocols in\n\
    the long and short range, which form the backbone for these\nnetworks to gather\
    \ information and exchange this data with\nthe farmers for review and decision-making.\
    \ The IoT-based\nagriculture protocol has three levels of data routing in the\n\
    ﬁrst stage member node sense data and transfer it to their\nCHs, while in the\
    \ second stage, the CHs accumulate and\ntransfer data to the nearest sink, and\
    \ in the third and last\nstage, sink sends this data into the base station. In\
    \ such data\ncommunication, the function of the sink minimizes CH’s\nenergy consumption\
    \ and reduces packet losses, especially\nfor long haul communication. Figure 8\
    \ demonstrates the full\ndata routing method.\n(4) Setup Phase. For the ﬁrst round,\
    \ CHs are generated using\nthe standard LEACH algorithm, and the cluster heads\
    \ are\nchosen using equation (4). After transferring data, each node\nin the network\
    \ consumes a speciﬁc amount of energy, and\neach node has consumed a diﬀerent\
    \ amount of energy. The\ndistance between the sending and receiving nodes, denoted\n\

    \ and nodes\nare informed of its location. In the ﬁrst round, nodes report\ntheir\
    \ location to the sink based on their signal strength.\nThose nodes that were\
    \ chosen as grid heads (GH) begin per-\nforming their GH role and cease their\
    \ previous role of data\nsensing during this process. Cluster heads are chosen\
    \ as\nnodes with a high residual energy and a short Euclidean dis-\ntance to sink\

    〠\nr=max\nr=1\nWEconsumed rð Þ⩝rЄR:\nð9Þ\nWEconsumed is calculated using equation\
    \ by (6).\nIn the above equation, WEconsumed is the amount of\nenergy consumed\
    \ in each round, and do denotes the distance\nbetween two nodes. The consumption\
    \ of energy is assumed\nas ETX and ERX, and their parameters can be determined\n\
    by using (2) and (3). To meet the objective mentioned in\n(5), this research divides\
    \ the total node energy into diﬀerent\nequivalent parts and presented as “EL”\
    \ and can be calculated\nfrom (7)\nEL = Eo\nTL :\nð10Þ\nIn the equation (10),\
    \ EL stands for energy level, Eo\nstands for initial static node, and TL stands\
    \ for total energy,\nwhich is dependent on the amount of energy consumed by\n\
    each node as well as network density and packet size. The\nrelationship between\
    \ EL and TL is inverse. When the TL\nvalue is low, the EL value is high. The node\
    \ in the cluster\nfarm performs the role of CH until the values of EL do\nnot\
    \ reduce the residual energy, at which point, a termina-\ntion of CH selection\
    \ message is sent to all nodes, and a\nnew process for CH selection begins. Only\
    \ those nodes that\nare supposed to transfer data remain active in this mecha-\n\
    nism to reduce energy consumption. When member nodes\nﬁnish their data sensing\
    \ process, CH begins to collect data\nfrom all member nodes, aggregate the data\
    \ to remove any\nduplication, combine data into a single signal to save band-\n\
    width, and transmit data in a single hop to the sink, where it\nis then transferred\
    \ to the base station. The ﬂowchart is\nshown in Figure 11, and the algorithm\
    \ for the entire process\nis shown below.\n4. Simulation Results and Discussion\n\
    To test the eﬃciency of our proposed IoT-based agriculture\nprotocol, the MATLAB\
    \ simulation is compared with the cur-\nrent LEACH protocol. IoT nodes were installed\
    \ randomly in\neach simulated technique in the simulation of 5000 rounds.\nIn\
    \ the farm of 500 × 500m2, all active IoT nodes transfer data\nto their respective\
    \ cluster heads, and cluster heads transfer\ndata to the base station via sink\
    \ node. The simulation results\nare presented below.\n4.1. Network Stability Period.\
    \ The time it takes for the ﬁrst\nnode to die is known as the network stability\
    \ period.\nFigure 12 depicts the LEACH network stability period and\nthe proposed\
    \ IoT-based agriculture protocol. LEACH has a\nshorter stability period than the\
    \ proposed protocol. The rea-\nson for the improvement is that data is only transferred\
    \ in the\nproposed protocol when there is a diﬀerence between previ-\nously taken\
    \ data and current data. The results show that the\nLEACH ﬁrst node dies after\
    \ 168 rounds, while the proposed\nprotocol ﬁrst node dies after 463 rounds, indicating\
    \ that the\nIoT-based agriculture protocol is 23% more eﬃcient in terms\nof network\
    \ stability.\n4.2. Energy Consumption. The energy consumed by the nodes\nduring\
    \ data transmission is referred to as energy consump-\ntion. Figure 13 shows the\
    \ simulation results for both proto-\ncols. The energy consumption of the nodes\
    \ in the IoT-\nbased agriculture protocol is 68 percent lower than that of\nLEACH,\
    \ which can extend network life.\n4.3. Network Life. The network’s life is determined\
    \ by the\ntime it takes to ﬁnish the energy at the ﬁrst node. Figure 14\n0\n0\n\

    \ same\namount of energy for each round, resulting in unsuccessful\nCH selection\
    \ and a reduction in network life, whereas the\nIoT-based protocol selects CHs\
    \ based on the residual energy\nof the nodes and the optimal number of clusters,\
    \ resulting in\na 112 percent increase in network life.\n5. Conclusions\nThe use\
    \ of blockchain in the food supply chain has yielded\nvarious beneﬁts, including\
    \ the potential to expand and step\ntowards the distributed network, as well as\
    \ the ability to build\na trustless environment for all processes. Despite the\
    \ trustless\nexistence of blockchain, it is diﬃcult to completely establish\n\
    trust between the agricultural product seller and buyer. Cur-\nrent blockchain-based\
    \ food supply chain systems focus solely\non the supply chain, with no choice\
    \ to track food products\nback to their source to ensure product quality, while\
    \ existing\nIoT-based agriculture systems are often isolated, with roles\nrestricted\n\
    to\nagriculture\nenvironment\nmonitoring\nand\nfarmers unable to directly communicate\
    \ with market buyers.\nIn this paper, we have provided complete solution for agri-\n\
    culture and food supply chain by integrating IoT with the\nblockchain. In addition,\
    \ we have developed an energy eﬃ-\ncient routing protocol for the proposed system\
    \ to extend sys-\ntem life by reducing energy consumption. A novel approach\n\
    has been applied in this research and developed a futuristic\nsmart model for\
    \ agriculture and the food supply chain, which\noﬀers an innovative way for farmers\
    \ to acquire information\non crops. IoT can provide farmers with information on\
    \ crop\nyields, soil temperature, pest infestation, and soil quality that\nis\
    \ essential for high crop production and provides precise\ndata that can be used\
    \ to improve farming techniques. Crop\n0\n0\n500\n1000\n1500\n2000\n2500\nRounds\n\

    \ change and food security are critical topics in sustainable agricultural development.\n\
    The climate-smart agriculture initiative proposed by the Food and Agriculture\
    \ Organization of the\nUnited Nations has attracted international attention. Smart\
    \ agriculture (SA) has since been recognized\nas an inﬂuential trend contributing\
    \ to agricultural development. Therefore, encouraging farmers\nto adopt digital\
    \ technologies and mobile devices in farming practices has become a policy priority\n\
    worldwide. However, the literature on the psychological factors driving farmers’\
    \ intentions to adopt\nSA technologies remains limited. This study investigated\
    \ how farmers’ knowledge and attitudes\nregarding SA aﬀect their adoption of smart\
    \ technologies in Taiwan. A total of 321 farmers participated\nin a survey in\
    \ 2017 and 2018, and the data were used to construct an ordinary least squares\
    \ regression\nmodel of SA adoption. This study provides a preliminary understanding\
    \ of the relationship between\npsychological factors and innovation adoption of\
    \ SA technologies in a small-scale farming economic\ncontext. The ﬁndings suggest\
    \ that policymakers and research and development institutes should\nconcentrate\
    \ on improving market access to established and critical SA technologies.\nKeywords:\

    \ Taiwan\n1. Introduction\nClimate change and food security have become critical\
    \ topics in sustainable agricultural\ndevelopment. The Food and Agriculture Organization\
    \ of the United Nations proposed the climate-smart\nagriculture (CSA) concept,\
    \ which has attracted international attention for its innovative use of\ntechnology\
    \ in addressing agricultural challenges [1,2]. The objectives of CSA are threefold:\
    \ sustainably\nincrease food productivity, increase the adaptive capacity of farming\
    \ systems, and increase climate\nchange mitigation where possible [3–5]. Smart\
    \ agriculture (SA) emphasizes the roles and applications\nof innovative technology\
    \ in agricultural practices.\nThe SA strategy focuses on the use of digital technology\
    \ to create precision farming solutions,\nespecially when combined with the application\
    \ of information and communication technologies and\nother new interconnected\
    \ equipment and techniques. The internet of things (IoT), drones, robots,\nbig\
    \ data, cloud computing, and artiﬁcial intelligence are all new resources that\
    \ are expected to be\napplied to novel farming practices [6]. The integration\
    \ of precision farming systems and digital\ntechnology has become the most prevalent\
    \ trend in agricultural development, contributing to fewer\ninputs, higher yields,\
    \ and less damage in agricultural production. Digitized agriculture has become\
    \ a\nmainstream trend in numerous countries [7–10].\nSeveral similar but inconclusive\
    \ concepts were used in diﬀerent studies, such as agriculture 4.0,\nprecision\
    \ agriculture, smart farming, digital agriculture, virtual agriculture, big data\
    \ in agriculture,\nIoT in agriculture, and interconnected agriculture [11,12].\
    \ These emerging concepts have slight\ndiﬀerences in terms of the emphasis on\
    \ speciﬁc technological applications. Most of these concepts share\nInt. J. Environ.\
    \ Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 7236; doi:10.3390/ijerph17197236\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph\n\
    Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 7236\n2 of 8\ncommon traits and\
    \ values in incorporating new and intelligent technologies into farming practices\n\
    and introducing resource use eﬃciency approaches that minimize production costs,\
    \ reduce farming\nrisks, and increase productivity [13]. The inventory of the\
    \ European smart agricultural knowledge and\ninnovation systems (Smart-AKIS) program\
    \ indicates that SA is mainly related to three interconnectable\nnew technology\
    \ categories: farm management information systems, precision farming, and agricultural\n\
    automation. For instance, smartphone application software has been extensively\
    \ used for remote\nmonitoring and controlling of farming equipment. A similar\
    \ phenomenon is observed in plant factories,\nwhich have employed IoT, big data,\
    \ sensing and monitoring techniques, and automatic environmental\ncontrol systems\
    \ [7]. Therefore, agribusiness and small-scale farmers can beneﬁt from the application\
    \ of\nnew technologies.\nTaiwan’s agricultural sector is characterized by small-scale\
    \ holdings and has been identiﬁed as a\nglobal disaster hotspot (e.g., typhoons\
    \ and ﬂoods) [14]. The Agriculture 4.0 Project was launched by\nthe Council of\
    \ Agriculture (COA) of Taiwan in 2017 in compliance with Industry 4.0 development\
    \ and\nclimate change risks. In the pilot project, an attempt was made to introduce\
    \ advanced technologies,\nsuch as intelligent devices, sensing techniques, robots,\
    \ IoT, and big data analysis to improve agricultural\nproductivity. The government\
    \ of Taiwan has invested approximately TWD 4.5 billion in upgrading\nagricultural\
    \ technologies. The project was renamed the Smart Agriculture Project in 2018.\
    \ The SA Project\naimed to overcome the restrictions of natural resources and\
    \ shortages in human labor resources by\nfacilitating the intelligent production\
    \ and digital marketing of agricultural businesses [15]. The principal\nstrategies\
    \ of the SA Project were threefold. First, the COA selected ten pilot agribusinesses\
    \ as the\nprioritized targets for the ﬁrst stage of SA promotion. The agribusinesses\
    \ targeted were those for moth\norchids, seedlings, mushrooms, rice, agricultural\
    \ facilities, aquaculture, poultry, traceable agricultural\nproducts, dairy, and\
    \ oﬀshore ﬁsheries. Second, the agricultural research and development (R&D)\n\
    institute employed cross-domain technological innovations to create digital agri-services,\
    \ value chains,\nand communication models between producers and consumers, such\
    \ as IoT-based environmental\ncontrol modules, labor-saving carrying equipment,\
    \ and marketing management information platforms.\nThird, the next generation\
    \ of farmers should satisfy requirements for the use of smart agricultural\ndevelopment\
    \ because trained farmers are the foundation of SA development [16,17].\nHuman\
    \ resource development is a key factor in developing SA; thus, encouraging farmers\
    \ and\nagribusinesses to adopt innovative digital technologies and intelligent\
    \ mobile devices in their farming\npractices is becoming a policy priority in\
    \ Taiwan. Therefore, the COA and National Taiwan University\ncollaborated to create\
    \ and design a series of SA training programs to develop human resources in\n\
    smart agriculture. The educational objectives of the SA training program were\
    \ to confer trainees with a\npositive attitude and practical competences, and\
    \ to enhance their SA-related knowledge. Four types\nof training courses were\
    \ oﬀered, comprising of indoor lectures providing general SA education,\non-site\
    \ visits and training, international visits and exchanges, and individual tailor-made\
    \ technical\nassistance provided by SA service teams for each pilot SA industry\
    \ [17]. However, the literature on\nthe psychological factors and individual characteristics\
    \ that drive farmers’ intentions to adopt SA\ntechnologies remains limited. Therefore,\
    \ this study investigated the associations among SA-related\nknowledge, attitudes,\
    \ and adoption behaviors. Moreover, we assessed the eﬀect of farmers’ knowledge\n\
    and attitudes regarding smart agriculture on their adoption of SA technologies.\n\
    The following research problems regarding SA knowledge, attitude, and adoption\
    \ were addressed.\nWhat types of SA technology are crucial for farming practices\
    \ and are better understood by farmers?\nWhat are the driving factors in SA adoption\
    \ behaviors? To what extent do sociodemographic variables,\nknowledge, and attitude\
    \ aﬀect the adoption of SA technologies?\nStudies have focused on the eﬀects of\
    \ psychological factors on individual behaviors, such as\nsocial learning theory,\
    \ the theory of reasoned action, and the theory of planned behavior [18,19].\n\
    Few studies on agriculture have identiﬁed associations between farming practices,\
    \ attitudes, and other\npsychological determinants [13,20]. Furthermore, the theory\
    \ of planned behavior, an extension of the\ntheory of reasoned action, has been\
    \ extensively applied and tested in various ﬁelds [21]. The theory\nInt. J. Environ.\
    \ Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 7236\n3 of 8\nof planned behavior identiﬁes hierarchical\
    \ relations between various beliefs and attitudes aﬀecting\nbehavior. The educational\
    \ goals of agricultural training programs are multifaceted; such programs\nare\
    \ expected to improve the target group’s knowledge level and change their attitudes\
    \ and adoption\nbehaviors [13,22]. This study employed a comprehensive knowledge–attitude–practice\
    \ (KAP) model\nbased on the previous literature, to further investigate the relationships\
    \ in the KAP model of participants\nin the SA training course. Based on the KAP\
    \ model, we hypothesized that SA knowledge and perceived\nimportance were positively\
    \ correlated and that both the SA knowledge and importance perception\nhad a positive\
    \ eﬀect on the adoption of smart agriculture technologies.\n2. Data and Measures\n\
    2.1. Data and Samples\nThe data used in this study were drawn from a survey of\
    \ trainees of the SA training program\nconducted in the summers of 2017 and 2018.\
    \ The training program was sponsored by the COA in\nTaiwan. All participants were\
    \ asked to complete the survey through face-to-face interviews as a\nreference\
    \ for training course planning. The sample characteristics are presented in Table\
    \ 1. Among the\n321 respondents, 79.1% were men, the average age was 42.61 years\
    \ old, and 15.3% and 58.6% graduated\nfrom senior high school or below and college,\
    \ respectively. Furthermore, 12.8%, 22.7%, and 64.5%\nof respondents were principal\
    \ operators, hired staﬀ of agribusinesses, and self-employed farmers,\nrespectively.\
    \ The average farm size was 3.9 hectares, the annual turnover was <TWD 0.2 million,\n\
    TWD 0.2–1 million, TWD 1–5 million, and >TWD 5 million in 25.9%, 28.3%, 26.8%,\
    \ and 19.0% of\ncases, respectively.\nTable 1. Descriptive statistics of sample\

    \ of this study was to explore the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of SA\n\
    trainees. The questionnaire design was developed based on previous research, as\
    \ discussed in the\nliterature review section. The dependent variable was SA adoption,\
    \ which refers to the self-reported\nadoption level of SA technology in farming\
    \ practices. To ensure the dependent variable measurements\nwere valid and reliable,\
    \ photographs of common SA technologies were presented in the interview.\nRespondents\
    \ were thus provided with a framework from which to rate the adoption level of\
    \ the SA\ntechnology from 0 (the lowest adoption) to 100 (the highest adoption).\n\
    The principal independent variables in this study were the levels of knowledge\
    \ and the perceived\nimportance of each type of SA technology.\nThe Smart-AKIS\
    \ inventory of SA technologies [7]\nindicates that abundant farming facilities\
    \ and equipment for smart technology have been developed in\nInt. J. Environ.\
    \ Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 7236\n4 of 8\nTaiwan, including IoT devices, wireless\
    \ sensors, monitoring equipment with automated climate data\nacquisition (climate\
    \ sensing and monitoring), biological image detection and recognition equipment\n\
    (image recognition), cloud and big data analysis services (big data), mobile phone\
    \ apps for farm\nmanagement, robotic farming machines, spraying and aerial photography\
    \ drones, and automatic\nenvironmental control systems.\nRespondent knowledge\
    \ of eight types of SA technologies was assessed. Reference answers were\nas follows:\
    \ “Never heard of it (=1)”, “Heard of it but do not know much about it (=2)”,\
    \ “Have a general\nunderstanding of it (=3)”, “Understand it well and can explain\
    \ it to others (=4)”. The same scale was\nused to measure respondents’ perceptions\
    \ of the importance of adopting SA technology. The level of\nperceived SA importance\
    \ was measured by asking “To what extent do you think that SA technology is\n\
    important for improving the management of your farm?”\nAll responses were scored\
    \ on a 4-point Likert scale, with a larger score indicating a higher degree of\n\
    knowledge and perceived importance (1 = not important at all to 4 = very important)\
    \ of SA technology.\nThe sociodemographic variables measured were gender, age\
    \ (in years), education level, and farmer\ntype. Moreover, the farm features recorded\
    \ were farm size (in hectares) and average annual turnover.\n2.2. Statistical\
    \ Analysis\nThe primary purpose of this study was to investigate the eﬀect of\
    \ psychological factors on the\nadoption behavior of SA technology, after individual\
    \ sociodemographic and farm characteristics were\ncontrolled for. The empirical\
    \ analysis was performed in two steps. First, this study explored the\nassociations\
    \ between farmers’ knowledge, perceived importance, sociodemographic characteristics,\n\
    and adoption of SA technology behavior. The second stage of the analysis focused\
    \ on investigating the\neﬀects of exogenous determinants on farmers’ adoption\
    \ of SA technology behaviors. The following\nequation is the SA adoption function,\
    \ which was used to calculate the relationship between the adoption\nlevel and\
    \ SA knowledge, SA perceived importance, and sociodemographic and farm characteristics.\n\
    The corresponding ordinary least squares (OLS) regression equation is speciﬁed\
    \ as follows:\nSA_Adoptioni = α0 + β′Knowli + γ′Impi + λ′Zi + ν′Ri + εi\n(1)\n\
    where SA_Adoptioni is individual i’s self-reported score for SA adoption behavior;\
    \ Knowli is the SA\nknowledge score of individual i; Impi is the SA perceived\
    \ importance score for individual i; Zi is a set\nof sociodemographic characteristics;\
    \ and Ri represents a set of farming features. The random error\nterm εi is assumed\
    \ to be normally distributed, and α0, β′ , γ′ , λ′, ν′ are the coeﬃcients to be\
    \ estimated.\nThe β′ and γ′ coeﬃcients are of particular interest because they\
    \ represent the eﬀect of SA knowledge\nand perceived importance on SA adoption.\
    \ All analyses were performed using the SPSS software\nversion 22.0 (SPSS Inc.,\
    \ Chicago, IL, USA).\n3. Results and Discussion\n3.1. Association between SA Knowledge,\
    \ Importance and Adoption\nThe descriptive statistics of the knowledge, importance,\
    \ and adoption level of SA technologies are\nillustrated in Table 2. The average\
    \ self-reported score of SA adoption was 40.22, which corresponds to\nfarming\
    \ mechanization using a combustion engine or electricity. The mean total SA importance\
    \ score\nwas 25.87. Among all individual SA items, the SA technologies rated most\
    \ important were, in order,\nautomatic environmental control systems (3.24), farm\
    \ management apps (3.35), and cloud and big\ndata analysis services (3.33). These\
    \ results indicate that automatic environmental control systems and\nfarm management\
    \ apps were the most familiar technologies to respondents and were perceived as\n\
    being the most important smart technologies. The mean total knowledge score was\
    \ 22.45. The three\nmost well-known new SA technologies were, in order, automatic\
    \ environmental control systems (3.04),\nspraying and aerial photography drones\
    \ (2.93), and farm management apps (2.90).\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health\

    The correlations between diﬀerent indicators of SA knowledge, attitudes, and practices\
    \ were\ninvestigated. Signiﬁcant and positive associations were observed between\
    \ all the KAP indicators.\nTables 3 and 4 present the means, standard deviations\
    \ (SDs), and correlation coeﬃcients between\nindividual SA technologies. The results\
    \ of the correlation between SA knowledge and adoption\nbehavior are presented\
    \ in Table 3. The individual coeﬃcients range from 0.582 to 0.738. All the\nSA\
    \ knowledge indicators were signiﬁcantly and positively correlated with each ther,\
    \ as expected.\nThe knowledge level of individual SA technologies was also signiﬁcantly\
    \ correlated with SA adoption.\nThe three highest correlation coeﬃcients were,\
    \ in order, farm management apps (r = 0.306), cloud and\nbig data analysis services\
    \ (r = 0.296), and biological image detection and recognition techniques\n(r =\
    \ 0.286). The results of the correlation matrix support the hypothesis of a positive\
    \ relationship\nbetween SA knowledge and SA adoption behavior, which is consistent\
    \ with the ﬁndings of studies on\ninnovation adoption [2].\nTable 3. Correlation\

    \ in the correlation matrix of SA importance and adoption behavior.\nTable 4 presents\
    \ the correlation coeﬃcients among the SA importance variables, which ranged from\
    \ 0.319\nto 0.667. All the SA importance indicators were positively and signiﬁcantly\
    \ correlated with each other.\nMost SA importance variables were signiﬁcantly\
    \ correlated with SA adoption. However, the correlation\ncoeﬃcients of the SA\
    \ importance variables and SA adoption were lower than the coeﬃcients of SA\n\
    Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 7236\n6 of 8\nknowledge and SA adoption.\
    \ The highest coeﬃcient was 0.266 (automatic environmental control\nsystem). Furthermore,\
    \ our results did not reveal a signiﬁcant relationship between SA adoption and\
    \ the\nperceived importance of image recognition techniques and drone technology.\
    \ Because some correlations\nwere nonsigniﬁcant, the SA importance hypotheses\
    \ of SA adoption were only partially supported.\n3.2. Eﬀects of SA Knowledge and\
    \ Importance on SA Adoption\nEstimated results for the OLS multiple regression\
    \ model of SA adoption are reported in Table 5.\nThe adjusted R-square statistic\
    \ indicated that 25.3% of the variation in SA adoption is explained by\nthis regression\
    \ model. Moreover, the F-value (10.02) of overall signiﬁcance was below the signiﬁcance\n\
    level of 0.001. These results indicate that knowledge of SA, perceived importance\
    \ of SA technologies,\nsociodemographic characteristics, and farm characteristics\
    \ have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on SA adoption.\nTable 5. Estimation results of the\

    \ 0.2 million. ** p < 0.01; * p < 0.05.\nAs illustrated in Table 5, SA knowledge\
    \ and perceived importance were determined to be positively\nrelated to SA adoption.\
    \ For example, a 1% increase in SA knowledge level was determined to increase\n\
    the SA adoption score by 0.932% among respondents. Similarly, a 1% increase in\
    \ SA importance level\nwas determined to increase the SA adoption level by 0.811%.\
    \ Our ﬁndings indicated that participants\nin the SA training program with higher\
    \ levels of SA knowledge and perceived importance would\nadopt more innovative\
    \ technologies in their farming practices. These ﬁndings are consistent with\n\
    previous studies [23] that reported that knowledge and perceptions of SA technologies\
    \ are critical\ndeterminants of innovation adoption behavior.\nThe relationships\
    \ between other determinants and SA adoption behavior were also brieﬂy\ndiscussed.\
    \ The farm characteristics signiﬁcantly aﬀected the adoption level of SA technologies.\n\
    For example, farmers working in the agribusiness sector exhibited higher adoption\
    \ levels of SA\ntechnologies than self-employed farmers, as was expected [24].\
    \ Furthermore, the size and annual\nturnover of the farm were positively associated\
    \ with SA adoption. These ﬁndings indicate that larger\nfarm size or volume of\
    \ business may enhance farmers’ investments in SA technologies. This ﬁnding\n\
    accords with those of previous studies [13,25,26] that reported a positive relationship\
    \ between farm\nsize or revenue and innovation adoption. Most sociodemographic\
    \ characteristics were not signiﬁcantly\nassociated with SA adoption, except age,\
    \ which was positively correlated with SA adoption.\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public\
    \ Health 2020, 17, 7236\n7 of 8\n4. Conclusions\nThis study investigated SA-related\
    \ knowledge, attitude, and adoption among farmers in Taiwan.\nThe sociodemographic\
    \ characteristics of the respondents were collected, and the eﬀects on the adoption\n\
    of SA technologies were determined. Survey data from 321 farmers who participated\
    \ in the SA\ntraining program were collected. The results revealed signiﬁcant\
    \ and positive correlations between\nSA knowledge, perceived importance, and adoption\
    \ behavior. Of the eight SA technologies, the\nautomatic environmental control\
    \ systems were the most well-understood and were perceived as being\nthe most\
    \ important, whereas biological image detection and recognition techniques were\
    \ ranked as the\nleast understood. SA knowledge and perceived importance signiﬁcantly\
    \ aﬀected the adoption of SA\ntechnologies. Therefore, lower adoption levels of\
    \ SA technologies may be attributed to inadequate\ninformation, missing knowledge,\
    \ lack of awareness of the technologies, and lack of perceived practical\nvalue.\
    \ We thus recommend the intensiﬁcation of R&D and SA technologies, such as IoT\
    \ and big data\nanalysis, to satisfy farmer requirements under current farming\
    \ conditions and management.\nThese ﬁndings provide policymakers and agricultural\
    \ educators with important insights that can\nbe used to more accurately target\
    \ interventions that promote or facilitate the adoption of SA technologies.\n\
    Furthermore, these ﬁndings suggest that agricultural R&D institutes should concentrate\
    \ on improving\nmarket access for established and valuable SA technologies. Additionally,\
    \ providing systematic training\ncourses related to the applications of IoT and\
    \ big data in agriculture may enable farmers to engage more\neﬀectively in SA\
    \ practices. However, the research limitations should be considered when these\
    \ ﬁndings\nare being interpreted. First, KAP strengthens the theoretical foundation\
    \ of this study, however, it also\nlimits its depth. Agriculture policy, organizational\
    \ support, computer eﬃcacy, perceived eﬀectiveness,\nperceived usefulness, and\
    \ trust toward SA ventures should be considered in future models. Second,\nin\
    \ methodologies used to analyze the collected data, the mediating role of attitude\
    \ on the relationship\nbetween knowledge and practice could have been investigated.\
    \ Furthermore, the moderating eﬀects of\ngender and prior experience could have\
    \ also been examined.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, J.-H.C. and J.-H.W.;\

    Part of the book series: Advanced Technologies and Societal Change ((ATSC)) Abstract
    Most of the small island developing states (SIDS) that are recognized by the United
    Nations are isolated countries with relatively small populations and very limited
    land and natural resources. Their inherent physical characteristics make them
    highly vulnerable to environmental and economic shocks. Moreover, food security
    is a major concern for SIDS as they are heavily dependent on food imports. Recently,
    the compound impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, war in Ukraine and climate change
    have severely jeopardized food production and supply in SIDS. There is a pressing
    need for SIDS to overcome its vulnerabilities and build resilience for the sustainable
    development of its agricultural sector. Innovative agricultural technologies and
    practices including precision agriculture and climate smart agriculture have great
    potential to alleviate most of the unique agricultural challenges of SIDS. SIDS
    need to engage in more smart agriculture research and development initiatives
    so as to increase food production capabilities while minimizing cost and preserving
    resources. Given the limited natural resources of SIDS, there is a need to use
    high technological farming techniques and new technologies such as agricultural
    drones. In this chapter, the unique agricultural challenges faced by SIDS are
    exposed and emerging smart agricultural technologies that can help to overcome
    these challenges are identified and discussed. A detailed review of innovative
    agricultural technologies including Internet of things, artificial intelligence,
    data analytics and drone technologies that can be used to support the agricultural
    sector in SIDS is conducted. Access provided by University of Nebraska-Lincoln.
    Download chapter PDF Introduction Small island developing states (SIDS) have several
    common characteristics that pose severe challenges to their development. SIDS
    differ considerably in their demographic, geographic and economic characteristics,
    however their common physical characteristics of small size and remote location
    make them extremely vulnerable to environmental and economic shocks. For example,
    SIDS have been hit the most by the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, SIDS are the first
    to suffer the consequences of climate change for which they bear little responsibility.
    SIDS are caught in a cruel paradox: they are collectively responsible for less
    than one percent of global carbon emissions, but they are suffering severely from
    the effects of climate change, to the extent that we could become uninhabitable.
    There is a pressing need to reduce vulnerabilities of SIDS and to build resilience
    to external shocks. One of the major concerns for SIDS is food security. Recent
    happenings such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine have exposed the
    excessive dependence of SIDS on food imports. The Food and Agriculture Organization
    (FOA) of the United Nations predict that the world will have to produce 60% more
    food globally, and 100% more in developing countries by 2050 to sustain the growing
    population of the Earth [2]. The food production industry is therefore becoming
    more important than ever. To meet this high demand, farmers in SIDS need to gradually
    turn to the use of new technologies to increase production capabilities while
    minimizing cost and preserving resources. Globally, there is a need to make food
    production efficient and sustainable by reducing both the use of resource-intensive
    inputs such as fertilizers, pesticides and freshwater, and negative outputs such
    as water pollution and soil loss [8]. Without improving yields, 70% increase in
    food would require over 34,000,000 km2 of new agricultural land, an area larger
    than the entire continent of Africa [7]. Countries that produce large amounts
    of food such as India, China, Australia, Spain and the US are close to reaching
    their water resource limits [31]. Given the limited natural resources of SIDS,
    there is a need to use high technological farming techniques and technologies
    such as agricultural drones and sensors to monitor environmental data such as
    soil temperature, soil moisture, humidity, light, ambient temperature and carbon
    dioxide to facilitate precision agriculture. Precision agriculture has the potential
    to promote yield by 1.75%, reduce energy costs by an average of $10 per acre,
    and reduce water use for irrigation by 8% [17]. Climate changes such as heavy
    rainfall, more intense storms and an increase in atmospheric temperature can be
    disastrous for the agri-food production sector in SIDS. To mitigate and adapt
    to climate change to make food production sustainable, SIDS need to adopt smart
    agriculture practices and should embrace IoT with ICT-based decision support systems.
    In this chapter, the unique agricultural challenges faced by SIDS are exposed
    and emerging agricultural technologies that can help to overcome the challenges
    are identified and discussed. SIDS Agricultural Challenges The agricultural challenges
    for SIDS stem from their inherent characteristic of small landmass, remoteness
    and large marine resources that are highly exposed to the warming of the oceans.
    These island nations have a very limited agri-food production sector and are mostly
    dependent on fisheries [26]. They face several agricultural limitations resulting
    in a heavy reliance on imports. Their heavy dependence on food imports exposes
    them to issues of food prices volatility at the international level and food insecurity.
    SIDS are also facing sea-levels rise and reduction of freshwater sources that
    are aggravating the agricultural challenges and food security issues. Moreover,
    over the years many island states have directed resources away from the agricultural
    sector to develop the tourism sector [25]. Consequently, due to the heavy dependence
    on tourism, the economic situation of these island states has worsened dramatically
    with the COVID-19 pandemic. Climate Change and Natural Disasters Climate change
    and associated sea level rise are negatively impacting agriculture in SIDS and
    a recent assessment indicates that this is set to worsen. Indeed, climate change
    is having severe adverse impacts on agricultural production in SIDS which are
    seriously challenging food security in these island states. There are several
    ways in which climate change is contributing to food insecurity in SIDS namely
    drastically reducing food production and increasing food prices. Since climate
    change mitigation activities are increasing energy prices, food production is
    becoming more expensive. Due to extreme weather conditions such as frequent drought,
    water resources required for food production are becoming scarcer in SIDS [6].
    Once fertile land in SIDS is increasingly becoming climatically unsuitable for
    agricultural activities. Moreover, the high variations in weather conditions associated
    with climate change are causing drastic reductions in agricultural productivity
    and significant increase in food prices. SIDS have always been exposed to natural
    disasters such as cyclones and storms for centuries, however climate change is
    aggravating their intensity which is even causing an existential threat to some
    island states. Flash floods and prolonged droughts are very frequent in SIDS,
    and this is severely impacting on the agricultural sector. Food Insecurity and
    Land Use The concurrent COVID-19 and War in Ukraine crisis has exposed the unreasonable
    dependence of SIDS on food imports. In recent years, many SIDS have significantly
    reduced traditional food production including agriculture and had increased investments
    in tourism and urban development. Consequently, in the period of crises, SIDS
    are more vulnerable to fluctuations in food prices at the international level.
    This situation is urging Governments of SIDS reconsider their strategies with
    respect to development and redirect resources to local food production. With the
    limited land resources in SIDS, efficient land use is essential to tackle the
    food security problem [14]. There is a high demand for land for other economic
    sectors such as the tourism industry and foreign investors among others, therefore
    SIDS will have to implement appropriate land use policies. A holistic approach
    is required to address the problem of adequate high quality and nutritious food
    supply in SIDS. For example, strategies to encourage local communities to explore
    organic methods for the production of high-quality food should be put in place.
    SIDS has the potential to become leaders in new forms of agriculture such as hydroponics
    that use less land. At the international level, more appropriate policies and
    agricultural subsidies should be developed in support of SIDS food security. Smart
    Agricultural Research and Innovation for SIDS Recently, there has been significant
    development in agricultural technologies that may help SIDS to build resilience
    to climate change, increase food production and overcome the challenges associated
    with limited natural resources. Innovative agricultural technologies and practices
    including precision agriculture, climate smart agriculture, Internet of things,
    artificial intelligence, data analytics and drone technologies have great potential
    to alleviate most of the unique agricultural challenges of SIDS. Indeed, smart
    agricultural research and innovation have the potential to increase production,
    whilst reducing environmental, energy and the climate footprint of food production
    in SIDS. More investments should be directed toward smart agricultural research
    and innovation so as to develop agricultural technologies that will help SIDS
    to overcome their unique agricultural challenges. The technological revolution
    in farming is led by an ever better understanding of the biology of plants and
    advances in robotics and sensing technologies. Through intelligent digital devices
    with highly advanced image and sensor technology, such as robots and drones, monitoring
    and maintenance of soil quality can be improved, helping to eliminate pests and
    diseases while further reducing the need for agrichemicals. The rapid urbanization
    in SIDS is placing enormous demands on urban food supply systems. Urban agriculture
    can solve such problems by converting urban wastes into productive resources,
    for example, the conversion of organic waste to compost [30]. Technologies such
    as hydroponics, green house, glass house, aquaponics and horticulture are very
    interesting for urban environments in SIDS. The different urban agricultural setups
    will require advanced automation and control which again illustrate the need for
    smart agricultural research and innovation. Additionally, agricultural research
    is required for organic or bio-farming that involves growing crops without pesticides
    for a healthier population. It is widely known that excessive use of pesticides
    on crops increases risk not only to human health but also to the environment.
    For example, agricultural research and innovation in sensing technologies and
    internet of things (IoT) have great potential to transform the agri-food production
    industry in island states that have the challenge to overcome water shortages,
    limited agricultural lands, and difficulty to manage costs while meeting the needs
    of the growing population. Farms can use IoT sensors to remotely monitor changing
    environmental conditions such as soil moisture, pH levels, temperature, etc. while
    attempting to automate processes such as irrigation. Kim et al. pointed out the
    need of convergence toward technology to achieve precision agriculture based on
    the dynamic environmental parameters to make agriculture sustainable for the future
    [12]. Artificial intelligence can also be used to provide new insights and facilitate
    decision making enabling farmers to easily visualize data and take action on insights
    and recommendations. There are also a lot of IoT agricultural systems developed
    both in the research as well as commercial domains that may be very useful to
    SIDS, such as ThingWorx, OnFarm systems that relied entirely on ThingWorx’sIoT
    platform, CropX and FarmBot. ThingWorxIoT platform collects and manages big data
    from sensors on the cloud, offers innovative IoT applications, leverages analytics
    on big data to provide recommendations to help farmers in better decision making
    [24]. Kaa, an open-source IoT platform is a middleware technology that streamlines
    the development of smart farming systems such as field, crop, agricultural equipment
    and climate monitoring, prediction analytics for crops while providing smart logistics
    [11]. Both CropX offers an adaptive irrigation system that automatically optimizes
    irrigation based on the needs of the soil and the crops by measuring environmental
    variables and making use of predictive algorithms [5]. Research and innovation
    are also required to make agricultural systems more intelligent and help farmers
    in SIDS decision making to increase food productivity [18]. There is very limited
    use of computational intelligence in existing agricultural systems. Computational
    intelligence (CI) is the discipline of replicating human intelligence on computers
    and it can provide the missing knowledge-based layer on the various existing agricultural
    systems. Therefore, there is an urgent need to exploit techniques and algorithms
    of computational intelligence, machine learning and/or artificial intelligence
    in those systems, such as case-based reasoning, rule-based reasoning, artificial
    neural networks, fuzzy models and swarm intelligence. With the adoption of these
    techniques and algorithms, the real time processing of sensor data and the real
    time reasoning in the IoT-enabled precision agriculture systems can definitely
    shape the future of agriculture in SIDS and help farmers in meeting the increasing
    food demands [17]. Another area that requires extensive research and innovation
    is climate smart agriculture (CSA). CSA is a holistic approach of managing the
    agricultural landscapes including fisheries, livestock and cropland while addressing
    the challenges related to accelerating climate change and food security [13].
    CSA has the potential to help SIDS in achieving three very important outcomes
    including increasing food productivity and improving nutrition security; enhancing
    resilience against climate related risks and vulnerability to diseases, pests,
    drought, and reducing emissions by pursuing lower emissions for each kilo of food
    produced. Indeed, CSA can help SIDS to systematically consider the tradeoffs that
    exist between productivity, adaptation and mitigation. Emerging Agricultural Technologies
    This section discusses the emerging technologies which may support the agricultural
    sector in the Small Island Developing States. The emerging technology has greater
    potential to increase food production and allow SIDS to build resilience to environmental
    and economic shocks. The emerging technologies such as drone, artificial intelligence
    and IoT will be elaborated and their adoptions to SIDS are discussed. Drones Drones,
    also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being used in the
    agricultural sector due to their relatively low cost and ability to efficiently
    take pictures and collect data on crops and animals. Drones come in various sizes
    and weights. Depending on the application, the appropriate drone is used. However,
    all drones come with a digital camera in order to capture images or videos. Applications
    of drones in SIDS are as follows (and not limited to): Monitoring the health of
    crop Surveying soil and land conditions Pest and disease control. Crop Health
    Monitoring To monitor the health of crops, a drone with a high resolution camera
    embedded with sensors to capture both visible light (Red, Green and Blue) and
    near-infrared (NIR) light are used. Usually the sensors are termed as multispectral
    or hyper spectral which can detect light in discrete chunks and are used for monitoring
    specific [3]. When a drone flies over vegetation, the sensors will be capturing
    reflectance information of plants (which is the ultraviolet radiation (NIR) generated
    by the plants). Those data which have been collected could be used to classify
    images into leaves, soil, plants and they would provide valuable information on
    the physiology and form of the crop. In addition, one significant information
    which is captured is the chlorophyll values from plants’ leaves (through the strong
    reflectance values (NIR) generated). When the reflectance value is low, this indicates
    that the plant is dehydrated or dead. Otherwise, a high reflectance value indicates
    strong growth rate. Figure 17.1 shows an example how we can differentiate among
    the health states of the leaves. Fig. 17.1 Multispectral health of leaves (©agribox.com,
    Sylvester [22]) Full size image Moreover, through the imagery data, it will be
    easier to detect areas where growth has been delayed due to underlying soil conditions
    or environmental conditions. Quick actions can be taken such as re-seeding the
    area before the actual harvest starts. Also the real time monitoring of the various
    vegetative stages will contribute to a high yield, decrease the use of fertilizers
    and allow farmers to experiment with other types of crops to diversify their production.
    Furthermore, depending on the type of crop, a farmer can at an early stage estimate
    his yield and overall productivity by counting the number of flowers or fruits
    at a specific stage. This will enable the farmers to adapt their farming strategies
    if ever they find that they are not reaching their required productivity such
    as adapting their irrigation or fertilizers treatment. Thus, the use of drones
    will enable a dynamic crop health monitoring which would have a direct economic
    impact on the farmers and their livelihood. Instead of treating a crop at its
    last stage of its health, it is better to intervene as soon as a problem is detected.
    This will save cost and increase yield production. Surveying Soil and Land Conditions
    Drones have extensively been used to make a rapid assessment of the soil and land
    condition after the occurrence of cyclones, floods and landslides (which are frequently
    being faced by SIDS). Through their imaging and sensing capabilities, drones can
    quickly detect soil erosion, soil PH and nutrients deficiencies [20]. By detecting
    those latter issues at an early stage, remedial action can be taken. Thus, this
    will avoid expensive and time-consuming actions if they were to be discovered
    at a later stage [22]. The impact of an early detection will significantly improve
    the crop yield. In addition, using the imagery data, various crop maps can be
    produced which will enable farmers to better plan their seeding processes. They
    will know the appropriate area of land which will be beneficial to start the seeding
    process and which area of land to avoid as shown in Fig. 17.2. Furthermore, through
    the frequent monitoring of the land, the surrounding infrastructure can be monitored
    such as the fencing or other farm equipment (Bendig 2012). Fig. 17.2 Tea plant
    mapping (©TCS, Sylvester [22]) Full size image Pest and Disease Control Drones
    have become an important tool in fighting against insect infestation, fungal diseases
    and bacterial invasion. Through the use of the multispectral sensor (embedded
    in the drones) which regularly scans the vegetation and capturing the reflectance
    values, it is easy to distinguish between healthy and diseased leaves. The early
    detection of unhealthy leaves will immediately trigger remedial actions and also
    guards against the spreading of a potential viral infection which can destroy
    an entire harvest. Subsequently the early detection of any disease will have an
    environmental impact since only a minimum amount of pesticides will be required.
    The fear of an excessive amount of pesticides to be washed away will also be decreased.
    This will mitigate water pollution caused by the over application of pesticides.
    In the same vein, the data provided by the drone will enable the correct identification
    of the disease and the correct treatment to be applied (the correct pesticide
    to be used). This will avoid any wrong diagnosis to be made and prevent any damages
    caused through the wrong application of pesticides. Distinguishing between a disease
    and a weed invasion is primordial since this will have an effect in the treatment
    and in the correct selection of herbicides, insecticides and pesticides. Identifying
    the correct treatment is important in order to avoid any environmental damage
    [21]. Figure 17.3 shows a pest incidence map which illustrates the area under
    which there might be a potential disease outbreak. Fig. 17.3 Pest incidence (©TCS,
    Sylvester [22]) Full size image Regulatory Framework for Drones in SIDS Operating
    a drone requires special clearance from a regulatory body. Usually it is the Civil
    Aviation body which delivers a clearance to fly the drone. Depending on the weight
    of the drone, the drone operator should ensure that all safety precautions are
    observed so as to minimize public harm [1]. The drone operator should adhere to
    the license obtained from the regulator. For example, drones should be flown at
    a certain time of the day and at a certain altitude. It should be kept at a certain
    distance from a public place and from an airport. It should not be used to cause
    any nuisance or trespass any perimeter. Internet of Things Internet of Things
    (IoT) is a disruptive technology which is changing the way agriculture is being
    conducted. IoT is a paradigm shift toward a sustainable and ecological way of
    performing agriculture [18]. In essence IoT is an ecosystem which is composed
    of sensors, communication protocol, cloud platform and analytic and end user technologies.
    Such an IoT ecosystem enables the real time monitoring of plants and animals in
    order to detect any abnormalities at an early stage and to increase productivity
    as well as automating the agricultural process. Sensors are intensively being
    used to collect vital information such as the plant condition, soil moisture level,
    humidity level, temperature of the surrounding and the presence of chemicals and
    gasses. Those data are captured and transmitted to a cloud storage system on the
    Internet through different communication protocols [11]. Those data are analyzed
    using AI in order to provide informed decisions to the farmers. The importance
    of IoT as a whole helps to provide useful and real time information which would
    assist farmers in their day to day activities. The application of IoT in agriculture
    and farming is wide and diverse: The data collected and analyzed in an IoT system
    are used to automate the irrigation process [23] whereby water is used in a sustainable
    manner. Thus water is provided to the right amount which helps to reduce cost,
    reduces water waste and prevents waterlogging. IoT is used in greenhouses to manage
    the temperature and moisture automatically. This ensure the optimal condition
    for plant growth IoT is applied in vineyards and horticulture to monitor environmental
    conditions IoT is widely used in shed (livestock shed) to monitor the enclosure
    in order to To detect stress and improve animal welfare. To timely detect a disease
    outbreak and to provide early veterinary treatment. To improve the reproduction
    rate. Through the use of sensors, we can know exactly when a cow is in heat and
    insemination can take place. The next heat cycle can also be predicted. Optimize
    the feeding of the livestock (prevent under or over-feeding). Geo-localization
    of livestock is made possible. IoT is becoming an important tool in order to monitor
    livestock from birth to slaughter so as to provide traceability and to be compliant
    with food and safety regulation (it will be possible to know whether there has
    been a breach in the cold chain thereby ensuring the safety and quality of the
    product). Adoption of IoT in SIDS The enabling factor which would allow the implementation
    of the IoT ecosystem relies on the ICT infrastructure put in place in the country.
    The ICT infrastructure should at least support wireless technologies in the form
    of WIFI and 3G. Mobile Broadband is also an important ingredient in the IoT ecosystem.
    In nearly 21 SIDS countries, the mobile broadband coverage has improved significantly
    since 2014 reaching around 85% of the population in 2018 [10]. Such broadband
    coverage will encourage investment in the development of IoT systems. Furthermore,
    the importance of the SIDS to be connected to the undersea fiber-optic has been
    recognized. By 2019, 32 countries out of 39 SIDS are connected to at least one
    submarine fiber-optic cable [10]. Being connected to the cable will only accelerate
    the adoption of IoT. An improved ICT infrastructure will enable access to the
    Internet and will improve the digital literacy of the country. This will create
    a conducive environment to boost IoT-enabled systems. Regulatory Framework for
    IoT in SIDS Even though many SIDS have good Internet connectivity, the proliferation
    of IoT systems in SIDS is relatively quiet slow. One of the main stumbling blocks
    is on the Data Ownership [1]. Since sensors collect a wide variety of data, the
    question of who owns the data becomes a significant issue because there are different
    stakeholders involved such as the farmers, the software and hardware providers.
    In addition, the retention and access to the raw data can become a cause of concern.
    For example, a bank or insurance can use the raw data to predict the productivity
    of a farmer before sanctioning a loan or insurance. In another example, the health
    data of livestock could be used to adversely affect farmers. To dissipate the
    latter concerns and to accelerate the adoption of IoT, a regulatory framework
    should be put in place which will take into account the Data Protection and Cyber
    Laws surrounding the use of data in an IoT ecosystem. This will enable users to
    have trust in the system. However, it must be said that many SIDS countries have
    strong laws regarding the use of data which can be amended to cater for IoT data.
    Artificial Intelligence Artificial intelligence is slowly transforming the agricultural
    sector as a whole. AI covers a wide range of technologies such as machine learning,
    neural network, deep learning and blockchain. The main idea behind AI is the ability
    to perform tasks without human intervention. AI is especially employed to analyze
    data and to provide informed decisions based on the data and offers prediction
    capabilities. For example, all the data that has been captured by drones and sensors
    in an IoT system are analyzed using AI. Those analysis are performed quickly and
    trends are derived to assist in the decision making process. AI has improved crop
    production and enhanced the real time monitoring. It has contributed positivity
    in the food industry. The use of AI in agriculture has opened up a new branch
    in agriculture namely Precision agriculture [29]. However, AI is a supporting
    technology which is used along with other technologies and hardware to automate
    the agricultural process. For example, AI is intensively used in a smart irrigation
    system. Sensors which are capturing soil moisture data are transmitted to an analytic
    platform where AI is applied. The output of the analysis can determine whether
    to start or stop an irrigation process automatically and without the intervention
    of the farmer. Similar process happens when drones capture real time images and
    are transmitted for processing. Analyzing those images without AI will be impossible.
    This is because various techniques should be applied to the image such as image
    recognition and perception in order to detect or identify a color on a leaf, pest
    or disease. Another application of AI is in chatbots for farmers. Chatbots are
    virtual assistants which automate the interaction with end users using the natural
    language of the user. Figure 17.4 shows a chatbot interaction. Different chatbots
    have been created to assist farmers during their cultivation process. For example,
    authorities provide farmers with chatbots which they can use to query on the properties
    of a plant or animal and they will be provided with advice and recommendation.
    Fig. 17.4 A chatbot conversation [28] Full size image In addition, AI is used
    to control robots which perform various agricultural operations in order to increase
    efficiency when compared to traditional machineries. AI enabled robots perform
    different tasks efficiently and autonomously such as removal of weeds, sowing,
    irrigation and surveillance. Blockchain is another emerging technology which is
    used in the agricultural industry in order to provide a traceability trail of
    the food from its creation until it comes to our plate. Customers are very careful
    to avoid consuming food which has been produced in an unethical way and without
    following proper agricultural standards. In order to follow the whole supply chain
    from the producers, through the suppliers until it reaches the client, blockchain
    can be used. It will provide a traceability aspect which will ensure quality as
    shown in Fig. 17.5. Fig. 17.5 Blockchain technology [16] Full size image The contribution
    of AI to agriculture is enormous because it has an impact on the harvesting process,
    crop yield and productivity. It has decreased the intervention of humans enabling
    the farmer to concentrate on other aspects of farming. This has reduced the burden
    of farmers whereby labor is an issue. Adoption of AI in SIDS AI is an enabling
    technology. Since it is used along with other software and hardware, it will have
    similar issues such as the data ownership. This issue can be tackled through appropriate
    Data protection law. However the major concern is on the autonomous decision making
    aspect. Determining the legal liability in cases where AI has taken a decision
    which has an adverse effect on someone can be complicated [1]. The latter issue
    is not so evident in the agricultural sector. To better comprehend the need of
    AI in a SIDS country, it will be recommended to set-up an AI council [9]. Mauritius
    has set-up an AI council in order to look into various aspects of AI and its applications.
    Based on the local needs, the council provides numerous advice and recommendations
    on the use of AI. Case of the University of Mauritius Mauritius along with Cabo
    Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Sao Tome and Principe and Seychelles are the five SIDS found
    in the African region. Mauritius is situated in the Indian Ocean and has an area
    of 2040 square kilometers and a population of 1.2 million inhabitants. The main
    drivers of the Mauritian economy are the Tourism sector, Manufacturing sector,
    Agricultural sector, Financial sector, Information and Communication Technology
    sector among others. Agriculture in Mauritius is predominantly dominated by sugar
    cane fields. Nevertheless, the agricultural sector has been diversifying to include
    other crops [15]. In the quest to improve the agricultural sector, the University
    of Mauritius, which is one of the main research institutions in Mauritius, has
    massively contributed in terms of research and development as well as introducing
    innovative concepts to this sector. Thus this section will provide an overview
    of the contribution of the University of Mauritius in promoting and adopting ICT-based
    technologies in the agricultural sector. The University of Mauritius recognized
    the fact that all SIDS face similar challenges as Mauritius. Thus it is important
    to boost the adoption of technologies in the agri-sector. Agri-digital Skills
    The University of Mauritius is a leading tertiary institution which is engaged
    in promoting research and intellectual talent to support the needs of the country.
    In Mauritius, agriculture contributes around 3.41% of the GDP and 6% of the population
    works in the agricultural sector [4]. In order to support the agricultural sector
    and to promote the use of technology in this sector, the Faculty of Agriculture
    (FoA) in joint collaboration with the Faculty of Information Communication and
    Digital Technologies (FoICDT) are mounting interdisciplinary academic programs
    which include modules such covers the use of emerging technologies [27]. In addition,
    various PhD research is conducted in the field of agriculture with the support
    of ICT. Training and short courses are also offered in digital agri-skills and
    digital entrepreneurship [4] in order to foster the agri-e-commerce culture. Moreover
    at the FoICDT, numerous prototypes are developed to tackle agricultural issues
    and to demonstrate their viability and applicability. For example, prototypes
    such as smart farming systems, smart irrigation systems, smart greenhouse systems,
    smart livestock monitoring systems and smart pest control systems are developed
    to tackle specific agricultural issues. Other prototypes are also developed using
    the above mentioned emerging technologies. The overall aim of both Faculties is
    to equip the student with the digital knowledge and digital skills to accelerate
    the adoption of technologies in the agricultural sector. AgriTECH Park In March
    2020, the University of Mauritius launched the AgriTECH Park, in order to boost
    collaboration between Academia, the private sector, SMEs, Start-ups and Incubators,
    and supportive of entrepreneurs in the development of innovative products and
    services for the Agri-Food sector in Mauritius and in the region [4, 27]. The
    focus of the AgriTECH Park will be around smart agriculture, biotechnology and
    food security. The AgriTech Park will host an Agri-Processing Incubator which
    will assist in turning ideas and prototypes into commercial products. It will
    also be a place where students will gain valuable hand-on experience on real agricultural
    problems and foster a new breed of agri-technopreneur. A digital culture of start-up
    around the agricultural sector will be promoted targeting smart farming, smart
    hydroponic, smart aquaponics and smart livestock businesses. The AgriTech Park
    will also provide an environment to conduct research through the set-up of innovative
    labs where research will be carried out with local, regional and international
    collaborators. The research output will be shared among all SIDS. Multidisciplinary
    Research The University of Mauritius is engaged in various multidisciplinary and
    transdisciplinary research in agriculture. One such research is the Development
    Smart Innovation through Research in Agriculture (DeSIRA) project which is funded
    by the European Union in the field of smart agriculture. The aim of the DeSIRA
    project is to research and develop smart and innovative solutions in the field
    of agriculture to adapt to climate change in Mauritius. Through the DeSIRA project,
    it is expected to conduct research and produce scientific knowledge and prototype
    to enhance the innovation capacities and techniques which stakeholders (farmers,
    private and public sectors, universities among others) can use to reproduce. This
    will encourage the stakeholders to adopt such techniques in order to increase
    their productivity [4, 19, 27]. The University of Mauritius is extensively involved
    in searching new avenues in order to promote the use of the technologies in agriculture
    by collaborating with local, regional and international shareholders. For example,
    the University of Mauritius has signed several MoU with local ICT companies in
    order to develop prototypes and research in the agricultural sector. Those types
    of collaboration show that the University of Mauritius is finding other means
    of bringing technology to the sector. Thus the University of Mauritius is enlarging
    its approach to transdisciplinary research. The output of those research will
    contribute to knowledge space among the SIDS. Conclusion Almost all of the SIDS
    share similar characteristics and are vulnerable to climate change. The latter
    has a direct impact on the environment and on the ability for producing food locally.
    With the rising inflation around the world and the impact of the war, there is
    a pressing need for SIDS to decrease their dependency on importing food and to
    start producing them locally. Most SIDS have the capacity to become self-sufficient
    by improving their agricultural sector. In order to enhance the agricultural sector
    in SIDS, the use of smart innovative agricultural technologies and conducting
    research is essential. As a result, this chapter provides an insight of the main
    agricultural challenges encountered by SIDS and provides an overview of the main
    emerging technologies such as drones, IoT and AI in agriculture. The opportunities
    and challenges of the emerging technologies are highlighted with respect to their
    adoption to SIDS. The importance of conducting innovative multidisciplinary research
    and building digital skills set in the field of agriculture are also discussed
    through the University of Mauritius case study. Undoubtedly, the opportunities
    provided by the use of smart innovative agricultural technologies and research
    will contribute largely to a sustainable agri-food sector in SIDS. References

    agriculture techniques have recently seen widespread interest by farmers. This
    is driven by several factors, which include the widespread availability of economically-priced,
    low-powered Internet of Things (IoT) based wireless sensors to remotely monitor
    and report conditions of the field, climate, and crops. This enables efficient
    management of resources like minimizing water requirements for irrigation and
    minimizing the use of toxic pesticides. Furthermore, the recent boom in Artificial
    Intelligence can enable farmers to deploy autonomous farming machinery and make
    better predictions of the future based on present and past conditions to minimize
    crop diseases and pest infestation. Together these two enabling technologies have
    revolutionized conventional agriculture practices. This survey paper provides:
    (a) A detailed tutorial on the available advancements in the field of smart agriculture
    systems through IoT technologies and AI techniques; (b) A critical review of these
    two available technologies and challenges in their widespread deployment; and
    (c) An in-depth discussion about the future trends including both technological
    and social, when smart agriculture systems will be widely adopted by the farmers
    globally. A Deep Learning Framework using Convolutional Neural Networks to detect

    \ increasingly targeting Internet of Things (IoT) networks, which connect\nindustrial\
    \ devices to the Internet. To construct network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs),\
    \ which\ncan secure Agriculture 4.0 networks, powerful deep learning (DL) models\
    \ have recently been de-\nployed. An effective and adaptable intrusion detection\
    \ system may be implemented by using the\narchitectures of long short-term memory\
    \ (LSTM) and convolutional neural network combined with\nlong short-term memory\
    \ (CNN–LSTM) for detecting DDoS attacks. The CIC-DDoS2019 dataset was\nused to\
    \ design a proposal for detecting different types of DDoS attacks. The dataset\
    \ was developed\nusing the CICFlowMeter-V3 network. The standard network trafﬁc\
    \ dataset, including NetBIOS,\nPortmap, Syn, UDPLag, UDP, and normal benign packets,\
    \ was used to test the development of\ndeep learning approaches. Precision, recall,\
    \ F1-score, and accuracy were among the measures used\nto assess the model’s performance.\
    \ The suggested technology was able to reach a high degree of\nprecision (100%).\
    \ The CNN–LSTM has a score of 100% with respect to all the evaluation metrics.\
    \ We\nused a deep learning method to build our model and compare it to existing\
    \ systems to determine\nhow well it performs. In addition, we believe that this\
    \ proposed model has highest possible levels of\nprotection against any cyber\
    \ threat to Agriculture 4.0.\nKeywords: deep leaning; Agriculture 4.0; food security;\

    \ 4.0 technology has made it possible to create a setting in which all components\n\
    are continually and easily connected with one another. All of the devices and\
    \ functions, such\nas cyber–physical systems (CPS), are referred to as services.\
    \ These services are in continuous\ncommunication with one another, which allows\
    \ for a high degree of coordination [1–4]. In\nthis sense, the capability to coordinate\
    \ activities is essential for improving supply chain\nmanagement. This is because\
    \ optimization typically requires the consideration of a large\nnumber of factors\
    \ that are in constant competition with each other [5]; this is where the\nability\
    \ to coordinate activities becomes essential. Figure 1 shows the Industry 4.0\
    \ technology\nfor developing agriculture.\nAccording to the ﬁndings of the most\
    \ recent study conducted by the Food and Agri-\nculture Organization of the United\
    \ Nations [6], in order to sustainably sate Earth’s ever-\nincreasing human population,\
    \ which is projected to approach 9 billion by the year 2050 [7],\nglobal food\
    \ production will need to increase by a factor of 70 percent between now and\n\
    2050. As a result of the predicted rise in the number of Internet of Things (IoT)\

    \ also likely to expand greatly\nin the coming years in order to meet these demands\

    \ which have contributed to the sector’s rapid technical expansion. Although\n\
    Agriculture 4.0 is anticipated to become the industry standard, the presence of\
    \ physical\ndangers and hazards in this speciﬁc ﬁeld is a signiﬁcant aspect that\
    \ poses a potential barrier\nto the widespread acceptance and implementation of\
    \ these innovations. Some of these\ndangers, such as climate conditions, tend\
    \ to stay the same over the course of many years,\nwhile others are related to\
    \ the rapid advancement of technological solutions. A number of\ntechnologies\
    \ in digital agriculture, from a vertical farm’s heating and ventilation systems\
    \ to\na drone spraying crops, are vulnerable to cyberattacks. The water system\
    \ in Florida [11], a\ndairy and beverage company in Australia [12,13], and the\
    \ world’s largest meatpacker, wool\nNet software, have all recently been the targets\
    \ of cyberattacks that have made headlines\nthroughout the world. This has brought\
    \ to light the weaknesses that are present in digital\nagriculture, as well as\
    \ the potentially catastrophic repercussions that these vulnerabilities\nmight\
    \ have on the general population in terms of supply, labor, and cost.\nIn Agriculture\
    \ 4.0, however, there are numerous new cybersecurity vulnerabilities\nsince thousands\
    \ of devices based on IoT are currently being installed in open ﬁelds. An\nadversary\
    \ seeking to break into the Agriculture 4.0 network will utilize a variety of\
    \ tech-\nniques, including distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, scanning\
    \ attacks, and fake\ndata injection attacks, in order to interfere with the normal\
    \ operation of IoT-based equip-\nment. For instance, if soil pH increases excessively,\
    \ this suggests that farmers will raise the\namount of ammonium added to the soil.\
    \ If the pH falls, this indicates that the farmer will\nlower the amount of ammonium\
    \ added to the soil. With this knowledge, an attacking party\nmay conduct distributed\
    \ denial-of-service assaults to wreak havoc on the pH parameters.\nTherefore,\
    \ it is imperative that sensitive data, such as pH values, be shielded from any\n\
    potential cyberattacks [14]. In addition to authentication, access control, and\
    \ integrity\nprocedures, researchers in the ﬁeld of information security recommend\
    \ employing an\nintrusion detection system (IDS) [15,16]. This would protect Agriculture\
    \ 4.0 from being\ndamaged, altered, tampered with, or accessed by unauthorized\
    \ parties.\nThe fourth industrial revolution has made extensive use of these developing\
    \ technolo-\ngies, and it should not be difﬁcult to replicate their use in agricultural\
    \ settings. In this\nway, the adoption of new developing technologies is not the\
    \ most signiﬁcant hurdle to\nAgriculture 4.0′s development but rather the primary\
    \ guarantee of security and privacy,\ngiven that thousands of IoT devices will\
    \ be implemented in an open ﬁeld. Each layer of\nthe IoT’s architecture has its\
    \ own set of privacy and security problems [17], and they are\ninterconnected.\
    \ Cyberattacks such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks might\nbe\
    \ used by an adversary, for example, to disrupt a service and then insert fraudulent\n\
    data, which could harm food safety, the efﬁciency of agri-food supply chain activities,\
    \ and\nagricultural production. To ensure the safety of computer networks, intrusion\
    \ detection\nsystems (IDS) use a method of monitoring system activity in real\
    \ time and comparing\nit to historical data to determine if an incursion has occurred.\
    \ It is recommended that\nthese systems be used by the cybersecurity research\
    \ community, which uses technology to\nsecure networks. IDS implementation in\
    \ conjunction with other security measures, such\nas encryption, authentication,\
    \ authorization, and blockchain technology, may help protect\nAgriculture 4.0\
    \ against cyberattacks [18–20].\nAt this time, artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) algorithms\
    \ have been employed to identify\nattacks on IoT devices with higher levels of\
    \ assurance. Artiﬁcial intelligence technology\neven has the capacity to recognize\
    \ variations in the channels and tactics used by attackers.\nOne of the issues\
    \ that security solutions had to confront when dealing with attacks on\nthe Internet\
    \ of Things was that hackers would make minute adjustments to their prior\nattacks,\
    \ which the security solutions were unable to spot. AI technologies are being\n\

    \ network trafﬁc in order to protect the IoT\nenvironment from any potential dangers\
    \ [21,22]. Deep learning and machine learning are\ntwo types of learning that\
    \ have been integrated into security systems to identify these kinds\nof threats\
    \ more effectively. Deep learning is one of the advancements in artiﬁcial intelligence\n\
    that may be seen in many real-life applications for dealing with complicated nonlinear\
    \ data.\nThis kind of learning is used to manage the data [23–25]. An implementation\
    \ of a deep\nrecurrent neural network, also known as a DRNN, has been developed\
    \ to recognize botnet\nattacks affecting IoT devices.\nThe main contributions\
    \ of the development of a system for protecting Agriculture 4.0\nbased on the\
    \ deep learning model are as follows:\n•\nWe used deep learning models, namely\
    \ long short-term memory and a convolutional\nneural network combined with long\
    \ short-term memory (CNN–LSTM), for detecting\nvarious types of attacks that threaten\

    \ correlation method for selecting important features that can help\ndevelop security\
    \ systems.\nThis paper’s sections are structured as follows: introduction of the\
    \ research article\nis presented in Section 1. In Section 2 the background of\
    \ study is provided. In Section 3,\nwe describe the procedures for collecting\
    \ data, and methods and experimental design are\ndiscussed in Section 4. Section\
    \ 5 provides a discussion of the results. The last section of the\narticle summarizes\
    \ the main points.\n2. Background of Study\nNetwork security solutions are rare,\
    \ and artiﬁcial intelligence plays a major part in the\ndomain of cybersecurity\
    \ and Agriculture 4.0 for the creation of an intelligent IoT security\nsystem.\
    \ Researchers have wanted to create a smart model that can help protect smart\n\
    Agriculture 4.0 infrastructure from outside attacks. IoT-enabled gadgets have\
    \ transformed\nthe majority of businesses and organizations in recent years.\n\
    There are new threats and concerns in terms of IT security in the worldwide market\
    \ as\nsmart communication technologies rapidly evolve and increase in adoption\
    \ [26] following\nIoT integration and the digitalization of businesses. In a dynamic\
    \ and dispersed cyber-\nphysical environment, a wide range of smart agricultural\
    \ technologies might be vulnerable\nto assaults [27]. These kinds of threats and\
    \ assaults may have a devastating effect on linked\nﬁrms. Precision agriculture\
    \ (PA) and smart farming involve cutting-edge technology and\nremote administration\
    \ that are unfamiliar to the agriculture industry’s stakeholders, and\nmany of\
    \ the new concerns that have emerged are closely linked to those that are present\
    \ in\nother sectors [28], with cybersecurity, data integrity, and data loss being\
    \ the most common\ndangers [29]. Because heavy equipment in the PA industry is\
    \ often linked to the Internet,\nvarious new vulnerabilities have opened up that\
    \ may have potentially fatal results [30,31].\nSmart technologies such as the\
    \ IoT may be used in agriculture to help prevent cyber-\nsecurity assaults and\
    \ threats. Demestichas et al. [32] outlined several strategies for this\nprevention.\
    \ An experiment was carried out by Sontowski et al. [33] on a smart farm in\n\
    which a Raspberry Pi was made to disconnect from the network and stop it from\
    \ rejoining\nas part of a denial-of-service (DoS) assault known as a WiFi deauthentication\
    \ attack.\nUsing fog nodes, Ng and Selvakumar [34] created a vector convolutional\
    \ deep learn-\ning system for anomaly detection. According to the UNSW’s Bot-IoT\
    \ dataset, the method\nachieved an accuracy of 99.991% for detecting DDoS attacks,\
    \ and an accuracy of 99% for de-\ntecting DoS attacks. The deep belief network\
    \ approach was used by Manimurugan et al. [35]\nto identify cyber threats on the\
    \ Internet of Medical Things (IMoT). For PortScan attacks\nand inﬁltration assaults,\
    \ the suggested technique has an accuracy of 97.71 percent and\n96.37 percent,\
    \ respectively, according to the CICIDS 2017 dataset. To identify botnets in\n\
    IoT networks, Popoola et al. [36] developed the LAE–BLSTM hybrid intrusion detection\n\
    Mathematics 2023, 11, 233\n5 of 19\ntechnique. The LSTM autoencoder and bidirectional\
    \ long short-term memory (BLSTM) are\nboth used in the LAE–BLSTM mechanism (LAE).\
    \ It is used for dimensionality reduction,\nwhereas BLSTM is utilized to distinguish\
    \ botnet assaults from normal network data in IoT\nnetworks. The Bot-IoT dataset\
    \ shows that the LAE–BLSTM mechanism achieved a data\nreduction ratio of 91.89%.\n\
    As our world becomes more connected to the Internet, cybersecurity continues to\
    \ be\nan ever-evolving ﬁeld. Every method of detection is only as powerful as\
    \ its weakest link,\nwhich makes it incredibly difﬁcult to control risks in the\
    \ supply chains and networks of\nindividual ﬁrms [37]. In addition, a third-party\
    \ application with one or more potential ﬂaws\nmay put the entire adopted system\
    \ in danger. Companies of all sizes may face recruitment\nchallenges while trying\
    \ to build an effective intrusion detection system against cyberattacks\nand threats\
    \ [38]. Weaknesses in the supply chain are likelier to be discovered as a company\n\
    grows in size. By exploiting these vulnerabilities, hackers might conduct unlawful\
    \ attacks\non vital infrastructure, including water and electricity systems [39–41].\n\
    Security will continue to evolve as our world becomes increasingly linked to the\n\
    Internet. The supply chain and networks of individual companies are very difﬁcult\
    \ to\nregulate in terms of risk. Third-party applications may also pose a risk\
    \ to the adopted\nsystem. Regardless of the size of a company, it may be difﬁcult\
    \ to hire the right people to\nguard against cyberattacks and threats. As a ﬁrm\
    \ expands in size, supply chain weaknesses\nare likelier to be detected. Weaknesses\
    \ in critical infrastructure, such as water and energy\nsystems, might be exploited\
    \ by hackers to carry out illegal attacks [42].\nArtiﬁcial intelligence plays\
    \ a primary role in building an intelligent system for security\nin an IoT-based\
    \ environment. The researchers sought to create a smart model that might\nhelp\
    \ protect IoT devices and infrastructure from outside attacks. IoT has enabled\
    \ digital\nchanges in the vast majority of businesses and organizations. As a\
    \ result, fraudsters have\ndiscovered new complications and weaknesses that they\
    \ may easily attack. Some classiﬁ-\ncation methods were developed by Jokar and\
    \ Leung [43] to identify irregular electricity\nuse, network trafﬁc monitoring\
    \ in advanced metering infrastructure was performed using\nclustering technology\
    \ developed by Alseiari and Aung [44] to identify the IDS, and a sup-\nport vector\
    \ machine (SVM) based on a multiclass was used by Vijayanand et al. [45], who\n\
    found that decision tree techniques were more powerful than the SVM presented\
    \ by Jindal\net al. [46]. IDS detection was evaluated by Boumkheld et al. [47]\
    \ using a standard machine\nlearning method on top of a naïve Bayesian network.\
    \ Jokar and Leung [43] developed\nZigBee-based Q-learning to guard networks against\
    \ intrusion and found it to be the most\neffective technique for monitoring system\
    \ threats. Finally, the use of a hierarchy to pick\nrelevant features from intrusion\

    The LSTM network, also known as the long short-term memory network, is a recurrent\n\
    neural network (RNN) that is often used for the purpose of learning issues involving\n\
    sequential data prediction. The LSTM neural network, like any other neural network,\n\
    contains various layers that help it learn and detect patterns for improved performance.\
    \ It\nis possible that the fundamental function of LSTM is to save necessary information\
    \ and to\nget rid of information that is not necessary or helpful for making more\
    \ predictions.\nThe suggested model has an initial LSTM layer as its ﬁrst hidden\
    \ component. In the\ncase of the combined DDoS dataset, the input to the ﬁrst\
    \ hidden layer is written as (9, 1).\nThe combined DDoS dataset has an output\
    \ shape of (26642, 9) as training, (7613, 9) as\ntesting, and (7613, 9) as validation.\
    \ Both shapes are the input for the subsequent layer.\nLSTM is equipped with several\
    \ gates that allow for control of the ﬂow of information. For\ninstance, these\
    \ gates determine how data enters the system, how it is stored, and how it\nexits\
    \ the system. In addition, there are two more states, which are referred to as\
    \ the cell\nstate and the hidden state. A typical LSTM has ﬁve activation functions,\
    \ as well as two\nReLU functions, three sigmoid functions (one in each gate),\
    \ and one ReLU function in each\ngate. In addition, the LSTM has two ReLU functions\
    \ in each gate (one in the input gate and\nthe second in the output gate).\nAs\
    \ can be seen in Figure 5, the LSTM consists of three gates in its most basic\
    \ form: the\nforget, input, and output gates. Equations (2)–(6) provide a mathematical\

    \ trained using 8 GB of local GPU memory. We also used Keras to create a\nvariety\
    \ of CNN models for comparison purposes.\nThe correlation between characteristics\
    \ in the dataset and their class labels was deter-\nmined using Pearson’s correlation\
    \ coefﬁcient. Using a deep learning technique to obtain\nhigh performance for\
    \ detection of attacks on farm systems based on Agriculture 4.0, we\nselected\
    \ nine characteristics for further processing. We then used our data to train\
    \ deep\nlearning models capable of recognizing and learning the right characteristics\
    \ of the data.\nEach layer of the network had its own set of criteria, such as\
    \ input, hidden layer, and output.\nOur optimal convolution settings were 512\
    \ ﬁlters, a kernel size of 5, and a batch size of 150,\nall with the “ReLU” activation.\
    \ We used a max-pooling strategy with a pooling size of 5 and\na stride size of\
    \ 1 in the pooling layer. The batch size was 150, the activation function was\n\
    “ReLU,” and the dropout was 0.5. For CNN trials, we employed the RMSprop optimizer\n\
    and a learning rate of 0.001 based on the model’s performance at different learning\
    \ rates,\nincluding 0.001, rho = 0.9. On the other hand, recurring models such\
    \ as LSTM are very\nmuch alike. Sequence computation with multiple recurrent blocks\
    \ and extensive training\ntime consumption caused the models to operate at a learning\
    \ rate of 0.001. We raised the\nnumber of recurrent blocks from 10 to 100 in order\
    \ to ﬁnd the ideal performance, but the\nresults were not signiﬁcantly different.\
    \ On the other hand, training time consumption rose.\nAs with the single model,\
    \ the CNN parameters for the combination model were identical\nto those of the\
    \ single CNN model, which has 512 ﬁlters and a ﬁlter size of 5. LSTM models\n\
    with 32 recurrent blocks were the only ones used, since other recurrent models\
    \ performed\npoorly. The LSTM and CNN–LSTM models used RMSprop optimizers with\
    \ learning rates\nof 0.001 and 0.001. Additionally, 64 ﬁlters with a ﬁlter size\
    \ of 5 were used for convolutional\noperations. CIC-DDoS2019 was used to assess\
    \ the system models that have been submitted.\nFor each attack, the system was\
    \ classed as multiclass, which indicates the system’s nth\nperformance. Therefore,\
    \ we have achieved the following objectives:\n1.\nFinding the signiﬁcant features\
    \ that can help to achieve high-performance detection;\n2.\nUsing the deep learning\
    \ approach for detection of attacks to protect agriculture-\nbased IoT;\n3.\n\
    Achieving the highest performance when compared to existing systems.\n4.1. Performance\
    \ Measurements\nThere are a number of measures that may be used to assess the\
    \ effectiveness of deep\nlearning. The sensitivity, speciﬁcity, precision, recall,\

    \ Results\nThe results of the LSTM model for detecting attacks are summarized\
    \ in Table 4. It was\nfound that LSTM worked well when we analyzed all datasets\
    \ with accuracy ratings of 58%\nto 66%. In Agriculture 4.0, it was discovered\

    \ of chemicals and resources, \nand so on, Agriculture 4.0 strives to apply new\
    \ technology and practices in order to alle-\nviate present problems, limit risks,\
    \ and lead to more efficient and safer production. This \nis the goal of Agriculture\

    \ of information and communication technologies (ICTs) that are at the \nleading\
    \ edge of their fields. Given that millions of IoT-based devices will be deployed\
    \ in \nopen fields, the most challenging aspect of building Agriculture 4.0 will\

    \ Discussion\nThe fourth industrial revolution in agriculture is characterized\
    \ by the integration\nof cutting-edge information and communication technology\
    \ with conventional farming\noperations. Security experts have become interested\
    \ in a wide range of cyber dangers\nassociated with this integration. Agriculture\
    \ 4.0 represents a new age of agriculture that has\nrapidly emerged as a result\
    \ of tremendous advancements in agricultural technology. As a\nconsequence of\
    \ climate change, sicknesses, excessive use of chemicals and resources, and\n\
    so on, Agriculture 4.0 strives to apply new technology and practices in order\
    \ to alleviate\npresent problems, limit risks, and lead to more efﬁcient and safer\
    \ production. This is the\ngoal of Agriculture 4.0. This objective is accomplished\
    \ through the application of a vast\nassortment of information and communication\
    \ technologies (ICTs) that are at the leading\nedge of their ﬁelds. Given that\
    \ millions of IoT-based devices will be deployed in open\nﬁelds, the most challenging\
    \ aspect of building Agriculture 4.0 will not be the deployment of\nnew technology;\
    \ rather, it will be the assurance of security and privacy. As a consequence\n\
    of this, each layer of the architecture of the Internet of Things has its own\
    \ set of problems\nregarding privacy and safety [6]. Distributed denial-of-service\
    \ (DDoS) assaults are among\nthe most prevalent types of cyberattacks, and they\
    \ have the potential to compromise food\nsafety, the effectiveness of agri-food\
    \ supply chains, and the output of farmers.\nWe constructed a system that was\
    \ based on the deep learning model LSTM, and\nCNN–LSTM models were applied to\
    \ the system in order to detect any assaults that were\nmade against Agriculture\
    \ 4.0. For the purpose of evaluating the proposed system, the CIC-\nMathematics\

    \ of many classes. The outstanding performance\nof the CNN–LSTM model, taken as\
    \ a whole, achieved a perfect score of 100 percent when\ntesting against all different\

    \ detecting\nintrusion. The ROC metric was used to validate the results of the\

    \ the ﬁve attacks and the\nx-axis represents speciﬁcity metrics. It was discovered\

    \ These models consist of a convolutional neural net-\nwork and a long short-term\
    \ memory, in addition to a recurrent neural network long short-\nterm memory (RNNLSTM)\
    \ and a combined convolutional neural network and long short-\nterm memory (CNN–LSTM).\
    \ The current system was designed and built with the help of \nthe real network\
    \ CIC-DDoS2019 dataset, and approaches based on Pearson’s correlation \ncoefficient\
    \ were applied in order to determine which properties are important. Nine fea-\n\
    tures were chosen because they have a strong association with the classes. This\
    \ was de-\ncided in order to obtain the maximum possible accuracy. The detection\
    \ rate, the false \nalarm rate, the precision, the recall rate, the true negative\
    \ rate, the false accept rate, the \nROC, and accuracy are all important metrics\
    \ to consider when evaluating this system’s \nperformance. \nAdditionally, the\
    \ LSTM–CNN-based IDS model outperformed the most recent deep \nlearning IDS algorithms.\

    \ findings, the CNN–LSTM mode achieved a perfect score of 100% when \ntesting\
    \ its ability to identify attacks. In addition, the IDS model that is based on\
    \ CNN–\nLSTM performed significantly better than other deep learning IDS approaches\
    \ that are \nconsidered state of the art. Both percentages reflect an improvement\

    \ promising, due to the nutritious\nand commercial mushroom benefits and its convenience\
    \ in adapting smart agriculture technologies.\nTraditional Device-Cloud protocol\
    \ in smart agriculture wastes network resources when big data\nfrom Internet of\
    \ Things (IoT) devices are directly transmitted to the cloud server without processing,\n\
    delaying network connection and increasing costs. Edge computing has emerged to\
    \ bridge these\ngaps by shifting partial data storage and computation capability\
    \ from the cloud server to edge\ndevices. However, selecting which tasks can be\
    \ applied in edge computing depends on user-specific\ndemands, suggesting the\
    \ necessity to design a suitable Smart Agriculture Information System (SAIS)\n\
    architecture for single-crop requirements. This study aims to design and implement\
    \ a cost-saving\nmultilayered SAIS architecture customized for smart greenhouse\
    \ mushroom cultivation toward\nleveraging edge computing. A three-layer SAIS adopting\
    \ the Device-Edge-Cloud protocol, which\nenables the integration of key environmental\
    \ parameter data collected from the IoT sensor and RGB\nimages collected from\
    \ the camera, was tested in this research. Implementation of this designed\nSAIS\
    \ architecture with typical examples of mushroom cultivation indicated that low-cost\
    \ data pre-\nprocessing procedures including small-data storage, temporal resampling-based\
    \ data reduction,\nand lightweight artificial intelligence (AI)-based data quality\
    \ control (for anomalous environmental\nconditions detection) together with real-time\
    \ AI model deployment (for mushroom detection) are\ncompatible with edge computing.\
    \ Integrating the Edge Layer as the center of the traditional protocol\ncan significantly\
    \ save network resources and operational costs by reducing unnecessary data sent\n\
    from the device to the cloud, while keeping sufficient information.\nKeywords:\

    \ are well known as not only a healthy food but also a\nvaluable pharmacy, since\
    \ they can provide rich nutrients such as protein, minerals, and\nvitamins as\
    \ well as increase the human immune system to prevent many diseases, even\ncancer\
    \ [1,2]. Therefore, the demand for mushroom products is increasing in the world’s\n\
    food market, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic [3,4]. Although wild mushrooms\n\
    can be harvested in the natural environment, their high sensitivity to seasonal\
    \ variations of\nweather/climate factors leads to unsustainable production [5,6].\
    \ Industrialized mushroom\ncultivation in the greenhouse offers an alternative\
    \ strategy to natural cultivation to improve\nboth the quantity and quality of\
    \ mushroom production because the key environmental\nparameters affecting mushroom\
    \ growth can be monitored and controlled. However, the\nAgriculture 2024, 14,\
    \ 489. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture14030489\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/agriculture\n\
    Agriculture 2024, 14, 489\n2 of 21\ntraditional cultivation method based on manual\
    \ monitoring, controlling, and harvesting\ninvolves time-consuming and labor-intensive\
    \ work which can then increase operational\ncosts, demanding timely, automated,\
    \ cost-effective, and eco-friendly solutions for the\nmushroom industry [7,8].\n\
    Along with the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) when innovative technolo-\n\
    gies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, Big Data (BD), and\
    \ Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) have been commonly employed in industrial automation,\
    \ a parallel revo-\nlution in agriculture (Agriculture 4.0) boosts automation\
    \ in farming activities by applying\nthose new technologies to the agriculture\
    \ sector, so-called smart agriculture/farming (or\nprecision agriculture, digital\
    \ agriculture, and Agricultural IoT). Although it can contribute\nto the reduction\
    \ in labor costs, deploying smart agriculture systems in practice is facing\n\
    other cost-related problems such as setup costs and running costs [9]. On the\
    \ one hand,\nfrom the users’ point of view, especially in some developing countries\
    \ where most people\nworking in agriculture are smallholder farmers, they have\
    \ limited access to modern smart\nfarming infrastructure due to the expensive\
    \ product prices (setup costs). On the other hand,\nfrom the perspective of service\
    \ developers/providers, smart farming system construction\nand applications, which\
    \ are commonly implemented in centralized cloud servers can con-\nsume massive\
    \ resources for BD storage, management, analytics, and security, resulting\nin\
    \ higher overall cloud service costs (running costs). Cutting those unnecessary\
    \ costs is\ntherefore pivotal for many business organizations, especially small\
    \ and medium enterprises\n(SMEs), to optimize their smart farming systems toward\
    \ serving smallholder clients with\ncost-saving infrastructures.\nBesides the\
    \ cloud service costs, traditional smart agriculture systems are often limited\n\
    by the slow network connection (low bandwidth) between Agricultural IoT devices\
    \ and\ncloud servers when all the huge numbers of data collected from the devices\
    \ are directly sent\nto the cloud, which then delays the system decisions and\
    \ hampers real-time applications\nin smart agriculture (high latency) [10–12].\
    \ This is a challenge for mushroom cultivation\nwhen its key parameters require\
    \ strict monitoring within short time intervals [13]. Edge\ncomputing (including\
    \ cloudlets, fog, and mobile edge computing) has recently emerged as\na promising\
    \ solution to bridge this connection gap, thanks to the rapid advancement of\n\
    information and communication technologies as well as hardware capacity. Specifically,\
    \ an\nedge computing node can be regarded as a decentralized local server (edge\
    \ server) that\nallows for storing a small number of data and bringing data computation\
    \ closer to the edge\ndevices [14–16]. By coupling the edge computing paradigm\
    \ with a classical Device-Cloud\nprotocol, the original BD is effectively managed\
    \ in an offline process at the edge server\nbefore transmission instead of storing\
    \ and processing all the collected raw data at the cloud\nserver [17]. This can\
    \ free up the bandwidth for faster connection and for the cloud server\nload spent\
    \ on complicated analytics and applications [16,18]. Despite the wide deployment\n\
    of edge computing in smart homes and smart cities, it is not very commonplace\
    \ in smart\nfarming, and thus there is still room for leveraging and improving\
    \ this paradigm to meet\nthe demands of smart agriculture as well as the greenhouse\
    \ mushroom industry.\nShifting partial work from cloud to edge offers SMEs an\
    \ effective and cost-saving\nsolution to overcome the issues of excessive bandwidth-cloud\
    \ utilization and high la-\ntency [10]. However, determining which features should\
    \ be conducted in the edge server\nhighly depends on the specific functional requirements\
    \ and capacity of each smart farming\nsystem [19]. This suggests the necessity\
    \ to design a proper digital Farm Management Infor-\nmation System (FMIS) architecture\
    \ assisting smart agriculture applications for the specific\nfarmer’s requirements\
    \ (e.g., for each different crop) [20–22], hereafter the Smart Agriculture\nInformation\
    \ System (SAIS). From the perspective of an SME, Sejong Rain Company in col-\n\
    laboration with Chungnam National University aims to design and implement a low-cost\n\
    SAIS architecture customized for smart greenhouse mushroom management in association\n\
    with a paradigm shift to edge computing for business objectives, in this article.\
    \ This system\nwas tested in a pilot site located in Songsan Green City, Republic\
    \ of Korea. The advanced\nAgricultural IoT sensors developed by Korean companies,\
    \ a standard network flow that\nAgriculture 2024, 14, 489\n3 of 21\nis possible\
    \ for scalability, and edge computing tasks suitable for greenhouse mushroom\n\
    cultivation, together with examples of how to implement them, were introduced\
    \ through\nthe proposed SAIS architecture. Finally, a potential SAIS architecture\
    \ for business purposes\nin future studies was also suggested, especially for\
    \ the developing country markets that\nconsider smart agriculture development\
    \ as the core industry.\n2. Background and Related Work\n2.1. Smart Agriculture\
    \ Information System (SAIS)\nThe traditional FMIS, which relied on simple farm\
    \ recordkeeping tasks, has been\ndeveloped since the 1970s to provide useful information\
    \ for decision-makers to effectively\nmanage farming activities [23]. However,\
    \ in the era of Agriculture 4.0 nowadays, the\nadoption of a traditional FMIS\
    \ is limited when massive data are provided from the IoT\nsensors and complex\
    \ tasks are required for modern farm management [24,25]. To cope\nwith the rapid\
    \ increase of agricultural data pools and data-driven farming applications,\n\
    the SAIS, whose cornerstone is the large digital FMIS specialized for precision\
    \ agriculture,\ncan improve the automation and efficiency in managing enormous\
    \ amounts of farming\ninformation including data collection, data processing,\
    \ and data-driven decision mak-\ning [20,25]. Although the core of the SAIS is\
    \ the multi-layered architecture comprising four\nbasic components of Smart Product,\
    \ Network Connection, Data, and Smart Service [22],\nrecent studies paid more\
    \ attention to adapting this core SAIS to the domain-specific uses\nby breaking\
    \ it into higher-level architectures, ranging from the classical three- or four-layer\n\
    up to the advanced seven- or eight-layer architectures. Among the classical architectures,\n\
    the three-layer one, which corresponds to the two-layer without the Network Layer,\
    \ refers\nto the Device-Cloud protocol where the raw data obtained by sensors\
    \ will be directly\ntransmitted to the cloud for storage, processing, and applications.\
    \ The four-layer archi-\ntecture (three-layer without the Network Layer) can allow\
    \ edge computing to involve\nthose cloud tasks. Integrating a separate layer of\
    \ edge computing into SAIS architectures is\nalso gaining attraction and possibly\
    \ becoming a trending paradigm in future studies [17].\nAdditionally, advanced\
    \ architectures improved on the classical ones for business objectives\nby proposing\
    \ enterprise architecture by adding new layers such as the Business, User, or\n\
    Security Layers [26]. For more details, the readers are referred to the literature\

    \ Smart Greenhouse Mushroom Cultivation\nAside from the benefits for human health\
    \ and commerce, edible mushrooms are cur-\nrently becoming the preferred crop\
    \ for indoor cultivation, even in urban farming, because\nthey are easily relocated,\
    \ do not require large space and direct sunlight, and need only a\nshort duration\
    \ until harvesting [35]. However, the major limitation came from the high sen-\n\
    sitivity of mushrooms to the surrounding environment, since extreme weather conditions\n\
    can immediately damage mushroom health. Therefore, the most important task of\
    \ indoor\nmushroom cultivation relies on the timely and continuous control of\
    \ the key environmental\nparameters’ ideal conditions at every mushroom growing\
    \ stage [36]. Previous studies\nlisted a wide range of those key parameters [13],\
    \ but the two most important ones that are\nworth regarding are air temperature\
    \ and humidity, while several studies further consid-\nered light intensity or\
    \ carbon dioxide (CO2) levels. The ideal ranges for these parameters\nvary depending\
    \ on different mushroom species [7,37], and they can be easily, timely, and\n\
    automatically observed and controlled in the greenhouse using IoT sensors, which\
    \ have\nbeen widely reported in the literature as the common approach for indoor\
    \ mushroom\nmanagement. Alongside the development of computer vision and precision\
    \ agriculture\ntechnologies, high-resolution cameras associated with AI-based\
    \ image processing have\nbeen successfully applied in the mushroom industry to\
    \ enhance management accuracy\nand efficiency [38]. Current advances improved\
    \ by combining the advantages of IoT sen-\nsors and camera computer vision, which\
    \ opens a new door for future smart greenhouse\nmushroom cultivation in particular\
    \ and smart agriculture in general. Literature reviews of\nsmart greenhouse mushroom\
    \ management using IoT sensors, cameras, and integrated IoT\nsensor-camera systems\

    \ or white button mushrooms.\n3. System Architecture Design\nBased on the potential\
    \ of the SAIS with edge computing and the increased need for\nmushroom products,\
    \ this study aims to design and implement a multi-layered SAIS archi-\ntecture\
    \ with leveraging edge computing for cost-effective smart greenhouse mushroom\n\
    cultivation. In particular, an integrated IoT environmental sensor-camera system\
    \ and the\noyster mushroom were selected to test in this study. To highlight the\
    \ capability of coupling\nthe edge computing model to the classical Device-Cloud\
    \ protocol, a general three-layer\nSAIS architecture (without the Network Layer),\
    \ which adopted the Edge Layer as a bridge\nfor the Device and Cloud (Device-Edge-Cloud\
    \ protocol), was employed. Moreover, we also\nsuggested the integration of a bidirectional\
    \ (two-way) communication mechanism in this\nsystem to separate the network flow\
    \ into two major domains for different functional tasks,\nincluding the Forward\
    \ and Backward Domains. In each layer, two modules were included\nto respond to\
    \ separated functional tasks in the Forward and Backward Domains, respec-\nAgriculture\
    \ 2024, 14, 489\n5 of 21\ntively. The proposed SAIS architecture applied to greenhouse\
    \ mushroom management in\nthis paper is depicted in Figure 1. Specifically, according\
    \ to Figure 1, the Forward Domain\nenables data transmission from the Device Layer\
    \ (Data Collecting module) through the\nEdge Layer for quality control and aggregation\
    \ (Data Preprocessing module), and then\nto the Cloud Layer (Data Storage module).\
    \ In contrast, the Backward Domain allows an\ninverse direction that AI-based\
    \ solutions developed at the Cloud Layer using stored data\n(Data Analytics/AI\
    \ Development module) to be deployed at the Edge Layer for real-time\napplications\
    \ (Real-time AI Deployment module), then to control the ideal conditions of\n\
    the environmental parameters if necessary via controlling actuators/sensors at\
    \ the Device\nLayer (Device Controlling module). The Forward Domain is responsible\
    \ for the data man-\nagement and storage tasks while the Backward Domain is responsible\
    \ for the solutions\ndevelopment and decision-making based on the obtained data.\
    \ In this study, we describe\nthe proposed architecture following its network\
    \ flow and focus especially on the Forward\nDomain, since it is the mainstream\
    \ in the SAIS. It is important to note that although the Net-\nwork/Communication\

    \ and was already employed in this paper, we did not focus on modifying this\n\
    layer, so it was not mentioned here as a major layer. A detailed description of\
    \ the proposed\nSAIS architecture and its implementation for smart greenhouse\

    \ edge computing model to the classical Device-Cloud protocol, a gener\nthree-layer\
    \ SAIS architecture (without the Network Layer), which adopted the Edge Laye\n\
    as a bridge for the Device and Cloud (Device-Edge-Cloud protocol), was employed.\
    \ Mor\nover, we also suggested the integration of a bidirectional (two-way) communication\
    \ mech\nanism in this system to separate the network ﬂow into two major domains\
    \ for diﬀeren\nfunctional tasks, including the Forward and Backward Domains. In\
    \ each layer, two mod\nules were included to respond to separated functional tasks\
    \ in the Forward and Backwar\nDomains, respectively. The proposed SAIS architecture\
    \ applied to greenhouse mushroom\nmanagement in this paper is depicted in Figure\
    \ 1. Speciﬁcally, according to Figure 1, th\nForward Domain enables data transmission\
    \ from the Device Layer (Data Collecting mod\nule) through the Edge Layer for\
    \ quality control and aggregation (Data Preprocessing mod\nule), and then to the\
    \ Cloud Layer (Data Storage module). In contrast, the Backward Do\nmain allows\
    \ an inverse direction that AI-based solutions developed at the Cloud Laye\nusing\
    \ stored data (Data Analytics/AI Development module) to be deployed at the Edg\n\
    Layer for real-time applications (Real-time AI Deployment module), then to control\
    \ th\nideal conditions of the environmental parameters if necessary via controlling\
    \ actu\ntors/sensors at the Device Layer (Device Controlling module). The Forward\
    \ Domain \nresponsible for the data management and storage tasks while the Backward\
    \ Domain \nresponsible for the solutions development and decision-making based\
    \ on the obtaine\ndata. In this study, we describe the proposed architecture following\
    \ its network flow and focu\nespecially on the Forward Domain, since it is the\
    \ mainstream in the SAIS. It is important t\nnote that although the Network/Communication\
    \ Layer which encompasses the protocols fo\nnetwork connection is also important\

    \ or edge server is a middle layer in this proposed three-layer SAIS,\nwhere edge\
    \ computing is executed, and is the major part of this study. It is important\
    \ to note\nthat edge computing is not a replacement for traditional cloud computing,\
    \ but that it is a\ncomplement for cloud computing. Edge computing is normally\
    \ conducted in low-memory\nand low-power microprocessors and assigned for small\
    \ workloads with lightweight com-\nputation, which fits in with real-time AI applications.\
    \ In contrast, cloud computing is\ncompatible with smart solutions requiring BD\
    \ and heavy computation capacity. Therefore,\na powerful, low-energy-consumption,\
    \ and cost-effective Raspberry Pi single-board com-\nputer was used in this study\
    \ for edge computing in both Forward and Backward Domains.\nIn particular, the\
    \ Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+, which also provides a high-speed processor suit-\n\
    able for HD video processing and dual connections via both WiFi (wireless) and\
    \ Ethernet\nport (wired), was employed in the system. For a more detailed description\

    \ this module is to reduce the number\nof raw data observed from the Device Layer\
    \ while keeping data quality before sending\nthem to the Cloud Layer, based on\
    \ the following sub-modules for preprocessing:\n•\nSmall-Data Storage (1): Since\
    \ a previous study indicated the effective greenhouse\nmushroom monitoring on\
    \ an hourly basis [13], we also set a one-hour (1 h) interval as\nthe standard\
    \ temporal resolution to be sent to the cloud and for mushroom cultivation\nin\
    \ this study. To this end, several raw data should be stored in the Edge Layer\
    \ for\nfurther temporal data resampling and quality control development.\n•\n\
    Temporal Resampling (2): The temporal resampling applied in this sub-module aims\n\
    to convert the 10 min raw data into hourly data and relies on a simple Average\
    \ Filtering\nmethod, whereas the six raw data samples within every 1h interval\
    \ stored in the Small-\nData Storage sub-module will be transferred to this sub-module\
    \ for averaging into\none data sample. This method can be applied to both 1D and\
    \ 2D data in this SAIS and\nmay help it reduce the number of data together with\
    \ overcoming the temporal gaps\n(missing data) that occurred at the original 10\
    \ min interval.\n•\nData Quality Control (3): Despite the benefit of temporal\
    \ resampling in dealing\nwith the gaps in raw data time series, the resampled\
    \ data still probably suffer from\ntemporal gaps (when six raw data samples are\
    \ missing values) or sudden extreme\nconditions. This requires an AI-based data\
    \ quality control filter that can not only\nautomatically and continuously detect\
    \ such outliers in the data stream, but also has\na low computational cost when\
    \ it is applied to the Edge Layer. Even though several\nlightweight AI models\
    \ are compatible with edge/fog computing, the well-known\nk-nearest neighbors\
    \ (k-NN) algorithm was used for showcasing in this research. The\nk-NN is simply\
    \ a non-parametric supervised learning method, which considers k\nsamples of training\
    \ data to solve the classification and regression problems, but it can\nbe regarded\
    \ as an unsupervised learning algorithm when it is applied to anomaly\ndetection\
    \ [50]. The k-NN integrated with a 24 h moving window was applied in this\nstudy\
    \ to identify whether real-time data are anomalous or not, based on the lagged\
    \ 23h\ndata samples stored in the Small-Data Storage sub-module. Whenever the\
    \ ksample\nis detected and masked, it can be continuously used to identify the\
    \ (k + 1) sample,\nand the (k − 23) sample is then automatically removed from\
    \ the Small-Data Storage\nsub-module. This AI-based data quality control filter\
    \ can be applied to both 1D and 2D\ndata. For 1D data, besides transmitting them\
    \ to the Cloud Layer for long-term storage,\nthe processed data were also sent\
    \ to a responsive module of the Backward Domain in\nthe Edge Layer to support\
    \ the system’s real-time decision-making. However, in the\ncase of 2D data, to\
    \ reduce the high computational cost when processing image data,\nthe RGB images\
    \ obtained from the camera were first converted to grayscale images\nand then\
    \ transformed to 1D format by simply averaging the digital number (DN)\nvalues\
    \ within an image scene (scene-averaging) before they can be applied, with the\n\
    data quality control filter. Anomalous DN data samples closer to 0 can be identified\
    \ as\ntemporal gaps (black images), while those with high values (e.g., higher\
    \ than 80—a\ntypical average grayscale digital number value) can be classified\
    \ as light images, which\nstill provide useful information. The quality-controlled\
    \ image data on an hourly basis\nwere sent only to the Cloud Layer.\n3.3. Forward\
    \ Domain–Cloud Layer\nThe Cloud Layer is the final layer in this proposed SAIS,\
    \ which is widely used in\nvarious architectures and allows high computational\
    \ application development based on\nthe quality-controlled BD. Hence, the Forward\
    \ Domain offers long-term high-quality data\nto be stored firstly in the Cloud\
    \ Layer under the Data Storage module management.\nData Storage: Because the accuracy\
    \ of AI models significantly depends on the quality\nand quantity of the training\
    \ data, this module aims to provide a space to store long-\nterm (e.g., one life\
    \ cycle of mushrooms) high-quality data observed from the integrated\nenvironmental\

    \ and advanced computer vision algorithm version among the series\nof the “You\

    \ for real-time mushroom detection with a surveillance camera. Specifically, the\n\
    YOLOv5 model, whose cornerstone is a simple deep convolutional neural network,\

    \ Layer were then delivered to the\nForward Domain in the Edge Layer for further\
    \ preprocessing before being transmitted to\nthe Cloud Layer. The Edge Layer is\
    \ the major layer in this designed SAIS, whose main\ngoal is a stepping stone\
    \ toward saving cloud and bandwidth resources as well as selecting\nessential\
    \ data for the cloud server. Therefore, the Forward Domain in this layer (represented\n\
    by the Data Preprocessing module) is responsible for reducing unnecessary data\
    \ collected\nfrom the Device Layer and conducting quality control for high-quality\
    \ data sent to the\nCloud Layer. To this end, several raw data samples (small\
    \ data) should be stored in this\nlayer for a short period and the Small-Data\
    \ Storage sub-module is responsible for providing\nstorage space in this task.\n\
    The first preprocessing task in this module is data reduction. Since the mushroom\n\
    monitoring on an hourly basis is sufficient and was selected as the standard temporal\n\
    resolution to be updated in the cloud, an average filtering technique was utilized\
    \ as the\ntemporal resampling method to convert 10 min data into 1h data. Figure\
    \ 11 illustrates\nexamples of how to conduct this temporal resampling method in\
    \ both 1D and 2D data time\nseries. In particular, every six raw data samples/images\
    \ within a current 1h duration were\ninitially stored. Since no significant differences\
    \ were observed among these raw data, an\nhourly representative point value/image\
    \ can be generated by simply taking an average\nof those six data samples/images.\
    \ After an hourly representative data sample/image is\ngiven, it will be sent\
    \ back to the Small-Data Storage sub-module for temporal storage and\nthe current\
    \ raw data will be automatically removed from this sub-module for updating the\n\
    coming raw data. It is important to note that, besides the data reduction benefit,\
    \ this method\nalso supports dealing with temporal gap problems, ensuring continuous\
    \ measurement of\nthe data stream. For example, a black image (temporal gap) that\
    \ occurred in the raw 2D\ndata was successfully removed and replaced by a representative\
    \ image (average image\nof the six raw data in 10 min intervals within every 1h\
    \ interval) while keeping sufficient\ninformation, as illustrated in Figure 11b.\n\
    The second preprocessing task in the Forward Domain of the Edge Layer is for data\n\
    quality control, which is covered by the Data Quality Controlling sub-module.\
    \ For the 1D\ndata, since the important task of smart greenhouse mushroom cultivation\
    \ is mainly based\non modulating the ideal conditions of key environmental parameters,\
    \ this sub-module\naims to determine the sudden extreme conditions occurring in\
    \ the environmental data,\nsupporting the system with timely responses to address\
    \ the problems as well as managing\nhigh-quality data sent to the cloud server.\
    \ However, because edge computing is compatible\nwith light computing applications\
    \ that can work well in short-term small-data numbers\nstored in this layer, effective\
    \ and lightweight AI algorithms are preferable for this task. As\na result, a\
    \ widely used lightweight AI model, the k-NN algorithm, was selected as the\n\
    anomaly-detection method in this study. More specifically, the k-NN was conducted\
    \ in a\n24h moving window (k = 23) for the continuous hourly data samples stored\
    \ in the Small-\nData Storage. The real-time outlier detection of the current\
    \ data sample (the k sample) can\nbe performed based on its recent 23 lagged hourly\
    \ data samples. Whenever the k sample\nis detected and masked, it can be continuously\
    \ used to identify the (k + 1) sample, and\nthe (k − 23) sample is automatically\
    \ deleted from the Small-Data Storage sub-module.\nFigure 12 presents the results\
    \ of applying the k-NN algorithm-based anomaly detection\nto the 1D hourly data\
    \ of three key environmental parameters for mushroom cultivation.\nThese successful\
    \ implementation results of the k-NN model-based anomaly detection in the\n1D\

    \ the data reduction beneﬁt, this \nmethod also supports dealing with temporal\
    \ gap problems, ensuring continuous meas-\nurement of the data stream. For example,\

    \ Layer) and is \nshown in Figure 12. On the other hand, when it comes to long-term\
    \ analytics, this module \nadapted the developed YOLOv5-based mushroom-recognition\
    \ model for detection, based \non the stored optimal model hyperparameters from\
    \ the Backward Domain in the Cloud \nLayer. Representative examples of the YOLOv5\
    \ model deployment for mushroom detec-\ntion in this study are depicted in Figure\
    \ 14, whereas single-object (mushroom) areas are \ndetected in continuous images\
    \ with the red bounding box and conﬁdence level by further \napplying instance\
    \ segmentation. According to the ﬁgure, in general, most of the mush-\nroom areas\
    \ during the fruiting period can be well identiﬁed by the system, with a clear\
    \ \ndiscrimination of the non-mushroom areas observed. This indicated the successful\
    \ de-\nployment of a high-computational-cost AI model in the Edge Layer, demonstrating\
    \ its \nsuitability to adopt a developed AI model in the Cloud Layer for edge\
    \ computing. How-\never, there are still several mushroom areas in an image that\
    \ the system cannot detect, \nsuggesting the need for retraining the model to\
    \ improve its performance by the updated \nhigh-quality BD sent to the Cloud.\
    \ The results from the long-term analytics can be inte-\ngrated with those from\
    \ the short-term analytics to support the system’s decision-making. \nFor example,\
    \ if outliers are detected in the streaming environmental data (results from the\
    \ \nshort-term analytics) during the mushroom’s fruiting period (results from\
    \ the long-term \nanalytics), the system can automatically send an alert notiﬁcation\
    \ to the users or control \nthe sensors/actuators for maintaining the normal status\
    \ of environmental conditions. \n \nFigure 14. An example of implementation of\

    The major difference between this proposed research and related work mentioned\
    \ in\nTables 1 and 2 is the combined use of the edge-computing paradigm in a smart\
    \ greenhouse\nmushroom-cultivation information system. In particular, the Edge\
    \ Layer was not included\nin the SAIS architecture for mushroom cultivation in\
    \ Table 1 [28], while none of the previous\nmushroom management studies in Table\
    \ 2 employed the edge computing model in their\nsystem. Thus, the successful practical\
    \ application of this study can shed new light on lever-\naging edge-computing\
    \ paradigm shifts as well as improving smart mushroom cultivation\nsystems. In\
    \ addition, a minor discrepancy that is worth mentioning is the introduction\n\
    of a new low-cost combination IoT environmental sensor made by a Korean company.\n\
    This product combines three single sensors for different environmental parameters\
    \ into\none sensor (three-in-one sensor) and also employs low-cost Raspberry Pi\
    \ single-board\ncomputers working in the resource-saving edge computing paradigm,\
    \ so it can contribute\nto the diverse selections for clients in low-cost smart\
    \ agriculture devices and information\nsystem markets.\nNotwithstanding the benefits\
    \ of edge computing in complementing classical cloud\ncomputing and in improving\
    \ smart greenhouse mushroom cultivation, this preliminary\nstudy may suffer from\
    \ several challenges in the future. First, the implementation costs\nwhen scaling\
    \ this framework up to a larger scale for other crops, together with integrating\n\
    outdoor smart agriculture systems, are questionable, since additional costs from\
    \ new\nIoT devices and their installation might be included in the system. This\
    \ may limit the\ncommercialization of this framework for business objectives.\
    \ Second, the improvement in\nmushroom production efficiency when the edge computing\
    \ paradigm is included is not\nfully analyzed, suggesting the implementation of\
    \ more detailed analyses for this problem\nin further studies.\nAddressing potential\
    \ challenges is also related to the future outlook of this research.\nBesides\
    \ the application customized for mushroom cultivation, the successful practical\n\
    implementation of this study suggests a potential to scale up this framework for\
    \ business\nobjectives and other user-specific requirements (e.g., other crops)\
    \ in future studies. To this\nend, in the future direction, this fundamental SAIS\
    \ architecture is expected to be coupled\nwith the two new layers, including the\
    \ User and Administration Layers. The potential\narchitecture for future the SAIS\
    \ is illustrated in Figure 15, and a detailed description for\neach added layer\
    \ is provided below.\n•\nUser Layer: This layer is particularly designed for the\
    \ users of the SAIS such as\nfarmers or clients. From the user’s perspective,\
    \ the acquisition of quality-controlled\ndatasets and the intuitive visualization\
    \ of these datasets with timely notifications if\nany anomalous events occur from\
    \ the Cloud Layer, and the capability to control the\ndevices manually in an emergency\
    \ in the Device Layer, are preferable. Thus, several\nrespective modules such\
    \ as Data Extraction, Visualization/Notification, or Manual\nDevice Controlling\
    \ Modules can be considered in this layer. Since the users mainly\nwork in the\
    \ Device and Cloud Layers, the users can only access these two layers, and\nthey\
    \ do not need to access the Edge Layer to adjust any edge computing tasks.\n•\n\
    Administration Layer: This layer is particularly designed for the providers or\
    \ develop-\ners (e.g., companies) of the SAIS for business goals. Unlike the users,\
    \ the administrators\naim to manage all the data flow from the Device Layer to\
    \ the Cloud Layer, so they can\naccess and collect data from all the layers in\
    \ this system, which can be conducted by the\nData Extraction/Management module.\
    \ Moreover, the administrators can meet the spe-\ncific user requirements by developing\
    \ suitable solutions, and ensure the safety of the\nsystem by maintaining the\
    \ security. Therefore, the two respective modules including\nApplication Development\
    \ and Network Security are considered in this layer.\nAgriculture 2024, 14, 489\n\
    18 of 21\n \nplementation of this study suggests a potential to scale up this\
    \ framework for business \nobjectives and other user-speciﬁc requirements (e.g.,\
    \ other crops) in future studies. To this \nend, in the future direction, this\
    \ fundamental SAIS architecture is expected to be coupled \nwith the two new layers,\
    \ including the User and Administration Layers. The potential \narchitecture for\
    \ future the SAIS is illustrated in Figure 15, and a detailed description for\
    \ \neach added layer is provided below. \n \nFigure 15. The potential architecture\
    \ of the future SAIS for business objectives. The blue dashed \nborder and arrows\
    \ indicate the Forward Domain and its procedure, and the red dashed border \n\
    and arrows indicate the Backward Domain and its procedure. \n• \nUser Layer: This\
    \ layer is particularly designed for the users of the SAIS such as farm-\ners\
    \ or clients. From the user’s perspective, the acquisition of quality-controlled\
    \ da-\ntasets and the intuitive visualization of these datasets with timely notiﬁcations\
    \ if any \nanomalous events occur from the Cloud Layer, and the capability to\

    \ Thus, several \nrespective modules such as Data Extraction, Visualization/Notiﬁcation,\
    \ or Manual \nDevice Controlling Modules can be considered in this layer. Since\
    \ the users mainly \nwork in the Device and Cloud Layers, the users can only access\

    \ SAIS for business objectives. The blue dashed\nborder and arrows indicate the\
    \ Forward Domain and its procedure, and the red dashed border and\narrows indicate\
    \ the Backward Domain and its procedure.\nNot only are the above additional layers\
    \ being included, but the Device Layer is also\nplanning to be extended with new\
    \ sensors, in the future system. Microcontrollers and\nseveral controlling sensors/actuators\
    \ (e.g., heaters, fans, humidifiers, or air ventilation. . .)\nare expected to\
    \ be utilized, which can complement the current indoor system. Furthermore,\n\
    a parallel SAIS for outdoor smart agriculture with relevant IoT devices (e.g.,\
    \ smart rain\ngauges, automated weather sensors, irrigation valves, or unmanned\
    \ aerial vehicles. . .) can\nbe considered and developed for an integrated indoor–outdoor\
    \ smart agriculture system.\n6. Conclusions\nTraditional Device-Cloud protocol\
    \ in smart agriculture often suffers from the chal-\nlenges of delayed system\
    \ responses caused by low bandwidth and high latency, together\nwith high cloud-service\
    \ costs for data computation and storage when enormous numbers\nof data acquired\
    \ from IoT devices are directly transmitted to the cloud server without\nprocessing.\
    \ Novel edge computing offers an effective solution to deal with challenges in\n\
    this traditional protocol by shifting partial data storage and computation capability\
    \ from\nthe cloud server to edge devices. Nevertheless, selecting which tasks\
    \ can be implemented in\nedge computing depends on user-specific demands, suggesting\
    \ the need to design a specific\nand proper Smart Agriculture Information System\
    \ (SAIS) architecture that is compatible\nwith single-crop requirements.\nBased\
    \ on the nutritious and commercial benefits of edible mushrooms as well as the\n\
    necessity of cost reduction from a business viewpoint, the major goal of this\
    \ study is to\ndesign and implement a standard multilayered SAIS architecture\
    \ for smart greenhouse\nmushroom cultivation toward leveraging edge computing,\
    \ which can be scalable for\nbusiness goals. In this designed SAIS, the three-layer\
    \ architecture, which couples edge\ncomputing in the central layer to connect\
    \ the Device and Cloud Layers (Device-Edge-Cloud\nprotocol) and enables automation\
    \ in mushroom management using an integration of the\nIoT environmental sensor\
    \ (for mushroom key environmental-parameter monitoring) and\nsurveillance camera\
    \ (for intuitive mushroom monitoring) was employed and tested in\na testbed site\
    \ in the Republic of Korea. Via this designed SAIS, we aim to introduce the\n\
    advanced combination environmental IoT sensors developed by Korean companies,\
    \ a\nAgriculture 2024, 14, 489\n19 of 21\nstandard network flow that is possible\
    \ for scalability and suitable edge computing tasks,\nwith typical examples. Moreover,\
    \ a potential SAIS architecture with additional layers for a\nfuture direction\
    \ for business purposes was also suggested.\nThe successfully implemented SAIS\
    \ architecture indicated that our combination IoT\nenvironmental sensor integrated\
    \ with a surveillance camera could monitor the real-time\nkey environmental parameters\
    \ affecting mushroom growth and intuitive mushroom infor-\nmation. Typical examples\
    \ of mushroom cultivation based on the collected data revealed\nthat several low-cost\
    \ data pre-processing procedures including small-data storage, tem-\nporal resampling-based\
    \ data reduction, and lightweight artificial intelligence (AI)-based\ndata quality\
    \ control for anomaly detection within environmental conditions, together with\n\
    real-time AI model (YOLOv5) deployment for mushroom recognition from crop images,\n\
    are compatible with edge computing. In contrast, high-quality BD storage and high-\n\
    computational-cost AI model development can be implemented in the cloud. Moreover,\n\
    integrating the Edge Layer as the center of the traditional protocol can significantly\
    \ save\nnetwork resources and operational costs by reducing unnecessary data sent\
    \ from the device\nto the cloud while keeping sufficient information. Finally,\
    \ the future improvement suggests\nincluding additional layers to meet user-specific\
    \ demands for business objectives and the\nextension of the current system with\
    \ new controlling sensors and a parallel outdoor system,\ntoward an integrated\
    \ indoor–outdoor smart agriculture system.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

    27 Issue: 4, 373 - 399, 04.12.2021 Mehmet Ali Dayıoğlu Ufuk Turker https://doi.org/10.15832/ankutbd.986431
    Cited By: 16 Abstract In the last few years, while the COVID-19 pandemic affects
    food supply chains around the world, the agriculture sector also has faced many
    global problems, such as global warming, environmental pollution, climate change,
    and weather disasters. It has known that technological opportunities are available
    for human beings to get out of these predicaments, solving the interconnections
    between food-water-energy- climate nexus, and achieving agricultural transformation
    from traditional to digital. The aim of this review is to gain holistic solutions
    in a systematic view, based on water-energy-food resources to agricultural digital
    transformation that will play role in sustainable development. The transition
    from primitive to digital is given with road maps covering agricultural and industrial
    revolutions at four stages on timeline. Digital agriculture combined under precision
    agriculture and Agriculture 4.0 are handled based on domains covering monitoring,
    control, prediction, and logistics. Digital technologies are explained with application
    examples such as the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, big data, artificial
    intelligence, decision support systems, etc. Wearable sensor technologies, real-time
    monitoring systems tracking whole conditions of animals in livestock, the IoT-based
    irrigation and fertilization systems that help enhance the efficiency of irrigation
    processes and minimize water and fertilizer losses in agricultural fields and
    greenhouses, blockchain-based electronic agriculture, and solutions based on drones
    and robotics that reduce herbicide and pesticide use are handled systematically.
    Moreover, renewable energy technologies to be provided synergy between technologies
    such as agrivoltaics and aquavoltaics combining food and energy production in
    rural are explained, besides solar-powered pivot and drip irrigation systems and
    environmental monitoring systems. As a result, for a sustainable future, technological
    innovations that increase crop productivity and improve crop quality, protect
    the environment, provide efficient resource use and decrease input costs can help
    us facing in agriculture of today overwhelm many the economic, social, and environmental
    challenges. Keywords Smart Farming, Digital transformation, Sustainable development,

    According to the current increase rate of the world population it is expected\
    \ to reach 10 billion \npeople in 2050. In addition, agricultural production area\
    \ and agricultural labor force is constantly \ndecreasing with the migration of\
    \ rural population to the city with the use of agricultural areas for \nresidential\
    \ and industrial purposes. Therefore, it is a necessity to develop and disseminate\
    \ systematic \nand efficient production techniques that will provide sufficient\
    \ nutrition for humanity. \nThe agricultural sector also benefits greatly from\
    \ what Industry 4.0 brings. IoT (Internet of \nThings), AI (Artificial Intelligence),\
    \ Remote Sensing & ImP (Remote Sensing and Image Processing) \ntechniques have\
    \ been integrated with GIS (Geographic Information Systems) and have been actively\
    \ \nused in agriculture in recent years. In addition to the soil characteristic\
    \ and meteorological data \ncollected by sensors, high resolution multi-band images\
    \ taken from satellite systems and unmanned \naerial vehicles are transferred\
    \ to decision support platforms and artificial intelligence support can be \n\
    used to determine the stress factors of crops and propose instant solution alternatives.\
    \ \nWithin the scope of this paper, in a study carried out by HEKTAŞ R & D Center\
    \ which develops \ninnovation projects in the agricultural sector with the motto\
    \ of “Pioneer of smart agriculture” general \ninformation will be given on the\
    \ practical use of some of the above mentioned precision agricultural \ntechniques\
    \ during phenological growth stages of the wheat in Thrace region.           \

    \ Year:2020 \n124 \n1. INTRODUCTION \nHektaş is a Turkish company which is provider\
    \ of fertilizer, seed and crop protection \nproducts for agriculture sector since\
    \ 1956 and is a subsidary company of OYAK group. \"The \ndoctor of agriculture\"\
    \ slogan which is used by Hektaş along years has turned to \"pioneer of \nsmart\
    \ agriculture\" motto by innovative investment. Within this scope, projects were\
    \ developed \nin the R & D Center established within the framework of the vision\
    \ of taking part in all areas \nthat create added value to the agricultural sector.\
    \  \nThe aim of this study is to determine the factors that cause stress on plant\
    \ growth at \nearly stage and to provide optimal solution through the geographic\
    \ information system based \ndecision support platform that established within\
    \ the scope of precision agricultural practices \nproject. There is a necessity\
    \ to create a spectral library of crops for Turkey's natural planting \nconditions.\
    \ It can be done on selected cultivated area by remote sensing and image processing\
    \ \ntechniques using drones which are equipped with spectral cameras. At Hektaş\
    \ Research and \nDevelopment Center, data is collected and analyzed by aforementioned\
    \ techniques. This library \ncould be reference for further research and practices.\
    \ \nPrecision agriculture techniques that allow effective timing and optimized\
    \ application \nof inputs have the ability to protect crop health, protect soil\
    \ and environment, improve \nefficiency, life quality and sustainability. \nDue\
    \ to the increasing population and problems to feed them, wheat has been the subject\
    \ \nof research as a strategic product. Turkey and world wheat production figures\
    \ will be mentioned \nbelow. \n2. WORLD POPULATION AND NUTRITION PROBLEMS \nThe\
    \ Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), World Health\
    \ \nOrganization (WHO) draws attention to the current situation in its studies\
    \ and publications and \nmakes predictions about the problems that await us in\
    \ the future. \nIndicators shows that by 2050, we do not have the agricultural\
    \ production infrastructure \nto feed the population of 10 billion people worldwide.\
    \ According to the United Nations Food \nSafety and Nutrition Report 2019, more\
    \ than 820 million people are currently under threat of \nhunger, while 670 million\
    \ adults and 120 million children are fighting obesity. Along with this \nunbalanced\
    \ distribution, it is known that approximately one third of the food is lost or\
    \ wasted \ndue to various reasons from the beginning of production to consumption.\

    \ Agriculture Technologies \nJournal of Scientific Perspectives, Volume:4, Issue:2,\
    \ Year:2020 \n125 \nDue to climate change, water resources that are potable and\
    \ suitable for agriculture are \nreducing, while natural disasters also increase\
    \ losses in arable areas. \nDesertification has become one of the most important\
    \ environmental problems of today \nwith the impact of climate change, unsustainable\
    \ fresh water use and land management, which \nconsume resources significantly.\
    \ 4 billion hectares, which constitute 25% of terrestrial land in \nthe world,\
    \ directly affect the lives of 1.5 billion people in 193 countries. Every year\
    \ 12 million \nhectares of agricultural land is degraded. Agricultural production\
    \ is expected to decrease by 2% \nin the next decade. Observations over the past\
    \ five years show that on average 5.2 million \nhectares of forest land is decreasing\
    \ each year. The effect of erosion on the decrease of land \nproductivity in Turkey\
    \ still stands out as the foremost problem. 59% of agricultural land, 64% \nof\
    \ pasture, 54% of forest land are exposed to erosion. Non-agricultural uses (industrial,\
    \ \nurbanization, tourism, mining and transportation for public investment) are\
    \ among the causes \nof land destruction as well as erosion. \nTable 1. Agricultural\

    \ \n \n3. THE FOURTH INDUSTRY REVOLUTION; DIGITALIZATION PROCESS: \nFROM INDUSTRY\
    \ 4.0 TO AGRICULTURE 4.0 \nWhat do we understand when it comes to industry 4.0?\
    \  \nMechanical production systems that use water and steam power to assist workers\
    \ in \nlarge-scale manufacturing of products since the late 18th century are called\
    \ industry 1.0. \nIndustry 1.0 can be considered the beginning of a business culture\
    \ that focuses on efficiency, \nquality and scale.  \nIn the early 20th century,\
    \ electricity was widely used in mass production and adopted \nas Industry 2.0.\
    \  \nThe widespread use of computers and the use of information technologies,\
    \ electronics \nand automation systems in 1970 and later are expressed as Industry\
    \ 3.0. \nThe concept of Industry 4.0, which covers the concept of \"Internet of\
    \ Things\", was used \nfor the first time in 2011 in Hannover Fair. Basically\
    \ Industry 4.0 Cyber-Physical Systems (a \ncombination of physical and virtual\
    \ worlds) is based on the Internet of Things and the Internet \nof Services. Industry\
    \ 4.0 includes intelligent robots, fully autonomous systems, driverless cars,\
    \ \ndriverless trucks, captainless ships, pilotless planes, virtual reality, etc.\
    \ It is the name given to \nthe total digital transformation covering many areas.\
    \  \nIndustry 4.0 defines the Fourth Industrial Revolution, a new level in the\
    \ organization \nand management of the entire value chain in the life cycle of\
    \ products and production systems. \nThis cycle focuses on personalized customer\
    \ demands and includes the entire chain in the \nproduct development and production\
    \ order, from the idea stage to the distribution and recycling \nof a product\
    \ to the end user. The effects of Industry 4.0 on the business world are presented\
    \ in \nthree main areas. These are the integration and digitization of vertical\
    \ and horizontal value \nchains, digitalization of products and services, and\
    \ the creation of a digital business model and \ncustomer relationships (Guban\
    \ & Kovacs, 2017: 113). \nThe application of developing technology in agriculture\
    \ was not delayed. The data \nobtained from the sensors can be analyzed with artificial\
    \ intelligence and deep learning \nKIRKAYA / Smart Farming- Precision Agriculture\
    \ Technologies \nJournal of Scientific Perspectives, Volume:4, Issue:2, Year:2020\
    \ \n127 \nmethods, and crop protection and nutrition programs can be made. Suggestions\
    \ made with \ndecision support platforms have started to be adopted by the farmer.\
    \ Pesticides, herbicides, \nfertilizers and water can be applied autonomously\
    \ by the smart agricultural machine or drones \nonly to the area where the stressed\
    \ plant is located instead of the whole area. \nAgriculture 4.0; Data collection\
    \ methods have been developed with remote sensing, \nimage processing, GPS technology,\
    \ IoT technologies with sensors. These smart devices and \nrobotic systems and\
    \ precision agriculture make farms more profitable, productive, safe and \nenvironmentally\
    \ friendly. \n4. SMART AGRICULTURE TECHNOLOGIES \nFactors that cannot be controlled\
    \ by the impact of climate change increase the loss of \non-farm food in agricultural\
    \ production. Common causes of losses include restrictions on the \nuse of resources\
    \ in production practices, improper harvesting techniques, and post-harvest \n\
    handling and storage. Traditional production methods of farmer cannot provide\
    \ professional \nmonitoring of plant growth.  \nRegarding the future of agriculture,\
    \ a number of adjustment measures should be taken \nregarding agricultural practices\
    \ such as sowing, harvesting and irrigation, fertilization of \nexisting plants,\
    \ seed selection, use of different varieties, diversification of crops and innovative\
    \ \nmanagement practices. In digital monitoring methods data collected from channels\
    \ such as \nsatellite images, ground-based optical sensors, aerial imagery are\
    \ stored systematically and \nlocation-based. The interrelation of the data can\
    \ be analyzed using various algorithms and \nready-to-use information can be transmitted\
    \ by mobile phones within seconds. Digital \ntechnologies that entered our lives\
    \ with Industry 4.0 serve as intermediaries that provide data \nto decision support\
    \ platforms. \nThe Internet of Things (IoT): It is an internet-based network system\
    \ where smart \ndevices that communicate with each other by sensors can activate\
    \ some operations using this \ninformation. IoT is quickly accepted in many industries\
    \ when combined with other technologies \ndue to its real-time, highly sensitive\
    \ digital information flow and its benefits in process and \nservice management.\
    \ It is considered that 20 billion devices in many areas such as smart houses,\
    \ \ncities, energy systems, communication, logistics, agriculture, health, industry\
    \ are connected \nwith IoT technology. It is thought to be combined with blockchain\
    \ technology against security \nproblems. \nGIS (Geographical Information Systems)\
    \ : GIS is described as systems of data that \nmanaged based on locations. With\
    \ GIS that which includes location-based data collection, \nmanagement and analysis;\
    \ lots of data could related easily and provide a more in-depth \nperspective\
    \ and insights by maps that visualized data. \nArtificial intelligence (AI): Artificial\
    \ intelligence has many definitions, it basically \ndefines a simulation system\
    \ designed by human and mimicking mind actions. It consists of \nteaching the\
    \ system with various algorithms, providing a kind of reasoning ability and \n\
    increasing the reliability of the output by using the comparison data by continuously\
    \ feeding \nthe system with an integrated approach. Although the limits of human\
    \ intelligence are unknown, \nit needs machine support in multiple, complex and\
    \ large amount of data processing, and it can \nuse the technology and information\

    \ AND MATERIALS \n5.1. Methodology \nWidespread wheat varieties produced in Thrace\
    \ region, were monitored by remote \nsensing in approximately 500 hectares in\
    \ 3 different regions from planting to harvest during the \nstages of growth and\
    \ development. The captured images were processed, image analyzes were \nperformed\
    \ and classified.  \n5.2. Materials and other requirements \n• Unmanned Aerial\
    \ vehicles; DJI, 2 units (UAV 0 and UAV 1) within the framework \nof the regulations\
    \ and permits of the General Directorate of Civil Aviation, are used \nwith the\
    \ appropriate pilot license. \n• Cameras and devices; 4 cameras (multispectral,\
    \ thermal) and spectroradiometers \nwere used.  \n• Geographic Information System\
    \ based decision support platform and various \nspecific software \n5.3. Remote\
    \ sensing and image processing  \nIt is possible to obtain information about the\
    \ development and health of plants by \nlooking at the reflection values at various\
    \ wavelengths. Images are captured under optimum \nsunlight condition and flight\
    \ level using a UAV equipped with a spectral camera.  \nOne of the aims of this\
    \ research is to determine the unhealthy plant area using spectral \nimages obtained\
    \ from drones and provide detailed information about the health of the crop, the\
    \ \narea covered by the stressed crop and its geographical location. \nIn this\
    \ study, a combination of spectral vegetation index techniques was used to produce\
    \ \na comprehensive solution for precision agriculture using image processing.\

    \ of the wheat plant was made and the \nspectral library archive started to be\
    \ created. Parameters affecting plant growth have been added \nto the location-based\
    \ database and an information store has been created for analysis to be \nconducted\
    \ with deep learning techniques and artificial intelligence support. \nPractises\
    \ are ongoing to create a spectral library of other crops that are grown in different\
    \ \nclimatic conditions of the country. The research is deepened by establishing\
    \ an infrastructure \nto monitor the changes in the biochemical structure of plants\
    \ under controlled conditions by \nspectral analysis.  \nDespite the borders of\
    \ the countries, the world's natural resources are used by all living \nthings.\
    \ Optimum use of resources is required for the sustainability of new generations.\
    \ In the \nabove study, it is clearly seen that the developing technology provides\
    \ an advantage in the \nagricultural sector.  Its use should be expanded immediately.\
    \  \nTurkey has a unique geographical location. The farming and grain production\
    \ of the \nworld began in Turkey. The world's first agricultural community lived\
    \ in Gobeklitepe 12,000 \nyears ago. For this reason, it is essential to implement\
    \ and pioneer technological development \nin agriculture.  \nOne of the most important\
    \ warnings to be considered in the COVID-19 pandemic is that \ninvestment and\
    \ development in the agricultural sector is a priority. Similarly, it is clear\
    \ that \nblockchain-like technology infrastructure studies should be added to\
    \ food safety policies for \npossible foodborne outbreaks. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\

    \ digital technology, it focuses an opportunity that \ncould change the environment\
    \ in the way human think and work. The farms and factories \nmust implement smart\
    \ technology to move very fast and it should be an innovative \napplications to\
    \ embrace the fourth industrial revolution robustly for Bangladesh. The \nfourth\
    \ industrial revolution concept combines artificial intelligence and big data\
    \ that have \nachieved significant attention and popularity in precision farming\
    \ like in monitoring, \ndiagnosing insect pests, measuring soil moisture, diagnosing\

    \ offers benefits such as \nmaximize production volume and minimize \nthe risk\
    \ of failure. In industry, the first \nindustrial revolution was started in 1780\
    \ which \nrepresented the manufacturing movement of \ntextiles processes with\
    \ the introduction of \nmechanical production plants used by liquid \nwater or\
    \ steam. It automated manufacturing \nof textiles and movement of production from\
    \ \nhomes to factories. Steam power and the \ncotton gin are an important objects\
    \ in this \nperiod. Thirty years later, the second industrial \nrevolution was\
    \ initiated which opened the era \nof mass production. Late 1960s third industrial\
    \ \nrevolution was introduced. From that moment \non, it was possible to automate\
    \ production \nusing electronics and information technology \n(IT). The fourth\
    \ industrial revolution had \nopened in 2011 in Germany which  focused \ncomputerization\
    \ and an innovative production \nconcept (Sung, 2014).\nThe fourth industrial\
    \ revolution could not \nonly suggest how to overcome the previous \nproblems\
    \ but also furnish the foundation for \nthe production development adopting new\
    \ \nforms in working applications frame for \nfarming 4.0. Industry 4.0 brings\
    \ a concept \n116 \nAgriculture in the Fourth Industrial Revolution\n“collective”\
    \ and “value chain” (Toanalyz, \n2018). To make autonomously connection \nof computer\
    \ based algorithm for open field \nagriculture, industry 4.0 builds intelligent\
    \ \nnetworks among machines, work and systems \nin general through creating the\
    \ entire value \nchain with the help of Internet of Things \n(IoT) which can control\
    \ themselves and each \nother (Lasi et al., 2015; Xu, 2012; Hofmann, \n2017; Ferracane,\
    \ 2015). Industry revolution is \nshown in Fig 1.\nThe IoT leads 4IR in agricultural\
    \ sector while \ndevice status can change dynamically under \nthe environmental\
    \ condition and devices \ncan operate the next function based on the \ninput parameter\
    \ is instructed by the farmers \n(Zambon et al., 2019).A survey report states\
    \ \nthat, food demand is continuously growing, \nwe will have to produce 70 percent\
    \ more \nfood grain by next 30 years (Clercq et al., \n2018). Hence we should\
    \ use new advanced \ntechnology to grow more food grain.\nThe world changes by\
    \ the advanced applications \nof technology (Maddox, 2018). It described the \n\
    applications of agriculture 4.0 which changes \nthe business of farming. A digital\
    \ farming is \nmore productive and sustainable than the output \nof past. To grow\
    \ more production the smart \nagricultural technology has no alternative. \nThis\
    \ paper illustrates the 4IR effects in short \non agriculture and analyzes its\
    \ impact on \nagricultural productivity, profitable application \nthrough large-scale\
    \ farming concepts, robotic \napplications in agricultural farms.\nFig. 1.  \n\

    117\nEffects of 4IR on agriculture\nTraditional agricultural system cannot satisfy\
    \ \nthe growing demand of food needs without the \nproductive support of innovative\
    \ technological \nefficiency. Promoting 4IR effects in agriculture, \nfirst of\
    \ all a convenient environment is \nneeded to build up which is safe in rural\
    \ life \nand environment that provides a space for \ncyber technology and cloud\
    \ infrastructures. \nA smart farming culture is specified through \n4IR and it\
    \ allows agricultural site to enhance \nproductivity in competitive way. 4IR applies\
    \ \nagricultural robotics technology that has \nbeneficial outcome for promoting\
    \ advanced \nagricultural system reducing labor costs \nand increasing quality\
    \ (Duckett, 2018). 4IR \nin agriculture suppose to include artificial \nintelligence,\
    \ robotics technology and human \nworkers then the smart farming outcome will\
    \ \nbe exponentially improved.\nThe \nrobotis \nused \nfor \nadvanced \nagricultural\
    \ applications such as pruning, \nweeding, spraying and monitoring. At \nthe harvesting\
    \ phase “harvesting robots” \nare used in order to expand food harvest \nefficiency.\
    \ The development of robotic \ninnovations is more achievable. There is a \n“vegetable-picking\
    \ robot” which can be used \nfor harvesting vegetables specifically. Robotic \n\
    technology will operate in every area of the \nagricultural process such as weed\
    \ control, \nplanting seeds, harvesting, environmental \nmonitoring and soil analysis.\
    \ Therefore, \nrobotic application has influential impact in \nadvanced aricultural\
    \ production.\nFarmers will not be required to work on \nphysically to perform\
    \ any kind of actions. A \nrobot can do with the given human commands \nand programs\
    \ embedded on it. Interest in \nprecision agriculture is now demanding \ncriteria\
    \ on future agricultural development \nwhich minimize environmental pollution\
    \ \nby using harmful pesticides, fertilizers and \nmaximize the agricultural production.\
    \ Field \nRobots used in agriculture applications is \nshown in Fig 2, that demonstrates\
    \ an image \nwhile tomatoes are collected by the farmers \nthat’s followed the\
    \ traditional way. However, \nby applying robotic arms farmers can pick \nup fruits\
    \ quick and efficient way without \ndamaging any tomato. Programming could be\
    \ \nset by instructions which accepts and makes \nrapid action based on real time\
    \ information.\nInfluence of 4IR on the rural environment \nThe 4IR makes a transition\
    \ period for \ndeveloping countries where small farmers \nhave to be concerned\
    \ in a particularly \nproducing food and raw materials for the \nurban economy.\
    \ But in rural farmers most \nof them gets a drawbacks when come into \ncontacting\
    \ with buyers, suppliers of inputs \nand bankers. The 4IR has brought a vast \n\
    change in manufacturing, distributing and \nconsuming for the rural environment\
    \ and life. \nExisting technology with technical support \nacts as skilled part\
    \ to overcome difficult \nproblems. Internet, web and online sites are \nfree\
    \ access in through the farmers are getting \nbenefits in their field application,\
    \ the farmers \nget all the update open fields information \nusing mobile phone\
    \ and the devices are \nconnected IoT devices and cloud computing. \nIoT-based\
    \ smart farming systems provide \nthe rural farmers to get  instant access of\
    \ \nmonitoring the light, temperature, humidity \nand soil moisture at fields\
    \ using connected \nsensors with no time interval.\n118 \nAgriculture in the Fourth\
    \ Industrial Revolution\nAgricultural consumption and product \ndistribution\n\
    Product distribution has a set of rules involved \nin making a product or service\
    \ available for \nuse or consumption so that it makes ensured \ndirectly and indirectly\
    \ goods are available to \nclients. Bangladeshi farmers living in rural \narea\
    \ may be far from direct touching from \ncustomers. In majority cases the farmers\
    \ are \ndoing farm business and there is intermediate \nstakeholder in between\
    \ customers and farmers.\nThat causes a gap in agricultural business. \nThe all\
    \ sectors participation is going to be \nhelpful for better production and consumption\
    \ \nboth. 4IR can cut off the gap by creating a \nknowledge bridge between the\
    \ farmers and \nmake the production services available to the \nfield workers.\n\
    It provides a clear information details in front \nof the clients who are directly\
    \ involved in \nconsumption and production. Real time data \nis demanded to choose\
    \ the best one from huge \nproduction. \nFirst to recent revolution has shown\
    \ a policy \nwhile self-sufficiency is considered as first \nindustrial \nrevolution,\
    \ \nsecond \nindustrial \nrevolution is for development in processing \nand storage\
    \ technologies and third industrial \nrevolution reviewed quantity to quality.\

    \ based \nagricultural production, crops distribution \ninformation \nis \nfetched\
    \ \nand \nanalyzed \nin computerized way by applying 4IR \ntechnology. There is\
    \ a great possibility for \ncustomized production through optimizing \nsupply\
    \ and demand chain that can adjust time \nand output in order to keep stabilized\
    \ prices \nnormal in market (Imam et al., 2014).\nIncrease agricultural productivity\n\
    To increase agricultural productivity the modern \ntechnology skills can play\
    \ very essential role \nin few ways such astransportation facilities, \nirrigation\
    \ \nfacilities, \ninstitutional \ncredit, \nproper marketing facilities, supply\
    \ of quality \ninputs,consolidation of holdings, agricultural \neducation,land\
    \ reforms, co-operative farming, \nreduction of population on land, provision\
    \ of \nbetter manure seeds etc. Villagers are linked \nwith marketing which in\
    \ turns achieve the \nfarmer’s interest with better farm technology \nand sufficient\
    \ profit.Quality of input, control \nfield measurements and better irrigation\
    \ \nfacilities helps to increase productivity.\nMarketing \ninfrastructure \n\
    and \nproper \narrangements scope for better selling should \nbe strengthened\
    \ prices. Supplying quality \ninputs, controlling market prices should be \ncheck\
    \ out at right time. To save the farmers \nfrom the clutches of moneylenders,\
    \ adequate \ncredit facilities, rural credit scheme and loan \nfacility at low\
    \ interest must be available to the \nsmall farmers.\nTo enhance crop productivity,\
    \ the farmers \nneed for agricultural education that guides \nthe rural farmers\
    \ about newly invented \nagricultural tools and its associated technical \nsupport.\
    \ Proper crop caring may take another \nrole for better crop production. A large\
    \ part \nof our population is dependent on land and \ncauses fragmentation, it\
    \ creates a harmful \neffect for crop productivity. It immediately \nis needed\
    \ population reduction on land. For \nbetter productivity insecticides and pesticides\
    \ \nshould be supplied properly at the low rates \nall over the country side.\
    \ Modern technology \nleads to big farming which is called as co-\noperative farming.\
    \ Now agriculture will \nbecome profitable area through large-scale \nfarming\
    \ concepts.\nIn this paper, we propose an approachesthat \ncan be taken asmedium\
    \ ofbetter agricultural \nproduction in Bangladesh. Many factors \nassociated\
    \ tobetter and technical way for \nproduction, 4IR can make a farmer concerned\
    \ \nabout better crop production and provides an \neasy access to information,product\
    \ selling in \nactual price market and enhance the production \nin co-operative\
    \ farming. Afterwards farmers \nwould be connected to direct market and keep \n\
    them involved inbig agribusiness.\nResponse of 4IR in Bangladesh\nIn Bangladesh,\
    \ since history of industrialization \nusing 2nd or 1st IR technologies established\
    \ \nfew SME clusters. These old fashioned SME \nclusters performing very poor\
    \ and it makes \nunable to cope with the modern technologies. \nAn example can\
    \ be picked up like importing \ncoconut oil gets uncompetitive market in \nour\
    \ country (Aninias, 2018). The local \nentrepreneurs get them inability to produce\
    \ \ncoconut oil as much as imported oil because \nthey don’t know the appropriate\
    \ refining \ntechnology and its application so hence these \npoor technology used\
    \ in local production farm \nis supposed to be exterminated.\n120 \nAgriculture\
    \ in the Fourth Industrial Revolution\nIndustrial \nrevolution \nwill \ndestroy\
    \ \njob \nopprotunity in many sectors as a predition \nwhich has reported in survey\
    \ but open thousand \njobs in different skilled sectors. In Bangladesh \ntop demanding\
    \ technology are designing like \nsmart phones, biometric sensors, GPS system,\
    \ \nwifi and social media. By using applications, \nthe human power is shifting\
    \ technological \nbased algorithm performance. Industries \nare growing automated.\
    \ In Bangladesh \ndevelopment \nplanning \nfor \nsustainable \neconomic cycle\
    \ while fourth industrial \nrevolution undoubtly is necessary. As the \nconsequences\
    \ of industrial revolution poor \nskilled manpower will be disappered still \n\
    there,  human have accessibility in choice for \ndesigning technology to make\
    \ more productive \nsystem in technology oriented environment.    \nDigitizing\
    \ agriculture farm management \nin collaboration with 4IR will bring a vast \n\
    progressive change that expands product \ntraceability and sustainability of smallholder\
    \ \nfarmers \nin \nBangladesh. \nKnowledge \ndevelopment policy for new entrepreneurship\
    \ \nis not expectedly progressing in our country. \nThe \nnew \nand \npotential\
    \ \nentrepreneurs \nshould have appropriate information about \nproduction as\
    \ well as relevant mechanism \nto produce selected products. The number \nof entrepreneurs\
    \ should be increased for \npotential entrepreneurship functional output. \nGovernment\
    \ and scholars who are talking \nabout 4IR and holding seminars, conferences,\
    \ \ndiscussion forum in the media may play a \nvital and effective role at entrepreneurship\
    \ \nenrollment in business that may provide \nknowledge \nfor \nentrepreneur \n\
    to \napply \nappropriate technologies in respective fields. \nWe should come forward\
    \ to make a rapidly \nchange in transition of 1st IR technologies \ninto 2nd or\
    \ 3rd IR technology and then it will \nmake knowledgeable and expert system for\
    \ \nachievement of 4IR outcomes in agriculture. \nImportance of robotics in agriculture\n\
    Graphical views are presented to compare and \nanalysis the importance of using\
    \ the robotic \napplication in agriculture. Results depicts \nthe sales rating\
    \ of robots from previous to \nfollowing years and later how gradually the \n\
    number of agricultural robots have been \nincreased through the Fig. 3 and Fig.\
    \ 4. \nFrom the graph (Fig. 3) illustrates worldwide \nindustrial robot shipments\
    \ increased by \npercent from 97,000 in 2004 to around 384,000 \nin 2018 (Source:\
    \ Global agricultural robot \nrevenue) and the graph (Fig. 4) shows the \nagricultural\
    \ robot revenues between 2015 to \n2024 (www.statista.com).The figures delineate\
    \ \nthe number of selling robots and the revenues \nfrom agricultural robots within\
    \ years to years. \nThere is the period between 2004 to 2009 \nexperienced a steady\
    \ fluctuation from 97 to 60 \n(in 1,000 units)shipments of industrial robots \n\
    in worldwide. For the period 2010-2018 it was \nsurged from 166 to 384 (in 1,000\
    \ units).While \nin year 2017 to 2018 the robotic shipments \nwas accumulated\
    \ from 384 to around 382(in \n1,000 units).It is obvious that sales of robot \n\
    in industry has increased considerably for \nthe following years and the revenues\
    \ of the \nagricultural robot market worldwide is seen \nin following fig.4 from\

    \ more industrialized and intensive due to the rising demand for food in quality\
    \ and quantity. Agricultural\nmodernization will be made possible by the Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT), a technology with a great promise for revolutionizing the\n\
    industry. Agricultural products will be in high demand by 2050 due to a 30% increase\
    \ in the global population, so there is a\nneed to devise new mechanisms for agriculture,\
    \ and smart agriculture is one of those mechanisms; however, smart agriculture\n\
    needs to be explored further to realize its potential fully. So, to explore the\
    \ potential of this ﬁeld, the researchers have used a\ncorpus that is extracted\
    \ from the Scopus database from the year 2008 to the year 2022 and applied the\
    \ LDA technique. A\ncorpus of 4309 articles was selected from the Scopus database\
    \ to apply the latent Dirichlet analysis (LDA) model to predict\nresearch areas\
    \ for smart agriculture. Using IoT technology, farmers and producers may better\
    \ manage their resources, such as\nfertilizer consumption and the number of trips\
    \ made by farm vehicles, while minimizing waste and maximizing productivity,\n\
    including water, electricity, and other inputs. This data-driven experimental\
    \ study identiﬁes smart agriculture research trends\nby implementing a topic modeling\
    \ technique previously used in smart agriculture. The authors have created seventeen\
    \ research\nthemes in smart agriculture based on the LDA topic modeling. This\
    \ analysis suggests that the indicated areas are in the growth\nphase and require\
    \ further research and exploration.\n1. Introduction\nDigital technologies like\
    \ the Internet of Things (IoT) are\nreshaping agriculture. When it comes to farming,\
    \ what is\nIoT? The IoT connects “dumb” devices. IoT is all about data\n[1]. Data\
    \ is becoming a valuable resource for our world.\nFarmers may become more intelligent\
    \ and safe by using data\nfrom gadgets to adapt to changing conditions more readily\n\
    and farm more eﬃciently [2]. To free up resources, farmers\ncan use the ability\
    \ to monitor agricultural conditions and\ninfrastructure from afar [3]. Many sectors\
    \ and industries\nhave adopted IoT to reduce errors and improve performance\n\
    in manufacturing, energy, health care, and communication\n[1]. Farm devices can\
    \ collect and deliver data remotely to\ntheir owners using IoT.\nFarmers can save\
    \ time and money using IoT to keep tabs\non-farm operations and eﬃciency, make\
    \ more informed deci-\nsions about boosting productivity, and respond more quickly\n\
    to changing conditions. In this case, it is putting data ahead\nof the farmer’s\
    \ intuition [2]. A trough’s water supply, the\namount of fertilizer to use on\
    \ a crop, and which ewe to check\nwhen lambing are all things a farmer could know\
    \ about.\nSmart agriculture is necessary since 70% of the farming\ntime is spent\
    \ monitoring and analyzing crop status rather\nthan performing actual ﬁeld labor\
    \ [3]. Given the industry’s\nsize, it needs various technology and precise solutions\
    \ to\nensure sustainability while reducing environmental damage.\nSensors and\
    \ communication technologies have provided\nfarmers with a remote sight of their\
    \ ﬁelds, allowing them\nto watch what is happening without leaving home. Wireless\n\
    sensors make monitoring crops in real-time with greater\nprecision and, more importantly,\
    \ detecting the early stages\nof undesirable conditions easier [4]. This is why\
    \ “smart agri-\nculture uses innovative equipment and kits from seeding to\nHindawi\n\
    Journal of Sensors\nVolume 2022, Article ID 5442865, 19 pages\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2022/5442865\n\
    crop harvesting, storage, and transportation. The operation is\nsmart and cost-eﬀective\
    \ due to its accurate monitoring capa-\nbilities and prompts reporting using a\
    \ variety of sensors. Var-\nious autonomous tractors, harvesters, robotic weeders,\
    \ drones,\nand satellites supplement agriculture equipment [5]. Sensors\ncan be\
    \ instantly deployed, started collecting data, and made\navailable for further\
    \ online study. By enabling precise data col-\nlection at each area, sensor technology\
    \ allows crop and site-\nspeciﬁc agriculture”. IoT and its apps are only scratching\
    \ the\nsurface of what they can do and have yet to impact people’s\nlives signiﬁcantly,\
    \ and everyone can see this. However, given\nthe recent rise in IoT technology\
    \ in agricultural applications,\nwe can expect it to play a signiﬁcant role. Figure\
    \ 1 summarizes\nthe key factors driving agricultural technology.\nThere are reasonable\
    \ eﬀorts to emphasize the importance\nof IoT in agriculture; most published work\
    \ [6] focuses solely\non applications. However, in light of the most recent facts\n\
    and data, most current publications either give little insight\nor place a limited\
    \ emphasis on diverse IoT-based designs, pro-\ntotypes, advanced approaches, IoT\
    \ for food quality, and other\nfuture issues. The current state of IoT-based agriculture\n\
    research is examined in this paper. Farmers are either delaying\nor refusing to\
    \ change their traditional techniques, which might\nfurther depress India’s GDP.\
    \ Recently skilled migrants from\nall across India who returned to their homelands\
    \ during the\nCOVID-19 pandemic selected farming as a profession and\nhad no plans\
    \ to return. These migrants may move closer to\nsmart agricultural systems since\
    \ it takes less time to persuade\nthem to use them than traditional farmers.\n\
    (i) Remote monitoring of agricultural infrastructure\nand conditions can save\
    \ farmers time and labor by\nreducing the frequency of on-site ﬁeld inspections\n\
    (ii) Farmers beneﬁt from data analysis\n(iii) Gaining insights from real-time\
    \ data throughout a\nvalue chain allows farmers to respond faster to\nmarket requests\n\
    (iv) The food manufacturing process should improve\neﬃciency to lower food waste,\
    \ speed up the time\nto market, and improve traceability. This will allow\nus\
    \ to demonstrate to our consumers that our food is\nsafe and sustainable\n(v)\
    \ Research, development, and adaptation to new\ntechnologies ensure continued\
    \ productivity and\ninnovation\nThe ﬁrst objective of this study is to do a meta-analysis\n\
    of the collected corpus. The second objective is to forecast\nthe present research\
    \ areas and trends as 2, 5, and 10 topics,\nas highlighted in Table 1. The third\
    \ objective is to examine\nin-depth the current research trends to assist future\n\
    researchers in determining the correct research directions\nin the ﬁeld of smart\
    \ agriculture.\n2. Review of Literature\nIoT is revolutionizing agriculture by\
    \ bringing together vari-\nous approaches, such as accuracy and conservative farming,\n\
    to help farmers overcome obstacles in the ﬁeld. Jayaraman\net al. [7] discussed\
    \ using IoT, cloud computing, mobile\ncomputing, and smart agriculture to develop\
    \ a “phononet”\nsystem, an open system of wireless sensors that share infor-\n\
    mation and communicate. For many years, devices presently\nlabeled as IoT have\
    \ been deployed in agriculture. The Bosch\ntechnology corporation provides IoT-based\
    \ data manage-\nment strategies to monitor agricultural yield and diseases\n[8].\

    \ [9]. As part of the MIT Media\nLab Open Agriculture Initiative, Google has shared\
    \ its vision\nfor a more sustainable food system [10]. For eﬃcient seed\nplanting,\
    \ “sensors and vision-based technology” help deter-\nmine the distance and depth.\
    \ An autonomous robot named\nAgribot is being developed to sow seeds using sensors\
    \ and\na vision-based [11]. Technology and economic sustainability\ngo hand in\
    \ hand. A study was conducted in Pakistan to\ndetermine the commercial viability\
    \ of a proposed crop\ninsurance plan and assess the demand for crop insurance\n\
    in various ﬂood-prone rural districts of Khyber Pakh-\ntunkhwa Province [12].\
    \ Additional research revealed that\nfarm households in the study area faced several\
    \ barriers\nto adapting to climate variability, including a lack of labor,\nan\
    \ insecure land tenure system, a lack of market access,\npoverty, a lack of governmental\
    \ support, a lack of access\nto assets, a lack of water sources, a lack of credit\
    \ sources,\nand a lack of knowledge and information [13]. One study\nfound a link\
    \ between poverty reduction and natural and\nsocial capital for sustainable livelihood.\
    \ The research\nprovides empirical and quantitative evidence on poverty\nalleviation,\
    \ and the conclusions will improve agricultural\nhouseholds’ sustainability [14].\
    \ A study also uses natural\nand agricultural resources in Northwestern Pakistan\
    \ to\ncreate a livelihood vulnerability index (LVI), LVI-IPCC,\nand livelihood\
    \ eﬀect index [15].\nFurther, several noncontact sensing methods for deter-\n\
    mining the seed ﬂow rate are proposed in [16], “where the\nsensors were equipped\
    \ with LEDs, infrared, visible light,\nlaser-LED, and a radiation reception element”.\
    \ The output\nvoltage ﬂuctuates depending on how the seeds move through\nthe sensor\
    \ and band of light rays and how the shades fall on\nthe reception parts [17].\
    \ Therefore, the seed ﬂow rate is cal-\nculated based on the signal information\
    \ about the passing\nseeds. Researchers oﬀer an expert system for evaluating the\n\
    viability of agricultural land in a 2019 study by combining\nsensor networks with\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence systems such as\nneural networks and multilayer perceptron\
    \ [18]. The pro-\nposed method is intended to assist farmers in categorizing\n\
    agricultural land for cultivation into the most suitable, suit-\nable, somewhat\
    \ suitable, and unsuitable categories. In a\nrecent study, researchers used citrus\
    \ fruits data labeled by a\ndomain expert with four severity levels (high, medium,\n\
    low, and healthy) to train a deep neural network (DNN)\nmodel to detect disease\
    \ by severity [19]. The model has a\n98% likelihood of predicting low severity\
    \ and a 98% chance\nof predicting high seriousness. In a subsequent study, the\n\
    author takes advantage of blockchain’s potential beneﬁts,\ncombines it with SDN,\
    \ and provides justiﬁcation for worries\nabout energy consumption and security\
    \ [20]. In the most\nrecent survey, authors applied the same blockchain technology\n\
    integration technology to diﬀerent platforms. LDA was used\nto anticipate blockchain\
    \ research trends. The researchers have\npredicted 17 scientiﬁc trends that deserve\
    \ more attention.\nAccording to the literature, LDA approaches anticipate smart\n\
    agriculture research trends [21]. The researcher created a\nnovel routing protocol\
    \ for IoT networks with a cluster topol-\nogy using a blockchain-based architecture\
    \ for the SDN con-\ntroller. The research concepts of the existing state of the\
    \ art\nand its diﬀerentiation from the current state are represented\nin Table\
    \ 2.\n3. Topic Modeling\nData mining is an emerging ﬁeld to extract data from\n\
    unstructured formats. Topic modeling is a powerful tech-\nnique in text mining\
    \ in natural language processing to\nexplore the relationship between the data\
    \ and collected doc-\numents [22]. This technique is used by various researchers\
    \ in\ntheir native ﬁelds, like medical, semantic analysis [23], and\nengineering\
    \ [24], to conclude the relationship between the\ndocuments and topics. Techniques\
    \ like latent Dirichlet allo-\ncation (LDA), nonnegative matrix factorization\
    \ (NMF),\nlatent semantic analysis (LSA), parallel latent Dirichlet allo-\ncation\
    \ (PLDA), and Pachinko allocation model (PAM) were\nused in the topic modeling;\
    \ among all, LDA is intensively\nused by researchers. The topic modeling technique\
    \ is similar\nto the dimensionality reduction technique used for numeri-\ncal\
    \ data. A bag of words (BOW) is created from the dictio-\nnary of words, and topic\
    \ modeling extracts the required\nfeatures from this BOW. The words contained\
    \ in the corpus\nare viewed as a signiﬁcant feature in NLP.\nNLP considers each\
    \ word as a feature to train the model.\nThis technique helps us ﬁnd the right\
    \ content instead of ana-\nlyzing the accurate data. LDA is used to attain a relationship\n\
    among the documents in the collected dataset, and results\nTable 1: Continued.\n\

    \ graphically. To develop\nLDA, variational exception maximization (VEM) algorithm\n\
    [25] is used to estimate the similarities from the corpus.\nUsually, the top few\
    \ words are picked up from the BOW\nas this approach lacks semantics in the sentence.\
    \ LDA fol-\nlows the concept of probabilistic distribution, so each docu-\nment\
    \ in the corpus portrays the probabilistic distribution of\ntopics, and each extracted\
    \ topic depicts the probabilistic dis-\ntribution of words. It led to concluding\
    \ a clear vision of the\ntopic connection. LDA is applied to retrieve critical\
    \ informa-\ntion or analysis from unstructured data. For example,\nresearch on\
    \ social media makes users understandable reac-\ntions and conversations among\
    \ the people connected in\nsocial media to conclude the patterns [26].\n4. Methodology\n\
    The stepwise procedure of whatever tasks have been com-\npleted is aﬀectingly\

    \ Corpus. The primary sources of data collection and for-\nmation of the research\
    \ corpus were the various online digital\nlibraries, journals, and conference\
    \ proceedings available to\nusers through Google Scholar. The search keywords\
    \ for dig-\nital libraries have been selected based on topic selection. The\n\
    research works of Sehra et al. [27] have inﬂuenced them to\nexperiment. The search\
    \ phrases identiﬁed were “IoT agricul-\nture”. Scopus is considered the most extensive\
    \ database for\npublished articles globally. The string is run on the Scopus\n\
    platform, and 4803 articles were extracted from the Scopus\ndatabase. The speciﬁc\

    5\nJournal of Sensors\nFurther processing required inclusion and exclusion cri-\n\
    teria to ﬁnalize the corpus, so, for inclusion criteria, we con-\nsidered the\
    \ research papers published in English only. Then,\nthe studies concerning IoT\
    \ agriculture were only considered.\nUnder the exclusion procedure, we excluded\
    \ and removed\nthose studies published in diﬀerent native languages. In\naddition,\
    \ studies having missing information like author,\nabstract, title, and year were\
    \ excluded from the corpus. After\napplying the requirements, 4309 studies were\
    \ considered for\nthe current research. Figure 3 represents the year-wise\ngrowth\
    \ in article publication in IoT agriculture. It is clear\nfrom Figure 3 that after\
    \ 2015 there has been tremendous\ngrowth in publications. The leading publication\
    \ is in 2021,\n26.43% of the total corpus; in 2020, 21.95% of an article\nwas\
    \ published. In 2022 as per data, there is 0.07% publica-\ntion, which can be\
    \ increased by the end of the year.\nThis area of research is published in various\
    \ reputed\njournals. Some top-rated journals or dominating journals\nin IoT agriculture\
    \ are shown in Figure 4. Dominating jour-\nnal\nanalysis\nshows\nmaximum\nparticipation\n\
    from\nthe\nAdvances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, which has\n134 articles\
    \ having 0.031%, and this journal belongs to\nSpringer, having H-Index 48 and\
    \ 0.66 as its impact factor.\n4.2. Preprocessing. It is a preliminary step that\
    \ processes the\ndataset or the information collected. The objective of pre-\n\
    processing is to discard the extraneous information inside\nthe information. Preprocessing\
    \ removes unwanted words\nand characters from the accumulated or collected corpus\n\
    and improves the dataset’s quality. As a result, the proﬁle\nof further processing\
    \ becomes more accurate and acceptable.\nIn the collected corpus, the author used\
    \ four types of data for\nLDA modeling: title of the paper, year of publication,\
    \ journal\nof published article, abstract, and keywords of the docu-\nments. Further,\
    \ abstract and keywords are combined under\nthe same column. A sample of the loading\
    \ corpus is shown\nin Table 3.\nThe ﬁrst step to performing on the uploaded corpus\
    \ is to\ntoken the words so that all the abstracts per title are toke-\nnized\
    \ into tokens. The generated tokens are then trans-\nformed into lowercase letters\
    \ for each document. In\ntokenization, the focus is on removing the punctuation\n\
    marks, single characters, and other special characters like\n“;”, “,”, “.”, “/”,\
    \ “\\”, “brackets”, “!”. Further, any equation or\nformula used in the abstract\
    \ was removed. Also, the numer-\nical values were eradicated to get a full-ﬂedge\
    \ textual token\n[28]. Finally, after tokenization, the words which have no\n\
    meaning are removed. The stop words are the commonly\nused words such as “the”,\
    \ “if”, “but”, “a”, or “an”. These\nwords take up space in our corpus and consume\
    \ valuable\nprocessing time. Thus, it becomes crucial to remove these\nstop removals,\
    \ and here in our experimentation, we have\nused Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK).\
    \ This toolkit has\nstop words stored in more than sixteen languages. Here,\n\
    the English-language stop words in the NLTK library and\nother phrases used to\
    \ build the corpus were removed from\nthe corpus [29].\nFurther, stemming is reducing\
    \ a word to its word stem.\nStemming is essential in natural language understanding\n\
    and natural language processing, endeavoring to extract\nthe root or core word\
    \ that is usually appended with the\nEnglish suﬃxes and preﬁxes. It erases all\
    \ the extraneous\nparts in the word and sources out the accurate, meaningful\n\
    word. For example, use is the core word that can be\nextracted by stemming the\
    \ word useless, useful, and uses.\nTo prepare an adequate corpus, words stem from\
    \ their orig-\ninal form using the Snowball stemmer algorithm [30], and\nthe resulting\
    \ base keywords are stored in the cleansed cor-\npus. Finally, the words which\
    \ were previously stemmed need\nto be lemmatized. Lemmatization is when the context\
    \ is con-\nsidered, and stemmed words are converted into more mean-\ningful base\
    \ words or lemmas. This phase targets removing\ninﬂected words and outputs the\
    \ dictionary form of a\nword [31].\n5. Latent Dirichlet Allocation\nLatent Dirichlet\
    \ allocation (LDA) is the most popular tech-\nnique in NLP, so data is fed to\
    \ the LDA model after prepro-\ncessing. Before sending data, bigrams and trigrams\
    \ are\nremoved from the corpus. Two words that occur together\nare named bigrams,\
    \ like human resources, and the three\nwords frequently occurring together in\
    \ the document are\ntermed trigrams, like human resource management. The\nLDA\
    \ model is implemented in python language, where the\ngenism library has been\
    \ used to remove such phrases. Gen-\nism’s phrases model can build and identify\
    \ these bigrams,\ntrigrams, quadgrams, or even n-grams [32]; thus, we can\nremove\
    \ and improve the data cleansing process. It is also\npart of preprocessing, so\
    \ after completing this stage, data is\nsent to the LDA model for further analysis\
    \ [49, 67]. LDA\ntopic modeling is based on three input parameters, one of\nwhich\
    \ is a list of topics, and the other is hyperparameters.\nBefore the distribution\
    \ of a document’s topic content is the\nmagnitude of the Dirichlet. This parameter\
    \ is regarded as\nseveral “pseudowords” equally distributed across the docu-\n\
    ment’s topics, regardless of how the document’s other words\nare assigned to topics.\
    \ β is per-word-weight of Dirichlet\nprior over topic-word distributions. The\
    \ α value for this\nexperiment is taken as 1/T, where T is the desired number\n\
    of topics [33], and the β has been ﬁxed as 0.01 for all topic\nsolutions. For\
    \ identifying two, ﬁve, and ten topic solutions,\nas suggested by [26], the number\
    \ of iterations considered is\n1000. Thus, initializing these parameters becomes\
    \ a concern\nas the values can deﬁne the distribution of high-quality topic\n\
    results. The bag of words (BOW) extracted is initially proc-\nessed in LDA topic\
    \ modeling, where the most frequently and\nleast frequently occurring are removed\
    \ so the corpus can\nbecome absolute. This study removes a word frequency of\n\
    more than 5000 from BOW. The top 20 frequently occurring\nwords from the corpus\
    \ with their frequency are shown in\nFigure 5, as it is clear from the graph that\
    \ the most occurring\nkeyword is the system, use, sensors, internet, agriculture,\
    \ and\nmany more.\nHyperparameters are optimized using Python’s mallet\nlibrary,\
    \ a JAVA-based NLP package. Then, the mallet pack-\nage extracts the desired topics\
    \ by training the model using\nBOW. Unfortunately, no oﬃcial or proven measure\
    \ exists\n6\nJournal of Sensors\nto ﬁnd the optimal number of solutions [27].\
    \ Still, some\nobservational parameters are given by Cao and Arun, which\nhelps\
    \ the researcher decide the optimal number of keys [55,\n68]. Furthermore, the\
    \ choice of the topic solution has been\ninﬂuenced by the heuristics and ﬁndings\
    \ of the studies [55,\n61, 68, 69]. Finally, K-mean clustering algorithms are\
    \ used\nto ﬁnd the optimal number of topics from the BOW.\n6. Topic Labeling\n\
    Once the topics have been extracted with the help of the\nLDA model, each topic\
    \ is labeled manually based on the\nkey terms of each topic. As a result, there\
    \ are 4309 articles\nin the corpus, and out of all documents, the top ﬁve high-\n\
    loading papers and their contribution to the topic are men-\ntioned in Table 1.\n\
    7. Result Analysis\n7.1. Parameters of Topic Solutions. The loadings for two,\
    \ ﬁve,\nand ten topic solutions have been acquired by deploying the\nLDA model\
    \ and are presented in Table 1. The selection of\ntwo, ﬁve, and ten topic solutions\
    \ is based on a coherence\nscore and is inﬂuenced by the previous studies. The\n\

    \ plays an essential role in ﬁnding the seman-\ntic similarity between the key\
    \ terms in the topic, and ideally,\na 0.3 to 0.6 coherence value is considered\
    \ a good score [81].\nIn this study, coherence values achieved are good; for two\n\
    topic solutions, 0.62; for ﬁve topics, 0.58; and for ten topic\nsolutions, 0.52\
    \ coherence value is reached. Therefore, ﬁve\ntopic solutions are considered optimal\
    \ based on coherence\nvalue. The dominance of each topic solution is also sup-\n\
    ported by the corresponding count of articles it covers.\nTable 4 summarizes the\
    \ count of year-wise publications cor-\nresponding to each topic solution.\nThe\
    \ initial choice of two topics will broadly depict the\ncore research areas that\
    \ have been widely covered by the\nresearchers in the compiled research literature.\
    \ Further, in\nﬁve topic solutions, the researchers have explored the\nresearch\
    \ areas. Therefore, we have depicted in detail the\nresearch areas studied in\
    \ ﬁve topic solutions. Further in the\nhierarchy, the ﬁve topic solutions have\
    \ widened into ten\ntopic solutions, with new areas emerging as the research\n\
    trends in GHRM.\n7.2. Topic Labeling. The core research zones explored and\ndiscovered\
    \ based on the two topic solutions are depicted in\ntopics T-2.1 and T-2.2. Let\
    \ us discuss how this labeling has\nbeen performed. While implementing LDA on\
    \ two topic\nsolutions, the keywords and their loading has been extracted.\nThe\
    \ extraction results of LDA depict the high-loading arti-\ncles per topic and\
    \ the high-loading terms or keywords per\ntopic. The labeling process is based\
    \ on the high-loading key-\nwords that have been collected. Thus, in the table,\
    \ the label-\ning per topic solution corresponds to the terms extracted\nunder\
    \ the heads T-2.1, T-2.2, and so on; it goes for ﬁve\nand ten topic solutions.\n\
    7.2.1. Core Research Area. The two topic solutions present an\nabstract view of\
    \ the literature dataset and divides it into\n“Security and Privacy in Smart Agriculture”\
    \ (T-2.1) and\n“Monitoring and Control System in Agriculture” (T-2.2).\nThese\
    \ two signiﬁcant labels depict the research areas the\nresearchers have extensively\
    \ explored.\n(1) T-2.1: Security and Privacy in Smart Agriculture. Agricul-\n\
    ture has shaped human civilizations since ancient times.\nRapid information and\
    \ communication growth aﬀects agri-\nculture’s structure and operation (ICT) [82].\
    \ Despite\nadvances, hazards may be signiﬁcant, so smart farming must\ngrasp security\
    \ and privacy challenges before contemplating\ncyber attacks. Smart farming uses\
    \ devices, protocols, and\ncomputer ideas to modernize agriculture. Digital farming\n\
    changes everything and creates eﬀective, eﬃcient, sustain-\nable, and open systems\
    \ [83]. Mobile devices, precision\nagronomy, remote sensing, big data, cloud analytics,\
    \ cyber\nsecurity,\nand\nintelligent\nsystems\nsimplify\nagricultural\ntechnology\n\
    integration.\nIncompatibility,\nheterogeneity,\nequipment constraints, processing,\
    \ and data security may\nthreaten smart farming, but recent years have increased\n\
    usage of ICTs in agriculture [84]. Physical risks and con-\ncerns may impede agriculture’s\
    \ deployment, but agriculture\n4.0 will be the new agriculture standard [85].\
    \ Simultaneous\nresearch is also going on in the area to secure smart agricul-\n\
    ture. Technology has added to environmental problems—list\nagriculture’s\nphysical\n\
    threats\nby\ncategory.\nPopulation\nincrease, urbanization, aging, and technical\
    \ developments\nin food production all aﬀect agriculture and farmers. Agri-\n\
    culture’s most signiﬁcant physical hazard is weather [86].\nExternal factors continually\
    \ threaten agriculture. In recent\ndecades, technology has reduced its inﬂuence.\
    \ Agriculture\napps need stable connections, IoT networks, and cloud\ncomputing\n\
    [87].\nExternal\nfactors\ncontinually\nthreaten\nagriculture. In recent decades,\
    \ technology has reduced its\ninﬂuence. Agriculture apps need stable connections,\
    \ IoT net-\nworks, and cloud computing. The sensors can malfunction,\ncausing\
    \ erroneous readings and instructions that could cause\na manufacturing failure.\
    \ Temperature, humidity, obstruc-\ntions, and human presence can impact Lora WAN,\
    \ Zigbee,\nand other agri-wireless networks, causing data loss. Sensors\nand networking\
    \ equipment are usually exposed [88].\n(2) T-2.2 Monitoring and Control System\
    \ in Agriculture. New\ntechniques, technology, and approaches have also helped\
    \ in\nagriculture. 35% of the world’s workforce works in this pro-\nfession. Agriculture\
    \ helps many economies to grow [89]. It\nboosts industrialized nations’ economies.\
    \ India is the second\nlargest country that deals in this profession. Every country\n\
    has practiced agriculture since ancient times. Businesses\nand other areas must\
    \ support agriculture’s tech transforma-\ntion. The future population rise is\
    \ frightening. Mid-20th cen-\ntury population may have surpassed nine billion\
    \ counts, so\nagriculture needs to be strengthened to meet the ﬂooding\nneeds.\
    \ Agricultural engineering challenges include drainage,\nirrigation, crop scheduling,\
    \ and bio-system optimization.\nThe lack of agricultural technology to monitor\

    \ farming data. IoT-based agricultural\nmonitoring system wirelessly communicates\
    \ and dissemi-\nnates the sensor data. Global agriculture uses 70% of avail-\n\
    able fresh water each year to irrigate 17% of the land [91].\nGrowing food requirements\
    \ and global warming reduce irri-\ngated land, a challenge in plague agriculture.\
    \ FAO predicts\nglobal food production must rise by 70% to meet population\nand\
    \ urbanization needs. Modern agriculture uses robotics,\nautomation, and computer\
    \ systems to replace challenging\nhuman jobs, so expanding agriculture needs new\
    \ technolo-\ngies to be included [92]. Future agricultural technology\nincludes\
    \ robotics and machine vision. In addition, popula-\ntion growth will increase\
    \ the demand for resources and\nproducts. “Sustainability” is blended into social,\
    \ economic,\nand technological problems to address environmental con-\nservation\
    \ and economic development, and information and\ncontrol systems will be crucial\
    \ [93].\n7.2.2. Five Topic Solutions: Research Areas\n(1) T-5.1: Intelligent Disease\
    \ Detection Models. India’s econ-\nomy is mainly based on agriculture. Agriculture\
    \ accounts for\n16% of India’s GDP and exports. More than 75% of India’s\npopulation\
    \ depends on agriculture. Healthy, high-quality\nagriculture is essential for\
    \ economic prosperity [94]. Detec-\ntion of plant disease is critical at an early\
    \ stage. Plants can\nbecome ill while growing. Early illness diagnosis is a chal-\n\
    lenge\nin\nagriculture.\nResearchers\nﬁrst\ndemonstrated\ncutting-edge machine\
    \ learning methods for identifying plant\nillnesses [95]. Training parameters\
    \ are used in modern sys-\ntems but require powerful computers or lengthy training\n\
    and prediction durations to work. Convolutional auto\nencoder (CAE) network prediction\
    \ features have been\nreduced while preserving accuracy in this research. Thanks\n\
    to technological advancements, the world’s population of 7\nbillion people can\
    \ be fed [96].\nChanging climates, declining pollinators, and plant dis-\neases\
    \ threaten the ability to produce enough food. Plant dis-\neases endanger the\
    \ livelihoods of smallholder farmers who\ndepend on healthy crops [97]. Despite\
    \ declining yields,\nsmallholder farmers in developing economies provide more\n\
    than 80% agricultural output. Methods for preventing dis-\nease already exist\
    \ [98]. Pesticides have been replaced with\nintegrated pest management (IPM).\
    \ Early diagnosis is essen-\ntial for successful therapy. Agricultural extension\
    \ organiza-\ntions and local plant clinics have long supported disease\ndetection\
    \ thanks to their computer power, high-resolution\ndisplays, and broad accessory\
    \ sets, such as HD cameras.\nSmartphone diagnostics are a ﬁrst-of-its-kind technology.\n\
    5-6 billion mobile phones will be in use by 2020. More than\ntwo-thirds of the\
    \ world’s people now have access to mobile\nbroadband, a 12-fold increase since\
    \ 2007 [99].\n(2) T-5.2: Data Security Challenges in Smart Agriculture.\nTechnology,\
    \ equipment, protocols, and computer paradigms\nare all used to enhance agricultural\
    \ operations in smart agri-\nculture. Big data, artiﬁcial intelligence, the cloud,\
    \ and edge\ncomputing all store and analyze the data in various forms\nof storage\
    \ and archiving. As a relatively new ﬁeld, smart\nagriculture lacks adequate data\
    \ security measures [84].\nFarming’s future relies heavily on the availability\
    \ and quality\nof data, which necessitates the need for security. To maintain\n\
    security in smart agriculture, managing data compatibility,\nresource constraints,\

    \ increase and food production.\nThe success of agriculture depends on productivity,\
    \ era-\nspeciﬁc restrictions, and the advancement of science and\ntechnology.\
    \ A lot may go wrong regarding smart agriculture,\nwhich is still in its infancy.\
    \ In the future, farmers will rely\nheavily on the availability and quality of\
    \ data to help them;\nthus, developing secure and stable systems is critical [101].\n\
    The growth of the agriculture generation is depicted in\nFigure 6, in which agriculture\
    \ 1.0 started in 1784. In the\n20th century, agriculture 2.0 came into existence.\
    \ In 1992\nagriculture 3.0 was started, and in 2018 agriculture 4.0\nif followed.\n\
    Smart agriculture uses IT to increase information per-\nception, quantitative\
    \ decision-making, intelligent control,\nsuitable investment, and personal service\
    \ [102]. In addition,\ncurrent technology boosts agricultural yield and improves\n\
    security and privacy [103]. There are both advantages and\ndisadvantages to using\
    \ automation in smart agriculture.\nComputer-aided farming uses contemporary technology\n\
    and procedures, so in the future, “digital agriculture” will\nbe more productive,\
    \ eﬃcient, sustainable, inclusive, trans-\nparent, and resilient agriculture.\
    \ Many diﬀerent types of\nagricultural technology may be used in conjunction with\n\
    one another to increase eﬃciency and productivity [104].\n(3) T-5.3: Smart Monitoring\
    \ System in Agriculture. Rainfall\nand\ntemperature\nﬂuctuations\nare\nvery\n\
    unpredictable.\nClimate-smart farming is becoming increasingly popular\namong\
    \ Indian farmers. IoT enables smart agriculture. It\nsaves water, fertilizer,\
    \ and agricultural yields. IoT-enabled\nautomated systems and wireless networks\
    \ are expanding\nindustries. Thus, research into integrated sensor technology\n\
    and the usage of IoT networks in agriculture is reaching\nthe level [105].\n(4)\
    \ T-5.4: Production and Supply Chain Management in\nAgriculture. The growth of\
    \ the supply chain and the move-\nment of information are driven by the gathering\
    \ of materials,\nthe transformation of products, and the delivery to end-\nusers.\
    \ Information-driven, “connected supply chains” enable\norganizations to reduce\
    \ inventory and expenditures; increase\nproduct value; extend resources; expedite\
    \ time to market;\nand retain consumers, among other beneﬁts [106]. Supply\nchain\
    \ performance determines how healthy activities are\nlinked to maximizing customer\
    \ value and proﬁtability at\neach process stage—the end-user beneﬁts from an eﬃcient\n\
    supply chain. Several agricultural supply chains in India\nare problematic owing\
    \ to issues in the agriculture industry\n[107]. Many factors aﬀect the agri-food\
    \ supply chain, includ-\ning small and marginal farmers, disjointed supply chains,\
    \ a\nlack of economies of scale, subpar processing, value addition,\nand fewer\
    \ marketing options. Supply chain management is\nexpanding into logistics by creating\
    \ new divisions integrat-\ning manufacturing, procurement, transportation, and\
    \ distri-\nbution [108]. Information ﬂow visibility has increased\nbecause of\
    \ advancements in telecommunications, electronic\ndata interfaces, and other technologies.\
    \ Animals and plants\nare used in agriculture to produce products that beneﬁt\n\
    human health. For example, agribusiness produces textiles\nand paper. Throughout\
    \ the supply chain, the needs of cus-\ntomers are met. Organizations in the agricultural\
    \ supply\nchain, such as cooperatives, distribute produce, fruits, grains,\npulses,\
    \ and products derived from animals [109]—a network\nof businesses that make goods\
    \ and services for the end-user.\nThere are several beneﬁts to establishing a\
    \ supply chain net-\nwork, such as shifting risk and proﬁt from one company to\n\
    another. Quality is ensured by openness and accountability\nin the process. Quality\
    \ is dependent on transparent pro-\ncesses and responsibilities at each stage\
    \ of the process. The\nprice and performance of transfer payments are crucial\
    \ to\nthe success of process chains.\n(5) T-5.5: Cost-Eﬀective Communication System\
    \ in Smart\nAgriculture. Low-cost solutions like crop rotation, green\nmanuring,\
    \ and mulching have cut cultivation expenses while\nsaving soil and water. Legumes,\
    \ weed control, and increased\nagricultural diversity are nonmonetary inputs [101].\
    \ Climate\nchange, global warming, saltwater intrusion, desertiﬁcation,\nand a\
    \ lack of arable land have increased worldwide worries\nabout food safety and\
    \ security. Connectivity-of-Things\napplications require steady internet [110].\
    \ In the Mekong\nDelta and HCMC, climate change threatens food security.\nDrought\
    \ and saltwater intrusion in the South and Central\nHighlands in early 2016 demonstrate\
    \ the vulnerability and\nsusceptibility of unsustainable agriculture. Agriculture\
    \ may\nbe more eﬃcient and safer thanks to a new Farming system.\nVietnam may\
    \ become a smart and sustainable farm by mod-\nernizing, boosting productivity,\
    \ and ensuring quality. Busi-\nnesses in Vietnam have shared their know-how with\n\
    companies in other countries. Another important factor to\nconsider is the safety\
    \ of the food being prepared. When\ndeciding which meals are good for you and\
    \ the environment,\nmost people have no idea where to begin. Concerns about\n\
    food safety have given rise to new ideas like “city farms”\nand “growing your\
    \ veggies at home” [111]. However, the\neconomic sustainability of these models\
    \ must be thoroughly\nexplored. Researchers are currently focusing on developing\n\
    an IoT-enabled agriculture system. Increased productivity,\nquality, and safety\
    \ may be achieved via this method [82].\n7.2.3. Ten Topic Solutions: Research\
    \ Trends\n(1) T-10.1: Greenhouse Monitoring System. Most Indians\nwork in agriculture,\
    \ contributing to the country’s econo-\nmy—agriculture beneﬁts from technological\
    \ advancements.\nHowever, pesticides are used to grow most fruits and vegeta-\n\
    bles since contemporary farming methods cannot keep up\nwith demand. As a result,\
    \ conventional farming practices\ncontend with weather and disease. Although crop\
    \ yields\nmay be increased by altering agricultural practices [112]\nbecause of\
    \ urbanization and land scarcity, farming must be\ndone in greenhouses. Temperature,\
    \ humidity, light, water\ncontent, pH, and wetness are all shown via LEDs in the\n\
    greenhouse. The goal is to create an intelligent greenhouse.\n10\nJournal of Sensors\n\
    Greenhouse temperature and humidity may be adjusted\nautomatically using programmable\
    \ modules and low-cost\nand high-eﬃciency options [113].\nSoil water content,\
    \ light intensity, temperature, and\nhumidity may be adjusted. In greenhouse crop\
    \ production,\nthe appropriate growth conditions must be changed to\nachieve high\
    \ yields, low costs, improved quality, and the\nlowest environmental impact. To\
    \ attain these goals, proper\nheating and ventilation must be maintained. Using\
    \ a green-\nhouse is more dependable, but it is also more diﬃcult [114].\nTemperature\
    \ and timing controls had previously improved\ncrop quality. Many control devices\
    \ and systems lack auto-\nmation and eﬃciency in today’s dynamic and competitive\n\
    environment. A variety of complicated models depict the\ngreenhouse eﬀect. Costs\
    \ increased, plans became more com-\nplex, and more control was required. The\
    \ usage of com-\nputers in greenhouses has increased during the last decade.\n\
    These components are necessary for a control system.\nSophisticated microelectronic\
    \ hybrid circuits boost sensor\nmanufacturing. Advances in product quality and\
    \ depend-\nability enable commercial competitiveness. Each sensor’s\nperformance\
    \ is determined by its calibration and sensing\nprocesses. It will be impossible\
    \ to automate some jobs even\nin the far future. Several American businesses have\
    \ yet to\nautomate fully, maybe due to cost concerns [115].\n(2) T-10.2: Service-Based\
    \ Industry for Smart Agriculture.\nTechnical advancement has been driven by the\
    \ widespread\nuse of IT and its adaptability in satisfying various require-\n\
    ments. Service-based agriculture (SBA) is widely utilized in\nmultiple industries.\
    \ Farming systems that make it easier for\nfarmers to do their work. A large-scale\
    \ service smart agricul-\nture systems link buses to a hotel, hospital, logistics\
    \ center,\nrestaurant, grocery store, or traditional market. With SBA,\nmaterial\
    \ sales partners may easily share information about\ntheir products with one other\
    \ fast. As a result of SBA,\nIndonesia will see an increase in its economy, as\
    \ quoted in\none study. Over time, the importance of information tech-\nnology\
    \ has grown. The production of farms has increased\nthanks to the adoption of\
    \ contemporary technology [116].\nMany\npeople\nare\nfamiliar\nwith\nthe\npredicament\n\
    of\nIndonesian farmers. The signiﬁcance of variables cannot be\noverstated. Farmers\
    \ have a fear of technology. Farmers in\nIndonesia may be able to increase their\
    \ abilities and produce\nfood for the country’s population by utilizing new technologies.\n\
    Brokers are often used to resell the produce of Indone-\nsian farmers. Small-scale\
    \ farmers in Indonesia were hurt by\nbrokers who gambled on the price of agricultural\
    \ goods\n[117]. Prices for components are rising. Broker fraud\ninﬂated market\
    \ values. Brokers save agricultural products,\ngiving the impression that the\
    \ market is oversupplied and\ndriving up the price of food. When chili prices\
    \ climb and\nthere is a shortage, many brokers refuse to buy from\ngrowers. The\
    \ growing cost of food in Indonesia might harm\nthe country’s economy. Farmers\
    \ must be able to sell their\nproducts directly to consumers. The direct distribution\n\
    oﬀers farmers an easy way to market their products. Whole-\nsalers buy agricultural\
    \ goods from farmers at inexpensive\nrates [118]. To get their goods to market,\
    \ farmers must rent\na vehicle. Commodities no longer impact farmers’ earnings\n\
    with a long processing time. Indonesians rely heavily on\ntheir smartphones to\
    \ get information. Technology can help\nfarmers become food wholesalers. Local\
    \ markets and restau-\nrants might be fed using this method by farmers. The\n\
    Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing support agri-\nculture’s food supply\
    \ and distribution systems [119]. Nowa-\ndays, nanotechnology is also used in\
    \ agriculture to improve\nyields and reduce waste.\n(3) T-10.3: Cloud-Based Smart\
    \ Applications in Agriculture.\nSmart farming uses technology to increase production\
    \ and\nimprove product quality. For example, the Internet of\nThings-based smart\

    \ such as removing the need for interval and geo-\nmetric communications eﬃciency.\
    \ High interface automa-\ntion in IoT activities may achieve reduced latency and\n\
    faster processing. This simulator replicates the sting, edge,\nand fog of IoT.\
    \ IoT-based edge computing is more immedi-\nate, cost-eﬀective, and eﬃcient than\
    \ traditional computer\nsystems [121]. In cities, these strategies are ineﬀective.\
    \ Rural\nlocations are where they are most commonly used. Robots\nshould be used\
    \ in agriculture. The ﬁeld is navigated using\nthe GPS on the tractor. Agribusiness\
    \ in the 21st century is\nanything but digital or computerized. Monitoring crops\n\
    and animals with sensors, GPS-enabled tractors, image pro-\ncessing, and machine\
    \ learning is possible. Edge computing\nreduces the amount of noise in the raw\
    \ data it analyses\nwhich can be cleaned using data mining techniques [122].\n\
    On the other hand, Broadband networks are more cum-\nbersome and diﬃcult to standardize.\
    \ After sensors are\ninstalled, data is automatically collected. We can identify\
    \ if\nanimals or birds are active, inactive, unwell, healthy, submis-\nsive, or\
    \ dominant. We may alter their treatment, living cir-\ncumstances, medicine, and\
    \ food to suit their needs [123].\n(4) T-10.4: Energy-Eﬃcient Smart Transmission\
    \ System. An\nintelligent electrical infrastructure that satisﬁes society’s sus-\n\
    tainability and energy eﬃciency demands is called “smart\ninfrastructure” Customers\
    \ and utility providers will beneﬁt\nfrom the smart grid’s ability to monitor\
    \ their energy use bet-\nter and link the power grid with micro-networks. As a\
    \ result,\nthere is a danger to data security and privacy. Economic\ngrowth depends\
    \ on the availability of electricity, which\nboosts productivity and sustains\
    \ quality of life. Global eco-\nnomic development and electricity usage are depleting\
    \ the\nworld’s energy resources [124]. The smart grid’s core\nassumption is to\
    \ minimize resource depletion and promote\neconomic growth through energy eﬃciency\
    \ and manage-\nment technologies. Demand management lowers transmis-\nsion and\
    \ distribution system stress and high-demand\noverhead lines. Several countries\
    \ have used industrial and\ncommercial demand response strategies to boost their\
    \ econ-\nomies. Direct load limiting often reduces peak demand\n[125]. Direct\
    \ load management may result in a decrease in\ncustomer satisfaction—direct load\
    \ management. Consumers\nand utility companies beneﬁt from reduced peak demand\n\
    when loads are shifted. However, the electrical system’s sta-\nbility and dependability\
    \ are compromised during periods of\nhigh energy demand. The smart grid and load\
    \ modeling\nneed to limit peak energy use.\nTrouble ensues when demand exceeds\
    \ supply. From\n2019 to 2030, India’s population and development demands\nare\
    \ expected to grow by 50 percent [126]. A transmission\nsystem that can endure\
    \ interruptions and blackouts must\nmeet these criteria. Grid operators must regularly\
    \ monitor\nsupply and demand to avoid power outages. To ﬁx this prob-\nlem, load\
    \ shedding disconnects speciﬁc customers’ electric-\nity. Generators must be turned\
    \ down to prevent blackouts\nif supply and demand are out of sync. Smart grids\
    \ can iden-\ntify problems early on and immediately resolve them. Sen-\nsors monitor\
    \ the grid and manage the ﬂow of current.\nThese are computerized to increase\
    \ productivity [127].\n(5) T-10.5: Smart Solutions for Modern Farming. Sustainable\n\
    food production is in high demand as the world’s population\nexpands and weather\
    \ patterns shift. Agriculture and devel-\nopment go forward as time goes by. Agricultural\
    \ technology\nis advancing rapidly. These new technologies are pretty\neﬀective,\
    \ but they must be constantly improved. Using infor-\nmation and communications\
    \ technology, planting, watering,\nand harvesting are all enhanced. Many ﬁelds,\
    \ including agri-\nculture, beneﬁt from technological advancements. The Inter-\n\
    net of Things (IoT) in agriculture is referred to as “smart\nfarming” [128]. Produce\
    \ and livestock will be healthier\nthanks to IoT-enabled smart farming. Real-time\
    \ information\nis provided through wearables and sensors in the ﬁeld.\nShelter,\
    \ clothing, and food have been top priorities for\nhumanity since the dawn of\
    \ civilization. There is a lot of\nmodernity in the house and clothing. According\
    \ to the UN\nFood and Agriculture Organization (FAO), humanity’s food\nrequirements\
    \ will rise by 70% by 2050, according to the UN\nFood and Agriculture Organization\
    \ (FAO) [129]. IoT can be\nused to solve problems in business and technology.\
    \ Tractors\nare used to plant seeds and gather crops. You can use it for\nbusiness\
    \ or yourself. Farming is done with the help of trac-\ntors. Farmers can do other\
    \ things when they use tractors that\ndrive themselves. A Polish company called\
    \ Agribot makes\ntractors that can work independently. When they pull weeds,\n\
    their tractors have sensors that reduce the number of chemi-\ncals and pesticides\
    \ exposed. Agro-IoT devices can meet the\nneeds of farming in the future. Traditional\
    \ agriculture must\nbecome more productive and less risky for the global econ-\n\
    omy to grow. IoT helps growth. Farmers can keep an eye\non their land with the\
    \ help of the Internet of Things. IoT\napplications include keeping an eye on\
    \ climate change, man-\naging water, keeping an eye on land, improving productivity,\n\
    keeping an eye on farming, and keeping track of pesticides\nand herbicides [130].\n\
    (6) T-10.6: Smart Irrigation System for Agriculture. The most\ndiﬃcult chore in\
    \ agriculture is watering ﬁelds. Water sys-\ntems consist of drips, nozzles, tubes,\
    \ and sprinklers, among\nother things. As a whole, agriculture has a positive\
    \ impact\non economic activity. Watering by hand is required. Gar-\ndening and\
    \ soil deterioration are both covered in rainfall.\nAgriculture’s key objectives\
    \ are the production of food and\nlivestock. IoT is a network of interconnected\
    \ devices that\ncan exchange data [131]. When water supplies are limited,\nautomatic\
    \ irrigation may be necessary.\nAccording on the weather, irrigation might be\
    \ done con-\ntinuously or intermittently. As a result, there is less spillage.\n\
    Almost all of the water comes from drip irrigation or sprin-\nklers. With a wireless\
    \ gadget, soil moisture and humidity\n12\nJournal of Sensors\nmay be monitored.\
    \ In agriculture, controllers manage every-\nthing from power to intruder detection\
    \ to pump switching\n[69]. A pump is used to deliver water to the ground. Water\
    \ is\nconserved when drippers are used. Drip irrigation and ﬂood\nirrigation are\
    \ both standard irrigation methods. Both all of\nthe sensors, pumps, and controls\
    \ work as expected. Manual\nwatering may hurt or deplete crops and the environment.\n\
    Automated irrigation systems can be used to address the diﬃ-\nculties. Farming\
    \ may beneﬁt from drip irrigation, which saves\non water. Automatic irrigation\
    \ systems for crop management\nhave become widespread during rainstorms, landscaping,\
    \ and\nsoil erosion. Wi-ﬁ sensors are used to gauge the humidity and\nmoisture\
    \ content of the soil. In agriculture, controllers keep\nan eye on the electricity,\
    \ keep an eye out for intruders, and\nmanage the pumps. Saturating the soil is\
    \ accomplished with\nthe use of pumps. Using drippers saves water, therefore reduc-\n\
    ing the amount of water used. Floatation irrigation commonly\nutilizes electricity,\
    \ sensors, pumps, and controls [132].\n(7) T-10.7: Blockchain-Based Security System\
    \ for Agriculture.\nThere are nodes in a blockchain, and each node has its own\n\
    distributed ledger, allowing several nodes to read and amend\na single ledger\
    \ while preserving shared control. Each block-\nchain node contains a distributed\
    \ ledger that is safe and acces-\nsible to all participants. There are no middlemen\
    \ to\nauthenticate, track, store or synchronize transactions using\nblockchain\
    \ technology. According to several research studies,\nblockchain has altered technology\
    \ from centralized to decen-\ntralized and distributed networks, a shift that\
    \ has been well\ndocumented. The blockchain helps business networks [133].\nBusiness\
    \ networks are composed of companies or individuals\nthat trade assets. Products,\
    \ materials, and equipment are\nexamples of physical assets. A distributed ledger\
    \ may be used\nto move assets across the network by anybody who is a mem-\nber.\
    \ The most recent ledger is available to all members.\nConsensus-based distributed\
    \ ledgers and smart contracts fos-\nter network conﬁdence. Assets and transactions\
    \ are recorded\nin the distributed ledger. Transactions are possible with a dis-\n\
    tributed ledger. You cannot remove a transaction after it has\nbeen added. An\
    \ encrypted ledger prevents tampering with\ntransactions. With blockchain, the\
    \ distributed ledger is trans-\nformed into a reliable data source for the network\
    \ [134]. A dis-\ntributed ledger of digital commerce is known as a blockchain.\n\
    Each node of the network modiﬁes distributed ledgers\nthrough cryptography. Components\
    \ of a blockchain include\nits block header, timestamp, nonce, and Merkle root\
    \ hash.\nSmart apps are being developed for rural agriculture. Agri-\ncultural\
    \ modernization relies on ICT to automate processes\nand protect personal data.\
    \ Data from many IoT devices\nmay be sent to a central hub to analyze and manage\
    \ auton-\nomous farm activities. However, centralized intermediates\nare inherent\
    \ in a single point of failure, data loss risk, and\nman-in-the-middle attacks.\
    \ Thanks to smart contracts on\nthe blockchain, decentralized and safe agricultural\
    \ automa-\ntions are now possible [135].\n(8) T-10.8: Production-Based Smart System\
    \ for Agriculture. It\nis possible to increase productivity and quality by using\
    \ IoT-\nbased agricultural convergence technologies. Predicting\ndemand, managing\
    \ supply, and ensuring quality are beneﬁts\nof precision agriculture. The expansion\
    \ of the economy is\nmainly fueled by agriculture. The government is responsible\n\
    for protecting the land [136]. Nothing has changed despite\nadvances in science\
    \ and technology. There is no shortage\nof green technologies. Farmers need to\
    \ reduce the time they\nspend working and increase the precision they use their\n\
    resources. Complex statistical methodologies are used by\nagriculturalists when\
    \ analyzing historical data and making\neconomic predictions. Farm yields are\
    \ improved via GPS,\nsensors, and big data. Real-time data from ICT-based deci-\n\
    sion support systems can take the role of farmers’ knowledge\nand intuition [137].\
    \ Improved decision-making reduces the\namount of waste and increases eﬃciency.\
    \ Images, GPS,\nscience-based solutions, climate forecasts, technology, and\n\
    environmental controls play a role in agriculture. As with\nthe terms “smart meters”\
    \ and “smart cities,” “smart farming”\nrefers to any M2M application. Technology\
    \ advances to aid\nin harvest forecasting. However, predictions based on statis-\n\
    tics are not always accurate. Harvest data and the agricul-\ntural environment\
    \ should be correlated. IoT will provide\nagricultural data. Complex statistical\
    \ methodologies are used\nby agriculturalists when analyzing historical data and\
    \ mak-\ning economic predictions. Predicting crop yields is aided\nby the use\
    \ of smart systems. In the end, statistical forecasts\nare not perfect; they are\
    \ only a starting point. Make a con-\nnection between the agricultural environment\
    \ and harvest\ndata. Crop pattern data will be provided through IoT-\nbased decision\
    \ support. On IoT, agribusiness utilizes data\nmining, statistical forecasting,\
    \ and IoT services [138].\n(9) T-10.9: Industry 4.0 in Agriculture. Global agriculture\n\
    must undergo a paradigm shift in light of evolving environ-\nmental conditions,\
    \ dietary preferences, and a scarcity of crit-\nical inputs. It is all about the\
    \ latest advancements in\nagriculture. As a result of the adoption of Industry\
    \ 4.0, busi-\nnesses may expect to see advances in output, eﬃciency, and\ncreativity.\
    \ First, agriculture provides food for the world’s\npopulation. Second, agriculture\
    \ 4.0 decreases labor and envi-\nronmental eﬀects to increase agricultural proﬁtability\
    \ by\nreducing greenhouse gas emissions and water use. Third,\nagriculture is\
    \ the primary source of income for half of India’s\npopulation, India’s veins\
    \ and arteries [139]. The fourth stage\nof industrial development is large-scale\
    \ agriculture. Among\nthe essential ICTs is the IoT. Flexibility is improved in\n\
    “smart factories.” People, equipment, and software work\ntogether to satisfy production\
    \ demands, which are met\nthrough cutting-edge technology such as CPS/IoT/iOS\
    \ and\nreal-time interaction. The industry beneﬁts from consolida-\ntion. However,\
    \ future manufacturing and commerce will be\nharmed. This shift is made possible\
    \ due to the Internet and\ninformation technology [140]. Quality control encompasses\n\
    all aspects of engineering, management, manufacturing,\noperations, and logistics.\
    \ Costs, availability, use of resources,\nand market demand may all be automated.\
    \ ‘The implemen-\ntation of Industry 4.0 will profoundly impact the agriculture\n\
    and industrial sectors. All technologies like Big Data, AI, and\nIoT are part\
    \ of Industry 4.0. IoT allows agricultural systems\n13\nJournal of Sensors\nand\
    \ equipment to connect with one another, making Indus-\ntry 4.0 a game changer\
    \ in agriculture [141]. The fourth\nindustrial revolution created networked tractors,\
    \ farms,\nand manufacturing equipment [142]. “Industry Revolutions\n4.0” refers\
    \ to three factors:\n(1) Digitalization and its integration into simple eco-\n\
    nomical and technical networks\n(2) Digitalization of services and products\n\
    (3) Market models that have been updated\nAs economic, economic and business models\
    \ develop,\nhumans become more distant from the center of production\nand surveillance\
    \ of crops. Industry 4.0 is being used by both\ndeveloped and developing countries.\
    \ India has a lot of\nuntapped potential for agricultural growth. Robotics, IoT,\n\
    and e-business are the three pillars of this revolution, aiming\nto deliver technology\
    \ to every corner of the globe.\n(10) T-10.10: Image-Based Classiﬁcation Techniques\
    \ in Intel-\nligent Agriculture. Agriculture originated thirteen thousand\nyears\
    \ ago between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers north of\nIraq. Gathered vegetation\
    \ included wild wheat and others.\nFew people needed food. UN estimates that the\
    \ world’s pop-\nulation will reach 10 billion by 2050, impacting farmers.\nDesertiﬁcation\
    \ and urbanization wreak havoc on farmland.\nCOVID-19 is a threat to food security\
    \ and the nation’s econ-\nomy. To solve this problem, we need to use fewer people\
    \ to\ngenerate more food [143]. In certain parts of India, rainfall is\nthe only\
    \ irrigation water supply. However, crop destruction\ncan occur in some places\
    \ due to unpredictability in rainfall,\nwhich is a problem. Management of watersheds\
    \ is critical.\nMany-variable hydrological modeling is required to predict\nrainfall\
    \ and runoﬀ in diﬀerent basins accurately. Estimates\nof imperviousness necessitate\
    \ a terrain categorization, which\nultimately categorizes land use and cover [144].\
    \ The image\nclassiﬁcation curve number is used in modeling. Satellite pic-\n\
    tures are diﬃcult to classify because of their high resolution\nand wide range\
    \ of applications.\nNevertheless, images are a common practice in agricul-\nture\
    \ and water management. There are a plethora of tools\nand methods for classifying\
    \ images. ANN and SVM are used\nfor image classiﬁcation [145]. Techniques used\
    \ to organize\npictures traditionally are time-consuming and prone to\nhuman error.\
    \ With pattern recognition, alternate ways can\nreduce time and enhance accuracy.\
    \ Unlike Bayes’ discrimi-\nnant criteria, SVM multiclassiﬁcation outperforms.\n\
    8. Threats to Validity\nThis analysis is based on LDA topic modeling and has\n\
    bounded to the limitations of this topic modeling technique.\nA suﬃcient article\
    \ count has been achieved, yet the risk of\nmissing out is a concern. The bibliographic\
    \ material has also\nbeen inferred. The search string insuﬃciency has been erad-\n\
    icated appropriately due to the limitations of selected search\nterms, synonyms,\
    \ string formulation, and search engines’\nvariedness resulting in imperfect retrieval\
    \ of literature cor-\npus. Labeling topics is a signiﬁcant concern due to subjectiv-\n\
    ity and bias. According to the author, a deep discussion has\nbeen conducted to\
    \ determine the label best to overcome this\nlimitation. Then, based on critical\
    \ terms, labels have been\nformulated to draw the best topic labels for researchers\n\
    and practitioners.\n9. Conclusion\nUsing IoT technology, farmers and producers\
    \ may better\nmanage their resources, such as fertilizer consumption and\nthe\
    \ number of trips made by farm vehicles, while minimiz-\ning waste and maximizing\
    \ productivity, including water,\nelectricity, and other inputs. In IoT smart\
    \ farming systems,\nsensors monitor the agricultural ﬁeld and automate the irri-\n\
    gation system. Farmers can monitor their ﬁelds from any-\nwhere. This paper concluded\
    \ the research direction in\nsmart agriculture and farming. Technology has shaped\
    \ agri-\nculture’s history. Historians have identiﬁed several agricul-\ntural\n\
    revolutions\nthat\nchanged\npractice\nand\noutput.\nTechnological advances have\
    \ fueled these revolutions. The\nIndustrial Revolution mechanized agriculture,\
    \ improving\nfarm labor productivity.\nModern mechanized agriculture has replaced\
    \ numerous\nfarm activities by hand or by oxen, horses, and mules.\nWeather forecasting\
    \ and barbed wire were 19thcentury\nadvances. Portable engines and threshing machines\
    \ became\npopular after improvements. In the 20thcentury, synthetic\nfertilizers\
    \ and insecticides, mass-produced tractors, and agri-\ncultural aircraft for aerial\
    \ pesticide application were devel-\noped. Precision farming, disease monitoring,\
    \ agricultural\ndrones, satellite imagery, and sensors are just ways technol-\n\
    ogy makes farming easier for farmers. Intelligent software\nanalysis for pest\
    \ and disease prediction and soil management\nare only a few of the many analytical\
    \ activities that IoT-\nbased sensor networks may do. New issues in smart farming\n\
    include the security of the farming data, technical failures,\nand technical incompetence.\n\
    10. Future Work\nThe LDA model works like a recommender system. The cur-\nrent\
    \ research is based on extracting keywords from the doc-\numents and recommends\
    \ current and trending research\nareas based on the correlation of the keywords\
    \ in the speci-\nﬁed ﬁeld. So, in the real-time scenario, any corpus of any size\n\
    can be passed to the model to get the relevant keywords, and\nbased on these keywords,\
    \ suggestions for topics can be\ndepicted. The authors have used this model on\
    \ smart agri-\nculture in the current research. In contrast, this model can\n\
    also be implemented in other research ﬁelds like smart cities,\nblockchain, and\
    \ Wireless Sensor Networks. In this study, the\nauthors analyzed data retrieved\
    \ from the Scopus database\ninstead of Web of Science, Education Resources Information\n\
    Center, ScienceDirect, or the Directory of Open Access Jour-\nnals. However, the\
    \ authors chose the Scopus database over\nthese other databases because Scopus\
    \ has more excellent\n14\nJournal of Sensors\ncoverage of publications, demonstrating\
    \ that it is a compre-\nhensive and dependable data source and so justifying its\
    \ eli-\ngibility for this review.\nData Availability\nData are available upon\

    As the world population is expected to touch 9.73 billion by 2050, according

    to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the demand for agricultural

    needs is increasing proportionately. Smart Agriculture is replacing conventional

    farming systems, employing advanced technologies such as the Internet

    of Things (IoT), Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning (ML) to

    ensure higher productivity and precise agriculture management to overcome

    food demand. In recent years, there has been an increased interest in

    researchers within Smart Agriculture. Previous literature reviews have also

    conducted similar bibliometric analyses; however, there is a lack of research
    in

    Operations Research (OR) insights into Smart Agriculture. This paper conducts

    a Bibliometric Analysis of past research work in OR knowledge which has

    been done over the last two decades in Agriculture 4.0, to understand the

    trends and the gaps. Biblioshiny, an advanced data mining tool, was used in

    conducting bibliometric analysis on a total number of 1,305 articles collected

    from the Scopus database between the years 2000–2022. Researchers and

    decision makers will be able to visualize how newer advanced OR theories

    are being applied and how they can contribute toward some research gaps

    highlighted in this review paper. While governments and policymakers will

    beneﬁt through understanding how Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and

    robotic units are being used in farms to optimize resource allocation. Nations

    that have arid climate conditions would be informed how satellite imagery

    and mapping can assist them in detecting newer irrigation lands to assist their

    scarce agriculture resources.

    1. Introduction

    The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United

    Nations (FOA) has estimated that the world population will

    touch 9.73 billion by 2050 and will continue to rise until it

    reaches 11.2 billion by 2,100 (FAO, 2018). There is a direct

    correlation between population expansion and an increase in

    the need for food production. Both increases in population

    and increase in urbanization increase the risk of food shortage

    due to increased consumption, and the demand for nutritious

    agriculture, as farmlands are replaced with infrastructure and

    buildings (Yuan et al., 2018). There are many obstacles to

    agricultural output, resulting in lower crop yield, such as soil

    salinity in arid climates (Mohamed et al., 2019). Further, climate

    and soil sensitivity have an impact on crop quantity and

    quality (Abdel-Fattah et al., 2021). Consequently, it is critical to

    concentrate on surveying land resources for use in agricultural

    growth in dry regions (Saleh et al., 2015). The agriculture

    industry is one of the key sources of national income in

    developing countries. Hence, using new technology to improve

    the agriculture sector is critical to these countries’ national

    economies. In addition to providing the raw materials required

    for the industrial process, agricultural production includes the

    production of food for humans and cattle. Smart Agriculture

    aims to address these concerns through increasing productivity,

    better allocation of resources, adapting to climate change and

    overcoming food wastage.

    Fundamentally, both Smart Agriculture and Precision

    Agriculture utilize the Internet of Things (IoT) or information

    technology to improve spatial management procedures to

    maximize crop yield while avoiding the overuse of fertilizers

    and pesticides (Auernhammer, 2001; Bacco et al., 2019; Chiu

    et al., 2022). Unlike Precision Agriculture, Smart Agriculture,

    also known as Agriculture 4.0, further employs advanced

    technologies such as Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) and Machine

    Learning (ML) to tackle a variety of crop-related diﬃculties by

    enabling the examination of changes in atmospheric conditions,

    soil properties, moisture, etc. The AI and IoT technology enable

    the connection of a variety of distant sensors, including ground

    sensors, robots, and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), since it

    allows items to be linked and operated automatically through

    the internet (Almetwally et al., 2020; Chiu et al., 2022; Javaid

    et al., 2022). Despite Smart Agriculture technology evolving fast,

    academics feel that the technology is still at a nascent stage.

    Agricultural IoT application is currently fragmentary, and its

    usefulness for integration in agricultural development has not

    been fully investigated. This necessitates further research in

    combining Smart Agriculture with Operation Research (OR)

    theories (Hu et al., 2020).

    Bibliometric analyses on Smart Agriculture have also been

    conducted in the past. Abdollahi et al. (2021) conducted

    a bibliometric analysis between the years 2002 to 2021 to

    investigate the application of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)

    in agriculture. Rejeb et al. (2022a) conducted a bibliometric

    analysis between the years 2000–2021 to understand the

    comprehensive application of drones in agriculture. Rejeb et al.

    (2022b) looked at the applications of Artiﬁcial Intelligence

    (AI) in agriculture between the years 1992–2021 by conducting

    a bibliometric analysis. Rejeb et al. (2022c) analyzed the

    applications of the Internet of Things (IoT) in Agriculture

    between the year 2012–2020 by conducting bibliometric

    analysis. However, past bibliometric analyses tried to understand

    how the technologies such as WSN, AI, and IoT were being

    integrated into agriculture practices over the years, but there

    are few, if not any, bibliometric analyses on the application

    of Operations Research (OR) theories in Smart Agriculture or

    Agriculture 4.0 at a comprehensive level to understand how such

    theories have been applied in farms that have already integrated

    technologies such as AI and IoT systems. A complete evaluation

    of the studies on Operation Research (OR) in IoT-based

    intelligent agriculture is expected, considering this context. The

    research questions are (1) How have OR theories are being

    evolved over the last two decades to a more advanced and

    complex level? (2) Which OR theories are being applied to Smart

    Agriculture, and in what context? (3) How are Decision Support

    Systems (DSS) being applied to optimize Smart Agriculture, and

    for which objectives? (4) How are OR theories being applied to

    aid in achieving Smart Agriculture objectives? (5) What are the

    trends, gaps, and future research prospects in the application of

    OR in Smart Agriculture?

    The

    rest

    of

    the

    manuscript

    is

    outlined

    as

    follows:

    The methodology used to conduct bibliometric analysis is

    discussed in methodology section. The results and discussions,

    compromising of descriptive, keyword, and historical analysis,

    applications of DSS, as well as thematic analysis, are conducted

    in results and discussion section. The gaps, extracted insights,

    and future directions are discussed in gaps, future work, and

    insights section. Finally, an extensive conclusion comprising

    theoretical and practical implications, as well as limitations, are

    presented in conclusion section.

    2. Methodology

    In order to convey a holistic overview of the past literature

    on Smart Agriculture at a broad level over many the years,

    it would be ideal to conduct a bibliometric analysis over

    a traditional and systematic literature review. Traditional

    literature review lacks a transparent and systematic approach,

    and as a result, it is more likely to be biased (Kraus et al., 2020).

    While systematic literature review is more methodological

    to allow researchers to collect relevant research papers to

    conduct analysis in a systematic way to identify research gaps

    (Chakraborty et al., 2021). Whereas, bibliometric analysis can

    02

    10.3389/fsufs.2022.1053921

    be applied to large data collection to allow us to visualize

    and reveal the advancement of a discipline in a statistical and

    mathematical method Rejeb et al. (2022b). It supports all the

    main areas of the classical bibliometric approach and provides

    various analyses using a graphical or visualization method

    (della Corte et al., 2019). A structured content analysis using

    bibliometric analysis allows researchers to identify themes and

    is a powerful and reliable approach for conducting a literature

    review (Chakraborty et al., 2021). This research is focused on

    gaining a rounded overview of the OR applications in Smart

    Agriculture, and in order to do so, it would be more feasible

    to conduct a bibliometric analysis for better visualization of

    how research has been gaining popularity and what are the

    research gaps. Moreover, the articles collected would require to

    be analyzed from diﬀerent angles in an unbiased manner, which

    both traditional and systematic literature reviews do not provide.

    Hence, the bibliometric analysis would be an optimum choice.

    FIGURE 1

    Radial venn diagram.

    Bibliometric analysis has been conducted to present a

    state of intellectual structure and to highlight the key trends

    of OR in smart agriculture. The analysis is performed using

    R-package bibliometrix (Harzing and Alakangas, 2016), an

    application designed for quantitative research in Bibliometrics

    or Scientometrics. It supports all the main areas of the classical

    bibliometric approach and provides various analyses using a

    graphical or visualization method (della Corte et al., 2019).

    As mentioned, to conduct a comprehensive overview of

    past literature on Smart Agriculture at a broad level, a wide

    variety of keywords is used to capture the maximum number

    of papers within a deﬁned framework. Bibliometric analysis of

    the collected material in this article is conducted in six phases:

    (1) Descriptive analysis, (2) Keyword analysis, (3) Historical

    analysis, (4) Application of DSS in Smart Agriculture, (5)

    Thematic analysis, and (6) Research gaps and future directions,

    and (7) Conclusions.

    During the ﬁrst phase, a set of keywords was outlined in a

    selected database to capture the past research work in the area

    of smart agriculture. Figure 1 depicts a Radial Venn diagram

    merging four diﬀerent areas with speciﬁc keywords, highlighted

    in Table 1, to collect material of interest to us (Resulting Area

    of Interest). Boolean operators “OR” and “AND” were used to

    achieve the desired merged area of research.

    As shown in Table 2 and Figure 2, Scopus was used as an

    online database to search for material. Two rounds of the search

    were made, wherein the search term was conﬁned to Keywords

    in the ﬁrst and the Article Title in the other. Since publications

    within the ﬁeld of OR in Smart Agriculture were near negligible

    before the year 2000, as shown in Table 4, and to highlight the

    interconnection between the literature paper, the search was

    limited to ﬁnal article papers published in English, and the time

    range was set between 2000 and 2022. To further reﬁne the

    scope of interest to generate better graphs and results, articles

    of speciﬁc subject areas, as shown in Table 3, were discarded.

    A total of 1,305 articles were collected and exported in BibTex

    format to be readily used for Biblioshiny software to conduct a

    range of bibliometric analyses. Figure 2 shows the ﬂowchart of

    the literature selection process.

    3. Results and discussion

    This paper uses an approach similar to that of some scholars

    (Aria and Cuccurullo, 2017) to draw a structure for a literature

    review in OR in Smart Agriculture. The approach is based

    on (1) data collection, (2) data analysis and visualization (3)

    Interpretation. The following section outlines the outcomes of

    the methodology phase described earlier.

    3.1. Descriptive analysis

    Table 4 shows statistics of publications through the past two

    decades. It includes the number of published articles (yearly

    and cumulative) from 2000 to 2022 and the total number of

    articles that have cited the chosen articles. The data illustrate

    that the number of articles in the scope of OR in Smart

    Agriculture gradually increased from 2000 to 2017, whereafter

    it dramatically increased, along with the number of citations per

    year. We should point out that the reason that we started with

    the year 2000 is because of the limited number of articles (max.

    2000) that could be downloaded from the saved library in Scopus

    in one ﬁle to be imported into the Biblioshiny application;

    however, most of the studies have been done in the recent two

    decades, as well.

    Some of the highly cited articles relating to operations

    research in smart agriculture focused on crop identiﬁcation

    using machine learning (ML) techniques (van Niel and

    McVicar, 2004; Peña-Barragán et al., 2011; Ghosal et al., 2018),

    precise irrigation using remote sensing and machine learning

    (Thenkabail et al., 2009; Goap et al., 2018), smart farming using

    the IoT (Mendas and Delali, 2012; Muangprathub et al., 2019),

    crop prediction using simulation modeling (Ines et al., 2013; V.

    Rodriguez-Galiano et al., 2014), and using Unmanned Aerial

    Vehicles (UAV) for crop identiﬁcation (Torres-Sánchez et al.,

    2015; de Castro et al., 2018). The wide variety of topics of high

    citation demonstrates the diversity of the research streams in

    Smart Agriculture.

    Likewise, some of the major categories of operations

    research in smart agriculture were identiﬁed through the

    Scopus database, which included agricultural and biological

    sciences (about 40% of the articles published), Environmental

    Science (38%), Computer Science (28%), Engineering (16%)

    and decision sciences (2%). The most cited countries in the

    Scopus database included the USA (4,825 citations), Italy

    (3,826 citations), China (3,767 citations), and Spain (1,841

    citations), indicating the regions around the world contributing

    signiﬁcantly to the ﬁeld of operations research in smart

    agriculture. Further, Figure 3 is a combination of annual

    scientiﬁc production and annual trending topics generated

    using bibliometrix. The graph indicates the increasing interest

    of researchers in the ﬁeld of operations research in smart

    agriculture and, further, the increased complexity of the

    knowledge applied in smart agriculture.

    Topics were less sophisticated in terms of smart agriculture

    and operations research between the years 2000 and 2017

    since AI and ML methods were not well researched to be

    better applied in agriculture. The topics commonly discussed

    were decision support systems and management of information

    technology for the optimization of agriculture (such as crops,

    waste management, soil erosion, and water use). From 2017,

    the trending topics indicate more complexity and precise

    management of agriculture as research within AI and ML grows

    further, in turn improving agricultural production and practices.

    The topics trending since 2017 are focused on algorithms,

    climate change, precision agriculture, decision trees, remote

    sensing, and predictive analytics error in smart agriculture.

    The crease in complexity and development of sophisticated

    applications of Operations Research is an indication of the

    increased need of the agriculturists to overcome challenges faced

    to optimize their farming practices. Furthermore, the sudden

    increase in the number of articles and total citations from the

    year 2017 is also an indication toward the increasing interest of

    researchers in the application OR in Smart Agriculture.

    3.2. Keyword analysis

    This section details keyword analysis, which is useful

    for conveying an overall summary of an article. Further

    clustering and multiple correspondence analyses will be

    conducted

    to

    better

    understand

    the

    research

    directions

    within the scope of operations research in smart agriculture.

    Biblioshiny, a data-mining and statistical application, was used

    to generate the information required for the analysis. The

    word treemap (Figure 4) was generated for high-frequency

    keywords with a minimum of 85 occurrences. It has the top 40

    keywords frequently used by scholars in Operations research in

    smart agriculture.

    The highest keyword occurrences are for agriculture (7%),

    remote sensing (4%), crops (4%), and artiﬁcial intelligence

    (4%), as listed in Figure 4, which indicates that major research

    areas in operations research in smart agriculture are focused

    on agricultural crops through the use of IoT and AI. In terms

    to obtain an even percentage of articles that focused on

    agricultural systems (such as soil, land use, irrigation, etc.)

    using diﬀerent smart approaches, which included AI, remote

    sensing and machine learning. Within the agriculture group,

    some of the highest cited articles discussed object-based crop

    classiﬁcation (Peña-Barragán et al., 2011), remote sensing

    for agricultural applications (Weiss et al., 2020), predictive

    modeling of agricultural pollution (V. F. Rodriguez-Galiano

    et al., 2018), and managing farms through the use of information

    systems (Espejo-Garcia et al., 2020).

    Top-cited articles on remote sensing discussed various

    aspects, such as Thenkabail et al. (2009) using remote sensing

    to simulate a Global Irrigated Area Map (GIAM) to assist

    precision agriculture (Weiss et al., 2020) and discussing the

    applications of remote sensing in agriculture, (Ines et al.,

    2013) combining remote sensing and simulation to increase

    maize crop production, and (Torres-Sánchez et al., 2015) using

    Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) in remote sensing methods

    for better crop identiﬁcation. It can be deduced that remote

    sensing techniques are commonly employed in agriculture to

    achieve better mapping, improve crop yields and classiﬁcation to

    enhance productivity, and achieve automated smart agriculture.

    Articles on AI looked at the integration of multicriteria

    decision analysis with GIS for agricultural land suitability

    detection (Mendas and Delali, 2012), GIS-based photovoltaic

    farm site detection (Sánchez-Lozano et al., 2014), selecting

    patterns and features for crop weed row mapping using UAV

    (Pérez-Ortiz et al., 2016), and predicting crop yield using fuzzy

    cognitive mapping (Papageorgiou et al., 2009). Articles in ML

    keyword criteria focused on designing a deep machine vision

    model for plant detection (Ghosal et al., 2018), managing

    irrigation systems in agriculture using decision support systems

    (Navarro-Hellín et al., 2016), value creation through big data

    analytics (Saggi and Jain, 2018), etc., Other articles considered

    deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNN) to detect

    water pollution in agricultural irrigation (Chen et al., 2020),

    precise automated leaf detection using image feature analysis

    (Pantazi et al., 2019), and predicting soil moisture content using

    hybrid machine learning (Prasad et al., 2018).

    The wide variety of highly cited articles in AI and ML,

    the heart of smart agriculture, indicates a great potential

    for

    future

    research

    in

    diﬀerent

    agricultural

    segments

    and using big data analytics, farms are adopting more

    precise management.

    3.3. Historical analysis

    Historical network analysis allows us to cluster a number

    of research streams that have evolved over the years. It uses

    the collection of bibliography from the articles collected and

    generates a map of the most relevant citations (Borgman

    and Furner, 2002; Garﬁeld, 2016). The direct historical

    network is discussed in this section, which was generated

    through Biblioshiny.

    The number of nodes was set to 40 to show a complete

    overview of the diﬀerent research paths. The following section

    will discuss the six areas of research relating to Operations

    research in smart agriculture; (1) Remote sensing and statistics,

    (2) ML approach for precise agricultural mapping, (3) Precise

    agricultural management using the IoT, (4) Cloud-based satellite

    for precise irrigation mapping (5) Decision Support Systems

    (DSS) to mitigate fertilizer-based loss and (6) Sustainable

    agriculture using ML techniques.

    3.3.1. Remote sensing and statistics

    Locating and extending irrigation land is important for

    better water management. Using remote sensing techniques

    to gather large amounts of data enables decision-makers to

    make better and more sustainable agricultural decisions. Two

    authors- (Zhu et al., 2014) and (Meier et al., 2018), as

    named in Table 6, both discussed using statistical approaches

    involving diﬀerent vegetation indexes (NDVI) for precise

    irrigation to assist croplands. Both authors considered using

    remote sensing and IoT to generate large statistical data to

    achieve accurate measurements of irrigated areas for improving

    agricultural practices.

    Zhu et al. (2014) employed remote sensing and time-series

    NDVI for mapping irrigated lands in China. Large statistical

    data were collected on diﬀerent precipitation patterns, which

    were downscaled using a spatial allocation model to locate new

    irrigation areas. Meier et al. (2018) looked at using remote

    sensing and multi-temporary NDVI to test existing maps and

    used decision trees to extend irrigated areas. Such methods

    of detecting newer irrigation land or extending the current

    irrigation land support Smart Agriculture requirements by

    increasing productivity since water is an essential source needed

    by agriculture and farms to produce crops.

    3.3.2. Machine learning for precise agricultural

    mapping

    Sustainable agricultural management of water resources

    demands a better understanding of spatial irrigation patterns.

    Both articles focused on the handling of large data to achieve

    better and more precise irrigation in the context of a single

    country using the ML approach. Deines et al. (2017) looked

    at Northern U.S. and analyzed the high-resolution irrigation

    maps produced by Landsat satellite imagery over the past 2

    decades using Google Earth Engine to understand the irrigation

    patterns to better manage the agricultural water resources.

    Statistical modeling involving a random forest classiﬁer was used

    to understand how precipitation inﬂuenced irrigation over time.

    Ketchum et al. (2020) used an ML approach to achieve

    better mapping of irrigated agricultural lands in the Western

    U.S. Similar to the ﬁrst group, Google Earth Engine was used

    to collect past data of four diﬀerent classes: irrigated agriculture,

    wetlands, uncultivated land, and dryland agriculture over 3

    decades to cover a variety of spectra to better map the irrigated

    agricultural lands to improve precise agricultural practices.

    The higher resolution of irrigated lands and better

    classiﬁcation assists in enhancing precise irrigation management

    for farms, and such methods support Smart Agriculture goals by

    improving resource allocation. Table 7 shows research stream:

    ML for precise agriculture mapping.

    3.3.3. Precise agricultural management using

    the Internet of Things (IoT)

    The research stream illustrated that IoT practices could be

    more sustainable and proﬁtable in terms of precise agriculture

    through better water management and fertilizer allocation than

    conventional models. Krishnan et al. (2020) employed smart

    irrigation systems based on fuzzy logic using IoT to reduce

    the amount of power for the watering of ﬁelds. A fuzzy logic

    controller was used to determine the input parameters, such as

    soil humidity, temperature, and moisture, to compute the output

    of the motor status. Farmers were assisted with smart irrigation

    systems through Global Systems for Mobile Communication

    (GSMC) to better manage the watering of agricultural ﬁelds by

    knowing the job status, including the soil moisture, humidity,

    and temperature, along with the status of motor power.

    Kocian et al. (2020) used IoT-based agricultural decision

    support methods for crop growth prediction. A dynamic

    Bayesian network (DBN) was used to correlate the parameters of

    crop growth with the environmental control parameters through

    the unknown Markov Chain. The crop growth parameters

    included lead-area index, dry weight, and evapotranspiration

    on a daily basis, while the environmental control parameters

    included solar exposure, vapor pressure, and temperature of the

    controlled environment. Large expectation-maximization (EM)

    algorithms were used to track states and better understand the

    parameters of DBN.

    Lin et al. (2020) focused on fertigation management

    based on IoT for sustainable precision agriculture. The paper

    addressed the irrigation and fertilizer allocation problems

    through a framework using IoT to manage not only at the

    short-term level but also in the long term. The integer linear

    programming model was developed to allocate limited resources

    among diﬀerent crops to maximize the total proﬁt (both

    economic and environmental).

    The use of IoT in smart agriculture supports the agriculture

    4.0 requirements by adapting to climate change as water

    resources are further decreasing due to increased demand, and

    this requires the use of smart irrigation. IoT is also being applied

    in Smart Agriculture, using probability to predict crop growth

    to increase productivity; such methods support Agriculture 4.0.

    Table 8 shows research stream: precise agriculture management

    using IoT.

    3.3.4. Cloud-based satellite for precise

    irrigation mapping

    All the articles in this stream utilized satellite imaging at

    a cloud-based level for better mapping of diﬀerent sectors

    of agriculture, such as irrigation and soil moisture, to

    improve precise agricultural practices. Such precise and accurate

    agricultural practices assist farmers in adapting to climate

    change and increase the productivity of their crops.

    Bazzi et al. (2021) focused on precise irrigation through

    mapping at plot scale using S1 and S2 data over 4 years

    (2017–2020). Two irrigation metrics were adopted for selection

    criteria, the ﬁrst one based on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)

    using S1 and the other optical-based using S2; both were time

    series. Random forest (RF) was used to build an irrigation

    classiﬁcation model to validate the results. The proposed method

    demonstrated a higher accuracy of irrigation maps compared

    to empirical methods. Higher accuracy of irrigation mapping

    assists Smart Agriculture goals by better resource allocation.

    Likewise, Wellington and Renzullo (2021) considered

    enhancing irrigated crop mapping using S2 images. Accurate

    mapping for irrigated areas can be challenging to generate

    at a small level, requiring complex models attached to image

    stacks. Supervised random forest was applied to the collected

    data for smallholder irrigation schemes, enhancing the mapping

    of irrigation land. Pageot et al. (2020) also looked at better

    detection of irrigated lands jointly using S1 and S2 along

    with meteorological time series to improve crop irrigation

    management. The study was conducted over 2 years in a

    temperate area to detect rainfed plots. Monthly data was

    cumulated, provided by satellite imaging to be readily used

    in Random Forest Classiﬁer. Through the combined use of

    S1 (radar), S2 (optical), and meteorological (weather) time-

    series data, the study showed signiﬁcant improvement in both

    classiﬁcations of irrigated crops and mapping of irrigated areas.

    Detecting newer irrigated lands, in turn, leads to agricultural

    production increasing, since there is a protentional for more

    availability of water.

    Gao et al. (2018) formulated a synergetic technique using S1

    and S2 for mapping soil moisture and irrigated areas. The paper

    developed an algorithm using the Water Cloud Model (WCM)

    to spatialize the soil water content between 2015 and 2017. Along

    with WCM, a decision tree approach using statistical indices

    of soil humidity and Normalized Diﬀerence Vegetation Index

    (NDVI) was used to classify irrigation maps at individual ﬁelds.

    By analyzing the moisture content of the soil to classify irrigation

    lands, the resources are better allocated for farms.

    The research of Bousbih et al. (2018) was based on high-

    dimensional automated algorithm satellite imaging for better

    mapping to achieve precise management of diﬀerent agricultural

    sectors. Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used to identify

    irrigated areas based on parameters of soil moisture such as

    mean and variance. The model was tested in Tunisia, and the

    research concluded that classiﬁcation based on soil moisture

    3.3.5. Decision support systems (DSS) to

    mitigate fertilizer-based loss

    The nodes Meza-Palacios et al. (2020) and Zhang et al.

    (2021), as named in Table 10, have LCS and GCS of (0,

    3) and (1, 2), respectively, both having a low score due to

    the publications being recent. Zhang et al. (2021) utilized a

    new structure consisting of analytical hierarchy (AHP) and

    modiﬁed analytical hierarchy methods (MAHP) along with

    metaheuristic optimization techniques to ascertain the optimum

    rate of nitrogen while considering the capacity and requirement

    constraints. Such DSS was designated to satisfy both farmers

    by generating high proﬁts and the environmental experts by

    keeping pollution low.

    Meza-Palacios et al. (2020) focused on increasing the yield

    of sugarcane by increasing the eﬃciency of fertilizer rates. The

    research proposed a (DSS) based on two fuzzy models, the

    edaphic condition model and NPK fertilization model, for a

    better NPK (nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium) fertilization

    rate. Such DSS models enable farmers to ensure that they meet

    the safety standards of minimizing the impact on climate and

    human health.

    3.3.6. Sustainable agriculture using machine

    learning (ML) techniques

    The nodes Hamrani et al. (2020) and Abbasi et al. (2021),

    as named in Table 11, have LCS and GCS of (0,0) and (1,10),

    respectively. All three papers looked at the application of

    the ML approach to overcome environmental problems, to

    achieve sustainable agriculture. Abbasi et al. (2021) used ML

    algorithms to model carbon dioxide emissions from inorganic

    fertilizers. The paper looked at six diﬀerent models, viz., random

    forest (RF), Feed Forward Neural Network (FNN), Radial

    Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN), Extreme Learning

    Machine (ELM), Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection

    Operator (LASSO), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The

    paper retained the same input parameters, compared the output

    of the diﬀerent models, and found that RF was the best model for

    predicting carbon dioxide emission from IF. Likewise, Hamrani

    et al. (2020) also compared three additional ML models,

    Deep Belief Net (DBN, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM),

    The research papers in this research stream looked at

    diﬀerent ML models to analyze which are useful in predicting

    greenhouse gas emissions from the soil. The outcome of the

    research stream supports the agriculture 4.0 goals of adapting

    to climate change.

    3.4. Application of DSS in smart

    agriculture

    The four areas that agriculture 4.0 looks to address are

    directly related to accurate decision-making, and researchers

    are designing and implementing Decision Support Systems

    (DSS) to optimize crop productivity while addressing them.

    Articles with the following keywords were ﬁltered: Decision

    Support System (DSS), optimization, and simulation. From the

    resultant 238 articles, those which addressed the four areas of

    Agriculture 4.0 were ﬁltered to highlight the models they applied

    in smart agriculture. Table 12 discusses the application of DSS in

    smart agriculture.

    Researchers have used a wide variety of methods to

    design DSS to support farmers for better decision-making.

    Recio et al. (2003) utilized the application of the advanced

    decision-making tool AgriSupport II system to enhance the

    agriculture production processes. The AgriSupport II system

    provided farmers with decision-making solutions to improve

    operations like operating cost, proﬁtability analysis, scheduling,

    and resource allocation. CPLEX optimizer was used to design

    a model algorithm that would ensure optimum decision-

    making suggestions by computing all feasible modes and then

    performing a comparative analysis of all modes to suggest the

    mode that is the least costly for agricultural task allocations.

    By adopting the AgriSupport II system, farmers are assisted

    in achieving higher eﬃciency at the least investment cost,

    consequently enhancing agricultural production, which is one

    of the requirements of Agriculture 4.0.

    Conesa-Muñoz et al. (2016) and Nabaei et al. (2018)

    both looked at using multi-robot sensing systems to allocate

    agricultural work to appropriate robotic units. The multi-

    sensing system was tested multiple times on a Spanish farm,

    using both aerial and ground units, to assist farmers in the

    optimal distribution of tasks. Both used the metaheuristic

    optimization method for ground planning through Harmony

    Search Algorithm. The multi-robot system collected agricultural

    data using aerial vehicles controlled by a Mission Manager,

    which was connected to a Base Station Computer. The system

    assigned agricultural tasks to the most appropriate robotic unit,

    allowing farmers to supervise and manage the entire process

    through a multi-robot sensing system, a decision-making tool

    for task allocation. Accurate imaging data collected can also

    inform farmers about how much herbicides or pesticides are

    needed for the crops. Such systems can act as essential supports

    for Agriculture 4.0.

    With the increase in the deployment of Aerial Unmanned

    Vehicle (UAV) in various applications, including agriculture,

    Alsalam et al. (2017) designed an onboard DSS system to detect

    the precise location of crops with disease and then delegate

    appropriate action to UAV, such as precise herbicide spray.

    Through the assistance of the Object-Based Image Analysis

    (OBIA) algorithm, the use of UAV can increase eﬃciency in

    work with precise crop detection and management of toxic

    damage on farms.

    Within the scope of route planning, Keller et al. (2007) and

    Bochtis et al. (2012) constructed Agriculture Decision Support

    System (DSS) to optimize the deployment and utilization of

    agricultural vehicles in ﬁelds with sensitive soil. The B-pattern

    optimization algorithm was used as a tool to provide an optimal

    route. Route planning and optimization enable vehicles to

    consume less energy and cause less damage to sensitive soil. This

    will enhance crop productivity, which supports the agriculture

    4.0 requirement. Most current research for the application

    of Agriculture Decision Support Systems (ADDS) for water

    resource management is related more to irrigation management.

    For example, Navarro-Hellín et al. (2016) designed a smart

    irrigation decision support system (SIDSS) for better irrigation

    planning through better, eﬃcient, and accurate use of water

    resources. The research looked at predicting the water needs

    of the crops for better irrigation planning. Partial Least

    Squares (PLSR) and Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Interference Systems

    (ANFIS) were used to provide reasoning results to generate the

    decision support system requirement.

    Other authors, such as Giusti and Marsili-Libelli (2015),

    used fuzzy DSS (FDSS) using the IRRINET model to improve

    irrigation practices on farms. Similar to the ﬁnding of Navarro-

    Hellin, such fuzzy DSS assist farmers by using a predictive model

    and inference system of soil properties for better allocation

    through daily water scheduling. Fuzzy C-Mean algorithms were

    used to generate a decision support system for farmers by

    suggesting the amount of water the crops require to remain

    irrigated. Through better and smart management of irrigation

    of crops, the research supported Agriculture 4.0.

    Current researchers are also addressing climate change

    through better farming adaptability using ADSS (El-Sharkawy,

    2014; Weller et al., 2016). Schütze and Schmitz (2010) proposed

    a methodology, Stochastic Crop-Water Production Function

    (SCWPF), to quantify the eﬀect of climate change on irrigation

    in agriculture. The proposed DSS was tested on farms in

    France, and it was concluded that the OCCASION model

    formulated enabled farmers with adequate data on weather and

    soil properties to evaluate the potential eﬀect of climate change

    on farms, and OCCASION can be used to adjust decisions

    for irrigation scheduling and planning. Wenkel et al. (2013)

    presented an interactive DSS named LandCaRe, which was

    tested in Germany, and experimental ﬁndings showed that this

    system could be used to predict weather conditions and the

    extent of periods of vegetation. LandCaRe DSS can provide

    farmers with optimal decisions for improved farming practices

    under climate change.

    3.5. Thematic map

    The structure of the thematic map is generated by

    bibliometrix based on the clustering of the frequency of the

    repeated occurrences of keywords, and these clusters are known

    to be themes. Bibliometrix utilizes a thematic map to outline the

    Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems

    12

    frontiersin.org

    Yousaf et al.

    10.3389/fsufs.2022.1053921

    conceptual framework of the research topics. A thematic map

    enables four diﬀerent typologies of topics to be identiﬁed based

    on which quadrant they are in. The motor themes are the motifs

    in the upper-right quadrant. They are distinguished by a high

    degree of centralization and density, indicating that they have

    been developed and are important in the ﬁeld of research.

    The highly developed and isolated motifs, also known

    as niche themes, are found in the upper-left quadrant.

    They have matured internal links with high density but

    insigniﬁcant outward links and hence are of little signiﬁcance

    in the ﬁeld (low centrality). Emerging or declining motifs

    appear in the lower-left quadrant. They have a low density

    and centrality, indicating that they are underdeveloped and

    peripheral. Basic and transversal themes are found in the lower-

    right quadrant and have a high degree of centralization and

    low density.

    These themes are signiﬁcant for a study ﬁeld and cover

    general topics relevant to all research areas of the ﬁeld (della

    Corte et al., 2019). As shown in Figure 5, thematic mapping

    allows the mapping of four diﬀerent themes of research.

    Keyword Plus was used as it allows the capture of an article’s

    features with greater depth. The thematic map is based on two

    axes, one indicating the centrality or relevance of the keyword,

    and the other, the density or the degree of development.

    Cluster #1 (C1) and Cluster #2 (C2) are both within

    the motor themes, where C2 is more central and less dense

    compared to C2. The higher central aspect of C1 indicates that

    the articles published within the scope of agriculture, article, and

    classiﬁcation are concerned more with crop classiﬁcation.

    Some of the recent publications within C1 focus on digital

    soil mapping (Lagacherie et al., 2022), an intelligence-based

    approach for agricultural soil prediction (Nguyen et al., 2022),

    AI-based apple leaf disease classiﬁcation (Al-Wesabi et al.,

    2022), and simulating various water-deﬁcit regimes for irrigation

    scheduling optimization (Martínez-Valderrama et al., 2020).

    Recent publications indicate that C1 is more inclined toward

    procedures and classiﬁcation of multiple aspects of agriculture

    segments. C2, which is also within the motor theme quadrant, is

    of higher density, indicating more research development in the

    ﬁeld of crops, AI, and decision support systems compared to C1.

    About 37% of the total articles collected are within the scope of

    C2, and the recent publications merge closely with C1.

    Cluster #3 (C3) and Cluster #4 (C4) are within the emerging

    or declining themes. Some of the recent articles in C3 discuss

    mapping land suitability (Carlier et al., 2021), soil prediction

    using AI (Nguyen et al., 2022), and modeling spatial dynamics

    (Sodango et al., 2021). While some articles in C4 are of emerging

    nature, including the combined use of machine learning

    algorithms and UAV (Ndlovu et al., 2021; Onishi and Ise, 2021;

    Qiu et al., 2021), machine vision yield monitoring (Dolata et al.,

    2021), artiﬁcial neural networks for crop evapotranspiration

    estimation (Gao et al., 2021), and usage of machine learning for

    crop prediction (Almeida et al., 2021).

    While there was no cluster within the niche or isolated

    theme, all four clusters are shown to be interlinked through

    the cross-collaboration of work between diﬀerent subject

    areas. The overall thematic map demonstrates that newer areas

    of study within agriculture are turning toward precision

    agriculture

    through

    precise

    modeling

    and

    estimating

    of maps, soil, evapotranspiration, etc., using newer and

    advanced technologies.

    4. Gaps, future work, and insights

    The comprehensive bibliometric analysis of OR in smart

    agriculture revealed some gaps and future directions, which are

    listed below:

    1. Precision Agriculture focuses on the application of IoT to

    achieve precise farming practices. IoT has mainly been used

    to achieve optimization of conventional farming systems,

    and such optimization models are included within the DSS

    to assist farmers in making better decisions. The Decision

    Sciences database covers 2% of the total material collected

    from the Scopus database. Research within this scope was

    inclined toward better task allocation or vehicle route

    planning to assist farmers in better utilizing robotic units

    in agriculture. Most such research used complex algorithms

    such as metaheuristic algorithm, B-pattern algorithm, and

    OBIA algorithm. The DSS was initially focused toward

    applying OR theories to achieve better resource allocations

    through route planning (Keller et al., 2007; Bochtis et al.,

    2012), and recent papers have also focused on resource

    allocation but through the application of robotic units for

    better task allocations (Conesa-Muñoz et al., 2016; Nabaei

    et al., 2018) and water management for irrigation planning

    (Giusti and Marsili-Libelli, 2015; Navarro-Hellín et al., 2016).

    The application of DSS allows farmers to make better

    decisions for better farming; however, these methods are

    mostly limited to resource allocation, and there is a lack of

    research to address climate change, increase the productivity

    of the farms, or reduce agriculture waste. Moreover, there

    was a lack of research that utilized mathematical optimization

    programming, such as linear programming (LP), mixed

    integer programming (MIP), dynamic programming (DP),

    and Stochastic Programming (SP). Future research needs to

    incorporate such techniques to allow farmers to not only

    practice smart agriculture but also make decisions from the

    business perspective of enhancing proﬁtability by reducing

    food waste.

    2. Machine Learning (ML) and Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI)

    application in agriculture were heavily inclined toward

    probability and statistics. As the world is facing water issues,

    an essential component of farming, much of satellite imaging

    methods were applied toward mapping and detecting

    irrigation lands (Deines et al., 2017; Ketchum et al., 2020;

    Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems

    13

    frontiersin.org

    Yousaf et al.

    10.3389/fsufs.2022.1053921

    FIGURE 5

    Thematic map.

    Pageot et al., 2020; Bazzi et al., 2021), mostly using the

    Random Forest (RF) classiﬁers and at times Water Cloud

    Model (WCM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). While

    one of the recent papers (Abbasi et al., 2021) compared

    multiple AI and ML methods, such as FNN, RBFNN, and

    SVM, to draw the conclusion that the RF modeling method

    was optimum to be the application of prediction of carbon

    dioxide emission. Such development within the ﬁeld of ML

    and AI in agriculture demonstrates that future research is

    more focused on statistics and probability aspects of OR

    theories. One primary reason could be that climate change

    is causing unforeseen disruptions in agriculture productivity,

    and in order to bring resilience to farming practices, such

    theories are needed to predict the unforeseen circumstances

    to better overcome the risks. However, such methods can

    be capital intensive as the application of ML and AI on

    large data sets require a powerful machine to conduct

    computation, and also the computation times are lengthy.

    Researchers are employing advanced knowledge of AI and

    ML to enable farmers to mostly for better resource allocation

    and sometimes for adapting to climate change or increasing

    productivity. There is less focus on overcoming agriculture

    wastage, which is one of the main pillars of Smart Agriculture.

    This hints at the need for further research in terms of

    optimization of agriculture wastages in order to overcome

    this large research gap. Moreover, according to thematic

    analysis, the articles within C4 highlighted that future streams

    are expected to involve more complex OR theories, AI and

    ML streams, with the combination of ML algorithms and

    UAV (Ndlovu et al., 2021; Onishi and Ise, 2021; Qiu et al.,

    2021) to optimize the productivity, and continue to apply ML

    for prediction and estimation in crop management (Almeida

    et al., 2021; Q. Gao et al., 2018). Such complex application

    of OR is hinting toward future involving the analysis of large

    data sets to meet Agriculture 4.0 goals.

    3. The major research gap lies in most of the OR theories

    being applied to conventional farming systems to make them

    smarter and more automated. For example, some research

    papers looked at providing optimal decision parameters for

    farmers for better resource allocation using robots (Conesa-

    Muñoz et al., 2016; Nabaei et al., 2018), while others

    looked at the use of sensors with fuzzy models (Krishnan

    et al., 2020; Meza-Palacios et al., 2020), RF (Abbasi et al.,

    2021), and LSTM (Hamrani et al., 2020) to optimize crop

    yields and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, some

    papers designed DSS for improved irrigation management

    (papers), while others used satellite imagery to detect or

    extend irrigation lands (papers). While such papers utilize

    Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems

    14

    frontiersin.org

    Yousaf et al.

    10.3389/fsufs.2022.1053921

    the application of IoT and ML, however, they are mainly

    being addressed toward optimizing traditional farming

    systems. About 1.5 and 1% of the total material collected

    addressed the application of OR in vertical farming and

    plant factories, respectively. With the introduction of newer

    farming methods such as vertical farms and plant factories to

    accommodate countries that do not have conditions suitable

    for agriculture, there is the prospect for future research in

    the application of newer OR theories in these newer farming

    methods to achieve agriculture 4.0 goals.

    5. Conclusion

    5.1. Discussions of ﬁndings

    Research on Operations Research (OR) application in

    smart agriculture is increasing. The literature review aids in

    understanding the links and advancement of a research ﬁeld

    and provides insights into the activities of scholars. However,

    the inherent subjectivity of narrative and systematic reviews is

    reduced by bibliometric analyses.

    Our study explored the operations research knowledge

    applied to smart agriculture. In this context, we conducted a

    descriptive analysis to describe how research is increasing. It has

    been clear that since 2017, research has dramatically increased,

    as newer knowledge in the Internet of Things (IoT), artiﬁcial

    intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) approaches is

    being enhanced for better application in smart agriculture. This

    has been further validated by conducting a keyword analysis.

    Then, historical analysis was also conducted by generating

    historiography to check how some of the research streams

    had evolved and what the current research publications are

    focused on. It was noted that the major focus was on statistics

    and prediction to achieve precise agriculture. This was further

    supported through thematic mapping, where it was noticed

    that emerging research was focusing on agricultural land use

    mapping through satellite imaging, along with agricultural

    robotics and remote sensing.

    Further, articles within the scope of decision support system

    (DSS) in smart agriculture were perused within the scope of

    Agriculture 4.0 requirements. It was apparent that DSS models

    were more inclined toward better allocation of resources using

    smart technology; however, recent articles seem to be adopting

    the climate change agenda (Hamrani et al., 2020; Abbasi et al.,

    2021; Zhang et al., 2021).

    Future research, according to thematic mapping, has

    shown that ML and AI applications are moving toward more

    complexity as complex OR theories are being combined. While

    most current research and the future streams within ML

    and AI scope are inclined toward probability and statistics

    to predict and estimate for reasons such as prediction of

    crops or evapotranspiration, and other reasons include adapting

    to climate change. However, there was lesser focus toward

    optimizing agriculture farms through reducing or reusing

    wastage. Moreover, RF applications of OR were more readily

    adopted for agriculture or irrigation mapping using satellite

    imaging. With the increase in the sophisticated nature of ML and

    AI, the future of OR is moving toward data sciences.

    It was noted that most applications of ML and AI, with OR

    theories, were being applied to conventional farming systems.

    As food security and climate change are starting to become

    more important, and countries that have arid climate conditions,

    there is a prospect and need to apply OR theories within newer

    farming methods. And since such newer farming methods, such

    as vertical farms or plant factories, usually involve sensors to

    control the environment, there is a scope to apply the current

    and past OR theories within conventional farming systems that

    involve sensors, robotic units and UAV.

    Finally,

    as

    the

    population

    is

    expected

    to

    increase

    drastically over the coming years, the agri-food demand

    is

    correspondingly

    expected

    to

    increase,

    and

    in

    order

    to

    achieve

    greater

    food

    security

    and

    a

    resilient

    agri-

    food

    supply

    chain,

    future

    research

    needs

    to

    utilize

    optimization

    and

    simulation

    techniques

    to

    reduce

    food

    waste, ensure better food security, and optimize agricultural

    resources to increase productivity within both precision

    and smart agriculture, and to meet agriculture 4.0 goals

    more holistically.

    5.2. Theoretical implications

    Our comprehensive bibliometric analysis within the scope

    of OR applications in Smart Agriculture oﬀers valuable

    information to multiple stakeholders, including researchers,

    decision makers, and consultants, who can understand and

    visualize how OR theories are being applied in diﬀerent areas

    of Smart Agriculture to optimize and design DSS. Moreover,

    as sustainability and climate change are taking center stage in

    research, researchers will be able to understand how AI, IoT

    and ML methods within Smart Agriculture are being applied to

    overcome and mitigate climate change concerns. Moreover, our

    research has demonstrated improving productivity and reducing

    agricultural waste to meet Smart Agriculture goals are areas

    of less focus, and this will motivate researchers to increase

    their area of study to overcome this gap. While researchers

    have been highly concentric toward irrigation planning between

    the years 2014 and 2015, newer research is focusing toward

    agriculture mapping and classiﬁcation, and such future direction

    will also allow the researcher to apply their current knowledge

    in this ﬁeld. Last but not least, the holistic overview of literature

    between the years 2000–2022 will certainly give researchers and

    multiple stakeholders the visual map of how research within the

    scope of OR in Smart Agriculture is evolving and what are the

    trending topics and the research gaps.

    5.3. Practical implications

    Nations that do not have suitable conditions for agricultural

    farming would have their governments trying to understand

    how they can make their current farming practices eﬃcient

    and responsive in order to meet the increasing agri-food

    demand. Our bibliometric analysis, speciﬁcally the application

    of DSS in Smart Agriculture, would give some examples of how

    governments can optimize and regulate their limited resources,

    such as water, through irrigation mapping. Furthermore, as our

    bibliometric analysis is demonstrating a drastic increase in the

    publication within the ﬁeld of OR in Smart Agriculture and

    the application of UAV and robotic units, governments will see

    the need to introduce policies to regulate the farms to ensure

    the safety of people and the environment is being maintained.

    Stakeholders who are not aware of the application of UAV

    and robotic units through the use of IoT and AI for better

    resource allocation will feel inclined toward adopting these

    methods to their farms. One of the major practical implications

    lies in understanding that most literature papers focus on OR

    theories in traditional farming methods. To the best of our

    knowledge, there are few or negligible literature papers that

    apply OR theories toward newer agricultural methods such

    as hydroponics, a part of vertical farming, plant factories or

    urban agriculture. Such lack of literature focus would indicate

    that governments and researchers would feel the need to adopt

    AI and IoT to make newer agricultural methods to Smart

    Agriculture and then apply OR theories to optimize them in

    order to meet Smart Agriculture or Agriculture 4.0 goals.

    5.4. Limitations of bibliometric analysis

    Even though our attempt to understand a holistic overview

    of OR theories in Smart Agriculture through bibliometric

    analysis has given signiﬁcant contributions, this review has

    some limitations that needs to be addressed when reading

    the results. One of the major shortcomings is that we only

    considered the Scopus database, and our articles of selection

    were limited to keywords and titles only. Future research should

    consider other databases, such as the Web of Science and

    integrate the ﬁndings with our results to provide a further

    overview of the OR theories being applied in Smart Agriculture.

    Moreover, if possible, future research should try to include

    Abstracts within the Scopus database search to capture more

    literature for a deeper bibliometric analysis. Our research mainly

    attempted to understand what are the current OR applications

    in Smart Agriculture during historical analysis, and future

    research should increase the span of historical analysis through

    increasing the node above 40 on Bibliometrix to generate

    more research streams and trends. While Smart Agriculture

    is a wide ﬁeld, future research may also incorporate how OR

    theories are being applied speciﬁcally in livestock, soil and

    water management through changing the keyword algorithms

    to incline the literature search to be more subject matter. Finally,

    as newer farming methods will be coming to light, future

    researchers should conduct a bibliometric analysis on how OR

    theories are being used within hydroponic, urban agriculture, or

    plant factories.

    Climate change and food security are the most relevant issues to be considered
    in sustainable agricultural development. The FAO’s initiative of climate-smart
    agriculture has attracted international attention. Since then, the smart agriculture
    (SA) has been recognized as the most influential trends in contributing to agricultural
    development. Therefore, encouraging farmers to adopt digital technologies and
    mobile devices into farming practices becomes a policy priority worldwide. However,
    there is limited literature available on psychologic factors that drive farmers’
    intentions to adopt SA technologies. The purpose of this study is to investigate
    how farmer’s knowledge and attitude toward SA affects their adoption of smart
    technologies in Taiwan. A total of 321 farmers participated in the project’s survey
    in 2017 and 2018, from which the data was used to perform an OLS regression model
    of SA adoption. This study contributes to a preliminary understanding of relationship
    between innovation and adoption of SA technologies in a small-scale farming economic
    context. The findings suggest that the policy makers and R&D institutes need to
    concentrate on improving market access for well-known and high important SA technologies.

    \ data are generated in the modern Internet of\nThings (IoT) environment. Nowadays,\
    \ deep learning (DL) techniques are utilized to extract useful\ninformation from\
    \ the data that are generated constantly. Nevertheless, integrating DL methods\
    \ with\nIoT devices is a challenging issue due to their restricted computational\
    \ capacity. Although cloud\ncomputing solves this issue, it has some problems\
    \ such as service delay and network congestion.\nHence, fog computing has emerged\
    \ as a breakthrough way to solve the problems of using cloud\ncomputing. In this\
    \ article, we propose a strategy that assigns a portion of the DL layers to fog\
    \ nodes\nin a fog-computing-based smart agriculture environment. The proposed\
    \ deep learning entrusted to\nfog nodes (DLEFN) algorithm decides the optimal\
    \ layers of DL model to execute on each fog node,\nconsidering their available\
    \ computing capacity and bandwidth. The DLEFN individually calculates\nthe optimal\
    \ layers for each fog node with dissimilar computational capacities and bandwidth.\
    \ In\na similar experimental environment, comparison results clearly showed that\
    \ proposed method\naccommodated more DL application than other existing assignment\
    \ methods and utilized resources\neﬃciently while reducing network congestion\
    \ and processing burden on the cloud.\nKeywords: fog computing; deep learning;\
    \ layer deﬁnition algorithm; smart agriculture\n1. Introduction\nIn rural areas,\
    \ the increasing age of populations and reduction in quantity will lead to weakness\n\
    of economic power due to labor shortage. Smart agriculture technologies are already\
    \ being used in\nmany countries as an approach, using information and communication\
    \ technology (ICT) to eﬀectively\nsolve rural problems such as the above-mentioned\
    \ labor shortage [1,2]. Recently, smart agriculture\nhas attempted and implemented\
    \ full automation incorporating other trending technologies such as\nbig data,\
    \ Internet of Things (IoT), and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) to improve farmers’\
    \ quality of life\n(QoL) [3].\nAI has been extensively studied for decades and\
    \ has become popular today, along with other\nhigh-end technologies [4]. AI technologies\
    \ are used to extract valuable data from various data\ngenerated by IoT devices.\
    \ Deep learning (DL), which is an AI technology, is eﬀective in analyzing huge\n\
    multimedia data such as images and videos. DL technology can be used to identify\
    \ health conditions\nby analyzing the movement of livestock or to optimize the\
    \ timing of harvests by analyzing the shape of\nagricultural products [5]. Thus,\
    \ the proper utilization of DL in smart agriculture signiﬁcantly improve\nfarmers’\
    \ economic power [6].\nFog computing (FC) is another recent technology that has\
    \ improved quality of service (QoS)\nfor modern ICT in the 4th industrial revolution.\
    \ Unlike cloud computing, which processes all data\nat a central server, fog nodes\
    \ distributed in FC support the processing on a central server [7]. In\nmodern\
    \ environments where huge volumes of multimedia data are continuously generated\
    \ from IoT\nAppl. Sci. 2020, 10, 1544; doi:10.3390/app10041544\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/applsci\n\
    Appl. Sci. 2020, 10, 1544\n2 of 16\nmedia devices such as CCTV [8], processing\
    \ all data on a central server may bring on low QoS, such\nas response delay due\
    \ to burden of the server and limitations of the network. In FC, intermediate\n\
    servers called fog nodes preprocess some of data received from devices and share\
    \ the burden of the\ncentral server.\nIn DL processes, valuable results are obtained\
    \ after incoming data traverse through many layers,\nsince a DL model is composed\
    \ of multiple layers to analyze features. Processing at each layer extracts\n\
    features and generates data for delivery to the next layer; the size of the generated\
    \ data is thus\nsigniﬁcantly reduced compared with the incoming size. An architecture\
    \ of DL models is appropriate\nfor a FC system, since fog nodes can handle some\
    \ layers that process incoming data and the cloud\nserver can then handle residual\
    \ layers to process the data transferred from fog nodes. Fog nodes\nreduce the\
    \ data volume by dealing with the authorized DL layers. Therefore, DL operation\
    \ on FC can\nreduce overall network traﬃc and computational overhead on a cloud\
    \ server, thereby minimizing\nresponse delays and allowing more DL operations\
    \ to be accommodated.\nHerein, we propose a deep learning entrusted to fog nodes\
    \ (DLEFN) algorithm that decides the\noptimal number of DL layers that can be\
    \ handled by each fog node. The proposed DLEFN aims\nto improve the availability\
    \ and utilization of fog nodes distributed in an FC environment and to\naccommodate\
    \ many applications eﬀectively. The optimal layers are decided by taking into\
    \ account\nthe available computational capacity and bandwidth at each fog node.\
    \ DL processing at fog nodes\nreduces the data volume sent to the cloud, which\
    \ therefore reduces computational overhead at the\ncloud and network. The available\
    \ resource capacities at each fog node commonly have the possibility\nof being\
    \ diﬀerent due to new device installation, execution of extra tasks, received\
    \ data size, and\nnetwork facilities. Considering an environment made up of fog\
    \ nodes with diﬀerences in performance,\nthe DLEFN deﬁnes handling layers for\
    \ DL tasks at each fog node individually. We experimented\nwith and compared the\
    \ proposed DLEFN algorithm and other methods such as simple gateway and\nstatic\
    \ and dynamic layer decisions. The results showed considerable improvement associated\
    \ with\nthe DLEFN compared to existing schemes in the number of accommodated DL\
    \ applications and\nresource utilization at fog nodes. Therefore, we can clearly\
    \ assert that the proposed method eﬀectively\naccommodates more DL applications\
    \ at fog nodes than other methods.\nThe rest of the paper is divided into the\

    \ Review\nDL is a kind of artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) consisting of many layers\
    \ that are used to process\ninput data. ANN is the core technology of DL, inspired\
    \ by the biological neural network of the human\nbrain. An artiﬁcial neuron (AN)\
    \ abstracts the functions of a biological neuron, which consists of a\ndendrite,\
    \ soma, and axon. In a neuron, the dendrite performs the function of receiving\
    \ input signals\nthrough electrical signals; the soma sums up the inputs received\
    \ through the dendrite; and the axon\noutput values are calculated by soma [9].\
    \ Figure 1 illustrates a structure of a biological and an artiﬁcial\nneuron. An\
    \ AN has a limited number of inputs with weights related to them, and an activation\n\
    function. The output of the AN is the result of the activation function applied\
    \ to the weighted sum\nof inputs. ANs are connected with each other to form ANNs\
    \ that have multiple layers, including an\ninput layer, and output layer, and\
    \ at least one more hidden layer [9]. Figure 2 depicts an example of a\nfully\
    \ connected, multiple-layered ANN with n hidden layers. Each layer of an ANN consists\
    \ of ANs,\nand each AN is connected to all the ANs in the next layer. Data move\
    \ from the input layer through the\nhidden layers to the output layer.\nAppl.\

    \ In this platform with its two-layer structure,\nmobile devices were able to\
    \ capably handle a portion of the work on the cloud.\nGupta et al. [15] suggested\
    \ iFogSim to model and simulate an IoT and FC environment. The\nscheme experimented\
    \ with average latency and execution time for controlling a loop of intelligent\n\
    surveillance systems in a cloud and FC environment. The results showed that system\
    \ control was\nmore competent in FC than cloud computing with regards to energy\
    \ and execution time. Liu et al. [16]\nsuggested a food classiﬁcation scheme utilizing\
    \ DL and FC. The scheme reduced the response time\nand power consumption of DL\
    \ applications by sharing works on the FC.\nLavassani et al. [17] suggested a\
    \ new distributed learning model for sensor devices. The proposed\nwork simulated\
    \ the data stream by making a connection with the fog nodes. In order to save\
    \ energy\nand communicate as few packets as possible, the updated parameters of\
    \ the learned model at the\nsensor devices were communicated in longer time intervals\
    \ to the FC system. This framework showed\nthat a combination of fog and cloud\
    \ computing with distributed data modeling at the sensor devices\ncould be advantageous\
    \ for IoT applications. Li et al. [18] suggested a scheduling method that oﬄoads\n\
    a portion of the DL layers to edge servers. Further, the suggested edge computing\
    \ method attempted\nto deﬁne the appropriate layers of the edges for executing\
    \ multiple DL tasks. The DL layers of edges\nwere decided based on the largest\
    \ volumes of incoming data for each task requiring DL, and then set\nup to all\
    \ edge servers.\nDespite the improvements reported in the literature, there is\
    \ still much room for research into\nthe implementation of DL in FC-based IoT\
    \ environments. In general, the available resources of fog\nnode devices are uneven\
    \ in the real world for many reasons, such as incoming data size, establishment\n\
    time, and network infrastructure. Nonetheless, when all fog nodes work their best\
    \ according to each\navailable resource, the burdens of cloud and network traﬃc\
    \ are reduced, and more DL applications\ncan be accommodated in an FC environment.\
    \ Hence, we intended to treat one of the main challenges\nfor implementing DL\
    \ in FC systems, namely the decision of optimal layers despite uneven available\n\
    resource in fog nodes.\n3. Deep Learning in Smart Agriculture\nCurrent smart agriculture\
    \ systems consist of various ICT devices such as a variety of sensors,\nhigh-deﬁnition\
    \ camera devices like CCTVs, autonomous drones, and voice recognition equipment.\n\
    Such devices generate colossal volumes of data that include unstructured multimedia\
    \ data such as\nvideos, images, and sounds as well as structured numerical values\
    \ such as temperature, humidity,\nillumination, and air condition [1]. In smart\
    \ agriculture, the collected data are helpful in making\noptimal decisions for\
    \ facility automation, such as optimal temperature and humidity control, and\n\
    automatic feed supply. Commonly, multimedia data have a larger size than structured\
    \ numeric data.\nMoreover, complicated algorithms are required to obtain the appropriate\
    \ information from large media\ndata. Although generated multimedia data are compressed\
    \ and encoded, audio data in MP3 format\nby CBR (constant bit rate) have a bit\
    \ rate of 320 kbps, and HD video (720p, 60 fps) and FHD video\n(1080p, 60 fps)\
    \ have bit rates of 3500 kbps and 5500 kbps respectively. In a modern IoT environment,\n\
    such colossal multimedia data are ﬂowing into a network continuously. Thus, suﬃcient\
    \ resources like\ncomputing power and bandwidth are essential to execute DL tasks\
    \ such as context awareness from\nvideo data in a real-time environment.\nIn order\
    \ to improve the QoL of farmers, many applications in smart agriculture utilize\
    \ DL tasks for\na variety of tasks, such as commercial value checking for agricultural\
    \ products, condition management\nfor domestic animals, population estimation,\
    \ and security [2,3]. These tasks involve the analysis of\nmultimedia data generated\
    \ by many devices and the extraction of meaningful information to use\nas a basis\
    \ for executing processes of applications. The level of convenience and beneﬁt\
    \ provided to\nusers is determined by the accuracy of the extracted information.\
    \ Accordingly, many studies have\nmade eﬀorts to improve the quality of the information\
    \ obtained through DL processing, such as\nobject recognition, context awareness,\
    \ and character reading. Despite the steady improvement in\nAppl. Sci. 2020, 10,\
    \ 1544\n5 of 16\naccuracy among researched DL technologies with similar purposes,\
    \ handling DL on IoT-based devices\nwith limited energy and computing power remains\
    \ an important challenge [11]. To overcome these\nlimitations, a universal approach\
    \ grafting DL technology onto a cloud service is shown in Figure 3. An\napplication\
    \ collects media data from devices which it can control, and requests analysis\
    \ of the required\ninformation from a cloud server with enough computing power.\
    \ A DL algorithm for application on the\ncloud extracts meaningful information\
    \ from the received data. Subsequently, the information returned\nfrom the cloud\
    \ is used to execute deﬁned functions of the application. Devices transfer data\
    \ to either a\ncloud or a gateway according to network infrastructure. If unable\
    \ to connect to the cloud, devices\ntransfer data to a nearby gateway that can\
    \ forward it to the cloud.\nAppl. Sci. 2020, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n5 of 16 \n\
    To overcome these limitations, a universal approach grafting DL technology onto\
    \ a cloud service is \nshown in Figure 3. An application collects media data from\
    \ devices which it can control, and requests \nanalysis of the required information\
    \ from a cloud server with enough computing power. A DL \nalgorithm for application\
    \ on the cloud extracts meaningful information from the received data. \nSubsequently,\
    \ the information returned from the cloud is used to execute defined functions\
    \ of the \napplication. Devices transfer data to either a cloud or a gateway according\
    \ to network infrastructure. \nIf unable to connect to the cloud, devices transfer\
    \ data to a nearby gateway that can forward it to the \ncloud. \n \nFigure 3.\
    \ Example of deep learning (DL) service grafted onto cloud computing. \nNevertheless,\
    \ in a cloud-based DL environment, there are two issues that require focus, i.e.,\
    \ (1) \nnetwork congestion owing to huge data transfer and (2) intensive burden\
    \ of cloud servers [19]. Even \nin the cases of intermediate gateways being used\
    \ to forward data, they demand a very high \nbandwidth to correspond to all data\
    \ gathered from related devices. Additionally, cloud servers with \nhigh performance\
    \ also have limitations in terms of simultaneous execution of many DL tasks with\
    \ \nhuge data [20]. Namely, these two issues raise the possibility of response\
    \ relay. However, it is worth \nnoting that even a small delay can cause economic\
    \ losses in smart farms dealing with fields of \nautomation such as production,\
    \ sales, growth, management, and security. \n4. Proposed Solution \n4.1. Deep\

    \ of that layer. Thus, a greater\nnumber of DL layers can output more valuable\

    \ DLEFN focuses on deﬁning the maximum\nnumber of DL layers for each fog node\

    \ connected to a fog node i related to task tn, the ﬁrst procedure calculates\
    \ the\ncomputational capacity required to handle the incoming data and the bandwidth\
    \ that ensures QoS\nwhen transferring the intermediate result to cloud, and then\
    \ decides the maximum number of layers\nthat the fog node i can execute within\

    \ minimum layer or more for\nDL tasks. Deﬁning maximum layers is tried for all\
    \ tasks belonging to the new application in each fog\nnode individually.\nDuring\
    \ the above process for all tasks of a new application, if available computational\
    \ capacity in\nfog node i is insuﬃcient, the fog node reduces the already deﬁned\

    \ a set of tasks assigned higher\nlayers than the compulsory minimum layer deﬁned\

    the fog node regains its available capacity corresponding to the decreased loads.\
    \ In contrast, more\nbandwidth will be required due to the larger number of intermediate\

    \ of DL applications accepted in the methods mentioned in the previous\nsection.\
    \ The method supported by cloud only recorded the lowest number of allowed applications,\
    \ due\nto insuﬃcient bandwidth caused by the huge volumes of original data. Since\
    \ this method processed\noriginal data without support by fog nodes, the comparison\
    \ was unfair. Nevertheless, this result shows\nthe necessity of fog computing\
    \ in modern IoT environments that generate colossal volumes of data. The\nmethod\
    \ of deﬁning ﬁxed layers for all tasks steadily allowed up to 160 applications.\
    \ However, it could\nnot accommodate any further applications. Despite being a\
    \ simple algorithm that supports all tasks\nequally, this method allowed many\
    \ more applications than processing the applications on the cloud\nonly. In the\
    \ oﬄine method, all application tasks are arranged in ascending order of incoming\
    \ average\ndata size before implementing the algorithm. For that reason, the oﬄine\
    \ method steadily allowed up\nto around 250. The online algorithm utilizes historic\
    \ data recorded by executing the oﬄine algorithm\nin a real-time environment.\
    \ Although the online algorithm recorded fewer allowed applications than\nthe\
    \ oﬄine algorithm, the result was relatively higher than the methods supported\
    \ by cloud only or by\nﬁxed layers. In contrast, the proposed DLEFN continuously\
    \ accommodated applications despite the\nexhausted resources on all fog nodes,\
    \ by ﬁrst considering maximum resource utilization within fog\nnodes and comparing\
    \ new applications and allowed applications to decide replacements for better\n\
    eﬃciency. At the end, the DLEFN allowed highest number of applications requiring\
    \ DL.\nAppl. Sci. 2020, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n13 of 16 \nconsidering maximum\

    \ 10 shows the change of average available bandwidth and computational capacity\

    \ As Figure 10a indicates, \nthe final residual bandwidth on the network was significantly\
    \ different for each algorithm. \nNonetheless, the overall resources of all fog\
    \ nodes were virtually exhausted by the proposed DLEFN, \nas shown in Figure 10b.\
    \ In actuality, the proposed method was designed to utilize maximum \nresources\
    \ at each fog node, although each node had different available resources. Consequently,\
    \ fog \nnodes dealt with the optimal DL layer according to their available resources\
    \ and tried to reduce the \nnumber of intermediate results. Therefore, the DLEFN\
    \ gave a chance to more applications requiring \nDL service within given resources,\
    \ as shown in Figures 9 and 10, since the proposed algorithm saved \nmore available\
    \ bandwidths than other methods even after allowing the largest number of \napplications.\
    \ Accordingly, we can claim that the proposed method successfully minimized \n\
    intermediate results being delivered to the cloud in an FC-based smart agriculture\
    \ environment. As \na result, decreased network congestion and computational loads\
    \ on the cloud ensured better QoS. \nFigure 9. Number of allowed DL applications\

    \ of multimedia data gathered by IoT devices in modern smart agriculture are\n\
    utilized to improve QoL of farmers. DL has come to the fore as a group of important\
    \ techniques\nwith which to pick out useful information from huge volumes of data.\
    \ Nevertheless, supporting DL\non IoT devices is constrained by their restricted\
    \ resources and energy. Generally, cloud computing\nhas been regarded as a universal\
    \ approach to this issue. However, there is concern about service\ndelay by network\
    \ congestion caused by huge data volumes generated constantly by modern IoT\n\
    infrastructures. Hence, we proposed a DLEFN algorithm that performs some DL tasks\
    \ on fog nodes\nin an FC environment. The proposed method aimed to accommodate\
    \ the maximum number of\napplications requiring DL service by using the maximum\
    \ available resources of fog nodes, and to\nreduce network traﬃc and burden on\
    \ the cloud. Accordingly, the DLEFN was designed to decide\nthe optimal layers\
    \ of DL model for application tasks for each fog node, in order to accommodate\
    \ the\nmaximum number of DL applications. The algorithm decided the appropriate\
    \ layers of DL model for\neach fog node, taking into account its available bandwidth\
    \ and computational capacity. The evaluated\nresults were compared with existing\
    \ methods in the same experimental environment and indicated\nconsiderable improvements\
    \ regarding bandwidth eﬃciency, capacity eﬃciency, number of allowed DL\napplications,\
    \ and cloud overhead. Considerable gains of performance proved the positive eﬀect\
    \ of\nindividual decision-making about available resources of fog nodes. Therefore,\
    \ as a solution among\nexisting issues, the proposed algorithm excellently supported\
    \ fog nodes with dissimilar resource\ncapacities. Finally, we can clearly claim\
    \ that the proposed DLEFN algorithm is an eﬃcient scheme\nto graft DL onto FC-based\
    \ smart agriculture environments to enable eﬃcient service without service\ndelays\
    \ due to network congestion.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, K.L., B.N.S.\

    \ \n1. Introduction\nSmart farming, also known as precision agriculture, is an\
    \ innovative approach to agricultural practices that leverages \nadvanced technologies\
    \ to optimize efficiency, productivity, and sustainability in farming operations\
    \ [1]-[4]. As shown \nin Fig. 1, it involves the integration of various technologies,\
    \ such as Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), \ndata analytics,\
    \ robotics, and remote sensing, to make informed decisions and automate processes\
    \ in agricultural \nsystems. The primary goal of smart farming is to enhance crop\
    \ production, minimize resource waste, reduce \nenvironmental impact, and improve\
    \ overall profitability. By utilizing a network of interconnected devices and\
    \ sensors \n[5], farmers can collect real-time data on various factors such as\
    \ soil moisture levels, weather conditions, crop health, \nand pest infestations.\
    \ This data is then analyzed to provide actionable insights, allowing farmers\
    \ to make data-driven \ndecisions and implement precise interventions [6]-[8].\
    \ \nOne of the key components of smart farming is the use of IoT devices and sensors.\
    \ These devices are deployed \nthroughout the farmland to monitor and control\
    \ different variables [8]-[11]. For instance, soil moisture sensors can \nprovide\
    \ information about the water requirements of crops, enabling farmers to apply\
    \ water precisely where and when \nit is needed, reducing water wastage. Similarly,\
    \ weather stations and satellite imagery can offer accurate and localized \nweather\
    \ data, helping farmers optimize planting schedules and manage crop diseases.\
    \ \nAccording to [12], artificial intelligence plays a crucial role in smart farming\
    \ by analyzing the collected data and \nproviding intelligent recommendations.\
    \ Machine learning algorithms can identify patterns and correlations in the data,\
    \ \nenabling predictive models for crop growth, pest outbreaks, and yield estimation\
    \ [13]-[16]. This information assists \nfarmers in making informed decisions regarding\
    \ the optimal use of fertilizers, pesticides, and other inputs, leading to \n\
    improved resource management and reduced environmental impact. As explained in\
    \ [17], robots and drones can be \nWorld Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews,\
    \ 2023, 18(03), 1207–1231 \n1208 \nutilized in smart farming to automate labor-intensive\
    \ tasks. Robots can perform activities like seeding, weeding, and \nharvesting\
    \ with precision and efficiency, reducing the need for manual labor and increasing\
    \ productivity [18]-[20]. As \nshown in Fig.2, drones equipped with cameras and\
    \ sensors [21] can gather high-resolution images and collect data over \nlarge\
    \ areas, helping farmers monitor crop health, detect early signs of diseases or\
    \ nutrient deficiencies, and identify \nareas requiring attention. \n \nFigure\
    \ 1 Typical smart agriculture scenario \n \nFigure 2 Drones in smart agriculture\
    \ \nResearchers in [22] point out that smart agriculture relies on various sensors\
    \ to collect real-time data about \nenvironmental conditions, crop health, soil\
    \ characteristics, and livestock parameters. These sensors provide critical \n\
    insights that enable farmers to make informed decisions and optimize farming practices.\
    \ As shown in Fig. 3, examples \nof sensors commonly used in smart agriculture\
    \ include weather sensors, soil moisture sensors, soil pH sensors, nutrient \n\
    sensors, crop health sensors, light sensors, livestock monitoring sensors, water\
    \ quality sensors, gas sensors and insect \ntraps sensors. Here, weather sensors\
    \ measure atmospheric conditions such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind\
    \ \nspeed, and solar radiation [23]–[26]. They help farmers understand weather\
    \ patterns, predict storms, and optimize \nirrigation schedules based on evapo-transpiration\
    \ rates. On the other hand, soil moisture sensors measure the water \ncontent\
    \ in the soil, allowing farmers to monitor [27] soil moisture levels and determine\
    \ irrigation needs. These sensors \nhelp prevent overwatering or underwatering,\
    \ optimize water usage, and prevent water stress in crops. However, soil \npH\
    \ sensors measure the acidity or alkalinity of the soil. By monitoring soil pH,\
    \ farmers can determine the soil's nutrient \navailability and adjust soil amendments\
    \ accordingly [28]. Maintaining optimal pH levels is crucial for healthy plant\
    \ \ngrowth and nutrient uptake. As explained in [29], nutrient sensors measure\
    \ the concentration of essential nutrients in \nthe soil, such as nitrogen, phosphorus,\
    \ and potassium. These sensors provide valuable data for precise fertilizer \n\
    application, ensuring that crops receive the right amount of nutrients for optimal\
    \ growth and yield. On the other hand, \ncrop health sensors detect indicators\
    \ of plant stress, diseases, and pests [30]. They can measure parameters such\
    \ as leaf \ntemperature, chlorophyll content, and vegetation indices to assess\
    \ crop health and detect early signs of disease or pest \ninfestation. This data\
    \ helps farmers take timely preventive measures and implement targeted pest management\
    \ \nWorld Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews, 2023, 18(03), 1207–1231 \n\
    1209 \nstrategies. On their part, light sensors measure the intensity and quality\
    \ of light in the crop canopy [31]. They provide \ninformation about photosynthetic\
    \ activity, plant growth stages, and light requirements. This data helps optimize\
    \ \nlighting conditions in controlled environment agriculture (CEA) systems, such\
    \ as greenhouses or vertical farms. On the \nother hand, livestock monitoring\
    \ sensors are used to track parameters related to animal health and well-being\
    \ [32]. For \nexample, temperature sensors [33] can monitor body temperature,\
    \ activity sensors can track animal movement, and \nrumen pH sensors can assess\
    \ digestive health in ruminant animals. Livestock sensors enable early detection\
    \ of health \nissues and support proactive animal management. \n \nFigure 3 Smart\
    \ agriculture \nWater quality sensors measure parameters such as pH, dissolved\
    \ oxygen, conductivity, and turbidity in irrigation water \nsources or aquaculture\
    \ systems [34]. Monitoring water quality ensures that crops or aquatic organisms\
    \ receive clean \nand suitable water, preventing adverse effects on plant health\
    \ or aquatic ecosystems. However, gas sensors detect and \nmeasure the concentration\
    \ of gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) or ethylene, which are important indicators\
    \ of plant \nrespiration and ripening processes [35]. Gas sensors can be used\
    \ to optimize storage conditions and shelf life of \nharvested crops. On their\
    \ part, insect traps equipped with sensors and lures capture and monitor insect\
    \ populations \n[36]. These sensors help farmers assess pest infestation levels,\
    \ identify specific pest species, and implement targeted \npest management strategies.\
    \ These sensors, among others, provide critical data points that enable farmers\
    \ to monitor \nand manage agricultural systems effectively. Integrating sensor\
    \ data with advanced analytics and decision support \nsystems empowers farmers\
    \ to optimize resource allocation, improve crop yields, and make informed decisions\
    \ for \nsustainable and efficient farming practices. \nIn a nutshell, smart farming\
    \ holds great promise for transforming agriculture into a more sustainable and\
    \ productive \nindustry. By harnessing the power of technology and data, farmers\
    \ can optimize their operations, improve crop yields, \nconserve resources, minimize\
    \ environmental impact, and contribute to global food security in a rapidly evolving\
    \ world.  \nIn this paper, an extensive review of the current status of smart\
    \ agriculture technologies and their security posture is \ngiven. Towards the\
    \ end of this paper, some research gaps are identified which needs to be filled\
    \ by future researches.  \n2. Need for smart agriculture \nSmart agriculture,\
    \ or precision agriculture, is increasingly becoming a necessity due to several\
    \ pressing challenges and \nneeds in the agricultural sector. Table 1 discusses\
    \ some key reasons why smart agriculture is crucial. \n \n \nWorld Journal of\
    \ Advanced Research and Reviews, 2023, 18(03), 1207–1231 \n1210 \nTable 1 Necessity\
    \ of smart agriculture \nNecessity \nDiscussion \nResource Scarcity \nResources\
    \ such as water, land, and energy are limited and face increasing pressure due\
    \ to \npopulation growth and climate change [37]. Smart agriculture enables precise\
    \ resource \nmanagement, minimizing waste and maximizing the efficient [38] use\
    \ of inputs like water, \nfertilizers, and energy. \nCost Optimization \nTraditional\
    \ farming practices often involve overuse or misuse of inputs, leading to higher\
    \ \ncosts [39]. Smart agriculture allows farmers to make data-driven decisions,\
    \ optimizing the \nuse of fertilizers, pesticides, and water, thereby reducing\
    \ costs and increasing profitability \n[40]. \nLabor Efficiency and \nSafety \n\
    Farm labor shortages are a significant challenge in many regions. Smart agriculture\
    \ \nintroduces automation and robotics, reducing the reliance on manual labor\
    \ for tasks such \nas planting, weeding, and harvesting. This not only improves\
    \ efficiency [43] but also \nenhances worker safety by minimizing exposure to\
    \ hazardous conditions. \nClimate Change and \nEnvironmental \nSustainability\
    \ \nClimate change impacts agriculture through extreme weather events, changing\
    \ rainfall \npatterns, and the spread of pests and diseases. Smart agriculture\
    \ helps farmers adapt to \nclimate change by providing real-time data on weather\
    \ conditions, enabling timely \ninterventions, and reducing environmental impact\
    \ through optimized resource usage [44], \n[45]. \nTraceability \nand \nQuality\
    \ Assurance \nConsumers are increasingly concerned about the origin and quality\
    \ of the food they \nconsume [46], [47]. Smart agriculture technologies enable\
    \ improved traceability [48], \nallowing farmers to track the entire supply chain,\
    \ ensure food safety, and provide \ntransparent information to consumers. \nData-Driven\
    \ Decision \nMaking \nSmart agriculture generates vast amounts of data through\
    \ sensors, drones, and satellite \nimagery [49], [50]. Analyzing this data using\
    \ AI and data analytics helps farmers gain \nvaluable insights, make informed\
    \ decisions, and optimize farming practices for better \noutcomes [51]. \nPopulation\
    \ \nGrowth \nand Food Demand \nThe global population is projected to reach 9.7\
    \ billion by 2050, which will significantly \nincrease the demand for food. Smart\
    \ agriculture offers a way to increase agricultural \nproductivity and efficiency\
    \ to meet this growing demand [52]. \nCrop Monitoring and \nManagement \nSmart\
    \ agriculture technologies enable continuous monitoring [53] of crops, including\
    \ \nfactors like soil moisture, temperature, and nutrient levels. This data-driven\
    \ approach helps \nfarmers detect crop stress, diseases, and nutrient deficiencies\
    \ early on, allowing timely \ninterventions and reducing crop losses [54], [55].\
    \ \n \nBasically, the need for smart agriculture arises from the need to address\
    \ challenges such as population growth, resource \nscarcity, climate change, cost\
    \ optimization, and labor efficiency. By integrating advanced technologies, smart\
    \ agriculture \noffers the potential to transform traditional farming practices\
    \ into more sustainable, productive, and environmentally \nfriendly systems. \n\
    2.1. Technologies driving smart agriculture \nSmart agriculture is driven by various\
    \ technologies that enable advanced monitoring, automation, and decision-making\
    \ \nin agricultural practices. These technologies play a crucial role in optimizing\
    \ resource management, improving crop \nyields, and enhancing overall efficiency\
    \ in farming operations. Some of the prominent key driving technologies in smart\
    \ \nagriculture are presented in Fig. 4 and are discussed in the sub-sections\
    \ below. \n2.1.1. Internet of Things (IoT) \nIoT technology forms the backbone\
    \ of smart agriculture by connecting physical devices and sensors to the internet,\
    \ \nenabling data collection and remote monitoring [56]-[58]. IoT devices such\
    \ as weather stations, soil moisture sensors, \nand crop health sensors provide\
    \ real-time data on environmental conditions, plant growth, and livestock health.\

    \ As \nthese technologies continue to advance, they hold immense potential to\
    \ address the global challenges of food security, \nsustainable agriculture, and\
    \ environmental conservation. \n3. General challenges in smart agriculture \n\
    Although smart agriculture brings numerous benefits, there are several challenges\
    \ that need to be addressed for its \nwidespread adoption and successful implementation.\
    \ Some of the general challenges in smart agriculture are described \nin the sub-sections\
    \ below. \n3.1.1.  High Initial Investment \nThe upfront costs of implementing\
    \ smart agriculture technologies can be a significant barrier for many farmers,\
    \ \nespecially small-scale and resource-constrained operations. The cost of purchasing\
    \ and installing sensors, IoT devices, \ndrones, robotics, and data management\
    \ systems can be prohibitive [86], [87]. Governments, organizations, and \nstakeholders\
    \ need to provide financial support, incentives, and subsidies to make these technologies\
    \ more accessible. \n3.1.2. Limited Technical Expertise \nSmart agriculture requires\
    \ a certain level of technical expertise in areas such as data analytics, AI,\
    \ and IoT [88]-[91]. \nHowever, many farmers may lack the necessary knowledge\
    \ and skills to effectively implement and utilize these \ntechnologies. Training\
    \ programs, workshops, and educational initiatives are crucial to bridge this\
    \ knowledge gap and \nempower farmers to leverage smart agriculture solutions\
    \ effectively. \n3.1.3. Connectivity and Infrastructure \nSmart agriculture heavily\
    \ relies on reliable and high-speed internet connectivity, especially in rural\
    \ areas [92]. However, \nin some regions, internet infrastructure is inadequate\
    \ or nonexistent. Poor connectivity can hinder real-time data \ncollection, remote\
    \ monitoring [93], and the seamless operation of IoT devices [94], [95]. Governments\
    \ and private \nstakeholders must invest in improving rural connectivity to ensure\
    \ widespread adoption of smart agriculture. \n3.1.4. Data Privacy and Security\
    \ \nSmart agriculture involves the collection, storage, and analysis of vast amounts\
    \ of data, including sensitive information \nabout crops, farms, and farmers [96]-[99].\
    \ Ensuring data privacy and security is paramount to protect farmers' and \nconsumers'\
    \ interests. Strong data encryption, secure cloud storage, and robust cybersecurity\
    \ measures must be \nimplemented to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches,\
    \ and misuse of information. \n3.1.5. Data Interoperability and Integration \n\
    Smart agriculture systems often involve multiple technologies and platforms, which\
    \ may use different data formats and \nprotocols [100]-[104]. Ensuring seamless\
    \ data interoperability and integration across various systems can be \nchallenging.\
    \ Standardization of data formats, open APIs (Application Programming Interfaces),\
    \ and data-sharing \nprotocols are essential for efficient data exchange and collaboration\
    \ between different smart agriculture solutions. \n3.1.6. Adoption and User Acceptance\
    \ \nFarmers may be resistant to change or skeptical about adopting new technologies.\
    \ Lack of awareness, concerns about \ntechnology reliability, and the perceived\
    \ complexity of smart agriculture solutions can hinder adoption rates [105]-\n\
    [109]. Demonstrating the tangible benefits, providing training and support, and\
    \ showcasing successful case studies are \ncrucial to building trust and encouraging\
    \ widespread adoption. \n3.1.7. Data Management and Analysis \nSmart agriculture\
    \ generates large volumes of data, and effectively managing, analyzing, and interpreting\
    \ this data can \nbe overwhelming [110]-[114]. Farmers need user-friendly data\
    \ management tools and analytics platforms that can \nprocess and present data\
    \ in a meaningful way, providing actionable insights. Simplified data visualization,\
    \ user-friendly \ninterfaces, and user training can help farmers effectively utilize\
    \ the data generated. \nWorld Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews, 2023,\
    \ 18(03), 1207–1231 \n1213 \n3.1.8. Regulatory and Policy Frameworks \nAs smart\
    \ agriculture involves the use of new technologies, regulatory frameworks need\
    \ to keep pace with these \nadvancements. Issues related to data ownership, data\
    \ sharing, privacy regulations, and standardization should be \naddressed through\
    \ appropriate policies [115]-[117]. Governments need to establish clear guidelines\
    \ and regulations to \nensure ethical and responsible use of smart agriculture\
    \ technologies. \nBy addressing these challenges, stakeholders can promote the\
    \ adoption of smart agriculture and leverage its potential \nto revolutionize\
    \ the agricultural sector, improve productivity, and achieve sustainable and efficient\
    \ food production. \n3.2. Security issues in smart agriculture \nSmart agriculture,\
    \ like any other technological system, is susceptible to various security issues\
    \ that need to be addressed \nto ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability\
    \ of data and operations [118], [119]. Fig. 5 shows the various \nlayers of the\
    \ smart agriculture environment. \n \nFigure 5 Smart agriculture environment layers\
    \ \nAccording to [120], some of these security issues specific to smart agriculture\
    \ include unauthorized access, data privacy \nand confidentiality, data integrity,\
    \ network security, device security, physical security, supply chain security,\
    \ as well as \nawareness and training. Fig. 6 shows the layered depiction of these\
    \ smart agriculture security challenges. Unauthorized \nindividuals gaining access\
    \ to smart agriculture systems can disrupt operations, manipulate data, or even\
    \ cause physical \ndamage [122]-[123]. It is crucial to implement strong access\
    \ controls, such as secure authentication mechanisms, to \nprevent unauthorized\
    \ access to devices, networks, and data [124]. On the other hand, authors in [125]\
    \ explain that \nsmart agriculture involves the collection and storage of sensitive\
    \ data, including farm management information, crop \nyields, and farmer details.\
    \ Ensuring data privacy and confidentiality is essential to protect farmers' and\
    \ consumers' \ninterests. Robust encryption techniques, secure storage, and proper\
    \ data access controls should be implemented to \nsafeguard sensitive information\
    \ [126]-[129]. In addition, maintaining the integrity of data is crucial in smart\
    \ agriculture \nsystems. This is because any unauthorized modification, tampering,\
    \ or corruption of data can lead to incorrect decisions \nand impact the overall\
    \ farming operations. Implementing data validation mechanisms, digital signatures,\
    \ and secure \ncommunication channels can help ensure data integrity [130]-[134].\
    \ As explained in [135], smart agriculture systems \nrely on networks and communication\
    \ channels for data transmission. These networks are vulnerable to various threats\
    \ \nWorld Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews, 2023, 18(03), 1207–1231 \n\
    1214 \nsuch as eavesdropping, data interception, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks\
    \ [136]-[139]. Implementing secure \nnetwork protocols, firewalls, intrusion detection\
    \ systems, and regular network monitoring are essential to protect \nagainst network-based\
    \ attacks. \n \nFigure 6 Layered security challenges in smart agriculture \nIoT\
    \ devices, sensors, and actuators play a significant role in smart agriculture\
    \ [140]-[144]. However, these devices can \nbe potential entry points for attackers.\
    \ Ensuring the security of these devices through measures like strong \nauthentication,\
    \ regular firmware updates, and secure configurations is crucial to prevent unauthorized\
    \ access and \ncompromise of the entire system. Researchers in [145] discuss that\
    \ smart agriculture systems may include physical \ninfrastructure like weather\
    \ stations, drones, and robots. Securing these physical assets from theft, vandalism,\
    \ or \nphysical tampering is vital. Implementing access controls, surveillance\
    \ systems, and physical barriers can help protect \nthe physical components of\
    \ smart agriculture. On their part, the authors in [146] argue that smart agriculture\
    \ systems \nrely on various vendors and suppliers for hardware, software, and\
    \ services. Ensuring the security of the entire supply \nchain is crucial to prevent\
    \ the introduction of compromised or malicious components [147], [148]. Conducting\
    \ thorough \nvendor assessments, implementing secure development practices, and\
    \ performing regular security audits are important \nfor maintaining a secure\
    \ supply chain. In addition, human error and lack of awareness can contribute\
    \ to security \nvulnerabilities [149]. Farmers and operators should receive proper\
    \ training and awareness programs to understand \nsecurity best practices, identify\
    \ potential threats, and respond to security incidents promptly. \nAddressing\
    \ these security issues requires a multi-layered approach that combines technical\
    \ controls, policies, training, \nand regular security assessments. Collaboration\
    \ between farmers, technology providers, and cybersecurity experts is \ncrucial\
    \ to identify and mitigate security risks, ensuring the safe and secure implementation\
    \ of smart agriculture systems. \n4. Ways of securing smart agriculture \nSecuring\
    \ smart agriculture systems involves implementing various techniques and best\
    \ practices to protect data, \ndevices, and infrastructure. Table 2 describes\
    \ some techniques for securing smart agriculture. \nTable 2 Techniques for securing\
    \ smart agriculture \nTechnique \nDescription \nStrong Authentication \nand Access\
    \ Controls \nImplement robust authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor\
    \ authentication, to \nensure that only authorized individuals can access the\
    \ smart agriculture system [150]-\n[154]. Additionally, enforce strict access\
    \ controls to limit privileges and restrict access to \nsensitive data and critical\
    \ functionalities. \nRegular Patching and \nUpdates \nKeep all software, firmware,\
    \ and operating systems up to date with the latest security \npatches [155]-[158].\
    \ Regularly update IoT devices, sensors, and other components to \naddress any\
    \ known vulnerabilities [159] and ensure that they are running on the most \n\
    secure versions. \nWorld Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews, 2023, 18(03),\
    \ 1207–1231 \n1215 \nNetwork Segmentation \nSegment the smart agriculture network\
    \ into different zones or subnets to separate critical \ncomponents, such as IoT\
    \ devices, sensors, and data storage systems [160]-[163]. This helps \ncontain\
    \ security breaches and limits unauthorized access to sensitive areas of the network.\
    \ \nSecure Communication \nChannels \n \nUse secure protocols and encryption techniques\
    \ (e.g., SSL/TLS) to ensure the \nconfidentiality and integrity of data transmitted\
    \ between devices, sensors, and the central \nsystem [164]-[168]. Secure communication\
    \ channels prevent eavesdropping, data \ninterception, and tampering during data\
    \ transmission. \nPhysical \nSecurity \nMeasures \nSecure physical components\
    \ of smart agriculture systems, including weather stations, \ndrones, and robots,\
    \ to prevent theft, tampering, or unauthorized access [169]. Implement \nphysical\
    \ barriers, surveillance systems, and access controls to protect physical assets\
    \ \n[170]-[173]. \nEmployee Training and \nAwareness \nProvide comprehensive training\
    \ programs to farmers, operators, and other stakeholders \nto raise awareness\
    \ about security best practices, social engineering threats, and safe \nhandling\
    \ of data and devices. Educate users about potential risks and how to identify\
    \ and \nreport security incidents [174]. \nSecurity \nMonitoring \nand Incident\
    \ Response \nImplement robust monitoring tools and techniques to continuously\
    \ monitor the smart \nagriculture system for potential security incidents [175].\
    \ Establish an incident response \nplan to handle security breaches, including\
    \ procedures for investigation, containment, \neradication, and recovery [176]-[178].\
    \ \nIntrusion \nDetection \nand \nPrevention \nSystems \nDeploy intrusion detection\
    \ and prevention systems (IDPS) to monitor network traffic, \ndetect suspicious\
    \ activities, and prevent potential attacks [179], [180]. IDPS can identify \n\
    and respond to malicious behavior, such as unauthorized access [181] attempts\
    \ or \nabnormal data patterns. \nData Encryption and \nPrivacy \n \nImplement\
    \ strong encryption algorithms to protect sensitive data both at rest and in \n\
    transit. Encrypt data stored on devices, databases, and cloud storage to prevent\
    \ \nunauthorized access [182]-[186]. Also, ensure compliance with privacy regulations\
    \ and \nestablish clear policies on data handling and sharing. \nRegular \nSecurity\
    \ \nAssessments \nConduct regular security assessments, penetration testing, and\
    \ vulnerability scanning to \nidentify and address any potential weaknesses in\
    \ the smart agriculture system [187]-[191]. \nRegular assessments help ensure\
    \ that security measures are up to date and effective in \nprotecting against\
    \ emerging threats. \n \nBy implementing these techniques, smart agriculture systems\
    \ can significantly enhance their security posture and \nprotect against potential\
    \ threats, ensuring the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data and\
    \ operations. \n5. Issues with current smart agriculture protection techniques\
    \ \nThere are several protection techniques available for securing smart agriculture\
    \ systems. However, there are still some \nissues and challenges associated with\
    \ their implementation. The following sub-sections discuss some common issues\
    \ \nwith current smart agriculture protection techniques. \n5.1 Lack of Standardization\
    \ \nThe smart agriculture industry lacks standardized security protocols and frameworks,\
    \ making it challenging to ensure \nconsistent and interoperable security measures\
    \ across different systems and devices [192], [193]. The absence of \nwidely accepted\
    \ standards hinders seamless integration and can lead to compatibility issues\
    \ when implementing \nsecurity solutions. \n5.2 Limited Security Awareness and\
    \ Expertise \nMany farmers and agricultural professionals may have limited knowledge\
    \ and awareness of cybersecurity risks and \nbest practices. The lack of security\
    \ expertise among end-users can result in improper implementation of security\
    \ \nmeasures, such as weak passwords, misconfigurations, or failure to update\
    \ software/firmware promptly [194], [195]. \nWorld Journal of Advanced Research\
    \ and Reviews, 2023, 18(03), 1207–1231 \n1216 \n5.3 Vulnerabilities in IoT Devices\
    \ \nIoT devices used in smart agriculture systems may have inherent security vulnerabilities\
    \ [196]. These vulnerabilities \ncan be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized\
    \ access, manipulate data, or disrupt operations [196]-[199]. The rapid \nproliferation\
    \ of IoT devices and their diverse manufacturers make it challenging to ensure\
    \ consistent security standards \nacross all devices. \n5.4 Complexity and Cost\
    \ \nImplementing comprehensive security measures can be complex and expensive\
    \ for farmers, particularly small-scale \noperations with limited budgets. The\
    \ costs associated with purchasing, deploying, and maintaining security solutions\
    \ \ncan be prohibitive, deterring widespread adoption of robust security measures\
    \ [200], [201]. \n5.5 Legacy Systems and Infrastructure \nMany agricultural systems\
    \ still rely on legacy equipment and infrastructure that may not have built-in\
    \ security features \nor support modern security protocols [202], [203]. Integrating\
    \ security solutions with existing legacy systems can be \nchallenging and may\
    \ require additional investments in upgrading or replacing outdated components\
    \ [204]. \n5.6 Lack of Security Updates and Support \nSome smart agriculture solutions\
    \ may lack regular security updates and ongoing support from vendors [205]-[207].\
    \ \nThis can leave systems vulnerable to emerging threats, as security patches\
    \ and updates are essential for addressing \nnewly discovered vulnerabilities\
    \ and ensuring the long-term security of the system. \n5.7 Physical Security Risks\
    \ \nWhile digital security is crucial, physical security risks in smart agriculture\
    \ systems cannot be overlooked [209], [210]. \nComponents such as sensors, drones,\
    \ or weather stations are vulnerable to physical tampering, theft, or damage.\
    \ \nEnsuring adequate physical security measures, such as access controls and\
    \ surveillance, is essential but can be \nchallenging in remote or expansive farming\
    \ environments. \n5.8 Integration and Compatibility Challenges \nSmart agriculture\
    \ systems often involve the integration of various technologies, platforms, and\
    \ third-party solutions. \nEnsuring seamless integration and compatibility between\
    \ different components can be complex, as they may have \ndifferent security requirements,\
    \ protocols, or interfaces [211]-[214]. Incompatibility issues can create security\
    \ gaps and \nincrease the risk of vulnerabilities. \nAddressing these issues requires\
    \ collaborative efforts between technology providers, agricultural stakeholders,\
    \ and \npolicymakers. It involves promoting security standards and best practices,\
    \ providing security training and awareness \nprograms, encouraging security-by-design\
    \ principles in IoT device manufacturing, and fostering partnerships to \ndevelop\
    \ cost-effective security solutions tailored for the agricultural sector [215]-[219].\
    \ \n6. Future research scope \nBased on the shortcomings of the current smart\
    \ agriculture defense mechanisms, future research can explore several \nareas\
    \ to enhance the protection of agricultural systems and address emerging challenges.\
    \ Some potential research \nscopes include the following: \n6.1 Threat Modeling\

    \ \nprotocols and frameworks, limited security awareness and expertise among farmers,\
    \ and vulnerabilities in IoT devices \nhave been shown to be major concerns. Additionally,\
    \ the complexity and cost associated with implementing \ncomprehensive security\
    \ measures, legacy systems and infrastructure, and the need for regular security\
    \ updates and \nsupport pose additional challenges. Physical security risks and\
    \ integration and compatibility issues further compound \nthe security landscape\
    \ of smart agriculture. To overcome these challenges, future research and development\
    \ efforts \nshould focus on threat modeling, risk assessment, blockchain technology,\

    \ It is crucial to develop and \nimplement robust security measures, promote security\
    \ standards and best practices, provide security training and \nawareness programs,\
    \ and foster partnerships to develop cost-effective security solutions tailored\
    \ for the agricultural \nsector. By addressing these security issues comprehensively,\
    \ we can ensure the trustworthiness, resilience, and \nsustainability of smart\
    \ agriculture systems, thereby unlocking their full potential to revolutionize\
    \ the agricultural \nindustry, improve productivity, and contribute to global\
    \ food security. \nCompliance with ethical standards \nAcknowledgments \nAll the\

    \ is expected to increase considerably, reflecting the predicted increase in \n\
    global population. In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where it is reported that one\
    \ in four people remain \nmalnourished and the population is predicted to double\
    \ by 2050, achieving food security in terms of \nquantity and quality is an immense\
    \ challenge. Conversely, in SSA, agricultural production potential \nhas not been\
    \ fully realized owing to poor soil fertility and adverse environmental conditions.\
    \ \nMoreover, these regions are vulnerable to climate change and infectious diseases.\
    \ The second goal \nof the 17 sustainable development goals calls on all nations\
    \ to achieve “Zero Hunger.” Through \njoint research, the Food Security in Africa\
    \ project by the Japan International Research Center for \nAgricultural Sciences\
    \ has promoted sustainable technology development to improve food security \n\
    in SSA in three focus areas: enhanced rice production, utilization of regional\
    \ crops, and effective \nresource utilization under integrated crop–livestock\
    \ systems. In this review, we introduce the \ntechnical challenges and problems\
    \ of agriculture in SSA, explain the project’s efforts to address \nthem, and\
    \ discuss future prospects. We believe that all diverse stakeholders involved\
    \ need to continue \nto work together to contribute to the maintenance of food\
    \ and nutrient supply in SSA.\nDiscipline: Crop Science\nAdditional key words:\

    \ et al.\n2017). The limited agriculture production in this region is \ncomplicated\
    \ by a number of factors, such as soil nutrient \ndeficiencies, soil physical\
    \ constraints, damage from pests \nand diseases, and suboptimal management systems\
    \ (Giller \net al. 2009, Hengl et al. 2017). Although the proportion of \narable\
    \ land in SSA has been steadily expanding since the \n1950s, crop yields have\
    \ remained low (Jayne et al. 2010). \nFurthermore, the region is vulnerable to\
    \ climate change. \nUnder such circumstances, in 2016, the second goal of \nthe\
    \ 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) called on \nall nations to “end hunger,\
    \ achieve food security and \nimproved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture.”\n\
    The Japan International Research Center for \nAgricultural Sciences (JIRCAS) has\
    \ been pursuing \nthe development of suitable technologies to increase \nagricultural\
    \ productivity and improve food security by \npromoting international collaborative\
    \ research with \nrelated organizations in Japan and overseas. Since 2016, \n\
    JIRCAS has initiated one of its flagship projects—Food \nSecurity in Africa—targeting\
    \ SSA in three focus areas: \nenhancement of rice production, regional crop utilization,\
    \ \nand crop–livestock integration. These three focus \nareas were carefully selected\
    \ according to the research \nspecialties of JIRCAS and the local demands. In\
    \ Africa, \nto meet the rapid increase in rice consumption in urban \nareas and\
    \ rice imports, there is an urgent need to increase \nrice production in countries\
    \ with large demand for rice \nto increase food production and save foreign currency.\
    \ \nHowever, the amount of rice imported from overseas, \nsuch as Thailand, remains\
    \ to be in large quantities. \nCompared with the important commodities in SSA\
    \ \n(FAOSTAT 2020), such as maize and millets, rice has \ncomparative advantages,\
    \ such as ease of transportation, \nstorage, and cooking, making it a suitable\
    \ research target. \nWe focus on the integrated improvement (in terms of \nproductivity)\
    \ required to deal with the rapid increase \nin rice consumption. Some of the\
    \ poorest countries are \ndistributed in the semiarid regions of West Africa (Niger,\
    \ \nBurkina Faso, and Guinea; Gapminder 2020), where food \nand nutrition shortages\
    \ are a major problem. Including \nthose countries, to meet the food and nutrition\
    \ demands of \nthe people in West Africa, regionally important crops, such \n\
    as millets, cassava, and common beans, have tremendous \npotential. As research\
    \ targets among these regional crops, \nwe focused on white Guinea yam (Dioscorea\
    \ rotundata; \nhereafter yam) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), which \nhave received\
    \ less research attention compared with \nother crops such as sweet potatoes and\
    \ common beans. \nWe focused on the utilization of the diversity of genetic \n\
    resources and breeding materials that were adapted \nto high productivity and\
    \ local preference with their \npotential to alleviate widespread poverty and\
    \ hunger in \nthe region. In addition, dairy promotion is important as \na research\
    \ target because it has the advantage of a stable \nsupply of animal protein sources,\
    \ which is very important \nfor the healthy development of humans. Thus, we also\
    \ \nfocused on the development of suitable technologies \nfor sustainable crop\
    \ production and livestock raising \nthat can effectively deploy locally available\
    \ resources. \nThese identified research activities are designed based \non the\
    \ premise of improving sustainability with efficient \nutilization of resources,\
    \ efficiently utilizing unused \ngermplasm, and capturing the preferences of consumers\
    \ \nand the needs of farmers. Our work was conducted with \nnational and international\
    \ partners in nominated countries \nfacing the challenges of short life expectancy\
    \ and low \nincome (Gapminder 2020), and we have been making \nsteady progress.\
    \ In this review, we introduce the technical \nchallenges and problems regarding\
    \ agriculture in SSA, \ndescribe our efforts to address these challenges, and\
    \ \ndiscuss future prospects.\n“Enhancement of rice production” project\nRice\
    \ has been the fastest growing food in terms of \nboth production and consumption\
    \ in SSA in the last few \ndecades. However, the average rice yield of SSA is\
    \ only \napproximately 2.2 t ha−1 (USDA 2020), which is much \nlower than the\
    \ average of the world’s major rice-producing \nregions (Global Yield Gap Atlas\
    \ 2020). In addition, the \ngap between regional rice consumption and production\
    \ \nin SSA continues to widen. The growing reliance on \nrice imports has created\
    \ an economic burden and food \ninsecurity in the residents of SSA. This anxiety\
    \ became \nespecially apparent during food riots in several major \ncapitals between\
    \ 2007 and 2008 (Berazneva & Lee 2013). \nTherefore, further increases in local\
    \ production of rice \ncontinue to be an urgent priority to ensure food security\
    \ \nin SSA. In 2008, the Japan International Cooperation \nAgency (JICA) announced\
    \ the founding of the Coalition \nfor African Rice Development (CARD) as an initiative\
    \ \nto support self-help efforts to expand rice production in \nAfrica. By 2018,\
    \ the platform partnered with governments \nin 23 target countries and 11 international\
    \ organizations, \nincluding JIRCAS, to reach its goal of doubling rice \nproduction\
    \ from 2008 to 2018. JIRCAS conducted various \nresearch activities in close coordination\
    \ with international \ninitiatives such as the CARD and generated some tools for\
    \ \nenhancing rice production, including field management \nand cultivation techniques\
    \ in rainfed lowland conditions \n(JIRCAS 2019a). The CARD initiative achieved\
    \ its goal \nto double the production of rice. Statistical figures suggest \n\
    that the increase in the production of rice over the past \ndecade was mainly\
    \ due to an increase in the cultivation \n9\nFood Security in Africa\narea, whereas\
    \ improvements in productivity were limited \n(Maruo et al. 2018). Rice consumption\
    \ increased further \nduring the decade of the CARD initiative, and thus the \n\
    increase in rice production did not lead to an improvement \nin self-sufficiency.\
    \ Therefore, additional improvements in \nrice production are necessary. Low yield\
    \ per unit area of \nrice and limited rice cultivation area remain the limiting\
    \ \nfactors in increasing rice production, and a continuous \napproach to increase\
    \ both aspects is key to future \nimprovement in self-sufficiency.\nUnder the\
    \ “Rice production enhancement” project, \nwe have developed essential components\
    \ of efficient \nproduction of rice (e.g., breeding materials with improved \n\
    nutrient uptake, simple diagnosis of nutrient conditions \nof soil, and smart\
    \ management of fertilizer depending \non specific soil and environmental conditions)\
    \ and \nthe examination of these intergradations for stable \nrice production\
    \ in SSA (Fig. 1). Moreover, we have \ndeveloped technologies to improve the efficiency\
    \ of \nwater use by minimizing the loss of water in the system \nof rice irrigation,\
    \ aiming to expand the irrigated area. \nFurthermore, we evaluated the impact\
    \ of the developed \ntechnology in the region and elucidated the conditions for\
    \ \nits dissemination. We focus on nutrition deficiency and \nwater shortage problems\
    \ in rice cultivation and describe \nboth the status of research and our efforts.\n\

    \ have created opportunities to integrate \nthese microtopography and soil-related\
    \ variables into \nfield-specific fertilizer management. The development \nof\
    \ breeding materials with improved NUE using locally \nadapted varieties has also\
    \ been effective at stabilizing rice \nproduction in SSA.\nP deficiency is one\
    \ of the main constraints in the \nproduction of rice (Saito et al. 2019, Tanaka\
    \ et al. 2015, \nVandamme et al. 2016). P deficiency in SSA is associated \nwith\
    \ highly weathered tropical soils, low biologically \navailable P content, and\
    \ P-harboring capacity associated \nwith acidity and the abundance of Fe and aluminum\
    \ (Al) \noxides (Batjes 2012, Bekunda et al. 2010, Kawamura  \net al. 2019, Nishigaki\
    \ et al. 2019). Insufficient application \nof P because of the limited purchasing\
    \ capacity of \nsmallholders is another important issue associated with \nshortages\
    \ of P in SSA. Agriculture in SSA generally has \nlower fertilizer inputs, and\
    \ application of P fertilizer is \neven lower than that in the other parts of\
    \ the developing \nworld (Nziguheba et al. 2016). The biogeochemical flow \nof\
    \ P is one of the most serious problems in planetary \nboundaries (Rockström et\
    \ al. 2009). Alewell et al. (2020) \nreported that a global shortage of P will\
    \ be aggravated \nby soil erosion, and Africa, which cannot afford the high \n\
    cost of fertilizers, is one of the areas with the highest \nrates of P depletion.\
    \ In the future, with an assumed \nabsolute shortage of mineral P fertilizer,\
    \ the agricultural \nsoils available worldwide will be depleted. Under these \n\
    constraints, it is essential for smallholders in SSA to use \nrice varieties with\
    \ improved P utilization efficiency (PUE) \nand find effective practices for management\
    \ of P fertilizer \nfor crop production to achieve increased yields per unit \n\
    of applied P fertilizer. In addition, a P recycling system is \nrecommended for\
    \ sustainable agriculture.\nThe development of breeding materials with \nimproved\
    \ PUE using locally adapted varieties is effective \nat stabilizing rice production\
    \ in SSA. To access P in the \nsoil, plants have the ability to evolve high- and\
    \ low-\naffinity P transporters and induce structural changes in \nthe roots to\
    \ forage P (Heuer et al. 2017). Of the many \ngenes associated with crop P deficiency,\
    \ genes such \nas phosphorus starvation tolerance 1 (OsPSTOL1) \nencoding a protein\
    \ kinase, Arabidopsis vacuolar \nproton pyrophosphatase 1 (AVP1) encoding a proton-\n\
    pyrophosphatase, PHOSPHATE 1 (PHO1) encoding a \nSPX-EXS domain protein, and phosphate\
    \ transporter \n1;6 (OsPHT1;6) encoding a phosphate transporter are \nexpected\
    \ to increase the PUE of P fertilizers in agricultural \nsystems. However, it\
    \ has been noted that combining PUE \nwith resistance to other stresses, such\
    \ as Al toxicity, is \nimportant. Our group selected lines with a high yield and\
    \ \nshort growth period, possessing phosphorus uptake 1  \n1. Challenges caused\
    \ by deficiencies in nutrients such \nas nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)\nChanges\
    \ in rice grain yield and mineral N input in \nSoutheast Asia and SSA from 1961\
    \ to 2019 (FAOSTAT \n2020) indicate that the rate of N application in Southeast\
    \ \nAsia has increased 20-fold since 1971, from 5 to 105 kg \nN ha−1, during which\
    \ time the region had significantly \nincreased rice yields (Tsujimoto et al.\
    \ 2019). In contrast, \nthe rate of N application of SSA until recently remained\
    \ \n< 10 kg N ha−1, in accordance with consistently low rice \nyield levels. Alternatively,\
    \ in SSA, the amount of fertilizer \nuse is insufficient, and the soil is undernourished\
    \ for rice, \nwhich is a problem that small-scale farmers face during \nrice production.\
    \ Improving the N use efficiency (NUE) \nby using rice varieties with high NUE\
    \ and fertilization \ntechniques is important for improving crop yields and \n\
    reducing the demand for N fertilizers. Reducing pollution \nin the global environment\
    \ is also important, as indicated \nby the biogeochemical flow of N at planetary\
    \ boundaries \n(Rockström et al. 2009).\nRice varieties with high NUE can reduce\
    \ the amount \nof fertilizer required for sustainable agriculture. However, \n\
    plant NUE is inherently complex because it involves \nN sensing, uptake, translocation,\
    \ assimilation, and \nremobilization and is governed by multiple interacting \n\
    genetic and environmental factors (Fan et al. 2017, Krapp \n2015, Xu et al. 2012).\
    \ Enhanced N acquisition must be \naccompanied by efficient transport and assimilation\
    \ to \npromote growth and development, ultimately increasing \nyields. Tang et\
    \ al. (2019) reported that a genome-wide \nassociation study identified NAC42-activated\
    \ nitrate \ntransporters that confer high NUE in rice. Chen et al. \n(2020) succeeded\
    \ in improving NUE by manipulating \nnitrate remobilization in plants, including\
    \ rice. Yoon  \net al. (2020) reported that transgenic rice overexpressing \n\
    Rubisco exhibited increased yields with improved NUE \nin an experimental paddy\
    \ field. Increasing knowledge \nof genes and interactions associated with these\
    \ critical \nprocesses will accelerate the development of new rice \nvarieties\
    \ with higher NUE.\nField-specific fertilization is key to improving the \nNUE\
    \ of rice growing in SSA soils with heterogeneous and \nlow nutrients (Tsujimoto\
    \ et al. 2019). NUE shows large \nspatial variation even in small areas, and it\
    \ can be improved \nby coping with the spatial variation of soil-related factors,\
    \ \nincluding deficiency of minor elements such as sulfur and \ntoxicity of iron\
    \ (Fe). NUE is also affected by dynamic \nchanges in hydrology and soil characteristics.\
    \ However, \nrecent technological advances, such as unmanned aerial \nvehicles\
    \ that capture microtopography at low cost, a \ndatabase of high-resolution soil\
    \ nutrient characteristics, \nand interactive decision support tools using on-site\
    \ \n11\nFood Security in Africa\nas the distribution of soil moisture and root\
    \ penetration \nresistance (Menge et al. 2016). Genetic improvement \nstudies\
    \ have been conducted to withstand drought-\nsensitive periods to ensure rice\
    \ yields. The DEEPER \nROOTING 1 gene, which regulates the root angle to \nobtain\
    \ water from deep soil, was discovered and used to \nimprove the yield of shallow\
    \ rooting rice under drought \nconditions (Uga et al. 2013). Our group has also\
    \ promoted \nthe production of a drought-tolerant rice strain developed \nusing\
    \ biotechnology, including the modification of genes \n(Selvaraj et al. 2017)\
    \ and the development of long-rooted \nrice using marker-assisted selection (Obara\
    \ et al. 2014). \nYadav et al. (2019) reported a QTL that contributes to \nrice\
    \ grain yield under reproductive stage drought stress, \nwhich was identified\
    \ based on genotyping-by-sequencing \nmapping. The identified genomic regions\
    \ can be used in \nbreeding programs. Furthermore, agricultural engineering \n\
    measures, such as irrigation systems, are expected to \nbe effective. To stabilize\
    \ rice yield in the SSA savanna, \nsupplementary irrigation is particularly effective\
    \ during \nthe reproductive period when rice is vulnerable to water \nshortage;\
    \ thus, the development of a supplementary \nirrigation technology for rice suitable\
    \ for the SSA savanna \nis required.\nWe have developed a supplementary irrigation\
    \ \nsystem for rice production using the “paired pond system” \nin northern Ghana.\
    \ This system saves water overflow by \nchanneling it from an existing reservoir\
    \ (dugout) into a \nnew small reservoir, enabling the utilization of water \n\
    for supplementary irrigation during the critical period to \nensure rice seed\
    \ fertility in paddy fields. JIRCAS (2017) \nhas published a manual based on the\
    \ results of this study. \nFurthermore, we monitored farmers using the system\
    \ and \nconducted an impact assessment and factor analysis of \nfarmers’ acceptance\
    \ of the newly developed technologies. \nWe also created a farming planning model\
    \ that reflected \nmanagement conditions, water usage conditions, and \nsocial\
    \ conditions for irrigated rice farmers based on the \nfarm management model developed\
    \ in Mozambique (see \nitem 3, crop–livestock integration). The model elucidated\
    \ \nthe effects of irrigated rice technologies (Koide et al. \n2021) on increasing\
    \ and stabilizing farmers’ incomes. We \nhope that this system will contribute\
    \ to cultivation of rice, \nespecially in the savanna zone.\nThrough \nscientific\
    \ \nrecommendations \nand \nthe \ndissemination of the research results, the technologies\
    \ and \nbreeding materials developed in this project contribute to \nCARD Phase\
    \ 2, which started in 2019 with the goal of \n“doubling rice production by 2030”\
    \ (Coalition for African \nRice Development 2020) (Fig. 1). Rice self-sufficiency\
    \ \nin SSA is insufficient, and a large part of the region is \ndependent on imports.\
    \ In view of the changes in the global \n(Pup1) (Gamuyao et al. 2012), a quantitative\
    \ trait locus \n(QTL) for phosphate deficiency tolerance, including \nPISTOL1,\
    \ in the fields of Madagascar, which is one of \nthe major rice-producing countries\
    \ in Africa and one of \nthe countries with the shortest life expectancy and lowest\
    \ \nincome (Gapminder 2020). Selection was performed \nin collaboration with the\
    \ National Center for Applied \nResearch on Rural Development (FOFIFA), Madagascar.\
    \ \nWe have also started an adaptation test for a variety of \nregistrations.\n\
    A joint research collaboration between JIRCAS and \nFOFIFA has shown that P-dipping\
    \ treatment of seedlings, \ncalled “P-dipping,” can significantly improve the\
    \ \nefficiency of fertilizer use and yield of rice (Rakotoarisoa \net al. 2020).\
    \ In this technology, rice seedlings are dipped \nin a mud-like mixture of P fertilizer\
    \ and paddy soil before \ntransplanting. On-farm field trials in Madagascar have\
    \ \nclarified that P-dipping shortens the number of days from \ntransplanting\
    \ to maturity and avoids cold stress during the \nreproductive stage. In addition,\
    \ P-dipping increased the \nyield by 9%-35% compared with the conventional method\
    \ \nof fertilizer broadcasting. In SSA, including Madagascar, \nthe productivity\
    \ of rice is severely limited due to the poor \nsupply of nutrients such as P\
    \ and the unstable production \nenvironment because of water shortage, low temperature,\
    \ \nand high temperature stress during the cultivation period. \nThe dissemination\
    \ of this technology is expected to \ncontribute to improved and stable rice production\
    \ in SSA \nand further enhance food security in the region.\n2. Water shortage\
    \ challenges in rice agriculture\nRice is highly sensitive to stresses, such as\
    \ \ndehydration, from the panicle formation stage to the \nflowering stage. However,\
    \ in the SSA savanna, which has \na dry season, people often cannot obtain enough\
    \ water due \nto an unstable precipitation pattern during this period in \nthe\
    \ cropping cycle. Droughts frequently occur globally, \nincluding in Africa, and\
    \ in the past, many crops, including \nrice, have been severely damaged (Kim et\
    \ al. 2019). Due to \nrecent climate change, extreme weather events frequently\
    \ \noccur worldwide. Africa is no exception, and there are \nconcerns that precipitation\
    \ patterns will become more \nunstable because of forecasted global climate change.\
    \ \nUnder a joint project between Kenya and Japan, the \ndevelopment of rice varieties\
    \ carrying useful genes/QTLs \nto overcome biological and abiotic stresses, including\
    \ \ndrought in Kenya, has been promoted (Makihara et al. \n2018). These include\
    \ different root developmental traits \nassociated with drought avoidance in the\
    \ two New Rice for \nAfrica (NERICA) varieties—NERICA1 and NERICA4—\nand the desirable\
    \ root traits for upland rice cultivation \nvary depending on the target soil\
    \ environment, such \n12\nJARQ  56 (1)  2022\nK. Nakashima et al.\nto efficient\

    \ cash income for farmers \nand an important source of protein and micronutrients,\
    \ \nand its production in West Africa accounts for over 80% of \nworld production\
    \ (FAOSTAT 2020). Therefore, in recent \nyears, it has been noted that in addition\
    \ to improving \nthe yield and pest resistance, which are conventional \nbreeding\
    \ targets, developing new varieties to improve \nthe quality and nutritional value\
    \ of grains is important. \nIn particular, as protein is an indispensable element\
    \ for \ngrowth in humans, the grain protein content of cowpea \nis an important\
    \ trait when considering the development \nof varieties suitable for the region.\
    \ However, research \non cowpea, whose production in the world is centered \n\
    mostly in West Africa, is limited. The breeding of yam \nand cowpea varieties,\
    \ which are highly productive, \nshow stable production even in poor environments,\
    \ and \nhave excellent nutrition and palatability, is an important \nsolution\
    \ for securing a balanced diet and income \nsources for smallholders in Africa.\
    \ The development of \ngenotyping and phenotyping technologies is expected \n\
    to accelerate the breeding of these crops. In particular, \nwe could meet various\
    \ demands of the people that are \ndeeply linked to local culture and traditions\
    \ through the \nutilization of diverse genetic resources that are not fully \n\
    exploited. Aiming toward the active utilization of the \nrich genetic diversity\
    \ of both crops through international \nand national breeding programs, the project\
    \ focused on \nthe accumulation of fundamental information on their \ngenetic\
    \ diversities and the development of effective tools \nto enable breeders to select\
    \ and evaluate their materials \nusing this information. This study was conducted\
    \ in \nNigeria and Burkina Faso, with strong collaboration \nwith the International\
    \ Institute of Tropical Agriculture \n(IITA), which holds rich genetic resources\
    \ of cowpea and \nyam and conducts breeding programs, and the Institut de \nl’Environnement\
    \ et Recherches Agricoles. In addition to \nour efforts to release the genetic\
    \ diversity data through \nthe open-access EDITS-Cowpea database (JIRCAS 2016)\
    \ \nand Yam base (JIRCAS 2020) to enhance the utilization of \ndiverse genetic\
    \ resources of the crops, effective tools and \ninformation have been developed\
    \ as summarized below.\n1. Challenges in developing genotyping technology to \n\
    accelerate the breeding of yam and cowpea\nTo improve the efficiency of yam breeding,\
    \ we \nconducted international joint research with IITA and other \ninstitutions\
    \ on the development of scientific information \nand technological development\
    \ that forms the basis of \nyam agriculture. To enable breeding based on the genetic\
    \ \nprofile of the yam, Tamiru et al. (2017) succeeded in \ndecoding the genome\
    \ sequence of Guinea yam. We also \nfood chain system driven by climate change\
    \ and the new \ncoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we estimate \nthat research\
    \ support for improving the rice production \ncapacity of SSA will become more\
    \ important.\n“Regional crop utilization” project\nCrops that are important in\
    \ a particular area but \nhave not been improved sufficiently regarding breeding\
    \ \nand production techniques are called “orphan crops” \n(also referred to as\
    \ “minor crops,” “underutilized plant \nspecies,” “neglected crops,” and “future\
    \ foods”) (Tadele \n2019, Jamnadass et al. 2020). One approach to crop \ndiversification\
    \ to support human nutrition in Africa is \nthe promotion of African orphan crops\
    \ rich in vitamins, \nessential minerals, and other micronutrients important \n\
    for healthy diets (Jamnadass et al. 2020). Yams and \ncowpeas are regionally important\
    \ crops that can alleviate \nwidespread poverty and hunger in West Africa through\
    \ \ntheir economic and nutritional values and a deep linkage \nwith the peoples’\
    \ lives and culture fostered by a long \nhistory of cultivation. However, research\
    \ on these two \ncrops has been hindered because of low scientific attention \n\
    and technical difficulties compared with major crops, \nsuch as rice, maize, wheat,\
    \ and soybean, and even with \nother African crops that have wider cultivation\
    \ around \nthe world, such as cassava, sweet potato, common beans, \nand groundnut.\
    \ In particular, these two crops are lacking \nin terms of the information and\
    \ techniques required for \neffective breeding in both genotyping and phenotyping.\
    \ \nRecent advances in genomics research and phenotyping \ntechnology have laid\
    \ the groundwork for the genetic \nimprovement of orphan crops (Tadele 2019, Jamnadass\
    \  \net al. 2020). For example, the genome sequence of quinoa \n(Chenopodium quinoa),\
    \ a regionally important crop in \nLatin America, has been elucidated (Jarvis\
    \ et al. 2017, \nYasui et al. 2016), paving the way for molecular breeding. \n\
    However, owing to their high regional characteristics, \nthese regional crops\
    \ have received limited research \nattention despite having great potential for\
    \ improvement \nin both productivity and quality.\nYams are widely cultivated\
    \ as a staple food in Africa, \nand approximately 95% (54 million tons) of the\
    \ world’s \nproduction is produced in the Guinea Bay area of West \nAfrica called\
    \ the “Yam Belt.” In particular, Guinea yam \nis an important staple food crop\
    \ that is indispensable to \nthe diet of the region and is a major cash crop for\
    \ farmers. \nHowever, the target of use is underground tubers, making \ncultivation\
    \ tests and surveys difficult to conduct over \ntime. Furthermore, the fact that\
    \ males and females differ \ndepending on the variety and lineage and that sex\
    \ cannot \nbe determined without flowering has been a major obstacle \n13\nFood\
    \ Security in Africa\ndeveloped high-speed phenotyping technology for use in \n\
    fields (Yang et al. 2020). However, the development of \nphenotyping techniques\
    \ for orphan crops, such as yams \nand cowpeas, which are mainly produced in Africa,\
    \ is \ninadequate. In addition, the development of high-speed \nphenotyping technology\
    \ for traits related to nutrition \nand quality, such as protein content in cowpea\
    \ seeds, is \nrequired to accelerate breeding.\nIseki & Matsumoto (2018) developed\
    \ a simple and \ninexpensive method for the nondestructive estimation of \nthe\
    \ aboveground biomass of yams cultivated in pillars. \nThe normalized difference\
    \ vegetation index (which \nrepresents the amount and activity of vegetation)\
    \ for each \nindividual can be obtained by installing a plate behind \nthe yam\
    \ plant that is cultivated on a support and scanning \na small spectroscopic reflection\
    \ measuring instrument \nalong the support rod in parallel with the plant. Therefore,\
    \ \nnot only can the growth survey of yams be significantly \nreduced, but it\
    \ can also be used as a growth diagnosis \nindex in farm fields.\nStomata conductivity\
    \ (stomatal conductance) is \nan index that shows the ease of passage of water\
    \ vapor \nand carbon dioxide in the stomata. It is widely used in \nall fields\
    \ as an index of crop photosynthetic ability and \nresistance to environmental\
    \ stress such as drought; \nhowever, there are problems such as inconsistencies\
    \ \ninduced by the measurement environment. Iseki & \nOlaleye (2019) developed\
    \ a new index for estimating \nstomatal conductivity using leaf surface temperature\
    \ \nobtained from the thermal images of cowpea plants. This \nnew index, which\
    \ is based on a mathematical model, is \nless affected by the measurement environment\
    \ compared \nwith the conventional index. Therefore, it could be \nwidely used\
    \ for evaluating the tolerance to drought  \nstress and the photosynthetic activity\
    \ of crops in \nfluctuating environments.\nFurthermore, we focused on the protein\
    \ content, \nwhich is an important quality-related trait of cowpea \ngrains, and\
    \ developed an evaluation technique that can be \nused for selecting promising\
    \ strains and rapidly evaluating \nthe effects of the cultivation environment.\
    \ Muranaka et al. \n(2015, 2016) succeeded in estimating the N content of \na\
    \ powder sample of cowpea grains using infrared light \nand converted this into\
    \ protein content. Subsequently, \nIshikawa et al. (2017) succeeded in developing\
    \ a \ntechnique for the nondestructive estimation of the N \ncontent of whole\
    \ intact cowpea grains using near-infrared \nspectroscopy and converted this into\
    \ protein content. The \nuse of these techniques allows for the rapid assessment\
    \ \nof the grain protein content available during the  \nbreeding process.\nWe\
    \ hope that these technologies will contribute to the \nidentified loci that determine\
    \ sex based on genomic \ninformation and developed a DNA marker that enables \n\
    sex estimation at the seedling stage. In normal cultivation, \nit takes 2-3 years\
    \ to reliably determine sex, and the use of \nthe marker developed by us would\
    \ allow the selection of \nvarieties and lines with excellent properties as breeding\
    \ \nparents without waiting for flowering in the seedling \nstage. Together with\
    \ D. rotundata Diversity Research Set, \nsmaller set (102) of accession of Guinea\
    \ yam, selected by \nus for the effective use of these advanced technologies in\
    \ \nyam research (Pachakkil et al. 2021), it is expected that \nthe breeding efficiency\
    \ of Guinea yam can be improved, \nsuch as the number of individuals handled in\
    \ the trial \ncultivation and the field area can be reduced.\nAt the sites of\
    \ breeding of yam and production of its \nseedlings, identifying varieties from\
    \ only the aboveground \nparts of the plant and the appearance of tubers is very\
    \ \ndifficult. Therefore, mixing other varieties and lines in \neach process of\
    \ planting, cultivating, harvesting, and \npreserving has been a problem for many\
    \ years. Therefore, \nwe have developed a yam variety identification technology\
    \ \npackage that can be easily and quickly used in the field \nby breeding programs,\
    \ seed companies, and extension \norganizations. We have also succeeded in providing\
    \ \na toolkit to support the use of DNA (simple sequence \nrepeat) markers reported\
    \ by Tamiru et al. (2015), the web \napplication to select suitable and minimum\
    \ combinations \nof DNA markers, and databases containing polymorphism \ndata\
    \ of over 500 genotypes (JIRCAS 2020). We can \ncontribute toward improving the\
    \ efficiency and quality \nof breeding and seedling production using the developed\
    \ \nvariety identification technology for the confirmation \nof mating parents,\
    \ prevention of contamination with \nother varieties and lines in each cultivation\
    \ process, and \ndissemination and sale of quality assured seedlings.\nRecently,\
    \ an international consortium has deciphered \nthe genome information of cowpea\
    \ (Lonardi et al. 2019). \nIt is expected that this genomic information will be\
    \ used \nin genotyping technology to accelerate cowpea breeding.\n2. Challenges\
    \ in developing phenotyping technology \nto accelerate the breeding of yam and\
    \ cowpea\nThe field of genomic research on crops has made \ngreat strides, and\
    \ the genome sequences of many crops \nhave been recently deciphered, thereby\
    \ facilitating \ngenotyping analysis. However, phenotyping technology, \nwhich\
    \ evaluates crop performance in the field, has become \na bottleneck for improving\
    \ breeding efficiency, and thus is \na focal point of research to increase efficiency\
    \ and speed \nup the development. Thus far, developed countries have \nbeen developing\
    \ phenotyping technology for large-scale \ngreenhouses and fields of major crops\
    \ as well as have \n14\nJARQ  56 (1)  2022\nK. Nakashima et al.\ncattle food throughout\
    \ the years are effective to ameliorate \ncattle food shortages during the dry\
    \ season. Two crop by-\nproducts, corn stover and sugarcane top, contain certain\
    \ \ncrude protein and neutral detergent fiber nutrients that can \nbe well preserved\
    \ in silage (Cai et al. 2020). The fermented \nTMR prepared with local feed resources\
    \ has helped attain \ngood quality and improved milk yield in dairy cattle in\
    \ \nMozambique (Du et al. 2020). The nutritional values \nof other local feed\
    \ resources, including native grasses, \nwere analyzed to develop a feeding plan\
    \ for dairy cattle. \nThe productivity of food and feed multipurpose crops, \n\
    such as cowpea and sweet potato, affected by soil water \nand fertility status,\
    \ has been examined. We have also \nused waste from livestock farming as a soil\
    \ fertility \nmanagement method by farmers to improve food crop \nproduction and\
    \ sustain forage crop production. \nBy integrating these technologies, we can\
    \ propose \nan integrated crop–livestock model for dairy farmers \nin Mozambique\
    \ through researchers and extension \nworkers. The integrated model is evaluated\
    \ by the farm \nmanagement model, which can facilitate technology \nadoption by\
    \ African smallholders and livelihood \nimprovement. Using farming conditions\
    \ and indexes, \nconditions for subsistence, and nonfarm activities as \ninputs,\
    \ the model computes (by linear programming) \nthe optimal farming plan to maximize\
    \ the total income \nwhile growing enough food for home consumption using \nmixed\
    \ cropping and intercropping for risk dispersion and \nensuring nonfarm income\
    \ and labor allocation. Koide et al. \n(2018a, 2018b) and JIRCAS (2019b) applied\
    \ the model to \nthe Nacala Corridor, northern Mozambique, and identified \nthe\
    \ optimal crop combinations and income increases \naccording to the agroecological\
    \ zones and farming scales. \nUpgrading this model, Koide & Tinga (2021) developed\
    \ \na complex management planning model for small-scale \nfarmers in southern\
    \ Mozambique to achieve efficient \ncrop–livestock integration with dairy farming.\
    \ We hope \nthat these technologies will contribute to the promotion of \nlivestock\
    \ production in Mozambique and the improvement \nin nutrition in the region by\
    \ expanding milk production.\nFuture prospects\nIn CARD2, the efforts that should\
    \ be especially \nnoted are organized as the “RICE approach,” an acronym \nformed\
    \ from the first alphabet of four keywords (Coalition \nfor African Rice Development\
    \ 2020, Maruo 2018):\nR:  Resilience will handle adaptation to climate change\
    \ \nthrough seed breeding, dissemination, and irrigation \ndevelopment.\nI:  Industrialization\
    \ \nwill \naddress \nthe \nissues \nof \nmechanization, access to local and regional\
    \ markets, \nacceleration of yam and cowpea breeding in West Africa \nand the\
    \ improvement of local nutritionally balanced diets \nand households.\n“Crop–livestock\
    \ integration” project\nAgriculture is a major sector that drives the economic\
    \ \ngrowth in many SSA countries. In most countries in \nEastern and Southern\
    \ Africa, beef and milk are among \nthe top five products based on production\
    \ value. This \nindicates that livestock farming is important to not only \nprovide\
    \ protein as an essential nutrient for the human \nbody but also to improve farmers’\
    \ incomes. The main \nconstraint in livestock production in African savanna \n\
    dairy farms is feed shortages, in terms of both quantity \nand quality (Antonio\
    \ et al. 1991). Dairy farmers, including \nsmall-scale farmers, face regular feed\
    \ shortages during \nthe dry season, as the dry season lasts for > 6 months \n\
    each year. Traditional animal husbandry practices in \ncountries such as Mozambique\
    \ consist of simple grazing \non native grasslands, with by-products of crops\
    \ used as \nsupplements. However, this feeding pattern does not meet \nthe nutritional\
    \ requirements of dairy cows, and the poor \nquality of roughage results in poor\
    \ milk yield and quality \n(Wiedmeier et al. 2002). To improve the household \n\
    nutrition of local small-scale farmers by promoting dairy \nfarming, developing\
    \ a high-quality feed suitable for the \nlocal area throughout the year and stable\
    \ feed in the dry \nseason is necessary.\nIn Mozambique, one of the countries\
    \ with short life \nexpectancy and low income (Gapminder 2020), there \nis a strong\
    \ desire to restore the livestock industry that \ncollapsed because of the civil\
    \ war from 1977 to 1992. \nThe promotion of dairy farming is expected to make\
    \ \na significant contribution to improving the nutrition \nof the local people.\
    \ We sought to improve food and \nnutrition security in this country through a\
    \ crop–livestock \nintegration system to reduce the dependence on feed \nimports\
    \ by using by-products generated during crop \nproduction and food processing\
    \ for the livestock industry \nand waste such as livestock manure in crop cultivation\
    \ \nto maintain soil fertility. In this project, we developed an \neffective and\
    \ efficient integrated crop–livestock system \napplicable throughout the year\
    \ in collaboration with \nthe Agricultural Research Institute of Mozambique to\
    \ \nincrease dairy production in tropical savanna areas, which \nhave distinct\
    \ rainy and dry seasons.\nThe utilization of silage from the residue of \nagricultural\
    \ products harvested during the rainy season \nto ameliorate cattle food shortages\
    \ during the dry season \nand fermented total mixed ration (TMR) using locally\
    \ \navailable agricultural by-products for the stable supply of \n15\nFood Security\
    \ in Africa\nIn addition, developing partnerships with related \nresearch institutes\
    \ and human resource development in \nSSA that can autonomously promote research\
    \ is important.\nMany stakeholders need to work together to \nachieve food security\
    \ in Africa. We are working on the \ndevelopment of suitable varieties and technologies\
    \ with \nnot only our counterparts in local research institutes but \nalso in\
    \ the field, together with farmers who are the users \nof the research products\
    \ and participate in the early stages \nof testing. To achieve SDG Goal 1 (Poverty\
    \ Eradication) \nand Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) by 2030, stakeholders, such as \npublic\
    \ research institutes, academia, and the private sector, \nneed to work together.\
    \ Because the current dissemination \nsystem in Africa is fragile, actively working\
    \ on smart \ntechnologies, such as smartphone apps, which have been \nrapidly\
    \ developed in recent years, is necessary to widely \ndisseminate the developed\
    \ techniques and varieties.\nRecently, the World Food Programme estimated \nthat\
    \ > 2.5 billion people will suffer from acute hunger \ndue to the COVID-19 pandemic\
    \ by the end of 2020 \n(World Food Programme Insight 2020). Good nutrition \n\
    is an essential part of an individual’s defense against \nCOVID-19, and nutritional\
    \ resilience is a key element of \na society’s readiness to combat the threat\
    \ (Development \nInitiatives 2020). There is concern that the global food \nand\
    \ nutrition security crisis will worsen in addition to the \nsocial and humanitarian\
    \ crisis due to the spread of the \ninfection to vulnerable low-income developing\
    \ regions, \nincluding SSA. Efforts to stabilize food production and \nresolve\
    \ malnutrition are increasingly important. Global \ntransformation of the food\
    \ system is urgently needed as \nmany of the world’s populations face nutritional\
    \ problems \nand many environmental systems and processes have \ncrossed over\
    \ the safe boundaries for our planet (Willett  \net al. 2019). To establish a\
    \ sustainable agricultural system, \nwe need to develop technologies that are\
    \ readily available \nand effective and lead to an increased food productivity\
    \ \nfor farmers by integrating biological and ecological \nprocesses into food\
    \ production without adversely \naffecting the environment (Pretty 2008). By promoting\
    \ \nthe dissemination of the developed technologies and \nmaximizing research\
    \ outputs, we shall contribute \nto improving both the productivity and nutrition\
    \ of \nagricultural products in developing regions, especially in \nSSA, and eradicating\
    \ poverty and creating a peaceful and \nhealthy society.\nAcknowledgements\nThese\

    is one of the main challenges in cognitive radio ad hoc networks, where the availability
    of local spectrum resources may change from time to time and hop by hop. For this
    reason, a cross-layer opportunistic spectrum access and dynamic routing algorithm
    for cognitive radio networks is proposed, which is called the routing and dynamic
    spectrum-allocation (ROSA) algorithm. Through local control actions, ROSA aims
    to maximize the network throughput by performing joint routing, dynamic spectrum
    allocation, scheduling, and transmit power control. Specifically, the algorithm
    dynamically allocates spectrum resources to maximize the capacity of links without
    generating harmful interference to other users while guaranteeing a bounded bit
    error rate (BER) for the receiver. In addition, the algorithm aims to maximize
    the weighted sum of differential backlogs to stabilize the system by giving priority
    to higher capacity links with a high differential backlog. The proposed algorithm
    is distributed, computationally efficient, and has bounded BER guarantees. ROSA
    is shown through numerical model-based evaluation and discrete-event packet-level
    simulations to outperform baseline solutions, leading to a high throughput, low
    delay, and fair bandwidth allocation. Published in: IEEE Transactions on Vehicular

    SECTION I. Introduction Cognitive radio networks [2] have recently emerged as
    a promising technology to improve the utilization efficiency of the existing radio
    spectrum. In a cognitive radio network, users opportunistically access the existing
    wireless spectrum without interfering with existing users. A key challenge in
    the design of cognitive radio networks is dynamic spectrum allocation, which enables
    wireless devices to opportunistically access portions of the spectrum as they
    become available. Consequently, techniques for dynamic spectrum access have received
    significant attention over the past few years, e.g., [3]–[7]. In addition to this,
    in cognitive radio networks with multihop communication requirements (i.e., cognitive
    radio ad hoc networks), the dynamic nature of the radio spectrum calls for the
    development of novel spectrum-aware routing algorithms. In fact, spectrum occupancy
    is location dependent, and therefore, in a multihop path, the available spectrum
    bands may be different at each relay node. Hence, controlling the interaction
    between the routing and the spectrum-management functionalities is of fundamental
    importance. While cross-layer design principles have been extensively studied
    by the wireless networking research community in the recent past, the availability
    of cognitive and frequency agile devices motivates research on new algorithms
    and models to study cross-layer interactions that involve spectrum management-related
    functionalities. For the reasons above, in this paper, we consider interactions
    between spectrum management and dynamic routing functionalities. With this respect,
    we propose a distributed algorithm that jointly addresses routing, dynamic spectrum-assignment,
    scheduling, and power-allocation functionalities for cognitive radio ad hoc networks.
    The objective of the proposed algorithm is to allocate resources efficiently,
    distributively, and in a cross-layer fashion. We further show how our algorithm
    can be interpreted as a distributed solution to a centralized cross-layer optimization
    problem. While the optimization problem is centralized and hard to solve, our
    algorithm is practically and distributively implementable. We show how a cross-layer
    solution that jointly solves routing and spectrum allocation at each hop outperforms
    approaches where routes are selected independently of the spectrum assignment,
    with moderate computational complexity. Our main contributions can be outlined
    as follows. We derive a distributed and localized algorithm for joint dynamic
    routing and spectrum allocation for multihop cognitive radio networks. The proposed
    algorithm jointly addresses a routing and spectrum assignment with power control
    under the so-called physical interference model, which computes the interference
    among secondary users using a signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)-based
    model. The proposed algorithm considers and leverages the unique characteristics
    of a cognitive radio, including the availability of spectrum holes at a particular
    geographic location and their possible variability with time. In the proposed
    algorithm, each cognitive radio makes real-time decisions on spectrum and power
    allocation based on locally collected information. Nodes can adjust their transmission
    power to maximize the link capacity on the selected spectrum portion. We introduce
    a notion of a “spectrum hole” that considers interference from neighboring secondary
    as well as primary users and leverage it to optimize resource utilization at low
    computational cost. We discuss a practical implementation of the proposed algorithm
    that relies on a dual radio with a common control channel (CCC) and a frequency-agile
    data channel (DC). We show how the proposed algorithm can be interpreted as a
    distributed and practical solution to a cross-layer optimal resource allocation
    problem, whose performance is close to the optimum. The remainder of this paper
    is organized as follows. In Section II, we review related work. In Section III,
    we introduce a system model. In Section IV, we propose the routing and dynamic
    spectrum allocation (ROSA) algorithm, which is our distributed algorithm for joint
    routing and dynamic spectrum allocation. Section V addresses implementation details.
    In Section VI, we show how ROSA can be interpreted as a distributed solution to
    a centralized cross-layer network utility maximization problem for cognitive radio
    ad hoc networks. Section VII evaluates the performance of the algorithm. Finally,
    Section VIII concludes this paper. SECTION II. Related Work Recent work has investigated
    algorithms and protocols for dynamic spectrum allocation in cognitive radio networks.
    Proposed approaches to assign a spectrum can be broadly classified into centralized
    and distributed schemes. For example, the dynamic spectrum access protocol [8]
    is centralized and, thus, requires a central controller to allocate a spectrum.
    In [7], a distributed spectrum-assignment algorithm is proposed, which aims at
    solving the spectrum allocation problem: which node should use how wide a spectrum
    band at what center frequency and for how long. This paper significantly differs
    from [7], which assumes mutually exclusive transmissions with zero interference
    tolerance. Spectrum band auctions [9], [10] have been proposed to allocate wireless
    spectrum resources, in which bidders obtain different spectrum channels to minimize
    the interference. In contrast, our proposed solution jointly considers spectrum
    allocation and routing in a cross-layer fashion since the available spectrum bands
    may be different at each hop. Some recent work has made initial steps in the direction
    of leveraging interactions between routing and spectrum allocation. In [11], each
    source node finds candidate paths based on dynamic source routing [12] and collects
    information on link connectivity and quality. For each candidate route, the algorithm
    finds all feasible spectrum-assignment combinations and estimates the end-to-end
    throughput performance for each combination. Based on this, it selects the route
    and spectrum assignment with maximal throughput and schedules a conflict-free
    channel for this route. In [13], a connectivity-based routing scheme for cognitive
    radio ad hoc networks is proposed, where the connectivity of different paths is
    evaluated by taking into account primary user activities. The authors in [14]
    propose a layered graph model, where each layer corresponds to a channel, and
    find shortest paths based on the layered graph. Both [11] and [14] are channel-based
    solutions, i.e., the available spectrum is divided into predefined channels, and
    devices are assigned opportunities to transmit on channels on a relatively long
    time scale. However, cognitive radio networks require spectrum allocation on a
    short time scale since the available spectrum bands will continuously vary based
    on the activities of primary and secondary users. In addition, the algorithms
    in [11] and [14] are based on the so-called protocol model [15], in which two
    links either destructively interfere or do not interfere at all. Although simple,
    this model fails to capture the cumulative effect of interference. Conversely,
    this paper assumes a richer interference model, which accounts for the fact that
    advanced transmission techniques, including code-division multiple access [3],
    [16], allow concurrent colocated communications so that a message from node i
    to node j can be correctly received, even if there is a concurrent transmission
    close to j . Recent work has started investigating cross-layer optimizations for
    cognitive radio networks. Hou et al. [17] formulate a cross-layer optimization
    problem for a network with cognitive radios, whose objective is to minimize the
    required network-wide radio spectrum resource that is needed to support traffic
    for a given set of user sessions. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer
    nonlinear problem, and a sequential fixing algorithm is developed where the integer
    variables are iteratively determined via a sequence of linear programs. Shi and
    Hou studied the joint optimization of power control, scheduling, and routing for
    a multihop cognitive radio network via a centralized approach [18] and a distributed
    approach [19]. Shi and Hou [19] developed a distributed optimization algorithm
    with the objective of maximizing data rates for a set of sessions. The performance
    of the algorithm is shown to be, on average, within 88% of the performance of
    the optimal (centralized) algorithm. SECTION III. System Model We consider a cognitive
    radio network consisting of M primary users and N secondary users. Primary users
    hold licenses for specific spectrum bands and can only occupy their assigned portion
    of the spectrum. Secondary users do not have any licensed spectrum and opportunistically
    send their data by utilizing idle portions of the primary spectrum. Let the multihop
    wireless network be modeled by a directed connectivity graph G(V,E) , where V={
    v 1 ,…, v N+M } is a finite set of nodes, with |V|=N+M , and (i,j)∈E represent
    a unidirectional wireless link from node v i to node v j (referred to also as
    node i and node j , respectively, for simplicity). Nodes from the subset PU={
    v 1 ,…, v M } are designated as primary users, and nodes from subset SU={ v M+1
    ,…, v M+N } are designated as secondary users. We assume that all secondary users
    are equipped with cognitive radios that consist of a reconfigurable transceiver
    and a scanner, which is similar, for example, to the KNOWS prototype from Microsoft
    [20]. The transceiver can tune to a set of contiguous frequency bands [f,f+ΔB]
    , where ΔB represents the maximum bandwidth of the cognitive radio. We keep the
    physical layer model general. However, we assume that multiple transmissions can
    concurrently occur in a frequency band, e.g., with different spreading codes.
    Among others, our physical layer model could represent orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing-based
    transmission, which is based on a flexible subcarrier pool, and is, thus, a promising
    candidate technology for cognitive radio networks. Alternatively, the considered
    abstraction could model a multichannel time-hopping impulse radio ultrawideband
    system [21]. The available spectrum is assumed to be organized in two separate
    channels. A CCC is used by all secondary users for spectrum access negotiation
    and is assumed to be time slotted. A DC is used for data communication. The DC
    consists of a set of discrete minibands { f min , f min+1 ,…, f max−1 , f max
    } , each of bandwidth w and identified by a discrete index. For example, the interval
    [ f i , f i+Δ f i ] represents the (discrete) set of minibands selected by secondary
    user i between f i and f i+Δ f i , with bandwidth wΔ f i . If we let wΔ f B denote
    the maximum bandwidth of the cognitive radio, where Δ f B denotes the maximum
    number of minibands, we have Δ f i ≤Δ f B representing the constraint of the maximum
    bandwidth of the cognitive radio. Each backlogged secondary user contends for
    spectrum access on the control channel f cc , where f cc ∉[ f min , f max ] .
    All secondary users exchange local information on the CCC. Traffic flows are,
    in general, carried over multihop routes. Let the traffic demands consist of a
    set S=1,2,…,S , where S=|S| , of unicast sessions. Each session s∈S is characterized
    by a fixed source–destination node pair. We indicate the arrival rate of session
    s at node i as λ s i (t) and with Λ the vector of arrival rates. Each node maintains
    a separate queue for each session s for which it is either a source or an intermediate
    relay. At time slot t , define Q s i (t) as the number of queued packets of session
    s waiting for transmission at secondary user i . Define r s ij (t) as the transmission
    rate on link (i,j) for session s during time slot t , and define R as the vector
    of rates. For ∀i∈SU , the queue is updated as follows: Q s i (t+1)= [ Q s i (t)+
    ∑ k∈SU,k≠i r s ki (t)− ∑ l∈SU,l≠i r s il (t)+ λ s i (t)] + . (1) View Source SECTION
    IV. Joint ROSA Here, we present the distributed joint ROSA algorithm. We start
    by introducing the notions of spectrum holes and spectrum utility in Section IV-A
    and B, respectively. Opportunities to transmit are assigned based on the concept
    of spectrum utility, and routes are explored based on the presence of spectrum
    holes with the objective of maximizing the spectrum utility. Then, in Section
    IV-C, we outline the algorithm for spectrum and power allocation executed in a
    distributed fashion at each secondary user. Finally, we present the core ROSA
    algorithm in Section IV-D. A. Spectrum Holes For frequency f , secondary user
    i needs to 1) satisfy the bit-error-rate (BER) requirement when it transmits to
    secondary user j and 2) avoid interfering with ongoing receivers. Denote SINR
    th PU and SINR th SU as the SINR thresholds to achieve a target BER ∗ PU for primary
    users and BER ∗ SU for secondary users, respectively. The first constraint can
    be expressed as P i (f)⋅ L ij (f)⋅G N j (f)+ ∑ k∈V,k≠i P k (f) L kj (f) ≥ SINR
    th SU ( BER ∗ SU ) (2) View Source where G is the processing gain, e.g., the length
    of the spreading code. P i (f) represents the transmit power of i on frequency
    f . L ij (f) represents the transmission loss from nodes i to j . The expression
    ∑ k∈V,k≠i P k (f) L kj (f) represents interference at node j . Finally, N j (f)
    is the receiver noise on frequency f . The second constraint models the condition
    that receiver l is not impaired by i ''s transmission. We can also indicate interference
    at node l∈V,l≠j as N I B (f)+Δ I il (f) , where N I B (f) represents noise plus
    interference at l before i ''s transmission, and Δ I il (f) represents the additional
    interference at l caused by i ''s transmission, i.e., P i (f) L il (f) . This
    is expressed as P R l (f) N I l (f)+Δ I il (f) ≥ SINR th ( BER ∗ ),l∈V,l≠j (3)
    View Source where P R B (f) represents the signal power being received at receiver
    l . Since this has to be true for all ongoing transmissions, the constraint can
    be written as P i (f)≤ min l∈V Δ I max l L il (f) = Δ P max i (f) (4) View Source
    where Δ I max l (f)= ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ P R l (f) SINR th PU ( BER ∗ PU ) −N I l (f), P
    R l (f) SINR th SU ( BER ∗ SU ) −N I l (f),  l∈PU,  l∈SU. (5) View Source The
    constraint in (2) states that the SINR at receiver j needs to be above a predefined
    threshold, which means that the power received at receiver j on frequency f needs
    to be sufficiently high to allow receiver j to successfully decode the signal
    given its current noise and interferences. The constraint in (4) states that the
    interference that is generated by i ''s transmission on each frequency should
    not exceed the threshold value that represents the maximum interference that can
    be tolerated by the most vulnerable of i ''s neighbors l∈V,l≠j . Hence, i ''s
    transmit power needs to be bounded on each frequency. The constraint in (2) represents
    a lower bound, and the constraint in (4) represents an upper bound on the transmit
    power for each frequency. By combining constraints (2) and (4), we can define
    for link (i,j) and frequency f S ij (f)= P max i (f)− P min i (f) (6) View Source
    where P max i (f) is defined in (4), and P min i (f) is the value of P i (f) for
    which equality in (2) holds. Let vectors P max i =[ P max i ( f min ), P max i
    ( f min+1 ),…, P max i ( f max )] and P min i =[ P min i ( f min ), P min i (
    f min+1 ),…, P min i ( f max )] denote the maximum and minimum transmit power
    constraints, respectively, for link (i,j) . Hence, we introduce the following
    definition. Definition 1 A spectrum hole for link (i,j) is a set of contiguous
    minibands where S ij (f)≥0 . Fig. 1 illustrates the notion of a spectrum hole.
    As shown in the figure, the spectrum portion [ f i , f i+Δ f i ] is a possible
    spectrum hole for link (i,j) . Fig. 1. Spectrum hole. Show All B. Spectrum Utility
    The control channel is assumed to be time slotted. At each time slot for which
    node i is backlogged and not already transmitting, node i can evaluate the spectrum
    utility for link (i,j) , which is defined as U ij (t)= c ij (t)⋅ [ Q s ∗ i (t)−
    Q s ∗ j (t)] + (7) View Source where s ∗ is the session with a maximal differential
    backlog on link (i,j) . The spectrum utility function is defined based on the
    principle of dynamic back-pressure, which was first introduced in [22], where
    the authors showed that a policy that jointly assigns resources at the physical/link
    layers and routes to maximize the weighted sum of differential backlogs (with
    weights given by the achievable data rates on the link) is throughput optimal,
    in the sense that it is able to keep all network queues finite for any level of
    offered traffic that is within the network capacity region. As will be discussed
    in Section VI, the same result can be derived from a cross-layer network utility
    maximization problem, which can be decomposed into two subproblems. After the
    decomposition, the solution of the routing and scheduling subproblem requires
    maximization of a weighted sum of differential backlogs. Note that, for the sake
    of simplicity, we will drop all time dependencies in the following. Note also
    that the notion of spectrum utility is defined for a specific link (i,j) . In
    (7), c ij (t) represents the achievable capacity for link (i,j) , given the current
    spectrum condition, and is defined as c ij ( F i , P i ) = Δ ∑ f∈ F i =[ f i ,
    f i+Δ f i ] w⋅ log 2 [1+ P i (f) L ij (f)G N j (f)+ I j (f) ] (8) View Source
    where I j (f) represents the interference at j on f . The achievable values of
    c ij depend on the dynamic spectrum-allocation policy, i.e., spectrum-selection
    vector F i =[ f i , f i+Δ f i ] and power allocation vector P i =[ P i (f)] ,
    ∀i∈SU , ∀f∈ F i . The notion of spectrum utility can be thought of as a differential
    backlog, which is inspired by dynamic resource-allocation policies that react
    to the difference ( Q s i − Q s j ) of queue backlogs for a given session [23],
    [24], weighted with dynamic spectrum availability information. Routing with consideration
    of a differential backlog can reduce the probability of relaying data through
    a congested relay node. A large queue size at an intermediate node is interpreted
    as an indicator that the path going through that node is congested and should
    be avoided, whereas a small queue size at an intermediate node indicates low congestion
    on the path going through that node. Therefore, in ROSA, nodes with a smaller
    queue size have a higher probability of being selected as the next hop. We let
    A indicate the active links of secondary users on the DC, i.e., a ij =1 indicates
    that link (i,j) is active, whereas a ij =0 indicates that the link is not active.
    Similarly, we denote A P as the link status of primary users, i.e., a P ij =1
    indicates that the link between primary users i and j is active (input to the
    problem). Thus, at each time slot, the global objective is to find global vectors
    P=[ P 1 , P 2 ,…, P N ] , F=[ F 1 , F 2 ,…, F N ], and A (and, implicitly, C )
    that maximize the sum of spectrum utilities over the activated links, under given
    BER and power constraints. This is expressed by the following problem: P1:Given:
    Find: Maximize: Subject to: BER ∗ SU , G(V,E),  P Bgt , Q,  A P P, F, A ∑ i∈SU

    P Bgt ∀i∈SU 0≤Δ f i ≤Δ f B ∀i∈SU. (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) View Source In the problem
    above, we denote SINR ij as the SINR for link (i,j) . Constraint (10) indicates
    that primary user transmissions should not be impaired. Constraint (11) imposes
    that secondary user transmissions should also satisfy given BER performance, while
    sharing the spectrum with other secondary users. In (12), P Bgt represents the
    instantaneous power available at the cognitive radio. Constraint (13) imposes
    a limit on the bandwidth of cognitive radios. In addition, ∑ i∈SU ( a ij + a ji
    )≤1 , ∀j∈SU must hold. Solving the problem above requires global knowledge of
    feasible rates and is centralized, and its complexity is worst-case exponential.
    This provides the motivation for our distributed algorithm, whose objective is
    to maximize (9) under the constraints that are introduced by cognitive radio networks
    in a distributed fashion. In addition, we show how the distributed algorithm can
    be implemented in a practical protocol. C. Spectrum and Power Allocation Here,
    we present the spectrum and power allocation algorithm executed in a distributed
    fashion at each secondary user to maximize the link capacity given the current
    spectrum condition. Maximizing the capacity of link (i,j) means selecting spectrum
    F i =[ f i , f i+Δ f i ] and corresponding transmit power P i (f) on each frequency
    to maximize the Shannon capacity, i.e., P2:Given: Find: Maximize: Subject to:

    where I j =[ I j ( f min ), I j ( f min+1 ),…, I j ( f max )] , N j =[ N j ( f
    min ), N j ( f min+1 ),…, N j ( f max )] , and L ij =[ L ij ( f min ), L ij (
    f min+1 ),…, L ij ( f max )] with i,j∈SU . The objective of the problem above
    is to find the spectrum hole with maximal capacity given the spectrum condition
    and hardware limitations of the cognitive radio. Note that constraint (15) imposes
    the presence of a spectrum hole, and constraints (16) and (17) indicate the hardware
    restrictions. For a fixed contiguous set of minibands [ f i , f i+Δ f i ] , we
    can obtain a solution to the problem above by relaxing constraints (15) and (16).

    ROSA Algorithm We now present the cross-layer ROSA algorithm, which aims to maximize
    throughput through joint opportunistic routing, dynamic spectrum allocation, and
    transmit power control, while performing scheduling in a distributed way. Every
    backlogged node i , once it senses an idle CCC, performs the following joint routing
    and scheduling algorithm. Find the set of feasible next hops { n s 1 , n s 2 ,…,
    n s k } for the backlogged session s , which are neighbors with positive advance
    toward the destination of s . Node n has positive advance with respect to i iff
    n is closer to the destination than i . Calculate c ij for each link (i,j) , where
    j∈{ n s 1 , n s 2 ,…, n s k } , using Algorithm 1. Schedule s ∗ with next hop
    j ∗ such that ( s ∗ , j ∗ )=argmax( U s ij ). (23) View Source Note that U s ij
    depends on both the capacity and the differential backlog of link (i,j) . Hence,
    routing is performed in such a way that lightly backlogged queues with more spectrum
    resource receive most of the traffic. Once spectrum selection, power allocation,
    and the next hop have been determined, the probability of accessing the medium
    is calculated based on the value of U s ∗ i j ∗ . Nodes with higher U s ∗ i j
    ∗ will get a higher probability of accessing the medium and the transmit. Note
    that U s ij defined in (7) is an increasing function of ( Q s i − Q s j ) , i.e.,
    links with a higher differential backlog may have higher spectrum utility and,
    thus, have a higher probability of being scheduled for transmission. This probability
    is implemented by varying the size of the contention window at the media-access-control
    (MAC) layer. The transmitter i generates a back-off counter B C i that is uniformly
    chosen from the range [0, 2 C W i −1 ] , where C W i is the contention window
    of transmitter i , whose value is a decreasing function Φ() of the optimal spectrum
    utility U s ∗ i j ∗ as follows: C W i =−α⋅ U s ∗ i j ∗ ∑ k∈SU,(k,l)∈E U s kl +β,α>0,β>0
    (24) View Source where ∑ k∈calSU,(k,l)∈calE U s kl represents the total spectrum
    utility of the competing nodes. Note that sender i collects the spectrum utilities
    of its neighbors by overhearing the control packets on the CCC, as discussed in
    Section V. Nodes with smaller values of the back-off counter will have higher
    priority in allocating resources for transmission than nodes with a larger value
    of the back-off counter. With this mechanism, heavily backlogged queues with more
    spectrum resources are given a higher probability of transmitting. Algorithm 2

    shown in Algorithm 2. ROSA opportunistically calculates the next hop depending
    on queuing and spectrum dynamics, according to the spectrum utility function in
    (7). Hence, each packet will potentially follow a different path depending on
    queuing and spectrum dynamics. Hence, packets from the same session may follow
    different paths. At every backlogged node, the next hop is selected with the objective
    of maximizing the spectrum utility. The combination of next hops leads to a multihop
    path. The multihop path discovery terminates when the destination is selected
    as the next hop. If the destination is in the transmission range of the transmitter
    (either a source or an intermediate relay node for that session), the differential
    backlog between the transmitter and the destination is no less than the differential
    backlogs between the transmitter and any other nodes because the queue length
    of the destination is zero. Hence, the destination has a higher probability of
    being selected as the next hop than any other neighboring node of the transmitter.
    Note that the transmitter may still select a node other than the destination as
    the next hop even if the destination is in the transmission range. This can happen,
    for example, if there is no available miniband (low interference) between the
    transmitter and the destination or if the interference on all minibands at that
    time is high, which results in low link capacity between the transmitter and the
    destination. SECTION V. Collaborative Virtual Sensing in the Routing and Dynamic
    Spectrum-Allocation Algorithm As discussed earlier, we assume that each node is
    equipped with two transceivers, one of which is a reconfigurable transceiver that
    can dynamically adjust its waveform and bandwidth for data transmission. 1 The
    other is a conventional transceiver that is employed on the CCC. Handshakes on
    the CCC are conducted in parallel with data transmissions on the DC. We propose
    a new scheme, called collaborative virtual sensing (CVS), that aims at providing
    nodes with accurate spectrum information based on a combination of physical sensing
    and local exchange of information. Scanner-equipped cognitive radios can detect
    primary user transmissions by sensing the DC. In addition, CVS is achieved by
    combining scanning results and information from control packets exchanged on the
    control channel that contain information about transmissions and power used on
    different minibands. ROSA''s MAC logic is illustrated in Fig. 2. Similar to the
    IEEE 802.11 two-way request-to-send (RTS) and clear-to-send (CTS) handshake, backlogged
    nodes contend for spectrum access on the CCC. In particular, backlogged nodes
    must first sense an idle control channel for a time period of distributed interframe
    spacing and then generate a back-off counter. The values of the back-off counter
    are determined under the objective that nodes with higher spectrum utility should
    have a higher channel-access probability. Fig. 2. ROSA''s MAC. Show All The sender
    informs the receiver of the selected frequency interval [ f i , f i+Δf ] using
    an RTS packet. On receiving the RTS packet, the receiver responds by using a CTS
    packet after the short interframe space and tunes its transceiver for data transmission
    on the frequency specified in the RTS packet. As in [7], an additional control
    packet, i.e., data transmission reservation (DTS), is needed for the transmitter
    to announce the spectrum-reservation and transmit power to its neighbors. Here,
    we modify the RTS/CTS/DTS packets and include channel-allocation information to
    allow the nodes to make adaptive decisions. The control packets carry address
    fields of the sender and the receiver, spectrum reservation [ f i , f i+Δf ] ,
    reservation duration field ( t 0 , t 0 +Δt) , information on queue length Q ,
    and power constraints P max  and  P min , all of which are the input parameters
    of ROSA. Based on the collected information, each node learns the spectrum environment
    and queue length information from its neighborhood. Each backlogged node performs
    ROSA to adaptively select the portion of the spectrum to be used and the next
    hop. Note that Δt is the reservation time for the DC and includes the time needed
    for transmitting all the remaining data in the scheduled queue Δ Q i / c ij ,
    plus the time needed to ACK packets. By actively collecting RTS, CTS, and DTS
    packets that are transmitted on the CCC, each node learns the spectrum and queue
    information of its neighborhood. Once RTS/CTS/DTS are successfully exchanged,
    the sender and the receiver tune their transceivers to the selected spectrum portion.
    Before transmitting, they sense the selected spectrum, and, if it is idle, the
    sender begins data transmission without further delay. Note that it is possible
    that the sender or the receiver finds the selected spectrum busy just before data
    transmission. This can be caused by the presence of primary users or by conflicting
    reservations caused by losses of control packets. In this case, the node gives
    up the selected spectrum and goes back to the control channel for further negotiation.
    During the RTS/CTS/DTS exchange, if the sender-selected spectrum cannot be entirely
    used, i.e., the receiver just sensed primary user presence, the receiver will
    not send CTS. The sender will go back to the control channel for further negotiation
    once the waiting-for-CTS timer expires, and the RTS retransmission limit is achieved.
    When data are successfully received, an ACK will be sent by the receiver. The
    transaction is considered completed after the ACK is successfully received. SECTION
    VI. Interpretation of the Routing and Dynamic Spectrum-Allocation Algorithm as
    a NUM Solver Here, we show how ROSA can be interpreted as a distributed dual-based
    solution to a cross-layer network utility maximization problem (NUM) for cognitive
    radio ad hoc networks under the system model described in the previous sections.
    A joint congestion control, routing, and dynamic spectrum-allocation problem for
    cognitive radio networks can be formulated as follows: P3:Given: Find: Maximize:
    Subject to: BER ∗ SU , BER ∗ PU , G(V,E),  P Bgt ,  A P Λ, R, C ∑ i∈SU ∑ s∈S U

    set of the physical rates, values of c ij ∈Co(C) , i.e., they are constrained
    to be within the convex hull of the feasible rate region [24], [25]. The feasible
    set of the physical rates is expressed by c ij = Δ ∑ f∈[ f i , f i+Δ f i ] w⋅
    log 2 [1+ P i (f) L ij (f)G N j (f)+ I j (f) ] SINR f kl ≥ SINR th PU ( BER ∗

    0≤Δ f i ≤Δ f B ∀i∈SU. (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) View Source In the problem above,
    the objective is to maximize a sum of utility functions U i ( λ s i ) , which
    are assumed to be smooth, increasing, concave, and dependent on the local rate
    at node i only [26]. Constraint (26) expresses conservation of flows through the
    routing variables r s ij , which represent the traffic from session s that is
    being transported on link (i,j) . Finally, constraint (27) imposes that the total
    amount of traffic transported on link (i,j) is lower than the capacity of the
    physical link. By taking a duality approach, the Lagrange dual function of P3
    can be obtained by relaxing constraint (26) through Lagrange multipliers Q=[ Q
    s i ] , with i∈SU and s∈S , i.e., L(Q)= max Λ { ∑ i∈SU ∑ s∈S ( U i ( λ s i )−
    Q s i λ s i )} + max R,C { ∑ i∈SU ∑ j∈SU,j≠i ∑ s∈S r s ij ( Q s i − Q s j )}(33)
    View Source where variables indicating data rates are still constrained to be
    c ij ∈Co(C) , and C is defined by constraints (28)–(32). In the above decomposition,
    the first term of (33) represents the congestion control functionality (which
    can be carried out independently), whereas the second term represents routing,
    scheduling, and physical rate allocation. Let Λ ∗ (Q), R ∗ (Q), and  C ∗ (Q) be
    the vectors of optimum values for a given set of Lagrange multipliers Q . While
    λ s,∗ i (Q) can be locally computed at each source i of session s , R ∗ (Q) and
    C ∗ (Q) require global knowledge and centralized algorithms. Fig. 3. (a) Throughput

    solve the above problem, the following actions need to be performed at each time

    Scheduling and routing. For each link (i,j) , choose the session that maximizes
    the differential backlog between the transmitter and the receiver, i.e., s ∗ ij
    =arg max s { Q s i − Q s j }. (35) View Source Then, set r s ∗ ij ij (t)= c ij
    (t) . Assign link rates c ij (t) to maximize the weighted sum of the link rates
    of the network, where the weights correspond to differential backlogs, i.e., C(t)=arg
    max C { ∑ i∈SU ∑ j∈SU,j≠i c ij ( Q s ∗ ij i − Q s ∗ ij j )}. (36) View Source
    Note that the maximization above is analogous to the dynamic back-pressure algorithm
    in [24] and [25]. Update Lagrange multipliers (queues) as Q s i (t+1)=[ Q s i
    (t)+ϵ( ∑ k∈SU,k≠i r s ki (t) − ∑ l∈SU,l≠i r s il (t)+ λ s i (t))] + .(37) View
    Source Note that the Lagrange function is always convex, and thus, the multipliers
    can be computed using a subgradient algorithm. Clearly, the bottleneck of the
    above solution lies in the routing and scheduling component in (36). Solving (36)
    requires global knowledge of feasible rates and a centralized algorithm. It has
    been shown that the complexity of this family of schedule problems is worst case
    exponential [22], [27]. The exact distributed solution of (36) is, thus, infeasible.
    However, it can be shown that the closer a policy gets to maximizing (36), the
    closer the policy gets to the capacity region of the network [24]. This provides
    the rationale for our distributed algorithm, whose objective is to maximize (36)
    under the constraints expressed by (30) and (31), together with (32) for cognitive
    radio ad hoc networks. SECTION VII. Simulation Results To evaluate ROSA, we have
    developed an object-oriented packet-level discrete-event simulator, which models
    in detail all layers of the communication protocol stack as described in this
    paper. We first concentrate on evaluating the network throughput, delay, and fairness.
    Then, we compare the performance of the proposed distributed algorithm and the
    centralized algorithm. In all simulation scenarios, we considered a common set
    of parameters. A grid topology of 49 nodes is deployed in a 6000 × 6000 m area.
    We initiate sessions between randomly selected but disjoint source–destination
    pairs. Sessions are constant-bit-rate sources with a data rate of 2 Mbit/s each.
    We set the available spectrum to be 54–72 MHz, which is a portion of the TV band
    that secondary users are allowed to use when there is no licensed (primary) user
    operating on it. We restrict the bandwidth that is usable by cognitive radios
    to be 2, 4, and 6 MHz. The bandwidth of the CCC is 2 MHz. The duration of a time
    slot is set to 20 μ s. Parameters α and β in (24) are set to 10 and 10, respectively.
    A larger CW can reduce the collision rate but may lead to lower utilization of
    the control channel caused by back-off. These values are implicitly optimized
    based on the network size in this paper. The secondary user SINR threshold is
    9 dB, and the primary user SINR threshold is 19 dB in the simulation. We average
    over multiple trials to obtain a small relative error (within 10% of the average
    value). The data rate is a stepwise approximation of (8), which can model, among
    others, different modulation schemes that are available for different SINR values.
    Fig. 3(a) illustrates the network throughput that is achieved by ROSA with time
    as the number of active sessions varies. With a higher number of active sessions,
    ROSA achieves a higher overall network throughput by adaptively adjusting the
    bandwidth to enable concurrent parallel transmissions. We compare the performance
    of ROSA with two alternative schemes, both of which rely on the same knowledge
    of the environment as ROSA. In particular, we consider routing with fixed allocation
    (RFA) as the solution where routing is based on a differential backlog (as in
    Section IV) with a predefined channel and transmit power, and routing with dynamic
    allocation (RDA) as the solution where routing is based on the shortest path with
    dynamic channel selection and transmit power allocation without considering a
    differential backlog. We compare against the three solutions by varying the number
    of sessions that are injected into the network and plot the network throughput
    (the sum of individual session throughput) in Fig. 4(a), which shows that ROSA
    outperforms RFA and RDA. When there are a few active sessions, e.g., 2 or 4, ROSA,
    RDA, and RFA obtain similar throughput performance. However, with more active
    sessions, ROSA and RDA perform much better than RFA since they adaptively use
    the best among possible spectrum allocations and routes. RDA restricts packets
    forwarding to the receiver that is closest to the destination, even if the link
    capacity is very low or the receiver is heavily congested. In contrast, ROSA,
    by considering both the link capacity and the differential backlog, is more flexible
    and may route packets along paths that temporarily take them farther from the
    destination, particularly if these paths eventually lead to links that have higher
    capacity and/or that are not as heavily utilized by other traffic. The improvement
    obtained by ROSA is more visible when the number of active sessions increases.
    Fig. 4(b) shows the delay performance for the three solutions. RFA, on average,
    delivers a larger delay than the other two solutions. The above delay performance
    gap grows as the number of sessions increases. As shown in Fig. 4(b), ROSA provides
    very low and stable delay performance as the number of sessions increases. ROSA
    and RDA yield almost the same delay performance. Fig. 4(c) shows the impact of
    the source data rate per session on the performance of throughput and delay. We
    evaluate the throughput and delay performance as the traffic load per session
    increases from 100 kbit/s to 8 Mbit/s. As shown in Fig. 4(c), the throughput achieved
    by ROSA linearly increases as the load per session increases. As the load increases,
    ROSA obtains a significant throughput gain. Fig. 3(b) shows Jain''s fairness index,
    which is calculated as (∑ r s ) 2 /S∗∑( r s ) 2 , where r s is the throughput
    of session s , and S is the total number of active sessions. As shown in the figure,
    the overall fairness among competing sessions is improved by ROSA using a prioritized
    channel-access scheme. When the sessions are dynamic, the protocol is supposed
    to be stable since the algorithm adaptively adjusts channel selection and power
    allocation according to the current transmissions. We compare the performance
    in terms of network spectrum utility defined in (9) of P1 between our distributed
    algorithm and the centralized algorithm. We consider a cognitive radio network
    with ten nodes. We assume that there are seven secondary users and three primary
    users that are associated with three different minibands. Every primary user holds
    a license for one specific miniband and can only occupy its assigned miniband.
    We activate sessions between randomly selected but disjoint source–destination
    pairs among the seven secondary users. Fig. 3(c) shows that although ROSA uses
    only local information and has low complexity, the performance is within 75% of
    the optimal (centralized) solution. However, the centralized solution is obtained
    with global information and has exponential computational complexity. SECTION
    VIII. Conclusions We have proposed, discussed, and analyzed ROSA, which is a distributed
    algorithm for joint opportunistic routing and dynamic spectrum access in multihop
    cognitive radio networks. ROSA has been derived by decomposing a cross-layer network
    utility maximization problem formulated under the constraints of cognitive radio
    networks. Through discrete-event simulation, ROSA has been shown to outperform
    simpler solutions for inelastic traffic. Future work will aim at deriving a theoretical
    lower bound on the performance of ROSA. In addition, we are currently implementing
    ROSA on a software-defined radio platform based on an open-source platform built
    on GNU Radio and USRP2. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics

    portion of the spectrum along with inefficient usage of the licensed spectrum
    gave impetus for a new spectrum allocation policy, the main purpose of which is
    to improve spectrum efficiency through opportunistic spectrum access. Cognitive
    radios have been proposed as a key enabling technology for such an opportunistic
    policy. One of the key challenges to enabling multihop CR communications is how
    to perform opportunistic medium access control while limiting the interference
    imposed on licensed users. In this article we highlight the unique characteristics
    of multihop cognitive radio networks, discuss key MAC design challenges specific
    to such networks, and present some of the work that has been done on MAC design
    for CRNs. Published in: IEEE Network ( Volume: 23, Issue: 4, July-August 2009)

    Publisher: IEEE Recently, cognitive radios (CRs) have emerged as a promising technology
    to enhance spectrum utilization through opportunistic on-demand spectrum access.
    Traditionally, the radio spectrum is statically licensed to different organizations.
    Spectrum measurements by FCC and other organizations (e.g., XG DARPA initiative)
    indicated significant temporal and geographical variations in the utilization
    of the licensed spectrum, ranging from 15 to 85 percent. As an example, the actual
    measurements taken in Chicago for the frequency bands below 3 GHz indicate severe
    underutilization in the spectrum [1]. Specifically, the average spectrum utilization
    during the measurement period (two days) was 17.4 percent. These measurements
    motivated the need for a more efficient and adaptive spectrum allocation policy.
    In response to such measurements, the FCC has been revising its regulations to
    allow opportunistic access to the spectrum. CR technology offers such opportunistic
    capability. CRs are mainly characterized by their cognitive capability and reconfigurability.
    The cognitive capability provides spectrum awareness, whereas reconfigurability
    enables a CR user to dynamically adapt its operating parameters to the surrounding
    radio frequency (RF) environment. More specifically, the CR can be programmed
    to transmit and receive over widely separated frequency bands, adapt its transmit
    power, and determine its optimal transmission strategy. A typical CR network (CRN)
    environment consists of a number of primary radio networks (PRNs) that are licensed
    to operate over orthogonal spectrum bands1 and one (secondary) CRN. All networks
    coexist within the same geographical space. Figure 1 shows a conceptual composition
    view of a multihop CRN environment. Primary radio (PR) users that belong to a
    given PRN share the same licensed spectrum. CR users form an opportunistic network.
    They can opportunistically access the entire spectrum available to all PRNs. An
    important characteristic of a CRN is that users must operate using relatively
    low transmission power to avoid degrading the performance of PR users. The above
    peculiar characteristics of CRNs distinguish them from traditional multichannel
    wireless networks. Although many medium access control (MAC) protocols have been
    proposed for traditional multichannel wireless networks, these protocols are not
    well suited to the unique characteristics of CRNs. Specifically, the absence of
    PR users in multichannel wireless networks makes their protocols fundamentally
    different from CRN MAC protocols. In order to design a good MAC protocol for multihop
    CRNs, the following attributes are required: The protocol should be transparent
    to PR users (i.e., does not require coordination with them). The protocol should
    provide guarantees on PRNs’ performance. The protocol should allow cooperation
    among neighboring CR users at the MAC layer to improve spectrum efficiency and
    fairness among them. The protocol should make efficient sensing and spectrum assignment
    decisions to explore both unused (white) and partially used (grey) spectrum holes.
    These decisions should account for channel dynamics due to PR users. The protocol
    should provide an effective distributed coordination scheme for exchanging control
    information without assuming a predefined dedicated control channel. Figure 1.
    Opportunistic access environment containing one CRN and NPRNs. Show All Many researchers
    are currently engaged in developing efficient MAC protocols that attempt to address
    the above design requirements. In this article we present a survey of spectrum
    access protocols proposed thus far for multihop CRNs. Our aim is to give a better
    understanding of the current research issues in this emerging field. We start
    by discussing the key design issues in developing MAC protocols for such networks.
    Then we present recent progress in MAC protocol design for CRNs. The article concludes
    with a discussion of open research issues. Design Challenges Novel spectrum access/sharing
    protocols and algorithms are needed to effectively tackle the unique resource
    constraints and dynamic operating environment of CRNs. In this section we discuss
    the main challenges in designing such protocols and give an overview of recent
    developments in this domain. Control Channel Dilemma In a multihop CRN environment
    a reliable mechanism for exchanging control information (transmitter-receiver
    hand-shake, sensing information exchange, etc.) is needed. Typically, in order
    to support such a mechanism, a licensed common control channel (CCC) is often
    dedicated for control information exchange. A number of MAC protocols for CRNs
    were designed assuming the existence of such a channel. While this approach is
    simple, it is contradictory to the opportunistic nature of CRNs and can cause
    a single point of failure. In addition, the CCC can become a performance bottleneck
    under high traffic load. To solve this issue, various solutions have been proposed,
    none of which are totally satisfactory. In the following we classify these solutions
    into three different classes. Non-Dedicated CCC Many MAC protocols for CRNs were
    designed assuming a predetermined non-dedicated CCC that is known to all users.
    This control channel can be implemented as a channel in an unlicensed band (e.g.,
    ISM band) or an underlay ultra-wideband (UWB) channel [2]. UWB is a radio technology
    that can transmit at a very low power density (in watts per hertz) in a short
    range by spreading the signal over a large portion of the spectrum. Therefore,
    its impact on PRNs will be very negligible. The aforementioned non-dedicated schemes
    have major design issues that make their practicality questionable. Specifically,
    using UWB leads to a small control transmission range, which might jeopardize
    CRN connectivity. On the other hand, using a fixed CCC can cause a single point
    of failure, become a performance bottleneck, and raise security issues. Worse
    yet, in a multihop environment, a CCC may not be available to all CR users (because
    non-neighboring CR users may have different views of spectrum availability). Dynamic
    Local Control Channel Neighboring CR users typically have a similar view of spectrum
    conditions. Accordingly, grouping (i.e., clustering) algorithms can be used to
    enable reliable coordination between CR users. Each group dynamically selects
    a local CCC for exchanging control information [3]. However, applying such an
    approach in multihop CRNs is daunted by several deployment challenges, such as
    ensuring connectivity (i.e., different groups adopt different local control channels),
    determining group sizes, identifying the members of each group, and selecting
    the optimal fre-quency for a new CCC (i.e., due to the dynamic nature of CRNs,
    local CCC renegotiation is very frequent). Hopping-Based Control Channel A hopping-based
    control channel is a promising technique to overcome the need for a CCC and alleviate
    the control channel bottleneck problem. According to this approach, CR users hop
    across all licensed channels according to a predefined channel hopping sequence.
    During hopping, a CR transmitter-receiver pair exchanges control information to
    decide which channels to use for data transmission. When they successfully exchange
    control information, the communicating CR users stop hopping and start data transmission.
    Once done, both transmitter and receiver resynchronize back with the hopping sequence.
    The main difficulty with such an approach is its synchronization requirements.
    Specifically, this approach requires stringent time/channel synchronization between
    CR users. CR Transmission Power Control Coexistence of CR and PR users in the
    same area poses a new challenge regarding protecting PR performance. In a mixed
    CRN/PRN environment, three types of interference need to be accounted for: CR-to-CR
    interference, PR-to-CR interference, and CR-to-PR interference. The latter is
    the most critical, because of its direct influence on PRNs’ performance. Thus,
    CR transmission powers over the various PR bands need to be regulated such that
    the PR users’ reception is not negatively affected by CR transmissions. To address
    this issue, a frequency-dependent power mask on the CR transmissions is often
    adopted (Fig. 2). This mask reflects the maximum permissible transmission power
    vector of a CR user. Depending on whether or not a CR transmission can overlap
    with PR transmissions, existing solutions for regulating CR transmission power
    can be classified into two types: binary and multilevel. Figure 2. Frequency-dependent
    power mask for CR user k. Show All Binary-Type Power Mask Model Most MAC protocols
    for CRNs focus on identifying and avoiding interference with PR transmissions
    [4]–[6]. In these protocols CR users can only exploit white spaces that are free
    of PR interferers. This type of opportunistic spectrum sharing requires a CR user
    to perform sensing before attempting to transmit. Accordingly, the CR user identifies
    whether or not a given PR band is idle. If so, the CR user can transmit. Under
    the assumption of perfect sensing, this approach ensures nonoverlapping (collisionfree)
    band occupancy between CR and PR users. In this case the corresponding power regulating
    scheme can be viewed as a binary-type power mask over each PR band. Formally,
    for band i,i=1, …,N , the CR transmission power is 0 if any PR user operates on
    band i , or P (i) max if none of them is active. P (i) max is the smaller of the
    FCC regulatory maximum transmission power over that band and the maximum power
    supported by the CR''s battery. However, the efficiency of this type of scheme
    depends heavily on the ability to predict/detect the presence of PR signals over
    various bands (i.e., the scheme requires a robust algorithm for determining white
    spaces). If CR users are unaware of the location and transmission technology of
    nearby PR users, detecting and identifying white bands is still a major challenge.
    Binary-type power mask can also result in nonoptimal spectrum utilization. It
    has been shown that allowing CR users to exploit both white and grey bands gives
    much better spectrum utilization [7]. One example of binary-type power control
    for CRNs is given in [5], where the authors proposed two random access schemes
    to exploit the white band opportunities under given constraints on the CR-to-PR
    collision probability and overlapping collision time. Under such constraints and
    assuming perfect sensing, the authors provided closed-form expressions of the
    capacity limit of CR users. Multilevel Power Mask Model Using a multilevel power
    mask allows for simultaneous spectrum sharing between neighboring CR and PR users,
    which can potentially lead to better spectrum utilization. According to this approach,
    CR users can exploit both white and grey bands. This model presents a general
    form of spectrum opportunity and provides a generalization of the widely used
    binary-type power mask. Thus far, both static and dynamic power masks have been
    used in developing MAC protocols for multihop CRNs. In the case of a static power
    mask, the mask is assumed to be fixed and the same for all CR users. However,
    this assumption is hardly true for a generic multihop CRN (because spectrum utilization
    may significantly vary in time and space). As a result, for a generic multihop
    CRN, the design of a good MAC protocol should be based on an adaptive/dynamic
    power mask. Determination of the Power Mask The determination of an appropriate
    power mask is certainly an important topic. The proposed spectrum sharing protocols
    in [7], [8] were designed such that the maximum transmission powers of CR users
    over various bands are dynamically computed based on the PR''s interference margins
    and local traffic conditions. In [8] the authors provided a neighborhood-dependent
    adaptive power mask on CR transmissions that ensures a statistical (soft) guarantee
    on the performance of PRNs. The proposed solution guarantees that the outage probability
    ( p out ) of a PR user, defined as the probability that the total interference
    power at a PR receiver exceeds the maximum tolerable interference, is less than
    a given bound β . The authors provided closed-form expressions for the resulting
    power mask. Simulation results in [8] show that the proposed MAC protocol improves
    spectrum utilization and statistically guarantees the performance of PR users
    under different traffic loads and for different values of β . The FCC defined
    the interference temperature model in 2003, which provides a metric for measuring
    the interference experienced by PR users. It has been shown that using this model
    to constrain the CR transmission power results in very poor performance [7]. Based
    on this fact, Clancy proposed alternate usages for interference temperature that
    attempt to improve the CRN throughput without negatively impacting the PRN s’
    performance. The basic idea is to constrain the CR transmission power over partially
    used (grey) PR bands using the interference temperature model while leaving the
    CR transmission power over idle (white) bands unconstrained. This can be achieved
    by using a controllable transmission waveform whose power spectral density is
    non-uniform. However, the proposed scheme does not provide explicit guarantees
    on the performance of PRNs. It is worth mentioning that due to the lack of specific
    technical rules to implement the interference temperature model, the FCC abandoned
    this model in 2007 [9]. Spectrum Access/Shoring As mentioned before, spectrum
    access/sharing schemes for traditional multichannel wireless networks are not
    well suited to the unique features and application requirements of CRNs. These
    schemes are often based on a greedy strategy that selects the best available channels
    for a given transmission. When such greedy assignment is employed in a CRN, the
    blocking probability for CR transmissions can increase, leading to a reduction
    in the CR network throughput [2]. Hence, new spectrum sharing algorithms are needed
    to improve the performance of CRNs. Research in this domain includes both centralized
    and distributed algorithms. We focus on distributed approaches in this article,
    as they are more suitable for multihop ad hoc networks. The optimal spectrum sharing
    (assignment) problem in CRNs that maximizes the spectrum utilization is known
    to be NP-hard. Hence, the proposed algorithms are heuristic in nature. In general,
    existing spectrum access/sharing protocols in CRNs can be classified according
    to two aspects: the radio front-end technology and the spectrum-occupancy model
    (Fig. 3). In the following we describe the various categories of spectrum access
    protocols and give an overview of the main ones proposed in the literature. It
    should be mentioned that some of these protocols belong to more than one category.
    However, for simplicity we list them only under one category. Figure 3. Categorization
    of spectrum access techniques in CRNs according to the employed radio technology
    and channel occupancy model. Show All Classification Based on Radio Technology
    Hardware-Based Schemes Several spectrum sharing solutions for CRNs have been designed
    assuming hardware-based radio technology. In these schemes the number of parallel
    channels that can be simultaneously used at a CR user is limited by the number
    of the available transceivers. Based on this number, approaches belonging to this
    category can be further classified into two groups: single-channel and multichannel
    assignment. Single-Chcnnel Assignment A number of CRN MAC proto-cols that assume
    a single radio per user have been proposed. In these protocols a CR user can only
    transmit/receive over one of the available bands at a time. One example is in
    [6], where the authors discussed the hardware limitations of practical CRs, including
    partial spectrum sensing and single-radio constraints. They investigated how to
    conduct efficient and distributed spectrum sharing design under such hardware
    constraints. They formulated the spectrum sensing/sharing process as an optimal
    stopping problem. Both optimal and approximation stopping rules were obtained.
    According to the obtained rules, each CR user selects the best channel that maximizes
    its throughput. Multichannel Assignment MAC protocols that support multi-channel
    parallel transmissions can significantly improve CRN performance [10]. In practice,
    to support parallel transmissions the radio system typically has multiple radio
    transceivers that can be used simultaneously. Each transceiver is tuned to a given
    carrier frequency with fixed bandwidth, allowing a CR user to choose from a fixed
    number of channels. This hard-warebased implementation is referred to as multichannel
    multiradio (MC-MR) technology. It is worth mentioning that many multichannel spectrum
    sharing solutions in the context of CRNs are based on MC-MR technology. The potential
    benefits of using multichannel parallel transmission in CRNs were demonstrated
    in [10]. The carrier sense multiple access (CSMA)-based MAC protocol in [10] considers
    multiple transceivers per CR user, which has been shown to achieve considerable
    throughput improvement over its single-channel counterpart. The proposed protocol
    jointly optimizes the channel/power/rate assignment according to the surrounding
    interference, assuming a given power mask. It explores different channel combinations
    to seek the optimal one that has the minimum number of channels and requires the
    minimum transmission power while satisfying the imposed power mask and the rate
    demand constraints. Software-Based Schemes A common assumption in MC-MR networks
    is that there is a set of common channels available for every CR user, each with
    fixed carrier frequency and bandwidth. Consequently, MC-MR technology allows a
    CR user to choose from a fixed (limited) number of common channels. However, such
    an assumption is hardly true for a generic multihop CRN, where the spectrum availabilities
    may significantly vary in time, frequency, and space. To deal with this issue,
    software-defined radio (SDR) has been developed to provide a multichannel transmission
    capability with tunable parameters (tunable carrier frequency, bandwidth, number
    of channels, etc.). SDRs are more powerful and flexible than hardware-based radios.
    Specifically, the number of multiple (contiguous or non-contiguous) bands that
    can be used by a single SDR is typically much larger than that supported by MC-MR.
    More important, SDRs have the capability of enabling CR communications with variable-width
    bands [11]. In some sense, hardware-based CRNs can be considered a special case
    of SDR-based CRNs. Figure 4. Variable time-spectrum opportunities. Show All Several
    spectrum access protocols in CRNs have been proposed with the assumption of variable
    spectrum assignment. Variable assignment strategies facilitate the design of efficient
    spectrum sharing protocols in CRNs, have great potential to improve overall spectrum
    utilization, and account for spectrum heterogeneity in multihop CRNs. The need
    for adaptive variable spectrum sharing protocols was investigated in [4]. The
    authors introduced the concept of variable width time-spectrum blocks to model
    spectrum sharing/reservation in CRNs. A time-spectrum block is defined as a unit
    of spectrum reservation (Fig. 4). Based on this concept, the authors formulated
    the spectrum allocation/reservation problem as packing of time-spectrum blocks
    in a two-dimensional time-frequency space such that the rate demands of all CR
    users are satisfied as well as possible. Both centralized and distributed protocols
    were proposed. The simulation results in [4] show that variable spectrum assignment
    schemes significantly outperform fixed-bandwidth assignment schemes. Classification
    Based on Channel Occupancy Model Depending on the system setup and the resulting
    interference relationships between CR users (i.e., CR-to-PR, PR-to-CR, and CR-to-CR),
    spectrum access protocols for CRNs can be classified into two categories: protocol
    and physical. Protocol Model Under the protocol model, the CR-to-CR interference
    is eliminated by enforcing exclusive channel occupancy between CR users, whereby
    a channel occupied by a CR user cannot be simultaneously allocated to another
    CR user in the same vicinity (Fig. 5a). Consequently, only the PR-to-CR and CR-to-PR
    interferences are accounted for. MAC protocols belonging to this group generally
    follow the CSMA with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) paradigm, with extensions to
    allow for the control packet handshake between communicating CR users. Communicating
    CR users perform a three-way handshake over a CCC. During the handshake process,
    the communicating CR users exchange control information (the list of currently
    available channels at the transmitter rate demand, etc.), conduct the channel
    assignment, and announce the outcome of the channel assignment and the duration
    of the transmission to their neighbors. Figure 5. Scenarios in which CR transmitters
    C and E can/cannot reuse the channels assigned to A The dashed circles indicate
    A''s control-transmission range: a) exclusive channel occupancy; b) interference
    channel model. Show All Figure 6. Scenarios in which two CR transmissions can/cannot
    proceed simultaneously [2]: a) traditional channel assignment; b) distance-dependent
    channel assignment. Show All An interesting consideration of the dependence between
    the RF signal attenuation model and the transmission distance when assigning channels
    for CR transmissions was introduced in [2]. This distance-and traffic-dependent
    approach has great potential to improve spectrum utilization. To illustrate, consider
    an environment with two PRNs and one CRN. PRN 1 operates over a low-frequency
    band (CH1), while PRN 2 operates over a high-frequency band (CH2). Suppose that
    PRN 2 introduces a higher average PR-to-CR interference. Consequently, a CR receiver
    experiences a higher average signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) over
    CH1 than over CH2. Assume that two CR users, A and (C , need to send data to CR
    users B and D , respectively (Fig. 6). Suppose that the distance between A and
    B ( d AB ) is less than that between C and D ( d CD ) . Figure 6a shows that when
    the CR users employ the traditional multichannel greedy approach, transmission
    A→B uses CH1, whereas transmission C→D uses CH2. A→B is allowed to proceed because
    it operates over a low-carrier-frequency channel with low PR-to-CR interference
    for a short transmission distance. On the other hand, C→D requires relatively
    higher transmission power to overcome the high attenuation associated with the
    high-frequency/high-interference channel and the long transmission distance. If
    the required transmission power exceeds the specified power mask, C→D cannot proceed.
    However, both A→B and C→D have much better chances of proceeding simultaneously
    if each CR transmitter selects channels while keeping in mind the constraining
    power mask of the other transmitter (Fig. 6b). The simulation results in [2] show
    that distance-and traffic-aware MAC protocols can significantly improve CRN throughput
    while preserving fairness. Physical Model One common limitation of protocol-model-based
    MAC protocols is their sole reliance on CSMA/CA for accessing/reserving the shared
    wireless spectrum. Although CSMA/CA is fundamentally needed to reduce the likelihood
    of CR collisions due to the hidden terminal problem, such a mechanism may significantly
    degrade spectrum efficiency. Specifically, it negatively impacts spectrum utilization
    by not allowing multiple concurrent CR transmissions within the same neighborhood
    to overlap in frequency. Various attempts were made to develop MAC protocols for
    CRNs that assume an interference channel model. According to this model, neighboring
    CR users have the same channel access rights and may share the same channel simultaneously.
    This category accounts for all three possible interference relationships in the
    MAC design. Little is known about the optimal achievable rate region for such
    a setup. We use the example in Fig. 5 to illustrate channel access under the physical
    model. Assume that CR users A, C , and E need to send data to CR users B, D ,
    and F respectively. According to the exclusive channel occupancy policy, transmissions
    A→B, C→D , and E→F cannot overlap in their data channels (Fig. 5a). The three
    transmissions can proceed simultaneously only if nonintersecting channels can
    be found to support their rate requirements. On the other hand, under the physical
    model, transmissions A→B, C→D , and E→F may overlap in their data channels if
    each CR transmitter selects its transmission power while keeping in mind its interference
    to unintended receivers (Fig. 5b). As an example, the CRN MAC protocol in [12]
    attempts to improve the spectrum efficiency by allowing multiple neighboring CR
    transmissions to overlap in frequency bands. It allows neighboring CR pairs to
    be first involved in an admission phase, then iteratively negotiate their transmission
    powers and channel assignment through a distributed price-based iterative water-filling
    algorithm. Summary and Open Issues Providing an efficient distributed MAC protocol
    for multihop CRNs is a challenging problem. The design of MAC protocols for such
    networks should leverage the unique capabilities of CRs and the peculiar characteristics
    of their multihop environment. This article gives a broad overview of the key
    design challenges in developing efficient MAC protocols for CRNs. It also surveys
    and classifies the recently proposed MAC protocols in the literature. We surmise
    that the most compelling challenges are how to provide effective distributed coordination
    between CR users without relying on the existence of a prespecified CCC, how to
    compute an appropriate neighbor-hood-dependent power mask that provides guarantees
    on the performance of PR users, and how to provide an optimal spectrum sharing
    scheme in order to maximize the spectrum utilization. Many interesting open problems
    remain to be addressed. To deal with the spectrum heterogeneity in multihop environments,
    the discussions provided in this survey strongly advo cate a dynamic neighborhood-dependent
    power mask approach as a good candidate to address the CR transmission power issue.
    The practical aspects of such an approach is yet to be explored. The design of
    an effective coordination scheme is still an open problem. Various solutions have
    been proposed in this domain, none of which are totally satisfactory. Because
    of the dynamic nature of CRNs, we believe that the design of an effective distributed
    coordination scheme must be based on a transmission technology/coordination technique
    that provides reliable CR communications, security, connectivity, and PR user
    protection. Variable bandwidth assignment schemes are promising, but their feasibility
    and design assumptions need to be evaluated. For instance, most of the proposed
    protocols are best effort and do not provide any QoS guarantees on CRN performance.
    Although many interesting approaches have been proposed, most of them only cover
    a subset of the challenges related to CRN MAC design. Hence, for efficient MAC
    design, more research is needed to address the issues along the lines introduced
    in this survey. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Footnotes

    Abstract Opportunistic spectrum access (OSA) networks have emerged as a hot research
    topic following the publication of Mitola’s seminal paper on cognitive radio network.
    Success of such networks will depend on efficient spectrum sensing techniques
    as well as effective medium access control protocols that will offer efficient
    mechanisms for dynamic spectrum allocation, coordination and management of spectrum
    heterogeneity. Work on such issues have just started and is still in a rudimentary
    stage. The main purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of
    the research done at the MAC layer of the OSA networks, especially with reference
    to ad hoc network design and spark more research in this area. A classification
    of the MAC layer protocols used in OSA networks is provided, and the essential
    features of the different MAC layer protocols for OSA networks are thoroughly
    analyzed and compared. Finally, open research issues for the MAC layer are discussed.

    access control (MAC)Opportunistic spectrum access (OSA) 1. Introduction 1.1. Opportunistic
    spectrum access Recently a new paradigm has emerged in the design of unlicensed
    (or secondary) wireless networking systems based on the idea of dynamic spectrum
    sharing in the licensed (or primary) spectrum. This way the overall spectrum utilization
    can be effectively improved. This new concept is popularly referred in the researching
    community as the dynamic spectrum access (DSA) or opportunistic spectrum access
    (OSA) or cognitive radio networks (CRN). The origin of such a concept owes a lot
    to the initial work by Mitola [1] who envisaged secondary user networks to co-exist
    with the primary user system if the secondary users could reliably implement a
    set of operations called a cognitive cycle. Later in 2002 the Federal Communications
    Commission (FCC) published a report called ‘Spectrum Policy Task Force’ [2] which
    revealed that majority of the spectrum allotted for licensed services viz. UHF
    and VHF bands in TV spectrum, cellular communication bands, etc. was either underutilized
    or unoccupied. The combination of the ideas presented in [1], [2] motivated many
    researchers world wide to contribute to the development of the cognitive radio
    networks. The underutilized or unused portions in the licensed spectrum are called
    spectrum holes. The spectrum holes are observed to be distributed both temporally
    and spatially. Such a phenomenon is termed as spectrum heterogeneity. The basic
    requirement for a secondary user to overcome the spectrum heterogeneity is to
    have a special spectrum sensing mechanism to reliably sense the primary user activity
    and distinguish it from other secondary user transmissions. Recently several device
    prototypes which can sense the spectrum holes in the TV spectrum were published
    in the FCC report [3]. These prototypes were evaluated based on their sensing
    reliability which was measured in terms of the probability of misidentification
    and the probability of overlooking a primary user’s status (idle or busy). According
    to Mitola [1], [24], during a cognitive cycle the secondary user senses the licensed
    spectrum for an idle channel, estimates the channel capacity in order to calculate
    the data rate to be used for data transmission and convey the information to the
    intended receiver or neighboring secondary users. Additionally, Haykin [24] suggested
    transmit power control schemes for minimizing the interference to the primary
    user based on certain pre-conceived interference thresholds called the interference
    temperature (also discussed in [2]). Haykin [24] emphasized the need for the secondary
    users to regulate their transmit power and data rates so that the quality of the
    data transmission and the user density in the secondary user network can be improved.
    1.2. OSA networks The concept of the OSA networks or cognitive radio networks
    (CRN) is still in its infancy considering the state of art in the electronic hardware,
    processing power, current spectrum allocation policies and real-time implementation
    issues. The word “cognitive” implies that the secondary user is attributed with
    special properties such as intelligence (acquired through learning) and knowledge
    (acquired through intelligence). In other words the secondary user is expected
    to perform two important functions namely, adaptation and reconfiguration. Thus,
    a secondary user (cognitive radio) should be able to not only sense the spectrum
    but also address issues such as • When to sense a channel? • When to use a channel?
    • How to use a channel? • How to co-exist with other secondary users? The challenges
    in the hardware are mostly addressed by schemes such as the software defined radio
    (SDR) [1] or other application specific integrated chips (ASIC) [4]. Unlike a
    conventional wireless network like IEEE 802.11 the cognitive radio network requires
    greater coordination among its users due to spectrum heterogeneity. Indeed coordination
    may be described at two levels namely • Coordination of operations within the
    protocol stack of a secondary user. • Coordination among the neighboring users
    (which depends on the distributed algorithms). Hence the secondary users of the
    OSA networks require fresh design for the protocol stack (MAC layer, Routing layer,
    Transport layer) which incorporates the dynamic nature of the physical layer.
    1.3. Purpose of the paper The purpose of this paper is to explain the medium access
    control (MAC) protocols in OSA networks (especially ad hoc networks). Because
    of the spectrum heterogeneity the MAC protocols have to operate based on the spectrum
    sensing results. It is possible that the secondary users in the same OSA network
    have different spectrum allocations. Therefore, the data transmission has to be
    conducted on different channels at different time instants depending on the channel
    occupancy statistics. The details of higher layer protocols can be obtained from
    Akyildiz et al. [5]. Legacy MAC protocols like carrier sense multiple access (CSMA)
    used in IEEE 802.11 networks were designed for homogeneous spectrum scenario.
    If the spectrum allocation is both spatially and temporally varying it may not
    be possible to find a common coordination channel (or control channel) for all
    the users in the network. Hence the legacy MAC protocols cannot be applied directly.
    Consider a scenario where a secondary user using a single transceiver experiences
    a temporally varying spectrum allocation, it may not be possible to observe the
    channel status on all the channels at the same time and further coordinate with
    other ongoing transmissions on these channels. Hence the legacy MAC protocols
    have to be applied differently, perhaps by sharing the spectrum sensing information
    with other secondary users and switching between the available channels accordingly.
    There are several MAC layer issues which can be addressed such as • Control channel
    configuration. • Cooperative or coordinated spectrum sensing. • Spectrum sensing
    policies. • Spectrum allocation. • Spectrum access and spectrum sharing. • Interference
    mitigation with transmit power control. • Multi-channel hidden terminal problem.
    • Multicast and broadcast issues. • Mobility of the secondary users. • QoS supportive
    MAC. Several MAC protocols (though they are not applicable to all primary user
    systems) are available in the literature [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16],
    [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25]. They have dealt with some
    of the issues listed above. 1.4. Organization of the paper This paper shows that
    the MAC protocol implementation in OSA networks is influenced by the network’s
    topology. The OSA networks can be classified according to the network topology
    (or network infrastructure). Hence in Section 2, the OSA networks are classified
    based on the network infrastructure. The MAC protocols discussed in this paper
    are introduced in Section 2 under the appropriate network topology. Section 3
    elaborates the MAC layer issues in the OSA network from an ad hoc (or distributed)
    network perspective. Section 4 provides a discussion on the merits and limitations
    of the MAC protocols for the OSA networks described in this paper. Section 4 also
    provides a qualitative comparison of these MAC protocols categorized according
    to their network topology. Section 5 provides the open research issues in the
    MAC layer for the OSA networks. Section 6 concludes this paper. 2. Classification
    of OSA networks In order to share and access the channels sensed to be idle, the
    secondary users of the OSA network must implement a medium access control (MAC)
    protocol. The MAC protocol coordinates the activities of the secondary users accessing
    the spectrum holes. The hierarchy for control and coordination in an OSA network
    depends on the type of network infrastructure. Hence the OSA networks are classified
    based on the type of infrastructure as centralized and distributed (Fig. 1). Download

    infrastructure. In a centralized OSA network the spectrum access is controlled
    by a base station (BS) [10] or a spectrum allocation server [11], whereas in a
    distributed OSA network the spectrum may be allocated by group leaders as in [21]
    or randomly [17]. 2.1. Centralized OSA networks The coverage area under a centralized
    OSA network (illustrated in Fig. 2) is usually divided into cells or meshes with
    each cell consisting of a base station (BS) and many secondary users. The base
    stations may either act like the controlling authority (responsible for spectrum
    access) or may simply transmit information like spectrum allocation within the
    cell to the secondary users. In the latter case the BS does not take part in data
    transmissions. In addition, the BS may be governed by another superior controlling
    entity in the hierarchy (e.g. a satellite [10] or spectrum server [11]). The secondary
    users may perform functions like spectrum sensing and report to the BS which in
    turn may report to its controlling entity. Prior to data transmission between
    the secondary users the permission to access a channel or group of channels has
    to be obtained from the superior controlling authority. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Architecture of a centralized OSA network. The centralized OSA networks
    can be broadly classified into two types depending on whether the BS takes part
    in data transmission among the secondary users as • Centralized spectrum access
    networks. • Centralized spectrum allocation networks. The centralized spectrum
    access network deals with both spectrum allocation and data transmission [10],
    [11]. In the centralized spectrum allocation networks the channels in the primary
    user’s spectrum are temporarily leased to the secondary users. The central entity
    is a spectrum server (sometimes referred as spectrum broker) which manages the
    database of the spectrum holes in the primary user spectrum and lease details
    of the spectrum used by the secondary users. The secondary users approach the
    spectrum servers by listening to the broadcasts from the base stations (BS) which
    are also managed by the spectrum server. There are several schemes for realizing
    the centralized spectrum allocation networks such as the DIMSUMNet [11] which
    also supports spectrum access in a limited number through the BS, the DSAP [12]
    which is similar to the DIMSUMNet [11] but works in the unlicensed band locally
    and the on-demand cognitive pilot channel (CPC) scheme [13]. Some of the centralized
    OSA networks existing in the literature such as [10], [11], [12], [13] are explained
    below to show the differences in their operation 2.1.1. IEEE 802.22 or WRAN The
    IEEE 802.22 Working Group has been conducting research to build point to multiple
    network spanning up to 100 km and offering data rate of about 18–24 Mbps. This
    architecture [10] is called as the IEEE 802.22 network or the wireless regional
    area network (WRAN). The topology of the WRAN is similar that shown in Fig. 2.
    Each cell is associated with a base station (BS) which performs spectrum allocation
    and data transmission among the secondary users referred as customer premise equipment
    (CPE). The WRAN allocates the idle channel-time slot pairs (spectrum holes) in
    the TV spectrum (UHF and VHF bands) to the secondary users. The BS schedules the
    sensing operation in the secondary users. Using a mechanism called distributed
    sensing the BS delegates groups of secondary users to scan separate bands in the
    TV spectrum. Using its spectrum sensing technique a CPE constructs a spectrum
    occupancy map for that frequency band. This information is conveyed to the BS.
    In order to transmit data on an idle channel the secondary users should listen
    to the MAC superframes on these channels. The BS broadcasts the MAC superframes
    on all the available channels. Each MAC superframe is divided into an upstream
    subframe and downstream subframe. The downstream subframe includes details of
    the contention intervals for the CPEs while the upstream subframe carries details
    like important measurements, bandwidth requests, registration messages, etc. The
    size of the subframes is alterable. The superframe header contains information
    like time synchronization and channel estimation. 2.1.2. DIMSUMNet architecture
    The dynamic intelligent management of spectrum for ubiquitous mobile-access network
    (DIMSUMNet) architecture [11] is a spectrum leasing scheme which temporarily leases
    the channels from a wide range of primary user spectra called the coordination
    access bands (CAB). The CAB may include idle channels from different primary user
    systems like cellular communication, PCS or TV spectrum. The architecture of DIMSUMNet
    [11] is composed of four components, namely the SPectrum Information and Management
    (SPIM) broker, the radio access network (RAN), the RAN manager (RANMAN), the IP
    aware base stations (BS) and the intelligent end user devices. The SPIM constructs
    a geographical map of the spectrum allocation termed as Spectrum Allocation Map
    (SAM) in the CAB. In order for a secondary user to obtain a spectrum lease from
    the SPIM, the request for the lease should be authenticated by the RANMAN. The
    RANMAN may also control power, load, pricing and lease stipulations of the secondary
    users or network operators. The lease requests are forwarded over special channels
    in the CAB called the SPectrum Information (SPI) channels. The DIMSUMNet [11]
    uses two MAC protocols during the negotiation phase namely, a SPEctum Leasing
    (SPEL) protocol which operates between the SPIM broker, RANMAN and the BS, and
    a SPectrum Information Channel (SPIC) protocol which operates between the BS and
    the end user devices. There are two modes for negotiating the lease in the DIMSUMNet
    [11] namely, CAB-M1 (hierarchical leasing of spectrum) and CAB-M2 (spectrum leased
    directly to end users). The BS functions as a mediator between the end users and
    the SPIM. The BS can also apply for spectrum lease (CAB-M1) and may in turn lease
    spectrum to end users. The BS can also support limited spectrum access. 2.1.3.
    Dynamic spectrum access protocol The dynamic spectrum access protocol (DSAP) scheme
    [12] is a centralized spectrum allocation scheme which is similar to the DIMSUMNet
    [11] in terms of the architecture and working. However, the DSAP allocates spectrum
    from the unlicensed spectrum (e.g. ISM band) instead of the licensed spectrum
    as in DIMSUMNet [11]. Hence it can be viewed as a scheme in which the unlicensed
    users belonging to different wireless technologies co-exist. One of the wireless
    technologies, for example, 802.11 may be regarded as the primary user. Apart from
    leasing the spectrum the central entity referred as the DSAP server controls issues
    such as throughput management and dynamic channel switching to avoid interference
    with other unlicensed networks operating in the ISM band (2.4 GHz). 2.1.4. On-demand
    CPC scheme The on-demand CPC scheme [13] divides the coverage area into meshes
    with each mesh consisting of a CPC transmitter and many secondary users. The CPC
    transmitter operates on a special channel called the cognitive pilot channel (CPC).
    The CPC is assumed to be universally available to any secondary user which tunes
    to it. One proposal for the CPC in [13] was to assume the CPC as an out-of-band
    frequency which is exclusively allotted or to dedicate a particular channel from
    within the radio access technologies (RAT) available in the mesh. The cognitive
    pilot channel (CPC) may carry information like mesh location information, operators,
    available radio access technologies (RAT) within the mesh and available channels.
    The basic idea of the CPC scheme [13] was to provide spectrum allocation details
    on the CPC based on the demand (or requests) from the secondary users. According
    to Romero et al. [13], in this way two savings could be made against a continuous
    broadcast scheme namely • Reducing the access delay for the secondary users. •
    Reducing the operating costs of the CPC transmitter. The spectrum allocation is
    done using three logical control channels on the CPC namely, the random access
    CPC (RACPC), the acquisition indicator CPC (AICPC) and the downlink on-demand
    CPC (DODCPC). The secondary users contend for a data channel on the RACPC (uplink
    channel). The CPC transmitter acknowledges the end users who successfully contended
    for a data channel over the AICPC (downlink channel). The mesh information is
    available in the DODCPC (another downlink channel). 2.2. Distributed OSA networks
    In a legacy ad hoc (or distributed) network a node can initiate data transmission
    by simply observing the channel for idle condition and implementing a MAC protocol
    using the control channel. For example, if the carrier sense multiple access (CSMA)
    is used the control packets (or handshake messages) are exchanged over the control
    channel between the sender (which sends RTS) and the receiver (which responds
    with CTS) during the data transmission. Other nodes listening to the control channel
    defer their transmission during this time interval thereby eliminating the hidden
    node problem (Fig. 3). In case multiple data channels are present the users negotiate
    the required data channels over the control channel before use (e.g. multi-channel
    MAC [26]). However in the distributed CRN it is difficult to find a common control
    channel for all the secondary users. Hence it is a challenge to achieve network
    coordination using legacy MAC protocols. Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    3. Hidden and exposed node problem: (a) A is the hidden node; (b) C is the exposed
    node. If the secondary users are using a single transceiver it can lead to multi-channel
    hidden terminal problem since the secondary user can observe only one channel
    at a time. There are several ways to assume the existence of a common control
    channel in the distributed OSA network thereby enabling spectrum access. The control
    channel based schemes help classify the topology of distributed CRN as follows:
    • Distributed OSA network with global control channel. • Distributed OSA network
    with local control channels. • Distributed OSA network with configurable control
    channel. • Distributed OSA network without a dedicated control channel. 2.2.1.
    Distributed OSA network with global control channel Though it is difficult to
    establish a global control channel in a heterogeneous spectral environment, in
    some distributed OSA networks [14], [15] such a control channel is assumed to
    exist. The reason behind such an assumption is to simplify the implementation
    of the OSA network. In both [14], [15], the authors have assumed the global control
    channel to be allocated in an unlicensed band (e.g. ISM band) while the data channels
    are allocated in a primary user spectrum. One of the limitations of such an approach
    is that it can lead to control channel saturation problem [27] which could limit
    the achievable user density and throughput if a fairly large number of spectrum
    holes are available or rapidly occurring. An attack (e.g. jamming) on the global
    control channel can lead to a breakdown of the network. Several MAC layer schemes
    use this network topology like [14], [15], [22], [23]. While [22], [23] are explained
    in Section 3.1, the MAC schemes [14], [15] are explained below. 2.2.1.1. ILP based
    MAC protocol In [14], the MAC layer schedule was formulated as an integer linear
    program (ILP) to solve the issue of spectrum allocation. The MAC layer schedule
    assigns a unique channel and time slot pair to every outgoing link of the nodes
    in the network such that two nodes do not transmit on the same channel at the
    same time. The number of nodes is fixed and each node is given a unique identity.
    The nodes have GPS facility for time synchronization. The nodes are ranked based
    on the out degree and the cardinality of the available channel set. The nodes
    are assumed to be aware of a global control channel which is established in an
    unlicensed spectrum (IEEE 802.11a). Every node is assumed to be aware of its two
    hop neighbor. The ILP in [14] was developed as a distributed heuristic for simplicity.
    The distributed heuristic based assignment is implemented in two stages. In the
    first stage a unique channel and time slot is assigned to the outgoing links of
    every node in the network. In the second stage nodes propagate their schedule
    length throughout the network in a breadth-first-search (BFS) fashion using the
    global control channel. Any node with the lowest rank in a two hop neighborhood
    can initiate the second stage of the distributed heuristic. The nodes adjust their
    schedule when they receive a higher schedule length. In the end the resultant
    channel and time slot assignment for all the nodes in the network will be based
    on the node with the highest rank in the network. 2.2.1.2. Global control channel
    scheme with busy tones The dynamic open spectrum sharing (DOSS) scheme [15] requires
    three transceivers, one each for monitoring the common control channel, data channels
    and the busy tone channels. The DOSS protocol utilizes the concept of using busy
    tones to tackle the hidden and exposed node problems in the CR network design.
    The DOSS exclusively allocates a narrow band for the busy tones. The DOSS scheme
    gives a spectrum mapping function to associate the data channels with their corresponding
    busy tones. When a data channel is selected by a node its corresponding busy tone
    is turned ON to alert the neighboring nodes of that data channel. The spectrum
    access in the DOSS [15] protocol is composed of a channel negotiation phase and
    a data transmission phase. During the negotiation phase the source node sends
    a REQ packet to the destination node over the control channel to convey information
    like available channel list at the source and the channel parameters. The destination
    node compares the REQ information to its own available channel list and selects
    a common channel with a larger bandwidth. The destination node replies with a
    REQ_ACK packet on the control channel to indicate the selected data channel. Simultaneously
    the destination node turns on the corresponding busy tone according to the spectrum
    mapping function. The source has to rely on the REQ_ACK packet since there is
    a likelihood that the same busy tone is turned on by a different pair of nodes.
    After successful negotiation the source node starts data transmission on the selected
    data channel. A DATA_ACK packet from the receiver within a WF_DATA_ACK time interval
    (greater than the maximum retry limit, RTT) indicates successful transmission
    of the data packet by the source. Otherwise the source node retransmits the data
    packet. The busy tone is reset by the receiver after transmitting the DATA_ACK
    packet on the data channel. For multicast and broadcast operations the busy tones
    are not used. In this case a node sends a notification message (REQ) containing
    the list of receivers on the control channel before transmitting the data. 2.2.2.
    Distributed OSA network with local control channels Though the secondary users
    (or nodes) lying in a geographical region may experience different spectrum allocation
    it is possible that the nodes within a neighborhood (one or two hop) may have
    a few common channel allocations. By using such common channels (or local channels)
    network connectivity can be established (see Fig. 4). The nodes with local channels
    belonging to two different neighboring groups can act as coordination (or bridge)
    nodes for any communication between the nodes of the two groups. This is the idea
    behind the two topologies, HD-MAC [16] which uses a minimum distance criterion
    to group two secondary users sharing the same local channels and CogMesh [17]
    which uses a clustering mechanism to create groups around a particular local channel
    where the node which initiated the cluster formation becomes the leader of its
    cluster. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Spectrum allocation in a
    distributed CRN. 2.2.2.1. Heterogeneous distributed MAC The heterogeneous distributed
    MAC (HD-MAC) scheme [16] follows a grouping mechanism which begins by the secondary
    users broadcasting their channel set information over all the available channels
    to update their neighbors. The most common channel in the group is chosen as the
    coordination (or control) channel by a process of voting. The HD-MAC is a modified
    version of the multi-channel MAC (MMAC) [26] to address spectrum heterogeneity.
    The MMAC [26], a legacy MAC protocol was developed for the multi-channel access
    using a single radio transceiver. The control channel was divided into superframes.
    The MMAC superframe is composed of a beacon period (BEACON), coordination window
    (CHWIN) and a data transmission period. Nodes would periodically listen to the
    control channel during the beacon broadcast. Every user broadcasts two types of
    beacons during the BEACON, a global beacon broadcast issued over all available
    channels and a group beacon broadcast issued on the corresponding coordination
    channel. While global beacons allow new users to add on to the network in the
    absence of a coordination channel to the new user, the group beacons help neighbor
    discovery. During the CHWIN nodes intending to communicate send coordination messages
    to acquire a data channel. Upon successful negotiation the nodes switch to their
    respective data channels and start data transmission. The HD-MAC [16] divides
    the CHWIN structure of the MMAC to help the bridge nodes to transmit the coordination
    messages received over all their coordination channels. In addition the HD-MAC
    [16] recommends every node to maintain a separate FIFO (First in First Out) queue
    for each neighbor node in order to avoid head of line blocking. 2.2.2.2. Cluster
    based MAC scheme In the CogMesh [17], the spectrum access is controlled by the
    leader of the group (or cluster) called the clusterhead. The coordination channel
    of the cluster is called as the master channel. The master channel is logically
    divided into MAC superframes as shown in Fig. 5. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 5. CogMesh MAC superframe. The hybrid MAC superframe uses a random
    access period (RAP) for control message exchange and a guaranteed access period
    for data transmission. The guaranteed access period is divided into a beacon period
    (BP), neighborhood broadcasting period (NBP) which is further divided into mini-slots
    and data period (DP). During the BP a beacon is issued by the clusterhead to begin
    the MAC superframe, it contains time synchronization, channel availability and
    mini-slot allocation of the members. The members broadcast their one hop neighbor
    list (each neighbor’s identity and its corresponding channel list) in their mini-slot
    in the NBP. During the DP the members use TDMA to transmit their data over the
    data channels. Each group uses its own private spreading code for the data channels.
    The intra-cluster and inter-cluster communications are carried out during the
    private RAP and a public RAP, respectively. For inter-cluster communication, the
    clusterhead selects gateway nodes which can listen to adjacent clusters. The gateway
    nodes of two clusters can be either overlapping (shared gateway) or non-overlapping
    (non-shared gateway). The shared gateway node contacts the clusterhead during
    the private RAP, whereas the non-shared gateways contact during the public RAP.
    An external node may contact the clusterhead during the public RAP. Nodes use
    slotted ALOHA in the RAP. The MAC superframe also includes a quiet period (QP)
    during which the nodes perform cooperative sensing. The size of the cluster is
    limited to a pre-defined value for efficient operation. The MAC protocol in CogMesh
    [17] also addresses issues like cluster formation, cluster merging and cluster
    termination. 2.2.3. Distributed OSA network with configurable control channel
    This scheme is similar to the distributed OSA network with local control channels
    except that in the former scheme the local control channels are assumed to exist
    based on the location of the nodes, whereas in this scheme the nodes implement
    a temporary control channel configuration procedure. Any channel can be configured
    as a control channel. Unlike the distributed OSA network with local control channels,
    there are no group leaders or coordination nodes to control the spectrum access.
    MAC layer schemes such as the DUB-MAC [18] and C-MAC [19] belong to this scheme.
    2.2.3.1. Dual channel communication scheme The dual unlicensed band MAC (DUB-MAC)
    [18] uses two channels for its operation. The channels are referred as signaling
    and control band (SCB) and data transmission band (DTB). The SCB (located in the
    GSM band) is used as a control channel while the DTB may be located in any primary
    user spectrum and used as data channels. A node in DUB-MAC scheme [18] begins
    with the SCB discovery procedure by scanning a GSM base station’s downlink and
    finding out details like the frequency assignment within a cell, starting period
    of the GSM frame and scanning for empty slots in each frame. Once the empty slots
    are detected the MAC superframe is implemented. The DUB-MAC implements the MAC
    superframe similar to the distributed coordination function (DCF) in the 802.11
    networks with some modifications to allow dynamic spectrum access. Unlike the
    802.11 DCF scheme, the DUB-MAC transmits the control packets and data packets
    on separate channels. Following the SCB discovery process the node may run a discovery
    procedure to find a CRN or may start the DTB scanning in any primary user spectrum.
    The control channel (SCB) is dynamic in nature. The SCB availability is affected
    by the short duration of the GSM slot (TGSM = 577 μs) and the scanning time needed
    to locate a new SCB. The SCB scanning takes place at the beginning of every GSM
    slot for a short duration τg called guard time. Hence the commencement of data
    transmission may be interrupted either due to the GSM slot duration TGSM or due
    to the SCB discovery time. In order to handle such situations due to the SCB the
    back-off counter and network allocation vector (NAV) were modified in the DUB-MAC
    [18]. A dynamic packet sizing technique to effectively utilize any residual time
    in the GSM slot was also proposed in the DUB-MAC [18]. 2.2.3.2. Cognitive MAC
    (C-MAC) scheme The cognitive MAC (C-MAC) protocol proposed in [19] uses a single
    radio transceiver to access multiple channels. In the C-MAC protocol all the available
    channels have the superframe structure with one of the channels configured as
    the rendezvous channel (RC) which acts as the control channel. The RC manages
    operations such as network wide group coordination, inter-channel synchronization,
    neighborhood discovery and load balancing. The nodes periodically switch to the
    RC and broadcast their operating channel information. Thus, the location of every
    node in the network is updated on the RC. The nodes can use the other available
    channels for data communication after broadcasting the channel details on the
    RC. Nodes can multicast or broadcast using the RC by repeatedly sending beacons
    containing the identities of the nodes or groups over several superframes. Every
    superframe consists of a beacon period (BP) and a data transfer period (DTP).
    The beacon periods of the channels are kept non-overlapping using an inter-channel
    synchronization procedure. The beacon period of the superframe is divided into
    slots for the nodes operating on the channel to broadcast their beacon frames
    during their respective slot. The first two beacon slots are intended for new
    devices joining the network. Synchronization among the nodes on a given channel
    is achieved through the knowledge of the beacon period start time (BPST) of the
    superframe of that channel. In order to know the BPST the nodes have to listen
    for at least one superframe duration. During the beacon period the devices operating
    on the channel broadcast their beacon frames which consist of the information
    about the previous beacon frames. Thus, every node has an update of the neighbor’s
    neighbors’ details like communication schedules and beacon slots. Such an update
    helps the nodes to overcome the hidden and exposed node problems. The C-MAC [19]
    defines two groups namely, a beacon group which consists of nodes which are able
    to listen to each other’s beacons and sharing the same BPST, and a extended beacon
    group which consists of a node’s beacon group and the beacon groups of the other
    nodes in the same beacon group. The C-MAC superframe on a given channel contains
    a quiet period during which the nodes perform load measurements and incumbent
    detection. The channel load measurements are broadcast on the RC this helps a
    node to select a data channel with better quality. 2.2.4. Distributed OSA network
    without a dedicated control channel A distributed OSA network can be designed
    without a dedicated control channel. In such a case the nodes will simply switch
    to a data channel used by the receiver and start transmitting their control packets
    and data packets on the same channel. Once the data transmission is complete the
    node may continue to stay on the same channel or move to another available channel.
    However, the other nodes may or may not listen to the ongoing transmissions and
    this might increase packet collisions due to lack of network coordination. There
    are several MAC protocols such as DC-MAC [20], [21] which are based on this topology.
    2.2.4.1. POMDP based MAC scheme In the decentralized cognitive MAC (DC-MAC) scheme
    [20] a node using a half duplex transceiver is able to observe one channel at
    a time which means only partial system information is available to a node. A channel
    can exhibit two states based on the presence of a primary user, namely busy state
    (‘1’) and idle state (‘0’). Based on the channel status observations a node models
    the channel opportunity as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP).
    In a system of N identical channels, the occupancy of each channel by the primary
    user can be represented as Markov model consisting of M = 2N states (see Fig.
    6 for N = 2). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Markov model for N =
    2. The DC-MAC assumes that under steady state conditions, the Markovian channel
    model readily provides every node with a channel opportunity. The transition probabilities
    αj and βj, {j = 1, 2, …, N} are assumed to be known. The POMDP operation at a
    given instant of time depends on the consequent action to be taken based on the
    past decisions and present observation. The chosen action aims to maximize a channel
    selection metric which is a measure of the future spectrum opportunity. A suboptimal
    strategy which depends on only N states instead of M states was also proposed
    in [20] to reduce the computational complexity. For data transmission the receiver
    periodically checks its set of available channels for a control message from any
    other node (sender). If it detects a control message the sender and receiver implement
    the DC-MAC protocol and start data transmission on the resulting data channels.
    2.2.4.2. Cross-channel communication scheme The single radio adaptive channel
    (SRAC) algorithm was proposed in [21] for multihop wireless networks using a single
    transceiver. Spectrum access is often described as a process where the transmitter
    has to sense the channel for interference free condition before transmitting the
    data. This is an inappropriate pre-condition to be satisfied since in a heterogeneous
    environment a channel may appear to be interference free at the receiver while
    being busy at the transmitter. Thus, a node or a secondary user can continue to
    send data on a busy channel as long as it does not obstruct the primary user operation.
    The SRAC algorithm [21] terms such a spectrum access technique as cross-channel
    communication. It is assumed that every node is capable of detecting and differentiating
    a primary user from a jamming source. Using the idea of cross-channel communication
    a node can transmit on any channel but it can receive only on an unused channel.
    Thus, a node chooses an unused channel having the smallest channel load for data
    reception. Such a channel is called the receive channel. Every node knows the
    receive channel used by its neighbors which it stores in a receive channel list.
    When a node’s (node A) current receive channel is blocked under the impact of
    a jammer or licensed user then node A chooses a new receive channel according
    to the channel load and updates its one hop neighbors. The SRAC algorithm uses
    the ARQ [28] mechanism to deliver the notification message which contains information
    about the new receive channel. The notification message is delivered in two different
    ways depending on whether the receive channel of the neighbor node is same as
    that of node A or not. If the receive channel of the neighbor (node B) and node
    A are same then the notification message is delivered using CSMA. If the receive
    channel of the neighbor (node C) and node A are different then the notification
    message is delivered on node C’s receive channel after a random waiting time.
    This process is repeated till all the one hop neighbors reply with an ACK message
    or till the maximum retry time is reached. Fig. 7 shows the notification procedure

    and acknowledgement procedure during channel switching. For data transmission,
    a source node selects the receive channel of the destination node and sends a
    RTS packet. This is followed by sending RTS packet on all the receive channels
    in the source node’s receive channel list. The destination node in turn sends
    a CTS packet on the receive channel of the source node and follows it up by sending
    the CTS packet on all the receive channels in the destination node’s receive channel
    list. This way the hidden and exposed node problems are solved. 3. MAC layer issues
    in distributed OSA network The MAC protocol in an opportunistic spectrum access
    (OSA) network has to address issues like spectrum sensing policies, spectrum allocation,
    spectrum sharing and spectrum access, transmit power control and interference
    mitigation, besides the MAC layer issues found in legacy wireless networks such
    as hidden and exposed node problem, broadcast and multicast, multiple channel
    scenario, mobility and QoS support. 3.1. Spectrum sensing policies Most MAC protocols
    are implemented assuming a reliable sensing mechanism. There are several spectrum
    sensing techniques available in literature (though not applicable for all primary
    users systems) such as the multi-taper spectral estimation combined with singular
    value decomposition (MTM-SVD) [24], wideband spectrum sensing [6], multi-resolution
    spectrum sensing (MRSS) [7], wideband spectrum sensing using wavelets [8] and
    sensor based primary user detection [9]. A detailed discussion on the sensing
    techniques is beyond the scope of this paper. The reliability of spectrum sensing
    can be improved if the secondary users share their sensing results with neighboring
    users (or nodes). This operation is called cooperative spectrum sensing. However,
    spectrum sensing consumes significant time [3] and may result in large sensing
    overheads. One way to improve the spectrum sensing efficiency and spectrum utilization
    is by incorporating spectrum sensing policies using distributed algorithms (e.g.
    WRAN [10]). Using distributed algorithms the spectrum can be divided and different
    groups of nodes can be deployed to sense different bands. The nodes may share
    their sensing results both within the group and with other groups. Such an approach
    may increase the reliability of the sensing mechanism and alleviate the tradeoff
    between the available bandwidth and overall sensing time. However, if the number
    of channels to be sensed increases then the control message overhead also increases.
    The MAC protocols in [22], [23] propose different spectrum sensing policies and
    mechanisms to achieve the desired QoS. 3.1.1. Hardware constrained sensing policy
    The sensing policy described in [22] gives an optimal stopping criterion for sensing
    operation based on the hardware constraints for the data transmission, namely,
    the bandwidth and number of spectrum fragments (or sub-carriers in OFDM) that
    can be supported by the cognitive radio (node). The sender and receiver exchange
    control messages which contains the details of the sensing result on the common
    control channel. Independently, the sender and the receiver calculate an expected
    reward if more channels need to be sensed bound by their hardware constraints.
    The sensing operation is carried on till the expected reward is maximized (i.e.
    hardware requirements have reached). The hardware constrained MAC (HC-MAC) protocol
    [22] consists of three phases namely contention, sensing and data transmission.
    During the contention phase the nodes try to acquire the right for data transmission.
    During the sensing phase the winning pair of nodes sense and decide on the number
    of channels needed for data transmission while other nodes defer their transmission
    using random back-off timers. During the data transmission phase the sender tunes
    its only transceiver to access the available channels simultaneously. OFDM was
    used to aggregate the data channels. In all the three phases of the HC-MAC [22],
    the nodes exchange control messages (RTS/CTS) on the common control channel. Hence
    when the CTS corresponding to the data transmission phase is transmitted on the
    control channel another round of contention commences. To reduce the computational
    complexity a k-stage look ahead stopping rule was proposed in [22]. According
    to the k-stage look ahead stopping rule, after sensing n number of channels the
    expected reward for sensing n + k channels is calculated. The k-stage sensing
    is stopped if the expected reward satisfies the hardware limitations of the cognitive
    radios (nodes). 3.1.2. QoS based sensing policy In the multi-channel MAC protocol
    [23], two spectrum sensing policies, viz. random sensing policy (RSP) and negotiation-based
    sensing policy (NSP) were described to identify the maximum number of available
    channels. If the RSP is used, each node randomly senses a licensed channel and
    reports it irrespective of what other nodes reported. The efficiency of the RSP
    improves when the number of nodes is more than the number of channels. In case
    of the NSP, the nodes listen to the control messages (RTS/CTS) which contain information
    about the channels in use and randomly sense among the remaining licensed channels.
    The efficiency of the NSP is better compared to the RSP. Every node is composed
    of two transceivers, a control transceiver tuned to a common control channel (accessed
    using p-persistent CSMA) while another transceiver (SDR) can select any unused
    licensed channel. All the channels are assumed to be slotted hence time synchronization
    is addressed. The MAC protocol [23] is divided into a reporting phase and a negotiating
    phase. The reporting phase is further divided into mini-slots according to the
    number of licensed channel. During the reporting phase the nodes sense the status
    of licensed channels and send the results as beacons on the control channel. During
    the negotiation phase the nodes contend for the available channels. The winner
    of the negotiation phase uses all the available channels in the next time slot
    for data transmission. 3.2. Spectrum allocation Spectrum allocation is an important
    function of the MAC protocol in the OSA networks. Since the spectrum allocation
    at the nodes could be different the nodes have to share their channel list (spectrum
    allocation details) with one another (say, one hop neighbors) and then switch
    to the common channel (or channels) to communicate. In the distributed OSA network
    with a global control channel [14], [15] all the control messages are exchanged
    on the common control channel. In the ILP based MAC scheduling scheme [14], the
    spectrum allocation is done in such that every node can use every available channel
    at non-overlapping time instants. In the DOSS scheme [15], the spectrum allocation
    information is shared only when the nodes want to access the channels. In [22],
    [23], the spectrum allocation is supported through cooperative sensing and spectrum
    sensing policies. In the distributed OSA network with local control channels [16],
    [17], the spectrum is allocation is location based and nodes willing to share
    a channel form a group. In HD-MAC [16], the nodes vote for a coordination channel
    within their neighborhood and hence form groups. In CogMesh [17] if a node detects
    a channel it checks for the group leader (clusterhead) or becomes the leader if
    there is none. Any other channel detected by the members of a group (cluster)
    can only be accessed through permission from its leader. In the DUB-MAC [18],
    spectrum allocation in both the configured control channel (SCB) and the data
    channel (DTB) is shared on the SCB. Nodes sharing the same SCB may share their
    DTB allocation in [18]. In the C-MAC protocol [19], the nodes broadcast their
    spectrum allocations regularly on the rendezvous channel (RC) as well as on the
    data channel used for transmission. The spectrum allocation in the distributed
    OSA network without a dedicated control channel [20], [21] is difficult due to
    lack of network coordination. In DC-MAC [20], the spectrum allocation at a node
    is determined at every instant using the POMDP but this information is not shared
    with other nodes. The nodes are assumed to initially know the channel list of
    the neighbors in the SRAC [21]. A node in the SRAC scheme [21] updates its neighbors
    of the receive channel only if it changes its receive channel. The nodes are assumed
    to know the spectrum allocation in the MAC schemes [24], [25]. 3.3. Spectrum access
    Nodes in an OSA network can access the spectrum either using a random access or
    a guaranteed access strategy depending on coordination among the nodes. If the
    spectrum allocation at the neighboring node is known then the node can send its
    data to the intended receiver by simply selecting a channel available at the receiver
    (e.g. SRAC [21]) or by negotiating a data channel (or channels in a multi-channel
    communication) with the receiver before the transmission (e.g. DOSS [15]). In
    a distributed OSA network with single transceiver nodes, the MAC protocol has
    to address the multi-channel hidden terminal problem during spectrum access. In
    the multi-channel MAC protocol [23] and the HC-MAC protocol [22] explained in
    Section 3.1, the spectrum access is done by combining the random access (for negotiation
    phase) and guaranteed access (for data transmission). As one pair of nodes access
    multiple data channels in a slot the MAC protocols [22], [23] achieve higher throughput
    while eliminating the multi-channel hidden terminal problem. The ILP based MAC
    protocol described in [14] follows a guaranteed spectrum access strategy by defining
    a time slot for every channel allocated to a node. Due to the ILP hidden and exposed
    node problems are eliminated. In the DOSS scheme [15], the spectrum is accessed
    using random access. When a channel is selected for access its busy tone channel
    is turned on. The spectrum access strategy in the local control channels scheme
    (HD-MAC [16], [17]) is a combination of random access and guaranteed access. In
    the configurable control channel scheme, the DUB-MAC [18] follows random access
    while the C-MAC [23] uses a combination of random access and guaranteed access.
    The spectrum access in the distributed OSA networks without a dedicated control
    channel namely, DC-MAC [20] and SRAC [21] is based on the random access strategy.
    The DC-MAC protocol [20] also suggests receiver initiated busy tone concept for
    spectrum access. The SRAC algorithm [21] uses the idea of cross-channel communication
    for accessing the spectrum. 3.4. Power control and interference mitigation The
    mechanisms for interference control within the secondary user system are rarely
    addressed. Most networks using CSMA technique assume that a channel is busy even
    if there is partial interference. Such an assumption unnecessarily limits the
    network utilization. Power control is an important feature especially in multi-channel
    ad hoc network scenario where multiple nodes use multiple channels. While centralized
    networks like [10], [12] include power control mechanisms in order to increase
    the network utilization for a given user density and spectrum allocation, and
    mitigate interference, the ad hoc networks rarely emphasize on the need for power
    control. Some of the distributed MAC schemes which address this issue are explained
    below 3.4.1. Power control using game theory Haykin [24] proposed a decentralized
    transmit power control technique for secondary users based on the game theory.
    In a multi-user ad hoc environment the interference mitigation can be implemented
    using cooperative mechanisms. For instance, a node accesses a channel subject
    to negotiation and agreement of the schedule time with its neighboring nodes.
    However, Haykin [24] visualizes a cognitive radio (CR) environment where a secondary
    user (cognitive radio) takes decisions consequent to its own observations rather
    than relying on cooperation with other secondary users. Thus, the phenomenon of
    competition arises which is contrary to the idea of cooperation. However, the
    transmit power of the secondary users is constrained by the interference temperature
    [2] and the number of spectrum holes. Thus, the transmit power control was treated
    from a game theoretic perspective. In game theory a user chooses the subsequent
    action in response to the actions of other users. In a cooperative game, the players
    choose their actions such that a single cost function (or objective) is optimized.
    In other words an equilibrium condition is reached where the actions of each user
    becomes deterministic. Such equilibrium is called Nash equilibrium. But a CR environment
    is a non-cooperative environment in which a player (or user) may choose actions
    unfairly. For example, a CR node may try to fully utilize a spectrum opportunity
    by using high data rates which might increase interference to other CR nodes.
    Hence the Nash equilibrium may not be obtained. Haykin [24] suggested a No regrets
    strategy wherein a user chooses a sufficient action but is not affected by the
    actions of clever users or opponents. But there is no guarantee that a non-deterministic
    strategy like the No regrets strategy can reach an equilibrium condition. Hence
    in [24] the No regrets game is treated as a constrained optimization problem in
    which the action space is assumed to lie in a convex state space and the regret
    (or total reward), calculated based on the actions chosen by the users is strictly
    bounded. Under such assumptions any convex optimization method may be applied
    to find an optimal solution to the No regrets problem. 3.4.2. Power control using
    information theory Haykin [24] also proposed a distributed transmit power control
    mechanism to mitigate interference. The scheme is based on the iterative water-filling
    (WF) method popular in information theory [29]. The strategy adopted is to maximize
    the power of the users independently till the desired data rates are achieved
    subject to the interference constraint. This independent power maximization using
    WF method is similar to the Nash equilibrium. A SNR gap Γ is defined in [24] which
    is a measure of the theoretic channel capacity expressed in terms of the achievable
    data rate. The transmit power control for the multi user scenario is derived from
    the two user system. In a two user system, shown in Fig. 8, let R1 and R2 represent
    the data rates of the transmitters 1 and 2, respectively. Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 8. Small signal model for two user system. The data rates
    may be expressed as (1) (2) where S1(f) and S2(f) represent the power spectral
    densities of the transmitters 1 and 2, respectively, N1(f) and N2(f) are noise
    spectral densities and α1 and α2 are the cross-coupling coefficients given by
    (3) (4) The transmit power control strategy for transmitter 1 can be stated as
    maximizing the data rate R1 while keeping the power of transmitter 2 fixed subject
    to the interference temperature (kTmax). This may be expressed as (5) Similarly,
    the transmit power control strategy may be applied for transmitter 2. For multi
    user scenario, a Nash equilibrium in the transmit power of users Ui; i = 1, 2,
    …, N is readily achieved by sequentially maximizing the transmit power of every
    user subject to the interference temperature and the actions of the other users.
    After every iteration the data rate of every user is checked against its desired
    data rate and the process is repeated. 3.4.3. Interference aware transmission
    An interference aware transmission scheme for multihop ad hoc networks which do
    not rely on routing protocols was proposed in [25]. The MAC protocol uses the
    distributed automatic repeat request (ARQ) mechanism for data transmission. The
    data is encoded using space time block codes (STBC) and simultaneously transmitted
    by the source and relay nodes in the path between the source and destination nodes.
    It was shown in [30] that space diversity is achieved through the use of STBC
    encoding in all the nodes. The diversity gain improves network performance since
    the STBC encoding compensates for the effects of fading and shadowing. The source
    node broadcasts a DATA packet to the neighboring nodes or relay nodes which in
    turn relay encoded DATA packet towards the destination. When the packet reaches
    the destination, the destination node performs STBC decoding to recover the original
    DATA packet and replies with an ACK packet. If the source node does not receive
    an ACK packet within a pre-defined time limit then it transmits a control packet
    to synchronize the transmission with the relay nodes. Then the DATA packet is
    retransmitted simultaneously by source and the relay nodes. For R retransmissions
    by the source node there are R–n retransmissions by the relay nodes, where n is
    the number of control packets received by the relay nodes. The destination node
    replies with R + 1 ACK packets upon successful reception. By sensing the channel
    before transmission the interference region can be avoided and transmission can
    still be carried out using other paths in the network. 3.5. Mobility An important
    issue that needs attention in the development of a MAC protocol in a distributed
    OSA network is mobility. Mobility in nodes may pose serious challenges to the
    network coordination in a heterogeneous spectrum environment. Most distributed
    OSA networks rely on time synchronization for better network coordination. Some
    distributed CRN like [14], [24], [25] assumed a global positioning system (GPS)
    to be embedded in the CR device (node) to provide time synchronization. Mobility
    of the nodes causes drift in the reference clock of the network or group of nodes,
    which may cause time synchronization problems and subsequently requires reconfiguration
    of the nodes. Every reconfiguration operation results in communication overheads.
    Consider the C-MAC protocol [19], when a node switches to the any other channel
    after several MAC superframes it will be oblivious of the transmissions on that
    channel. In order to start its own transmission without packet collisions on that
    channel the node must know the superframe starting period. Hence in the C-MAC
    protocol [19], the nodes reportedly visit the rendezvous channel (RC) for time
    synchronization and to update the status of the channel they are occupying. Mobility
    of the nodes in an ad hoc network adds a new dimension to the hidden and exposed
    node problems which are difficult to handle. 4. Discussion In this section, the
    merits and limitations of all the MAC protocols described in this paper are presented.
    For convenience, the discussion is presented according to the network topology
    of the OSA network. Section 4.1 provides a discussion for the centralized OSA
    network, whereas Section 4.2 provides a discussion for the distributed OSA network.

    networks The base station controls the sharing and management of the resources
    in the centralized OSA networks [10], [11], [12], [13]. Although a centralized
    OSA network incurs cost in terms of implementation, maintenance, accumulation
    of data and database management they offer feasibility in terms of resource allocation
    and fairness to users contending for spectrum opportunities. A wireless network
    based on centralized spectrum access is immune to the problems of hidden and exposed
    node problems. The base station can perform broadcasts and multicasts by using
    beacons on the available data channels. 4.1.1. Centralized spectrum access networks
    The WRAN [10] addressed a wide range of MAC layer issues like distributed sensing,
    network initialization, throughput management, spectrum access and transmit power
    control. However, the issue of co-existence of WRAN [10] with other OSA networks
    requires more attention because such a wide area network could easily interfere
    with other OSA networks. It is also necessary to address the type of services
    that can be provided since the TV spectrum is not available for most part of the
    day. The FCC report [3] shows the difficulty involved in developing a reliable
    sensing mechanism in the TV spectrum. 4.1.2. Centralized spectrum allocation networks
    In the DIMSUMNet [11] authors claim that the CAB could be allotted by the FCC
    and could also serve as a source of revenue. But there are critical issues that
    need to be addressed • The DIMSUMNet clients sense and report the spectrum availability
    to the SPIM broker, but how is the measurement from a client assessed? • When
    the DIMSUMNet clients can sense the spectrum availability on their own why should
    they purchase spectrum leases from the CAB? • Buddhikot et al. [11] do not provide
    any simulations and results to support the proposed architecture. The dynamic
    spectrum access protocol (DSAP) [12] was proposed mainly to address the spectrum
    utilization in the unlicensed band using a centralized spectrum leasing or brokering
    mechanism. However, Brik et al. [12] claim that the DSAP can be extended to any
    spectral band. In such a scenario the DSAP clients must incorporate spectrum sensing
    operation (not discussed in [12]). In the DSAP system a dedicated channel is assigned
    to the source and destination nodes, but it is not clear how the DSAP server establishes
    a communication path between a source and destination node separated by more than
    one hop distance. The on-demand CPC scheme [13] tries to eliminate the spectrum
    sensing operation in CRN by making available all spectrum information on the pilot
    channel. However, it is not explained how the CPC scheme acquires the spectrum
    information. The simulations in [13] show that the on-demand CPC outperforms the
    broadcast CPC with an increase in the number of meshes in a geographical region.
    However, the on-demand CPC performance gets affected with an increase in the user
    density and number of requests from the users. The on-demand CPC does not address
    issues like transmit power control and interference since it does not have control
    over the user capacity in a mesh. 4.2. Distributed OSA networks The major bottle
    neck in the design of a distributed OSA network is insufficient coordination among
    the nodes of the network. The complexity of the implementation of a MAC protocol
    in the distributed OSA network increases with the limitations placed over the
    availability of the control channel to the nodes in the network. This complexity
    can be measured in terms of the message overheads (control packets and reconfiguration
    packets) and processing time (time for synchronization and reconfiguration). 4.2.1.
    Distributed OSA network with global control channel The distributed OSA network
    with global control channel is easier to implement compared to a distributed OSA
    network without a dedicated control channel. Since having a global control channel
    in a licensed spectrum is not desirable due to the cost involved in purchasing
    and the maintenance of the channel these distributed MAC protocols [14], [15]
    have assumed a global control channel in an unlicensed band. The limitation of
    such an assumption was explained in Section 2.2.1. The ILP based scheduling approach
    proposed in [14] has many drawbacks. Firstly, the spectrum allocation procedure
    in [14] consumes more time as the size of the network increases since the MAC
    schedule has to be propagated throughout the network. Secondly, it also results
    in a large amount of control message overhead which increases with an increase
    in network size and number of channels. Further there is a pre-condition that
    a node should have the knowledge of all the N nodes. The DOSS scheme [15] used
    the idea of receiver initiated busy tones to mitigate the hidden and exposed nodes
    in CRN. An exclusive busy tone band has to be allocated for this purpose. However,
    complications can arise when the busy tones come under the influence of the primary
    users. For instance, a data channel might be available but its corresponding busy
    tone might be unavailable and vice versa. Hence the idea of busy tones is not
    suitable for heterogeneous networks. The device cost and complexity is increased
    owing to the use of three transceivers (one each for the control channel, data
    channel and busy tone). The HC-MAC protocol [22] proposed a k-stage look ahead
    stopping criterion for spectrum sensing. In the HC-MAC, the throughput is maximized
    since the nodes sense as many channels that can be supported by their hardware.
    However, the remaining unused channels are not utilized by the neighboring nodes
    and this leads to inefficient spectrum utilization. Further it was stated that
    the sensing results of the nodes are impacted by neighboring nodes which are two
    hops away. This leads to more exposed node problems than in an IEEE 802.11 network.
    The HC-MAC involves moderate control message overheads in all the three phases
    of the MAC protocol (described in Section 3.1.1) and these overheads increase
    with number of channels sensed. The multi-channel MAC protocol in [23] proposed
    two types of sensing policies namely the random sensing policy (RSP) and the negotiation-based
    sensing policy (NSP) which may be incorporated into an OSA model. The sensing
    efficiency when using NSP is better when compared to the RSP. However, when the
    number of users increases more than the number of channels it could lead to control
    channel saturation problem since there will be a large number of nodes contending
    for the control channel. In the MAC protocol described in [23] only one pair of
    nodes uses the data channels in a time slot. Owing to spectrum heterogeneity not
    all the sensed channels are utilized. This leads to inefficient utilization of
    the spectrum. 4.2.2. Distributed OSA network with local control channels The spectrum
    allocation in the distributed OSA network with local control channels [16], [17]
    is location dependent. If the local (coordination) control channels are not available
    the network connectivity is temporarily lost. If there are frequent changes in
    the spectrum allocation (e.g. GSM band) then the control message overheads increase
    due to repeated reconfigurations. The network can also suffer due to the loading
    on the coordination nodes or group leaders. The HD-MAC protocol [16] achieves
    three important goals viz., provides fairness in access of the bridge nodes by
    different coordination groups, overcomes head-of-line blocking in the queues maintained
    by each node and provides a channel selection metric. However, it also suffers
    from some limitations. Group level and network level synchronization was not addressed.
    The HD-MAC protocol [16] does not address multi-channel hidden terminal problem.
    Chen et al. proposed the CogMesh [17] based on the idea of clustering. The CogMesh
    addressed issues like node discovery, spectrum access, inter-cluster and intra-cluster
    communications. However, the nature of the primary user spectrum has a direct
    impact on the CogMesh network. The clusters in the CogMesh [17] use private spreading
    codes to overcome hidden terminal problems. However, it is not clear how the spreading
    codes are selected. This problem may complicate when the number of clusters keeps
    varying. 4.2.3. Distributed OSA network with configurable control channel The
    control channel in the distributed OSA network with configurable control channel
    [18], [19] is not location dependent. The network connectivity within a neighborhood
    (one or two hops) can be maintained by repeatedly reconfiguring the coordination
    or control channel. However, this increases the reconfiguration overheads. The
    DUB-MAC [18] allocates different bands for the control channel and data channels.
    The signaling and control band (SCB) is located in the idle slots found in the
    GSM band while the data transmission band (DTB) are found in any licensed user
    system. In order to compensate for the nature of the SCB and DTB, the DUB-MAC
    [18] makes several modifications to the distributed coordination function (DCF)
    in IEEE 802.11 networks. However, there are several issues not addressed in the
    DUB-MAC protocol. Firstly, the network setup and initialization procedure is not
    explained. Multihop networks spanning many cells cannot be built since the same
    SCB might not be available in the surrounding cells. Secondly, the spectrum allocation
    of the SCB impacts the spectrum utilization in the DTB. The spectrum access described
    in DUB-MAC [18] focuses more on the dynamic nature of the SCB rather than that
    of the DTB. Thirdly, multiple networks might converge on the same SCB during SCB
    switching resulting in hidden and exposed nodes. The C-MAC protocol [19] proposed
    the idea of a rendezvous channel (RC) for multi-channel coordination. The RC was
    used to address issues like multi-channel hidden terminal problem, broadcasting
    and multicasting. However, there are certain issues not tackled by the C-MAC protocol.
    The importance of the beacon period (BP) in the MAC superframe was explained in
    Section 2.2.3.2. But it is not clear how the beacon slots are assigned to the
    nodes on a given channel. The C-MAC protocol [19] uses beacon broadcasts on every
    channel (including the RC) to address the hidden and exposed node problems thus
    increasing the communication overheads. Every node repeatedly switches to the
    RC to update details like its location, beacon group and extended beacon group
    since time synchronization is a critical issue in the C-MAC protocol. This results
    in more control message overheads. The control and communication overheads increase
    with an increase in network size and number of channels. 4.2.4. Distributed OSA
    network without a dedicated control channel The network coordination in the distributed
    CRN without a dedicated control channel is very difficult. Hence network connectivity
    is not guaranteed. These networks [20], [21], [24], [25] have to incur large overheads
    to achieve network coordination. Network setup is also very difficult to accomplish.
    The networks [20], [21], [24], [25] have not explained a neighbor discovery or
    network initialization procedure. The decentralized MAC (DC-MAC) scheme proposed
    by Zhao et al. [20] uses POMDP to allocate channels for a data transmission. The
    DC-MAC was proposed from a device point of view rather than a network perspective.
    In other words, the actions of each device are independent of those of its neighbors.
    The DC-MAC provides no protocol or algorithm to support neighbor discovery and
    data communication. Issues like hidden and exposed node problem are not discussed.
    The DC-MAC suggests the idea of incorporating the concept of busy tones to overcome
    collisions, but does not suggest how the busy tones can be related to the actions
    taken by the nodes. The limitation of busy tones was discussed in the case of
    DOSS [15]. An important contribution of the SRAC algorithm [21] is to bring forth
    the idea of cross-channel communication. However, the reliability of the SRAC
    algorithm [21] depends on the spectrum sensing capabilities of the receiving node
    because the transmitting node may not be aware of the primary user activity at
    the receiver. Because of the ARQ mechanism [28], the SRAC algorithm [21] incurs
    large control message overheads during network reconfiguration if there is frequent
    channel switching. Since there is no dedicated control channel the control packets
    in the SRAC scheme [21] are issued on all the available channels by the sender
    and the receiver, thereby increasing the control message overheads. The MAC layer
    schemes [24], [25] dealt with transmit power control and interference mitigation.
    The work in [24] is mostly node centric rather than a network centric approach.
    Haykin proposed a spectrum sensing technique based on MTM-SVD and transmit power
    control methods based on game theory (No-regrets) and information theory (iterative
    WF). Although Haykin’s work offers several insights into the role of cognitive
    radio (CR) devices it does not explain critical issues like control channel configuration,
    network setup, spectrum allocation and spectrum access. In [25], a STBC distributed
    ARQ based frequency sharing mechanism for multihop ad hoc network was proposed.
    Nodes in the multihop network act as relays during data transmission. Due to cooperative
    diversity gain of the network the transmission power of the nodes can be reduced
    thereby reducing the interference. However, Fujii and Suzuki [25] does not discuss
    issues like network initialization, hidden and exposed node problems. Also spectrum
    access based on distributed ARQ increases the communication overheads due to retransmissions
    and acknowledgement messages. 4.3. Qualitative analysis of distributed OSA networks
    From the properties of the distributed OSA networks it can be observed that the
    network coordination deteriorates as we move from the global control channel scenario
    to the without a dedicated control channel scenario. Hence the control and coordination
    overheads in the MAC protocol increase as we move from the global control channel
    scenario to the without a dedicated control channel scenario. However, the distributed
    CRN with without a dedicated control channel is more feasible and practical considering
    the implications of allocating a global control channel (e.g. maintenance costs,
    time synchronization, etc.). It can be seen that the MAC protocols described under
    the two local schemes namely, distributed CRN with local control channels and
    distributed CRN with configurable control channels provide a middle ground between
    the two extreme scenarios (global control channel and without a dedicated control
    channel). These two local schemes consume moderate control and coordination overheads
    while improving network coordination. However, the choice between the two local
    schemes is a subjective one. The local control channels scheme is suitable when
    there are enough common channels (which are based on the location of the nodes)
    connecting the groups in a network. These common channels should have more durability
    compared to the data channels used within the groups because their availability
    (varying in time) impacts the connectivity of the groups. The configurable control
    channel scheme addresses network connectivity better than the local control channel
    scheme since any channel (despite its dynamic nature) at any point in time can
    be used as a control channel within a group. Unlike the local control channel
    scheme which runs a reconfiguration operation only when the common control channels
    are not available, in the configurable control channel scheme the reconfiguration
    is done frequently (or periodically). Hence, the configurable control channel
    scheme incurs more reconfiguration overheads compared to the local control channel
    scheme. However the configurable control channel scheme handles mobility better
    than the local control channel scheme. Further, the network performance is dependent
    on the coordination nodes or group leaders in the local control channel scheme.
    5. Open research issues Prior to this section we explained the importance of the
    MAC protocol in the OSA network design and focused on the features of the existing
    MAC protocols developed for the OSA networks. In this section, we explore the
    opportunities for future research in the OSA networks. We also highlight several
    tradeoffs which the researchers have to consider while designing the OSA networks.
    We present the research issues according to the network topology. 5.1. Opportunities
    in centralized OSA networks A significant amount of research is needed on issues
    like co-existence of the centralized OSA network (e.g. WRAN [10] which spans a
    large geographic region) with other OSA networks. Secondary users of centralized
    spectrum access networks have to address issues like how to distinguish a licensed
    user from a secondary user belonging to another OSA network. Researchers need
    to investigate the role of interference metrics like the interference temperature
    [24] to improve spectrum utilization. The impact of the interference metrics on
    the QoS of a network may be of interest to define the user density in the geographical
    region of interest. An important research issue is to determine how the reliability
    of the spectrum allocation systems can be improved using spectrum sensing policies,
    and cooperative and distributed sensing techniques. Another research issue of
    interest is multihop communications in centralized spectrum allocation networks
    (e.g. in DSAP [12] and on-demand CPC [13]). 5.2. Opportunities in distributed
    OSA networks Spectrum heterogeneity poses great challenges when designing the
    distributed OSA networks. While addressing the research issues in distributed
    OSA networks the network topology deserves special attention. The same research
    issues may have to be addressed differently for different topologies based on
    the control channel allocation. Tradeoffs arise when ensuring reliability and
    network connectivity in terms of overheads (control, communication and reconfiguration).
    There are several key issues that have to be investigated in the design of distributed
    OSA networks. Some of the important issues in the OSA network design are listed
    below • Network coordination. • Spectrum sensing policies. • Time synchronization
    and mobility. • Improving spectrum efficiency. • Multihop network design. • Network
    setup. • Quality of service. • Real-time issues. In what follows, we briefly elaborate
    on each of the above issues. 5.2.1. Network coordination Network coordination
    was analyzed in terms of control channel allocation in Section 4.3. However, network
    coordination also depends on the number of transceivers in the node (secondary
    user). Network coordination can be improved by increasing the number of transceivers
    in a CR node. Thereby issues like sensing time constraint, sensing overhead, multi-channel
    hidden terminal problem can be mitigated. Most researchers [16], [17], [19], [21],
    [22] assume the nodes in the network to be comprised of a single radio interface
    while some researchers [14], [15], [23] use multiple transceivers. Though a single
    transceiver reduces the device cost, it causes time synchronization problem because
    the radio transceiver switches between multiple channels. Instead multiple transceivers
    can be used with one transceiver tuned to a control channel (if present) and other
    transceivers tuned to the data channels. Alternately in [23], a single wide band
    transceiver (OFDM transceiver) replaces the multiple data channel transceivers.
    Though the throughput is increased it also increases the device cost. Multi-channel
    hidden node problems can be easily addressed using multiple transceivers rather
    than a single transceiver. However, the dynamic nature of a licensed spectrum
    may lead to inefficient use of the multiple data channel transceivers in the device.
    5.2.2. Spectrum sensing policies In order to obtain full knowledge of a primary
    user spectrum the nodes have to sense every channel and share their sensing results
    with one another. However, this increases the sensing time and the sensing overhead
    depending on the number of transceivers. The tradeoffs need to be determined between
    the sensing constraints (sensing time and sensing overhead) and the device complexity.
    Spectrum sensing policies can be used to alleviate the sensing time. Spectrum
    sensing policies also improve spectrum allocation. Two MAC protocols which implement
    spectrum sensing policies [22], [23] were described in this paper. Both schemes
    were intended for the distributed OSA network with global control channel. Researchers
    may develop spectrum sensing policies for other network topologies discussed in
    this paper. Different sensing policies are required according to the network coordination.
    A crucial issue to be tackled is overcoming the control channel saturation due
    to increasing sensing overheads; this can result if there is a large number of
    nodes and channels to be sensed. 5.2.3. Time synchronization and mobility Time
    synchronization and mobility are interlinked problems. Time synchronization is
    required for network coordination. Time synchronization is also affected when
    the licensed spectrum is not slotted. In such cases it is a challenge to coordinate
    spectrum sensing and access among the secondary users. Mobility of the nodes can
    cause time synchronization problems. The global control channel scheme requires
    strict time synchronization (e.g. [14] uses GPS). Time synchronization requirement
    can be relaxed as we move towards network without a dedicated control channel.
    However, such networks fail to handle mobility. This could lead to an increase
    in reconfiguration overheads. Mobility has not been addressed for other network
    topologies. 5.2.4. Improving spectrum efficiency The spectrum efficiency in a
    heterogeneous environment can be defined as the effective utilization of the spectrum
    holes (absence of primary user) by multiple secondary users simultaneously subject
    to an interference threshold. The interference threshold may be described as an
    upper bound of the permissible interference caused by a secondary user. Since
    most wireless networks use interference avoidance as a policy for spectrum access,
    it greatly impacts the efficiency of spectrum usage. Hence researchers may determine
    an interference threshold in order to improve spectrum efficiency. The impact
    of the interference threshold on network capacity needs to be investigated as
    well. Though this paper deals only with MAC protocols in overlay OSA networks
    the cognitive radio (CR) paradigm also includes the underlay schemes and those
    which focus on the spectrum utilization in the unlicensed bands (ISM and UNII).
    Discussion on such schemes is beyond the scope of this paper. For example, the
    cognitive medium access (CMA) [31] deals with issue of co-existence of WLANs with
    Bluetooth based CR devices. Here the WLAN is perceived as the primary user and
    the CR devices act as the secondary users. The CR devices use frequency hopping
    (FH) similar to the Bluetooth devices but each hop is preceded by a spectrum sensing
    operation. Sadler et al. [31] have statistically modeled the behaviour of the
    WLANs and measured the interference to the WLANs in terms of the packet error
    rate in WLAN traffic. However issues such as the throughput of the CR network
    and its impact on the network capacity of both the WLAN and the CR network have
    not been discussed in the literature. Similarly, the licensed spectrum may be
    statistically modeled and suitable modulation or multiple access schemes may be
    determined for co-existence between the licensed and unlicensed users. 5.2.5.
    Multihop network design The extent of control channel allocation plays a crucial
    role in the multihop communication. The global control channel scheme [14], [15]
    addresses the multihop communication easily. The local control channels scheme
    [16], [17] addresses the multihop communication with moderate overheads. However,
    the local control channel scheme may suffer when the coordination nodes are burdened
    or become dysfunctional. The configurable control channel schemes [18], [19] have
    not addressed the multihop communication. It would be a challenge to addresses
    multihop communication when the control channels (or coordination channels) are
    repeatedly reconfigured. The configurable control channel scheme may involve higher
    overheads compared to the local control channels scheme. However this may be overcome
    if the configurable control channel scheme can configure the channel with the
    least primary user traffic as the control channel. Multihop communications for
    distributed OSA networks without a dedicated control channel is still an unexplored
    area. 5.2.6. Network setup in distributed OSA networks One of the most crucial
    issues often not addressed in the distributed OSA networks is the network setup
    or neighbor discovery process. This aspect is mostly neglected in the distributed
    OSA network without a dedicated control channel. For instance, the DC-MAC [20]
    provides spectrum opportunity optimization method for a node based on the POMDP
    with no reference to network design. Most networks assume the network to already
    exist (e.g. DUB-MAC [18] and SRAC algorithm [21]). Thus, even the initial spectrum
    allocation is assumed to be known. 5.2.7. Quality of service Not much work has
    been reported in QoS supportive MAC protocols since the dynamic nature of the
    heterogeneous spectrum can cause rapid variations in the available bandwidth.
    QoS supportive MAC protocols have been reported only for the global control channel
    scheme [22], [23]. QoS in other distributed network topologies has not been explored.
    The QoS becomes a challenge when the primary user traffic on the channels has
    different distributions. Techniques like dynamic data rate may have to be incorporated.
    Research on the SDR [1] has been gaining importance recently allowing CR researchers
    to assume functions like multimode operation and incorporating protocols like
    the MultiMAC [32]. These techniques might allow the CR devices to transmit data
    requiring QoS. The MultiMAC protocol [32] though not designed for OSA networks
    is an attractive solution since the user can select a MAC layer (CSMA or TDMA)
    depending on the data type to be transmitted. 5.2.8. Real-time issues Although
    most of the MAC protocols summarized in this paper are theoretically applicable
    for OSA networks, they have implementation issues in real-time. This is due to
    the limitations of the hardware available today. The devices consume considerable
    time for operations such as spectrum sensing, processing and switching. In other
    words, the wireless devices take time to detect the spectrum opportunities and
    to complete any data transmission. If the occurrence of the spectrum holes is
    randomly varying and the spectrum holes are available for very small duration
    (e.g., 577 μs in a GSM superframe) then the detection and processing time of the
    device should be several orders smaller than the duration of the spectrum holes.
    In order to overcome this constraint the MAC schemes which can predict future
    spectrum opportunities and minimize the sensing and processing time should be
    investigated. 6. Conclusion Cognitive radio based opportunistic spectrum access
    (OSA) networks are going to play an important role in the search for efficient
    ways of using the increasingly crowded wireless spectrum. This paper has presented
    a comprehensive survey of the MAC protocols for OSA networks. The MAC protocol
    is critical to the design of OSA networks. Unlike the legacy wireless networks
    which treat the MAC layer as an independent module, the MAC protocols in OSA networks
    incorporate several cross-layer issues especially relating to the dynamic physical
    medium. In this survey, we have shown that the tradeoffs involved in the design
    of the MAC protocol depend on the network topology in significant ways. Several
    MAC protocols belonging to the different network topologies have been discussed
    independently and through a comparative analysis. This paper also discussed several
    open research challenges for the MAC protocol implementation in OSA networks.

    ABSTRACT Throughput maximization is one of the main challenges in cognitive radio
    ad hoc networks, where local spectrum resources may change from time to time and
    hop-by-hop. For this reason, a cross-layer opportunistic spectrum access and dynamic
    routing algorithm for cognitive radio networks is proposed, called ROSA (ROuting
    and Spectrum Allocation algorithm). Through local control actions, ROSA aims at
    maximizing the network throughput by performing joint routing, dynamic spectrum
    allocation, scheduling, and transmit power control. Specifically, the algorithm
    dynamically allocates spectrum resources to maximize the capacity of links without
    generating harmful interference to other users while guaranteeing bounded BER
    for the receiver. In addition, the algorithm aims at maximizing the weighted sum
    of differential backlogs to stabilize the system by giving priority to higher-capacity
    links with high differential backlog. The proposed algorithm is distributed, computationally
    efficient, and with bounded BER guarantees. ROSA is shown through discrete-event
    packet-level simulations to outperform baseline solutions leading to a high throughput,
    low delay, and fair bandwidth allocation. References I. F. Akyildiz, W.-Y. Lee,

    SHARE Abstract In order to fully utilise limited spectrum resources of multiple
    channels and multiple radios in cognitive radio networks, the authors propose
    a potential game model for opportunistic spectrum access based on both accurate
    and inaccurate spectrum state estimation with considering the interference constraints
    of licensed users. Three algorithms are proposed to achieve equilibrium of the
    proposed game. First, assuming spectrum sensing results are accurate, a joint
    strategy fictitious play-based channel selection algorithm with incomplete information
    is presented, and it can achieve a pure Nash equilibrium (NE) of the proposed
    game. Second, in order to make the outcomes of game robust, an evolutionary spectrum
    access mechanism with complete information is introduced by using evolutionary
    game theory based on inaccurate spectrum state estimation so that evolutionary
    stable strategy (ESS) can be achieved. Finally, with incomplete network information,
    a distributed learning algorithm is proposed to achieve a mixed NE, which is proved
    to be an ESS. Simulation results show that these algorithms can significantly
    improve spectrum allocation efficiency while reducing mutual collision. Nomenclature

    applications of mobile and wireless technologies overwhelm the limited spectrum
    supply. The need for smarter and better spectrum usage is becoming urgent due
    to the limited available spectrum. Therefore, it is necessary to exploit the existing
    wireless spectrum opportunistically so that the limited spectrum can be re-used
    more effectively. Research in the area has shown that dynamic spectrum access
    (DSA) and cognitive radio technology are promising approaches to facilitating
    efficient use of fragmented and under-utilised spectrum [1]. The dynamic spectrum
    access (DSA for short), also named as opportunistic spectrum access (OSA for short),
    allows unlicensed users (or secondary users, SUs for short) to dynamically access
    the unoccupied bands released from licensed users (or primary users, PUs for short)
    on an opportunistic basis [2]. In OSA, when a SU detects one or multiple spectrum
    holes, released from any PUs, it reconfigures its transmission parameters to utilise
    the available spectrum. After that, the SUs will have to release their spectrum
    belonging to PUs, and switch themselves to inactive mode whenever any PUs becomes
    active. In order to improve the performance of the OSA in cognitive radio networks
    (CRNs for short) and to reduce interference, game theory has been applied and
    efficient algorithms are keys to schedule the process of OSA to allow spectrum
    usage more efficient. There are many open problems and interesting approaches
    in this area, such as decision-theoretic solutions for channel selection and access
    strategies for OSA system, spectrum assignment in CRNs with interference, and
    the criteria for selecting the most suitable portion of the spectrum [3, 4]. The
    study in [5] shows that cognitive radio can coexist with multiple parallel wireless
    local ad-hoc network channels by interference constraint. In [6], it is shown
    that the myopic sensing policy has a simple robust structure to reduce channel
    selection to a round-robin procedure without the need for knowing channel transition
    probabilities. However, most of the existing models need both complete channel
    statistics and state, collected by information exchange via a common control channel,
    which leads to significant communication overhead and energy consumption. This
    is very inefficient in real networks. Therefore, a continuous-time Markov models
    is used to estimate channel statics and state for DSA in open spectrum wireless
    networks, without having to exchange those information [7]. However, this work
    ignores the influence of PUs in the DSA, and fails to improve the energy efficiency.
    An optimisation model for both maximising end-to-end throughput per unit of energy
    consumption and minimising the delay constraint specified for a data stream is
    introduced, and a novel distributive and self-organised heuristic channel assignment
    algorithm to this optimisation model is also presented in [8]. The work in [9]
    presents a new network selection and channel allocation mechanism, in order to
    increase revenue by accommodating more SUs with regard to their preferences, while
    at the same time, without disrespecting the primary network operator''s policies.
    An interesting optimisation problem is formulated for minimising the accumulated
    interference incurred to licensed users, however, it does not take into account
    the interactions between SUs. The authors in [10-12] consider the access problem
    in a multichannel opportunistic communication system with imperfect sensing. In
    these methods, the state of each channel evolves as an independent and identically
    distributed Markov process. Game theory is an effective tool for modelling the
    interactions among independent decision makers, and it has been widely applied
    in CRN to improve random access and energy efficiency [13-19]. With game theory,
    dynamic spectrum sharing has several key aspects, needed to be considered, including
    analysis of network users'' behaviours, efficient dynamic distributed design,
    and optimality analysis [13]. The model in [14] characterises Nash equilibria
    (NEs) of random access games (RAGs), studies their dynamics, and proposes distributed
    algorithms to achieve NE. A further study in [17] investigates two special cases
    of local interaction game, which can cope with drawbacks of centralised control
    and local influences. However, these models did not consider the interference
    constraints of PUs and dynamic of a game, and therefore, these models are ineffective
    in CRNs. This paper steps further for those exiting problems in CRNs, aiming to
    evaluate the maximum achievable rate while minimising collisions of a system under
    different access scenarios in CRNs. We first design a framework of opportunistic
    spectrum access based on game theory, which is named OSAG, to study the issues
    of how SUs compete and cooperate in multiple radios and multiple channels in CRNs
    based on accurate spectrum state estimation. The pure-strategy NE for the SUs
    is investigated by proposing a joint strategy fictitious play (JSFP)-based channel
    selection algorithm. Then for the situation where spectrum sensing results are
    not always available, we propose a framework for analysing spectrum access strategies
    by estimating inaccurate spectrum state, and by analysing the SUs'' achievable
    capacity and collisions with other users (including PUs and other SUs). In order
    to make the outcomes of game robust, we investigate an evolutionary spectrum access
    algorithm by using evolutionary game theory, which is a centralised learning algorithm.
    However, centralised learning algorithm does not fit into many real distributed
    environments, and therefore we turn to a new distributed learning algorithm based
    on stochastic learning automata in order to achieve mixed NE. We prove that the
    mixed NE is an evolutionary stable strategy (ESS). We summarise our contributions
    as: A non-cooperative potential game among the SUs is presented to fully utilise
    rare spectrum resources and to improve energy efficiency in CRNs. The game also
    considers complete and incomplete information, available in CRNs. The pure-strategy
    and mixed-strategy NEs for the SUs are investigated. As spectrum sensing results
    are not always available, we propose a framework, first, for analysing spectrum
    access strategies based on both accurate and inaccurate spectrum state estimation,
    and second, for analysing the SUs'' achievable capacity and collision with other
    users (including both all PUs and other SUs). In order to maximise the performance
    of spectrum sharing, three learning algorithms are proposed so that SUs can achieve
    the NEs of the OSAG, if the network is not on a steady state. The algorithms are
    evaluated by numerical experiments and the results show that the proposed scheme
    can better improve the performance for SUs, compared to other schemes. In the
    experiments, we find that our method gains higher throughput than the random scheme,
    and the RAG [14]. The rest of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 introduces
    the system model and symbols used in the paper. In Section 3, a potential game
    model based on accurate spectrum state estimation, which is used to investigate
    the properties of NE, is presented, and a distributed learning algorithm for achieving
    the pure NE is proposed. Section 4 analyses the proposed game based on inaccurate
    spectrum state estimation, and introduces two learning solutions based on inaccurate
    spectrum state estimation for achieving ESS. Simulation results are presented
    in Section 5. Finally, this paper is concluded in Section 6. 2 Definitions and
    system model In this paper, we assume a CRN consists of a primary network with
    multiple licensed users (or primary users/PUs) and a secondary network with multiple
    unlicensed users (or secondary users/SUs). The set of SUs is denoted as M = {1,
    2, …, m}. Assuming that there are n available channels in CRN, the set of channels
    is denoted as N = {1, 2, …, n}. In CRNs, if the authorised spectrum is not fully
    utilised by PUs all the time, the PUs could lease the unused channels to SUs for
    monetary gains. Since the unlicensed spectrum is busy for SUs, SUs may wish to
    pay for some unused channels from PUs for more communication gains. We also assume
    each SU is selfish, and it can sense all channels from PUs, but can only access
    one channel after sensing part of the channels. As shown in Fig. 1, where the
    solid and dashed lines represent the primary link (primary transmitter–primary
    receiver) and the secondary link (secondary transmitter–secondary receiver), respectively.
    We denote the transmit power of SU j as ℘j, for , and the complex channel gain
    of secondary link in channel i as , which satisfies , for and . Note that the
    communication activity of the SUs creates interference at the PUs. The maximum
    tolerable average interference at the primary transmitter is called interference
    threshold [6], denoted by I. The interference threshold is introduced by the Federal
    Communications Commission (FCC) [20] which indicates the tolerable interference
    level at the primary receiver imposed by the operation of the secondary service.
    Technically, as long as the interference threshold constraint is satisfied, the
    spectrum is underutilised. Therefore, the transmit power at SUs should be adjusted
    so that the average interference received at primary receiver is always below
    I. Different from underlay spectrum access strategy, the overlay spectrum access
    strategy ignores the interference threshold during inactive periods of the channels.
    However, the main requirement for such approach is to have an online detection
    of the idle and busy periods with an acceptable level of accuracy. So in this
    paper, we develop our spectrum access method in two different cases which are
    based on accurate and inaccurate spectrum state estimation. The notations and
    definitions are summarised in the Nomenclature section. Fig. 1 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint CRN consisting of a primary network and a secondary network
    with considering the interference between these two networks 2.1 Spectrum access
    based on accurate spectrum state estimation In a network, each SU estimates its
    conditional collision probability and adjusts its channel access probability.
    We assume that there are other SUs (excluding j) competing channel i with SU j,
    where i ∈ N and j ∈ M. It is well known that the probability of successfully accessing
    an idle channel i for SU j is (1) where is the probability of SU j choosing channel
    i. Then the probability of node j being involved in a collision with other SUs
    on channel i in a decision slot is (2) According to [21], the average achievable
    rate of SU j in channel i is given as follows (3) where η is additive white Gaussian
    noise in SUs, and we assume all channels have identical values for η. The main
    objective of this paper is to evaluate the maximum achievable capacity of SUs.
    Therefore, the SUs in M need to decide the optimal spectrum access actions to
    maximise their achievable capacity and a spectrum access and power control strategy
    for SU j becomes an optimisation problem as (4) where ℘max is the maximum transmit
    power of SUs. 2.2 Spectrum access based on inaccurate spectrum state estimation
    In practice, the spectrum sensing results are not always accurate. Therefore,
    if the spectrum access system is not designed to manage the miss-detection incidents,
    the collision between the PU and SU transmissions can potentially reduce the actual
    capacity of the primary network. We use ε to denote the probability of miss-detection,
    i.e. the probability of estimating the spectrum state as ‘idle’, while it is busy.
    Similarly, let ω be the probability of false-alarm, i.e. the probability of estimating
    the spectrum state as ‘busy’, while it is idle. Let S ∈ {0, 1} denote the channel
    state, and S′ denotes the sensing outcome, where means the channel i is sensed
    to be busy (idle). Using such notation, the probability of miss-detection and
    the probability of false-alarm can be shown as (5) From each PU''s point of view,
    the best case is ε = 0, while from the SU''s point of view, it should be ω = 0.
    However, due to some practical limitations, i.e. the spectrum sensing techniques,
    a tolerance on miss-detection and false-alarm probabilities is acceptable. Hence,
    in the case of inaccurate spectrum state estimation, the communication activity
    of the secondary transmitter leads to interference at the primary receiver. In
    order to express the communication activity of SUs and PUs, we show the schematic
    of the spectrum sharing system in Fig. 2. As shown in Fig. 2, the secondary transmitter
    generates interference at the primary receiver through the channel with the complex
    channel gain of link SU j to primary receiver, gjp. Besides, in the case of miss-detection,
    the primary transmitter also creates interference at the secondary receiver through
    the channel with the complex channel gain of link primary transmitter to secondary
    receiver, gpj. Fig. 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Schematic of the spectrum
    sharing system based on inaccurate spectrum state estimation Table 1 shows the
    interference at the PUs imposed by the SUs based on inaccurate spectrum state
    estimation. As shown in Table 1, only in the case of ‘S′ = 1|S = 0’, the SU j
    causes interference at the primary receiver. According to Fig. 2 and Table 1,
    we can calculate the average interference at primary receiver imposed by the SU
    j as (6) Table 1. Interference imposed by the SUs based on inaccurate spectrum

    0 gjp gjp does SU j cause interference at primary receiver? no no yes no We denote
    the interference threshold as I, hence, the transmitted power at secondary transmitters
    should be adjusted so that the average interference received at primary receiver
    is lower than I. The constraint of the interference can be defined as (7) In the
    case of spectrum access based on inaccurate spectrum state estimation, the average
    achievable rate of SU j in channel i is (8) where ℘p is transmit power of PU,
    gpj represents the channel with the complex channel gain of link primary transmitter
    to secondary receiver, and is the probability of successfully accessing an idle
    channel i for SU j, and In the case of miss-detection, the successful access probability
    of SUs is decreased by ε. Similarly, in the case of false-alarm, the access probability
    of the SUs decreases by ω. Then the optimisation problem in (4) can be rewritten
    as (10) Remark 1.The channel allocation and power control problems formulated
    in (4) and (10) are difficult to solve since the same spectrum access strategy
    of multiple SUs may cause collisions in the secondary network. Therefore, an unrational
    access strategy may cause transmission failure. To overcome this, in the rest
    of this paper, a potential game model is proposed to allocate SU''s power and
    spectrum access strategy among all SUs to maximise system''s revenue in both distributed
    and centralised fashion. 3 Game theoretic spectrum access In order to cope with
    the problem of scarce spectrum resources with considering interference constrain,
    we study opportunistic spectrum access joint with power control based on game
    theory. In this section, we first design a framework of opportunistic spectrum
    access based on game theory (named OSAG) to demonstrate competition and cooperation
    among multiple radios and multiple channels in CRNs with an accurate spectrum
    state estimation. Then a distributed algorithm is proposed to achieve pure NE.
    Finally, we develop our analysis based on inaccurate spectrum sensing results.
    3.1 OSAG model based on accurate spectrum state estimation In order to achieve
    high efficiency (high throughput and low collision) and better fairness, we propose
    an opportunistic spectrum accessing strategy to stabilise the network into a steady
    state. We first show the definition of OSAG model with pure strategy as follows:
    Definition 1.The OSAG model consists: Player set: The set of SUs in the CRN M;
    Strategy set: , is denoted as node j''s action, j ∈ M, where N = {1, 2, …, n}
    is the set of channels, and [0, ℘max] represents the transmit power set of SUs;
    Utility set: {uj, j = 1, …, m}, where uj represents the utility function of the
    SU j. Obviously, , where for 1 ≤ k ≤ n denotes a channel is chosen or not, is
    a mixed strategy of OSAG. If node j chooses channel xj, , where the corresponding
    entry xj = 1. For each SU, a utility function is defined as the gain of signal
    transmission minus the cost of collision, hence, the instantaneous utility of
    node j in a decision slot is designed as (11) where a is the gain per unit of
    rate and b is the cost per unit collision. In (11), represents the income of SU
    based on the achievable rate and is the cost of contention. For each SU, it wants
    to improve its capacity of communication and reduce its collision with other SUs.
    Hence, it aims at maximising its utility in (11). The utility of system, which
    is defined as the minimum utility of all the SUs (12) where and are decision vectors
    of SUs in M. Then the system''s objective based on accurate spectrum state estimation
    is to find the optimal channel selection x and transmit power ℘ of SUs such that
    the system utility is maximised. Formally (13) The property of OSAG model with
    pure strategy is characterised by the following theorem. Theorem 1.The OSAG model
    is an ordinal potential game, and the system utility maximisation problem in (13)
    constitutes a pure strategy NE of the proposed game. Proof.We construct the potential
    function as follows (14) For every channel, we do not consider the differences
    between different channels in this paper, then we have (15) Finally, we get .
    Besides, ordinal potential game belongs to potential games, which has been widely
    applied to wireless communication systems. Potential game exhibits several good
    properties and the most important two aspects are as follows: (i) every potential
    game has at least one pure strategy NE; and (ii) any global or local maximisation
    of the potential function constitutes a pure strategy NE. Hence, the theorem holds
    based on the above properties. Remark 2.It is difficult to obtain optimal solution
    for (13), since (i) there is no control centre for SUs, (ii) the number of SUs
    is unknown, (iii) the spectrum sensing mechanisms may be imperfect and (iv) there
    is no information exchange between SUs. 3.2 Distributed learning algorithm based
    on JSFP for achieving the pure NE In this subsection, we assume that the spectrum
    sensing results are accurate. In this case, the interference at PUs caused by
    SUs equals to zero. Therefore, the optimisation problem for (13) turns into (16)
    The dynamics of OSAG studies how interacting players could converge to a NE, it
    is a difficult problem in general. In the setting of random access, SUs can observe
    the outcome (collision or throughput) of the actions of others, but do not have
    direct knowledge of other SUs'' actions and payoffs. Motivated by the underlying
    idea of JSFP, we propose a JSFP-based channel selection (JCS) algorithm, with
    which the SUs can finally adjust their behaviour towards a pure NE point with
    incomplete information. In the JCS algorithm, each player tracks the empirical
    frequencies of the joint actions of all other players. Define the empirical frequency,
    , as the percentage of stages at which player j has chosen the action xj[t] up
    to time t–1, i.e. (17) where represents the empirical frequency vector. Note that
    the dimension of vj[t] is n. is the percentage of stages at which other players
    have chosen the joint action profile x−j[t] up to time t–1, i.e. (18) where .
    v−j[t] is denoted as the empirical frequency vector formed by the components .
    Note that the dimension of v−j[t] is the cardinality | × j≠kNk|. JCS requires
    that each agent maintains a hypothetical payoff for each action xj[t] such that
    (19) Note that this hypothetical payoff can be computed recursively and a player
    only needs to access the payoff for alternative actions at each time step. For
    the game of spectrum access, the pure NE satisfies (20) Substituting (18) into
    (19) results in (21) We denote as , then we have (22) Lemma 1.In a finite n-person
    game, if at any time t > 0 the joint action x[t] generated by a JSFP is: (i) a

    3.The OSAG model provides a general analytical framework to model a large set
    of system-wide QoS models via the specification of local utility functions. Besides,
    system-wide fairness or service differentiation can be achieved in a distributed
    manner as long as each node executes JCS algorithm. 4 Learning solutions for achieving
    evolutionary stable based on inaccurate spectrum state estimation In this section,
    we study the case when inaccurate spectrum sensing happens in CRNs. We first conduct
    an analysis of the proposed game based on inaccurate spectrum state estimation.
    Then a learning algorithm based on evolutionary game theory with complete information
    is proposed to achieve the ESS of proposed game. However, this algorithm may lead
    to significant communication overhead, and then it may be impossible in some distributed
    systems. We thus propose an algorithm based on the stochastic learning automaton
    with incomplete information to achieve the mixed NE of OSAG model for distributed
    spectrum access. 4.1 Analysis of the proposed game based on inaccurate spectrum
    state estimation According to the constraint of the interference in (7), the optimisation
    problem in (13) becomes (23) and the utility function of SU j is represented by
    (24) In the case of miss-detection, the successfully access probability of SUs
    is decreased by ε. Similarly, in the case of false-alarm, the access probability
    of the SUs decreases by ω. In order to maximise its own utility with the interference
    constrain, each SU adjusts its individual power-allocation and spectrum access
    strategy. We find that: Theorem 2.The proposed game based on inaccurate spectrum
    state estimation has an optimal strategy such that is maximised. Proof.Since is
    a continuous function on the compact set [0, ℘max], it can achieve its maximum
    value at some ℘ ∈ [0, ℘max] [23]. The first-order partial derivative of with respective
    to ℘j, j ∈ M is shown as (25) It is easy to obtain that is an increasing function
    on the compact set [0, ℘max]. Then we can get the optimal power strategy based
    on the interference constrain in (7) as follows (26) Therefore, there is a unique
    optimal power-allocation strategy of SU j to the optimisation problem. Then for
    the given , probability of miss-detection ε and probability of false-alarm ω,
    we can easily prove that the proposed game with inaccurate spectrum sensing results
    is an ordinal potential game based in Theorem 1. More important, there is a unique
    for SU j, j ∈ M, to the optimal problem (23). Remark 4.Equation (26) shows that
    for a given interference threshold I, a SU is allowed to transmit signals with
    a lower power if the probability of miss-detection ε is higher. Besides, from
    the SUs viewpoint, the ideal spectrum sensing procedure has false-alarm probability
    equal to zero. Hence, it is more difficult for SUs to handle the spectrum access
    strategies in the CRNs. 4.2 Evolutionary learning algorithm with complete information
    In OSAG, the population state describes the dynamics of the reproduction process,
    where for i ∈ N, yi[t] is the proportion of SUs in secondary network selecting
    channel i at time t. Specially, represents the proportion of node j selecting
    a pure strategy xj at time t. Then we design the replicator dynamics as follows
    (27) where is the average utility of the population, is the utility of SU j, choosing
    strategy xj[t] based on the population y[t] at time t, and β > 0 is the rate of
    strategy adaptation. The replicator dynamics means that the strategy works better
    than the average will be promoted. The average utility of the network is defined
    as follows (28) In order to make the outcomes of OSAG robust and to have good
    stability properties under an important sort of dynamic, an ESS is investigated
    as follows: Definition 2.A pure strategy yopt is an ESS, if for all y ≠ yopt in
    some vicinity of yopt, there is an expected payoff function satisfying (1) ; (2)
    if , then . To be specific, in condition 1 yopt is the best response strategy
    of the game, hence it is a NE; and condition 2 is interpreted as a stability condition.
    Considering the spectrum sensing results may be wrong, for the given miss-detection
    probability ε and false-alarm probability ω, we can easily obtain the optimal
    power strategy of SU j according to (26). Then system''s utility turns into a
    function of y, and we redenote it as . Hence the optimal problem (23) turns into
    (29) where represents the maximum optimal power strategy of SUs in the secondary
    network. Based on the evolutionary game theory and the concept of an ESS, we propose
    a learning solution for achieving ESS in channel selection shown in Algorithm
    2, which is based on the complete information. Algorithm 2: Evolutionary learning
    for achieving ESS in channel selection (ELES) Algorithm.Given the number of channels
    n, the number of SUs m, interference threshold I, the complex channel gain of
    secondary link g, miss-detection probability ε and false-alarm probability ω,
    and the rate of strategy adaptation β. Initialise: t = 0 • each SU j ∈ M randomly
    take action xj[0]; • obtain the population state y[0]; • estimate the expected
    utility uj[0] and u′[0] according to (11) and (12), respectively; Learn: loop
    for each t and each SU • broadcast the chosen channel to the other SUs through
    a common control channel; • receive the information of other SUs'' channel selection
    and calculate the population state y[t]; • calculate the utility according to
    (11) and the average utility of network by (28); • if , select another channel
    xj[t] with a probability: . In general, the equilibrium of the replicator dynamics
    may not be an ESS [24]. The following theorem shows the evolutionary stability
    of the equilibrium. Theorem 3.The ELES algorithm converges to an equilibrium yopt
    such that SUs on different channels achieve the same expected utility shown as
    follows (30) Specially, this equilibrium is an ESS. Proof.Since , it follows that
    It means that the yopt in (29) is an equilibrium of the proposed game. Then we
    suppose a SU k, k ∈ M, makes an unilateral deviation to another channel xk* ≠
    xk, the population state turns into (31) Hence, the system''s utility becomes
    (32) For the equilibrium yopt, we have . Hence, is satisfied, for . In conclusion,
    based on the definition of ESS in Definition 2, we can get that yopt is a strict
    NE, and also an ESS. Remark 5.In Algorithm 2, it is necessary for each SU to know
    the number of SUs at every time slot and the system average payoff, decisions
    on channel selection from other SUs and the population state. However, it is unlikely
    that all these information will be available. Therefore, we propose a new distributed
    algorithm in the following subsection without the need for information exchange.
    4.3 Dynamic and distributed learning algorithm based on the stochastic learning
    automaton with incomplete information for issues As we already mentioned, xopt
    is a pure NE of OSAG. However, during the process of players learning from the
    strategies interactions, the percentage of players using a certain pure strategy
    may change. The population evolution is characterised by replicator dynamics in
    evolutionary game theory. A strategy is an ESS if and only if it is asymptotically
    stable to the replicator dynamics [25]. It is important to achieve an ESS with
    SUs'' local information based on the inaccurate spectrum state estimation. Here
    in Algorithm 3, we present a distributed learning solution, called DLES for short,
    by using the inaccurate spectrum sensing results to achieve the ESS. Algorithm
    3: Distributed learning for achieving ESS in channel selection (DLES) Algorithm.Given
    the number of channels n, maximum transmit power of SUs ℘max, the complex channel
    gain of secondary link g, miss-detection probability ε and false-alarm probability
    ω, and parameter c. Initialise: t = 0 • each SU j ∈ M randomly take action xj[0],
    then getXj[0]; • estimate the expected utility according to (11); Choose a strategy
    at time t–1: • choose a channel xj[t − 1] ∈ N to access according to the mixed
    strategy Xj[t − 1]; • calculate the utility by (11); Learn: • all the active nodes
    update Xj[t] strategy according to (33); • choose a channel xj[t] ∈ N to access
    according to the mixed strategy Xj[t]; • if Xj[t] = Xj[t − 1] is a stationary
    point, stop; • otherwise, go to Step 2 until convergence occurs. Without information
    exchange, we define the process of strategy updating as follows (33) where 0 <
    c < 1 is a parameter for controlling the process of strategy updating, and is
    a unit vector of appropriate dimension with xjth component unity. It is easy to
    see from (33) that DLES algorithm is completely distributed. Since the updating
    rule is only dependent on their individual action-utility experiences. It is also
    noted that it neither needs any information exchange, nor monitors the actions
    taken by other users. Theorem 4.Consider the sequence of processes {Xj[t]}, {Xj[t]}
    converges weakly, as c → 0. Proof.Let denote the state of the team at t. Under
    Algorithm 3 and (33), is a Markov process. Besides, note that is a piecewise-constant,
    which is right continuous and have left-hand limits. First, we define a function
    f satisfies (34) where is the resulting utility of SUs. This function represents
    the updating specified by (33), and is bounded and continuous and it does not
    depend on c. Then define another function ϕ by (35) Consider an ordinary differential
    equation (36) Hence by Sastry et al. [26] (Theorem 3.1), the ordinary differential
    (36) has a unique solution, and the sequence converges weakly as c → 0 to the
    solution of (36). The convergence of functions implied by weak convergence ensured
    by Theorem 4, along with the knowledge of the nature of the solutions of the ordinary
    differential (36), enables us to understand the long term behaviour of . Then
    we focus on the solution to the ordinary differential (36), and a theorem is given
    as follows: Theorem 5.If parameter c is sufficiently small, the solution of ordinary
    differential (36) in Theorem 4 is an ESS of the proposed game. Proof.We first
    denote as a bounded set [0, 1]m×n. Some properties can be got from [26] (Theorem
    3.2): (i) all corners of are stationary points, (ii) all NEs are stationary points,
    (iii) all stationary points that are not NE are unstable. So all the stationary
    points are NEs, and (iv) all corners of that are strict NEs (in pure strategies)
    are asymptotically stable. Then we let be a corner of , i.e. a NE, and be the
    solution of (36). Based on Theorem 4, the converges weakly to . Then is a stationary
    point and also strict NE in . So is an ESS of the proposed game in pure strategies.
    5 Simulation We conduct a set of simulations to evaluate the performance of the
    strategies in this section. We consider a CRN with n = 5 channels and its bandwidth
    of channels W = 11 Mbps, and the interference threshold I = 0.5, a = 1 and b =
    10. We assume that complex channel gain of all secondary links'' are the same
    and equal to g = 0.3. Miss-detection probability and false-alarm probability of
    all SUs are assumed to be the same. For the purposes of comparison, we present
    a scenario as benchmark scheme: SUs randomly set their strategies, regardless
    of the existence of the others, which is denoted as random spectrum access (RAND)
    model. Fig. 3 shows the system utility against the number of SUs based on accurate
    spectrum state estimation, where X represents the average access probability of
    each SU. It is obvious that the function of utility increases non-linearly with
    the number of SUs m. The reason is that the spectrum opportunities are limited,
    and then it seems disadvantageous for SUs to access spectrum with a high probability
    in a time slot. In particular, in the case of X = 1, it is noted that the throughput
    of network is negative when Nj > 10. In short, each SU will get a higher utility,
    if it can take a rational strategy. Fig. 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint System
    utility against the number of SUs based on accurate spectrum state estimation
    The comparison results of the proposed model (OSAG) and RAND model based on accurate
    spectrum state estimation with different number of SUs are shown in Fig. 4. Specially,
    Fig. 4 also shows the impact of α on the utility values of node j, j ∈ M with
    ℘max = 20. We can observe that the utility values of node increases as α increasing
    from α = 0 and α = 1. For SU j, the proposed model with m = 5 leads to the highest
    utility values compared with the proposed model with m = 10 and RAND scheme. It
    is because j in the OSGA model prepares for the worst case where the other SUs
    are selfish and competing with j on the same channel. One can also observe from
    Fig. 4 that for a specific α, the utility value of the OSAG corresponding to m
    = 5 is strictly higher than that of m = 10. The reason is that the more SUs the
    network has, the more likely the collisions they have, which decreases the utility.
    Fig. 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Utility of SU against α based on accurate
    spectrum state estimation Fig. 5 shows the impact of ε on the utility values of
    SU j, j ∈ M with α = 0.5, ℘max = 20 and ω = 0.05. The SU''s utility value decreases
    as the miss-detection probability ε increases from ε = 0 to ε = 0.2. The reason
    is that the higher miss-detection probability of SU will cause more collisions
    with PUs. It is obvious that the proposed scheme corresponding to m = 5 performances
    best for the SUs comparing to that of m = 10 and RAND schemes. Besides, in Fig.
    5, the utility values of the SU are all greater than 0 in the proposed scheme
    with m = 5 and m = 10. It shows that, in OSAG, the SUs will always get profit
    in the spectrum access with ε increasing from ε = 0 to ε = 0.2. We can also observe
    from Fig. 5 that uj < 0 when ε > 0.04 in the RAND scheme. It means that without
    a rational spectrum access strategy, the SU will obtain negative profit in the
    spectrum access, and OSAG performances better in the impact of miss-detection
    probability ε. Fig. 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Utility of SU against miss-detection
    probability ε based on inaccurate spectrum state estimation Similarly, Fig. 6
    shows the impact of ω on the utility values of SU j, j ∈ M with α = 0.5, ℘max
    = 20 and ε = 0.05. It is obvious, the proposed model obtains higher utility than
    the RAND scheme. Besides, the utility values of SU are all greater than 0 in the
    proposed model and RAND scheme. It means that the false-alarm probability ω causes
    lower impact than ε in the spectrum access, since the false-alarm of SUs do not
    cause any collision in the primary network. Fig. 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Utility of SU against false-alarm probability ω based on inaccurate spectrum state
    estimation In Fig. 7a, we show the dynamics for the proposed game using the JSFP-based
    channel selection (JCS) algorithm shown in Algorithm 1. As expected, starting
    from a low initial probability of cooperation, the SUs tend to increase the degree
    of cooperation, as a result, the system tends to increase the utility value. Finally,
    the proposed game achieves a pure-strategy NE, which is shown in Fig. 7a. Fig.
    7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Converging process of the a JCS algorithm b
    ELES algorithm c DLES algorithm The converging process of the evolutionary learning
    for achieving ESS in channel selection (ELES) algorithm is shown in Fig. 7b. During
    the iterations, the strategies cause a lower utility value of each SU in (11)
    than the average utility value of the system converges to 0 quickly. While the
    strategies with better influence in the utility value of SUs converge to 1. The
    converging process shows the strategies work better than the average utility will
    be promoted, and the strategies work worse than the average utility of the system
    will be died out during the iterations. In Fig. 7c, we show the dynamics for the
    proposed game using the distributed learning for achieving ESS in channel selection
    (DLES) algorithm shown in Algorithm 3. As expected, starting from different probabilities
    of cooperation, the SUs tend to increase the degree of cooperation, as a result,
    the system tends to increase the utility value. Finally, the proposed game achieves
    a mixed-strategy NE, which is shown in Fig. 7c. The comparison result of the proposed
    scheme based on the accurate spectrum state estimation and inaccurate spectrum
    state estimation is shown in Fig. 8. As shown in Fig. 8, when the false-alarm
    probability increases from ω = 0 to ω = 0.4, the utility values of both cases
    decrease. We can also observe that the proposed scheme with considering the inaccurate
    spectrum state estimation performs much better than that without considering the
    inaccurate spectrum state. It is shown in Fig. 8 that the proposed scheme with
    considering the inaccurate spectrum state estimation performs better when false-alarm
    happens, and the proposed scheme without considering the inaccurate spectrum state
    estimation causes the utility''s reduction quicker than the OSAG-inaccurate scheme.
    Fig. 8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Comparison of the proposed scheme based
    on the accurate spectrum state estimation (OSAG-accurate) and inaccurate spectrum
    state estimation (OSAG-inaccurate) The comparison result of the proposed scheme
    (OSAG) and the RAG [14] is shown in Fig. 9. We denote the false-alarm probability
    as ω = 0.05 and the miss-detection probability as ε = 0.05. As shown in Fig. 9,
    when the number of SUs increases from m = 2 to m = 20, the corresponding aggregate
    throughput value of both schemes decreases. It is also shown in Fig. 9 that the
    proposed scheme performances better than that without considering the inaccurate
    spectrum state in the throughput of system. Fig. 9 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Comparison of the proposed scheme (OSAG) and the RAG 6 Conclusion We proposed
    a potential game theoretic framework for opportunistic spectrum access, and three
    algorithms to learn the equilibria for the proposed game in CRNs. More specifically,
    JCS algorithm was proposed to achieve the pure NE based on accurate spectrum state
    estimation. It was shown that with the JCS algorithm, global optimisation in terms
    of network throughput maximisation and network collision minimisation can be achieved
    with local information. In order to make the outcomes of game robust, we investigated
    evolutionary spectrum access mechanism using the evolutionary game theory with
    complete information based on inaccurate spectrum state estimation, which is denoted
    as ELES algorithm. Finally, without the need of information exchange, we proposed
    a distributed DLES algorithm based on stochastic learning automata to achieve
    the ESS. Simulation results indicate that our scheme improves the network performance
    (high throughput and low collision) and achieves better fairness. 7 Acknowledgment

    SHARE ABSTRACT The expected shortage in spectrum supply is well understood to
    be primarily due to the inefficient, static nature of current spectrum allocation
    policies. In order to address this problem, Federal Communications Commission
    promotes the so called opportunistic spectrum access (OSA) to be applied on cognitive
    radio networks (CRNs). In short, the idea behind OSA is allowing unlicensed users
    to use unused licensed spectra as long as they do not cause interference to licensed
    users. In this paper, we present and evaluate learning schemes that allow unlicensed
    users to locate and use spectrum opportunities effectively, thus improving efficiency
    of CRNs. We separately consider two models: single and multiple unlicensed user(s).
    For the latter model, we present two schemes: noncooperative and cooperative Q-learning.
    All proposed schemes do not require prior knowledge or prediction models of the
    environment''s dynamics and behaviors, yet can still achieve high performance
    by learning from interaction with the environment. Using simulations, we show
    that the proposed schemes achieve good performances in terms of throughput and
    fairness. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. 1 INTRODUCTION Spectrum has
    been traditionally partitioned by Federal Communications Commission (FCC) into
    frequency bands and assigned to licensees, also referred to as primary users (PUs).
    PUs have exclusive and flexible access rights as well as are protected against
    interference when using their assigned bands. The traditional spectrum assignment
    methods are no longer suitable, as there has been an expected shortage in the
    spectrum supply because mainly of the inefficient, static nature of these traditional
    methods, thus calling for new ways that can exploit the available spectrum more
    effectively. This fact is well supported by measurement-based studies 1, 2, which
    show that the average occupancy of spectrum over most frequencies is very low.
    This measurement data confirms the availability of many spectrum opportunities
    along time, frequency, and space that wireless devices and networks can potentially
    utilize. Therefore, it is imperative to develop mechanisms that enable effective
    exploitation of these opportunities. In order to meet the growing demand of spectrum
    resources, FCC''s long-term vision is to evolve towards more liberal, flexible
    spectrum allotment policies and usage rights, where spectrum will be managed and
    controlled dynamically by network entities and end-user devices themselves with
    little to no involvement of any centralized regulatory bodies. As an initial step
    towards this direction, FCC promotes the so called opportunistic spectrum access
    (OSA), which improves spectrum utilization efficiency. The basic idea of OSA is
    to allow unlicensed users, also referred to as secondary users (SUs), to exploit
    the unused licensed spectrum on an instant-by-instant basis but in a manner that
    limits interference to PUs so as to maintain compatibility with legacy systems.
    In this paper, a group of two or more SUs who wish to communicate together is
    referred to as an agent1 . In order to communicate with each other, all SUs in
    the same group must be tuned to the same spectrum band. And prior to using a licensed
    band, SUs must first sense the band to assess whether it is vacant, and if it
    is, then they can switch to and use it as long as no PUs are present. Upon the
    detection of the return of any PUs to their band, SUs must immediately vacate
    the band. Because of its great potentials, OSA has generated significant research
    interests and works, ranging from protocol design 3, 4 to performance optimization
    5, 6 and from market-oriented access strategies 7 to new management and architecture
    paradigms 8, 9. Some research efforts have also been given to the development
    of adaptive approaches that can promote OSA. Most of these proposed approaches
    require and rely on models that can capture and predict the environment''s dynamics
    and behaviors. However, because mainly of its very unique characteristics, it
    is too difficult, if not impossible, to construct models that can predict the
    dynamics of the OSA environment accurately, thus calling for innovative techniques
    that can achieve good performances by learning directly from interaction with
    the environment and without needing models of such environments. Indeed, reinforcement
    learning (RL) is a foundational idea built on the basis of learning from interaction
    without requiring models of the environment''s dynamics 10. In this paper, we
    investigate three learning schemes: (i) Q-learning for single SU; (ii) noncooperative
    Q-learning for multiple SUs; and (iii) cooperative Q-learning for multiple SUs.
    These schemes are RL-based schemes that are well suited for OSA environments,
    allowing SUs to learn by themselves from interaction and use their acquired knowledge
    to locate and find the best spectrum opportunities, thus achieving efficient utilization
    of spectral resources. We evaluate the performance of these proposed schemes and
    compare them with the random access scheme. Simulation results show that partial
    and fully cooperative schemes perform better than the noncooperative and the random
    schemes in terms of achieved throughput and balanced traffic loads. Depending
    on the communication overhead due to the extra traffic incurred when exchanging
    information between the cooperating users, different levels of partial cooperation
    can be used. Overall, the proposed learning techniques achieve high throughput
    performance by learning from interaction the with the environment and intelligently
    locating and exploiting spectrum opportunities. This paper is organized as follows.
    In 2, we present some related works. In 3, we state the problem. In 4, we formulate
    the RL framework and present the proposed learning schemes. 19 evaluates the schemes,
    and 31 concludes this work. 2 RELATED WORK Brik et al.11 proposed a centralized
    protocol for OSA, called dynamic spectrum access protocol (DSAP). DSAP relies
    on a central unit to coordinate and dynamically allocate spectrum resources. DSAP
    architecture consists of clients, a server, and transmitters. Each client senses
    the network to collect information about spectrum usage and sends this information
    to the server via a predefined common control channel. The server uses this information
    to allocate spectrum. Although simple, this model presents scalability, single-point
    failure, and vulnerability issues due to its centralized nature. Raychaudhuri
    et al.12 proposed a spectrum etiquette protocol, called common spectrum coordination
    channel (CCSC), for coordinating network nodes in the unlicensed spectra. Unlike
    DSAP, CCSC is distributed. In CCSC, nodes periodically broadcast spectrum usage
    information on a dedicated channel so as other nodes, monitoring this channel,
    can hear about and learn which channels are available. One issue with CCSC is
    that it does not guarantee, nor does it always result in, the selection of optimal
    channels. There have also been several works that proposed learning-based approaches
    for OSA 13-15. For example, in 13, Fangwen et al. proposed an RL-based approach
    that allows cognitive radios to select frequency bands with the most available
    resources. The detection of spectral resources is formulated as a Markov decision
    process, and a solution strategy based on an actor-critic method is proposed.
    The objective is to minimize the mutual interference between PUs and SUs while
    maximizing the utilization of available resources. This scheme assumes prior knowledge
    of the environment''s dynamics. Unlike these works, our work does not require
    prior knowledge of such dynamics, giving more practical ways of promoting effective
    OSA. 3 PROBLEM STATEMENT Reinforcement learning is the concept of learning from
    past and present to decide what to do best in the future. That is, the learner,
    also referred to as agent, learns from experience by interacting with the environment
    and uses its acquired knowledge to select the action that maximizes a cumulative
    reward. RL is well suited for systems whose behaviors are, by nature, too complex
    to predict, but the reward, or reinforcement, resulting from taking an action
    can easily be assessed or observed. For example, in OSA, although it may be difficult
    to predict which spectrum band will be available in the near future, the reward
    resulting from using a band can easily be determined. The reward can be assessed,
    for example, through amount of obtained throughput, experienced interference,
    packet success rate, and so on. Thus, RL techniques are a natural choice for OSA
    because it is difficult to precisely specify an explicit model of the environment,
    but it is easy to provide a reward function. We assume that all SUs are associated
    with a home spectrum band (HSB) to which they have usage rights at all time. In
    order to communicate with each other, all SUs in the same group must be tuned
    to the same band, being either their HSB or any unused licensed band. Although
    using the HSB, each secondary-user group can opportunistically look for spectrum
    opportunities in another band. This typically happens when, for example, any of
    the SUs judge that the quality of their current band is no longer acceptable.
    This technique can be carried out by simultaneously assessing and monitoring the
    quality of the band using quality metrics, such as signal-to-noise ratio, packet
    success rate, achievable data rate, and so on. The secondary-user group is triggered
    to start seeking for spectrum opportunities whenever the monitored quality no
    longer meets for, for example, a minimum threshold that can be defined a priori.
    Upon the return of any PUs and/or when the quality of the current band drops below
    the threshold, the agent must either return to its HSB or seek for an available
    band. Hereafter, we say that an exploration event is triggered when either (i)
    PUs return back to their licensed band; and/or (ii) the band''s quality is dropped
    below the threshold. In the RL terminology, we therefore consider that the agent
    and environment interact at each of a sequence of discrete time steps, each of
    which takes place at the occurrence of an exploration event. Reinforcement learning
    is typically formalized in the context of Markov Decision Process (MDPs). In general,
    an MDP represents a dynamic system and is specified by giving a finite set of
    states, representing all possible system states, a set of control actions, a transition
    function δ, and a reward function r. The dynamics are Markovian in the sense that
    the probability of being in the next state sj depends only on the current state
    si and action ak but not on any previous history. A policy for an MDP is a mapping
    from states to actions. The objective is then to find a policy that maximizes
    the expected cumulative reward during its execution. In the next section, we first
    formulate OSA as a finite MDP and then describe the Q-learning schemes for OSA.
    4 Q-LEARNING FOR OPPORTUNISTIC SPECTRUM ACCESS In this section, we formulate OSA
    as a finite MDP. An MDP is defined by a state sets , an action set , a transition
    function δ and a reward function r. We first consider OSA systems with single
    SU and then consider systems with multiple SUs. 4.1 Systems with single secondary
    user 4.1.1 State set consists of m + 1 states, where m is the number of bands,
    {s0,s1, … ,sm}, where the system is said to be in state si if the agent is either
    using or sensing band bi at the current time step. The agent cannot use any band
    unless it is free, and the agent cannot know whether the band is free unless it
    senses it. If band bi is not available due to the presence of PUs, the system
    is still considered to be in state si. Note that s0 corresponds to the state when
    the agent is using its HSB b0 which is always available. 4.1.2 Action set has
    m + 1 actions, {a0,a1, … ,am}, where taking action ai always leads to state si.
    At every time step (i.e., an exploration event) while in state si, the agent can
    either choose to exploit by switching back to its HSB b0, or choose to explore
    by searching for new spectrum opportunities. The number of bands that are sensed
    before either finding the first available band or switching back to HSB is referred
    to as the dynamic exploration index, n. The value of this index, which is learned
    and set via the Q-learning, varies over time and depends on current PUs'' load
    and condition. The Q-learning has the ability to adaptively find the optimal index
    n that balances between the desire to keep switching/sensing overhead low and
    the need to maximize the chances of finding spectrum opportunities. 4.1.3 Transition
    function specifies the next state the system enters given the current state sj
    and the action ak to be taken. For any pair (sj,ak), δ(sj,ak) = sk. 4.1.4 Reward
    function specifies the reward r(si,ak,sk) the agent earns when transitioning to
    the next state sk as a result of taking action ak while in state si. Specifically,
    the reward perceived by the agent when entering state sk is a function of the
    quality level the agent receives when using the band it ends up selecting. We
    therefore assume that each band bk is associated with a quality level qk, which
    can be determined via metrics, such as signal-to-noise ratio, packet success rate,
    data rates, and so on. Hereafter, qk will be used to represent the positive reward
    (without including the cost of exploration yet) that band bk offers. Exploration
    also comes with a cost. Recall that SUs are allowed to use any licensed band only
    if the band is vacant, and that discovery of opportunities is carried out through
    spectrum sensing. That is, SUs periodically, or proactively, switch to and sense
    certain bands to find out whether any of them are vacant. However, sensing incurs
    some cost, which is often referred to as sensing overhead. This overhead can be
    of multiple types: energy consumed to perform sensing, delays resulting from switching
    across bands, throughput wasted as a result of ceasing communication, and so on.
    By letting cik denote the cost incurred as a result of exploring band bk while
    in state si, the reward function can be written as 4.1.5 Q-learning The goal of
    the agent is to learn a policy, , for choosing the next action ak based on its
    current state si that produces the greatest possible expected cumulative reward.
    A cumulative reward R is typically defined through a discount factor γ, 0 ≤ γ < 1,
    as . Because it is naturally desirable to receive rewards sooner than later, the
    reward is expressed in a way that future rewards are discounted with respect to
    immediate rewards. The optimal policy is calculated using Q-learning 10. A function,
    , is defined for each state-action (si,ak) pair as the maximum discounted cumulative
    reward that can be achieved when starting from state si and taking action ak according
    to the optimal policy. Thus, given the Q function, it is possible to act optimally
    by selecting actions that maximize Q(si,ak) at each state. Q can be constructed
    recursively as follows. The Q-learning algorithm learns an estimate of the optimal
    Q-function by selecting actions and observing their effects. In particular, each
    step in the environment involves taking an action ak in state si and then observing
    the following state sk and the resulting reward. Given this information, Q is
    updated via the following equation: where αl = 1∕(1 + visitsl(si,ak)) and visitsl(si,ak)
    is the total number of times this state-action pair has been visited up to and
    including the lth iteration. This stochastic approximation algorithm is guaranteed
    to converge to the optimal Q-function in any MDP given the appropriate exploration
    during learning 10. 4.2 Systems with multiple secondary users We now consider
    the case of multiple SUs. We assume there is no HSB. 4.2.1 State set consists
    of one state s only (). 4.2.2 Action set At each time step, the agent chooses
    an action from the action set , where m is the number of bands. The number of
    actions is equal to the number of spectrum bands in the system. Taking action
    ai while using spectrum band bj makes an agent enter and use spectrum band bi.
    4.2.3 Reward function We assume that each band bi has its own bandwidth capacity
    Vi and when more than one SUG use a spectrum band, the bandwidth is equally divided
    among all the SUGs using the band. For example, if there is a total number of
    three SUGs, A, B, and C, each taking action i, j, and k, respectively, then the
    reward of SUG A, denoted by raijk, can be calculated as 4.2.4 Noncooperative Q-learning
    The function Q, as defined in the previous section, can be constructed recursively
    14 as follows. where 0 < α < 1 is the learning rate. When using the noncooperative
    Q-learning scheme, each SUG calculates its Q table independently from other SUGs.
    4.2.5 Action selection The action selection mechanism plays a very important role
    in Q-learning. During the learning process, this selection mechanism is what enables
    the agent to choose its actions. We consider the ε-greedy exploration as the action
    selection mechanism, where the action corresponding to the highest Q value in
    that time step is chosen with a probability of (1 −ε) + ε∕m, and any other action
    from the action set is chosen with a probability of ε∕m. The ε-greedy mechanism
    balances between exploration and exploitation. 4.2.6 Probability vector Based
    on the ε-greedy exploration, we define the probability vector over the action
    set as follows. X = (x1, x2, … ,xm), where xi is the probability of taking action
    i where again m is the number of actions. 4.2.7 Cooperative Q-learning Our multi-agent
    cooperative scheme is based on the multi-agent Q-learning approach derived in
    16. To illustrate, suppose that SUG A with probability vector X is going to cooperate
    with two other SUGs, B and C, with probability vectors Y and Z, respectively.
    The Q table entry for SUG A choosing action i can be calculated as 16 Similarly,
    each SUG can compute its Q table values based on the probability vectors of the
    other SUGs. 5 EVALUATION We now evaluate the performance of the proposed schemes.
    We first show the results for the single SU model and then for the multiple SUs
    models. 5.1 Single secondary user We study the single-user Q-learning by evaluating
    and comparing its performance to a random access model. This model will be used
    here as a baseline for comparison and is defined as follows. Whenever an exploration
    event is triggered, the SUG, using the random access model, selects a spectrum
    band among all bands randomly. If the selected band is idle, then the group uses
    it until the return of any PUs associated with this band. Otherwise, that is,
    if the selected band happens to be busy, then the group goes back to its home
    band. This process repeats until an idle band is found. 5.1.1 Environment setup
    We assume that the spectrum is divided into m nonoverlapping bands and that each
    band is associated with a set of PUs. PUs'' traffic in the spectrum band is mimicked
    by considering ON and OFF alternating periods. ON periods denote that PUs are
    present, whereas OFF periods denote their absence. ON and OFF periods on the ith
    band are taken from the exponential distribution with rates λi and μi. The PU
    traffic load ηi of the ith band is then expressed as μi∕(μi + λi). The exponential
    distributions will be used in this work to generate samples to be able to evaluate
    our learning scheme. Recall that the power of RL lies in its capability to converge
    to approximately optimal behavior without needing prior knowledge of PUs'' traffic
    behavior. Throughout, we characterize PUs traffic activities by the average, and
    the coefficient of variation, , of PUs traffic loads across all bands, where σ
    denotes the standard deviation of these traffic loads. 5.1.2 Effect of the average
    of primary users traffic load We begin by studying the effect of the average of
    PUs traffic load on the achievable throughput. Figure 1 plots the total throughput,
    normalized with respect to the maximal achievable throughput, that the SUG achieves
    as a result of using single-user Q-learning (Q-OSA in the figures) and the random
    access for two different PUs traffic loads: = 0.5 and . The measured throughput
    is based on what the SUG receives from the m licensed bands only; that is, not
    counting for the HSB. In this simulation scenario, CoV is set to 0.1443, and the
    total number of bands m is set to 10. Figure 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Throughput behavior under two different primary users traffic loads, and 0.8,
    for m = 10 and CoV = 0.1. First, note that as expected, the higher the , the lesser
    the achievable throughput under both schemes. However, regardless of the PUs traffic
    load, Q-learning always outperforms the random scheme. Also, note that the more
    loaded the system is, the higher the difference between the throughput achievable
    under Q-learning and that achievable under random access (e.g., gain is higher
    when ). To further illustrate the effect of on the performance of single-user
    Q-learning, we plot in Figure 2 the throughput gain (single-user Q-learning w.r.t.
    to random access) as a function of . Note that the gain increases as the PUs traffic
    load increases. In other words, the Q-learning performs even better under heavy
    loaded systems. Note that the gain can be as high as 80% when . When is high,
    that is, when spectrum opportunities are scarce, the learning capability of Q-learning
    allows the agent to efficiently locate where the opportunities are, whereas random
    access leads to less throughput because it is accessing bands randomly. When is
    small, on the other hand, the random access scheme is able to achieve high throughput
    because spectrum opportunities are too many to miss even when bands are selected
    unintelligently. Observe that not only Q-learning outperforms the random access
    (which is expected), but also achieves close-optimal throughput; Figure 1 shows
    that the normalized throughput can be as high as 90%, meaning that Q-learning
    can achieve up to 90% of that achievable under an ideal scheme. Figure 2 Open
    in figure viewer PowerPoint Throughput gain as a function of primary users average
    loads for m = 10 and CoV = 0.1443. In Figure 3, we show the dynamic index n behavior
    for different values of (pbar in the figure) under Q-learning. Recall that this
    index denotes the number of bands that are sensed before either finding the first
    available band or switching back to HSB. Clearly, Figure 3 shows that the agent
    is almost always able to find an available band from the first (n = 1) attempt;
    regardless of PUs loads, more than 75% of the time, the agent finds an available
    band in its first attempt. Thus, the learning capability of Q-learning allows
    the agent to quickly locate available bands. Figure 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Dynamic index behavior for different value of primary users average loads: CoV = 0.1443,
    m = 10. To summarize, these obtained results show that the proposed Q-learning
    is capable of achieving between 80% and 95% of the maximal achievable throughput.
    Also, more than 75% of the time, Q-learning hits the available band from the first
    attempt. Results also show that Q-learning achieves high throughput performance
    even under heavy PUs traffic loads. 5.1.3 Effect of the variation of primary users
    traffic load Figure 4 plots the total throughput that the SUG achieves under Q-learning
    and the random access for two different PUs load variations: CoV = 0 and CoV = 0.144.
    Note that when CoV = 0.144, Q-learning outperforms the random scheme by simply
    locating and exploiting unused opportunities through learning. As expected, the
    throughput gain increases with the variation. As shown in Figure 4, the gain is
    higher when CoV = 0.144 than when CoV = 0. To further illustrate the effect of
    PUs load variability on throughput, we show in Figure 5 the throughput gain for
    different values of CoV . Figure 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Achievable
    throughput under single-user Q-learning and random access schemes , m = 10. Figure
    5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Throughput gain as a function of primary users
    load variability: , m = 10. The average PUs traffic load, , is set to 0.6 (i.e.,
    only 40% of the spectrum is available). Observe that the higher the variation
    of PUs loads across different bands, the higher the throughput gain; that is,
    the higher the throughput the agent/group can achieve when compared with that
    achievable under the random access scheme. This can be explained as follows. When
    the average of PUs traffic loads is kept the same, a high variation in the loads
    across different bands increases the likelihood of finding highly available spectrum
    bands. This, on the other hand, also increases the likelihood of finding spectrum
    bands with fewer opportunities. With experience, Q-learning learns about, and
    starts exploiting, these more available bands, yielding then more throughputs.
    When the load variation is low, on the other hand, Q-learning achieves lesser
    throughput because all bands are almost equally loaded, and hence, there is no
    special (i.e., more available) bands that the agent can learn about. To further
    illustrate this effect, we show the dynamic index n behavior in Figure 6 under
    different values of CoV . As expected, the lower the CoV , the greater the number
    of bands to be sensed before finding an available band. When CoV = 0, Q-learning
    does not find an available band as fast as when CoV = 0.35. Figure 6 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint Dynamic index behavior for different values of primary users
    load variability: , m = 10 5.2 Multiple secondary users We consider multiple SUs
    and show the importance of multi-agent cooperation by comparing the per SUG average
    received throughput of the cooperative scheme with that of a noncooperative one.
    Specifically, we study the effect that cooperation has on network load balancing
    by allowing SUGs to make better action decision, leading to more effective exploitation
    of bandwidth opportunities. This also ensures fairness among SUGs by making sure
    that all SUGs receive (approximately) equal throughput shares. 5.2.1 Simulated
    access schemes We consider that the spectrum is divided into m nonoverlapping
    spectrum bands with n SUGs (unlike the previous sections, hereafter, n represents
    the number of SUGs). We mimic the presence of PUs by considering different spectrum
    bands with different bandwidth capacities. Let Vj denote the bandwidth capacity
    of band j. A spectrum band with a higher bandwidth capacity is meant to have a
    lower PU activity and vice versa. We consider a time-slotted system, and assume
    that SUGs interact with the environment in accordance with these time slots. That
    is, SUGs can only enter or leave a band at the beginning and at the end of these
    time steps. We now summarize the three access schemes that are evaluated in this
    subsection. 5.2.2 Random access scheme At the end of each time slot/step, an SUG
    using the random access scheme selects a spectrum band among the m available bands
    randomly and uses it during the next time slot. If more than one SUG happen to
    select the same spectrum band, they share the bandwidth of the band equally. 5.2.3
    Noncooperative access scheme In the noncooperative access scheme, each SUG uses
    the noncooperative Q-learning policy discussed in 10 to create and update its
    own Q table. Each SUG enters the environment and takes actions based on its own
    Q table without cooperating with any of the other SUGs. When two or more SUGs
    choose the same band during the same time step, they share its bandwidth equally.
    Although the SUGs are typically unaware of the other agent''s actions and act
    independently, the effect of the other SUG''s actions are reflected in the reward
    that the SUGs receive from the spectrum band. 5.2.4 Cooperative access scheme
    In the cooperative access scheme, each SUG maintains its own Q table using the
    cooperative Q-learning discussed in 10. Here, an agent''s Q table is formulated
    by taking into account the probabilities associated with the actions of the other
    SUGs with which it cooperates. In this case, at each time step, the SUG is provided
    with the probability vector of every other SUG with which it cooperates. The trade-off
    here is between the communication overhead caused by extra traffic needed for
    exchanging the probability vectors among the cooperating SUGs and the performance
    gains due to improved action selections because of cooperation. 5.2.5 Cooperation
    versus noncooperation First, we consider an OSA system with m = 3 spectrum bands
    and n = 6 SUGs. Bandwidth capacities are set to Vj = [5 10 15]. In this scenario,
    an ideal balanced spectrum load is reached when each of the SUGs gets a reward
    of 5 units, which implies that the 1st band has 1 SUG, the 2nd has 2 SUGs, and
    the 3rd band has 3 SUGs. We simulate the three different access schemes for this
    scenario and plot the average number of SUGs (averaged over 10,000 episodes) in
    each of the three spectrum bands (i.e., the distribution of SUGs) in Figure 7.
    Figure 7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Secondary user group distribution: m = 3,
    n = 6, Vj = [5 10 15]. The figure shows the average number of SUGs that end up
    choosing each of the three spectrum bands for each of the three studied schemes.
    It can be observed that the fully cooperative access scheme leads to the ideal
    balanced system load. As explained earlier, this is because in the fully cooperative
    method, each SUG accounts for all the possible actions that could be taken by
    its counterparts when making a decision. On the other hand, when SUGs do not cooperate,
    they may not select the best available band, as they have no clue what other SUGs
    will select, leading to a lesser balanced load distribution when compared with
    that of the cooperative scheme. Clearly and as expected, the random access scheme
    results in an equally distributed SUGs among all bands, leading to the worst load
    balance when compared with the other two schemes 2. Fairness is another important
    metric that we also evaluate in this work. To do this, we plot in Figure 8 the
    CoV of the received rewards of all the SUGs as a function of time period (each
    time period corresponds to 500 epochs). Observe that the fully cooperative access
    scheme has the lowest CoV among the three schemes. The lower the CoV is, the closer
    the SUGs'' received rewards are to one another, indicating a fairer access scheme.
    It can also be seen that the CoV of the noncooperative access scheme is approximately
    twice that of the fully cooperative access scheme, and the CoV of the random access
    scheme is substantially higher than the other two. Therefore, cooperation improves
    performances not only in terms of network load balancing, but also in terms of
    ensuring fairness among all SUGs. Figure 8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Coefficient
    of variation of the rewards of all the secondary user groups at each time period:
    m = 3, n = 6, Vj = [5 10 15]. 5.2.6 Impact of degree of cooperation Recall that
    cooperation increases the performance because it allows the SUGs to make a better
    decision when selecting their next actions. This is because the SUGs take into
    account what other SUGs will select when making their action decisions. However,
    acquiring such information would necessitate the exchange of messages among cooperative
    SUGs, which clearly incurs extra overhead. Therefore, the challenge is to strike
    a good balance between the desire for a higher level of cooperation that enables
    a better action selection and the need for a lower level of cooperation so as
    to keep the cooperation overhead to a minimum. Cooperation overhead comes from
    the extra traffic needed to exchange the probability vectors and also from the
    computing delay/time resulting from solving the complex equations involved in
    updating the Q table entries of the cooperative SUGs. We now study the impact
    of degree of cooperation on the achievable performances of an OSA system with
    m = 3 spectrum bands and n = 12 SUGs. The bandwidth capacities of the spectrum
    bands are set to Vj = [10 20 30]. In this scenario, an ideal balanced load is
    reached when each of the SUGs earns a reward of 5 units corresponding to when
    the 1st band houses 2 SUGs, the 2nd band houses 4 SUGs, and the 3rd band houses
    6 SUGs. For this simulation scenario, we evaluate and compare the performances
    of the cooperative access scheme by considering three degrees of cooperation:
    2 (i.e, each SUG cooperates with 2 other SUGs), 4 (i.e, each SUG cooperates with
    4 other SUGs), and 6 (i.e, each SUG cooperates with 6 other SUGs). Figure 9 shows
    the average number of SUGs that end up choosing each of the three spectrum bands
    for the random, noncooperative, and cooperative access schemes with 2, 4, and
    6 degree of cooperation. Note that as the degree of cooperation increases, the
    system load becomes more balanced. That is, the cooperative access scheme with
    degree of cooperation equal to 6 leads to a better balanced system load when compared
    with the other two degrees. Figure 9 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Secondary
    user groups distribution: m = 3, n = 12, Vj = [10 20 30]. We also study fairness
    achieved under each of the three cooperation degrees and plot the CoV of the received
    rewards of the SUGs in Figure 10. Observe that cooperation with a degree of 6
    has the lowest CoV , followed by a degree of 4, and then followed by a degree
    of 2. This indicates that a higher degree of cooperation leads to a lower CoV
    , meaning that SUGs receive closer amounts of rewards, thus ensuring fairness
    among SUGs. Therefore, cooperation improves performances not only in terms of
    network load balancing, but also in terms of ensuring fairness among all SUGs.
    Note that each of the three degrees of cooperation has a lower CoV when compared
    with the noncooperative and random access schemes. Figure 10 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint Coefficient of variation of the rewards of all the secondary user groups
    at each time period: m = 3, n = 12, Vj = [10 20 30]. It is important to mention
    again that although higher degree of cooperation results in improved action selection
    decisions, it also incurs more communication overhead and execution times. Therefore,
    one must choose the degree of cooperation that balances between good selection
    decision and minimum overhead so as to lead to an increased overall system performance.
    6 CONCLUSION In this paper, we developed an RL-based framework for DSA system
    with multiple SUs. We evaluated and compared two multi-agent Q-learning algorithms,
    namely the noncooperative and cooperative Q-learning schemes along with the random
    scheme. Simulation results showed that partial and fully cooperative access schemes
    perform better than the noncooperative and random access schemes in terms of achieving
    a higher throughput and a better balanced traffic loads. We also showed that cooperation
    improves performances not only in terms of network load balancing, but also in
    terms of ensuring fairness among all users. 1 Throughout this work, agents will
    also be referred to as secondary user groups (SUGs); the terms agent and SUG will
    then be used interchangeably. 2 We want to mention that these aforementioned results
    do not account for the communication overhead caused by message exchange needed
    to share the probability vectors among cooperative SUGs. Biographies Omar Alsaleh

    Abstract Cognitive radio (CR) is a form of wireless communication, that provides
    solution for the spectrum underutilization problems via dynamic spectrum sharing
    among primary users and secondary users. In cognitive radio network, interference
    and power consumption must be carefully controlled to maximize the channel usage.
    Game theory has emerged in the last fifteen years as an effective framework for
    communications problems, which is used to analyze those problems and help to derive
    solutions. In this paper, we propose a sufficiently opportunistic utilization
    for spectrum resources by solving two challenges: interference and power consumption.
    We analyze the spectrum allocation problem under game theoretical framework and
    we propose an efficient algorithm to examine the design specification issues regarding
    the choice of optimal power, optimal speed, and optimal amount of information
    in a wireless network. Our objectives are to regulate the opportunistic spectrum
    access, by the secondary users in order to guarantee the protection on licensed
    users from harmful interference. More especially, to optimize the quality of communication
    link, transmission levels, and battery life of the wireless devices. Access provided

    Over the last few years, the wireless spectrum resources have gradually decreased,
    because of the constant emergence of a variety of new wireless communications
    technologies. Especially, with the continued growth of cities, many initiatives
    for Smart Cities are being realized. A smart city is an urban area where different
    types of wireless technologies, such as WiFi, ZigBee, Bluetooth, WiMax, 4G or
    LTE, are employed to collect data. After that, these data are used to improve
    the living conditions and offer better public safety and security. This leads
    to different communication needs in the Smart City. The spectrum scarcity is mainly
    due to the legacy command and control regulation rather than due to physical scarcity
    of spectrum. The traditional way of managing the electromagnetic spectrum is a
    static spectrum access, in which wireless spectrum resource is allocated to different
    wireless communication system by the spectrum authorities of each country [1].
    Consequently, it is very difficult to allocate new frequencies for the new smart
    city applications, even if the authorized user (Primary user ‘PU’) in a certain
    place and a certain time without using its authorized spectrum. Other unauthorized
    users (secondary user ‘SU’) can’t use the frequency spectrum resource, which leads
    to the waste of time and space and the low spectrum utilization rate. The situation
    doesn’t adapt to the rapid development of wireless communication. The wireless
    communication implementation creates many challenges. The first challenge is how
    to allocate the full range of the radio spectrum, which is very congested and
    subject to interference. The second challenge of wireless communication is the
    power consumption. In order to solve the scarcity problem of spectrum resources,
    the idea for CR was developed by Joseph Mitola [2] at the Defense Advanced Research
    Projects Agency (DARPA) in the United States. Cognitive radio is an intelligent
    wireless communication system, which is able to sense, detect, and monitor the
    surrounding radio frequency environment. Then based on the assessment along with
    the location information and certain particular operating rule, the cognitive
    radio solves the problem of spectrum scarcity and realizes spectrum sharing and
    dynamic spectrum allocation by the spectrum sensing and intelligent learning ability
    of the system. The Cognitive radio is considered as an efficient technology that
    optimizes the use of available radio-frequency spectrum while minimizing interference
    to other users. and the same can be used for realization of smart cities. In our
    previous work [3, 5], we have proposed a low cost and low power consumption spectrum
    sensing implementation, by using real signals. Therefore, we assume that the search
    and detection of vacancies within the licensed spectrum is already carried. In
    this work, the secondary users will compete to share the spectrum frequency (white
    space) with the primary user. Spectrum administration bodies Federal Communications
    Commission (FCC) of U.S. and Electronic Communications Committee (ECC) in Europe
    have announced rules on the transmission power of white space for secondary users
    in US and Europe respectively [6, 7]. FCC adopts a minimum distance between SU
    and PU service area to guarantee that an interference margin is not exceeded by
    secondary users. ECC’s restriction requires that the SU adapts its transmission
    power in order to not violate the interference margin. In this manner, secondary
    systems have to determine their optimal transmission power. The design of a smart
    city network using the CR technology will provide a flexibility as the CR focuses
    on dynamic spectrum allocation and proposes the possibility to interconnect existing
    wireless technologies. At present, the cognitive radio spectrum allocation model
    mainly has six kinds [8]: graph theory, the interference temperature, price auction,
    Partially Observable Markov Decision Process, and the game theory. The game process
    of selecting spectrum strategy between different users is similar to the problem
    of spectrum allocation in cognitive radio. Therefore, the introduction of game
    theory (GT) into cognitive radio can effectively analyze the problem of spectrum
    allocation. Cognitive radio can solve many problems that is present in everyday
    life, especially, in cities with various applications such as mobile phone, personal
    digital assistants, garage door openers, wireless computer mice, keyboards and
    headsets, headphones, radio receivers, satellite television, and broadcast television.
    In this paper, we propose a game-theoretic channel allocation in which we consider
    a general wireless network specification, and we study the non-cooperative scenario
    in the wireless network. The main objectives are to regulate the access of spectrum
    by secondary users in order to guarantee the protection of the primary users from
    harmful interference. Therefore, to realize an optimal channel organization, the
    game theory algorithm is used to maximize power efficiency of each network users
    by choosing optimal power, optimal speed, and optimal amount of information. The
    rest of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents a review of existing
    works on this issue. We then introduce the proposed system model wireless networks
    in Sect. 3. Section 4 describes our proposed game model for channel utilization.
    Section 5 evaluates the results of the proposed work. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes
    the paper. 2 Related Work The concepts of game theory (GT) are a branch of mathematics,
    widely used in the economics areas, political science, psychology, evolutionary
    biology and other social and behavioral sciences, which has emerged in the last
    fifteen years as an effective framework for communications, networking, and signal
    processing. GT can effectively analyze the problem of spectrum allocation. Many
    researchers use game theory in the adoption of a cognitive radio strategy to the
    coexistence problem. In [8] the authors proposed a novel spectrum allocation sharing
    algorithm based on improved interference coordination, the experiment results
    indicate that the proposed algorithm could converge to Nash equilibrium in a short
    time, and the total interference of the system is reduced to minimal and the throughput
    of the user could reach the maximum. Reference [9] applied Shapley value algorithm
    for dynamic network where both authorized and unauthorized users can utilize the
    radio frequency at the same time with maximum throughput without interfering the
    authorized users. Reference [10] proposed a Dynamic Chinese Restaurant Game to
    study how a user in a dynamic social network learns the uncertain network state
    and introduced a Bayesian learning based method for users to learn the network
    state, and proposed a Multi-dimensional Markov Decision Process based approach
    for users to achieve the optimal decisions. Finally, applied the Dynamic Chinese
    Restaurant Game to cognitive radio networks. Reference [11] used a transferable
    utility cooperative game to propose a novel framework for normative modeling of
    the spectrum sensing and sharing problem in cognitive radios (CRs). Reference
    [12] widely explored the cognitive radio spectrum allocation models based on game
    theory from cooperative game and non-cooperative game, and analyzed the state
    of the art of spectrum allocation based on game theory. Finally, this paper provided
    the general framework model based on game theory for cognitive radio spectrum
    allocation. 3 System Model A wireless network is a collection of senders, receivers,
    and channels. Let us assume that there are N senders and N receivers. Each sender
    has one targeted receiver that forms a (sender, receiver) pair those N (sender,
    receiver) pairs of secondary sender and receiver are distributed evenly in a cognitive
    radio network area. Figure 1 presents the model of cognitive radio networks used
    in this work, we consider the case when the network consists of two (sender, receiver)
    pairs. In this considered example the two transmitters interfere with each other
    in the challenge to reach their own receiver. Our proposed system covers many
    scenarios, it can be used to model: a cognitive radio system in which the two
    senders are PU and SU, a multicellular system, a device-to-device system. Fig.
    1. (Sender, receiver) pairs interactions. Full size image Each sender aims to
    choose the optimal power, optimal speed and optimal amount of information. The
    transmitted information by each sender is divided into packets. There are M bits
    per packet. When a sender i transmits information, the signal that carries this
    information is distorted by the medium noise and by the signals of the other senders
    j. Therefore, the Information can be delivered with mistakes because of the existence
    of noise and interference. Senders are interested in data exchange with their
    associated receivers by a good quality of services (QoS). In practice, successful
    reception of a signal depends on the important characteristic of the sender, which
    is the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR), The SINR model for sender
    i is modeled as follows: $${\gamma _i}\left( \rho \right) = \frac{{{\rho _i}{G_{ii}}}}{{{N_c}
    + \mathop \sum \nolimits_{j\# i} {I_{\{ {d_{ij}} < d\} }}{\rho _j}{G_{ij}}}} $$
    (1) \( \rho_{i} \): the power to noise ratio is denoted: \( \rho_{i} = \frac{{\rm{p}_{i}
    }}{{n_{0} }} \) \( \text{p}_{i} \): the transmit power of the sender i, measured
    in Watt, [W]. \( n_{\text{0}} \): the power of the additive white Gaussian noise
    (AWGN), and assumes that all links receive the same noise power, measured in Watt
    [W]. \( G_{ij} \): represents the channel gain of the sender i sent to the receiver
    j. Its calculation formula is \( G_{ij} = \rm{1}/d_{ij}^{\alpha } \). \( d_{ij}
    \): the relative distance between receiver i and sender j (see Fig. 1). \( \alpha
    \): the path-loss exponent between the (sender, receiver) pair i. Varies between
    2 for free space to 6 for obstructed in building propagation [13]. \( I\{ d_{ij}
    < d\} \): is the interference function. That is, we assume that sender j interferes
    receiver i if the distance between them is smaller than d. Where: $$ I = \left\{
    {\begin{array}{*{20}l} {\text{1}{\mathbf{ }}} \hfill & {{\text{if}}\,{\text{the}}\,{\text{condition}}\,d_{{\varvec{i}j}}
    \, < \,d\,{\text{is}}\,\,{\rm{satisfied}}} \hfill \\ \text{0} \hfill & {otherwise
    } \hfill \\ \end{array} } \right. $$ \( N_{c} \) takes one of two values: 1 if
    the data rate equals to 1 Mbps (Megabits per second); 2 if the data rate equals
    2 Mbps. Successful transmission of a signal depends on the signal-to-interference-plus-noise
    ratio (SINR). If the SINR is low the information can be delivered with mistakes.
    Thus, we can consider set of SINRs of each (sender, receiver) pair as a model
    for their interactions. To illustrate the effect of the distance \( d_{ij} \)
    to the interference, the SINR is plotted with respect of the distance \( d_{ij}
    \) between (sender, receiver) pairs. We fix the transmit power of sender i and
    j, and calculate the SINR interference level for two different value 1 Mbps and
    2 Mbps (where \( N_{c} = \text{1} \) and \( N_{c} = \text{2} \) respectively),
    by using (2). The results are illustrated in Fig. 2. Fig. 2. SINR as a function
    of relative distance \( d_{ij} \). Full size image From this figure we can see
    that the SINR increases with the distance \( d_{ij} \). But the increasing of
    the distance does not achieve an optimal channel organization. However, achieving
    a high SINR level often requires the (sender, receiver) pair to transmit at a
    high power, which in turn results in a high-power consumption and decreases the
    SINR of the other pairs. Therefore, the other pairs would increase their power
    levels too. Senders do not want to waste power; they want to be as efficient as
    possible in the transmission of information. The efficiency of each sender is
    determined by a utility function, which is the ratio of its throughput to its
    transmit power. Efficiency is measured in terms of bits that can be transmitted
    per joule of energy consumed. It leads to the model of efficiency described in
    (2), It is clear that a higher efficiency level output of the receiver will result
    in a lower used power and hence higher throughput. $$ u_{i} \left( {p,M,R} \right)
    = \frac{{T_{i} \left( {p,M,R} \right)}}{{\rm{p}_{i} }} ,\quad \quad \quad \left[
    {bit/Joule} \right] $$ (2) In this formula, \( M = \left( {M_{1} , \ldots , M_{n}
    } \right) \) is the vector containing the (sender, receiver) pair packet sizes,
    \( R = \left( {R_{1} , \ldots , R_{n} } \right) \) is the vector containing the
    (sender, receiver) pairs data rates, and \( T_{i} \left( {p,M,R} \right) \) is
    the throughput, which is the expected number of information bits that are transmitted
    correctly per unit time. The throughput is modeled as follows: $$ T_{i} \left(
    {p,M,R} \right) = I_{i} \left( {p_{i} ,M_{i} ,R_{i} } \right)H\left( {\gamma_{i}
    \left( p \right)} \right) , \quad \left[ {bps} \right] $$ (3) Where, \( I_{\varvec{i}}
    \left( {p,M,R} \right) \) is the average data rate for the pair i, it is measured
    in bits per second [bps]. The relation between the average data rate Ii, the data
    rate Ri, and the packet size Mi is as follows: $$ I_{i} \left( {p,M,R} \right)
    = \frac{{R_{i} }}{{1 + \frac{{R_{i} }}{{M_{i} }}t_{interval} }} $$ (4) where,
    \( t_{interval} \) is the time needed to send two packets on the same data channel.
    \( H\left( {\gamma_{i} \left( p \right)} \right) = \left( {1 - e^{{ - \gamma_{\varvec{i}}
    \left( p \right)}} } \right)^{{M_{i} }} \) is the probability that the packet
    is sent without an error. In Table 1, we provide the values of the two data rates
    and the values of the three packet sizes that are used in our applications. The
    throughput function takes one of six shapes depending on the combinations of the
    data rate and the packet size. Table 1. The used values of the data rates and
    the values of the three packet sizes Full size table Figure 3 represents the shapes
    of the throughput function with respect to the dimensionless power \( \rho \)
    on a dB scale. The used network consists of two (sender, receiver) pairs with
    α = 1, \( d_{ii} = \text{0}\rm{.2} \), \( d_{ij} = \text{3} \). Figure 3 shows
    the highest throughput that can be achieved by each (data rate, packet size) combination.
    Fig. 3. Throughput as a function of power to noise ratio. Full size image We normalize
    the efficiency function in the same manner as in [14]. We divide the efficiency
    function \( u_{i} \left( {p_{i} } \right) \) by the maximum average data rate
    Imax and multiply by the noise N. Thus, the normalized utility function is expressed
    as follows: $$ \tilde{u}\left( {\rho ,M,R} \right) = \frac{{I_{i} \left( {M_{i}
    ,R_{i} } \right) . \left( {1 - e^{{ - \gamma_{i} \left( p \right)}} } \right)^{{M_{i}
    }} }}{{ I_{max} . \rho_{i} }} $$ (5) Similarly, to the throughput function, the
    normalized efficiency function has four shapes shown in Fig. 4. The main objective
    is to find the optimal power, optimal data rate, and optimal packet size such
    that the efficiency function is maximized. Fig. 4. Normalized efficiency function.

    Game theory (GT) is a branch of mathematics traditionally studied and applied
    in the areas of economics, political science, and biology, which has emerged in
    the last fifteen years as an effective framework for communications, networking,
    and signal processing. The game process of selecting spectrum strategy between
    different users is similar to the situation where each (sender, receiver) pair
    wants to be as efficient as possible. So, a game theoretic approach is used to
    find the power level, the data rate and, the packet size that is used to maximize
    the efficiency. To take advantage of GT and its associated theoretical tools,
    the first step is to model the problem at hand as a game. In doing so, three ingredients
    must be identified: Players that represent the main actors in the problem, having
    conflicting interests and affecting the performance of everyone else in the game;
    A set of strategies available to each player, that determines what each player
    can do; A utility function for each player, that measures its degree of satisfaction
    as a function of the combination of all player’s choices. Using each (sender,
    receiver) pair as a participant (players) in the game process, the user’s choice
    of the power level, the data rate and the packet size (set of strategies) that
    is used to maximize the efficiency function (utility function). Each (sender,
    receiver) pair seeks to choose its transmit power, the data rate and the packet
    size in order to maximize its utility function by best response and the Nash equilibrium
    (NE). The game mathematical model of the spectrum allocation problem (interference
    and power consumption) can be expressed as: $$ G = \left\{ {N,\left\{ {S_{i} }
    \right\}_{i \in N} ,\left\{ {U_{i} } \right\}_{i \in N} } \right\} $$ (6) N is
    a limited set of (sender, receiver) pair i. \( \left\{ {S_{i} } \right\}_{i \in
    N} \) the choice of the power level \( \rho_{i} \), the data rate \( R_{i} \)
    and the packet size \( M_{i} \) (set of strategies) by the pair i, where \( S_{i}
    = \left\{ {\rho_{i} ,R_{i} ,M_{i} } \right\} \). \( U_{i} \) represents the utility
    function which is a function of the \( S_{i} \). The strategy chosen by the player
    i and the current strategy of the other players \( S_{ - i} \). In our work, the
    utility function is the normalized power efficiencies \( \tilde{u}\left( {\rho
    ,M,R} \right) \) represented in (5). To illustrate the strategic interaction of
    players in this paper, we first present Nash Equilibrium. Nash Equilibrium introduced
    by the mathematician John Forbes Nash Jr. [15], is a concept of game theory where
    the optimal outcome of a game is one where no player has any incentive to modify
    his strategy individually to increase his gain. (sender, receiver) pairs can reach
    the equilibrium point when it takes the best response. More specifically, when
    it takes the best power level \( \rho^{ *} = \left( {\rho_{1}^{ *} ,\rho_{2}^{
    *} , \ldots ,\rho_{N}^{ *} } \right) \), the best data rate \( R^{ *} = \left(
    {R_{1}^{ *} ,R_{2}^{ *} , \ldots ,R_{N}^{ *} } \right) \) and the best packet
    size \( M^{ *} = \left( {M_{1}^{ *} ,M_{2}^{ *} , \ldots ,M_{N}^{ *} } \right)
    \), that are used to maximize the efficiency function. The best-response strategies
    and the Nash equilibrium solutions for interference and power control can be reached
    when we arrive to the following condition: $$ \tilde{u}_{i} \left( {\rho^{*} ,M^{*}
    ,R^{*} } \right)\, \ge \,\tilde{u}_{i} \left( {\rho_{ - i}^{*} ,M_{ - i}^{*} ,R_{
    - i}^{*} } \right) $$ (7) From the expression (5), we can see that the efficiency
    function \( \tilde{u}\left( {\rho ,M,R} \right) \) in addition to the power level
    \( \rho_{i} \), the data rate \( R_{i} \) and the packet size \( M_{i} \), it
    depends on the location of the network users, more specifically, the distance
    between the pairs \( d_{ij} \), the distance between (sender, receiver) pair \(
    d_{ii} \) and finally the path-loss exponent \( \alpha \). Therefore, in this
    work, we study the influence of this parameters on the NE of a static non-cooperative
    complete information game algorithm. 4.2 Algorithm Implementation In this part,
    we present the principles of our proposed game algorithm which is in a strategic
    form, and we have to solve it to determine the optimal power level, the optimal
    data rate, and the optimal packet size sets, with a view to maximize the efficiency
    function. There are two scenarios for a wireless network: non-cooperative scenario
    and cooperative scenario. The most studied scenario in literature is the non-cooperative
    scenario due to its optimal results compared to the cooperative scenario. Consequently,
    in this paper, we consider only the scenario for a static non-cooperation wireless
    network, and we propose a solution approach based on a mathematical programming
    formulation to find the Nash equilibrium (NE). As game conditions, for the both
    scenarios, we assume that players: (1) know each other’s payoff which means that
    complete information is available, and that means that every player knows all
    the strategy sets and payoff functions, (2) choose their strategy simultaneously,
    and (3) are rational which means that each player is a utility-maximizer decision
    maker. 4.3 Static Non-cooperative Game In the wireless network, each (sender,
    receiver) pair aims at maximizing its efficiency function individually. Under
    the assumption of non-cooperation between the players, and the previous assumptions,
    player can reach the equilibrium point when it takes the best response. The concept
    of best response strategy in a static non-cooperative game is mathematically defined
    as: $$ S_{i}^{*} = \mathop {arg\,max}\nolimits_{{\rho_{i} ,R_{i} ,M_{i} }} \tilde{u}\left(
    {\rho_{i} ,R_{i} ,M_{i} } \right) $$ (8) $$ S_{i}^{*} = \mathop {arg\,max}\nolimits_{{\rho_{i}
    ,R_{i} ,M_{i} }} \frac{{I_{i} \left( {M_{i} ,R_{i} } \right) . \left( {1 - e^{{
    - \gamma_{\varvec{i}} \left( p \right)}} } \right)^{{M_{i} }} }}{{ I_{max} . \rho_{i}
    }} $$ (9) The implementation steps of the proposed non-cooperative algorithm are
    as follow: Step 1: choose the number of players N and initialization of the possible
    game strategies, especially the data rate \( R_{i} \) and the packet size \( M_{i}
    \). Step 2: Power initialization: each player chooses an initial power to noise
    ratio \( \left\{ {\rho_{1}^{0} ,\rho_{2}^{0} , \ldots ,\rho_{N}^{0} } \right\}
    \). Step 3: Iterative process until the NE state is reached. Each player turns
    the selection strategy in turn to achieve his optimal power level \( \rho^{ *}
    = \left( {\rho_{\rm{1}}^{ *} ,\rho_{\text{2}}^{ *} , \ldots ,\rho_{N}^{ *} } \right)
    \), optimal data rate \( R^{ *} = \left( {R_{\text{1}}^{ *} ,R_{\rm{2}}^{ *} ,
    \ldots ,R_{N}^{ *} } \right) \) and optimal packet size \( M^{ *} = \left( {M_{\text{1}}^{
    *} ,M_{\text{2}}^{ *} , \ldots ,M_{N}^{ *} } \right) \) that can determines the
    best response strategy based on (8). Step 4: Finally, the received \( \rho^{ *}
    \), \( R^{ *} \) and \( M^{ *} \) are used to calculate the interference SINR
    value, the throughput of the channel and the optimum values of the normalize the
    efficiency function (Figs. 5, 6, 7 and 8). Fig. 5. The effect of distance between

    paper, we use the MATLAB software to simulate our proposed algorithm to obtain
    the simulation results. In our simulations we consider just two players (N = 2),
    we use \( M = \left\{ {\text{30},\text{100},\text{180},\rm{255}} \right\} \) as
    a number of bits per packet (in bytes), \( R = \left\{ {\text{1},\rm{2}} \right\}
    \) as a data rate (in Mbps), we choose \( \text{2} \le \alpha \le \rm{4} \), and
    we use the power to noise ratio interval \( \rho_{i} = \left[ {\text{0},\rm{25}}
    \right] \) (in dB). The average data rate \( I_{i} \left( {p,M,R} \right) \) can
    takes one of eight shapes depending on the combinations of the data rate \( R
    \) and the packet size \( M \). Using (4) and \( t_{interval} = \text{1} \) ms,
    we obtain the following values. From the above Table 2, we can conclude that the
    maximum obtained value of the average data rate is \( I_{max} = \text{1},\text{0099}.\text{10}^{\rm{6}}
    \) bps. Table 2. The used average data rate \( I_{i} \left( {p,M,R} \right) \)
    values Full size table After the initialization of the all parameters, each player
    from the proposed game aims to maximize their power efficiency by choosing optimal
    power, optimal speed, and optimal amount of information (data rate and packet
    size). The two players do not cooperate and instantaneously decide on their strategy.
    For example, we apply the algorithm program for two cases. In the first case,
    we choose \( d_{ii} = \rm{0}\text{.5} \), \( d_{ij} = \text{2} \), and \( \alpha
    = \rm{2}\text{.5} \). For the second case, we choose \( d_{ii} = \rm{0}\text{.7}
    \), \( d_{ij} = \rm{1}\text{.5} \), and \( \alpha = \text{3} \). We use this parameters
    values and we simulate our proposed algorithm to find the NE and we provide the
    obtained results in the following (Table 3). Table 3. The NE of the game Full
    size table In the next subsections, we study the effect of the distance between
    the pairs \( d_{ij} \), the distance between (sender, receiver) pair \( d_{ii}
    \) and finally the path-loss exponent \( \alpha \) on the NE of a static non-cooperative
    complete information game algorithm. 5.1 Effect of the Distance Between the Pairs
    on NE We fix the distance between the (sender, receiver) pair at \( d_{ii} = 0.6
    \), the path-loss exponent at \( \alpha = 2 \), and we vary \( d_{ij} \) the distance
    between the pairs from 0.7 to 7 with a step of 0.2. The following figures illustrate
    the effect of the distance \( d_{ij} \) on the optimal data rate and the packet
    size, the optimal throughput, the optimal power to noise ratio, the optimal SINR
    and the optimum values of the normalize the efficiency function. These results
    show that the NE depends on the distance between the pairs \( d_{ij} \). We obtain
    a NE for each distance, where the algorithm chooses the optimal power data rate
    and packet size that increases the system efficiency. The results show that the
    optimal power levels increase when the distances between the pairs increases.
    5.2 Effect of the Distance Between (Sender, Receiver) Pair In this case, we fix
    the distance between the users at \( d_{ij} = \text{3} \) and the path-loss exponent
    at \( \alpha = \text{2} \). And, we change \( d_{ii} \) the distance between (sender,
    receiver) pair, from 0.3 to 1.3 with a step of 0.06 (Figs. 9, 10, 11 and 12).

    on NE: The optimal Throughput. Full size image Fig. 10. The effect of distance
    between the (sender, receiver) pair \( d_{ii} \) on NE: The optimal Power to Noise

    of distance between the (sender, receiver) pair \( d_{ii} \) on NE: The optimum
    values of the normalize efficiency function. Full size image Similarly, to the
    previous subsection, the results show that the NE depends on the distance \( d_{ii}
    \) between each sender receiver. Also, we obtain a NE for each distance. But in
    this case, the results show that the optimal power levels increase when the distances
    \( d_{ii} \) decrease. 5.3 Effect of the Path-Loss Exponent In this case, the
    simulations of the wireless network are run with distance between the sender receiver
    \( d_{ii} = 0.7 \) and distance between the pairs \( d_{ij} = \text{2} \). In
    the simulations, the path-loss parameter \( \alpha \) takes these interval values
    \( \text{2} \le \alpha \le \text{4} \) using 0.15 as a step (Figs. 13, 14, 15
    and 16). Fig. 13. The effect of the path-loss exponent on NE: The optimal Throughput

    exponent on NE: The optimum values of the normalize efficiency function. Full
    size image As we can see from these results, the effect of the path-loss exponent
    on Nash Equilibrium is similar to the effect of distance between pairs on Nash
    Equilibrium. 6 Conclusion In the near future, the life quality of billions of
    people will depend on the efficiency use of information and communication technologies
    to build smart environments that are able to improve the performance efficiency
    of urban services such as resource consumption, health care, citizen security
    and utilities. In this paper, we have investigated the problem of interference
    and power consumption in a wireless network. Considering the optimal: throughput,
    power to noise ratio, SINR and the efficiency function values. We have proposed
    a game theory algorithm to solve the problem of interference and power consumption
    in wireless network. Simulation results show that the system efficiency is improved
    when the algorithm optimizes: the power amount, the packet size, the data rate
    and the system interference from cognitive users to authorized users. The proposed
    work leads to less power consumption and to an optimal channel organization. References

    Dynamic spectrum access stands as a promising and spectrum-efficient communication
    approach for resource-constrained multihop wireless sensor networks due to their
    event-driven communication nature, which generally yields bursty traffic depending
    on the event characteristics. In addition, opportunistic spectrum access may also
    help realize the deployment of multiple overlaid sensor networks, and eliminate
    collision and excessive contention delay incurred by dense node deployment. Incorporating
    cognitive radio capability in sensor networks yields a new sensor networking paradigm
    (i.e., cognitive radio sensor networks). In this article the main design principles,
    potential advantages, application areas, and network architectures of CRSNs are
    introduced. The existing communication protocols and algorithms devised for cognitive
    radio networks and WSNs are discussed along with the open research avenues for
    the realization of CRSNs. Published in: IEEE Network ( Volume: 23, Issue: 4, July-August

    10.1109/MNET.2009.5191144 Publisher: IEEE By dynamically changing its operating
    parameters, cognitive radio senses the spectrum, determines the vacant bands,
    and makes use of these available bands in an opportunistic manner, improving the
    overall spectrum utilization. With these capabilities, cognitive radio can operate
    in licensed as well as unlicensed bands. In licensed bands wireless users with
    a specific license to communicate over the allocated band (the primary users,
    PUs), have the priority to access the channel. Cognitive radio user, called secondary
    users (SUs), can access the channel as long as they does not cause interference
    to the PUs. When a PU starts communication, the cognitive radio user must detect
    the potentially vacant bands (spectrum sensing), decide onto which channel to
    move (spectrum decision), and then finally adapt its transceiver so that the active
    communication is continued over the new channel (spectrum handoff). This sequence
    of operation outlines a typical cognitive cycle [1], which can also be applied
    over an unlicensed band by all cognitive radio users. Cognitive radio capabilities
    may also be exploited by wireless sensor networks (WSNs), which are traditionally
    assumed to employ fixed spectrum allocation, and characterized by the communication
    and processing resource constraints of low-end sensor nodes. Depending on the
    application, a WSN composed of sensor nodes equipped with cognitive radio may
    benefit from its potential advantages: Dynamic spectrum access: The existing WSN
    deployments assume fixed spectrum allocation over very crowded unlicensed bands
    [2] also used by other devices, as in Table 1. Nevertheless, a spectrum lease
    for a licensed band amplifies the overall deployment cost. Hence, to be able to
    cooperate efficiently with other types of users, opportunistic spectrum access
    may be utilized in WSNs. Opportunistic channel usage for bursty traffic: A large
    number of sensor nodes detecting an event generate bursty traffic and try to acquire
    the channel to send their readings. This increases the probability of collisions
    and packet losses, which decreases the overall communication reliability with
    excessive power consumption. Opportunistic access to multiple alternative channels
    may alleviate these potential challenges. Adaptability for reducing power consumption:
    The dynamic nature of the wireless channel causes energy consumption due to packet
    losses and retransmissions. Cognitive radio capable sensor nodes may be able to
    adapt to varying channel conditions, which would increase transmission efficiency,
    and hence help reduce power used for transmission and reception. Overlaid deployment
    of multiple concurrent WSN: Dynamic spectrum management may significantly contribute
    to the efficient coexistence of spatially overlapping sensor networks in terms
    of communication performance and resource utilization. Communication under different
    spectrum regulations: A certain band available in one specific region or country
    may not be available in another due to varying spectrum regulations. Sensor nodes
    equipped with cognitive radio capability may overcome this potential problem.
    In general, a cognitive radio sensor network (CRSN) can be defined as a distributed
    network of wireless cognitive radio sensor nodes, which sense event signals and
    collaboratively communicate their readings dynamically over available spectrum
    bands in a multihop manner to ultimately satisfy the application-specific requirements.
    However, the realization of CRSNs and their potential advantages outlined above
    depends on addressing challenges including inherent resource constraints of sensor
    nodes, additional communication and processing demands imposed by cognitive radio
    capability, design of low-cost and power-efficient cognitive radio sensor nodes,
    and multihop opportunistic communication over licensed and unlicensed spectrum
    bands in densely deployed sensor networks. Despite the extensive volume of research
    results on WSN and ad hoc cognitive radio networks [3], the CRSN is a vastly unexplored
    field with only a handful of studies. In [4] an energy-efficient and adaptive
    modulation technique is introduced for CRSNs to achieve high power efficiency
    toward maximizing the lifetime of resource-constrained sensor networks. In [5]
    CRSNs are discussed for applications such as health care and telemedicine, which
    require timely delivery of critical information. The potential of dynamic spectrum
    access in sensor networks is shown in [6] to achieve high power efficiency in
    sensing applications. In this article we introduce the main design challenges
    and principles, potential advantages and application areas, and network architectures
    of CRSNs. The existing communication protocols and algorithms devised for cognitive
    radio networks as well as WSNs are explored from the perspective of CRSNs, and
    the open research avenues are highlighted. Our objective is to provide a clear
    picture of the potentials of CRSNs, the current state of the art, and the research
    issues on this timely and exciting topic. Table 1. Operating spectrum bands of
    commercial WSN transceivers and overlapping wireless systems CRSN Architecture
    A typical communication architecture of a CRSN is illustrated in Fig. 1a. Depending
    on spectrum availability, sensor nodes transmit their readings in an opportunistic
    manner to the next hops and ultimately to the sink. The sink may also be equipped
    with cognitive radio capability (i.e., a cognitive radio sink). In addition to
    the event readings, sensors may exchange additional information with the sink
    including control data for group formation, spectrum allocation, and spectrum-handoff-aware
    route determination depending on the specific topology. CRSN Node Structure The
    main difference between the hardware structure of a classical sensor and a CRSN
    node is the cognitive radio transceiver of a CRSN node (Fig. 2). A cognitive radio
    unit enables the sensor nodes to dynamically adapt their communication parameters
    such as carrier frequency, transmission power, and modulation. CRSN nodes also
    inherit the limitations of conventional sensor nodes in terms of power, communication,
    processing, and memory resources, which also restricts the features of cognitive
    radio. Figure 2. Hardware structure of a cognitive radio sensor node. Show All
    CRSN Topology According to the application requirements, CRSNs may exhibit different
    network topologies, as explored below. Ad Hoc CRSN In an ad hoc CRSN such as that
    in Fig. 1a, nodes send their readings to the sink in multiple hops in an ad hoc
    manner. This topology imposes less communication overhead in terms of control
    data. However, due to the hidden terminal problem, spectrum sensing results may
    be inaccurate. Clustered CRSN It is essential to designate a common channel to
    exchange various control data, such as spectrum sensing results, spectrum allocation
    data, neighbor discovery, and maintenance information. While it may not be possible
    to find a network-wide common channel, it is highly possible in a certain restricted
    locality [7]. Therefore, a cluster-based network architecture such as the one
    in Fig. 1b is an appropriate choice for effective dynamic spectrum management
    with a local common control channel approach. Heterogeneous and Hierarchical CRSN
    CRSN architecture may incorporate special nodes equipped with more or renewable
    power sources such as actor nodes, which act on the sensed event in wireless sensor
    and actor networks (WSANs). Here, actor nodes may perform additional tasks like
    local spectrum bargaining. These nodes may have longer transmission ranges and
    hence be used as relay nodes. This forms a heterogeneous and hierarchical topology
    with ordinary CRSN nodes, high power relay nodes (e.g., cognitive radio actor
    nodes), and the sink (Fig. 1c). Mobile CRSNs Mobility of the architectural elements
    in a CRSN yields a more dynamic topology, amplifying the existing challenges.
    This requires mobility-aware dynamic spectrum management solutions over resource-constrained
    CRSN nodes. Moreover, cognitive radio communication protocols for CRSNs must consider
    mobility as well. In general, the physical characteristics of a CRSN node and
    the diverse set of CRSN network topologies discussed above yield many open research
    issues: CRSN node development: Hardware and software design of efficient, practical,
    and cost-effective cognitive radio sensor nodes must be investigated. Node deployment
    strategies: Dynamic spectrum-based optimal node deployment strategies in terms
    of network coverage, spectrum utilization, and power consumption in CRSN topologies
    must be analyzed toward design of practical yet efficient deployment mechanisms.
    Spectrum-aware clustering: For applications requiring cluster-based and hierarchical
    CRSN topologies, dynamic spectrum-aware group formation and maintenance techniques
    are required. Figure 1. a) Cognitive radio sensor network (CRSN) architecture;
    b) possible network topologies for clustered CRSN; c) a heterogeneous hierarchical
    CRSN Show All Potential Application Areas of Crsns Due to its potential advantages
    introduced above, CRSN might be a promising solution for some specific sensor
    network applications, explored below. Indoor Sensing Applications Indoor applications
    (e.g., telemedicine [5], home monitoring, emergency networks, factory automation)
    generally require the deployment of many sensor nodes within a small area. These
    nodes use unlicensed bands, such as industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM)
    bands, which are extremely crowded [2]. This yields significant challenges for
    achieving reliable communication due to packet losses, collisions, and contention
    delay. Here, opportunistic spectrum access of CRSNs may help mitigate these challenges
    such that critical information requiring real-time reliable communication may
    exploit the potential advantages of dynamic spectrum management even in crowded
    environments. Multimedia Applications Reliable and timely delivery of event features
    in the form of multimedia by resource-constrained sensor nodes under varying channel
    conditions is an extremely challenging objective due to the inherent high bandwidth
    demands of multimedia. CRSNs may provide sensor nodes the freedom to dynamically
    change communication channels according to the environmental conditions and application-specific
    QoS requirements in terms of bandwidth, bit error rates, and access delay. For
    example, as the packet travels through multiple hops, each relaying node may use
    higher frequencies and the highest possible data rate to provide required bandwidth.
    Multiclass Heterogeneous Sensing Applications Some applications may require multiple
    sensor networks with distinct sensing objectives to coexist over a common area
    [8]. Data gathered by these networks may be fused to feed a single decision support.
    Similarly, in a single sensor network different sensor nodes may be deployed over
    the same area to sample the event signal over multiple dimensions including scalar
    measurements (e.g., heat, humidity, location, motion) as well as audio-visual
    readings of the target being monitored. With the help of dynamic spectrum management,
    multiclass heterogeneous sensor networks may overlap with minimum interference
    with each other. Furthermore, through coordination and cooperative spectrum management
    among these multiple CRSNs, their individual performance and the overall spectrum
    utilization may be improved. Real-Time Surveillance Applications Real-time surveillance
    applications like target detection and tracking require minimum channel access
    and communication delay. In traditional WSNs this objective may not always be
    achieved due to crowded operating spectrum band. Furthermore, additional latency
    may occur in case of rerouting due to a link failure caused by degrading channel
    conditions. In CRSNs sensor nodes may opportunistically access the available channel
    to maintain minimum access and end-to-end delay for effective real-time surveillance
    applications. With the development of new delay-constrained joint spectrum allocation
    and routing algorithms for CRSNs, performance of real-time sensing applications
    may be further improved. In addition, with the spectrum handoff capability, tactical
    surveillance CRSNs may be less susceptible to interception and jamming threats.
    Dynamic Spectrum Management in CRSN The major challenges and open research issues
    regarding the efficient dynamic spectrum management framework primarily required
    for the realization of CRSNs are explored in this section. Spectrum Sensing Spectrum
    sensing is one of the major functionalities distinguishing CRSNs from traditional
    WSNs. Since nodes can operate on spectrum bands of the licensed PUs in an opportunistic
    manner, they must gather spectrum usage information via spectrum sensing prior
    to transmission. However, the advantages of opportunistic spectrum access (e.g.,
    more bandwidth, lower error rate due to the ability to switch to the best channel,
    smaller contention delay) come with the additional power consumption imposed by
    spectrum sensing and distribution of sensing results. Therefore, a thorough analysis
    of cost vs. benefits for a specific CRSN application must be performed. In the
    literature there are various spectrum sensing methods, which are examined below
    in terms of how they can be applied to CRSNs: Matched filter: This is the optimal
    spectrum sensing method in Gaussian noise; however, it requires a priori knowledge
    about PU transmission and additional hardware for CRSN nodes to synchronize with
    the PU. Energy detection: If the measured energy on a channel is below a threshold
    value, the channel is considered available. Its simplicity and low signal processing
    requirement make this method very attractive for CRSNs. However, energy detection
    requires longer measurement duration leading to higher power consumption. Feature
    detection: This method can be used when certain features of the PU transmission
    (e.g., carrier frequency and cyclic prefixes) are known. It exploits the spectrum
    correlation of the PU signal, and hence is very robust against variations of noise.
    However, it has very high complexity; therefore, it may not be suitable for CRSNs.
    Interference temperature: Nodes calculate how much interference they would cause
    at the PU receiver and adjust their transmission power such that their interference
    plus the noise floor does not exceed a certain interference temperature level.
    This method requires a priori PU location information, and is computationally
    too intensive for a low-end CRSN node. Along these main approaches as outlined
    in Table 2, many spectrum sensing methods exist for cognitive radio that are not
    directly tailored for constrained sensor nodes. Therefore, there are several open
    research issues on spectrum sensing in CRSNs: Hybrid sensing techniques: New hybrid
    sensing techniques, exploiting the advantages of main spectrum sensing approaches
    and addressing the trade-off between sensing accuracy and complexity, must be
    investigated. Cooperative sensing: Distributed cooperative spectrum sensing mechanisms
    that strike a balance between sensing accuracy and overhead need to be developed.
    Sensing based on collaborative PU statistics: Intelligent and distributed methods,
    which collectively estimate and then make use of PU channel usage statistics,
    must be explored to improve sensing accuracy. Spectrum Decision CRSN nodes must
    analyze the sensing data and make a decision about the channel and transmission
    parameters (e.g., transmission power and modulation). Spectrum decision methods
    proposed for cognitive radio networks consider power consumption as a secondary
    issue. Processing capabilities and the amount of extra control packets to transmit
    are almost always ignored. Clearly, these settings do not match CRSN characteristics
    due to inherent constraints of sensor nodes. On the other hand, the spectrum sensing
    results will be similar in any given locality [7]. If nodes try to access the
    channel depending only on their individual spectrum decision results, collision
    probability increases. Furthermore, since nodes run the same algorithm, when a
    collision occurs, they all try to switch to another channel, leaving the previous
    channel empty and colliding again on the new channel. Therefore, spectrum decisions
    in CRSNs must be coordinated to increase overall utilization and maximize power
    efficiency. Furthermore, a spectrum decision mechanism for CRSNs must have low
    complexity as well. Coordination and spectrum decision can be handled by centralized
    or distributed approaches. A sink might be designated as the centralized entity
    to reach a network-wide optimal spectrum decision, which also imposes additional
    traffic, resulting in excessive power consumption. However, in distributed coordination,
    nodes share their spectrum sensing and decision results only with their immediate
    neighbors or within small clusters. This approach leads to suboptimal utilization,
    which can still be close to global optimal [7], and yet is considerably simpler
    to implement and incurs less communication and power overhead than the centralized
    approach. Table 2. Overview of spectrum sensing methods Clearly, there are many
    open research issues for the development of new spectrum decision techniques for
    CRSNs: Spectrum decision parameters: Parameters to be used in spectrum decision
    (e.g., signal-to-noise ratio, channel capacity, delays and holding times of PUs)
    must be explored, and new algorithms that yield optimal spectrum decisions must
    be designed. Distribution of control data: Using a network-wide common control
    channel for coordinated spectrum decision is generally not feasible; however,
    finding such a channel within a given locality has high probability. Therefore,
    energy-efficient centralized and distributed methods of sharing spectrum decision
    in CRSN data must be thoroughly investigated. Spectrum Handoff When a PU starts
    using a previously available channel, CRSN nodes must detect this activity within
    a certain time through spectrum sensing methods. Then they immediately move to
    another available channel decided on by an effective spectrum decision mechanism,
    even if they have ongoing transmissions. Nodes may also want to switch channels
    if channel conditions get worse, reducing communication performance. This fundamental
    functionality of cognitive radio is called spectrum handoff. When spectrum handoff
    is needed, first an alternate channel must be determined. Then a receiver-transmitter
    handshake must be performed on the new channel. Only then may nodes continue their
    transmissions. All of these additional operations incur long delays and hence
    buffer overflows, which lead to packet losses, degradation in reliability, and
    ultimately resource waste in CRSNs. In [5] a central spectrum allocation scheme
    that tries to minimize spectrum handoff has been proposed for CRSNs. However,
    none of the previous studies on spectrum handoff consider the challenges posed
    by the inherent limitations of CRSNs. As an open research issue, minimizing the
    effect of spectrum handoff on various communication layers must be analyzed for
    CRSNs. At the same time, the development of central and distributed spectrum handoff
    solutions for CRSNs must be investigated. Communication in CRSNs Here, we investigate
    the specific design considerations, existing approaches, and open research issues
    of each communication layer in close relation with dynamic spectrum management,
    as illustrated in Fig. 3 Physical Layer The physical layer of a CRSN node should
    provide the capability of reconfiguring its operating frequency, modulation, channel
    coding, and output power without hardware replacement. Software-defined radio
    (SDR)-based RF front-end transmitters and receivers are required for reconfigurability
    of CRSN nodes. However, this is a significant challenge due to the low-cost and
    resource-constrained nature of sensor nodes. On the other hand, limited capabilities
    of analog-to-digital (A/D) converters and heavyweight signal processing algorithms
    make spectrum sensing a challenging issue as well. Detecting weak signals, and
    hence the presence of PUs, while there are SUs is a significant sensing challenge
    in CRSNs. Wideband spectrum sensing, advanced modulation schemes, and cognitive
    learning capabilities cannot be fully realized in a CRSN node due to its limited
    computational power. Clearly, there are many fundamental open research issues
    on the physical layer design for CRSNs: SDR-based transceiver: For energy-efficient
    and practical dynamic spectrum access, low-cost SDR-based transceivers must be
    designed for CRSN nodes. Optimal waveform design: Design of an optimal waveform
    to be used over multiple channels with different transmission parameters needs
    to be studied. Adaptive power control: Methods addressing the trade-off between
    transmission power and interference must be designed for densely deployed CRSN.
    Data Link Layer Error Control The main error control schemes assumed by WSNs are
    forward error correction (FEC) and automatic repeat request (ARQ). Despite the
    simplicity of ARQ approaches, their retransmission-based mechanism causes extra
    energy consumption and reduces bandwidth utilization. Therefore, similar to traditional
    WSNs, FEC schemes are promising for resource-constrained cognitive radio sensor
    nodes. However, a fixed FEC scheme may not yield optimal results for every channel
    under spectrum mobility in CRSNs. Hence, dynamic spectrum-aware and low-complexity
    FEC mechanisms for CRSNs need to be developed. Accordingly, optimal packet size
    distribution in CRSNs must be analyzed. Medium Access Control In general, a medium
    access con-trol (MAC) protocol aims to provide the sensor nodes with means to
    access the medium in a fair and efficient manner. In CRSNs, depending on the specific
    topology, sensor nodes may handshake to negotiate on the channel before transmitting
    packets. Both topology forming and channel negotiations require control packet
    exchange. Therefore, compared to conventional WSNs, the MAC layer of a CRSN node
    must handle additional challenges such as silent spectrum sensing periods temporarily
    inhibiting transmission, the impracticality of broadcast over a network-wide common
    channel, and the need for high-priority access mechanism for the distribution
    of spectrum sensing and decision results. Figure 3. Interaction between the communication
    and dynamic spectrum management functionalities. Show All There is a substantial
    amount of work in the literature on MAC solutions for ad hoc cognitive radio networks
    [9]. However, these solutions have various disadvantages that render them impractical
    for CRSNs, such as a requirement for multiple transceivers, dependence on network-wide
    synchronization, and poor performance under bursty traffic in densely deployed
    networks. Hence, new approaches are needed for CRSNs. The open research areas
    can be listed as: Novel MAC solutions: A new spectrum-aware and energy-efficient
    MAC technique that can make full use of the multiple alternative channel availability
    must be developed. Minimum communication overhead: Solutions for CRSNs must operate
    with minimum exchange of control data with no additional hardware requirements,
    such as an extra transceiver or GPS for synchronization. Opportunistic duty cycle:
    New duty cycle mechanisms must be designed that jointly consider neighbor discovery,
    and spectrum sensing and allocation. Network Layer Existing ad hoc cognitive radio
    routing schemes aim to provide joint spectrum and routing decisions, but do not
    consider the inherent resource constraints of CRSNs. Similarly, routing schemes
    developed for WSNs mainly aim to minimize energy consumption and do not handle
    dynamic spectrum access. Due to spectrum mobility in CRSNs, hop-based channel
    characteristics like channel access delay, interference, operating frequency,
    and bandwidth are new metrics to consider in the design of new routing techniques.
    As spectrum handoff incurs delay, the number of channel switches along a path
    between source and sink also affects the route decision and hence must be considered
    by routing algorithms. In addition, a spectrum decision can change the neighboring
    status of a CRSN node [10], and hence is directly related and must be jointly
    considered with route determination in CRSNs, as illustrated in Fig. 4. Figure
    4. Three frequencies, F1, F2, F3, with different transmission ranges, R1, R2,
    and R3, such that R1 > R2, R3, are available. F3 is used by the PU. When node
    1 selects F1for transmission, it connects to node 2 directly, or over nodes 3
    and 4. However, if it selects F2, it can only connect to node 2 over nodes 3 or
    4. If it selects F3, it connects to node 2 over node 3 as a path over node 4 cannot
    be used due to PU activity. Show All Furthermore, with spectrum handoff, routes
    may be obsolete during new spectrum sensing and assignment phases. After spectrum
    assignment, variation in channel characteristics mandates recalculation of routes
    according to the metrics in use. Unlike cognitive radio networks, rerouting algorithms
    should also be highly energy-efficient in CRSN. Moreover, the absence of a global
    common channel makes neighbor discovery and messaging for route establishment
    quite challenging for CRSNs. Therefore, heavyweight and high-maintenance routing
    algorithms may not be practical for CRSNs. The open research issues for effective
    network layer solutions in CRSNs are: Opportunistic spectrum-aware routing: New
    energy-efficient cognitive radio routing metrics and mechanisms that consider
    spectrum mobility, resource constraints, and dense deployment must be developed.
    Analytical framework for routing optimization: The efficiency and complexity of
    routing in conjunction with opportunistic spectrum access must be analyzed to
    reach optimal networking solutions for CRSNs. Adaptive and QoS-aware routing:
    New techniques considering application-specific QoS requirements for varying channel
    conditions need to be designed for real-time communication in CRSN. Transport
    Layer In sensor networks the transport layer is mainly responsible for end-to-end
    reliable delivery of event readings and congestion control to preserve scarce
    network resources while considering application-based QoS requirements. To achieve
    successful detection and tracking of an event signal, event features must be reliably
    communicated to the sink without leading to congestion, which wastes power and
    communication resources. While this delicate balance between reliability and energy
    efficiency is also inherited by CRSNs, dynamic spectrum management brings additional
    challenges such as varying channel characteristics (e.g., link delay, channel
    bit error rate, capacity, additional delay, and packet losses due to spectrum
    handoff) and temporal inability to transmit due to silent sensing periods. Furthermore,
    some applications such as target tracking and surveillance may also impose additional
    real-time delay bounds on the reliable communication requirements. Moreover, effective
    transport layer solutions are also required, with even tighter reliability requirements,
    for delivery of queries, commands, and code updates in the reverse path (i.e.,
    from the sink to the sensors) in CRSNs. Although there exist several transport
    layer solutions for reliable delivery with minimum energy consumption and congestion
    avoidance in WSNs, none of them considers dynamic spectrum access. In [3] a transport
    layer mechanism addressing dynamic spectrum access in cognitive radio ad hoc networks
    is presented. However, it does not consider the inherent constraints and requirements
    of sensor networks. Hence, there are several open research issues for transport
    layer in CRSNs: Spectrum-aware reliability: New reliability definitions, objectives,
    metrics, and analytical modeling must be studied in order to incorporate the fundamental
    variables of dynamic spectrum access. Opportunistic energy-efficient transport:
    Energy-efficient cross-layer spectrum-aware transport protocols must be developed
    for both event-to-sink and sink-to-sensor communication in CRSNs. Real-time cognitive
    reliable transport: Adaptive real-time transport solutions must be developed to
    address application-specific real-time reliability and QoS requirements under
    varying spectrum characteristics. Application Layer Application layer algorithms
    in sensor networks mainly deal with the generation of information and extracting
    the features of event signals being monitored to communicate to the sink. Other
    services provided by the application layer include methods to query sensors, interest
    and data dissemination, data aggregation, and fusion. Clearly, each of these services
    must utilize the capabilities of a CRSN while conforming to its limitations. Therefore,
    existing application layer protocols must be revisited with these capabilities
    and limitations in mind. One of the potential areas that needs an application
    layer protocol is overlay multiclass heterogeneous sensor networks described earlier.
    For such applications, an application layer protocol that analyzes and organizes
    user queries in a heterogeneous network for efficient transmission is needed.
    Similarly, for multimedia sensor applications an open research issue is adaptive
    coding schemes that can employ various coding methods depending on channel conditions
    and handoff rate. On the other hand, data aggregation and fusion techniques that
    aim to decrease communication cost with additional com-plexity have been widely
    studied. However, in CRSNs transceivers of the nodes may be tuned to different
    channels; thus, a node cannot hear all transmitted data around it. New aggregation
    and fusion techniques that address CRSN''s limitations and take advantage of its
    additional capabilities must be investigated. Another open research issue is developing
    schemes to perform sampling of the event signal and gather sensing data based
    on spectrum availability. If sensing results are sent to the sink periodically,
    mechanisms to schedule sampling and sensing based on spectrum availability must
    be investigated. If sensing data is sent based on queries from the sink, new query
    methods that take spectrum availability into account must be developed. Conclusions
    In this article we investigate CRSNs formed by incorporating cognitive radio capabilities
    in WSNs. We discuss advantages and limitations of CRSNs, and explore the applicability
    of the existing techniques for cognitive radio and WSNs in CRSNs along with their
    shortcomings. Clearly, there are many significant challenges in the realization
    of CRSNs. We anticipate that this article will provide better understanding of
    the potentials for CRSNs and motivate the research community to further explore
    this promising direction. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics

    Get rights and content Abstract With the fast adoption of Internet of Things devices
    in our lives, the demand for the wireless spectrum has increased manyfold. With
    existing static spectrum allocation policies in use, it has become extremely difficult
    to find a spectrum to deploy new applications or to enhance existing ones. To
    overcome this spectrum scarceness, regulatory bodies around the world have permitted
    opportunistic spectrum access of unoccupied television bands, known as TV white
    spaces, by unlicensed users. The decision to open up TV channels for unlicensed
    access has elicited many standardization activities around the world such as IEEE
    802.22, 802.19.1, 802.11af, and ECMA 392 for intelligent networking. The TV channels
    are expected to be used by many unlicensed networks with different requirements
    for bandwidth and transmission power based on their architecture while protecting
    incumbent licensed users from harmful interference. Thus, the heterogeneous coexistence
    in TV channels is expected to be the most challenging issue in the future that
    needs an open discussion. In this chapter, we highlight some major challenges
    to the coexistence of heterogeneous cognitive radio networks in TV white space
    that need immediate attention for various standardization activities. Various
    resource allocation schemes and medium access control protocols have been discussed.
    Considering the heterogeneity of the network, various security aspects and algorithms
    are reviewed. Finally, various standardization activities around the globe for
    unlicensed use of TV white space are highlighted to support dynamic spectrum sharing
    among heterogeneous networks in TV white spaces. References (0) Cited by (2) Distributed

    Abstract: Spectrum sensing is an essential functionality that enables cognitive
    radios to detect spectral holes and to opportunistically use under-utilized frequency
    bands without causing harmful interference to legacy (primary) networks. In this
    paper, a novel wideband spectrum sensing technique referred to as multiband joint
    detection is introduced, which jointly detects the primary signals over multiple
    frequency bands rather than over one band at a time. Specifically, the spectrum
    sensing problem is formulated as a class of optimization problems, which maximize
    the aggregated opportunistic throughput of a cognitive radio system under some
    constraints on the interference to the primary users. By exploiting the hidden
    convexity in the seemingly nonconvex problems, optimal solutions can be obtained
    for multiband joint detection under practical conditions. The situation in which
    individual cognitive radios might not be able to reliably detect weak primary
    signals due to channel fading/shadowing is also considered. To address this issue
    by exploiting the spatial diversity, a cooperative wideband spectrum sensing scheme
    refereed to as spatial-spectral joint detection is proposed, which is based on
    a linear combination of the local statistics from multiple spatially distributed
    cognitive radios. The cooperative sensing problem is also mapped into an optimization
    problem, for which suboptimal solutions can be obtained through mathematical transformation
    under conditions of practical interest. Simulation results show that the proposed
    spectrum sensing schemes can considerably improve system performance. This paper
    establishes useful principles for the design of distributed wideband spectrum
    sensing algorithms in cognitive radio networks. Published in: IEEE Transactions

    Publisher: IEEE SECTION I. Introduction Traditional wireless networks are regulated
    by fixed spectrum allocation policies to operate in certain time frames, over
    certain frequency bands, and within certain geographical regions. This regulation
    results in situations in which some radio bands are overcrowded while other bands
    remain moderately or rarely occupied. In order to improve spectral utilization,
    cognitive radio (CR) technology has been proposed as a potential communication
    paradigm [1]. Cognitive radios are defined by the Federal Communications Commission
    (FCC) [2] as radio systems that continuously perform spectrum sensing, dynamically
    identify unused spectrum, and then operate in those spectral holes where the licensed
    (primary) radio systems are idle. In CR networks, secondary users are allowed
    to use some portions of licensed radio bands opportunistically provided that they
    do not cause harmful interference to the primary users in these frequency bands.
    CR is an important component of the IEEE 802.22 standard being developed for wireless
    regional area networks, which involves a cognitive radio based air interface to
    operate in a licence-exempt way over the TV broadcast bands. This new communication
    paradigm, also referred to as the dynamic spectrum access (DSA) or neXt Generation
    (XG) network [3], can dramatically improve spectral utilization. Effective spectrum
    sensing needs to detect weak primary radio signals of possibly-unknown formats
    reliably [4]. Generally, spectrum sensing techniques can be classified into three
    broad categories: energy detection [5], [6], matched filtering (coherent) detection
    [7], and feature detection [8]. Energy detection has been shown to be optimal
    if the cognitive devices have no a priori information about the features of the
    primary signals except local noise statistics [9]. When the CRs have some knowledge
    about the primary signal features such as preambles, pilots, and synchronization
    symbols, the optimal detector usually applies the matched filter structure to
    maximize the probability of detection. If the modulation schemes of the primary
    signals are known, then the cyclostationary feature detector can differentiate
    primary signals from the local noise by exploiting certain periodicity exhibited
    by the mean and autocorrelation of the corresponding modulated signals. Since
    noncoherent energy detection is simple and able to determine spectrum-occupancy
    information quickly, we will adopt it as the building block for constructing the
    proposed wideband spectrum sensing techniques. A. Related Work Previous studies
    on spectrum sensing in CR networks have focused primarily on cooperation among
    multiple secondary users [4], [10], [11] using distributed detection approaches
    [12], [13], but are limited to the detection of signals over a single frequency
    band. The scheme based on voting rules [14] is one of the simplest suboptimal
    solutions, which counts the number of nodes that vote for the presence of the
    signal and compares it against a given threshold. In [15], a fusion rule known
    as the or logic operation was used to combine decisions from several secondary
    users. In [16], two decision-combining approaches were studied: hard decision
    with the and logic operation, and soft decision using the likelihood ratio test
    [12]. It was shown that the soft decision combination of spectrum sensing results
    yields gains over hard decision combining. In [17], the authors exploited the
    fact that summing signals from two secondary users can increase the signal-to-noise
    ratio (SNR) and detection reliability if the signals are correlated. In [18],
    a generalized likelihood ratio test for detecting the presence of cyclostationarity
    using multiple cyclic frequencies was proposed and evaluated using Monte Carlo
    simulations. Another two cooperative spectrum sensing algorithms based on the
    likelihood ratio test can be found in [19] and [20]. Along with these works, we
    have developed an optimal cooperation strategy [21] based on a linear combination
    of local statistics from multiple cognitive radios. Other suboptimal solutions
    for linear cooperation such as maximal radio combining and maximal deflection
    coefficient combining can be found respectively in [21]–[23]. On the other hand,
    the literature of wideband spectrum sensing for cognitive radio networks is rather
    limited at this time. An existing approach is to use a tunable narrowband bandpass
    filter at the radio frequency (RF) front-end to search one narrow frequency band
    at a time [24], over which existing narrowband spectrum sensing techniques can
    be applied. In order to search over multiple frequency bands at a time, the RF
    front-end needs a wideband architecture and spectrum sensing usually operates
    over an estimate of the power spectral density (PSD) of the wideband signal. In
    [25] and [26], the multiresolution features of the wavelet transform were used
    to estimate the PSD over a wide frequency range. However, no prior work attempts
    to make decisions over multiple frequency bands jointly, which is essential for
    implementing efficient cognitive radio networks. A survey of existing spectrum
    sensing techniques can be found in [35]. B. Contribution The contribution of this
    paper is twofold. First, we introduce the multiband joint detection framework
    for wideband spectrum sensing in a single CR. Within this framework, we jointly
    optimize a bank of multiple narrowband detectors to improve the aggregate opportunistic
    throughput of a cognitive radio system while limiting the interference to the
    primary communication system. In particular, we formulate the design of wideband
    spectrum sensing into a class of optimization problems. The objective is to maximize
    the aggregate opportunistic throughput in an interference-limited cognitive radio
    network. By exploiting the hidden convexity of the seemingly nonconvex problems,
    we show that the optimization problem can be reformulated into a convex program
    under practical conditions. The multiband joint detection strategy allows cognitive
    radios to best take advantage of the unused frequency bands and limit the resulting
    interference. In addition, we consider the situation in which spectrum sensing
    is compromised by destructive channel conditions between the target-under-detection
    and the detecting cognitive radios, where it is hard to distinguish between a
    white spectrum and a weak signal attenuated by deep fading. We propose a cooperative
    wideband spectrum sensing scheme that exploits the spatial diversity among multiple
    CRs to improve the sensing reliability. The cooperation is based on a linear combination
    of local statistics from spatially distributed cognitive radios [21], [23], where
    these signals are assigned different weights according to their individual positive
    contributions to the joint sensing. In such a scenario, we view the design of
    distributed wideband spectrum sensing as a spatial–spectral joint detection (SSJD)
    problem, which is further formulated into an optimization problem with the objective
    of maximizing the aggregate opportunistic throughput under constraints on the
    interference to primary users. Through mathematical reformulation, we derive two
    sets of suboptimal but efficient solutions for the optimization problem, which
    can considerably improve the sensing performance. The rest of the paper is organized
    as follows. In Section II, we describe the system model for wideband spectrum
    sensing. In Section III, we develop multiband joint detection algorithms for spectrum
    sensing, which seek to maximize the aggregate opportunistic throughput of a CR
    system. The spatial–spectral joint detection strategy is formulated in Section
    IV, where we derive two efficient solutions to optimize the cooperation among
    a network of CRs. The advantages of the proposed spectrum sensing algorithms are
    illustrated by simulations in Section V, and conclusions are drawn in Section
    VI. SECTION II. System Model A. Wideband Spectrum Sensing Consider a primary communication
    system (e.g., multicarrier modulation based) operating over a wideband channel
    that is divided into K nonoverlapping narrowband subbands. In a particular geographical
    region and within a particular time interval, some of the K subbands might not
    be used by the primary users and are available for opportunistic spectrum access.
    We model the detection problem on subband k as one of choosing between a hypothesis
    H 0,k (“0”), which represents the absence of primary signals, and an alternative
    hypothesis H 1,k (“1”), which represents the presence of primary signals. An example
    where only some of the K bands are occupied by primary users is depicted in Fig.
    1. The underlying hypothesis vector is a binary representation of the subbands
    that are allowed for or prohibited from opportunistic spectrum access. Fig. 1.
    Schematic illustration of the occupancy of a multiband channel. Show All The crucial
    task of spectrum sensing is to sense the K subbands and identify spectral holes
    for opportunistic use. For simplicity, we assume that the upper-layer protocols,
    e.g., the medium access control (MAC) layer, can guarantee that all cognitive
    radios stay silent during the detection interval such that the only spectral power
    remaining in the air is emitted by the primary users. In this paper, instead of
    considering a single band at a time, we propose to use a multiband joint detection
    technique, which jointly takes into account the detection of primary users across
    multiple frequency bands. B. Received Signal Consider a multipath fading environment,
    where h(l) , l=0,1,…,L−1 , represents the discrete-time channel impulse response
    between the primary transmitter and a CR receiver with L denoting the number of
    resolvable paths. The received baseband signal at the RF front-end can be written
    as r(n)= ∑ l=0 L−1 h(l)s(n−l)+v(n) (1) View Source where s(n) represents the primary
    transmitted signal (with cyclic prefix) at time n and v(n) is additive complex
    white Gaussian noise with zero mean and variance σ 2 v , i.e., v(n)∼CN(0, σ 2
    v ) . In a multipath fading environment, the wideband channel exhibits frequency-selective
    features [27] and its discrete frequency response can be obtained through a K
    -point fast Fourier transform (FFT) (K≥L) : H k = 1 K − − √ ∑ n=0 L−1 h(n) e −j2πnk/K
    ,k=1,2,…,K. (2) View Source In the frequency domain, the received signal at each
    subchannel can be represented by its discrete Fourier transform (DFT): R k = =
    1 K − − √ ∑ n=0 K−1 r(n) e −j2πnk/K H k S k + V k ,k=1,2,…,K (3) View Source where
    S k is the primary transmitted signal at subchannel k and V k = 1 K − − √ ∑ n=0
    K−1 v(n) e −j2πnk/K ,k=1,2,…,K (4) View Source is the received noise represented
    in the frequency domain. The random variables { V k } are independent and normally
    distributed with zero means and variances σ 2 v , i.e., V k ∼CN(0, σ 2 v ) , since
    v(n)∼CN(0, σ 2 v ) and the DFT is a linear unitary operation. Without loss of
    generality, we assume that the transmitted signal S k , channel gain H k , and
    additive noise V k are independent of each other. Since the IEEE 802.22 consumer
    premise equipment (CPE) is generally used in a fixed wireless network in the TV
    bands [28], it is reasonable to assume that the channels between the primary transmitter
    and secondary receivers change slowly such that they can be assumed to be constant
    during each operation period of interest. Our sensing algorithm needs to know
    only the noise power σ 2 v and the squared values of the channel frequency responses
    {| H k | 2 } , which can be estimated in practice. Specifically, σ 2 v can be
    calibrated in a given band that is known for sure to be idle (e.g., TV channel
    37 is currently always empty) [29]. Accordingly, {| H k | 2 } can be learned a
    priori during a period when the primary transmitter was known for sure to be working.
    This a priori information is obtainable since most current TV stations transmit
    pilot signals periodically at a fixed power level. C. Signal Detection in Individual
    Bands We start from signal detection in a single narrowband subband, which will
    constitute a building block for our multiband joint detection procedure. Following
    [21], [23], to decide whether the k th subband is occupied or not, we test the
    following binary hypotheses: H 0,k : R k = H 1,k : R k = V k H k S k + V k , (5)
    View Source where R k is the secondary received signal, S k is the primary transmitted
    signal, and H k is the channel gain between the primary transmitter and the secondary
    receiver. For each subband k , we compute the summary statistic as the sum of
    received signal energy over an interval of M samples, i.e., Y k = Δ ∑ n=1 M |
    R k (n)| 2 ,k=1,2,…,K (6) View Source and the decision rule is chosen as Y k ⋛
    H 0,k H 1,k γ k ,k=1,2,…,K (7) View Source where γ k is the decision threshold
    of subband k . For simplicity, we assume that the transmitted signal in each subband
    has unit power, i.e., E[| S k | 2 ]=1 ; this assumption holds when primary radios
    adopt uniform power transmission strategies given no channel knowledge at the
    transmitter side. However, the development of the multiband joint detection algorithm
    does not rely on this assumption while only the knowledge of the received signal
    power and noise power is needed. According to the central limit theorem [30],
    for large M , the statistics { Y k } K k=1 are approximately normally distributed
    [5] with means E[ Y k ]={ M σ 2 v , M( σ 2 v +| H k | 2 ), H 0,k H 1,k (8) View
    Source and variances Var( Y k )={ 2M σ 4 v , 2M( σ 2 v +2| H k | 2 ) σ 2 v , H
    0,k H 1,k . (9) View Source Thus, we can write these approximate statistics compactly
    as Y k ∼N(E[ Y k ],Var( Y k )) . Using the decision rule in (7), the probabilities
    of false alarm and detection in the k th subband can be approximately expressed
    as P (k) f ( γ k )=Pr( Y k > γ k | H 0,k )=Q( γ k −M σ 2 v σ 2 v 2M − − − √ )
    (10) View Source and P (k) d ( γ k )=Pr( Y k > γ k | H 1,k )=Q ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ γ k −M( σ
    2 v +| H k | 2 ) σ v 2M( σ 2 v +2| H k | 2 ) − − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ ⎤ ⎦
    ⎥ . (11) View Source Note that the SNR of such an energy detector is defined as
    SNR=| H k | 2 / σ 2 v , which plays an important role in determining the detection
    performance. The choice of the threshold γ k leads to a tradeoff between the probability
    of false alarm and the probability of missed detection, P (k) m ( γ k )=1− P (k)
    d ( γ k ) . Specifically, a higher threshold will result in a smaller probability
    of false alarm, but a larger probability of miss, and vice versa. The probabilities
    of false alarm and miss have unique implications for CR networks. Low probabilities
    of false alarm are necessary to maintain high spectral utilization in CR systems,
    since a false alarm would prevent the unused spectral segments from being accessed
    by secondary users. On the other hand, the probability of missed detection measures
    the interference of secondary users to the primary users, which should be limited
    in opportunistic spectrum access. These implications are based on a typical assumption
    that if primary signals are detected, the secondary users will not use the corresponding
    channel, and if no primary signals are detected, then the corresponding frequency
    band will be used by secondary users. SECTION III. Multiband Joint Detection In
    this section, we present the multiband joint detection framework for wideband
    spectrum sensing [31], as illustrated in Fig. 2. The design objective is to find
    the optimal threshold vector γ=[ γ 1 , γ 2 ,…, γ K ] T so that the cognitive radio
    system can make efficient use of the unused spectral segments without causing
    harmful interference to the primary users. For a given threshold vector γ , the
    probabilities of false alarm and detection can be compactly represented as P f
    (γ)= [ P (1) f ( γ 1 ), P (2) f ( γ 2 ),…, P (K) f ( γ K )] T (12) View Source
    and P d (γ)= [ P (1) d ( γ 1 ), P (2) d ( γ 2 ),…, P (K) d ( γ K )] T . (13) View
    Source Similarly, the probabilities of missed detection can be written in a vector
    as P m (γ)= [ P (1) m ( γ 1 ), P (2) m ( γ 2 ),…, P (K) m ( γ K )] T . (14) View
    Source The vector P m can be expressed as P m (γ)=1− P d (γ) , where 1 denotes
    the all-one vector. Fig. 2. Schematic representation of multiband joint detection
    for wideband spectrum sensing in cognitive radio systems. Show All Consider a
    CR device sensing the K narrowband subbands to take use of the unused ones for
    opportunistic transmission. Let r k denote the throughput achievable over the
    k th subband if used by secondary users, and r=[ r 1 , r 2 ,…, r K ] T . If the
    transmit power and the channel gains between secondary users are known, r can
    be estimated using the Shannon capacity formula [27]. Since 1− P (k) f measures
    the opportunistic spectral utilization of subband k , the aggregate opportunistic
    throughput of the CR system can be defined as R(γ)= r T [1− P f (γ)] (15) View
    Source which is a function of the threshold vector γ . Due to the inherent tradeoff
    between P (k) f ( γ k ) and P (k) m ( γ k ) , maximizing the sum rate R(γ) will
    result in large P m (γ) , hence causing harmful interference to primary users.
    However, the interference to primary users should be limited in a CR network.
    For a wideband primary communication system, the effect of interference induced
    by CR devices can be characterized by a relative priority factor for each primary
    user transmitting over the corresponding subbands, i.e., c=[ c 1 , c 2 ,…, c K
    ] T , where c k indicates the cost incurred if the primary user in subband k is
    interfered with. In a special case where the j th primary user is equally important,
    we may have c=1 . Suppose that J primary users share a portion of the K subbands
    and each primary user occupies a subset S j of subbands. The aggregate interference
    to primary user j can be expressed as ∑ i∈ S j c i P (i) m ( γ i ). (16) View
    Source This expression models, for example, the situation arising in a multiuser
    orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system, where various primary
    users have different levels of priority. Alternatively, c k can be defined as
    a function of the bandwidth of subband k since in some applications each particular
    subband does not have to occupy an equal amount of bandwidth. To summarize, our
    objective is to find the optimal thresholds { γ k } K k=1 for the K subbands in
    order to collectively maximize the aggregate opportunistic throughput subject
    to some interference constraints for each primary user. As such, the opportunistic
    rate optimization problem in the context of a multiuser primary system can be
    formulated as max γ R(γ)(P1) s.t. ∑ i∈ S j c i P (i) m ( γ i )≤ ε j ,j=1,2,…,J   P
    m (γ)⪯α   P f (γ)⪯β (17) (18) View Source where the constraint (17) limits the
    interference in each subband with α=[ α 1 , α 2 ,…, α K ] T , and the constraint
    (18) dictates that each subband should be able to achieve a minimum opportunistic
    spectral utilization given by [1− β 1 ,1− β 2 ,…,1− β K ] T . For a single-user
    primary system where all the subbands are used by one primary user, we have J=1
    . Intuitively, some factors need to be considered in the multiband joint detection.
    First, the subband with a higher opportunistic rate r k should have a higher threshold
    γ k (i.e., a smaller probability of false alarm) such that it can be best used
    by CRs. Second, the subband that carries a higher priority primary user should
    have a lower threshold γ k (i.e., a smaller probability of missed detection) in
    order to prevent opportunistic access by secondary users. Third, a little compromise
    on those subbands carrying less important primary users might boost the opportunistic
    rate considerably. Thus, in the determination of the optimal threshold vector,
    it is necessary to strike a balance among the channel conditions, the opportunistic
    throughput, and the relative priority of each subband. The objective and constraint
    functions in (P1) are generally nonconvex, making it difficult to efficiently
    solve for the global optimum. In most cases, suboptimal solutions or heuristics
    have to be used. However, we find that this seemingly nonconvex problem can be
    made convex by exploiting hidden convexity properties and reformulating the problem.
    The fact that the Q -function is monotonically nonincreasing allows us to transform
    the constraints in (17) and (18) into linear constraints. Specifically, from (17),
    we obtain 1− P (k) d ( γ k )≤ α k k=1,2,…,K. (19) View Source Substituting (11)
    into (19) gives γ k ≤ γ max,k ,k=1,2,…,K (20) View Source where γ max,k = Δ M(
    σ 2 v +| H k | 2 ) + σ v 2M( σ 2 v +2| H k | 2 ) − − − − − − − − − − − − − − √
    Q −1 (1− α k ).(21) View Source Similarly, the combination of (10) and (18) leads
    to γ k ≥ γ min,k ,k=1,2,…,K (22) View Source where γ min,k = σ 2 v [M+ 2M − −
    − √ Q −1 ( β k )]. (23) View Source Consequently, the original problem (P1) has
    the following equivalent form min ∑ k=1 K r k P (k) f ( γ k )(P2) s.t. ∑ i∈ S
    j c i P (i) m ( γ i )≤ ε j ,j=1,2,…,J  γ min,k ≤ γ k ≤ γ max,k ,k=1,2,…,K. (24)
    (25) View Source Although the constraint (25) is linear, the problem is still
    nonconvex. However, it can be transformed into a tractable convex optimization
    problem in the regime of low probabilities of false alarm and miss. To establish
    the transformation, we need the following results. Lemma 1 The function P (k)
    f ( γ k ) is convex in γ k if P (k) f ( γ k )≤1/2 . Proof Refer to Appendix A.
    ■  Lemma 2 The function P (k) m ( γ k ) is convex in γ k if P (k) m ( γ k )≤1/2
    . Proof Refer to Appendix B. ■  Recall that the nonnegative weighted sum of a
    set of convex functions is also convex [32]. The problem (P1) then becomes a convex
    program if we introduce the following conditions: 0< α k ≤1/2 and 0< β k ≤1/2,k=1,2,…,K.
    (26) View Source This regime of probabilities of false alarm and missed detection
    is of practical interest for achieving rational opportunistic throughput and interference
    levels in CR networks. Under the conditions in (26), the feasible set of problem
    (P2) is convex because the intersection of a convex set and a set of halfspaces
    is also convex. The optimization problem takes the form of minimizing a convex
    function subject to a convex constraint, and thus a local optimum is also the
    global optimum. Efficient numerical search algorithms such as the interior-point
    method can be used to find the optimal solution [32]. Alternatively, we can formulate
    the multiband joint detection problem into another optimization problem that minimizes
    the interference from CRs to the primary communication system subject to some
    constraints on the aggregate opportunistic throughput, i.e., min γ c T P m (γ)(P3)
    s.t.   r T [1− P f (γ)]≥δ P m (γ)⪯α P f (γ)⪯β View Source where δ is the minimum
    required aggregate opportunistic throughput. Like (P1), this problem can be transformed
    into a convex optimization problem by enforcing the conditions in (26). The result
    will be illustrated numerically later in Section V. SECTION IV. Spatial–Spectral
    Joint Detection The detection performance of spectrum sensing is usually compromised
    by destructive channel conditions between the target-under-detection and the CRs,
    since it is hard to distinguish between a white spectrum and a weak signal attenuated
    by deep fading. In such scenarios, a network of cooperative CR devices, which
    experience different channel conditions from the target, would have a better chance
    of detecting the primary signal if they combine their sensing results. In this
    section, we present a cooperation framework for wideband spectrum sensing, within
    which CRs can exploit spatial diversity by exchanging local sensing results in
    order for the secondary network to obtain a more accurate estimate of the unused
    frequency bands [33]. Suppose that N spatially distributed CRs collaboratively
    sense a wide frequency band, aiming to find unused spectral segments for opportunistic
    communication. By combining the summary statistics from individual CRs, a fusion
    center, which could be one of the CRs, makes the final decision on the presence
    or absence of primary signals in each of the K subbands. We propose a linear weighting
    fusion scheme as illustrated in Fig. 3. It is assumed that there is a control
    channel, through which the summary statistics of individual secondary users are
    transmitted to the fusion center. Fig. 3. Weighting cooperation for spectrum sensing
    in the k th subband. Show All Let Y k (n) denote the summary statistic of the
    n th secondary user in the k th subband. For each subband, the statistics from
    individual secondary users can be written in a vector as Y k =[ Y k (1), Y k (2),…,
    Y k (N) ] T . The statistics across the K subbands can be compactly represented
    in matrix form as follows: Y= = [ Y 1 Y 2 … Y K ] ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ Y 1 (1) Y 1 (2)

    ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ . (27) View Source To exploit the spatial diversity, we linearly combine
    the summary statistics from spatially distributed CRs in each subband k to obtain
    a global test statistic z k = ∑ n=1 N w k (n) Y k (n)= w T k Y k (28) View Source
    where w k =[ w k (1), w k (2),…, w k (N) ] T are the combining coefficients for
    subband k , which can be compactly written as W= = [ w 1 w 2 … w K ] ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢

    the channel gains between the primary transmitter and secondary receivers on each

    is a positive semidefinite matrix. In order to decide the presence or absence
    of the primary signal in subband k , we use the following binary test: z k ⋛ H

    Source In the design of an efficient distributed cooperative sensing system, the
    goal is to maximize the system performance measure of interest by controlling
    the weight coefficient matrix W and the threshold vector γ . Just as we did in
    the previous section, we would like to maximize the opportunistic rate while satisfying
    some constraints on the interference to the primary communication system. Note
    that the aggregate opportunistic throughput of the K subbands is now a function
    of both the threshold vector γ and the weight coefficient matrix W , i.e., R(W,γ)=
    r T [1− P f (W,γ)]. (36) View Source Consequently, the spatial–spectral joint
    detection problem is formulated as max W,γ R(W,γ)(P4)  s.t.   c T P m (W,γ)≤ε  P
    m (W,γ)⪯α  P f (W,γ)⪯β. (37) (38) (39) View Source Note that the formulation in
    (P4) is in the context of a single-user primary system and it can be easily extended
    to the case of a multiuser primary system as (P1) does. Finding the exact optimal
    solution for the above problem is difficult, since for any subband, the probabilities
    of false alarm and miss are neither convex nor concave functions of the weight
    coefficients w k and the test threshold γ k according to (34) and (35). In the
    following, we will develop two efficient methods for solving for the weight coefficients
    W and the thresholds γ , which lead to near-optimal solutions for (P4). For consistency,
    we still assume the practical conditions in (26) unless explicitly stated otherwise.
    A. Joint Optimization To jointly optimize W and γ , we show that (P4) can be reformulated
    into an equivalent form with a convex feasible set and an objective function lower
    bounded by a concave function. Through maximizing the lower bound of the objective
    function, we are able to obtain a good approximation to the optimal solution of
    the original problem. First, we show how to transform the nonconvex constraints
    in (38) and (39) into convex constraints by exploiting the monotonicity of the
    Q -function. Substituting (34) into the constraint (39), we have Q −1 ( β k )

    as 2M w T k Σ k w k − − − − − − − − − − √ ≤ γ k −M w T k ( σ 2 v 1+ G k ) σ v
    Q −1 (1− α k ) (41) View Source for k=1,2,…,K , since α k ≤1/2 and Q −1 (1− α
    k )≤0 . It is implied by (40) and (41) that M σ 2 v w T k 1≤ γ k ≤M w T k ( σ
    2 v 1+ G k ). (42) View Source Observing that the left-hand side on the constraint
    (40) is a convex function and the right-hand side is a linear function, (40) defines
    a convex set for { γ k , w k } . Similarly, (41) is also a convex constraint.
    Then, we reformulate problem (P4) by introducing a new variable μ k = σ v 2M w
    T k Σ k w k − − − − − − − − − − √ . (43) View Source Define γ ′ k = γ k / μ k

    Implied by the practical conditions in (26), this problem is a convex optimization
    problem and can be efficiently solved. B. Sequential Optimization Here, we present
    another heuristic approach that divides the optimization of the original problem
    (P4) into two stages. In the first stage, referred to as spatial optimization,
    we choose the weight coefficients W in order to maximize a performance measure
    for signal detection. In the second phase, called spectral optimization, we fix
    the values of W obtained from spatial optimization and optimize the thresholds
    γ across all the subbands. 1. Spatial Optimization A good measure for evaluating
    the detection performance, called the modified deflection coefficient [21], [23],
    is defined as d 2 k ( w k )= (E[ z k | H 1,k ]−E[ z k | H 0,k ]) 2 Var( z k |
    H 1,k ) = M ( w T k G k ) 2 2 σ 2 v w T k Σ k w k . (52) View Source The quantity
    d 2 k ( w k ) can be interpreted as a signal-to-noise ratio. For any given probability
    of false alarm, a larger value of d 2 k ( w k ) will result in a larger probability
    of detection if z k is normally distributed under both hypotheses H 0,k and H
    1,k . In the spatial optimization, we would like to choose the weight coefficients
    w k in order to achieve the maximum modified deflection coefficient for each subband.
    Note that the feasible set for maximizing d 2 k ( w k ) is unbounded. To obtain
    a unique solution, we confine the weight vector to be on the unit-norm ball and
    pose max w k d 2 k ( w k )(P6) s.t.∥ w k ∥ 2 =1 View Source for k=1,2,…,K . This

    solutions can be obtained using the same techniques as in solving (P4). SECTION
    V. Simulation Results In this section, we numerically evaluate the proposed spectrum
    sensing schemes. Consider a 48-MHz primary system where the wideband channel is
    equally divided into eight subbands. For each subband k (1≤k≤8) , we assume an
    achievable throughput rate r k if used by CRs and a cost coefficient c k indicating
    the penalty if the primary signal is interfered with by secondary users. It is
    expected that the opportunistic spectrum utilization is at least 50%, i.e., β
    k =0.5 , and the probability that the primary user is interfered with is at most
    α k =0.2 . For simplicity it is assumed that the noise power level is σ 2 v =1
    , and the length of each detection interval is M=100 . A. Example 1: Multiband
    Joint Detection for Individual CRs This example studies multiband joint detection
    in a single CR. The proposed spectrum sensing algorithms are examined by comparing
    with an approach that searches for a uniform threshold to maximize the aggregate
    opportunistic throughput. We consider a power delay profile, as given in Table
    I, that specifies the frequency selective channel between the primary transmitter
    and the secondary receiver. The channel gain, opportunistic rate, and interference
    penalty on each subband are given in Table II. Table I Power Delay Profile in
    Example 1 Table II Other Parameters Used in Example 1 We would like to maximize
    the aggregate opportunistic throughput over the eight subbands subject to the
    constraints on the interference to the primary users, as formulated in (P1). Fig.
    4 plots the maximum aggregate opportunistic rates against the aggregate interference
    to the primary communication system. It can be seen that the multiband joint detection
    algorithm with optimized thresholds can achieve a much higher opportunistic rate
    than that achieved by the uniform threshold method. That is, the proposed multiband
    joint detection makes better use of the wide frequency band by balancing the conflict
    between improving spectral utilization and reducing the interference. In addition,
    it is observed that the aggregate opportunistic rate increases as we relax the
    constraint on the aggregate interference ε . Fig. 4. The aggregate opportunistic
    throughput versus the constraint on the aggregate interference to the primary
    communication system. Show All An alternative example is depicted in Fig. 5, showing
    the numerical results of minimizing the aggregate interference subject to the
    constraints on the aggregate opportunistic throughput as formulated in (P3). It
    can be observed that the multiband joint detection strategy outperforms the one
    using uniform thresholds in terms of the induced interference to the primary users
    for any given opportunistic throughput target. For illustration purposes, the
    optimized thresholds and the associated probabilities of missed detection and
    false alarm are given in Fig. 6 for (P1) and (P3). Fig. 5. The aggregate interference
    to the primary communication system versus the constraint on the aggregate opportunistic
    throughput. Show All Fig. 6. The optimized thresholds and the associated probabilities
    of missed detection and false alarm on individual subbands: (P1) ε=1.474 and (P3)

    this example, we consider the case in which two CRs cooperatively sense the eight
    subbands by exchanging the summary statistics of their sensed data. We compare
    the two proposed spatial–spectral joint detection schemes with the multiband joint
    detection algorithms performed individually without cooperation. The two CRs experience
    different channel models as specified in Table III. Other parameters are given
    in Table IV. The numerical results of solving (P4), which maximizes the aggregate
    opportunistic throughput subject to the constraints on the aggregate interference,
    are illustrated in Fig. 7. It is observed that the spectrum sensing algorithms
    with cooperation result in higher opportunistic rates than the sensing algorithms
    without cooperation. In Fig. 8, we examine the problem (P8), which minimizes the
    aggregate interference under the constraints on the minimum aggregate opportunistic
    throughput. Similarly, the algorithms with cooperation perform much better than
    those without cooperation, and the joint optimization outperforms the sequential
    optimization. Fig. 7. The aggregate opportunistic throughput versus the constraint
    on the aggregate interference to the primary communication system. Show All Fig.
    8. The aggregate interference to the primary communication system versus the constraint
    on the aggregate opportunistic throughput. Show All Table III Power Delay Profiles
    in Example 2 Table IV Other Parameters Used in Example 2 Generally speaking, these
    numerical results show that multiband joint detection can improve the spectral
    efficiency considerably by making better use of the spectral diversity, and the
    spatial–spectral joint detection strategies can further enhance the system performance
    by exploiting the spatial diversity. SECTION VI. Conclusion In this paper, we
    have proposed multiband joint detection for wideband spectrum sensing in CR networks.
    The basic strategy is to take into account the detection of primary users jointly
    across a bank of narrowband subbands rather than considering only one single band
    at a time. We have formulated the joint detection problem into a class of optimization
    problems to improve the spectral efficiency and reduce the interference. By exploiting
    the hidden convexity in the seemingly nonconvex problem formulations, we have
    obtained the optimal solution under practical conditions. In addition, we have
    presented a spatial–spectral joint detection strategy for cooperative wideband
    spectrum sensing, in which spatially distributed CRs can collaborate with each
    other to improve the sensing reliability by exchanging the individual sensing
    statistics. We have provided efficient suboptimal solutions for the problems that
    jointly optimize the cooperation among spatially distributed secondary users and
    the decision thresholds over multiple bands. The proposed spectrum sensing algorithms
    have been examined numerically and have been shown to perform well. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

    Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: A cognitive radio network (CRN) is formed
    by either allowing the secondary users (SUs) in a secondary communication network
    (SCN) to opportunistically operate in the frequency bands originally allocated
    to a primary communication network (PCN) or by allowing SCN to coexist with the
    primary users (PUs) in PCN as long as the interference caused by SCN to each PU
    is properly regulated. In this paper, we consider the latter case, known as spectrum
    sharing, and study the optimal power allocation strategies to achieve the ergodic
    capacity and the outage capacity of the SU fading channel under different types
    of power constraints and fading channel models. In particular, besides the interference
    power constraint at PU, the transmit power constraint of SU is also considered.
    Since the transmit power and the interference power can be limited either by a
    peak or an average constraint, various combinations of power constraints are studied.
    It is shown that there is a capacity gain for SU under the average over the peak
    transmit/interference power constraint. It is also shown that fading for the channel
    between SU transmitter and PU receiver is usually a beneficial factor for enhancing
    the SU channel capacities. Published in: IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications

    SECTION I. Introduction Radio spectrum is a precious and limited resource for
    wireless communication networks. With the emergence of new wireless applications,
    the currently deployed spectrum is becoming increasingly more crowded. Hence,
    how to accommodate more wireless services within the limited spectrum becomes
    a challenging problem. On the other hand, according to the report published by
    the Federal Communication Commission (FCC), most of the allocated spectrum today
    is under-utilized [1]. This fact indicates that it is perhaps the inefficient
    and inflexible spectrum allocation policy rather than the physical shortage of
    spectrum that causes the spectrum scarcity. Cognitive radio (CR) [2] is a promising
    technology to deal with the spectrum under-utilization problem caused by the current
    inflexible spectrum allocation policy. In a cognitive radio network (CRN), a secondary
    user (SU) in the secondary communication network (SCN) is allowed to access the
    spectrum that is originally allocated to the primary users (PUs) when the spectrum
    is not used by any PU. This secondary spectrum usage method is called opportunistic
    spectrum access [3]. In this way, the spectrum utilization efficiency can be greatly
    improved. However, to precisely detect a vacant spectrum is not an easy task [4].
    Alternatively, CRN can also be designed to allow simultaneous transmission of
    PUs and SUs. From PU''s perspective, SU is allowed to transmit as long as the
    interference from SU does not degrade the quality of service (QoS) of PU to an
    unacceptable level. From SU''s perspective, SU should control its transmit power
    properly in order to achieve a reasonably high transmission rate without causing
    too much interference to PU. This transmission strategy is termed as spectrum
    sharing [5]. Traditionally, the capacity of fading channels is studied under various
    transmit power constraints, and the corresponding optimal and suboptimal power
    allocation policies are given in, e.g., [6], [7], [8]. Recently, study on the
    channel capacity of SU link under spectrum sharing has attracted a lot of attention.
    Specifically, SU channel capacity under spectrum sharing was addressed by Gastpar
    in [9], where the capacities of different additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)
    channels are derived under a received power constraint. The capacities derived
    in [9] are shown to be quite similar to those under a transmit power constraint.
    This is non-surprising because the ratio of the received power to the transmit
    power is fixed in an AWGN channel; thus, considering a received power constraint
    is equivalent to considering a transmit power constraint. However, in the presence
    of fading, the situation becomes quite different. In [5], the authors derived
    the optimal power allocation strategy for a SU coexisting with a PU subject to
    an interference power constraint at PU receiver, and evaluated the ergodic capacity
    for SU channel for different fading channel models. In [10], the authors considered
    the outage capacity under both the peak and the average interference power constraints.
    It is noted that optimal design of SU transmission strategy under interference-power
    constraints at PU receivers has also been studied in [11] for multi-antenna CR
    transmitters, and in [12] for multiple CR transmitters in a multiple-access channel
    (MAC). In this paper, we study the ergodic capacity, the delay-limited capacity,
    and the outage capacity of SU block-fading (BF) channels under spectrum sharing.
    For a BF channel [13], [14], the channel remains constant during each transmission
    block, but possibly changes from one block to another. For BF channels, the ergodic
    capacity is defined as the maximum achievable rate averaged over all the fading
    blocks. Ergodic capacity is a good performance limit indicator for delay-insensitive
    services, when the codeword length can be sufficiently long to span over all the
    fading blocks. However, for real-time applications, it is more appropriate to
    consider the delay-limited capacity introduced in [15], which is defined as the
    maximum constant transmission rate achievable over each of the fading blocks.
    For certain severe fading scenarios, such as Rayleigh fading, however, the delay-limited
    capacity can be zero. Thus, for such scenarios, the outage capacity [13], [14],
    which is defined as the maximum constant rate that can be maintained over fading
    blocks with a given outage probability, will be a good choice. In this paper,
    we derive the optimal power allocation strategies for SU to achieve aforementioned
    capacities. Besides the interference power constraint to protect PU, we also consider
    the transmit power constraint of SU transmitter. Since the transmit power and
    the interference power can be limited either by a peak or an average constraint,
    different combinations of power constraints are considered. It is shown that there
    is a capacity gain for SU under the average over the peak transmit/interference
    power constraint. Furthermore, we provide closed-form solutions for the delay-limited
    capacity and the outage probability under several typical channel fading models,
    including Rayleigh fading, Nakagami fading, and Log-normal fading. It is observed
    that fading for the channel between SU transmitter and PU receiver can be a beneficial
    factor for enhancing the SU channel capacities. The rest of the paper is organized
    as follows. Section II describes the system model and presents various transmit
    and interference power constraints. Then, the ergodic capacity, the delay-limited
    capacity, and the outage capacity under different combinations of peak/average
    transmit and interference power constraints are studied in Section III, Section
    IV, and Section V, respectively. In Section VI, the simulation results are presented
    and discussed. Finally, Section VII concludes the paper. Notation: E[⋅] denotes
    the statistical expectation. K denotes the constant log 2 e , where e is the base
    of natural logarithm. max(x,y) and min(x,y) denote the maximum and the minimum
    element between x and y , respectively. (⋅ ) + stands for max(0,⋅) . The symbol
    ≜ means “defined as”. SECTION II. System Model and Power Constraints A. System
    model As illustrated in Fig. 1, we consider a spectrum sharing network with one
    PU and one SU. The link between SU transmitter (SU-Tx) and PU receiver (PU-Rx)
    is assumed to be a flat fading channel with instantaneous channel power gain g
    0 and the AWGN n 0 . SU channel between SU-Tx and SU receiver (SU-Rx) is also
    a flat fading channel characterized by instantaneous channel power gain g 1 and
    the AWGN n 1 . The noises n 0 and n 1 are assumed to be independent random variables
    with the distribution CN(0, N 0 ) (circularly symmetric complex Gaussian variable
    with mean zero and variance N 0 ) . The channel power gains, g 0 and g 1 , are
    assumed to be ergodic and stationary with probability density function (PDF) f
    0 ( g 0 ) , and f 1 ( g 1 ) , respectively. Perfect channel state information
    (CSI) on g 0 and g 1 is assumed to be available at SU-Tx. Furthermore, it is assumed
    that the interference from PU-Tx to SU-Rx can be ignored or considered in the
    AWGN at SU-Rx. Fig. 1. System model for spectrum sharing in cognitive radio networks.

    constraint and average transmit power constraint, either individually [14] or
    simultaneously [16]. The peak power limitation may be due to the nonlinearity
    of power amplifiers in practice, while the average power is restricted below a
    certain level to keep the long-term power budget. In this paper, we denote the
    instantaneous transmit power at SU-Tx for the channel gain pair ( g 0 , g 1 )
    as P( g 0 , g 1 ) , and obviously it follows P( g 0 , g 1 )≥0,∀( g 0 , g 1 ).
    (1) View Source Let P pk be the peak transmit power limit and P av be the average
    transmit power limit. The peak transmit power constraint can then be represented
    by P( g 0 , g 1 )≤ P pk ,∀( g 0 , g 1 ), (2) View Source and the average transmit
    power constraint can be represented by E[P( g 0 , g 1 )]≤ P av . (3) View Source
    On the other hand, motivated by the interference temperature concept in [3], researchers
    have investigated SU channel capacities with received power constraints. If PU
    provides delay-insensitive services, an average received power constraint can
    be used to guarantee a long-term QoS of PU. Let Q av denote the average received
    power limit at PU-Rx. The average interference power constraint can then be written
    as E[ g 0 P( g 0 , g 1 )]≤ Q av . (4) View Source If the service provided by PU
    has an instantaneous QoS requirement, the peak interference power constraint may
    be more appropriate. Let Q pk denote the peak received power at the PU-Rx. The
    peak interference power constraint can then be written as g 0 P( g 0 , g 1 )≤
    Q pk ,∀( g 0 , g 1 ). (5) View Source For the purpose of exposition, we combine
    the transmit power constraint with the interference power constraint, and obtain
    the following four sets of power constraints: F 1 ≜{P( g 0 , g 1 ):(1),(2),(5)},
    F 2 ≜{P( g 0 , g 1 ):(1),(2),(4)}, F 3 ≜{P( g 0 , g 1 ):(1),(3),(5)}, F 4 ≜{P(
    g 0 , g 1 ):(1),(3),(4)}. (6) (7) (8) (9) View Source SECTION III. Ergodic Capacity
    For BF channels, ergodic capacity is defined as the maximum achievable rate averaged
    over all the fading blocks. Using a similar approach as in [6], the ergodic capacity
    of the secondary link can be obtained by solving the following optimization problem,
    P( g 0 , g 1 )∈FmaxE[ log 2 (1+ g 1 P( g 0 , g 1 ) N 0 )], (10) View Source where
    F∈{ F 1 , F 2 , F 3 , F 4 } , and the expectation is taken over ( g 0 , g 1 )
    . In what follows, we will study (10) under F 1 , F 2 , F 3 , and F 4 , respectively.
    A. Peak transmit power constraint and peak interference power constraint In this
    case, F in (10) becomes F 1 . The two constraints in F 1 can be combined as P(
    g 0 , g 1 )≤min{ P pk , Q pk g0 } . Therefore, the capacity is maximized by transmitting
    at the maximum instantaneous power expressed as P( g 0 , g 1 )= ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ P pk , Q
    p k g0 , g 0 ≤ Q pk P pk otherwise (11) View Source From (11), it is observed
    that, when g 0 is less than a given threshold, SU-Tx can transmit at its maximum
    power, P pk , which satisfies the interference power constraint at PU-Rx. This
    indicates that sufficiently severe fading of the channel between SU-Tx and PU-Rx
    is good from both viewpoints of protecting PU-Rx and maximizing SU throughput.
    However, when g 0 becomes larger than this threshold, SU-Tx transmits with decreasing
    power values that are inversely proportional to g 0 . B. Peak transmit power constraint
    and average interference power constraint In this case, F in (10) becomes F 2
    . The optimal power allocation is given by the following theorem. Theorem 1:The
    optimal solution of (10) subject to the power constraints given in F 2 : is P(
    g 0 , g 1 )= ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ 0, K λg0 − N 0 λ N 0 , P pk , g 0 ≥ K g
    1 λ N 0 K g 1 λ N 0 > g 0 > K λ( P pk + N 0 g 1 ) , g 0 ≤ K λ( P pk + N 0 g 1
    ) (12) View Source where λ is the nonnegative dual variable associated with (4)
    in F 2 . If (4) in F 2 is satisfied with strict inequality, λ must be zero. Otherwise,
    λ can be obtained by substituting (12) into the constraint E [ g 0 P( g 0 , g
    1 )]= Q av . Proof:See Appendix A. ■ As can be seen from (12), if P pk is sufficiently
    large, the power allocation scheme reduces to that in [5], where the ergodic capacity
    of fading channels is studied under the interference power constraint only. It
    is also noticed that the power allocation scheme given by (12) has the same structure
    as that in [16], where the ergodic capacity of fading channels is studied under
    both peak and average transmit power constraints. The main difference is that
    the power allocation scheme given by (12) is not only related to SU channel but
    also related to the channel between SU-Tx and PU-Rx. C. Average transmit power
    constraint and peak interference power constraint In this case, F in (10) becomes
    F 3 . The optimal power allocation of this problem is given by the following theorem.
    Theorem 2:The optimal solution of (10) subject to the constraints given in F 3
    is P( g 0 , g 1 )= ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ 0, K λ − N 0 g 1 , Q pk g 0 , g 1
    ≥ λ N 0 K g 1 > λ N 0 K , g 0 < Q pk ( K λ − N 0 g 1 ) g 1 > λ N 0 K , g 0 ≥ Q
    pk ( K λ − N 0 g 1 ) , (13) View Source where λ is the nonnegative dual variable
    associated with (3) in F 3 . If (3) in F 3 is satisfied with strict inequality,
    λ must be zero. Otherwise, λ can be obtained by substituting (13) into the constraint
    E [P(q∩, q 1 )]= P av . Theorem 2 can be proved similarly as Theorem 1, we thus
    omit the details here for brevity. From (13), it is seen that, when the channel
    between SU-Tx and PU-Rx experiences sufficiently severe fading or Q pk is sufficiently
    large, the power allocation reduces to the conventional water-filling solution
    [6]. It is also observed that the power allocation given in (13) is capped by
    Q pk g0 , and this cap increases with decreasing g 0 . This indicates that fading
    for the channel between SU-Tx and PU-Rx enables SU-Tx to transmit more power under
    the same value of Q pk . D. Average transmit power constraint and average interference
    power constraint In this case, F in (10) becomes F 4 . The optimal solution for
    this problem can be obtained by applying similar techniques as for Theorem 1,
    which can be expressed as P( g 0 , g 1 )= ( K λ+μ g 0 − N 0 g 1 ) + , (14) View
    Source where λ and μ are the nonnegative dual variables associated with (3) and
    (4) in F 4 , respectively. If (3) or (4) in F 4 is satisfied with strict inequality,
    λ or μ must be zero correspondingly. Otherwise, λ and μ can be jointly determined
    by substituting (14) into the constraints Fi[P( g 0 , g 1 )]= P av and E[ g 0
    P( g 0 , g 1 )]= Q av . SECTION IV. Delay-limited Capacity For BF channels, delay-limited
    capacity [15] is defined as the maximum constant transmission rate achievable
    over each of the fading blocks. This is a good performance limit indicator for
    delay-sensitive services, which may require a constant rate transmission over
    all the fading blocks. Thus, the objective is to maximize such constant rate by
    adapting the transmit power of SU-Tx. At the same time, due to the coexistence
    with PU, the received interference power at the PU-Rx should not exceed the given
    threshold. In this section, the delay-limited capacity is studied under F 4 only.
    This is due to the fact that delay-limited capacity can be shown to be zero under
    the other three combinations of power constraints for realistic fading channel
    models. Therefore, the delay-limited capacity can be obtained by solving the following
    problem: max P( g 0 , g 1 )∈ F 4 log 2 (1+γ), s. t.  g 1 P( g 0 , g 1 ) N 0 =γ,∀(
    g 0 , g 1 ). (15) (16) View Source where γ is the constant received signal-to-noise
    ratio (SNR) at SU-Rx for all pairs of ( g 0 , g 1 ) . Obviously, the delay-limited
    capacity is achieved when γ takes its maximum value. Therefore, the above problem
    is equivalent to finding the maximum value of γ under the power constraints in
    F 4 . From (16), we have P( g 0 , g 1 )= γ N 0 g 1 . Substituting this into the
    power constraints given in F 4 yields γ≤ P av N 0 E[ 1 g 1 ] and γ≤ ∼ Q av N 0
    E[ g 0 g 1 ] ,∀( g 0 , g 1 ) . Therefore, γ max =min{ P a v N 0 E[ 1 g 1 ] , Q
    a v N 0 E[ g 0 g 1 ] } . The delay-limited capacity is thus given by C d =min
    ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ log 2 ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ 1+ P av N 0 E[ 1 g 1 ] ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ , log 2 ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ 1+ Q av N 0 E[
    g 0 g 1 ] ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎫ ⎭ ⎬ ⎪ ⎪ . (17) View Source By setting Q av =+∞ in (17), it is
    easy to obtain the delay-limited capacity for the conventional fading channels
    [14]. Similarly, by setting P av =+∞ , the delay-limited capacity under the interference
    power constraint only is obtained. In the following, the delay-limited capacity
    is evaluated under different fading channel models. A. Rayleigh fading For Rayleigh
    fading, the channel power gains g 0 and g 1 are exponentially distributed. Assume
    g 0 and g 1 are unit-mean and mutually independent. Then. E| 1 g 1 | can be evaluated
    equal to +∞ . Furthermore, the PDF of g 0 g 1 is expressed as [5] f g 1 g 1 (x)=
    1 (x+1 ) 2 ,x≥0. (18) View Source Hence, E[ g 0 g 1 ] can be shown to be +∝ ).
    Therefore, from (17), the delay-limited capacity is zero for Rayleigh fading channels.
    B. Nakagami fading Another widely used channel model is Nakagami- m fading. For
    a unit-mean Nakagami fading channel, the distribution of channel power gain follows
    the Gamma distribution, which is expressed as f g (x)= m m x (m−1) Γ(m) e −mx
    ,x≥0, (19) View Source where Γ(⋅) , is the Gamma function defined as Γ(x)= ∫ ∞
    0 t (x−1) e −t dt , and m(m≥1) is the ratio of the line-of-sight (LOS) signal
    power to that of the multi-path component. Then, by [17], E [ 1 g 1 ] is evaluated
    to be 1. If g 0 and g 1 are independent and have the same parameter m , the PDF
    of go g 1 is [18] f g 0 g 1 (x)= x m−1 B(m,m)(x+1 ) 2m ,x≥0, (20) View Source
    where B(a,b) , is the Beta function defined as B(a,b)= Γ(a)Γ(b) Γ(a+b) . Then
    E[ g 0 g 1 ] can be evaluated equal to m m−1 . Hence, the delay-limited capacity
    in (17) is obtained as C d =min{ log 2 (1+ P av N 0 ), log 2 (1+ Q av N 0 m m−1
    )}. (21) View Source By setting P av =+∞ , the delay-limited capacity under the
    interference power constraint only is obtained as C d = log 2 (1+ Q av N 0 m m−1
    ) . Furthermore, it is seen from (21) that the delay-limited capacity is determined
    by only the interference power constraint when P av ≥ m−1 m Q av . C. Log-normal
    shadowing In the log-normal fading environment, the channel power gain is modeled
    by a log-normal random variable (r.v.) e X where X is a zero-mean Gaussian r.v.
    with variance σ 2 . In this case, we model the channel by letting g 0 = e X 0
    and g 1 = e X 1 , where X 0 and X 1 are independently distributed with mean zero
    and variance σ 2 . Under the above assumptions, g 0 / g 1 = e Y is also log-normally
    distributed with Y= X 0 − X 1 being Gaussian distributed with mean zero and variance
    2 σ 2 [19]. In this case, E[ 1 g 1 ] and E [ g 0 g 1 ] are evaluated to be e σ
    2 2 and e σ 2 , respectively. Hence, the delay-limited capacity in (17) is given
    by C d =min{ log 2 (1+ P av N 0 e σ 2 2 ), log 2 (1+ Q av N 0 e σ 2 )}. (22) View
    Source By setting P av =+∞ , the delay-limited capacity under the interference
    power constraint only is obtained as C d = log 2 (1+ Q av N 0 e σ 2 ) . Furthermore,
    it is seen from (22) that the delay-limited capacity will not be affected by the
    transmit power constraint when P av ≥ e − σ 2 2 Q av . SECTION V. Outage Capacity
    For BF channels, outage capacity is defined as the maximum rate that can be maintained
    over the fading blocks with a given outage probability. Mathematically, this problem
    is defined as finding the optimal power allocation to achieve the maximum rate
    for a given outage probability, which is equivalent to minimizing the outage probability
    for a given transmission rate (outage capacity) r 0 , expressed as min P( g 0
    , g 1 )∈F Pr{ log 2 (1+ g 1 P( g 0 , g 1 ) N 0 )< r 0 }, (23) View Source where
    Pr{⋅} denotes the probability. In the following, we will study the problem (23)
    under F 1 , F 2 ,F3 , and F 4 , respectively. A. Peak transmit power constraint
    and peak interference power constraint In this case, F in (23) becomes F 1 . The
    optimal solution of this problem can be easily obtained as P( g 0 , g 1 )={ N
    0 ( 2 r 0 − 1) g 1 , 0, g 1 ≥ N 0 ( 2 r 0 − 1) P pk , g 0 ≤ g 1 Q pk N 0 ( 2 r
    0−1) therwise. (24) View Source Substituting (24) into (23), we get P out =1−
    ∫ +∞ N 0 ( 2 r 0−1) P pk ∫ g 1 Q pk N 0 ( 2 r 0−1) 0 f 0 ( g 0 ) f 1 ( g 1 )d
    g 0 d g 1 . (25) View Source It is seen that (24) has the similar structure as
    the truncated channel inversion [6] for the convenional fading channel. The difference
    between these two methods lies in that the condition in (24) for channel inversion
    is determined by both g 0 and g 1 , while that in [6] is by g 1 only. Therefore,
    we refer to this power allocation strategy as two-dimensional-truncated-channel-inversion
    (2D-TCI) over g 0 and g 1 . B. Peak transmit power constraint and average interference
    power constraint In this case, F in (23) becomes F 2 . The optimal solution of
    this problem is given by the following theorem. Theorem 3:The optimal solution
    of (23) subject to the power constraints given in F 2 is P( g 0 , g 1 )={ N 0
    ( 2 r 0 − 1) g 1 0, g 1 ≥ N 0 ( 2 r 0 − 1) P pk , g 0 < g 1 λ N 0 ( 2 r 0−1) otherwise
    , (26) View Source and the corresponding minimum outage probability is given by
    P out =1− ∫ +∞ N 0 ( 2 r 0−1) P pk ∫ g 1 λ N 0 ( 2 r 0−1) 0 f 0 ( g 0 ) f 1 (
    g 1 )d g 0 d g 1 , (27) View Source where λ is the nonnegative dual variable associated
    with (4) in F 2 . If (4) in P ∠ ∩ is satisfied with strict inequality, λ must
    be zero. Otherwise, λ can be obtained by substituting (26) into the constraint
    E[ g 0 P( g 0 , g 1 )]= Q av . Proof:See Appendix B. ■ It is seen that (26) has
    the same structure as that in (24). Therefore, the optimal power control policy
    obtained in (26) is also 2D-TCI. C. Average transmit power constraint and peak
    interference power constraint In this case, F in (23) becomes F 3 . The optimal
    solution of this problem is given by the following theorem. Theorem 4:The optimal
    solution of (23) subject to the power constraints given in F 3 is P( g 0 , g 1
    )={ N 0 ( 2 r 0 − 1) g 1 0, g 1 <λ N 0 ( 2 r 0 −1), g 0 ≤ g 1 λ N 0 ( 2 r 0−1)
    otherwise , (28) View Source and the corresponding minimum outage probability
    is given by P out =1− ∫ +∞ λ N 0 ( 2 r 0−1) ∫ g 1 Q pk N 0 ( 2 r 0−1) 0 f 0 (
    g 0 ) f 1 ( g 1 )d g 0 d g 1 , (29) View Source where λ is the nonnegative dual
    variable associated with (3) in F 3 . If (3) in P 3 is satisfied with strict inequality,
    λ must be zero. Otherwise, λ can be obtained by substituting (28) into the constraint
    E[P( g 0 , g 1 )]= P av , Theorem 4 can be proved similarly as Theorem 3; the
    proof is thus omitted here. Clearly, the power control policy given in (28) is
    also 2D-TCI. D. Average transmit power constraint and average interference power
    constraint In this case, F in (23) becomes F 4 . The optimal solution of (23)
    in this case is given by the following theorem. Theorem 5:The optimal solution
    of (23) subject to the power constraints given in P 4 is P( g 0 , g 1 )={ N 0
    ( 2 r 0 − 1) g 1 ,λ+μ g 0 < g 1 N 0 ( 2 r 0−1) 0,otherwise , (30) View Source
    where λ and μ are the nonnegative dual variables associated with (3) and (4) in
    F 4 , respectively. If (3) or (4) in τ 4 is satisfied with strict inequality,
    λ or μ must be zero correspondingly. Otherwise, λ and μ can be jointly determined
    by substituting (30) into the constraints E [P( g 0 , g 1 )]= P av and E[ g 0
    P( g 0 , g 1 )]= Q av . Theorem 5 can be proved similarly as Theorem 3. E. Analytical
    Results In this part, we provide the analytical results for the minimum outage
    probability under only the peak or the average interference power constraint.

    the minimum outage probability is evaluated under different fading models. a)
    Rayleigh fading Since g 1 g 0 has the same PDF as g 0 g 1 , with the PDF of g
    0 g 1 given in (18), we have P out = ∫ N 0 ( 2 r 0−1) Q pk 0 1 (x+1 ) 2 dx=1−
    Q pk N 0 ( 2 r 0 −1)+ Q pk . (33) View Source b) Nakagamifading With the PDF of
    g 1 g0 given in (20) (note that g 1 g 0 has the same PDF as g 0 g 1 ), we have

    is known as Gauss''s hypergeometric function [17]. c) Log-normal fading With the
    PDF of g 1 g 0 given in Section IV (note that g 1 g 0 has the same PDF as g 0
    g 1 ), we have P out = Pr{ e Y < N 0 ( 2 r 0 −1) Q pk } =1− 1 2 erfc( 1 2σ log[
    N 0 ( 2 r 0 −1) Q pk ]), (36) View Source where erfc (⋅) is defined as erfc (t)≜
    2 π √ ∫ ∞ t e − x 2 dx . 2. Average interference power constraint only From (26),
    by setting P pk =+∞ and denoting ω ∗ = 1 λ N 0 ( 2 r 0−1) , we have P( g 0 , g
    1 )={ N 0 ( 2 r 0 − 1) g 1 , 0, g 0 g 1 < ω ∗ oerwise , (37) View Source and the
    minimum outage probability is given by P out =1−Pr{ g 0 g 1 < ω ∗ }, (38) View
    Source where ω ∗ is obtained by substituting (37) into the constraint E [ g 0
    P( g 0 , g 1 )]= Q av . In the following, the minimum outage probability is evaluated
    under different fading models. a) Rayleigh fading With the PDF of g 0 g 1 given
    in (18), we have P out =1− ∫ ω ∗ 0 1 (x+1 ) 2 dx= 1 1+ ω ∗ , (39) View Source
    where ω ∗ is given by ∫ ω ∗ 0 x (x+1 ) 2 dx= Q av N 0 ( 2 r 0 −1) . (40) View
    Source From (40), we have ω ∗ =exp[W(− e −1− Q av N 0 ( 2 r 0−1) )+1+ Q av N 0
    ( 2 r 0 −1) ]−1, (41) View Source where W(x) is the Lambert-W function, which
    is defined as the inverse function of f(w)=w e w . As can be seen from (39), if
    ω ∗ goes to infinity, the outage probability becomes zero; however, from (41),
    it is seen that ω ∗ is infinity only when r 0 =0 . This indicates that the zero-outage
    capacity for Rayleigh fading is zero, which is consistent with the result obtained
    in Section IV. b) Nakagami fading With the PDF of 9 0 g 1 given in (20), we have
    P out =1− ∫ ω ∗ 0 x m −1 B(m,m)(x+1 ) 2m dx =1− ( ω ∗ ) m mB(m,m) 2 F 1 (2m,m;m+1;−
    ω ∗ ), (42) View Source where ω ∗ is given by 1 B(m,m) ∫ ω ∗ 0 x m (x+1 ) 2m dx=
    Q av N 0 ( 2 r 0 −1) . (43) View Source From (3.194–1) in [17], the above equation
    is simplified as ( w ∗ ) m+ 1 2 F 1 (2m,m+1;m+2;− w ∗ ) (m+1)B(m,m) = Q av N 0
    ( 2 r 0 −1) . (44) View Source From the above, for the case of m=2 , the outage
    probability can be shown to be P out = 1+3 ω ∗ (1+ ω ∗ ) 3 , and ω ∗ satisfies
    2[1− 1+3 ω ∗ +3( ω ∗ ) 2 (1+ ω ∗ ) 3 ]= Q av N 0 ( 2 r 0 −1) . From the above
    two formulas, when ω ∗ is infinity, the outage probability becomes zero and r
    0 becomes the delay-limited capacity log 2 (1+ Q av 2 N 0 ) . This is consistent
    with the result obtained in Section IV. c) Log-normal fading With the PDF of g
    0 g 1 given in Section IV, we have P out =1−Pr{ e Y < ω ∗ }= 1 2 erfc( 1 2σ log(
    ω ∗ )), (45) View Source where ω ∗ is determined by ∫ log( ω ∗ ) −∞ e y 1 2π −
    − √ ( 2 – √ σ) exp(− y 2 2×2 σ 2 )dy= Q a v N 0 ( 2 r 0 −1) . (46) View Source
    The above equation can be simplified to e σ 2 [1− 1 2 erfc( log( ω ∗ )−2 σ 2 2σ
    )]= Q av N 0 ( 2 r 0 −1) . (47) View Source It is seen from (45), the zero-outage
    probability is achieved when ω ∗ goes to infinity. It is clear from (47) that,
    when ω ∗ goes to infinity, r 0 = log 2 (1+ Q av N 0 e σ 2 ) . Again, this is consistent
    with the delay-limited capacity obtained in Section IV. SECTION VI. Simulation
    Results In this section, we present and discuss the simulation results for the
    capacities of the SU fading channels under spectrum sharing with the proposed
    power allocation strategies. A. Ergodic capacity In this subsection, the simulation
    results for ergodic capacity are presented. For Rayleigh fading channels, the
    channel power gains (exponentially distributed) are assumed to be unit mean. For
    AWGN channels, the channel power gains are also assumed to be one. Fig. 2 shows
    the ergodic capacity under peak transmit and peak interference power constraints
    for Q pk =−5dB . It is observed that when P pk is very small, the ergodic capacities
    for the three curves shown in this figure are almost the same. This indicates
    that P pk limits the performance of the network. However, when P pk is sufficiently
    large compared with Q pk , the ergodic capacities become different. In this case,
    when g 0 models the AWGN channel, the capacity of SU link when g 1 also models
    the AWGN channel is higher than that when g 1 models the Rayleigh fading channel.
    This indicates that fading of the SU channel is harmful. However, when g 1 models
    the Rayleigh fading channel, the capacity for SU link when g 0 models the AWGN
    channel is lower than that when g 0 models the Rayleigh fading channel. This illustrates
    that fading of the channel between SU-Tx and PU-Rx is a beneficial factor in terms
    of maximizing the ergodic capacity of SU channel. Fig. 2. Ergodic capacity VS.

    capacity versus Q av under peak transmit and average interference power constraints.
    For comparison, the curve with P pk =+∞ (i.e. no transmit power constraint) is
    also shown. It is observed that when Q av is small, the capacities for different
    P pk ''s do not vary much. This illustrates that Q av limits the achievable rate
    of SU. However, when P pk is sufficiently large compared to Q av , the capacities
    become flat. This indicates that P pk becomes the dominant constraint in this
    case. Furthermore, with P pk being sufficiently large, the ergodic capacity of
    SU channel becomes close to that without transmit power constraint. Fig. 3. Ergodic
    capacity under peak transmit and average interference power constraints. Show
    All Fig. 4 shows the ergodic capacity versus P av under different types of interference
    power constraints. As shown in the figure, the ergodic capacity under average
    interference power constraint is larger than that under peak interference power
    constraint with the same value of P av . This is because the power control of
    SU is more flexible under average over peak interference power constraint. Fig.

    Show All B. Delay-limited capacity and outage capacity In this subsection, the
    simulation results for delay-limited and outage capacities are presented. For
    Rayleigh fading channels, the channel power gains (exponentially distributed)
    are assumed to be unit mean. Besides, m=2 is chosen for the unit-mean Nakagami
    fading channels used in the simulation. For log-normal fading channels, σ 2 =1
    is used. This is because log-normal shadowing is usually characterized in terms
    of its dB-spread σ dB , which ranges from 4dB to 12dB by empirical measurements,
    and is related to σ by σ=0.1log(10) σ dB [5]. We thus choose σ 2 =1 as this value
    of σ makes the dB-spread lying within its typical ranges. Fig. 5 shows the delay-limited
    capacity under P av =10dB for different fading models versus Q av . It is seen
    that the delay-limited capacity for Nakagami fading and log-normal shadowing increases
    with Q av . However, when Q av is sufficiently large, the delay-limited capacity
    will get saturated due to P av . Note that the delay-limited capacity of Rayleigh
    fading model is zero regardless of Q av . This is consistent with our analysis
    in Section IV. Fig. 5. Delay-limited capacity vs. Q av with P av =10dB for different
    fading channel models. Show All Fig. 6 shows the outage probability for different
    fading models under P pk =10dB and r 0 =1 bit/complex dimension (dim.). It is
    seen that when Q pk is small, the outage probability of SU link when g 0 models
    a fading channel is smaller than that when g 0 models the AWGN channel. Besides,
    more severe the fading is, the smaller the outage probability is. This illustrates
    that fading of the channel between SU-Tx and PU-Rx is good in terms of minimizing
    the outage probability of SU channel. However, when Q pk has the same value of
    P pk , the outage probability when g 0 models a fading channel is larger than
    that when g 0 models the AWGN channel. This can be foreseen from (24). When Q
    vk = P vk , the channel inversion condition for the AWGN case is 2 r0 −1 g 1 ≤
    P pk . However, the channel inversion condition for the fading case is 2 r0 −1
    g 1 ≤min( P pk , Q pk g 0 ) , which can be more restrictive than that In the AWGN
    case if g 0 >1 . The higher the probability g 0 >1 is, the larger the resultant
    outage probability is. However, when Q pk is sufficiently large, both fading and
    AWGN channels will have the same outage probability, since P pk becomes the dominant
    constraint in this case. Fig. 6. Outage probability VS. Q pk for r 0 =1 bit/complex

    outage probability under peak and average interference power constraints for r
    0 =1 bit/complex dim. under P pk =0dB or P pk =10dB . It is seen that under the
    same P pk , the outage probability under the average interference power constraint
    is smaller than that under the peak interference power constraint. This is due
    to the fact that the power control policy of SU is more flexible under the average
    over the peak interference power constraint. Fig. 7. Outage probability for r
    0 =1 bit/complex dim. under peak or average interference power constraints Show
    All Fig. 8 shows the outage probability for different fading models under the
    peak interference power constraint only with r 0 =1 bit/complex dim‥ It is observed
    that the simulation results match the analytical results very well. Moreover,
    it is observed that the outage probability curves overlap when Q pk is very small,
    indicating that the fading models do not affect the outage probability notably
    for small value of Q pk . Fig. 8. Outage probability for r 0 =1 bit/complex dim.
    under peak interference power constraint only. Show All Fig. 9 illustrates the
    outage capacity versus average interference power constraint Q av when the target
    rate r 0 is 1 bit/complex dim‥ It is observed that the outage probability for
    Nakagami fading and log-normal shadowing drop sharply when Q av reaches a certain
    value. This demonstrates that when Q av approaches infinity, the outage probability
    becomes zero. In contrast, there is no such an evident threshold observed for
    Rayleigh fading channel, since its delay-limited capacity is zero. Additionally,
    comparing Fig.s 8 and 9, it is observed that the outage probability under average
    interference power constraint is smaller than that under peak interference power
    constraint when Q av = Q pk , suggesting that the power allocation scheme under
    the former is more flexible over the latter. Furthermore, comparing Fig. 9 with
    Fig. 5, it is observed that Q av required to achieve the zero-outage probability
    for r 0 =1 bit/complex dim. is consistent with that required to achieve the same
    delay-limited capacity. Fig. 9. Outage probability for r 0 =1 bit/complex dim.
    under average interference power constraint only. Show All SECTION VII. Conclusions
    In this paper, the optimal power allocation strategies to achieve the ergodic,
    delay-limited, and outage capacities of a SU fading channel under spectrum sharing
    are studied, subject to different combinations of peak/average transmit and/or
    peak/average interference power constraints. It is shown that under the same threshold
    value, average interference power constraints are more flexible over their peak
    constraint counterparts to maximize SU fading channel capacities. The effects
    of different fading channel statistics on achievable SU capacities are also analyzed.
    One important observation made in this paper is that fading of the channel between
    SU-Tx and PU-Rx can be a good phenomenon for maximizing the capacity of SU fading
    channel. APPENDIX A Proof of Theorem 1 By introducing the dual variable associated
    with the average interference power constraint, the partial Lagrangian of this
    problem is expressed as L(P( g 0 , g 1 ),λ)= E2[ log 2 (1+ g 1 P( g 0 , g 1 )
    N 0 )] −λ(f[ g 0 P( g 0 , g 1 )]− Q av ), (48) View Source where λ is the nonnegative
    dual variable associated with the constraint E [ g 0 P( g 0 , g 1 )]≤ Q av . Let
    A denote the set of {0≤P( g 0 , g 1 )≤ P pk } . The dual function is then expressed
    as q(λ)= max P(g0, g 1 )∈A L(P( g 0 , g 1 ),λ). (49) View Source The Lagrange
    dual problem is then defined as min λ≥0 q(λ) . It can be verified that the duality
    gap is zero for the convex optimization problem addressed here, and thus solving
    its dual problem is equivalent to solving the original problem. There-fore, according
    to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions [20], the optimal solutions needs to
    satisfy the following equations: 0≤P( g 0 , g 1 )≤ P pk ,Fi[ g 0 P( g 0 , g 1
    )]≤ Q av , λ(Ei[ g 0 P( g 0 , g 1 )]− Q av )=0. (50) (51) View Source For a fixed
    λ , by dual decomposition [21], the dual function can be decomposed into a series
    of similar sub-dual-functions each for one fading state. For a particular fading
    state, the problem can be shown equivalent to max P( g 0 , g 1 ) log 2 (1+ g 1
    P( g 0 , g 1 ) N 0 )−λ g 0 P( g 0 , g 1 ), s.t. P( g 0 , g 1 )≤ P pk , P( g 0
    , g 1 )≥0. (52) (53) (54) View Source The dual function of this sub-problem is
    L sub (P( g 0 , g 1 ),μ,ν)= log 2 (1+ g 1 P( g 0 , g 1 ) N 0 )−λ g 0 P( g 0 ,
    g 1 ) −μ(P( g 0 , g 1 )− P pk )+νP( g 0 , g 1 ), (55) View Source where μ and
    v are the nonnegative dual variables associated with the constraints (53) and
    (54), respectively. The sub-dual problem is then defined as q sub (μ,v)= min μ≥0,ν≥0
    L sub (P( g 0 , g 1 ),μ,ν) . This is also a convex optimization problem for which
    the duality gap is zero. Therefore, according to the KKT conditions, the optimal
    solutions needs to satisfy the following equations: μ(P( g 0 , g 1 )− P pk )=0,
    νP( g 0 , g 1 )=0, K g 1 g 1 P( g 0 , g 1 )+ N 0 −λ g 0 −μ+1/=0. (56) (57) (58)
    View Source From (58), it followsd P( g 0 , g 1 )= K μ−ι/+λ g 0 − N 0 g 1 . (59)
    View Source Suppose that P( g 0 , g 1 )< P pk , when g 0 ≤ K λ( P pk + N 0 g 1
    ) or equivalently ( K λ g 0 − N 0 g 1 )≥ P pk . Then, from (56), it follows that
    μ=0 Therefore, (59) reduces to P( g 0 , g 1 )= K −v+λ g0 − N g 1 Then P( g 0 ,
    g 1 )< P pk results in K −v+λ g 0 − N g 0 g 1 < P pk . Since v≥0 , it follows
    that P pk > K −v+λ g 0 − N 0 g 1 ≥ K λ g 0 − N 0 g 1 . This contradicts the presumption,
    Therefore, from (50), It follows that P( g 0 , g 1 )= P pk ,if g 0 ≤ K λ( + g
    1 N i ) . (60) View Source Suppose P( g 0 , g 1 )>0 , when g 0 ≥ K g 1 λ N 0 or
    equivalently K λ g 0 − N 0 g 1 ≤0 . Then, from (57), it follows that v=0 . Therefore,
    (59) reduces to P( g 0 , g 1 )= K μ+λ g 0 − N 0 g 1 . Then P( g 0 , g 1 )>0 results
    in K μ+λ g 0 − N 0 g 1 >0 Since μ≥0 , it follows that K λ g 0 − N 0 g 1 ≥ k μ+λ
    g 0 − N 0 g 1 >0 . This contradicts with the presumption. Therefore, from (50),
    it follows P( g 0 , g 1 )=0,if g 0 ≥ K g 1 λ N 0 . (61) View Source Suppose P(
    g 0 , g 1 )=0 , when K g 1 λ N 0 > g 0 > K λ( P pk + N 0 g 1 ) or equivalently
    0< K λ g 0 − N 0 g 1 < P pk . Then, from (56), it follows that μ=0 . Therefore,
    (59) reduces to P( g 0 , g 1 )= K −v+λ g 0 − N 0 g 1 . Then P( g 0 , g 1 )=0 results
    in K −v+λ g 0 − N 0 g 1 =0 . Since v≥0 , it follows that 0> k −v+λ g 0 − N 0 g
    1 ≥ K −ν+λ g 0 − N 0 g 1 . This contradicts the presumption. Therefore, P( g 0
    , g 1 )≠0 for this set of g 0 . Next, suppose P( g 0 , g 1 )= P pk for the same
    set of g 0 . Then, from (57), it follows that ν=0 . Therefore, (59) reduces to
    P( g 0 , g 1 )= K λ g 0 − N 0 g 1 . Then P( g 0 , g 1 )= P pk indicates K μ+λ
    g 0 − N 0 g 1 = P pk . Since μ≥0 , it follows K λ g 0 − N 0 g 1 ≥ K μ+λ g 0 −
    N 0 g 1 = P pk . This contradicts the presumption. Therefore, P( g 0 , g 1 )≠
    P pk for this set of g 0 . Now, from (57), P( g 0 , g 1 )≠0 results in ν=0 . From
    (56), P( g 0 , g 1 )≠ P pk results in μ=0 . Therefore, from (59), it follows P(
    g 0 , g 1 )= K λ g 0 − N 0 g 1 ,if K g 1 λ N 0 > g 0 > K λ( P pk + N 0 g 1 ) .
    (62) View Source From (51), it is easy to observe that λ is either equal to zero
    or determined by solving E [ g 0 P( g 0 , g 1 )]= Q av . Theorem 1 is thus proved.
    APPENDIX B Proof of Theorem 3 The proof is organized in two steps. First, we show
    that the solution of (23) subject to F 2 must have the same structure as (26).
    Secondly, we show that λ is determined by substituting (26) into the constraint
    Fi[ g 0 P( g 0 , g 1 )]= Q av . Step 1:Define an indicator function, χ={ 1, log
    2 (1+ g 1 P(g0, g 1 ) N 0 )< r 0 0,otherwise (63) View Source Then the optimization
    problem (23) subject to F 2 can be rewritten as min P( g 0 , g 1 )∈ E 2 E{χ}.
    (64) View Source By introducing the dual variable λ associated with the average
    interference power constraint, the partial Lagrangian of this problem is expressed
    as L(P( g 0 , g 1 ),λ)=12{χ}+λ(Fi{ g 0 P( g 0 , g 1 )}− Q av ). (65) View Source
    Let A denote the set of {P( g 0 , g 1 ):0≤P( g 0 , g 1 )≤ P pk } . The dual function
    is then expressed as min P( g 0 , g 1 )∈A Fi{χ}+λ(Fi{ g 0 P( g 0 , g 1 )}− Q av
    ). (66) View Source For a fixed λ , by dual decomposition, the dual function can
    be decomposed into a series of similar sub-dual-functions each for one fading
    state. For a particular fading state, the problem can be shown equivalent to min
    P( g 0 , g 1 ) χ+λ g 0 P( g 0 , g 1 ), s.t.P( g 0 , g 1 )≤ P pk , P( g 0 , g 1
    )≥0. (67) (68) (69) View Source When χ=1 , (67) is minimized if P( g 0 , g 1 )=0
    , and the minimum value of (67) is 1; when χ=0 , (67) is minimized if P( g 0 ,
    g 1 )= N 0 ( 2 r 0 − 1) g 0 , and the minimum value of (67) is λ g 0 N 0 ( 2 r
    0 − 1) g 1 Thus, P( g 0 , g 1 )= N 0 ( 2 r0 −1) g 1 is the optimal solution of
    the problem, only when λ g 0 N 0 ( 2 r0 −1) g 1 <1 and N 0 ( 2 r 0−1) g 1 ≤ P
    pk are satisfied simultaneously. Otherwise, P( g 0 , g 1 )=0 is the optimal solution
    of the problem. Therefore, the optimal solution has the same structure as (26).
    Step 2:Suppose P ∗ ( g 0 , g 1 ) is the optimal solution of (23) subject to F
    2 with λ= λ ∗ >0 satisfying E [ g 0 P ∗ ( g 0 , g 1 )]< Q av . Suppose P ′ ( g
    0 , g 1 ) is a solution of (23) subject to F 2 with λ= λ ′ >0 , which satisfies
    E[ g 0 P ′ ( g 0 , g 1 )]= Q av . Then, it is easy to verify that λ ∗ > λ ′ .
    Therefore, from (27), it follows P ∗ out > P ′ out (70) View Source where the
    inequality results from the fact that λ ∗ > λ ′ and P out is an increasing function
    with respect to λ . This result contradicts our presumption. Therefore, the optimal
    λ must be determined by solving E [ g 0 P( g 0 , g 1 )]= Q av . Otherwise, if
    λ=0 , the power allocation strategy obtained in step 1 reduces to the truncated
    channel inversion given in [6], and this holds only when E [ g 0 P( g 0 , g 1
    )]< Q av . Theorem 3 is thus proved. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords

    Ekram Hossain, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada Vijay Bhargava, University
    of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada Introduction Cognitive radio has emerged
    as a promising technology for maximizing the utili- tion of the limited radio
    bandwidth while accommodating the increasing amount of services and applications
    in wireless networks. A cognitive radio (CR) transceiver is able to adapt to the
    dynamic radio environment and the network parameters to maximize the utilization
    of the limited radio resources while providing ?exibility in wireless access.
    The key features of a CR transceiver are awareness of the radio en- ronment (in
    terms of spectrum usage, power spectral density of transmitted/received signals,
    wireless protocol signaling) and intelligence. This intelligence is achieved through
    learning for adaptive tuning of system parameters such as transmit power, carrier
    frequency, and modulation strategy (at the physical layer), and higher-layer protocol
    parameters. Development of cognitive radio technology has to deal with technical
    and pr- tical considerations (which are highly multidisciplinary) as well as regulatory
    - quirements. There is an increasing interest on this technology among the researchers
    in both academia and industry and the spectrum policy makers. The key enabling
    techniques for cognitive radio networks (also referred to as dynamic spectrum
    - cess networks) are wideband signal processing techniques for digital radio,
    advanced wireless communications methods, arti?cial intelligence and machine learning
    te- niques, and cognitive radio-aware adaptive wireless/mobile networking protocols.

    References Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: Cognitive radio is an emerging
    technology that aims for efficient spectrum usage by allowing unlicensed (secondary)
    users to access licensed frequency bands under the condition of protecting the
    licensed (primary) users from harmful interference. The latter condition constraints
    the achievable throughput of a cognitive radio network, which should therefore
    access a wideband spectrum in order to provide reliable and efficient services
    to its users. In this paper, we study the problem of designing the optimal sensing

    last decade has witnessed an increasing development and popularity of wireless
    communications, which has turned the limited spectrum into a scarce resource.
    Under the current fixed spectrum allocation policy, the frequency bands are exclusively
    allocated to licensed users, whereas unlicensed users are not allowed to access
    them even when they are not being used. Moreover, careful studies of the spectrum
    usage pattern have revealed that the allocated spectrum experiences low utilization.
    In fact, recent studies by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) have shown
    that the utilization of the licensed spectrum varies from 15% to 85%, whereas
    only 2% of spectrum would be used in the US at any given moment [1]. The realization
    of the inefficient use of the spectrum under the current fixed spectrum allocation
    policy, as well as the demand for more and better wireless services has contributed
    to the reconsideration of the way the spectrum is utilized today and has led very
    recently to the decision of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to allow
    access of unlicensed users to the broadcast television spectrum at locations where
    that spectrum is not being used by licensed services [2]. The key technology towards
    efficient spectrum usage is Cognitive Radio (CR), which was first introduced in
    1999 by J. Mitola III [3]. Cognitive Radio allows unlicensed (secondary) users
    to access licensed bands under the condition of protecting the licensed (primary)
    users from harmful interference [4]. Three approaches have been developed for
    cognitive radio so far regarding the way a secondary user accesses the licensed
    spectrum: (i) the opportunistic spectrum access [5], [6], where the secondary
    users transmit only when a frequency band is detected to be idle, (ii) the spectrum
    sharing [7], [8], where the secondary users coexist with the primary users and
    apply an interference constraint to ensure the quality of service (QoS) of the
    primary network, and (iii) the sensing-based spectrum sharing [9], where the secondary
    users sense for the status (active/idle) of the channel and adapt their transmit
    power based on the decision made by spectrum sensing. The latter scheme can be
    seen as a hybrid approach between the opportunistic spectrum access and the spectrum
    sharing scheme. The frame structure of any cognitive radio system that employs
    spectrum sensing studied so far, consists of a sensing time slot and a data transmission
    slot, as depicted in Fig. 1. Therefore, an inherent tradeoff exists between the
    sensing time and the data transmission time, thus the throughput of the cognitive
    radio network. The problem of the sensing-throughput tradeoff for an opportunistic
    spectrum access cognitive radio network that employs energy detection for spectrum
    sensing was addressed in [10] for a single frequency band, where the authors studied
    the problem of finding the optimal sensing time that maximizes the throughput
    under a constraint on the probability of detection of the primary users. This
    work was extended in [11] for a wideband opportunistic spectrum access cognitive
    radio network, where the problem of finding the optimal sensing time and power
    allocation scheme that maximizes the average achievable throughput was studied
    under two different power constraints (an instantaneous and an average transmit
    power constraint) and it was shown that the average transmit power constraint
    leads to higher average achievable throughput compared to the instantaneous transmit
    power constraint. Fig. 1. Frame structure of the cognitive radio network. Show
    All In this paper, we study the design of the optimal sensing time and power allocation
    strategy that maximizes the ergodic throughput of a cognitive radio that employs
    simultaneous multiband detection [13] and operates under two different schemes,
    namely the wideband sensing-based spectrum sharing (WSSS) and the wideband opportunistic
    spectrum access (WOSA) scheme. Different from the work in [11], we take into consideration
    an average interference power constraint in the WOSA scheme (besides the average
    transmit power constraint), in order to effectively protect the primary users
    from harmful interference for the realistic scenario of imperfect spectrum sensing,
    whereas we also demonstrate the effect of this constraint on the optimal sensing
    time. Moreover, we consider in the optimization process the effect of the quiet
    sensing time (during which the transmit power is zero) on the average transmit
    power constraint, namely the fact that an increase of the sensing time leads to
    reduced data transmission time on the one hand, but also leads to increased transmit
    power on the other, such that on average the aforementioned transmit power constraint
    is met but higher throughput is achieved. This can seen in more detail in Section
    III and IV. In addition, we propose an algorithm that different from the work
    in [10], [11] can be applied even when not all of the frequency bands are underutilized,
    in order to achieve the maximum ergodic throughput of the cognitive radio network.
    The two latter differences also apply in comparison to the work in [9], where
    the single-band sensing-based spectrum sharing scheme was studied. Different from
    the work in [9], by considering all terms in the optimization process, we ensure
    that the maximum ergodic throughput is achieved on the one hand, and, on the other
    hand, that the primary users do not suffer from harmful interference, which will
    be caused by the use of approximations in the average interference power constraint.
    In addition, we propose an algorithm that can be applied even for the case that
    not all of the frequency bands are underutilized. Furthermore, different from
    the work in [12], where the single-band opportunistic spectrum access scheme was
    considered under an average interference power constraint for Rayleigh fading
    channels, we additionally consider an average transmit power constraint, in order
    to keep the long-term power budget of the secondary users. Moreover, we consider
    all terms in the ergodic throughput maximization problem, so that to ensure that
    the maximum throughput is achieved. In addition, we do not consider in our analysis
    a strict single value constraint regarding the target detection probability (
    P tar d ≈1 in [12]) that might not be always possible in practice due to the limitations
    of the spectrum sensing techniques. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm that
    acquires the optimal sensing time and power allocation regardless of the channel
    distribution and which can be applied even when not all of the frequency bands
    are underutilized. Finally, we discuss in this paper (i) the effect of the average
    transmit power constraint and the average interference power constraint on the
    optimal sensing time, (ii) the effect of selecting a sensing time that is not
    optimal for all values of maximum average transmit and interference power in terms
    of throughput loss for the cognitive radio network, (iii) we compare the performance
    of the two transmission schemes, namely the wideband sensing-based spectrum sharing
    and the wideband opportunistic spectrum access scheme, and finally (iv) we demonstrate
    the effect of using the optimal time of one scheme (e.g. WOSA) under the other
    scheme (e.g. WSSS). The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section
    II, we present the system model. In Section III, the problem of designing the
    optimal sensing time and power allocation strategy for a wideband sensing-based
    spectrum sharing (WSSS) cognitive radio network is studied. The respective problem
    for a wideband opportunistic spectrum access (WOSA) cognitive radio network is
    briefly studied in Section IV. The simulation results are presented and discussed
    in Section V and finally the conclusions are drawn in Section VI. A Notations

    inequality between vectors, [x ] + denotes max (0,x) , P denotes power and finally
    P probability. SECTION II System Model We consider a cognitive radio network that
    can access a wideband spectrum licensed to a primary network, which is divided
    into M non-overlapping narrowband channels. The system consists of a primary link
    and a secondary link, as depicted in Fig. 2, where Tx denotes the transmitter
    and Rx denotes the receiver. In order to access the frequency bands, the secondary
    user (SU) must first perform spectrum sensing to determine the status (active/idle)
    of each channel. In this paper, we perform simultaneous spectrum sensing of multiple
    frequency bands by using the multiband joint detector proposed in [13], which
    utilizes the energy detection scheme [16], in order to determine the status of
    the primary user (PU) in each frequency band. The received signal at the secondary
    user is initially passed through the M down-converters and then to the M individual
    energy detectors, as shown in Fig. 3. The detection of the status of a frequency
    band is a binary hypothesis testing problem, i.e. the frequency band k is idle
    ( H 0,k ) or the frequency band k is active ( H 1,k ) . The primary user''s signals
    are assumed to be complex-valued PSK signals, whereas the noise at the secondary
    users is assumed to be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) circularly
    symmetric complex Gaussian (CSCG) with zero mean and N 0 variance, namely CN(0,
    N 0 ) . Fig. 2. System model. Show All Fig. 3. Block diagram of the secondary
    user''s wideband detector. Show All The probability of detection and false alarm
    for the j th channel under the energy detection scheme is given by P d,j (τ, ϵ
    j ) P fa,j (τ, ϵ j ) =Q(( ϵ j N 0 − γ j −1) τ f s 2 γ j +1 − − − − − − − √ ) =Q((
    ϵ j N 0 −1) τ f s − − − √ ) =Q( 2 γ j +1 − − − − − − √ Q −1 ( P d,j )+ τ f s −
    − − √ γ j ) (1) (2) (3) View Source respectively [10], where τ represents the
    sensing time, ϵ j denotes the decision threshold of the energy detector on channel
    j , γ j is the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from the primary user at the
    secondary detector on channel j and finally f s represents the sampling frequency.
    The frame structure employed in this cognitive radio network is depicted in Fig.
    1. A quiet period of duration τ is inserted for spectrum sensing into each transmission
    frame of duration T . The instantaneous channel power gain of the secondary link,
    the link between PU-TX and SU-RX, and the link between SU-TX and PU-RX for the
    j th channel are denoted by g ss,j , g ps,j and g sp,j respectively, as shown
    in Fig. 2. The channels are assumed to be flat fading and the channel power gains
    are assumed to be ergodic, stationary and known at the secondary users, as in
    [7], [9], [17], [18]. SECTION III Wideband Sensing-Based Spectrum Sharing In the
    wideband sensing-based spectrum sharing (WSSS) scheme, the secondary user transmits
    simultaneously on M frequency bands (regardless of the actual status of each frequency
    band) and adapts its transmit power on each band based on the decision made during
    the sensing slot at the beginning of each frame (Fig. 1). If the j th frequency
    band is detected to be idle ( H 0,j ) , the secondary user transmits using high
    power P (0) s,j during the data transmission slot, whereas if the j th frequency
    band is sensed to be active ( H 1,j ) , then the secondary user transmits using
    relatively low power P (1) s,j , in order to reduce the interference caused to
    the primary user. This cognitive radio scheme can be seen as a hybrid approach
    between the opportunistic spectrum access and the spectrum sharing scheme. In
    this section, we study the problem of optimizing the sensing time and power allocation,
    in order to maximize the ergodic throughput of the wideband sensing-based spectrum
    sharing cognitive radio network. The instantaneous transmission rate of the secondary
    user on the j th channel, denoted by r 0,j for the case of absence of primary
    user ( H 0,j ) and by r 1,j for the case of presence of the primary user ( H 1,j
    ) , is given by r 0,j r 1,j = log 2 ⎛ ⎝ 1+ g ss,j P (0) s,j N 0 ⎞ ⎠ , = log 2
    ⎛ ⎝ 1+ g ss,j P (1) s,j g ps,j P p,j + N 0 ⎞ ⎠ , (4) (5) View Source respectively,
    where P p,j denotes the transmit power of the primary user on the j th channel.
    However, considering the fact that spectrum sensing is not a perfect function,
    due to the limitations of the spectrum sensing techniques and the nature of wireless
    communications that include phenomena such as shadowing and fading, the primary
    user could either be miss-detected or a false alarm may occur. As a result, four
    different cases can be distinguished regarding the sensing decision (present or
    absent) and the actual status of the primary user (active or idle) on each frequency
    band. Therefore, the following four different instantaneous transmission rates
    of the secondary user on the j th frequency band occur, where the first index
    number describes the actual status of the primary user (“0” for idle and “1” for
    active) and the second index number describes the decision that is made by the
    secondary users (“0” for absent and “1” for present) r 00,j r 01,j r 10,j r 11,j
    = log 2 ⎛ ⎝ 1+ g ss,j P (0) s,j N 0 ⎞ ⎠ , = log 2 ⎛ ⎝ 1+ g ss,j P (1) s,j N 0
    ⎞ ⎠ , = log 2 ⎛ ⎝ 1+ g ss,j P (0) s,j g ps,j P p,j + N 0 ⎞ ⎠ , = log 2 ⎛ ⎝ 1+
    g ss,j P (1) s,j g ps,j P p,j + N 0 ⎞ ⎠ . (6) (7) (8) (9) View Source Thus, the
    average throughput of the j th channel for the sensing-based spectrum sharing
    model (ignoring the sensing time) can be formulated as C j =P( H 0,j )(1− P fa,j
    (τ, ϵ j )) r 00,j +P( H 0,j ) P fa,j (τ, ϵ j ) r 01,j +P( H 1,j )(1− P d,j (τ,
    ϵ j )) r 10,j +P( H 1,j ) P d,j (τ, ϵ j ) r 11,j (10) View Source where P( H 0,j
    ) denotes the probability that the j th channel is idle and P( H 1,j ) denotes
    the probability that the j th channel is active. Furthermore, in order to keep
    the long-term power budget of the secondary users, an average transmit power constraint
    (over all fading states) should be taken into account, as in previous studies
    of the capacity over fading channels such as [19]–[21], which can be written as
    follows T−τ T E{ ∑ j=1 M [P( H 0,j ) P (0) s,j (1− P fa,j (τ, ϵ j )) +P( H 0,j
    ) P (1) s,j P fa,j (τ, ϵ j ) +P( H 1,j ) P (0) s,j (1− P d,j (τ, ϵ j )) +P( H
    1,j ) P (1) s,j P d,j (τ, ϵ j )]}≤ P av (11) View Source where P av denotes the
    maximum average transmit power of the secondary user. Since the priority of a
    cognitive radio network is to protect the quality of service (QoS) of primary
    users, an interference power constraint should be imposed for the protection of
    the primary network. In this paper, we will apply an average interference power
    constraint (averaged over all different fading states), since it was shown in
    [19] that the average interference power constraint does not only provide higher
    ergodic throughput for the cognitive radio network compared to the peak interference
    power constraint, but it also provides better protection of the primary network.
    Under the wideband sensing-based spectrum sharing (WSSS) scheme, interference
    on the j th channel is caused to the primary user in two cases, namely when the
    primary user is falsely detected to be absent (missed detection) and additionally,
    when the primary user is detected to be present (correct detection) and therefore
    a low transmit power P (1) s,j is used. As a result, the average interference
    power constraint of the wideband sensing-based spectrum access can be formulated
    as follows T−τ T E{ g sp,j P (0) s,j P( H 1,j )(1− P d,j (τ, ϵ j )) + g sp,j P
    (1) s,j P( H 1,j ) P d,j (τ, ϵ j )}≤Γ,j=1,…,M (12) View Source where the parameter
    Γ represents the maximum average interference power that is tolerable by the primary
    users on each frequency band. Finally, since the main priority of a cognitive
    radio network is the protection of the primary users, a high detection probability
    P d,j (τ, ϵ j ) is required. In this paper, we choose the target detection probability
    to be P d,j (τ, ϵ j )= P ¯ d,j for j=1,…,M . Moreover, for a given sensing time
    τ= τ ¯ , we can choose a decision threshold such that the target detection probability
    P ¯ d,j is met. According to (1), this decision threshold is given by ϵ j = N
    0 ( 2 γ j +1 τ ¯ f s − − − − − − − √ Q −1 ( P ¯ d,j )+ γ j +1), j=1,…,M. (13)
    View Source Thus, the optimization problem that maximizes the ergodic throughput
    of a wideband sensing-based spectrum sharing (WSSS) cognitive radio network, under
    average transmit and interference power constraints can be formulated as follows
    maximize {τ, P (0) s , P (1) s } E { ∑ j=1 M T−τ T C j (τ, P (0) s , P (1) s )}
    (14) View Source subject to (11), (12), P (0) s,j ≥0,  P (1) s,j ≥0,j=1,…,M,T≥τ≥0
    . The optimization problem (14) is convex with respect to the transmit powers
    P (0) s and P (1) s , but not with respect to the sensing time τ , considering
    the dependence of the false alarm probability P fa,j (τ) on the sensing time τ
    [10], [23]. Different from the approach in [9], we do not consider any approximation
    on the objective function or the average interference power constraint, in order
    to effectively protect the licensed users from harmful interference and achieve
    the maximum ergodic throughput possible. Due to the non-convexity of the problem
    (14) with respect to the sensing time τ , the optimal sensing time cannot be obtained
    using convex optimization techniques. However, considering the fact that the sensing
    time lies within the interval (0,T) , it can be easily acquired using one-dimensional
    exhaustive search. Therefore, in the following we focus on finding the optimal
    power allocation strategy that maximizes the ergodic throughput of the wideband
    sensing-based spectrum sharing (WSSS) cognitive radio network. The Lagrangian
    with respect to the transmit powers P (0) s and P (1) s is given by the following
    equation L( P (0) s , P (1) s ,λ,μ)=E{ ∑ j=1 M T− τ ¯ T ( α 0,j r 00,j + β 0,j
    r 10,j + α 1,j r 11,j + β 1,j r 01,j )}−λ[ T− τ ¯ T E{ ∑ j=1 M [( α 0,j + β 0,j

    ) P fa,j ( τ ¯ ), =P( H 1,j ) P ¯ d,j , (16) (17) (18) (19) View Source respectively,
    for j=1,…,M . The Lagrange dual optimization problem is now given by minimize

    (14) that the primal optimization problem with respect to the transmit powers
    P (0) s and P (1) s is convex with affine inequality constraints and that Slater''s
    condition holds [23], i.e. strong duality holds. Therefore, the difference between
    the optimal value of the objective function of the primal and dual optimization
    problem (i.e. the optimal duality gap) is zero, which guarantees [22], [23] that
    the primal optimization problem (14) with respect to the transmit powers P (0)
    s and P (1) s can be equivalently solved by the Lagrange dual optimization problem
    (20). We therefore focus on the Lagrange dual optimization problem (20). In order
    to calculate the dual function g(λ,μ) , we need to find the supremum of the Lagrangian
    with respect to the transmit powers P (0) s and P (1) s . The joint optimization
    problem (21) with respect to both transmit powers can be decomposed into two optimization
    subproblems, namely one for P (0) s and one for P (1) s , as follows Subproblem

    the algorithm that obtains the optimal sensing time and power allocation strategy
    of the wideband sensing-based spectrum sharing (WSSS) cognitive radio network
    is presented in the following table. Algorithm 1: Optimal sensing time and power
    allocation for wideband sensing-based spectrum sharing (WSSS) cognitive radio
    networks SECTION IV Wideband Opportunistic Spectrum Access In the wideband opportunistic
    spectrum access (WOSA) scheme, the secondary users simultaneously sense all frequency
    bands and access only those that are detected to be idle. Therefore, the role
    of spectrum sensing is of utmost importance and a high target detection probability
    is required, in order to avoid the degradation of the quality of service (QoS)
    of the primary network. However, as mentioned in the previous section, due to
    the limitations of spectrum sensing techniques and the nature of wireless communications,
    it is almost inevitable that there will be a probability of missed detection.
    In this case, the secondary user will detect that a frequency band is idle (when
    in fact it is not) and it will access it. As a result, the average throughput
    of the j th channel (ignoring the sensing time) for the wideband opportunistic
    spectrum access scheme is given by C j =P( H 0,j )(1− P fa,j (τ, ϵ j )) r 0,j
    +P( H 1,j )(1− P d,j (τ, ϵ j )) r 1,j (32) View Source where r 0,j and r 1,j are
    given by (4) and (5), respectively. When the secondary user falsely detects the
    status of a frequency band, it is going cause harmful interference to the primary
    user. Since the priority of cognitive radio networks is to protect the quality
    of service (QoS) of primary users, an interference power constraint should be
    imposed for the protection of the primary networks. In this paper, we will apply
    in addition to the following average transmit power constraint (averaged over
    all different fading states) T−τ T E{ ∑ j=1 M [P( H 0,j )(1− P fa,j (τ)) P s,j

    power threshold. Finally, we can formulate the optimization problem that maximizes
    the ergodic throughput of a wideband opportunistic spectrum access (WOSA) cognitive
    radio network for a target probability of detection P d,j (τ, ϵ j )= P ¯ d,j for
    j,=1,…,M , as follows maximize {τ, P s }  E{ ∑ j=1 M T−τ T C j (τ, P s )} (35)
    View Source subject to (33), (34), P s,j ≥0 , j,…,M,T≥τ≥0 . The optimization problem
    (35) is convex with respect to the transmit power P s but not with respect to
    the sensing time τ , considering the dependence of the false alarm probability
    P fa,j (τ) on the sensing time. Due to the non-convexity of the problem (35) with
    respect to the sensing time, we consider (similar to the wideband sensing-based
    spectrum sharing scheme) one-dimensional exhaustive search. Therefore, in the
    following we focus on finding the optimal power allocation that maximizes the
    ergodic throughput of the wideband opportunistic spectrum access (WOSA) cognitive
    radio network for a given sensing time τ= τ ¯ . By writing the Lagrangian L( P

    allocation for wideband opportunistic spectrum access (WOSA) cognitive radio networks
    SECTION V Simulation Results In this section, we present and discuss the simulation
    results for two cognitive radio networks: one that operates under the wideband
    sensing-based spectrum sharing scheme (WSSS) and one that employs the wideband
    opportunistic spectrum access scheme (WOSA). Three narrowband frequency channels
    are considered here, each of 6 MHz bandwidth. The channels are assumed to be block
    faded and their power gains ergodic, stationary and exponentially distributed
    with unit mean. The frame duration of the secondary networks is fixed and set
    to T=100 ms and the sampling frequency to 6 MHz. The target detection probability
    for all channels is set to p ~ d,j =90% , whereas the worst-case received SNR
    from the primary user at the secondary detector on each of the three channels
    is considered to be γ 1 =−12dB,  γ 2 =−15 dB and γ 3 =−20 dB respectively. Finally,
    the transmit power of the primary user on all channels is assumed to be P p,j
    =10 dB, whereas the noise variance equal to N 0 =1 . In Fig. 4, the total ergodic
    throughput versus the sensing time τ is presented for the WSSS and the WOSA cognitive
    radio network for several values of the total average transmit power P av of the
    secondary user. The maximum average interference power is set to Γ=−10 dB, whereas
    the probability that the frequency band j is idle is assumed to be P( H 0,j )=0.6,j=1,2,3
    . It can be clearly seen from Fig. 4 that the total ergodic throughput of both
    secondary networks is a convex function of the sensing time τ , which yields that
    an optimal sensing time exists for the WSSS and the WOSA cognitive radio network.
    Furthermore, as seen from Fig. 4, the optimal sensing time τ ¯ opt for both secondary
    networks is around 10 ms, which is slightly increased compared to the results
    presented in [11], where (under the same scenario) the optimal sensing time was
    found to be around 6 ms. In addition, it results from Fig. 4 that the total ergodic
    throughput of the WSSS is higher compared to the respective of the WOSA for all
    considered values of the total average transmit power P av , which is due to the
    fact that the WSSS scheme allows data transmission (using spectrum sharing) even
    when the primary user is detected to be active. Fig. 4. Total ergodic throughput
    versus sensing time under P( H 0,j =0.6 and Γ=−10 dB for different values of total
    transmit power P av for the wideband opportunistic spectrum access and sensing-based
    spectrum sharing cognitive radio network. Show All In Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, the total
    ergodic throughput versus the average transmit power constraint P av of the secondary
    user is presented for various values of the maximum average interference power
    Γ and for probabilities that the frequency bands are idle equal to P( H 0,j )=0.6
    and P( H 0,j )=0.8 respectively. It is rather interesting to notice in Fig. 5
    and Fig. 6 that under low values of the maximum average interference power Γ ,
    the performance of the two networks is almost the same, something that indicates
    that the transmit power in the WSSS is mainly allocated at the periods when the
    frequency band is detected to be idle, whereas the contribution of the spectrum
    sharing function of the WSSS (i.e. when the primary user is detected to be active)
    is only significant when the maximum average interference power Γ receives higher
    values. Viewing this from a different angle, it indicates that as the distance
    between the primary receiver and the secondary transmitter increases, more transmit
    power is allocated during the spectrum sharing periods and the WSSS scheme can
    achieve higher total ergodic capacity compared to the WOSA scheme. Fig. 5. Total
    ergodic throughput versus total transmit power P av under P( H 0,j )=0.6 for different
    values of average interference power Γ for the wideband opportunistic spectrum
    access and sensing-based spectrum sharing cognitive radio network. Show All Fig.
    6. Total ergodic throughput versus total transmit power P av under P( H o,j )=0.8
    for different values of average interference power Γ for the wideband opportunistic
    spectrum access and sensing-based spectrum sharing cognitive radio network. Show
    All In Fig. 7, the optimal sensing time versus the total transmit power is presented
    for the WSSS and the WOSA cognitive radio network under P( H 0,j )=0.6 and Γ=−10
    dB It can be observed that the optimal sensing time for both schemes (WSSS and
    WOSA) increases as the total transmit power receives higher values, whereas the
    optimal sensing time for the WOSA is slightly higher compared to the respective
    of the WSSS. However, as discussed in [11], it is better in practice to fix the
    sensing time for a good protocol design. It can be seen from Fig. 4 that the total
    ergodic throughput varies slightly around the peak value for both schemes (WSSS
    and WOSA) and therefore by fixing the sensing time, the resulting loss in the
    throughput is not significant. For instant, if we fix the sensing time to be optimal
    for the highest total transmit power P av =20 dB, the respective throughput losses
    for lower values of total transmit power for the WSSS and the WOSA cognitive radio
    network are presented in Table I and Table II, respectively. It can be observed
    that the resulting losses are actually very small and a rather interesting result
    that can be deduced from Tables I and Table II is that by fixing the sensing time,
    the total throughput losses are insignificant regardless of the scheme that the
    cognitive radio network employs. This means that the cognitive radio network could
    change the transmission scheme from wideband opportunistic spectrum access (WOSA)
    to wideband sensing-based spectrum sharing (WSSS) without having to change the
    sensing time of its (secondary) users, hence being able to increasing its total
    throughput by employing cognitive behavior and adapting its transmission scheme
    to its environment. Table I: Optimal sensing time for WSSS and P av =20 dB Table
    II: Optimal sensing time for WOSA and P av =20 dB Fig. 7. Optimal sensing time
    versus total transmit power P av under P( H 0,j )=0.6 and Γ=−10 dB for the wideband
    opportunistic spectrum access and sensing-based spectrum sharing cognitive radio
    network. Show All Finally, the optimal sensing time versus the maximum average
    interference power Γ is presented in Fig. 8 for the WSSS and the WOSA cognitive
    radio network under P( H 0,j )=0.6 and P av =20 dB. It can be seen from Fig. 8
    that the optimal sensing time for the wideband opportunistic spectrum access (WOSA)
    system is slightly higher compared to the respective of the wideband sensing-based
    spectrum sharing (WSSS) system, whereas the optimal sensing time for both schemes
    decreases as the maximum average interference power Γ receives higher values.
    Again, if we fix the sensing time for instance to the optimal solution for the
    lowest value of the maximum average interference power Γ=−20 dB the resulting
    losses in the total ergodic throughput of the cognitive radio network for higher
    values of maximum average interference power Γ , as well as for the other transmission
    scheme in each case, are small, something that can be seen in Table III and Table
    IV, where the throughput losses for the WSSS and the WOSA cognitive radio system
    are presented, respectively. Table III: Optimal sensing time for WSSS and Γ=−20
    dB Table IV: Optimal sensing time for WOSA and Γ=−20 dB Fig. 8. Optimal sensing
    time versus maximum average interference power Γ under P( H 0,j )=0.6 and P av
    =20 dB for the wideband opportunistic spectrum access and sensing-based spectrum
    sharing cognitive radio network. Show All SECTION VI Conclusions In this paper,
    we studied the problem of designing the optimal sensing time and power allocation
    strategy that maximizes the ergodic throughput of a wideband sensing-based spectrum
    sharing (WSSS) cognitive radio network and a wideband opportunistic spectrum access
    (WOSA) cognitive radio network under both average transmit and interference power
    constraints. We proposed two algorithms that acquire the optimal sensing time
    and power allocation strategy under imperfect spectrum sensing and discussed the
    effects of the total average transmit power and the average tolerable interference
    power on the optimal sensing time. Numerical results indicate that the wideband
    sensing-based spectrum sharing (WSSS) scheme exhibits higher ergodic throughput
    compared to the wideband opportunistic spectrum access (WOSA) scheme as the average
    tolerable interference power receives higher values or as the distance between
    the secondary transmitter and the primary receiver increases, whereas the optimal
    sensing time was shown to be vary slightly with respect to the total transmit
    power, the average tolerable interference power and the secondary transmission
    scheme used (WSSS/WOSA). ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to thank the anonymous

    to improve the utilization of radio frequency spectrum in wireless networks. In
    this paper, we consider the problem of spectrum sharing among a primary user and
    multiple secondary users. We formulate this problem as an oligopoly market competition
    and use a noncooperative game to obtain the spectrum allocation for secondary
    users. Nash equilibrium is considered as the solution of this game. We first present
    the formulation of a static game for the case where all secondary users have the
    current information of the adopted strategies and the payoff of each other. However,
    this assumption may not be realistic in some cognitive radio systems. Therefore,
    we consider the case of bounded rationality in which the secondary users gradually
    and iteratively adjust their strategies based on the observations on their previous
    strategies. The speed of adjustment of the strategies is controlled by the learning
    rate. The stability condition of the dynamic behavior for this spectrum sharing
    scheme is investigated. The numerical results reveal the dynamics of distributed
    dynamic adaptation of spectrum sharing strategies. Published in: IEEE Transactions

    Publisher: IEEE I. Introduction Frequency spectrum, which is the scarcest resource
    for wireless communications, may become congested to accommodate diverse type
    of users, applications, and air interfaces in the next generation wireless networks.
    The concepts of software defined radio and cognitive radio were introduced to
    enhance the efficiency of frequency spectrum usage [1]. Software radio improves
    the capability of a wireless transceiver by using embedded software to enable
    the radio transceiver to operate in multiple frequency bands by using multiple
    transmission protocols. Cognitive ratio is a special type of software defined
    radio which is able to estimate the communication parameters and can intelligently
    adapt itself to the changing environment. In order to achieve the desired objective
    (e.g., to maximize throughput and channel utilization), intelligent decision making
    algorithms would be required for cognitive radios. Sign in to Continue Reading

    Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: In this paper,
    a new spectrum sharing model called sensing-based spectrum sharing is proposed
    for cognitive radio networks. This model consists of two phases: in the first
    phase, the secondary user (SU) listens to the spectrum allocated to primary user
    (PU) to detect the state of PU; in the second phase, SU adapts its transit power
    based on the sensing results. If the PU is inactive, the SU allocates the transmission
    power based on its own benefit. However, if the PU is active, interference power
    constraint is imposed in order to protect the PU. By studying the ergodic capacity
    of SU, we show that this spectrum sharing model can achieve a higher capacity
    of SU link and improve the spectrum utilization compared to conventional opportunistic
    spectrum access or simple spectrum sharing. Using the dual decomposition method,
    we find the optimal power allocation policies and the optimal sensing time for
    fading channels to achieve the ergodic capacity of the SU link considering both
    transmit and interference power constraints. Finally, the numerical results are
    presented to validate the analytical results. Published in: IEEE GLOBECOM 2008

    to people''s life by wireless products, 21st century has witnessed a great increase
    of wireless devices and applications. However, with most of the radio spectrum
    being already allocated based on the traditional fixed spectrum allocation policy,
    the compelling need of radio spectrum to accommodate more upcoming wireless applications
    poses a serious problem for the future development of the wireless communications.
    On the other hand, a recent report published by the Federal Communication Commission

    Metrics Abstract: Cognitive radio has been proposed in recent years to promote
    the spectrum utilization by exploiting the existence of spectrum holes. The heterogeneity
    of both spectrum availability and traffic demand in secondary users has brought
    significant challenge for efficient spectrum allocation in cognitive radio networks.
    Observing that spectrum resource can be better matched to traffic demand of secondary
    users with the help of relay node that has rich spectrum resource, in this paper
    we exploit a new research direction for cognitive radio networks by utilizing
    cooperative relay to assist the transmission and improve spectrum efficiency.
    An infrastructure-based secondary network architecture has been proposed to leverage
    relay-assisted discontiguous OFDM (D-OFDM) for data transmission. In this architecture,
    relay node will be selected which can bridge the source and the destination using
    its common channels between those two nodes. With the introduction of cooperative
    relay, many unique problems should be considered, especially the issue for relay
    selection and spectrum allocation. We propose a centralized heuristic solution
    to address the new resource allocation problem. To demonstrate the feasibility
    and performance of cooperative relay for cognitive radio, a new MAC protocol has
    been proposed and implemented in a Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP)-based
    testbed. Experimental results show that the throughput of the whole system is
    greatly increased by exploiting the benefit of cooperative relay. Published in:

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Rio de Janeiro, Brazil I Introduction The
    electromagnetic radio spectrum is limited and valuable resource, which is tightly
    managed by governments. Recent reports shown significantly unbalanced usage of
    spectrum: some frequency bands are largely unoccupied most of the time; some other
    frequency bands are only partially occupied; the remaining frequency bands are
    heavily used [1]. Spectrum utilization can be improved significantly by allowing
    secondary users to access spectrum holes unoccupied by primary users. Cognitive
    radio [2] has been proposed as the means for secondary users to promote the efficient
    utilization of the spectrum by exploiting the existence of spectrum holes. Sign

    domains, notably the release of the National Broadband Plan, the publication of
    final rules for TV white spaces, and the ongoing proceeding for secondary use
    of the 2360-2400 MHz band for medical body area networks, will allow more flexible
    and efficient use of spectrum in the future. These important changes open up exciting
    opportunities for cognitive radio to enable and support a variety of emerging
    applications, ranging from smart grid, public safety and broadband cellular, to
    medical applications. This article presents a high-level view on how cognitive
    radio (primarily from a dynamic spectrum access perspective) would support such
    applications, the benefits that cognitive radio would bring, and also some challenges
    that are yet to be resolved. We also illustrate related standardization that uses
    cognitive radio technologies to support such emerging applications. Published

    Publisher: IEEE Introduction Current spectrum allocations are based on a command-and-control
    philosophy; that is, spectrum is allocated for a particular application (e.g.,
    TV broadcasting), and such allocations do not change over space and time. There
    have been several important developments in the past few years in the spectrum
    policy and regulatory domains to accelerate opportunistic uses of spec-trum. The
    most recent of these are the publication of the National Broadband Plan in March
    2010 [1], the publication of the final rules for unlicensed devices in the TV
    bands in September 2010 [2], and the ongoing proceeding for secondary use of the
    2360–2400 MHz band for medical body area networks (MBANS) [3]. Cognitive radio
    (CR) technology plays a significant role in making the best use of scarce spectrum
    to support the increasing demand for emerging wireless applications, such as TV
    bands for smart grid, public safety, broadband cellular, and the MBAN band for
    medical applications. In order to take advantage of these new opportuni-ties,
    a number of standards (e.g. IEEE 802.22 [4], IEEE 802.11af, ECMA 392 [5], IEEE
    SCC41, and ETSI RRS [6]) are either in development or have already been completed.

    Metrics Abstract: "Cognitive radio" is an emerging technique to improve the utilization
    of radio frequency spectrum in wireless networks. In this paper, we consider the
    problem of spectrum sharing among a primary user and multiple secondary users.
    We formulate this problem as an oligopoly market competition and use a Cournot
    game to obtain the spectrum allocation for secondary users. Nash equilibrium is
    considered as the solution of this game. We first present the formulation of a
    static Cournot game for the case when all secondary users can observe the adopted
    strategies and the payoff of each other. However, this assumption may not be realistic
    in some cognitive radio systems. Therefore, we formulate a dynamic Cournot game
    in which the strategy of one secondary user is selected solely based on the pricing
    information obtained from the primary user. The stability condition of the dynamic
    behavior for this spectrum sharing scheme is investigated. Published in: 2007

    I. Introduction Frequency spectrum, which is the scarcest resource for wireless
    communications, may become congested to accommodate diverse type of users, applications,
    and air interfaces in the next generation wireless networks. The concepts of software
    defined radio and cognitive radio were introduced to enhance the efficiency of
    frequency spectrum usage [1]. Software radio improves the capability of a wireless
    transceiver by using embedded software to enable the radio transceiver to operate
    in multiple frequency bands by using multiple transmission protocols. Cognitive
    radio is a special type of software defined radio which is able to estimate the
    communication parameters (e.g., spectrum sharing and allocation) and can intelligently
    adapt itself to the changing environment. Intelligent decision making algorithms
    are keys to the implementation of cognitive radio to achieve the desired system
    objectives (e.g., maximize throughput and channel utilization). Sign in to Continue

    increasing amount of interest over the past few years as an effective method of
    alleviating the spectrum scarcity problem in wireless communications. One of the
    most promising approaches in cognitive radio is the opportunistic spectrum access,
    which enables unlicensed users to access licensed frequency bands that are detected
    to be idle. In this paper, we propose a novel cognitive radio system that exhibits
    improved throughput and spectrum sensing capabilities compared to the conventional
    opportunistic spectrum access cognitive radio systems studied so far. More specifically,
    we study the average achievable throughput of the proposed cognitive radio system
    under a single high target detection probability constraint, as well as its ergodic
    throughput under average transmit and interference power constraints, and propose
    an algorithm that acquires the optimal power allocation strategy and target detection
    probability, which under the imposed average interference power constraint becomes
    an additional optimization variable in the ergodic throughput maximization problem.
    Finally, we provide simulation results, in order to compare the achievable throughput
    of the proposed cognitive radio system with the respective throughput of the conventional
    cognitive radio systems and discuss the effects of the optimal power allocation
    and target detection probability on the ergodic throughput of the proposed cognitive
    radio system. Published in: IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications ( Volume:

    Introduction Cognitive radio is a new promising technology that aims to alleviate
    the spectrum scarcity problem in wireless communications by allowing access of
    unlicensed (secondary) users to frequency bands that are allocated to licensed
    (primary) users, in a way that does not affect the quality of service (QoS) of
    the licensed networks [1], [2]. The research in cognitive radio has been encouraged
    by the measurements of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which have
    revealed that there is a significant amount of licensed spectrum which is largely
    underutilized in vast temporal and geographic dimensions [3]. The FCC recognizing
    that there is a significant amount of available spectrum that is currently not
    being used under the current fixed spectrum allocation policy, has recently allowed
    the access of unlicensed (secondary) users to the broadcast television spectrum
    at locations where that spectrum is not being used by licensed services [4]. This
    unused broadcast television spectrum is often termed as “white spaces” and has
    been the focus of the IEEE 802.22 WRAN standard that aims to provide broadband
    wireless internet access to rural areas [5]. Sign in to Continue Reading Authors

    Abstract: We consider a point-to-multipoint cognitive radio network that shares
    a set of channels with a primary network. Within the cognitive radio network,
    a base station controls and supports a set of fixed-location wireless subscribers.
    The objective is to maximize the throughput of the cognitive network while not
    affecting the performance of primary users. Both downlink and uplink transmission
    scenarios in the cognitive network are considered. For both scenarios, we propose
    two-phase mixed distributed/centralized control algorithms that require minimal
    cooperation between cognitive and primary devices. In the first phase, a distributed
    power updating process is employed at the cognitive and primary nodes to maximize
    the coverage of the cognitive network while always maintaining the constrained
    signal to interference plus noise ratio of primary transmissions. In the second
    phase, centralized channel assignment is carried out within the cognitive network
    to maximize its throughput. Numerical results are obtained for the behaviors and
    performance of our proposed algorithms. Published in: IEEE Transactions on Mobile

    The traditional approach of fixed spectrum allocation to licensed networks leads
    to spectrum underutilization. In recent studies by the FCC, it is reported that
    there are vast temporal and spatial variations in the usage of allocated spectrum,
    which can be as low as 15 percent [1]. This motivates the concepts of opportunistic
    spectrum access that allows secondary cognitive radio networks to opportunistically
    exploit the underutilized spectrum. In fact, opportunistic spectrum access has
    been encouraged by both recent FCC policy initiatives and IEEE standardization

    We consider a cognitive radio network in which a set of base stations make opportunistic
    spectrum access to support fixed-location wireless subscribers within their cells.
    The spectrum of interest is divided into independent channels using frequency
    division multiple access (FDMA) and is licensed to the operator of a primary network.
    Channel assignment and power control must be carried out in the cognitive network
    so that no excessive interference is caused to users of the primary network. We
    are interested in the downlink channel/power allocation problem for the cognitive
    radio network, with the objective of maximizing the total number of active subscribers
    that can be supported. Here, we assume that each subscriber of the cognitive network
    can be either active or idle and only active subscribers require downlink transmission.
    We first consider the case when global knowledge of all active subscribers is
    available for making control decisions. In that case, a downlink channel/power
    allocation scheme that maximizes the number of supported subscribers can be obtained
    by solving a mixed-integer linear programming. We also propose a suboptimal scheme
    that can be obtained at lower complexity based on a dynamic interference graph.
    We then consider the case when control decisions can only be made based on local
    knowledge of active subscribers within each cell. For that, we propose a scalable
    two-phase channel/power allocation scheme. Numerical results show the effectiveness
    of our proposed schemes. Published in: IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications

    Metrics Abstract: We consider a cognitive radio network in which a set of base
    stations make opportunistic unlicensed spectrum access to transmit data to their
    subscribers. As the spectrum of interest is licensed to another (primary) network,
    power and channel allocation must be carried out within the cognitive radio network
    so that no excessive interference is caused to any primary user. We are interested
    in spectrum-allocation/power-control schemes that maximize the spectrum utilization
    of the cognitive network while appropriately protecting primary users. While doing
    so, the control schemes must also meet the required signal to interference plus
    noise ratio (SINR) of each subscriber of the cognitive network. This problem can
    be formulated as a linear mixed (0-1) integer programming. Due to the high complexity
    in obtaining optimal spectrum-allocation/power-control schemes, we propose a suboptimal
    scheme that can be obtained at lower complexity while still achieving good spectrum
    utilization. This suboptimal scheme is constructed based on the idea of a dynamic
    interference graph that captures the interfering effects. Numerical studies of
    our control scheme are presented. Published in: IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference

    spatial variations in the usage of allocated spectrum, which can be as low as
    15% [1]. This motivates the concepts of opportunistic unlicenced spectrum access
    that allows secondary cognitive radio networks to opportunistically exploit the
    underulizized spectrum. In fact, opportunistic spectrum access has been encouraged
    by both recent FCC policy initiatives and IEEE standadization activities [2],
    [3]. Sign in to Continue Reading Authors Figures References Citations Keywords

    Citations Keywords Metrics Footnotes Abstract: Dynamic spectrum access is a new
    spectrum sharing paradigm that allows secondary users to access the abundant spectrum
    holes or white spaces in the licensed spectrum bands. DSA is a promising technology
    to alleviate the spectrum scarcity problem and increase spectrum utilization.
    While DSA has attracted many research efforts recently, in this article, we discuss
    the challenges of DSA and aim to shed light on its future. We first give an introduction
    to the state-of- the-art in spectrum sensing and spectrum sharing. Then, we examine
    the challenges that prevent DSA from major commercial deployment. We believe that,
    to address these challenges, a new DSA model is critical, where the licensed users
    cooperate in DSA and hence much more flexible spectrum sharing is possible. Furthermore,
    the future DSA model should consider the political, social, economic, and technological
    factors all together, to pave the way for the commercial success of DSA. To support
    this future DSA model, the future cognitive radio is expected to have additional
    components and capabilities, to enforce policy, provide incentive and coexistence
    mechanisms, etc. We call the future cognitive radio with the expanded capabilities
    a network radio, and discuss its architecture as well as the design issues for
    future DSA. Published in: IEEE Wireless Communications ( Volume: 19, Issue: 1,

    DOI: 10.1109/MWC.2012.6155873 Publisher: IEEE Introduction Traditionally, the
    spectrum allocation policy grants a fixed spectrum band to a licensed user for
    exclusive access. While this policy has worked well in past decades, the proliferated
    wireless services in recent years have unveiled the drawback of this policy: it
    results in spectrum scarcity. On the other hand, a significant amount of licensed
    spectrum is considerably underutilized in both the temporal and spatial domains.
    These unused spectrum bands in the temporal and/or spatial domain, called spectrum
    holes or white spaces, offer a great opportunity for wireless communications.
    Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) is a new spectrum sharing paradigm that utilizes
    the spectrum holes and hence alleviates the spectrum scarcity problem as well
    as increases spectrum utilization. With DSA, secondary users (SUs) dynamically
    search for idle spectrum bands, and temporarily access them for wireless communications.
    To avoid interference to primary users (PUs), SUs continuously monitor the spectrum
    bands and yield to PUs whenever PUs start using a band. Sign in to Continue Reading

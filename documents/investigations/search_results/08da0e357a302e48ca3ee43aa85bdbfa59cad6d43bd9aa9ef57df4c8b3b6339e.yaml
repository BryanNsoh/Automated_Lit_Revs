  description: Accurate yield estimation and optimised nitrogen management is essential
    in agriculture. Remote sensing (RS) systems are being more widely used in building
    decision support tools for contemporary farming systems to improve yield production
    and nitrogen management while reducing operating costs and environmental impact.
    However, RS based approaches require processing of enormous amounts of remotely
    sensed data from different platforms and, therefore, greater attention is currently
    being devoted to machine learning (ML) methods. This is due to the capability
    of machine learning based systems to process a large number of inputs and handle
    non-linear tasks. This paper discusses research developments conducted within
    the last 15 years on machine learning based techniques for accurate crop yield
    prediction and nitrogen status estimation. The paper concludes that the rapid
    advances in sensing technologies and ML techniques will provide cost-effective
    and comprehensive solutions for better crop and environment state estimation and
    decision making. More targeted application of the sensor platforms and ML techniques,
    the fusion of different sensor modalities and expert knowledge, and the development
    of hybrid systems combining different ML and signal processing techniques are
    all likely to be part of precision agriculture (PA) in the near future.

    modellingDecision makingInformation fusion 1. Introduction Improving crop yield
    production and quality while reducing operating costs and environmental pollution
    is a key goal in precision agriculture (PA). The potential growth and yield depends
    on many different production attributes such as the weather, soil properties,
    topography, irrigation and fertilizer management. The need for timely and accurate
    sensing of these inputs for large agricultural fields has led to increased adoption
    of remote and proximal sensing technologies (Campbell and Wynne, 2011) in PA (Curran,
    1987). These sensing techniques provide acquisition of spectral, spatial and temporal
    information about the objects via ground-based vehicles, aircraft, satellites
    and handheld radiometers. Remote sensing, such as satellite and airborne multi-spectral
    scanning, photography and video, enables precision weed management through the
    generation of timely and accurate weed maps (Lamb and Brown, 2001). Thermal remote
    sensing via airborne thermal imagery has the potential to identify spatial variations
    in crop water status (Tilling et al., 2006), which can enable improvements in
    the water management in irrigated cropping systems. Nowadays, this remote sensing
    technique is widely used in different crop species such as wheat (Gontia and Tiwari,
    2008), maize (Taghvaeian et al., 2012), trees (Bellvert et al., 2016) and vineyards
    (Gutiérrez et al., 2018). At the same time many ground-based platforms have been
    developed and aimed at different PA tasks such as mapping of soil properties (Barnes
    et al., 2003), estimating evapotranspiration and drought stress (Maes and Steppe,
    2012), weed mapping (Sui et al., 2008) and assessing crop water and nitrogen status
    (El-Shikha et al., 2007, Govender et al., 2009). Remote sensing at visible and
    near-infrared wavelengths (vis-NIR) has been used to devise many spectral indices
    for estimating different vegetation properties. This includes the amount of chlorophylls
    and other photosynthetic/photoprotective pigments and the leaf area index (LAI)
    (Barati et al., 2011, Gao, 1996, Haboudane et al., 2004, Huete, 1988, Qi et al.,
    1994, Sims and Gamon, 2002, Viña et al., 2011, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2012). More
    than 100 vegetation indices along with their applicability, representativeness,
    environment and implementation precision have recently been reviewed by Xue and
    Su (2017). They concluded that for real-world applications the use of any existing
    vegetation indices requires careful consideration of the strengths and shortcomings
    of those indices and the specific environment where they will be applied. Making
    crop yield predictions using remotely sensed vegetation indices has been attempted
    by Panda et al., 2010, Jaafar and Ahmad, 2015 and many others. Utilization of
    wireless sensors and actuators in PA, as well as algorithms for wireless sensor
    network data integration is now advancing (Zhou et al., 2012). Aqeel-ur-Rehman
    et al. (2014) presented a review on wireless sensor network technology and their
    applications in different aspects of agriculture and reported on existing system
    frameworks in PA. Nitrogen (N) is considered by growers as a major mineral nutrient
    for plant growth and development because it is directly related to the photosynthetic
    process (Andrews et al., 2013). At the same time N has a high environmental and
    economic impact. Hence, the optimization of N fertilization for different crops
    has become a subject of many spectrometric studies (Cao et al., 2017, Chen et
    al., 2008, Goron et al., 2017, Lukina et al., 2001, MacKerron et al., 1993, Maresma
    et al., 2016, Quemada et al., 2014, Raun et al., 2005, Schepers and Raun, 2008).
    The estimation of the plant N status can be divided into two main types: destructive
    and non-destructive. The most common method of destructive measurement is a chemical
    analysis which is associated with the Kjeldahl technique and is laborious, lengthy
    and costly (Jones and Moseley, 1993, Vigneau et al., 2011). Optical remote sensing
    of the plant N status is a non-destructive method based on canopy reflectance
    in the visible–NIR wavelengths (400–900 nm). This measurement is completed in-situ,
    lowering the number of field samples required and thus reducing the time and financial
    cost of field sample collection, preparation and laboratory analysis. Many studies
    have been dedicated to non-destructive measurement of the N status inferring in
    plants via remote sensing technology (Apostol et al., 2007, Lamb et al., 2002,
    Reyniers and Vrindts, 2006, Scharf et al., 2002, Tremblay et al., 2012) and spectral
    indices indicative of the plant N status have been derived from hyperspectral
    data (Chen et al., 2010, Tian et al., 2014, Yao et al., 2010). Adoption of remote
    sensing in geology (Gupta, 2003), forestry (Holmgren and Thuresson, 1998, Hultquist
    et al., 2014), hydrology (Engman and Gurney, 1991), agriculture (Seelan et al.,
    2003) and other domains has led to the collection of significant volumes of data.
    The volume is continuously growing and it is beyond human ability to personally
    integrate, analyse and make the best informed decisions from the information.
    This is particularly the case when the data is not homogeneous, i.e. is sensed
    by sensors with different spatial, temporal and spectral modalities. Machine Learning
    (ML) is an emerging technology that can aid in the discovery of rules and patterns
    in large sets of data (Du and Jeffrey, 2007). Crop yield prediction and N status
    estimation are considered together here because of the direct linkage in fertiliser
    management decisions. Crop yield goals are routinely utilised for calculating
    N requirements, both pre- and in-season. For devising potential site-specific
    management plans for N fertiliser, especially in-season, an estimation of both
    would be ideal. The aim of this review is to show the capability of different
    ML techniques to effectively handle these different but closely related tasks.
    A review is presented of recent studies in the area of crop yield prediction and
    N status estimation, which incorporate different ML techniques. It also covers
    comparative studies of different ML techniques as they are applied to the same
    task in PA. Some technical aspects of the ML techniques used in the reviewed studies
    are discussed. 2. Machine learning techniques One of the main advantages of ML
    techniques is that they are capable of autonomously solving large non-linear problems
    using datasets from multiple (potentially interconnected) sources. Some ML techniques,
    such as Gaussian Processes (GPs) (Bishop, 2006, Rasmussen and Williams, 2005),
    Dirichlet Processes (DP) (Ferguson, 1973) and Indian Buffet Process (IBP) (Griffiths
    and Ghahramani, 2011) are probabilistic and enable consideration of sensor noise
    while conducting probabilistic fusion of information from different sensors (Castaldi
    et al., 2016, Dalponte et al., 2012, Pohl and Van Genderen, 1998) and providing
    confidence intervals for the predictions. ML enables better decision making and
    informed actions in real-world scenarios without (or with minimal) human intervention.
    ML provides a powerful and flexible framework for not only data-driven decision
    making but also for incorporation of expert knowledge into the system. These are
    some of the key characteristics of the ML techniques that make them widely used
    in many domains, and highly applicable to PA. The major aim of PA in cropping
    systems is to provide information that will enable better decisions to be made
    on management across space and time (Whelan and Taylor, 2013). Specifically, information
    on variation in plant health and physiology, nutrient status or pest/disease burden
    may allow different treatments or treatment intensity to be applied to specific
    areas of crop. The practical identification and segregation of areas is commonly
    achieved by dividing a large field area into smaller management zones with identified
    requirements for different treatments. Conventionally, such delineation is based
    on maps of the crop field variability derived from soil and yield measurements.
    Nawar et al. (2017) provided a comprehensive review on management zone delineation
    approaches for PA applications. They illustrated how recent developments in sensing
    technologies, geostatistical analysis, data fusion and interpolation techniques
    have improved precision and reliability of management zone delineation, making
    it a viable strategy in commercial agriculture. They also compared traditional
    with advanced sensing technologies for delineating management zones. Recently,
    Pantazi et al. (2015) demonstrated that the combination of data fusion modelling
    and clustering methods was able to improve the quality of management zone delineation.
    Specifically, they compared k-means clustering with the Self-Organizing Map (SOM)
    for delineating management zones maps for variable-rate N application. Furthermore,
    a hybrid SOM algorithm in combination with k-means was compared with k-means in
    terms of cluster separation and management zone formation based on data fusion
    of NDVI and soil parameters. As reviewed by Behmann et al. (2015), ML techniques
    have been widely used for the early and accurate detection of biotic stress in
    crop, specifically, for detection of weeds, plant diseases and insect pests. Mehra
    et al. (2016) used ML techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), categorical
    and regression trees and Random Forests (RFs) to approach the problem of predicting
    the pre-planting risk of Stagonospora nodorum blotch (SNB) in winter wheat. They
    developed risk assessment models that could be useful in making disease management
    decisions prior to planting of the wheat crop. Also Tellaeche et al. (2008) showed
    that cost savings and reduced pollution could be achieved by a Bayesian framework
    based automatic decision making process for detecting weeds in corn crops. Machine
    learning techniques applied to hyperspectral imaging data can be used to reveal
    physiological and structural characteristics in plants and enable tracking physiological
    dynamics due to environmental effects (Wahabzada et al., 2016). Goldstein et al.
    (2017) demonstrated that field data, such as soil moisture, weather, irrigation
    characteristics, and resulting yield could be fused via ML techniques to provide
    automated recommendations for irrigation. Gutiérrez et al. (2018) have used thermal
    imaging and a combination of two ML techniques (Rotation Forests and Decision
    Trees) to develop a new methodology for the on-the-go assessment of vineyard water
    status with potential for irrigation decision making. Machine learning techniques
    can be used in field spectroscopy for offline and online prediction of the soil
    parameters studied in the field (Morellos et al., 2016). They can work not only
    with variables such as derived spectral indices, but also with the entire spectral
    response trace (Wittenberghe et al., 2014). Spectral indices depend on a small
    number of available spectral bands and therefore don’t use the entire information
    conveyed by the spectral trace. Thus, there is always the question: which vegetation
    index or suite of vegetation indices is better for the given task? (Panda et al.,
    2010). ML techniques, such as Neural Networks, can be employed for automated extraction
    of relevant features from the data (You et al., 2017). Continuum-removal (CR)
    can be used to effectively isolate individual absorption features of interest
    and, for example, estimate the chemical concentration in dry leaves (Clark and
    Roush, 1984, Huang et al., 2004, Kokaly, 2001, Vigneau et al., 2011). After the
    automated extraction of features is performed, the ML techniques (e.g. BPNNs)
    can be used for automated crop yield prediction and assessing which feature is
    more informative (Panda et al., 2010). Due to the large number of bands in the
    hyperspectral data, some methods (e.g. Stepwise Multiple Linear Regression (SMLR))
    are likely to suffer from multicollinearity when applied to canopy hyperspectral
    data (Bolster et al., 1996, Grossman et al., 1996). Multicollinearity means that
    one predicted variable can be linearly predicted from the others with a substantial
    degree of accuracy. A Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) approach can be
    adopted to reduce the large number of measured collinear spectral variables to
    a few non-correlated latent variables. It avoids the potential overfitting problems
    that are typically associated with SMLR (Grossman et al., 1996, Hansen and Schjoerring,
    2003). Although Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are widely used in remote sensing
    to predict vegetation parameters and crop yield (Farifteh et al., 2007, Kaul et
    al., 2005, Kuwata and Shibasaki, 2015) and are generally used to deal with non-linear
    models, their practical application has some difficulties, such as selection of
    the number and size of hidden layers, learning rate, the need for a large training
    dataset and the problem of overfitting. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are also
    being used in PA and have the potential to resolve the problem of overfitting
    when analysing high-dimensional data such as hyperspectral imaging data. Applications
    of SVMs include crop type classification (Peña et al., 2014, Ustuner et al., 2014,
    Yang et al., 2016) and crop-weeds classification (Tellaeche et al., 2007). There
    are other ML techniques which may be used for different applications in PA. Advantages
    and disadvantages of some of them have been listed by Ali et al. (2015). Despite
    the significant recent developments in ML and the successful application in many
    areas, ML techniques have some fundamental limitations when used naively in a
    purely data-driven fashion. The accuracy of the predictions and their uncertainties
    produced by the ML algorithms strongly depend on the data quality, model representativeness
    and the dependencies between the input and target variables in the collected datasets.
    Data with a high level of noise, erroneous data, presence of outliers and biases
    in the data, and incomplete datasets may significantly reduce the predictive power
    of the models. The appropriate definition of the ML model, such as the GP covariance
    function, ANN architecture and SVR parametrisations is also critical for optimal
    performance. Many strategies, such as incorporation of expert knowledge into the
    covariance function, outlier detection, transfer learning, and model selection
    through automated cross-validation can be employed to overcome these limitations.
    3. Yield estimation Achieving maximum crop yield at minimum cost with a healthy
    ecosystem is one of the main goals of agricultural production. Early detection
    and management of problems associated with crop yield restrictions can help increase
    yield and subsequent profit, and estimating yield is important to numerous crop
    management and business decisions. In recent years different ML techniques have
    been implemented to achieve accurate yield prediction for different crops (Subhadra
    et al., 2016). The most successful ML techniques have been Artificial Neural Networks
    (Drummond et al., 2003, Fortin et al., 2011, Liu et al., 2001, Safa et al., 2004),
    Support Vector Regression (Ruß, 2009), M5-Prime Regression Trees (Frausto-Solis
    et al., 2009, Marinković et al., 2009, Ruß and Kruse, 2010, Wang and Witten, 1997)
    and k-nearest neighbour (Zhang et al., 2010). Recently, Gonzalez-Sanchez et al.
    (2014) presented a comparative study of ANN, SVR, M5-Prime, kNN ML techniques
    and Multiple Linear Regression for crop yield prediction in ten crop datasets.
    To validate the models they used four accuracy metrics: Root Mean Square Error
    (RMS), Root Relative Square Error (RRSE), Normalized Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
    and Correlation Factor (R). Results showed that M5-Prime achieved the lowest errors
    across the produced crop yield models. The results of that study ranked the techniques
    from the best to the worst, according to RMSE, RRSE, R, and MAE results, in the
    following order: M5-Prime, kNN, SVR, ANN and MLR. In another study Nari and Yang-Won
    (2016) applied four ML techniques, SVM, Random Forest (RF), Extremely Randomized
    Trees (ERT) and Deep Learning (DL) to estimate corn yield in Iowa State. Comparisons
    of the validation statistics showed that DL provided more stable results by overcoming
    the overfitting problem. As soil and climatic conditions play a significant role
    in crop growth and yield, online proximal soil sensing for estimation of relevant
    soil properties remains a missing component in the management system. Pantazi
    et al. (2016) predicted the within field variation in wheat yield using online
    multi-layer soil data and satellite imagery crop growth characteristics. They
    used supervised Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) in this work. The data for a single
    cropping season was used and the performance of counter-propagation artificial
    neural networks (CP-ANN), XY-fused Networks (XY-F) and Supervised Kohonen Networks
    (SKN) for predicting wheat yield was compared. The average overall accuracy for
    SKN was 81.65%, for CP-ANN was 78.3% and for XY-F was 80.92%, showing that the
    SKN model had the best overall performance. Spectral vegetation indices (VIs)
    are mathematical combinations (often ratios) of mainly red, green and infrared
    spectral bands. They are designed to find functional relationships between crop
    characteristics and remote sensing observations (Wiegand et al., 1979). Since
    the development of the Simple Ratio Index (SR) (Birth and McVey, 1968, Jordan,
    1969, Knipling, 1970) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) (Johnson,
    2014, Rouse et al., 1973, Tucker, 1979) a large number of vegetation indices have
    been developed, such as the two-band Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI2) (Bolton
    and Friedl, 2013) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) (Satir and Berberoglu,
    2016) to name a few. The availability of a large number of indices leads to the
    need to optimally choose and combine indices for maximally accurate crop yield
    estimation. Panda et al. (2010) implemented Back-propagation Neural Network (BPNN)
    modelling to test the efficiency of the following four spectral vegetation indices:
    NDVI, green vegetation index (GVI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) and
    perpendicular vegetation index (PVI) in corn crop yield prediction. The results
    showed that the corn yield was best predicted using BPNN models that used the
    means and standard deviations of PVI grid images. Although spectral vegetation
    indices are widely used, they depend only on a small number (usually two) of the
    available image bands and the full spectrum information in hyperspectral data
    is not exploited. In their recent publication You et al. (2017) used Convolutional
    Neural Network (CNN) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) to automatically discover
    relevant features from raw data. Deep Gaussian Process was employed to integrate
    the spatio-temporal information from the data. They evaluated the proposed approach
    on the task of predicting county-level soybean production in the United States.
    The results of this study showed that the proposed approach outperformed competing
    techniques by a large margin. Yuan et al. (2015) addressed the problem of selection
    of the most representative bands to reduce the dimensionality of the data while
    maximally preserving its original information. They proposed a group-wise band
    selection framework, with a joint sparsity constraint, which is fully unsupervised
    and computationally feasible. They conducted experiments on hyperspectral classification
    and colour visualisation. The results of those experiments demonstrated that,
    in these two applications, the proposed framework is more robust and reliable
    compared to the other state of the art alternatives (e.g. traditional pointwise-selection-based
    methods). To make a timely prediction of crop yield, the Spiking Neural Networks
    (SNN) model has been presented by Bose et al. (2016). It introduces for the first
    time SNN as a promising technique for spatio-temporal data modelling, analysis,
    and land use/crop prediction. As deep learning has the capability to extract key
    features from the data for estimation, it can be expected to have less dependency
    on the input data. Because of this, even in areas where data acquisition is limited,
    deep learning can be expected to provide good quality estimation of crop yield
    (Kuwata and Shibasaki, 2015). Many other studies have been conducted on the application
    of ML techniques to crop yield estimation from remotely sensed and in-situ data.
    Table 1. presents a review of the studies and provides a summary, methodology
    and discussion for each publication. This discussion is concentrated on some key
    technical aspects of the used ML techniques. Table 1. Publications that use machine
    learning techniques for crop yield estimation with a focus on their technical
    aspects. Paper Summary Methodology Discussion Pantazi et al. (2016) This paper
    developed and evaluated a yield prediction model for wheat. For the yield prediction
    the fusion vectors have been used as input for the three ANNs. The fusion vectors
    consist of the values of the eight soil parameters collected with the on-line
    soil sensor, the satellite imagery calculated NDVI values and historic yield data
    from the previous two years. Self-Organizing Map Models (SOMs): • Counter-Propagation
    Artificial Neural Networks (CPANN) • XY-Fused Networks (XY-Fs) • Supervised Kohonen
    Networks (SKNs) The presented approach incorporates the yield limiting factors
    in a multi-layer fusion model.  Stas et al. (2016) The paper presented a comparison
    of two machine learning techniques (BRT and SVM) for prediction of winter wheat
    yield in Henan province of China. Three types of NDVI-related predictors have
    been used: Single NDVI, Incremental NDVI and Targeted NDVI. The results of comparison,
    which are based on a cross-validation error (RMSE), showed that BRT model consistently
    outperforms SVM. • Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) • Support Vector Machines (SVM)
    When a limited number of training samples is available, ML techniques used in
    this paper are better able to cope with large set of predictors (compared to MLR)  Heremans
    et al. (2015) In this paper two regression tree methods (BRT and RF) were used
    in order to evaluate the accuracy of winter wheat yield, using NDVI data from
    the SPOT-VEGETATION sensor together with meteorological variables and fertilization
    levels, in the North China. The aim was not only to compare the performance of
    the methods but also to assess the potential for early-season predictions of winter
    wheat yield at the prefecture level (five prefectures were involved). The comparison
    of methods was based on cross-validation R2 and RMSE. The results showed that
    BRT outperforms RF for four out of the five prefectures. • Boosted Regression
    Trees (BRT) • Random Forest (RF) BRT is sensitive to noise, prone to overfitting
    and much slower than bagging. At the same time, boosting has been shown to be
    more accurate than bagging. RF can be used to improve the performance of bagging.
    In terms of accuracy, RFs are comparable to boosting but don’t have the mentioned
    limitations. RF has much lower computational cost than boosting  Liang et al.
    (2015) The paper presented a non-destructive method - the hybrid inversion method,
    for estimation of leaf area index (LAI) values of crops. The method used different
    regression algorithms and allowed determining the relationships between optimal
    simulated VIs and simulated LAI values. To establish hybrid inversion model ANN
    and RFR have been used.The comparison of the used algorithms showed that RFR was
    a better method for modelling with the higher R2 and lower RMSE values for different
    datasets and various VIs. • Curve fitting • Artificial Neural Network (ANN) •
    Random Forest Regression (RFR) In contrast to full-spectrum approaches, using
    VIs to estimate LAI requires a reduction in the number of model input parameters
    and therefore may result in lower inversion accuracy. However, RFR can enable
    good performance with several or even a single parameter if that input parameter
    is highly correlated and representative.  Wu et al. (2015) This paper developed
    and compared two inversion models, using Statistical Regression model and BPNN
    model, to estimate the LAI of a temperate meadow steppe in China. The results
    of comparison showed that BPNN method (accuracy: 82.2%) outperforms Statistical
    Regression model (accuracy: 78.8%). • Statistical Regression Model • BPNN BPNN
    refers to a broad family of ANNs where the error is calculated at the output layer
    (using the observations) and is propagated back through the layers of the ANN.
    The optimisation process adjusts the weights in each layer by minimising the pre-defined
    loss function.  Jin et al. (2016) In the paper the particle swarm optimization
    (PSO) algorithm was used to assimilate field spectroscopic data into the AquaCrop
    model to improve the estimation accuracy of winter wheat yield under different
    planting dates and irrigation management strategies. The results showed that the
    PSO algorithm is an effective method for improving the estimates of biomass and
    yield of winter wheat. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm Particle Swarm
    Optimization (PSO) algorithm can be used to minimise the difference between the
    regression based and AquaCrop model based estimates. This helps to improve the
    predictions.  Li et al. (2016) The paper aimed to produce accurate and timely
    predictions of grassland LAI for the meadow steppes of northern China, using different
    regression approaches and hybrid geostatistical methods. The comparison of predictions
    via hybrid geostatistical methods, followed by different regression models was
    presented. The results showed that the RF model provides the most accurate predictions
    among the regression models. • Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) • ANNs
    • RFs • Regression Kriging (RK) • Random Forests Residuals Kriging (RFRK) RFs
    can provide better resistance to the over-fitting problem and to noise in the
    data compared with other regression methods. However, RF method ignores spatial
    autocorrelation information. RFRK is an extension of RF and is very similar to
    RK. It helps to include the spatial autocorrelation into the RF  Papageorgiou
    et al. (2013) The paper mainly aimed to present a method, based on FCM learning
    technique, to develop a computational intelligent tool for categorizing apple
    fruit yield. The results showed that the knowledge-based FCM learning approach
    predicts properly the phenomenon, gives a front-end decision about the class of
    apple fruit yield, and provides similar results to those obtained from horticulturist
    experts. • Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping (FCM) The FCM method has many advantages such
    as simplicity, adaptability and capability of approximating abstractive structures.
    FCMs are knowledge-based and, therefore, provide meaningful results. As FCMs are
    mainly constructed manually, data-driven learning algorithms are required when
    dealing with a large number of variables.  Papageorgiou et al. (2011) The main
    aim of the paper was to connect yield defining parameters with yield in cotton
    crop production in Central Greece. The simulation approach based on the soft computing
    technique of Fuzzy Cognitive Maps was investigated (FCM tool). The data from six
    subsequent years were used to estimate the average classification accuracy of
    the yield production, using the FCM tool. The results of estimation were compared
    with results of some ML techniques obtained from the same data. The results of
    comparison based on the overall accuracy of each method showed that the FCM technique
    performed better in most of the cases. • Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping (FCM) • ANNs
    • Decision Trees (DTs) • Bayesian Networks (BNs) Fuzzy cognitive Map (FCM) represents
    a combination of neural networks and fuzzy logic, and can be used for information
    representation and decision making in complex processing environments. In particular,
    FCMs can be used to model and represent expert knowledge for cotton yield prediction
    and crop management  Kaul et al. (2005) The paper described the development of
    ANN models as an accurate technique for corn and soybean yield prediction in Maryland
    nutrient management planning. The results showed that ANN yield prediction is
    more accurate than the MLR-based yield model. • Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
    • Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) ANN and MLR are among the techniques that can
    be used for agricultural modelling and prediction. The MLR is a simple methodology
    which is also easy to apply. ANN is a much more sophisticated technique the difficulties
    of the practical application of which are described in Section 2. 4. Precision
    nitrogen management As nitrogen (N) plays a significant role in the process of
    photosynthesis, it is important for crop health and development. At the same time,
    environmental factors and cost require a prudent application of N. Because of
    these factors the problem of optimal N management has attracted the attention
    of numerous researchers (Cao et al., 2015, Cao et al., 2017, Dai et al., 2013,
    Magney et al., 2017, Zhao et al., 2013). One of the approaches to optimal N management
    in PA is to use management zones, that is, identify subfield regions with homogeneous
    characteristics that require similar treatment. The most widely used methods for
    delineation of site-specific management zones are the fuzzy C-means and k-means
    algorithms (Schuster et al., 2011, Vrindts et al., 2005). These are popular clustering
    methods used extensively for unsupervised learning and identification of structure
    in datasets. However, determining subfield areas is a difficult task because of
    the complex correlations and spatial variability of soil properties and nutrient
    concentrations, which are responsible for variations in crop yield within the
    field. The non-destructive methods for making N fertilizer recommendations for
    crops are commonly based on plant N status testing, using remote sensing and in-situ
    data (Cilia et al., 2014, Maresma et al., 2016, Tremblay et al., 2011). Cao et
    al. (2015) evaluated two sensor systems, based on a three band user-configurable
    Crop Circle ACS-470 sensor and a two fixed-band GreenSeeker sensor, in order to
    estimate winter wheat N status. The results of the comparison demonstrated that
    the winter wheat N status can be better predicted via the three band Crop Circle
    ACS-470 sensor. A comprehensive review of the advantages and disadvantages of
    different methods for sensing the N status in plants has been conducted by Muñoz-Huerta
    et al. (2013). Diacono et al. (2013) produced a review of precision N management
    of a wheat crop. They investigated approaches/results of site-specific N management
    of wheat to analyse both performance and sustainability of this agricultural practice.
    However, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, there are no published review
    papers focused on ML techniques for precision N management. A number of spectrometric
    studies have been undertaken devoted to the estimation of the N status in plants
    using CR, vegetation indices (VIs) (Li et al., 2010, Maresma et al., 2016, Ruß
    and Kruse, 2011), SMLR and PLSR (Grossman et al., 1996, Haboudane et al., 2008,
    Hansen and Schjoerring, 2003, Huang et al., 2004, Tian et al., 2011, Yu et al.,
    2013, Zhu et al., 2006). Yao et al. (2015) applied different linear (CR, VI, SMLR
    and PLSR) and nonlinear (ANN and SVM) regression methods in order to determine
    which method, input variable and model could estimate the Leaf Nitrogen Concentration
    (LNC) in winter wheat with higher accuracy, more robustness, less time and lower
    complexity. A comparative assessment of those six methods was conducted using
    the following six metrics: coefficients of determination for the calibration (
    ) and validation ( ) sets, the root mean square errors of prediction (RMSEP) for
    the calibration and validation sets, the ratio of prediction to deviation (RPD),
    the computational efficiency (CE) and the complexity level (CL). The results of
    the comparison showed that the SVM method was more robust in coping with potential
    confounding factors for most varieties, ecological site and growth stage. However,
    the VI method utilising the Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (1200 and 705 bands)
    was most accurate for the estimation of the LNC in wheat. Gaussian Processes (GPs)
    machine learning regression algorithms have been applied to estimate chlorophyll
    content, N content, leaf water content and specific leaf area from a field-based
    multi-species dataset (for trees) (Wittenberghe et al., 2014). As an input the
    GP used the entire spectral data and then several distinct wavebands were automatically
    chosen for estimation of different leaf parameters. Results illustrate that the
    information to predict a leaf parameter is not restricted to one or few spectral
    bands, but that six or more separate bands can be (equally) involved. Taking more
    bands into account helps better discriminate the source of change when some bands
    are also influenced by other variables. Three methods (PLS, ANN, LS-SVM) have
    been used to estimate the N status non-destructively in rice using canopy spectral
    reflectance with visible and near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (Shao et al.,
    2012). The comparative analysis showed that the LS-SVM outperformed the other
    methods and it was concluded that LS-SVM is a promising alternative for the regression
    analysis to quantify N status in rice. The Random Forest (RF) algorithm is a data
    mining method developed by Breiman (2001). It can be employed to reduce the redundancy
    in complex high-dimensional hyperspectral datasets. The results by Elfatih et
    al. (2013) show that RF regression applied to hyperspectral data has the potential
    to accurately predict sugarcane leaf N concentration thus assisting in making
    informed decisions regarding site-specific application of N fertilizers. There
    are many other studies dedicated to precision N management using not only ML but
    also other techniques such as kriging, multivariate methods and inverse distance
    weighting. Table 2. presents those studies and provides a summary, methodology
    and discussion for each publication. This discussion is concentrated on some key
    technical aspects of the used ML and other techniques. Table 2. Publications that
    use machine learning and other techniques for precision nitrogen management. Paper
    Summary Methodology Discussion Song et al. (2017) The paper showed that based
    on the data collected from some georeferenced locations the Ordinary Kriging Analysis
    allows the interpolation of maps for • wheat grain protein content (GPC) • GPC
    yield • wheat canopy fluorescence parameters, including Simple Florescence Ratio
    and Nitrogen Balance Indices (NBI) • soil Nitrate-Nitrogen (NO3-N) content and
    soil Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) The comparison of the fluorescence parameter
    maps, soil NO3-N and soil TDR maps with the wheat GPC and the GPC yield maps demonstrated
    that the NBI spatial variability map in the late stage of wheat growth can be
    used to distinguish areas that produce higher GPC Ordinary Kriging Analysis (OKA)
    Ordinary Kriging Analysis is a widely used approach in PA. However, ML via Gaussian
    Processes based modelling will provide • automation • quick update of the models
    as new data becomes available • optimised data collection (based on maximising
    the information gain) • probabilistic outcomes with representative uncertainties
    • possibility for further fusion of data from different sensors  Magney et al.
    (2017) The paper aimed • to evaluate the usefulness of RapidEye spectral VIs to
    predict cumulative N uptake in wheat • to examine the usefulness of remotely sensed
    N uptake maps for PA applications It was concluded that • the top performing VI
    was the Normalized Difference Red-Edge index (NDRE) • N uptake maps from RapidEye
    imagery could have important implications for PA Seventeen commonly used spectral
    VIs Although VIs have been used for a number of different applications in satellite
    remote sensing for PA, this paper reports that VIs from RapidEye imagery can be
    used for estimating wheat N uptake.  Morellos et al. (2016) To predict total nitrogen
    (TN), organic carbon (OC) and moisture content (MC) in fresh (wet and unprocessed)
    soil samples two multivariate and two machine learning methods have been compared.
    The results indicated that machine learning methods outperformed the multivariate
    methods for the prediction of all three soil properties. Multivariate methods:
    • Principal Component Regression (PCR) • Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR),
    Machine learning methods: • Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LS-SVM) • Cubist
    The advantage of ML methods is that they are capable of tackling non-linear problems
    in the dataset. The ML techniques can be used in field spectroscopy for off-line
    and online prediction of the soil parameters studied in the fields (if the soil
    type and variability is similar to the one studied in this paper)  Castaldi et
    al. (2016) The paper proposed data fusion process in order to improve the choice
    of satellite bands for grain N uptake prediction. The results showed that the
    best spectral regions vary over the growing season of the wheat crop. Combination
    of • Stepwise Regression with Backward Selection • Stepwise Variance Inflation
    Factors (VIFs) analysis • Linear Mixed Effect Model (LMEM) LMEM can be a very
    efficient technique to estimate the spatial variability of the soil and crop variables
    accurately across the field with limited data, thus saving time and reducing the
    costs.  Wang et al. (2017) The paper investigated the modelling performances of
    four different chemometric techniques and three vegetation indices. Results showed
    that the best modelling and prediction accuracy were found in the model established
    by PLSR and spectra measured with a black background. A higher coefficient of
    determination between the leaf N concentration and fruit yield was found at 50 days
    after full bloom. Four techniques: • Principal Components Regression (PCR) • Partial
    Least Squares Regression (PLSR) • Stepwise Multiple Linear Regression (SMLR) •
    BPNN Three indices: • Difference Spectral Index • Normalized Difference Spectral
    Index • Ratio Spectral Index PCR, PLSR, and BPNN use all available wavelengths
    simultaneously, while SMLR selects useful wavelengths from the available spectrum
    and ignores the remaining wavebands. To improve the performance of the methods
    normalization can be used on the raw spectra collected by the probe, and wavelengths
    with very large atmospheric influence can be removed.  Guo et al. (2015) The paper
    compared two different approaches (SLR and RFRK) to predict and map the spatial
    distribution of soil organic matter for the rubber plantation. Results showed
    that RFRK outperforms SLR, by providing lower prediction errors (ME, MAE, and
    RMSE) and higher R2 • Stepwise Linear Regression (SLR) • RFRK • Generalized Additive
    Mixed Model (GAMM) • Classification And Regression Tree (CART) RFRK model required
    no assumptions about the relationships between the target variable and the predictor
    variables. Those relationships could be nonlinear and hierarchical. This can be
    revealed by using GAMM and CART.  Dai et al. (2014) The paper presented ANN-kriging
    methodology in order to predict accurate Soil Organic Matter (SOM) content maps.
    A comparison of proposed method with the other interpolation methods was performed
    to assess the prediction accuracy. The results indicated that ANN-kriging provides
    the lower RMSE. • ANN-kriging • ANN • Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) It is suggested
    that the proposed ANN-kriging methodology can be used to improve the accuracy
    of SOM content mapping at large scale. 5. Conclusions Sensing technologies and
    ML techniques have rapidly advanced during the last decade. These developments
    are likely to continue providing cost-effective and more comprehensive datasets
    combined with more sophisticated algorithmic solutions enabling better crop and
    environment state estimation and decision making. We are at the beginning of a
    promising path that has the potential to significantly alter crop yield management.
    A number of ML techniques have already been successfully applied to different
    PA tasks. This review particularly demonstrates that (a) Back-propagation Neural
    Networks allow identification of the importance of different Vegetation Indices
    (VI) for more accurate crop yield estimation. (b) The combination of Convolutional
    Neural Networks or Long-short Term Memory with Gaussian Processes enables feature
    extraction from the data and efficient reduction of the error maps. (c) Gaussian
    Processes are useful for automatic selection of wavebands from the entire spectrum
    in order to predict different characteristics of plant leaves. (d) M5-Prime Regression
    Trees are a suitable tool for multi-class crop prediction. (e) Least Squares Support
    Vector Machine is a promising tool for regression analysis to quantify Nitrogen
    status. (f) Fuzzy cognitive Map (FCM) can be used to model and represent expert
    knowledge for yield prediction and crop management. Based on the current dynamics
    in algorithmic developments and sensor technologies the following future trends
    can be expected: (a) More optimised, targeted application of the currently available
    sensors and established ML techniques to specific PA tasks (b) Interconnected
    treatment of spatial, spectral and temporal domains and incorporation of expert
    knowledge into the ML techniques aimed at modelling and decision making in different
    aspects of PA. (c) The combination of multiple ML as well as signal processing
    techniques into hybrid systems to benefit from the strengths of those techniques
    and compensate for their individual shortcomings. (d) Spatial and spectral fusion
    of information from sensors with different spatial resolution and spectral characteristics.
    (e) The dynamic combination of stationary (e.g. in-ground probes, weather station)
    and mobile (e.g. ground and aerial vehicles, satellites) equipment to enable active
    optimal data collection, information fusion and model update for high value areas.

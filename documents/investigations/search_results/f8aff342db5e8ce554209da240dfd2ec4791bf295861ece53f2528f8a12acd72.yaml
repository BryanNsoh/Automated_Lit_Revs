    Figure 1- Iot inagriculture and its aspects Show All The role of Technology in
    agriculture sector is becoming more and more visible. There is a development in
    various methodologies used in the agricultural system in this paper we are showcasing
    the current developments and the future scope in agricultural Technologies through
    IoT and automation A large-scale agricultural system requires a lot of maintenance,
    knowledge, and supervision. In the given model we are aiming to automate the following
    garden processes. A. Internet of Things, Automation and Agriculture IoT and automation
    intertwine to build some of the most efficient and cost-effective solutions to
    human problems. According to Gartner IoT sector alone Is expected to be worth
    around 457 billion dollars in 2020 [9]. IoT technology and automation is efficient
    due to the given reasons. Connectivity to a diverse range of devices - From Android
    and iOS-based mobile, tablet and TV devices to standalone devices IoT can be connected
    to almost anything that can be connected and interfaced from the internet. Minimizing
    human labor - Automation can help the minimization of human resource and human
    error. Quick Access - Crop and soil health can be remotely monitored through any
    device and at any region. Time Efficient - Automatic report generation and remote
    monitoring can save time and effort from farmers. Efficient Communication - Using
    Android and iOS app platform a community of farmers, students and enthusiasts
    can share their work and new methodologies for agricultural growth. Analytics
    - Wide range of analysis can be done including avg. rainfall, soil health gradient.
    SECTION II. Current Implementations Substantial advancements in the domain of
    agriculture automation has been surveyed. In Survey of Drones for Agriculture
    Automation from Planting to Harvest [10] one can observe the use of Robotic Process
    Automation (RPA), image processing, pattern recognition and machine learning in
    order to achieve automation in case of large scale farm lands the paper also discusses
    about Precision Agriculture providing high quality crops. In Advances in greenhouse
    automation and controlled environment agriculture: A transition to plant factories
    and urban agriculture [11] one can understand how a combination of environmental
    conditions interplay in optimal growth of plants in different setups. Above papers
    share a common limitation. Implementation(s) shared are not lack reliance and
    are less aware. for example in case of error at any node of the workflow cannot
    be detected or rectified. SECTION III. Advancements In this paper we are willing
    to automate the rectification process of any error occuring at any node of the
    existing automation system by extending the workflow which helps standalone systems
    to thrive without any human intervention. we have also implemented workflows that
    tend to increase the level of automation in the system. SECTION IV. Requirements
    B. Electronic Components Arduino UNO - The Arduino UNO is an open-source microcontroller
    board based on the Microchip ATmega328P microcontroller and developed by Arduino.cc.
    The board is equipped with sets of digital and analog input/output pins that may
    be interfaced to various expansion boards and other circuits. The board will be
    used for primary interfacing of the devices. Figure 2- Arduino circuit Show All
    16×2 Liquid Crystal Display - Will be used to visualize the data locally it will
    help to operate the device standalone Figure 3- 2×16 liquid crystal display Show
    All pH Sensor - The sensor will get readings from the soil and will track the
    health of the soil. pH readings can help us find the efficiency or deficiency
    of pesticide or fertilizers. Figure 4- PH sensor Show All DHT11 - Temperature
    and Humidity Sensor Temperature and humidity can immensely affect the growth of
    plants the given sensor keeps a track of the temperature and humidity in the crop
    field a separate mechanism can be developed to regulate the temperature in case
    the farming is done in the closed environment. Figure 5- DHT11 sensor Show All
    Soil moisture sensor - This can be used to monitor the moisture level in the crop.
    It is based on Ohm''s law and uses resistance between the poles in order to calculate
    the moisture of the soil. Figure 6 Soil moisture sensor Show All GSM module is
    used for connecting the device to another GSM device enabling IoT connectivity
    and remote monitoring - This module will send data to the registered set of devices
    and cloud for analytics. Figure 7- GSM module Show All SECTION V. Schematic Figure
    8- Schematic Show All SECTION VI. Working of Device The schematic in figure 8
    represents the irrigation automation system. In this system, MOISTURE_OUT ports
    in soil moisture sensor are used to measure the soil moisture by calculating the
    potential difference between soil. the output from the soil moisture sensor is
    connected to the microcontroller. If the potential difference is less than the
    threshold value microcontroller is connects to the pump via a relay which can
    be used to irrigate the soil. C. Output Figure 9- Moisture values from soil Show
    All Figure 9 depicts the output readings received from the soil moisture sensor
    the given readings can be calibrated and mapped with different plants/crops during
    programming of a given standalone module. These readings can be used further as
    a threshold value in the workflow. The threshold value varies according to the
    specimen used. Figure 10 depicts workflows associated with the water management
    system. The system first checks the moisture of the soil. If the moisture is less
    than the threshold value then the irrigation system is checked. If the irrigation
    system is not working then the farmer and the service team is informed about the
    issue and necessary actions are taken to fix a system. If the irrigation system
    is working normally then the water level at the reservoir is checked. Is the water
    level is low then the farmer and servicing are informed about the situation and
    water in the tank is leveled. If the water level is sufficient then crops are
    irrigated. Figure 10- Flowchart for irrigation automation Show All The workflow
    in figure 11 represents automation of soil care and fertilizer deficiency detection.
    The process runs into stages the first stage checks if there is an efficiency
    of deficiency of any given fertilizer the second stage checks which fertilizer,
    explicitly, is causing that issue. There are two types of sensors incorporated
    to perform this workflow. The first set of sensors monitor the pH value of the
    soil along with sensors for nutrients check which monitor the composition of the
    soil. The second set of sensors monitor the deficiency/excessiveness of a given
    fertilizer. Before the pump is started the water level at the reserve is checked.
    If the water level is less than the threshold value then the irrigation operation
    is aborted. Farmer and service team is notified. Once the reserve is refilled
    then workflow proceeds further. The device runs several workflows in order to
    perform various tasks that are associated with the feature which leads to the
    complete automation of the feature this reducing human intervention. Such workflows
    can be used to automate the requirement of the crops. Figure 11- Flow-chart for
    soil care and fertilizer deficiency/efficiency detection Show All SECTION VII.
    Conclusion Agriculture had played a major role in India''s economic growth since
    then and continued to be there in the future. The farmers, on the other hand,
    are facing challenges in different phases of agriculture. The given paper tries
    to resolve problem using IoT and automation which can manage most of the agricultural
    work and the farmers can strategize which crops to grow according to the market
    rather than spending most of the time in crop maintenance and production it can
    also help farmers give more time to their personal life hence increasing the average
    social standard of the society. SECTION VIII. Future Scope Agriculture automation
    can be amalgamated with future agriculture systems such as hydroponics [6], aeroponics
    [8] or aquaponics [7]. we can plan to build an autonomous agriculture system in
    future which will not require any human intervention and the crops can be sown
    cultivated and harvested without human intervention. Also, the crops grown using
    this mechanism will grow much faster and will be organic. One can imagine a huge
    building with vertical farms operating autonomously, growing crops and supplying
    oxygen to the entire city. Analytics can help identify which crops to grow according
    to the demand. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like

    all metrics Abstract Presently, wireless sensor network (WSN) plays important
    role in engineering, science, agriculture and many other field like surveillance,
    military applications, smart cars etc. Precision agriculture (PA) is one of the
    field in which WSN is widely adopted. The aim of the adoption of WSNs in PA is
    to measure the different environmental parameters such as humidity, temperature,
    soil moisture, PH value of soil etc., for enhancing the quantity and quality of
    crops. Further, the WSNs are also helped to reduce the consumptions of the natural
    resources used in farming. Hence, the aim of this review is to identify the various
    WSNs technologies adopted for precision agriculture and impact of these technologies
    to achieve smart agriculture. This review also focuses on the different environmental
    parameters like irrigation, monitoring, soil properties, temperature for achieving
    precision agriculture. Further, a detailed study is also carried out on different
    crops which are covered using WSNs technologies. This review also highlights on
    the different communication technologies and sensors available for PA. To analyze
    the impact of the WSNs in agriculture field, several research questions are designed
    and through this review, we are tried to find the solutions of these research
    questions. Similar content being viewed by others Wireless Sensor Network in Agriculture:

    Chapter © 2022 1 Introduction Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are the networks
    which are composed of sensor nodes. These sensor nodes help in sensing, gathering
    and measuring the information from the surroundings where they are deployed and
    transmit the data to the users. A WSN has small or we can say no infrastructure
    and having number of sensor nodes in it from ten to thousands which works together
    to monitor a area where they are deployed.WSN are classified into two categories
    structured and unstructured. Structured WSN are those which are deploy in proper
    manner into a specific area and can be easily configured if there is any problem
    in a senor nodes whereas unstructured WSN are those in which sensors nodes are
    deploy in bulk without any proper architecture these type of WSN are mainly found
    in those area where it is difficult for humans to reach easily and obtain data
    from that area. In unstructured WSN, it is difficult to take care of sensor nodes
    if they stop working or issue of node failure occurs. Wireless sensor network
    are classified into five types to monitor the parameters of surface of earth,
    underground conditions, underwater conditions, multimedia and to monitor the area
    by the help of movement of sensors. These five types of sensors are defined as
    Terrestrial WSN-In this type of WSNs, huge number of nodes are deploy into a surface
    of land that can help to examine the conditions of land. Underground WSN- As the
    name depict underground WSN are networks of sensor nodes which are deployed in
    caves, mines or underground surface for monitoring the condition of soil, moisture
    and military boarder monitoring. Underwater WSN- In this WSNs, sensors are deployed
    in the region of oceans, rivers for underwater surveillance. Multi-media WSN-It
    is a network consists of sensors nodes that have ability to store, process and
    access multi-media data such as video data, audio files and pictures. Mobile WSN-
    In this network, sensor nodes have the ability to move from one place to other.
    The application of such networks is military surveillance, monitoring of area,
    tracking of target, monitoring under water [1]. In WSNs, sensors are integrated
    with a radio transceiver and a set of electronics components which helps in transmission
    of data from source to destination. Sensor nodes have capability to organize themselves
    to create ad hoc, multi-hop network which helps in creating communication link
    between nodes. User can give commands to sensors; as a response of these commands
    sensors can transmit data to the user for example a particular limit of temperature
    is assign to the sensor with the help of embedded language if temperature exceeds
    from that assigned value than sensor provides information to the user [2]. 1.1
    Wireless Sensor Network in Precision Agriculture Precision agriculture is a crop
    management concept which allows farmers for managing spatial and temporal variability
    with in the agricultural field such as reduction of natural resources, irrigation
    management, production management, fertilizer management, intrusion attacks, and
    real time data monitoring [3]. The aim behind the adoption of sensors in precision
    agriculture is to enhance the overall production of crops. Sensors can help for
    measuring various parameters of agriculture land like humidity, soil moisture,
    climatic condition, intrusion detection, water level which facilitate that can
    lead to better production [4]. Further, sensor can collect the information regarding
    various parameters and process the collected information for better farming. The
    significant role of sensors in agricultural field is listed below (Fig. 1). Fig.

    Full size image 1.2.4 Citation Criteria For this review, the articles published
    in SCI listed journals are considered. To collect the good literature review,
    several search strings are designed which are mentioned in Sect. 2.3. But these
    search strings are not capable to distinguish articles published in SCI listed
    journals and non SCI listed journals. So, the separation between SCI and non SCI
    listed journals are done manually and all the articles published in non SCI listed
    journals and conferences are not included. The search strings also find number
    of articles based on wireless sensor networks, but these articles are not related
    to precision agriculture. These articles include new routing mechanisms, energy
    efficiency in WSNs, topology setup, enhanced WSNs protocols, latency etc. Such
    types of articles are discarded. The articles considered for this review are published
    in SCI listed journals. Table 1 shows the list of journals as well as number of
    articles taken from the individual journal. Table 1 Illustartes the categorization
    of articles with journals Full size table 2 Literature Survey This section of
    paper describes the literature survey of various research articles related to
    precision agriculture using wireless sensor network. This section includes various
    techniques, sensors, algorithms and sensor motes used for collecting information
    from agricultural fields. The literature survey on the usability of sensor nodes
    in PA is divided into three categories. These categories are (1) Monitoring of
    Crops (2) Irrigation Management of Crops (3) Environmental parameters for Crops
    2.1 Monitoring This subsection describes the works reported on monitoring of the
    crops. Sanchez et al. [6] proposed an integrated wireless sensor network as a
    solution for precision agriculture. This model can help to assimilate crop data
    acquisition, transmission of data from the end user and video-supervision task.
    The main objective this model is to secure the crops from intruders and identification
    of same in the agriculture field. The detection and identification of intruders
    are done with help of video surveillance. High consumption of energy and end to
    end delay problems are remain unsolved. The different hardware prototypes have
    been implemented for crop monitoring devices. The detection intruder is measured
    using infrared motion sensors and identification is consummated with the help
    of camera sensors. Zhang et al. [7] proposed a method to monitor vigor of the
    plant with the help of WSNs. In this work, the vigor of the plant is non-violently
    monitored through embedded and image processing technology. If unusual behaviour
    of a plant is identified during monitoring process, then warning message is sent
    to end users. With the help of wireless sensor nodes deployed in the field’s wastage
    of resources which are needed for cultivation of plant are minimised. Proposed
    method based on data fusion of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation helps in providing
    the well-organized way for monitoring the strength of plant in many phases of
    agriculture. Zou et al. [8] proposed an algorithm named as OASNDFA for achieving
    intelligent agricultural monitoring with minimum sensor nodes deploy in the field.
    The selection of location of nodes is difficult in hilly areas due graphical and
    weather conditions. This algorithm helps to find the suitable location of nodes.
    This algorithm works in three phases. The first phase considers the different
    relevant factor. In second phase, a mathematical model is designed with the help
    of relevant factors. The third phase consists of key points with maximum features.
    These features are computed through mathematical model. To address the vulnerable
    dynamic topology problem for monitoring the crops, Jiang et al. [9] proposed an
    algorithm based on tree topology, called dynamic converge cast tree algorithm
    (DCTA). This algorithm is employed within the monitoring system of WSN. The aim
    of the proposed algorithm is to obtain better data attainment for monitoring of
    growth of plant. The DCTA algorithm having three stages i.e. (a) routing which
    is based on dynamic routing (b) adaptable time slot scheduling (c) compilation
    and examination of data. This algorithm provides high data transmission between
    nodes. For real time monitoring of the agriculture filed, Kim et al. [10] proposed
    an WSNs architecture based on beacon mode with autonomous. This architecture provides
    the solutions for the problems like fire, intrusion attack, and lack of availability
    of resources. The proposed architecture is worked on the TinyOS platform and further,
    multiple beacon scheduling in the MAC layer with bop slots is considered. The
    dynamic address allocations and path recovery process for unexpected link is addressed
    on the network layer. The results staed that the proposed architecture having
    reliable transmission ratio for a real-time processing service like fire and emergency
    agriculture monitoring systems under heavy traffic environments. Intrusion attacks
    are one of the major issues faced by farmers. Because, intruders destroy the agriculture
    fields and leads to decrease in productivity. To address the same, Bapat et al.
    [11] proposed a wireless sensor network to protect farms from animal attacks.
    Sensor nodes equipped with PIR sensors, sound sensors, light flashers and RF module
    are deployed in agriculture field. Sensor nodes that are located near to boundaries
    of field detect animal entry and send information to the central base station.
    From the central base station, the information is sent to end users. To monitor
    the variability of nitrogen gas and biomass foe sugarcane crop, Portz et al. [12]
    proposed active crop sensor model based on WSNs. The results revealed that the
    proposed model is capable to indicate demand of nitrogen and biomass in sugarcane
    fields. The nitrogen sensor helps to detect the variability of biomass and nitrogen
    and preventing action can be taken for supplying the biomass and nitrogen into
    sugarcane crop. Reiser et al. [13] proposed WSNs based system for autonomous navigation
    of agriculture field. The proposed system comprises of location of nodes deployed
    in agriculture field and data attainment. The proposed system has advantages over
    the narrow transmission range of nodes. This system is effectively detected the
    faulty nodes. Smiljkovikj et al. [14] proposed an intelligent cloud based system
    named as Smartwine which monitors the wine production process using grapes. It
    works on sensor network platform having centralized server system which allows
    more than one users to use system simultaneously. The Smartwine system helps in
    decrease the cost of energy, water, resources and pesticides use for wine production.
    To monitor the agricultural production process, Diaz et al. [15] proposed a methodology
    which have seven phases that are (1) Study the condition of environment. (2) Design
    of sensor network architecture. (3) Role and Importance. (4) Implementation. (5)
    Simulation (6) Deployment. (7) Maintenance. The designed methodology represents
    the importance of wireless sensor in agricultural field and provides strong foundation
    for building applications with high productivity gain. To monitor the crops in
    green house and orchard, Zhu et al. [16] developed a monitoring system based on
    WSNs. The capabilities of the proposed system are evaluated using three different
    scenarios such as greenhouse, open farmland and orchard. The proposed system gives
    better reliable communication between sensors nodes deployed in agriculture fields.
    Further, it is also seen that rate of packet loss is significantly decreased.
    To attaining less management cost and high productivity in cultivation of crops,
    Srbinovska et al. [17] proposed WSNs based architecture for vegetable greenhouse.
    The developed system analyzes the various environmental parameters like temperature,
    humidity and light, for optimal conditions of crops. It is revealed that the proposed
    system would be able to improve the productivity and quality of crop. A review
    on infrastructure of WSNs for precision agriculture is presented in [18]. Further,
    in this work, a hybrid WSN model based on terrestrial WSNs and underground sensor
    network for precision agriculture is proposed. The objective of the proposed model
    is to reduce the human efforts for collecting agricultural information. It is
    seen that the proposed model provides information regarding agriculture fields
    more efficiently and accurately than existing sensor networks. To address approximate
    inference problem in agriculture field, Abouzar et al. proposed RSSI (received
    signal strength indicator) based-distributed Bayesian localization algorithm for
    message passing [19]. The proposed algorithm avoids communication overhead and
    minimizes computational complexity. El-kader et al. [20] proposed a precision
    farming solution model for potato crop [20]. In the proposed model, soil testing
    of land is done through sensor nodes whether the land is suitable for cultivation
    or not. This model also provides the facilities of better irrigation and fertilization
    scheduling to reduce natural resources. Further, it is noticed that APTEEN protocol
    is adopted for better routing paths. To monitor the parameters of soil, Georgieva
    et al. [21] designed a WSNs based monitoring model. The proposed monitoring model
    computes the different parameters of soil like temperature, humidity, conductivity
    and amount of acid. The arduino platform is used to integrate the different components
    of the proposed monitoring model. For providing better and qualitative connectivity
    and coverage of sensors in agriculture field, Kaiwartya et al. [22] designed a
    system for multi-metric quality measurement for deployed sensor nodes. In this
    work, seven metrics are designed for the sensor deployment and the optimal connectivity
    between the sensor nodes is measured. Lam et al. [23] developed a wireless sensor
    module for rural monitoring and precision agriculture applications. In their work,
    specification like received signal strength indicator (RSSI), packet reception
    ratio (PRR) of wireless sensor module was tested as compared with commercial products.
    The designed modules have capability to give optimal solution for real-world applications.
    Further, it can provide better applications for precision agriculture like reduce
    energy consumption of nodes, prediction of pest or disease and improved quality
    of crops. For better coverage of agriculture field, An et al. [24] proposed an
    effective technique for sensor deployment based on field information coverage.
    In this work, two polynomial-time algorithms are presented. The work of the first
    algorithm is to find the location of deployed sensors. Whereas, second is to identify
    the locations of relay nodes with minimum number of relay nodes in between source
    to destination. It is seen that the good trade-off between sensor nodes is obtained.
    To fruit recognition and disease detection, Lee et al. [25] designed a sensing
    system integrated with yield mapping system, sensors for detecting disease, devris
    detectors, an N detector for precision agriculture using ground and aerial based
    platforms. The proposed sensing system can measure the soil phosphorus detection,
    detection of nutrient in soil and grain insect detection with the help of NIR
    and RAMAN spectroscopy. To monitor the frost in vineyard, Valente et al. [26]
    proposed a collaborative system based on WSNs and robot. The aerial robot can
    be worked as dynamic node and it can be responsible for communication between
    agriculture field and base station. Further, in this work, UAV and WSN are combined
    for surveying fragmented crop fields. Zhang et al. [27] designed a remote monitoring
    system based on WSNs for collecting agricultural information. This monitoring
    system is based on ZigBee and GPRS wireless communication technologies. The agriculture
    data is collected through CC2430. The ARM9 processors are adopted to design base
    station. The proposed system is more feasible than other existing systems in terms
    of feasibility and it also conserve water content in agriculture field efficiently.
    Li et al. [28] proposed a monitoring system based on WSNs for greenhouse. The
    proposed system includes cluster of sensor nodes, base station and data centre.
    The JN5139 micro-processor is used for designing wireless nodes and further, ZigBee
    protocol is used for communication purpose. The proposed monitoring system is
    a low-cost, expandable and reliable model with better processing capability. Park
    el al. [29] designed an environmental monitoring system to prevent dew condensation
    in greenhouse. The proposed environmental system integrates the Bahrenburg formula
    to compute the dew point of leaves. Further, the dew condensation is prevented
    on the surface of crops which to prevent diseases infection. To monitors the environmental
    parameters, Carrascosa et al. [30] proposed an open source based hardware model
    for precision agriculture. The proposed model contains two main components i.e.
    hardware and software. The hardware component of the model is responsible to record
    environmental parameters, whereas, software component connect the device with
    data server. The characteristics of open source hardware model are low acquisition
    cost and less complexity for customization. Table 2 summarizes the work reported
    on monitoring of different crops. Table 2 Depicts the work reported on crop monitoring
    Full size table 2.2 Irrigation Management This subsection presents the literature
    works on irrigation management for the crops. To optimize the water content in
    agriculture field, Gutierrez et al. [31] proposed an automated irrigation system
    based on WSNs. The proposed irrigation system comprises of distributed wireless
    network of soil-moisture and temperature sensors. It is seen that the proposed
    system is feasible, cost effective and also reduce the amount of water content
    needed to the crops. To address the drought and tolerance issues of crops, Levy
    et al. [32] developed a method for irrigation management and enhancement of tolerance
    for the crops. It is observed that lack of water, drought, heat and salinity can
    affect the production of the crop. With the help of proposed method, all these
    factors are analyzed and it is concluded that required amount of the water is
    supplied through the proposed system to the crops. Further, it is noticed that
    micro-irrigation and drip irrigation systems helps farmer to conserve water. To
    measure the soil variability, Hedle et al. [33] adopted spatio-temporal modelling
    with high spatial resolution electromagnetic and digital elevation method data
    layers for quantify the variability of soil. Wireless sensor network with high
    temporal resolution dataset is used to mould the vibrant nature of soil moisture.
    The proposed approach is more accurate than a multiple linear regression modelling
    because it helps in providing best implementation of a variable rate irrigation
    system. For efficient use of irrigation system, Hellin et al. [34] developed an
    irrigation architecture based on WSNs for agriculture field. The proposed architecture
    helps in describing the design, optimization and development of an application
    to reduce the wastage of water. Sensor nodes which were deploy in fields are of
    good use they helps in reaching the required moisture condition to maintain water
    electrical conductivity level of the irrigation system at desired value through
    which there is a efficient management of water resources in agriculture field.
    To optimize agricultural irrigation, Nolz et al. [35] developed an irrigation
    model for monitoring the status of water in soil. In this work, two types of sensors
    are applied for measuring the potential of water in soil. These sensors are deployed
    under thin layer of soil to evaluate the status of water. It is noticed that the
    proposed irrigation model reduce the necessity of water to the crops effectively.
    A decision support system is developed for effective irrigation management in
    [36]. The proposed system comprises of sensor nodes, actuation network and fuzzy
    logic. The proposed method can reduce the wastage of water using fuzzy logic and
    actuation network. Further, it is observed that productivity of crop can be increased
    using this decision support system. Kim et al. [37] proposed an efficient water
    management system based on WSNs. In this work, the conventional irrigation system
    is replaced through an electronically controllable system for better irrigation
    management in agricultural fields. The proposed water management system is continuously
    monitored using GPS. Zhao et al. [38] designed an irrigation system based on soil
    water content and temporal stability. Further, in this work, water content and
    temporal stability is compared using VRI and URI to identify the location for
    deploying soil water sensors. In this work, temporal stability of soil moisture
    is evaluated regularly. It is seen that proposed irrigation system changes the
    overall similarity of soil moisture spatial patterns. It is also noticed that
    consumption of water is significantly reduced. To investigate the efficiency of
    linear move installed irrigation system, Chavez et al. [39] proposed a method
    for remote irrigation monitoring and control system (RIMCS). The proposed RIMCS
    system contains the pulsing nozzles and solenoids. The proposed system is also
    capable to vary the water rate. It is claimed that the proposed systems can monitor
    the flow of water, pressure of water, location and agriculture field. To control
    the irrigation in agriculture field, Maurya et al. [40] proposed a novel approach
    based on sensor technology. The sensor nodes are continuously sense soil temperature,
    moisture and humidity in agricultural field and transmits this information to
    base station. Further, in this work, region-based static clustering approach is
    used to provide efficient coverage over entire agricultural field. The proposed
    clustering approach uses the fuzzy logic technique to select best cluster head.
    This energy-efficient protocol is also compared with existing protocol like EEHC,
    DEEC, DDEEC and RBHR. To precisely monitor environmental conditions Sawant et
    al. [41] proposed a system. The proposed system helps in addresses the issues
    like standardized way of data discovery, access and sharing of data across various
    distributed sensor networks through the adaptation of a framework based on OGC
    standards for sensor SWE. The proposed system is a cost-effective, standardized
    sensing system which includes functionalities like sensor plug-n-play, remote
    monitoring, tools for crop water req. Estimation and nutrient management. A WSNs
    based irrigation software system is presented in [42]. The proposed system is
    named as WISC. The designed system provides real time monitoring of fields and
    remotes access to in-field information through WSN for irrigation purpose. For
    the proper irrigation in agriculture field, Coates et al. [43] proposed an irrigation
    model based on WSNs with valve control. The proposed model can sense the agriculture
    field for irrigation as well as also control the flow of water. Hence, in this
    work, manual control of irrigation valves is replaced through automatic control.
    To automate the irrigation process, Nikolidakis et al. [44] proposed an algorithm
    with collaboration of integrated system. This algorithm consists of advanced routing
    scheme i.e., ECHERP and provides efficient utilization of energy required for
    sensor motes. Nagarajan et al. [45] designed a sensor mote for sprinkler irrigation
    automation system. In the proposed work, humidity, temperature and PH sensors
    are used to control the water content of the agriculture field. The ZigBee communication
    technology is used for data transformation. Further, the GPRS system is adopted
    for data analyses and storing purpose. The proposed system is capable to perform
    real time monitoring and control water supply. An adaptable decision support system
    is proposed by Goumopoulos et al. [46]. The proposed system integrates sensors
    for monitoring soil, crop and climate in agriculture field. Further, this system
    is implemented in autonomous closed loop zone specific irrigation. This system
    is more effective in terms of agronomic performance as compared to traditional
    agricultural practices. Kim et al. [47] proposed a novel water monitoring system
    for reducing depletion of water resources. It is reported that fine-grained consumption
    of water resources can help farmers to pinpoint waste, and improve efficiency.
    The proposed water monitoring system can conserve the natural resources and also
    to reduce the amount of water needed by a crop. Masseroni et al. [48] designed
    a system for soil water monitoring and irrigation management. The proposed system
    is implemented using Arduino based open-hardware device. This system continuously
    measures the water level in the soil, especially in the root area. Further, this
    information is used to decide the irrigation timings. The proposed system reduces
    the water consumption significantly. An IOT based smart irrigation idea is presented
    in [49]. This irrigation system comprises of environmental sensors, web services
    and IOT devices. The proposal has deployed sampling algorithm successfully which
    will provide constraints for the sensor network. A model driven control strategy
    for irrigation in agriculture field is presented [50]. The aim of the proposed
    strategy is to provide right amount of water at right place in an agriculture
    field. Further, a predictive algorithm is incorporated in the proposed strategy
    for measuring the moisture content in soil. Table 3 presents the work reported
    in literature on different irrigation management system for precision agriculture.
    Table 3 Illustrates the work reported on irrigation system for achieving precision
    agriculture Full size table 2.3 Environmental Parameters This subsection describes
    the recent study reported on various environmental parameters like humidity, temperature,
    soil condition etc., to achieve precision agriculture. Rossel et al. [51] developed
    a soil sensing technique based on characterization of soil and environmental conditions.
    The objective of this technique is to improve the production of the crop and further,
    to reduce the environmental effects on crop. This technique measures and monitors
    the soil physical and biochemical attributes for better productivity. To compute
    and plot the spatial variability of soil, Bernardi et al. [52] developed a decision
    tool based on soil properties, yield and liming. The aim of this tool is to compute
    the fertilizer need and economic return of an alfalfa pasture. The vesper software
    is adopted to measure the spatial variability of soil and site-specific liming
    and fertilizer needed. Further, the information of fertility of soil is computed
    using spring software. It is revealed that it is an effective tool for mapping
    and evaluating the spatial variability of soil. Kuang et al. [53] developed a
    NIR spectroscopy based calibration model to acquire soil spectra in diffuse reflectance
    mode. This model is adopted to examine the different spiking strategies and spiking
    ratios. The effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated using 425 sample
    of soil. The results stated that the proposed model provides more correct and
    accurate information regarding soil OC, TN and MC. To measure the electrical conductivity
    of soil, Parrilla et al. [54] designed a system using electromagnetic induction
    (EMI) based apparent electrical conductivity technique for olive orchards. In
    this work, both wet and dry soil conditions are taken into consideration. Further,
    it is seen that to check the efficiency of proposed model, forty-eight soil samples
    are tested for soil texture and soil water content. It is stated that in both
    situation (wet and dry soil), proposed model gives the same information. The spatial
    variation of soil phosphorus(p), magnesium(mg), potassium(k) have been investigated
    using geostatistics, conventional statistics and a geographical information system
    in [55]. In this study, total five hundred thirty-seven soil samples are collected
    for this experiment. It is observed that this model provides useful information
    for agronomic and environmental management for crops. To design a low water cost
    WSNs, Bogena et al. [56] have tested the applicability of different water sensors
    like EC-5, EC-20 and TDR for measuring soil water content. The experiment is performed
    both in laboratory and field. It is seen that in laboratory, the performance of
    the water sensors are almost same. But, in field, there is significant difference
    between the performances of the different water sensors. Authors claimed that
    EC-5 water sensor gives better accurate results among all other sensors and it
    is best suitable sensor to design low water cost WSNs. To measure the climate
    change mitigation strategies for ecosystem and agriculture, Knadel et al. [57]
    presented a study on the self organic carbon parameter. In this study, two different
    agriculture fields are taken into consideration and mapped using Veris mobile
    sensor platform. Further, fuzzy clustering is applied to obtain different field
    of spectra. The objective of this study is to identify either a single sensor
    or fusion of sensors can provide best predictive accuracy for SOC parameters.
    It is seen that the fusion of sensors is obtained best predictive accuracy for
    SOC parameter. Further, it is observed that low cost robust calibration model
    can be developed on the basis of Vires mobile platform. A soil property monitoring
    system based on WSNs is presented in [58]. The proposed system is deployed in
    the wheat field to measure the soil properties. It is seen that proposed system
    provides more than 95% real time information of soil parameters. Ritsema et al.
    [59] developed a stand-alone wireless embed network system for continuous monitoring
    of water contents at different depths. Further, this system is associated with
    web application to display the real time results for end users. To monitor the
    soil moisture dynamics from top depth, Majone et al. [60] presented a multi hop
    WSNs based monitoring system for orchards. In this work, sensors are deployed
    on different depth level i.e. 10, 20, 30, 50 and 80 cm. The proposed system is
    based on independent sensors that can provide both real time and historic data.
    It is revealed that distribution of soil moisture can affect the production of
    orchards. To find the low cost sensor and better frequency range for measuring
    moisture content, electrical conductivity and temperature of soil, Kizito et al.
    [61] evaluated ECH2O sensors family in the range of 5–150 MHz frequencies. The
    results concluded that ECH2O-TE sensor gives the better results at 70 MHz. The
    relationship and precision between volumetric soil water content and volumetric
    soil water content sensed are determined through four commercial soil moisture
    sensor systems in [62]. It is revealed that only the IM and RB systems are identified
    the high corelation between volumetric soil water content and volumetric soil
    water content sensed. Brocca et al. [63] assessed the reliability of soil moisture
    estimations through ASCAT and AMSR-E sensors. In their work, fourteen different
    sites of four different countries is taken into consideration. It is stated that
    AMSR-E sensor provides the high correlation between the observed and modelled
    data using LPRM algorithm. A review on the soil properties using remote sensing
    technique is presented in [64]. To characterize the underground wireless network
    and the basic problems for better communication in agricultural field, Vuran et
    al. [65] derived advance channel models. The proposed model helps in analyzing
    bit error rate for two different networks. The results obtain from field measurements
    used in evaluating parameters of soil and the effects of variation in moisture
    of soil. To measure the temperature of agriculture field, Badia-melis et al. [66]
    evaluate the behaviour of various sensors under the three temperature ranges that
    are 5 °C, 23 °C and 35 °C. Three wireless sensor network devices with different
    sensors are compared with four RIFD tags to get the information of behaviour of
    various sensors. Two alternative methods were used to adjust experimental data.
    For monitoring and modelling temperature variations inside silage stacks, Green
    et al. [67] designed a wireless mote which is deployed at different location.
    The proposed system helps in detection of temperature variation during decomposition
    of silage. To obtain real time information about environmental parameters of greenhouse,
    Jahnavi et al. [68] developed a smart wireless system. The designed system helps
    in giving optimal use of resources and water required for cultivation of crops.
    Microcontroller in designed system helps in transmitting and receiving data from
    sensor nodes to gateway node. Users can get real time information of greenhouse
    through web application where data is transmitted through gateway node. To control
    the eexchange of water and energy of heat between the agricultural field and atmosphere,
    Jackson et al. [69] designed a temperature and moisture sensor. The developed
    sensors are composed of micro machined MEMS cantilever beams which are equipped
    with water sensitive sensors. The variation in resistance of the sensor due to
    moisture depends on the cantilever beam thickness. For measuring temperature of
    agricultural field, Martinez et al. [70] proposed a cost-effective system named
    as LITAS. The designed system evaluates infrared thermometry and thermal imaging
    which supervised water stress level of the plant. The LITAS system tested in the
    field of sugar beet and the measurements of LITAS were compared to canopy temperature(TC)
    which is obtain from thermal images. Pierce et al. [71] deployed a two WSNs for
    agricultural process, one wireless sensor network is designed for regional-scale
    applications, such as weather stations and the second network is designed for
    on-farm applications such as monitoring of temperature for protecting agricultural
    field from frost. To monitor physiological condition of plants, Mahan et al. [72]
    proposed a smart cop IRT. The designed system is cost effective which can be easily
    deployed in large areas and helps in providing wireless operations that are more
    appropriate in various research and applications. To monitor climatic conditions
    such as temperature, humidity and amount of soil moisture. In agricultural field
    Mendez et al. [73] designed a Wi-Fi based network which is capable to intelligently
    monitor the condition of agricultural field in a designed manner. Table 4 summarizes
    the work reported on enviromental parameters to achieve precision agricluture.
    Table 4 Summarizes the work reported on environmental parameters of precision
    agriculture Full size table 3 WSNs Technologies in Precision Agriculture 3.1 Communication
    Technologies In wireless sensor communication various technologies are used to
    transmit the data from agriculture field to central point. The specification of
    these technologies is described in Table 5. Whereas, the WSNs communication technologies
    used in PA is given in Table 6. Table 5 Available communication technologies with
    specification for precision agriculture Full size table Table 6 Communication
    technology reported for precision agriculture in literature Full size table 1.
    ZigBee—ZigBee is low-cost, low-rate, and less-power consumer device as compared
    with other wireless technologies that helps in secure and efficient transmission
    of data from source to destination. By applying a wireless sensor network based
    on ZigBee to an agriculture field data regarding to the conditions of field is
    properly transmitted to the user at high data transmission rate [74]. 2. Bluetooth—Bluetooth
    is a small range, low-power consuming device for wireless sensor network which
    helps in transmit data from one user to other in a range of 100 meters. It operates
    on the frequency band of 2.4 GHz [75]. 3. Wi-Fi—wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) is IEEE
    standard 802.11b for wireless local area network which is operated in frequency
    band of 2.4 GHz deploy in a distributed way to cover the range of hundred meters.
    Wi-Fi is the most successful technology of wireless sensor networks few years
    ago Wi-Fi was only available on laptops but now a day’s Wi-Fi is easily available
    in cell phones, cameras, TV etc. [76]. 4. GPRS—general packet radio service (GPRS)
    provides fast speed of data transmission to the users. It uses the frequency range
    of 2.4 GHz. GPRS provides faster and long distance connection for data transmission.
    Range of GPRS is spread up to kilometres according to the coverage area of GPRS
    [77]. 5. WiMAX—worldwide inter-operability for microwave access (WiMAX) is an
    IEEE 802.16e standard used for a long distance communication technology. With
    the integration of WiMAX technology, the capacity of network can be raised up
    to 70 mbps [78]. 3.2 Sensors Used in PA Sensors provide huge contribution in various
    applications. In agriculture, sensors plays vital role for measuring various parameters
    of agricultural field. Tables 7, 8 show the different sensors that are used for
    precision agriculture. These tables also provide the details of temperature range
    and other capabilities of the sensors. Further, Table 9 illustrates the different
    sensor reported in the literature to monitor and measure the different parameters
    for achieving precision agriculture. Table 10 shows the list of different crops
    which are tested for precision agriculture using WSNs technology. Table 7 Sensor

    weather conditions Full size table Table 9 List of sensor reported for precision
    agriculture in literature work Full size table Table 10 List of crops reported
    for precision agriculture in literature work Full size table 4 Conclusion In this
    study, the adaptability of the WSN is explored in the field of precision agriculture.
    It is observed that there is the incremental growth to adopt the WSN in PA and
    having wide range of the applicability. It is reported that WSNs are widely used
    to monitor agricultural fields, optimize irrigation for the crops, measure temperature
    and soil properties. In this paper, seventy-eight articles are studied and arranged
    these articles into three different categories i.e. monitoring of the crops, irrigation
    management and environmental parameters management. Further, this review also
    discusses the different communication technologies of WSNs available for precision
    agriculture in literature. A list of different sensor used in PA is also given.
    The major contribution of this literature to scientific community is given below.
    RQ1) From literature, it is seen that number of techniques/tools are designed
    by various researchers for PA using WSNs. These tools are IMOTE2, Arduino, EZ430-RF2500,
    MDA300 sensor board, EZ43-RF2500, MDA300, Indriya, MICAZ, ZKOS, MSP430, PIC16F877,
    CVX toolbox, MOSEK, Veris mobile sensor platform, MDA320, MTS400. These tools
    integrate the different sensors on it and collect the information regarding various
    parameters of PA and this information is used for decision making. It is observed
    that Arduino platform is widely adopted as a platform to integrate different sensors
    due to low cost and ease to embed. It is also seen that some algorithms are also
    developed for effective monitoring and smart irrigation of crops. These algorithms
    include OASNDFA, DCTA, BOP, LAA, distributed localization algorithm, range based
    localization algorithms, polynomial-time algorithms for deployment of nodes, electromagnetic
    induction algorithm, MLR, PCR and PLSR methods. Some of new communication protocols
    are also reported in few research articles like APTEEN protocol, Fuzzy based energy
    efficient protocol, ECHERP. It is also revealed that the Tiny OS and Tiny OS 2.0
    are taken as operating system for sensors. RQ2) In precision agriculture, large
    numbers of sensors are adopted for collecting the real time information about
    the growth of crops as well as different environmental parameters like humidity,
    temperature, soil moisture etc. All these information is collected through randomly
    deployed sensor nodes. Further, this information is collected on a central point
    for processing purpose. The processed information is used in decision making and
    action is taken according the processed information. Table 9 shows the list of
    different sensors reported in literature. This table also illustrates the significance
    of each sensor and citation details of these sensors are also given. The working
    of few sensors is discussed as Sensor s8000 measures the PH parameter, HYDRA-PROBE
    II sensor measure conductivity, salinity, soil moisture, and temperature values.
    EC-10HS measure the moisture of soil, EC-5 sensor for measuring soil moisture,
    SHT-11 sensor for measuring temperature and humidity, N-sensor for measuring the
    requirement of nitrogen to the crop, VH400 is a soil-moisture sensor which measure
    the amount of moisture present in soil, DS1822 sensor is used to measure the temperature,
    SEN-13322 sensors measure the volumetric content of water in the soil. It is found
    that PA cannot achieve without the help of these sensors. Table 8 illustrates
    the list of sensors used for measuring weather conditions. It is seen that in
    PA, most of works is reported on measuring the soil parameters. RQ3) Large numbers
    of crops are taken into consideration in literature to validate the applicability
    of the WSNs in agriculture. The aim to adopt the WSNs in agriculture is to monitor
    the crops, irrigation management and measure the different environmental parameters
    which are responsible for the growth and improved quality of the crops. Table
    10 demonstrates the list of crops which are considered for experimentation. It
    is found that eighteen different crops are taken by researchers to investigate
    the role of WSNs in agriculture. These crops include broccoli crop, cotton plant,
    orange orchards, orchid greenhouses, vinyl greenhouse, sugarcane field, grape
    farms, pepper vegetable greenhouse, potato crop, citrus and blueberry crop, maize
    field, wheat, peach orchards and many more. Further, it is observed that WSNs
    is widely used to monitor the growth of crops in green houses. RQ4) From literature,
    it is seen that five communication technologies are adopted in WSNs for PA. These
    communication technologies are described in Table 5. These are Bluetooth, ZigBee,
    Wi-Fi, GPRS/GSM and WiMAX. Out of these five techniques, only four techniques
    are used. Presently, WiMAX communication technology is not adopted in PA till
    date due to high cost and large size. Table 6 shows the various communication
    technologies cited in different research articles. It is concluded that most of
    researchers works with the ZigBee communication technology due to high transmission
    range and low cost and cited in twenty-seven research articles. The second most
    valuable communication technology is GSM/GPRS and it is cited in sixteen research
    articles. Apart from these, several points can be highlighted from this study.
    Seventy-eight SCI listed research articles are included in this study from thirty-five
    different journals. In PA, lot of works are reported on measuring soil parameters
    including soil moisture, PH value, soil temperature etc., for improving quality
    of crops. For effective monitoring and irrigation management, some algorithms
    are also presented by various researchers in the field of PA. Tiny OS and Tiny
    OS 2.0 are adopted as operating system for sensor nodes due to low complexity.
    It is noted that Arduino platform is widely adopted to integrate the different
    component of WSNs in PA. In PA, some work is also reported on communication protocols.
    Some of new communication protocols are developed for effective communication
    between different components of WSNs. This review also lightens on the communication
    technologies adopted in WSNs for PA. It is found that till date only four communication
    technologies is used. It is seen that widely adopted communication technology
    is ZigBee. A lot of crops have been investigated by using WSNs for precision agriculture.
    It is observed that vineyard crop is examined multiple times. EC-5 senor is widely
    used for measuring the soil moisture. Some works are also presented on the deployment
    of sensor nodes in agriculture filed. In few research articles, automatic irrigation
    model is also proposed and these models also reduce the human effort. Few of articles
    are reported on intrusion detection in the agriculture field. Hence, there is
    a scope of work in this direction. Lack of work is reported on the usability of
    fertilizers in the agriculture field. Abbreviations APTEEN: Adaptive periodic

    commercial fifth-generation (5G) wireless communications networks have already
    been deployed with the aim of providing high data rates. However, the rapid growth
    in the number of smart devices and the emergence of the Internet of Everything
    (IoE) applications, which require an ultra-reliable and low-latency communication,
    will result in a substantial burden on the 5G wireless networks. As such, the
    data rate that could be supplied by 5G networks will unlikely sustain the enormous
    ongoing data traffic explosion. This has motivated research into continuing to
    advance the existing wireless networks toward the future generation of cellular
    systems, known as sixth generation (6G). Therefore, it is essential to provide
    a prospective vision of the 6G and the key enabling technologies for realizing
    future networks. To this end, this paper presents a comprehensive review/survey
    of the future evolution of 6G networks. Specifically, the objective of the paper
    is to provide a comprehensive review/survey about the key enabling technologies
    for 6G networks, which include a discussion about the main operation principles
    of each technology, envisioned potential applications, current state-of-the-art
    research, and the related technical challenges. Overall, this paper provides useful
    information for industries and academic researchers and discusses the potentials
    for opening up new research directions. A diagram shows the ultra era in 6G networks.

    Water is a vital and scarce resource in agriculture and its optimal management
    is emerging as a key challenge. This paper presents an automated irrigation system
    to reduce water utilization in agriculture by combining the Internet of Things
    (IoT), cloud computing and optimization tools. The automated irrigation system
    deploys low cost sensors to sense variables of interest such as soil moisture,
    pH, soil type, and weather conditions. The data is stored in Thingspeak cloud
    service for monitoring and data-storage. The field data is transmitted to the
    cloud using Wi-Fi modem and using GSM cellular networks. Then an optimization
    model is used to compute the optimal irrigation rate which are automated using
    a solenoid valve controlled using an ARM controller (WEMOS D1). The variables
    of interest are stored in the cloud and offered as a service to the farmers. The
    proposed approach is demonstrated on a pilot scale agricultural facility and our
    results demonstrate the reduction in water utilization, increase in data-availability,
    and visualization. Published in: 2018 15th International Conference on Control,

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Singapore SECTION I. Introduction Sustaining
    agricultural productivity, guaranteeing food-security, and enhancing economic
    growth in the face of climate variability, diminishing labour force, and changing
    soil conditions requires innovation in agriculture. In India, agriculture contributes
    18% of the country''s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employs more than 50% of
    the population [1]. Notwithstanding these contributions, the sector is under stress
    and the recent economic survey of the Indian government has pointed out the need
    to extract “more crop per drop” which indicates exploiting technology and good
    practices to enhance productivity per drop of water. While this is largely dependent
    on the irrigation system, recent developments in technology are being touted as
    solutions [2]. The real-time environmental parameters such as temperature, soil
    moisture, humidity, evapotranspiration, cropping cycles, and others influence
    the crop lifecycle. Resource utilization can be optimized by real-time monitoring
    of these parameters and taking corrective actions based on sensed information.
    In this backdrop, the Internet of Things (IoT) with has emerged as an enabler
    of agriculture automation [3]–[5]. The IoT uses recent advances in sensing, networking,
    and computing technologies to enable novel applications and services. The use
    of IoT for crop monitoring has been studied in [6]–[9]. Fusing crop statistical
    information and agricultural environmental information was studied in [10]. However,
    control functionalities were not studied in these investigation. The investigations
    in [11] and [12] proposed a framework with limited control functions. The role
    of IoT for controlling the water consumption in irrigation has been studied by
    many scientists as well. A simple irrigation system was studied in [13]. An advanced
    system was proposed in [14] that aims to transform traditional farming to modern
    one. The investigation in [15] proposed using wireless sensor networks for managing
    irrigation in agricultural farms. The framework proposed allowed user to interact
    with the data and consult in a comfortable way. An IoT based smart farm irrigation
    system was proposed in [16] wherein Zigbee was used for communication between
    sensor nodes and base station. While data was collected and processed in these
    investigation, combining cloud computing with IoT was not fully explored. This
    provides additional opportunities due to the service delivery models of the cloud.
    Recently significant efforts have been devoted to combine IoT and cloud computing
    [17], [19], [20] showed that the IoT benefits can be enhanced by combining it
    with cloud computing. The role of cloud-based IoT scheme for precision agriculture
    was studied in [18]. However, the final control aspect has not been considered.
    Similarly, optimization models for irrigation have been studied in [21] without
    discussions on monitoring and control. A review of the literature reveals that
    existing approaches on using IoT are restricted to monitoring and data-aggregation.
    Final control including optimization of resources has not been studied in the
    literature to our best knowledge. In this paper, we combine the IoT sensing and
    networking capability with cloud interfaces, use the data to study the optimal
    irrigation rates, and finally implement the computed flow rates by commanding
    a solenoid valve. Consequently, a comprehensive solution including sensing, networking,
    control, and optimization is proposed. Such a methodology has not been proposed
    for agricultural irrigation purposes to our best knowledge. The main contributions
    of the paper are: A smart irrigation system that uses IoT and cloud-connectivity
    to aggregate and store information, an optimization model to compute the optimal
    irrigation parameters, and final control implemented using solenoid valves. Design
    aspects of IoT hardware, software, and their integration along with networking
    as well as cloud connectivity are discussed. Demonstrate the control methodology
    and hardware using experiments/simulations. The rest of the paper is organized
    as follows. Section II presents the system architecture and design which describes
    the various components of the system. The optimization model for irrigation control
    is presented in Section III. Results and observations are presented in Section
    IV. Conclusions are drawn from the obtained results and analysis in Section V.
    SECTION II. System Architecture and Design Fig. 1: IoT architecture of the smart
    irrigation system Show All The IoT architecture used for implementing the precision
    irrigation system is shown in Fig. 1. The components of the architecture are listed
    in Tab. I. The components are selected based on cost-reliability analysis. While
    the low-cost sensors lead to reliability issues, they perform reasonably well
    for the application considered. In this work low cost soil moisture and flow sensors
    are used. The sensors send the data to the WEMOS D1 controller and the controller
    controls the flow using sensed information. The controller controls the solenoid
    valve through which the field is irrigated. The controller also controls the DC
    motor on/off state since the motor has to be on only when any one of the valve
    is in open state. The controller is connected to the internet through the GSM
    GPRS module. The internet connectivity is provided through GSM as broadband is
    not feasible in many rural agricultural areas, whereas more than 70% of the land
    in India is feasible with GSM based cellular network. The information retrieved
    from the field is used to control the irrigation system, and it is also stored
    in the cloud (Thingspeak) for further analysis. Remote monitoring of the field
    was provided through web interface and mobile interface. The farm is split into
    several sectors as depicted in Fig. 2, the water flows through different valves
    for each sector which are deployed with a set of sensors for monitoring and a
    solenoid valve as an actuator. The sectors are sort of control regimes for which
    the water can be irrigated. This helps organizing the irrigation and monitoring
    to meet the needs of the individual sectors, thereby better management can be
    achieved. Having described the architecture, we provide a succinct description
    of the different components used in the hardware. Fig. 2: Organization of agriculture
    land as sectors Show All Table I: Components of the architecture 1) WEMOS D1 Controller
    The D1 is an ESP8266 (Wi-Fi) based controller which is compatible with the Arduino
    IDE. The functions are same as the Arduino Uno controller, whereas the WEMOS has
    the ESP8266 module by default on the board hence reducing the complexity of interfacing
    an ESP8266 with Arduino Uno. ADCs(Analog to Digital convertors) were used to interface
    multiple analog sensors to the controller. 2) Solenoid Valve The traditional valves
    are replaced with solenoid valves to control the flow. The valve is operated either
    in ON/OFF mode and a pulse-width modulation approach is used to control the flow,
    i.e., the amount of flow is proportional to the time-period for which the valve
    remains in ON state over a given time period. A 24 V relay is used to turn ON/OFF
    the solenoid valve. 3) Soil Moisture Sensor In our design, YL69 series soil moisture
    sensor or probe measures the volumetric water content in the soil. Determining
    soil moisture is considered as an important task in agriculture to assist farmers
    manage the irrigation systems more effectively. Compared to other low cost sensor
    such as gypsum block sensors, these probes tender a rapid response time. Due to
    this reason the sensor is chosen and used in the proposed design. Placing the
    soil moisture sensor in the right place is very important, since a sector''s irrigation
    is controlled by the value of the soil moisture sensor deployed for that sector.
    The soil moisture sensor works between 3.3V and 5V power supply. The output value
    of the sensor is between 0 ohms to 1000 ohms. Based on the sensor reading the
    soil can be classified into Dry, Humid and wet. The soil moisture sensor used
    is connected to the analog pin of the controller through wire. The sensor range
    for determining the soil type is shown in Tab. II. Table II: Resistance range
    of soil moisture sensor 4) Flow Sensor In this system flow sensor (YF-201) is
    used to measure the amount of water utilized in the process of irrigation. The
    amount of water utilized has to be measured in the experimental setup for the
    traditional and automated irrigation methods so that comparison can be easily
    carried out. The water flow sensor is aligned in parallel with the water line,
    and a pinwheel inside the sensor is used for measuring the water irrigated through
    it. The water flow is measured in litres/second. 5) Data Transmission Transferring
    the collected information from the farm to the Internet is a major issue as internet
    connectivity through broadband to agricultural area is still an infeasible solution
    in more than 50% of the agricultural lands across India. In this work the data
    is transmitted using the GPRS internet connectivity available through the cellular
    network providers. The cellular network covers majority of the agricultural lands
    in India and with the emergence of 3G and 4G technology it is possible to transmit
    data quickly. Instead of using a GPRS module along with the controller, we have
    used a Wi-Fi hotspot device for data transmission from the controller to the internet
    as the transmission speed is high when using hot spot as compared with a GSM GPRS
    module of the controller. The use of WEMOS controller has reduced the complexity
    in interfacing an ESP8266 when compared to Arduino. The GSM module is used to
    send messages from the controller regarding the status of the field. Fig. 3: ThingSpeak
    web interface Show All Table III: Sample data stored in thingspeak A. Cloud-Based
    Remote Monitoring The Irrigation system is initiated based on the soil moisture
    sensor value. The field is irrigated automatically using the solenoid valve or
    sprinkler. The solenoid valve and the sprinkler were connected to the controller
    using relay switch. The data from the controller is transmitted to the Thingspeak
    cloud, and the data can be viewed using Thingspeak website. The user interface
    is a simple monitoring interface which shows the readings from the sensor, the
    solenoid valve status and the amount of water used. The screen shot of the ThingSpeak
    web interface is shown in Fig. 4 and the snippet of the data displayed is shown
    in Table III. Similarly the PH value of the soil, Humidity and temperature were
    also stored in cloud. Thingspeak cloud service is an easy to access service and
    has inbuilt lab view functions. Fig. 4 shows the Thingspeak Cloud Service Interface
    for a smart phone wherein the data are represented in charts. The data feeds can
    be stored in the Thingspeak along with the timestamp for further analysis and
    for providing real-time data visualization. Fig. 4: ThingSpeak interface for smart
    phone Show All SECTION III. Optimization Model Computing the minimum irrigation
    rates based on sensed information is a decision making problem requiring help
    of optimization tools. Therefore, we model the optimal irrigation problem as an
    optimization problem. We define the following: Definition 1 The difference between
    the planting and harvesting time is denoted as the irrigation period. Definition
    2 Maximal rainfall over the irrigation period denoted by R max is the upper bound
    on the rainfall during the period. Our objective is to minimize the irrigation
    of the water over a 24 hour horizon which is given by I= ∑ t =QΔt where Q denotes
    the flow and Δ unit time step used in the analysis. In addition, we aim to exploit
    the use of rain water, and soil moisture content. the objective is modelled as:

    where w 1 , w 2 and w 3 are weighing factors, S t soil moisture content at time

    by Q(t)≥ ( e t − r t − S t + d t ) Δ Q(t)≤ W R max (t)− r t − S t + d t Δ (4)

    R max maximum water reserve, respectively. In addition, the evapotranspiration
    rate is constrained by EP(t)≤ r t + S t +Q(t)Δ− d t ∀t (5) View Source In addition,
    the rainfall, soil moisture, flow-rate, and drain are all positive real-values

    problem and can be solved with open source solvers such as Gnu Linear Programming
    Kit on single-board computers such as BeagleBone Black. However, in our analysis,
    the problem was solved in a computer using MATLAB''s linprog routine. SECTION
    IV. Results A. Real-Time Experiments In our experiments, a pilot having four land
    sectors each 2×2 square feet were taken to test the method. One sector was irrigated
    using traditional method in which the water flow was controlled manually, and
    the other three (Automated Irrigation, Drip Irrigation, Sprinkler Irrigation)
    were irrigated with the automated method using sensors and actuators (solenoid
    valve, sprinkler, and Drip). The spinach named Amaranthus tricolor seeds was sown
    in even quantity and grown in the entire four land sector. Water flow sensor,
    soil moisture sensor, soil PH sensor, was installed in all the sectors. Weather
    sensors like humidity, temperature Sensor and rain sensor were deployed in common
    for all the four sectors. The actuators were connected to the controller using
    wired connection. The input to the sprinkler was given using a low pressure water
    pipe as the land sector taken for irrigation is small. The irrigation was done
    based on the moisture sensor value. Different moisture values are set for different
    crops, in the experimental set up the value was set to less than 300 ohms to 950
    ohms, if the value drops below 300 ohms then the solenoid valves were opened and
    the field is irrigated and if the value was greater than 950 ohms then the solenoid
    valves were closed. For drip irrigation automation, the solenoid valves were used
    to supply water to the drip irrigation tube. In the sprinkler irrigation system
    sprinkler is supplied with a low pressure water input as the experimental prototype
    is for demonstration purpose. The soil moisture metric used to automate the irrigation
    makes sure that the land is not dry at any point of time. The data is uploaded
    to the things speak cloud using write API key. The experiments were conducted
    for a period of 3 weeks. To test the effectiveness of the optimization approach,
    we first propose a moisture based control as shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5: Moisture-based
    control Show All The following two scenarios were compared: Flow control based
    on moisture level with valve control, sprinkler control, and drip irrigation;
    Flow control using optimization approach with valve irrigation, sprinkler control,
    and drip irrigation; In the optimization model, the change in irrigation conditions
    correlate to change in the limits of the flow-rates Q(t) . B. Results with Heuristic
    Control The flows for a period of 3 weeks were used to study the effectiveness
    of the flow-based control. The results of all three automated irrigation methods
    were compared with conventional method. In Drip irrigation method the system is
    highly efficient saving around 24%, compared to 20% in sprinkler and 16% in Solenoid
    valve based automated irrigation. In this experimental prototype, deficient watering
    condition was eliminated as the water resources were sufficient throughout the
    experiment. Water deficit might occur when the system is implemented in the real
    agricultural field due to water scarcity. The data is stored in cloud with ease
    using the API funtions in thingspeak. The flow control over for a period of six
    days with flow-based control is shown in Fig. 6 shows that the drip irrigation
    the flow is relatively lower than other irrigation systems. C. Simulation Results
    with Optimization Based Control The flows for a period of 1 week with optimization
    based control was used to study the effectiveness of optimization based control
    for the three irrigation schemes. In drip irrigation method the method provided
    31.2% over conventional method and an increase in 7% savings over flow-based control.
    Similarly, in sprinkler irrigation, the savings were 26% and 22% in solenoid valve
    based control. Our simulations shows that optimization based control outperforms
    the flow-based control in terms of water savings. Fig. 6: Automated versus manual
    control with sprinkler system for flow-based control Show All Fig. 7: Automated
    versus manual control with sprinkler system for optimization-based control Show
    All D. Observations It was observed that the pH value of the soil decreases with
    an increase in moisture levels. The IoT and cloud-connectivity enhanced the data-aggregation
    and visualization capability significantly. Combining IoT, cloud-connectivity,
    and optimization models will help enhance water efficiency of the agriculture
    systems. The irrigation system was automated by connecting solenoid values which
    helped increase the agility of the control. SECTION V. Conclusions This investigation
    presented an automated irrigation system to reduce water utilization in agriculture
    by combining Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and optimization. The
    automated irrigation system is realized by deploying low-cost sensors to sense
    variables of interest such as pH, temperature, humidity, soil type and weather
    conditions. The data is stored in Thingspeak cloud service for monitoring and
    storage. Then an optimization model for reducing the water usage was proposed
    and constraints modelling the physical conditions were included. The optimal flow
    rate was determined solving the optimization model and it was shown that the flow
    rate can be automated using solenoid valves. The optimization-based control was
    compared with flow-based control and our results demonstrated that optimization
    models help in reducing the water consumption. Improving the optimization models
    and enhancing the IoT prototype are future course of this investigation. Authors

    Abstract: Water, one of the most valuable resources, is underutilized in irrigated\
    \ rice production. The\nyield of rice, a staple food across the world, is highly\
    \ dependent on having proper irrigation systems.\nAlternate wetting and drying\
    \ (AWD) is an effective irrigation method mainly used for irrigated\nrice production.\
    \ However, unattended, manual, small-scale, and discrete implementations cannot\n\
    achieve the maximum beneﬁt of AWD. Automation of large-scale (over 1000 acres)\
    \ implementation\nof AWD can be carried out using wide-area wireless sensor network\
    \ (WSN). An automated AWD\nsystem requires three different WSNs: one for water\
    \ level and environmental monitoring, one for\nmonitoring of the irrigation system,\
    \ and another for controlling the irrigation system. Integration of\nthese three\
    \ different WSNs requires proper dimensioning of the AWD edge elements (sensor\

    \ can further enhance the performance of the automated AWD system.\nInternet of\

    and control proper distribution of water in the ﬁeld, which signiﬁcantly helps\
    \ to reduce conveyance\nloss. This system utilizes 250 pumps, grouped into 10\
    \ clusters, to ensure equal water distribution\namongst the users (ﬁeld owners)\
    \ in the wide area. The proposed automation algorithm handles the\ncomplexity\
    \ of maintaining proper water pressure throughout the pipe network, scheduling\
    \ the pump,\nand controlling the water outlets. Mathematical models are presented\
    \ for proper dimensioning of\nthe AWD. A low-power and long-range sensor node\

    \ is the second highest ranked food staple in the world, feeding\none third (2.6\
    \ billion) of the population (7.8 billion). About 90% [1] of the world’s rice\
    \ is\nproduced in Asia, and it is the fastest growing staple food in Africa and\
    \ Latin America [2]\ndue to its ease of preparation compared to that of corn and\
    \ wheat. It provides 21% of global\nhuman energy per capita and is the largest\
    \ single source of energy [3]. A total of 75% of\nworld rice is produced in 92\
    \ million hectares of irrigated lowland, and Asia occupies 56%\nof this land [4].\
    \ Irrigated rice uses up to 43% of the world’s irrigated water, which is two to\n\

    Sensors 2021, 21, 6040\n2 of 23\nthree times more than other irrigated crops,\
    \ and thus places an excessive demand on water\nusage compared to other staple\
    \ crops.\nBangladesh, an Asian country with a growing population and an increasing\
    \ demand\nfor rice, is playing an important role in rice research. According to\
    \ the Bangladesh Rice\nResearch Institute (BRRI), the main source of irrigation\
    \ for rice is from ground water.\nHowever, the ground water is retrieved using\
    \ shallow tube wells (STW) and deep tube\nwells (DTW), which is resulting in deteriorating\
    \ ground water levels [5]. The production of\n1 kg of rice requires 3000–5000\
    \ L of water [6], and Boro rice, which is generally grown in dry\nmonths, predominantly\
    \ relies upon the groundwater. In order to address this situation, the\nInternational\
    \ Rice Research Institute (IRRI) developed an irrigation method called alternate\n\
    wetting and drying (AWD) that requires 30% less water than the traditional irrigation\n\
    method used during the growing phase [7]. Studies presented in [8] have shown\
    \ that,\ncompared to the traditional method, AWD requires ﬁve fewer irrigation\
    \ cycles and fewer\npumps which saves about 40% of fuel. Besides minimizing the\
    \ use of groundwater, AWD\nreduces irrigation cycles without affecting the yield\
    \ [9]. Due to intermittent ﬂooding in\nAWD, emission of the greenhouse gas methane\
    \ (CH4) is reduced by 73% in the dry season\nand by 21% in the wet season [10],\
    \ compared to the continuous ﬂooding method. This also\ndecreases arsenic concentration\
    \ in the shoots of rice plants [11].\nUnlike other countries adopting AWD, where\
    \ water is charged based on volumetric\nusage, most of Bangladesh’s irrigation\
    \ water is charged per hectare, without any incentives\nfor the farmers to reduce\
    \ their water usage. Sharing a single pump amongst the farmers\noften gives rise\
    \ to conﬂicts that usually deter any collaborative effort [11], which is a key\n\
    point of AWD. The lack of proper knowledge and information sharing are also limiting\
    \ the\nadoption of the AWD method. Research has shown that there is a signiﬁcant\
    \ opportunity\nfor AWD in Southeast Asian countries such as Bangladesh and Vietnam\
    \ [12]; however, due\nto social, economic, and technical challenges, the AWD method\
    \ is not well perceived in\nthese regions [13].\nBesides the challenges of AWD\
    \ described above, applying AWD to a wide area\nposes additional challenges, such\
    \ as monitoring and controlling the complex mechanism,\nbefore it can become economically\
    \ feasible. To achieve this, an automated IoT-connected\nwireless sensor network\
    \ (WSN) is required. WSN is a network of sensors that accumulates\nmonitoring\
    \ data in centrally located storage, such as cloud storage. Most WSNs require\n\
    three different types of network elements including the sensor node (SN), the\
    \ cluster head\n(CH) and the data sink (DS), also called a base station, as shown\
    \ in Figure 1a. All of the SNs\nare distributed into multiple, unequal clusters\
    \ headed by a CH that sends sensor data to\nthe DS. Functionally, the clustering\
    \ process and data transfer protocol may vary depending\non the nature of the\
    \ application and the distribution of the SNs. Recent applications also\nrequire\
    \ these WSNs to be connected with other networks through gateways and to the\n\
    internet infrastructure [14], as shown in Figure 1a.\nIoT is the network of various\
    \ smart devices to facilitate information ﬂow to the end-\nuser through the existing\

    \ WSN has been implemented on a limited scale in agriculture as\nreported in [21–24].\
    \ Most WSN- and IoT-based irrigation automation systems utilize soil\nSensors\

    \ to schedule irrigation without con-\nsidering plant growth; however, this is\
    \ insufﬁcient for automating the AWD method and\ngaining the farmers’ trust. Besides\
    \ monitoring and controlling the pumps, an effective\nwater distribution system\
    \ through pipes is also required, giving rise to the added com-\nplexity of having\
    \ to both monitoring and controlling the distribution system. Moreover,\npresent\
    \ WSN technologies are optimized for applications with densely populated SN and\n\
    small area coverage. Wide-area monitoring requires long-range and low-power wireless\n\
    connectivity [25]. Therefore, wide-area AWD automation involves three different\
    \ WSNs,\ndedicated for (1) ﬁeld water-level and environmental monitoring; (2)\
    \ irrigation system\nmonitoring; and (3) irrigation system controlling, as shown\
    \ in Figure 1b. Therefore, densely\npopulated and widely distributed sensor and\
    \ actuator nodes are required for these three\ndifferent WSNs. These three WSNs\
    \ will be interconnected virtually. Traditional WSN virtu-\nalization involves\
    \ multilayer connectivity and control, which increases inter-layer WSN\ntrafﬁc\
    \ [26] for the AWD application. Besides wide-area coverage, automated AWD also\n\
    requires external parameters, such as real-time weather forecast data, plant physiological\n\
    data, and the farmers’ input. These data can be used by connecting the WSNs with\
    \ different\nservers throughout the IoT network, as shown in Figure 1b.\nSensors\

    \ plans and work needed on this\ntopic.\n2. Related Work\nIrrigation automation\
    \ is not a very recent phenomenon and, as a result, is usually\nperformed by adopting\
    \ existing mathematical models and optimization algorithms. These\nprimarily control\
    \ the irrigation pumps to maximize water utilization. Baki et al. [32]\nhave proposed\
    \ a numerical scheme that utilizes weather forecasts and the water ﬂow\nin soils\
    \ to determine the optimal irrigation depth on scheduled irrigation days for the\n\
    highest irrigation efﬁciency and optimum crop yield. Shahdany et al. [33] developed\n\
    a mathematical model to automate canal irrigation using both known and unknown\n\
    water demands for different irrigation systems. Besides the model-based optimization\n\
    approaches, machine learning is also used by [34] to predict crop irrigation requirements\n\
    based on soil parameters. Linker et al. [35] proposed a real-time and sub-optimal\
    \ irrigation\nscheduling system that utilizes weather data alongside the crop’s\
    \ physiological state\nand soil water availability. However, users need to decide\
    \ between yield and irrigation\nperformance depending on their applications. To\
    \ achieve better optimization, Munir\net al. [36] included parameters such as\
    \ the plant type, watering time, air humidity, light\nintensity, and soil type\
    \ for their fuzzy logic-based irrigation scheduling system that uses low\npower\
    \ sensor-nodes. In [37], the authors designed an irrigation controller prototype\
    \ based\non the fuzzy rule to inspect water wastage by providing an optimal irrigation\
    \ environment\nfor farming. An artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) is used by [38]\
    \ to predict soil moisture\nchanges and to schedule irrigation based on climatic\
    \ information and rooting depth. This\nANN method was compared with the established\
    \ water stress (WS) method, which well\npredicted the soil moisture during the\
    \ main growing season, but was error prone at lower\nSensors 2021, 21, 6040\n\
    5 of 23\nsoil moisture levels. ANN and non-linear regression (NLR) were used by\
    \ [39] to ﬁnd the\ndistances between the emitters in order to achieve optimum\
    \ drip irrigation in the wet areas.\nHuman expertise is also used by [40] for\
    \ their proposed online decision support system\n(DSS), which consists of a meteorological\
    \ model for weather forecasts, and a computational\nmodel for soil water balance\
    \ and irrigation scheduling. It generates an irrigation schedule\nfor a week in\
    \ advance based on the DSS data repository.\nIrrigation automation is further\
    \ upgraded by utilizing various sensors, wireless links,\nand internet infrastructure\
    \ due to the increasing availability and decreasing cost of these\ntechnologies.\
    \ Water level-based scheduling was proposed by [41] and uses a low-cost water\n\
    level sensor along with inputs from the local farmers through the IoT. In [42],\
    \ the authors\npresent a framework using an IoT-based water distribution and management\
    \ system that\nutilizes water ﬂow meters, ultrasonic sensors and motors. The over-usage\
    \ of freshwater for\nﬂood irrigation is addressed by [43]. The author proposed\
    \ an IoT-based intelligent decision\nsupport system to improve the farmer’s water\
    \ utilization by using weather data and sensor\ndata. A complete irrigation supervisory\
    \ control and data acquisition ( SCADA) with WSN\nwas implemented by [44] to compare\
    \ seven different irrigation scheduling algorithms and\nfound that soil-based\
    \ approaches were not adequate in providing sufﬁcient water for the\nplants.\n\
    Recently, more irrigation research on automated AWD systems is being reported\
    \ in\nthe academic literature. Localized pump automation is achieved by sensing\
    \ the water\nlevel lacking remote monitoring or IoT connectivity and using solar\
    \ panels as the power\nsource [45]. An IoT-based system integrates laser sensors\
    \ for precise water level measure-\nment for automation of the AWD technique [46].\
    \ The proposed system was implemented\nfor different sizes of ﬁelds, from 0.7\
    \ acres to 55.8 acres.\nBesides these local and remote irrigation automations,\
    \ performance optimization of\nthe WSN platform is also focused on by [47]. They\
    \ developed a 3D ray-launching (3D-RL)\ndeterministic algorithm to characterize\
    \ the radio channel of LoRa and LoRa wide area\nnetwork (LoRaWAN) in order to\
    \ provide better connectivity to transmit sensor data in\nobstacle ﬁlled scenarios\
    \ for irrigation automation. Cardoso et al. [48] have proposed a\nnarrow band\
    \ IoT (NB-IoT) and LoRa-based system to monitor and schedule irrigation\nusing\
    \ machine learning.\nUnlike irrigation automation, AWD requires additional parameters\
    \ such as plant\nphysiological data in order to automate the irrigation system.\
    \ As discussed in the previ-\nous paragraph, some irrigation automation utilizes\
    \ weather data or plant physiological\ninformation from the farmer; however, this\
    \ platform targeted only a single pump as the\nirrigation control unit. Most of\
    \ these solutions are ofﬂine, of the open-loop type, and do not\nsynthesize the\
    \ data from all of the different sources. They lack wide-area considerations\n\
    and do not focus on the complexity that comes with the integration of multiple\
    \ physical\nand logical WSNs with the IoT. Proper dimensioning of pipe-based water\
    \ distribution\nnetworks, pump clustering, irrigation depth, and plant lifecycle-speciﬁc\
    \ schedule mapping\nis absent. Therefore, any one of them individually or in combination\
    \ may not be suitable\nfor the automation of the AWD method in wide area applications,\
    \ which is highly required\nfor the socio-economic success of the AWD implementation.\n\

    \ Bangladesh produces three\ntypes of rice: Aus, Aman, and Boro. The north-west\
    \ part of Bangladesh produces more than\none-third of these three types of rice\
    \ and 35% of Boro rice is produced in the country. Hence,\nthe irrigated lowland\

    \ km, covering more than\nSensors 2021, 21, 6040\n6 of 23\n24 thousand acres of\
    \ cultivable lands that suffers from lack of irrigation. The closest water\nsource\

    \ from water seepage of\nabout 40% [50]. Furthermore, manual AWD is not able to\

    \ The proposed IoT-based automation system\nwith pipe-based water transportation\
    \ and distribution using the AWD system may reduce\nthe seepage loss by up to\
    \ 90% [51]. Local or centralized automation is not adequate in\nmonitoring and\

    \ represented by a simpliﬁed block diagram as shown in Figure 3. This\nsystem\
    \ has three different types of inputs, which are: (i) environmental inputs from\
    \ the\nﬁeld and weather forecast server; (ii) irrigation inputs from a plant physiology\
    \ database;\nand (iii) inputs from the users of the pumping network and water\
    \ distribution system.\nThe environmental parameters to be monitored are temperature,\
    \ pressure, humidity,\nand the greenhouse gas methane (CH4). Rice ﬁelds emit a\
    \ considerable amount of methane,\nwhich can be reduced signiﬁcantly by the intermittent\
    \ ﬂooding that occurs in the AWD\nmethod. The ﬁeld temperature, pressure, and\
    \ humidity data are required to calculate\nthe evapotranspiration loss, seepage\
    \ loss, and water level of the ﬁeld, which are used to\ncalculate the basic parameters\
    \ used in the AWD method. Other environmental parameters,\nsuch as wind speed\
    \ and daylight, can be collected from the weather forecast server through\nthe\
    \ IoT cloud.\nThe wide area AWD requires an adequate number of pumping machines\
    \ and a\npipe-based water distribution system to meet the ﬁeld irrigation requirement.\
    \ To main-\ntain uniform irrigation throughout the area, the water pressures of\
    \ the pipes need to\nbe monitored continuously. The actuators for the water outlets\

    \ To main-\ntain uniform irrigation throughout the area, the water pressures of\

    \ of the IoT–WSN-based AWD automation control loop.\n5. System Design and Integration\n\
    The proposed AWD automation consists of two main parts: (a) design and dimension-\n\
    ing of the AWD system; and (b) design and integration of the WSN. The AWD method\
    \ at\nits core is an irrigation schedule that depends on certain the water requirements\
    \ which vary\ndepending on soil condition and the growth stages of the crop. Automation\
    \ of the AWD\nusing the IoT and WSN requires the sensor and actuator networks\
    \ to be designed together,\nintegration of various service modules, and development\
    \ of the software algorithm. These\nare described in the following sub-sections.\n\
    5.1. Irrigation Scheduling\nThe water volume of the irrigated ﬁeld changes due\
    \ to evapotranspiration and perco-\nlation. Evapotranspiration is inﬂuenced by\
    \ the crop’s growing stage, wind speed, solar ra-\ndiation, temperature, humidity,\
    \ and soil properties. The crop evapotranspiration (ETc) [52]\ncan be calculated\
    \ as\nETc = ET0 × Kc\n(1)\nwhere (Kc) is the crop coefﬁcient (potency of soil\
    \ evaporation and crop transpiration), and\n(ET0) is the reference evapotranspiration.\
    \ Among the different methods, the Food and\nSensors 2021, 21, 6040\n8 of 23\n\
    Agriculture Organization’s (FAO) Penman–Monteith method [52] is considered to\
    \ be the\nbest estimation for ET0, and can be expressed as\nET0 =\n0.408∆ (Rn\
    \ − G) + γ\n900\nT+273u2(es − ea)\n∆ + γ(1 + 0.34u2)\n(2)\nwhere, Rn = net radiation\
    \ at the crop surface (MJ m−2d−1), G = soil heat ﬂux den-\nsity (MJ m−2d−1), T\
    \ = mean air temperature (◦C), ∆ = slope of saturation vapor curve\n(kPa◦C−1),\
    \ u2 = wind speed (ms−1), es = saturation vapor pressure (kPa), and ea = actual\n\
    vapor pressure (kPa).\nWater requirements for rice (WRR) in cm/day is given in\
    \ Equation (3), which measures\nthe receding water level.\nWRRj =\n\x10\nETo ×\
    \ Kcj\n\x11\n+ PERC\n(3)\nwhere PERC is the percolation loss from water seeping\
    \ into the ground through pores, and\nj is the growth-stage index (1 to 3).\n\
    Figure 4 illustrates the irrigation scheduling for the AWD method. The irrigation\n\
    frequency (lower row) changes along with the development stages of the crop. Three\n\
    development stages (transplantation, ﬂowering, and panicle initiation) along with\
    \ a water\nlevel indicator (middle row) are shown to indicate where continuous\
    \ standing water and\nirrigation scheduling is required.\nThe different crop coefﬁcients,\
    \ including Kc of rice, for these three stages are shown in\nFigure 4 [53]. It\
    \ is quite evident when AWD is initiated that, for approximately 5 to 8 days,\n\
    depending on the soil type, no irrigation is required [54]. Continuous standing\
    \ water\nis required at the beginning of all three stages which approximates to\
    \ about 30 days in\ntotal; hence, utilization of the AWD method is suspended during\
    \ these times. Therefore,\ndepending on the stages and in accordance with the\
    \ WRRj, irrigation scheduling is applied.\nIrrigation scheduling is divided into\
    \ two sections. The ﬁrst section is for continuous\nstanding water and the second\
    \ section is for AWD period.\nContinuous Standing Water:\nFor the three development\
    \ stages, if the standing water level recedes to 2 cm from\n5 cm as given in Equation\
    \ (4), then the irrigation schedule or cycle I1j is applied using\nEquation (5).\
    \ I1j represents the number of times the pump is turned on and is used to\nmaintain\
    \ a continuous water level of 5 cm above the ground. In this equation, TPFj is\
    \ the\ntotal number of days related to the transplantation, panicle initiation,\
    \ and ﬂowering stages.\ni f\nT\n∑\nt=1\nWRRj(t) = 3 cm in T days, j ∈ {1, 2, 3}\n\
    (4)\nI1j = TPFj\nT\n(5)\nEstablishment of continuous standing water during these\
    \ stages is necessary as rice is\nquite sensitive to ﬂuctuation in water level.\n\
    Alternate Wetting and Drying Method:\nFor the AWD method, when the water level\
    \ falls 5 cm from above the ground and\nreaches 15 cm below the surface as given\
    \ in Equation (6), then irrigation I2, which is the\nnumber of times the pump\
    \ is turned on, is implemented using Equation (7), where Wj is\nthe total days\
    \ for the AWD method, to bring the water level back to 5 cm above the surface.\n\

    \ is required. \n \nFigure 4. Irrigation scheduling in alternate wetting and drying\

    \ and drying (AWD) irrigation method.\n5.2. Dimensioning of the AWD System\nProper\
    \ dimensioning of the water distribution network’s pipes is required for the\n\
    implementation of a large-scale AWD system. Multiple pumps are used in several\
    \ clusters\nfor a ﬁeld of 25,000 acres to reﬂood the ﬁeld in the shortest time\
    \ possible. Multiple\nclustered-pumps facilitate the multiple inlet rice irrigation\
    \ (MIRI) option available with\nAWD which allows the water to ﬂow into the ﬁelds\
    \ from several inlets, ﬂooding the\nﬁeld in the shortest amount of time. The capacities\
    \ of the pumps are chosen to meet\nthe recommended minimum swift ﬂooding rate\
    \ of 0.00126 m3/s per acre (20 gallons per\nminute per acre), which varies depending\
    \ on the type of soil [55]. Equation (8) shows the\ntotal number of pumps required\
    \ (n), when operating for t hours with pumping capacity\n(c) in m3/s. The available\
    \ pumping capacities include 0.02524, 0.05047, 0.06309, 0.1009,\nand 0.1262 m3/s,\
    \ and are achieved with 400, 800, 1000, 1600, and 2000 GPM (gallons per\nminute)\

    \ acre-inches, it will require a total of 250 pumps with 2000 GPM\ncapacities.\n\
    Beside the volume of water to be delivered, the selection of water pump depends\n\
    on lifting head, water pressure, and parameters of the water sources. Depending\
    \ on the\nlifting head and the source of the water, there are three different\

    \ Bangladesh. For the surface water on\nbodies of water such as rivers and lakes,\
    \ low-lift pumps are used where the lifting head is\nbetween 1 to 5 m. A shallow\
    \ tube well (STW) is used for more than 73% of ground water\nirrigation [56].\
    \ The rest is performed by pumps with higher lifting capacities called deep\n\

    IoT-based automation of the AWD system requires different WSNs for sensors and\n\
    actuators. All of these networks work independently with the same base station.\
    \ A WSN\ncollects ﬁeld parameters such as water level, gas emissions (CH4), temperature,\
    \ pressure,\nand humidity. These data are then transmitted at 15 min intervals.\
    \ The other WSN monitors\nthe pipe and pump health parameters, such as pipe pressure,\
    \ ﬂow rate of water in pipes,\nand pump electric power. Based on these data, it\
    \ generates alarms to shut down the\npump in emergency situations. There is continuous\
    \ monitoring at the SN which allows for\nimmediate action when needed. The actuator\
    \ network operates the actuators of the pipe to\ncontrol the water ﬂow through\
    \ the pipe and is updated every 15 min.\nComparing the low-power wide-area network\
    \ (LPWAN) technologies, LoRa was\nchosen for the WSN in order to achieve the wide\
    \ area coverage needed at the monitoring\narea for the AWD automation. Table 2\
    \ summarizes the LPWAN technology features [14]\nincluding range, data rate, and\
    \ power requirements. It shows that LoRa is the best suited\ntechnology in terms\
    \ of range with higher data rates when compared to Sigfox.\nTable 2. Basic features\

    \ from the SN is controlled by the BS. The BS initiates data request\nmessages\
    \ to a speciﬁc SN using their unique ID and sends an acknowledgement after\nsuccessful\
    \ reception of the sensor data. For the actuator node (AN), the BS sends the\n\
    actuator control messages to the AN, and updates the actuator nodes in the server\
    \ database\nSensors 2021, 21, 6040\n14 of 23\nafter receiving the data and from\
    \ the AN. All of these communications between the WSN\nand the BS are performed\
    \ using LoRa with messages transferred as LoRa packets. The\nBS processes the\
    \ LoRa data packets and sends them to the IoT server as MQTT messages.\nThe commands\
    \ used to control the pumps and actuator, sent from the IoT server, also use\n\
    MQTT. On the user side, a smartphone app and web interface are connected with\
    \ the IoT\nserver through a cloud-implemented MQTT-hypertext transfer protocol\
    \ (HTTP) gateway.\nAll of the data communication and AWD automation processes\
    \ are performed by the\nSN, BS, and cloud IoT server. Figure 8a,b show the possible\
    \ software algorithms designed\nfor the SN and AN, respectively. At ﬁrst, it conﬁgures\
    \ and initializes the sensors, LoRa\nmodule, and driver unit. It then starts reading\
    \ the ﬁeld, pipe, and pump sensors to monitor\ntheir condition continuously. The\
    \ AN takes all necessary actions according to certain\npump operating conditions\
    \ and control logic deﬁned by the user during the initialization\nphase. All the\
    \ internal control variables are updated according to external parameters at\n\
    regular intervals in a closed loop at node A. These external parameters, such\
    \ as user input,\nplant-speciﬁc data, and weather forecasts, are collected through\
    \ the IoT server. Figure 8c\nshows the AWD automation control logic performed\
    \ by the IoT server. The SN algorithm,\nshown in Figure 8a, was used for the ﬁeld\
    \ trial (described in Section 6). The algorithms,\nshown in Figure 8b,c, intended\
    \ for wide-area AWD automation, were not used in the ﬁeld\ntrial. Initially, the\
    \ irrigation phase (TPF or AWD) is ascertained, at which point all of the\nphase\
    \ speciﬁc decisions are taken. For example, the surface water level (SWL) is monitored\n\
    in terms of TPF, and, for the AWD, the below surface water level (BSWL) is checked\
    \ to\ndetermine whether to toggle the actuator nodes on or off. Subsequently,\
    \ after toggling the\nactuators and pumps, the SWL is measured for both the TPF\
    \ and AWD, and then, if the\nSWL reaches 5 cm above the surface, the actuators\
    \ and pumps are switched off.\nSensors 2021, 21, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n16 of 25\

    \ water distribution is performed using earthen\ncanals [50] due to their low\
    \ initial cost. However, these canals result in poor distribu-\ntion efﬁciency,\
    \ less area coverage, and, in the long run, results in high maintenance costs.\n\
    The greatest concern in using earthen canals is the high water loss, which is\
    \ expressed as\nwater conveyance loss (S) [51] and can be calculated using Equation\
    \ (14).\nS = {(Q1 − Q2) ÷ L} × 100\n(14)\nwhere S = the rate of conveyance loss\
    \ in the canal (m3 s−1) per 100 m distance, Q1 = rate of\nﬂow at the inlet (m3\
    \ s−1), Q2 = rate of ﬂow at the outlet (m3 s−1), and L = distance between\ntwo\
    \ points (m).\nThe main factor causing this loss in the earthen canals is due\
    \ to seepage loss. Studies\nhave found that about 40% of the water is lost during\
    \ the distribution time through\nthe earthen canals [50]. The proposed automated\
    \ AWD system using plastic pipes can\novercome this conveyance loss, and help\
    \ reduce the irrigation time, which in turn results\nin less energy (fuel or electricity)\
    \ to operate the pumps. The conveyance loss rate for the\nproposed project derived\
    \ from [51] is shown in Figure 13. It compares the conveyance\nloss between earthen\
    \ canals and plastic piping when water is transported 5000 m from the\nwater source\
    \ to the ﬁeld. Thus, the proposed design saves about 90.91% of water when\ntransporting\
    \ it from the source using plastic piping instead of earthen canals. Furthermore,\n\
    studies conducted by [51] have found that the incorporation of the AWD method\
    \ with\nplastic pipes has saved about 42% of water, and reduced energy consumption\
    \ by 41.2%\ncompared to the traditional method.\nUsing Equations (5) and (7),\
    \ the frequency of irrigations, I1j and I2j, can be used to\ndetermine the total\
    \ energy consumption of the pumps. For instance, to reﬂood a 100-acre\nﬁeld with\
    \ 3 cm of water while maintaining continuous water during TPFj, a single 2000-\n\
    GPM capacity pump with 70% efﬁciency and 12 hp, operating for 18 h, would be sufﬁcient\n\
    as seen in Figure 5a. Then, using Equation (9), average power consumption of the\
    \ pump is\nSensors 2021, 21, 6040\n18 of 23\nfound to be 142.8 KWh. Similarly,\
    \ the average energy consumption can be determined for\nthe AWD method.\n \novercome\
    \ this conveyance loss, and help reduce the irrigation time, which in turn results\
    \ \nin less energy (fuel or electricity) to operate the pumps. The conveyance\
    \ loss rate for the \nproposed project derived from [51] is shown in Figure 13.\
    \ It compares the conveyance \nloss between earthen canals and plastic piping\
    \ when water is transported 5000 m from \nthe water source to the field. Thus,\
    \ the proposed design saves about 90.91% of water \nwhen transporting it from\
    \ the source using plastic piping instead of earthen canals. Fur-\nthermore, studies\
    \ conducted by [51] have found that the incorporation of the AWD \nmethod with\
    \ plastic pipes has saved about 42% of water, and reduced energy consump-\ntion\
    \ by 41.2% compared to the traditional method. \n \nFigure 13. Conveyance loss\

    \ inspection of water levels throughout the irrigation\nseason, pumps may operate\
    \ for more hours than necessary, resulting in the wastage of\nvaluable resources.\
    \ However, in automated systems, pumps are switched off as soon as the\nSensors\
    \ 2021, 21, 6040\n20 of 23\nwater level reaches a certain threshold level, resulting\
    \ in water and energy savings. The\nexperiments presented in [46] showed that\
    \ the automated AWD saved between 13–20% of\nwater, with a 25% decrease in irrigation\
    \ energy cost, and an increase in rice yields by 2–11%\nover manual AWD. The AWD\
    \ automation scheme proposed in this paper is expected\nto reduce irrigation costs\
    \ further since it uses plastic pipes to carry water. Moreover,\nintegration of\
    \ weather forecast data will operate the pumps effectively (e.g., keeping\npumps\
    \ off when the forecast predicts precipitation).\nResearch in [45,46] presented\
    \ automation of the AWD process by using sensors to\nprecisely measure the water\
    \ level precisely. These studies focused on small areas compared\nto that of the\
    \ system described in this paper. For large-scale automation of AWD, multiple\n\
    WSNs need to be designed and implemented. While automated AWD systems offer\n\
    certain advantages over the manual AWD, as described in Table 4, the dimensioning\
    \ of\nthe wide-area automated AWD system may face challenges during implementation.\
    \ The\nplant physiological database for developing countries such as Bangladesh\
    \ is not regularly\nupdated and is not easily accessible. In Bangladesh, where\
    \ farmers are largely not exposed\nto technology, their knowledge and experiences\
    \ about rice and irrigation are not readily\navailable. Moreover, one of the research\
    \ constraints is that the weather forecast information\nis not based on the speciﬁc\
    \ local territory. Rather, it is based on the general meteorological\ninformation\
    \ of the whole region.\n8. Conclusions\nThis paper has presented an approach to\
    \ automating a wide-area AWD system cover-\ning a total irrigation area of 25,000\
    \ acres. Implementation of AWD in such a large irrigation\narea has not been reported\
    \ in the existing literature. It is imperative that such a large system\nuses\
    \ automation instead of the traditional manual operation and monitoring approach.\n\
    The automation can be achieved by integrating three essential and intricate wireless\
    \ sensor\nnetworks (WSN): a mechanical subsystem comprised of pumps, actuator\
    \ networks, and a\nwater distribution network, and an IoT system that runs the\
    \ automation algorithm and\nissues control commands. The data from the WSN, along\
    \ with other operating parame-\nters, are processed at a central server that decides\
    \ whether to activate the pumps and the\nactuator valves. The system is scalable\
    \ and the algorithm can be adjusted for irrigation\nareas with different sizes\
    \ within a practical limit. The required set of equations to support\nthe design\
    \ and operation of the overall system is provided in this paper. The hardware\n\
    for the system is presented and described in order to facilitate the implementation\
    \ of the\nautomation system. The communication protocol and automation algorithm\
    \ have also\nbeen presented in sufﬁcient detail. A sample study on a small-scale\
    \ ﬁeld trial is presented\nas a proof-of-concept to demonstrate the effectiveness\
    \ of the proposed system. An analysis\nof the proposed system’s expected performance\
    \ is discussed by comparing it with manual\nand automated AWD systems in the existing\
    \ literature. The analysis highlights the large\nirrigation area and the complete\
    \ automation aspect of the proposed system.\nDespite numerous advantages, such\
    \ as reduced water consumption, and economic\nand environmental beneﬁts, widespread\
    \ adoption of AWD is yet to be materialized due to\nsocial, economic, and technical\
    \ challenges. This paper demonstrates that, with the adoption\nof existing sensor\
    \ networks and IoT-based technologies, wide area adoption [25] is feasible\nand\
    \ economically viable. The proposed wide-area AWD system allows for continuous\n\
    monitoring and real-time decision making along with a fair distribution of water\
    \ amongst\nthe farmers. The authors are optimistic that, with the adoption of\
    \ the proposed system,\nwide area AWD will be implemented in rice-growing countries.\
    \ These countries will then\nreap the full beneﬁts of the technological advantages\
    \ that AWD has to offer.\nFor future expansion of the proposed system, long-term\
    \ data can be collected and\nanalyzed to improve the system further and to further\
    \ control the greenhouse emissions\nmore effectively. Since the proposed system\
    \ enables the collection of data and creation of a\nlarge database, new models\
    \ can be generated and advanced techniques, including machine\nlearning and big\
    \ data, can be applied for better performance. Furthermore, incorporating\nSensors\
    \ 2021, 21, 6040\n21 of 23\nthe farmer’s valuable input alongside previous data\
    \ and algorithms will make it possible to\naccurately identify the different physiological\
    \ stages of plants during the season, resulting\nin the improved development of\
    \ plants and yields.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, G.M.E.R. and R.M.;\

    This article provides a survey on the adoption of LoRa in the agricultural field
    and reviews state-of-the-art solutions for smart agriculture, analyzing the potential
    of this technology in different infield applications. In particular, we consider
    four reference scenarios, namely, irrigation systems, plantation and crop monitoring,
    tree monitoring, and livestock monitoring, which exhibit heterogeneous requirements
    in terms of network bandwidth, density, sensors’ complexity, and energy demand,
    as well as latency in the decision process. We discuss how LoRa-based solutions
    can work in these scenarios, analyzing their scalability, interoperability, network
    architecture, and energy efficiency. Finally, we present possible future research
    directions and point out some open issues which might become the main research
    trends for the next years. Published in: IEEE Internet of Things Journal ( Volume:

    Robotics, Real time, Intensive production, Information technology Resumo Global
    technological advances can be applied to all production sectors to improve people’s
    daily lives, efficiently deliver information, and product safety. This study is
    a literature review of the use of the Agricultura 4.0 interface in greenhouses
    and the improvements that these technologies have made to the industry. For the
    agricultural sector, especially intensive plant production in protected environments,
    Agricultura 4.0 technologies are widely used to reduce human error and ensure
    high quality plant products. Mathematical modeling, computer software, electronic
    meters, robotics, intelligent real-time system decisions, and automatic activity
    control throughout the production cycle guarantees extreme production safety in
    protected cultivation systems and precision planting environments. The accuracy,
    precision, and performance of Agricultura 4.0 in greenhouses depends, as in others
    agricultural sectors, on improved communication between digital platforms as well
    as in stable Internet for machine programming and operation in the production
    systems. PDF (English) Publicado 2021-01-27 Edição v. 51 n. 0 (2020) Seção Engenharia

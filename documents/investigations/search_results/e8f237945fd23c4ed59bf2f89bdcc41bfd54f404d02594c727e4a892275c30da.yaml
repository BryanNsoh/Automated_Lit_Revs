    \ humankind: food and fiber. The introduction\nof new farming techniques in the\
    \ past century (e.g., during the Green Revolution) has helped agriculture\nkeep\
    \ pace with growing demands for food and other agricultural products. However,\
    \ further increases\nin food demand, a growing population, and rising income levels\
    \ are likely to put additional strain on\nnatural resources. With growing recognition\
    \ of the negative impacts of agriculture on the environment,\nnewtechniquesandapproachesshouldbeabletomeetfuturefooddemandswhilemaintainingorreducing\n\
    the environmental footprint of agriculture. Emerging technologies, such as geospatial\
    \ technologies,\nInternet of Things (IoT), Big Data analysis, and artificial intelligence\
    \ (AI), could be utilized to make\ninformed management decisions aimed to increase\
    \ crop production. Precision agriculture (PA) entails\nthe application of a suite\
    \ of such technologies to optimize agricultural inputs to increase agricultural\n\
    production and reduce input losses. Use of remote sensing technologies for PA\
    \ has increased rapidly\nduring the past few decades. The unprecedented availability\
    \ of high resolution (spatial, spectral and\ntemporal) satellite images has promoted\
    \ the use of remote sensing in many PA applications, including crop\nmonitoring,\
    \ irrigation management, nutrient application, disease and pest management, and\
    \ yield\nprediction. In this paper, we provide an overview of remote sensing systems,\
    \ techniques, and vegetation\nindices along with their recent (2015–2020) applications\
    \ in PA. Remote-sensing-based PA technologies\nsuch as variable fertilizer rate\
    \ application technology in Green Seeker and Crop Circle have already\nbeen incorporated\
    \ in commercial agriculture. Use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has increased\n\
    tremendously during the last decade due to their cost-effectiveness and flexibility\
    \ in obtaining the\nhigh-resolution (cm-scale) images needed for PA applications.\
    \ At the same time, the availability of a\nlarge amount of satellite data has\
    \ prompted researchers to explore advanced data storage and processing\ntechniques\
    \ such as cloud computing and machine learning. Given the complexity of image\
    \ processing\nand the amount of technical knowledge and expertise needed, it is\
    \ critical to explore and develop a simple\nyet reliable workflow for the real-time\
    \ application of remote sensing in PA. Development of accurate yet\neasy to use,\
    \ user-friendly systems is likely to result in broader adoption of remote sensing\
    \ technologies in\ncommercial and non-commercial PA applications.\nKeywords: big\

    \ an engine of economic growth for many nations, provides the most basic needs\n\
    of humankind: food and ﬁber [1,2]. Technological changes during the past century,\
    \ such as the\nGreen Revolution, have transformed the face of agriculture [3].\n\
    The improved crop varieties,\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 3136; doi:10.3390/rs12193136\n\

    \ fertilizers, pesticides, and irrigation during the 1960s–1980s, known as the\
    \ Green Revolution\nor third agricultural revolution, enhanced crop productivity\
    \ and food security, especially in developing\nnations [4]. Consequently, despite\
    \ the doubling population and tripling food demand since the 1960s,\nglobal agriculture\
    \ has been able to meet the demands with only a 30% expansion in the cultivated\n\
    area [4,5]. The demand for food and agricultural products is projected to further\
    \ increase by more\nthan 70% by 2050 [6]. Given the limited availability of arable\
    \ land, a signiﬁcant part of this increased\ndemand will be met through agricultural\
    \ intensiﬁcation, i.e., increased use of fertilizers, pesticides,\nwater, and\
    \ other inputs.\nHowever, intensiﬁed use of agricultural inputs also causes environmental\
    \ degradation,\nincluding groundwater depletion, reduced surface ﬂows, and eutrophication\
    \ [7–11]. Excessive and/or\nineﬃcient use of natural resources (e.g., soil and\
    \ water), fertilizers, and pesticides for agricultural\nproduction cause economic\
    \ losses as well as increased water and nutrient losses from agriculture\nthat\
    \ lead to environmental degradation [12]. For an economically and environmentally\
    \ sustainable\nproduction system, there is a need to develop techniques that can\
    \ increase crop production through\nincreased eﬃciency of inputs use and reduced\
    \ environmental losses [13].\nPrecision agriculture (PA) is a key component of\
    \ sustainable agricultural systems in the 21st\ncentury [13,14]. PA has been deﬁned\
    \ in multiple ways, yet the underlying concept remains the same [15].\nPA entails\
    \ a management strategy that uses a suite of advanced information, communication,\
    \ and data\nanalysis techniques in the decision making process (e.g., application\
    \ of water, fertilizer, pesticide,\nseed, fuel, labor, etc.), which helps enhancing\
    \ crop production and reducing water and nutrient\nlosses and negative environmental\
    \ impacts [16–20]. Information-based management, site-speciﬁc crop\nmanagement,\
    \ target farming, variable rate technology, and grid farming are some other names\n\
    used synonymously for PA [15,21]. In addition to crop production, PA has been\
    \ used in viticulture,\nhorticulture, pasture, and livestock production and management\
    \ [18,22].\nPresently, agriculture can be considered to be going through a fourth\
    \ revolution facilitated mainly\nby advances in information and communication\
    \ technologies [23]. Emerging technologies, such as\nremote sensing, global positioning\
    \ systems (GPS), geographic information systems (GIS), Internet of\nThings (IoT),\
    \ Big Data analysis, and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) are promising tools being\
    \ utilized to\noptimize agricultural operations and inputs aimed to enhance production\
    \ and reduce inputs and\nyield losses [13,24,25]. Several IoT technology systems\
    \ utilizing cloud computing, wireless sensors\nnetworks, and big data analysis\
    \ have been developed for smart farming operations such as automated\nwireless-controlled\
    \ irrigation systems and intelligent disease and pest monitoring and forecasting\n\
    systems [24,25]. AI techniques, including machine learning (e.g., artiﬁcial neural\
    \ networks) have been\nused to estimate ET, soil moisture, and crop predictions\
    \ for automated and precise application of water,\nfertilizer, herbicide, and\
    \ insecticides [23]. These technologies and tools enable farmers to characterize\n\
    spatial variability (e.g., soils) among farms and large crop ﬁelds that negatively\
    \ aﬀect crop growth and\nyields [21]. These state-of-the-art technologies for\
    \ the development and implementation of site-speciﬁc\nmanagement are integral\
    \ part of PA [16].\nRemote sensing systems, using information and communication\
    \ technologies, usually generate a\nlarge volume of spectral data due to high\
    \ spatial/spectral/radiometric/temporal resolutions needed\nfor application in\
    \ PA [26].\nEmerging data processing techniques such as Big Data analysis,\nartiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence, and machine learning have been utilized to draw useful information\
    \ from\nthe large volume of data [27]. Also, cloud computing systems have been\
    \ used to store, process,\nand distribute/utilize such a large amount of data\
    \ for applications in PA [28–30]. All these advanced\ndata acquisitions and processing\
    \ techniques have been applied globally, to aid the decision-making\nprocess for\
    \ ﬁeld crops, horticulture, viticulture, pasture, and livestock [27,31–36].\n\
    In the past, several studies have provided reviews of remote sensing techniques\
    \ and applications\nin agriculture. While some studies focused on speciﬁc application\
    \ areas such as soil properties\nestimation [37], evapotranspiration (ET) estimation\
    \ [38,39], and disease and pest management [40],\nothers included more than one\
    \ area of applications [41–43]. Many of these studies reﬂected the state\nRemote\
    \ Sens. 2020, 12, 3136\n3 of 31\nof the art of remote-sensing-based techniques\
    \ along with their limitations and future challenges for\napplication in agriculture.\
    \ Some of these notable eﬀorts include Mulla et al. [42], Weiss et al. [43],\n\
    Maes and Steppe [44], and Angelopoulou et al. [45]. The primary purpose of this\
    \ review is to complement\nthese eﬀorts to provide a comprehensive background\
    \ and knowledge on applications of remotely\nsensed data and technologies in agriculture,\
    \ focusing on precision agriculture. Speciﬁcally, we provide\nan overview of remote\
    \ sensing systems, techniques, and applications in irrigation management,\nnutrients\
    \ management, disease and pest management, and yield estimation along with a synthesis\n\
    table of vegetation indices used for a variety of applications in PA. The rest\
    \ of this paper is organized\nas follows.\nSection 2 describes the types of remote\
    \ sensing systems covering diﬀerent sensors and platforms\nused for applications\
    \ in PA. Section 3 provides a brief history of applications of remote sensing\
    \ in\nagriculture with a focus on PA. Section 4 discusses some popularly used\
    \ vegetation indices derived\nfrom remote sensing data and their applications\
    \ in PA. Section 5 has ﬁve sub-sections discussing recent\napplications of remote\
    \ sensing in PA for (i) irrigation water management, (ii) nutrient management,\n\
    (iii) disease management, (iv) weed management, and (v) crop monitoring and yield.\
    \ Particularly,\nin Section 5, we focus our review/discussion on studies published\
    \ during 2015–2020. The ﬁnal section\nin the paper discusses the progress made,\
    \ needs, and challenges for applications of remote sensing\nin PA.\n2. Remote\
    \ Sensing Systems Used in Precision Agriculture\nRemote sensing systems used for\
    \ PA, and agriculture in general, can be classiﬁed based on (i) sensor\nplatform\
    \ and (ii) type of sensor. Sensors are typically mounted on satellites, aerial,\
    \ and ground-based\nplatforms (Figure 1). Since the 1970s, satellite products\
    \ have been extensively used for PA. Recently,\naerial platforms, which include\
    \ aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are also used in PA.\nGround-based\
    \ platforms used for PA can be grouped into three categories: (i) hand-held, (ii)\
    \ free\nstanding in the ﬁeld, and (iii) mounted on tractor or farm machinery.\
    \ Ground-based systems are also\nreferred to as proximal remote sensing systems\
    \ because they are located in close proximity to the target\nsurface (land surface\
    \ or plant) as compared to aerial or satellite-based platforms.\nSensors used\
    \ for remote sensing diﬀer based on the spatial, spectral, radiometric, and temporal\n\
    resolution they oﬀer [46]. Spatial resolution of a sensor is deﬁned by the size\
    \ of the pixel that represents\nthe area on the ground. Sensors with high spatial\
    \ resolution tend to have small footprints, and sensors\nwith large footprints\
    \ tend to have a low spatial resolution. Temporal resolution can be considered\
    \ to be\nassociated with the sensor platform rather than the sensor itself. For\
    \ example, temporal resolution for a\nsatellite is the time it takes to complete\
    \ an orbit and revisit the same observation area. Spectral resolution\nof a sensor\
    \ is indicated by the number of bands captured in the given range of electromagnetic\n\
    spectrum [47]. Hyperspectral images contain a large number (10s to 100s) of contagious\
    \ bands of\nnarrow width (<20 nm) separated by small increments in wavelength\
    \ [48]. Numerous vegetation\nindices and statistical and machine learning approaches,\
    \ such as deep convolutional neural network and\nrandom forest, have been applied\
    \ to reduce the dimensionality of hyperspectral data to extract useful\ninformation\
    \ on crop conditions [49–51]. More recently, quantiﬁcation of solar-induced chlorophyll\n\
    ﬂuorescence (SIF) from hyperspectral images has increasingly been applied to estimate\
    \ photosynthesis,\nplant nutrients, and biotic and abiotic stresses such as disease\
    \ and water stress [49–54].\nAlthough numerous recent satellites provide high\
    \ spatial (<5 m) and temporal (daily) resolution\nimages, most publicly available\
    \ satellite products are rather coarse for many PA applications.\nAppropriate\
    \ spatio-temporal resolution required for PA depends on several factors including\n\
    management objectives, size of the ﬁeld, and the ability of farm equipment to\
    \ vary the inputs\n(irrigation, fertilizer, pesticide, etc.) application rates.\
    \ Crop biomass and yield estimation typically\nrequire higher spatial resolution\
    \ (1–3 m) compared to variable rate fertilizer and irrigation (5–10 m)\napplications\
    \ [42]. Furthermore, weed mapping and variable herbicide application require spatial\n\
    resolution that is ﬁner than the weed patches (e.g., 5–50 cm) [55,56]. Aerial\
    \ platforms such as UAVs\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 3136\n4 of 31\ngenerally provide\
    \ higher spatial resolution (<5 m) images as compared to the satellites. Thus,\
    \ UAVs and\nother ground-based platforms oﬀer greater ﬂexibility in providing\
    \ images at ﬁne spatial and temporal\nresolution (more frequent) or as needed.\n\

    UAV = Unmanned Aerial Vehicle; EM = Electromagnetic. (UAV photo credit—Dr. Ripendra\
    \ Awal,\nPVAMU, Prairie View, TX, USA).\nSensors mounted on satellites, airplanes,\
    \ and UAVs are generally passive sensors, i.e., they do\nnot have their own light\
    \ source. However, some of the satellites have active sensors onboard, such as\n\
    the active microwave instrument (AMI) on the ERS-1/2. Many of the ground-based\
    \ remote sensing\nplatforms have active proximity sensors. For example, commercially\
    \ available variable fertilizer rate\napplication systems such as Green Seeker\
    \ and Crop Circle have active proximity sensors. In such\nsystems, variations\
    \ in daylight have minimum eﬀect on measured reﬂectance, thus providing more\n\
    accurate and reproducible normalized diﬀerence vegetation index (NDVI) or other\
    \ vegetation indices\n(VI) used for crop nutrient status assessment.\nTwo other\
    \ sensors (thermal infrared and microwave) mounted on recent satellites are increasingly\n\
    being used in agriculture. Thermal infrared sensors measure energy emitted from\
    \ a target (e.g., crops)\nto estimate its temperature, which could be further\
    \ used to estimate crop water stress, ET, and irrigation\nrequirements [57]. Microwave\
    \ sensors work in a similar way as the thermal sensors to measure the\nemitted\
    \ energy (although in longer microwave wavelengths) from the land surface. Microwave\
    \ sensors\nare mainly used to estimate soil moisture contents and crop water use\
    \ over large areas [58]. Also,\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 3136\n5 of 31\nmicrowaves\
    \ can penetrate through clouds, which is advantageous over other types of sensors\
    \ that use\nvisible and NIR wavelengths.\nHowever, coarse spatial resolution (10s\
    \ of km) of the microwave satellite sensors, especially passive\nsensors, limits\
    \ their application in PA. Recently, many methods have been developed and used\
    \ to\ndownscale passive microwave data to a ﬁner resolution for use in PA [59–62].\
    \ Active microwave\nsensors (e.g., synthetic aperture radar—SAR) generally oﬀer\
    \ a higher spatial resolution; however,\nthey are also more sensitive to surface\
    \ roughness (e.g., vegetation) that can introduce errors in soil\nmoisture estimation.\
    \ Overall, there are a variety of remote sensors and platforms available that\
    \ can\nbe used to generate high-resolution (spatial, spectral, radiometric, and\
    \ temporal) images critical to\ndevelop and implement site-speciﬁc management.\n\
    3. Historical Applications of Remote Sensing in Agriculture\nResearchers have\
    \ long recognized the need to map soil and land use databases for sustainable\n\
    management of natural resources at local, regional, and national scale [63,64].\
    \ Knowledge of soil\nphysical, biological, and chemical properties is important\
    \ to design and implement irrigation, drainage,\nnutrient, and other crop management\
    \ strategies, which are essential components of PA. Similarly,\nland use mapping\
    \ can help assess the impacts of existing management and policy at regional to\n\
    national scale. A traditional approach of using remote sensing techniques in agriculture\
    \ has been\naround even before 1958, when the term “remote sensing” was ﬁrst introduced\
    \ [65]. For example,\naerial photography has been used to map soils, land use,\
    \ and crop conditions in the United States\nduring the 1930 and 1940s [66]. However,\
    \ these conventional methods of soil mapping and land use\nclassiﬁcation (e.g.,\
    \ low altitude photography and ground crews) typically involve extensive ﬁeldwork\n\
    and laboratory analysis, which are expensive and time-consuming [67,68]. Advent\
    \ of satellite remote\nsensing during later years facilitated more eﬃcient and\
    \ eﬀective mapping of land use and land cover\nat regional, national, and global\
    \ scales.\nLaunch of Vanguard 2 and TIROS 1 in 1959 and 1960, respectively, marked\
    \ the start of satellite\nremote sensing for meteorological information [69].\
    \ However, the era of satellite remote sensing for\nagriculture started with the\
    \ launch of Landsat 1 (formerly known as the Earth Resources Technology\nSatellite—ERTS)\
    \ on 23 July 1972 by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).\n\
    NASA and the US Department of the Interior through the US Geological Survey (USGS)\
    \ jointly\nmanage the Landsat program. After Landsat 1, a series of Landsat satellites\
    \ (Landsat 2–8) were\nlaunched to provide high quality images to researchers,\
    \ land managers, and policy makers to help\nin the management of natural resources\
    \ globally (Table 1). Images acquired from Landsat have been\nused for land use\
    \ classiﬁcation, crop classiﬁcation, and monitoring and irrigation water requirement\n\
    estimations in many parts of the world [70–75]. Later, in 1984, the Landsat 5\
    \ Thematic Mapper was\nlaunched to collect higher resolution (30 m) images in\
    \ more bands in visible and NIR region. Currently,\nthe USGS-NASA is planning\
    \ to launch Landsat 9 (resolution 30 m, 100 m) by mid-2021. In 1986 and\n1988,\
    \ France and India also launched the SPOT 1 and IRS-1A satellites, respectively\
    \ (Table 1).\nTable 1.\nSpatiotemporal resolutions of the satellite sensors used\
    \ for precision agricultural (PA)\napplications. Satellites that provide high\
    \ spatial (<30 m) and temporal resolutions (e.g., daily) are more\nsuitable for\

    \ these missions were used for land use and crop classiﬁcation in many large\n\
    regions of the world. In addition, satellite products are used to monitor soil\
    \ health, vegetation health,\nand hydrologic and climatic parameters, which are\
    \ important for PA (e.g., soil organic carbon,\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 3136\n\

    \ Use of the satellite images\nproved to be cost-eﬀective compared to aerial photography\
    \ previously used for land use classiﬁcation\nover large regions. However, coarse\
    \ spatiotemporal resolution satellite products are not quite adequate\nfor many\
    \ PA applications.\nSatellites adequate for PA, such as IKONOS, were launched\
    \ in the late 1990s. IKONOS, launched in\n1999, collected imageries at 4-m spatial\
    \ resolution in visible and NIR bands with a revisit period\nof up to ﬁve days\
    \ [42]. Imageries collected from IKONOS have been used for multiple purposes\n\
    in PA, including soil mapping, crop growth and yield prediction, nutrient management,\
    \ and ET\nestimation [77,85–87]. Launching of numerous nanosatellite constellations\
    \ during later years addressed\nfurther limitations associated with spatial, spectral,\
    \ and temporal resolution of the satellite imagery [110].\nNanosatellite constellations\
    \ consist of a large number of small satellites with compact sensors that are\n\
    cheaper and replaceable [91].\nNanosatellites and other satellites launched after\
    \ 2000, such as GeoEye-1 (2008), Pleiades-1A\n(2011), Worldview-3 (2014), SkySat-2\
    \ (2014), and Superview-1 (2018), collect multispectral images at a\nhigh spatial\
    \ resolution of ≤2 m with a daily or sub-daily revisit period. Pleiades-1A and\
    \ Worldview-3\nhave been used for many PA applications requiring high spatial\
    \ resolution imagery, including disease\nand crop water stress detection [118–120].\
    \ To take advantage of a wide variety of publicly available\nsatellite data, several\
    \ data fusion approaches have been proposed to combine high/moderate spatial\n\
    resolution data with high temporal resolution data (and vice-versa) to generate\
    \ high spatial–temporal\nresolution data products [121,122]. Satellite data with\
    \ moderate spatial resolution but high temporal\nresolution (e.g., Sentinel 2)\
    \ can also be used with reference ground truth data to help develop PA\ndecision\
    \ support systems [112].\nDespite signiﬁcant advances in spatial, spectral, and\
    \ temporal resolution of satellite sensors,\nthe use of satellite images is still\
    \ limited in commercial agriculture production. Limited ﬂexibility in\non-demand\
    \ imaging solutions, high costs, cloud cover restriction, and lack of automated\
    \ or established\nframeworks for image analysis and application are factors aﬀecting\
    \ large-scale adoption of satellite\nimageries in PA [123]. These limitations\
    \ have promoted interest in low-cost proximal remote sensing\ntechniques, including\
    \ UAVs.\nUse of UAVs and hand-held, tractor-mounted, and other sensors\nmounted\
    \ on farm machinery (e.g., spray boom, fertilizer applicator) has increased tremendously\n\
    during the last two decades. UAVs with multispectral, hyperspectral, and thermal\
    \ sensors can provide\non-demand information at a spatial scale necessary for\
    \ PA operations. Getting continuous or frequent\nsatellite scanning during a crop\
    \ growing season can be problematic due to cloud cover and/or other\nlimitations/uncertainties\
    \ associated with the sensor platform (e.g., revisit period) [124]. However,\n\
    UAVs can be ﬂown multiple times during a growing season to acquire information\
    \ on a cm-scale as\nrequired. Most satellites do not oﬀer the data at cm-scale\
    \ needed for many ﬁeld-scale PA applications\nsuch as weed mapping and disease\
    \ detection [125,126].\nUnprecedented availability of low-cost UAVs is likely\
    \ to change the face of PA in the future.\nThe average size of a farm in the United\
    \ States was 179 ha in 2018 [127] and is even smaller in other\ncountries [126].\
    \ Acquiring high spatial resolution images obtained from commercial satellites\
    \ can be\nexpensive, especially for small farms, as many of these images are not\
    \ available for free. In addition,\nﬂying airplanes to obtain such images may\
    \ be cost-prohibitive for small farms. Images acquired from\nUAVs oﬀer a low cost\
    \ alternative to expensive airplane and satellite products [126]. Although the\
    \ cost\nof utilizing UAVs (including equipment cost, data processing, and software)\
    \ at a commercial scale is\nlikely to be a sizable investment for limited resources\
    \ farmers, continuous development of low-cost\nsensor technologies and input-production\
    \ cost savings and/or beneﬁts are likely to outweigh these\ncosts in the future\
    \ [128,129]. Growth in the development and use of UAVs has enabled the acquisition\n\
    of high spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution data needed to implement PA\
    \ management at a crop\nﬁeld or farm scale. Multispectral, high spatial resolution\
    \ data acquired with UAVs could also be used\nwith available satellite data for\
    \ scale-up applications over large areas [130].\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 3136\n\
    8 of 31\n4. Vegetation Indices\nSolar radiation reﬂected by plants depends on\
    \ the chemical and morphological characteristics of\nthe plant. Plant type, water\
    \ content, and canopy characteristics aﬀect the light reﬂected in each spectral\n\
    band diﬀerently. Measured reﬂected light in ultraviolet, visible (blue, green,\
    \ red), and near- and\nmid-infrared portions of the spectrum has commonly been\
    \ used to develop various vegetation indices\nthat provide useful information\
    \ on plant structure and conditions [131] (Table 2). Vegetation indices\nare mathematical\
    \ expressions that combine measured reﬂectance in many spectral bands to produce\
    \ a\nvalue that helps assess crop growth, vigor, and several other vegetation\
    \ properties such as biomass and\nchlorophyll content [132]. Mapping of these\
    \ indices can help understand spatio-temporal variability in\ncrop conditions,\
    \ which is crucial for PA applications.\nPopularly used vegetation indices such\
    \ as normalized diﬀerence vegetation index (NDVI),\ngreen NDVI (GNDVI), and soil\
    \ adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) (Table 2) utilize the fact that within the\n\
    visible range of spectrum, plant reﬂectance is low in blue and red regions, while\
    \ it peaks in the green\nregion (Figure 2). Plant pigments, mainly chlorophyll\
    \ and carotenoids, adsorb strongly in the visible\npart of the spectrum except\
    \ for the green region. However, such strong adsorption does not occur\nin the\
    \ NIR part of the spectrum, thus causing high reﬂectance in NIR region from green\
    \ and healthy\nplants (Figure 2). The NDVI uses measured reﬂectance values in\
    \ red and NIR regions to provide\nvaluable information on crop growth (LAI, biomass),\
    \ vigor, and photosynthesis (Table 2). The value\nof NDVI ranges from −1 to 1,\
    \ where positive values indicate increasing greenness (LAI and vigor),\nand negative\
    \ values indicate non-vegetated surfaces such as urban areas, bare soil/land,\
    \ water, and ice.\nExternal factors to the vegetation conditions such as solar\
    \ and viewing geometry, soil and crop residue\non the land surface, and atmospheric\
    \ eﬀects may cause interferences in spectral signals [133]. NDVI is\nsensitive\
    \ to confounding eﬀects caused due to soils, atmosphere, cloud, and leaf canopy\
    \ shadow\nthat may result in erroneous information on crop or plant conditions\
    \ [134,135]. In addition, NDVI is\nalso known to be insensitive to changes in\
    \ LAI and biomass after reaching a threshold (saturation),\nespecially in dense\
    \ vegetative conditions [136,137]. A large number of alternative indices have\
    \ been\ndeveloped to address these shortcomings in NDVI [135,138,139]. Some of\
    \ the indices that address\nthese limitations are the soil adjusted vegetation\
    \ index (SAVI), atmospherically resistant vegetation\nindex (ARVI), and wide dynamic\
    \ range vegetation index (WDRVI). Red edge based vegetation indices\nsuch as red-edge\
    \ NDVI (RNDVI), normalized diﬀerence red edge (NDRE), and red edge diﬀerence\n\
    vegetation index (REDVI) have been shown to perform better than NDVI in estimating\
    \ plant nutrient\nstatus, LAI, and biomass in dense vegetation conditions such\
    \ as those present during the later growth\nstages of corn [139–142].\nRemote\

    \ indices, it is not meant to be a comprehensive list as\nthere are many more\
    \ indices that have been used in PA applications.\nMeasurement of reﬂectance or\
    \ emissivity in near- and mid-infrared bands is particularly useful\nin developing\
    \ indices that help to understand several intrinsic plant characteristics such\
    \ as water\ncontent, pigments, sugar, carbohydrate, and protein contents [131].\
    \ Reﬂected or emitted radiation in\nthermal infrared bands is directly related\
    \ to the plant temperature. Since plant temperature is related\nto plant transpiration\
    \ rate, indices obtained from thermal/infrared reﬂectance data can be used to\n\
    understand plant water status and other biotic and abiotic stresses such as disease\
    \ [178,179]. In the past,\nmany indices have been developed based on infrared\
    \ and thermal reﬂectance or emission such as crop\nwater stress index (CWSI) and\
    \ shortwave infrared water stress index (SIWSI; Table 2). These indices\nhave\
    \ been used for a variety of applications in PA, including water stress and drought\
    \ monitoring,\nsoil moisture, plant disease, and crop yield estimations [57] (Table\
    \ 2).\n5. Applications\n5.1. Irrigation Water Management\nApplication time and\
    \ rate of irrigation play an important role in mitigating crop water stress\n\
    and achieving optimum crop growth and yield. A variety of irrigation management\
    \ practices are\nused by farmers depending on many factors including water availability,\
    \ existing water management\ninfrastructure at the farm (e.g., storage and conveyance\
    \ system, type of irrigation system), local/regional\nwater laws, economic status,\
    \ size of the farm, knowledge of farmer, and others [180,181].\nMany farmers apply\
    \ uniform irrigation at regular intervals based on their prior knowledge or\n\
    experience of farming, soils, and climate at the location [182]. Large commercial\
    \ farmers deploy soil\nmoisture monitoring systems (wired or wireless moisture\
    \ sensors) to irrigate (automatically or manually\noperation mode) based on the\
    \ measured soil moisture data and crop/plant water requirements [183,184].\nLocal\
    \ and regional agricultural agencies may provide irrigation advisory services\
    \ based on the observed\nclimate and weather conditions in the area [185,186].\n\
    Almost all of these conventional farming practices do not consider the variability\
    \ within a ﬁeld and\nuse a uniform irrigation rate for the entire ﬁeld. Remote\
    \ sensing data can help discern the variability\nwithin the ﬁeld and apply variable\
    \ rate irrigation with commonly used irrigation systems such as a\ncenter pivot.\
    \ Variable rate application can help mitigate water stress arising from extreme\
    \ wet and dry\nconditions to achieve uniformly high yields in all parts in the\
    \ ﬁeld while reducing water and nutrient\nlosses [187,188]. Remote sensing images,\
    \ collected multiple times during a growing season, are used to\ndetermine various\
    \ indicators of crop water demand such as ET, soil moisture, and crop water stress.\n\
    These indicators are used to estimate crop water requirement and schedule irrigation\
    \ precisely.\n5.1.1. Water Stress\nRemote sensing products, either in optical,\
    \ thermal, and microwave bands, have been used to\ndevelop and test multiple indices\
    \ and techniques for precision water management [189] (Table 2).\nRemote Sens.\
    \ 2020, 12, 3136\n11 of 31\nFor example, normalized diﬀerence vegetation index\
    \ (NDVI) and soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI),\ndeveloped from optical images,\
    \ can be used to diagnose water stress and soil moisture conditions for\nmany\
    \ crops (Table 2). As shown in Table 2, these indices, combined with forecasted\
    \ weather data,\ncould be used for irrigation scheduling. Thermal remote sensing–based\
    \ crop water stress index (CWSI)\nis a popular indicator used to estimate irrigation\
    \ water demand and scheduling [57].\nCWSI =\n(Tc − Ta) − (Tc − Ta)LL\n(Tc − Ta)UL\
    \ − (Tc − Ta)LL\nwhere Tc is the canopy temperature extracted from thermal images,\
    \ and Ta is the air temperature. LL and\nUL indicate the upper and lower limit\
    \ of the diﬀerence in canopy and air temperature. Conceptually,\nthe lower limit\
    \ (LL) corresponds to the condition when the canopy is transpiring at the potential\
    \ rate,\nand the upper limit (UL) corresponds to the condition when transpiration\
    \ from the canopy is ceased.\nMultiple methods have been used to calculate the\
    \ UL and LL of diﬀerence in canopy and air temperature,\neach having their own\
    \ set of strengths and weaknesses [57]. CWSI has been extensively used for\nprecision\
    \ irrigation management in orchards [44,190]. For example, Katsigiannis et al.\
    \ [123] used an\nautonomous multi-sensor (multi-spectral and thermal sensor) UAV\
    \ system to develop CWSIs maps for\nirrigation scheduling and management in kiwi,\
    \ pomegranate, and vine ﬁelds. However, some studies\nhave indicated that more\
    \ research is needed to establish climate-soil-crop speciﬁc trigger/threshold\n\
    values to enable the use of CWSI for irrigation scheduling [191].\n5.1.2. Evapotranspiration\
    \ (ET)\nEvapotranspiration (ET), the largest water ﬂux from the Earth’s surface\
    \ to the atmosphere, is a\ncritical component of the hydrologic cycle and water\
    \ balance. Conventional methods of ET measurement\n(e.g., weighing lysimeter and\
    \ eddy covariance) are generally expensive and do not provide spatially\nvariable\
    \ ET estimates resulting from diﬀerences in land use, soils, topography and other\
    \ hydrologic\nprocesses [192,193]. Remote sensing data is widely used to estimate\
    \ ET, which is needed to determine\ncrop water requirements to schedule irrigation\
    \ [193–195]. ET estimation approaches, based on the\nremote sensing data, can\
    \ be grouped into three categories: (i) surface energy balance, (ii) crop\ncoeﬃcient,\
    \ and (iii) the Penman–Monteith method [193,194,196]. Many studies in the past\
    \ have\nprovided a review of remote-sensing-based ET estimation techniques [39,192,197],\
    \ including a recent\nreview from Zhang et al. [198] that discussed the theories\
    \ of development of several ET estimation\napproaches/methods along with their\
    \ advantages and limitations. The surface energy balance approach\nhas been extensively\
    \ used for ET estimation in the past ﬁve years. Some of the studies have used\n\
    hybrid methods to combine crop coeﬃcient and energy balance approaches for ET\
    \ estimation [195].\nIn a surface energy balance approach, net radiation ﬂux (Rn),\
    \ soil heat ﬂux (G), and sensible heat ﬂux\n(H) are typically calculated from\
    \ remotely sensed data in visible, near-infrared and thermal infrared\nbands,\
    \ while the latent heat ﬂux (λET) is calculated as a reminder of the term in the\
    \ energy balance\nequation [195,196].\nλET = Rn − G − H\nRecently, Liou and Kar\
    \ [192] and McShane et al. [197] provided a detailed review of various\nsurface\
    \ energy balance algorithms used for estimating landscape-scale ET at high spatial\
    \ resolution\nand discussed their physical basis, assumptions, uncertainties,\
    \ and limitations. Surface energy balance\ntechniques use a variety of empirical\
    \ and physically based models, input data, and assumptions to\nfully or partially\
    \ solve the energy balance equation for ET estimation. Popularly used methods\
    \ such as\nsurface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL) and mapping ET at\
    \ high resolution with internalized\ncalibration (METRIC) fully solve the energy\
    \ balance equation by determining the sensible heat ﬂux (H)\nbased on the identiﬁcation\
    \ of dry and wet pixels in the image [199]. Empirical constants derived from\n\
    dry and wet pixels and measured radiometric surface temperature are then used\
    \ to determine pixel-wise\nsurface-air temperature diﬀerence and sensible heat-ﬂux.\
    \ In METRIC, a variant of SEBAL, net radiation\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 3136\n\
    12 of 31\nis calculated using measured narrowband reﬂectance and radiometric surface\
    \ temperature data,\nwhile soil heat ﬂux is estimated using net radiation, surface\
    \ temperature and vegetation indices [197].\nMost of the surface energy balance\
    \ methods typically use similar methods to calculate net radiation\nand soil heat\
    \ ﬂux; the major diﬀerence lies in the way sensible heat ﬂux is calculated [200].\
    \ The primary\ndiﬀerence between METRIC and SEBAL is that the METRIC method uses\
    \ reference ET data calculated\nfrom ground-based weather data to calibrate sensible\
    \ heat and ET estimations obtained from the\nsurface energy balance [199]. Surface\
    \ energy balance methods are also classiﬁed based on the sensible\nheat sources;\
    \ two-source energy balance methods account for the individual contributions of\
    \ soil\nand vegetation to the total heat ﬂux, while one-source methods do not\
    \ distinguish between soil\nand vegetation [195]. Simpler surface energy balance\
    \ methods, such as simpliﬁed surface energy\nbalance index (S-SEBI) and the operational\
    \ simpliﬁed energy balance model (SSEBop) does not require\npixel-wise calculation\
    \ of sensible heat ﬂux and can thus be considered as partial surface energy balance\n\
    models [199]. Recently, several studies have evaluated these energy balance approaches\
    \ with satellite\ndata (e.g., Landsat 7 and 8) to estimate ET for irrigation management\
    \ in PA [201–203]. However,\ncoarse spatio-temporal resolution of thermal satellite\
    \ data limits the application of surface energy\nbalance approaches in PA. More\
    \ studies are needed to develop and evaluate downscaling techniques\nthat can\
    \ provide ET estimates at a spatio-temporal resolution necessary for irrigation\
    \ scheduling in PA.\nCrop coeﬃcient based approach for ET estimation involves\
    \ developing a statistical relationship\nbetween a vegetation index (e.g., NDVI,\
    \ SAVI) and basal crop coeﬃcient (or crop coeﬃcient). A product\n(ETref*Kc) of\
    \ reference ET (ETref), estimated from weather data, and crop coeﬃcient (Kc) provides\
    \ an\nestimation of potential crop water requirements which can be used in a water\
    \ balance model to determine\nirrigation water requirements [122,204–207]. In\
    \ the third approach, crop biophysical parameters such as\nLAI, canopy height,\
    \ and albedo, estimated from remotely sensed data, are used to determine unknown\n\
    parameters in Penman-Monteith equation [196,208] for ET estimation. Calculated\
    \ ET from these\napproaches is generally used in a soil water balance model to\
    \ estimate crop irrigation requirements.\nBhatti et al. [205] used Landsat 7 and\
    \ 8 and UAV data to estimate crop coeﬃcient based ET and\nvariable rate irrigation\
    \ (VRI) requirements for corn and soybean grown in Nebraska, USA. Similarly,\n\
    Stone et al. [209] demonstrated that variable rate irrigation scheduling based\
    \ on the NDVI derived\ncrop coeﬃcient and ET can provide corn yields similar to\
    \ the other precision irrigation techniques\nrelying on measured in-situ soil\
    \ moisture data. Using crop parameters (LAI and albedo) derived\nfrom Sentinel\
    \ 2A/B images, Bonfante et al. [210] calculated Penman–Monteith ET and time-variable\n\
    irrigation requirements to demonstrate the application of a publicly available\
    \ decision support system\nfor maximizing corn yields in Italy.\nA large number\
    \ of approaches exist for ET estimation based on the remote sensing data, each\
    \ having\nits own set of advantages and limitations. Some surface energy balance\
    \ approaches such as S-SEBI\ndo not require any ground-based measurements, and\
    \ thus, ET can be estimated solely based on\nthe remote sensing data [192]. However,\
    \ surface energy balance approaches work for only clear\nsky conditions and suﬀer\
    \ from various uncertainties related to the retrieval/estimation of surface\n\
    temperature, solar parameters, land surface variables (e.g., LAI, vegetation coverage,\
    \ plant height) and\nother parameters due to uncertainties in surface emissivity,\
    \ atmospheric corrections, diurnal variation\nand aerodynamic surface characteristics\
    \ [192,198]. In addition, ET estimates derived by solving the\nsurface energy\
    \ balance equations are instantaneous and require temporal extrapolation to generate\
    \ daily\nor larger time step estimates using further assumptions and methods [198].\
    \ The Penman–Monteith\napproach, which uses a process-based model, can provide\
    \ temporally continuous ET estimations.\nHowever, it requires several meteorological\
    \ parameters that are not easily available at the needed\nspatio-temporal resolution.\n\
    Studies have shown that surface energy balance methods such as\nMETRIC and SSEBop\
    \ provide reasonably accurate (80–95% accuracy) ET estimations on daily to\nseasonal/annual\
    \ scales [197]. Generally, ET estimation error of less than 1 mm/day can be considered\
    \ to\nbe reasonable [211]. However, it also depends on the crop and growth stage;\
    \ higher accuracies (mm/day)\nare desirable during initial crop growth stages\
    \ when ET is lower. However, the accuracy of many of\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 3136\n\
    13 of 31\nthese models (e.g., SEBAL) varies greatly from one spatial and temporal\
    \ scale to another, making it\ndiﬃcult to quantify the uncertainty in ET estimation\
    \ [194]. In order to advance the development of\nremote sensing based ET estimation\
    \ approaches, further studies are needed to identify and characterize\nthe spatio-temporal\
    \ structure of uncertainties in the ET estimation due to forcing errors, process\
    \ errors,\nand parametrization errors, among others [198]. Advanced approaches\
    \ that use the knowledge\ndeveloped from process-based physical models to complement\
    \ the machine learning based surface\nenergy balance methods need to be explored\
    \ to develop more accurate and reliable ET estimates at a\nscale necessary for\
    \ PA management [212].\n5.1.3. Soil Moisture\nRemote sensing data acquired in\
    \ multiple bands, including optical, thermal, and microwave,\nhave been used to\
    \ estimate soil moisture globally [28,193,213]. Optical and thermal remote sensing\
    \ data\nhas been extensively used for soil moisture and ET estimations in an approach\
    \ referred to as “triangle” or\n“trapezoid” or land surface temperature-vegetation\
    \ index (LST-VI) method [198,214–216]. The triangle\nor LST-VI method is based\
    \ on the physical relationship between the land surface temperature (and thus\n\
    soil moisture and latent heat ﬂuxes) and vegetative cover characteristics. Soil\
    \ moisture estimation\nin this method is based on the interpretation of the pixel\
    \ distribution in the LST-VI plot-space. If a\nsuﬃciently large number of pixels\
    \ are present in an image covering a full range of soil moisture and\nvegetation\
    \ density and when cloud, surface water, and other outliers are removed, the LST-VI\
    \ space\nresembles a triangle or trapezoid [214]. One edge of the LST-VI triangle\
    \ or trapezoid falling toward\nhigher temperatures represent dry edge (low soil\
    \ moisture), while the opposite side represents the wet\nedge (high soil moisture)\
    \ [217]. Triangular or trapezoidal shape of the LST-VI space is formed due to\n\
    the low sensitivity of LST to soil moisture under dense vegetative conditions,\
    \ which is contrary to the\nhigh sensitivity of LST to soil moisture under bare\
    \ soil or sparse vegetation conditions. Once upper\nand lower limit moisture content\
    \ for wet and dry edges is determined, theoretically, soil moisture\nfor remaining\
    \ pixels can be estimated using interpolation techniques. The triangle method\
    \ uses a\nsimple parametrization approach and does not require ancillary atmospheric\
    \ or surface data for soil\nmoisture estimation [214,218]. However, a subjective\
    \ determination of wet and dry edges in the triangle\nmethod can introduce signiﬁcant\
    \ uncertainties in soil moisture estimation especially over relatively\nhomogenous\
    \ land-surface areas (e.g., rainfed agriculture during dry season) and after rainfall\
    \ events\nwhen there is a general lack of variability in soil moisture to form\
    \ an LST-VI triangle [215]. In addition,\nthe traditional triangle method requires\
    \ individual parametrization for each observation date, which is\na time-consuming\
    \ and computationally demanding process [60]. The traditional triangle method\
    \ also\nneeds both optical and thermal data that may not be available in certain\
    \ instances (e.g., Sentinel-2).\nRecently, a newer generation of triangular models\
    \ has been developed and tested for high\nspatial resolution mapping of soil moisture\
    \ in PA applications [59,60].\nOne such technique,\ncalled the optical trapezoid\
    \ model (OPTRAM), replaces the LST in the traditional triangle model\nwith short-wave-infra-red\
    \ transformed reﬂectance (STR). Analogous to the traditional triangle model,\n\
    soil moisture in OPTRAM is estimated based on the interpretation of STR-VI space\
    \ [60]. Using Sentinel-2\nand Landsat-8 data, Sadeghi et al. [53] showed reasonably\
    \ accurate (<0.04 cm3/cm3) soil moisture\nestimations with OPTRAM model for grass\
    \ and cropland dominated watersheds in Arizona and\nOklahoma, USA. The OPTRAM\
    \ model does not require thermal remote sensing data, thus making\nit more suitable\
    \ for a wide range of remote sensing data. Unlike LST, surface reﬂectance (STR)\
    \ is a\nfunction of surface properties and does not vary signiﬁcantly with ambient\
    \ atmospheric conditions,\nwhich eliminates the need to parametrize/calibrate\
    \ the model for individual dates [216]. However,\ncompared to the traditional\
    \ triangle model, the OPTRAM model is more sensitive to saturated land\nareas,\
    \ which may result in increased uncertainty in soil moisture estimates [60]. More\
    \ studies are\nneeded to further evaluate these newer models for their applicability\
    \ in a diverse range of climatic,\nhydrologic, and environmental conditions.\n\
    Remote Sens. 2020, 12, 3136\n14 of 31\nCompared to the data acquired in visible,\
    \ NIR, and SWIR bands, microwave remote sensing data\nhave a greater potential\
    \ to provide accurate soil moisture estimations [216]. Signals in visible and\
    \ NIR\nregions have weaker penetration ability, compared to microwave, and is\
    \ more likely to get aﬀected\nby interferences caused due to atmospheric and cloud\
    \ conditions [135]. Microwave sensors measure\ndielectric properties of soil based\
    \ on land surface emissivity or scattering for soil moisture estimation.\nSeveral\
    \ satellites with active and passive microwave sensors have been launched for\
    \ soil moisture\nmonitoring such as the advanced microwave scanning radiometer-earth\
    \ observing system (AMSR-E),\nsoil moisture and ocean salinity (SMOS), soil moisture\
    \ active passive (SMAP), and Sentinel-1 [216].\nActive microwave sensors provide\
    \ higher spatial resolution as compared to the passive sensors.\nHowever, active\
    \ sensors also suﬀer from measurement uncertainties caused due to land surface\n\
    roughness and vegetative cover or canopy [219]. On the other hand, although passive\
    \ sensors are\nmore accurate and provide better temporal resolution, they also\
    \ provide a coarser spatial resolution\n(e.g., 10s of km) [215]. Typically, watershed\
    \ and regional scale hydrologic and agricultural applications,\nespecially PA,\
    \ require ﬁner resolution data [220].\nSeveral spatial downscaling techniques\
    \ have been developed and used in the past to address\nthe coarse spatial resolution\
    \ limitation of passive microwave sensors. These techniques can be\nbroadly categorized\
    \ into two main groups: (i) satellite-based methods and (ii) modeling methods\
    \ [221].\nTypically, satellite-based methods use vegetation, surface temperature,\
    \ and other geophysical and\nenvironmental information obtained from high spatial\
    \ resolution satellite data (in optical and thermal\nbands) to downscale coarse\
    \ resolution soil moisture data [61,62].\nMachine learning and data mining techniques\
    \ have been used with topography, land surface\ntemperature, albedo, land cover,\
    \ NDVI, and ET obtained from high spatial resolution satellite\ndata to downscale\
    \ coarse resolution soil moisture data from passive microwave sensors [135,222].\n\
    Higher resolution (1 km) land surface temperature and vegetation data derived\
    \ from moderate\nresolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) have popularly been\
    \ used in many studies to downscale\ncoarse resolution soil moisture data [135,223,224].\
    \ Many others have used higher spatial resolution\nbackscatter data from active\
    \ microwave sensors to disaggregate and downscale brightness and\nsoil moisture\
    \ data from passive sensors [225].\nSome studies have used a combination of SAR\n\
    (Sentinel 1/2) and optical remote sensing data with machine learning techniques\
    \ to downscale\npassive microwave (e.g., SMAP) data [226,227]. Modeling-based\
    \ methods use high spatial resolution\ndata derived from physically-based and\
    \ statistical models with data assimilation approaches to\ndownscale coarse-resolution\
    \ soil moisture data [221,228]. Despite the development of these downscaling\n\
    techniques, spatio-temporal resolution of soil moisture estimates generated from\
    \ microwave data is still\ncoarse and/or lacks the accuracy needed for PA, limiting\
    \ their application for irrigation scheduling in\nPA. Recent launches of multi-polarization\
    \ sensors (e.g., Radarsat-2) along with the development of new\npolarization parameters\
    \ and polarization decomposition methods can potentially help generating soil\n\
    moisture and crop information at higher spatial resolution [229]. Multi-polarization\
    \ SAR data can be\ncombined with optical satellite data to generate soil moisture\
    \ estimates at high spatial resolution [230].\nFurther eﬀorts are needed to develop\
    \ advanced downscaling techniques that can combine data from\nmultiple sources\
    \ (e.g., optical and microwave remote sensing, biophysical and hydrologic models)\n\
    and provide temporally continuous (e.g., daily) soil moisture estimates at the\
    \ ﬁner spatial resolution\nnecessary for PA [221]. Overall, in addition to satellites,\
    \ high spatial resolution data acquired from\nUAVs in optical, thermal, infrared,\
    \ and microwave bands carry great promise for soil moisture mapping\nand other\
    \ PA applications [231–233].\n5.2. Nutrient Management\nTimely and appropriate\
    \ application of fertilizers is essential to optimize crop growth and yields\n\
    while minimizing environmental damage through nutrient losses to groundwater and\
    \ surface water.\nTypically, a recommended rate of fertilizer is uniformly applied\
    \ during planting and later crop growth\nstages. However, the fertilizer requirement\
    \ of crops varies spatially and temporally (during and\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12,\
    \ 3136\n15 of 31\namong seasons) due to diﬀerences in soils, management, topography,\
    \ weather, and hydrology [12,234].\nMapping of such variability in crop nutrient\
    \ status/requirement for PA applications could be challenging\nwith conventionally\
    \ used tools such as chlorophyll meters [165].\nSeveral vegetation indices (e.g.,\
    \ NDVI, SAVI), derived from remote sensing data, have been\nshown to be signiﬁcantly\
    \ correlated with plant chlorophyll content, photosynthetic activity, and plant\n\
    productivity (Table 2). Mapping of these indices can thus help understand the\
    \ spatial variability in\ncrop nutrient status, which is important for PA. Recently,\
    \ several tractor mounted remote sensors have\nbecome available that can measure\
    \ plant nutrient status for real-time application of spatially-variable\nfertilizer\
    \ rates. Green Seeker, Yara N-sensor, and Crop Circle are some examples of commercially\n\
    available hand-held and tractor mounted remote sensors that use crop reﬂectance\
    \ data to determine\nand apply spatially variable fertilizer rates in real-time\
    \ [235].\nIn tractor mounted systems, remote sensors are usually mounted ahead\
    \ of the spray boom.\nNitrogen (N) application rates in these systems are determined\
    \ based on the calculated vegetation\nindices (e.g., NDVI), which are further\
    \ communicated to nutrient applicator/spreader for real-time\nfertilizer application.\
    \ Diﬀerent algorithms are used to convert the measured vegetation indices into\n\
    recommended N-application rates. In general, the N-application rates are calculated\
    \ by comparing\nmeasured vegetation indices in the target ﬁeld with a reference\
    \ vegetation index measured in a well\nfertilized (N-rich) plot/strip that is\
    \ representative of the target ﬁeld. Several fertilizer rate calculation\nalgorithms\
    \ (e.g., the nitrogen fertilizer optimization algorithm) [236,237] have been developed\
    \ and\nsuccessfully implemented in these commercially available sensors to determine\
    \ vegetation-indices\nbased in-season N-requirements for many crops [238,239].\n\
    Despite the commercialization of variable rate N-management technologies based\
    \ on proximal\nremote sensing, farmer’s adoption remains low in many agricultural\
    \ enterprises [240]. A lack of clear\nevidence on signiﬁcant economic beneﬁts\
    \ (crop yield and/or proﬁts), especially in commercial farm\nsettings (i.e., large\
    \ ﬁelds) is a limiting factor for the large scale adoption of these technologies\
    \ [241].\nTo further reﬁne these remote sensing based technologies and enhance\
    \ its beneﬁts, research is\nbeing conducted with UAVs and other remote sensors\
    \ for a variety of crops in diﬀerent climatic\nregions. Maresma et al. [165] used\
    \ images captured from a UAV to determine the suitability of\nseveral vegetation\
    \ indices and crop height in determining in-season fertilizer application rates\
    \ for\ncorn grown in Spain. Cao et al. [242] showed that Green Seeker and Crop\
    \ Circle sensors resulted\nin reduced N-fertilizer use and increased N-productivity\
    \ for winter wheat production in China.\nOverall, remote sensing based mapping\
    \ of crop nutrient status in PA can help increase crop nutrient\nuse eﬃciency\
    \ while maintaining/increasing crop yields and reducing oﬀ-site nutrient losses\
    \ that are\ndamaging to the environment.\nRemote sensing has also been used to\
    \ determine soil organic matter and phosphorus content\nto develop spatial maps\
    \ that can aid in site-speciﬁc management [243–246].\nBlasch et al. [243]\nused\
    \ multi-temporal satellite images from RapidEye in conjunction with principal\
    \ component\nanalysis to develop ﬁeld-scale soil organic matter maps to aid in\
    \ site-speciﬁc precision management.\nCastaldi et al. [245] used images obtained\
    \ from Sentinel-2 to develop soil organic carbon maps at both\nﬁeld and regional\
    \ scales in Germany, Luxembourg, and Belgium and showed that the satellite data\n\
    have an adequate spatial resolution for ﬁeld scale planning in PA management.\
    \ Crop growth is a\nfunction of several biotic and abiotic factors related to\
    \ soils, management, topography, hydrology,\nand other environmental variables.\
    \ Therefore, vegetation indices derived from remote sensing of crop\ngrowth/status\
    \ are reﬂective of the combined variability in these factors or stressors. While\
    \ using the\nvegetation indices to determine the plant nutrient status or N-application\
    \ rates, one should also consider\npotentially confounding eﬀects caused due to\
    \ other stressors such as moisture stress and disease.\n5.3. Disease Management\n\
    Diseases can cause a signiﬁcant loss of crop production and farm proﬁts. Early\
    \ detection of\nplant disease and its spatial extent can help contain the disease\
    \ spread and reduce production losses.\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 3136\n16 of 31\n\
    Field scouting, a conventional method of disease detection, is time consuming,\
    \ labor intensive,\nand prone to human error [126]. In addition, with ﬁeld scouting,\
    \ it may be diﬃcult to detect the disease\nduring the early stages when the symptoms\
    \ are not fully visible. Furthermore, some diseases do not\nshow any visible symptoms,\
    \ or the eﬀect may not be noticeable until it is too late to act [247]. It is\
    \ also\ndiﬃcult to map the spatial extent and severity of the disease spread with\
    \ the traditional method of\nﬁeld scouting.\nRemote sensing could be used to monitor\
    \ the disease eﬃciently, especially in the early stages\nof disease development,\
    \ when it may be diﬃcult to discern the signs of disease with ﬁeld scouting.\n\
    Multiple techniques using RGB, multi-spectral, hyperspectral, thermal, and ﬂuorescence\
    \ imaging\nhave been used to identify diseases in a variety of crops [178]. Di\
    \ Gennaro et al. [248] found a\ngood correlation between grapevine leaf stripe\
    \ disease and NDVI generated from UAV imageries\nin Italy. Abdulridha et al. [172]\
    \ used a machine learning approach with vegetation indices derived\nfrom hyperspectral\
    \ UAV images to detect citrus canker with 96% accuracy even during the early stage\n\
    of disease development. As the diﬀerences in spectral signatures observed in a\
    \ ﬁeld can occur due\nto a combination of biotic and abiotic stresses, it could\
    \ be challenging to discern the eﬀects caused\ndue to individual stressors (e.g.,\
    \ disease, water or nutrient stress). As compared to the typically used\nvegetation\
    \ indices (e.g., NDVI), the development of disease speciﬁc spectral disease indices\
    \ (SDI) can\nincrease the accuracy of disease detection and diﬀerentiation under\
    \ real world ﬁeld conditions [249,250].\nHigher disease detection accuracies during\
    \ critical crop growth stages such as ﬂowering can help\nimplement eﬀective management\
    \ plans in a timely manner to mitigate or avoid large yield and\nfruit quality\
    \ losses. Use of SDIs, in place of typical VIs, can also reduce the complexity\
    \ of disease\ndetection methods and increase the system eﬃcacy by reducing the\
    \ computational demand [250].\nAlthough studies have been conducted for plant\
    \ disease classiﬁcation [251], further eﬀorts are needed\nto develop more accurate,\
    \ automated and reproducible methodologies for disease detection under\ndiverse\
    \ climatic and real-world ﬁeld conditions [40].\n5.4. Weed Management\nConventional\
    \ weed management approaches involving a uniform application of herbicide is an\n\
    ineﬃcient practice that increases the risk for oﬀ-site pesticide losses [252].\
    \ Application of herbicide\nat a variable rate as per need can help enhance the\
    \ treatment eﬃciency and reduce input costs and\nenvironmental pollution [253].\
    \ Remote sensing has widely been used for mapping weed patches in\ncrop ﬁelds\
    \ for site-speciﬁc weed management [43]. Weeds can be identiﬁed or diﬀerentiated\
    \ from\ncrop plants based on their peculiar spectral signature related to their\
    \ phenological or morphological\nattributes that are diﬀerent from the crop. Over\
    \ the last few years, machine learning approaches have\nemerged as a highly accurate\
    \ and eﬃcient method of image classiﬁcation for weed mapping [254–256].\nTwo general\
    \ types of image classiﬁcation approaches are commonly used for weed mapping;\
    \ supervised\nand unsupervised classiﬁcation. Although each method has its own\
    \ strengths and weaknesses,\nsupervised classiﬁcation is time-intensive and requires\
    \ more manual work [26].\nUAVs have been the most popular remote sensing platform\
    \ for weed mapping and management\nprimarily due to its capability to produce\
    \ cm-scale resolution (5 cm) [257]) images needed for weed\ndetection and mapping.\
    \ Using the fully convolutional network approach, Huang et al. [254] mapped\n\
    weeds in a rice ﬁeld in China with up to 90% accuracy. Partel et al. [255] developed\
    \ a target weed\nsprayer using deep learning neural network approach for ground-sensor\
    \ based weed detection that\nyielded in 71% application accuracy in experimental\
    \ ﬁelds in Florida, USA. However, the commercial\nadoption of these technologies\
    \ remains challenging, given the expertise required to use advanced\nsoftware\
    \ and technical processes involved in their applications [258].\n5.5. Crop Monitoring\
    \ and Yield\nMonitoring crop growth and yield are necessary to understand the\
    \ crop response to the\nenvironment and agronomic practices and develop eﬀective\
    \ management plans for ﬁeldwork and/or\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 3136\n17 of 31\n\
    remedies [259]. LAI and biomass are two essential indicators of crop health and\
    \ development [28].\nLAI is also used as an input in many crop growth and yield\
    \ forecasting models [260]. In-situ methods\nof LAI estimation (physical and optical)\
    \ are time consuming and labor intensive, similar to the\ndestructive ﬁeld methods\
    \ used for biomass estimation.\nAlso, these methods do not provide a\nspatial\
    \ variability map of crop growth and biomass [261,262]. Remote sensing data on\
    \ crop growth\n(e.g., LAI) and biomass can help obtain valuable information on\
    \ site-speciﬁc properties (e.g., soils,\ntopography), management (e.g., water,\
    \ nutrient, and other inputs), and various biotic and abiotic\nstressors (e.g.,\
    \ diseases, weeds, water, and nutrient stress) [263]. Similarly, remote sensing\
    \ data can\nalso be used to map diﬀerences in tillage and residue management and\
    \ its eﬀects on crop growth [264].\nSeveral studies have used hyperspectral images\
    \ with various machine learning and classiﬁcation\ntechniques to map tillage and\
    \ crop residue in agricultural ﬁelds [265,266]. Such information on crop\nconditions\
    \ and tillage practices can help develop site speciﬁc management plans, including\
    \ variable\nwater, nutrient, and pesticide application to increase production\
    \ and management eﬃciency.\nRemote sensing data have been used to estimate LAI\
    \ and biomass for a variety of crops,\nincluding row crops, orchards, and vine\
    \ crops [267–269]. Typically, such studies use a set of reference\ndata (e.g.,\
    \ measured LAI and corresponding vegetation indices) to develop a regression or\
    \ machine\nlearning based approach to estimate LAI and/or biomass for a target\
    \ ﬁeld. Yue et al. [262] used multiple\nspectral indices in conjunction with measured\
    \ plant height to estimate biomass (R2 = 0.74) in multiple\nirrigations and nutrient\
    \ treatment plots for winter wheat grown in China. Ali et al. [269] used red-edge\n\
    position (REP) extracted from hyperspectral images to predict LAI (R2 = 0.93)\
    \ and chlorophyll content\n(R2 = 0.90) for Kinnow mandarins grown in Pakistan.\
    \ REP is the position of the main inﬂection point\nof the red-NIR slope created\
    \ due to strong chlorophyll absorption in the red spectrum and canopy\nscattering\
    \ in the NIR region [269]. Reliable LAI estimation from reﬂectance data could\
    \ be diﬃcult,\nespecially during early crop growth stages due to interference\
    \ from the bare soil surface. To overcome\nthis limitation, modiﬁed vegetation\
    \ indices adjusted for soil and other interferences have been proposed\nand used\
    \ to estimate LAI [270]. Recently, red-edge based vegetation indices have been\
    \ shown to be\npromising for estimating LAI in multiple crops [271].\nFor PA,\
    \ knowledge of spatial variability in crop yield is important to understand crop\
    \ response\nto management practices and environmental stressors. Remote sensing\
    \ derived crop biophysical\nparameters, or vegetation indices have a strong correlation\
    \ with observed crop yield and biomass,\nindicating their potential for use in\
    \ yield estimation [259]. Crop yield estimation from remotely sensed\ndata has\
    \ generally been conducted in two ways.\nFirst, biophysical parameters (e.g.,\
    \ LAI) derived from remotely sensed data are used in a crop\nmodel to estimate\
    \ the crop yield and biomass. Second, statistical (e.g., regression) or empirical\n\
    relationships are developed between remote sensing derived crop parameters/indices\
    \ (e.g., NDVI, LAI)\nand observed crop yield and biomass in a representative crop\
    \ ﬁeld. The developed regression model\nor empirical relationship could then be\
    \ used to map crop yield at a target crop ﬁeld. Crop modeling is\na data-intensive\
    \ approach, which requires a large amount of information as model input parameters,\n\
    meteorological data, and observed yield and biomass data.\nMaresma et al. [161]\
    \ used a regression based approach to evaluate the relationship between corn\n\
    yield and biomass and spectral indices measured at the V12 stage. Similar to other\
    \ studies, they also\nfound that the red-based indices NDVI and wide dynamic range\
    \ vegetation index (WDRVI) had the\nhighest correlation with grain yields for\
    \ a range of fertilizer application rates. Spatial mapping of crop\nbiophysical\
    \ parameters or indices at multiple times during a growing season is likely to\
    \ provide a\nbetter estimation of crop biomass and yield as compared to a single\
    \ snapshot during the season [263].\n6. Progress Made, Needs, and Challenges\n\
    Remote sensing has potential applications in almost every aspect of PA, from land\
    \ preparation to\nharvesting. The abundance of high spatial resolution multi-temporal\
    \ satellite data along with low-cost\nUAVs and commercially available ground-based\
    \ proximity sensors have changed the face of PA. A large\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12,\
    \ 3136\n18 of 31\nnumber of advanced techniques, including empirical, regression,\
    \ and various forms of machine learning\napproaches have been used to explore\
    \ the potential applications of remote sensing in PA. Similarly,\nmany vegetation\
    \ indices have been developed and tested for their ability to help PA operations,\n\
    including variable fertilizer management, irrigation scheduling, disease control,\
    \ weed mapping,\nand yield forecasting. However, many challenges need to be addressed\
    \ before the remote sensing\ntechnologies can potentially see a large-scale adoption\
    \ in commercial and non-commercial agriculture.\nAlthough most of the satellite\
    \ data are available for free, it may require a signiﬁcant amount\nof technical\
    \ knowledge and expertise to process them for real-world applications. For example,\n\
    image pre-processing and post-processing require expert knowledge and software.\
    \ In addition,\nmany PA operations such as disease and weed management require\
    \ ﬁne spatial resolution (cm-scale)\ndata with high spectral and temporal (e.g.,\
    \ daily) resolution. Most of the publicly available satellite\ndata do not meet\
    \ such requirements. Furthermore, cloudy days and variable or inconsistent irradiance\n\
    or sunlight may render many satellite images unsuitable for use.\nUsers/farmers\
    \ may need to purchase high resolution (spatial, temporal and spectral) satellite\n\
    data, which can be cost-prohibitive, especially for small farms. However, images\
    \ acquired from\nUAVs are likely to oﬀer a low-cost alternative for small farm\
    \ operations [272]. Use of UAVs and\ntractor-mounted sensors also involve the\
    \ use of special software for data analysis and need professional\noperators (e.g.,\
    \ drone licensing) [235]. Hyperspectral images acquired from the state of the\
    \ art sensors\nmounted on some of the recently launched satellites and UAVs provide\
    \ a large amount of information\non crop biophysical parameters. However, these\
    \ sensors are expensive (UAVs), and the processing\nof imageries is complex [246].\
    \ There is a need to explore and develop advanced information and\ncommunication\
    \ technologies as well as chemometric and spectral decomposition methods to synthesize\n\
    and generate practical information needed for PA applications. Artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ techniques,\nincluding machine learning, has great potential to generate spatially\
    \ and temporally continuous\ninformation from instantaneous satellite data at\
    \ a scale necessary for many PA applications [212].\nHybrid methods, combining\
    \ the knowledge obtained from physically based models, can complement\nsuch AI\
    \ techniques to help develop techniques useful in PA decision making [43,212].\n\
    Despite a large number of studies on remote sensing applications in PA, there\
    \ is a general lack\nof established techniques and/or framework that are accurate,\
    \ reproducible, and applicable under\na wide variety of climatic, soil, crop,\
    \ and management conditions. Accuracies of methods using\nremote sensing (satellite,\
    \ aerial, and UAV) data depends on a variety of factors including image\nresolution\
    \ (spatial, spectral, and temporal); atmospheric, climatic, and weather conditions;\
    \ crop and\nﬁeld conditions (e.g., growth stage, land cover); and the analyses\
    \ technique (e.g., regression-based,\nmachine learning, physically based modeling).\
    \ For example, the accuracy of surface energy balance\ntechniques for ET estimation\
    \ varies signiﬁcantly in space and time, causing a large uncertainty in PA\ndecision\
    \ making. More studies are needed to understand the spatio-temporal structure\
    \ of uncertainty\nin estimating ET, soil moisture, disease stress, and other crop\
    \ parameters. Spectral signature from a\ncrop is a reﬂection of crop status/response\
    \ to site characteristics (e.g., soil, topography), management,\nand simultaneously\
    \ acting multiple biotic and abiotic stressors (e.g., diseases, weeds, nutrient\
    \ and\nwater stress, etc.). A disease detection method found suitable under controlled\
    \ experimental conditions\nmay not perform similarly well in real-world conditions\
    \ where multiple biotic and biotic stressors\ngovern crop response or conditions.\
    \ Given the complexity of image processing methods and the\namount of technical\
    \ knowledge and expertise it requires for application, there is a need to explore\n\
    and develop a simple and reliable workﬂow for image pre-processing, analysis and\
    \ application in\nreal time. Major challenges and gaps remain in the development\
    \ of tools and frameworks that can\nfacilitate the use of satellite data for real-time\
    \ applications by the end-users. Development of accurate,\nuser-friendly systems\
    \ is likely to result in wider adoption of remote sensing data in commercial and\n\
    non-commercial PA operations.\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 3136\n19 of 31\nAuthor Contributions:\

    Background High-quality plant phenotyping and climate data lay the foundation
    for phenotypic analysis and genotype-environment interaction, providing important
    evidence not only for plant scientists to understand the dynamics between crop
    performance, genotypes, and environmental factors but also for agronomists and
    farmers to closely monitor crops in fluctuating agricultural conditions. With
    the rise of Internet of Things technologies (IoT) in recent years, many IoT-based
    remote sensing devices have been applied to plant phenotyping and crop monitoring,
    which are generating terabytes of biological datasets every day. However, it is
    still technically challenging to calibrate, annotate, and aggregate the big data
    effectively, especially when they were produced in multiple locations and at different
    scales. Findings CropSight is a PHP Hypertext Pre-processor and structured query
    language-based server platform that provides automated data collation, storage,
    and information management through distributed IoT sensors and phenotyping workstations.
    It provides a two-component solution to monitor biological experiments through
    networked sensing devices, with interfaces specifically designed for distributed
    plant phenotyping and centralized data management. Data transfer and annotation
    are accomplished automatically through an hypertext transfer protocol-accessible
    RESTful API installed on both device side and server side of the CropSight system,
    which synchronize daily representative crop growth images for visual-based crop
    assessment and hourly microclimate readings for GxE studies. CropSight also supports
    the comparison of historical and ongoing crop performance while different experiments
    are being conducted. Conclusions As a scalable and open-source information management
    system, CropSight can be used to maintain and collate important crop performance
    and microclimate datasets captured by IoT sensors and distributed phenotyping
    installations. It provides near real-time environmental and crop growth monitoring
    in addition to historical and current experiment comparison through an integrated
    cloud-ready server system. Accessible both locally in the field through smart
    devices and remotely in an office using a personal computer, CropSight has been
    applied to field experiments of bread wheat prebreeding since 2016 and speed breeding
    since 2017. We believe that the CropSight system could have a significant impact
    on scalable plant phenotyping and IoT-style crop management to enable smart agricultural
    practices in the near future. Issue Section: TECHNICAL NOTE Background Automated
    phenotyping technology has the potential to enable continuous and precise measurement
    of dynamic phenotypes that are key to today''s plant research [1, 2]. Quantitative
    phenotypic traits collected through crop development are not only important evidence
    for plant scientists to understand the dynamics between plant performance, genotypes,
    and environmental factors (i.e., genotype-environment interaction [GxE]), they
    are critical for agronomists and farmers to closely monitor crops in fluctuating
    agricultural conditions [3–5]. High-quality phenotyping and climate datasets lay
    the foundation for meaningful phenotypic analysis, which is likely to produce
    an accurate delineation of the genotype-to-phenotype pathway for the assessment
    of yield potential and environmental adaptation [6, 7]. Presently, although many
    automated phenotyping platforms are capable of generating large plant-environment
    data [8], it is still technically challenging to collect, calibrate, annotate,
    and aggregate these datasets effectively, especially for experiments carried out
    in multiple locations and at different scales [9, 10]. lWith the rise of Internet
    of Things (IoT) technologies and their applications in plant phenotyping [11],
    a number of commercial data and experiment management solutions have been developed
    on the basis of customized hardware and proprietary software. For example, LemnaTec''s
    Field Scanalyzer platform [12] employs a simple hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP)
    server with an SQLite database to facilitate crop monitoring and deep phenotyping
    using LemnaControl and LemnaBase systems [13, 14]. Integrated Analysis Platform
    (LemnaTec) [15] together with LemnaGrid analysis software form an automated data
    processing platform that combines raw image collection, metadata association,
    and phenotypic analysis for indoor plant phenotyping. Phenospex''s FieldScan system
    uses an infield WiFi network to connect PlantEye three-dimensional laser scanners,
    climate sensors, and a gantry system with a PostgreSQL database to realize the
    scanner-to-plant phenotyping [16]. Furthermore, the PlantScreen system (Photon
    Systems Instruments) manages fluorescence images through computer vision techniques
    via dedicated networks and databases [17]. However, the above-mentioned commercial
    systems require ongoing licensing maintenance and additional costs for developing
    new functions. It is therefore challenging for a broader plant research community
    to adopt and extend them easily in order to meet the growing needs of today''s
    plant research [10]. Recently, some research-based systems have also been introduced
    to the scientific community. For example, by combining local and global management
    subsystems, a cloud-based remote control system has been developed to monitor
    environmental conditions in tropical horticulture cultivation as well as remotely
    control drip irrigation for tomato plants based on soil moisture content [18].
    The framework has been tested under unstable network connections in rural areas,
    which has demonstrated its potential and usefulness. However, it requires long-term
    outdoor verification and still has compatibility issues when integrating with
    different sensing devices. PhotosynQ software manages data collection and storage
    through a handheld device called MultispeQ [19]. It uses Bluetooth to retrieve
    leaf surface images, environmental and geolocational data collected by the handheld
    device, which are then stored in a mobile phone or a laptop for centralized analysis.
    The system requires manual interference for data synchronization and onsite workstations
    or cloud-based servers for data analysis. Hence, it is tailored for small-scale
    and qualitative phenotyping tasks. BreedVision is another system that gathers
    data through a network-based HTTP server [20]. Mounting multiple sensors on a
    tractor, BreedVision is used to carry out field phenotyping for wheat breeding.
    Sensors communicate to a structured query language (SQL) database running in an
    embedded system. However, similar to the above-mentioned commercial systems, this
    platform is designed for bespoke hardware and has not provided an open application
    programming interface (API) that allows external hardware and software to connect.
    Solely for collecting climate datasets, the PANGEA architecture [21] was successfully
    established to network large numbers of connections (e.g., wireless sensor networks
    [WSNs]) for agricultural practices [22]. This system has been used to integrate
    large-scale WSN installations through open and distributed smart device interfaces.
    However, it cannot handle image-based datasets and thus limits its applications
    in image-based plant research. Recently, a comprehensive and open-source phenotyping
    hybrid information system (PHIS) has been developed by INRA [23]. The PHIS aims
    to provide a platform to enable data tracing and reanalysis of phenomic data (for
    both sensor- and image-based data) collected on thousands of plants, sensors,
    and events. It can identify and retrieve objects, traits, and relations via ontologies
    and semantics. Because the PHIS needs to incorporate many external phenotyping
    and modeling systems, it is heavyweight and suitable for post-experimental data
    integration and analysis. The above-mentioned industrial and academic efforts
    identify the need to develop a scalable and openly available information management
    system to deal with our growing experimental needs and biological datasets. It
    needs to handle different types of datasets acquired in plant phenotyping experiments.
    To integrate data transfer, calibration, annotation, and aggregation effectively,
    such a system should be flexible for changeable experimental designs and expandable
    with third-party hardware and external software. More importantly, the system
    needs to enable users to closely monitor experiments conducted in different locations
    while experiments are being carried out. With these design requirements in mind,
    we developed CropSight, a scalable IoT-based information management system that
    is easy to use and flexible to deploy in diverse experimental scenarios. CropSight
    is an open-source software system that provides a range of interfacing options
    for the community to adopt and extend. We followed a distributed systems design
    during the development so that experimental, phenotypic, and environmental data
    collected from infield and indoor experiments could be integrated efficiently.
    The system provides a unified web interface for users to oversee data collection,
    calibration, and storage on a regular basis. Through our three-year wheat prebreeding
    field experiments (2016–2018) [24] and the speed breeding project [25], a powerful
    visualization component and a flexible data/experiment management solution has
    been established. Equipped with CropSight, users can now closely monitor different
    experiments, both ongoing and historic, running in different locations. Furthermore,
    the modulated software architecture has made it possible to change scale and performance
    for growing experimental needs. To our knowledge, the research-based CropSight
    system has the potential to significantly contribute toward dynamic data collation
    and scalable experimental management for both plant phenotyping and crop GxE studies.
    Findings IoT is a fast-growing field. IoT-based sensors are generating terabytes
    of data for plant research and agriculture services every day [26]. Since the
    existing data/experiment management solutions heavily rely on bespoke data collection
    approaches, they cannot be easily adopted and extended. Also, most of the present
    solutions require the construction of a centralized management system, which could
    not resolve the problem of scalability and accessibility because the distributed
    nature of IoT technologies and the centralized data administration infrastructure
    are likely to confound each other. Instead, we developed a two-component solution.
    The first part of this is a device-side system that is lightweight and capable
    of interacting directly with distributed IoT sensing devices, which can ensure
    onboard data standardization and data collection. The second component is a server-side
    system that collates and stores image- and sensor-based data, with SQL as the
    back-end. This server-side system is more comprehensive and responsible for managing
    and visualizing dynamic crop-environment data collected during experiments. Combining
    both parts, the open-source CropSight system is capable of bringing scalability
    and flexibility to users. The systems design The two-component systems design
    of CropSight is shown in Fig. 1. We used a Python-based web framework, Flask [27,
    28], as the base for the device-side services. The main reason for this choice
    is that Python, a high-level programming language widely used by the scientific
    community, can interact with many single-board computers (e.g., a Raspberry Pi
    computer) commonly embedded in distributed IoT sensors and/or phenotyping devices.
    This framework administers onboard data flow and storage together with a lightweight
    server for web-based interactions (Fig. 1A). As Flask is hardware independent,
    the approach can be applied to any hardware that supports Python. Additional services
    such as Linux crontab scheduling system, dynamic host configuration protocol (used
    for establishing self-operating WiFi network), and virtual network computing (VNC)
    services can also be easily added or removed to maintain the simplicity of the
    device-side system. Figure 1: Open in new tabDownload slide A deployment diagram

    to interact with distributed infield or indoor phenotyping devices using wired
    (i.e., ethernet cables) or wireless connection (e.g., WiFi network). The CropSight
    client running on distributed workstations supports remote control and onboard
    data management. (B) Users can connect, monitor, and administer experiments through
    the centralized CropSight server in near real time. Through dedicated networks,
    the CropSight back-end server collates and integrates large-scale image- and sensor-based
    phenotyping datasets in an SQL database. Powered by Hypertext Pre-processor (PHP)
    5+ [29] and MySQL [30], the device-side system can facilitate real-time interactions
    between smart devices (e.g., smartphones and tablets) and IoT devices. The graphic
    user interface (GUI) was developed using PHP and JavaScript, which can be opened
    in a web browser such as Chrome and Firefox on any smart device. A PHP-based RESTful
    API [31] was adopted to regulate hourly client-server communications. A lightweight
    SQL server, MariaDB [32], was used for collecting and storing different formats
    of datasets, including images, climate sensors, and experimental settings. The
    device-side system can give access to each phenotyping device so that live video
    streaming and remote system configuration can be initiated by users to deploy
    phenotyping devices (Supplementary Fig. S1) as well as to establish indoor or
    infield experiments just using a smartphone or a tablet. Also, the GUI allows
    users to enter metadata including trials, experiments (e.g., genotypes, treatments
    and biological replicates), and brief descriptions, while phenotyping devices
    are being installed. The distributed IoT-based design has massively improved the
    mobility and flexibility of phenotyping tasks. The server-side system bridges
    the connection between data aggregation and cloud-based interfacing (Fig. 1B).
    This approach facilitates biological data acquired at different locations to be
    synchronized with a centralized server for data management, detailed traits analyses,
    and decision making in crop management. PHP5+ was used to develop the system that
    supports Apache and an SQL server such as MySQL [30]. The server-side system initiates
    regular updates of the status of each distributed IoT device via server user interface,
    with information such as online or offline status of the device, operational mode,
    representative daily images, micro-climate readings, and the usage of computing
    resources (i.e., central processing unit and memory). Between 2016 and 2018, the
    two-component CropSight system has been successfully applied to monitor wheat
    prebreeding experiments in the field and indoor wheat speed breeding (i.e., growth
    chamber and greenhouse) simultaneously (Supplementary Fig. S2). While CropSight
    is designed to allow use by individuals with no technical background, the installation
    of the system still requires an IT technician to complete (see Additional File
    1 for detailed instructions). To install the system, a functioning PHP and SQL
    server is required. Also, as it needs to run on a network-enabled web server,
    a network infrastructure is therefore required to operate CropSight (Fig. 2).
    Due to the rural location of many crop research experiments, it is often expensive
    and unfeasible to install wired or wireless networks in some experimental sites.
    Hence, our solution is to establish an ad hoc and self-operating network through
    universal serial bus (USB) WiFi dongles mounted on IoT devices, e.g., a CropQuant
    phenotyping workstation [24], so CropSight can manage data transfer between distributed
    devices (distributed nodes) and a central server (a server node). The self-operating
    network can be either a Star or a Mesh network topology (Supplementary Fig. S3).
    In our case, we have established a Star network typology in field experiments
    of bread wheat. The device-side CropSight system administers the self-operating
    network, enabling peer-to-peer HTTP accessing points to network distributed nodes
    for data calibration and synchronization (Fig. 2A) or to establish a direct link
    between a smart device and a server node (Fig. 2B). After correlating and collecting
    all data from the device side, the system will then transfer the data to the server-side
    system, where users could oversee different experiments at near real time (Fig.
    2C). The self-operating networking approach enables flexible WiFi coverage over
    experiment sites. It is important to point out that the effective radius of one
    Star network in our experiments is around 1,000–1,200 m2, which is determined
    by the effective 25-meter range of the USB WiFi dongles installed in our CropQuant
    phenotyping workstations. A normal Star network includes eight low-cost distributed
    nodes and one server node, which costs approximate $4,200 to build in-house. For
    an individual phenotyping workstation (i.e., a distributed node), around 20 GB
    sensor- and image-based data could be generated in a growing season. Figure 2:

    data flows, and device- and server-side applications of the CropSight system.
    (A) IoT phenotyping workstations installed in wheat field experiments. Distributed
    phenotyping nodes are connected by the CropSight system. (B) Infield phenotyping
    devices can be directly accessed and controlled through the device-side CropSight
    system using a smart device. (C) The server-side CropSight system can be used
    to manage ongoing indoor and infield experiments by accessing a centralized web
    interface. (D) A detailed component diagram showing the MVC design of CropSight
    and the interface between distributed phenotyping workstations, device-side CropSight
    server, server-side system, and detailed data flows. The data input is through
    a RESTful API, responsible for transferring data between servers and enabling
    interactions through a web-based user interface. An MVC architecture When implementing
    the CropSight system, we followed Model-view-controller (MVC) software architecture,
    dividing the system into three interconnected parts to separate internal information
    flows based on how they are presented to the user [33]. Using the MVC pattern
    to interface different parts of the CropSight system, not only source code can
    be reused for both device-side and server-side software implementation, we could
    also enable modulated parallel software development to add new functions, while
    biological experiments were still ongoing (Fig. 2D). To enable data standardization
    and integration, a RESTful API was implemented that accepts image- and sensor-based
    datasets and IoT device status updates in JavaScript object notation (JSON) format.
    All interactions between devices and the server are authenticated using a pre-shared
    key pair to ensure that data collection is accomplished from a trusted source.
    The RESTful design allows all data requested for transaction to be contained within
    a single request, which compiles all information into one JSON object and then
    transmits through an HTTP POST request. The Model implementation allows us to
    determine dynamic data structures, as well as to manage logic and rules of the
    CropSight system. The entity–relationship model (ER diagram) used for establishing
    the database, including entity types and specifies relationships between the entity
    types, can be seen in Supplementary Fig. S4. Based on the PHP server (Apache tested)
    and the SQL server (MySQL and MariaDB tested), the Controller component responds
    to user input and internal interactions on the data model. The controller receives
    image, sensor and system status as the input data flows, validates them, and then
    passes them to the model component, first on a distributed device-side server
    and then transmitted to a globally accessible server-side server, which mirrors
    the input data. Internet connections are required, if the input datasets need
    to be transferred from a field experiment site to onsite servers. The form of
    data transmission can be either wired ethernet or WiFi network. The Controller
    administers data collation between device-side and server-side by mimicking the
    device API call to the higher-level server API at the time that device request
    is programmed. The View component presents the data model and user interactions
    in two formats. First, through an active HTTP connection and D3.js graphing engine
    [33], users can access distributed IoT devices via web browsers (Chrome and Firefox
    tested) installed on any smart device in the field or in greenhouses. The device-side
    CropSight provides a tailored GUI window, within which users can deploy (see Additional
    File 1), monitor, assess, and download captured data on demand. Second, the device-side
    system synchronizes with the server at regular intervals, based on which CropSight
    provides a more comprehensive GUI to present both experimental and technical status
    (i.e., system status) of ongoing experiments. The device-side system is designed
    to be distributed. So, if a given IoT device cannot make a direct Internet connection
    for any reasons, the device-side system will enable local data storage as a server
    node. After the networking is re-established, the system can then forward collected
    data automatically (the onboard USB memory stick can store up to 60 days’ of image
    and sensor data). Experiment and data management Monitoring dynamic plant phenotypes
    such as height, growth rate, growth stages, and associated climate conditions
    in biological experiments can be a laborious and time-consuming task. It is even
    more challenging if we need to calibrate and verify datasets collected from sensing
    devices deployed in different sites. In particular, low-quality and missing data
    often lead to analysis errors and unusable results, which normally can only be
    identified after the completion of experiments [34]. Hence, the server-side CropSight
    system was designed to oversee ongoing experiments based on representative daily
    images, hourly sensor data collected from each phenotyping device, as well as
    experimental settings such as genotype, treatment, drilling date, plot position
    and biological replicate. The interfaces of experiment and data management are
    presented in Fig. 3, which integrate experiment location, plot map, and crop/experiment/device
    information to enable quick cross-referencing so that crop management decisions
    can be made while experiments are ongoing. As shown in Fig. 3A, for a given experiment,
    the grid view provides global positioning system (GPS)-tagged project geolocation,
    identifiers of installed phenotyping devices, representative daily images of monitored
    plots, and color-coded status indicator showing the operation mode of each distributed
    device. CropSight reads the device-side server''s GPS coordinates and presents
    the geolocation in an embedded Google Map for users to locate the experiment.
    In addition to the GPS location, an embedded plot map is also provided demonstrating
    the position of each monitored plot or pot in the field or in greenhouses together
    with color-coded status markers, indicating whether extra attention is needed
    (e.g., green for operating, amber for idle, and red for device termination or
    operational error). These markers in the plot map can be clicked, which will bring
    the user to the detailed view of an individual device (Fig. 4). Each distributed
    phenotyping device uploads a daily representative image of the monitored plot
    or pot. The resolution of the image is 640 × 480 pixels, downsized from 2,592
    × 1,944 pixels to enable effective data transmission for large-scale device-server
    data synchronization. The image is automatically selected based on file size,
    intensity, and image clarity. Image calibration and white balance for infield
    crop imaging are accomplished via phenotyping devices such as CropQuant workstations
    [24]. The automated adjustment of white balance gains and exposure mode under
    changeable lighting conditions are included in the Python script available in
    the CropSight project repository on GitHub ([34], Assets Section, camera_capture_script.py).

    system. (A) The user interface is accessible through a web browser on any computing
    device. The grid view of the system is designed to present all experiments, including
    geolocation of the experiments, their experimental layouts, monitored plots and
    genotypes, experiment duration, and representative daily images. (B) The list
    view shows detailed statistics of all monitored crops in a given experiment, including
    crop information (genotypes and daily images), experimental information, and distributed
    phenotyping information such as workstation ID, storage, IP address, image and
    sensor data download, and device interaction functions via flask-based HTTP interface.
    Figure 4: Open in new tabDownload slide The individual view of the server-side
    CropSight system. (A) The individual view of the server-side CropSight system
    monitoring crops in the field, detailing device and experiment information together
    with captured microclimate data. (B) Web-based graph visualization of hourly sensor
    readings during a given experiment, showing ambient temperature, ambient humidity,
    field lighting, soil moisture, and soil temperature variation in the plot region.
    The grid view of these representative images is used as a snapshot of the experiment,
    so that users can quickly assess plant growth and performance of each genotype
    without regularly walking in the field during the growing season. We have developed
    an image analysis algorithm to automatically select high-quality images from daily
    image series to reduce manual interference on operating phenotyping workstations
    [35], as well as a number of Python-based software such as Leaf-GP to analyze
    growth phenotypes [36]. However, to maintain the independence of CropSight, these
    algorithms have not been integrated in the infrastructure. The list view provides
    a table of status that incorporates crop information with experiment and device
    details (Fig. 3B). This view is mainly used for project maintenance proposes,
    which contains three sections. First, similar to the grid view, crop information
    identifier lists phenotyping devices installed in the experiment. Second, experiment
    information includes a colored status indicator to display the operational mode
    of a given device, the experiment duration of a given device, and the latest time
    stamp of data synchronization. Device uptime (i.e., experiment duration) is computed
    using the device''s internal clock (i.e., the Linux uptime command) and the time
    when the latest image is captured. Third, distributed device information shows:
    (1) each device''s onboard storage, using filled bars to indicate the percentage
    of space left in gigabytes based on regular 30-minute updates; (2) buttons to
    download image- (i.e., “Crop Growth Image Series,” in monthly Zip archives) and
    sensor-based (i.e., “Download Sensor Data,” in a comma-separated value file) datasets
    collated during the experiment from the SQL database; and (3) device interaction
    buttons, providing direct device control and remote system configuration via Secure
    Shell or VNC. Continuous microclimate visualization Microclimate is important
    evidence for plant scientist to monitor radiation/ambient/soil variation in different
    locations over the whole experiment site, an important factor that closely connects
    with the performance at both plant and plot levels [37]. To facilitate the monitoring
    of microclimate during an experiment, a comprehensive visualization function has
    been developed for CropSight (Fig. 4). By accessing a given phenotyping device''s
    detail page, collected environmental factors can be viewed as individual line
    charts along with the device information. IoT-based climate sensor readings are
    logged with the central server and then indexed by device and location, allowing
    near real-time microclimate readings (30-minute updates) of monitored regions.
    The visualization is done in the web browser using the D3 JavaScript library.
    In our case, we can soundly retrieve readings such as device temperature (to assess
    device performance), ambient relative humidity, ambient temperature (Fig. 4A),
    light levels (based on light intensity), soil temperature, and soil moisture (Fig.
    4B). The microclimate datasets acquired from multiple locations across the field
    can also be used for data calibration to generate a normalized and highly reliable
    environmental reading of the experimental site. The CropSight system accepts collective
    readings from most off-the-shelf climate sensors and hence is open to the expansion
    of new environmental variables. The environmental sensors used in our experiments
    are: DHT22 digital temperature and humidity sensor, TSL2561 luminosity sensor,
    DS18B20 waterproof digital temperature probe, and analogue capacitive soil moisture
    sensor. Ambient temperature and humidity sensors were incorporated into the housing
    of the phenotyping workstations, and soil sensors were inserted into the ground
    of the plot, attached to the phenotyping workstations via cables. Applications
    in wheat field experiments A key element of modern agriculture is to closely monitor
    dynamic crop performance and agricultural conditions to predict and plan crop
    production [38]. Plant breeding and GxE studies also rely on high-quality and
    high-frequency crop-environment data to produce accurate growth models for yield
    and quality prediction [39, 40]. The CropSight system provides users with quick
    access to environmental factors recorded by each distributed phenotyping device
    during the growing season. Based on the position of a given phenotyping device,
    seasonal microclimate datasets can jointly form a dynamic growth condition map
    showing environmental conditions and variance in the field (Fig. 5). Figure 5:
    Open in new tabDownload slide Infield spatial measurements of microclimate conditions
    collated by the CropSight system. (A, B) A heat map of ambient sensor reading
    of temperature and relative humidity recorded during the growing season. Each
    cell represents a plot in the 2017 field experiment. Real sensor reading outlined
    in red and interpolated values outlined in green. (C) A heat map of soil-based
    sensor reading of soil temperature recorded during the growing season. In a 253-day
    field experiment of 32 wheat genotypes within the single genetic background of
    Paragon (a UK spring wheat variety) completed in 2017, we installed 16 CropQuant
    field phenotyping workstations to monitor 6-meter wheat plots to collect continuous
    crop growth image series as well as associated microclimate conditions such as
    ambient temperature, relative humidity, light levels, soil temperature, and soil
    humidity. When the datasets were being collated in CropSight, a field map of dynamic
    microclimate conditions at key growth stages (i.e., from early booting to early
    grain filling, 56 days) was gradually produced, showing the increase in ambient
    temperature (Fig. 5A), the variation of ambient moisture levels (Fig. 5B), and
    the steady increase in soil temperature (Fig. 5C). To simplify the presentation,
    the microclimate heat map was presented with data at 14-day intervals, where wheat
    plots installed with sensors were outlined with red and plots without sensors
    were outlined with green, where climate data was produced through data interpolation
    methods based on adjacent readings (Fig. 5). The period of the interval can be
    flexibly changed, and the microclimate readings are retrievable as soon as data
    synchronization is finished (Supplementary Fig. S5 and Additional File 2). Furthermore,
    the climate datasets can be used for cross-validating the soundness of infield
    sensors, e.g., whether soil temperature correlates with ambient temperature (Supplementary
    Fig. S5A) and why readings from many low-cost sensors could provide more representative
    information of the field in comparison with one expensive central weather station
    (Supplementary Fig. S5B). Utilizing this approach, dynamic environmental conditions
    throughout the field can be recorded with very low-cost climate sensors, which
    can then be scaled up through interpolation methods to cover regions without sensors.
    To soundly interpolate environmental data, the placement of climate sensors needs
    to be standardized to ensure effective data coverage. Depending on measurement
    requirements, standards for sensor placement can be based on the estimation of
    evapotranspiration [41]. Through our wheat field experiments between 2016 and
    2018 at Norwich Research Park in the United Kingdom, combining distributed sensors
    and the CropSight system was capable of providing high-quality crop performance
    and growing conditions datasets for our changeable experiment needs. Comparison
    between multi-year experiments CropSight not only provides tools for monitoring
    ongoing infield and indoor experiments but also supplies toolkits to reference
    and download historical datasets. An important part in crop research is being
    able to compare collected results with past experiments. To this end, CropSight
    stores all image and sensor data and manages these historical datasets with easy
    reference and access (Fig. 6). Historical datasets can be retrieved through the
    frontpage, similar to ongoing experiments (multiple projects can be administered
    by CropSight simultaneously). After opening a completed project, users can display
    the GPS-tagged geolocation of an completed project and devices used in the project
    together with project references (Fig. 6A). By clicking a specific plot within
    the experimental field, CropSight can directly reference environmental and image
    datasets in the plot, with device name, date of last capture, and last image taken
    by the phenotyping device (Fig. 6B). If users want to revisit previous datasets
    in the project, they can download both sensor data packages and/or growth image
    series in monthly archives by clicking the archive links (Fig. 6C). This design
    enables a unified cloud-ready platform to facilitate both ongoing and historical
    data management for in- and post-experiment comparison. Figure 6: Open in new
    tabDownload slide Historical experiments and data access. (A) The CropSight system
    provides access to historical experimental datasets, including the geolocation
    of all experiments as well as all plots monitored in a completed experiment. (B)
    In a completed experiment, the last image captured in the experiment and historical
    image- and sensor-based data can be downloaded. (C) The download links for monthly
    image series archived in cloud. Discussion and Outlook The continuing challenge
    of global food security caused by fluctuating environments and a narrower range
    of genetic variation of modern crops requires innovative thoughts and technologies
    to improve crop productivity and sustainability [2, 42, 43]. As European infrastructures
    for sustainable agriculture (e.g., EMPHASIS and Analysis and Experimentation on
    Ecosystems) have identified, openly shareable solutions built on widely accessible
    digital infrastructures are likely to provide an effective solution to address
    the challenge by integrating novel scientific concepts, sensors, and models [44,
    45]. The CropSight system presented here is scalable and open source, providing
    the scientific community a number of interfacing options to adopt and extend.
    The openly available platform integrates high-frequency environmental data and
    crop images automatically, which can be used to enable both phenotypic analyses
    and agricultural decision making. By associating environmental conditions with
    crop growth data, we also trust that the system is capable of forming a sound
    base for reliable GxE studies. More importantly, CropSight provides geolocation
    and remote sensor readings of current and historical experiments, a comprehensive
    solution to enable multi-site and multi-year cross-referencing of crop performance
    and growth conditions. Because CropSight facilitates the real-time access of microclimate
    conditions and crop imagery (through live video streaming) in the field or in
    greenhouses, either through a smart device or an office PC, users can make a quick
    decision of crop performance, growth stages, and plot conditions of any monitored
    location distributed in a given experiment, field, or site. Furthermore, automatic
    data transmission allows for centralized data and experiment management, which
    means that the system can be scaled up to the national scale if a broader IoT
    in agriculture infrastructure is in place. As collected data is annotated and
    pre-selected on distributed phenotyping or IoT devices, only standardized crop-environment
    datasets are collated to support detailed traits analyses and cross-referencing.
    Finally, openly sharing results from different sites and different experiments
    will enable crop researchers, breeders, and farmers to gain great benefits, e.g.,
    predicting and prewarning disease spread at the national scale so that early adoption
    of preventative measures can be arranged. Presently, many governments are shifting
    their focus toward innovative technologies to modernize crop and agricultural
    research. The UK government, for instance, has invested heavily in IoT-based technologies
    to address challenges on yield production, food traceability, environmental issues,
    incompatibility, and lack of infrastructure [46]. We believe that CropSight can
    address some of the current challenges directly. For example, logging historical
    data and annotating crop growth and environmental effects within monitored fields
    can increase crop traceability. To reduce the overall use of agrochemicals as
    part of a precision farming strategy [47, 48], CropSight can be used to identify
    the appropriate timing and areas for chemical application together with infield
    imaging and ambient sensors. Water is in limited supply for large regions of the
    globe, and the reduction of unnecessary irrigation would be of large benefit to
    the cost-effectiveness of agriculture [49, 50]. As discussed previously, CropSight
    is built with near real-time environment monitoring mechanisms including soil
    temperature, soil moisture levels, and ambient humidity. Hence, it can provide
    information crucial to making decisions and targeting irrigation as they relate
    to timing and location. Additionally, by linking extra climate sensors with IoT
    devices, further environmental readings can be extended in CropSight for growing
    agricultural needs. Besides environmental and crop growth monitoring, historic
    and current datasets collated in a central system can also deliver predictive
    powers. An example of potentially predictable situations is the “Smith Period”
    for predicting late blight in potato crops [51]. Late blight is shown to be likely
    to occur during a “Smith Period,” which is defined by a period of two or more
    days with a minimum temperature of 10°C and humidity of 90% or above for at least
    11 hours in each day. Having direct access to dynamic sensor readings on the CropSight
    can make the monitoring of specific environmental patterns much easier and thus
    establish an important tool to inform farmers and growers to apply fungicides
    and chemical treatments to the appropriate areas. Hence, CropSight has a high
    potential to serve sustainable agriculture and environmental friendliness of food
    production under today''s changing climates. Future development To establish a
    data and experiment information management system that is scalable and usable
    on regional, national, or even global crop research and agricultural practices,
    we believe that with further development, CropSight in connection with distributed
    IoT sensors can meet the future demand of usability and scalability. One area
    of expansion is in scalability. The system is currently tested on a local server
    with a direct network connection to at least one of the distributed nodes. To
    allow the expansion at a larger, national, or even global scale, the reliance
    on maintained servers would be less effective than a true cloud-based service.
    Hence, moving the CropSight system to a globally accessible cloud server with
    cloud-enabled distributed storage is a potentially feasible approach that removes
    the requirements for institutions and agricultural practitioners to maintain servers
    and storage. Given the lack of network infrastructure in rural areas in many countries,
    the addition of 3G or 4G mobile data networks to key distributed nodes in the
    field can improve the infield network, upon which the data communication of a
    large number of agri-tech devices can be relied. Another prohibitive factor in
    IoT in agriculture is the quantity and costs of IoT devices required to cover
    an entire field. Based on our three-year field experiments, we believe that installing
    sensors and phenotyping workstations to cover every area in the field is unnecessary.
    Figure 5 shows that the data interpolation approach that is applied can generate
    microclimate readings between randomly positioned stations to model environmental
    variation across the whole field. This subsampling approach has produced high-quality
    environmental readings, which could be used to improve the effectiveness of IoT
    applications in agriculture. Additionally, with the development of national IoT
    infrastructure, the similar subsampling idea can be expanded to a larger and multi-site
    level, which can then truly help inform decision in crop research and agricultural
    practices across a country''s arable land. Availability of source code and requirements

    \ \n \n \nOPEN ACCESS\nSensors 2015, 15 \n17716 \n \n \nKeywords: electrochemical\
    \ impedance spectroscopy; nitrate sensor; microelectronics \n \n1. Introduction\
    \ \nThe advent of smart cities allows sensor owners to register and connect their\
    \ devices to feed data into \nan online database for storage, and to allow developers\
    \ connect to the database and build their own \napplications [1]. Interest in\
    \ smart cities is motivated by major challenges pertaining to sustainable \ngrowth,\
    \ including the growth of urban infrastructure and rising urban populations, which,\
    \ amongst other \nthings, are putting pressures on food production, water supplies,\
    \ and the environment. The need to reduce \ncosts and resource consumption, to\
    \ minimize fertilizer usage in the environment, and to optimize crop \nproduction\
    \ worldwide have motivated the development of low-cost, online digital sensor\
    \ technologies \nfor monitoring the concentration of ionic nutrients in agriculture,\
    \ notably nitrate, phosphate, and \npotassium [2]. Nowadays, the detection and\
    \ identification of nutrients still rely on conventional sampling \nlaboratory\
    \ techniques, which are costly, laborious, and not always suitable for real-time\
    \ monitoring in \nfarm or large-scale industry settings. Therefore, a research\
    \ challenge in this field is focused on the need \nto develop rapid, reliable,\
    \ specific, and sensitive methods to detect and monitor these nutrients  \ncost-effectively\
    \ [3,4], while large scale analysis implies improved miniaturization, reduction\
    \ of analysis \ntime and cost, and multi-ion detection [5]. \nPrecision agriculture\
    \ (PA) is a farming management concept based on observing, measuring and \nresponding\
    \ to field variability in crops [6]. Crop variability typically has both a spatial\
    \ and temporal \ncomponent which makes data acquisition, computational treatments,\
    \ and statistical analysis ubiquitous. \nThe objective of precision agriculture\
    \ research pertains to the ability of optimizing returns on inputs \nwhile preserving\
    \ resources (water, fertilizer, etc.). The practice is enabled significantly by\
    \ the \ndevelopment of digital sensor technologies arrayed across the field that\
    \ communicate in real-time to a \ncentral management system the amount of phosphate,\
    \ nitrate, or potassium in the soil or in other growing \nmedia. The system's\
    \ ability to determine and locate in real-time the precise nutrient content allows\
    \ for \nthe creation of maps of the spatial/temporal variability of nutrient for\
    \ specific crop management, which \nmay be specific to open farm lands, tree nurseries,\
    \ or greenhouse settings, etc. Measuring the spatial and \ntemporal variables\
    \ of crop using an array of nutrient sensors is key to defining smart strategies\
    \ for \nefficient resource use and sustainable growth. \nMany ion sensors or different\
    \ methods have been developed in recent years to perform crop \nmonitoring. Among\
    \ these, Electrical Conductivity (EC) meters have been used extensively to measure\
    \ \nsoil salinity [7], however the lack of ion selectivity for this method makes\
    \ it inadequate for the \nquantitative measurement of specific ions. In addition,\
    \ EC measurement techniques such as Time \nDomain Reflectometry (TDR) and Frequency\
    \ Domain Reflectometry (FDR) relate to the propagation of \na voltage pulse and\
    \ measurement of the reflected wave [8]; however, they are usually power hungry\
    \ and \nprocessor intensive, which are sets of attributes inappropriate for low-cost\
    \ sensors. Digital sensor \ntechnology based on electrical impedance spectroscopy\
    \ (EIS) is becoming a powerful tool in precision \nagriculture because it involves\
    \ a relatively simple electrical measurement that can readily be automated \n\
    and whose results may often be correlated with many complex materials variables:\
    \ from mass transport \nSensors 2015, 15 \n17717 \n \n \nof fertilizers, rates\
    \ of reactions with the growing medium, and local ion concentrations [9]. While\
    \ EIS \nanalysis has been used to perform tasks such as corrosion monitoring [10],\
    \ fuel cell analysis [11],  \nbio-sensing [12], mineral nutrient detection in\
    \ plants [13,14], breast cancer detection [15], and glucose \ndetermination [16],\
    \ this paper describes a novel, low-cost, and portable nitrate sensor based on\
    \ EIS for \nthe determination of trace amounts of NO3− in selected growing media\
    \ used in tree nurseries. The nitrate \nsensor can be integrated to conventional\
    \ digital microelectronics or CMOS platforms to perform online \nnitrate sensing\
    \ continuously, and feed data into a database for storage and analysis. This paper\
    \ describes \nthe structural design, the Nyquist impedance response, the measurement\
    \ accuracy, and the field testing \nof the EIS nitrate sensor performed within\
    \ a tree nursery setting under the International Organization for \nStandardization\
    \ (ISO) and the International Electro-technical Commission (IEC) certifications\
    \ #17025. \n2. Chemistry of the EIS Sensor \n2.1. EIS Nitrate Sensor Structure\
    \ \nThe electrochemical nitrate sensor comprises a set of electrode wires surrounded\
    \ by an ion selective \npolymer membrane, as shown in Figure 1a. The polymer membrane\
    \ is inserted into the growing medium \n(preferably wet) and interacts locally\
    \ with the medium under test. This sensor configuration provides \ntwo different\
    \ electrical conduction paths, one within the polymer membrane and the other into\
    \ the \nmedium under test, depicted as paths 1 and 2 in Figure 1b, respectively.\
    \ The equivalent electrical circuit \nof the sensor is described in Figure 1c\
    \ and Section 3.4. The polymer membrane is composed of high \nmolecular weight\
    \ polyvinyl chloride (PVC—from Aldrich) and of a plasticizer bis(2-ethylhexyl)\
    \ \nphthalate (BEHP—also from Aldrich). PVC-BEHP is an attractive scaffold for\
    \ the development of  \nlow-cost, non-toxic, and chemically-stable sensors, and\
    \ provides ease of fabrication and solubility in \ntetrahydrofuran (THF). Ion-selectivity\
    \ is provided by adding two components to the polymer membrane: \nan ionophore\
    \ and ionic sites. For the nitrate sensor, the ionophore consisted of tetramethyl\
    \  \ncyclotetra-decanato-nickel(II) \ncomplex \n(NiTMTAA), \nand \nthe \nionic\
    \ \nsite \nconsisted \nof \ntrioctylmethylammonium chloride (TOMAC—from Aldrich).\
    \ Both of these have been chosen according \nto the reversibility, selectivity\
    \ (>4 ݌ܭேைయష,஺ష\n௣௢௧\n, where A− stands for NO2−, HPO42−, SO42−, or Cl−) and \n\
    efficiency reported in previous potentiometric studies [17]. All chemicals, except\
    \ the synthetized \nionophore, were reagent grade and used without further purification.\
    \ Together, this polymer membrane \ncomposition can be dissolved into THF and\
    \ molded into any desired shape prior to drying, which brings \nmechanical strength,\
    \ environmental endurance, and abrasion resistance, and which defines a stable\
    \ \nbaseline of electrical conductivity to the system. The membrane exhibits low\
    \ polarity in order to limit \nthe entry of water and ions in the system. Also,\
    \ the plasticizer reduces the glass transition temperature \nTg of the polymer,\
    \ and brings molecular mobility to the membrane; this property is necessary to\
    \ enhance \nthe speed of interaction with the medium under test. \nThe sensors\
    \ were fabricated using a dip-coating process to cover the electrodes uniformly\
    \ with the \npolymer membrane. The electrodes were made from copper wires (923UL-9\
    \ from Consolidated \nElectronic Wire and Cable), and inserted into a 5 mm-diameter\
    \ 100 mm-long alumina rod comprising \ntwo parallel hollow cavities spaced by\
    \ a gap of 0.6 mm. Alumina has been chosen for its dielectric, \nmechanical, and\
    \ chemical strength properties. The copper wires protruded out of the alumina\
    \ rod over a \nSensors 2015, 15 \n17718 \n \n \nlength of 5 mm along which the\
    \ polymer membranes were coated. The dip-coating process consisted of \nimmersing\
    \ the protruding copper wires into a THF-dissolved polymer solution of abovementioned\
    \ \ncomposition, followed by a 24-h drying at room temperature in order to let\
    \ the THF evaporate and the \npolymer membrane solidify. Successive dipping and\
    \ drying were performed until all the electrodes were \nfully covered by a 1 mm-thick\
    \ membrane. \n \nFigure 1. (a) Picture of the polyvinyl chloride-bis(2-ethylhexyl)\
    \ phthalate (PVC-BEHP) \nelectro-chemical nitrate sensor; (b) Schematics of the\
    \ main electrical conduction paths, one \nwithin the polymer membrane and the\
    \ other into the medium under test; and (c) Equivalent \nelectrical circuit of\
    \ the sensor. \n2.2. Medium under Test \nLaboratory measurements were performed\
    \ by immersing the PVC-BEHP electrochemical nitrate \nsensors in 10 mL of KNO3-containing\
    \ (Aldrich—selectophore grade) deionized water (18 MΩ·cm) \nsolutions set at 20\
    \ °C room temperature, while making sure to avoid sensor contact with any glassware\
    \ \nsurface. The sensors were left immersed in the solution for about 5 min to\
    \ provide enough time for \ninteraction and equilibrium with the ions. Field test\
    \ measurements were performed in a white spruce \n(Picea glauca (Moench) Voss)\
    \ seedling tree nursery setting. The measurement method consisted of \nimmersing\
    \ the sensors in about 300 mL of sampled growing medium (peat-vermiculite 80/20%\
    \ v/v, \ndensity of 0.11 g/cm3, pHH2O 3.8, pHCaCl2 3.1, C.E.C. 106 meq/100 g,\
    \ Nmin 53 mg/kg, NNO3 6 mg/kg,  \nP 13 mg/kg, K 20 mg/kg) mixed with water to\
    \ reach saturation at about 92%wt of water content. The \nnitrate measurements\
    \ obtained from the electrochemical sensors were compared with normalized \ncolorimetric\
    \ laboratory measurements, which consisted in sampling, centrifuging, and treating\
    \ the \ngrowing medium using an ISO/IEC 17025-certified methodology described\
    \ in Section 4. \n3. Experimental Setup and Results \n3.1. Measurement Setup \n\
    Impedance measurement and data collection for the PVC-BEHP electrochemical nitrate\
    \ sensors were \nperformed using a Solartron Impedance/Gain-phase Analyzer (model\
    \ 1260A) through an AC frequency \nrange from 1 Hz to 1 MHz. The Solartron measurements\
    \ exhibited less than 5% error in the Real part of \nSensors 2015, 15 \n17719\
    \ \n \n \nimpedance and less than 1.5% in the Imaginary part of impedance, in\
    \ the AC frequency range from  \n1 Hz to 1 MHz, and in the nitrate concentration\
    \ range from 0 ppm to 6000 ppm. The AC amplitude of \nthe driving signal was set\
    \ at 200 mV to provide as low-signal, linear regime, and high S/N ratio as \n\
    possible to the impedance measurements; however, the sensor exhibited impedance\
    \ non-linearity as \nfurther described in Section 3.3. The connection of the Solartron\
    \ Impedance analyzer to the sensor \nfollowed standard procedures described in\
    \ Section 6.5 of the Solartron 1260 [18]. All the probes used \nduring the tests\
    \ were coaxial cables and the accuracy of the measurements was ±1% for the impedance\
    \ \nmagnitude and ±1 degree for phase. The measured impedance referred to the\
    \ real and imaginary parts of \nthe electrical impedance of the immersed sensors:\
    \ Z(ω) = R(ω) + jX(ω), where ω = 2πf, f is the AC \nfrequency of the measurement\
    \ in Hertz, and Z is the compounded sum of resistances R and reactances X \nof\
    \ the immersed sensor. The modulus of impedance is given by ||Z(ω)|| =\n2\n2\n\
    ( )\n( )\nR\nX\nω\nω\n+\nand the phase \nis given by ≮ Z(ω) =\n1\n( )\ntan (\n\
    ( ) )\nX\nR\nω\nω\n−\n. Studying the impedance spectra of the system through a\
    \ wide range \nof AC frequencies provides an objective and quantitative tool to\
    \ assess medium variables such as nitrate \nion concentration and water content,\
    \ which may relate to specific elements of an equivalent circuit model \nfor quick\
    \ processing into useful data [9,19]. \n3.2. Measurement Results \n \nFigure 2.\
    \ Real (a), Imaginary (b), Phase (c), and Nyquist (d) impedance spectra of the\
    \ \nimmersed PVC-BEHP electrochemical nitrate sensors, at 200 mV AC amplitude,\
    \ through a \nwide range of nitrate (NO3−) concentrations using KNO3-containing\
    \ water solutions. \nSensors 2015, 15 \n17720 \n \n \nFigure 2 shows the impedance\
    \ spectra results of the immersed PVC-BEHP electrochemical nitrate \nsensors through\
    \ a wide range of nitrate (NO3−) concentrations, under laboratory conditions using\
    \  \nKNO3-containing water solutions. Measurement stability was reached after\
    \ ~1 min immersion. These \nresults show that the impedance spectrum of the PVC-BEHP\
    \ sensor was strongly dependent on nitrate \nconcentration throughout the range\
    \ 0.01 ppm to 1000 ppm. The measured Nyquist profiles at the range \nof AC frequencies\
    \ from 1 Hz to 1 MHz are indicative of a resistance-capacitance parallel circuit\
    \ behavior \nthat comprises phenomenological constant phase elements (CPE) as\
    \ depicted in Figure 1c. A CPE is a \ncomponent that models impedance elements\
    \ exhibiting distributed materials properties, and has been \nproposed to explain\
    \ the behavior of ionic charges in ionic conductors [20]. A conductivity dominated\
    \ by \nthe polymer membrane (Path 1) is key to obtaining selective nitrate sensor\
    \ response; this  \nmembrane-related impedance was dominant at high frequencies\
    \ and low NO3− concentrations, while the \nimpedance of the medium (Path 2) became\
    \ prominent at low frequencies and high (>100 ppm) NO3− \nconcentrations, which\
    \ leads to a non-selective nitrate sensor response at these conditions. \n3.3.\
    \ Measurement Non-Linearity \nElectrochemical impedance spectroscopy involves\
    \ the study of the variation of the impedance of an \nelectrochemical system with\
    \ the frequency of a small-amplitude AC perturbation. In practice, for the \n\
    impedance measurement data to be reproducible, three main conditions have to be\
    \ fulfilled.  \nLinearity: the applied AC amplitude must be small enough so that\
    \ the response of the system can be \nassumed to be linear, in first approximation,\
    \ but still large enough to measure a response. Although \nhighly reproducible\
    \ under given conditions, the impedance spectra of the nitrate sensors did not\
    \ fulfill \nthe linearity assumption; Figure 3 shows that the recorded spectra\
    \ exhibited a dependency with respect \nto the applied AC amplitude. The sensor\
    \ had to be calibrated at a specific AC amplitude value, which was \nset at 200\
    \ mV with 0 V bias, as lower amplitudes led to poor S/N response and poor measurement\
    \ \naccuracy. Stability: the overall state of the system must not change significantly\
    \ during the acquisition \nof the data. This condition was fulfilled as the sensor\
    \ exhibited a level of impedance stability of about \n±5% during field tests in\
    \ tree nursery settings, over a period of 1 month in air-slit containers of  \n\
    25 square-shaped cavities (320 cm3/cavity, IPL 25-320, IPL Inc., Quebec, QC, Canada)\
    \ filled with \nmoistened 3:1 (v/v) peat-vermiculite. Over this period of time,\
    \ the sensors were subjected to temperature \nfluctuations ranging from −2 °C\
    \ to +29 °C in air, +1 °C to +23 °C inside the medium (obtained from \nthermistors),\
    \ and to a cumulative irrigation of 65 mm (obtained from a rain gauge model No.\
    \ TE525M, \nTexas Instruments). Causality: The measured AC response of the system\
    \ must be directly correlated to \nthe applied AC stimulus. This correlation implies\
    \ selectivity to nitrate. Nitrate selectivity was not \nfulfilled when immersing\
    \ the sensors in medium containing similar concentrations of Cl− ions. As \npreviously\
    \ shown in Figure 2, the impedance of the medium (Path 2) becomes prominent at\
    \ low \nfrequencies and high (>100 ppm) NO3− concentrations, which leads to a\
    \ non-selective response of the \nsensors at these conditions. In order to alleviate\
    \ ion cross-detection and achieve good measurement \naccuracies, this study used\
    \ simple and controlled growing media such as substrates of peat moss and \nvermiculite,\
    \ which relaxed selectivity requirements. \nSensors 2015, 15 \n17721 \n \n \n\

    \ dots) AC \namplitudes, showing the measurement dependency with respect to the\
    \ applied AC amplitude. \n3.4. Equivalent Electrical Circuit \nEquivalent electrical\
    \ circuits greatly aid in the process of fitting observed impedance data for elements\
    \ \nwith distributed properties. The equivalent electrical circuit model that\
    \ represented the AC electrical \nconductivity of the PVC-BEHP electrochemical\
    \ sensor is illustrated in Figure 1c. It is worth mentioning \nthat both the PVC\
    \ (path 1) and medium (path 2) are predominantly dielectric materials in nature\
    \ and \ntherefore exhibited poor DC electrical conductivities. Their electrical\
    \ properties relate to various \ndelocalized electrical carrier conduction mechanisms\
    \ at play in non-crystalline materials such as  \nshort-range carrier mobility,\
    \ defect hopping/trapping, and carrier diffusion, which manifest themselves \n\
    negligibly in DC but may become significant and easily measured at AC frequencies\
    \ in the kHz and \nMHz range [9,20,21]. In this context, the equivalent electrical\
    \ circuit model contained both resistance \nand reactance (capacitive) elements\
    \ which governed carrier mobility over a broad driving frequency \nrange in AC.\
    \ Specifically, the electrical circuit model assigned resistances and capacitances\
    \ related to \nthe nitrate-selective polymer membrane (Path 1: R1, C1) and to\
    \ the non-selective medium under test \n(Path 2: C2-CPE1-CPE2) which comprised\
    \ phenomenological constant phase elements (CPE).  \nThis electrical model could\
    \ be applied accurately for all nitrate concentrations investigated in the present\
    \ \nstudy, as demonstrated in Figure 4. The curve fitting had been done using\
    \ an EIS analyzer software [22]. \nOverall, it can be seen that the electrical\
    \ impedance of the polymer membrane was dominant at high AC \nfrequencies and\
    \ low nitrate concentrations, whereas the electrical impedance of the medium became\
    \ \ndominant at low AC frequencies and high nitrate concentrations. As expected,\
    \ the polymer membrane \nexhibited a negative phase in the impedance spectra indicative\
    \ of a resistance-capacitance material \nresponse (Path 1), which, however, became\
    \ strongly attenuated by the non-selective impedance of the \nmedium at NO3− concentrations\
    \ higher than 100 ppm (Path 2). \nSensors 2015, 15 \n17722 \n \n \n \nFigure 4.\

    \ platform from Analog Devices was used to obtain a low-cost (~$30), \ncompact\
    \ (~8 × 8 cm2), and portable (~10 g) digital sensor technology that could be deployed,\
    \ connected, \nand multiplexed at large scale during field tests. The AD5933 platform\
    \ is a precision impedance converter \ncircuit board that uses an auto-balancing\
    \ method [23,24] for impedance measurements up to 10 MΩ, and \nSensors 2015, 15\
    \ \n17723 \n \n \nthat combines an AC frequency generator from 5 kHz to 100 kHz,\
    \ with a 12-bit analog-to-digital  \nconverter (ADC). The frequency generator\
    \ allows an external complex impedance (i.e., sensor) to be \nexcited with a known\
    \ frequency. The impedance response signal was sampled by the ADC, a discrete\
    \ \nFourier transform (DFT) was processed by the on-board engine, and the results\
    \ were sent to an online \ncomputer for data storage and analysis. The AD5933\
    \ employs a trans-impedance amplifier for \namplifying the current and then uses\
    \ the 1024 point on-chip DFT algorithm for separating the real and \nimaginary\
    \ parts of impedance. After digitalizing with the ADC [25], a discrete-time impedance\
    \ wave,  \nZ[n] (n = 0, 1, 2, …N−1), is obtained by DFT: \n2\n1\n1\n1\nj\n0\n\

    \ the real and imaginary parts of impedance returned by the DFT, \nboth of which\
    \ could be calibrated with respect to NO3 concentration in the medium at a specific\
    \ AC \namplitude, with best calibration resolution usually obtained when using\
    \ the impedance modulus. To our \nknowledge, this is the first time the AD5933\
    \ device was used along with a chemical sensor for \nenvironmental analysis; for\
    \ sake of carefulness this warranted comparison with other known and well \ncalibrated\
    \ impedance meters. As shown in Figure 5, the AD5933 impedance measurements have\
    \ been \ncompared with the Solartron impedance analyzer under the same laboratory\
    \ conditions as described \npreviously, but under a range of frequency limited\
    \ from 5 kHz to 100 kHz according to restrictions \ndetermined by the oscillator\
    \ module within the AD5933 device [26]. The AD5933 device exhibited \nhigher measurement\
    \ errors when operating close to upper or lower frequency limits of 5 kHz and\
    \  \n100 kHz, or far from the 200 kΩ internal calibration resistance. Overall,\
    \ good agreement in impedance \nmeasurements was obtained between the AD5933 and\
    \ Solartron, to within a ±10% comparative error \nlevel, through wide a range\
    \ of nitrate concentrations. The comparative errors were about ±2% at 200 mV \n\
    AC amplitude between 0.1 ppm and 100 ppm nitrate, which was the useful measurement\
    \ range of field \ntests in tree nursery settings. \n \nFigure 5. Comparative\

    \ ISO/IEC 17025 Certifications \nPpm-level measurement sensitivity and accuracy,\
    \ environmental reliability and non-toxicity, and \ncompatibility to ISO certifications\
    \ are attributes sought for defining smart strategies for efficient and \nSensors\
    \ 2015, 15 \n17724 \n \n \nsustainable management of farm lands, tree nurseries,\
    \ or greenhouses. For the nitrate sensors under \nstudy, field test measurements\
    \ were performed in growing medium selected from a tree nursery of white \nspruce\
    \ (Picea glauca [Moench] Voss) species of evergreen coniferous [27,28], shown\
    \ in Figure 6. The \nsensors were inserted into the growing medium and could be\
    \ used and calibrated under different nursery \nconditions, such as (1) in-situ\
    \ under low irrigation conditions (~50%wt water); (2) in-situ after irrigation\
    \ \n(~75%wt water); or (3) after sampling under water saturation (~90%wt water).\
    \ For this study, an \nISO/IEC 17025-certified methodology was adopted [29]. The\
    \ measurement method consisted of \nimmersing the sensors in about 300 mL of sampled\
    \ growing medium (peat-vermiculite 80%/20% v/v, \ndensity of  0.11 g/cm3, pHH2O\
    \ 3.8, pHCaCl2 3.1) in a 600 mL beaker; this growing medium was then mixed \n\
    with deionized water to reach saturation at about 92%wt of water content. The\
    \ nitrate measurements \nobtained from the electrochemical sensor were made at\
    \ that point, and later compared with normalized \nUV-V is colorimetric laboratory\
    \ measurements taken of the same growing medium. The colorimetric \nmeasurements\
    \ consisted of filtrating and centrifuging three samples of growing media, passing\
    \ the \naqueous centrifuged filtrate through a reductive column of copper-coated\
    \ cadmium, and mixing with \nsulfanilamide and N-(1-naphtyl)ethylenediamine dihydrochlorid\
    \ (NED). The reduction changed nitrate \nto nitrite which reacted with sulfanilamide,\
    \ forming a diazonium compound that gave purple coloration \nwith NED, yielding\
    \ a specific optical absorption at 520 nm calibrated to provide a precise nitrate\
    \ \nconcentration. Figure 6 shows the sensor results (made after ~1 min measurement\
    \ time in the sampled \npeat-vermiculite medium) compared to the UV-Vis colorimetric\
    \ laboratory measurements of the filtrates \n(made after ~1 h of filtration, centrifugation,\
    \ and reduction processes). The sensor results are indicative \nof ppm-level measurement\
    \ sensitivity and accuracy for nitrate detection, with much improved ease, \n\
    versatility, and economy as compared to conventional sampling laboratory techniques.\
    \ The real part of \nthe measured sensor impedance provided an accurate correlation\
    \ with ISO/IEC 17025 certified \nmeasurements, in the tested range from 0.4 ppm\
    \ to 130 ppm of NO3− concentration, to within a \nmeasurement accuracy of about\
    \ ±1 ppm (95% confidence level) in the range 1–10 ppm, and about  \n±10 ppm in\
    \ the range 50–100 ppm. \n \nFigure 6. Field test results performed in growing\

    \ precision agriculture allows the feeding of sensor data into online \ndatabases\
    \ for continuous crop monitoring, production optimization, cost reduction, and\
    \ data storage. \nThis paper described a low-cost, compact, and scalable nitrate\
    \ sensor based on electrochemical \nimpedance spectroscopy for the determination\
    \ of trace amounts of NO3− in selected growing media. The \nnitrate sensor can\
    \ be integrated to conventional microelectronics or CMOS platforms to perform\
    \ online \nnitrate sensing continuously over a wide concentration range from 0.1\
    \ ppm to 100 ppm, with a response \ntime of about 1 min, and feed data into a\
    \ database for storage and analysis. The paper described the \nstructural design\
    \ and microelectronics scaling, the ppm-level measurement sensitivity and accuracy,\
    \ and \nthe reliable field testing of the nitrate sensors performed within a tree\
    \ nursery setting under ISO/IEC 17025 \ncertifications, which were attributes\

    automatically detected within 3D point clouds of vineyards. • The algorithm does
    not suffer missing plants and curvilinear vines rows. • The method allows 3D path
    planning for in-field operations of UAVs and/or UGVs. • Point cloud segmentation
    allows to focus from macro (parcel) to micro level (plant) Abstract The adoption
    of new sensors for crop monitoring is leading to the acquisition of large amounts
    of data, which usually are not directly usable for agricultural applications.
    The 3D point cloud maps of fields and parcels, generated from remotely sensed
    data, are examples of such big data, which require the development of specific
    algorithms for their processing and interpretation, with the final aim to obtain
    valuable information about crop status. This manuscript presents an innovative
    3D point cloud processing algorithm for vine row detection and localisation within
    vineyard maps, based on the detection of key points and a density-based clustering
    approach. Vine row localisation is a crucial phase in the interpretation of the
    complex and huge 3D point clouds of agricultural environments, which makes it
    possible to move the focus from a macro level (parcel and plot scale) to a micro
    level (plants, fruits and branches). The algorithm outputs fully describe the
    spatial location of each vine row within the whole 3D model of the agricultural
    environment by a set of key points and an interpolating curve. The algorithm is
    specifically conceived to be robust and: (i) independent of the adopted airborne
    sensor used to acquire the in-field data (not requiring a model with colour or
    spectral information); (ii) able to manage vineyards with any vine row layout
    or orientation (such as curvilinear) and (iii) not hindered by the occurrence
    of missing plants. The experimental results, obtained by processing the models
    of seven case study parcels, proved the algorithm’s reliability and accuracy:
    the automatic vine row detection was found to be 100% in accordance with the manual
    one; and the obtained localisation indices showed an average error of 12 cm and
    standard deviation of 10 cm, which is fully compatible with the considered agricultural
    applications. In addition, the algorithm outputs can be profitably exploited for
    enhanced path planning of autonomous agricultural machines adopted for in-field
    operations. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Questions answered

    Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), also named
    drones, are assuming a key role in the modern farming approach known as Agriculture
    4.0 (Michels et al., 2020, Mammarella et al., 2022a). Indeed, the drones capability
    to autonomously perform in-field operations is being profitably exploited in many
    agricultural scenarios (Peng and Vougioukas, 2020, Thompson and Puntel, 2020).
    The agricultural tasks that currently benefit, or might benefit in the near future,
    from the adoption of autonomous ground and aerial drones can be grouped into two
    main categories: crop monitoring tasks and in-field operations. Remote sensing
    and proximal/close range sensing by UGVs and UAVs have already proved their effectiveness
    in many applications, such as canopy vigour assessment (Campos et al., 2019, Comba
    et al., 2021a, Feng et al., 2020), nitrogen estimation (Colorado et al., 2020),
    plants high-throughput phenotyping traits evaluation (Sun et al., 2020, Xie and
    Yang, 2020), crop mapping (Primicerio et al., 2017, Mazzia et al., 2020), and
    disease or stresses detection (Kerkech et al., 2020, Guidoni et al., 2021, Comba
    et al., 2021b). Concerning in-field operations, valuable solutions based on robotic
    drones involve transplanting and seedling (Nagasaka et al., 2009), pruning and
    thinning (Zahid et al., 2020), weed control (McAllister et al., 2019), and harvesting
    (Bechar and Vigneault, 2017). The effectiveness of the adoption of drones for
    precision agriculture applications is strictly related to the proper knowledge
    of the working scenarios, in terms of both spatial layout (Chen et al., 2020,
    Gao et al., 2020) and crops status and needs. Indeed, the joint contribution of
    such information allows to reach the target and/or to properly modulate agronomical
    operations in a timely fashion (Gil et al., 2013), ensuring, at the same time,
    the required safety (Wang et al., 2020). In this context, to properly achieve
    the tasks, the accurate and reliable path planning and control strategies of the
    drones are thus essential (Dusadeerungsikul and Nof, 2019, Khajepour et al., 2020),
    which involve crucial information such as parcel boundaries and crop location
    (Graf Plessen and Bemporad, 2017, Li et al., 2020). Sensors that are able to provide
    3D models of the agricultural environment can lead to favourable improvements
    in the description of the complex scenarios in which the drones operate (Chakraborty
    et al., 2019, Comba et al., 2019). Some examples of enhanced spatial information
    derived from 3D models regard fruit position for automatic harvesting (Kang and
    Chen, 2020, Wu et al., 2020), canopy shape and size for variable spraying (Llorens
    et al., 2011, Grella et al., 2022), branches location for automatic pruning (Cuevas-Velasquez
    et al., 2020), and crop location for accurate path planning (Jurado et al., 2020,
    Malavazi et al., 2018). Such 3D models are usually in the form of a point cloud,
    which is a set of unordered points in the 3D space. A 3D point cloud can be derived
    by using Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithms (Gené-Mola et al., 2020), Light
    Detection and Ranging systems (LiDAR) (Blanquart et al., 2020), or depth cameras
    (Condotta et al., 2020). However, specific algorithms have to be developed to
    properly extract valuable crop information from raw 3D models (Escolà et al.,
    2017, Sanz et al., 2018), also exploiting artificial intelligence tools (Zhang
    et al., 2021). In this process, an essential phase of the processing algorithms
    is usually the semantic interpretation and segmentation of the 3D point clouds,
    which assign each point to different portions of the whole model. Indeed, many
    applicative examples of semantic interpretation of 3D point cloud for agricultural
    purposes can be found in literature, aimed at detecting portion of the model representing
    leaves, branches, fruits, buds, and other elements (Díaz et al., 2018, Mortensen
    et al., 2018, Zhou et al., 2019, Zeng et al., 2020, Comba et al., 2020a). These
    3D point cloud algorithms have been usually developed to process a single tree,
    or portion of a crop, at a time (Comba et al., 2020b, Gené-Mola et al., 2020,
    Zhang et al., 2021). In order to fully automate the 3D point cloud processing,
    the automatic detection of the crop (e.g. row, plant, trees, etc.) from the 3D
    model of the whole considered agricultural environment is thus required. This
    is a crucial phase in the interpretation of the complex and huge 3D point clouds
    of the agricultural environments, which focuses from a macro level (parcel and
    plot scale) to a micro level (plants, fruits, branches). This manuscript presents
    a 3D point cloud processing algorithm for vine row detection and localisation
    within vineyard maps, based on the detection of key points and a density-based
    clustering approach. The proposed method is completely new, and no methodologies
    for this specific objective have been previously proposed in literature. The algorithm
    provides as an output an ordered set of key points in a 3D coordinate system representing
    the canopy’s central points (which includes the two vine row end points) and a
    curve representing the spatial layout of each vine row in the map. The peculiarities
    of the vineyard scenarios, such as curvilinear vine rows, missing plants or diseased
    vines (which are reflected in the 3D points clouds of the region), require specific
    solutions and prevent the adoption of already available methodologies (e.g. Ester
    et al., 1996 in Matlab®; Weinmann et al., 2015). The unsupervised detection of
    each single vine row within a whole vineyard model is essential not only to enable
    the automatic application of further specific processing algorithms at plant scale,
    but also for in-field path planning purposes. Indeed, the information provided
    by the proposed algorithm can be exploited in automated 3D path planning, which
    is a key task for the automation and optimisation of drone operations in the field
    (Mammarella et al., 2020). By overcoming 2D path planning algorithms, 3D path
    planning fully exploits the terrain’s and environmental characteristics (Jin and
    Tang, 2011, Hameed et al., 2016, Mammarella et al., 2022a, Mammarella et al.,
    2022b). This manuscript is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the experimental
    field and the acquisition campaigns; Section 3 presents the innovative algorithm
    for the vine rows localisation and clustering; the results are presented and discussed
    in Section 4, while the conclusions are reported in Section 5. 2. Case study and
    data acquisition In this work, a set of seven parcels, three of which located
    in Serralunga d’Alba and four in Barolo (Piedmont, Northwestern Italy), was considered
    as a case study and was modelled by dense 3D point clouds. The considered parcels
    have extensions ranging from 0.17 to 0.71 ha, covering an overall surface of about
    3.4 ha, and they are characterised by a sloped land conformation. Six parcels
    (named A, B, D, E, F and G) are cultivated with the Nebbiolo vine variety and
    one parcel (named C) is cultivated with the Moscato vine variety (Fig. 1), using
    a vertical shoot position trellis system. The parcels consist of 21, 33, 13, 35,
    21, 16 and 16 vine rows, respectively. The space between the vine plants and the
    inter-row space was about 0.9 m and 2.5 m in all the considered parcels. Download

    3D point clouds of the seven parcels considered as a case study, located in Serralunga
    d’Alba - Italy (a) and in Barolo - Italy (b). The 3D point clouds were obtained
    by using the Agisoft Photoscan® software (2020, St. Petersburg, Russia), which
    is based on the SfM algorithms, and by processing the UAV-based aerial images.
    The seven point clouds are made by 2.4 up to 10.2 million points and were saved
    in individual.las files with sizes ranging from about 44 Mb to 185 Mb, respectively.
    The mean density of the generated 3D point clouds was about 1450 points per of
    the map surface. A Parrot Sequoia® multispectral camera (Parrot©, 2018, Paris,
    France) was used to acquire the aerial images with a resolution of 1280 × 960
    pixels. The UAV flights occurred in Serralunga d’Alba and in Barolo in 2018 and
    2019 respectively. The height of the UAV flight was maintained close to 35 m with
    respect to the terrain by planning a set of waypoints, which were defined on the
    basis of the vineyards geographic information system map with the drone mission
    planning and flight control software (UgCS, 2021). A forward and side overlap
    greater than 80% was guaranteed between adjacent images to help the images alignment
    process. Prior to the alignment of the images, a radiometric calibration was performed
    on the images by using the reference images of a Micasense calibrated reflectance
    panel (Seattle, Washington, USA), which were acquired before and after each UAV
    flight. It should be noted that the obtained 3D point clouds of the vineyards
    used in this study had neither colour nor spectral information, so that only the
    spatial information provided by each point was exploited by the proposed processing
    method. This approach was introduced to make the proposed processing algorithm
    unaffected by the type of airborne sensor or by the spectral difference that could
    characterise different vineyard environments during the growing season. 3. 3D
    point cloud processing method The developed algorithm, which automatically detects
    and localises each single vine row within the 3D point clouds of the vineyards,
    has two main outputs: (i) an ordered set of key points representing the canopy’s
    central points in a 3D coordinates system (which includes the two vine row end
    points) and (ii) a curve representing the spatial layout of each vine row in the
    map. The vine rows detected within the 3D point cloud are automatically sorted
    and numbered (from southwest to northeast), and the algorithm also provides their
    length, altitude difference and average orientation with respect to the west to
    east direction. The algorithm, which is based on a sequence of operations sketched
    in the flowchart in Fig. 2, can be divided into three main phases: (1) the detection
    of a set of points representing the centre of the vine canopies, (2) the clustering
    of the central points in groups, each one representing a single vine row, and,
    finally, (3) the sorting and refinement procedure to define a set of ordered key
    points, essential to determine the curves describing the location of each vine
    row. The specific peculiarities that characterise the 3D point clouds of the vineyards,
    which prevent the adoption of already available processing algorithms, are discussed
    in detail in each processing phase, together with the innovative solutions that
    have been envisioned. Please note that, in the here presented new point cloud
    processing method, some specific steps of the algorithm presented in Comba et
    al. (2018) (the aim of which is the detection of parcel boundaries) have been
    exploited. These processing steps are represented by the two green highlighted
    blocks of the flowchart in Fig. 2. Download : Download high-res image (392KB)

    exploited in the proposed new method, has been highlighted in green. (For interpretation
    of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
    web version of this article.) 3.1. Central points detection The first phase of
    the algorithm is the detection of a set of points , representing the canopy central
    points of the vine rows, which is obtained by processing the raw dense 3D point
    cloud of the vineyard. This first step allows the main information of the canopy,
    required in the second and third steps, to be extracted from the raw 3D point
    cloud. In addition, this processing phase reduces the amount of model instances
    to be processed in the subsequent steps and, thus, speeds up the second and third
    computing phases. This processing phase, named Step 1, is represented in the left
    part of the flowchart in Fig. 2. The central points were detected by processing
    several subsets of the whole vineyard 3D model, which were defined by a scanning
    approach (also called mobile window approach). This approach, firstly introduced
    in Comba et al. (2018), in this work has been significantly updated as described
    below. In Comba et al. (2018), with the aim to identify the vineyard parcels boundaries,
    the raw 3D point cloud ( ) was scanned with a mobile window by selecting different
    cylindrical regions (named , centred in and with radius . The scanning procedure
    proceeds with a vineyard likelihood test, which is performed on each cylindrical
    region and provides the following outputs: (1) the angles and , which identify
    the parallel and perpendicular direction with respect to the local vine row orientation,
    (2) the local inter row distance and (3) the subset section . With the term local,
    the centre of the cylindrical region was here considered. For a complete discussion
    about this procedure, please refer to Comba et al. (2018). In Fig. 2, this processing
    phase is represented by the two green highlighted blocks of the flowchart, and
    its outputs are exploited in some specific subsequent phases, as represented by
    the green arrows. An example of the outputs of this procedure is reported in Fig.
    3a-3c. In particular, the cylindrical region (centred at m with a radius m), is
    highlighted in Fig. 3a (green dots) within the surrounding 3D model (grey dots)
    and enlarged in Fig. 3b. Also, the subset was reported in Fig. 3b (red dots),
    which was selected by using the angle value . The angle is measured anticlockwise
    from the axis on the horizontal plane. Download : Download high-res image (731KB)

    histogram (blue line) with detected local maxima (green line); (e) detected central
    points (green line) of the canopy in the original 3D point cloud (grey dots) and
    the entire set of central points of canopy (blue dots). (For interpretation of
    the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
    web version of this article.) In the processing algorithm presented in this work,
    subset sections are here exploited in a new way by detecting the canopy central
    points . In particular, this was performed computing and analysing the density
    distribution of the points within section which, for definition, intersects several
    vine rows. Indeed, the angle used for section detection, represents the perpendicular
    direction with respect to the local vine row orientation. To detect the central
    points , a Local Reference Frame was introduced, whose origin is located in (centre
    of the cylindrical region) and with the and axes parallel and perpendicular to
    the vine row respectively. The coordinate was chosen to be equal to the local
    elevation of the digital terrain model. The density of the 3D point subset was
    thus assessed by computing the normalised frequencies distribution histogram of
    the points along the axis. (1) with , where is the set of all the histogram bins
    and is the bins width. In Fig. 3c and 3d, the sample subset of points and its

    origin, expressed in the coordinates. For example, the detected local maxima in
    the density histogram are reported in green in Fig. 3d, while the detected vine
    row centres are highlighted in green in Fig. 3e. In the example of Fig. 3, four
    local maxima , , and were detected, which led to the four canopy central points

    cloud, a set of central points of all the vineyard canopies can be obtained, where
    is the overall number of computed central points. To simplify the discussion of
    the next steps of the algorithm, the projection of the central points on the 2D
    plane will be considered, as shown in Fig. 3e with blue dots. All the results
    can be reported in the original 3D system by restoring the DTM, considering the
    local terrain elevation as the z coordinate of the points. The results obtained
    by processing the entire 3D point cloud of Fig. 1a are reported in Fig. 4. Download

    Variables and are outputs defined in Comba et al. (2018). The set of canopy central
    points obtained by the proposed new method, together with the additional information
    regarding the vineyards local features provided by Comba et al. (2018) (the local
    vine row direction and of the local inter row spacing , which can be properly
    organised in maps) will be used in the following algorithm phases, called Step
    2 and Step 3 (Fig. 2). 3.2. Density-based central points clustering The obtained
    set of the canopy central points is, in this phase, still unordered and unclustered.
    Indeed, the central points provided by the previous processing phase are not associated
    to any specific vine row and their position within the vine row is not related
    to their generation order. To detect the location of each vine row, a clustering
    and sorting procedure of the central points is thus required. The output of this
    second phase of the algorithm is indeed a set of point clusters , with , and where
    is the number of the detected vine rows. This processing phase, named Step 2,
    is represented in the central part of the flowchart in Fig. 2. It should be noted
    that the points within set , representing a single vine row, are characterised
    by a particular spatial layout that has a predominant dimension (vine row length)
    with respect to the inter-group distance (here represented by the inter-row path
    width). However, the occurrence of missing and/or diseased plants leads to vine
    row interruptions that, in some cases, can be more extended than the inter-row
    path dimension. Indeed, considering an inter-row path ranging between 2 and 3
    m and with a vine plants distance ranging from 0.9 to 1.2 m, as shown in Fig.
    5a, the occurrence of two consecutive missing and/or diseased plants can lead
    to the absence of key points in a portion of the vine row longer than the inter-row
    path; this causes all the available 3D point cloud clustering methods (such as
    fuzzy clustering, partitioning methods, hierarchical clustering or standard density-based
    algorithms), to fail (Biosca and Lerma, 2008, Chen et al., 2022, Li et al., 2022).

    process. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend,
    the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) The proposed enhanced
    density-based clustering approach performs an iterative clustering procedure which
    defines small subsets of points representing portions of vine rows, and merging
    them sequentially when specific criteria are fulfilled. Considering the algorithm
    iteration , a subset of points centred in and within an elliptic Region of Interest
    (ROI) was defined as. (4) where are the coordinates of the central point , while
    and are the local inter-row width and vine row orientation in . The values of
    and parameters, which are outputs of the method presented in Comba et al. (2018),
    have been derived from specific maps. In Fig. 4b and 4c, the sample maps of the
    local vine row direction and the local inter row spacing obtained by processing
    the entire point cloud , are reported. Alternatively, the neighbourhood can also
    be defined as. (5) if the Local Reference Frame (defined with its origin in and
    with axes and tangent and perpendicular to the local vine row orientation , respectively)
    is considered. An example of the points selected with the elliptic ROI is represented
    in Fig. 5a, while its enlargement is reported in Fig. 5b. Then, depending on the
    status of points belonging to , four scenarios of cluster assignment can occur.
    In the first scenario (case A), when the points within do not belong to any previously
    defined vine row cluster , a new cluster is defined. In the second scenario (case
    B), at least one point within the subset belongs to a single, already defined
    cluster and, thus, and are merged forming the (updated) cluster . The third scenario
    (case C) is an extension of case B and occurs when some (or even all) the points
    within belong to more than one cluster, such as and . In this case, all the clusters
    are merged with the oldest one, together with , updating as and discharging the
    cluster . Please note that the merging procedure performed in clustering cases
    B and C leads to growing clusters, which are no more bounded by an elliptic ROI.
    The fourth scenario (case D) concerns a subset with all the points belonging to
    a single, already defined cluster : in this case, no operations are performed.
    The iterative procedure is repeated until at each central point a subset has been
    assigned for the proper clustering task. A graphical representation of three sample
    clustering iterations (belonging to cases A, B and C, respectively), is reported
    in Fig. 5. The elliptic ROI was introduced to improve standard density-based clustering
    approaches, which exploit circular/spherical ROIs. Indeed, in order to avoid obtaining
    clusters with multiple vine rows, the maximum value of the circular ROI radius
    is limited to a fraction of the inter-row path dimensions. In this way, however,
    a single vine row could be wrongly represented by many clusters, if missing and/or
    diseased plants occur. The length of the major semi axis of the ROI allows thus
    to overcome this limit. Please note that, during the initial phase of the clustering
    process (when cases A are more frequent than cases C), the number of overall clusters
    can exceed the number of vine rows to be detected. This trend is reversed during
    the second part of the clustering process, when the number of clusters decreases
    (as cases C is more frequent than cases A and B), finally settling to the detected
    vine rows number . 3.3. Vine rows key points detection and ordering With the final
    aim of defining a continuous curve representing the spatial location of a single
    vine row, the central points in the cluster have to be refined. Indeed, no methods
    exist that can interpolate a set of unordered points in the space, which can be
    generated by a not injective function (De Boor, 1978, Kong et al., 2021). This
    is the case of central points representing vine rows with any layout within a
    map (e.g. curvilinear). A viable solution to this problem can be the adoption
    of recent approaches for interpolating an ordered set of points within the space,
    which requires the central points to be ordered (D’Errico, 2021). In addition,
    the general vine row layout prevents the application of a simple ordering procedure
    of the central points based on a single direction (such as along the x or y axes
    of the main reference frame). A refinement of the central points is introduced
    in this last phase of the algorithm in order to obtain a set of key points that
    are ordered, less dense and more equally spaced along the vine row. This processing
    phase, named Step 3, is represented by the right part of the flowchart in Fig.
    2. The proposed procedure is based on the following idea: one central point is
    randomly selected from and then, starting from it, the vine row is scanned towards
    the two end points. More in detail, the developed algorithm is as follows: Randomly
    selection of the first key point. REPEAT: Detection of new key point as. UNTIL:.
    Detection of vine row end point as. Repeat: Detection of new key point as. Until:.
    Detection of vine row end point as. End An example of this task applied to vine
    row 16 is reported in Fig. 6. The threshold was introduced to avoid the selection
    of a new key point too close to and its value was set to 2 m to guarantee the
    generation of key points with a density compatible with the proper description
    of a vine row with a general layout (also curvilinear). Indeed, this value is
    usually much lower than the inter-pole distance in trellis systems, which limits
    the vine row curvature. At each iteration of the algorithm , the minimisation
    problem is solved considering the central point represented in the Local Reference
    Frame , introduced and defined in section 3.2, with origin in key point This allows
    to simply define the two direction of scan of the cluster towards the two vine
    row end points by introducing the conditions and , respectively. The algorithm
    is thus iterated until the two end points of the vine row are detected, that happens
    when, at the generic iteration no points can be found outside the radial threshold
    distance In this case, the threshold check is omitted and the farthest point from
    is selected as the end point of the vine row. When both the end points have been
    detected, the scanning procedure is then considered complete (Fig. 6c). The output
    of this processing phase for the vine row is thus an ordered set of key-points
    , with and being the two ends of the vine row. An example of the result of this
    processing phase, applied to sample vine row 16, can be seen in Fig. 6d. Download

    this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
    Finally, a unique id number is assigned to each detected vine row within a parcel.
    Once the ordered set of key points is defined for each vine row, the curve interpolating
    them can be retrieved by the distance-based interpolation function developed by
    D''Errico (2021) and implemented in Matlab (Fig. 7). Further outputs of the algorithm
    are the individual vine row length, average orientation angle, and altitude difference.

    the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) 3.4. Algorithm performance
    indices To assess and quantify the performance of the proposed vineyard 3D point
    cloud processing method, two families of indices were defined: the first group
    aimed at properly quantifying the performance of vine rows detection (indices
    1, 2 and 3) and the second at evaluating the accuracy of the vine rows localisation
    (indices 4, 5 and 6). The indices definitions are detailly reported in Table 1.
    For indices computation, a set of line class objects was manually drawn by using
    the QGIS software, each one aligned with a single vine row to be considered as
    reference detection and localisation of vine rows (ground truth). The procedure,
    which was performed on a plan view of the 3D point cloud, provided the latitude
    and longitude coordinates of each manually drawn point ( ) defining the line object.
    The altitude of each point was then retrieved by the local digital terrain model
    (DTM), which was provided by Agisoft Photoscan® software. Please note that the
    quantity of points representing the location of the -th vine row provided by the
    algorithm ( ) and by the manual procedure ( ) may differ. As an additional reference,
    in Parcel F, the position of all the vine rows end points ( and ) were acquired
    in the field by the S900A Stonex GNSS (Stonex, 2021) with centimetre accuracy.

    parcel F (Fig. 1b). Regarding the algorithm performances in detecting the vine
    rows, the obtained results showed a Good detection index of 100%, and both Extra
    detection and Missed detection indices equal to 0%. This is related to the fact
    that all 155 vine rows within the seven considered parcels were properly detected
    and no vine rows were wrongly found. These three performance indices of detection
    (indices 1, 2 and 3 of Table 1) were computed by comparing the algorithm output
    with a visual inspection of the considered point clouds and an in-field survey.
    Concerning the accuracy of the vine row localisation, the three indices Euclidean
    Distances between End Points (DEP) (index 4), Euclidean Distances of Enhanced
    Key-points (DEK) (index 5) and Curves Overlapping Factor (COF) (index 6) were
    computed for every detected vine row (Appendix B). The histograms of the obtained
    values are reported in Fig. 9 and their average and standard deviation, grouped
    by processed parcels as well as the overall vine rows, are reported in Table 3.
    The average DEP index of each considered parcel varied between 0.07 (Parcel A)
    and 0.17 (Parcel D) meters, with standard deviations of 0.04 and 0.14, respectively.
    Considering the entire processed dataset, the average DEP index was 0.12 m with
    a standard deviation of 0.10 m. The obtained values of DEP index proved that the
    algorithm is able to properly detect the end points of the vine rows in an automatic
    way from a vineyard 3D point cloud. Please note that, for Parcel F, the DEP index
    was computed also by considering the points ( and ) acquired by the GNNS. In this
    additional accuracy evaluation, obtained average DEP index was 0.28 cm. Such error
    is mainly due to the difference between the vine row end point definition, which
    is the canopy edge for the algorithm and the pole trellis location for in field
    GNNS measurement. Considering the DEK index, the obtained average values of each
    parcel were in the range between 0.04 and 0.06 m with standard deviations of about
    0.01. The average COF index of the parcels varied between 0.03 and 0.06 m with
    standard deviations of about 0.01. Both the DEK and COF indices quantify the error
    between each vine row location, expressed by the algorithm key points and the
    manual ones. The obtained values proved that the accuracy of the algorithm is
    high in detecting the vine rows location along their whole extensions. All the
    quality indices values, which are in the order of a few centimetres, show that
    the algorithm outputs, in term of vine row location, are compatible with the requirements
    of precision agriculture operations, such as UGV path planning and autonomous
    guidance (Donati et al., 2021). Download : Download high-res image (225KB) Download

    on a 2.9 GHz 6-Core Intel Core i9, with 32 GB DDR4 RAM memory of 2400 MHz. The
    average computing time for processing a point cloud with a density of about 1500
    points/ and representing a 1 ha vineyard was about 90 min. 5. Conclusions In this
    work, an innovative 3D point cloud processing algorithm for vine row detection
    and localisation within a vineyard map, based on the detection of key points and
    a density-based clustering approach, was presented. The algorithm provides as
    outputs, in a fully automated way, an information set which fully describes the
    spatial location of each vine row, even when not straight, within the whole 3D
    model of the agricultural environment. This is a crucial phase in the interpretation
    of the complex and huge 3D point clouds of agricultural environments, focusing
    from a macro level (parcel and plot scale) to a micro level (plants, fruits, branches).
    The algorithm does not require colour or specific spectral vine information and
    is therefore independent of the adopted airborne sensor used to acquire the in-field
    data or imagery. In addition, the proposed approach proved to be robust to any
    occurrence of missing plants and any vine row layout and orientation, including
    curvilinear or not straight rows. The unsupervised detection of each single vine
    row within a whole vineyard model is essential not only for enabling the automatic
    application of further specific processing algorithms at plant scale, but also
    for in-field path planning purposes. The information provided by the proposed
    algorithm can be exploited in automated 3D path planning, which is a key task
    for the automation and optimisation of UGV operations in the field (Mammarella
    et al., 2022b). Indeed, by overcoming 2D path planning algorithms limits, 3D path
    planning fully exploits the terrain’s and environmental characteristics. Funding

    Change ((ATSC)) Abstract In recent years, smart farming is gaining popularity
    largely because of the introduction of high-precision technology tools, which
    are more accurate, cost-effective and user-friendly in adoption. These new innovative
    technologies include remote sensing, Global Positioning System (GPS), Geographic
    Information System (GIS), field sensors, artificial intelligence and automated
    machinery, big data, etc. Geospatial technologies emerged as one of the main sources
    for the generation of voluminous big data through various platforms of satellites,
    manned/unmanned aircrafts and ground-based installations. Smart farming uses various
    technologies like high-resolution satellite data, GPS, GIS, field sensors, artificial
    intelligence and automated machinery, etc. Further, trending technologies like
    drones, the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing play a significant role
    in smart farming. Big data by virtue of its velocity, volume, value, variety and
    veracity is increasingly developed and used in various fields including agriculture.
    Big data has immense potential in smart farming like real-time weather monitoring,
    soil moisture monitoring, automated irrigation systems, inputs monitoring, crop
    monitoring, pest monitoring, etc. Since both big data and smart farming are emerging
    fields, the chapter attempts to provide the knowledge and awareness of their applications
    and implications to the researchers, farmers and other stakeholders to effectively
    leverage the potential of these emerging technologies to optimize the farm resources
    and improve overall farm productivity. Access provided by University of Nebraska-Lincoln.

    up to 70% by 2050 against the increasing population of 9.6 billion by 2050 [10].
    On the other hand, the challenges from climate change in the form of increasing
    temperatures, weather variability, shifting agro-ecosystem boundaries, invasive
    pests and extreme weather events are affecting agriculture production [15]. In
    the context of pressure on land resources to enhance food production on one side
    and adverse impacts of climate change on the other, there is a need to adopt smart
    agriculture practices, where geospatial and big data technologies play an important
    role. Smart agriculture is a key tool to primarily handle and manage the threats,
    challenges and risks in the context of climate change, diseases and pest attacks
    and ensure sustainability. Smart farming practices include identification and
    localization of crops, insects and weeds; performance monitoring; machinery; variable
    rate of fertilizers, herbicides, insecticides and fungicides; planting monitoring
    and mapping [6]. Smart agriculture uses the knowledge of information science,
    environmental science, computer engineering, Geographic Information System (GIS),
    Global Positioning System (GPS), remote sensing technology and virtual satellite
    imaging for better integration with soil, climate, environment with agriculture
    [36]. In recent decades, due to the continuous development of Internet technology,
    various data explosions took place, among them, sensing technology and cloud computing
    technology play an important role in smart farming. These two technologies revolutionized
    the amount of data generated, stored, analyzed and utilized on the basis of storage
    technology and cloud computing technology. The development of earth observation
    and sensing technology, especially satellite remote sensing, has made massive
    remotely sensed data available for research and various applications in smart
    farming [7, 20]. Spatiotemporal data derived from remote sensing are a valuable
    resource for smart farming to potentially generate voluminous big data and perform
    historical trends. Agricultural remote sensing is one of the backbone technologies
    for smart agriculture, which considers within-field variability for site-specific
    management instead of uniform management as in traditional agriculture. Big data
    can be defined as the dataset that are too large, complex and exceeds traditional
    datasets for its acquisition, storage and management and analysis [47]. Big data
    is emerging as a potential technology for farm-level decisions to enhance farm
    productivity by detecting and overcoming cumbersome practices. Advantages of big
    data are high-speed transactions, provide access to large amounts of data and
    user can perform several operations simultaneously [34]. Smart agriculture uses
    the ICT, modern machinery equipment, Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing,
    machine learning and big data analytics for crop’s vegetative growth intercultural
    operation, climate-smart management, harvesting, post-harvest management and marketing
    management. In the IoT, wireless technologies play a central role in data gathering
    and data communication [1]. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and radio-frequency
    identification (RFID) are considered the two main building blocks of sensing and
    communication technologies for IoT [11, 22]. Wireless sensor networks’ sensors,
    smart devices, RFID tags, tablets, palmtops, laptops, smart meters, smart phones,
    smart healthcare, social media, software applications and digital services generate
    the volume of data [22]. They continuously generate large amounts of structured,
    semi-structured and unstructured data, which are strongly increased in the field
    of smart agriculture. The combination of geospatial and big data applications
    in smart farming plays important role in various farm operations. Geospatial Technologies
    and Their Components Geospatial technologies comprise photogrammetry, satellite
    remote sensing, GIS and GPS, which have immense potential in the collection, analysis
    and interpretation of spatial data in the field of agriculture. These play a vital
    role in providing precise information on the nature, extent and spatial distribution
    of agricultural resources to assess their potential and limitations for planning,
    monitoring and management toward sustainable development [30, 32]. Remote sensing
    integrated with GIS provides an effective tool for the analysis of land resources
    at macro, meso and microlevels, which could potentially enhance the management
    of critical areas [35]. Several geospatial technologies are actively being used
    in the management of natural resources, including remote sensing from terrestrial,
    aerial and satellite platforms with various sensors, GPS and GIS [19]. The aerial
    and satellite remote sensing techniques by virtue of their speed and cost-effectiveness
    have an edge over conventional methods of the survey in mapping, monitoring and
    detecting the temporal changes in land degradation. High-resolution remotely sensed
    data provide an unparalleled view of the earth for studies that require synoptic
    or periodic observations such as inventory, surveying, mapping and monitoring
    in land resources, land use/land cover and environment. The integration of spatial
    data and their combined analysis could be performed through GIS and simple database
    query systems to complex analysis and decision support systems for effective land
    resource management. Agricultural remote sensing is a highly specialized field
    to generate images and spectral data in huge volume and extreme complexity to
    drive decisions for agricultural development. In the field of agriculture, conducted
    various remote sensing data-based studies in monitoring soil properties, crop
    stress and development of decision support systems in fertilization, irrigation
    and pest management to enhance crop production. Remote Sensing Information on
    the nature, extent and spatial distribution of various agricultural resources
    is a prerequisite for achieving sustainable agriculture. The advances in remote
    sensing technology provide data for detailed inventory and mapping of natural
    resources at different scales. A wide variety of satellite remote sensing data
    from Landsat OLI, IRS-P6, Cartosat-I, Cartosat-II, QuickBird, Sentinel-2 and Google
    are now available to the earth scientists for the generation of spatial databases
    on natural resources for various applications. Since remote sensing may not provide
    all the information needed for a full-fledged soil and land resource assessment,
    field survey and other ancillary information from various sources are needed to
    be integrated with remote sensing data. Various satellite sensors and their image
    characteristics are shown in Table 2.1. Table 2.1 Important multispectral and
    hyperspectral satellites, sensors and their image characteristics Full size table
    Remote sensing technology allows us to observe the earth’s features from space,
    and users can analyze the information collected from remote sensing of our interest.
    The advances in remote sensing technology offer data for detailed inventory, mapping
    and monitoring of agricultural resources at a large scale. A wide variety of satellite
    remote sensing data from MODIS, Landsat-ETM+, IRS-IC, IRS-ID, IRS-P6, Sentinel,
    Cartosat-I Cartosat-II, QuickBird and Google are now available to the users for
    the generation of the spatial database on agricultural resources for various applications.
    These technologies are extensively used in land use/land cover changes, precision
    agriculture, yield estimation and other need-based agricultural applications.
    However, remotely sensed data coupled with field observations and contemporary
    technology provide more realistic datasets as compared to image interpretation
    alone. In this age of the twenty-first century with advancements in the computer
    field and in the field of geographic information systems, the resource management
    issues in smart agriculture are to be dealt with more efficiently, effectively
    and a convincing way by applying these geospatial technologies rather than the
    traditional methods of management. In land resources’ applications, there are
    a wide range of satellite platforms providing imagery at multiple resolutions
    with frequency at the global to local scale. Microwave remote sensing is highly
    useful, as it provides observation of the earth’s surface, regardless of day/night
    and atmospheric conditions. Spaceborne microwave remote sensors provide perspectives
    of the earth’s surface and atmosphere, which are of unique value in studies of
    geomorphology, topography and vegetation classification. Hyperspectral remote
    sensing imagers acquire many, very narrow, contiguous spectral bands throughout
    the visible, near-infrared, mid-infrared and thermal infrared portions of the
    electromagnetic spectrum enabling the construction of an almost continuous reflectance
    spectrum for every pixel in the scene. Geographic Information System (GIS) GIS
    is defined as a powerful set of tools for collecting, storing, retrieving at will,
    displacing and transforming spatial data [5, 33]. GIS is a computer system capable
    of capturing, storing, analyzing and displaying geographically referenced information,
    i.e., data identified according to location. A true GIS is designed to accept,
    organize, statistically analyze and display diverse types of spatial information
    that is geographically referenced to a common coordinate system of a particular
    projection and scale. GIS is a potential tool for handling voluminous remotely
    sensed data and can support spatial statistical analysis, presentation of spatial
    data in the form of a map, as well as storage, management, modeling of input data
    and presentation of model results [31]. Data derived from the latest remote sensing
    and information technology techniques could be effectively integrated in GIS to
    perform the analysis. Applications of GIS range from simple database query systems
    to complex analysis and decision support systems. GIS techniques are playing an
    increasing role in facilitating the integration of multilayer spatial information
    with statistical attribute data in the sustainable management of agricultural
    resources. Global Positioning System (GPS) GPS has revolutionized research in
    the areas of surveying, engineering, monitoring positions and navigation [28,
    45]. GPS technology enables real-time data collection and accurate position information,
    which in turn leads to efficient analysis and manipulation of large amounts of
    geospatial data in smart farming. For mapping, where surveying accuracy better
    than a meter is required, specialized DGPS techniques have been developed. These
    techniques are being employed increasingly for detailed topographic, soil, geological,
    engineering and environmental-related surveys at different scales. GPS-based surveying
    systems allow surveys to increase accuracy in mapping over conventional surveying
    techniques. GPS plays a significant role in field data collection, surveying and
    monitoring the crops on a periodical basis. GPS provides current position, anywhere
    and at any time on the globe, with a reasonable degree of accuracy. In the field
    of smart agriculture, GPS technology can help to map the relief, farm boundaries
    and assets more precisely, which serves as a “baseline” for further farm decision
    activities. Tractor-mounted GPS with variable-rate applicators’ farmers can identify
    locations that are nutrient deficient and apply the appropriate amounts of fertilizer
    in specific locations to enhance the fertilizer efficiency and improve the crop
    production in smart agriculture. Big Data and Its Components Big data is described
    as a collection of data that is extremely large and cannot be collected, processed,
    stored and calculated within the time required by traditional data processing
    methods or tools. Big data represents the information assets characterized by
    high volume, velocity, variety, veracity, variability and value to require specific
    technology and analytical methods for its transformation into value. Big data
    is being used to provide predictive insights in smart farming operations, drive
    real-time operational decisions and redesign business processes for game-changing
    farm operations. Big data consists of large datasets (volume), which have different
    types of datasets. Velocity consists of the speed by which information moves through
    the system, where data flow into the system from multiple sources. A variety of
    data can be found in big data, which is often unique because of a wide range of
    both the sources being processed and their relative quality. Veracity helps to
    evaluate the quality of data and processing quality of result analysis. Variability
    includes variation in the data that leads to wide variation in quality, where
    additional resources can be used to identify, process or filter low-quality data
    to make it more useful. To measure the value of data, the big data ecosystem deals
    with boundless processes and approaches both in structured or unstructured data.
    Agricultural big data is mainly used in agricultural condition monitoring, agricultural
    product monitoring and early warning, precision agricultural decision-making and
    the construction of a rural comprehensive information service system [14, 40].
    Big data is considered a potential technology for the assessment of farm-level
    decisions, policy decisions and market-distorting actions for increasing the productivity
    in agriculture properly. Big data technology in agriculture can collect and analyze
    lots of data, which are usually generated from various sectors and stages in agriculture.
    Big data-driven agriculture provides an opportunity to transform traditional decision-making
    to database decision-making. Cloud computing platforms are efficient ways of storing,
    accessing and analyzing datasets on very powerful servers, which virtualizes supercomputers
    for the user. These systems provide infrastructure, platform, storage services
    and software packages in a variety of ways for the customers [7, 21]. Google earth
    engine (GEE) is a big data cloud computing platform, and it facilitates scientific
    discovery processes with free access to numerous remotely sensed datasets to perform
    various geo-big data analytics in the field of agricultural applications [12,
    39]. GEE provides various functions to perform spectral and spatial operations
    on either a single image or a time-series images. Different operations within
    the GEE platform range from simple mathematical operations to advanced image processing
    and machine learning algorithms. The important GEE applications in smart agriculture
    are real-time weather monitoring, terrain analysis and landform mapping, digital
    soil mapping, soil moisture monitoring, automated irrigation systems, crop identification
    and monitoring, yield monitoring and mapping, pest monitoring and surveillance
    and variable-rate technology (VRT) which are briefly summarized (Fig. 2.1). Fig.
    2.1 Potential applications of GEE cloud computing platform in smart farming Full
    size image Applications of Geospatial and Big Data Technologies in Smart Farming
    In smart farming, geospatial technologies like high-resolution remote sensing,
    GIS, GPS and field sensors play an important role in the reorganization of spatial
    variations at individual farm level and to address those using appropriate strategies.
    Weather Monitoring One of the biggest challenges for smart farming is climate
    change and its impact on crop productivity and farm operations. In smart farming,
    farmers essentially need accurate information on various weather parameters like
    rainfall, temperature, humidity and weather forecasts. A wide range of ground,
    aerial and space-based earth observation platforms are available to collectively
    enable real-time weather observation and dynamic monitoring of accurate, comprehensive,
    continuous and diverse information on weather parameters. Automatic weather station
    (AWS) provides information on various meteorological parameters, which include
    rainfall, temperature, humidity and soil moisture for better-informed decisions
    in smart farming. By collecting the data on time-series various weather parameters,
    one can analyze the climatic trends by using data analytics tools in GIS to assess
    the climatic conditions for smart farming. As an example, the mean annual trends’
    rainfall of Nagpur district of Maharashtra, India, was analyzed for the period
    from 1960 to 1990 and 1991 to 2020. The analysis shows that there is a slight
    change in the mean annual rainfall pattern in the district over a period of 60
    years. The mean annual rainfall in the eastern regions of the district shows a
    decreasing trend, and it has an impact on agriculture and crop production (Fig.
    2.2). Fig. 2.2 Mean annual rainfall pattern of Nagpur district, Maharashtra, India,
    during 1961–1990 and 1991–2020 Full size image Terrain Analysis and Landforms
    Mapping Integration of satellite-based remote sensing with photogrammetry, GIS
    and GPS has enhanced its capabilities in the area of agricultural resource management
    and solving environmental problems very rapidly and efficiently in comparison
    to others [18]. Remote sensing integrated with GIS provides an effective tool
    for the analysis of land resources at macro, meso and microlevels, which could
    potentially enhance the management of critical areas [35]. High-resolution remotely
    sensed data provide an unparalleled view of the earth for studies that require
    synoptic or periodic observations such as inventory, surveying, mapping and monitoring
    of land resources, land use/land cover and environment. Traditional mapping approaches
    are qualitative interpretation with inherent limitations associated with fieldwork
    and human interventions and domain knowledge. Nowadays, with access to fast computers
    and digital sources such as digital elevation models (DEMs) acquired by remote
    sensing, landforms can be analyzed and mapped digitally. In digital terrain parameterization,
    various attributes such as elevation, slope, aspect, plan and profile curvature
    and flow accumulation were analyzed and mapped [24] to obtain distinct landforms
    units. Relatively recent advances in geospatial technologies and developments
    in numerical modeling of surface processes have revolutionized the field of geomorphology.
    The digital terrain modeling approaches help to quantify landscape morphology
    [13, 26], assess surface biophysical conditions [38], landform process [2] and
    improve the landform mapping accuracy. The automatically extracted landforms from
    digital terrain modeling of SRTM (30 m) data for basaltic terrain of Central India
    are shown in Fig. 2.3. Fig. 2.3 Delineation of landforms through digital terrain
    modeling in basaltic terrain of Central India Full size image Digital Soil Mapping
    Intimate knowledge of the kind of soils and their spatial distribution is a prerequisite
    in developing site-specific land-use plans in smart farming, irrigation scheduling,
    drainage management, etc. Space technology plays a significant role in digital
    soil mapping efforts. Digital soil mapping involves the quantitative prediction
    of soil properties by using some observed soil data and some soil-forming factors
    [8]. Advances in digital soil mapping have created a tremendous potential and
    transformed the procedure and the way the soil maps are produced [23]. However,
    in general, soils appear to be more continuous variables than discrete objects
    [27]. Therefore, the conceptualization of various terrain variables as discrete
    objects involves uncertainties. Such variables are best predictors through the
    fuzzy logic approach and minimize the uncertainties. The application of fuzzy
    logic models in digital soil mapping requires the establishment of knowledge bases
    to define the fuzzy membership criteria. For digital soil mapping, the fuzzy logic
    approach uses the principle that a spatial unit, e.g., a pixel, can contain soil,
    which cannot be exclusively classified into one soil class. Membership values
    in fuzzy mapping can be determined using deterministic or empirical approaches.
    Digital soil mapping begins with the development of a numerical or statistical
    model of the relationship between environmental variables and soil properties,
    which is then applied to a geographic database to create a predictive map. Digital
    soil mapping helps to exploit the relationship between environmental variables
    and soil properties in order to more efficiently collect soil data, produce and
    present data that better represent soil-landscape continuity and explicitly incorporate
    expert knowledge in model design. Soil parameters’ map developed through digital
    soil mapping with raster grid allows better characterization of soil-landscape
    variability, which in turn significantly helps to formulate land-use plans in
    smart farming based on the spatial variability of soil characteristics. Soil Moisture
    Monitoring In smart farming, soil moisture is a fundamental factor that is used
    to control the water management system for sustained crop yield. Agricultural
    UAV or drone platforms become one of the most promising technologies utilized
    in soil moisture monitoring. The agricultural UAV with a combination of IoT sensors
    can detect moisture conditions of the soil and helps in the identification of
    zones that suffer from water scarcity and dryness of soil profile [37]. Such information
    helps the farmers to take appropriate interventions such as irrigation scheduling
    and amount of water to be released. High-resolution satellite imageries can be
    effectively used for monitoring soil moisture and assessment of surface moisture
    conditions in real time across the entire surface, rather than for a single point
    like the soil moisture, and weather sensors provide soil moisture. It is important
    to build time-series soil moisture data for individual fields to interpret and
    understand the spatial patterns as soil type and texture affect the soil physics
    of moisture and storage. Real-time monitoring of soil moisture helps to generate
    timely soil moisture information and inform crop management decisions, such as
    fertilizer inputs, yield mapping and pest risk assessment in smart farming. Automated
    Irrigation Systems An automated irrigation system does the work without the involvement
    of many manual operations by using computers and sensors. A rule-based expert
    system helps to save the water a lot, where field sensors collect and analyze
    data by an automated program, and accordingly, required water is supplied to the
    required part of the farm. An IoT-enabled, remote-controlled cross-platform system
    equipped with big data analytics and intelligent irrigation scheduling can be
    accessed through web and mobile applications, which are hosted on the enterprise
    cloud. These systems control the operation and help in crop field assessment for
    irrigation and applying fertilizers and pesticides. An automated irrigation system
    using WSN and General packet radio service (GPRS) module could be used to optimize
    the use of water for crops [16]. This system works based on the distributed wireless
    sensor network with soil moisture and temperature sensor in WSN. Gateway systems
    could be used to transfer data from the sensor unit to the base station, send
    commands to the actuator for irrigation control and manage data of the sensor
    unit. The traditional techniques like drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation
    adopted in smart farming can be combined with IoT-based systems to improve water-use
    efficiency. IoT helps to access information and make major decision-making processes
    by getting different values from sensors like soil moisture, water level sensors
    and water quality. Crop Identification and Monitoring Geospatial and big data
    technologies enable us to identify and monitor crop conditions on a periodical
    basis. High-resolution satellites and drones are capable of collecting spatial
    data on various parameters of crops that help in analyzing and monitoring the
    current crop health. Drones equipped with various types of high-frequency sensors
    are capable of capturing and transmitting the data on the go. Drones can identify
    crop growth by comparing time-series images taken by the satellite and can assist
    farmers to reduce excessive use of water and reduce the chemical load on the environment
    by spraying required pesticides on the plant require. Object-based image analysis
    techniques [3, 44] provide an innovative approach to perform image segmentation
    with similar spectral signatures into objects to classify. IoT-based crop monitoring
    provides a data-driven approach with the use of sensor devices, gateway connectivity
    and a user-friendly dashboard to identify and monitor the crops in real time.
    Yield Monitoring and Mapping In fully mechanized farming systems, grain yield
    monitors are continuously monitored and measured in the clean-grain elevator of
    a combine. When systems are coupled with a GPS receiver, yield maps can be prepared
    with the help of yield monitors, which significantly helps in making sound management
    strategies. In yield mapping, soil, landscape and other environmental factors
    should also be weighed. The yield information provides insights into determining
    the effects of managed inputs. Various metrological factors like precipitation,
    temperature, humidity and solar light were used for crop yield maximization and
    to improve the quality of crops by considering real-time data and ML algorithms
    [25]. GPS sensors can be mounted on harvesting equipment to fetch the spatial
    coordinates and generate a crop yield map. Pest Monitoring and Surveillance Recent
    advances in remote sensing technology and geospatial image processing using drones
    have enabled the rapid monitoring, detecting and surveillance of insect pests
    and diseases in smart farming [42]. For detection of the occurrence and monitoring
    of pests and diseases on farms, remote-sensing technologies like satellites and
    drones can be employed to find insect pests and inform farmers of the state of
    affairs promptly [46]. In smart farming, an automatic insect identification system
    with various sensors can be built for insect and pest detection on crops through
    image analysis. Low-altitude remote-sensing technology like drones has the characteristics
    of high flexibility and image definition which can be deployed in pest and disease
    monitoring for crops. The deep learning and image process models enable us to
    identify any crop diseases or pest infestation within the crops [43]. The application
    of deep learning algorithms is an innovative method for image processing and object
    detection in the classification of various crop diseases [17]. Smartphone-based
    AI-powered applications could alert farmers and expedite disease diagnosis, potentially
    preventing or limiting pest and disease outbreaks. The IoT technology used to
    monitor pests and diseases has not yet fully developed as a unified standard in
    terms of services and equipment development. Variable-Rate Technology (VRT) Variable-rate
    technology (VRT) is an integral part of smart farming that allows data to be used
    effectively both in time and space. It combines the necessary farm equipment,
    control mechanisms and software tools to apply required quantities of inputs at
    specific times or locations to optimize fertilizer-use efficiency. Farm inputs
    like fertilizers, agrochemicals and irrigation water can be applied and monitored
    at different rates across a field, without manually changing rate settings on
    equipment. By utilizing geospatial technologies like GIS, GPS and field variability
    maps, VRT helps to increase the input efficiency, minimize overapplication of
    inputs and reduce the risk of pesticide and fertilizer runoff or leaching into
    water sources. Tractor-mounted sensor-based VRT utilizes sensors effectively to
    assess crop or field variability to provide real-time variable-rate application
    (VRA) of inputs. Geospatial and Big Data Technologies in Smart Farming—Challenges
    In the field of geospatial and big data technologies, the acquisition and creation
    of valuable data need strong hardware and software infrastructure for seamless
    data collection, quality, storage and integration. It would need high-performance
    computing for subsequent data processing, analysis and effective management of
    big data. Availability of reliable, timely and quality of spatial and non-spatial
    data is often a challenge in smart farming applications. Interoperability becomes
    the most important point of concern in a seamless flow of information [9]. This
    involves a number of issues like technical, semantic, syntactic and organization
    interoperability to be addressed [4, 41]. Designing high-performance systems is
    essential for easy access to distributed data by different users. Big spatial
    data computing requires modern computing and analytical methods to analyze the
    unevenly distributed data originating in real time from different locations. The
    innovative open-source cloud platforms like GEE can be used to access services
    to analyze voluminous data. In data-driven smart farming, data privacy issues
    and rights to data usage are quite obvious. The lack of data governance and suitable
    policies in place hinders data privacy and security. Hence, privileged access
    to big data and building trust with farmers should be a starting point in developing
    robust applications in smart farming. Since big data is from various sources in
    the agriculture supply chain, multistakeholder collaboration is needed for improved
    decisions and quick access to the right data to evaluate key performance indicators
    in building successful applications. Geospatial and Big Data Technologies in Smart
    Farming—Opportunities Some of the emerging opportunities of geospatial and big
    data applications in smart farming are to design and develop GPS-enabled tractors.
    These systems help to find out soil quality and quantity of crops from different
    areas of the field and determine how much fertilizer is to be applied in each
    part of the field. Such systems help the farmers to accurately navigate to specific
    locations within the field to collect soil samples or monitor crop conditions.
    As per requirement, different sensors can be established in the field to acquire
    the required data in real time. An environmental monitoring system can be implemented
    for real-time measuring temperature, humidity, illumination and soil moisture
    by using an array of sensors. Smart greenhouse helps to monitor temperature, humidity
    and soil moisture to change the climate conditions according to the requirement
    of plants for effective growth. These smart greenhouses minimize the human efforts
    in handling the operations. There is an ever-increasing awareness of the necessity
    to develop and apply robotic systems in agriculture, forestry, greenhouses, horticulture,
    etc. Smart robotic vehicles are capable of working round the year in all weather
    conditions and have the intelligence embedded within them to behave sensibly in
    a semi-natural environment, unattended while carrying out many useful tasks in
    smart farming. In smart farming, farmers take final decisions using various strategies
    and different services. In this process, all the decisions are based on the previous
    result and different algorithms come into the action to analyze the previous results
    and enable the user to take the final decision in smart farming operations. In
    the supply chain, perishable and sensitive materials such as seeds, plants and
    food products prevent spoilage which is a matter of concern, where big data has
    proven useful at various stages. At the production stage, automated systems handle
    data to show performance and reveal issues in critical equipment. Big data helps
    farmers and suppliers optimize fleet management to increase delivery reliability.
    Big data tracking solutions, smart meters and GPS-oriented analytics improve routing,
    cutting transportation costs and offering advanced mapping of the locations. The
    other common challenges are the big data life cycle in different applications,
    such as the appropriate data identification, data deployment, data representation,
    data fusion, as well as data visualization and interpretation. A Way Forward The
    convergence of multiple technologies such as geospatial, big data, AI, IoT and
    cloud computing has a significant impact on various operations and applications
    in smart farming. In smart farming, there are several processes, which demand
    higher energy input, and markets require products of high quality. Such a process
    can be classified according to the requirement, technology and applications. AI
    can augment automation and cost reduction and enhance revenue. ML algorithms can
    overcome human limitations in terms of speed, accuracy, reliability, consistency
    and transparency in performing the assigned tasks. Robotics associated with AI
    need intelligence to handle tasks like object manipulation and navigation in conjunction
    with subproblems of localization, motion planning and mapping. IoT is used mainly
    for the automation of equipment and application development using data analytics.
    In IoT-based smart farming, monitoring crop fields with the help of sensors and
    automating the irrigation systems are possible, where farmers can monitor and
    control the farm conditions from a remote. IoT enables farmers to take a data-driven
    approach to collect vast amounts of information from instrumented sensors about
    the status of their farms to improve farm yield and mitigate risks from weeds,
    pests and diseases. The advanced sensing technologies that can be deployed for
    smart farming include proximal, airborne and satellite-based sensors. The use
    of mobile and smart phone technologies in smart farming could be effectively used
    in harnessing the full potential in the communication space. Several smart phone
    applications are available for agriculture, horticulture and farm machinery to
    make farm operations smarter and easier. Conclusions The integration of remote
    sensing data with GIS, machine learning and deep learning offers great potential
    for better extraction of geographical information from remote sensing data and
    images. With the increased volume and complexity of remote sensing data acquired
    from multiple sensors using multispectral and hyperspectral devices with multiangle
    views with time, new development is needed for visualization tools with spatial,
    spectral and temporal analysis. Temporal satellite data have become valuable tools
    in studying the spatial extent of degraded lands and for mapping and monitoring
    the changes that have taken place over a period of time due to reclamation/conservation
    measures. Smart farming powered by geospatial and trending technologies like AI
    with big data analytics, IoT, AI, ML and DL immensely helps in making farming
    smarter with good profit margins. In data-driven smart farming, big data access,
    the availability of quality data, big spatial data computation, spatial data integration,
    data privacy and rights to use data are some of the important challenges. On the
    other hand, these technologies offer immense opportunities in smart farming. Farmers
    can access the facilities of the greenhouse through the dashboard, and operations
    can be managed by using voice commands. In a smart farming supply chain, the use
    of big data is found to be immensely useful at all stages. The geospatial technologies
    in conjunction with data science techniques have immense potential in spatiotemporal
    analysis of land resources and land transformation processes, which in turn helps
    to plan and manage them for optimum utilization of land resources to achieve sustained
    production levels and food security. References Abdmeziem, M.R., Tandjaoui, D.,

    View Full Text PDF Abstract Presently there is a massive enhancement in technologies,
    and a lot of things, appliances, and techniques are accessible in the agriculture
    sector. One of the famous techniques is known as IoT. Several applications of
    IoT are evident in the field of agriculture for the benefit of the farmers and
    in turn for the successful development of the nation. IoT is used in agriculture
    to improve productivity, efficiency, and the global market. It also helps farmers
    to reduce manpower, cost, and time. In this chapter, the authors are discussing
    IoT with the cloud for enhancing smart farming. Smart farming is a concept that
    is focused on providing the agricultural industry with the infrastructure to leverage
    advanced technology including big data, the cloud, and the internet of things
    (IoT) for tracking, monitoring, automating, and analyzing operations. IoT with
    the cloud is used in various fields of agriculture to improve time efficiency,
    water management, crop monitoring, and land management. It protects the crops
    from pests and is also used to control pesticides in agriculture. Request access

    The current and future era of smart computing rely enormously on the application
    Internet of Things (IoT) in various areas. In current scenario, IoT is playing
    a vital role to transform Traditional Technology from normal life to official
    life everywhere you will find computer. IoT is getting importance in research
    across the world however it is popular for wireless communications. Basically
    IoT is a term, which is use for finding uniquely identical objects, things and
    their respective virtual representations in the internet. Kevin Ashton is known
    as father of IoT. Initially IoT was used for chain management, after 2008, it
    scope has enhanced and its development being used in various products such as
    smart living, education, medical, organization etc. In current era, it is being
    used for business (like smart education, agriculture, health care), manufacturing,
    smart devices and machines. One of the head areas where IoT research is ongoing
    and lots of products have lunched, various new products will be lunched to make
    the activities process smarter, easiest and effective towards for better production
    is “Agriculture”. Agriculture (Ali Hasnain, 2021) sector is one of the sectors
    that is ensure food and food security for livings. If taking Indian Farmer, who
    are facing lots of trouble due to farm size, transportation issues, shortage of
    technology, trade, climate, pest etc. No doubt, ICT work on lots of problem for
    providing its solution to farmers (Chettri & Bera, 2020), infect ICT based techniques
    have resolved some problems however that are not enough for efficient production.
    Now ICT has migrated with IoT, and this migration is known as “Ubiquitous Computing”.
    Agriculture production based on lots of different activities such as soil and
    plants monitoring, water management mentoring, moisture and temperature monitoring,
    transportation supply management, infrastructure management, animal and pest control
    monitoring. IoT based agriculture is a convergence technology, which is used to
    create high volume in terms of production quantity, and quality, simultaneously
    it reduced production cost and manpower. Applying IoT in agriculture field data
    is collected with the help of GPS and sensors (Dinh et al., 2017, García et al.,
    2020) (smart sensors), and it is processed by the integration techniques of smart
    farming along with Big data. With the help of smart farming (Islam et al., 2021)
    Farmers are capable to improve crop yields as well as make it effective (Anjali
    et al., 2018). As par the current scenario of agriculture that is surrounded by
    lots of issues, it must be resolved by IoT based smart farming. To build smart
    farming in real world, requirement is to develop time to time IoT based products
    on very fast face. Continue Reading References Follow Reference A Smart Information

    \ \n \n1. \nINTRODUCTION \nAgriculture has been considered as the primary means\
    \ of reducing poverty and improving food \nsecurity of the world’s 80% of impoverished\
    \ people who live in rural areas as per the World Bank reports. \nMoreover, agriculture\
    \ contributes to around 25% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in some developing\
    \ \ncountries [1]. Globally, the agricultural industry has been adversely affected\
    \ by increased droughts, floods, \nerratic precipitation patterns, and heat waves\
    \ brought on by climate change. Additionally, the high population \ngrowth rate\
    \ and the existing climate-related impacts on agricultural lands, agricultural\
    \ areas are under more \npressure to provide enough food [2]. To satisfy the increasing\
    \ food demand, available agriculture land must be \nutilized effectively such\
    \ that sustainable and healthy crops are produced. However, traditional intensive\
    \ \nagricultural practices are causing land degradation and lead to relatively\
    \ lower yield [3]. Furthermore, the \nfarmers are unaware about climate changes\
    \ and market fluctuations in real-time ending up with inappropriate \nsupply of\
    \ required crops. Cost of per yield production is increasing due to inefficient\
    \ utilization of resources \n[4]. For example, the fertilizers and pesticides\
    \ are used extensively without the precise requirement.  \n        \n \n    \

    \ 2023: 1597-1605 \n1598 \nThe shortcomings are addressed by the application of\
    \ information and communication technologies \n(ICT) to agriculture, widely known\
    \ as smart agriculture [5]. Smart agriculture comprises extensive ICT \ninfrastructure\
    \ that generates enormous amounts of data that can be utilized to improve the\
    \ traditional agriculture \npractices [6]. Smart agriculture employing big data,\
    \ ICT and internet of things (IoT) has transformed the \ntraditional experience-based\
    \ agriculture and has gained much attention from researchers. Numerous studies\
    \ are \npresented in the literature that provide specific application of smart\
    \ agriculture including crop forecasting [7], \n[8], pest identification [9],\
    \ [10], precision farming [11], [12], irrigation monitoring [13], [14], smart\
    \ \ngreenhouses [15], [16], and supply-chain [17], [18]. But relatively few studies\
    \ cover all stakeholders of \nagriculture.  \nThis research is an attempt to present\
    \ an effective, complete and scalable framework for smart \nagriculture; Agri-PAD.\
    \ The layered framework focuses on three major components of big data agriculture\
    \ \napplications. The first layer is responsible for sensing real-time data from\
    \ sensors and is called the perception \nlayer. The second layer, called the data\
    \ procession layer, stores and processes the data. The third, and the final \n\
    layer comprises various applications which are available to all stakeholders to\
    \ maximize the agri-productivity. \nThe major contributions of this reseach are\
    \ summarized below: \n− We propose a comprehensive big data analytics framework;\
    \ Agri-PAD that facilitates agriculture activities \nby offering three broad categories\
    \ of applications that is precision, recommendation and enterprise. \n− We demonstrate\
    \ the implementation of Agri-PAD framework for crop prediction and crop \nrecommendation.\
    \ \n− We discuss major challenges that hinder adoption of smart agriculture widely.\
    \ \nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: section 2 discusses big data\
    \ role in agriculture,  \nsection 3 describes the related work, section 4 explains\
    \ the Agri-PAD framework, section 5 presents potential \nuse cases of Agri-PAD\
    \ framework. Section 6 discusses open challenges in the adoption of big data in\
    \ \nagriculture while section 7 concludes the paper. \n \n \n2. \nBIG DATA IN\
    \ AGRICULTURE \nBig data is termed as a technological paradigm for data. It refers\
    \ to massive, heterogeneous, structured, \nsemi-structured and unstructured datasets\
    \ that includes text, images, videos, and audios [19]. Big data is \nconsidered\
    \ as the data generated at high velocity, high volume, and with high variety that\
    \ require advanced \ntechnologies and algorithms for processing [20]. Big data\
    \ definitions have evolved rapidly; the following five \ndimensions have emerged\
    \ as common criteria to illustrate big data: \n− Volume: the enormous amounts\
    \ of digital data generated and collected every second from a billion of \ndevices\
    \ and applications.  \n− Velocity: the speed of data creation and generation.\
    \  \n− Variety: the diversity of the data types, sources and their format (e.g.,\
    \ videos, documents, comments, and \nlogs). \n− Veracity: The truthfulness, reliability\
    \ and accuracy of the data and their sources.  \n− Value: the usefulness of the\
    \ collected data i.e., the insights that can be extracted from the big data. \n\
    Big data is more inclined towards the capability to search, aggregate, visualize\
    \ and cross-reference \nlarge datasets in reasonable time to extract information\
    \ and insights which was previously not feasible, both \neconomically and technically\
    \ [21]. Big data applications are utilized in almost every field; engineering,\
    \ \nmathematics, computer science, business, management and accounting, biochemistry,\
    \ genetics, physics and \nastronomy to name a few [19].  \nBig data in agriculture\
    \ has immensely evolved the traditional agricultural practices [5]. Major sources\
    \ \nof big data in agriculture include: \n− On-field sensors which provides real\
    \ time insights about farm (biosensors and weather stations).  \n− Airborne sensors,\
    \ data captured from drones and satellites. \n− Data collected by governmental\
    \ agencies and third-party organizations such as yearly statistical reports, \n\
    rules and regulations. \n− Data from web available via online repositories, web\
    \ services, and social media feeds. \nIt is evident that the data produced by\
    \ above-mentioned sources are heterogeneous in nature with \nvaried level of volume,\
    \ velocity and variety. However, efficient storage, processing and analysis of\
    \ such diverse \ndata for extracting valuable information such as precision farming\
    \ is guaranteed by the big data proponents \n[22]. Big data technologies that\
    \ can be used for such applications include Hadoop distributed file system \n\
    (HDFS), HBase, Cassandra, Spark, Hive, tensorflow and many others [23]. \n \n\

    Climate change and growing population are turned out as serious threats to food\
    \ security and major \nchallenges for agriculture [24]. The total agricultural\
    \ land utilized for food production has experienced a decline \nand with time\
    \ the gap between demand and supply has become more significant [25]. To meet\
    \ this rising \ndemand, farmers need to produce approximately 70% more food by\
    \ 2050, according to the UN food and \nagriculture organization (FAO) [26]. Consequently,\
    \ the agriculture industry adopted technological trends and \ntransformed into\
    \ smart agriculture. Smart agriculture comprises of IoT, cloud computing, big\
    \ data, and artificial \nintelligence improves crop yield, reduces waste, and\
    \ optimizes supply chains [27].  \nVarious studies have been conducted for improving\
    \ productivity in agriculture using smart agriculture \nsolutions. Sarker et al.\
    \ [5] proposed a conceptual framework incorporating big data technologies to facilitate\
    \ \nfarmers at field level. Their proposed solution is a seven-stage model that\
    \ encompasses extracting data from \nthe sensors and explains how that big data\
    \ might assist in accomplishing sustainable agriculture. Liu et al. [28] \nproposed\
    \ an experimental framework to monitor different agricultural aspects such as\
    \ water, fertilization, \ntemperature using IoT and cloud computing. Their framework\
    \ is capable of acquiring, persisting and \nprocessing sensor data which would\
    \ help in satisfying farm needs as and when required. A smart agriculture \nmonitoring\
    \ system for the detection of soil temperature and moisture was presented in Mekala\
    \ and Viswanathan \n[29]. Analyzing the data with a stated accuracy of 94%, the\
    \ proposed cloud-based solution may enable efficient \nmonitoring of specific\
    \ crop comfort levels and might be an accurate and useful decision tool for farmers.\
    \ \nCicioğlu and Çalhan [30] introduced an IoT enabled corn production monitoring\
    \ system. The proposed solution \nmonitored the cornfield for soil and air attributes\
    \ via different sensors and provides crucial information through \ngraphical interfaces\
    \ about growth of corn, requirement of water and the actions to be taken for disease\
    \ risks. \nVincent et al. [31] targets the land suitability assessment and proposed\
    \ a recommendation model that classifies \nthe land suitability by employing machine\
    \ learning models on the big data produced by sensors. The system \nassists farmers\
    \ in classifying the land for cultivation in more suitable, suitable, moderately\
    \ suitable, and \nunsuitable classes. To increase crop production and to control\
    \ the agricultural cost, Rajeswari et al. [32] \npresented a smart agricultural\
    \ model that predicts the crop yield and choose the best crop sequence based on\
    \ \nprevious crop sequences on the same farmland and soil nutrient data. \nApart\
    \ from crop monitoring, researchers have employed advanced technologies to especially\
    \ improve \nthe irrigation processes. Tseng et al. [33] proposed a big data analysis\
    \ technique to assist farmers in crop \nselection. They used a three-dimensional\
    \ correlation analysis to analyze the irrigation cycle and determine the \nfarmer's\
    \ irrigation techniques. The soil moisture content was then computed to identify\
    \ irrigation and determine \nwhether the farmer had used pesticides or fertilizers.\
    \ Nawandar and Satpute [34] proposed an intelligent system \nfor smart irrigation\
    \ intending to preserve water resources. Bu and Wang [35] presented a deep reinforcement\
    \ \nlearning based smart agriculture system which aims to reduce extraneous water\
    \ consumption. Further, \nKamienski et al. [36] proposed smart water management\
    \ architecture for an efficient water irrigation system. \nThese irrigation systems\
    \ track the water requirements of crops based on collected data and actuate water\
    \ flow \nin line with expected demands without any human involvement.  \nThe application\
    \ of smart agriculture is not limited to automating the traditional practices\
    \ and reducing \nhuman involvement, but also includes fully automated farms that\
    \ can be operated without any human \nintervention [37], [38]. These systems exploit\
    \ agriculture big data in a robust and effective way. However, \nadoption of these\
    \ unmanned farms is still in its infancy and a number of issues such as governmental\
    \ and data \nsecurity legislations are yet to be addressed.  \nDespite the challenges,\
    \ big data remains the driving force behind smart agriculture. The data collected\
    \ \nvia sensors and other IoT devices provides detailed insights to the farmer\
    \ leading to better decision making and \neffective utilization of resources.\
    \ The aforementioned solutions prove that big data technologies have the \npotential\
    \ to revolutionize the agriculture industry. However, each of these solutions\
    \ has limited scope and is \nfocused on a single aspect of agricultural activity.\
    \ To fully utilize the potential of smart agriculture, there is a \nneed for a\
    \ platform that integrates all agricultural activities and provides a holistic\
    \ view to all stakeholders. \nKeeping in view the limitations of existing solutions\
    \ we propose a framework-Agri-PAD that includes the \ncomplete lifecycle of agriculture\
    \ activities and enables all stakeholders in making informed decisions. The \n\
    following sections describe the details of Agri-PAD framework. \n \n \n4. \nAgri-PAD\
    \ THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK \nThis section presents Agri-PAD, a smart agriculture\
    \ framework that encompasses major agriculture \nactivities. The integration of\
    \ various services in a single framework ensures that all stakeholders are facilitated\
    \ \nand that a broad view of the system is presented, which eventually helps in\
    \ better decision making. The Agri-\nPAD framework offers a systematic classification\
    \ of services and applications leveraging big data analytics. \nThe Agri-PAD framework\
    \ consists of three layers i) perception layer, ii) data processing layer and\
    \  \niii) application layer as depicted in Figure 1. The Agri-PAD framework is\

    \ \nreal-time data streams. It incorporates a wide variety of techniques and technologies\
    \ to aggregate, manipulate, \nanalyze, and visualize big data. The details about\
    \ each layer are described in the successive subsections.  \n \n \n \n \nFigure\

    \ layer \nThe perception layer is the first layer of Agri-PAD framework. This\
    \ layer is horizontally scalable and \nincludes all data sources as mentioned\
    \ in section 2. Big data sources in agriculture can be broadly categorized \n\
    into IoT devices (ground sensors, weather stations, and airborne sensors), social\
    \ media posts, and web-based \ndata i.e., the data stored in databases. The data\
    \ will be acquired from each source and make available to the \nnext layer for\
    \ further processing. \n \n4.2.  Data processing layer  \nThe data processing\
    \ layer is the fundamental layer that acts as a data processing engine. It handles\
    \ \neverything from data storage to knowledge extraction. It first transforms\
    \ the data into an analysis-ready format. \nThen, apply big data tools and technologies\
    \ to extract relevant insights. Data will be processed in  \nApache Hadoop [19],\
    \ [39] ecosystem as it offers scalable platform for storing, managing and processing\
    \ big \ndata. Table 1 summarizes the applications provided by Hadoop. Moreover,\
    \ it incorporates any programming \nlanguage that offers processing of artificial\
    \ intelligence algorithms. \n \n4.3.  Application layer \nApplication layer is\
    \ the topmost layer of Agri-PAD framework. This layer is the key layer that \n\
    interacts with the users and provides services to the farmers and other stakeholders.\
    \ The layer consists of \nmultiple applications that are classified as precision,\

    \ monitoring their farms remotely. Soil, weather, and crop conditions can \nbe\
    \ observed without being present on the farm. The requirement of pesticides and\
    \ fertilizers can be precisely \ndetermined. Farmers will also receive notifications\
    \ and alerts about the particular need of their farm. With these \nIndonesian\

    \ by using such applications. Understanding how management choices affect \nsustainability\
    \ and operational efficiency, improving smallholder farmers' productivity and\

    DISCUSSION AND POTENTIAL USE CASES \nAgri-PAD framework aims at providing a real-time\
    \ view of major agriculture activities along with \nvaluable insights and recommendations.\
    \ The shared platform will provide big data applications to the farmers, \ncrop\
    \ experts, market owners and other appropriate decision makers. The farmers can\
    \ monitor their farms and \ncan communicate data with crop experts and other consultants\
    \ in real time. These consultants can evaluate the \ndata and give expert advice.\
    \ Market owners can effectively forecast the needs and utilize the available resources\
    \ \nefficiently while decision makers can make more productive long-term decisions.\
    \ The following sub-sections \nprovide use-cases employing big data analytics\
    \ on the popular agriculture activities. \n        \n \n       ISSN: 2502-4752\

    1602 \n5.1.  Crops production forecasting \nCrops production forecasting application\
    \ is an enterprise application type of the Agri-PAD \nframework. Accurate and\
    \ timely forecasting of crop yields is significant for food security and planning\
    \ of \nagricultural markets. Historical big data can be used in predicting the\
    \ actual need for the years to come. To \nevaluate the efficacy of Agri-PAD framework,\
    \ we have used the production data of crops cultivated in Pakistan. \nThe statistical\
    \ production data of all four provinces of Pakistan have been collected by agriculture\
    \ marketing \ninformation service (AMIS), directorate of agriculture (economics\
    \ and marketing) Lahore, Punjab. We have \nused 7 major crops data which includes\
    \ wheat, cotton, rice, sugarcane, maize, ground nut and barley. The \ndataset\
    \ includes the production of the crops and area available for crop cultivation\
    \ in the respective province.  \nThe selected dataset was divided in training\
    \ and testing sets with 80:20 ratio. The training set was \nused to establish\
    \ model to predict production of crops while the test set was used to test the\
    \ quality of the \nmodel. Random forest algorithm was applied having 1097.2 RMSE.\
    \ Figure 3 illustrates the accuracy of the \nmodel which clearly indicates that\
    \ the model outperformed with nearly equal actual and predicted values for \n\
    each crop. Crop production forecasting is essential for policy makers to make\
    \ timely decisions and Agri-PAD \nframework has the tendency to incorporate historical\
    \ data from different resources and generate effective crop \nproduction estimates\
    \ that can be used as agricultural production warnings in food-insecure regions.\
    \ Thus, \nempowering decision makers to plan expeditiously. \n \n \n \n \nFigure\
    \ 3. Actual production vs. predicted production of crops \n \n \n5.2.  Crop recommendation\
    \ \nCrop harvesting recommendation prior to its cultivation is an effective tool\
    \ for farmers to increase \nproductivity with no capital loss. This is a type\
    \ of recommendation application in Agri-PAD framework. This \napplication will\
    \ help the farmers to make an informed decision by recommending the best suitable\
    \ crop \naccording to the climate condition before cultivation. To prove its applicability,\
    \ we have used crop \nrecommendation dataset available at Kaggle. The dataset\
    \ comprised of 7 independent and 1 dependent features \nwith no missing values.\
    \ The dataset was balanced for 22 crops with features including temperature, humidity,\
    \ \npH value, rainfall, nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium. \nNaïve Bayes algorithm\
    \ was used for training the model which attained the accuracy of 99%. The \nmodel\

    6. \nOPEN CHALLENGES IN ADOPTION OF BIG DATA TECHNOLOGIES IN AGRICULTURE \nBig\
    \ data analytics undoubtedly provides tremendous insights for making better decisions\
    \ in the \nagricultural domain but has not undergone its wide adoption in production\
    \ agriculture [40]. The open \nchallenges hindering its way can be broadly categorized\
    \ into technical and operational challenges. Technical \nchallenges deal with\
    \ the installation of technical devices, their management, and the technical expertise\
    \ \nrequired in disseminating the smooth transfer of data between participating\
    \ entities. Researchers [41], [42] \nasserted that the availability of limited\
    \ infrastructure and lack of technical human resources to collect, process \n\
    and analyze the huge amount of diverse data is the potential barrier in smart\
    \ agriculture adoption. The collected \ndata must be consistent, clean, complete\
    \ and in compliance with the protocols that allow to be pooled into a \ncentralized\
    \ server for processing. Hence, the consistency, accuracy, and veracity of big\
    \ data and its analytics \nare critical challenges [43]. Nonetheless, security\
    \ and privacy remain an inherent concern for all stakeholders \n[44]. Another\
    \ barrier that inhibits smart agriculture from wide adoption is the insufficient\
    \ internet connectivity. \nTransferring data from IoT devices to server needs\
    \ high speed internet connectivity, but the availability of \ninternet is still\
    \ critical in rural areas of most developing countries [45]. \nOperational challenges\
    \ involve the investment and management of the field and post-agricultural \n\
    activities. Transforming the traditional agriculture system into smart agriculture\
    \ requires huge amount of \ninvestment both in terms of financial cost and time.\
    \ Further, smart agriculture demands proper maintenance of \nthe infrastructure\
    \ and includes certainly high costs for the smooth running of its operations and\
    \ up-gradation. \nAdditionally, proper training of farmers is also required to\
    \ get the maximum benefit. Proper governance and \nstructure of agricultural big\
    \ data are still missing and require policy frameworks.  \nApart from technical\
    \ and operational challenges, acceptance of smart agriculture is also hindered\
    \ by \nthe lack of trust among its stakeholders. The primary stakeholder, farmer,\
    \ mostly belongs to the older age group \nare less likely to utilize smart agriculture\
    \ infrastructure as they are more habitual of traditional agriculture \nactivities.\
    \ Furthermore, the direct link of farmer to the consumer will end the middleman\
    \ inclusion and \ndominance which would create chaos between them that may result\
    \ in strong opposition in the adoption of \nsmart agriculture.  \n \n \n7. \n\
    CONCLUSION \nAgriculture and climate change are inextricably linked. The rapid\
    \ pace of climate change will have \nfar-reaching consequences on the agricultural\
    \ ecosystem. Therefore, to ensure food security, smart agriculture \nis the prospective\
    \ solution. Smart agriculture utilizes big data analytical techniques which have\
    \ been proved to \nbe outstandingly beneficial in providing valuable insights\
    \ leading to better decision-making. In this research, \nwe discussed the applications\
    \ of big data analytics in agriculture industry and proposed a framework; Agri-\n\
    PAD. The framework consists of three layers i.e., perception layer, data processing\
    \ layer, and application layer. \nAgri-PAD incorporates big data analytics by\
    \ providing three distinguished categories of applications namely \nprecision,\
    \ recommendation, and enterprise applications. Real-time data analytics applications\
    \ that facilitate \nfarmers in managing their farms and crops remotely fall under\
    \ the precision category. Recommendation \napplications, based on historical data\
    \ collected from various sources, provide insights that lead to informed \ndecision-making.\
    \ While enterprise applications assist farmers in reaching the market directly,\
    \ eliminating the \nmiddleman dependence and improving the efficiency of the agriculture\
    \ supply chain. Further, we present two \nuse cases of smart agriculture employing\
    \ machine learning. We also highlight the open challenges that are \nserving as\
    \ barriers to the adoption of smart agriculture widely. Realizing the importance\
    \ of security and privacy, \nwe intend to enhance this framework by including\
    \ a layer to handle data security in the future. In addition, the \nwork on an\
    \ integrated testbed to further validate the effectiveness of the Agri-PAD framework\
    \ can be \nundertaken. \n \n \nREFERENCES \n[1] \n“Agriculture overview.” https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/agriculture/overview#1\

    (UGV), vis-NIR. Abstract. Crop nitrogen (N) management is one of many important
    agricultural applications that can benefit from crop sensing. The technologies
    in this field are advancing rapidly, including: (1) sensor-carrying platforms,
    (2) the sensors themselves, and (3) the analytical techniques used to derive actionable
    information from the data. A review of commercially and semi-commercially available
    platforms was undertaken to inform sensor mounting, with particular focus on unmanned
    aerial vehicle (UAV) sensor platforms and unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) sensor
    platforms. The UAV and UAG platforms provide indirect and direct measurements
    for crop monitoring and N mapping with the goals of being low-cost, on-site, and
    versatile. Optical crop sensing techniques and systems for N management are also
    discussed, because destructive sampling and laboratory analyses are expensive
    and often not practical for site-specific management of N. The optical properties
    of the plant are significant because they are related to water content, leaf senescence,
    disease, and nutrient status, which can inform farming decisions. Additionally,
    Red, Green and Blue (RGB) imaging can provide a plant height assessment for multiple
    measurements, including: yield potential, biomass, density, uniformity, and planter
    skips. The work reported in this paper includes a comparison of various optical
    sensors for plant measurements, including: vis-NIR, Machine Vision, and 3D-imaging,
    with camera varieties such as multispectral, fluorescence, hyperspectral, thermal,
    and visible. Key recommendations have been provided for the development of data
    aggregation and decision support tools including the data sources to be used in

    \ CropSurveyor is a PHP and SQL based server platform, which provides automated\

    32 \nand centralised data servers. Data transfer is performed automatically though\
    \ an HTTP accessible \n33 \nRESTful API installed on both device-side and server-side\
    \ of the CropSurveyor system, which \n34 \nsynchronise daily representative crop\

    Automated phenotyping technology has the potential to enable continuous and precise\
    \ measurement \n50 \nof phenotypes that are key to today’s crop research [1,2].\
    \ Quantitative phenotypic traits collected \n51 \nthrough crop development are\
    \ not only important evidence for biologists to understand the dynamics \n52 \n\
    between crop performance, genotypes, and environmental factors (e.g. genotype-by-environment\
    \ \n53 \ninteractions, GxE), but critical for agronomists and farmers to monitor\
    \ crops in fluctuating agricultural \n54 \nconditions [3–5]. High quality phenotyping\
    \ and climate datasets lay the foundation for meaningful \n55 \nphenotypic analysis,\
    \ which is likely to produce an accurate delineation of the genotype-to-phenotype\
    \ \n56 \npathway for assessing yield potential and environmental adaptation [6,7].\
    \ Presently, although many \n57 \nautomated phenotyping platforms are capable\
    \ of accumulating big plant-environment data [8], it is \n58 \nstill technically\
    \ challenging to collect, calibrate, annotate, and aggregate the data effectively,\
    \ for \n59 \nbiological experiments carried out in multiple locations, and often\
    \ at different scales [9,10].    \n60 \n   With the rise of Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) technologies and their applications in plant phenotyping \n61 \n[11],\
    \ a number of commercial data management solutions have been developed on the\
    \ base of \n62 \ncustomised hardware and proprietary software. For example, the\
    \ Field Scanalyzer system (LemnaTec) \n63 \nemploys a simple HTTP server with\
    \ an SQLite database to facilitate crop monitoring and deep field \n64 \nphenotyping\
    \ using LemnaControl and LemnaBase software [12]; Integrated Analysis Platform\
    \ \n65 \n(LemnaTec) [13] provides an automated pipeline to combine raw image collection\
    \ and metadata \n66 \nassociation for indoor phenotyping; the FieldScan system\
    \ (Phenospex) [14] uses infield WiFi network \n67 \nto connect PlantEyeTM 3D laser\
    \ scanners, climate sensors, and a gantry system with a PostgreSQL \n68 \ndatabase\
    \ to realise the scanner-to-plant phenotyping; and, PlantScreenTM system (Photon\
    \ Systems \n69 \nInstruments, PSI) manages fluorescence images and trait scores\
    \ through dedicated networks and \n70 \ndatabases [15]. However, all these commercial\
    \ systems require ongoing licensing maintenance and \n71 \nadditional costs for\
    \ developing new functions. It is therefore challenging for a broader plant research\
    \ \n72 \ncommunity to adopt and extend them easily in order to meet the growing\
    \ needs of today’s crop \n73 \nresearch [10].   \n74 \ncertified by peer review)\

    4\n   Recently, some research-based systems have also been introduced to the scientific\
    \ community. For \n75 \nexample, PhotosynQ software manages data collection and\
    \ storage through a handheld device called \n76 \nMultispeQ [16]. It uses Bluetooth\
    \ to retrieve leaf surface images, environmental and geolocational \n77 \ndata\
    \ collected by MultispeQ and stores them in a mobile phone or a laptop. The system\
    \ requires \n78 \nmanual interference for data synchronisation and centralised\
    \ analysis via onsite workstations or cloud-\n79 \nbased servers. Hence, it is\
    \ tailored for small-scale and qualitative phenotyping tasks. BreedVision is \n\
    80 \nanother system that gathers data through a network-based HTTP server [17].\
    \ Mounting multiple \n81 \nsensors on a tractor, BreedVision is used to carry\
    \ out field phenotyping for wheat breeding. Sensors \n82 \ncommunicate to a SQL\
    \ database running in an embedded system. However, this platform is designed \n\
    83 \nfor bespoke hardware and does not provide an open application programming\
    \ interface (API), \n84 \nindicating that it is incompatible with external hardware\
    \ and software. Solely for collecting climate \n85 \ndatasets, the PANGEA architecture\
    \ [18] was successfully established to network large numbers of \n86 \nconnections\
    \ (e.g. wireless sensor networks, WSN) for agricultural practises [19]. This system\
    \ has \n87 \nbeen used to integrate large-scale WSN installations through open\
    \ and distributed smart device \n88 \ninterfaces. However, it cannot handle image-based\
    \ datasets and thus limits its applications in \n89 \nphenomics driven crop research.\
    \ Lately, a comprehensive and open-source Phenotyping Hybrid \n90 \nInformation\
    \ System (PHIS) has been developed by INRA [20]. PHIS system aims to provide a\
    \ \n91 \nplatform to enable data tracing and reanalysis of phenomic data collected\
    \ on thousands of plants, \n92 \nsensors and events. It can identify and retrieve\
    \ objects, traits and relations via ontologies and \n93 \nsemantics. Because the\
    \ PHIS system needs to incorporate many external phenotyping and modelling \n\
    94 \nsystems, it is heavyweight and mainly focuses on post-experimental data integration\
    \ and analysis.      \n95 \n   The above industrial and academic efforts identify\
    \ the need to develop a scalable and openly \n96 \navailable data management system.\
    \ It needs to handle different types of datasets acquired in \n97 \nautomated\
    \ plant phenotyping experiments. To integrate data transfer, calibration, annotation\
    \ and \n98 \naggregation effectively, such a system should be flexible for changeable\
    \ experimental designs and \n99 \nexpandable with third-party hardware and external\

    \ design requirements in mind, we developed CropSurveyor, an IoT-based data \n\
    103 \nmanagement system that is easy to use and flexible to deploy in diverse\
    \ experimental scenarios. \n104 \nCropSurveyor is a scalable and open-source software\
    \ system, which provides diverse interfacing \n105 \noptions for the community\
    \ to adopt and extend. We followed a distributed IoT systems design during \n\
    106 \nthe development, so that experimental, phenotypic, and environmental data\
    \ collected from infield and \n107 \nindoor experiments could be integrated efficiently.\
    \ The system provides a unified web interface for \n108 \nusers to oversee data\
    \ collection, calibration and storage on a regular basis. Through our three-year\
    \ \n109 \nwheat prebreeding experiments (2016-2018) [21], a powerful visualisation\
    \ component and a flexible \n110 \ndata/experiment management solution has been\
    \ established. Equipped with CropSurveyor, users can \n111 \nnow closely monitor\
    \ different experiments, ongoing and historic, running in different locations.\
    \ \n112 \nFurthermore, the modulated software architecture has made it possible\
    \ to change scale and \n113 \nperformance for new experimental needs. To our knowledge,\
    \ the research-based CropSurveyor \n114 \nsystem has the potential to significantly\
    \ contribute towards dynamic data collection and experimental \n115 \nmanagement,\

    \  \n118 \nIoT is a fast-growing field. IoT-based sensors are generating terabytes\

    \ the existing data management solutions heavily rely on \n120 \nbespoke data\

    \ of the \n121 \nsolutions require the construction of a centralised management\
    \ system, which would not resolve the \n122 \nproblem of scalability and accessibility,\
    \ because the distributed nature of IoT technologies and the \n123 \ncentralised\
    \ data administration infrastructure are likely to confound each other. Instead,\
    \ we developed \n124 \na two-component solution. The first part of this is a device-side\
    \ system that is lightweight and capable \n125 \nof interacting directly with\
    \ distributed IoT devices, ensuring onboard data standardisation and data \n126\

    \ of bringing scalability and flexibility to users. \n130 \n \n131 \nThe systems\
    \ design \n132 \nThe two-component systems design of CropSurveyor is shown in\
    \ Fig. 1. We used a Python-based web \n133 \nframework, Flask [23,24], as the\
    \ base for the device-side services. The main reason for this choice is \n134\
    \ \nthat Python, a high-level programming language widely used by the scientific\
    \ community, can interact \n135 \nwith many single-board computers (e.g. a Raspberry\
    \ Pi computer) commonly embedded in distributed \n136 \nIoT sensors and/or phenotyping\
    \ devices. This framework administers onboard data storage and \n137 \nestablishes\
    \ a lightweight server for web-based interactions (Fig. 1A). As Flask is hardware\
    \ \n138 \nindependent, the approach can be applied to any hardware that supports\
    \ Python. Additional services \n139 \nsuch as Linux crontab scheduling system,\
    \ dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP, used for \n140 \nestablishing self-operating\
    \ WiFi network), and virtual network computing (VNC) services can be \n141 \n\
    easily added or removed to maintain the simplicity of the device-side system.\
    \   \n142 \n   Powered by PHP5+ [25] and MySQL [26], the device-side system can\
    \ facilitate real-time \n143 \ninteractions between smart devices (e.g. smartphones\
    \ and tablets) and IoT devices. The graphic user \n144 \ninterface (GUI) was developed\
    \ using PHP and JavaScript, which can be opened in a web browser \n145 \nsuch\
    \ as Chrome and Firefox on any smart device. A PHP-based RESTful API [27] was\
    \ adopted to \n146 \nregulate hourly client-server communications. A lightweight\
    \ SQL server, MariaDB [28], was used for \n147 \ncollecting and storing different\
    \ formats of datasets, including images, climate sensors, and \n148 \nexperimental\
    \ settings. The device-side system can also be used to initiate a live video streaming\
    \ for \n149 \nusers to deploy infield or indoor phenotyping devices (Supplementary\
    \ Fig. 1), so that an experiment \n150 \ncan be initiated or terminated via a\
    \ smartphone or a tablet. Also, the GUI allows users to enter \n151 \nmetadata\
    \ including trials, experiments (e.g. genotypes, treatments and biological replicates),\
    \ and brief \n152 \ndescription, while phenotyping devices are being installed.\

    \ datasets acquired at different locations to be \n156 \nsynchronised with a centralised\
    \ server for detailed traits analyses and decision making in crop \n157 \nmanagement.\
    \ PHP5+ was used to develop the system that supports Apache and an SQL server\
    \ such as \n158 \nMySQL [26]. The server-side system initiates regular updates\
    \ of the status of each distributed IoT \n159 \ndevice with information such as\
    \ online or offline status of the device, operational mode, \n160 \nrepresentative\
    \ daily images, micro-climate readings, and the usage of computing resources (i.e.\
    \ CPU \n161 \nand memory). Since 2017, the two-component CropSurveyor system has\
    \ been successfully applied to \n162 \nmonitor indoor wheat speed breeding [29]\
    \ and infield wheat prebreeding simultaneously \n163 \n(Supplementary Fig. 2).\

    \ to allow users with no technical background to use, the installation \n167 \n\
    of the system still requires an IT technician to complete (see Additional File\
    \ 1). To install the system, \n168 \na functioning PHP and SQL server is required.\
    \ Also, as it runs on a network-enabled web server, a \n169 \nnetwork infrastructure\
    \ is required to properly function CropSurveyor (Fig. 2). However, due to the\
    \ \n170 \nrural location of many crop research experiments, it is often expensive\
    \ and unfeasible to install wired \n171 \nor wireless networks in some experimental\
    \ sites. Hence, our solution is to establish an ad-hoc and \n172 \nself-managed\
    \ network through USB WiFi dongles mounted on IoT devices, e.g. a distributed\
    \ \n173 \nCropQuant phenotyping workstation [21], so CropSurveyor can transfer\
    \ data between distributed IoT \n174 \ndevices and a central server. The self-managed\

    \ synchronisation in the field (Fig. 2A), or to establish a direct link between\
    \ a smart device and a \n177 \nphenotyping workstation (Fig. 2B). After correlating\
    \ and collecting all data from the device side, the \n178 \nsystem will then transfer\

    \ based on how they are presented to the user [30]. Using the MVC pattern to \n\

    \ to improve \n325 \ncrop productivity and sustainability [2,36,37]. As European\
    \ infrastructures for sustainable agriculture \n326 \n(e.g. EMPHASIS and AnaEE)\
    \ have identified, openly shareable solutions built on widely accessible \n327\
    \ \ndigital infrastructures are likely to provide an effective solution to address\
    \ the challenge by integrating \n328 \nnovel scientific concepts, sensors and\
    \ models [38,39]. The IoT-based CropSurveyor system presented \n329 \nhere is\
    \ scalable and open-source, providing the scientific community various interfacing\
    \ options to \n330 \nadopt and extend. The openly available platform integrates\
    \ the archiving and collation of high-\n331 \nfrequency environmental data and\
    \ crop images automatically, which can be used for both phenotypic \n332 \nanalyses\
    \ as well as agricultural decision making. By associating environmental conditions\
    \ directly \n333 \nwith crop growth data, we trust that the system is capable\
    \ of forming a sound base for reliable GxE \n334 \nstudies. More importantly,\
    \ CropSurveyor provides geolocation and remote sensor readings of current \n335\

    \ national scale so that \n348 \nearly adoption of preventative measures can be\
    \ arranged.  \n349 \n   Presently, many governments are shifting their focuses\
    \ towards innovative technologies to \n350 \nmodernise crop and agricultural research.\
    \ The UK Government, for example, has invested heavily in \n351 \nIoT-based technologies\
    \ to address challenges on yield production, food traceability, environmental\
    \ \n352 \nchallenges, incompatibility, and lack of infrastructure [40]. We believe\
    \ that CropSurveyor can also \n353 \naddress some of the current challenges directly.\
    \ For example, by logging historical data and \n354 \nannotating crop growth and\
    \ environmental effects within monitored fields can increase crop \n355 \ntraceability.\
    \ To reduce the overall use of agrochemicals as part of a precision farming strategy\
    \ \n356 \n[41,42], CropSurveyor can be used to identify the appropriate timing\
    \ and areas for chemical \n357 \napplication together with infield imaging and\
    \ ambient sensors. Water is in limited supply for large \n358 \nregions of the\
    \ globe and the reduction of unnecessary irrigation would be of large benefit\
    \ to the cost-\n359 \neffectiveness of agriculture [43,44]. As discussed previously,\
    \ CropSurveyor is built in with near real-\n360 \ntime environment monitoring\
    \ mechanisms including soil temperature, soil moisture levels, and \n361 \nambient\
    \ humidity. Hence, it provides information crucial to make decisions and targeting\
    \ irrigation in \n362 \ntiming and location. Additionally, by linking extra climate\
    \ sensors with IoT devices, further \n363 \nenvironmental readings can be extended\
    \ in CropSurveyor for growing agricultural needs.   \n364 \n   Besides the near\
    \ real-time environmental and crop growth monitoring, historic and current datasets\
    \ \n365 \ncollated in a central system can also deliver predictive powers. An\
    \ example of potentially predictable \n366 \nsituations is the “Smith Period”\

    \ \nTo establish a data and experiment management system that is scalable and\
    \ usable on regional, \n377 \nnational or even global crop research and agricultural\
    \ practices, we believe that CropSurveyor in \n378 \nconnection with distributed\
    \ IoT sensors can meet the future demand of usability and scalability, with \n\
    379 \nsome further development. One area of expansion is in scalability. The system\
    \ is currently tested on \n380 \nlocal server with a direct network connection\
    \ to at least one of the distributed nodes. To allow the \n381 \nexpansion at\
    \ a larger, national, or even global scale, the reliance on maintained servers\
    \ would be less \n382 \neffective than a true cloud enabled service. Hence, by\
    \ moving the CropSurveyor system to a globally \n383 \naccessible cloud server\
    \ with cloud enabled distributed storage is a feasible approach, as the \n384\
    \ \nrequirements for institutions and agricultural practitioners to maintain servers\
    \ and storage are \n385 \nremoved. Given the lack of network infrastructure in\
    \ rural areas in many countries, the addition of 3G \n386 \nor 4G mobile data\
    \ networks to key distributed nodes in the field can improve the infield network,\
    \ \n387 \nupon which the data communication of a large number of Agri-Tech devices\
    \ can be relied.  \n388 \n   Another prohibitive factor in IoT in agriculture\
    \ is the quantity and costs of IoT devices required to \n389 \ncover an entire\
    \ field. Based on our three-year field experiments, we believe that installing\
    \ sensors and \n390 \nphenotyping workstations to cover every area in the field\
    \ is unnecessary. Fig. 5 shows that the data \n391 \ninterpolation approach we\

    impulse towards a larger introduction of Information and Communication Technology
    (ICT) in the agricultural field is currently experiencing its momentum, as digitisation
    has large potentialities to provide benefits for both producers and consumers;
    on the other hand, pushing technological solutions into a rural context encounters
    several challenges. In this work, we provide a survey of the most recent research
    activities, in the form of both research projects and scientific literature, with
    the objective of showing the already achieved results, the current investigations,
    and the still open challenges, both technical and non technical. We mainly focus
    on the EU territory, identifying threats and concerns, and then looking at existing
    and upcoming solutions to overcome those barriers. Previous article in issue Next

    computing5GSatelliteUAV 1. Introduction Smart Farming (SF) refers to the application
    of ICT to agriculture. Data collected and analysed through ICT techniques support
    efficient production processes [1], thus motivating scientists, practitioners,
    private and public companies to work towards the goal of developing and encouraging
    the use of innovative technologies to support farmers on the ground. According
    to the European Union (EU), the most relevant technologies and techniques to be
    fully exploited are the satellite imagery, the use of agricultural robots, a larger
    use of sensor nodes to collect data, and the potentialities of Unmanned Aerial
    Vehicles (UAVs) for aerial imagery and actuation. Those indications are contained
    into the declaration of cooperation on A smart and sustainable digital future
    for European agriculture and rural areas1 signed on April 2019 by 24 EU countries.
    According to the aforementioned declaration, the first obstacle towards a full
    implementation of SF in rural areas is the lack of connectivity, i.e., digital
    divide. The advent of 5G is promising to improve such a situation in rural and
    low-income areas [2], but scattered coverage must be still taken into account,
    as highlighted in recent surveys in the EU territory [3]. Rural areas remain challenging,
    not being covered by any Next Generation Access network: up to 53% at the end
    of 2017 in EU [3]. Putting this issue aside, a plethora of initiatives can be
    identified towards the objective of the digitisation of agriculture. As an exemplary
    case, Smart AKIS, an EU-funded thematic network promoted by the Agricultural European
    Innovation Partnership (EIP-AGRI) established in 2016, aims to close the gap between
    scientific knowledge and practitioners, in order to promote concrete solutions
    to be implemented. A solution can be defined as anything that makes the farming
    practice more controlled and accurate through ICT, reducing both the costs and
    the environmental impact, while also increasing the production. SF has the potential
    to also improve work safety, contributing to the sustainability of agriculture
    [1], but its socio-economic implications are debated [4]. In this innovative approach
    of farm management, a key component is the use of hardware and software technologies,
    like the deploying of sensor nodes, control systems, robotics, satellites for
    imagery and positioning, data storage and analysis, advisory systems, and terrestrial
    and aerial drones. However, the aim of SF should not be just in industrializing
    agriculture, but in making the whole process more efficient, sustainable, and
    of high quality, while respecting farmers’ needs. SF dates back to the middle
    of the 80’s, but it has been practiced commercially only since the 90’s [5]. However,
    many farmers are still skeptical about the actual advantages it can offer. This
    can be explained by considering the profit and the direct benefits for the farm.
    In fact, it is not straightforward to identify those [6], for instance when considering
    Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) and Operating Expenditures (OPEX) for software, machinery,
    and data. Farmers generally tend to identify SF as a set of tools that benefits
    only large holdings, both in crop and livestock production. This is linked to
    the perception of high costs and complexity of the involved technologies. What
    is lacking from this image is the possibility that innovative technologies might
    not be only large-scale and thus costly, but rather also slow and precise, plus
    small and cheap [7]. Nowadays, SF is rapidly taking advantage of recent technological
    advancements for improving agricultural practices [8], further than business models
    for lowering adoption costs. For instance, rental programs for farming equipment,
    like Trringo in India, make possible farm mechanization processes with affordable
    costs for farmers, also providing support services. Such an initiative can be
    categorised as cooperative farming, potentially increasing the penetration of
    SF in low-income areas. Karnott, a French company, is pushing both web services
    and hardware solutions to transform legacy equipment into SF-ready one. Karnott
    sells a control unit to be installed on agricultural machines, offering several
    services through a battery-powered device, collecting and exchanging real-time
    data, as well as geolocation. Then, collected data can be exploited through on-line
    services, like those provided by api-agro, a secure platform to share data. Available
    data can be accessed and fed to different management systems, thus offering a
    valuable repository for farms. Taranis offers a platform using aerial and satellite
    imagery joint with Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to provide a Decision
    Support System (DSS) for Precision Farming (PF) applications. AgriOpenData provides
    a DSS as well, exploiting blockchain, UAVs, and adding support services on top
    of it. When considering fully autonomous solutions, Iron Ox offers a complete
    robotic solution to grow plants, from seeds to harvest, with a hydroponic system
    able to strongly reduce the water consumption. At last, traceability is experiencing
    a revolution thanks to digital ledgers. Even if it cannot be considered immediately
    within the umbrella of SF, still the origin and the quality of agricultural products
    remains a central issue. Carrefour, a French multinational retailer, is betting
    on blockchain as a solution to provide trustable data to consumers and intermediate
    actors. Blockchain is used by Hectare Agritech in a farm trading platform as well,
    highlighting how innovative paradigms can be adapted to different use cases in
    the agricultural field. The aim of this work is to survey both research initiatives
    and scientific literature on the topic of SF, looking at recent technologies and
    techniques being used or being actively pushed for adoption. In addition, we discuss
    still open challenges hampering such an objective. The rest of this work is structured
    as follows: Section 2 surveys research and innovation projects covering SF activities
    in the EU territory, then the scope of the survey is enlarged by taking into account
    the state of the art in the scientific literature. Section 3 discusses the open
    challenges at today, considering both technical and non-technical factors. Finally,
    Section 4 draws the conclusions and opens to future directions. 2. State of the
    art This section provides two main contributions. The first one is in Section
    2.1, surveying relevant research projects recently funded by the EU in the field
    of SF; the aim is to highlight the increasing attention towards those activities,
    and then to identify the involved technologies. Table 1 provides an overview of
    surveyed R&I projects. Furthermore, Fig. 1 depicts relevant agricultural operations
    as faced by the described research projects, and the technological solutions exploited
    in the latter ones. The second contribution is in Section 2.2, surveying the scientific
    works that propose solutions for the implementation of SF. Table 2 provides an
    overview of surveyed literature, then a keyword analysis is proposed in Fig. 2.

    2. Number of occurrences of relevant keywords (at least 50) as they appear in
    the surveyed literature: the 4 categories, as proposed in Table 2, can be read
    internally, and each keyword is weighted (circle radius) in the cluster it belongs
    to. 2.1. EU research projects In last years, the EU has been actively undertaking
    R&I activities laying the ground for the digitisation of agriculture by exploiting
    data-empowered strategies; strategic interventions have been funded to support
    the uptake of digital technologies, to develop new digital solutions and to sustain
    the crucial assessment of the socio-economic impacts of digitisation. In Table
    1, 30 recent EU projects closely related to SF are presented: the first 21 projects,
    spanning from 2015 to 2019, propose, develop, and test the use of digital technologies
    in this field; the 9 projects in the last rows, spanning from 2012 to 2019, have
    the complementary objective of strengthen or evaluate the use of ICT in agriculture,
    for instance through challenge-based strategies, or by setting up marketplaces
    to browse existing solutions ready for use. Most projects jointly exploit multiple
    techniques and technologies; here, we highlight only the most prominent ones.
    2.1.1. Cloud/edge-based systems Cloud platforms are mainly exploited in projects
    that are related to monitoring activities, like growth of plants, water availability,
    soil moisture maps, and so on. There is a clear dominance of cloud solutions with
    respect to those based on edge solutions, because the former is a more established
    option than the latter. The AgriCloud P2 project proposed a cloud-based PF management
    system for a sustainable and intensive agriculture to secure long-term food supply
    in Europe. The APMAV project consists of an intuitive solution for agricultural
    management based on UAV technology and an intelligent cloud-based platform that
    provides farmers valuable, actionable and real-time recommendations for driving
    down costs and improving crop performance. The Flourish project leverages UAVs
    as well, aiming at surveying a field from the air, then at performing a targeted
    intervention on the ground with an Unmanned Terrestrial Vehicle (UTV). The idea
    is to provide a DSS requiring minimal user intervention to target PF applications.
    The SWAMP project develops Internet of Things (IoT)-based methods and approaches
    for smart water management in the precision irrigation domain, in order to utilize
    water more efficiently and effectively, avoiding both under- and over-irrigation.
    The AfriCultuReS project, beyond the use of cloud-based technology, also exploits
    the data collected from different sources (e.g. service providers, weather services)
    to develop an integrated agricultural monitoring and early warning system, based
    on remote sensing, to support decision making. The DataBio project makes intensive
    use of big data techniques related to the raw material production from agriculture,
    forestry, fishery and aquaculture for the production of food, energy, and biomaterials
    in a sustainable way, by means of a software platform integrating big data and
    Earth Observation (EO) methods. Data-driven activities are also proposed in the
    just started Dragon project, whose main efforts are directed towards skill transfers
    to ease PF adoption. Large heterogeneous data sources are considered and analysed
    to offer agricultural knowledge and information systems by ambitiously leveraging
    several techniques. The BigDataGrapes project makes use of big data techniques
    in the context of viticulture, supporting decisions by exploiting real-time analysis
    of large, diverse and multimodal data sources. It has been exploiting the use
    of UAVs as well in vineyards. Last but not least, the IoF2020 project is one of
    the most comprehensive projects from the point of view of SF digital technologies:
    in particular, this project accelerates the adoption of IoT, in order to secure
    sufficient, safe and healthy food and at strengthening competitiveness of farming
    and food chains in Europe. A large scale pilot programme has been started in IoF2020
    to develop and test specific technological solutions in the following sectors:
    arable, dairy, fruits, vegetables, and meat. 2.1.2. Unmanned vehicles The use
    of unmanned vehicles is another trend of great interest. Beyond the aforementioned
    Flourish, APMAV, BigDataGrapes, and Dragon projects, the PANTHEON project, by
    taking advantage of the technological advancements in the fields of robotics,
    remote sensing and big data management, aims at designing an integrated system
    where heterogeneous unmanned robotic components (terrestrial and aerial robots)
    move within the orchards to collect data and perform common farming operations.
    The SWEEPER project has proposed a robotic system to harvest sweet peppers in
    greenhouses, leveraging on machine vision techniques to acquire both colour and
    distance information, and then storing collected peppers in an on-board container.
    Another robotic platform has been developed in the ROMI project to assist in weed
    reduction and crop monitoring, reducing manual labour. Land robots also acquire
    detailed information on sample plants, and an UAV assists by providing information
    at crop level. The GreenPatrol-Robot project designed and built a satellite-guided
    autonomous robot for pest control in greenhouses. It exploits Galileo satellite
    services to navigate, achieving good positioning accuracy inside greenhouses.
    The AFarCloud project aims at the agricultural productivity increase via PF techniques.
    The proposed solution is a distributed platform for autonomous farming robots
    that allows the integration and real-time cooperation of agricultural systems
    to increase efficiency, productivity, and food quality. This platform is integrated
    with a Farm Management System (FMS) to support monitoring and decision-making
    solutions based on real-time data mining techniques. The RUC-APS project is centered
    on management approaches aiming at enhancing SF solutions in agriculture systems,
    applying operational research to optimise farm production. 2.1.3. Satellite-based
    activities Several projects are mainly based on improving the information derived
    from satellite optical data. The AGRORADAR project aims at delivering innovative
    algorithms and data models that can process Copernicus EO Syntethic Aperture Radar
    (SAR) data to achieve precise and detailed information. The AUDITOR project develops
    an improved Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) augmentation system for
    services in PF applications. The project enables cost-effective PF services to
    farmers, like recommendations regarding site-specific application of water, fertilizer
    and pesticides. The WATER4AGRI project combines microwave data obtained from different
    satellites to provide datasets for retrieving key information about water availability
    for crops at field level. The SENSAGRI project combines optical and radar measurements
    to develop three prototype services for near real-time operations: surface soil
    moisture, green and brown Leaf Area Index (LAI), and crop type mapping. The MISTRALE
    project provides soil moisture maps to decision makers in water management using
    GNSS reflectometry (GNSS-R) via satellites and UAVs. The project has developed
    a prototype sensor embedded on a dedicated software platform. The APOLLO project
    brings PF closer to farmers through affordable information services, making extensive
    use of free and open EO data. The proposed services help farmers to make better
    decisions by monitoring the growth and health of crops, providing advice on when
    to irrigate and till their fields, and estimating the size of their harvest. The
    services are designed to be always available thanks to a web platform and a mobile
    application. 2.1.4. Mitigating digital divide Other research projects are mainly
    focused on bringing the advantages of SF to farmers in a way compatible with their
    needs and digital skills, thus reducing digital divide. The SMART-AKIS initiative
    sets up a self-sustainable thematic network on SF technologies designed for the
    effective exchange of knowledge among research, industry, and the farming community,
    disseminating direct applicable research and commercial solutions, and capturing
    grassroots level needs and innovative ideas. The 4D4F project (Data Driven Dairy
    Decision For Farmers) focuses on the benefits provided by sensors in monitoring
    animals and environment, supporting informed decisions. The project hosts a large
    repository of ICT solutions freely browseable by farmers. The SmartAgriHubs project
    brings together 164 partners in the European agri-food sector, carrying out 28
    flagship innovation experiments for digitisation in five agri-food sectors: arable
    farming, livestock, vegetable, fruits, and aquaculture. The overall goal of ICT-AGRI-2
    is to strengthen the research within the area of PF and to develop a common research
    agenda concerning ICT and robotics in agriculture in Europe. Its main objectives
    are: mapping and analysis of existing research and future needs; development of
    instruments and procedures for transnational funding activities; development of
    strategic research agenda and programmes; and establishment of international collaborations
    and networks. Other projects, like Nefertiti, Euraknos, and Desira are setting
    up thematic networks with the objective of promote networking activities, data
    sharing and knowledge exchange. They leverage the vast set of already available
    ICT tools to promote their use in SF contexts and to foster their adaption to
    practitioners’ needs. The DESIRA project, started at June 2019, intends to collect
    practitioners’ needs through 20 national living labs in EU and then to design
    ICT use cases to meet those demands in a Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI)
    fashion. The Fairshare project has data collecting and sharing as foremost objectives,
    in order to build a network able to reduce the agricultural digital divide. Finally,
    FarmingBySatellite is an initiative to promote the use of Galileo as GNSS and
    EO services. It launches a biyearly challenge to identify promising ideas using
    satellite technologies for SF purposes. 2.1.5. Considerations Summing up, some
    considerations can be made: monitoring fields and crops is quite diffused at today,
    leveraging local and remote sensing solutions, i.e., in-field sensors, UAVs, up
    to satellites. Another major challenge is the optimisation of water use. Unmanned
    vehicles enable semi- and full-autonomous scenarios, currently representing a
    major objective for both research institutes and private companies. Anyway, almost
    all surveyed projects aim at providing DSSs instead of autonomous solutions; in
    fact, there is still wide scepticism on them by practitioners as viable alternatives
    to human decisions. To feed DSSs, data analysis techniques are used, also supporting
    automatic actions based on feedback, and farmers’ decisions. Machine learning
    techniques are typically exploited for dedicated applications in the projects
    we considered, such as prediction and estimation of farming parameters to optimise
    livestock production or crop monitoring. 2.2. Scientific literature SF represents
    the evolution of agriculture driven by ICT technologies. ICT provides tools, methods,
    and techniques with the potential to improve both the modeling and the practice
    in this sector. SF is intrinsically tied to large-scale heterogeneous sensing
    [9], involving different hardware, algorithms, and protocols, thus too focused
    approaches have gained little traction at now. In what follows, we survey a very
    recent and exemplary subset of the scientific literature on such a topic, then
    schematised in Table 2. To further highlight what is currently trending in recent
    scientific literature, we show the most used keywords in Fig. 2, according to
    the four thematic clusters we define in Table 2. Each keyword is presented weighted
    in its cluster according to the number of occurrences. Finally, Table 3 maps typical
    application scenarios and data types to commonly used sensing solutions [10,11].

    techniques and management systems SF makes large use of sensor nodes to collect
    data on the environment and the phenomenon under observation. For instance, in
    the case of agriculture, soil sensors, placed at different depths, complement
    data collected from EO satellites, providing enriched information. More generally,
    indoor and outdoor Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), both mobile and fixed, are
    used to collect heterogeneous data [14] for evaluating different indexes, such
    as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the excess green index,
    the LAI, and so on. Given the fundamental role played by data and data sources
    in this context [12], the historical evolution of sensing for PF in Ref. [5] offers
    a valuable perspective. At the beginning, three methodological approaches were
    considered: the first two ones, namely farming by soil and site-specific crop
    management, were contrasting because the former promoted soil mapping, while the
    latter promoted homogeneous actions in sub-units of farm fields, i.e., a punctual
    approach versus a clustered one. The third approach, namely proximal soil sensing,
    came later, consisting in continuous real-time sensing by sensors mounted on tractors.
    It can be considered the father of the PF approaches in use nowadays. Thanks to
    satellites, proximal soil sensing evolved into remote soil sensing, introducing
    spectral analyses. To allow farm managers to exploit all those heterogeneous data
    sources, increasing complex software platforms were introduced to take advantage
    of raw data and of subsequent elaboration: they are referred to as FMIS [13].
    2.2.2. Unmanned vehicles Real-time stream processing, analysis, and reasoning
    are key concepts towards automation in the agricultural field [22], i.e., towards
    a larger use of robots that can adapt to space- and time-varying conditions with
    minimal delay. Robots can perform very precise operations, and can operate in
    fleets, as proposed in Ref. [23], which considers both UTVs and UAVs. Moving systems
    rely on GNSS techniques for precise positioning, and PF applications need large
    accuracy. Several commercial systems integrate a GNSS receiver and use one or
    more fixed Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) reference base stations [26] for providing
    accuracy up to centimeters. Further than precise positioning, robots depend on
    machine-vision systems to navigate the environment [25]; according to the technology
    and the scenario under consideration, specific spectral signatures are of interest,
    as for instance hyperspectral imagery in both local and remote sensing. Commercial
    devices, to be used on board, already capture both RGB and Near Infrared Imagery
    (NIR) bands, and stereovision systems are used for 3D maps [25]. Further than
    terrestrial vehicles, aerial ones have been revolutionising the practices in this
    sector. PF is taking large advantage of UAVs, with several commercial systems
    able to fly at different speeds and altitudes [24], ranging from fixed to rotary
    wing machines. UAVs are used for monitoring scenarios, further than pesticide
    spraying, which is a key application for PF [18]. Heavy and large UAVs can be
    used for such a purpose in the case of large fields, jointly with multispectral
    techniques to generate NDVI maps to be used for spraying pesticides and fertilizers
    where needed. Such a potential has been subject to increasing attention in the
    last years. For instance, UAVs can be used to assess if an area has been subject
    to plowing, and the plowing depths. The authors in Ref. [15] consider the use
    of UAVs for such a purpose as an alternative to the use of satellites. In fact,
    according to the authors, even high-resolution satellites cannot classify the
    roughness of the terrain, thus motivating the use of UAVs. A RGB camera has been
    used for data collection and a visual assessment, and collected georeferenced
    data are analysed to assess the plowing depths. RGB and NIR are collected by means
    of an UAV also in Ref. [16], with the aim of classifying plants and weeds. The
    proposed system makes use of the Excess Green Index (ExG) [16] in the case of
    RGB-only; if NIR is exploited as well, NDVI can be estimated and used because
    of the richer information it provides. By combining these results with geometric
    features, sugar beets can be recognised even in the case of overlapping plants.
    NDVI has been used in viticulture for precision applications [21] as well: in
    fact, using an UAV to collect detailed images in a vineyard, plant rows can be
    discriminated from inter-rows, identifying missing plants with good precision.
    UAVs can be seen as part of a WSN, acting as mobile nodes [17], thus the analytical
    characterisation of the channel model between a moving UAV and fixed terrestrial
    nodes becomes of interest [20]. Low-power 802.15.4-based solutions have been investigated
    in rural contexts, using UAVs as data mules [19]. 2.2.3. IoT platforms As aforementioned
    in Section 1, Internet connectivity is a key requirement for SF. In fact, its
    availability allows IoT-based scenarios to emerge [33], increasing the degree
    of remote control and automation. This is well supported by IoT features, such
    as interoperability and easiness of integration [36]. Anyway, in rural contexts,
    terrestrial connectivity may be lacking. Because of this, aerospace solutions
    for connectivity are a viable option [8]. Looking at the literature, reference
    [30] proposes an IoT platform for PF based on FIWARE.2 It considers the case of
    a greenhouse, where Internet connectivity is likely available, thus opening to
    data exchanges via protocol stacks relying on common IoT protocols, like CoAP
    and MQTT. In greenhouses, the main objectives are typically climate control and
    soil monitoring. The Agricolus software platform, which is a FIWARE-based DSS
    for tobacco crops, is described in Ref. [29], designed to collect soil data via
    802.15.4-based WSNs. The FIWARE middleware is a software enabler in very different
    scenarios [13,29]. Along to climate control systems, irrigation systems have been
    proposed to optimise water use. In Ref. [28], FIWARE cloud components are integrated
    in a PF application to reduce water use. In Ref. [31], tomatoes in a greenhouse
    are monitored, and the authors propose an analytical framework to assess the performance
    of different tested configurations by relying on plant transpiration. The works
    in Refs. [27,32] consider the use of low-cost and general purpose sensor nodes,
    built upon the Arduino platform and upon MICAz Motes, respectively, as information
    sources in greenhouses. Being able to deploy low-cost and easily replaceable sensor
    nodes is a priority for a larger adoption of SF techniques. A core demand is related
    to power consumption: battery-powered devices lasting several years, as for instance
    ZigBee ones in Ref. [27], are fundamental in farm deployments. Apart from FIWARE,
    a plethora of different platforms can be identified as enablers for SF [34]. Those
    platforms aggregate heterogeneous data, then analysed and interpreted in order
    to provide additional value. Here, semantic analyses have been proposed as well,
    like for instance the valuable work in Ref. [35]. The Agri-IoT architecture, a
    layered and complex framework, provides additional value to DSSs because it further
    facilitates informed and accurate decisions thanks to semantic web and real-time
    reasoning. 2.2.4. Decision Support Systems DSSs are one of the most used solutions
    for SF because they provide support to farmers, offering a point of access to
    useful information, according to the aim of the system, and suggesting a plausible
    course of action in a given context. Aims can be very different: minimising the
    impact of diseases in tomatoes by applying automatic climate control [37]; ‘time-to-sow’
    alerts, and cattle monitoring [38]; anticipating potential crop dysfunctions in
    a proactive way [39]; pest control [40]; selecting appropriate alternative crops
    in a given area [41]. Those are just few examples of what can be offered by recent
    developments of DSSs in the agricultural sector. 2.2.5. Considerations Some considerations
    can be made also here: for instance, looking at Fig. 2, it is visible how data
    is a relevant keyword for all clusters. This is a key topic in the context of
    SF, thus deepened in Section 3. A notable exception is visible in the cluster
    Unmanned Vehicles, in which system outnumbers data: this can be explained by taking
    into account that unmanned vehicles are typically considered in an autonomous
    scenario, i.e., within a system composed of several interacting parts. The keywords
    pertaining to the cluster Unmanned Vehicles take the most part of Fig. 2, graphically
    highlighting the technological complexity of designed systems, and the very large
    number of operations that can be performed by those. Finally, what in Fig. 1 can
    be put in relation with what presented in Fig. 2: as an example, in the former
    monitoring operations are practically ubiquitous, and this is confirmed by the
    large number of occurrences of keywords like thing (as in smart thing or IoT)
    and sensor in the latter. 3. Open challenges This section briefly discusses the
    open challenges hampering a larger adoption of SF, summarised in Fig. 3 as well.
    Several technologies pushing for a larger adoption of SF practices have already
    been cited within this work, such as fully autonomous flight control, early identification
    of plant diseases, and reliable virtual fences [1], as well as more general ones,
    as AI, robotics, high performance computing, IoT, and 5G, which are reported within
    the EU declaration cited in Section 1. AI probably represents the largest challenge
    at now and, at the same time, opportunity in several sectors, including the agricultural
    one. The EU is largely investing on it because convinced it will be the upcoming
    disruptive game changer. In fact, the AI4EU initiative, started at the beginning
    of 2019, aims at the transformation of AI into a compelling solution in several
    application scenarios. Download : Download full-size image Figure 3. Overview
    of open challenges in the SF field: technical challenges (on the right) are discussed
    in Section 3.1, non-technical challenges (on the left) are discussed in Section
    3.2. 3.1. Technical challenges Looking at sensor nodes and sensor networks, we
    refer to the valuable works in Refs. [14,42], which survey the use of fixed and
    mobile solutions. According to the authors, advances are needed to further lower
    costs and to design specific solutions for the agricultural context, which requires
    solutions able to resist to difficult conditions (e.g., specific soil properties,
    exposition to high/low temperature, water resistance, fine dusts, and so on).
    Further than costs, solutions are needed toward larger energy efficiency, including
    energy harvesting techniques, and reliability in data collection and transmission,
    in order to minimize the need of maintenance for the deployed solutions. Specific
    issues of the agricultural domain need targeted answers, in particular the deployment
    strategies, to be designed according to fields segmentation and to farmers’ requirements.
    One of the main drivers of the diffusion of WSN in agriculture has been IoT: it
    has marked the transition from closed-source systems and disconnected software
    solutions towards connected systems built upon interoperable solutions. Those
    characteristics are favorable to cost reduction and to easiness of integration.
    Challenges here are overall related to network capabilities, data security, and
    data privacy [33]. Data is one of the most critical topic in the agricultural
    sector. Data ownership, protection, and security are perceived as not sufficiently
    close to farmers’ needs, thus becoming threats to be mitigated, if not completely
    avoided. In more words, nowadays, digital solutions for SF are under-utilised
    because practitioners fear data misuse and the loss of control over their business.
    Data protection must be enhanced to transform into a transparent operation, keeping
    in mind that agriculture is typically a private business activity (i.e., a not
    transparent activity), and data transfers to external systems (e.g. cloud) must
    be controllable and well described to increase acceptance. An option towards larger
    acceptance comes from the possibility for farmers to benefit from business with
    their data, and to benefit from public and official data released in an open fashion.
    On this, the valuable work of the EU with the Galileo services is a notable example
    of good practice, collecting and releasing data through application programming
    interfaces [43]. Further from data, open and used standards for data handling
    is compelling to move towards horizontal solutions instead of vertical ones [44].
    Large IoT platforms generate huge amounts of data to be analysed, thus calling
    for data analytic techniques able to extract meaningful information. Nowadays,
    big data immediately come to mind [45] as a set of strategies towards this objective,
    but it must be noted that its application to agriculture is recent. Generally
    speaking, the big data paradigm goes in an opposite direction with respect to
    acquiring more control over own data by farmers. To counteract that, the possibility
    for farmers to economically gain from sharing and accessing large volumes of data
    works as an incentive [46]. In Ref. [47], the authors underline the difficulties
    in discovering and combining large heterogeneous datasets in the agro-environmental
    field, often complicated by lacking of metadata. Furthermore, the need for semantic
    analyses and interoperability is highlighted in Ref. [47]. Natural language processing
    and machine learning techniques play a role here, facilitated by existing initiatives
    for building and maintaining open large repositories for training purposes, like
    CINERGI by Earthcube. Once meaningful information is available thanks to raw data
    sources and to analytics techniques, decision making is performed. This is where
    machine learning techniques and, more generally, AI can be fully exploited toward
    autonomous systems. To this aim, a fundamental challenge is moving intelligence
    from cloud platforms to closer computation platforms, such as edge solutions,
    handling and processing data close to the source, thus reducing delays. Multi-Access
    Edge Computing (MEC), jointly with 5G, is expected to play a role here. In the
    case of agricultural autonomous systems, real-time constraints are more easily
    satisfied by edge solutions than remote centralised systems. According to Ref.
    [48], in order to build sustainable infrastructure, the several emerging architecture
    paradigms (with different degrees of centralised and distributed entities) must
    comply to open standards for both easiness of implementation and cost reduction.
    Environmental monitoring and real-time agricultural data analytics and control
    can benefit from those paradigms, for instance by providing localized information
    about pollution and pests in the vicinity of edge servers [49]. 3.2. Socio-economic
    and other non-technical challenges This section discusses non-technical issues
    still holding back a larger diffusion of SF, at least in the EU. In fact, uptake
    in EU is rather low if compared to what expected [50]. Incentives and policies
    play a large role, considering national and EU rules, economical and skills perspectives.
    In Ref. [50], the authors show how financial and government incentives are the
    most influential solution, followed by training and other non-financial support.
    Farmers’ concerns are related to the time to recover the investment, and to the
    difficulties in evaluating the advantages; small farms have almost no adoption
    at all, also because the machinery has no support for more advanced technology.
    Sole farmers show a large interest in SF tools, which may come as unexpected,
    because it reduces exposure to occupational accidents and injuries; anyway, those
    barriers still hold back its use [51]. Because of those reasons, initiatives like
    those presented in Section 1 have a significant socio-economic value: cooperative
    farming with support services for a better handling of costs and needed investments;
    hardware solutions to transform legacy equipment into SF-ready machinery to avoid
    too high initial costs and to have time to familiarise with new technology; secure
    and open platforms for sharing data and getting back useful information, helping
    in assessing potential advantages. Research activities aiming at reducing the
    agricultural digital divide have an impact as well, helping farmers with new ICT-based
    tools in their daily work; on the other hand, different strategies in designing
    innovative ICT tools must be considered, like using natural language [52] to explicitly
    take into account potentially low-literate speakers. Nowadays, the right to access
    and use the collected data is at the center of the discussion: COPA-COGECA, an
    European farming representative organisation, in cooperation with CEMA, the European
    agricultural machinery association, has recently released a code of conduct to
    grant the data originator (i.e., the farmer) a leading role in controlling the
    access to and the use of data.3 The concerns on data use and access have been
    explored also in Ref. [4], highlighting existing scepticism by Australian farmers
    and divergence of expectations between involved actors. On the one hand, marketers
    and traders expect that big data techniques increase the reliability of predictions
    in the market dynamics; on the other hand, farmers are convinced that power asymmetries
    will increase, thus acting as a brake. Similar considerations are in Ref. [53],
    when looking to Ireland: whilst recognizing that SF is a real opportunity for
    the farming context, potential challenges and risks should be carefully considered
    to anticipate and reduce the gap among winners and losers. 4. Conclusions and
    future directions In this work, we surveyed the most relevant research activities
    aiming at improving and encouraging the adoption of SF techniques in agricultural
    contexts. Large efforts are currently poured to boost ICT use, at least in the
    EU, where this analysis is focused. On the one hand, the already established use
    of sensor nodes and heterogeneous data sources, as well as simple analytic techniques,
    is pushing DSSs in the farms; on the other hand, a growing need is there for ever
    advancing technology and open standards to consolidate existing scenarios in an
    interoperable and low-cost manner, as well as programmes to help ICT diffusion
    in areas suffering from digital divide. In the future, technology will have a
    growing role in agriculture [6]. Several operations will be automatised, from
    planting to harvesting, thanks to increased robotisation, both terrestrial and
    aerial one. Soil information will be readily available, thus allowing for e.g.
    a finer control of pests and pesticides, combining local information with other
    data sources, like weather and pollution data. In the end, an increase in production
    is expected, joint with a reduction in chemicals today in use, thus reducing pressure
    on soil. SF has the potential for a rapid and efficient growth in coming years,
    supported by policies that can fuel both R&D efforts and farmers’ adoption through
    investments. Anyway, the main barriers at today, i.e., vertical solutions, reduced
    digital skills and high costs for farmers, poor telecommunication infrastructures,
    and concerns on data ownership and use must be carefully addressed by technical
    and non-technical actors to facilitate SF adoption. Declaration of Competing Interest
    The authors declare no conflict of interest. Acknowledgment This work has received

    • Eight global and regional agricultural monitoring systems are compared • Gaps
    in data are described, where cropland maps, crop calendars and meteorological
    data are viewed as the most critical • Gaps in methods include the need for better
    predictions of yield and crop production and how to operationalize research methods
    • New sources of remote sensing data, greater data sharing and new sources of
    information, e.g. from mobile phones, will all help to improve agricultural monitoring
    Abstract Global and regional scale agricultural monitoring systems aim to provide
    up-to-date information regarding food production to different actors and decision
    makers in support of global and national food security. To help reduce price volatility
    of the kind experienced between 2007 and 2011, a global system of agricultural
    monitoring systems is needed to ensure the coordinated flow of information in
    a timely manner for early warning purposes. A number of systems now exist that
    fill this role. This paper provides an overview of the eight main global and regional
    scale agricultural monitoring systems currently in operation and compares them
    based on the input data and models used, the outputs produced and other characteristics
    such as the role of the analyst, their interaction with other systems and the
    geographical scale at which they operate. Despite improvements in access to high
    resolution satellite imagery over the last decade and the use of numerous remote-sensing
    based products by the different systems, there are still fundamental gaps. Based
    on a questionnaire, discussions with the system experts and the literature, we
    present the main gaps in the data and in the methods. Finally, we propose some
    recommendations for addressing these gaps through ongoing improvements in remote
    sensing, harnessing new and innovative data streams and the continued sharing
    of more and more data. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords

    is high on the agenda of the Sustainable Development Goals (United Nations, 2015),
    in particular SDG 2 to “End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition,
    and promote sustainable agriculture”. Despite significant advances in sustainable
    global agricultural production, this remains a key challenge due to the complex
    interaction between factors such as extreme weather patterns, rising levels of
    population and wealth, water scarcity, increases in energy costs and civil conflicts
    (Godfray et al., 2010). Between 2007 and 2011, there were significant increases
    in world food prices of major commodities (i.e. maize, wheat, rice), which sparked
    political and social unrest around the world (UN, 2011). Shifts towards a meat-based
    diet in many developing countries, increases in oil prices, which had a knock-on
    effect on fertilizer prices, financial speculation and insufficient stocks of
    major grain commodities in the main agricultural producing countries were suggested
    as possible drivers, among others (Adam and Ajakaiye, 2011; Headey and Fan, 2010).
    To better prepare for disruptions in food supply and global crop market price
    fluctuations of the types witnessed over the last 10 years, timely and accurate
    information on current and forecasted global food production is needed (Wu et
    al., 2014). Improved monitoring will enable more accurate forecasting of commodity
    prices and a better understanding of the key risks in food supply, helping to
    reduce global food insecurity (Justice and Becker-Reshef, 2007). Agricultural
    monitoring on a regional and national level has been in place for decades, e.g.
    the Global Information and Early Warning System (GIEWS) from the Food and Agriculture
    Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network
    (FEWS NET) from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID),
    CropWatch in China, and the Monitoring Agriculture with Remote Sensing (MARS)
    system from the European Commission (EC). These systems have tended to operate
    somewhat independently with little sharing of information, where the focus has
    been on either food security for developing countries or food production for the
    global market. The United States Department of Agriculture''s Foreign Agricultural
    Service (USDA-FAS) was the first system to provide globally comprehensive information
    on crop production and crop condition (Becker-Reshef et al., 2010). These crop
    production estimates are also used as economic indicators, for early warning alerts,
    in foreign aid assessments for food import needs, in commercial market trends
    and analysis, and in trade policy and exporter assistance. However, it was recognized
    that national and regional monitoring systems cannot effectively monitor agriculture
    at all scales so there needs to be greater coordination and sharing of information,
    i.e. a Global Agricultural Monitoring System of Systems (Justice and Becker-Reshef,
    2007). The Group on Earth Observations (GEO) became the ideal body to launch the
    flagship initiative GEOGLAM (GEO GLobal Agricultural Monitoring), which has become
    the mechanism for bringing together key players in the global agricultural monitoring
    community, to share information internationally, and to produce two regular bulletins
    (one for the Agricultural Market Information System (AMIS) and one for Early Warning
    covering approximately 95% of the world''s croplands) that represents consensus
    of the current situation globally. Other initiatives have also been launched that
    support GEOGLAM, e.g. the Anomaly Hot Spots of Agricultural Production (ASAP)
    system, which started in 2017 (Rembold et al., 2017). To gain a better understanding
    of the current state of global agricultural monitoring, eight major operational
    systems were identified that either play an important role in regional or global
    agricultural monitoring or which contribute to GEOGLAM at an international scale.
    This paper also provides a comprehensive update to the previous review of agricultural
    monitoring systems provided by Atzberger (2013). Each of these systems are briefly
    described along with the results from two questionnaires that were used to gather
    information about each system. The first focused on a series of questions regarding
    the system inputs and outputs as well as general questions about geographical
    scope, stakeholders, interactions with other systems, etc. A second questionnaire
    was used to gauge the importance of (i) different data inputs, which are then
    described along with state-of-the-art developments from the literature (Section
    4.1) and (ii) perceived gaps in methodologies, which are described in Section
    4.2. The paper concludes with an outlook to the future, including recommendations
    for how these gaps might be addressed. 2. Description of the main global and regional
    scale agricultural monitoring systems At present there are eight operational regional
    and global scale agricultural monitoring systems that provide information to stakeholders
    to support evidence-based decision making. A brief overview of each system is
    provided below in chronological order of their establishment. Some of these systems
    are part of more comprehensive food security monitoring initiatives (e.g. FEWS
    NET and GIEWS) but the aim of this paper is to focus on a comparison of the global
    crop production components. 2.1. Global information and early warning system (GIEWS)
    Established in the early 1970s, GIEWS1 was one of the first key global sources
    of information on food production and food security within FAO. The system provides
    regular bulletins of food crop production and markets on a global scale, as well
    as more specific regional reports based on intelligence from FAO''s regional and
    country offices. GIEWS includes a network of 115 governments, 61 non-governmental
    organizations (NGOs) and numerous trade, research and media organizations. The
    GIEWS team continuously monitors the world''s food supply and demand situation,
    using geospatial data as an auxiliary variable to detect weather-related problems
    that could have an impact on food security in member countries. In addition to
    rainfall estimates and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), GIEWS
    uses the Agricultural Stress Index (ASI), adopted in 2013, an indicator for early
    identification of agricultural areas that may be affected by dry spells or droughts
    (Rojas et al., 2011), which was designed to fill an information gap in the existing
    early warning system. Every ten days, the ASIS (ASI System) generates a map showing
    hotspots where crops are affected by water stress during the growing period, which
    are then verified by data from public institutions or using agrometeorological
    models based on data obtained from national meteorological networks, which ultimately
    show indicator convergence (Rojas, 2015). 2.2. Famine early warning systems network
    (FEWS NET) In 1985, the FEWS NET system2 was initiated by USAID to provide decision
    support to food assistance programs and relief agencies (Funk and Verdin, 2010).
    FEWS NET attempts to quantify both changes in the area planted as well as crop
    yield but does not monitor production directly (Brown, 2008). Currently covering
    36 of the world''s most food-insecure countries, the system not only publishes
    specialized monthly reports on current and projected food security but also provides
    timely alerts on emerging crises. FEWS NET follows a convergence of evidence strategy
    to achieve its goals. Data from field assessments, agro-climatology, market/price
    monitoring, nutrition surveillance and conflicts are combined to build scenarios,
    carry out livelihood analysis and produce information for effective decision support.
    In additional to quarterly outlook reports, FEWS NET updates scenarios monthly
    as new information becomes available. FEWS NET draws heavily on agro-climatology
    data for its food security analysis, relying mostly on anomaly analysis (Senay
    et al., 2015). 2.3. MARS crop yield forecasting system (MCYFS) In 1992, the MARS
    program of the JRC developed the operational MARS Crop Yield Forecasting System
    (MCYFS) to fill the need for operational estimates of area, yield and production
    at pan-European level for EU member states. It is operated under the mandate of
    the European regulation No 1306/2013 (Art. 6 and 22). This regulation stipulates
    an agricultural monitoring system and production and yield forecasts to manage
    agricultural markets. As a decision support system, the MCYFS provides independent
    and evidence-based information on the status of annual crops in the EU and neighboring
    countries by monitoring crop growth and forecasting crop yields (Supit et al.,
    1994; Baruth et al., 2008; Gallego et al., 2010; Duveiller, 2012; Boogaard et
    al., 2013; Bojanowski et al., 2013; López-Lozano et al., 2015). The MCYFS is based
    on near real-time acquisition and processing of three main data sources: weather
    data (observations and forecasts), crop model simulations, and biophysical parameters
    derived from satellite remote sensing to monitor the crop status. All these data
    plus a time series of historic area and yield statistics are used within a statistical
    yield forecasting process. Monthly MARS bulletins are published that provide an
    overview on the development of the main crops and areas of concern including yield
    forecasts for cereals, oilseeds, and tuber crops, a pasture analysis and country
    specific analyses. Near real-time and historic information on weather conditions
    and the progress of crop growth can be visualized via the JRC MARS Explorer3.
    Maps for several weather and crop indicators are available and the information
    is updated three times per month. 2.4. CropWatch CropWatch4, which is led by the
    Institute of Remote Sensing and Digital Earth at the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
    evaluates national and global crop production. Started in 1998, the aim of this
    system is to provide timely, reliable and independent predictions of crop conditions
    and production, both within China and globally, in order to plan crop imports,
    exports, and prices and ensure national food security (Wu et al., 2014). Since
    2013, CropWatch has been releasing bulletins internationally. Four spatial levels
    are considered: global, regional, national (thirty-one key countries including
    China), and sub-national (for the nine largest countries). These thirty-one countries
    encompass more than 80% of both production and exports of maize, rice, soybean
    and wheat. Global patterns of growing conditions are analyzed using indicators
    for rainfall, temperature, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) as well as
    potential biomass. At the regional scale, other indicators such as the Vegetation
    Health Index (VHI) and the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) are used to characterize
    the crop situation, farming intensity and stress. CropWatch also carries out detailed
    crop condition analyses at the national and sub-national scale with a comprehensive
    array of variables and indicators to derive food production estimates (Wu et al.,
    2015). 2.5. United States Department of Agriculture-Foreign Agricultural Service
    (USDA-FAS) After Hurricane Mitch devastated Honduras in 1998, the Honduran Ministry
    of Agriculture needed near real-time information on agriculture during the reconstruction
    period. Hence in 2001 the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) of the US Department
    of Agriculture (USDA)5 began the Crop Explorer service, which provides remote
    sensing-based information used by agricultural economists and researchers to predict
    global crop production. The system automates the extraction and processing of
    agro-meteorological indicators from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer),
    TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason-1 satellites to publish data visualization products every
    10 days. FAS also has the responsibility of providing market intelligence in the
    form of timely, objective, unclassified, global crop conditions and production
    estimates, for all major commodities, for all foreign countries. These estimates
    are an integral part of the World Agricultural Production and World Agricultural
    Supply and Demand numbers used by the US Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
    as economic indicators. To accomplish this task, FAS synthesizes information from
    its global network of marketing experts, agricultural economists, meteorologists
    and remote sensing scientists. In addition to the crop production information
    from foreign government reports and field visits, remote sensing is used to help
    verify these reports. A series of data sets coupled with meteorological data and
    crop models have significantly improved the USDA-FAS'' operational capacities
    to monitor and forecast global crop production. These data sets come from the
    Global Agricultural Monitoring (GLAM) project, initiated in 2002, which is a collaborative
    research project between USDA-FAS, the University of Maryland (UMD), the Global
    Inventory Monitoring and Modelling Studies (GIMMS) at NASA, and South Dakota State
    University (SDSU) (Becker-Reshef et al., 2010). The GLAM project focuses on the
    integration and analysis of MODIS data products to feed the USDA-FAS decision
    support system. The initiative combines multiple satellite data resources including
    NDVI from GIMMS and MODIS, among others. In USDA-FAS, change in crop area estimates
    and mid-season dominant crop masks are computed using semi-automated classification
    algorithms and remote sensing data. Mid-season to end-of-season yield estimates
    and maps are produced using regression and analog year algorithms derived from
    MODIS NDVI data. 2.6. GEOGLAM As mentioned in the introduction, GEOGLAM6 is a
    flagship initiative from GEO, which was endorsed by the G20 in 2011 to provide
    the Agricultural Market Information System (AMIS) with an assessment of crop growing
    conditions, crop status and agro-climatic conditions that may have an impact on
    global production of wheat, maize, rice and soy. Documented in the Crop Monitor
    bulletin, these assessments have been produced operationally since September 2013.
    Crop Monitor assessments are conducted during the final ten days of each month
    to ensure timely information for the Crop Monitor. A conference call is held each
    month with a group of international experts to discuss and review these assessments,
    which have been generated from a variety of independent, yet complementary, sources
    and to provide an opportunity to reach consensus on any discrepancies. The consensus
    information is then compiled into a report, which is reviewed iteratively by the
    partners. 2.7. World Food Programme Seasonal Monitor Since 2014, the Seasonal
    Monitor system7 of the World Food Programme (WFP) has been operational, primarily
    to monitor growing season status and to provide early warning of conditions detrimental
    to crop and pasture production within WFP regions of interest. The reason for
    the development of this system was the need for more detailed information than
    was available from other systems as well as the ability to produce tailored outputs
    for internal customers. The system derives indicators from near real-time rainfall
    estimates (CHIRPS) and NDVI (MODIS) data. A range of outputs is produced, mainly
    aggregations of rainfall amounts at varying time scales, dates of onset of the
    growing season and vegetation index, as well as anomalies of most parameters.
    The main outputs of the system are region specific reports with an approximate
    monthly frequency describing the current growing season conditions and providing
    an outlook for the months ahead based on available seasonal forecast information.
    Another perspective on growing season monitoring is provided by Dataviz8, a visualization
    platform from WFP, that includes data from the Seasonal Explorer where users can
    obtain charts of time series of seasonal rainfall and NDVI values and anomalies
    for administrative regions: from administrative Level 0 (country), Level 1 (state,
    province, region, governorate, etc.) and Level 2 (district, locality, county),
    as well as data from the Economic Explorer, where price and price-forecast information
    is also shown. The data from the Seasonal Monitor can be obtained for the entire
    administrative unit or for only the areas covered by cropland or pasture (according
    to a land cover layer). 2.8. ASAP (Anomaly Hot Spots of Agricultural Production)
    The final system is the Anomaly Hot Spots of Agricultural Production (ASAP)9,
    launched by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission (EC) in
    June 2017. This information system was developed both for EC use and for making
    contributions to multi-agency information systems such as GEOGLAM. ASAP focuses
    on finding areas where unfavorable growing conditions for both crops and rangelands
    may represent a potential food security problem (Rembold et al., 2017) and informs
    EU-supported food security assessments such as the Integrated Food Security Classification
    and the Global Report on Food Crises. There are two parts to this system. In the
    first part, rainfall estimates and the NDVI derived from remote sensing are used
    to automatically generate warnings at the first sub-national level regarding potential
    problems with crop and rangeland production globally. These early warnings are
    issued every 10 days when new rainfall and NDVI data become available. The second
    part of the system involves using agricultural monitoring experts to verify these
    ‘hotspots’ of potential food security problems for around 80 countries with high
    risk of food insecurity; these assessments are updated on a monthly basis. The
    main added value of the ASAP system is that it analyzes the available Earth Observation
    (EO) and weather data and turns this into short warning messages that do not require
    a background in geospatial data analysis to be useful for decision makers. The
    ASAP complements the information available through the MCYFS, covering food insecure
    areas outside of Europe. 3. Comparison of the main global and regional scale agricultural
    monitoring systems To compare the eight systems, a questionnaire was used to collect
    information about each system, which can be found in the Supplementary Information.
    Table 1 summarizes the data and models used by each system while Fig. 1 quantifies
    the number of sources of input data used. Fig. 2 indicates the degree to which
    the different systems use five main sources of information, i.e. meteorological
    data, crop models, optical satellite remote sensing, analyst input and other auxiliary
    data sets. Table 1. Data and model inputs used by each monitoring system obtained
    from the questionnaire. Check marks or text indicate that the systems use the
    data or model inputs while a dash indicates non-usage or non-applicability. The

    monitoring systems in terms of the degree to which they use different sources
    of input data. The reference is the following: 3, exclusively; 2, a lot; 1, a
    little; and 0, not at all. The results show that all of the systems make use of
    meteorological data and remote sensing information although many of the meteorological
    data are derived from remote sensing (Table 1). Only the MARS MCYFS uses interpolated
    data from stations while ASAP uses gridded meteorological data from atmospheric
    models. The sources of remote sensing used vary across the systems (Table 1),
    with CropWatch, USDA-FAS (Crop Explorer) and GEOGLAM using the highest number
    of different remote sensing products (Fig. 1). Each of the systems that use crop
    models employ different ones although GEOGLAM obtains inputs from FEWS NET and
    GIEWS in their crop condition modelling (Table 1). A range of different auxiliary
    data sets are used by each of the systems (Table 1) with GIEWS, MCYFS MARS, USDA-FAS
    (Crop Explorer) and CropWatch using >10 different sources of additional data (Fig.
    1). Almost all of the systems forecast crop conditions while some systems additionally
    forecast cropping intensity, i.e. the number of crops grown per year, crop area,
    crop yield, crop production and crop production anomalies or crop area affected
    by critical anomalies. The GIEWS and USDA-FAS systems additionally make forecasts
    of other data such as crop stage and start of the season while USDA-FAS also forecasts
    the number of dry days and has the highest number of forecasting outputs (Fig.
    1). Fig. 2 shows that no system relies entirely on any one type of input of the
    five shown, i.e. meteorological data, crop models, optical remote sensing, analyst
    input or auxiliary data. The USDA-FAS and FEWS NET make considerable use of all
    five sources while systems like Seasonal Monitor use mostly optical remote sensing
    data and analyst inputs, supplemented with meteorological data from remote sensing
    and auxiliary data. Of the remaining systems, the importance of meteorological
    data is evident, while crop models, optical remote sensing, analyst input and
    auxiliary data are of varying importance to the systems. The system outputs and
    the dissemination across the different systems is summarized in Table 2. All the
    systems produce NDVI profiles and produce outputs related to anomalies. All the
    systems produce phenological analyses except for GEOGLAM and the Seasonal Monitor
    and only GEOGLAM does not produce rainfall profiles. All the systems produce some
    type of bulletin or report except for ASAP, which disseminates the information
    online via web services and GIS files. FEWS NET also disseminates many GIS layers
    used in their analyses, e.g. rainfall estimates, anomalies, the Water Requirement
    Satisfaction Index, etc. Except for GEOGLAM, which only produces the Crop Monitor,
    the other systems produce several outputs with USDA-FAS (Crop Explorer) producing
    the largest number (Fig. 1). Regarding the accuracy of the system outputs, there
    are few quantitative assessments available for the operational systems considered
    here. One example is provided by Van der Velde and Nisini (2018; this Virtual
    Special Issue), who found that for the end-of-campaign MCYFS crop yield forecasts
    from 1993 to 2015, the lowest median mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) across
    all crops was obtained for Europe''s largest producer at 3.73%, while the highest
    median MAPE was obtained for Portugal, at 14.37%. MCYFS forecasts generally underestimated
    reported yields, with a systematic underestimation across all member states for
    soft wheat, rapeseed and sugar beet forecasts. Forecasts generally improved during
    the growing season; both the forecast error and its variability tend to progressively
    decrease. Egelkraut et al. (2003) undertook a quality assessment of crop forecasts
    from the USDA and found that errors were larger for maize than soybeans, but similar
    to the MCYFS, the forecasts improved as the season progressed. The outputs from
    these systems clearly require more evaluation, which should be made transparent
    and published. Table 2. System outputs and dissemination by the various global
    and regional scale agricultural monitoring systems obtained from the questionnaire.

    sub-national and pixel level which also mirrors the resolution of their outputs.
    Other systems use combinations of either national/sub-national or sub-national/pixel,
    reflecting different information needs. FEWS NET also disseminates their output
    by livelihood zones. Five of the systems disseminate early warning information
    during the growing season on a dekadal (10-day) or monthly basis. Only the CropWatch
    system releases information on a quarterly and annual basis while the Seasonal
    Monitor aims to produce three reports per growing season. The dissemination schedule
    for GEOGLAM is very much driven by the need to provide information to AMIS on
    a monthly basis. Table 3 contains other characteristics of the monitoring systems
    that were asked in the questionnaire. For example, the role of the analyst is
    quite similar across systems, e.g. they undertake different types of agrometeorological
    and statistical analyses, synthesize information from multiple sources and contribute
    to reports. However, some systems are more automated compared to others, e.g.
    WFP''s Seasonal Monitor and the ASAP system require some degree of expert knowledge
    to judge how severe a drought is, for example, while the ASIS system produces
    a map that directly indicates where and how severe the anomaly is. In the future,
    these systems may require more automation in order to deal with the increasing
    amounts of big data. All of the systems have a mechanism for dealing with situations
    where information sources disagree, which are flagged by the analysts and generally
    involves expert intervention and cross-validation with additional data sources.
    GEOGLAM, in particular, has a transparent approach to finding consensus from the
    different system assessments and data sources. In fact, all of the systems contribute
    to GEOGLAM''s Crop Monitor but there is also interaction and use of products between
    systems. Most of the systems provide some open access to their GIS outputs, some
    are planning to open more of their data in the future while MCYFS MARS and GEOGLAM
    currently do not have any outputs that are openly available as GIS layers. The
    areas covered by the systems is largely global. FEWS NET has more activities in
    certain regions but their data sets offer global coverage while MCYFS MARS is
    more focused on Europe and neighboring countries. GEOGLAM also focuses on countries
    that cover around 95% of all cropped area. There is a wide range of stakeholders
    to whom the information is of interest including government ministries and EU
    departments, aid organizations, agribusiness and other relevant industries and
    AMIS, as a direct user of the GEOGLAM Crop Monitor. Table 3. Additional characteristics

    Observation. 4. Gaps in agricultural monitoring needs Discussions with each of
    the monitoring systems was initially used to determine what the current data gaps
    in agricultural monitoring are. To formalize this gap analysis, a second questionnaire
    was used to determine the importance of different data inputs to the system, including
    cropland maps, crop calendars, maps of cropping intensity and crop types, crop
    management data sets, meteorological data, and statistical and in-situ data on
    agricultural production, yield and area. These gaps, along with state of the art,
    are described in section 4.1. There was also a question about the main methodological
    gaps perceived by each system, which are summarized in section 4.2. This second
    questionnaire is provided in the Supplementary Information. 4.1. Data gaps Fig.
    3 summarizes the level of importance of different sources across all agricultural
    monitoring systems while Fig. S1 shows the breakdown of answers by individual
    system. Cropland maps, crop calendars, statistics on agricultural production and
    meteorological data are considered very to extremely critical by more than half
    of the systems. Each of these data gaps are now discussed in the sections that
    follow. Download : Download high-res image (134KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 3. The level of importance of different types of information for agricultural
    monitoring. 4.1.1. Cropland maps Seven out of eight systems identified global
    cropland maps as being critical or very critical to their systems. Cropland is
    captured in one or more land cover types within global land cover maps although
    Fritz et al. (2011) have shown that there is considerable disagreement between
    the major land cover products with respect to cropland. Specific cropland maps
    have also been produced (Biradar et al., 2009; Pittman et al., 2010; Thenkabail
    et al., 2009; Yu et al., 2013) but each of these also has associated uncertainties
    in cropland definitions, the methods used, issues with spectral separation, particularly
    when there are seasonal effects, and cloud cover in certain regions when using
    optical data, etc. (Gong et al., 2016). Very fragmented landscapes typical of
    smallholder farmers will require higher resolution images to meet the accuracy
    requirements (Waldner and Defourny, 2017). The latest 30 m cropland map produced
    by Xiong et al. (2017) has an overall accuracy of 94% (defined as the percentage
    of correctly classified sample locations) but a user''s accuracy of 68.5%, which
    is a class specific accuracy for cropland that indicates how often this class
    will actually be present on the ground so still requires improvement. Yearly updates
    are desirable, especially in regions where cropland can be very dynamic, such
    as the Sahel, but this is not yet available operationally on a global scale. ESA''s
    Sentinel 2 for Agriculture (Sen2Agri)10 project recently released an open source
    and portable toolbox to derive dynamic cropland maps in an operational fashion
    from Sentinel 2 and Landsat-8 time series (Matton et al., 2015; Valero et al.,
    2016), which shows promising results. The global hybrid cropland map produced
    by IIASA and IFPRI (Fritz et al., 2015), the Unified Cropland Layer (Waldner et
    al., 2016), and the GLC-SHARE hybrid land cover product (FAO, 2015a) represent
    another approach in which multiple cropland or land cover products have been merged
    to produce the best characterization of cropland or land cover at a particular
    location. The IIASA-IFPRI product has also been calibrated using FAO statistics
    so that it can be used in global models that require official statistics. A similar
    approach has been used to build the cropland and rangeland maps of ASAP, where
    six global and 16 regional land cover data sets were compared at the country level
    using multi-criteria decision analysis to select the most suitable ones for agricultural
    monitoring (Pérez-Hoyos et al., 2017). As it is clear that more effort is required
    to accurately map the world''s cropland, Waldner et al. (2015) have compiled existing
    cropland maps to highlight priority areas for improving cropland mapping. 4.1.2.
    Crop calendars Similar to global cropland maps, global crop calendars were viewed
    as being critical to very critical by all of the eight systems although the MCYFS
    system uses only European ones. Crop calendars contain the planting and harvesting
    dates of different crop types for an area or region. These are useful for crop
    condition monitoring, crop type area estimation and crop yield forecasting and
    estimation, among other applications. Agricultural policies, the mobilization
    of food aid and the movement of commodities to market would also benefit from
    accurate knowledge of harvest timing. Furthermore, such information could contribute
    to the UN SDG goal 12.3 to reduce post-harvest losses (IAEG-SDGs, 2016). FAO provides
    crop calendars for a large variety of crops for 44 African countries by agro-ecological
    zone (FAO, 2010). This type of information is traditionally gathered from household
    surveys and national censuses, which is time consuming to collect and maintain.
    Moreover, the use of agro-ecological zones fails to capture regional variations.
    As part of the MIRCA2000 data set, crop calendars were constructed for 402 spatial
    units from censuses, national reports and other relevant databases, using global
    monthly irrigated and rainfed crop areas (Portmann et al., 2010) as an input.
    A similar approach was taken by Sacks et al. (2010) but additional sources of
    sub-national data were used, and the full range of planting and harvesting dates
    in a region were provided rather than the most typical one. Although both of these
    data sets are global, they have similar limitations to the FAO crop calendar,
    i.e. they fail to capture spatial variations due to the coarse resolution of the
    underlying national and sub-national data. More recently, Laborte et al. (2017)
    produced the global RiceAtlas with crop calendars for rice production. Other approaches
    involve modelling of planting dates based on climate data (Stehfest et al., 2007;
    Sacks et al., 2010; Waha et al., 2012) and the use of remote sensing. For example,
    Harvest Choice and the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) used
    NDVI from MODIS to derive a crop calendar data set at a 1 km resolution for sub-Saharan
    Africa (Guo, 2013; HarvestChoice, 2013) while Kotsuki and Tanaka (2015) used NDVI
    from SPOT-VEGETATION to develop the SAtellite-derived CRop calendar for Agricultural
    simulations (SACRA), a global crop calendar for 6 major crop types. A comparison
    of SACRA with MIRCA2000 and the product of Waha et al. (2012) showed large discrepancies
    in places; hence it was not possible to determine which product was the best overall.
    Developed from an agricultural monitoring perspective, Whitcraft et al. (2015a)
    used 10 years of NDVI from MODIS to identify the start, peak and end of the agricultural
    growing season for all major crops together at a resolution of 30 arcmin. This
    product is useful for identifying the periods during which cropland areas should
    be monitored by EO, thereby informing strategies for image acquisition. ASAP also
    makes use of remote sensing based phenology from 15 years of MODIS data and the
    outputs have been compared with FAO and USDA national level crop calendars to
    derive sub-national calendars. ASAP uses and re-distributes the sub-national crop
    calendars for all administrative units where there is a match between the remote
    sensing based phenology and FAO/USDA crop calendars. The GIEWS ASIS system uses
    phenology from a time series of longer than 30 years from METOP and NOAA AVHRR
    (1984-present). The lack of calibration and validation data sets that adequately
    represent geographic diversity and spatial and inter-annual variability in sowing
    and harvesting dates has slowed the advancement of remote sensing-based approaches.
    Therefore, the establishment of an openly accessible database of samples of sowing
    and harvesting dates across major and minor agricultural areas of the world and
    across multiple years would greatly advance the use of remotely sensed information
    in agricultural phenology, which would bolster the entire enterprise of EO-based
    cropland monitoring. Crowdsourcing and self-reporting by farmers may also provide
    more phenological data in the future. 4.1.3. Maps of cropping intensity (CI) Cropping
    intensity (CI) refers to the number of crops grown within a year, and can provide
    valuable information regarding food security (Jain et al., 2013). Both FEWS NET
    and WFP''s Seasonal Monitor view information about CI as very critical while four
    other systems viewed this information as critical. There have been a number of
    studies using remote sensing to determine CI in Asian countries (Jain et al.,
    2013; Gray et al., 2014) and China in particular (Qiu et al., 2014; Yan et al.,
    2014; Ding et al., 2016; Qiu et al., 2017) but there is currently no global data
    set available (Iizumi and Ramankutty, 2015). Using only MODIS data, Gray et al.
    (2014) found that they underestimated the number of cropping cycles due to missing
    data, particularly during cloud-covered monsoon periods, and recommended the use
    of data from multiple sensors. Other studies have shown the importance of adding
    other types of data such as agricultural statistics or outputs from crop models
    (e.g. Qiu et al., 2014). Although the agricultural statistics from FAO implicitly
    contain information on multiple cropping in the total production and area harvested
    figures, the CI data are not recorded (Iizumi and Ramankutty, 2015). Thus, it
    is important to build a global database with this information, both nationally
    and at the sub-national level, to aid in the development of global maps of CI.
    4.1.4. Maps of crop type Maps of crop type were viewed as very critically important
    by half of the systems and critical by two others. Neither the ASIS system of
    GIEWS or the MCYFS of MARS uses crop type information; in the case of MARS, agricultural
    statistics are used instead. Spatially explicit crop type maps have been produced
    by downscaling national and sub-national statistics using different methodologies.
    The M3 Cropping System Model (Ramankutty et al., 2008) consists of harvested area
    and yield downscaled for 175 crops including tree crops and managed grasslands.
    Using remote sensing, cropland and pasture maps are constructed at a 5 arc-minute
    resolution and national and sub-national agricultural data are then downscaled
    using a regression approach. The MIRCA2000 data set is a downscaling of 26 crops
    for rainfed and irrigated systems (Portmann et al., 2010) and uses the M3 data
    as a starting point. It also provides a further temporal disaggregation by month.
    The SPAM product (You et al., 2014) uses a cross-entropy approach to downscale
    area and yield for >40 crops into high-input irrigated, high-input rainfed and
    low-input rainfed production systems using additional information such as crop
    prices, population density and suitability. Products are available for both 2000,
    which used the M3 cropland extent as an input, and 2005, which uses the IIASA-IFPRI
    global cropland map (Fritz et al., 2015). The Global Agroecological Zones (GAEZ)
    cropping system model has produced gridded harvested area and yield by downscaling
    agricultural statistics for 23 crop types using an approach similar to SPAM although
    the underlying cropland extent is based on suitability. Anderson et al. (2014)
    compared these four products and found large discrepancies between them, which
    are caused by differences in the input data used, in particular the underlying
    cropland extent, as well as the methodologies used for downscaling. Hence there
    are clear uncertainties in all of these products and only the SPAM data set is
    being updated every 5 years. Remote sensing is another approach for constructing
    maps of crop type (Boryan et al., 2011), which holds more promise for the construction
    of annual crop type maps globally on an operational basis. However, much of the
    crop type mapping to date has used MODIS data and has only been demonstrated on
    test areas (Wardlow and Egbert, 2008; Ozdogan, 2010; Brown et al., 2013). More
    recently, Salmon et al. (2015) have produced a global map of irrigated, rainfed
    and paddy croplands using various MODIS products and other agroclimatological
    data but this does not include the major crop types except for wetland rice. Inglada
    et al. (2015) have developed a processing chain for creating crop type maps at
    the global scale using Landsat and SPOT data, which has also been applied to Sentinel
    2 data as part of the Sen2Agri project for Ukraine, Mali, South Africa and selected
    sites in other countries around the world with the aim of creating operational
    systems that can support GEOGLAM. Combining MODIS and Landsat data, high resolution
    soybean maps of the United States and Argentina have been constructed (King et
    al., 2017; Song et al., 2017). The integration of data from SAR (Synthetic Aperture
    Radar) with optical data also holds promise for crop type mapping as demonstrated
    by McNairn et al. (2009) in the construction of an operational annual crop inventory
    in Canada. While the methodological ability to derive crop type maps from time
    series of satellite images has been intensively demonstrated, the lack of seasonal
    calibration data for the classification appears as the main constraint to operationalization
    (see section 4.1.7). 4.1.5. Crop management data sets Five systems rated crop
    management data sets as critical while the remaining systems viewed this as less
    critical data. However, there is a clear lack of data on crop management practices,
    which are key factors that influence agricultural productivity, and spatially-explicit
    data sets are needed for crop growth models, which can simulate yields under different
    management practices. From an inventory of the main data sets available for different
    land management practices, Erb et al. (2017) highlighted the lack of data on tillage
    and nitrogen fertilization. Currently no data on tillage are available although
    promising approaches are being developed using Sentinel 1 (Atstaja, 2017) while
    there are spatially explicit global data sets on nitrogen fertilization (Liu et
    al., 2010; Potter et al., 2010; Mueller et al., 2012). These data sets are, however,
    derived from models, and they show large discrepancies between them. More recently,
    Lu and Tian (2017) downscaled national nitrogen and phosphorus use to a 30 arcmin
    resolution to create a gridded time series from 1961 to 2013. There are also a
    number of uncertainties with this data set, e.g. it does not take grassland fertilization
    into account so may overestimate fertilizer use in some areas, and the M3-crop
    distribution data set was used for crop types, which may lead to further uncertainty
    in the estimates. Crop management practices may also adversely affect the environment.
    Salinization, eutrophication and contamination of areas surrounding cropland,
    e.g. rivers, ground water but also populations of natural pollinators, are affected
    by over use of pesticide, and are common environmental problems related to agriculture.
    To understand their effect on the environment, researchers usually have to piece
    together information on fertilizers, pesticides and their dosages and frequency.
    A clear registry and characterization of these and other environmentally related
    practices from cropping areas in the world would be useful for building better
    spatially explicit products of crop management practices but also for evaluating
    their impacts on the environment, including soil health, water quality and biological
    activity around and in crop fields. 4.1.6. Meteorological data Six out of eight
    systems viewed meteorological data as being very important for their system performance
    where rainfall data are the most critical meteorological input. Rainfall estimates
    are used by all eight monitoring systems (Table 1). Although the most accurate
    rainfall is obtained from rain gauges, the spatial network of stations is too
    sparse, particularly in places where food security risks are greatest, creating
    spatial data gaps across many areas (Maidment et al., 2017). In general, the global
    meteorological station network has diminished and deteriorated in some developing
    countries, in particular Central Asia, and many stations cannot be maintained
    due to underfunding and insufficient national capacity (Rogers and Tsirkunov,
    2013). To complement ground-based meteorological data, and rainfall in particular,
    spatially explicit measurements can be obtained from atmospheric circulation models
    and satellite observations, e.g. precipitation forecasts from the European Centre
    for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), the rainfall estimates from the Climate
    Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) of the USGS, rainfall
    from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and the Tropical Applications
    of Meteorology using SATellite (TAMSAT), among others. Maidment et al. (2014)
    provide a comprehensive overview of available gauge and satellite rainfall data
    for Africa and compare seven different rainfall products, showing there are disagreements
    when compared with one another and with rain gauge data. There is clearly a tradeoff
    between products that incorporate rain gauge data but have shorter historical
    records compared to those with longer historical records but which do not use
    rain gauge information. Hence there are uncertainties around these products, which
    are further propagated in crop models that use satellite-based rainfall estimates.
    Rainfall estimation using radio interference in cellular networks (Overeem et
    al., 2013) is a promising avenue of ongoing research that may benefit agricultural
    monitoring in the future. Moreover, there are recent plans to increase the density
    of meteorological observations by deploying low cost sensors and by using cell
    phone towers as sites for meteorological stations (Rogers and Tsirkunov, 2013).
    4.1.7. Data on agricultural production, area and yield Six out of eight systems
    view this information as very critical or critical. The FAO has been compiling
    statistics relevant to agriculture in its FAOSTAT system for 245 countries and
    35 regions from 1961 to the most recent available year (FAO, 2015b). The data
    sets are based on censuses, agricultural samples and questionnaire-based surveys
    (FAO, 1996). Despite this vast historical record, there are several drawbacks
    of relying on the quality and accuracy of such national reports as there have
    been no attempts to harmonize data collection methods among the different countries
    (World Bank and FAO, 2011). National agricultural statistics are generated by
    many countries but their accuracy, timeliness and consistency over time and accessibility
    vary greatly. Some countries collect administrative data based either upon census,
    surveys or national sampling frames. Area frame sampling is a well-established
    statistical method for collecting agricultural data that cannot be obtained directly
    by satellite such as actual crop yield (Gallego, 2015). However, other countries
    have no established formal data collection process and there are no globally recognized
    standards for in-situ or survey data collection of agricultural statistics (Justice
    and Becker-Reshef, 2007). Since FAO statistics are reported nationally, FAOSTAT
    only provides limited information on agriculture, particularly when spatially
    explicit data are required (Anderson et al., 2014). The lack of sub-national agricultural
    statistics has been identified as a challenge to crop forecasting systems and
    remote sensing (Kayitakire, 2012). However, there are initiatives such as Agro-MAPS
    (Mapping of Agricultural Production Systems) to collect statistics on crop production,
    area and yield at the sub-national level (FAO et al., 2006) and FAO''s CountrySTAT11.
    Many researchers have also compiled sub-national statistics for many countries
    and crops as part of their studies, e.g. Ray et al. (2012), where the data should
    be placed in open data repositories for sharing. More in-situ yield data are needed
    to develop and validate crop models, which are used to make forecasts of production,
    or as inputs to statistical models for prediction of yield anomalies using remote
    sensing. Six out of eight systems viewed in-situ data as critical to very critical
    for their operation. The Land Parcel Information System (LPIS) is openly available
    in some countries across the EU, e.g. the Netherlands and Czech Republic, which
    may encourage other countries to open up their agricultural databases in the future.
    There are also sources of in-situ yield data available from crop trials, e.g.
    from FAO (van der Velde et al., 2013), the International Maize and Wheat Improvement
    Center (CIMMYT), the Global Yield Gap Atlas12, and the Global Agricultural Trial
    Repository and Database13 hosted by the CGIAR''s (Consultative Group on International
    Agricultural Research) Research Program on CCAFS (Climate Change, Agriculture
    and Food Security). The latter initiative is aimed at encouraging scientists to
    share their data within the community, where these data might otherwise remain
    locked within their own institutions (Smith et al., 2015). Advances in mobile
    phone and location-based technologies are also increasing the in-situ collection
    of yield data while the private sector is another potential source of data. However,
    the sharing of and access to these diverse data sets is not common. Crop growth
    models also require soil information as a critical input (Krishna Murthy, 2004).
    For yield forecasting for agricultural monitoring purposes, the Harmonized World
    Soil Database v1.2 (Nachtergaele et al., 2010) is available at a 1 km resolution,
    which has integrated existing regional and national soil data sets, many of which
    are available from the International Soil Reference and Information Centre (ISRIC).
    However, this map has been criticized for its coarse resolution and the fact that
    it does not represent the current soil condition but rather combines existing
    soil data sets from different time periods and of differing quality (Sanchez et
    al., 2009; Grunwald et al., 2011). Several other data sets of interest are available
    from ISRIC such as the Harmonized Global Soil Profile data set v3.1, containing
    >10 K soil profiles globally, gridded data sets of soil water capacity and the
    more recent SoilGrids250m product (Hengl et al., 2017). 4.2. Gaps in methods Although
    Jones et al. (2017) argue that data scarcity and limitations are more important
    than gaps in theory and approaches in agricultural system models, there are still
    missing pieces in the science behind agricultural monitoring and forecasting.
    To better understand these issues in the context of this paper, the eight global
    agricultural monitoring systems were surveyed for their perceptions regarding
    current methodological gaps. Three of the systems mentioned the need for better
    predictions of yield and crop production, which can either be realized through
    crop growth models or statistical models, e.g. based on NDVI. The review of agricultural
    system models by Jones et al. (2017) highlighted several recent reviews of crop
    models and their limitations, mostly related to the data but also recognizing
    the need for continued methodological developments. Gaining a better understanding
    of the differences between different input data sets is another gap that was identified.
    For example, precipitation varies between different sources; the same is true
    of different vegetation indices. Having a better understanding of where these
    data sets have discrepancies and why is very important for consensus in monitoring,
    and the tools for carrying out an automated comparison are currently lacking.
    Two other relevant points were raised. Some felt that it is not so much the methods
    that are lacking, since there is considerable scientific research taking place
    in many different areas related to agricultural monitoring, but rather the ability
    to operationalize these new methods. Hence there is a lag time between the emergence
    of scientific research and implementation as operational activities. The second
    point is related to lack of tools or methods for synthesizing the variety of information
    coming into the system for decision makers, which was also raised as a key issue
    by Jones et al. (2017). They mention the idea of a virtual laboratory in which
    scenarios could be defined under different spatial and temporal scales, which
    could produce outputs suitable for decision makers but which does not currently
    exist. Such tools should also allow inputs to the system to be weighted differently
    depending on the situation, e.g. a normal year versus a drought year, which was
    another comment raised in the survey. 5. Conclusions This paper compared eight
    global and regional scale agricultural monitoring systems that are currently supporting
    efforts to improve the world''s food security. The results of a questionnaire
    show that there are many similarities between them, in particular in their use
    of meteorological data and remote sensing. However, the systems are tailored to
    meet the needs of different customers and hence they differ in the importance
    they place on inputs to the system as well as how they disseminate their results.
    Data recorded by remote sensing satellites mainly assist with the assessment of
    crop condition and crop condition anomalies, which can then be used to infer information
    on yield, area and production reductions. However, this approach is not able to
    provide quantitative crop area and production forecasts as ideally needed for
    food security interventions. Crop growth and yield forecasting models are data
    intensive (daily meteorological inputs needed) and are currently applied only
    for the US by the USDA system and for Europe by the MCYFS. Moreover, remote sensing-based
    methods for agricultural statistical forecasting need historical archives of high
    quality statistics, which are not available in all countries. All global systems
    and in particular those covering food insecure countries use only remote sensing-based
    crop condition monitoring or basic water balance models. Crop production and area
    information in these countries is largely based on local expert knowledge (eg.
    USDA-FAS, FEWSNET and GIEWS). Also for the remote sensing-based monitoring systems,
    gaps in their baseline information are well documented. Moreover, when different
    basic (global) products are compared, e.g. cropland extent, crop types or rainfall
    estimates, they often show large differences. Hence knowing which product to use
    in an environment where more and more products are appearing remains a challenge.
    Within the context of crop condition monitoring and yield forecasting, moderate
    resolution data (10-100 m) has not achieved broad scale adoption across the globe,
    primarily due to the lack of consistent cloud free acquisitions with sufficiently
    high temporal resolution (Whitcraft et al. 2015b), but also due to barriers in
    operational adoption of EO-based methodologies related to gaps in technological
    expertise and challenges in accessing, downloading, storing, and managing the
    sizable data volumes this resolution produces. The GEOGLAM initiative has demonstrated
    that this is a priority growth area for analyses spanning the extent of cropland
    for fields of all sizes. GEOGLAM works closely with the Committee on Earth Observation
    Satellites (CEOS) – a consortium of the world''s civil space agencies – to confront
    issues of data acquisition, accessibility, and continuity. Examples of activity
    areas include developing data preprocessing standards to facilitate operational
    uptake of diverse data streams and cloud-based data dissemination systems and
    services. However, in order to make concrete progress towards enhancing the use
    of EO for agricultural monitoring, coordinated and complementary efforts to develop
    human and institutional capacity to use EO as they become increasingly available
    is equally critical. The transition of research-based methodologies to the operational
    domain hinges upon concerted efforts to document, preserve, and disseminate methods
    and guidance materials (i.e. training) to the broader agricultural community,
    a final step in research project timelines, which due to funding and scheduling
    constraints, is too often overlooked. Recently developed systems, however, are
    now making greater use of high resolution data in combination with cloud computing.
    This is the case, for example, for ASAP''s high resolution viewer, which retrieves
    Sentinel 2 and Landsat imagery for any GAUL1 unit globally and computes NDVI anomalies.
    The combination of cloud computing with image enhancement and time series processing
    techniques developed in the past for lower resolution data are a highly promising
    way of exploiting recent remote sensing data, although the short archives remain
    a limiting factor for anomaly computation. The launch of Sentinel 1, 2, 3 and
    Proba-V sensors addresses issues related to the availability of coarse and medium
    resolution imagery. For example, Sentinel 3 provides data at 300 m ground sample
    distance (GSD) and Proba-V at 100 m. Sentinel 2 already provides 10–20 m data
    at 5-day revisiting intervals although we still need archives for anomaly and
    change monitoring. The Venμs (Vegetation and Environment monitoring on a New MicroSatellite)
    sensor provides 12 spectral bands (at 5 m ground resolution) and a 2-day revisiting
    time. The hyperspectral HyspIRI will provide a spectral resolution of 10 nm, 19-day
    revisiting time and a spatial resolution of 60 m. Landsat 8, the Landsat data
    continuity mission (LDCM), includes two thermal bands for energy balance calculations,
    thereby providing new opportunities for crop monitoring (Atzberger, 2013). The
    German hyperspectral ENMAP will be launched in 2020. Finally, commercial image
    providers have also started to acquire hyper-temporal satellite image time series
    at <10 m resolution with constellations of microsatellites. For example, Planet
    seeks to provide a daily coverage of the Earth''s landmass at a 3-5 m resolution
    with the 175+ Dove satellites. However, as more of these big data streams from
    remote sensing are used for agricultural monitoring, more automated approaches
    such as that used by FAO-ASIS will be required. Furthermore, as mentioned previously,
    in order to advance the state of the science, more consistent calibration and
    validation protocols for crop monitoring applications as well as the data sets
    to support them are needed. Logistically, this would involve the development of
    a coherent regional-to-global scale sampling scheme that accounts for geographic
    heterogeneity in climate and in cultivation practices, the routine collection
    of agreed-upon ground data, and the stewardship of such data sets to facilitate
    access to and use by the broader agricultural monitoring community. This would
    become an open in-situ data repository of data sets that are currently missing,
    e.g. planting and harvesting dates, crop types, irrigation, fertilizer and pesticide
    applications, etc. Such an effort would advance the state of the science by improving
    the robustness and applicability of remote sensing-based approaches to monitor
    croplands in a diversity of settings. Similar to the University of California
    at Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository that maintains data sets for the machine
    learning community, an open repository of benchmarking data would also provide
    a one-stop-shop to test and compare new methods. The increased amount of smartphones
    all over the world, even among low income farmers, usually the group responsible
    for the largest agricultural uncertainties, allows for increased opportunities
    to self-report geo-located crops and parcel practices, including planting dates,
    fertilizer application, irrigation and expected yields, through the use of purpose-designed
    mobile applications. Although information reliability can be a concern if self-reported
    information is used as the basis for global monitoring of agricultural production,
    ways to improve the precision and reliability of such information can be built
    into these applications. Such ways may include incentives such as feedback with
    timely agronomic and market recommendations, tailored to the registered crop and
    area where it is grown. Hence, it could be guaranteed that the majority, if not
    all the information provided, is as accurate as possible. The food security and
    early warning community should also make greater use of the latent predictive
    capacity of social media and sources such as web search data (e.g. van der Velde
    et al., 2012) in the future. As an example, in 2016, farmers tweeted about their
    low, unexpected soft wheat yields, which were nearly 30% below the five year average
    and even lower than the yields obtained in 2003 that were affected by drought
    and heat waves. This situation was not picked up by early warning systems such
    as the MARS MCYFS so it represents an interesting source of ground-based information
    that can inform early warning systems. Finally, we need to work towards greater
    sharing of data and information. GEO plays a pivotal role in encouraging member
    countries and organizations to share their data via the GEOSS Common Infrastructure
    but finding more ways to unlock data sitting in offices, hard disks and closed
    cloud systems remains a continuing challenge. Acknowledgements This work was partly

    over the past decade. Due to this in recent era, climate-smart methods called
    as smart agriculture is adopted by many Indian farmers. Smart agriculture is an
    automated and directed information technology implemented with the IOT (Internet
    of Things). IOT is developing rapidly and widely applied in all wireless environments.
    In this paper, sensor technology and wireless networks integration of IOT technology
    has been studied and reviewed based on the actual situation of agricultural system.
    A combined approach with internet and wireless communications, Remote Monitoring
    System (RMS) is proposed. Major objective is to collect real time data of agriculture
    production environment that provides easy access for agricultural facilities such
    as alerts through Short Massaging Service (SMS) and advices on weather pattern,
    crops etc. Published in: 2016 International Conference on Global Trends in Signal

    India SECTION I. Introduction Agriculture is the basic source of livelihood of
    people in India. In past decade, it is observed that there is not much crop development
    in agriculture sector. Food prices are continuously increasing because crop rate
    is declined. It has pushed over 40 million people into poverty since 2010[1].
    There are number of factors which are responsible for this, it may be due to water
    waste, low soil fertility, fertilizer abuse, climate change or diseases, etc.
    It is very essential to make effective intervention in agriculture and the solution
    is lOT in integration with Wireless sensor networks. It has potential to change
    the way of development in agriculture and gives great contribution to make it
    smart agriculture. The internet of things involves a three-tier system. It includes
    perception layer, network layer and application layer. Perception layer includes
    sensor motes. Information communication technology (lCT) enabled devices, sensor
    motes are building blocks of sensor technology. It includes cameras, RFID tags,
    sensors and sensor network used to recognize objects and collecting real time
    information. The network layer is a infrastructure of the lOT to realize universal
    service. It directs towards the combination of the perception layer and application
    layer. The application layer is a layer that combines the lOT with the technology
    of specific industry. The internet of things almost applied in all areas of industry,
    including smart agriculture, smart parking, smart building environmental monitoring,
    healthcare transportation and many more. Among them, agriculture is one of the
    important areas which targets millions of people. A brief outline of the paper
    is as follows. Section II explains literature survey on smart agriculture domain.
    Section III describes proposed problem statement. Section IV describes smart agriculture
    model. The proposed methodology for smart agriculture model is discussed in section
    V. Finally, the paper is concluded in section VI. SECTION II. Literature Survey
    The research in agriculture area is enhanced in various aspects to improve the
    quality and quantity of productivity of agriculture. Researchers have been worked
    on many different projects on soil attributes, different weather conditions as
    well as scouting crops. Some projects worked on actual farm fields and some worked
    on polyhouses. Researches of Carrnige Mellon University worked on plant nursery
    using Wireless Sensor Technology [2]. Wireless Sensor Network based polyhouse
    monitoring system is explained in [3] which make use of environment temperature,
    humidity, CO2 level and sufficient light detection modules. This polyhouse control
    technology provides automatic adjustment of polyhouse. In [4] authors have proposed
    development of wsn based above mentioned parameters for agriculture using ZigBee
    protocol and GPS technology. In some projects such as [5] authors have designed
    and implemented an approach in development of crops monitoring system in real
    time to increase production of rice plants. This system has used motes with sensors
    to check leaf wetness. Later on use of IoT has been proposed in [6]–[8]. IoT gives
    platform to researches to maintain real time data and send alerts immediately
    to farmers. IoT implementation gives easy access to information that comes from
    sensor nodes. IoT is also used for product supply chain business process. Cloud
    architecture gives additional support to IoT in maintaining Big data of agriculture
    information viz. history information, soil properties, fertilizers distribution,
    image cultivation through camera and information collected through sensors, recording
    information etc. Authors have analyzed collected data for finding correlation
    between environment, work and yield for standard work model construction. Monitoring
    for adverse signs and fault detection. In [9] authors have discussed the application
    of data mining with the help of WEKA tool and analysis model using of machine
    learning algorithms. In [10] authors have concentrated on crop monitoring. Information
    of temperature and rainfall is collected as initial spatial data and analyzed
    to reduce the crop losses and to improve the crop production. They have used optimization
    method to show progressive refinement for spatial association analysis. Although
    authors mentioned above have proposed many models in agriculture domain, the effective
    model is needed that uses new technologies and provides an integrated approach
    to monitor environmental conditions periodically and various soil properties of
    farm field through IoT devices and store these details at the central place in
    the cloud storage which results in Big —data over the time. It is also usable
    by multiple vendors or farmers who enquire about crop yield maximization. Farmer
    can analyze these data for fertilizer requirements for current crop. It will help
    for smart climate solutions and disaster prevention. SECTION III. Proposed Problem
    Statement This paper presents proposed model for smart agriculture to develop
    real time monitoring system for soil properties like temperature, moisture, pH
    and to implement decision support advisory models for Pest & Disease forewarning,
    Crop Disease identification using image analysis and SMS based alerts. It will
    also be possible to control various operations of the field remotely from anywhere,
    anytime by mobile as well as web application. SECTION IV. Proposed Architecture
    Proposed system has three modules — Farm side, Server side and Client side. Farm
    side deployment is as shown in figurel. It consists of six methods as follows.
    Sensing local agricultural parameters. Identification of location of sensor and
    data collection. 3. Transferring data from crop fields for decision making. Decision
    support and early warming based on data analysis, domain knowledge and history
    generated. Actuation and control based on decision. Crop monitoring via camera
    Module. Fig. 1. Proposed saiot model Show All The solar panel supplies power for
    the sensors charging and server system installed outdoors, so that the system
    is applicable in an agricultural environment even if no external power is supplied.
    lOT serves the farm field through sensing local agricultural parameters, reliable
    transfer of data and intelligent decision support and early warning, which corresponds
    to the three layers of lOT, namely, perception layer, network layer and application
    layer. The perception layer mainly consists of Ubi-Sense mote as shown in figure
    2. Ubi-Sense mote (M) is a generic sensor board having Temperature and Relative
    Humidity, Light Intensity, Barometric Pressure, Proximity sensing and Buzzer.
    Ubi-Sense mote is a generic sensor board having Temperature and Relative Humidity,
    Light Intensity, Barometric Pressure, Proximity sensing and Buzzer. Ubi-Sense
    reads values from sensor, detects Proximity IR LED and generates an alarm through
    Buzzer. It transmits the measured physical value from the Ubi-Sense mote over
    the Air. similarly spectral analysis of plant images is possible to know health
    condition of the plants in real time The network layer is responsible for reliable
    transformation to application layer. It consists of Ubi-mote as shown in figure
    3 compliant with IEEE 802.15.4 uses SoC with ARM Cortex M3 having External flash
    memory and supports to router and end device configurations such as Ubi-Sense
    mote and suitable for outdoor deployments. This technique can achieve convenient
    wireless connection and fast access to equipment within a short-distance. ZigBee
    technique uses WINGZ (Wireless IP Network Gateway as shown in figure 4 for Zigbee
    fits small-size and low-cost wireless network between WPAN and IP network. It
    works as Coordinator device for the WPAN networks mounted on single board computer.
    It has its own unified control and monitoring console for various wireless networks.
    In the application layer, the system can obtain and analyze weather information
    from the internet, including weather forecast in the previous days. The database
    stores sensors data, streaming data, geological data and environmental reference
    values for notifying conditions into each table, and creates average statistical
    information by using the collected information. The DVR provides images taken
    from cameras to the web as streaming data and stores them in the database. Once
    data is gathered at the server, comprehensive analysis of such information is
    done. It provides an environment that users can monitor data processed by the
    components through a Web browser anywhere and at any time. For example by analyzing
    soil moisture values, the system is able to keep sufficient quantity of water
    needed by the crop and at the same time avoids too much water which might drown
    the crops and cause waste. Fig. 2. Ubi-sense mote (m) Show All Fig 3. Ubi-mote

    have different crop areas In these crop areas Ubi-Sense motes are installed. Data
    from Ubi-Sense mote will be transferred to Ubi-mote Server side module. Decision
    support system will be implemented for alerts, crop monitoring. Client side module
    consists of web application as well as mobile application on android OS as shown
    in figure 5 and figure 6. Fig. 5. Web application Show All Fig. 6. Android application
    Show All SECTION VI. Conclusion The paper proposes a wise agricultural model in
    integration with ICT. ICT have always mattered in Agriculture domain. Village
    farmers may have planted the “same” crop for centuries, but over period, weather
    patterns and soil conditions and epidemics of pests and diseases changed. By using
    the proposed approach, received updated information allows the farmers to cope
    with and even benefit from these changes. It is really challenging task that needs
    to provide such knowledge because of highly localized nature of agriculture information
    specifically distinct conditions. The complete real-time and historical environment
    information is expected to help to achieve efficient management and utilization
    of resources. ACKNOWLEDGMENT The proposed work in this paper has received a grant

    \ satellites to monitor crops and support their management is gathering increasing\n\
    attention. The improved temporal, spatial, and spectral resolution of the European\
    \ Space Agency\n(ESA) launched Sentinel-2 A + B twin platform is paving the way\
    \ to their popularization in precision\nagriculture. Besides the Sentinel-2 A\
    \ + B constellation technical features the open-access nature of\nthe information\
    \ they generate, and the available support software are a signiﬁcant improvement\n\
    for agricultural monitoring. This paper was motivated by the challenges faced\
    \ by researchers and\nagrarian institutions entering this ﬁeld; it aims to frame\
    \ remote sensing principles and Sentinel-2\napplications in agriculture. Thus,\
    \ we reviewed the features and uses of Sentinel-2 in precision\nagriculture, including\
    \ abiotic and biotic stress detection, and agricultural management. We also\n\
    compared the panoply of satellites currently in use for land remote sensing that\
    \ are relevant for\nagriculture to the Sentinel-2 A + B constellation features.\
    \ Contrasted with previous satellite image\nsystems, the Sentinel-2 A + B twin\
    \ platform has dramatically increased the capabilities for agricultural\nmonitoring\
    \ and crop management worldwide. Regarding crop stress monitoring, Sentinel-2\
    \ capacities\nfor abiotic and biotic stresses detection represent a great step\
    \ forward in many ways though not\nwithout its limitations; therefore, combinations\
    \ of ﬁeld data and diﬀerent remote sensing techniques\nmay still be needed. We\
    \ conclude that Sentinel-2 has a wide range of useful applications in agriculture,\n\
    yet still with room for further improvements. Current and future ways that Sentinel-2\
    \ can be utilized\nare also discussed.\nKeywords: Sentinel-2; remote sensing;\
    \ precision agriculture; crop monitoring\n1. Introduction\nIn current and future\
    \ climate scenarios the resilience and productivity of agricultural systems will\n\
    be increasingly jeopardized [1]. Furthermore, population growth trends, expected\
    \ to reach 8.7 billion\nby 2030 and 9.7 billion by 2050 [2], will further strain\
    \ food production systems worldwide, which so\nfar have not been able to keep\
    \ pace [3]. Within this changing context, crops face a threefold obstacle:\nmanagement-derived\
    \ challenges as well as increased pressure from abiotic and biotic stressors.\n\
    Thus, the application of all available advanced technologies towards managing\
    \ crop variability\nand maintaining or improving yields and reducing negative\
    \ impacts on environmental quality,\nnamely advancements in precision agriculture\
    \ [4], is central to approaching these issues.\nThe possible technological solutions\
    \ for these issues are multifold within precision agriculture’s\nparadigm. On\
    \ the one hand, plant breeding and the use of phenotyping technological advances\
    \ to\nimprove breading programs [5] allow for obtaining genotypes adapted to various\
    \ stressors. However,\nimproved management scales are also a central topic to\

    \ in food production and their role in environmental conservation calls for the\n\
    development of operational global scale methodologies. In this sense, within the\
    \ scope of precision\nagriculture, remote sensing technologies are able to provide\
    \ crucial contributions to agriculture\nmonitoring [6] and improve our understanding\
    \ of the impacts of environmental variations [7]. Many of\nthe limitations in\
    \ the application of remote sensing techniques for precision agriculture of previous\n\
    years [8] have been overcome with the launches of Sentinel-2 A + B. The Sentinel-2\
    \ constellation,\nwith improved spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution was\
    \ designed speciﬁcally to meet the needs\nof the agricultural community, both\
    \ farmers and academic researchers with a focus on international\nagricultural\
    \ development.\nManagement-derived challenges as well as abiotic and biotic stressors\
    \ may all be confronted\nand their negative impacts greatly ameliorated by employing\
    \ remote sensing technologies to better\nguide adaptive agricultural management\
    \ decisions, such as variable rate applications and treatments,\nwhich can be\
    \ assessed and confronted at diﬀerent levels of precision using diﬀerent sources\
    \ of remotely\nsensed data. Remote sensing data has long been made freely available\
    \ to help to deploy precision\nagriculture in crop management to optimize the\
    \ use of scarce resources but requires the necessary\nknow-how for correct implementation.\
    \ The combination of imaging and spectroscopy has allowed,\nfor the last ﬁve decades\
    \ since the launch of the NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration)\n\
    Landsat-1 or Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS) and its Multispectral\
    \ Scanner (MSS) in 1972,\nthe application of satellite-based remote sensing technologies.\
    \ The use of this technology has played\nan important role, yet with some limitations,\
    \ in agriculture monitoring all around the world and will\nincreasingly be needed\
    \ to assess and confront issues related to global climate change. Remote sensing\n\
    provides coverage of large areas with high precision and can be a very eﬃcient\
    \ tool for improved\nmanagement across scales. In this sense, remote sensing using\
    \ multispectral images is a proxy\nfor extensive manual crop monitoring operations\
    \ in the ﬁeld [9] and provides potential savings in\nprecious time and resources.\
    \ Precision agriculture has grown and established itself as a central tool in\n\
    agricultural management to forecast yield, monitor plant stress, and optimize\
    \ fertilization, irrigation,\nand soil tilling activities for a more sustainable\
    \ management of farming practices and improvements in\nyield for farmers.\nThe\
    \ launches of Sentinel-2 A + B twin platforms by the European Space Agency (ESA)\
    \ has\nresulted in an improvement of precision agriculture possibilities. The\
    \ ESA openly and freely provides\nSentinel-2 with an improved number of multispectral\
    \ bands, a more frequent revisit time, and a higher\nspatial resolution that should\
    \ be of great interest to the agricultural community and to international\nagricultural\
    \ development researchers worldwide.\nThis review article focuses on the ﬁeld\
    \ of precision agriculture and monitoring, with a particular\nemphasis on the\
    \ recent advances provided by the ESA Sentinel-2 constellation, as part of the\
    \ European\nUnion (EU) Copernicus Program. Our goal is to frame remote sensing\
    \ principles and Sentinel-2 A + B\nconstellation features in the context of the\
    \ state-of-the-art in precision agriculture. In order to better\nunderstand the\
    \ improved features of Sentinel-2, its characteristics were compared to other\
    \ satellites\nwith potential use for agricultural monitoring. We also present\
    \ an updated review of scientiﬁc literature\non Sentinel-2 applications and advancements\
    \ in precision agriculture. Furthermore, we explore\nits applications in biotic\
    \ and abiotic stress monitoring, as well as at diﬀerent management scales\nfor\
    \ agriculture.\n2. Remote Sensing for Agriculture\n2.1. Plant Spectral Reﬂectance\
    \ Properties\nPlants interact with sunlight—the full spectrum of sun-emitted electromagnetic\
    \ radiation—\ndiﬀerently depending on the wavelength observed. In this sense,\
    \ incident solar radiation can follow\nthree pathways: it can be transmitted,\
    \ reﬂected, or absorbed. The electromagnetic radiation that is\nreﬂected by plants\
    \ contains information about their biophysical composition and physiological status\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 641\n3 of 18\nand can be measured using satellite sensors,\
    \ such as those placed in the ESA Sentinel-2. Focusing on\nthe visible domain,\
    \ the chlorophyll pigments present in green leaves strongly absorbs in the visible\n\
    (VIS) region of the spectrum (400–700 nm), especially in the blue and red wavelengths,\
    \ where energy is\ncaptured for photosynthesis. Meanwhile in the near-infrared\
    \ (NIR), from approximately 700 to 1300 nm,\nleaves exhibit high reﬂectance values\
    \ and transmission, mostly related to leaf structural properties\nand biomass,\
    \ and absorb less radiation in this spectral region [10,11]. Furthermore, plant\
    \ canopy\nstructure and leaf area are also fundamental traits connected to canopy\
    \ reﬂectance patterns [12,13]\nand are key parameters for monitoring growth. Regarding\
    \ the shortwave infrared region (SWIR),\nfrom approximately 1300 to 2500 nm, the\
    \ absorption of radiation is largely dominated by water,\nfollowed by other biochemical\
    \ components present in leaves. Concerning agriculture, in situations\nwhere crops\
    \ interact with any given aspect of their environment (seasonal climatic variations,\n\
    meteorological extreme events, pests, soil properties, etc.) or as crops grow\
    \ and pass through diﬀerent\nphenological stages, the interactions between plants\
    \ and light reﬂectance translate into changes in\nplant signal patterns that can\
    \ be interpreted using satellite data. The use of remote sensing instruments\n\
    to monitor electromagnetic radiation reﬂectance changes in crops is well demonstrated\
    \ in the scientiﬁc\nliterature [13–24]. For example, chlorophyll content plays\
    \ a direct role in photosynthesis and it is\nresponsive to a range of stresses,\
    \ and hence is often used as a general plant health indicator [25] and\ninterpreted\
    \ along with the signals related to biomass and water content. These are examples\
    \ of general\npotential uses of plant spectral reﬂectance properties for vegetation\
    \ monitoring. However, often it is\nthe temporal and spatial properties of satellites\
    \ that determine if their use is appropriate for agriculture.\nThis is a consequence\
    \ of the characteristics of crops, which grow more quickly and frequently in smaller\n\
    and more closely managed parcels of land compared to natural vegetation.\n2.2.\
    \ Satellites and Remote Sensing Scales of Observation\nOver the last 50 years\
    \ of digital evolution, numerous satellites with multispectral sensors have been\n\
    launched to orbit around the Earth for the purpose of environmental and agricultural\
    \ remote sensing.\nCurrently, one of the most relevant Earth observation programs\
    \ focused on detection and assessment of\nvegetation is Copernicus. The Copernicus\
    \ Program, led by the ESA, is a program aimed to increase the\nsatellite-based\
    \ Earth observation capacities and within which Sentinel-2 twin platforms were\
    \ launched.\nBesides the multispectral Sentinel-2 system, various satellites have\
    \ been launched or are planned\nto be launched as part of this still on-going\
    \ program. Regarding potential agricultural applications\nwithin the Copernicus\
    \ program, it is worth mentioning Sentinel-1 (https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/\n\
    missions/sentinel-1) that carries a synthetic-aperture radar on board as well\
    \ as Sentinel-3 that provides\nthermal data at 1 km of spatial resolution (https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-3).\n\
    Framing the concepts regarding satellites features is especially relevant in order\
    \ to grasp Sentinel-2\nimprovements compared to other orbiting satellites. In\
    \ this sense, it is central to understand ﬁrst satellite\nresolution and observation\
    \ scales as they determine satellite systems’ agricultural monitoring capacities.\n\
    Regarding resolution, four parameters are central to approach a better understanding\
    \ of the aims\nand scope of these instruments. First, the spectral resolution,\
    \ namely the number, width, and location\non the electromagnetic spectrum of spectral\
    \ bands in the sensor system. Second, the spatial resolution,\nwhich is the measure\
    \ of the smallest object that can be resolved by the sensor, e.g., pixel size.\n\
    Third, one must consider the temporal resolution which is a measure of the frequency\
    \ with which a\nsensor revisits the same area of the Earth’s surface; and ﬁnally,\
    \ the radiometric resolution, which is\ndetermined by the number of bits into\
    \ which the recorded radiation is divided [26] and determines the\nspectral precision\
    \ of the measurements.\nFollowing Homolová et al. [27], on the matching of ecological,\
    \ agricultural, and remote\nsensing scales, we currently ﬁnd that on the basis\
    \ of individual plants, plant communities,\nand agroecosystems, diﬀerent remote\
    \ sensing technologies may provide coverage across canopy\nand landscape scales.\
    \ Furthermore, it provides coverage across a range of plant physiological processes\n\
    from evapotranspiration and photosynthesis to phenology dynamics, productivity,\
    \ and even quality\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 641\n4 of 18\ntraits such as those of a\
    \ crop’s harvestable component nutritional value. The spatial, temporal,\nand\
    \ spectral resolutions of any sensor-satellite system are central to determining\
    \ the scale at which an\ninstrument can monitor crops, and therefore the most\
    \ adequate approach towards guiding agricultural\nmonitoring and assessments and\
    \ subsequently management actions.\n2.3. Sentinel-2 Spatial and Temporal Resolutions\
    \ Compared to Other Satellites\nSentinel-2 has had two launches, Sentinel-2A that\
    \ was launched on 23 June 2015 and Sentinel-2B\non 7 March 2017, forming, up from\
    \ this date, the Sentinel-2 A + B constellation (https://earth.esa.int/\nweb/guest/missions/esa-operational-eo-missions/sentinel-2).\
    \ Both have a 7.25-year lifetime, including\na 3 months commissioning phase with\
    \ adequate propellant for up to 12 years. Both Sentinel-2A and\nSentinel-2B satellites\
    \ have on board the exact same MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) with bands from\n\
    the visible to the shortwave infrared: four (4) bands at 10 m, the classical broadband\
    \ visible blue\n(490 nm), green (560 nm), red (665 nm), and near infrared (842\
    \ nm); six bands at 20 m, four narrow\nbands in the vegetation red edge spectral\
    \ domain (705, 740, 775, and 865 nm), and two longer SWIR\nbands (1610 and 2190\
    \ nm); and three (3) bands at 60 m dedicated to atmospheric correction (443 nm\
    \ for\naerosols and 940 nm for water vapor) and to cirrus detection (1380 nm)\
    \ (Table 1). After the second\nlaunch the satellite provides higher temporal resolution\
    \ with a 5-day global revisit frequency, and up\nto 2-day revisit in top northern\
    \ and southern parts of the globe.\nSatellite spatial and temporal resolutions\
    \ depend on their type of orbit and their orbit altitude.\nMost of the satellites\
    \ are two types: polar orbiting which are sun synchronous and have orbits that\n\
    cross near the poles in low earth orbit (around 700 km); or are geostationary\
    \ geosynchronous and orbit\nabove the equator, located much farther distance from\
    \ the earth (35,000 km). In this case Sentinel-2 is\nsun synchronous and has a\
    \ systematic coverage of all land surfaces (including croplands) globally from\n\
    −56◦ (Southern America) to +83◦ (Northern Greenland) latitude, with a swath width\
    \ of 290 km [28]\nand an earth orbit of 786 km.\nTable 1. Bands and resolutions\

    Focusing on spatial and temporal resolution, in Figure 1 various satellites are\
    \ shown in comparison\nto the most recently launch satellite of interest to precision\
    \ agriculture—Sentinel-2. For comparison,\nthe MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging\
    \ Spectroradiometer) and Proba-V, with spatial resolutions\nranging from 150 to\
    \ 500 m and both with a daily revisit time can monitor agricultural systems at\
    \ the\nagroecosystem level. Meanwhile, the IRS AWiFS and Landsat 8 satellites\
    \ have a spatial resolution of\n30–100 m and a revisit time of 24 and 16 days,\
    \ respectively. In this case, both agroecosystems and plant\ncommunities at local\
    \ to regional scales, namely the crop ﬁeld level, can be monitored. On the other\n\
    hand, both the SPOT (Satellite Pour l’Observation de la Terre) 6/7 have similarities\
    \ with Sentinel-2\nA + B as both are constellations of two satellites and therefore\
    \ the combined revisit time is reduced,\nwhich translates in providing global\
    \ daily imagery in the case of SPOT and every 5 days in the case\nAgronomy 2020,\

    \ also helps maintain relatively detailed\nspatial resolution, with SPOT spatial\
    \ resolution at 6 m and the Sentinel-2 maximum resolution is\n10 m. Speciﬁcally\
    \ in the case of Sentinel-2 resolution ranges between 10 and 60 m, but the agricultural\n\
    dedicated bands are either 10 or 20 m, depending on the band width, while the\
    \ other bands at 60 m\nare for atmospheric aerosols and water vapor observations\
    \ mainly for improved image calibration.\nDue to their shorter revisit time and\
    \ more detailed spatial resolution (compared, for example, to\nLandSat at every\
    \ 16 days and mostly 30 m pixel size), more precision in sub-ﬁeld monitoring can\n\
    be performed using these paired satellite constellations, hence covering from\
    \ agroecosystem to ﬁeld\nscales more precisely and thus gaining relevance for\
    \ use in agricultural contexts and even more\nspeciﬁcally smallholder farming\

    \ Spectral Resolutions and Useful Vegetation Indices for Sentinel-2 Features \n\
    Besides temporal and spatial resolution, spectral resolution is a central feature\

    \ these satellites with \nSentinel-2, we observe that all include sensors with\
    \ visible, near infrared, and shortwave infrared \nbands; differently, Planet\
    \ has only the three available bands in the visible (RGB, for red, green, and\
    \ \nblue reflected light) and one in the near infrared (NIR). A different feature\
    \ from Sentinel-2 is that it \nalso captures four narrowband spectral regions\
    \ of different wavelengths present in the Red Edge (RE)\nFigure 1. Current constellation\

    \ spectral regions of diﬀerent wavelengths present in the Red Edge (RE) spectral\
    \ region\nthat are provided at 20 m resolution (Figure 2). The reﬂectance spectrum\

    \ spectral regions most useful for agricultural monitoring\nare suggested for\
    \ a more exhaustive coverage of spectral indexes in general [31,32]. Regarding\
    \ the\nchosen VIs relevant to Sentinel-2 imagery presented in Table 2, for the\
    \ visible spectrum the Normalized\nGreen–Red Diﬀerence Index (NGRDI) compares\
    \ the diﬀerences between the green and red visible\nbands for vegetation, together\
    \ with the well-known Normalized Diﬀerence Vegetation Index (NDVI)\nhave shown\
    \ to be able to remotely sense total crop green biomass [33], which is often indicative\
    \ of\ngeneral crop vigor and may be closely correlated with crop nitrogen (N)\
    \ content and may provide\ngood predictions of yield at speciﬁc growth stages.\
    \ Another index that uses the visible bands of\nthe spectrum is the Triangular\
    \ Greenness Index (TGI), which has been shown to estimate correctly\nchlorophyll\
    \ concentration at leaf and canopy level [34].\nIn some cases, a combination of\
    \ two VIs may allow for more speciﬁc measurements, given that\nthe sensor has\
    \ enough spectral bands for both calculations. Many of these more advanced calculations\n\
    were taken into account in the speciﬁc design of Sentinel-2 as part of its development\
    \ speciﬁcally for\nprecision agriculture and environmental/vegetation monitoring\
    \ in general. For example, the ratio\nof the Transformed Chlorophyll in Reﬂectance\
    \ Index and the Optimized Soil-Adjusted Vegetation\nIndex (TCARI/OSAVI) has been\
    \ shown to estimate chlorophyll leaf content [35], basically by providing\na canopy\
    \ chlorophyll measurement (TCARI) and then correcting for biomass (OSAVI). In\
    \ some\ninstances, the spectral indexes were originally developed for a prior\
    \ satellite with similar spectral but\ncoarser spatial resolution that did not\
    \ make them amenable to smaller-scale agricultural applications,\nsuch as in the\
    \ case of the MERIS (Medium-spectral Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) Terrestrial\n\
    Chlorophyll Index (MTCI) [36]. Based on the red-edge bands, many of which are\
    \ newly featured\nat higher spatial resolutions with the Sentinel-2 satellite,\
    \ MTCI has showed that Sentinel-2 derived\nindexes using red-edge bands perform\
    \ very precisely in estimating chlorophyll and N content [36]. It is\nalso the\
    \ case of the chlorophyll index red edge (Cl red edge) [37], eﬀective for estimating\
    \ leaf area index\n(LAI). The Chlorophyll Vegetation Index (CVI), a broad-band\
    \ VI sensitive to leaf chlorophyll content at\ncanopy level, has also shown good\

    2.5. Sentinel-2 Data Access, Secondary Products, and Support Tools\nRegarding\
    \ some of the highest spatial and temporal resolution satellites, such as Planet,\
    \ the access\nto imagery is private or at least restricted, and therefore inaccessible\
    \ for many institutions with limited\nfunding, especially in developing countries.\
    \ Besides that, NASA satellites, namely MODIS and\nLANDSAT-8 for instance, are\
    \ publicly accessible and completely free, as well as ESA’s entire Sentinel\n\
    program, including Sentinel-2, along with the other sun-synchronous orbiting satellites\
    \ that form part\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 641\n8 of 18\nof the greater ESA Copernicus\
    \ Program. This makes the data more readily accessible and more openly\nfree for\
    \ a more globally coordinated remote sensing of agriculture in this case.\nThe\
    \ accessibility to this data is central. In this sense, there are several ways\
    \ to freely and openly\ndownload Sentinel-2 imagery; one of them is the direct\
    \ download of the imagery from ESA’s website,\nthrough Copernicus (https://scihub.copernicus.eu/dhus/#/home).\
    \ Furthermore, third party tools for\ndownloading the imagery are available. For\
    \ instance, there is the United States Geological Survey\n(USGS) (https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/)\
    \ which allows comprehensive searching and downloading\nof full-resolution Sentinel-2\
    \ images. On the open-source software QGIS, there are various plug-ins\nthat take\
    \ advantage of the ESA’s Application Programing Interface (APIs) at the Copernicus\
    \ Open\nAccess Hub (https://scihub.copernicus.eu/apihub/), such as the free and\
    \ open source Semi-Automatic\nClassiﬁcation Plugin (SCP), developed by L. Congedo\
    \ [40], which provides tools to simply download\nSentinel-2 imagery or even download\
    \ and immediately calibrate and apply image analyses to the\ndata. Furthermore,\
    \ the API access portals allow for download only speciﬁc bands of select images,\n\
    thus reducing the storage requirements of personal computers. Moreover, Google\
    \ Earth Engine has\ndaily updated copies of all the available Sentinel-2 data\
    \ and provides both access to this data repository\nalong with high processing\
    \ capacity using their image processing servers. Many other similar tools and\n\
    services exist on other software applications and web portals and are being developed\
    \ continuously.\nAnother relevant point is data itself, its plan for continuity,\
    \ and its access to both raw data and\npre-calibrated and pre-processed satellite\
    \ images that provide value added beneﬁts to end-users.\nSentinel-2 products consist\
    \ of Level-1B, which provides radiometrically corrected granulates in\nTop-Of-Atmosphere\
    \ radiance covering (25 × 23) km2. Sentinel-2 also oﬀers Level-1C imagery which\n\
    consists of tiles of 100 × 100 km2 that provide geo-coded Top-Of-Atmosphere reﬂectance\
    \ with a\nsub-pixel multi-spectral and multi-date registration. It additionally\
    \ includes cloud masks, supplying an\nindication about the presence of cirrus\
    \ clouds. Moreover, it provides Level-2A, a tile of 100 × 100 km2\nwhich provides\
    \ Bottom-Of-Atmosphere reﬂectance in cartographic geometry [41]. Since December\n\
    2018 Level-2A products are generated globally and are ready for users to download.\
    \ Level-2A can be\nalso generated using Level-1C with Sentinel-2 Toolbox.\nESA\
    \ frequently provides speciﬁc access tools, algorithms, and software in support\
    \ of the use and\nprocessing of their satellites, such as the Sentinel-2 Toolbox\
    \ within the Sentinel Application Platform\n(SNAP, https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/toolboxes/sentinel-2).\
    \ On SNAP Sen2Cor is the atmospheric\ncorrection processor to generate Level-2A\
    \ data; it also includes algorithms for cloud and cloud shadow\ndetection, cirrus\
    \ detection, and slope eﬀect correction. Beyond SNAP, Sentinel-2 imagery can also\
    \ be\natmospherically corrected using MAJA (developed by CESBIO/CNES) or i-COR\
    \ (developed by VITO),\namong other options. In addition, the further pre-processing\
    \ chain of Level-2A products can be done\non SNAP: resampling and subsetting followed\
    \ by calculations using the bands. Besides vegetation\nindices, more deterministic\
    \ biophysical parameters, such as LAI or FAPAR, can be calculated on SNAP\nwith\
    \ Sentinel-2 data following the algorithms developed by Weiss and colleagues [42].\
    \ It is relevant to\npoint that as an experimental Sentinel-2 approach done with\
    \ simulated Sentinel-2 imagery in 2015 [43],\neven before its launch, it already\
    \ showed potential for retrieving LAI and with actual Sentinel-2 data it\nis currently\
    \ fully operational.\n3. Sentinel-2 for Precision Agriculture\nThe ESA Sentinel-2\
    \ satellite’s potential applications in agriculture are multi-fold, as described\n\
    above with regard to its speciﬁc spatial, temporal, and spectral capacities. Regarding\
    \ the deﬁnition of the\nInternational Society of Precision Agriculture, precision\
    \ agriculture is a management strategy that uses\ntemporal and spatial information\
    \ to support management decisions according to estimated variability\nfor improved\
    \ resource use eﬃciency and sustainability of agricultural production. This section\
    \ gathers\nexamples of Sentinel-2 capacity to sense variations at several levels\
    \ of agricultural production and the\nsubsequent management decisions that can\
    \ be taken to address any disruption on crop development.\nThe examples discussed\
    \ are summarized in Table 3.\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 641\n9 of 18\nOne very notable\
    \ use of Sentinel-2 features at ﬁeld monitoring is the ESA Sen2-Agri system\n\
    which generates modules of time series along the growing season. These diﬀerent\
    \ products consist\nof a monthly cloud-free composite of surface reﬂectance at\
    \ 10–20 m resolution; monthly dynamic\ncropland masks, delivered from the agricultural\
    \ mid-season onwards; a cultivated crop type map\nat 10 m resolution for main\
    \ crop groups; and time series of vegetation status indicators, NDVI and\nLAI\
    \ [44]. This ﬁeld monitoring tool has been successfully used not only in developed\
    \ countries with\nhomogenous and well delineated ﬁelds, but as well in challenging\
    \ (in terms of farm ﬁelds boundaries)\ncountries such as Mali, successfully diﬀerentiating\
    \ crop types (80% of overall accuracy) [45]. In Europe\nS2-Agri is going to be\
    \ used among other initiatives within the Sen4-CAP (http://esa-sen4cap.org/) to\n\
    advance towards an integrated administration and control system of the Common\
    \ Agriculture Policy\n(CAP), which will be reformulated in 2020. CAP subsidies\
    \ play a central role in European Union\npolicies as they account for around 30%\
    \ of EU total budget [46]. Hence, the European Union is taking\nadvantage of Sentinel-2\
    \ features to monitor croplands aiming to optimize resources by determining\n\
    actual crop type and cropland accurate area. Following the coming 2020 CAP framework,\
    \ several case\nstudies in European regions for cropland classiﬁcation using Sentinel-2,\
    \ such as the one published\nby Campos-Taberner et al. [47] for Valencia (Spain),\
    \ will provide scientiﬁc tools necessary for the\nupcoming policies. The precise\
    \ agricultural monitoring will follow adequate fertilization or irrigation\nguidelines,\
    \ among others.\nThe advantage of Sentinel-2 multi-temporal data for crop-type\
    \ classiﬁcation is very relevant\nas it reaches up to 91–95% overall accuracies\
    \ in various crop classiﬁcations [48] while single-date\nimages show limited results.\
    \ Besides the revisit time, the higher spatial and spectral resolution also\n\
    improves area detection and estimations as shown in small size rice ﬁelds classiﬁcation\
    \ in Taiwan [49].\nAdditionally, in complex landscapes Sentinel-2 imagery was\
    \ able to map sugarcane ﬁelds in China\nwith over 90% of accuracy [50]. Regarding\
    \ classiﬁcation techniques, beside pixel based, object based\nhas showed to be\
    \ an accurate classiﬁcation approach using Sentinel-2 imagery [51]. In this sense,\n\
    object-based dynamic time warping was demonstrated to be more eﬃcient in classifying\
    \ crops than\nthe pixel-based approach when using multitemporal Sentinel-2 imagery\
    \ [52], nonetheless random\nforest seems to be more eﬃcient for crop type classiﬁcation\
    \ when crop spectral variability is high [53].\nIn general terms, the combination\
    \ of Sentinel-2 imagery and various algorithmic approaches, such as\nrandom forest,\
    \ k-nearest neighbor, and support vector machine have also shown optimal classiﬁcation\n\
    accuracy, resulting with over 90% of overall accuracy for the various approaches\
    \ [54]. Understanding\nthe context of the crop, namely crop type spectral features\
    \ and surface extension, is central to accurately\nmaking classiﬁcation method\
    \ decisions when using Sentinel-2 imagery.\nSentinel-2-derived research has approached\
    \ yield predictions in two diﬀerent fashions. On the\none hand empirical models\
    \ using ﬁtting techniques of the obtained data sets (VIs and climatological\n\
    data correlated with actual yields) show robust results with machine learning\
    \ and random forest\ntechniques [55,56] as well as relatively high correlation,\
    \ with an R2 over 0.70, when using simple\nregressions with the most suitable\
    \ VIs (i.e., NDVI) [57,58]. On the other hand, the radiative transfer\nmodels\
    \ approach uses the calculated biophysical parameters such as LAI or FAPAR to\
    \ model crop\ngrowth and predict yields [59–62]. The estimation of yields is a\
    \ central issue in order to ensure food\nsecurity and stabilize market demands.\
    \ These performance models from Sentinel-2 imagery developed\nonce images are\
    \ available are not only aimed to provide ﬁnal grain yield estimations, but they\
    \ can\nalso be used to monitor sudden changes in crop potential yields. This is\
    \ especially central in taking\nagricultural management decisions as information\
    \ is worth a little if it comes too late.\nSoil is the element that facilitates\
    \ the assimilation of both fertilizers and water through the roots,\nnamely the\
    \ two central factors for a proper development of crops. Studies of Sentinel-2\
    \ potential\nfor soil monitoring have been undertaken. Soil organic carbon (SOC)\
    \ can be successfully mapped\nin croplands using Sentinel-2 bands [63–66]. SOC\
    \ prediction models were found to be overall better\nwhen formulated using the\
    \ visible B4, B5, near infrared B8A, and two SWIR bands (B11, B12) [67].\nFurthermore,\
    \ cropland soil degradation with classiﬁcation methods have also been studied\
    \ [68,69].\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 641\n10 of 18\nDetecting agricultural ﬁelds aﬀected\
    \ by soil degradation or poor SOC can drive the intervention of\nfarmers in order\
    \ to prevent the failure of their ﬁelds. Thus, the decision to apply organic matter\
    \ to\nimprove soil structure or to improve ﬁeld edges buﬀers (e.g., revegetating\
    \ or reshaping them) can be\ndriven with these Sentinel-2 data.\nIrrigation and\
    \ water requirements of crops are related to cultivars evapotranspiration (ET),\n\
    where thermal bands are very suitable to estimate this parameter. However, in\
    \ the case of Sentinel-2\nonly optical bands are available. In this sense, diﬀerent\
    \ strategies have been performed in order\nto determinate evapotranspiration and\
    \ propose proper irrigations based on Sentinel-2 information.\nThe combination\
    \ of Senitnel-2 data with models such as FAO-56 Penman–Monteith and Aquacrop\n\
    in the case of tomato have shown to be successful [70,71]. Moreover, the combination\
    \ of FAO-56\nPenman–Monteith with Sentinel-2 derived LAI have also shown relatively\
    \ high accuracy in ET\nretrieval [72]. Several studies also take advantage of\
    \ the red and red-edge bands to predict the crop\ncoeﬃcient (Kc) and thereafter\
    \ use it together with ETo [73,74]. The combination of accurate crop type\nmapping\
    \ and ET models allows establishing regional and ﬁeld-level water requirements\
    \ to drive a\nsustainable use of water resources.\nRegarding precision fertilization\
    \ management, two diﬀerent approaches, both fairly similar to\nthose described\
    \ above for yield, have been developed. On one hand, the use of radiative transfer\
    \ models\nto obtain chlorophyll content [75–77], and on the other hand, using\
    \ empirically correlated vegetation\nindexes and bands to assess the nitrogen\
    \ status of the crop [78–81]. This strategy generally includes the\nthree Sentinel-2\
    \ RE bands (705, 740, and 783 nm, Figure 2), which are very important for the\
    \ retrieval\nof chlorophyll content [82]. The Belgian collaborative agriculture\
    \ platform (http://www.belcam.info/)\nis taking advantage of these Sentinel-2\
    \ features to provide freely nitrogen status information at parcel\nlevel for\
    \ farmers growing potato and winter wheat in Belgium. Information on the nitrogen\
    \ absorbed\nby the crops and nitrogen nutrition index is provided; this information\
    \ allows Belgian farmers to decide\non precise N applications. Furthermore, geolocalized\
    \ fertilizer spreaders can make applications on\nﬁelds following Sentinel-2 sensed\
    \ data in other to balance the applied amount of fertilizer depending\non the\
    \ crops needs per zone.\nRegarding biotic stresses several approaches have been\
    \ studied. Despite the insuﬃcient resolution\nof Sentinel-2, 10 or 20 m, to analyze\
    \ crops at leaf and individual plant scale, diﬀerent strategies have\nbeen developed.\
    \ On the one hand, the use of VIs to monitor eﬀects of pests at canopy level in\
    \ crops\nhave been used in coﬀee [83] and wheat [84], as well as new VIs proposed\
    \ with Sentinel-2 multispectral\nbands that have shown to sense wheat yellow rust\
    \ using bands 4, 5, and 7, the so-called Red Edge\nDisease Stress Index (REDSI)\
    \ [85]. On the other hand, classiﬁcation algorithms using 2, 3, 4, and 8 bands\n\
    have shown to correctly separate cotton rot root aﬀected areas with 94.1% accuracy\
    \ [86]. Furthermore,\nthe combination of UAV and Sentinel-2 for western swamphen\
    \ monitoring in rice crops have shown\na relative high potential (57% of accuracy)\
    \ for detecting infested ﬁelds [87]. The detection of biotic\nstresses can drive\
    \ precise application of pesticides for both regional and ﬁeld-level, furthermore\
    \ the\ncurrent drones’ on-board carrying capacity has increased and there are\
    \ various drone-based spraying\nexperiences for crop protection against biotic\
    \ stresses [88,89]. In this case, the application within the\nﬁeld could be driven\
    \ by Sentinel-2-derived information on the most aﬀected sites by the biotic stresses.\n\
    Concerning abiotic stresses, heavy metal stress in rice ﬁelds produced by cadmium\
    \ (Cd), lead (Pb),\nand mercury (Hg) have shown to be eﬀectively sensed using\
    \ red edge features of Sentinel-2 [90–92].\nIn the case of salinity, Sentinel-2\
    \ bands 2 and 4 showed higher correlation (R2 = 0.67) with the\nelectrical conductivity\
    \ of ﬁelds than Landsat-8 bands [93]. Drought monitoring at 20 cm soil-depth,\n\
    using combined soil moisture models, and Sentinel-2-derived NDVI has shown to\
    \ correlate strongly,\nwith determination coeﬃcients (R2) ranging between 65%\
    \ and 83% [94,95]. Detecting areas aﬀected by\nabiotic stresses can guide determination\
    \ of suitable zones for agriculture or, on the other hand, in need\nfor phytoremediation\
    \ activities or the implementation of halophyte cultivars.\nAgronomy 2020, 10,\

    The Sentinel-2 spatial resolution and number and positioning of spectral reﬂectance\
    \ bands excel at\ncropland and crop type classiﬁcation, as well as monitoring\
    \ of crops phenology, namely by enabling the\nmeasurement of growth (biomass)\
    \ and health (stress symptoms) separately. Furthermore, as reviewed,\nred-edge\
    \ bands are also eﬀective for monitoring nitrogen status, and therefore optimizing\
    \ fertilization\npractices. The literature-proven VIs using the red-edge bands\
    \ have proven robust indicators of plant N\nstatus that can be useful for agricultural\
    \ monitoring. Due to Sentinel-2 red-edge bands characteristics,\nthe biophysical\
    \ parameters estimation obtained with these multispectral indexes have higher\
    \ accuracy\nthan other satellites [96]. Hence, the revisit time of 5 days, the\
    \ red-edge band, and the higher resolution\nsets an improved management perspective.\n\
    The combination of available sensors also remains an excellent opportunity for\
    \ improvement.\nFor instance, Sentinel-2 has limitations towards estimating evapotranspiration\
    \ and water stress due\nto its lack of any thermal bands, and as such data fusion\
    \ with other complimentary sensors may\ngenerate opportunities to coordinate data\
    \ with available thermal bands such as NASA’s MODIS or\nLandsat-8 [97]. However,\
    \ the spatial resolution of their thermal bands (1 km and 100 m, respectively)\n\
    might be a downside for some agricultural applications that require more detail.\
    \ Other possible\napproaches are the combination of optical imagery of Sentinel-2\
    \ and thermal bands from the sensors\non board Sentinel-3 to obtain crop evapotranspiration,\
    \ which is promising for bridging the gap and\nmonitoring evapotranspiration with\
    \ a higher resolution [98]. Besides that, the combination of Sentinel-2\noptical\
    \ bands and Sentinel-1 C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar has successfully been used\
    \ for mapping\nsoil moisture and irrigation demands [99].\nAnother challenge is\
    \ pest monitoring, where pest early warning systems are useful to predict\noutbreaks\
    \ and are generally based on weather information, and intensive and time-consuming\
    \ ﬁeld\nwork. Being able to use Sentinel-2, or other remote sensing instruments,\
    \ to assess pest distribution\nwould be of great importance, considering the current\
    \ globalization of invasive pests and their sudden\neﬀects. Nonetheless, a bottleneck\
    \ is found here, on the one hand the pixel resolution makes it very\ndiﬃcult to\
    \ monitor pests and generally only when damage is signiﬁcant it can be sensed.\
    \ On the other\nhand, it is a challenge to diﬀerentiate the reﬂectance patterns\
    \ of plants due to biotic stresses and see\nwhat the exact cause of the stress\
    \ is. The combination of ground, drone, and satellite sensors might be\na way\
    \ to go, with some regional and technical limitations that need to be overcome.\n\
    Soils are generally not considered at the expense of other parameters. However,\
    \ the importance\nof SOC, which is gaining interest within the sustainable agriculture\
    \ paradigm, can be monitored with\nSentinel-2. This can help to overcome this\
    \ fact and move forward into precision agriculture and soil\nsustainability. Regarding\
    \ soils, monitoring cropland pollution due to heavy metals is important to\nensure\
    \ food safety. It is relevant to see that three papers reviewed in this issue\
    \ had rice and China as\nthe case study [90–92] where serious pollution problems\
    \ in this sense happen [100].\nSen2-Agri has set the structure for a coordinated\
    \ ﬁeld monitoring platform which will likely\nlead to a multi-country precision\
    \ agriculture initiative. In developing countries, on the other hand,\nthis platform,\
    \ and similar ones using Sentinel-2 data, can contribute to food safety and help\
    \ farmers in\nmanaging their crops. Due to the small ﬁelds, intercropping practices\
    \ and terrain-derived issues crop\nmonitoring strategies need to be tuned in order\
    \ to successfully manage these areas.\n5. Conclusions\nSeveral previous review\
    \ papers exist on the use of remote sensing for agriculture [101–103],\nhowever,\
    \ to our knowledge there has not yet been a speciﬁc review article on Sentinel-2\
    \ features\nfor agriculture. We are convinced that may prove beneﬁcial to researchers\
    \ and agrarian institutions\nentering this ﬁeld to understand the features and\
    \ applications of Sentinel-2 in crops monitoring alone\nand as compared to other\
    \ previous and current satellites. The comparison of the Sentinel-2 A + B\nconstellation\
    \ with other orbiting satellites with similar features highlights its improved\
    \ capacities\nwithin precision agriculture.\nIn this sense, we detail several\
    \ applications on the detection and\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 641\n13 of 18\nmanagement\
    \ of biotic and abiotic stresses, crop water requirements, crop type classiﬁcations,\
    \ and the\nestimation of crop yields and nitrogen status. Furthermore, besides\
    \ the promising technical features of\nSentinel-2, it is worth mentioning the\
    \ public availability of its imagery. By making this data accessible\nto all interested\
    \ institutions, the potential beneﬁts of precision agriculture are greater and\
    \ may better\nprovide the mechanisms for advising farmers towards a more productive\
    \ and sustainable management,\nthus, contribute to economic and ecological sustainability\

    Abstract Digitalization provides access to an integrated network of unexploited
    big data with potential benefits for society and the environment. The development
    of smart systems connected to the internet of things can generate unique opportunities
    to strategically address challenges associated with the United Nations Sustainable
    Development Goals (SDGs) to ensure an equitable, environmentally sustainable,
    and healthy society. This perspective describes the opportunities that digitalization
    can provide towards building the sustainable society of the future. Smart technologies
    are envisioned as game-changing tools, whereby their integration will benefit
    the three essential elements of the food-water-energy nexus: (i) sustainable food
    production; (ii) access to clean and safe potable water; and (iii) green energy
    generation and usage. It then discusses the benefits of digitalization to catalyze
    the transition towards sustainable manufacturing practices and enhance citizens''
    health wellbeing by providing digital access to care, particularly for the underserved
    communities. Finally, the perspective englobes digitalization benefits by providing
    a holistic view on how it can contribute to address the serious challenges of
    endangered planet biodiversity and climate change. Graphical abstract Download

    1. Introduction The world is transitioning through the digitalization era in which
    most of our daily activities are highly dependent on innovative digital and computer
    technologies. These contemporary technologies have got their applications in socio-economic,
    environmental, sustainable, and climate research applications to enhance the productivity
    and efficiency of a given system (Balogun et al., 2020; Ceipek et al., 2020).
    Digitalization is the integration of digital technologies into everyday life.
    Such integration is possible by the digitization of information. Digitization
    is defined as the process of converting physically collected information (e.g.,
    sensors, written information, etc.) and knowledge into a computer-readable language.
    The tedious effort of digitizing information gathered over centuries (including
    paintings, images, and video formats) has given valuable fruits propelled by information
    technologies. The benefits resulting from digitalization contributed to the development
    of tools and sensors throughout integrated into the internet of things (IoT) environment.
    The IoT is a robust network of physical objects connected over internet through
    embedded sensors, software, and other technologies that enable interchange and
    collection of data. The convergence of simultaneously developed technologies for
    real-time analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence manages a massive
    amount of data, also known as big data. The high value of these massive data sets
    generated is not yet fully exploited but generates unique opportunities to catalyze
    the transition to more efficient and sustainable smart integrated cities. Digitalization
    brings a new set of tools that have to be carefully balanced to ensure smart application
    and their green character. The capability of making well-informed decisions to
    use more efficiently resources and services has a significant impact on sustainability
    and equal access (Appio et al., 2021; Ardito et al., 2018), but several challenges
    cannot be overlooked to ensure successful achievement of these goals. Development
    and manufacturing of electronic devices are depleting limited resources and generating
    e-waste (unwanted electronic products, not working, and nearing or at the end
    of their “useful life”) that is being hardly recycled (Ahirwar and Tripathi, 2021;
    Dhir et al., 2021). Considering life-cycle and developing e-waste recycling technologies
    is an urgent need. The necessity of better infrastructure is another challenge
    that may widen the gap between developed and developing regions instead of narrowing
    it. There is a need to ensure infrastructure and equal internet access to achieve
    the holistic goal of reducing inequalities and poverty, aligning with the need
    to provide digital education to the final users (Habibi and Zabardast, 2020; Lopez-Sintas
    et al., 2020; Matthess and Kunkel, 2020). Finally, data security is one of the
    major concerns on big-data sources'' wide accessibility and openness. Data security
    is a sensitive topic that generates debate associated to safety risks and network
    integrity of these digitalized services (Craig, 2018; Reveron and Savage, 2020).
    These challenges have to be considered but should not have to be seen as barriers
    to digitalization''s applicability to face sustainable challenges from an applied
    perspective. The United Nations (UN) defined in 2015 a roadmap towards equity
    and sustainable development with a horizon set in 2030 (United Nations, 2018).
    These so-called Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) identify 17 existing challenges
    that should be overcome to reach this ambitious global goal: (1) No poverty, (2)
    Zero hunger, (3) Good health and wellbeing, (4) Quality education, (5) Gender
    equality, (6) Clean water and sanitation, (7) Affordable and clean energy, (8)
    Decent work and economic growth, (9) Industry, innovation and infrastructure,
    (10) Reduced inequalities, (11) Sustainable cities and communities, (12) Responsible
    consumption and production, (13) Climate action, (14) Life below water, (15) Life
    on land, (16) Peace, justice and strong institutions, and (17) Partnership for
    the goals. These interlinked SDGs present the urgent needs of our civilization
    to ensure a sustainable and competitive future. The creative development of digital
    tools to generate, use, transmit, or source electronic data for organizational
    activities can be used to achieve SDGs. These tools that contribute to achieving
    these specific targets could be defined as digital sustainability. Digital Sustainability
    is understood as the effort of developing and deploying smart technologies to
    secure sustainable economic growth while considering and integrating the SDGs.
    Modern digital innovations like artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques
    have seen exponential growth in their value, estimated to add around 14% to the
    global economy by 2030 (George et al., 2020; Magistretti et al., 2019). In this
    perspective, we explore how digitalization can pave the way towards sustainable
    development, which is essential to create a Smart Green Planet that provides resources
    while protecting the environment and health of all the planet''s inhabitants.

    protection. It is also considered the holistic, sustainable impacts resulting
    from the correlated benefits of all these actions. In this article, we explore
    how digitalization can assist in attaining SDGs in different sectors such as (i)
    food-water-energy nexus, (ii) industry, (iii) citizens'' health and wellbeing,
    (iv) climate change and biodiversity protection. Fig. 2 summarizes the different
    sections of this perspective with emphasis on the specific aspects addressed for
    the different SDGs. Each big topic is framed to answer a holistic question regarding
    how digitalization can lead the change towards a more sustainable and balanced
    society for each challenge. We will specifically discuss digitalization tools
    implemented in specific areas with the direct aim to benefit said sector and to
    tackle said SDGs. Even though it is important to remark the tight correlations
    and interlinks between the different areas that become hard to differentiate.
    For example, effects resulting from the food-water-energy nexus directly impact
    the wellbeing of citizens of smart cities. Therefore, it is assessed and discussed
    how digitalization aids in sustaining the main pillars of our civilization in
    the food-water-energy nexus, the benefits of industrial manufacturing, and the
    relevance for human health and wellbeing. The perspective ends with a discussion
    centered on the benefits of digitalization to protect biodiversity and mitigate
    climate change. Download : Download high-res image (382KB) Download : Download

    sustainable development goal addressed in this perspective. 2. Will digital technologies
    redefine the future of agriculture and food production systems? The ever-growing
    global demand for food, feed, fiber, and clean energy increases pressure on the
    agroecosystems. Increased stress adversely affects agroecosystems'' natural resilience,
    and it is expected to result in unprecedented environmental changes on a global
    scale (Okolo et al., 2019). Changing climatic conditions are accompanied by high
    and low heat stress, altered rainfall pattern, elevated carbon dioxide, increased
    frequency of extreme weather events like droughts, floods, cyclonic disturbances,
    and increased saline soils. These effects result in inflation of production costs,
    pest infestation and disease incidences which collectively add pressure on global
    agricultural land (Abhilash and Dubey, 2014; Lobell et al., 2012). Owing to the
    rising demand for food, the stressed supply chains, and diminishing soil carbon
    levels are depicting a daunting task for future generations to meet the nutritional
    requirements of 9.7 billion people by 2050. The advent of digital technologies
    within agriculture is a ray of hope on the horizon. Digital technologies are up-scaling
    the sustainable management of agricultural land and resources as well as strengthening
    the associated productivity, services, and livelihood security worldwide as summarized
    in Table 1. Crop variety, plot, and field-specific sustainable agricultural practices
    are being developed (Dubey et al., 2019; Okolo et al., 2019) and data generated
    from promising practices should be maintained and analyzed through digital technologies.
    Digitalization has made rapid strides within the agricultural sector, making its
    presence felt in varying dimensions such as land assessment, soil-crop suitability,
    weather information, crop-growth, biomass and productivity, precision farming,
    along with the various stages of the agriculture supply chain (processing, packaging,
    delivery, consumption, and agro-waste management). Digitalization adds multipurpose
    benefits to global agriculture via real-time monitoring, common fingertip-based
    smartphones and computers, and satellite and weather information-based consultation.
    These IoT technologies can alert and allow planning to deal with upcoming challenges
    such as pest infestation and/or disease outbreaks. Digital technologies also help
    select high yield-oriented optimum practices, precise resource inputs, less production
    cost with the better nutritional quality of agricultural produces, geo-tagging
    for precise prophecy, vigorous and elastic farming methods, crop data management,
    post-harvest services, and agro-based industries. Various technologies like remote
    sensing, Geographic Information System (GIS), smart-phone, robotics, artificial
    intelligence, genomics, bioinformatics and big data-based digital technologies
    are being utilized for attaining the target of agricultural sustainability (Basso
    and Antle, 2020) and the targets of United Nations SDGs (United Nations, 2018)
    (Fig. 3). Under digitalization, application of various hardware (sensors, ground
    robot, drones, nursery automation, robotics, robotics-based irrigation, precise
    fertilization at the base between densely grown crops, automated tractors for
    crop harvesting), software (geo-mapping, computer imaging technology), and their
    combination (micro-spraying robots for targeted herbicide application, automated
    weed uprooting and pruning robotics with computer imaging) are already being employed.
    Details and implications of the internet of agricultural things-based technologies
    are described in the following subsections that define promising opportunities
    enabled by digitalization. Table 1. Application of digital technologies in providing

    and their efficacies for improving the global agricultural sustainability, healthy

    Development Goals (UN-SDGs). 2.1. Remote sensing and GIS-based technologies for
    sustainable management of agricultural land Remote sensing (RS) and GIS techniques
    offer various solutions starting from crop species identification, farm and landscape-level
    sustainable management of farming systems, to policy formulation (Basso and Antle,
    2020). Thus, increasing agri-productions, resource conservation, above-belowground
    biodiversity, gender equality, and farmers'' empowerment opportunities could be
    achieved by integrating these modern digital tools. Integration of RS-GIS, Fuzzy-logic,
    and multicriteria assessment using the Analytical Hierarchy Process generate a
    superior database and a guide map for effective land-use patterns, crop variety,
    planning, monitoring of agroecosystem activities, and decision making with several
    examples summarized in Table 1. These integration techniques have quick and efficient
    access to a large amount of information, revealing relationships, patterns, and
    useful trends for combining soil survey information for better land-use suitability
    assessment (Singha and Swain, 2016). Research has demonstrated the benefits of
    implementing these techniques as a viable alternative for highly productive and
    stable agricultural systems over time. Smart integration of GIS-based technology
    promises better farming systems to production areas with enhanced resilience while
    mitigating climate change. For instance, GIS-remote sensing tools have been utilized
    in citrus orchards in China where digital mapping and modeling-based knowledge
    of area topography, land-use, soil types, climatic conditions, and altitude predicted
    the suitable area for citrus cropping and their sustainable management from field
    to end-users (Wu et al., 2011). The RS data helps decipher the spatiotemporal
    characteristics of the land exceptionally, including the impact of the environment
    on the growth of crops. According to Al-Gaadi et al., the GIS-RS technology and
    models (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Spectral Reflectance, Fraction
    of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation, LandSAT Enhanced Thematic Mapper,
    Environmental Policy Integrated Climate models, Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging
    Spectroradiometer) have been explored for improving the sustainability of potato
    production (Al-Gaadi et al., 2016). The use of advanced multispectral images in
    RS was highlighted as an effective monitoring tool for determining vegetation
    dynamics, plant health, and predicting crop yield under different practices (Al-Gaadi
    et al., 2016). Hence, decisions related to quantitative export and import of the
    product within the region could be made assuredly to strengthen the net economic
    benefits to the farming community. Through GIS-RS-based technologies, farm operators
    are provided with precision maps, information on crops, estimation of fields,
    and soil characteristics, which are beneficial for producers of the government,
    as they can provide the necessary projects to support the farmers. Besides, these
    systems provide better information on climatic parameters for the development
    of heat and drought-resilient crop varieties via different breeding approaches
    (Faloon et al., 2015). Also, GIS-RS equipped with Revised Universal Soil Loss
    Equation models helped explain the susceptibility to severe soil erosion in Syria
    with a soil loss of more than 109 tons ha−1 yr−1 by generating a map for soil
    degradation (Abdo and Salloum, 2017). Around 104–627 kg ha−1 plastic materials
    including synthetic polymers, are being used in agriculture in varied processes
    like mulching, hail protection, crop protection, shading nets and in irrigation
    support. Sustainable management of land and crops along-with soil biodiversity
    sustenance requires the regular removal of these polymers. Here again, readily
    updatable GIS-based databases and maps have been used to identify the extent of
    plastic in farms, delineate the place for plastic collection and develop a monitoring
    and decision-making system for the identification and collection followed by their
    proper delivery to the recycling companies (Blanco et al., 2018). The involvement
    of geoinformatics and decision support systems in precision irrigation plays a
    significant role in sustainable water management and is crucial for those countries
    where water is a scarce or highly limited resource and in arid and semi-arid areas.
    However, this technique requires combining large sets of precise and highly accurate
    data about land characteristics and water resources. Factors such as the high
    cost of maintenance and calibration of the sensors make its implementation tiresome,
    especially in developing countries. Although these technologies are still a challenge
    for many countries, the availability of open-source geospatial platforms like
    QGIS and R open up new possibilities for their application in low-income systems.
    Active stakeholder engagement is further required to highlight the accessibility
    and feasibility of such GIS software to the rest of the farming community and
    supply chain members. The world is in an era where online information is becoming
    more prosperous, with multiple applications for phones, computers, and other devices
    being launched. Scientific interventions can further boost the integration of
    emerging digital technologies within agricultural practices, offering several
    opportunities to significantly improve the social, economic and environmental
    sustainability of food production systems. 2.2. APP based agricultural services
    and climate-smart agriculture Globally, agricultural transformation is proceeding
    rapidly, with Information Communications Technology (ICT) and digitization being
    the central players behind this novel transformation. The use of mobile application
    software by almost all agricultural stakeholders enhances resource use efficiency
    and equally helps reduce costs associated with production while simultaneously
    increasing yields and net economic return (Qiang et al., 2011) with several examples
    collected in Table 1. The use of mobile-based apps by farming, scientific and
    technical professionals is enabling information access related to climate-smart
    agricultural (CSA) practices. The integration of digitalized access is assists
    in decision-making during production and subsequent stages of the supply chain.
    According to Global System for Mobile Communications Association real-time intelligence
    data, more than 5.2 billion people (~68% of the world''s population) have access
    to mobile devices worldwide. Globally, the current cellular phone users surpass
    3 billion, projected to grow by several hundred million in the next few years.
    The effectiveness of mobile phones/Apps and their implication in disseminating
    agricultural information to farmers have been validated (Mittal and Mehar, 2016).
    However, the use of ICT in agriculture does not always lead to higher yields and
    profits for every farmer (Eitzinger et al., 2019). Thus, despite the positive
    results of mobile applications in improving smallholder agriculture (Tata and
    McNamara, 2018), many farmers are still left in the “dark” owing to lack of technology
    access, especially in rural communities of developing countries (Eitzinger et
    al., 2019). Notably, vital impediments that hinder digitalization in agriculture
    (i.e., use of mobile phone/Apps and ICT), especially among smallholder farmers
    in a rural context, include lack of connectivity, missing digital capability,
    poor usability of ICT applications, and digital illiteracy (Eitzinger et al.,
    2019; Mittal and Mehar, 2016). Failure to address these shortcomings will eventually
    lead to farmers facing a new era of digital poverty. More importantly, recognition
    of the local context of connectivity, user''s capacities, synchronization with
    local dialects, and socio-cultural backgrounds should be focused upon as the new
    ICT cutting-edge initiatives with the potential to avoid the impending digital
    poverty among smallholder farmers (Aker et al., 2016; Eitzinger et al., 2019).
    Rising agricultural production, food security, and livelihood of millions of people
    across the globe are being threatened by climate change. Agriculture is a significant
    contributor to greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions and global warming (Gebresamuel
    et al., 2021). Digital technologies-based climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices
    that integrated the benefits of sustainable production, climate resilience, and
    reduced GHGs emissions appear to be very promising and offer a potential solution
    to existing problems (Abegunde et al., 2020). However, despite the various benefits
    of CSA technologies, farmers'' current adoption rate is relatively low. Factors
    such as the socio-economic characteristics of farmers, the biophysical environment
    of a particular location, and the attributes of new technologies influence the
    adoption of CSA technologies (Bu and Wang, 2019; Deressa et al., 2011). Food systems
    must undergo significant digital transformation to meet the ever-growing challenges
    of food security and climate change. From a sustainability perspective, adoption
    of APP-based agricultural services with location-specific CSA practices could
    be the major driver of cleaner and greener agriculture, which is also an agenda
    for global sustainable development. 2.3. Precision agriculture, robotics, and
    artificial intelligence Precision agriculture is a farming practice undertaken
    at an accurate place under specific timing rather than uniform adoption across
    the field. Lesser ecological risks, higher crop yield (reduced global hunger),
    and economic gains (reduced poverty) to the farming communities are the fundamental
    attributes of precision agriculture. Precision agriculture employs robotics, artificial
    intelligence, and deep learning processes for the next generation and is climate-smart
    sustainable agriculture practice. Modern unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones
    enabled for providing hyper-class remote-sensing spatiotemporal and spectral records
    can solve the multifarious problems associated with agroecosystems, farming community
    and strengthen the path of precision agriculture. The UAVs contain various sensors
    for predicting the real-time information on drought, soil nutrient, plant growth,
    yield, disease, pesticide and weed, pest, weather parameters, soil type, moisture
    content, and spray pesticide and fertilizer (Maes and Steppe, 2019; Vasconez et
    al., 2019). Thermal imagery, combined thermal with hyper-spectral data, entity-based
    imaging, and UAVs models could be the better technologies for revealing the drought
    stress, pathogen, weed, nutrient status, and yield. Artificial intelligence has
    also proven to improve the impact of precision agriculture. For instance, integration
    of advanced artificial intelligence models, deep reinforcement learning, information,
    and cloud technology has the potential to conserve critical agricultural resources
    while enhancing food production and sustainability (Bu and Wang, 2019). The national
    governing bodies also adopt the advents of these integrated technologies for the
    betterment of advisory and data availability to the farming community (http://agricoop.nic.in).
    In another research, artificial intelligence developed several expert systems
    for the cotton plant such as COMAX (Cotton Management eXpert) and COTFLEX that
    provide decision-making information to farmers. Similarly, SOYGRO and PRITHVI
    expert system provides information regarding insect attacks and pesticides used
    for the soybean crop (Jha et al., 2019). Artificial intelligence enabled machine
    learning technologies and the internet of agricultural things. Wireless communications
    are increasing the farm knowledge system and decision making for better management
    of agriculture. Additionally, precision agriculture is growing faster because
    of rapid research and development of cheaper sensors, better control, and computer
    imaging systems with evolving artificial intelligence. Consequently, a myriad
    of semi and autonomous, unmanned ground vehicles or ground robotics are being
    successfully applied in seedbed grounding, irrigation, spraying, pruning, harvesting,
    real-time monitoring, and mapping for saving resources, finances, and the environment
    (Vasconez et al., 2019). In precision agriculture, data expressed in the form
    of different names such as Digital Farming, Agriculture 5.0 and Smart Farming
    enhances the accuracy of farm operation and helps in making critical operational
    decisions. For example, remote sensing technologies such as American Landsat satellites,
    European Sentinel 2 satellite system, Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellites,
    RapidEye constellation, GeoEye-1 system, WorldView series, and IKONOS provide
    agricultural information that helps in sustainable planning and management of
    agriculture. Some other examples of robotic technology such as Vinbot, VineRobot,
    VineScout, and GRAPE have crop sensing devices and afford multi-season ground-truth
    justification of vineyards. Furthermore, Naïo Technologies and RowBot Systems
    LLC are interesting robotics platforms. The first is associated with mechanical
    weeding, and the latter is used for selective application of fertilizer, mapping
    crop growth, and other field related tasks. The field-level geographic Information
    System (FIS) provides satisfactory information for implementation, operational
    planning, and documentation for the management of farming systems (Saiz-Rubio
    and Rovira-Más, 2020). 2.4. Role of genomics, bioinformatics, and big data in
    sustainable food productions Previously, genomics, bioinformatics, and big data
    were inclined to explore the elementary processes of the life and biological sciences.
    However, nowadays, digital technologies-based omics and data science are performing
    far better in agri-sciences for improving the crop yield, nutritional quality,
    stress tolerance, and combating the negative impact of climate change. Global
    projections demonstrate that a one-degree upsurge in global average temperature
    could reduce the crop-yield of maize, wheat, rice, and soybean by 7.4, 6, 3.2,
    and 3.1%, respectively (Zhao et al., 2017). Therefore, extensive knowledge of
    crop genomics is essential to develop climate-smart, resource-efficient and high-yielding
    crop varieties. Furthermore, multiple draft genomes are being assembled for various
    cereals (Oryza sativa, Setaria italic, Sorghum bicolor, Triticum aestivum, Zea
    mays), legumes (Cicer arietinum, Cajanus cajan, Glycine max, Phaseolus vulgaris,
    Vigna radiata), oilseeds (Brassica napus, Camelina sativa, Elaeis guineensis,
    Ricinus communis), vegetables (Brassica oleracea, Brassica rapa, Carica papaya,
    Capsicum annum, Cucumis sativus, Solanum lycopersicum, Solanum melongena, Solanum
    tuberosum) and fruits (Citrullus lanatus, Citrus clementina, Citrus sinensis,
    Cucumis melo, Fragaria vesca, Musa acuminate, Phoenix dactylifera, Prunus mume,
    Pyrus bretschneideri, Vitis vinifera) (Thottathil et al., 2016) as well as for
    their wild crop relatives (Chang et al., 2019) and based on their identified genomic
    traits various crop varieties can be developed with desired traits. Vast volumes
    of data gathered from the genomics mentioned above, proteomics, and metabolomics
    are managed through various bioinformatics-based tools and databases that ultimately
    store all information through computing and cloud technology. Bioinformatics tools
    are computer-based information technology that decodes the enormous digital data
    in agricultural sciences. Examples of dedicated databases for improving the crop
    traits are Integrated Breeding (https://www.integratedbreeding.net/), Wheat Barely
    and Oat Germplasm (https://triticeaetoolbox.org), Wheat Information System (http://wheatis.org/),
    Wheat Genome Information (http://www.wheatgenome.info), Rice-Informatics (http://iric.irri.org/),
    Rice Genome Data (http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/), Oryzabase (http://www.shigen.nig.ac.jp/rice/oryzabase/),
    Rice Genome Annotation Project (http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/), Oil-seed Proteomics
    (http://www.oilseedproteomics.missouri.edu/), Maize Genome Database (http://www.maizegdb.org/),
    and the International Crop Information System (ICIS) (http://www.icis.cgiar.org),
    among others. As evident application of genomics, bioinformatics, and big data
    play a crucial role in improving the crop agronomic traits such as abiotic stress
    tolerance, insect resistance, herbicide tolerance, higher grain yield, plant height,
    and weight and crop nutrient content of the crops, which in turn helps in maintaining
    the food and nutritional security (Batley and Edwards, 2016). Varshney et al.
    (2020) have proposed 5Gs crop breeding approaches consisting of a crop-specific
    gene assembly followed by genome and agronomic trait-based characterization of
    germplasm, gene identification combined with functional annotation, genomic breeding,
    and gene editing for improving climate-resilient high yielding, nutrient-rich
    crop varieties. Moreover, in precision genome editing technology, CRISPR-Cas9
    helps develop the disease, drought, and herbicide tolerant crops with better plant
    defense against the virus, bioactive compound production, crop yield, and nutritional
    quality. In integration, CRISPR-Cas9 with multiple targeting sgRNAs serves as
    an appropriate genome editing tool that increases nutrient content in wheat, maize,
    rice, tomato, and sweet orange. The aforesaid mentioned integrated technology
    had been proven to combat the bean yellow dwarf virus (BeYDV), tomato yellow leaf
    curl virus (TYLCV), and Beet Severe Curly Top geminivirus (BSCTV) infection by
    editing the viral genome. Using CRISPR-Cas9 can cause a mutation in TaMLO-A1 and
    TaMLO-B1 gene of wheat, OsERF922 gene of rice and SIDMR6–1 gene of tomato, increasing
    the resistance against the powdery mildew, rice blast and Xanthomonas spp. in
    wheat, rice, and tomato, respectively. Similarly, CRISPER based genome editing
    tool has modified the ARGOS8 gene locus in maize for enhancing the grain yield
    even under drought stress. Moreover, the mutation in acetolactate synthase genes
    ALS1 and ALS2 have increased the resistance against chlorsulfuron herbicides in
    maize (Eş et al., 2019). These examples highlight the application of information,
    computing, and cloud-based digital technologies in digging and improving the crop
    genomic traits for agricultural sustainability. Besides, various computational
    algorithm-based agricultural system modeling approaches are also being utilized
    extensively for sustainable land management. These models provide a robust prediction
    approach for crop yield, soil nutrient cycling, resource use efficiency, GHGs
    emission, ecosystem services, pest and disease mediated damage, food security,
    livestock production, agroecosystems responses to global climate change and policy
    assessment (Holzworth et al., 2015; Jones et al., 2017) across the various global
    agroecological zones and socioeconomic conditions. Further decision-making systems
    use the knowledge of such models and other computer-based algorithms for enhancing
    the sustainability of agro-practices at plot, field, agroecosystems, landscape,
    national, and global scale. In addition to genomics and bioinformatics, information,
    and communication technology uses various massive, heterogeneous, and unstructured
    data (also known as big data) through the internet and cloud computing. These
    provide insight into the decision-making aspects of the smart farming system.
    Computational scripts allow us to analyze such big data in an integrated manner
    to optimize agricultural productivity and food supply chains. There are multiple
    robotics systems with heterogeneous nature of data in a single smart farming practice.
    These data now became accessible to the users through Application Programming
    Interfaces (APIs) technology. Similarly, technology and data start-ups-based different
    datasets can be combined through open standards (e.g., ISOBUS). Farmobile, a recently
    introduced hardware (passive-uplink communicator) can record all data from robotics;
    store it in the database, and transmit the data using a wireless system. Another
    example of big data analysis can be achieved through Open Ag Toolkit (OpenATK)
    that provides farm management information via cheaper, readily accessible, user-friendly
    mobiles and stores data on the cloud. Likewise, in Europe, the FIWARE GEs application
    helps in big data analysis utilizing cloud technology, data collection, and secured
    information technology that opens up multiple options to identify socio-economic
    challenges and provide real-time operational decisions, thereby reducing the economic
    risks involved in the sustainable farming system (Wolfert et al., 2017). However,
    although all previously mentioned digital technologies are rapidly gaining influx
    and witnessing an upsurge in usage within developed nations, they are yet to gain
    ground within developing countries and could prove crucial in achieving the agriculture
    related targets of the various SDGs (no poverty; SDG1, zero hunger; SDG2, good
    health and wellbeing; SDG3, clean water and sanitation; SDG6, industry innovation
    and infrastructure; SDG9, sustainable cities and communities; SDG11 responsible
    consumption and productions; SDG 12, climate action; SDG13, life below water;
    SDG 14, life on land; SDG 15, etc. for global sustainable development) (Dubey
    et al., 2020; Moomen et al., 2019). 3. Can digitalization catalyze strategies
    to ensure clean water for all? 3.1. Artificial intelligence and data mining-assisted
    approaches for optimal design and control of water treatment systems Water treatment
    systems (WTSs), such as wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), drinking water treatment
    plants (DWTPs), and desalination plants, are complex systems that integrate different
    processes to remove pollutants, impurities, and salts from target water bodies
    (Asadi et al., 2017; Heck et al., 2019; Ming-Yang, 2013). The traditional design
    of WTSs relies on expert knowledge of different treatment processes and cannot
    be efficiently generalized. Generalization has lead to oversized designs of treatment
    units and improper selection of treatment processes, which increases capital expenditures
    and influences the final product water quality. Conventional operation of WTSs
    employs instrumentation, control, and automation (ICA) techniques, but sometimes
    fault signals from instruments without regular maintenance may lead to failure
    responses to the system''s control (Qiu et al., 2018). Most of central control
    systems in WTSs are only capable of acquiring data rather than processing data
    to guide subsequent actions due to the workforce lacking knowledge in data science
    (Newhart et al., 2019). The underutilization of the big data in WTSs would lead
    to the unnecessary increase in operating costs and sometimes inefficient treatment.
    In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have been increasingly
    applied to translate the passive data into actionable knowledge to improve the
    WTSs operation and support decision-making (Al Aani et al., 2019; Corominas et
    al., 2018; Haimi et al., 2013; Li et al., 2021). The use of the AI approach to
    optimize the design and control of water treatment systems can be dated back to
    three decades ago (Krovvidy et al., 1991; Zvi, 1992). An early review outlined
    the difficulties of the expert system approach, which is based on advanced mathematical
    techniques and was prevalently used for operational control of WWTP in the early
    days, in acquiring and representing knowledge of the complex phenomena (Zvi, 1992).
    It highlighted the advantages of AI techniques particularly the artificial neural
    networks (ANN) in water and wastewater plant modeling, expert rule extraction,
    fault detection and diagnosis, plant and instrument monitoring, dynamic forecasting,
    and robust control (Zvi, 1992). One of the earliest studies using the AI approach
    to design a water treatment system proposed two phases: the analysis and synthesis
    phases (Krovvidy et al., 1991). In the analysis phase, an inductive learning algorithm
    and expert rules are arranged together to evaluate the treatment efficiency of
    several compounds at different concentrations by an individual treatment process.
    In the synthesis phase, the sequence of different treatment processes satisfying
    the treatment targets are obtained using the knowledge rules generated from the
    analysis phase via the neural network method. This study laid a foundation for
    the later decision support system (DSS) development to select and sequence water
    treatment processes, and design treatment facilities (Hamouda et al., 2009). Fig.
    4 shows the typical four-stage DSS for WTSs design involving AI techniques, including
    water treatment problem analysis and interpretation, developing reasoning models,
    process sequential decision optimization, validating DSS logic, and enhancing
    user interactivity (Hamouda et al., 2009). In a recent study, the optimization
    of WWTPs design was realized via the data mining and AI techniques such as artificial
    neural network and fuzzy logic, following an integral procedure including data
    collection and cleaning, data warehouse, data mining, and web user interface (Qiu
    et al., 2018). Download : Download high-res image (353KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. Stages of developing a water treatment decision support
    system. Figure adopted from (Hamouda et al., 2009). Apart from the design of the
    WTSs, the optimal control and operation of the WTSs are equally important to maximize
    technical benefits and cost savings. During the treatment processes, vast volumes
    of data are generated and some are monitored online and collected simultaneously
    via various sensing technologies. Data-mining techniques are incorporated into
    sensing techniques to verify process normalcy and create knowledge on plant malfunctioning
    (Corominas et al., 2018; Haimi et al., 2013). Advanced information extraction
    and Human-interpretable information extraction based on AI and data-mining techniques
    are further developed to transform the data into useful information and knowledge
    for the effective control and optimization of operation of WTSs (Corominas et
    al., 2018). Newhart et al. summarized the data-driven technologies used in WWTPs
    for the purpose of fault detection, variable prediction, and advanced automated
    control to reduce energy consumption, ensure product water quality and prevent
    system failure (Fig. 5) (Newhart et al., 2019). Li et al. reviewed AI and machine
    learning for nonlinear relationship analysis and process control for DWTPs (Li
    et al., 2021). They specifically introduced the current status of these data-driven
    technologies in each treatment unit from source water quality monitoring and identification
    to the accurate and efficient control of each treatment unit, such as the control
    and prediction of coagulation dosage, the analysis of the formation of disinfection
    by-products, and the advanced control of membrane fouling. Some recent cases were
    reported on the use of machine learning to develop model soft-sensor for predictive
    control of WWTPs (Bernardelli et al., 2020; Hernández-del-Olmo et al., 2019).
    AI and machine learning techniques have also exhibited promise to revolutionize
    the automation of the desalination process, especially in the renewable energy-driven
    desalination processes (Al Aani et al., 2019). Cabrera et al. (Cabrera et al.,
    2018) compared three machine learning techniques, namely artificial neural networks
    (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), and random forests (RF), in predicting the
    wind-driven seawater desalination performance (Fig. 6). They found that (1) SVM
    and RF are significantly better to predict the plant''s performances than neural
    networks, and (2) variable pressure and flow operating mode are more continuous
    than constant pressure and flow mode. Without focusing exclusively on either AI
    techniques or a conventional expert system approach, a recent study proposed a
    hybrid statistical machine learning method to improve the accuracy in predicting
    ammonia in municipal wastewater treatment (Newhart et al., 2020). This study provided
    a new perspective to develop new and rigorous treatment models by integrating
    conventional statistical methods and advanced AI methods. Download : Download

    developed to compare the three machine learning techniques in wind-driven seawater
    desalination plant. Figure adapted from (Cabrera et al., 2018). Despite the promise
    of AI techniques for predictive and optimal control of WTSs, the utilization of
    these advanced data techniques is constrained by some conditions. For example,
    although the data do not need to be linearly correlated or parametrically distributed,
    those monitored variables must have a high sample frequency and number of historical
    observations (Newhart et al., 2019). Some challenges for using these advanced
    techniques are also identified, such as (1) difficulties in the acquisition of
    useful data in complex environment for screening and identifying targeted contaminants,
    and (2) challenges on the establishment of a macro intelligence model and decision
    scheme for entire treatment plants to support the overall management in the water
    supply system (Li et al., 2021). 3.2. Integration of water sensing to ensure water
    quality and protect public health Water of drinking quality is a fait accompli
    that is being placed at stake due to increasing water quality violations (Dettori
    et al., 2019; “US Water Quality Wake-Up Call: Americans Report Increase in Instances
    of Water Contamination,” 2019). For instance, The American Society of Civil Engineers
    evaluated America''s actual condition of water infrastructure with “D” grade (ASCE,
    2017). However, water quality violations are an endemic problem worldwide that
    becomes more concerning in developing areas. Recent examples of significant quality
    violations are the Flint water crisis (i.e., lead contamination from aging pipes)
    (Morckel, 2017), the pressing problems associated with per- and polyfluoroalkyl
    substances (PFASs) in water (Sima and Jaffé, 2021), the high arsenic levels in
    drinking water sources (Gifford et al., 2018; Rahman et al., 2018), cyanotoxins
    blooms (Serrà et al., 2021), or water disinfection needs at point of use (Chu
    et al., 2019; Montenegro-Ayo et al., 2020). The variable water quality arises
    as a severe health threat for users. Smart cities of the future should warrant
    accessible water of the highest quality to all their citizens that meets maximum
    concentration levels defined by the World Health Organization. Water is one of
    the pivotal components that will define the smart cities of the future. Smart
    water refers to the holistic approach to manage this resource, related infrastructure,
    treatment, and delivery (Wu et al., 2020). As cities invest in updating old-fashioned
    infrastructure, it is the possibility to integrate internet-enabled tools and
    emerging decentralized smart technologies (e.g., treatment at the point of delivery
    or point of use). Real-time water quality audits at critical control points can
    define when decentralized water treatment may be required to operate to ensure
    public health (Richard et al., 2020). Integrating such neural networks between
    information technology and modular on/off treatment systems can become a game-changer
    for ensuring access to water of drinking quality for all. There is an existing
    need to develop and deploy artificial intelligence systems that identify a water
    quality issue (e.g., high nitrate levels, bacteria presence, etc.) and activate
    immediate action for its remediation. Such Smart Actions will ensure sustainable
    and healthy environments in cities. 4. How can digitalization address energy challenges?
    The energy sector faces several challenges that range from well-known old dilemmas,
    such as overcoming barriers for the grid integration of the ever-fluctuating renewable
    energy resources, adapting the offer to the demand, or increasing the efficiency
    of the energy processes in the industry, to facing new foreseeable issues, such
    as addressing the upcoming increasing energy demands derived from the spread of
    digitalization worldwide (Coroamă and Mattern, 2019), and the security issues
    that may be derived from an interconnected energy generation system (Ebrahimy
    et al., 2018). Digitalization opens a broad range of exciting possibilities as
    in any technological revolution but brings, inevitably, a series of concerns.
    Digitalization is expected to increase the sustainability of our energy systems,
    spread electricity to remote areas, and improve the way we use it. However, digitalization
    may also open the door to novel challenges for our energy systems, for which we
    need to be prepared. In the following sections, we discuss how digitalization
    will impact the sustainability of energy systems by addressing its role in the
    integration of renewable resources, its smart management in the complexity of
    our energy systems puzzles, its use to optimize energy in the ever-insatiable
    industrial sector, and the needs for storage systems that its use will bring,
    as an essential part to fulfill the former targets. 4.1. Renewable energy sources
    and distributed electricity generation The conventional electricity grid is designed
    around centralized generation. As such, large power plants are used to generate
    electricity, typically powered by fossil fuels. Subsequently, the electricity
    is sent through the transmission lines to consumers, providing, essentially, a
    one-way flow of electricity in the grid. However, even in this situation, digitalization
    has been a key for a few years. For example, detailed modeling is performed daily
    to predict electricity demand based on weather conditions, climatology, or societal
    habits (i.e., when people come home from work to cook dinner, large events such
    as football matches, and even advertisement breaks which drive people towards
    their fridge). As such, and despite few events that may cause over-generation
    of electricity, supply and demand can be managed with high accuracy. However,
    the introduction of scalable renewable energy technologies such as wind and solar
    have shaken up the system by introducing the concept of distributed energy generation.
    There are several potential benefits of distributed electricity generation. First,
    electricity can be generated close to where it is needed. This is particularly
    the case of rooftop solar photovoltaics (PV), where consumers can generate their
    own electricity or become electricity generators for other households. Second,
    it avoids the need to upgrade infrastructure by avoiding transmission losses.
    Furthermore, some distributed generation sources closely match the demand (e.g.,
    solar with the demand for air-conditioning load on a hot summer day). As such,
    distributed generation can help reduce one of the biggest costs to electricity
    networks, which need to have transmission lines over-dimensioned to accommodate
    the highest demand of the year placed on the overall transmission system. Third,
    generation only needs to compete against the retail cost of electricity, not the
    wholesale cost, providing potential savings and investment opportunities for consumers.
    Nevertheless, the use of distributed energy systems, intermittent in nature, requires
    further digitalization of existing systems to accurately model the contribution
    of individual electricity supplies into the grid, and their dynamics due, for
    instance, to changing weather conditions. Digitalization, including distributed
    generators modeling, projections of energy demand, and smart control for energy
    savings, is therefore needed to help ensure the grid''s stability in terms of
    both voltage and frequency, which is disrupted by the asynchronous nature of the
    renewable energy systems. Hence, the transition to distributed energy systems
    that renewable resources bring will imply a more critical role of digitalization.
    Moreover, consumers may benefit from increased digitalization of energy systems,
    as, for instance, the shift to smart digital meters can encourage them to avoid
    the use of electricity during peak times (Maglakelidze et al., 2019). Additionally,
    smart energy management can be used for intermittent electricity generation and
    supply in households, for example, choosing when to heat hot water (i.e., which
    can be seen as a thermal battery) instead of exporting excess electricity to the
    grid when it is not needed. Moreover, a grid-wide smart energy system can also
    decide when that surplus electricity is more valuable being transmitted through
    the grid for another purpose (e.g., charging electric vehicles or hydrogen generation).
    This enables the opportunity for peer-to-peer electricity trading, allowing electricity
    exchanges with neighboring consumers rather than selling it to the electricity
    provider. For large apartment buildings or micro-grids, this can effectively happen
    by having the main meter and sub-meters for each individual consumer so that the
    surplus electricity by one user can be exported to another user within the microgrid,
    and net surplus or deficits can be exchanged with the main electricity grid. This
    system may maximize energy savings to the expense of increasing the system and
    control complexity, for which digitalization of the measuring systems will be
    crucial. These features, in turn, can be upscaled, allowing the optimal tracking
    of energy exports and trans-national energy exchanges. The digitalization of large
    energy distribution systems can also be used to control, manage, and provide grid
    protection with energy storage or grid stabilization by using large batteries
    such as in South Australia (Faunce et al., 2018), which can provide urgent stabilization
    of the grid and avoid a complete network shutdown in the event of an unforeseen
    shutdown of a major fossil fuel power plant. Distributed energy systems offer,
    therefore, the path towards sustainable energy systems, and their development
    requires parallel development of their digitalized control and modeling. Nevertheless,
    it has to be mentioned that despite notable advances in digitalization in the
    last few years, the main driver and accelerator in the shift to distributed energy
    systems has been the drop in photovoltaic systems cost, which has gone below that
    of other renewable and fossil-based resources, as shown in Fig. 7. In fact, as
    of today, the low payback times for solar-generated electricity at the residential
    level, and even large solar plants, can be cheaper than the generation cost of
    coal-based electricity. Thus, the current situation is the best possible, and
    digitalization offers the key solution to the biggest challenge for distributed
    renewable energy systems, which is the supply and demand management for intermittent
    generation technologies. It is up to the development of digitalization technologies
    to catch up and make the most of it. Download : Download high-res image (379KB)

    of different energy sources It is clear that the modernization of power systems
    brings a number of benefits to all energy stakeholders. However, these advantages
    are challenged by the system transit to the new technology and system innovation.
    Nevertheless, despite the high level of complexity that integrated and distributed
    energy systems may imply, the concept of smart grid technologies offers a solid
    platform for a safe, stable, and sustainable transition. The conceptual framework
    of smart grids, which can be represented as in Fig. 8, consists of (i) the application
    of intelligent strategies to effectively allow the coordination of the energy
    flow between generation and the consumption of power (Bansal, 2019; Mbungu et
    al., 2020, Mbungu et al., 2019); (ii) the coordination of diverse energy resources
    by encouraging maximum use of renewable energy resources; (iii) the integration
    of distributed and diverse energy storage systems; (iv) energy management policies
    through which the relationship between the consumer and the supplier is coordinated.

    Fig. 8. Overview of intelligent energy system (Mbungu et al., 2020). In order
    to become a reality, smart energy systems need the development of optimal control
    schemes from the production sites to the consumption sites. Currently, energy
    management strategies use smart grid technologies to guarantee optimal energy
    coordination into the electrical system. The features that the smart grid technologies
    offer provide the electrical system with the opportunities of having a digitalized
    system with diverse possibilities to optimally coordinate several energy resources.
    Contrary to traditional energy networks, smart grids are adaptive, distributed,
    and have smart metering sensors that allow two-way communication, providing pervasive
    control, self-monitoring, and remote checks in a real-time and dynamic environment.
    The development and deployment of smart grids will define the implementation perspective
    of the future electrical. One of the greatest challenges will be to guarantee
    a better relationship of the energy trilemma (Mbungu et al., 2019), which consists
    of solving the equilibrium aspect of the equilateral triangle where the sides
    are energy equity, energy security, and environmental sustainability. Therefore,
    in the future perspective of power systems, we will not only be looking for affordable
    and green and clean energy generation, but also secure and reliable energy resources.
    And to this purpose, the novel approach of smart grid will need to integrate the
    concepts of energy internet and the internet of energy (IoE). 4.3. Energy efficiency
    in industries and transportation Distributed generation and smart grids are thus
    the keys for a greener energy supply, but a crucial factor that may impact the
    energy use sustainability to the same or even greater extent as its efficient
    use. When it comes to energy use, the industrial and transport sectors represent
    more than half of the total energy consumption in the world (Taylor et al., 2010).
    A great majority of processes consuming energy in these sectors require high temperatures,
    which are achieved, mostly through the combustion of fossil fuels, therefore contributing
    to most of the greenhouse gas emissions on the planet (Panayiotou et al., 2017).
    These processes, have efficiencies between 45% (i.e., Diesel engines) to about
    85% (i.e., gas boilers), meaning that around 15–55% of the energy provided by
    fossil fuels is wasted in the form of residual heat. This heat represents a significant
    waste of energy resources, which in turn contributes to global warming, exposing
    these sectors'' incapacity for using the valuable resources in a smart way. The
    standardization of inline sensors for processes metering and the popularization
    of logging systems and connectivity (Halstenberg et al., 2019), conforming the
    concept of the internet of things in the industry, will soon provide extensive
    datasets for process optimization that may allow for energy savings of up to 20%
    in industry (Kagermann, 2015). Beyond static operation, the continuous availability
    of processes data will allow a rapid adaptation of the processes configurations
    in combination with autonomous control systems, which in turn, may self-learn
    daily from the generated data by using neural network-based systems (Han et al.,
    2016). This new capability may be easily extended to the transport sector, especially
    the one concerning the shipping of goods by air, sea, and road (i.e., trucks),
    which are the three main contributors to the CO2 emissions from transport (Dray
    et al., 2012). Data logging onboard ships and trucks have become a reality in
    recent years, where many companies initially motivated to reduce the economic
    stress of ship owners by reducing fuel consumption, have found their side contribution
    on cutting down emissions (Fruth and Teuteberg, 2017). Similarly, the road transport
    sector is taking up the baton, as digitalization is currently claimed as the main
    driver for change in the sector (Noussan et al., 2020; Schiller et al., 2016).
    Interconnected devices between trucks and supplier centers may allow dynamic route
    optimization, ensuring better capacity utilization and fuel savings. Equally,
    individual systems that monitor each driver''s style, and the maintenance needs
    for each vehicle (e.g., wear on components) may be used to dynamically optimize
    the operating parameters to save fuel, reduce emissions, and increase the truck''s
    lifetime. Nevertheless, it should be kept in mind that increased energy efficiency
    from the user side may bring with it the so-called induction effect, by which
    more optimized energy systems may create new energy demands. For instance, it
    has been claimed that the evolution of autonomous cars may increase the amount
    of users that, because of special mobility needs, may not be using cars before
    or were using the ‘greener’ public transport (Coroamă and Mattern, 2019). Moreover,
    the forecasted gains in efficiency may be more than outweighed by the increase
    in energy consumption due to new digital services, therefore resulting in a counterproductive
    effect. It is therefore in our hands, and those of the future generations, to
    investigate the impact of different aspects of digitalization in our energy systems,
    aiming at define which digital technologies and services may foster more environmentally
    friendly and sustainable energy production technologies, and which may only result
    in a rebound effect (Coroamă and Mattern, 2019). 5. Does digitalization hold the
    key to catalyze changes on industry and social wellbeing? 5.1. Industry 4.0 towards
    sustainable manufacturing and infrastructure Industrial production of goods and
    services is undergoing significant changes in the last years evolving rapidly
    as digital technologies improve communication among the actors along the value
    chain (Correani et al., 2020). The term Industry 4.0 was coined to address the
    fact that the fourth industrial revolution will rely on digitalization rather
    than only automation as the third did, and that future production will be modular
    within factories consisting of “smart” objects. This trend is given by an application
    pull that requires standardization of systems, short development periods, individualization
    on demand (batch one manufacturing), flexibility, setting safe and secure production
    environments, resource efficiency, and decentralization for decision-making. Simultaneously,
    there is a technology push that will enable increased automation and mechanization,
    networking of elements leading to completely digitalized environments and an increasing
    degree of miniaturization (Lasi et al., 2014; Oztemel and Gursev, 2020). Industry
    4.0 conceives an integration of the entire product life-cycle ranging from the
    raw material acquisition stage all the way to the end of life of the product.
    In between there are manufacturing (and intermediate transformation) steps and
    the users, which also requires transportation (see Fig. 9) (Ardito et al., 2019;
    Stock and Seliger, 2016). Download : Download high-res image (413KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 9. Vision of the product life cycle in Industry
    4.0 integrated with material, energy and information flows through digital technologies.
    The vision of Industry 4.0 perfectly aligns with the concept of lean manufacturing
    (LM) since both approaches pursue improvements in quality, productivity, seek
    a reduction of waste, and are customer-oriented. With its historical origin in
    the Toyota Production System, LM has been a paradigm that has pushed industrial
    practice to operational excellence for years. It is based on five main guidelines,
    namely: the identification of value, map the value stream, creation of continuous
    flow between production steps, introduce pull between these steps, and, finally,
    seek perfection in the performance (D''Ippolito et al., 2019; Womack and Jones,
    1996). The reutilization of material flows is indeed a point of paramount importance
    in LM practice and, obviously, Industry 4.0 and must be emphasized. In this sense,
    the principles of both concepts are coherent with the perspective of a green chemical
    sector of the future, whereby industry would need to consider and implement “waste
    design.” This philosophy deals with how production should be readapted to design
    processes that (a) avoid as much as possible waste creation and subsequent management
    and (b) make by-products in the processes useful raw materials (Zimmerman et al.,
    2020). In the end, this will lead to the creation of value by reutilization throughout
    the supply chain contributing to a circular economy, which is crucial to consider
    sustainable manufacturing decisions (de Sousa Jabbour et al., 2018). Another consideration
    is that the transportation of completed or intermediate goods demands the use
    of the most sustainable infrastructure to connect the different stations of the
    value chain, optimizing costs while minimizing emissions and safety issues (Dev
    et al., 2020). As for energy flows, originating from renewable sources, they will
    go into smart grids to which each smart factory is connected to manage the demand
    or supply of energy. The core of the manufacturing process would be the smart
    factories (also referred to as “dark factories,” “lights out factories,” or “unmanned
    factories”). Smart manufacturing aims to optimize concept generation and production
    by employing computer control and high levels of adaptability hence promoting
    self-organization and decentralized decision-making. For this, it takes advantage
    of advanced information and manufacturing technologies to enable flexibility in
    physical processes to operate in dynamic global markets (Oztemel and Gursev, 2020).
    In turn, smart factories are heavily reliant on machine-to-machine communication
    through cyber-physical systems (CPSs). CPSs are one of the key aspects of Industry
    4.0, and they encompass a network of objects and systems communicating with each
    other over the internet and a virtual environment created by computer simulation
    of objects and behaviors in the real world. Cloud computing becomes essential
    for the interconnection of CPSs as it enables data mining and determining responses
    to be given by the self-organized systems. Within smart factories, virtual manufacturing
    (VM) allows the simulation and optimization of operations and processes of the
    different modules with different technologies like computer-aided process design,
    product life cycle management, virtual or augmented reality, or 3D modeling, to
    name a few. VM technologies, in the end, are key elements to the individualization
    of the production, which in the end will be realized by additive manufacturing,
    such as 3D or 4D printing (Kamble et al., 2018; Kerin and Pham, 2019; Oztemel
    and Gursev, 2020). In contrast with Industry 4.0 and considering its prior establishment,
    the LM philosophy can be regarded as a relatively low-tech approach whose excellence
    stems from its simplicity and the consideration of humans as a foundation to sustain
    continuous improvement of practices. Although this may represent a potential conflict
    from the standpoint of the involvement of manpower, given the similarity of many
    of the objectives of LM and Industry 4.0, it is more than arguable that positive
    associations between the two exist (Tortorella and Fettermann, 2018). A recent
    study by Pagliosa et al. covered precisely the potential synergies and the application
    of Industry 4.0 technologies that can overcome difficulties that directly concern
    LM (Pagliosa et al., 2019). After identifying a total of 9 Industry 4.0 technologies
    and 14 LM practices and analyzing their pairwise interactions, it was realized
    that very positive associations exist with a very high potential to achieve higher
    operational performance. A total of 24 relationships were suggested for prioritization,
    such as the relationship between CPSs and value stream mapping. Likewise, some
    technologies were also deemed a lower priority, such as advanced robotization,
    as they did not pose a definitive advantage to several LM practices. Another conclusion
    of the study is the highlight of the opportunities in research related to the
    area of Industry 4.0 and LM, which include the obvious need for validation of
    the synergies proposed, a categorization of technologies and LM practices in different
    levels of the value stream and the examination of the effects of the proposed
    relationships on operational performance (Pagliosa et al., 2019). Integration
    of life cycle assessments for decision-making is still underexplored and undoubtedly
    necessary to consider material and energy flows (Jose and Ramakrishna, 2018),
    which can help establish concepts like zero-waste manufacturing. This idea advocates
    for an industrial transformation that will reduce the designing for zero waste,
    smart auditing and collecting of any waste generated, subsequent waste to resource
    conversion, and establishing collaborative platforms for industrial symbiosis
    (Kerdlap et al., 2019). While it appears that the development of environmental
    and economic impacts of Industry 4.0 is promising, and several projects are already
    running (Oztemel and Gursev, 2020), the societal impact will have to be thoroughly
    assessed. Artificial intelligence technologies will enable autonomous vehicles
    and lights-out manufacturing, whereby the presence of operators will be minimal.
    These will reduce hazards by avoiding the presence of workers in the corresponding
    factories or transport infrastructures but could also lead to significant job
    losses. In the current context of ongoing rapid changes, the definition of the
    fifth industrial revolution is starting to take shape. Industry 5.0 would represent
    an extension to Industry 4.0 evolving into manufacturing practices that focus
    on the personalized demands of individual customers. Therefore, the application
    of human intelligence is key to the development of this concept. Thus, many efforts
    are being put into tools to increase personalization, including virtual reality
    or holography among which capitalize on the human-machine interaction (Javaid
    and Haleem, 2020). 5.2. Use of e-Health technologies to promote wellbeing and
    quality of life Digitalization is revolutionizing healthcare facilitating access
    to health services and addressing significant challenges in aging, mental health,
    and other costly and complex health care needs, overcoming the shortage of workers,
    and providing care to remote locations. e-Health is a critical area to expand
    and support as eHealth has the potential to provide affordable, sustainable, and
    quality health care (Bucci et al., 2019; Krick et al., 2019; Ossebaard and Van
    Gemert-Pijnen, 2016). Digital health includes different technological advances
    such as telehealth and telemedicine. Telehealth is the use of electronic information
    and telecommunication technologies to support and promote long-distance clinical
    health care, patient and professional health-related education, public health,
    and health administration. Whereas, telemedicine refers to connections at a distance
    with professional providers to obtain treatment via videoconferencing (Weinstein
    et al., 2018). However, the World Health Organization uses the term e-health to
    encompass all these different aspects related to the internet of health things
    (IoHT) that are advancing healthcare during the Digital Age (Larson et al., 2018;
    Ossebaard and Van Gemert-Pijnen, 2016; WHO, 2019). The reliance on IoHT has increased
    over the years, but it has gained more popularity during the COVID-19 Pandemic
    as an efficient alternative to access health services while respecting social
    distancing measures. Telemedicine brings solutions to consumers regarding their
    location and provides equal access to health, increasing health services at a
    lower price (Weinstein et al., 2018). Telemedicine is a helpful tool for reaching
    outpatients in rural areas to provide equal access to healthcare. With federal
    legislation increasing demand for medical services already in short supply, telehealth
    and telemedicine are often seen as more efficient methods for people to receive
    care. Eliminating traveling implies a series of savings, reduce hassles in many
    homes, and saves time, especially in rural areas (Larson et al., 2018; Rupert
    et al., 2017). Furthermore, telemedicine offers the opportunity to support persons
    of different ethnicities, cultures, and languages by facilitating access to health
    care providers that are culturally competent and offer translator services (Larson
    et al., 2018). Despite improvements in high-speed internet in developing countries,
    there are many barriers to overcome to implement telehealth from the part of organizations
    (e.g., cost), patients (e.g., age, level of education, computer literacy), and
    providers (e.g., technically challenged staff, resistance to change) (Scott Kruse
    et al., 2016). The IoHT is still in its infancy but a promising public health
    tool with the potential to significantly increase access to health care for medically
    underserved populations of different backgrounds and ethnicities. Furthermore,
    there is a widespread belief that IoHT can reduce healthcare costs and improve
    health outcomes overall (Bashshur et al., 2016). Wellbeing is one of the SDGs
    gaining importance worldwide. Digital tools play a vital role in promoting wellbeing
    and improving quality of life as these facilitate access to health care. Quality
    of life is an individual perception of physical, mental, and social wellbeing
    state even in the presence of a disease. Mobile phone apps and computers are resources
    for the population to communicate in different ways (phone call, video conference,
    email, app), allowing patients to meet and follow up with their providers. Implementation
    and normalization of eHealth enable the person to self-manage their health condition,
    improve their wellbeing, and prevent future health problems (Ossebaard and Van
    Gemert-Pijnen, 2016; Weinstein et al., 2018). Some examples are apps for promoting
    positive mental health strategies, physical activity, better management of diabetes,
    and heart control, among others (Weinstein et al., 2018). These IoHT applications
    have demonstrated that digital tools improve the overall quality of life of patients
    with chronic conditions while helping them manage their health from the comfort
    of their homes. Persons engaged in e-health achieve the same positive health outcomes
    as those who have the usual care at the clinic or hospital (Larson et al., 2018).
    Some examples of the use of telehealth and other digital sources to improve quality
    of life are: (i) telemonitoring to assist in the care and management of diabetes
    (Lee and Lee, 2018), (ii) use of telemedicine to help to control asthma (Chongmelaxme
    et al., 2019), (iii) telemedicine to help individuals with heart failure (Lin
    et al., 2017), (iv) telehealth to assist Cancer patients (Larson et al., 2018),
    and (v) telemonitoring for individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
    or COPD (Tupper et al., 2018). Telemedicine can reduce the number of admission
    and length of stays in the hospital. Preventive measures have demonstrated to
    delay mortality (Lin et al., 2017). All these aspects diminish the use of medical
    resources and positively impact the healthcare system and accelerate care attention.
    Emerging technologies such as virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and
    videogames that induce the participant to exercise (also known as exergaming)
    present opportunities to improve our community''s wellbeing and quality of life.
    VR/AR offer quasi-naturalistic and real-life experiences that might not perform
    in a safe environment for the person. VR/AR allows treating, stimulating, and
    improving the patient''s wellbeing by training physical and cognitive abilities
    (Zucchella et al., 2018). VR reality can make dull activities more entertaining
    and increase adherence (Schröder et al., 2019; Slater and Sanchez-Vives, 2016).
    For example, adding VR to a stationary bike contributes to increasing the person''s
    motivation for training by making the stationary exercise more attractive (Slater
    and Sanchez-Vives, 2016). In rehabilitation, VR offers a safe home-training environment
    to improve mobility (Schröder et al., 2019). Additionally, VR interventions improve
    cognition (memory) and psychological functioning, such as alleviating anxiety,
    impacting the wellbeing of persons with neurocognitive disorders such as Alzheimer''s,
    stroke, and mild cognitive impairment (Moreno et al., 2019). 6. Can digitalization
    tools assist us in climate research? In climate research, multi spatial-temporal
    climatic data form a baseline to understand climate variability and future projections.
    Digitalization of historical climate data and availability of real-time climate
    data revolutionized the prediction of extreme climate events, and developed strategies
    for their mitigation and adaptation (Munang et al., 2013). The open-source data
    policy, robust storage and processing infrastructure, advanced algorithms, less
    cost and time, and participatory scientific forums have enthused global researchers
    from interdisciplinary fields to work in sustainability research at different
    scales. This section focuses on the role of digital solutions as a way forward
    to comprehend more about the prospect of digital solutions for climate actions
    to attain ecological sustainability. The key areas of our interest are the application
    of digitalization in biodiversity research, earth observation, and climate action.
    6.1. Digitalization in Global Biodiversity Assessment Since the beginning of the
    Anthropocene epoch, human-induced impacts on the environment, including urbanization,
    pollution, globalization, Green House Gases (GHG) emission, and climate change,
    are ever-increasing. Quantifying such impact based on available data is a big
    debate since there is a question on delimiting the onset of the Anthropocene still
    prevails (Lewis and Maslin, 2015). The practice of collecting and availability
    of historical and real-time biodiversity data in digital format has evidently
    increased worldwide from the beginning of the twenty-first century. The Global
    Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) is an intergovernmental organization
    that hosts an online interoperable network of biodiversity databases from biological
    surveys and collections done at different geographical realms. The GBIF holds
    nearly one billion biodiversity occurrences records, of which nearly 150 million
    were based on a preserved specimen from natural history collection (Edwards, 2004;
    Yesson et al., 2007). However, estimates suggest that only 10% of specimen samples
    are available in digital format (Ball-Damerow et al., 2019). Online public participation
    has the potential to further accelerate the digitalization of biodiversity research
    specimens through three stages: transcription, geotagging, and specimen annotation.
    There are concerns over the data quality during the incorporation of citizen science
    data. But, this could be overcome by data quality control efforts such as standardization
    of transcription, spatial data accuracy, targeted training, development of pliable
    and multistage database management systems, practicing appropriate statistical
    procedures, and data validation protocols (Ellwood et al., 2015). It is conclusive
    that digitalization of collection-based research helps to derive and assess biological
    baseline to evaluate the impact of climate change, land use (biophysical characteristics
    of land) and land cover (anthropogenic utilization of land) change, invasive species,
    and anthropogenic induced impact on global biodiversity (Hedrick et al., 2020).
    6.2. Ecological monitoring to evaluate land and marine ecosystems The need for
    studying the long-term impact of climatic and anthropogenic factors on the environment
    is much needed to assess biodiversity loss and its implications on biogeochemical
    cycles and global food security (Shiklomanov et al., 2019). Environmental monitoring
    procedure incorporates processes such as background investigation, scheme determination,
    distribution optimization, field sampling, experimental analysis, data collection,
    and analysis complexion. Traditional data collection methods collect field samples
    on environmental change and pollution, which is now augmented through the intervention
    of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. The vast amount of such scattered,
    unstructured and data collected worldwide could be connected through telecommunication
    and the internet for a single-point access. Big data analysis and cloud computing
    have enabled mining of such a vast amount of data to extract useful information
    to frame environmental management strategies (Li, 2014). Recent advancements in
    the sensing and communication infrastructures with storage infrastructure, flexible
    and interoperable geodatabase, cloud processing, and advanced algorithms have
    made the digital data inevitable input for continuous mapping and spatiotemporal
    monitoring of the land and marine ecosystems. Contemporary earth observation sensors
    such as multispectral, hyperspectral, microwave, and LiDAR provide high spatial
    and spectral resolution data utilizing diverse wavelength regions of the electromagnetic
    spectrum. The archived and real-time data from these sensors provide a plethora
    of information that could be effectively combined with ground-based information
    to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of earth''s ecosystems. The IoT technologies
    enable us to build and deploy the communication of interconnected sensors to avail
    continuous real-time data (Abraham et al., 2017). The latest developments in the
    open-access interactive tools and frameworks for processing such a massive volume
    of data using LiMES (Live Monitoring of Earth Surface), and xROI helps even a
    non-expert in remote sensing to analyze and derive useful products out of raw
    data (Giuliani et al., 2017; Seyednasrollah et al., 2019). Furthermore, the integration
    of social sensing data through mobile technologies in participatory environmental
    management programs suggests that the participation of stakeholders enhances mapping
    and provides new information on the socio-ecological system (Brammer et al., 2016;
    Dong et al., 2019). 6.3. Digital earth observation data for the assessment of
    essential climate variables Geospatial information infrastructure consists of
    technological, semantic, organizational, and legal components which enable the
    user to discover, share, and utilize geospatial data to assess the rapidly changing
    climate and its implications on our physical environment. The multi-source, multi-band,
    multi-variable, and multi-scale earth observation data combined with auxiliary
    data has inherent 4 V qualities (volume, variety, veracity, and velocity) of big
    data, which could valuably contribute to the effective monitoring of 34 Essential
    Climate Variables (ECVs) as identified by UNFCCC at multiple scales (Guo et al.,
    2015). Time series satellite data for understanding the temporal dynamics in vegetation
    (Measho et al., 2019), deltas and estuarine wetlands (Kuenzer et al., 2019), alpine
    wetlands (Wang et al., 2020), snow line changes (Hu et al., 2019), polar ice cover
    (Eythorsson et al., 2019), urban impervious surface (Kuang, 2019), urban microclimatic
    regions (Bechtel et al., 2019), marine phytoplankton (Dutkiewicz et al., 2019),
    and sea surface temperature (Merchant et al., 2019) in response to the global
    climate change have proven the application potential of geospatial data in different
    domains of environmental monitoring. Recent digital advances, including IoT, big
    data, cloud computing, machine learning, and deep learning techniques together
    can handle a massive number of datasets generated from synchronous satellite-aerial-ground-based
    observation systems for the continuous monitoring of atmosphere, hydrosphere,
    lithosphere, and cryosphere. From these observations, accurate, comprehensive,
    and diverse information on essential climate variables, extreme climate events,
    and global environmental change could be derived to further investigate spatiotemporal
    dynamics of climate change indicators from regional to global scale (Jia et al.,
    2020). 7. Conclusions The United Nations defined in 2015 the sustainable development
    goals (SDGs) to roadmap research and social needs towards equity and sustainable
    development of our society. The advent of digital technologies is a ray of hope
    on the horizon that can guide and catalyze the change towards achieving all the
    holistic 17 SDGs. The role of digitalization and the technologies associated with
    the internet of things (IoT) have been discussed for their potential to solve
    big challenges in the food-water-energy nexus, and enabling Industry 4.0, improving
    social wellbeing, and reducing the effects of climate change. The ever-growing
    global demand for food is one of the greatest challenges of this century, aggravated
    by the unequal access to food resources. Digital technologies are up-scaling sustainable
    agricultural land and resources management and strengthening the associated productivity,
    services, and livelihood security worldwide. For example, the use of remote sensing
    and GIS techniques is increasing agri-productions. The use of data is mapping
    and guiding effective land-use pattern, defining crop variety, and monitoring
    agroecosystem activities. The early implementation of various hardware (e.g.,
    sensors, drones, precise fertilization, etc.) combined with geo-mapping leads
    the new agriculture revolution, given the prediction capabilities to magnify production
    yield and improve sustainable agriculture. The use of mobile application software
    provides unique opportunities for connectivity with agricultural stakeholders
    and farmer independence. Furthermore, applications position the farming communities
    as the essential attributes of precision and sustainable agriculture while ensuring
    economic gains (reduced poverty). Smart cities of the future should ensure accessible
    water of the highest quality for all of their citizens. Big data and digitalization
    play an essential role in meeting these goals. The underutilization of big data
    in water treatment systems may be leading to an unnecessary increase in operating
    costs and sometimes inefficient treatment. Artificial intelligence technologies
    can translate passive data into actionable knowledge to improve operation and
    lead decision-making. Digitalization can lead to an optimized design of water
    treatment plants. Optimized control and operation through efficient data management
    can maximize technical benefits and result in cost savings. Data-mining techniques
    are incorporated into sensing techniques to verify process normalcy and create
    knowledge on plant malfunctioning to respond faster. Advanced automated control
    through digitalization holds the promise to reduce energy consumption, ensure
    product water quality and prevent system failure. Integration of internet-enabled
    tools and emerging decentralized smart technologies (e.g., treatment at the point
    of delivery or point of use) for-real time water quality audit at critical control
    points can define when decentralized water treatment may be required to operate
    to ensure the public health and facilitate equal access to safe water for all.
    Digitalization can enhance energy efficiency and provide sustainable alternatives.
    Modeling electricity usage based on data is used to predict demand based on weather
    conditions, climatology, or societal habits. These data-driven strategies can
    be translated to decentralized energy systems based on renewable sources (e.g.,
    photovoltaics). Smart management in the complexity of our energy systems puzzles
    is an extraordinarily complex matter that can be dealt with through integration
    on the internet of things. Energy management strategies based on digitalization
    tools can contribute to managing with high accuracy supply and demand for a more
    efficient and sustainable generation and use of energy. It has been suggested
    that smart use of datasets for process optimization may allow up to 20% energy
    savings. Similar energy benefits can be observed in transportation systems where
    interconnected devices between trucks and supplier centers may allow dynamic route
    optimization. These strategies will ensure better capacity utilization and fuel
    savings while decreasing CO2 emissions associated to transportation. Sustainable
    manufacturing is one of the key aspects of Industry 4.0 that conceives an integration
    of the entire product life-cycle. Digitalization and material selections become
    an essential element to improve green manufacturing approaches considering the
    entire product life and its reusability/recyclability. Furthermore, smart manufacturing
    integrates computer and internet of things aid strategies to optimize industrial
    yield. Computer control and machine-to-machine communication through cyber-physical
    systems have shown high adaptability and demonstrated optimized self-organization
    and decentralized decision-making. Healthcare and equal access to health are being
    revolutionized by digitalization. Reliance on the internet of health things has
    increased over the years, but it has gained more popularity during the COVID-19
    Pandemic as an efficient alternative to access health services while respecting
    social distancing measures. Telemedicine has been indispensable to bring solutions
    to consumers regardless of their location and income. Digital tools play a vital
    role in promoting wellbeing and improving quality of life through facilitating
    access to health care. Implementation and normalization of e-Health enable the
    person to self-manage health conditions, prevent them, monitor chronic needs,
    and improve citizens'' wellbeing and quality of life. The interconnection of SDGs
    is undeniable. Sustainable approaches have demonstrated synergies that can mitigate
    climate change and its effects. Digitalization and artificial intelligence support
    low carbon energy systems with the integration of highly efficient renewable energy
    that can also monitor and model responses of climate and biodiversity over time.
    In climate research, multi-spatial-temporal climatic data form a baseline to understand
    climate variability and future projections. Digitalization of historical climate
    data and availability of real-time climate data have revolutionized prediction
    and provided a framework for understanding the current climate events and impacts
    on biodiversity. The recent implementation of Internet of Things technology has
    drastically improved collection methods and on-time big data analysis, which could
    favorably contribute for the effective monitoring and solutions deployment. There
    is a clear need for studying the long-term impact of climatic and anthropogenic
    factors on environment and biodiversity. Digitalization is a game-changing tool
    to assist the scientist in this race against time to stop climate change. Digitalization
    defines the path towards a smart Green Planet by providing solutions and assisting
    sustainable development. Integration of IoT, big data management, and artificial
    intelligence have already demonstrated a myriad of benefits. Special attention
    should be paid to implications of inequal data access that can result in digital
    poverty and hence increase inequalities instead of reducing the gap. Cybersecurity
    of strongly interconnected systems through the cloud should be reinforced. However,
    the benefits of big data integration in our daily lives can promote quality of
    life and drastically assist humanity towards the sustainable challenges to ensure
    human, biodiversity, and earth resilience. Declaration of competing interest The

    Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: The Internet of
    Things (IoT) is the next era of communication. Using the IoT, physical objects
    can be empowered to create, receive, and exchange data in a seamless manner. Various
    IoT applications focus on automating different tasks and are trying to empower
    the inanimate physical objects to act without any human intervention. The existing
    and upcoming IoT applications are highly promising to increase the level of comfort,
    efficiency, and automation for the users. To be able to implement such a world
    in an ever-growing fashion requires high security, privacy, authentication, and
    recovery from attacks. In this regard, it is imperative to make the required changes
    in the architecture of the IoT applications for achieving end-to-end secure IoT
    environments. In this paper, a detailed review of the security-related challenges
    and sources of threat in the IoT applications is presented. After discussing the
    security issues, various emerging and existing technologies focused on achieving
    a high degree of trust in the IoT applications are discussed. Four different technologies,
    blockchain, fog computing, edge computing, and machine learning, to increase the
    level of security in IoT are discussed. This paper presents a detailed survey
    of IoT security. First of all the security critical IoT applications are discussed.

    connecting physical devices around us to the Internet is increasing rapidly. According
    to a recent Gartner report, there will be around 8.4 billion connected things
    worldwide in 2020. This number is expected to grow to 20.4 billion by 2022 [1].
    The use of IoT applications is increasing in all parts of the world. The major
    driving countries in this include western Europe, North America, and China [1].
    The number of machine to machine (M2M) connections is expected to grow from 5.6
    billion in 2016 to 27 billion in 2024 [1]. This leap in numbers itself declares
    IoT to be one of the major upcoming markets that could form a cornerstone of the
    expanding digital economy. The IoT industry is expected to grow in terms of revenue
    from 892billionin2018to 4 trillion by 2025 [2]. M2M connections cover a broad
    range of applications like smart cities, smart environment, smart grids, smart
    retail, smart farming, etc. [3]. Figure 1 shows the past, present and future architecture
    of IoT. In future, the devices are not only expected to be connected to the Internet
    and other local devices but are also expected to communicate with other devices
    on the Internet directly. Apart from the devices or things being connected, the
    concept of social IoT (SIoT) is also emerging. SIoT will enable different social
    networking users to be connected to the devices and users can share the devices
    over the Internet [4]. FIGURE 1. Present and future architecture of IoT. Show
    All With all this vast spectrum of IoT applications comes the issue of security
    and privacy. Without a trusted and interoperable IoT ecosystem, emerging IoT applications
    cannot reach high demand and may lose all their potential. Along with the security
    issues faced generally by the Internet, cellular networks, and WSNs, IoT also
    has its special security challenges such as privacy issues, authentication issues,
    management issues, information storage and so on. Table 1 summarizes various factors
    due to which securing IoT environment is much more challenging than securing normal
    information technology (IT) devices. Due to all these issues and vulnerabilities,
    the IoT applications create a fertile ground for different kinds of cyber threats.
    There have been various security and privacy attacks on the already deployed IoT
    applications worldwide. Mirai attack in the last quarter of 2016 was estimated
    to infect around 2.5 million devices connected to the Internet and launch distributed
    denial of service (DDoS) attack [5]. After Mirai, Hajime and Reaper are the other
    big botnet attacks launched against a large number of IoT devices [5]. IoT devices,
    being low powered and less secure, provide a gateway to the adversaries for entering
    into home and corporate networks, thereby giving easy access to the user’s data.
    Also, the domain of IoT is expanding beyond mere things or objects. There have
    been various successful attempts to implant IoT devices into the human body to
    monitor the live condition of various organs [6]. Attackers can target such devices
    to track the location of a particular individual or falsify data. Such an attack
    has not taken place yet in real life but can be highly dangerous, if such devices
    are compromised. TABLE 1 Comparison of Security of IT Devices and IoT Devices
    Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) is another area benefitting from the growth of IoT.
    In CPS physical objects in the environment are monitored, and actions are taken
    based on the physical changes. Since CPS encompass assets of critical importance
    (e.g., power grids, transportation systems), security vulnerabilities in such
    systems have serious consequences. However, security challenges for CPS have their
    unique characteristics and are outside the scope of this paper. In any IoT ecosystem
    or environment, there are four important layers. The first layer includes the
    use of various sensors and actuators to perceive the data or information to perform
    various functionalities. Based on that, in the second layer, a communication network
    is used to transmit the collected data. Most of the evolving IoT applications
    deploy the third layer, called a middleware layer, to act as a bridge between
    the network and application layer. Finally, on the fourth layer, there are various
    IoT based end-to-end applications like smart grids, smart transport, smart factories,
    etc. All of these four layers have security problems specific to them. Apart from
    these layers, various gateways connect these layers and help in the data movement.
    There are certain security threats specific to these gateways as well. In this
    paper, a detailed survey of IoT security solutions in the existing literature
    is presented. First of all, the fundamental constraints to achieve high levels
    for security in IoT applications are presented. The goal of this paper is to highlight
    the major existing and upcoming solutions for IoT security. Specifically, the
    four major classes of IoT security solutions namely: (1) blockchain based solutions;
    (2) fog computing based solutions; (3) machine learning based solutions and (4)
    edge computing based solutions are highlighted. Table 3 gives a list of acronyms
    related to IoT used in this paper. TABLE 2 Related Surveys on IoT Security TABLE
    3 List of Acronyms A. Related Surveys and Our Contributions There are various
    existing surveys on IoT security and privacy issues. Yuchen et al. [10] have summarized
    various security issues in IoT applications. Authors of [11] have discussed the
    security issues specific to location-based services in IoT. The authors target
    the particular problems related to localization and positioning of the IoT devices.

    and provide a detailed survey of related existing protocols and their security
    issues. M. Guizani et al. in [14] have surveyed various trust management techniques
    for IoT along with their pros and cons. Security mechanisms for IoT security such
    as software defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV)

    relationship between IoT and fog computing. Some of the security issues related
    to fog computing have also been discussed. Authors of [7] have discussed vulnerabilities
    faced by IoT in brief. Table 2 summarizes the main contributions of the previous
    comprehensive surveys on IoT security. Although there are several works in this
    direction, they are specific to certain limited aspects of IoT. This calls the
    need for a detailed survey on all the existing and upcoming security challenges
    in IoT applications. This paper will help the reader to get a detailed idea of
    the state-of-the-art in IoT security and will give them a general understanding
    of the area. The main contributions of this work are as follows: A classification
    of different IoT applications and specific security and privacy issues related
    to those applications. A detailed explanation of different threat sources in different
    layers of IoT. Detailed and realistic recommendations to improve the IoT infrastructure
    to facilitate secure communications. Review on the proposed countermeasures to
    the security issues in IoT. An assessment of the open issues, challenges and future
    research directions for developing secure IoT applications. B. Organization The
    organization of the rest of the paper is as follows: Section II describes various
    application areas of IoT where high security is required. Section III discusses
    various sources of threats in an IoT environment. In section IV various constraints
    and requirements to be considered while developing a secure IoT application are
    reviewed. Four major IoT security approaches, i.e., blockchain, fog computing,
    machine learning, and edge computing are presented in Section V, VI, VII, and
    VIII, respectively. Section IX describes various open issues, challenges and upcoming
    research opportunities in IoT security and finally, Section X concludes the paper.
    SECTION II. Security Critical Application Areas of IoT Security is highly critical
    in almost all IoT applications that have already been deployed or are in the process
    of deployment. The applications of IoT are increasing very rapidly and penetrating
    most of the existing industries. Although operators support these IoT applications
    through existing networking technologies, several of these applications need more
    stringent security support from technologies they use. In this section various
    security critical IoT applications are discussed. Smart Cities: Smart cities involve
    extensive use of emerging computation and communication resources for increasing
    the overall quality of life of the people [15]. It includes smart homes, smart
    traffic management, smart disaster management, smart utilities, etc. There is
    a push to make cities smarter, and governments worldwide are encouraging their
    development through various incentives [16]. Although the use of smart applications
    is intended to improve the overall quality of life of the citizens, it comes with
    a threat to the privacy of the citizens. Smart card services tend to put the card
    details and purchase behavior of the citizens at risk. Smart mobility applications
    may leak the location traces of the users. There are applications using which
    parents can keep track of their child. However, if such applications are hacked,
    then the safety of the child can come to risk. Smart Environment: Smart environment
    includes various IoT applications such as fire detection in forests, monitoring
    the level of snow in high altitude regions, preventing landslides, early detection
    of earthquakes, pollution monitoring, etc. All these IoT applications are closely
    related to the life of human beings and animals in those areas. The government
    agencies involved in such fields will also be relying on the information from
    these IoT applications. Security breaches and vulnerability in any area related
    to such IoT applications can have serious consequences. In this context, both
    false negatives and false positives can lead to disastrous results for such IoT
    applications. For example, if the application starts detecting earthquakes falsely,
    then it will lead to monetary losses for the government and businesses. On the
    other hand, if the application is not able to predict the earthquake, then it
    will lead to the loss of both property and life. Therefore, smart environment
    applications have to be highly precise, and security breaches and data tampering
    must be avoided. Smart Metering and Smart Grids: Smart metering includes applications
    related to various measurements, monitoring, and management. The most common application
    of smart metering is smart grids, where the electricity consumption is measured
    and monitored. Smart metering may also be used to address the problem of electricity
    theft [17]. Other applications of smart metering include monitoring of water,
    oil and gas levels in storage tanks and cisterns. Smart meters are also used to
    monitor and optimize the performance of solar energy plants by dynamically changing
    the angle of solar panels to harvest the maximum possible solar energy. There
    also exist some IoT applications that use smart meters to measure the water pressure
    in water transport systems or to measure the weight of goods. However, smart metering
    systems are vulnerable to both physical and cyber-attacks as compared to analog
    meters that can be tampered only by physical attacks. Also, smart meters or advanced
    metering infrastructure (AMI) are intended to perform functions beyond generic
    energy usage recording. In a smart home area network (HAN) all electric equipment
    at home are connected to smart meters and the information collected from these
    equipments can be used for load and cost management. Intentional intrusion in
    such communication systems by the consumer or an adversary may modify the collected
    information, leading to monetary loss for the service providers or consumers [18].
    Security and Emergencies: Security and emergencies is another important area where
    various IoT applications are being deployed. It includes applications such as
    allowing only authorized people in restricted areas etc. Another application in
    this domain is the detection of leakage of hazardous gases in industrial areas
    or areas around chemical factories. Radiation levels can also be measured in the
    areas around nuclear power reactors or cellular base stations and alerts can be
    generated when the radiation level is high. There are various buildings whose
    systems have sensitive data or that house sensitive goods. Security applications
    can be deployed to protect sensitive data and goods. IoT applications that detect
    various liquids can also be used to prevent corrosion and break downs in such
    sensitive buildings. Security breaches in such applications can also have various
    serious consequences. For example, the criminals may try to enter the restricted
    areas by attacking the vulnerabilities in such applications. Also, false radiation
    level alarms can have serious immediate and long term impacts. For example, if
    infants are exposed to high levels of radiation, then it may lead to serious life
    threatening diseases in long term. Smart Retail: IoT applications are being extensively
    used in the retail sector. Various applications have been developed to monitor
    the storage conditions of the goods as they move along the supply chain. IoT is
    also being used to control the tracking of products in the warehouses so that
    restocking can be done optimally. Various intelligent shopping applications are
    also being developed for assisting the customers based on their preferences, habits,
    allergies to certain components, etc. Mechanisms to provide the experience of
    online shopping to offline retailers using augmented reality techniques have also
    been developed. Various companies in retail have faced security issues in deploying
    and using various IoT applications. Some of these companies include Apple, Home
    Depot, JP Morgan Chase and Sony [19]. Adversaries may try to compromise the IoT
    applications associated with storage conditions of the goods and may try to send
    wrong information about the products to the users in order to increase the sale.
    If security features are not implemented in smart retail, attackers may steal
    debit and credit card information, phone numbers, email-addresses, etc. of the
    customers which can lead to monetary losses for the customers and retailers. Smart
    Agriculture and Animal Farming: Smart agriculture includes monitoring soil moisture,
    controlling micro-climate conditions, selective irrigation in dry zones, and controlling
    humidity and temperature. Usage of such advanced features in agriculture can help
    in achieving high yields and can save farmers from monetary losses. Control of
    temperature and humidity levels in various grain and vegetable production can
    help in preventing fungus and other microbial contaminants. Controlling the climate
    conditions can also help in increasing the vegetable and crop yield and quality.
    Just like crop monitoring, there are IoT applications to monitor the activities
    and the health condition of farm animals by attaching sensors to the animals.
    If such applications are compromised, then it may lead to the theft of animals
    from the farm and adversaries may also damage the crops. Home Automation: Home
    automation is one of the most widely used and deployed IoT applications. This
    includes applications such as those for remotely controlling electrical appliances
    to save energy, systems deployed on windows and doors to detect intruders, etc.
    Monitoring systems are being applied to track energy and water supply consumption,
    and users are being advised to save cost and resources. Authors in [20] have proposed
    the use of logic based security algorithms to enhance security level in homes.
    Intrusions are detected by comparing the user actions at key locations of the
    home with normal behavior of the user in these locations. However, attackers may
    gain unauthorized access of the IoT devices in the home and try to harm the users.
    For instance, cases of home burglaries have increased rapidly after the deployment
    of various home automation systems [20]. There have also been various cases in
    the past where the adversaries try to analyze the type and volume of Internet
    traffic to/from the smart home for judging the behavior and presence of the residents.
    SECTION III. Sources of Security Threats in IoT Applications As discussed in Section
    I, any IoT application can be divided into four layers: (1) sensing layer; (2)
    network layer; (3) middleware layer; and (4) application layer. Each of these
    layers in an IoT application uses diverse technologies that bring a number of
    issues and security threats. Figure 2 shows various technologies, devices, and
    applications at these four layers. This section discusses various possible security
    threats in IoT applications for these four layers. Figure 3 shows the possible
    attacks on these four layers. The special security issues associated with the
    gateways that connect these layers are also discussed in this section. FIGURE
    2. Layers in IoT system. Show All FIGURE 3. Types of attacks on IoT. Show All
    A. Security Issues at Sensing Layer The sensing layer mainly deals with physical
    IoT sensors and actuators. Sensors sense the physical phenomenon happening around
    them [21]–[23]. Actuators, on the other hand, perform a certain action on the
    physical environment, based on the sensed data. There are various kinds of sensors
    for sensing different kinds of data, e.g., ultrasonic sensors, camera sensors,
    smoke detection sensors, temperature and humidity sensors, etc. There can be mechanical,
    electrical, electronic or chemical sensors used to sense the physical environment.
    Various sensing layer technologies are used in different IoT applications like
    RFID, GPS, WSNs, RSNs, etc. Major security threats that can be encountered at
    the sensing layer are as follows: Node Capturing: IoT applications comprise of
    several low power nodes such as sensors and actuators. These nodes are vulnerable
    to a variety of attacks by the adversaries. The attackers may try to capture or
    replace the node in the IoT system with a malicious node. The new node may appear
    to be the part of the system but is controlled by the attacker. This may lead
    to compromising the security of the complete IoT application [24]. Malicious Code
    Injection Attack: The attack involves the attacker injecting some malicious code
    in the memory of the node. Generally, the firmware or software of IoT nodes are
    upgraded on the air, and this gives a gateway to the attackers to inject malicious
    code. Using such malicious code, the attackers may force the nodes to perform
    some unintended functions or may even try to access the complete IoT system. False
    Data Injection Attack: Once the node is captured, the attacker may use it to inject
    erroneous data onto the IoT system. This may lead to false results and may result
    in malfunctioning of the IoT application. The attacker may also use this method
    to cause a DDoS attack. Side-Channel Attacks (SCA): Apart from direct attacks
    on the nodes, various side-channel attacks may lead to leaking of sensitive data.
    The microarchitectures of processors, electromagnetic emanation and their power
    consumption reveal sensitive information to adversaries. Side channel attacks
    may be based on power consumption, laser-based attacks, timing attacks or electromagnetic
    attacks. Modern chips take care of various countermeasures to prevent these side-channel
    attacks while implementing the cryptographic modules. Eavesdropping and Interference:
    IoT applications often consist of various nodes deployed in open environments
    [25]. As a result, such IoT applications are exposed to eavesdroppers. The attackers
    may eavesdrop and capture the data during different phases like data transmission
    or authentication. Sleep Deprivation Attacks: In such type of attacks the adversaries
    try to drain the battery of the low-powered IoT edge devices. This leads to a
    denial of service from the nodes in the IoT application due to a dead battery.
    This can be done by running infinite loops in the edge devices using malicious
    code or by artificially increasing the power consumption of the edge devices.
    Booting Attacks: The edge devices are vulnerable to various attacks during the
    boot process. This is because the inbuilt security processes are not enabled at
    that point. The attackers may take advantage of this vulnerability and try to
    attack the node devices when they are being restarted. As edge devices are typically
    low powered and at times go through sleep-wake cycles, it is thus essential to
    secure the boot process in these devices. B. Security Issues at Network Layer
    The key function of the network layer is transmitting the information received
    from the sensing layer to the computational unit for processing. The major security
    issues that are encountered at the network layer are as follows. Phishing Site
    Attack: Phishing attacks often refer to attacks where several IoT devices can
    be targeted by a minimal effort put by the attacker. The attackers expect that
    at least few of the devices will become a victim of the attack. There is a possibility
    of encountering phishing sites in the course of users visiting web pages on the
    Internet. Once the user’s account and password are compromised, the whole IoT
    environment being used by the user becomes vulnerable to cyber attacks. The network
    layer in IoT is highly vulnerable to phishing sites attacks [26]. Access Attack:
    Access attack is also referred to as advanced persistent threat (APT). This is
    a type of attack in which an unauthorized person or an adversary gains access
    to the IoT network. The attacker can continue to stay in the network undetected
    for a long duration. The purpose or intention of this kind of attack is to steal
    valuable data or information, rather than to cause damage to the network. IoT
    applications continuously receive and transfer valuable data and are therefore
    highly vulnerable to such attacks [27]. DDoS/DoS Attack: In this kind of attacks,
    the attacker floods the target servers with a large number of unwanted requests.
    This incapacitates the target server, thereby disrupting services to genuine users.
    If there are multiple sources used by the attacker to flood the target server,
    then such an attack is termed as DDoS or distributed denial of service attack.
    Such attacks are not specific to IoT applications, but due to the heterogeneity
    and complexity of IoT networks, the network layer of the IoT is prone to such
    attacks. Many IoT devices in IoT applications are not strongly configured, and
    thus become easy gateways for attackers to launch DDoS attacks on the target servers.
    The Mirai botnet attack as discussed in Section I used this vulnerability and
    blocked various servers by constantly propagating requests to the weakly configured
    IoT devices [28]. Data Transit Attacks: IoT applications deal with a lot of data
    storage and exchange. Data is valuable, and therefore it is always the target
    of hackers and other adversaries. Data that is stored in the local servers or
    the cloud has a security risk, but the data that is in transit or is moving from
    one location to another is even more vulnerable to cyber attacks. In IoT applications,
    there is a lot of data movement between sensors, actuators, cloud, etc. Different
    connection technologies are used in such data movements, and therefore IoT applications
    are susceptible to data breaches. Routing Attacks: In such attacks, malicious
    nodes in an IoT application may try to redirect the routing paths during data
    transit. Sinkhole attacks are a specific kind of routing attack in which an adversary
    advertises an artificial shortest routing path and attracts nodes to route traffic
    through it. A worm-hole attack is another attack which can become serious security
    threat if combined with other attacks such as sinkhole attacks. A warm-hole is
    an out of band connection between two nodes for fast packet transfer. An attacker
    can create a warm-hole between a compromised node and a device on the internet
    and try to bypass the basic security protocols in an IoT application. C. Security
    Issues at Middleware Layer The role of the middleware in IoT is to create an abstraction
    layer between the network layer and the application layer. Middleware can also
    provide powerful computing and storage capabilities [29]. This layer provides
    APIs to fulfill the demands of the application layer. Middleware layer includes
    brokers, persistent data stores, queuing systems, machine learning, etc. Although
    the middleware layer is useful to provide a reliable and robust IoT application,
    it is also susceptible to various attacks. These attacks can take control of the
    entire IoT application by infecting the middleware. Database security and cloud
    security are other main security challenges in the middleware layer. Various possible
    attacks in the middleware layer are discussed as follows. Man-in-the-Middle Attack:
    The MQTT protocol uses publish-subscribe model of communication between clients
    and subscribers using the MQTT broker, which effectively acts as a proxy. This
    helps in decoupling the publishing and the subscribing clients from each other
    and messages can be sent without the knowledge of the destination. If the attacker
    can control the broker and become a man-in-the-middle, then he/she can get complete
    control of all communication without any knowledge of the clients. SQL Injection
    Attack: MIddleware is also susceptible to SQL Injection (SQLi) attacks. In such
    attacks, attacker can embed malicious SQL statements in a program [30], [31].
    Then, the attackers can obtain private data of any user and can even alter records
    in the database [32]. Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) has listed
    SQLi as a top threat to web security in their OWASP top 10 2018 document [33].
    Signature Wrapping Attack: In the web services used in the middleware, XML signatures
    are used [34]. In a signature wrapping attack, the attacker breaks the signature
    algorithm and can execute operations or modify eavesdropped message by exploiting
    vulnerabilities in SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) [35]. Cloud Malware Injection:
    In cloud malware injection, the attacker can obtain control, inject malicious
    code or can inject a virtual machine into the cloud. The attacker pretends to
    be a valid service by trying to create a virtual machine instance or a malicious
    service module. In this way, the attacker can obtain access to service requests
    of the victim’s service and can capture sensitive data which can be modified as
    per the instance. Flooding Attack in Cloud: This attack works almost the same
    as DoS attack in the cloud and affects the quality of service (QoS). For depleting
    cloud resources, the attackers continuously send multiple requests to a service.
    These attacks can have a big impact on cloud systems by increasing the load on
    the cloud servers. D. Security Issues at Gateways Gateway is a broad layer that
    has an important role in connecting multiple devices, people, things and cloud
    services. Gateways also help in providing hardware and software solutions for
    IoT devices. Gateways are used for decrypting and encrypting IoT data and translating
    protocols for communication between different layers [36]. IoT systems today are
    heterogeneous including LoraWan, ZigBee, Z-Wave and TCP/IP stacks with many gateways
    in between. Some of the security challenges for IoT gateway are discussed below.
    Secure On-boarding: When a new device or sensor is installed in an IoT system,
    it is imperative to protect encryption keys. Gateways act as an intermediary between
    the new devices and the managing services, and all the keys pass through the gateways.
    The gateways are susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks and eavesdropping to
    capture the encryption keys, especially during the on-boarding process. Extra
    Interfaces: Minimizing the attack surface is an important strategy that needs
    to be kept in mind while installing the IoT devices [37]. Only the necessary interfaces
    and protocols should be implemented by an IoT gateway manufacturer. Some of the
    services and functionalities should be restricted for end-users to avoid backdoor
    authentication or information breach. End-to-End Encryption: True end-to-end application
    layer security is required to ensure the confidentiality of the data [38]. The
    application should not let anyone other than the unique recipient to decrypt the
    encrypted messages. Although Zigbee and Zwave protocols support encryption, this
    is not end-to-end encryption, because, in order to translate the information from
    one protocol to another, the gateways are required to decrypt and re-encrypt the
    messages. This decryption at the gateway level makes the data susceptible to data
    breaches. Firmware updates: Most IoT devices are resource constrained, and therefore
    they do not have an user interface or the computation power to download and install
    the firmware updates. Generally, gateways are used to download and apply the firmware
    updates. The current and new version of the firmware should be recorded, and validity
    of the signatures should be checked for secure firmware updates. E. Security Issues
    at Application Layer The application layer directly deals with and provides services
    to the end users. IoT applications like smart homes, smart meters, smart cities,
    smart grids, etc. lie in this layer. This layer has specific security issues that
    are not present in other layers, such as data theft and privacy issues. The security
    issues in this layer are also specific to different applications. Many IoT applications
    also consist of a sub-layer between the network layer and application layer, usually
    termed as an application support layer or middleware layer. The support layer
    supports various business services and helps in intelligent resource allocation
    and computation. Major security issues encountered by the application layer are
    discussed below. Data Thefts: IoT applications deal with lot of critical and private
    data. The data in transit is even more vulnerable to attacks than data at rest,
    and in IoT applications, there is a lot of data movement. The users will be reluctant
    to register their private data on IoT applications if these applications are vulnerable
    to data theft attacks. Data encryption, data isolation, user and network authentication,
    privacy management, etc. are some of the techniques and protocols being used to
    secure IoT applications against data thefts. Access Control Attacks: Access control
    is authorization mechanism that allows only legitimate users or processes to access
    the data or account. Access control attack is a critical attack in IoT applications
    because once the access is compromised, then the complete IoT application becomes
    vulnerable to attacks. Service Interruption Attacks: These attacks are also referred
    to as illegal interruption attacks or DDoS attacks in existing literature. There
    have been various instances of such attacks on IoT applications. Such attacks
    deprive legitimate users from using the services of IoT applications by artificially
    making the servers or network too busy to respond. Malicious Code Injection Attacks:
    Attackers generally go for the easiest or simplest method they can use to break
    into a system or network. If the system is vulnerable to malicious scripts and
    misdirections due to insufficient code checks, then that would be the first entry
    point that an attacker would choose. Generally, attackers use XSS (cross-site
    scripting) to inject some malicious script into an otherwise trusted website.
    A successful XSS attack can result in the hijacking of an IoT account and can
    paralyze the IoT system. Sniffing Attacks: The attackers may use sniffer applications
    to monitor the network traffic in IoT applications. This may allow the attacker
    to gain access to confidential user data if there are not enough security protocols
    implemented to prevent it [39]. Reprogram Attacks: If the programming process
    is not protected, then the attackers can try to reprogram the IoT objects remotely.
    This may lead to the hijacking of the IoT network [40]. SECTION IV. Improvements
    and Enhancements Required for Upcoming IoT Applications Personal computers (PC)
    and smartphones have a number of security features built into them, e.g., firewalls,
    anti-virus softwares, address space randomization, etc. These safety shields are,
    in general, missing in various IoT devices that are already in the market. There
    are various security challenges that the IoT applications are facing currently.
    A well-defined framework and standard for an end-to-end IoT application is not
    yet available. An IoT application is not a standalone application, and it is an
    assembled product which includes work from many individuals and industries. At
    every layer starting from sensing to the application, several diverse products
    and technologies are being used. These include a large number of sensors and actuators
    at the edge nodes. There are multiple communication standards like cellular network,
    WiFi, IEEE 802.15.4, Insteon, dash7, Bluetooth, etc. A handshake mechanism is
    required between all these standards. Apart from this, various connectivity technologies
    are being used at different levels in the same IoT application like Zigbee, 6LOWPAN,
    wireless HART, Z-Wave, ISA100, Bluetooth, NFC, RFID, etc. Over and above this,
    the generic HTTP protocol cannot be used in the application layer. HTTP is not
    suitable for resource-constrained environments because it is heavy-weight and
    thus incurs a large parsing overhead. Therefore, at the application layer also
    there are many alternate protocols that have been deployed for IoT environments.
    Some of them are MQTT, SMQTT, CoAP, XMPP, AMQP, M3DA, JavascriptIoT, etc. Due
    to the intense diversity of protocols, technologies, and devices in an IoT application,
    the significant trade-offs are between cost effectiveness, security, reliability,
    privacy, coverage, latency, etc. If one metric for improvement is optimized, it
    may result in the degradation of other metric. For example, imposing too many
    security checks and protocols in all data transactions in IoT applications may
    end up increasing the cost and latency of the application, thereby, making it
    unsuitable for the users. A typical IoT application consists of a big chain of
    connected devices, technologies, domains, and geographies. Even if one of the
    device or technology or their combination is left weak, then that may be the cause
    of a security threat for the entire application. The chain is considered to be
    as strong as the weakest link. There has been a large increase in the number of
    weak links in IoT applications recently. For example, even basic IoT applications
    such as smart bulbs and smart door locks can be used as a weak link in a smart
    home IoT application to extract the user’s WiFi password [41] and [42]. The large
    number of IoT devices being deployed around the world to make it smart generates
    a large amount of environment and user-related data. A lot of private information
    can be inferred from this data, and that can be another cause of threat for an
    individual and society at large [7]. As a result, significant improvements and
    enhancements in the current IoT application structure and framework are required
    to make it reliable, secure and robust. In this regard: Rigorous penetration testing
    for IoT devices is necessary to quantify the level of risk involved in deploying
    these devices in different applications. Based on the risk involved, a priority
    list can be made and the devices can be deployed appropriately in different applications.
    Encryption techniques are being used in IoT system at different layers and protocols.
    However, there are various levels of encrypt, decrypt, and re-encrypt cycles in
    the complete system. These cycles make the system vulnerable to attacks. End to
    end encryption would be a promising solution to prevent different attacks. Authenticate-always
    protocols need to be implemented. Whenever a device wants to interact with another
    device, an authentication process should be implemented. Digital certificates
    can be a promising solution to provide seamless authentication with bound identities
    that are tied to cryptographic protocols. Any IoT security framework being implemented
    should be tested and confirmed for scalability. The security protocols should
    not be working only for a limited set of users. The real threats start coming
    only when the application becomes public and starts being used widely in the public
    domain. Therefore, proper strategy and planning are required. A mechanism based
    on encryption techniques like RSA, SHA256, or hash chains is required to secure
    the user and environment data from being captured. IoT devices need to be designed
    in a way that they can transmit the sensed data in a secure and encrypted way.
    This will help in gaining the trust of the individuals, government agencies and
    industries in IoT applications. Since the IoT devices and applications are growing
    rapidly, an approach needs to be designed to handle the cost and capacity constraints
    that are expected to be encountered shortly. A paradigm shift from a centralized
    approach to some decentralized approach might be needed, where devices can automatically
    and securely communicate with each other. This can help in reducing the cost of
    managing the applications and can reduce the issues of capacity constraints [43].
    Since most of the IoT applications use cloud services for data storage and retrieval,
    the risks caused by the cloud should also be considered. Cloud is a public platform
    used by multiple users and there may be malicious users on the cloud who can be
    the cause of threat for IoT related data. The data should be stored as ciphertext
    in the cloud and the cloud should not be allowed to decrypt any ciphertext. This
    can further enhance data security and can save us from the generic risks of using
    cloud services [44]. Apart from the challenges from outside entities, there are
    various scenarios where the sensors in an IoT application start collecting or
    sending erroneous data. These errors might be easy to handle in case of a centralized
    architecture but can become a bottleneck in case of an autonomous decentralized
    architecture. Faulty reading or transmitting of data can lead to undesirable results.
    Thus, mechanism needs to be identified to validate the data flow, especially in
    case of a distributed architecture [45]. Since the ultimate goal of all IoT applications
    is to create an autonomous system that needs minimum human interventions, the
    use of some artificial intelligence (AI) based techniques or algorithms to secure
    IoT devices might be useful. This can help in reducing the analysis and communication
    load on IoT environment [46]. There are various techniques and approaches in the
    existing literature for securing IoT environments and applications. These solutions
    may be divided into four categories: (1) blockchain based solutions; (2) fog computing
    based solutions; (3) machine learning based solutions and (4) edge computing based
    solutions. Figure 4 shows various works in different domains that have used the
    above-mentioned solutions for securing the IoT environments [47]–[97]. In the
    following sections, these solutions are described in detail. FIGURE 4. Research
    papers addressing IoT security using various security techniques. Show All SECTION
    V. IoT Security Using Blockchain Blockchain and IoT are important technologies
    that will have a high impact on the IT and communication industry. These two technologies
    focus on improving the overall transparency, visibility, level of comfort and
    level of trust for the users. The IoT devices provide real-time data from sensors
    and blockchain provides the key for data security using a distributed, decentralized
    and shared ledger [108]. The basic idea behind the blockchain is simple: it is
    a distributed ledger (also called replicated log files). The entries in the blockchain
    are chronological and time-stamped. Each entry in the ledger is tightly coupled
    with the previous entry using cryptographic hash keys. A Merkle tree is used to
    store the individual transactions and the root hash of the tree is stored in the
    blockchain. In the figure, T1,T2,T3,⋯,Tn represent the individual transactions.
    The transactions are cryptographically hashed and stored on the leaf nodes of
    the tree as Ha,Hb,Hc and so on. The hash of the child nodes are concatenated and
    a new root hash is generated. The final root hash (e.g., H1 and H2 ) is stored
    on the blockchain. Just the root hash can be verified in order to make sure that
    all the transactions associated with that root hash are secure and have not been
    tampered with. Even if a single transaction is changed, all the hash values on
    that particular side of the tree will change. The ledger maintainer or the miner
    verifies the logs or transactions and generates a key that enables the latest
    transaction to become the part of complete ledger. This process makes the latest
    entries available to all the nodes in the network. Due to the presence of cryptographic
    hash keys in each block, it is too time-consuming and difficult for the adversaries
    to tamper with the blocks [109]. The miners do not have any personal interest
    in the transactions, and they are mining just to earn their incentives. The miners
    do not know the identity of the owners of the transactions. Over and above, there
    are multiple miners working on the same set of transactions, and there is a strong
    competition between them to add the transactions to the blockchain. All these
    unique features empower the blockchain to be a strong, tamper-proof, distributed
    and open data structure for IoT data [110]. Figure 5 shows the complete flow of
    a transaction from being initialized to being committed to the distributed chain.
    There are various platforms and frameworks being developed in academia and industry
    that support the creation and maintenance of blockchain. Some examples of such
    platforms are Ethereum, Hyperledger fabric, Ripple, etc. [111]. FIGURE 5. Working
    process of blockchain. Show All A. Permissioned and Permission-Less Blockchain
    There are two types of blockchain architectures based on the type of data being
    added and the nature of application using blockchain. In permission-less blockchain,
    there is no specific permission required for a user to become the part of the
    blockchain network or to become a miner. Anyone can join or leave this network
    of permission-less blockchain. The best example of permission-less blockchains
    is Bitcoin. Although the throughput of transactions is not very high, the permission-less
    blockchains can support a large number of nodes in the network. On the other hand,
    the permissioned blockchains have a defined set of rules to participate in the
    blockchain network. The miners are also the authorized persons and the blocks
    are allowed to be added to the chain only after their validation. The blockchain
    of Ripple and Hyperledger are two prime examples of permissioned blockchain. The
    permissioned concept of blockchain improves the overall throughput of transactions
    as compared to permission-less blockchains. Figure 6 shows the sample architecture
    of a blockchain and the way every block is connected to all the previous blocks
    based on cryptographic hashing. FIGURE 6. Basic blockchain architecture. Show
    All B. Benefits of Blockchain in IoT The usage of blockchain has many advantages
    in IoT applications. Table 4 gives a summary of some specific challenges in IoT
    security and their possible solutions using blockchain. Various security issues
    faced by IoT applications have already been discussed in Section III. The key
    benefits of using blockchain in IoT applications are discussed below. Data coming
    from IoT devices can be stored in Blockchain: The IoT applications include a large
    variety of devices connected to each other. These devices are further connected
    and controlled by other devices. This setup is further connected to the cloud
    to enable IoT applications to be used from any location. Due to this large space
    for data movement, blockchain is a promising solution to store the data and prevent
    it from being misused. Irrespective of the layer in an IoT application, blockchain
    can act as a suitable solution to store and transmit data. Distributed nature
    of blockchain allowing secure data storage: Since the blockchain architecture
    is distributed in nature, it can avoid the risk of being a single point of failure
    as is faced by various IoT applications based on the cloud. Irrespective of the
    distance between the devices, the data generated by them can be easily stored
    on the blockchain in a secure manner [112]. Data encryption using the hash key
    and verified by miners: In blockchain, only the 256-bit hash key for the data
    can be stored, rather than storing the actual data. The actual data can be stored
    on the cloud and the hash key can be mapped with the original data. If there is
    any change in the data, the hash of the data will change. This makes the data
    secure and private. The size of blockchain will also not get affected by the size
    of the data as only the hash values are stored in the chain. Only the intended
    parties, who are authorized to use that data can access the data from the cloud
    using the hash of the data. Every set of data being stored on blockchain is properly
    verified by different miners in the network, and therefore the probability of
    storing corrupt data from the devices reduces by using blockchain as a solution.
    Prevention from data loss and spoofing attacks: In spoofing attacks on IoT applications,
    a new adversary node enters into the IoT network and starts imitating to be the
    part of the original network. By spoofing, the adversary can easily capture, observe
    or inject data in the network. Blockchain acts as a promising solution to prevent
    such attacks. Each legitimate user or device is registered on blockchain, and
    devices can easily identify and authenticate each other without the need for central
    brokers or certification authorities [113]. Being low powered in nature, IoT devices
    inherit the risk of losing data. There might be cases where due to some external
    environmental issues the data is lost by both the sender and the receiver. Use
    of blockchain can prevent such losses as once the block is added in the chain
    there is no way to remove it [114]. Blockchain to prevent unauthorized access:
    Many IoT applications involve a lot of frequent communication between various
    nodes. The communication in blockchain takes place using the public and private
    keys, and therefore only the intended party or node can access the data. Even
    if the unintended party is able to access the data, the contents of the data will
    be incomprehensible as the data is encrypted with keys. Therefore, the blockchain
    data structure tries to handle various security issues faced by IoT applications.
    Proxy-based architecture in blockchain for resource-constrained devices: Although
    blockchain provides various security features for a distributed environment, IoT
    has a specific challenge of resource constraints. Being highly resource-constrained,
    IoT devices cannot store large ledgers. There have been various works in this
    direction to facilitate the use of blockchain in IoT. Proxy-based architecture
    is one of the promising solutions that can help IoT devices to use blockchain.
    Proxy servers can be deployed in the network, to store the resources in an encrypted
    form. The encrypted resources can be downloaded by the client from the proxy servers
    [115]. Elimination of centralized cloud servers: Blockchain can enhance the security
    of IoT systems because it ultimately eliminates the centralized cloud servers
    and makes the network peer-to-peer. Centralized cloud servers are the prime target
    of the data thieves. Using blockchain, the data will be distributed among all
    the nodes of the network and will be encrypted using a cryptographic hash function.
    TABLE 4 Challenges in IoT and Possible Blockchain Solution C. Merkle Tree Merkle
    tree is an add-on that can be added to the blockchain data structure to enhance
    the security of IoT devices. This can also help in reducing the overall number
    of blocks being added in the chain. A Merkle tree is like a binary tree where
    every node contains two child nodes except the leaf nodes. The leaf nodes contain
    the data or transactions, and the roots are the hash values of the data on the
    leaf nodes [116]. Based on the size of the tree, multiple transactions can be
    combined to generate a single root hash. Rather than treating each transaction
    as a block, each root hash can be considered as a block in the chain. This can
    help us in reducing the number of blocks. Also, due to multiple levels of hashing,
    at every level in the tree, the security of the data is enhanced [117]. IoT devices
    involve a lot of small communications among each other and therefore using Merkle
    tree along with blockchain can be a promising solution [118]. D. IOTA IOTA is
    another upcoming and highly promising solution to secure IoT. IOTA is also a DLT
    (Distributed Ledger Technology) as blockchain. IOTA is specially designed for
    resource-constrained IoT devices. Every incoming request in the network is required
    to validate the previous two requests. Using this process of cumulative validations,
    IOTA can provide a high level of security at the device or edge level. The tip
    selection algorithm is used for request verification. A cumulative weight is created
    for all requests. Higher the weight of a device in the network, more secure the
    device is. IOTA uses a tangle data structure as compared to the chain data structure
    in blockchain [119]. SECTION VI. IoT Security Using Fog Computing A. Evolution
    of Fog From Cloud IoT and cloud computing are two independent technologies which
    have many applications. IoT has provided users with a large number of smart devices
    and applications. Similarly, a cloud provides a very effective solution to store
    and manage data which can be accessed from anywhere and is widely used by many
    organizations. IoT is generating an unprecedented amount of data, which puts a
    lot of strain on the Internet infrastructure. The integration of cloud and IoT
    has introduced an era of new opportunities and challenges for processing, storing,
    managing and securing data more effectively. Industry and research groups have
    tried to solve some issues faced by the IoT by integrating it with the cloud.
    The benefits of this integration are not enough to address all the issues faced
    by IoT. Therefore, the concept of fog computing was introduced by Cisco in 2012.
    Fog computing complements cloud computing rather than replacing it. B. Fog Computing
    Architecture The main task of fog computing is to handle the data generated by
    IoT devices locally for better management and thus requires an architecture consisting
    of different layers. It has two frameworks that are Fog-Device framework and Fog-Cloud-Device
    framework [120]. The former framework consists of device and fog layer and the
    latter framework consists of device, fog and cloud layer. The arrangement of layers
    is done based on their storing and computational powers. The communication between
    different layers is done using wired (e.g., optical fiber, Ethernet) or wireless
    communication (e.g., WiFi, Bluetooth, etc.). In Fog-Device framework, the fog
    nodes provide various services to a user without involving cloud servers. However,
    in Fog-Cloud-Device framework the simple decisions are taken at the fog layer,
    whereas, the complex decisions are taken on cloud [121]. The architecture of Fog-Cloud-Device
    framework is shown in Figure 7. The authors of [122] have considered the fog computing
    architecture theoretically and mathematically while comparing the performance
    of fog computing paradigm with traditional cloud computing framework based on
    service latency and energy consumption. Fog computing reduces the data traffic
    between cloud and network edge by 90% and average response time for a user by
    20% when compared with cloud-only model [123]. Authors in [124] have discussed
    the definition and concept of fog computing in-depth, comparing it with similar
    concepts such as mobile-edge computing (MEC) and mobile cloud computing (MCC).
    Authors in [124] have also introduced some applications like real-time video analytics
    and augmented reality (AR), mobile big data analytics, and content delivery and
    caching for fog computing. FIGURE 7. Fog computing architecture. Show All C. Advantages
    of Fog Over Cloud IoT devices generate large volumes of data every day. Moving
    this data to the cloud in real-time for analysis is not feasible. Therefore, the
    concept of fog computing has been developed. Figure 7 shows the placement and
    functionality of fog layer in an IoT application. Fog computing refers to extending
    cloud computing and its services to the edge of the network. Fog computing is
    a decentralized infrastructure for analysis of data and computing and can be used
    to store and process time-sensitive data efficiently and quickly. Its main goal
    is to enhance security, prevent data thefts, minimize the data stored on the cloud
    and to increase the overall efficiency of IoT applications. The latency in fog
    computation is less than cloud computation because the fog layer is placed much
    closer to the devices than the cloud. Only the selected and important data is
    sent to the cloud for long-term storage. Fog computing applications include smart
    vehicles, smart homes, smart agriculture, health-care, smart traffic lights, smart
    retail, software-defined networks, etc. Sending the immense amount of data generated
    by IoT devices to the cloud for processing and analyzing would be costly and time-consuming.
    Along with minimizing network bandwidth requirements, fog computing also reduces
    the frequency of two-way communication between IoT devices and the cloud [125].
    In fog architecture, the data is collected at devices called fog nodes which can
    analyze 40 percent of it [126]. It offloads traffic from the core network minimizing
    the latency of IoT devices. A fog node can be any device like a router, switch,
    or a video surveillance camera which has computing, storage, and network connectivity.
    These fog nodes can be installed anywhere like on a factory floor or in a vehicle,
    provided it has a network connection. Data is directed to the fog node, aggregation
    node or cloud based on its time-sensitivity. Fog nodes make the communication
    in IoT application secure by providing cryptographic computations. Mere sensors
    and IoT devices do not always have the necessary inbuilt resources for that purpose
    [127]. D. Solutions Provided by Fog Computing to Overcome IoT Security Threats
    In regard to the attacks discussed in Section III, the solution that fog computing
    provides or can provide to overcome those security threats are discussed below.
    Man-in-the-middle attack: Fog acts as a security layer between end-user and cloud
    or IoT system. All threats or attacks on the IoT systems need to pass through
    the fog layer in between, and this layer can identify and mitigate unusual activities
    before they are passed to the system. Data transit attacks: Data storage and management
    is much better if performed on the secure fog nodes, as compared to the IoT devices.
    Data will be better protected if it is stored on the fog nodes as compared to
    storing the data on the end-user devices. Fog nodes also help in making the user
    data more available. Eavesdropping: Using fog nodes, the communication takes place
    between the end-user and the fog node only, rather than routing the information
    through the entire network. The chances of an adversary trying to eavesdrop reduces
    a lot because the traffic on the network is reduced. Resource-constraint issues:
    Most of the IoT devices are resource constrained and the attackers take advantage
    of this fact. They try to damage the edge devices and use them as the weak links
    to enter the system. Fog nodes can support the edge devices and can prevent them
    from being affected by such attacks. A nearby fog node can perform the more sophisticated
    security functions necessary for protection. Incident response services: Fog nodes
    can be programmed to provide real-time incident response services. Fog nodes can
    generate a flag to the IoT system or the end users as soon as they encounter a
    suspicious data or request. Fog computing allows for malware detection and problem
    resolution in transit. In many critical applications, it might not be possible
    to stop the entire system to resolve malware incidences. Fog nodes can help in
    such resolutions while the system is up and running. E. Security Challenges and
    Solutions in Fog Layer Although fog layer provides various features and security
    aspects for IoT applications, the movement of data and computation to fog layer
    creates new vulnerabilities [120]. Therefore, before implementing fog-assisted
    IoT applications, these security and privacy goals of fog computing are required
    to be studied. In this section, various features provided by fog layer, privacy
    and security challenges faced, and proposed solutions to overcome them are discussed.
    Table 5 summarizes these issues and proposed solutions. Real-Time Services: Fog
    computing tends to provide a near real-time service in the IoT systems by performing
    computation near the data generation points. Intrusion detection: Policy violations
    and malicious activities on fog nodes and IoT devices will not be discovered if
    no proper intrusion detection mechanism is implemented. The attacks might not
    impact the whole architecture of fog computing, but the attacker can control the
    local services. Attacks targeting local services can be detected by fog nodes
    by collaborating with their adjacent nodes. By observing program behavior and
    host file systems, the attack on the cloud can be detected [163]. Identity authentication:
    There are various entities involved in the process of offering and accessing real-time
    services like fog nodes, service providers and users. Trusting all the entities
    involved is an arduous task, and creates security challenges for IoT services
    and user’s data. Accessibility of services should be given only to authentic and
    credible users; otherwise, attackers may compromise the server and exploit services
    and user privacy. Therefore, to prevent attackers from illegitimately accessing
    services, identity authentication mechanisms are needed. To provide secure services,
    some efficient identity authentication mechanisms have been proposed in the past
    [146]–[149], [164], [165]. Transient Storage: Users can store and maintain their
    data on fog nodes temporarily with the help of transient storage. On the one hand,
    it helps in managing data easily on local storage, but on the other hand, it creates
    new challenges and security issues, especially for maintaining data privacy. Identifying
    and protecting sensitive data: Data stored in IoT devices may include social events,
    traffic conditions, personal activities, temperature and so on. Some of the data
    might be personal or sensitive while some data may be made public. Furthermore,
    for different users, the same data has different security levels. Therefore, it
    is important to identify and protect the sensitive data from the large volume
    of information. Sharing data securely: To provide security, data uploaded on fog
    nodes is first encrypted. No one other than its owner can read that data once
    it is encrypted. This creates a problem for data sharing. To overcome this challenge,
    some cryptographic techniques such as key-aggregate encryption, proxy re-encryption,
    and attribute-sharing, have been proposed in [166]. Data Dissemination: The data
    cannot be transferred to the fog node without encryption, due to security issues.
    Due to this movement of encrypted data to the fog node, many desirable features
    are sacrificed such as sharing, searching, and aggregation. Searching data securely:
    As discussed in transient storage, data is encrypted before uploading. However,
    once it is encrypted, searching or retrieving on the ciphertext becomes difficult
    for owners as well as other entities. In order to retrieve the information from
    encrypted text, search-able encryption and its privacy levels are defined in [145].
    A dynamic symmetric search-able scheme is introduced in [167]. Data aggregation:
    Fog nodes might need to aggregate the data in certain cases to prevent data leakage
    and reduce communication overhead. It is important to develop secure aggregation
    algorithms to prevent data thefts. Various homomorphic encryption schemes, such
    as BGN encryption [168] and Paillier encryption [169], have been proposed to achieve
    secure data aggregation. Decentralized Computation: The data stored on the fog
    nodes can be processed and analyzed for better results. However, such computations
    have several threats and risks associated with them. For example, attackers can
    not only control the analyzed results, but can also expose processed data. Server-aided
    computation: Tasks which cannot be executed by IoT devices themselves are computed
    with the help of fog nodes. However, this can lead to exposure of data to attackers,
    if the fog nodes which received data from IoT are already compromised. Server-aided
    computation is one such method whose aim is to provide secure computation [131].
    Verifiable computation: Users rely on the fog nodes to compute their data. There
    must be a secure mechanism to verify the computation results coming from the fog
    node. Authors in [170], [171] have proposed certain multi-user mechanisms that
    help with verifiable computation. TABLE 5 Characteristics and Solutions Provided
    by Fog Computing SECTION VII. IoT Security Using Machine Learning The area of
    machine learning (ML) has attracted significant interest over recent years. Many
    domains are using ML for their development, and it is being used for IoT security
    as well. ML appears to be a promising solution to protect IoT devices against
    cyber attacks by providing a different approach for defending against attacks
    as compared to other traditional methods. A. Solutions Provided by ML to Overcome
    Security Threats In regard to the attacks discussed in Section III, the solutions
    provided by ML to overcome these security threats are discussed below. DoS Attack:
    DoS attacks on IoT devices or originating from IoT devices are a serious concern.
    One approach to prevent such attacks is to use a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
    based protocol that secures networks against DoS attacks [172]. The authors of
    [173] have proposed a particle swarm optimization and back propagation algorithm
    to train a MLP that helps in enhancing the security of wireless networks. ML techniques
    help in increasing the deduction accuracy and securing IoT devices vulnerable
    to DoS attacks. Eavesdropping: Attackers may eavesdrop on messages during data
    transmission. To provide protection from such attacks, ML techniques such as Q-learning
    based offloading strategy [174] or non-parametric Bayesian techniques [175] can
    be used. Schemes such as Q-learning and Dyna-Q are ML techniques that may also
    be used to protect devices from eavesdropping. Evaluation of these schemes via
    experiments and reinforcement learning is presented in [176]. Spoofing: Attacks
    from spoofers can be avoided by using Q-learning [176], Dyna-Q [176], Support
    Vector Machines (SVM) [177], Deep Neural Network (DNN) model [178], incremental
    aggregated gradient (IAG) [46], and distributed FrankWolfe (dFW) [179] techniques.
    These techniques not only increase the detection accuracy and classification accuracy
    but also help in reducing the average error rate and false alarm rate. Privacy
    Leakage: Collection of personal information such as health data, location, or
    photos puts the user’s privacy at stake. Privacy-preserving scientific computations
    (PPSC) [180] should be employed for preventing privacy leakage. A commodity integrity
    detection algorithm (CIDA) which is based on the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT)
    is another technique that has been proposed to develop IoT application trust [181].
    Digital Fingerprinting: Digital fingerprinting is one of the upcoming and promising
    solutions to secure IoT systems and to help the end users gain sufficient trust
    in the applications. Fingerprints are being widely used to unlock smartphones,
    approve payments, unlock the car and home doors, etc. Due to its low cost, reliability,
    acceptability and high-security level, digital fingerprinting is emerging as a
    dominant bio-metric identification method [182]. Apart from the benefits of digital
    fingerprinting, there are various challenges to efficiently use this technique
    in IoT, such as fingerprint classification, image enhancement, feature matching,
    etc. Various machine learning based algorithms have been developed to provide
    some non-traditional solutions to overcome these challenges [183], some of which
    are discussed below. Support Vector Machine: SVM is a training algorithm for non-linear
    and linear classifications, principal component analysis, text categorization,
    speaker identification, and regression. It maximizes the gap between the decision
    boundary and training patterns. Authors of [184] have discussed the use of SVM
    in digital fingerprinting in detail. They have also compared it with other traditional
    models. A feature vector is built based on pixel values of the fingerprint, and
    it is used to train the SVM. Various patterns behind the fingerprint are analyzed,
    and then the matching of a fingerprint is done based on patterns identified. Artificial
    Neural Networks: ANN is one of the most commonly used algorithms in the machine
    learning. It offers many advantages like fault tolerance, adaptive learning, and
    generalization. In [185] a framework has been proposed for using ANN to identify
    fingerprints digitally. The digital values of various features in the fingerprint
    like minutiae, ridge ending, and bifurcation is applied as the input to the neural
    network for training purpose using back propagation algorithm of ANN. The verification
    of the fingerprint is done based on the previous experiential values stored in
    the database. The fundamental need in IoT is to secure all the systems and devices
    that are connected to the network. The role of ML is to use and train algorithms
    to detect anomalies in IoT devices or to detect any unwanted activity taking place
    in IoT system to prevent data loss or other issues. Therefore, ML provides a promising
    platform to overcome the difficulties faced in securing IoT devices. Further contributions
    in this field are required to maintain the growth of IoT. SECTION VIII. IoT Security
    Using Edge Computing Edge and fog computing are both extensions of cloud computing
    which is widely used by various organizations. Cloud, fog and edge may appear
    similar but they constitute different layers of IoT applications. The main difference
    between cloud, fog and edge computing is the location of intelligence and power
    computation. The cloud is deployed at a much larger scale that needs to process
    huge amount of data and is situated at comparatively more distance from its users
    [186]. To overcome the problems faced by cloud computing, edge computing is used
    as a solution where a small edge server is placed between the user and the cloud/fog.
    Some processing activity is performed at the edge server, rather than the cloud.
    Edge computing architecture consists of edge devices, cloud server and fog nodes
    as shown in Figure 8 [187]. FIGURE 8. Edge computing architecture. Show All In
    an edge computing framework the computation and analysis power is provided at
    the edge itself. The devices in an application can create a network among themselves
    and can cooperate among each other to compute the data [63]. Consequently, a lot
    of data can be saved from going outside the device, either to cloud or to fog
    nodes, and this can enhance the security of the IoT application. Edge computing
    also helps in providing low communication cost by preventing the need of moving
    all the data to the cloud [66]. A. Using Edge Computing to Secure and Improve
    IoT In regard to the attacks discussed in Section III, the solutions that edge
    computing provides or can provide to overcome these security threats are discussed
    below. Data Breaches: In edge computing, all the data is stored and processed
    within the device or local network. There is no movement of the data from the
    data originator to the processor. This prevents the data from being in transit
    and thereby prevents the risk of data thefts and data breaches. In fog computing
    there is some movement of data from a device to fog layer and adversaries can
    take advantage of this movement [188]. Data Compliance Issues: Many countries
    have strict regulatory acts to prevent data movement outside their boundaries,
    e.g., European Union’s GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). Using edge computing,
    organizations can keep the data within their borders and ensure compliance with
    data sovereignity laws [189]. Safety Issues: With the increase in the deployment
    of cyber-physical systems, security and safety are considered as integral issues.
    If there is even a little delay in responses, then that may lead to physical safety
    issues. For example, if the sensors in a car predict that a crash is about to
    happen, then the airbags have to be deployed immediately. If the sensors completely
    rely on sending all the data to the cloud and waiting for the response from the
    cloud to perform any action, then that may be too late to prevent injuries or
    loss of life. Surveillance cameras can also be empowered using edge computing
    and they can themselves analyze the anomalies and can send the summarized and
    suspected data to the data centers to achieve faster response times. Bandwidth
    Issues: IoT application generate a lot of data at very high rate. Most of this
    data is raw and of relatively low-value. Sending all the data to the cloud involves
    a lot of bandwidth cost as well, along with the security challenges of data movement.
    If edge computing is used, then a lot of data cleaning and aggregation can be
    done at the edge nodes and only the summarized data, if required, needs to be
    sent to the cloud [190]. B. Challenges in Edge Layer Although edge computing provides
    various features to increase the security and performance of IoT applications,
    there are various challenges associate with completely relying on the edge layer
    for all computation. Edge devices include sensors, RFID devices, actuators, tags,
    and embedded devices. The edge layer is highly susceptible to attacks in an IoT
    system. If the edge layer is compromised, then the entire system may be compromised.
    MQTT and COAP are the most popular protocols for the edge layer. Both these protocols
    do not use any security layer by default. Although the option to add an optional
    security layer in the form of TLS for MQTT and DTLS for COAP is present, it creates
    additional overhead in terms of processing and bandwidth. Issues specific to edge
    devices include sleep deprivation attacks, battery draining attacks, and outage
    attacks. Edge devices are typically resource constrained, and the most important
    resource they rely upon is the battery backup. The foremost and easiest way to
    attack the edge devices is to somehow deplete the battery of an edge device. For
    example, an attacker might force the edge device to do some power hungry or infinite
    loop computation [191]. The process of striking a balance between storing and
    processing data on edge or cloud is very important. Keeping too much data on edge
    may also lead to overwhelming of the edge devices and may impact the entire application.
    SECTION IX. Open Issues, Challenges, and Future Research Directions There are
    some performance and security issues in the use of blockchain, fog computing,
    edge computing and machine learning for IoT security that are yet to be solved.
    This section discusses some of these issues. The security of blockchain depends
    on its method of implementation and the use of software and hardware in that implementation.
    Since all the transactions made by users in blockchain are public, there is a
    possibility that private information of users can be revealed. Also, as the number
    of miners increases, the size of blockchain also increases continuously. This
    increases the cost of storage and reduces the speed of distribution over the whole
    network, giving rise to issues like scalability and availability of blockchain
    [192]. Since fog computing is a nontrivial extension of cloud computing, some
    of the issues such as security and privacy will continue to persist [120]. Therefore,
    before implementing fog-assisted IoT applications, these security and privacy
    goals of fog computing are required to be studied. Some of the challenges and
    research issues on security and privacy in IoT environments and the solutions
    provided by fog computing are discussed in [127]. There are many machine learning
    algorithms in existence. Therefore, it is imperative to select a proper algorithm
    suitable for the application. Selecting a wrong algorithm would result in producing
    “garbage” output and will lead to loss of effort, effectiveness and accuracy.
    Similarly, choosing the wrong data set will lead to “garbage” input producing
    incorrect results. The success of a machine learning solution depends on these
    factors as well as diversity in selecting data. If the data is not clustered and
    classified, the prediction accuracy will be lower. Also, the historical data may
    contain many ambiguous values, outliers, missing values, and meaningless data.
    IoT applications are creating a huge amount of data, and therefore it is a difficult
    task to clean and preprocess that data accurately. Various features like attribute
    creation, linear regression, multiple regression, removing redundancies and compressing
    data are required to effectively use machine learning for securing the IoT. In
    case of edge computing, data security and user privacy are the main concerns.
    An user’s private data can be leaked and misused if a house that is deployed with
    IoT devices is subjected to cyber attacks. For example, a person’s presence or
    absence at home can be revealed simply by observing the electricity or water usage
    data. Since the data is computed at the edge of data resource (e.g., home), therefore,
    the user has to be aware of some of the measures like securing WiFi connections.
    Secondly, data at edge should be owned fully by the user, and he/she should have
    control on which data to be shared. Some of the future research directions in
    this field are: The edge devices are most resource constrained devices in the
    IoT and are therefore uniquely vulnerable to attacks. Penetration studies show
    that while it takes very little power to implement best practice security for
    the edge nodes, they are still highly vulnerable to a variety of malicious attacks.
    The gateways between different layers in the IoT system need to be secured. Gateways
    provide an easy entry point for the attackers into the IoT system. End to end
    encryption, rather than specific encryption techniques for specific protocols
    would be a promising solution to secure the data passing through the gateways.
    The data should be decrypted only at the intended destination and not at the gateways
    for protocol translation. Inter-fog sharing of resources is one of the areas where
    further work needs to be done. As of now, when the fog layer is unable to process
    the requests due to heavy load, the requests are forwarded to the cloud. There
    can be resource sharing between neighboring fog layers to prevent unwanted requests
    to be transferred to the cloud. The current blockchain architecture is highly
    limited in terms of the number of nodes in permissioned networks and in terms
    of throughput in permissionless networks. Various consensus algorithms are being
    designed to support high throughput along with a large number of nodes or users.
    Fog layer can be made more intelligent using various ML and AI techniques. Fog
    layer must be able to decide the duration for which the data in the fog should
    be retained and when the data should be discarded or shifted to the cloud for
    prolonged storage. More efficient and reliable consensus mechanisms can be designed
    to reach consensus among the nodes along with preventing rampant use of computation
    power. The current consensus algorithms are highly resource hungry and less efficient.
    The tamper-proof feature of blockchain is ending up into a collection of a lot
    of garbage data and addresses. There is a lot of invalid data that is never deleted
    like the addresses of the destructed smart contracts. This affects the performance
    of the overall application and better ways need to be designed to efficiently
    handle the garbage data in the blockchain. Data analysis in near real-time and
    in the proximity of the IoT node is crucial for successful deployment of IoT applications.
    Various ML-based algorithms can be designed to analyze the data in the node itself
    to prevent the data transit for analysis. This can further enhance the security
    of the application by preventing data movement. SECTION X. Conclusion In this
    survey, we have presented various security threats at different layers of an IoT
    application. We have covered the issues related to the sensing layer, network
    layer, middleware layer, gateways, and application layer. We have also discussed

    rights and content Precision Agriculture (PA), as the integration of information,
    communication and control technologies in agriculture, is growing day by day.
    The Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing paradigms offer advances to enhance
    PA connectivity. Nevertheless, their usage in this field is usually limited to
    specific scenarios of high cost, and they are not adapted to semi-arid conditions,
    or do not cover all PA management in an efficient way. For this reason, we propose
    a flexible platform able to cope with soilless culture needs in full recirculation
    greenhouses using moderately saline water. It is based on exchangeable low-cost
    hardware and supported by a three-tier open source software platform at local,
    edge and cloud planes. At the local plane, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) interact
    with crop devices to gather data and perform real-time atomic control actions.
    The edge plane of the platform is in charge of monitoring and managing main PA
    tasks near the access network to increase system reliability against network access
    failures. Finally, the cloud platform collects current and past records and hosts
    data analytics modules in a FIWARE deployment. IoT protocols like Message Queue
    Telemetry Transport (MQTT) or Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) are used
    to communicate with CPS, while Next Generation Service Interface (NGSI) is employed
    for southbound and northbound access to the cloud. The system has been completely
    instantiated in a real prototype in frames of the EU DrainUse project, allowing
    the control of a real hydroponic closed system through managing software for final
    farmers connected to the platform. Previous article in issue Next article in issue

    WSN Wireless Sensor Networks 1. Introduction New trends in agriculture seek to
    manage crops in controlled environments such as greenhouses, which enable the
    recreation of the quasi–optimal parameters that plants need to improve the production
    or duplicate the environmental conditions of specific geographical areas to locally
    obtain products that are usually imported. Moreover, severe weather variations
    that impact on crop production can be avoided with a tight management of temperature,
    humidity and lighting. Modern agriculture aims at increasing crop yield in terms
    of production and quality. One of the advances in modern agriculture is the spread
    of soilless culture Resh (2012), also known as hydroponics, which further increases
    productivity. However, in comparison to open field vegetable crops, the fertiliser
    requirements are eight to ten times higher. For this reason, these agricultural
    systems also require an intense use of water and fertilisers that have to be managed
    in a efficient way. In open hydroponic systems where drainage is released into
    the environment, up to 31% of nitrates and a 48% of potassium applied are discharged,
    implying pollution and eutrophication of land and water. European Union policies
    try to reduce the environmental costs of intense agriculture through different
    instruments and directives (Common Agricultural Policy - CAP, Nitrates Directive
    - 91/676/EEC, Water framework Directive - 2000/60/IEC). As an alternative to open
    hydroponic systems, full re-circulation systems (also known as closed systems)
    were initially developed in The Netherlands, but the percentage of producers that
    use them in their greenhouses in the rest of Europe is very low, mainly because
    these systems need to be designed and adjusted to the specific conditions where
    production is taking place. The adoption of re-circulation using moderately saline
    water, as is the case of Mediterranean areas, requires detailed information of
    crop response to salinity, in order to optimise management of drainage recirculation.
    However, one of the main problems of closed recirculating systems is the build-up
    of salts in the nutrient solution. It is well known that salinity severely limits
    the productivity of crops and, as a difference from Northern European countries,
    the electrical conductivity of the water used for irrigation in Mediterranean
    areas is usually high. In order to avoid discharge of drainage and maintain the
    electrical conductivity of the nutrient solution at optimal levels for plant growth
    in these areas, it is necessary to add low conductivity water, which can be obtained
    from a purification unit based on a reverse osmosis system. However, these sophisticated
    systems requires high degrees of automation. In recent years high monitoring and
    control capacities are obtained in agronomic systems thanks to the use of new
    information and communication technologies. These combine with industrial automation
    to enable Precision Agriculture (PA) (Gebbers & Adamchuk, 2010). Current sensors
    offer highly accurate values of the status of crops, and actuators are able to
    manage irrigation, change climate factors or enrich the soil with the needed nutrients
    (Mulla, 2013). When appropriate, computer intelligence techniques are also put
    into play to further improve production in PA by reducing diseases and the need
    for human intervention in regular activities. This is a must in extreme PA cases
    such as the previously discussed hydroponics one, where natural resources of common
    agriculture are left aside and even more precise control actions must be carried
    out. Hence, automation is, without doubt, the future of agriculture, but new frameworks
    improving the modularity of hardware and software units, and assuring the precise
    management of crops in an efficient way are needed. Recently the Internet of Things
    (IoT) has implied the integration of communication capabilities to sensors and
    actuators (Atzori, Iera, & Morabito, 2010), which is highly relevant in the PA
    domain (Ray, 2017). Now it is possible to obtain hardware solutions powered with
    firmware that interconnects these final devices with gateways through wireless
    channels and using open and/or regulated protocols that avoid proprietary solutions.
    Wireless sensor networks (WSN) further evolve this with communication topologies
    that reduce infrastructure costs and reduce power consumption, hence reducing
    costs in PA exploitation (Riquelme et al., 2009). These novel sensors and actuators
    also need evolved automation nodes potentially acting as IoT gateways. Hence,
    traditional control units installed at the crop side are now considered Cyber-Physical
    Systems (CPS), involving hardware nodes with computing, storing and communications
    capabilities to control and interact with industrial processes (An et al., 2016).
    CPS is now the scientific-agreed term used for networked (distributed) embedded
    systems to gather data from sensors, communicate with actuators and cooperate
    among them to cover automation needs. At the same level of importance as IoT or
    CPS, cloud computing (Voorsluys, Broberg, & Buyya, 2011) has been the last hit
    in PA (Choudhary, Jadoun, & Mandoriya, 2016). Here an extra level of flexibility
    is offered by a remote software platform providing monitoring and control management.
    These software platforms can be easily extended on demand and avoid the installation
    of complex systems at the local level. In cloud computing, crop data are gathered
    through a communication channel offered by local controllers (e.g., CPS nodes)
    that, additionally, can also allow certain control actions. All data are saved
    by a software entity usually virtualised in a data centre that offers Platform
    as a Service (PaaS) resources. The access to crop monitoring and control features
    is finally offered by web services accessible from a number of platforms, including
    desktop computers and smart phones. Lately, a trendy paradigm not exploited in
    agriculture is fog and edge computing. Traditionally, these paradigms are focused
    on improving system reaction by reducing network delay, since computing nodes
    are close to end devices. However, in the PA area, network performance requirements
    are more relaxed, though a critical issue is the reliability of the channel connecting
    the crops with the control modules. The solution proposed here is to move part
    of the data analytics and control features from the cloud to nodes close to end-devices
    in the network path. This implies a reliable management of CPS actions requiring
    high accuracy and, additionally, intermediate data filtering capabilities. In
    this frame, the solution presented in this paper covers the needs for fully automated
    PA scenarios including the mentioned special case of Mediterranean areas, through
    a three-tier open source software platform that distributes computing at CPS,
    edge and cloud planes, according to the needs of each action. IoT communication
    technologies are used to connect sensors and actuators with CPS nodes. Here, atomic
    control actions are executed at CPS level, while greenhouse main control actions
    are orchestrated by an edge layer composed of four control modules for irrigation,
    climate, nutrition and auxiliary tasks. They are powered by Network Function Virtualisation
    (NFV), so they can be instantiated at different nodes along the network path,
    from the crop to the cloud. IoT communication protocols such as Message Queue
    Telemetry Transport (MQTT) or Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) are used
    to communicate CPS nodes with these subsystems. Finally, the cloud layer is given
    by a FIWARE middleware that stores, processes and enables management web services
    for remote monitoring and control. The cloud module of the platform communicates
    with the rest of system nodes using the Next Generation Service Interface (NGSI),
    in the form of a southbound NGSI to link with edge subsystems, and a northbound
    NGSI to allow access to final applications. According to the state of the art
    presented later, the next novelties are presented in this work: • Highly-flexible
    three-tier architecture for PA that fosters software and hardware modularity across
    the different abstraction levels of the solution. • An NFV-based solution is proposed
    in an edge layer to perform local operation decisions in a PA-based environment,
    which can be deployed opportunistically at different levels of the network. •
    Efficient and reliable PA operations are assured through distributing responsibilities
    between edge and CPS planes, avoiding problems originated from network failures
    when using a remote cloud control. • Full instantiation of the proposal with a
    real field deployment validating the operation of the system in the challenging
    area of hydroponics. The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 presents
    the works in the literature that aim at solving the PA problem using new information
    and communication technologies. The overall proposed platform is described in
    Section 3, while Section 4 gives details about the FIWARE-based cloud and edge
    solution. Then, a real prototype of the system is described in Section 5. Section
    6 focuses on the real operation of the platform, describing main procedures and
    including validation results extracted from the prototype. Finally, conclusions
    and future works are presented in Section 7. 2. State of the art The first steps
    in PA were focused on the automatic control of actuators on the basis of sensor
    data gathered from crops. Usually, in these systems sensors and actuators were
    wired with an automation node. The control area has evolved gradually, as can
    be seen in the rule-based scheme presented by Canadas, Sanchez-Molina, Rodriguez,
    and del Aguila (2017), or the event-driven solution described by Pawlowski, Sanchez-Molina,
    Guzman, Rodriguez, and Dormido (2017). However, the real advance in the last years
    in PA has been in the line of integrating new information and communication technologies
    to support farmers in management and decision making. The first solutions using
    communication networks in controlled agriculture were based on common Internet
    technologies used in common PC applications. Marhaenanto, Soni, and Salokhe (2013),
    for instance, presented a crop management system that uses remote desktop and
    regular client/server applications. Another set of proposals in this line are
    based on using Web connections to directly access crop sensors and control actuation
    nodes, such as by Bajer and Krejcar (2015). Here, a set of Arduino nodes that
    are wired with sensors and actuators are managed through the Internet, accessing
    a Web application available in the firmware. IoT integration in PA has implied
    an evolution in the way actuators and sensors communicate with gateway nodes and
    even the Internet. Regarding communication technologies, new IoT-capable nodes
    integrate new transceivers able to save energy and create network topologies adapted
    to field conditions, where cellular or WiFi-like base stations are rare. As the
    proposal of Akka and Sokullu (2017) shows, multi-hop topologies using wireless
    sensor networks can allow the routing of data messages through the communication
    nodes to reach a gateway with Internet connectivity. Here, the ZigBee technology
    is used, as by Lamprinos and Charalambides (2015), where gathered data is finally
    accessible through a Web server available in the gateway. More recent advances
    in the IoT area include network protocols to connect with remote devices through
    Internet by using application-level messaging optimised for reducing data rates.
    S. Muthupavithran, Akash, and Ranjithkumar (2016) used the MQTT protocol to collect
    data from sensor nodes at greenhouses for monitoring purposes, for instance. These
    protocols allow the collection and analysis of data at intermediate cloud middleware,
    as discussed by Shukla, Panchal, and Patel (2015). Kaloxylos et al. (2014) presented
    a more developed system in this line. Here, data from a real deployment of sensors
    is gathered by a gateway using ZigBee, and then sent to a data cloud powered by
    FIWARE through Web-based protocols. The work exploits the idea of open interfaces
    to create multiple client applications accessing the cloud module. However, IoT
    protocols are not used and a quite preliminary version of FIWARE is employed.
    Martinez, Pastor, Alvarez, and Iborra (2016) presented research on the cloud plane
    to manage crops in PA environments. Here the FIWARE core, together with a set
    of additional enablers, are used to connect with IoT gateways through several
    protocols, such as MQTT or CoAP, and current and historical data are maintained
    in the cloud for analytics purposes. The FIWARE performance is evaluated for PA
    in terms of a set of synthetic tests, but a real development of the proposal is
    not given. The same research group have presented (Lopez-Riquelme, Pavon-Pulido,
    Navarro-Hellin, Soto-Valles, and Torres-Sanchez (2017)) a real system, but it
    is limited by the technologies and functionalities offered. Data is collected
    from the crops through a Web-based protocol over GPRS and only monitoring features
    are included in the system. An evolution of exclusively cloud-based platforms
    is the inclusion of intermediary processing stages in the data path. Liu (2016)
    performed local preprocessing at data collection gateways, before sending monitoring
    information to the cloud. This idea is further exploited by Ferrandez-Pastor,
    Garca-Chamizo, Nieto-Hidalgo, Mora-Pascual, and Mora-Martnez (2016), where a set
    of IoT protocols and technologies are also evaluated in a real hydroponic deployment.
    However, in these works a lack of flexibility is noticeable in the way edge computing
    is implemented, and this layer is exclusively oriented to data fusion. In general,
    these works in the literature partially cover IoT interconnection, data collection
    and access through clouds, and only some initial edge computing approaches are
    found. Realistic systems offering (1) flexibility in the hardware used at crop
    site, (2) edge computing nodes at which to filter data powered by NFV, and (3)
    efficient and reliable execution of both sensing and control tasks, are not common
    in current works. In this line the current paper presents an integral crop management
    system supporting up-to-date IoT technologies and protocols and supported by FIWARE,
    which divides essential PA tasks in control modules instantiated in virtualised
    nodes that orchestrate atomic tasks to be executed at local CPS. 3. System architecture
    The overall control architecture of the solution presented to cover PA management
    needs is depicted in Fig. 1. It is essentially distributed into three main planes:
    crop (local) CPS tier, edge computing tier, and data analytics and smart management
    at the cloud. The CPS and cloud planes are designed to be respectively deployed
    at the local crop premises and remote data servers, respectively. The intermediate
    layer for edge computing comprises a set of virtualised control modules in the
    form of NFV nodes that can be instantiated along the network path, from the field
    facilities to the cloud plane on the Internet. This increases versatility in the
    deployment of the solution, at the same time connectivity performances with the
    CPS layer are met. Download : Download high-res image (426KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. Overall architecture of the PA platform. The cloud, edge
    and CPS planes are separated by dotted lines. The edge computing modules are instantiated
    as NFV elements, allowing their placement at the most convenient network level.
    At the crop premises, sensors and actuators for PA automation are deployed and
    connected with CPS nodes. Examples of sensors are solar radiation, humidity, temperature,
    CO2, pH meter, electrical conductivity, liquid consumption (flow meters) or pressure
    sensors, while some of the actuators considered are soil and water nutrition pumps,
    valves and activation of devices (watering and ventilation devices, lighting,
    or automated windows). These are connected with CPS units through wired channels
    using industrial serial (usually RS485) or direct digital/analogue I/O connections.
    For wireless communications, 6LowPAN is used to connect with data-loggers, which
    include several sensors. All the CPS units are interconnected with the Internet
    through an access network using multiple technologies, such as microwave radio
    links, fibre optic or DSL. In this architecture, low level operations that require
    minimum latency and high reliability in the communication with sensors or actuators
    are executed at CPS nodes. These are considered as atomic actions, such as closing
    a window, execute an irrigation mandate for a period of time or ventilating until
    a CO2 level is reached. Additionally, there are emergency reactive actions locally
    implemented in the CPS nodes that require real-time operation and can be launched
    without the human or edge plane supervision. An example of these are the opening
    of windows and turning on ventilation if the greenhouse inner temperature reaches
    a predefined threshold. The second processing and managing level of the layered
    architecture is the edge computing plane, which includes a set of NFV-powered
    control modules in charge of orchestrating the CPS layer. The subsystems of the
    edge layer make up the main operative control of the greenhouse and they are in
    charge of irrigation, climate, nutrition and auxiliary tasks, including alarms
    and energy management. At this layer, data fusion and aggregation is carried out
    to offload analytics functions usually performed in the cloud, given that the
    cloud part of the platform could serve a multitude of crops and users. The edge
    control modules are virtualised through NFV techniques that allow their instantiation
    at different levels in the network path, and they communicate with CPS nodes using
    IoT communication protocols such as MQTT or CoAP. MQTT is especially considered,
    given that it is more addressed to the management of industrial processes, however,
    CoAP is also supported for particular non-critical monitoring tasks not involving
    control. As depicted in Fig. 1, the data cloud serves as the interface between
    users and the core platform. Here is where the current status of the crop and
    configuration parameters are maintained. The NGSI interface is used to send data
    updates and receive notifications upon data changes. A change in configuration
    parameters triggers control actions that are managed by edge subsystems. Moreover,
    as can be seen in the diagram, special analytics coupled with concrete service
    needs are performed using the cloud as data source. For the communication between
    final applications and the analytics module, a REST interface transporting JSON
    data is used. 4. FIWARE-based cloud and edge solution Here we present the details
    of the cloud and edge planes of the instantiated architecture. We have used the
    FIWARE platform to provide the main software modules. In our particular case,
    the ORION Context Broker1 is chosen to provide access to the greenhouse status
    information stored in it, providing different methods to register/update, request
    and subscribe for certain data records; Comet2 is included to provide persistence
    to the data; and the IoT Device Management Generic Enabler (IDAS) is chosen to
    connect with IoT devices. This section discussed how FIWARE is used at edge and
    cloud layers of the architecture illustrated in Fig. 1. 4.1. Edge computing plane
    The edge computing plane can be deployed according to the features and requirements
    of the target PA scenario. This way, it is possible to move the edge computing
    plane next to the cloud or, by contrast, to instantiate this logic next to the
    local deployment. This can be done thanks to virtualisation. Control modules in
    the edge plane are developed as NFV nodes, which allows us to easily move the
    components according to the aforementioned requirements. For this reason, each
    control module provided by our solution is instantiated in a specific virtualised
    image that is launched opportunistically depending on the scenario requirement.
    Images are hosted by a Virtualized Infrastructure Manager (VIM) that allows remote
    management through a proper API. As depicted in Fig. 2, each control module comprises
    a Context Broker, two IoT Agents of the IDAS GE for CoAP and MQTT communications,
    and the Comet GE provides persistence to the data. Hence, each IoT Agent acts
    as intermediary between the information provided by the CPS layer and the Context
    Broker. Additionally, a specific software entity (Smart Module in the figure)
    is responsible for managing the tasks related to the specific control module.

    Fig. 2. Edge computing plane. Each NFV-based control module is instantiated as
    a compact FIWARE domain that interconnects the cloud and CPS planes, and performs
    smart control actions offloading the cloud and providing extra reliability. For
    the case of the MQTT support, the MQTT IoT Agent acts as broker to provide the
    meeting point of the publish/subscribe scheme to allow communications with CPSs.
    We have defined the next MQTT topics (the notation is simplified for the sake
    of clarity, but details can be found in the IoT Agent Step by Step guide3): •
    , , … : a specific topic is created for each of the CPSs instantiated in our platform,
    where the corresponding CPS is configured as publisher and the control modules
    at the edge plane are set as subscribers. • , , and : one topic is created for
    each control module virtualised in our architecture. This way, they can manage
    the CPSs involved in their activities by sending concrete instructions. Hence,
    each control module is configured as publisher for its corresponding topic, and
    the CPSs are configured as subscriber for each of them. By using a Context Broker
    per control module, we can perform edge computing tasks without accessing the
    cloud plane. In the concrete case illustrated in Fig. 2, for instance, the software
    unit in charge of irrigation intelligence is subscribed to the information of
    interest in the local Context Broker, being notified this way with changes received
    from the related CPS, including soil moisture and temperature, among others. In
    the same way, each of the decisions made by the smart module provokes changes
    in data records within the Context Broker, which in turn generates the publication
    of MQTT requests through the IoT Agent that finally reaches the related CPS. 4.2.
    Cloud plane Computer intensive tasks or those requiring a global view are undertaken
    at the elements deployed into the Cloud plane, which have been also virtualised
    in high-end servers. Figure 3 describe all the functionality provided by the cloud
    plane. Again, an instance of the Context Broker is used to maintain data records
    and handle NGSI interfaces. As a difference from the Context Broker instances
    included at the edge plane, the one included here maintains high-level data records
    about the status of the crop, including also filtered or preprocessed values coming
    from the edge level. An NGSI subscription is maintained by a Comet instance to
    save historical data, and another one is used to feed Big Data routines. Final
    management services interact with these two components in order to obtain all
    needed information to perform final decisions that are supervised by human operators.

    Fig. 3. Cloud computing plane. A virtual representation of the greenhouse state
    is maintained in a high-end FIWARE deployment, which is complemented with Big
    Data analytics to better support the human intervention. Data analytics are enabled
    by a distributed file-system that saves information among several machines. We
    have employed the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) for this purpose. Another
    FIWARE enabler called Cygnus is in charge of taking data records from the Context
    Broker and saving them in Hadoop. Finally, our data analytics component will compute
    all the reasoning processes to assist decisions to be carried out by management
    services. 5. Prototype The target greenhouse of the system is the Experimental
    Greenhouse of CEBAS-CSIC illustrated in Fig. 4, a governmental research facility
    in Murcia, south-east of Spain, with geographical coordinates 38.1079837° N, −1.0355991°
    E and 120 m of elevation. It has a surface of 462.5 m2 (25 m × 18.5 m) and is
    between 5 and 7.5 m in height. Beside the greenhouse, we have built a room of
    60 m2 for the machinery and control systems. Download : Download high-res image

    greenhouse. The growing rows and the raffia thread to maintain the tomato plants
    are visible in the main view, while the humidifier module and climate sensors
    are shown in the small photo. Plants of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) are selected
    for the pilot system, one of the most economically important and extended crops
    in south Europe. Tomato is produced in 38% of the European greenhouse surface,
    so this prototype is potentially extensible to many other greenhouses. However,
    thanks to the flexibility of the solution proposed, it can be easily deployed
    for other crop species. Additionally, the software in charge of formulating the
    nutrient solutions, can be easily adapted to the nutritional needs of other crops.
    The tomatoes were transplanted in a soilless system in a first cycle on 17th October
    2016 and were harvested on 26th may 2017 (7 months). Plants were grown in 19 rows,
    54 plants per row, and they were guided with raffia thread to conduce the plant
    growth. A second cycle was carried out between 7th June 2017 and 30th November
    2017, but this time reducing the number of plants to 486. The plants were grown
    in the greenhouse under controlled conditions of temperature, humidity and irrigation.
    The maximum temperature was established to 27°C and the reference humidity was
    60%. The plants were daily irrigated with a nutrient solution containing , , ,
    , and micro-nutrients. Drainage volume, pH and electrical conductivity in the
    greenhouse is daily controlled too. The mineral composition (anions and cations)
    and microbiological control of the irrigation nutrient solution and drainage are
    analysed weekly, to ensure that the calibration of the software is correct. Since
    the idea is to design a system suitable for Mediterranean crops, the substrate
    used in the demonstration is coco peat, which is a challenging material regarding
    turbidity of the drainage and the microbial content. In the following subsections,
    we describe the main parts of the greenhouse facilities and the deployment of
    computing nodes to deal with edge and cloud planes of the architecture. 5.1. Greenhouse
    facilities The greenhouse has a set of equipment mainly deployed inside a machinery
    room beside the crop. These facilities are composed of several hardware units
    described in the following subsections, and all of them are managed by our three-tier
    control system, whose particular implementation is also detailed. 5.1.1. Nutrient
    solution unit The nutrient solution unit is where all nutrients needed for optimal
    plant growth are mixed, and it is controlled by a CPS and finally orchestrated
    by the edge computing nutrition control module. This unit consists of five fertilisers
    tanks and one acid tank used to adjust pH. All of them with a volume of 500 l.
    The unit provides the crops rhizosphere with the 12 essential elements to complete
    their life cycle: nitrogen, sulphur, phosphorus, calcium, potassium, iron, copper,
    manganese, boron, zinc, molybdenum. As detailed in Fig. 5, the content of these
    six tanks are mixed with the disinfected drainages, tap water and high quality
    water from the osmosis system, to prepare a nutrient solution in the nutritive
    solution tank of 3000 l. For this, we have installed magnetic pumps for each fertiliser,
    level sensors for the tanks, electrical valves, flow meters, and an electromechanical
    stirrer in the main tank. The nutrition control module (edge computing layer)
    controls the nutrient solution based on the electrical conductivity, pH and temperature
    measured on the impulsion pipe of the pump, which finally irrigates the crop,
    taking the nutrient solution from the tank. Download : Download high-res image

    and irrigation in the greenhouse. Low quantities of water and nutrients are needed
    thanks to a complete automated system that adapts nutrition according to a formula
    tuned at the cloud plane and executed by edge control modules. 5.1.2. Irrigation
    unit Three intermediate tanks are used to work with different nutrient solutions
    to make easier the experiments, as can be seen in Fig. 5. The solution to be used
    is pumped to irrigate the crop during 5 min and several times, with an estimated
    flow of 3000 . Irrigation and drainage flows are measured by flow meters that
    provide digital inputs to the CPS calibrated to . The whole process is controlled
    by the irrigation control module in the edge computing layer. Untreated drainage
    water is collected in a tank with a capacity of 1000 l, which is later pumped
    and pre-filtered to remove impurities of every nature and consistency. 5.1.3.
    Disinfection unit The filtered water is conducted through the disinfection unit
    (lower part of Fig. 5), which was initially based on ultraviolet treatment to
    reduce or eliminate microbial content, and thus reduce the appearance of diseases.
    Lately the system has been replaced by another unit based on a reactor of electrolysis,
    which has shown to be more effective, as the results presented in Section 6.2
    indicate. A precise dimensioning of the process using our system allows the totally
    effective treatment of illnesses that are transmitted by water pathogens. This
    unit is able to treat a maximum of 200 of drainage. The disinfected water is stored
    in a 5000 l tank with control level, where it is analysed. The electrical conductivity,
    pH and temperature are measured on the impulsion pipe of the pump, which sends
    back the water to the main nutritive solution tank. The whole process is controlled
    by a CPS, following the parameters indicated by the nutrition control module in
    the edge layer. 5.1.4. Purification unit The system has a purification unit with
    a reverse osmosis equipment that transforms tap water into low electrical conductivity
    water that can be mixed with drainages and tap water to prepare final nutrient
    solutions. The pilot has a purification unit able to generate 100 of low electric
    conductivity in a 5000 l tank, together with a flow meter, valves and pump needed
    to inject the water, which are connected with a CPS and controlled by the nutrition
    control module in the edge layer. 5.1.5. Climate unit The greenhouse has an IPv6
    over Low power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) deployment, where sensors
    are directly interconnected using Internet protocols, to measure the temperature,
    humidity, solar radiation and CO2. A CPS device is provided with peripherals dedicated
    to manage the different climatic devices. Although the platform is capable of
    managing up to thirteen climatic systems, the physical facilities of the prototype
    greenhouse has currently the following hardware: • Ventilation system with four
    overhead motorised windows. • Thermal-shade screen system on the roof, with an
    electro-mechanical traction system for opening and closing. It gets 48% of shadow
    and 55% of energy saving. • Air cooling system, which consists of a humidifier
    module and three helical extractors. The extractors have a flow of 38,000 . •
    Air fog system, used to humidify and cool the greenhouse through water evaporation.
    It has a pressure pump of 1 HP and 25 l, and an air compressor of 4 HP and 50
    l. • Heating system with a 100,000 kcal boiler, a stainless steel heat exchanger
    and 1 HP pumps for three distribution units. A broad range of sensors from the
    market were considered to fulfil the operation and environmental requirements
    of the platform. They were studied within the DrainUse project4 attending to the
    functionality provided and cost, and the finally selected ones are included in
    Table 1, indicating the model and main operation features. The operation of these
    sensors have been validated through the two cycles of tomato crop, presenting
    correct reads after the initial calibration procedure carried out in the CPS and
    6LoWPAN logger. Table 1. Sensors used in the prototype greenhouse, including relevant

    programmed and supervised by humans using the management services when required,
    with the intelligent support provided by data analytics. New high-level configuration
    parameters in the cloud Context Broker trigger notifications and changes in the
    Context Broker of edge control modules, which in turn are in charge of managing
    the operation of the individual greenhouse areas through mandating their corresponding
    CPSs. 5.2.1. CPS deployment Each control module in the edge computing plane has
    been initially assigned with a master CPS unit, resulting in a fully distributed
    system. The nutrition master CPS unit is in charge of controlling the nutrient
    solution, disinfection and purification hardware units, that is, the complete
    water cycle except for the irrigation action itself, which is carried out by a
    separate master CPS unit (and edge computing module). Unlike many commercial fertigation
    systems, we have decided to separate irrigation from nutrition control in order
    to have more flexibility to implement intelligent irrigation programs, apart from
    simply considering time and volume. Finally, the climate hardware unit is managed
    by the corresponding master CPS unit and control module. The three master CPS
    nodes (and edge control modules) are complemented by an auxiliary CPS and control
    module in charge of energy monitoring, alarms management and other auxiliary tasks
    as access control. Concrete implementations of emergency procedures in the auxiliary
    CPS include the described high temperature case, but also the lack of enough water
    flow from input pipes and additional support for energy cuts. In the first case,
    the human operator is warned of the water flow problem by the application described
    in Section 5.2.3, using the regular communication channel through the edge and
    cloud planes. However, to cover power cuts, the auxiliary CPS is equipped with
    a GSM modem and a backup battery to warn a human technician with an SMS message.
    The contact number can be configured in the user application described later.
    The master CPS consists of an IPex16 controller from Odin Solutions (OdinS), which
    is shown in Fig. 6, with a 32-bit CPU, 4 MB of memory expandable with microSD,
    Ethernet, USB, CAN, 3xRS232, 1xRS485 and 16 I/O ports, which can be configured
    by software as digital or analogue input/outputs. It supports 3G, 6LowPAN, Sigfox
    and LoRA. Each master CPS is able to manage eight additional slave I/O boards
    using CAN. The configuration of the controllers is done easily through its web
    server, and it permits us to configure atomic reactive (high priority) tasks independently
    from the MQTT commands received from the edge computing layer. In our case the
    communication of the CPSs with the network is through LAN. The communication among
    master and slave CPS nodes is done through CAN bus, allowing distances up to 1
    km. This permits to distribute CPSs along the facilities. Download : Download

    considered in the deployment. The IPex16 controller has been used due to their
    capabilities and flexible configuration. Both master and slave CPS nodes are installed
    in the separated electrical panels showed in Fig. 7. A fifth electrical panel
    contains the power meters of the installation. Figure 8 presents a diagram with
    the connection of different sensors with an IPex16-based CPS unit, indicating
    as well the MQTT protocol they use to communicate with the edge layer. As it depicts,
    both sensors and actuators use direct I/O lines for connection. Thus, by configuring
    analogue inputs, e.g., measurements such as temperature, humidity or pH can be
    transmitted from the sensor to the corresponding edge control module. Digital
    inputs are used for counters and, digital outputs are used to actuate over the
    elements of the greenhouse. Remote sensors that cannot be easily wired with the
    CPS are interconnected with 6LoWPAN. Download : Download high-res image (206KB)

    with sensors through the IPex16 CPS unit. The prototype system has 134 I/O wired
    signals distributed among all IPex16-based CPSs, and also some wireless signals
    using 6LowPAN. Most of the data collected come from wired digital outputs to solenoid
    valves, pumps, other motors (p.e. windows, screens systems) and analogue inputs
    from sensors (temperature, humidity, radiation, CO2, etc.). We also have a set
    of digital inputs from the different flow meters (liquids consumption). Sensors
    interconnected through 6LoWPAN are wired with Mex06 data loggers from OdinS, which
    are low-power devices especially prepared for remote control and monitoring. They
    include a 16-bit CPU, 4 MB of memory expandable with microSD, 1xRS232, 1xSDI-12
    and, what is of relevance, 1xRF 802.15.4 g over which 6LowPAN operates. Mex06
    loggers are especially designed for outdoor settings such as the agricultural
    scenarios, since it is provided with a water and dust-proof enclosure. It is prepared
    to be provided with a battery and a solar panel. The operation of these units
    have been validated connecting sensors deployed along the crop: temperature, humidity
    and solar radiation. Both IPex16 (CPS) and Mex06 (wireless data logger), have
    been adapted by OdinS within the DrainUse project. Hence, the firmware of theses
    units have been improved as a result of this research to serve as generic-purpose
    MQTT units for high-precision automation environments. 5.2.2. Deployment of computing
    nodes In the current deployment, edge control modules are virtualised in a local
    server installed at the crop premises, while the cloud plane is set-up in a high-end
    server at the Computer Science Faculty (University of Murcia). Within the machinery
    room (beside the greenhouse) we have installed a common computer with PC architecture.
    It is comprised by an Intel Core i5-7400 CPU (3.00 GHz and Quad Core architecture),
    16 GB of RAM and a hard disk of 1 TB. The computer runs Centos 7, and LibVirt/KVM
    is used to create four virtual machines, one per control module. Virtual machines
    are provided with 4 GB of RAM and 50 GB of hard disk capacity. This is enough
    to run the local Context Broker instances, which deals with only a part of the
    system, save data, and execute IoT agents. The cloud server is a PowerEdge R200,
    with an Intel Xeon x3360 (2.83 GHz and Quad Core architecture), 32 GB of RAM and
    two hard disks of 500 GB each. It also runs Centos 7 and LibVirt/KVM. A single
    virtual machine is used here for the global Context Broker, data saving, Big Data
    processes and to host management with web services. The virtual machine uses 16
    GB of memory and 200 GB of hard disk capacity. Good performances are obtained
    at the moment, but given the flexibility of our architecture, more resources could
    be added by modifying or moving virtual images. The Context Broker version used
    has been Orion 1.7.0, which is supported by Comet release 6. Exclusively for the
    cloud computing plane, it is also used Cygnus 1.0 and Hadoop 2.8. 5.2.3. User
    management service Regarding the management services identified in Fig. 3, we
    have developed a set of web services in HTML5 with a friendly graphical view to
    monitor and control the main functions of the system. Figure 9 includes a screen
    shot of the application area to manage climate. The view in the image includes
    tools to monitor the status of the climatic equipment of the greenhouse. Green-shaded
    parts indicate that these modules are active, such as the air-fog system, ventilation
    and cooling. Current values for temperature, humidity, radiation and air quality
    are also displayed. Usually all the greenhouse facilities are automatically managed
    by edge control modules according to general configuration parameters dictated
    at the cloud plane, by using this application. In this software it is possible
    to set the range of climatic parameters, or the base components of the nutrition
    solution, among others. Manual management of greenhouse facilities is also possible
    providing the required credentials. Download : Download high-res image (699KB)

    by HTML5, where the human operator can monitor the status of the greenhouse and
    set the main configuration parameters. Additionally, it allows the manual operation
    of individual automated modules at the greenhouse. 6. System operation This section
    describes the validation of the architecture and prototype from two different
    perspectives. First, an operation example with a real task is described attending
    to the three tiers of the architecture, with the aim of clarifying the function
    of each part of the system. Second, the platform is used in two cycles of a real
    crop and main results are analysed. 6.1. Reference operation example Given that
    the nutrition management is the most interesting operation from the PA point of
    view, here we include a complete description of the tasks carried out to actuate
    on the greenhouse and assure a proper irrigation with fertilisers. The explanation
    is split into the cloud, edge and CPS planes, following the sequence of tasks
    executed. 6.1.1. Cloud level In this layer, on the basis of a nutrient percentage
    table, the nutrition recipe (mixture) is calculated “theoretically” (there are
    no physical actions). To do this, a set of calculations assure that a final set
    of volumes of water sources and fertilisers comply with the plant needs. The steps
    are: 1. The first time the software presented in Section 5.2.3 is used, the following
    parameters must be defined: (a) Available fertilisers in the facilities. (b) Water
    components based on analysis carried out beforehand in laboratory of each external
    water source. 2. For a new nutrition mixture the next parameters are defined:
    (a) Volume of the mixture. (b) Nutrient percentage table with the cations–anions
    equilibrium concentration. (c) Selection of the fertiliser cubes and water sources
    from the list of available ones. (d) Target irrigation tank. (e) Desired pH and
    maximum electrical conductivity (ECmax). 3. Calculate the volume of different
    waters to be used so that ECmax is not exceeded, maximising the use of drainage
    water and reducing the cost of the mixture. 4. Compensate the excess of nutrients
    with a dilution recalculating the volumes of waters. The excess of nutrients are
    due to the already provided nutrients in the waters used. 5. Recalculate the mixture
    electrical conductivity considering the missing nutrients to be added. If ECmax
    is exceeded, a new dilution is needed in the previous step. 6 Add the missing
    nutrients As a result, the volumes of different water sources and fertilisers
    are sent to the edge level, together with the target pH and irrigation tank. 6.1.2.
    Edge level This layer is in charge of creating the mixture transmitted from the
    cloud level by orchestrating the greenhouse equipment (valves, pumps, sensor readings,
    etc). Hence, after receiving the different volumes it generates a complete set
    of operations to create the mixture. To do so, the next steps are followed: 1.
    Sequential discharge of waters in the nutritive solution tank. 2. Agitator activation.
    3. Sequential discharge of fertilisers in the nutritive solution tank. 4. Water
    recirculation through a pipe with sensors, to analyse the resulting mixture. 5.
    pH adjustment by discharges from the acid tank. 6. Pouring into the irrigation
    tank selected. 7. Cleaning the nutritive solution tank using purified water. After
    these steps have taken place, a set of atomic tasks are generated and transferred
    to the CPS level. For instance, for the first point, the sequential discharge
    of waters will be decomposed in atomic operations where a specific digital output
    is activated until the required volume is discharged. During all this process,
    the CPS will provide updated information by notifying its new status thanks to
    the MQTT protocol. Only after validating the received information, the next step
    will take place following the same procedure. Hence, each control module in the
    edge layer is responsible for orchestrating and managing the operations that are
    executed by the CPS level by sending atomic operations and by subscribing to the
    MQTT topics where the information coming from the CPS nodes will be published.
    6.1.3. CPS level This control layer executes the atomic tasks received from the
    edge layer. CPS nodes are in charge of executing sensor readings and control loops,
    sending these data to the edge layer by using the appropriate topics of the MQTT
    protocol. In this sense, no other complex logic is executed at this level, searching
    for the robustness in this part of the platform. Examples of task executed in
    CPSs are the next ones: • . Activate/deactivate a digital output, such as a valve,
    pump, etc. • . This is also an atomic task with a control loop, which can be used
    to activate a valve associated to a flow meter (irrigation by volume). • . Analogue
    sensor reading for a defined sample time. As previously indicated, the auxiliary
    CPS also includes emergency procedures to perform reactive local tasks without
    supervision. Some examples are: • Send SMS messages when a power cut is detected.
    The auxiliary CPS has a backup battery and a GSM modem to send these messages.
    • Send SMS messages when a lack of water supply from input pipes is detected.
    • Close the valves of water supply when the water consumption exceeds a threshold
    and send an SMS message. Probably the pipe circuit of the greenhouse is damaged.
    • Take reactive actions in case of adverse climatic conditions for the plants,
    such as opening windows or switching on ventilation. 6.2. System validation We
    have collected agronomic results of two cycles of the tomato crop. In the last
    cycle we decided to reduce the plan density to increase ventilation and lighting.
    The main figures of merit are included in Table 2, attending the production per
    m2, ha and the total production in kg. The revenue in market price is also included
    at the end. Table 2. Main numbers of the first and second cycle of the tomato

    Fruit per ha (kg) 65.037 76.511 Revenue (€ ) 58.533 68.860 The results indicate
    that, although the number of plants is lower in the second cycle, the total production
    has been even better than in the first cycle. This fact is clearly visible in
    the amount of fruit per plant. This improvement has been possible thanks to the
    reduction of the plant density, as said above, but also because of the lack of
    diseases, since the new disinfection unit based on a reactor of electrolysis has
    been more effective. Data obtained with the closed-loop hydroponic system (real
    data) have been compared with the needs of a regular open-cycle crop (estimation).
    The main comparative indicators for the two cycles of the crop are included in
    Table 3, including real and estimated values. To obtain the estimated data of
    water consumed in open cycle, we have assumed that the total water spent on irrigation
    (195,647 l and 140,000 l) would come from tap water to prepare the nutrient solution.
    The estimation of these volumes assume that the percentage of drainage reused
    in the close water cycle is added as new water in this case. The nutrients used
    in the open cycle are estimated following the same approach, considering that
    the new water needs extra nutrients as compared with the water gathered from drainages
    in the close cycle. Table 3. Comparison between open water cycle (OC) and close
    water cycle (CC) in terms of water and macronutrient consumption in the two crop

    can be seen in the results included in Table 3, the closed cycle represents a
    significant economic saving in the volume of water for irrigation, since the greenhouse
    is reusing 39% and 28% of the total water needed in the first and second crop
    cycles, respectively. The closed cycle has also meant a significant saving in
    the amount of fertilisers used in the nutrient solution. The differences in water
    savings between crop cycles are due to the crop periods, since the second one
    was carried out during summer and the plants require more water. Nutrient consumption
    also vary due to this fact, but also because of a variation in the water used
    and a better adaptation of the nutrients to the plant in the second cycle. From
    the results it can be said that good production levels have been obtained, at
    the same time water and nutrient consumption maintain clearly below the needs
    of regular open crops. And this has been obtained even with the target of validating
    the PA operation, with no especial focus on maximising revenues. There are important
    lessons learned after these two crop cycles. Attending to the hardware deployment,
    it has been relevant how well flow meters measure water intakes and detect circuit
    anomalies due to obstructions. Regarding the overall architecture of the control
    system, it is important to indicate that our initial conception was a static solution
    based on a single CPS acting as master unit, with several slave boards. This approach
    is similar to commercial turnkey systems available in the market, where the whole
    management is centralised on a controller or computer. These greenhouse control
    systems tend to be robust and also allow Internet access, but we experienced the
    lack of modularity, delocalisation and, above all, the lack of the flexibility
    provided by virtualisation. Flexibility is, in fact, particularly relevant when
    inserting extra services or moving the control functions to an evolved hardware.
    For this reason, our three-tier control system aims at a modular turnkey system,
    reducing engineering time in setting-up and maintenance. 7. Conclusions The work
    presented in the paper describes the design, development and evaluation of a system
    that covers extreme PA requirements by using automation, IoT technologies, and
    edge and cloud computing through virtualisation. A multi-tier platform has been
    developed, based on: (1) a CPS local layer connected with greenhouse facilities;
    (2) a novel edge computing plane where to insert control modules in virtualised
    nodes near the access network; and (3) a cloud segment provided with higher computing
    and data analytics resources to support crop management decisions. Cloud and edge
    planes are powered by FIWARE, including the use of regulated data formats and
    network interfaces, and a proper connection with local and global data analytics
    modules has been developed. The edge plane is powered with NFV technology to increase
    flexibility in deploying control modules. When deployed under the access network,
    higher levels of system reliability are reached, since sporadic network cuts do
    not affect control decisions. The whole system has been implemented in a real
    greenhouse in the south-east of Spain, including details about the main functional
    units that are controlled by our PA management platform. Moreover, two cycles
    of tomato crop have been used to, first, validate of the good operation of the
    architecture and, second, analyse the improvements of our system as compared with
    a regular open crop. Savings of more than 30% in water consumption have been obtained,
    which is highly relevant in our semi-arid area, and up to 80% in some nutrients.
    As a relevant future result, we are currently porting the platform to a urban
    farming setting in frames of the HIDROLEAF project. In this environment we make
    use of intermodal containers to create portable crops. This implies extreme climatic
    environments that makes the most of our PA platform. Moreover, we expect to continue
    evaluating the system in future crop cycles to further improve operations and
    adapt our decision support capabilities finally offered as management services
    to human operators. Acknowledgements This work has been sponsored by the Spanish

    data with its vast volume and complexity is increasingly concerned, developed
    and used for all professions and trades. Remote sensing, as one of the sources
    for big data, is generating earth-observation data and analysis results daily
    from the platforms of satellites, manned/unmanned aircrafts, and ground-based
    structures. Agricultural remote sensing is one of the backbone technologies for
    precision agriculture, which considers within-field variability for site-specific
    management instead of uniform management as in traditional agriculture. The key
    of agricultural remote sensing is, with global positioning data and geographic
    information, to produce spatially-varied data for subsequent precision agricultural
    operations. Agricultural remote sensing data, as general remote sensing data,
    have all characteristics of big data. The acquisition, processing, storage, analysis
    and visualization of agricultural remote sensing big data are critical to the
    success of precision agriculture. This paper overviews available remote sensing
    data resources, recent development of technologies for remote sensing big data
    management, and remote sensing data processing and management for precision agriculture.
    A five-layer-fifteen-level (FLFL) satellite remote sensing data management structure
    is described and adapted to create a more appropriate four-layer-twelve-level
    (FLTL) remote sensing data management structure for management and applications
    of agricultural remote sensing big data for precision agriculture where the sensors
    are typically on high-resolution satellites, manned aircrafts, unmanned aerial
    vehicles and ground-based structures. The FLTL structure is the management and
    application framework of agricultural remote sensing big data for precision agriculture
    and local farm studies, which outlooks the future coordination of remote sensing
    big data management and applications at local regional and farm scale. Previous

    \ growing demand for food in terms of quality and quantity has increased the need\n\
    for industrialization and intensiﬁcation in the agriculture ﬁeld. Internet of\
    \ Things (IoT) is a highly\npromising technology that is oﬀering many innovative\
    \ solutions to modernize the agriculture sector.\nResearch institutions and scientiﬁc\
    \ groups are continuously working to deliver solutions and products\nusing IoT\
    \ to address diﬀerent domains of agriculture. This paper presents a systematic\
    \ literature\nreview (SLR) by conducting a survey of IoT technologies and their\
    \ current utilization in diﬀerent\napplication domains of the agriculture sector.\
    \ The underlying SLR has been compiled by reviewing\nresearch articles published\
    \ in well-reputed venues between 2006 and 2019. A total of 67 papers were\ncarefully\
    \ selected through a systematic process and classiﬁed accordingly. The primary\
    \ objective\nof this systematic study is the collection of all relevant research\
    \ on IoT agricultural applications,\nsensors/devices, communication protocols,\
    \ and network types. Furthermore, it also discusses the\nmain issues and challenges\
    \ that are being investigated in the ﬁeld of agriculture. Moreover, an\nIoT agriculture\
    \ framework has been presented that contextualizes the representation of a wide\
    \ range\nof current solutions in the ﬁeld of agriculture. Similarly, country policies\
    \ for IoT-based agriculture\nhave also been presented. Lastly, open issues and\
    \ challenges have been presented to provide the\nresearchers promising future\
    \ directions in the domain of IoT agriculture.\nKeywords:internetofthings;agriculture;devices/sensors;agriculturalapplications;communicationprotocols\n\
    1. Introduction\nThe widespread of the internet from the last two decades has\
    \ brought unlimited beneﬁts for\norganizations and citizens over the globe. The\
    \ major beneﬁt of this innovation was the capability\nto producer and consumer\
    \ services in real time. Recently, Internet of Things (IoT) is promising\nto provide\
    \ the same beneﬁt through its innovative technologies and giving a way to enhance\
    \ the\nuser’s perception and ability by modifying the working environment. IoT\
    \ oﬀers multiple solutions in\ndiﬀerent domains such as healthcare, retail, traﬃc,\
    \ security, smart homes, smart cities, and agriculture.\nIoT deployment in agriculture\
    \ is considered the ideal solution because in this area there is a need for\n\
    continuous monitoring and controlling. In the ﬁeld of agriculture, IoT is used\
    \ at diﬀerent levels in the\nagriculture industrial production chain [1]. The\
    \ main applications of IoT in agriculture are Precision\nFarming, Livestock, and\
    \ Greenhouses, which are grouped into diﬀerent monitoring domains. All these\n\
    applications are monitored with the help of diﬀerent IoT-based sensors/devices\
    \ by using wireless\nElectronics 2020, 9, 319; doi:10.3390/electronics9020319\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/electronics\nElectronics 2020, 9, 319\n2 of 41\nsensor networks\
    \ (WSNs) that helps the farmers collect relevant data through sensing devices.\
    \ Some\nIoT-based setups analyze and process the remote data by applying cloud\
    \ services, which helps the\nresearchers and agriculturists make better decisions.\
    \ Nowadays, with the advancement of current\ntechnology, environment monitoring\
    \ solutions oﬀer additional facilities in terms of management\nand decision making.\
    \ A custom-made landslide risk monitoring system has been developed that\nallows\
    \ quick implementations in hostile environments without user intervention [2].\
    \ What is more\ninteresting about the developed system is that it deals with node\
    \ failures and reorganizes the poor\nquality communication links on the network\
    \ by itself. An IoT management is proposed in [3] that\nmonitors the elements\
    \ such as wind, soil, atmosphere, and water over a large area. Moreover, IoT-based\n\
    agricultural monitoring solutions have been identiﬁed based on the sub-domains\
    \ to which they\nbelong. The identiﬁed sub-domains are soil monitoring, air monitoring,\
    \ temperature monitoring,\nwater monitoring, disease monitoring, location monitoring,\
    \ environmental conditions monitoring,\npest monitoring, and fertilization monitoring.\
    \ Further, the IoT paradigm improves human interaction\nin the physical world\
    \ through low-cost electronic devices and communication protocols. IoT also\n\
    monitors diﬀerent environmental conditions to create dense and real-time maps\
    \ of noise level, air,\nwater pollution, temperature, and damaging radiations\
    \ [4,5]. Besides, data collected about diﬀerent\nenvironmental parameters is transmitted\
    \ to the user by trigger alerts or sending recommendations to\nauthorities via\
    \ messages [6].\nIn the last few decades, a large number of studies have been\
    \ presented in the IoT-based agriculture\ndomain. Therefore, it is important to\
    \ collect, summarize, analyze, and classify the state-of-the-art\nresearch in\
    \ this area. The purpose of this research is to present a comprehensive systematic\
    \ literature\nreview in the ﬁeld of IoT agriculture. The contributions of this\
    \ paper related to the IoT agriculture\ndomain are as follows. In Section 2, we\
    \ present a background of IoT agriculture technology. In Section 3,\nwe present\
    \ the research methodology by deﬁning research questions, inclusion/exclusion\
    \ criteria, and\nsearch string to collect eﬀective studies relevant to the IoT\
    \ agriculture domain and focused on diﬀerent\npublication channels. In Section\
    \ 4, we present the research results in the form of tables by synthesizing\nthe\
    \ selected papers. Besides, some IoT-based agricultural applications, sensors/devices,\
    \ communication\nprotocols, and country policies are also presented in this section.\
    \ In Section 5, we present a summary\nof our ﬁndings through a research hierarchy\
    \ and designed an IoT-based smart farming framework.\nIn Section 6, open issues\
    \ and challenges in IoT agriculture have been discussed from many diﬀerent\nperspectives.\
    \ Moreover, research validity threats are presented in Section 8. Section 9 presents\
    \ the\nconclusions of the article.\n2. Background\nResearchers have proposed diﬀerent\
    \ IoT-based technologies in the agriculture ﬁeld that are\nincreasing the production\
    \ with less workforce eﬀort. Researchers have also worked on diﬀerent\nIoT-based\
    \ agriculture projects to improve the quality and increase agricultural productivity.\
    \ Some\nIoT-based agricultural techniques have been identiﬁed from the literature,\
    \ which have been summarized\nin this section.\nCarnegie Melon University has\
    \ worked on a plant nursery by using wireless\nsensors technology [7]. In [8],\
    \ a WSN-based polyhouse monitoring system has been presented\nthat makes use of\
    \ carbon dioxide, humidity, temperature and light detection modules. By using\
    \ GPS\ntechnology and ZigBee protocol a WSN-based system has been proposed that\
    \ monitors diﬀerent\nagricultural parameters [9]. A real-time rice crop monitoring\
    \ system has been designed to increase\nthe productivity [10]. The crop monitoring\
    \ system has been presented in [11], which collects the\ninformation of rainfall\
    \ and temperature and analyzes it to mitigate the risk of crop loss and enhance\n\
    crop productivity. A low-cost Bluetooth-based system has been proposed in [12]\
    \ for monitoring various\nagricultural variables such as temperature by using\
    \ a microcontroller that works as a weather station.\nThe proposed system is best\
    \ for monitoring real-time ﬁeld data. Moreover, the disadvantage of this\nsystem\
    \ is its limited communication range and required Bluetooth conﬁguration with\
    \ smartphones\nfor continuous monitoring. A smart sensing platform based on ZigBee\
    \ has developed by [13] for\nElectronics 2020, 9, 319\n3 of 41\nmonitoring diﬀerent\
    \ environmental conditions such as humidity, temperature, sunlight, and pressure.\n\
    The developed platform provides a fast data rate, low-cost hardware, and an accurate\
    \ sensor working\non mesh network so that each node can communicate with each\
    \ other eﬀectively. A Global System for\nMobile Communications (GSM) based irrigation\
    \ monitoring system has been developed that uses an\nandroid app for measuring\
    \ diﬀerent environmental conditions such as humidity, temperature, and\ncontrol\
    \ of the water level. The basic purpose of this system is to develop a low-cost\
    \ wireless system,\nwhereas the negative aspect of the system is to know the operating\
    \ command to actuate the ﬁeld\nmotor and agriculture parameters [14]. To measure\
    \ the greenhouse parameters such as humidity and\ntemperature, a system has been\
    \ proposed on the basis of GSM and Field Programmable Gate Array\n(FPGA). The\
    \ proposed system provides cost-eﬀective and timely monitoring solutions to monitor\

    \ system has been proposed that\nuses a fuzzy control system to monitor diﬀerent\
    \ greenhouse parameters. The operation and design\nmethodologies for WSN have\
    \ been proposed in [17] for a more advanced monitoring and controlling\nsystem\
    \ in the greenhouse. Multiple environmental problems related to greenhouses have\
    \ also been\naddressed such as WSN components standardization, wireless node packaging,\

    \ The goal\nof this research is to investigate and provide a review of existing\
    \ IoT-based agricultural monitoring\napplications, sensors/devices, and communication\
    \ protocols. We have followed the methodology\nproposed by [20] to make research\
    \ impartial in the context of information selection and results in\nrepresentations.\

    \ on mesh network so that each node can communicate with each other effectively.\
    \ A \nGlobal System for Mobile Communications (GSM) based irrigation monitoring\
    \ system has been \ndeveloped that uses an android app for measuring different\
    \ environmental conditions such as \nhumidity, temperature, and control of the\
    \ water level. The basic purpose of this system is to develop \na low-cost wireless\
    \ system, whereas the negative aspect of the system is to know the operating \n\
    command to actuate the field motor and agriculture parameters [14]. To measure\
    \ the greenhouse \nparameters such as humidity and temperature, a system has been\
    \ proposed on the basis of GSM and \nField Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The\
    \ proposed system provides cost-effective and timely \nmonitoring solutions to\
    \ monitor crop and soil conditions [15]. In [16], a simple, flexible networking\
    \ \nlow-cost system has been proposed that uses a fuzzy control system to monitor\
    \ different greenhouse \nparameters. The operation and design methodologies for\
    \ WSN have been proposed in [17] for a more \nadvanced monitoring and controlling\
    \ system in the greenhouse. Multiple environmental problems \nrelated to greenhouses\
    \ have also been addressed such as WSN components standardization, wireless \n\
    node packaging, and electromagnetic field interference. In [18], a system has\
    \ been proposed that \nmonitors the animal’s health as well as identifies the\
    \ widespread diseases, whether it originates from \nbiological attacks or natural\
    \ causes. A low-cost animal health monitoring system is presented in [19] \nthat\
    \ measures the heart rate, postures, and body temperature. \n3. Research Methodology\
    \ \nA systematic literature review (SLR) is selected as the research methodology\
    \ for this paper. The \ngoal of this research is to investigate and provide a\
    \ review of existing IoT-based agricultural \nmonitoring applications, sensors/devices,\
    \ and communication protocols. We have followed the \nmethodology proposed by\
    \ [20] to make research impartial in the context of information selection and\
    \ \nresults in representations. The research methodology for this systematic mapping\
    \ study has been \nillustrated in Figure 1. \n \nFigure 1. Research methodology.\

    \ ﬁrst step of this SLR is the deﬁnition of research questions and provision of\
    \ the current\nresearch status on IoT-based agriculture. This SLR addresses eight\
    \ research questions with their\ncorresponding motivation represented in Table\
    \ 1.\nTable 1. Research questions. IoT: Internet of Things.\nNo\nResearch Question\n\
    Main Motivation\nRQ1\nWhat are the major targeted primary publication\nchannels\
    \ for IoT agricultural research?\nIn order to identify where IoT agricultural\n\
    research can be found as well as good\npublication sources for future studies.\n\
    RQ2\nHow has the frequency of approaches been\nchanged related to IoT agriculture\
    \ over time?\nIdentify the publication with the time related to\nIoT in agriculture.\n\
    RQ3\nWhat approaches are used to address problems\nrelated IoT agriculture?\n\
    To ﬁnd out existing IoT agriculture approaches\nreported in the existing IoT agriculture\
    \ literature.\nRQ4\nWhat are the main application domains of IoT in\nagriculture?\n\
    Identify the main areas of agriculture where\nIoT technology is being utilized\
    \ for monitoring,\ncontrolling, and tracking purposes.\nRQ5\nWhat are the primary\
    \ focuses of the selected\nstudies?\nTo identify the signiﬁcant proposed solutions.\n\
    RQ6\nWhat type of IoT devices/sensors have been\nused in agriculture?\nTo identify\
    \ the role of primary\nIoT devices/sensors.\nRQ7\nWhich IoT network/communication\
    \ protocols\nare used in agriculture?\nTo identify the role of network and\ncommunication\
    \ protocols.\nRQ8\nWhich IoT agricultural policy have been\nimplemented in diﬀerent\
    \ countries?\nTo measure the potential of IoT in the agriculture\nﬁeld in the\
    \ diﬀerent countries.\n3.3. Search String\nThe second phase of SLR is to search\
    \ for relevant studies on the research topics. A search string\nhas been deﬁned\
    \ that is used to gather published articles related to the research topics. We\
    \ conducted\na pilot search based on the speciﬁc keywords, and we decided to use\
    \ only IoT applications in the\nagriculture search string. However, in the pilot\
    \ search, we have also used IoT sensors/devices and\ncommunication protocols in\
    \ agriculture. Internet research has been performed by using multiple search\n\
    engines and digital libraries to collect information. The obtained results were\
    \ compiled manually\nto get the best sources for information to answer the deﬁned\
    \ research questions. Selected search\nengines and digital libraries have been\
    \ chosen based on their scientiﬁc contents and closely related\nto the objective\
    \ of this paper. The chosen databases were Springer, Elsevier, IEEE, MDPI, and\
    \ IGI\nGlobal. The next step is to identify the consistent procedures and search\
    \ terms to seek out technical\nand scientiﬁc documentation in search engines and\
    \ digital libraries. The set of keywords selected to\ndeﬁne the search string\
    \ from the research questions is given in Table 2.\nTable 2. Search string.\n\
    Sources\nSearch String\nContext\nIEEE Xplore, Science\nDirect, Springer Link,\n\
    MDPI, and IGI Global\n(“Internet of Things” OR “IoT”) AND (“IoT agricultural\n\
    Applications” OR “Devices/Sensors” OR “IoT agricultural\ndevices/sensors”) OR\
    \ (“IoT agricultural protocols” OR\n“IoT Communication Protocols”)\nAgriculture\n\
    3.4. Screening of Relevant Papers\nAll the papers in the search were not precisely\
    \ relevant to research questions; therefore, they\nneeded to be assessed according\
    \ to the actual relevancy. For this purpose, we used the search process\nElectronics\
    \ 2020, 9, 319\n5 of 41\ndeﬁned by Dybå and Dingsøyr [21] for the screening of\
    \ relevant papers. In the ﬁrst screening phase,\npapers were selected based on\
    \ their titles, and we excluded those studies that were irrelevant to the\nresearch\
    \ area. For example, the keyword protocol returns articles relevant to IoT in\
    \ other ﬁelds that\nhave diﬀerent meanings than the IoT technology used in agriculture.\
    \ These papers were totally out of\nscope, so we excluded them. In the second\
    \ phase of screening, we read the abstract of each article that\nwas selected\
    \ in the ﬁrst screening phase. Furthermore, inclusion and exclusion criteria also\
    \ used to\nscreen papers.\nWe decided to exclude the following types of papers:\n\
    •\nArticles not presenting new and emerging ideas.\n•\nPapers published other\
    \ than conferences, journals, patents, and technical reports.\n•\nArticles without\
    \ deﬁning data sources or where the data collection procedure was unclear.\n•\n\
    Articles not published in the English language.\n•\nPapers published before 2006.\n\
    •\nPapers that are not relevant to the search string.\nPapers have been selected\
    \ on the basis of the given exclusion criteria and after examining the\nabstract\
    \ of selected studies, we have decided to include it in the next screening phase.\n\
    3.5. Keywording Using Abstract\nTo ﬁnd the relevant papers through keywording\
    \ by using the abstract, we used a process deﬁned\nby Petersen et al. [22]. Keywording\
    \ has been done in two phases. In the ﬁrst phase, we have examined\nthe abstract\
    \ and identiﬁed the concepts and keywords that reﬂected the contribution of the\
    \ studies.\nIn the second phase, a higher level of understanding is developed\
    \ on the basis of these keywords. For\nthe mapping of reviews, we have used keywords\
    \ to form and cluster the categories.\n3.6. Quality Assessment\nIn an SLR, generally,\
    \ quality assessment (QA) is carried out to assess the quality of selected papers.\n\
    In this SLR, a questionnaire has been designed to measure the quality of the selected\
    \ papers. The QA\nin this SLR is carried out by following the previous mapping\
    \ study [23].\n(a)\nThe study contributes to IoT in agriculture. The possible\
    \ answers for this research question were\n“Yes (+1)” and “No (0)”.\n(b)\nThe\
    \ study represents a clear solution in the ﬁeld of agriculture by using IoT. The\
    \ possible answers\nfor this research question were “Yes (+1)”, “partially (0.5)”,\
    \ and “No (0)”.\n(c)\nThe published studies that have been cited by other articles\
    \ and possible answers for this research\nquestion were: “partially (0)” if the\
    \ citation count is 1 to 5, “No (−1)” if paper is not being cited by\nany author,\
    \ and “Yes (+1)” if citation count is more than ﬁve.\n(d)\nThe published study\
    \ is from a stable and recognized publication source. The answer to this\nquestion\
    \ has been evaluated by considering the Journal Citation Reports (JCR) lists and\
    \ CORE\nranking computer science conferences.\nPossible answers for journals and\
    \ conferences are presented in Table 3.\nElectronics 2020, 9, 319\n6 of 41\nTable\

    \ presented in\nthe form of an integer between −1 and 5.\n3.7. Study Selection\
    \ Process\nThe selection and search processes results are presented in Table 4.\
    \ Initially, 3179 papers were\nselected when the search protocol was applied on\
    \ the selected repositories. A screening process\nhas been applied on the basis\
    \ of the exclusion criteria, keywords, titles, abstracts, and full articles\n\
    of retrieved papers. One author retrieved all these papers; then, two authors\
    \ examined the papers,\nwhich led to the selection of a total 240 papers. After\
    \ that, we eliminated the duplicate titles and the\ntitles that were not relevant\
    \ to the review. For example, most of the excluded papers were related to\ngeneral\
    \ IoT such as privacy, security, healthcare, retail, and smart cities. To determine\
    \ the assessment\nagreement between two authors, a Cohen’s kappa coeﬃcient of\
    \ 0.91 was used, which indicates that\nthe evaluation made by authors is a perfect\
    \ measurement [24]. Furthermore, after reading the full\nabstracts of the selected\
    \ 171 papers in the duplication phase, we have selected 104 papers on the basis\n\
    of their abstracts. In the end, 67 studies were selected out of 3179.\nTable 4.\

    \ questions.\nRQ1: The answer to this question is given by identifying the publication\
    \ channels and sources for\nall papers.\nRQ2: To identify the frequency of approaches\
    \ of each article, which has been classiﬁed according\nto the publication year.\n\
    RQ3: Research approaches have been classiﬁed according to developing techniques\
    \ in the selected\nstudies such as whether they proposed a system, solution, method,\
    \ model, application, survey, platform,\narchitecture, ecosystem, review, and\
    \ framework.\nRQ4: To identify the primary IoT solution for agriculture, diﬀerent\
    \ monitoring, controlling, and\ntracking applications have been investigated.\n\
    RQ5: The deﬁned research question identiﬁes the primary focus of the selected\
    \ studies in the\nIoT agricultural ﬁeld.\nElectronics 2020, 9, 319\n7 of 41\n\

    \ used\nby selected IoT agricultural solutions.\nRQ7: Which communication protocol\
    \ or network system has been designed or implemented to\nprovide an IoT-based\
    \ agricultural solution.\nRQ8: Diﬀerent country policies have been discussed to\
    \ measure the value of IoT in agriculture.\n4. Analysis\nIn this section, ﬁndings\
    \ related to the SLR questions that are presented in Table 1 are described.\n\
    Research studies after choosing the screening process have been used to illustrate\
    \ each research\nquestion answer to make an essential contribution to the IoT\
    \ agriculture ﬁeld.\n4.1. Selection of Results\nAnalysis of the state-of-the-art\
    \ IoT-based smart farming studies is a key challenge due to the\ncoverage of multiple\
    \ application domains, communication protocols, sensors/devices, and protocols.\n\
    According to our research questions, we have gathered 67 primary studies in this\
    \ section. After analyzing\nthe selected studies, we have addressed each question\

    \ and determine the air condition in order to prevent\nfrom damaging eﬀects. In\
    \ [25] an IoT-based agricultural air, humidity, and temperature monitoring\nsystem\
    \ has been proposed. This system oﬀers a real-time microclimate monitoring solution\
    \ that is\nbased on WSNs. The system consists of a temperature and humidity sensor\
    \ that is supported by a\ncommunication technology called ZigBee and powered by\
    \ solar panels.\nSoil Monitoring\nPaper categorized in this sub-domain [26] proposed\
    \ solutions for soil moisture and temperature\nmonitoring in the ﬁelds using WSN.\
    \ Both of these systems are maintained through multiple\ncommunication technologies\
    \ such as GPRS, ZigBee, and the internet, where the user interacts with the\n\
    system through web applications [63,85].\nWater Monitoring\nThe studies that have\
    \ been categorized in this sub-domain intend to monitor water quality or\nwater\
    \ pollution by sensing PH, temperature, and chemicals, which can change the normal\
    \ conditions\nof water. In [27], an IoT-based solution has been presented to monitor\
    \ the water quality by measuring\ntemperature, conductivity, and turbidity. This\
    \ solution based on WSN combines sensing devices and\nmonitors the multiple parameters\
    \ of water in urban areas. Moreover, [28] developed a WSN-based\nsystem to monitor\
    \ the rainfall and water level in irrigation systems. A web-based decision support\n\
    system has been proposed in [29] that use sensors to measure temperature, solar\
    \ radiations, humidity,\nand rainfall for irrigation monitoring in olive ﬁelds.\n\
    Disease Monitoring\nThe LOFAR-agro Project is the best example for crop or plant\
    \ monitoring [30]. This project protects\nthe potato crop by monitoring diﬀerent\
    \ climate conditions such as temperature and humidity through\nWSN. The proposed\
    \ system protects the crop by analyzing the collected data from fungal diseases.\n\
    Environmental Condition Monitoring\nAn environmental condition monitoring system\
    \ is proposed in [34] that measures the spatial\nsampling of humidity sensors\
    \ using WSN. To determine the behavior of 2D correlation, a historical\ndatabase\
    \ is being used in the proposed system. Moreover, another environmental conditions\
    \ monitoring\nsystem is proposed in [35] that integrates forecasting and drought\
    \ monitoring musing IoT.\nCrop and Plant Growth Monitoring\nIn this sub-domain,\
    \ farmlands have been analyzed by using the mobile sensors presented in [94].\n\
    The essential purpose of this proposed system is to monitor the growth of grapes\
    \ and control plans\nfor viticulture activities. To monitor apple orchards, researchers\
    \ proposed an eﬃcient and intelligent\nmonitoring system that provides suggestions\
    \ based on the sensed data [95]. The basic purpose of this\nproposed system is\
    \ to decrease the management costs, improve the quality of apples, and protect\
    \ from\npest attacks. It is a WSN-based system that is designed by using ZigBee\
    \ and GPRS to monitor the\ngrowth of apples.\nTemperature Monitoring\nSoil temperature\
    \ plays a vital role in crop productivity. In [96], a system has been proposed\n\
    to monitor the amount of nutrients between surface and ground water. To measure\
    \ the quantity of\nnutrients in soil, electrochemical impedance was applied. Soil\
    \ test results are monitored through\nan inductance (L), capacitance (C), and\
    \ resistance (R) (LCR) meter, and the results are calculated via\nstandard library\
    \ measurements.\nElectronics 2020, 9, 319\n21 of 41\nHumidity Monitoring\nThe\
    \ humidity level is measured in air by using multiple humidity sensors. An inappropriate\n\
    amount of humidity leaves a negative impact on plants regarding cell growth [36].\n\
    Monitoring Gases in Greenhouse\nAgriculture and greenhouse gases are related to\
    \ each other. The excessive amount of gases in a\ngreenhouse increases the temperature,\
    \ which directly impacts the agriculture productivity. To monitor\nthe greenhouse\
    \ gases and CH4, a WSN and solar powered Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) system\n\
    has been presented [37].\nFertilization and Pest Control\nIn this domain, an IoT\
    \ solution provides conservation approaches to improve the quality of the\ncrops\
    \ and amount of nutrients usage. An online climate monitoring system has been\
    \ presented for\ngreenhouses to monitor pests, irrigation, fertilization, and\
    \ climate [33]. The system use WSN to gather\nand analyze sensed data for eﬃcient\
    \ analysis.\nGreenhouse Illumination Control\nAn automated agriculture system\
    \ is developed to monitor the growth of cabbages and melons in\ngreenhouses [38].\
    \ The designed system monitors the crop growing process and controls the greenhouse\n\
    environmental conditions such as temperature, ambient light, and humidity.\nLocation\
    \ Tracking\nThis sub-domain referred to the tracking and tracing of animal locations\
    \ and any unwanted\nmovement all over the ﬁeld. Diﬀerent monitoring devices and\
    \ sensors have been deployed in the\nﬁeld to save the crop from theft and wild\
    \ attacks. For agriculture, an intrusion detection solution is\npresented in [31]\
    \ that generates an alarm and sends a text message to the farmer’s mobile when\
    \ an\nunwanted movement happens in the crop ﬁeld. Moreover, for livestock, diﬀerent\
    \ monitoring devices\nare implemented to track the animals’ locations and monitor\
    \ their activities. In [32], an IoT-based\nanimal monitoring solution is presented\
    \ that monitors the behavior of swamp deer. Moreover, a herd\nof cattle grazing\
    \ in the ﬁeld can be monitored and tracked by using RFID and WSN [97]. In this\
    \ way\nranchers can get real time monitoring of cattle’s.\n4.1.6. Assessment of\

    \ violet sensor monitors the UV rays for the eﬀective growth of crops [101]. In\
    \ the\nPIR sensor, a motion detector is ﬁxed that traces the range of a person’s\
    \ movement in the\nﬁeld. The sensor also has a light detection property: while\
    \ tracking an object, it changes\nthe rising temperature into voltage for analyzing\
    \ crop growth [102].\nSoil Moisture\nSensor\nThe soil sensor measures the quantity\
    \ of water and level of moisture all over the ﬁeld [103].\nIn [104], a wireless\

    \ Active Radiation (PAR)\ntechnology can be deployed at any location of ﬁeld to\
    \ monitor the temperature, CO2, and\nhumidity [106].\nHumidity\nSensor\nHumidity\
    \ leaves a negative impact on the growth of plant leaves, photosynthesis, and\n\
    pollination. Therefore, to sense the level of humidity in air, this sensor directly\
    \ measures\nthe temperature and moisture content in the air [107]. Groﬁt provides\
    \ diﬀerent climate\nmonitoring devices that can monitor the air temperature, air\

    agriculture. Moreover, technologists are using the datasets of the USDA to improve\
    \ and design the\nexisting agriculture services for water distribution [123].\n\
    Thailand\nThe National Electronics and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC) in\
    \ Thailand is implementing\nIoT technology to develop the smart farming, and their\
    \ main focus is on four agriculture products,\nnamely: rice, rubber, cassava,\
    \ and sugar [124]. The basic aim of this movement by the Thailand\ngovernment\
    \ is to facilitate the farmers in all rural areas for the eﬃcient growth of crops\
    \ [125].\nIndia\nThe Indian government has made several IoT policies to boost\
    \ up their agriculture over the globe.\nTheir major focus is to measure the soil\
    \ conditions, parameters, temperature, and earth density in order\nto help the\
    \ farmers control the pest and crop diseases. The Ministry of Communication and\
    \ Information\nTechnology released a policy in 2015 to transform the agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld by utilizing IoT [126].\nPhilippines\nThe Philippines used remote sensing\
    \ techniques in order to boost the rice production and satellite\nimaginary techniques\
    \ to get information about multiple agricultural conditions. The University of\n\
    Southeastern Philippines (USeP) developed a smart solution to measure the crop\
    \ heat stress through\nIoT technology by collaborating with Western Mindanao State\

    An IoT smart farming agricultural framework has been proposed in Figure 9 that\
    \ consists of ﬁve\nmajor components, which are data acquisition, common platform,\
    \ data processing, data visualization,\nand system management. The data acquisition\
    \ component consists of the converged network that is\nformed by multiple communications\
    \ networks. The transmission media may be wired technology\nsuch as a controller\

    \ was announced in 2016, which will revolutionize\nthe agriculture monitoring\
    \ process by providing high-speed data transmission, network control, and\nenergy\
    \ consumption. Moreover, the data acquisition component not only transmits the\
    \ agricultural\nrelated information collected from the data visualization component,\
    \ but also sends the control\ncommands to the system management.\nA common platforms\
    \ component is responsible for decision making, data storage, and statistical\n\
    analysis on agricultural data by implementing various models and algorithms for\
    \ the agricultural\nproduction process. The component has been further divided\
    \ into sub-components, namely: (i) Edge\nComputing, (ii) Cloud Computing, and\
    \ (iii) Big Data. Big data technology makes predictive analysis\nby ﬁnding the\
    \ internal links among the data, which are collected through information mining\
    \ and\nother resources.\nMoreover, it also provides data support for new operations\
    \ and performs multiple processing\ntechniques such as image processing, statistical\
    \ analysis, simulation, prediction, early warning, and\nmodeling [93]. Cloud Computing\
    \ provides software services, hardware services, infrastructure services,\nand\
    \ platform services to diﬀerent IoT agricultural applications. The cloud platform\
    \ oﬀers cheap\ndata storage services to the farmers such as image, text, videos,\
    \ and other agricultural data, which\nfacilitates the agricultural enterprises\
    \ by reducing storage cost [42]. Moreover, it is a diﬃcult task to\nmake the direct\
    \ use of raw agricultural data for decision making on the basis of farmers’ technical\n\
    expertise. In contrast, agricultural experts can also give suggestions and make\
    \ accurate judgments\nbased on quantitative analysis. Therefore, only cloud computing\
    \ provides an intelligent and secure\nplatform for monitoring crop [128] Although\
    \ the cloud platform helps the farmer through its advance\ntechniques, still,\
    \ there are some limitations due to which farmers face technology losses related\
    \ to\ninternet connectivity and low power. Edge computing is one of the new computing\
    \ models that\nperform the calculations at the edge of the network. This platform\
    \ also reduces the computational\nload by improving data transmission speed and\
    \ protects agricultural data because processing in edge\ncomputing occurs more\
    \ compared to cloud computing [76,129].\nData processing consists of audio, video,\
    \ text image processing, and many other processing\ntechniques. These features\
    \ may be added or removed according to the system requirements.\nData visualization\
    \ is one of the most visible components in the IoT agricultural ﬁeld, which consists\n\
    of monitoring, controlling, and tracking/tracing. The monitoring function includes\
    \ environmental\nconditions monitoring, crop and plants growth monitoring, disease\
    \ monitoring, soil monitoring, and\nanimal health monitoring. The controlling\
    \ function controls the diﬀerent agricultural parameters such as\npest, fertilization,\
    \ and greenhouse illumination control. Moreover the tracking/tracing sub-component\n\
    tracks the animals and ﬁeld location. The whole monitoring, controlling, and tracking\
    \ process is\ncontrolled is through a controller and managed through the system\
    \ management component.\nThe system management component includes various kinds\
    \ of actuators, sensors, microcontrollers,\nand drone controllers. The most commonly\
    \ used sensors/devices are environmental conditions\nmonitoring sensors, crop/plant\
    \ monitoring sensors, and animal health monitoring sensors/devices.\nThese sensors\
    \ collect information about diﬀerent agricultural variables, and this collected\
    \ information\nis processed through embedded devices to make the proper analysis\
    \ for smart farming.\nElectronics 2020, 9, 319\n30 of 41\n5.3. State-of-the-Art\
    \ IoT Agricultural Solutions in the Market\nAccording to the report of Finistere\
    \ Ventures, more than 2 billion dollars have been invested\naround the globe in\
    \ AgTech, which is expected to increase in the coming years [130]. As IoT is gaining\n\
    is importance in diﬀerent applications of smart farming, almost all of the top\
    \ technology ﬁrms are\ninvesting and supporting this technology in their own way\
    \ to develop innovation in the agriculture\nﬁeld. Table 10 represents the diﬀerent\
    \ IoT agricultural solutions proposed by the top technologies ﬁrms.\nTable 10.\
    \ Available solutions and initiatives regarding IoT in agriculture.\nIndustries\n\
    Initiatives and Solutions\nSamsung\nSamsung takes the initiative in the ﬁeld of\
    \ IoT by providing its Samsung Data Systems\n(SDS) IoT Platform, which connects\
    \ the multiple IoT devices and communication protocols\nsuch as Modbus, Zigbee,\
    \ Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), MQTT, and LoRaWAN [131].\nAeroFarms\nAeroFarms provides\
    \ indoor farming solutions by analyzing data related to plants into data\nthrough\
    \ big data, imaging, and artiﬁcial intelligence technologies [132].\nMicrosoft\n\
    Microsoft also works on data-driven farming techniques by resolving the issues\
    \ from cloud\nto sensor [133]. The Bosch technology ﬁrm provides diﬀerent sensors\
    \ analytics techniques\nand IoT-based data management techniques to monitor the\
    \ crop productivity and\ndiseases [134].\nR- Style Lab\nR- Style Lab is the top\
    \ IoT software-providing company that oﬀers multiple software\nsolutions such\
    \ as predictive maintenance, drone’s inspections, and crop/animal monitoring\n\
    solutions, and it provides some embedded software that can easily be integrated\
    \ into\nportable trackers [135,136].\nIBM\nIBM has provide an AI-based service\
    \ called Watson Decision, which is best solution to\nimprove the sustainability,\
    \ harvesting, and quality of smart farming by using IoT and AI\ntechnologies [137].\n\
    Intel\nIntel has been developed an IoT-based platform Inﬁswift, which helps increase\
    \ the\neﬃciency of agricultural solutions through advanced connected services\
    \ [138].\nGoogle\nGoogle has suggested a vision for advanced agricultural solutions\
    \ by joining the MIT\nMedia Lab Open Agriculture Initiative to provide a healthier\
    \ food system [139].\n6. Open Issues and Challenges\nThere are many open issues\
    \ and challenges that are associated with the implementation of\nIoT applications.\
    \ Some of the challenges that are identiﬁed from the literature have been discussed\
    \ in\nthis section.\n6.1. Security\nSecurity issues arise at a diﬀerent level\
    \ of IoT-based agricultural systems, which need to be\naddressed. Due to low security,\
    \ users face many diﬃculties such as loss of data and other on-ﬁeld\nparameters.\
    \ IoT privacy and security issues have been discussed in [140–142] broadly. In\
    \ the agriculture\nﬁeld, IoT devices are at risk due to physical interference\
    \ such as attack by animals and predators or\nmodiﬁcation in physical address\
    \ [142,143]. Moreover, due to low energy consumption and limited\nmemory, it is\
    \ hard to implement sophisticated and complex algorithms. The precision farming\
    \ services\nsuch as IoT-enabled location information and location-based services\
    \ are exposed to hackers that\nmay use this information for device capturing [141,142,144].\
    \ Attackers attack the IoT device and\ntake out cryptographic implementations.\
    \ Other communication layers also undergo some vulnerable\ndenial-of-service (DoS)\
    \ attacks and wireless signal blocking [142]. Major security threats to the cloud\n\
    infrastructure are hijacking attacks, session hijacking, database issues, and\
    \ denial of service attack [142].\nElectronics 2020, 9, 319\n31 of 41\n6.2. Cost\n\
    While deploying IoT in agriculture, several cost-related issues arise such as\
    \ setup and running\ncosts. The setup costs consist of hardware costs such as\
    \ IoT devices/sensors, base station infrastructure,\nand gateways. Moreover, running\
    \ costs includes an uninterrupted subscription for the management of\nIoT devices,\
    \ the exchange of information among other services, and centralized services that\
    \ provide\ninformation/data collection [47].\n6.3. Lack Knowledge of Technology\n\
    Poor understanding of technology is the main barrier among the farmers who are\
    \ living in rural\nareas. This problem is common in developing countries, where\
    \ most farmers are uneducated [145].\nThe implementation of IoT in agriculture\
    \ is a big challenge, because a lot of investment is required in\nfarmer’s training\
    \ before deploying IoT infrastructure.\n6.4. Reliability\nIn the ﬁeld of agriculture,\
    \ IoT devices are deployed in an open environment due to which harsh\nenvironmental\
    \ conditions may cause communication failure and the humiliation of deployed sensors.\n\
    Therefore, it is important to ensure the physical safety of deployed IoT devices/sensors\
    \ to protect them\nfrom severe climate conditions [146].\n6.5. Scalability\nA\
    \ large number of IoT devices and sensors are deployed in the agriculture ﬁeld,\
    \ due to which an\nintelligent IoT management system is required for the identiﬁcation\
    \ and controlling of each node [147].\n6.6. Localization\nThere are many factors\
    \ that need to be considered while deploying devices/sensors. Such devices\nshould\
    \ have the ability to provide functionality and support to the rest of the world\
    \ without deploying\nadditional devices with overhead conﬁguration [148].\nMoreover,\
    \ it is important to select the\nbest deployment position so that devices can\
    \ communicate and exchange information without\nany interference.\n6.7. Interoperability\n\
    There are billions of IoT devices, standards, and protocols that are needed to\
    \ interoperate.\nInteroperability involves semantic, syntactic, technical, and\
    \ organizational policy. Semantic interoperability\nis the ability to deal with\
    \ the interpretation of content exchanged among humans. Syntactical interoperability\n\
    is related to data formats, such as java script object notation (JSON), data interchanged\
    \ electronically,\nextensible markup language (XML), and variables separated by\
    \ a comma. Technical interoperability\nis associated with the development of infrastructure,\
    \ protocols, and hardware/software components\nthat enable the IoT devices’ communication.\
    \ Organizational interoperability is related to policies for\ncommunicating and\
    \ transferring data effectively across the different geographic regions and infrastructure.\n\
    Whereas, in [149], three methods have been proposed through which interoperability\
    \ can also be obtained,\nwhich are (i) two standards open and close, (ii) partnership\
    \ among services and product developers, and\n(iii) mediator and adaptors services.\
    \ More research work is expected to obtain a high interoperability\namong multiple\
    \ IoT devices.\n7. Integration Challenges of IoT and Cloud Computing in Agriculture\n\
    The aim of the cloud-based IoT paradigm is to analyze and integrate the data that\
    \ is coming from\nthe real world into IoT objects. This paradigm requires interacting\
    \ with millions of end devices that\nare thoroughly distributed [110]. Although\
    \ the cloud platform helps the farmer through its advance\ntechniques, still,\
    \ there are some limitations due to which farmers face technology loss related\
    \ to internet\nElectronics 2020, 9, 319\n32 of 41\nconnectivity, low-power communication\
    \ devices, and many other integration challenges. Moreover,\nthe monitoring and\
    \ controlling processes have made the data sharing of IoT devices more diﬃcult,\n\
    because IoT communication devices face connectivity issues and latency problems\
    \ [111]. Some of the\nnetworking challenges that users face while assessing and\
    \ uploading the information on cloud are\ngiven in Table 11.\nTable 11. Mapping\
    \ problems and solutions regarding IoT and cloud computing integration.\nYear\n\
    Reference\nProblems\nSolutions\n2016\n[150]\nIt has become very diﬃcult to handle\
    \ the\ndata-generating devices and\npower-constrained sensors, in order to\nobtain\
    \ the more valuable services.\nThe cloud of things (CoTs) solution has been\n\
    presented to handle the increasing demand of\ndata-generating devices and other\n\
    communication resources underlying the\nWSNs.\n2016\n[151]\nIoT consist of millions\
    \ of interconnected\ndevices such as WSAN, RFID etc. in\norder to exchange the\
    \ agricultural\ninformation; therefore, cloud computing\ntechnology is necessary\
    \ due to the\nconnectivity limitations in this ﬁeld.\nAuthors presented a survey\
    \ on cloud\ninfrastructures, cloud platforms, and\nIoT middleware for the integration\
    \ of devices\nand communication protocols.\n2013\n[152]\nDue to the adaptation\
    \ of a large number\nof wireless technologies, IoT has stepped\nout to create\
    \ a fully integrated future\nnetwork.\nImplemented cloud solutions by using Aneka,\n\
    which is a centric vision for the convergence\nof internet, WSN, and distributed\
    \ computing.\n2013\n[153]\nThe integration of IoT and cloud\ncomputing has become\
    \ a primary need\nover the last few years to manage\ndiﬀerent power connectivity\
    \ issues.\nThe author designed a framework to procure\ndata from decentralized,\
    \ heterogeneous,\nhighly distributed, and virtual devices that\ncan be controlled,\
    \ analyzed, and managed\nautomatically.\n2014\n[154]\nThe IoT has become more\
    \ persistent due\nto which its integration with cloud\ncomputing is very important.\n\
    The integration of both technologies is not\nsimple, because diﬀerent key issues\
    \ occur\nthat people face while accessing the\ncommunication network to retrieve\
    \ or upload\ninformation to the cloud. A survey has been\npresented that highlights\
    \ the main challenges\nand provides their respective solutions.\n8. Threats to\
    \ Validity\nThere have been four kinds of threats to validity identiﬁed in this\
    \ section.\n8.1. Construct Validity\nIn the SLR, construct validity threats are\
    \ relevant to the classiﬁcation of selected studies [147,148].\nSearch keywords\
    \ have been proposed and identiﬁed by two authors, and seven terms related to\n\
    IoT agriculture have been used in the search string. However, the list is not\
    \ complete; some alternative\nand additional terms may alter the list of ﬁnal\
    \ selected papers [84]. A search string was performed\nby using IEEE Xplore, Science\
    \ Direct, Springer, MDPI, and IGI Global. According to the statistics\nof the\
    \ search engines, we have found most of the research papers related to IoT agriculture\
    \ in these\nelectronics libraries. To mitigate the risk of missing essential and\
    \ related publications, we have sought\nout the related papers in major IoT agriculture\
    \ research venues. Although the standard of the primary\nstudies decreased by\
    \ including publications that are not from top journals and conferences, it indicates\n\
    that the studies relevant to IoT have increased.\n8.2. Internal Validity\nThis\
    \ type of validity handles the extraction data analysis process, in which two\
    \ authors have\nidentiﬁed the classiﬁcation of selected papers and the data extraction\
    \ process, whereas one author\nreviewed the ﬁnal results. Data collection and\
    \ paper classiﬁcation have been made on the judgment of\nElectronics 2020, 9,\
    \ 319\n33 of 41\ntwo authors. The kappa coeﬃcient value was 0.91, which indicates\
    \ that there has been a high level of\nagreement among the authors and reduces\
    \ the dissimilarity threats signiﬁcantly by showing a similar\nunderstanding of\
    \ relevance.\n8.3. External Validity\nExternal validity is related to the generalization\
    \ of this study. The mapping results have been\nconsidered regarding the IoT domain,\
    \ and the validity of the results presented in this paper concerns\nonly the IoT\
    \ agriculture domain. The classiﬁcation of the papers and search string presented\
    \ in this\nresearch may help the practitioners as a starting point for IoT agriculture\
    \ research, and researchers can\ncategorize the addition studies accordingly.\n\
    8.4. Conclusion Validity\nThe conclusion validity threat is related to the identiﬁcation\
    \ of improper relationships that may\ngenerate an incorrect conclusion. In the\
    \ mapping study, a conclusion validity threat refers to the\ndiﬀerent elements\
    \ such as incorrect data extraction and missing studies. To decrease this threat,\
    \ the\ndata extraction and selection process have been clearly deﬁned in the previous\
    \ paragraph on internal\nvalidity. The traceability among the extracted data and\
    \ the conclusion has been strengthened through\nthe direct generation of frequency\
    \ plots and bubble plots generated from the collected data by applying\nstatistical\
    \ analysis.\n9. Conclusions\nThis article has presented a systematic literature\
    \ review that presents a discussion on selective\nhigh-quality research articles\
    \ published in the domain of IoT-based agriculture. The survey has\nbeen conducted\
    \ by employing a systematic methodology to select 67 studies. Thereafter, an analysis\n\
    of diﬀerent IoT agriculture applications, sensors/devices, and communication protocols\
    \ has been\npresented. The most promising fact is that this area of research is\
    \ being patronized by the governments\nof various countries, and many countries\
    \ have their IoT agriculture policies. Apart from this, all\nthe major components\
    \ of IoT-based agriculture have been contextualized in a framework. Lastly,\n\
    the promising future directions have been discussed for the researchers working\
    \ in the domain of\nIoT-based agriculture.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

    Phenotyping plays an important role in crop science research; the accurate and

    rapid acquisition of phenotypic information of plants or cells in different environments

    is helpful for exploring the inheritance and expression patterns of the genome
    to

    determine the association of genomic and phenotypic information to increase the

    crop yield. Traditional methods for acquiring crop traits, such as plant height,
    leaf

    color, leaf area index (LAI), chlorophyll content, biomass and yield, rely on
    manual

    sampling, which is time-consuming and laborious. Unmanned aerial vehicle remote

    sensing platforms (UAV-RSPs) equipped with different sensors have recently become

    an important approach for fast and non-destructive high throughput phenotyping
    and

    have the advantage of ﬂexible and convenient operation, on-demand access to data

    and high spatial resolution. UAV-RSPs are a powerful tool for studying phenomics
    and

    genomics. As the methods and applications for ﬁeld phenotyping using UAVs to users

    who willing to derive phenotypic parameters from large ﬁelds and tests with the
    minimum

    effort on ﬁeld work and getting highly reliable results are necessary, the current
    status and

    perspectives on the topic of UAV-RSPs for ﬁeld-based phenotyping were reviewed
    based

    on the literature survey of crop phenotyping using UAV-RSPs in the Web of ScienceTM

    Core Collection database and cases study by NERCITA. The reference for the selection

    of UAV platforms and remote sensing sensors, the commonly adopted methods and

    typical applications for analyzing phenotypic traits by UAV-RSPs, and the challenge
    for

    crop phenotyping by UAV-RSPs were considered. The review can provide theoretical

    and technical support to promote the applications of UAV-RSPs for crop phenotyping.

    High-Throughput Field-Based Phenotyping Using UAV

    INTRODUCTION

    Crop production must double by 2050 to meet the predicted

    production demands of the global population (Ray et al., 2013).

    The crop yield demands are predicted to increase by 2.4%

    annually, but the average rate of increase is only 1.3%, with

    yields stagnating in up to 40% of land under cereal production

    (Fischer and Edmeades, 2010). To ensure improved agricultural

    productivity, to adapt to the impacts of climate change, and to

    prevent the resistance of pests and diseases to control measures,

    scientists must better understand the connection between a

    plant’s observable characteristics (phenotype) and its genetic

    makeup (genotype). By establishing the connection between

    genotype and phenotype, it is possible to select high-yield stress-

    tolerant plants and improve agricultural production to satisfy the

    requirements of the growing human population (White et al.,

    2012; Li L. et al., 2014; Thorp et al., 2015). In the last two

    decades, gene sequencing of crops has proceeded at a rapid

    pace, but the translation of these data into the identiﬁcation

    of desirable traits is constrained by the lack of knowledge of

    the associated phenotypes (Furbank and Tester, 2011; Zaman-

    Allah et al., 2015). To relieve this bottleneck and to fully beneﬁt

    from the available genomic information, reliable, automatic,

    multifunctional, and high-throughput phenotyping platforms

    should be developed to oﬀer plant scientists new insight into

    all the aspects of living plants. In recent years, rapid high-

    throughput phenotyping platforms (HTPPs) have been discussed

    (Yang et al., 2013; Araus and Cairns, 2014), and most are

    fully automated facilities in greenhouses or growth chambers

    with precise environmental control. Although HTPPs enable the

    capture of detailed, non-invasive information throughout the

    plant life cycle, the results from controlled environments are

    distinct from the actual situations that plants will experience

    in the ﬁeld, making it diﬃcult to extrapolate the data to the

    ﬁeld.

    Field-based phenotyping (FBP) is a critical component of crop

    improvement through genetics, as it is the ultimate expression

    of the relative eﬀects of genetic factors, environmental factors,

    and their interaction on critical production traits, such as yield

    potential and tolerance to abiotic/biotic stresses (Araus and

    Cairns, 2014; Neilson et al., 2015). FBP is increasingly recognized

    as the only approach capable of delivering the required

    throughput and an accurate description of trait expression

    in real-world cropping systems. The performance of breeding

    programs on crop yield and productivity must be evaluated under

    natural conditions (Gonzalez-Recio et al., 2014; Gonzalez-Dugo

    et al., 2015; Rahaman et al., 2015). Currently, the most commonly

    ﬁeld-based phenotyping platforms (FBPPs) use ground wheeled

    or aerial vehicles deploying multiple types of sensors to measure

    plant traits on a timescale of a few seconds per plot. For FBPPs

    based on ground vehicles, the process is time-consuming if there

    are too many plots needed to collect data (Zhang and Kovacs,

    2012). For example, more than 40 h were required to cover the

    20,000 plots with a single vehicle traveling at 2 km per h to

    measure traits on single rows (White et al., 2012). Using multiple

    vehicles and multiple sets of sensors to take measurements in

    all plots simultaneously would increase the costs (Zhang and

    Kovacs, 2012; Cobb et al., 2013). Moreover, FBPPs with ground

    vehicles cannot be used for cross-regional work due to the

    lack of maneuvrability. In the recent years, the cable-suspended

    ﬁeld phenotyping platform was developed for rapid and non-

    destructive estimation of crop traits. For the cable-suspend ﬁeld-

    based phenotyping platform, there’s advantages of safety, high

    precision, independent of soil conditions and minimal tactile

    interference of plants. However, as it has to be located at certain

    sites, the coverable area of cable-suspend ﬁeld phenotyping

    platform is relatively low, which limit its applications for the

    large-scale phenotyping (Kirchgessner et al., 2016). Some of these

    limitations can be addressed using satellite-based or aerial remote

    sensing approaches.

    Satellite imaging technologies have become an extremely

    useful tool for collecting data for various agricultural applications

    (Li L. et al., 2014; Sankaran et al., 2015b). However, the major

    limitations of using the currently available satellite sensors are

    the high cost, the lack of spatial resolution for the identiﬁcation

    of desirable traits, the risk of cloudy scenes and the long revisit

    periods (Issei et al., 2010; Gevaert et al., 2015). Alternatives based

    on manned airborne platforms have demonstrated capabilities

    for large-scale crop condition monitoring due to the high spatial

    and spectral resolutions of the sensors. However, in the case of

    breeding, and except for large seed companies, the high operating

    costs and the operational complexity have limited the use of

    these platforms to research activities (Chapman et al., 2014).

    Low-altitude and ﬂexible UAV-RSPs are an important, aﬀordable

    tool for crop phenotyping (Berni et al., 2009b; Liebisch et al.,

    2015)and precision agriculture (Hunt et al., 2005; Zhang and

    Kovacs, 2012; Ballesteros et al., 2014; Gomez-Candon et al., 2014;

    Candiago et al., 2015), and they provide a low-cost approach to

    meet the critical requirements of spatial, spectral, and temporal

    resolutions. In order to assess the precision and eﬃciency

    for ﬁeld-based phenotyping in small plots by diﬀerent remote

    sensing techniques, a direct comparison of three remote sensing

    High-Throughput Field-Based Phenotyping Using UAV

    approaches including UAV, proximal sensing, and satellite-based

    imagery was studied, which demonstrated that the UAV-based

    remote sensing performed best for acquiring canopy temperature

    and NDVI in breeding (Tattaris et al., 2016).Therefore, UAVs

    are becoming critical in crop phenotyping for high-throughput

    phenotyping of large numbers of plots and ﬁeld trials in a near

    real-time and dynamic manner. UAVs can be used to execute

    autonomous tasks through the use of radio remote control

    equipment and an auto-control system, which can be divided

    into several types according to the ﬂight mode (Sankaran et al.,

    2015b). Digital cameras, multispectral cameras, hyperspectral

    sensors, infrared thermal imagers, and light detection and

    ranging (LIDAR) are commonly deployed UAV-RSP sensors. The

    applications of these sensors for FBP include visible imaging for

    canopy surface modeling, crop height and biomass estimation

    (Mathews and Jensen, 2013; Diaz-Varela et al., 2014; Zarco-

    Tejada et al., 2014), visible–near-infrared spectroscopy to identify

    physiological status (Sugiura et al., 2005; Overgaard et al., 2010;

    Swain et al., 2010; Nigon et al., 2015), thermal imaging to detect

    water stress (Gonzalez-Dugo et al., 2013, 2014), LIDAR point

    cloud to measure plant ﬁne-scale geometric parameters with

    high precision (Wallace et al., 2012), and microwave images for

    estimating soil moisture and canopy structure parameters by

    combining diﬀerent spectral bands (Acevo-Herrera et al., 2010;

    Issei et al., 2010).

    The crop phenotype is an expression of the genotype

    and the environment in which it grows, including geometric

    traits (e.g., plant height, LAI, lodging, crop canopy cover),

    canopy spectral texture (spectral features), physiological traits

    (e.g., chlorophyll, biomass, pigment content, photosynthesis),

    abiotic/biotic stress indicators (e.g., stomatal conductance,

    canopy temperature diﬀerence, leaf water potential, senescence

    index), nutrients (nitrogen concentration, protein content), and

    yield. Diﬀerent methodological approaches based on spectra,

    canopy temperature, and visible light have been proposed to

    evaluate these traits in the ﬁeld (Araus and Cairns, 2014). The

    geometric traits of a crop can be estimated by building the digital

    surface model (DSM) or digital elevation model (DEM) and

    conducting image classiﬁcation analysis, which can be used to

    estimate the plant height, lodging area proportion, emergence,

    etc. (Hunt et al., 2005, 2010; Li J. W. et al., 2015). The absorption

    and reﬂectance characteristics of crops can be used to retrieve

    the physiological characteristics of a crop (Overgaard et al., 2010;

    Swain et al., 2010; Nigon et al., 2015). The canopy temperature

    is closely related to crop transpiration, which can reﬂect the leaf

    water potential, stomatal conductance, etc. under abiotic and

    biotic stress conditions. The combination of hyperspectral and

    thermal infrared data enables crop yield prediction (Berni et al.,

    2009b; Gonzalez-Dugo et al., 2015).

    This review considers the latest technological aspects of

    remote sensing from the state-of-the-art of UAVs to estimate

    plant phenotyping parameters at the ﬁeld-scale. The paper is

    organized as follows: (1) a literature survey of UAV remote

    sensing for ﬁeld-based crop phenotyping in the last decade,

    (2) an overview of low-altitude UAVs and deployed sensors,

    (3) advances and applications of UAV remote sensing in

    ﬁeld-based phenotyping, and (4) the limitations and future

    perspectives of UAV remote sensing for ﬁeld-based crop

    phenotyping.

    LITERATURE SURVEY

    There are 96 articles related to the keywords of “UAV,”

    “UAS,” “Drone,” “Unmanned Aerial Vehicle,” “Unmanned

    Aerial System,” “Unmanned Aircraft,” “Low Altitude Platform,”

    “Crop,” Plant,” “Crop breeding,” “Remote Sensing,” “Field-Based,”

    “Phenotyping,” and “Phenomics” in the Web of ScienceTM

    Core Collection Database (THOMSON REUTERSTM) until

    May 17, 2017. However, there are only six articles that

    explicitly include “Phenotyping” or “Phenomics” in the titles

    and keyword (Zaman-Allah et al., 2015; Gomez-Candon et al.,

    2016; Haghighattalab et al., 2016; Holman et al., 2016; Shi et al.,

    2016; Watanabe et al., 2017). The other literatures are closely

    related to crop phenotyping using UAV-RSPs but do not explicitly

    mention crop phenotype; the research focuses on one or more

    crop traits. The number of published articles for each year is

    shown in Figure 1A. There’s only one published articles during

    the period of 2005–2006. Most of the research focusing on ﬁeld-

    based crop phenotyping has been performed since 2007 and has

    rapidly increased each year. A total of 85 articles were published

    during the period of 2012–2017, accounting for 88.5% of the

    total literature related to FBP using UAV-RSPs. The citations

    of retrieved articles during the period of 2007–2017 are given

    in Figure 1B, showing that the number of citations from 2012

    to 2017 accounts for 94.4% of the total citations during that

    period. Considering the above literature statistics, ﬁeld-based

    crop phenotyping has become a research hotspot.

    The journals that published at least three articles related to

    the topic of this review paper are shown in Table 1. The journal

    with the greatest amount of related research ⟨⟨Remote Sensing⟩⟩

    published 17 articles, accounting for 17.7 % of all retrieved

    articles. The articles published in the journals of ⟨⟨Precision

    Agriculture⟩⟩ and ⟨⟨International Journal of Remote Sensing⟩⟩

    are 8 and 7, respectively. Most of the related articles have been

    published in journals focused on remote sensing and agriculture,

    which is consistent with the fact that the agricultural model and

    remote sensing technology are the core science and technology

    for FBP by UAV-RSP. The retrieved articles were statistically

    analyzed using the analytical tool “CiteSpace” (Chen, 2004), and

    an analysis of the keyword frequency is shown in Figure 2. The

    most frequently used keywords include “Precision agriculture,”

    “ unmanned aerial vehicle,” “UAV,” “Remote sensing,” and

    “vegetation index,” while “Phenotyping” and “Phenomics” were

    less frequently used. Even the research objectives of surveyed

    literatures focused on the crop growth monitoring, the crop

    phenotype includes numerous crop traits, such as traits related

    to the crop spectrum, structure, physiology, ecology, biotic stress,

    and abiotic stress (Pask et al., 2012). Thus, all the retrieved articles

    belonged to crop phenotyping by UAV-RSPs.

    Based on the above analysis, the development of UAV-RSPs

    for crop phenotyping has gradually become a hot topic and

    can provide theoretical and technical support for precision

    agriculture and crop breeding. In addition, there are rare reports

    on FBP using UAV-RSPs in crop breeding (Issei et al., 2010;

    Torres-Sanchez et al., 2014, 2015). There is an urgent demand to

    develop strategies to rapidly and non-destructively acquire crop

    phenotypic data based on the current agricultural remote sensing

    technology. High-throughput ﬁeld-based crop phenotyping can

    relieve the bottleneck of “linking genotype and phenotype” to

    accelerate the eﬃciency of crop breeding.

    UAV PLATFORMS AND DEPLOYED

    SENSORS

    Overview of UAV-Based Phenotyping

    Platforms

    FBP using UAV-RSPs is based on an unmanned aircraft equipped

    with multiple sensors, using communication technology and

    GPS positioning technology to rapidly and non-destructively

    acquire high-resolution images about the crop canopy in the ﬁeld.

    Remote sensing retrieval models are then used for phenotyping

    ﬁeld trials after data processing (Sugiura et al., 2005; Li W.

    et al., 2016). The typical UAVs used for FBP include multi-

    rotors, helicopters, ﬁxed-wing, blimps and ﬂying wing (Table 2;

    Sankaran et al., 2015b) and are selected based on the purpose

    and budget. Blimps have the advantages of hovering ability,

    higher eﬀective loads and the ability of vertical take-oﬀ and

    landing; however, they are slow because of the large size,

    and their stability is poor under windy conditions, making it

    diﬃcult to obtain accurate information (Liebisch et al., 2015).

    Unmanned helicopters have the advantage of being able to take-

    oﬀ and land vertically, ﬂy sideways, and hover. The helicopter

    payload is larger than that of a multi-rotor UAV and can

    support large sensors, such as LIDAR. However, the complex

    operation, lack of free hover, high maintenance cost and noise

    limit the application of helicopters (Sugiura et al., 2005; Swain

    et al., 2010; Chapman et al., 2014). The ﬁxed-wing UAV is

    characterized by fast ﬂying velocity and long ﬂight time; however,

    the bottleneck for the ﬁxed-wing application of FBP is the lack

    of free hover ability and the image blur caused by higher speeds

    and altitudes (Herwitz et al., 2004; Link et al., 2013). Multi-

    rotor UAVs have the advantages of low cost, the ability to hover,

    low take-oﬀ and landing requirements and are most frequently

    used for FBP. However, the greatest limitations of multi-rotor

    UAVs are the relatively short ﬂight time, lower payload and

    the sensitivity to weather (Zhang and Kovacs, 2012; Pena et al.,

    2013; Uto et al., 2013; Nasi et al., 2015). Traditional UAV

    manufactured body materials are metals, such as aviation steel

    and aluminum (Colomina and Molina, 2014; Salami et al., 2014;

    Pajares, 2015). To reduce the UAV weight, enhance the body

    strength and prolong ﬂight time, a variety of lightweight, high-

    strength composite materials have been widely used, including

    glass ﬁber and carbon ﬁber, and have become the main alternative

    materials for the body of UAVs. For the engine, the UAV engines

    can be divided into two categories: oil and electric engine.

    The oil engines have the advantages of strong wind resistance

    and long working time, while there’re disadvantages of being

    bulky, producing big vibration and having poor reliability, which

    lead to the image blur (Xiang and Tian, 2011; Sankaran et al.,

    2015b). The electric engines have the advantages of safe, small

    vibration, easy to maintain and low cost, which make it become

    an important way for crop phenotyping by UAV; however, the

    short ﬂight endurance time and weak wind resistance limited its

    use for crop phenotyping at large scale. A series of propulsion

    systems with the advantages of small volume, low vibration

    and new energy sources have become available and have greatly

    enhanced the UAV payload space and capacity. Hale engines and

    low-altitude silent propulsion systems are necessary to satisfy

    the requirements of small- and medium-size UAVs (Verhoeven,

    2009).

    The UAV body, ﬂight control system, remote control, sensors

    and oil/electric energy are the minimum required components

    for a UAV-RSP; while the ground station that enables the ﬂight

    route planning and ﬂight parameters setting, is an optional tool.

    The ﬂight control system of a UAV is the core of the whole ﬂight

    process, including take-oﬀ, ﬂying in the air, executing tasks and

    recovery, and is one of the key technologies of a UAV system.

    Taking the UAV-RSP that was used for ﬁeld phenotyping in

    crop breeding by NERCITA in China for example to illustrate

    the components of a UAV-RSP (Figure 3). The route planning

    tool of a UAV can set the ﬂight height, ﬂight speed, ﬂight

    location and missions, and the ﬂight details are transmitted to the

    ﬂight control system through a data transceiver, which enables

    automatic take-oﬀ, the implementation of a default route, guided

    ﬂight, and automatic landing.

    Sensors Deployed by Small UAVs

    UAV platform equipped with visible light imaging sensors,

    spectral sensors, infrared thermal sensors, ﬂuorescence sensors,

    LIDAR et al. can obtain the color, texture, geometric contour of

    crops, which can be used to monitor plant height, LAI, biomass

    and other physiological traits of crops in diﬀerent growth stages

    (Zhang and Kovacs, 2012; Rahaman et al., 2015; Table 3). As the

    equipped sensors are restricted by the UAV’s payload capacity,

    which must meet the criteria of high precision, light weight, low

    power consumption and small size. Considering the cost, UAV

    payload and technological development of commercial products,

    digital camera (RGB), multispectral camera, infrared thermal

    imager, hyperspectral camera, LIDAR, three-dimensional camera

    and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) are the main sensors

    equipped by UAV-RSPs so far (Chapman et al., 2014; Sankaran

    et al., 2015b). The UAV-RSPs adopted by NERCITA were shown

    in Figure 4.

    Digital Camera

    UAVs equipped with digital cameras can quickly acquire

    grayscale or color images to estimate crop height, leaf angel

    distribution, LAI, lodging and leaf color et al. (Ballesteros et al.,

    2014; Bendig et al., 2014; Chapman et al., 2014). RGB camera

    is the most commonly deployed by UAV in crop phenotyping

    research. The sensor has the advantages of low cost, light weight,

    convenient operation, simple data processing, and relatively low

    working environment requirements. Data can be collected under

    both sunny and cloudy conditions, but exposure should be set

    on the basis of the weather conditions to avoid inadequate

    or excessive image exposure. Unfortunately, this method is

    insuﬃcient to accurately analyse crop phenotypic information for

    physiological traits due to the limitation of the less visible light

    bands.

    High-Throughput Field-Based Phenotyping Using UAV

    The orthoimage or DSM/DEM is the ultimate product of

    aerial photography. For the digital images, as there’s signiﬁcant

    eﬀect of interior orientation elements and camera distortion

    on image quality, the inspection and distortion processing of

    images according to the camera models are required. Then the

    homogeneous treatment for images is needed to enable the

    consistency of brightness, grayscale, and texture among images.

    The second step is to match the images according to the feature

    points of each image, the scale-invariant feature transform

    (SIFT) and random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm

    were adopted to process and optimize images. Finally, as the

    UAV can’t acquire the images at large scale due to limitations

    of imaging devices and techniques, in order to evaluate the

    crop growth status throughout the study area, the orthoimage

    need to be generated using automatic splicing software, such

    as Photoscan, after aerial triangulation (Colomina and Molina,

    2014). As each pixel value of images can be calculated from the

    reﬂectance or radiance of speciﬁc bands, then the color indices

    can be extracted with high-resolution images acquired by UAV

    to identify the vegetation features (Holman et al., 2016; Du and

    Noguchi, 2017).

    Multispectral/Hyperspectral Imaging Sensor

    UAVs with spectral imaging sensors can obtain the spectral

    absorption and reﬂectance characteristics of crops, which can

    be used to monitor the crop planting area and crop growth,

    to evaluate the biological and physical characteristics of a crop,

    and to predict crop yield (Overgaard et al., 2010; Lebourgeois

    et al., 2012; Honkavaara et al., 2013; Candiago et al., 2015; Nigon

    et al., 2015). Multispectral and hyperspectral imaging sensors

    are the commonly deployed by UAV. Multispectral imaging

    sensors are deﬁned as hardware that are capable of sensing

    and recording radiation from invisible as well as visible parts

    of the electromagnetic spectrum, which have been widely used

    for crop phenotyping due to the advantages of low cost, fast

    frame imaging and high work eﬃciency; however, they are

    limited by the low number of bands, low spectral resolution,

    and discontinuous spectrum (Berni et al., 2009b; Issei et al.,

    2010; Overgaard et al., 2010; Diaz-Varela et al., 2014; Candiago

    et al., 2015). Hyperspectral imaging sensors are cameras that can

    obtain a large number of very narrow bands and continuous

    spectra. Compared with multispectral imagers, hyperspectral

    imagers have the advantages of more band information and

    higher spectral resolution and can accurately reﬂect the spectral

    characteristics of the crop in the ﬁeld and the spectral diﬀerences

    between crops (Zarco-Tejada et al., 2012, 2013; Colomina

    and Molina, 2014). In recent years, hyperspectral imaging has

    become a common way to acquire crop traits, such as crop

    water content, leaf nitrogen concentration, chlorophyll content,

    LAI, and other physical and chemical parameters, to facilitate

    crop yield prediction. Hyperspectral imaging technology is the

    future trend for crop phenotyping research using UAV-RSPs;

    however, the applicability of the physical inversion model based

    on hyperspectral remote sensing, the complex mechanisms of

    mixed spectral decomposition models for many kinds of ﬁeld

    components (crop, soil, etc.) and an element extraction method

    require further research (Overgaard et al., 2010; Thorp et al.,

    FIGURE 4 | The UAV-RSPs adopted by NERCITA for ﬁeld phenotyping in crop

    breeding. (A) A DJI Spreading Wings S1000+ equipped with hyperspectral

    imager (Cubert UHD185), thermal infrared imager (Optris PI400) and digital

    camera (Sony DSC-QX100); (B) A RIEGL RiCOPTER equipped with LIDAR

    (RIEGL VUX-1UAV) (Consent obtained from the individual for the publication).

    2015). The pre-processing of spectral images mainly contains

    the radiometric calibration, geometric correction, image fusion

    and image enhancement. Then the spectral reﬂectance can be

    extracted using software, such as ArcGis, ENVI, etc. to build

    vegetation indices for retrieving crop phenotypic traits (Nasi

    et al., 2015).

    Thermal Infrared Imaging Sensor

    Thermal infrared imaging sensors that using infrared detectors

    and an optical imaging lens to receive infrared radiation

    energy in the photosensitive element infrared detector can

    produce time series or single-time-point analysis based data,

    which have been widely used for crop growth monitoring and

    water stress detection (Gonzalez-Dugo et al., 2013, 2015). As

    the stomatal conductance, photosynthetic characteristics and

    transpiration rate are closely related to canopy temperature, the

    infrared thermal imaging technology can be used to determine

    the response of crops under stress conditions (Baluja et al.,

    2012). The conventional method for the determination of crop

    canopy temperature is using a handheld infrared thermometer,

    which is diﬃcult to perform in the crop canopy temperature

    under diﬀerent experimental conditions simultaneously, making

    it diﬃcult to compare the diﬀerence in canopy temperature

    between treatments because the crop canopy temperature

    changes over time. In addition, the selection of the area for

    measurement is subjective and random (Berni et al., 2009b).

    UAVs equipped with infrared thermal imagers can quickly

    and non-destructively acquire the crop canopy temperature,

    which can eﬀectively identify the temperature diﬀerences in

    the crop canopy under diﬀerent environmental conditions. The

    thermal sensitivity is generally less than 80 mK. However, as the

    canopy temperature is sensitive to the environmental conditions,

    eliminating the inﬂuence of background temperature, including

    the incoming solar radiation, the ambient air temperature and the

    wind speed, is required (Sugiura et al., 2007; Deery et al., 2014).

    The most commonly adopted methods for achieving the goal

    include using sheet backgrounds to eliminate the background

    temperature, determining the percentage of bare soil and covered

    leaves in each image (Jones et al., 2009), and masking the data

    over a known background temperature (Chapman et al., 2014).

    High-Throughput Field-Based Phenotyping Using UAV

    As directly using the surface temperature of crop canopy for

    retrieving stomatal conductance or water potential is risky for the

    reason of inﬂuence soil pixels. In addition, canopy temperature

    on its own is not suﬃcient to derive stress, evapotranspiration or

    other similar parameters (Ortega-Farias et al., 2016). Therefore,

    it is needed to perform the whole energy balance, taking into

    account air temperature, wind speed, wind direction, etc. For the

    thermal infrared image processing, diﬀerent methods including

    eliminating all pixels outside the expected temperature range for

    the leaves and using automated thresholding algorithms such

    as the Otsu method have been adopted to automatically extract

    canopy temperature (Gonzalez-Dugo et al., 2013). However, the

    presence of mixed pixels (pixel containing signals from both

    soil and vegetation) is a big problem for heterogeneous canopy

    (Baluja et al., 2012). The inﬂuence of mixed soil pixels can be

    reduced with thermal infrared data fusion with RGB image.

    However, the data fusion for image pre-processing is consuming

    and subjective.

    LIDAR

    LIDAR is a surveying method that measures distance to a target

    with emitting laser light. It is an active remote sensing device

    that uses the laser as the transmitting light source and adopts

    the photoelectric detection method. LIDAR is composed of a

    transmitter, receiver, tracking frame and information processing

    module, which has the advantages of high point density, high

    spatial resolution, smaller and lighter than traditional microwave

    radar, and good performance for low-altitude detection (Wallace

    et al., 2012). As the emitted pulse interacts with the canopy

    portions of it are returned by diﬀerent elements, and the time

    delay between them provide the information about the horizontal

    and vertical canopy structure parameters. Simple LIDARs only

    measure ﬁrst and last returns, while full-waveform ones return

    the photon density for a range of time delays. The limitations of

    LIDAR include the high cost, narrow beam, large data processing,

    and laser pulse can be totally absorbed by water, which greatly

    aﬀect the popularity and application of LIDAR technology.

    LIDAR has been applied to estimate biomass and plant height

    of trees, and there are few applications of crop phenotyping

    using LIDAR (Ota et al., 2015). The methods used for extracting

    structural parameters in the forest are not suit for crop, because

    the plant height of crop is too low and the pattern of leaves

    aggregation was plant centered. Thus, it’s necessary to explore

    strategies for extracting crop structural parameters by LIDAR.

    SAR

    SAR is an imaging radar used for conducting coherent processing

    of the received echo in diﬀerent locations to obtain high-

    resolution data. SAR is a type of active microwave sensor that

    can be categorized into two types, focused and non-focused.

    SAR can obtain high-resolution radar images similar to optical

    images in very low visibility weather conditions and can work

    around the clock, which can be used for crop identiﬁcation,

    crop acreage monitoring, key crop trait estimation and yield

    prediction, providing strong technical support for large-scale

    crop growth monitoring by remote sensing (Rosen et al., 2006;

    Wang et al., 2014).

    In summary, UAVs deploy sensors with the advantages of

    ﬂexible and convenient operation, on-demand access to data and

    high spatial resolution as an important means to rapidly and

    non-destructively acquire ﬁeld-based crop phenotypes. However,

    because the remote sensing information from a single sensor

    is limited, combining multi-sensors to acquire and integrate

    data is necessary for ﬁeld-based crop phenotyping by UAV-

    RSPs. In addition, as the image quality can be inﬂuence by wind

    speed, ﬂight altitude and speed, sensor performance, aircraft

    vibration and image correction method etc., exploring strategies

    for acquiring images with high quality is necessary. The ability

    to eﬃciently process “big” remote sensing data acquired by UAV

    remains a challenge, as well as the ability to develop robust and

    fast algorithms according to the sensors used.

    Universal Data Processing Methods

    The pre-processing of remote sensing images is the basis for

    retrieving crop phenotype by UAV Remote Sensing. As there exist

    geometric and radiation distortion for remote sensing images,

    which were caused by the atmosphere, sensor characteristics,

    UAV attitude et al. Thus, it’s necessary to eliminate the geometric

    and radiation distortion before retrieving crop phenotype by

    remote sensing images. Geometric and radiometric correction

    are two basic pre-processing techniques for UAV remote sensing

    data.

    Geometric Correction

    There usually contains geometric deformation for the original

    images obtained by the UAV remote sensing platform due to

    the inﬂuence of the attitude and speed of UAV platform, the

    displacement of surface elevation model and the change of

    observed projection. Thus, the geometric correction of UAV

    remote sensing images is a prerequisite for subsequent data

    processing and analysis. The commonly adopted methods for

    geometric correction can be divided into two categories: (1)

    Geometric correction based on UAV POS Data (Yang et al., 2015);

    (2) Geometric correction based on high precision diﬀerential

    GPS (Saskia et al., 2017). The ground control points must be

    set for the traditional method, while the geometric correction

    can be achieved using low precision POS data of the UAV

    without setting ground points, which can improve the eﬃciency

    of UAV remote sensing images processing. DEM has been widely

    used in monitoring crop height and biomass, which usually

    can be generated with methods, such as moving surface ﬁtting,

    multi-faceted function and ﬁnite element method for DEM

    interpolation (Liang et al., 2013).

    Spectral Radiation Processing

    The electromagnetic energy received by the UAV deployed

    sensors is inconsistent with the physical reﬂectance or the

    spectral radiation brightness of the target due to the atmospheric

    conditions, the physical characteristics of the sensor, the sun’s

    position and the angle of measurement (Zhao et al., 2014).

    Therefore, in order to correctly reﬂect the spectral reﬂectance

    or radiation characteristics, radiation correction is required

    to eliminate or correct the various noise attached to the

    sensor’s output radiant energy in the process of remote sensing

    High-Throughput Field-Based Phenotyping Using UAV

    imaging. Spectral radiation calibration refers to the process

    of converting a digital number (DN) of images acquired by

    UAV deployed sensors into physical parameters (Liang, 2008),

    such as radiation brightness, reﬂectance or surface temperature,

    which includes relative calibration and absolute calibration.

    The commonly adopted reﬂectance conversion methods include

    linear regression model, ﬂat ﬁeld model, internal mean method,

    logarithmic residual model and dark target method et al. The

    atmospheric correction can be neglected as the atmosphere

    between the surface and the sensor has a weak inﬂuence

    on the radiation of the sensor entrance with the relatively

    low ﬂight attitude of micro-UAV (Hernandez-Lopez et al.,

    2012). The spectral reﬂectance or vegetation indices derived

    from hyperspectral images were inﬂuenced by the angular

    view of UAV-deployed sensors. Radiative transfer models can

    be act as useful tools for correcting angular inﬂuences over

    vegetated environments (Burkart et al., 2015). Spectral feature

    extraction is the process of the decomposition, reconstruction

    and selection of the spectral measurement, which can be divided

    into three categories, namely the statistical reduction method,

    the characteristic spectral line method and the spectral line

    method according to the characteristic expression formula (Li,

    2012). The statistical reduction method is the most widely used

    method for spectral feature extraction, which has the advantages

    of easy to operate and use, while there’s the disadvantage

    of lack of physical meaning. The commonly used statistical

    reduction methods include principal component analysis,

    wavelet transform, manifold learning and supervised correlation

    vector machine, support vector machine and discriminant

    analysis (Laliberte et al., 2011). The essence of the method is

    the decomposition, reorganization and selection of the celestial

    radiant energy in order to remove redundant noise, and convert

    the signal into the pattern easy to process in the subsequent

    application. The advantage of the feature spectrum method is

    that the good physical meaning, but it is often computationally

    intensive and ineﬃcient. The results lack of representation for the

    spectral characteristics when there’s more spectral times and less

    observation data. There’s also the advantage of strong physical

    meaning for the spectral line method, however, it’s sensitive to

    the spectral complexity and instrument calibration (Liang et al.,

    2013).

    Universal Modeling Methods

    The main adopted methods for crop phenotyping by UAV remote

    sensing include image analysis, physical model method, empirical

    statistic method and advanced data analysis method, such as

    machine learning (Liang et al., 2013; Bendig et al., 2015). As

    the modern imaging techniques can allow for the visualization

    of multi-dimensional and multi-parameter data, the high-

    resolution images acquired by UAV remote sensing platform

    have been used for estimating crop structure characteristics

    using image analysis method (Torres-Sanchez et al., 2015). The

    objected-based image analysis method works with groups of

    homogeneous and contiguous pixels, which can help to solve

    the problem that the spectral similarity of crop and weed

    pixels in early growth stages (Sankaran et al., 2015b). The

    general description of the procedure for image analysis include

    image acquisition, segmentation and classiﬁcation (Mathews,

    2014). Imaging analysis algorithms are the primary drivers for

    extracting statistical data to quantify the phenotype. Typical

    segmentation algorithms are based on a color model and

    threshold value (Li L. et al., 2014). In order to accelerate the

    working eﬃciency, the automatic object-based methods have

    been highlighted as the UAV can acquired massive image

    data. The thresholding OBIA algorithm is essential for the

    automatic vegetation classiﬁcation (Torres-Sanchez et al., 2015).

    As the physical inversion model, such as radiative transfer

    model, refer to complex problems of the leaf and canopy

    structure, radiation transmission, the combination of radiative

    transfer mechanism and spectral absorption characteristics of

    biochemical component is required to retrieve crop phenotype.

    For example, the PROSAIL model combined with spectral

    data were used for monitoring the LAI of wheat (Bendig

    et al., 2015). The crop phenotypic traits, such as crop canopy

    cover, LAI, chlorophyll content, plant nutrient, water content,

    biomass and yield et al., can be rapidly acquired using empirical

    statistical models with various vegetation indices. The commonly

    adopted empirical statistical methods for high-throughput ﬁeld

    phenotyping include multiple linear regression, partial least

    squares regression and stepwise linear regression (Richards,

    1990). Using advanced data analysis methods, such as principal

    component analysis (PCA), artiﬁcial neural network (ANN),

    support vector machine (SVM), and wavelet analysis (WA)

    et al., can be act as an important method to improve the

    prediction accuracy of the retrieval models. However, there’re

    disadvantages of the lack of explicit regression relations, the time-

    consuming calculation process, which greatly limit its eﬃciency

    and application scope (Zhao et al., 2014). The empirical statistical

    models are widely used and eﬀective in the research of UAV

    Remote Sensing for ﬁeld-based phenotyping according to the

    literature survey, but the applications were limited by the

    higher demand on practical surveying data and lack of physical

    meaning. For the machine learning, the obvious drawback is the

    lack of the ability to interpret data, which make it diﬃcult to

    exploit the advantages of machine learning.

    ADVANCES OF UAV REMOTE SENSING IN

    FIELD PHENOTYPING

    The crop phenotype is deﬁned as the physiological and

    biochemical characteristics and traits that are inﬂuenced by the

    genetic information of the crop and environmental factors, and it

    can be divided into diﬀerent levels, such as groups, individuals,

    organs, tissues and cells (Cobb et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2013;

    Araus and Cairns, 2014). The crop phenotype is closely related to

    crop production and crop breeding. Rapid and non-destructive

    acquisition of the phenotypic information of crops in the ﬁeld

    is an important prerequisite for studying the genetic inheritance

    law and accelerating the eﬃciency of large-scale crop breeding

    (Yang et al., 2013). The traditional methods for measuring

    crop traits, such as biomass, LAI and yield, depend on manual

    sampling, which is time consuming, ineﬃcient, and inaccurate

    (Berni et al., 2009b; Rahaman et al., 2015; Li W. et al., 2016).

    High-Throughput Field-Based Phenotyping Using UAV

    There are deﬁnite advantages for ﬁeld-based crop phenotyping

    based on UAV-RSPs, including high technical eﬃciency, low cost,

    suitability for complex ﬁeld environments, timely ﬁeld work,

    high-resolution data acquisition, rapid identiﬁcation of growth

    information, synchronous image acquisition, and high operating

    eﬃciency. UAV-RSPs have been widely used for ﬁeld-based

    crop phenotyping as an important tool for high-throughput

    phenotyping to assist crop research (Table 4). However, there’s

    still the lack of validation of ﬁeld-based phenotyping by

    UAV remote sensing with massive germplasm (over 1,000

    plots).

    Crop Geometric Traits

    Geometric traits, such as crop height (Bareth et al., 2016; Holman

    et al., 2016), vegetation cover fraction (Weiss and Baret, 2017;

    Yu et al., 2017), fraction of intercepted radiation (Guillen-

    Climent et al., 2014; Duan et al., 2017), LAI (Corcoles et al.,

    2013), lodging (Chapman et al., 2014), 3D structure (Aasen

    et al., 2015; Weiss and Baret, 2017), leaf angle distribution

    (Guo et al., 2015; McNeil et al., 2016), tiller densities (Du and

    Noguchi, 2017), and emergence (Sankaran et al., 2015a), can

    be rapidly obtained using the image analysis methods or the

    spectral and texture information in the images acquired by a

    UAV deployed imaging sensors (Tamouridou et al., 2017; Yu

    et al., 2017). The densiﬁed three-dimensional point clouds can

    be created using structure from motion (SFM) based on the

    images acquired by a UAV equipped with a digital camera

    (Turner et al., 2012; Holman et al., 2016). Then, the DSM and

    DEM are extracted to generate crop surface models (CSMs)

    (De Souza et al., 2017), which can be used for lodging area

    estimation (Chapman et al., 2014) and plant height monitoring

    (Li W. et al., 2016). The accuracy of plant height estimation

    using DSM and DEM can be signiﬁcant improved with the use

    of Real Time Kinematic (RTK) GPS (Xiong et al., 2017). The

    plant height of maize was estimated by UAV equipped a digital

    camera with the R2 and NRMSE of 0.88 and 6.40%, respectively

    (Li W. et al., 2016). In addition to estimating plant height using

    DEM generated by digital images, the point clouds acquired

    by LIDAR can also be used for estimating plant height. In

    NERCITA’s ongoing study, 69 (Inbred) and 104 (Hybrid) maize

    lines were selected for estimating plant height with UAV-based

    LIDAR. The determination coeﬃcients between the estimated

    maize height by LIDAR and measured plant height can reach

    to 0.94 in maize breeding (Figure 5), which showed a high

    accuracy for plant height estimation in breeding. Flowering

    dynamics act as an important phenotypic trait for paddy

    rice, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive by manual

    observation. The image analysis technique including scale-

    invariant feature transform descriptors and machine learning

    performed well for detecting ﬂowering panicles with RGB images

    (Guo et al., 2015). However, the applications of UAV for

    counting ﬂowering panicles haven’t been reported. Automated

    characterization of ﬂowering dynamics by UAV remote sensing

    at large-scale is essential for accelerating the breeding process.

    Thus, there’s still potential for wider applications of ﬁeld-

    based phenotyping by UAV with the advance of image

    analysis method, low-cost sensor and eﬀective image processing

    software.

    Classiﬁcation of remote sensing images is an important part of

    image feature analysis and can be used for leaf color monitoring

    and crop identiﬁcation (Geipel et al., 2014). Classiﬁcation

    methods can be divided into supervised and non-supervised

    classiﬁcation according to the level of user intervention required.

    Supervised classiﬁcation methods include maximum likelihood

    discriminant, neural network classiﬁcation, fuzzy classiﬁcation,

    minimum distance classiﬁcation and Fisher classiﬁcation, while

    unsupervised classiﬁcation methods include dynamic clustering,

    fuzzy clustering, hierarchical clustering and splitting (Zhao and

    Qian, 2004). Ground canopy cover (GCC) was recognized as

    an important parameter related to the crop photosynthesis and

    transpiration (Mullan and Reynolds, 2010). GCC is dynamic

    during the crop growth stages. GCC reduced as a result of

    leaf rolling or wilting under drought stress conditions (Sayed

    et al., 2012), which can be used for studying the response of

    crop varieties under abiotic/biotic stress. Thus, the dynamics

    of GCC over time have been regarded as one of the targeted

    phenotypic traits in crop breeding (Zaman-Allah et al., 2015;

    Yu et al., 2017). Ground canopy cover can be estimated by

    canopy reﬂectance, surface temperature and imagery (Booth

    et al., 2005; Rajan and Maas, 2009). For example, Champan

    acquired the GCC of sorghum with best linear unbiased

    prediction using a UAV with a digital camera and showed

    that the UAV-RSP has great potential for crop phenotyping in

    speciﬁc breeding plots (Chapman et al., 2014). As the accuracy

    of GCC estimation is relatively low using NDVI at early

    growth stage due to the inﬂuence of soil. The pixel-level data

    extracted from images with high resolution acquired by UAV

    performed better for GCC estimation (Sankaran et al., 2015b).

    The large amount of data acquired by UAV-RSPs deploying

    multi-source sensors can be rapidly and eﬃciently processed

    through machine learning, which has been widely used in the

    ﬁeld of crop phenotyping under stress conditions. Identiﬁcation,

    classiﬁcation, quantiﬁcation and prediction are the main steps for

    analyzing the physiological traits under conditions of biotic and

    abiotic stress based on machine learning (Zhao and Qian, 2004;

    Singh et al., 2016).

    LAI reﬂects the growth status of the crop population, and

    it is closely related to crop yield. Methods for estimating

    LAI by remote sensing include statistical models and optical

    models. Vegetation indices can be built after processing the

    spectral reﬂectance data acquired by UAV-based spectrometers

    using statistical methods to estimate LAI, such as Normalized

    Diﬀerence Vegetation Index (NDVI), Ratio Vegetation Index

    (RVI) and Perpendicular Vegetation Index (PVI). For example,

    the LAI in soybean breeding was estimated based on UAV-

    based hyperspectral by NERCITA, with the determination of

    coeﬃcients and RMSE for calibration model of 0.70 and 0.67,

    respectively, which showed a good precision (Lu et al., 2016).

    In addition to estimate LAI with statistical models based on

    vegetation indices, the radiation transmission model can also

    be used for LAI estimation. For example, the PROSAIL model

    combined with spectral data in the ﬁeld was used to estimate the

    LAI of wheat (Vega et al., 2015).

    Crop Phenotyping Related Vegetation

    Spectral Indices

    The absorption and reﬂection characteristics diﬀer between

    spectral bands in the crop leaves, with strong absorption in the

    visible band and strong reﬂection in the near-infrared band,

    providing the physical basis of crop growth monitoring by

    remote sensing. The reﬂection characteristics of crop leaves in

    diﬀerent bands can be acquired by the imaging spectrometer

    (Figure 6). A large number of vegetation indices can be

    constructed by the empirical treatment of spectral reﬂectance

    data at diﬀerent wavelengths, which can reﬂect the diﬀerence

    between the reﬂectance of visible light, near-infrared and soil

    background, indicating the crop growth status (Table 5). For

    example, the relationship between LAI and the normalized

    diﬀerence spectral index (NDSI) calculated from all possible two-

    band combinations was evaluated and showed that the NDSI

    consists of two sensitive bands and can be used to estimate LAI

    with high accuracy (Figure 7; Gao et al., 2016). The spectral

    characteristics of the crop canopy can be rapidly acquired by a

    UAV-RSP equipped with multispectral and hyperspectral sensors

    and can then be processed to build a vegetation index to monitor

    key crop traits, such as canopy cover, LAI, chlorophyll content,

    plant nutrients, water status, biomass and yield (Horler et al.,

    1983; Raun et al., 2001; Gutierrez et al., 2010). The vegetation

    indices built through the combination of spectra in the near-

    infrared and red channels, such as NDVI, RDVI, and GNDVI,

    can be used to monitor LAI and canopy cover (Danks et al.,

    1984; Curran, 1985). The vegetation indices composed of a

    combination of spectra in the red, blue and infrared channels,

    such as OSAVI, EVI, RVI, PVI, and DVI, can be used to estimate

    the chlorophyll content and leaf nitrogen content (Samseemoung

    et al., 2012; Nigon et al., 2015). The vegetation indices composed

    of a combination of spectra in the green and red channels,

    such as the red green ratio index, can be used to determine

    the carotenoid content. The vegetation indices built based on

    the diﬀerence between two or more spectral channels, such as

    DVI/EVI, which is sensitive to changes in the soil background,

    can be used for crop biomass monitoring. The vegetation

    indices composed of the ratio between two or more spectral

    channels can indicate the diﬀerence between crop growth and

    crop cover. For example, RVI was used for CCC monitoring.

    Normalized diﬀerence vegetation indices, such as NDVI/RDVI,

    can reﬂect crop growth and nutrition. The combination of blue,

    red and near-infrared channels can eliminate the interference

    of atmospheric aerosols on vegetation indices, such as OSAVI,

    which can improve the accuracy of crop growth monitoring and

    yield prediction. There’re advantages of easy computation, low

    instrumental requirements for the empirical statistical analysis

    method based on vegetation index, while the limitation include

    the lack of crop physiological interpretation, and need to be

    empirically ﬁtted to each particular scenario. In addition to the

    empirical statistical method for crop phenotyping, the semi-

    mechanistic model, mechanism model and machine learning are

    also useful methods. However, the most adopted method for

    crop phenotyping by UAV remote sensing is mainly empirical

    statistical model.

    Crop Physiological Traits

    The reﬂectance of plant leaves in visible light is aﬀected by the

    contents of chlorophyll, carotene and lutein in the palisade tissue,

    whereas the reﬂectance of plant leaves in the near-infrared band is

    closely related to the cell structure. A large number of vegetation

    indices can be built after the empirical treatment of spectral

    information and can be used to estimate many biophysical

    properties, such as the chlorophyll, protein content, biomass,

    malnutrition, crop vigor and water status (Ma et al., 2001; Prasad

    et al., 2007). For example, the NDVI can reﬂect the eﬀect of

    background information on the canopy spectra to estimate crop

    vigor, biomass, and yield (Hall et al., 2003; Gao et al., 2016).

    GNDVI and NDWI were used to estimate the leaf chlorophyll

    content and water status, respectively, (Prasad et al., 2007; Lelong

    et al., 2008; Gonzalez-Dugo et al., 2014). The accuracy and

    reliability of the estimation of crop physiological traits were

    determined by the retrieval model. The most commonly used

    modeling and analysis method for crop phenotyping by remote

    sensing is regression analysis, including linear and nonlinear

    regression. Linear regression methods, including multivariate

    linear regression (MLR), stepwise linear regression (SLR), and

    PLSR, are simple and feasible (Capolupo et al., 2015) and have

    wide applications in quantitative analysis by remote sensing. For

    example, MLR was used to estimate crop biomass (Rosen et al.,

    2006; Swain et al., 2010), PLSR was used to estimate the LAI in

    soybean breeding (Lu et al., 2016), and SLR was used to estimate

    the leaf chlorophyll content (Berni et al., 2009b). However, the

    primary objection to linear regression methods is the lack of

    explanation of crop physiology. In recent years, using nonlinear

    regression methods, including principal component analysis,

    artiﬁcial neural network, support vector machine and wavelet

    analysis, data mining has been widely employed to associate

    hyperspectral information with physiological and biochemical

    crop parameters (Gong, 1999; Liang, 2005; Wang et al., 2008).

    However, because there is no explicit regression formula for

    these nonlinear regression models, it is diﬃcult to obtain a

    universal analysis model, and the calculation process is more

    time-consuming, which limits the eﬃciency and application of

    these methods. Intercepted photosynthetically active radiation

    (IPAR) act as an important indicator of photosynthesis and

    biomass accumulation, methods based optical remote sensing,

    such as 3D radiative transfer model, Forest Light Interaction

    Model (FLIGHT) have been adopted to study the fraction

    of photosynthetically active radiation intercepted (fIPAR) and

    absorbed (fAPAR). The high-resolution multi-spectral images

    acquired by UAV provide a rapid and non-destructive way for

    ﬁPAR and fAPAR estimation in recent years (Guillen-Climent

    et al., 2012).

    Biomass is an important indicator of crop growth, which

    can be used for crop monitoring and yield prediction. The

    sensors including multispectral camera, hyperspectral imager,

    LIDAR, combing the methods including empirical statistical

    analysis of vegetation indices, estimation based on net primary

    productivity, and crop growth model have been widely deployed

    for biomass estimation (Hunt et al., 2005; Swain et al., 2010;

    Wallace et al., 2012; Bendig et al., 2014). However, the method

    for the estimation of crop biomass by UAV remote sensing

    is mainly empirical statistical model. In order to improve the

    accuracy of biomass estimation, the vegetation indices combing

    plant height have been used for estimating crop biomass. For

    example, the plant height from crop surface model combing

    RNDVI were used for barley biomass estimation with the R2

    of 0.84, while the best performance of estimating biomass by

    single vegetation index got by GRVI and MGRVI with R2 of 0.60

    (Ota et al., 2015). In addition to the retrieval model with single

    FIGURE 8 | The relationship between plant height and aboveground biomass

    of soybean (from Lu et al., 2016; permissions for reproduction have been

    obtained from the copyright holders).

    vegetation index, the multiple regression model with several

    vegetation indices have also been adopted to estimate biomass,

    which showed good accuracy. For example, in NERCITA’s

    soybean breeding experiment, UAV-based hyperspectral remote

    sensing was used to estimate soybean biomass in 126 plots by

    NERCITA and provided a rapid and non-destructive method

    to estimate crop biomass under complex ﬁeld environments. As

    there is a good relationship between soybean plant height and

    biomass (Figure 8), the plant height combined vegetation indices

    acquired by a Cubert UHD 185 hyperspectral imager were used

    to build retrieval models using PLSR to estimate the soybean

    biomass of a massive germplasm. As the relationship between the

    canopy spectral characteristics and soybean biomass in diﬀerent

    growth stages showed signiﬁcant diﬀerences, the method of

    “segmentation modeling” was used to estimate soybean biomass

    under diﬀerent growth stages. The vegetation indices of OSAVI,

    R726 and NDVI705 were used to build a retrieval model to

    estimate the biomass in soybean breeding during the periods

    of ﬂowering and pod ﬁlling, with the determination coeﬃcient

    and RMSE of 0.71 and 0.39, respectively. While the RVI, VOG1,

    NDVI, and Ratio of green peak and red valley (R1) were used

    to build a retrieval model to estimate the biomass in soybean

    breeding during the periods of ﬁlling and ripening, with a

    determination coeﬃcient and RMSE of 0.70 and 0.38 (Figure 9;

    Lu et al., 2016).

    (Zhao and Qian, 2004; Zarco-Tejada et al., 2012; Nigon et al.,

    conditions is important for crop cultivation and breeding.

    As the membrane permeability of plant cells, the chlorophyll

    content, and peroxidase change under stress conditions, thus,

    some diseases can be detected by spectroscopy at early growth

    stage. For example, the UAV-based multi-band imaging sensor

    was deployed to acquire high-resolution aerial imaging for

    Huanglongbing (HLB) detection, which yielding that there’s

    signiﬁcant diﬀerence for the 710 nm spectral reﬂectance and

    the NIR-R index values between healthy and HLB-infected

    trees (Garcia-Ruiz et al., 2013). The vegetation indices can

    be extracted from images acquired by UAV to separate the

    healthy oil palm and those infested with Phellinus Noxius by

    visualization, analysis and identiﬁcation of image processing

    software, which provide a way for timely detection of pest or

    disease infections (Samseemoung et al., 2011). The weed can also

    be separated crops with UAV-deployed multispectral images. For

    example, the Silybum marianum (L.) Gaertn weed was classiﬁed

    using Maximum Likelihood classiﬁer (ML) with multispectral

    images acquired by a ﬁx-wing UAV. The overall accuracy of

    classiﬁcation rates can reach up to 87.04% (Tamouridou et al.,

    2017). As crop phenotypic information plays an important role

    in revealing the resistance of crops to stress, rapid phenotyping

    is essential for agricultural scientists to achieve their goals.

    Remotely sensed infrared canopy temperatures can provide an

    eﬃcient method for rapid, non-destructive monitoring of whole-

    plant response to water stress (Rashid et al., 1999; Gutierrez et al.,

    2010), which has been widely used to screen drought tolerance

    varieties. The evapotranspiration can be estimated with thermal

    infrared images under stress conditions (Grieder et al., 2015).

    The canopy temperature can also be used for predict crop yield

    at some occasions. For example, there was a signiﬁcant positive

    correlation between lower canopy temperature and higher yield

    under conditions of high temperature and drought (Reynolds

    et al., 2007). The stomatal conductance decreased and the leaf

    temperature increased with stoma closure under osmotic stress

    caused by excess salinity and high temperature, which can be

    used to estimate leaf water potential and stomatal conductance

    (Bowman and Strain, 1988; Wang et al., 2003).

    As the crop canopy temperature is related to photosynthesis,

    the canopy air temperature diﬀerence (TD), which is the ratio

    of the canopy temperature and air temperature, can be used to

    predict crop yield, for example, there is a signiﬁcant negative

    correlation between the TD and yield of hybrid sorghum potato

    (Chaudhuri and Kanemasu, 1982) and a signiﬁcant positive

    correlation between TD and wheat yield under water stress

    conditions (Rashid et al., 1999; Bellundagi et al., 2013). The

    water deﬁcit index obtained from thermal imaging data can

    Yang et al.

    High-Throughput Field-Based Phenotyping Using UAV

    be used to determine the water status of crop leaves and to

    estimate the stomatal conductance. The canopy temperature

    plays an important role in screening drought-resistant varieties

    by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre

    (Reynolds et al., 1994). Approximately 60% of the variation of

    seed yield of diﬀerent wheat varieties can be explained by high

    temperature and drought conditions and canopy temperature,

    which are negatively correlated with the yield of wheat (Olivares-

    Villegas et al., 2007; Reynolds et al., 2007). Keep (2013) found

    a diﬀerence in canopy temperature between soybean varieties

    bred during the periods of 1920–2010, which was not aﬀected

    by the environment. In addition, there is a signiﬁcant negative

    correlation between canopy temperature and yield for 2 groups

    of ripe varieties (Keep, 2013).

    The conventional method of measuring the crop canopy

    temperature in the ﬁeld is using a handheld thermal imager,

    which is ineﬃcient. It is diﬃcult to synchronously measure

    agronomic characteristics in a large area within a short time

    using a handheld thermal imager, but a UAV equipped with

    a thermal imaging instrument can rapidly and easily acquire

    thermal imaging data for crop growth monitoring in large areas

    to indirectly monitor crop growth status. The use of UAVs

    equipped with thermal imagers to monitor the crop canopy

    temperature, stomatal conductance and leaf water status of

    wheat, maize and sorghum showed high accuracy compared with

    the data observed in the ﬁeld, while such indicators of cotton

    acquired by UAV-based thermal imagers showed lower accuracy

    (Berni et al., 2009b; Zarco-Tejada et al., 2012; Colomina and

    Molina, 2014).

    Crop Potential Yield Prediction and

    Nutrient Monitoring

    Crop yield, which is closely related to the development and

    diﬀerentiation of organs and the distribution and accumulation

    of photosynthetic products, is the core focus of crop science

    research. The traditional methods for crop yield estimation

    are the use of manual surveys or establishing the relationship

    between agronomic factors or climatic factors and crop yield

    using statistical analysis methods (Overgaard et al., 2010;

    Swain et al., 2010). Many observations and samplings in ﬁeld

    experiments are required to determine the parameters of the yield

    prediction model, which is laborious and time-consuming. As

    some factors are diﬃcult to quantify, it is diﬃcult to promote the

    use of these models due to the poor adaptability to diﬀerent areas.

    Yield prediction by remote sensing is deﬁned as building the

    relationship between the canopy spectra and crop yield based on

    the biological characteristics of crops for yield prediction using

    spectral data at diﬀerent crop growth stages (Swain et al., 2010).

    Improving the accuracy and adaptability of the yield estimation

    model is a prerequisite for the application of UAV remote sensing.

    Crop yield can be predicted by combining the plant physiological

    parameters with the vegetation indices. The commonly adopted

    plant physiological parameters and remote sensing parameters

    for building yield prediction models include the length of the

    growth period, chlorophyll content, LAI, aboveground biomass,

    spectral reﬂectance and vegetation indices (Filella et al., 1995).

    Crop yield can be predicted by constructing a remote sensing

    inversion model containing a variety of vegetation indices;

    however, the accuracy of crop prediction using the structural

    index is low due to the eﬀects of terminal water stress (Chaudhuri

    and Kanemasu, 1982). The canopy temperature, which is related

    to yield to a certain extent, and carotenoids pigment indices,

    such as the PRI and chlorophyll absorption reﬂectance index

    (CARI), are suited to screening complex traits, such as crop

    yield (Gonzalez-Dugo et al., 2015). For example, the wheat

    yield was predicted based on canopy temperature as low

    temperature increases the yield under adequate water supply

    and water limitation conditions (Olivares-Villegas et al., 2007).

    The chlorophyll content can also be used to predict crop yield

    because there is a relationship between the chlorophyll content

    and photosynthesis that is related to yield. The accuracy of yield

    prediction models improves with increasing number of modeling

    parameters; however, the yield prediction models using spectral

    reﬂectance characteristics and canopy temperature usually focus

    on 2∼3 bands and lack adaptability. Therefore, it is important to

    build crop yield prediction models that combine crop physiology

    and remote sensing parameters to improve the accuracy of yield

    prediction by UAV-RSP.

    In recent years, the spectral characteristics of components,

    such as plant chlorophyll, nitrogen and water, were identiﬁed,

    which enabled the estimation of the biochemical contents of

    crops by remote sensing and estimation of crop nutrition under

    diﬀerent environmental conditions (Swain et al., 2007; Wang

    et al., 2008). Leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) is an important

    indicator of nitrogen (N) status for assessing dynamic regulation

    and predicting crop yield. Research progress of remote sensing

    technology for LNC estimation have been achieved in the past

    years. The adopted algorithms and vegetation indices for building

    remote sensing analytical models signiﬁcantly aﬀect the accuracy

    of ﬁeld phenotyping using UAV-RSPs. As models for phenotypic

    information analysis of massive cultivars in breeding plots using

    unmanned aerial vehicle remote sensing are sensitive to climate

    and soil conditions, developing strategies for LNC estimation

    for diﬀerent crops under diﬀerent environmental conditions

    is helpful for crop growth monitoring. In NERCITA’s study,

    four chemometric techniques, including stepwise multiple linear

    regression (SMLR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), back

    propagation neural network (BPN), and support vector machines

    regression (SVR), were adopted with 13 key spectral features to

    build LNC models. The results indicated that partial least squares

    regression (PLSR) and support vector machines regression (SVR)

    performed better than the other two methods, with R2 values in

    the calibration set of 0.82 and 0.81 and the normalized root mean

    square error (NRMSE) values in the validation set of 5.48 and

    5.94%, respectively (Li Z. et al., 2016).

    DISCUSSIONS

    UAV-RSPs and Deployed Sensors

    UAV remote sensing platforms have become an eﬀective way

    to rapidly acquire ground information, especially in the ﬁeld

    of crop growth monitoring. It is necessary to adjust the ﬂight

    altitude and ﬂight speed based on the actual conditions due

    to the complexity of the farmland environment. In contrast,

    the ﬂight speed and altitude must be lower to obtain detailed

    information about fruit growth in the bush (Mathews and Jensen,

    2013). Frequently used UAV-RSPs, especially multi-rotor UAVs,

    such as the quadcopter UAV model md4-1000, are unmanned

    gyroplanes. Gyroplanes have the advantages of adjustable ﬂight

    speed and height, the ability to take-oﬀ and land vertically,

    freedom from site condition restrictions, and suitability for the

    observation of precise farmland information (Hardin and Jensen,

    2011). The ﬂight altitude of multi-rotor UAVs ranges from 20 to

    100 m, guaranteeing that the spatial data resolution of the optical

    sensors can reach the centimeter level for accurate identiﬁcation

    of crop individuals. The ﬂight altitude ranges from 300 to 1,000

    m for most ﬁxed-wing UAVs, and the biggest problem for the

    ﬁxed-wing UAVs is that a minimum ﬂight speed before they

    stall is required. The operation of ﬁxed-wing UAVs is more

    complicated than that of multi-rotor UAVs, which make it more

    dangerous. The disadvantages limit the wide application of ﬁxed-

    wing UAVs for data acquisition in ﬁeld phenotyping. Most UAVs

    are equipped with automatic driving systems. The automatic

    adjustment of ﬂight height, position and attitude is conducted

    using GPS/INS and the pressure gauge mounted on the UAV,

    which can reduce the intensity of manual control and avoid the

    impact of human factors on ﬂight safety (Pajares, 2015). The

    payload can reach 3–5 kg for the most multi-rotor and ﬁxed-

    wing UAVs. Additionally, the UAV body must be larger when

    the payload exceeds 5 kg; it is necessary for the UAV to be

    equipped with an ejection frame at the specialized site for take-

    oﬀ and to conduct artiﬁcial judgment to open the parachute,

    which increases the complexity and diﬃculty of operating ﬁxed-

    wing UAVs. In general, multi-rotor UAVs are more stable and

    convenient and are more suitable as a platform for ﬁeld-based

    crop phenotyping. Nevertheless, the limited extension that rotary

    wings can cover by speed and autonomy is the problem for

    its application. In the future, multi-rotor UAVs will be able to

    provide more than 1 h of continuous ﬂight as battery technology

    matures.

    UAVs are currently equipped with optical sensors with

    wavebands ranging from visible light to near-infrared, such

    as multispectral sensors, conventional digital cameras, and

    hyperspectral sensors. The problems with sensors deployed by

    UAV-RSP are as follows: (1) the lack of sensors for ﬁeld-based

    crop phenotyping. The existing optical sensors are diﬃcult to use

    to obtain quantitative crop information and are usually employed

    for qualitative analysis. For example, an 8-bit storage format is

    used for imaging by the Tetracam ADC-lite camera, which can

    result in a very small change in spectral diﬀerence between crops

    and aﬀect the accuracy of the subsequent quantitative analysis.

    The commonly used digital cameras lack camera calibration and

    radiometric calibration, which can aﬀect the accuracy of the

    geometric parameter analysis. Unmanned airborne hyperspectral

    imaging, including linear push broom imaging and staring

    imaging, has gradually gained the attention of experts and

    scholars. The linear push broom imaging hyper-spectrometer

    is more mature, while the staring hyperspectral imager was

    developed for unstable platforms in the last 2 years. The biggest

    problem with the linear array push broom spectrometer is that

    it is diﬃcult to guarantee accurate geometric calibration. The

    spatial resolution of the spectrometer can reach the centimeter

    level, but the vibration of the UAV platform and dynamic jitter

    can cause obvious geometric distortion in the absence of high-

    precision positioning and orientation system (POS) or inertial

    navigation system (INS). The vibration can be reduced by a

    shock absorbers, or an active stabilization platform. However,

    it is diﬃcult for the geometric calibration accuracy to reach the

    centimeter level, which can seriously aﬀect the application of this

    type of sensor. Therefore, it is necessary to develop sensors to be

    deployed by micro-UAV for ﬁeld-based crop phenotyping. (2)

    The current sensor acquisition control system and UAV ﬂight

    control system are not integrated. Currently, the UAV and the

    deployed sensors are from diﬀerent manufacturers. Therefore,

    the ﬂight control system of the UAV does not provide an interface

    for the sensors, and the self-control system, acquisition and

    storage unit are equipped by the sensors without the interface

    and without a UAV ﬂight control system. It is necessary to

    dynamically control the sensors using the UAV ﬂight control

    system in the process of UAV remote sensing data acquisition to

    meet the needs of data acquisition and to avoid redundant data

    acquisition by the sensors.

    Airspace Regulations for the Application of

    UAVs

    The UAVs have the advantages of ﬂexible, real-time and non-

    destructive for crop phenotyping, however, UAVs must follow

    strict management rules to ensure their security as well as

    the sustainable development of the UAV aviation industry. As

    the ﬂight plan needs to be permitted by aviation regulators,

    which usually take more than 3 days in some countries. For

    example, permissions from more than 3 regulatory agencies,

    such as air force, civil aviation, police, are needed to conduct

    UAV ﬂight in China, which is time consuming. The ﬂight plan

    including the ﬂight time, ﬂight altitude UAV driver, ﬂying area

    and purpose of ﬂight etc. must be submitted. As the plan for

    the acquisition of UAV remote sensing information was usually

    scheduled based on the weather and crop growth stages, it’s hard

    to propose advanced declaration for conducting the research

    of ﬁeld phenotyping. In addition, the frequent ﬂight may be

    needed in the research, the repeated declarations are trouble.

    Here we present a summary of the main regulation for UAVs in

    diﬀerent countries. As one of the most developed countries in the

    aviation industry, the regulations of UAVs in the United States

    are in a relatively advanced position. UAVs were admitted to

    the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)

    in the United States in 1990, and UAV regulation found a

    balance between caution and openness by the Federal Aviation

    Administration (FAA) with the increase in the civilian UAV

    operating frequency. There are three types of UAVs that need

    to be supervised: public aircraft, civil aircraft, and model planes.

    The US FAA announced an online registration of commercial

    drones and small UAVs in 2016, with equal registration costs for

    recreational drones. The web version of the registration system

    was designed to reduce the time required for a large number

    of UAV operators to register commercial UAVs. Recently, the

    Yang et al.

    High-Throughput Field-Based Phenotyping Using UAV

    US FAA proposed a regulatory requirement that a UAV must

    be in sight of its operator, which limits the wide application of

    UAVs for large area crop surveys, long distance inspection of

    pipelines and delivery. To address this limitation, an air traﬃc

    management system was developed with the cooperation of

    NASA, companies, universities and government agencies to allow

    the operator to use a tracking system so that the UAV can ﬂy

    out of sight of the operator while avoiding sensitive areas, such

    as airports and crowded areas. The European Aviation Safety

    Agency (EASA) issued a notice of advanced system revision (A-

    NPA2015-10) named “the framework of the UAV operation rules

    and regulations” on July 30, 2015. The A-NPA provided a detailed

    operational regulatory framework with low risk proposed by

    EASA. The supervision by EASA was based on the performance

    and risk of UAVs, which can be divided into three categories:

    (1) open class (low risk); (2) franchise operation (medium risk);

    (3) validation class (high risk). The regulatory framework of

    EASA is based on the operational risk of the UAV. In addition to

    the regulations based on risk management, there are regulations

    based on certiﬁcation for UAVs, which are similar to those for

    manned spacecraft (Stöcker et al., 2017). The Civil Aviation

    Administration of China (CAAC) stipulates that institutions and

    individuals using UAVs must apply for specialized airspace based

    on the “General Aviation Flight Control Ordinance” and must

    obey ﬂight activity management rules to ensure ﬂight safety. The

    management level of production and the possession and use of

    UAVs greatly aﬀects the market size of UAV applications, which

    include UAV remote sensing and ﬁeld-based crop phenotyping.

    Methods and Accuracy of Field-Based

    Crop Phenotyping

    Methods for crop phenotype analysis from remote sensing

    include direct monitoring, image classiﬁcation, concurrent

    comparison, empirical statistics modeling, physical reversion

    modeling, machine learning, and time series analysis of remote

    sensing parameters (Singh et al., 2016; Virlet et al., 2017).

    However, the commonly adopted methods for crop phenotyping

    by UAV remote sensing technology are empirical statistical

    analysis at present. The other equally important methods for

    the analysis of remote sensing data haven’t been widely used in

    the research, only few articles present these methods for crop

    phenotyping by UAV. The statements based on literature survey

    and case study by NERCITA indicated that the high accuracy

    for estimating ﬁeld-based crop phenotypic traits can be attained,

    however, the high accuracy just can be attained in special

    occasions. The research that analyze LAI, canopy chlorophyll

    content and leaf nitrogen content using remote sensing data has

    been fully developed. The determination coeﬃcient of retrieval

    models can exceed 0.85 (Rosen et al., 2006; Berni et al., 2009b;

    Ballesteros et al., 2014; Bendig et al., 2014), indicating that

    the estimated phenotypic information is in good agreement

    with the measured values. The reason for the high accuracy is

    that the spectral characteristics of the leaves are related to the

    abovementioned indicators and can be used to directly reﬂect

    the growth information. Unfortunately, it’s hard to propose

    the universal models or general methods for retrieving crop

    phenotypic traits with good accuracy by remote sensing among

    diﬀerent types of crops so far.

    As the vegetation index is an important cause of the

    diﬀerences in remote sensing for retrieving crop phenotypic

    traits, the combination of spectral bands can aﬀect the retrieval

    accuracy. The retrieval accuracy of complex traits based on

    remote sensing in the surveyed literatures remains low. The

    determination coeﬃcient of retrieval models for predicting crop

    yield and biomass is usually less than 0.70 (Overgaard et al.,

    2010) due to the indirect relationship between remote sensing

    information and complex crop traits. Complex crop traits are

    inﬂuenced by the genome and environment, while the spectral

    reﬂectance and vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI, RVI) are indirectly

    related to these traits. Crop traits such as LAI and fraction of

    absorbed photosynthetically active radiation are more related

    to crop yield; however, it is diﬃcult to use crop traits directly

    related to spectral characteristics to predict crop yield due to the

    heterogeneity of the earth’s surface, the inﬂuence of crop type and

    environment, and the uncertainty of remote sensing extraction.

    The basic research ideas for ﬁeld-based crop phenotyping by

    UAV-RSP are similar, including retrieving key crop traits, such

    as crop structure, biochemical content, biomass, yield, lodging,

    diseases and pests, from remote sensing data (Sankaran et al.,

    2015b). Most retrieved crop traits are at the canopy scale and

    can indicate crop growth; however, there is a need to acquire

    physiological and ecological characteristics of individual plants

    and even organs that cannot be resolved by UAVs. Therefore,

    new sensors and physical reversion models are needed to

    synchronously monitor the key phenotypic information of crops

    at the micro and macro scales.

    Challenge for “Big” Data Processing

    Compared with the rapid development of sensor and hardware

    platforms, the eﬃciency and function of image processing are

    insuﬃcient, especially the rapid processing ability of software

    in the ﬁeld. In addition, large amounts of data acquired by

    hyperspectral imagers and LIDAR need to be processed (Zhao

    and Qian, 2004). As image processing for hyperspectral and

    LIDAR data is complex, there is an urgent need to develop

    software with the ability to perform high-speed and accurate

    image processing to improve the eﬃciency and accuracy of data

    processing. The data processing ﬂow is based on aerial remote

    sensing image processing for most existing UAV remote sensing

    processing software, without consideration of the specialized

    characteristics of UAV remote sensing. The aspects reﬂecting

    the diﬀerence between aerial remote sensing and UAV remote

    sensing include few ground control points, a lack of strict

    internal calibration parameters in the deployed sensors, and a

    lack of a high-precision POS system for UAV remote sensing,

    which prevents the existing aerial remote sensing processing

    system from being directly applied to UAV remote sensing data

    processing. Digital image processing software, such as Agisoft

    PhotoScan Professional Edition (Agisoft LLC, St. Petersburg,

    Russia) and Pixel4D (Lausanne Switzerland), which can be used

    for geometric correction and mosaicking, has rapidly developed

    in recent years; however, hyperspectral images and LIDAR data

    cannot be processed using commercial processing software due

    to the lack of a special module for remote sensing information

    analysis. The eﬃciency of data processing software must be

    improved to satisfy the requirements of rapid and accurate data

    processing and analysis.

    The

    geometric

    correction

    and

    radiometric

    calibration

    constitute the most demanding work for UAV remote sensing

    data processing, which is time-consuming. A mature remote

    sensing photogrammetry method was adopted for geometric

    correction, which requires many points matching the same

    name, point cloud generation and correction of ortho images.

    In addition, it is diﬃcult to batch process because the spectral

    and spatial resolution of each sensor is diﬀerent, which reduces

    the processing eﬃciency. It is necessary to develop UAV remote

    sensing output processing methods based on cloud computing

    or high-performance computing to process remote sensing data

    online and to avoid the low eﬃciency caused by data processing

    using stand-alone software. Additionally, there is a need to

    develop specialized analytical tools for sensors deployed in crop

    phenotyping research using UAV-RSPs for wide applications by

    crop breeders. The application of UAV-RSPs for ﬁeld-based crop

    phenotyping can promote the association analysis of genomes

    and phenotypes to improve crop breeding eﬃciency.

    CONCLUSION

    Field-based crop phenotyping by UAV-RSPs has become a hot

    research topic in recent years. Approximately 88.5% of the

    surveyed literature focused on ﬁeld phenotyping using UAV-

    RSPs was published in the last 5 years. The current status and

    perspectives of UAV-RSPs for FBP are follows:

    (1) UAV-RSP can be as a powerful tool for ﬁeld-based

    phenotyping

    with

    the

    advantages

    of

    high

    operation

    eﬃciency,

    low

    cost,

    suitability

    for

    complex

    ﬁeld

    environments, and high resolution. The multi-rotor UAV

    is the mostly adopted UAV-based phenotyping platform in

    the recent years. There’s potential for UAV-RSP acting as

    an alternative to the traditional methods for crop growth

    monitoring, yield prediction and variety selection. The

    digital camera, multispectral camera, hyperspectral camera,

    thermal infrared imager and LiDAR have been widely used

    to ﬁeld-based phenotyping. The adoption of multi-sensors

    coupled with advanced data analysis methods for retrieving

    crop phenotypic traits are the research hotspots in recent

    years.

    (2) The crop phenotype that can be acquired by UAV-RSP

    include, but are not limited to, geometric traits, canopy

    spectral texture, physiological traits, abiotic/biotic stress

    response, plant nutrition, and yield. Unfortunately, there is

    still a lack of validation for ﬁeld-based phenotyping by UAV

    with a large group of crop varieties. There exists diﬀerence

    for the accuracy of ﬁeld-based phenotyping using UAV

    remote sensing among phenotypic traits, which was caused

    by the variation of sensor type, climate, crop growth stages

    and crop type. Research focused on crop phenotypic traits

    that are directly related to the canopy spectral information

    has been conducted and has shown good accuracy under

    certain conditions, while there is low accuracy in the research

    on the non-destructive acquisition of complex traits that are

    indirectly related to the canopy spectral information.

    (3) The limiting factors for UAV-based ﬁeld phenotyping

    include the low capability of UAVs, the strict airspace

    regulations, the lack of methods for fast data processing

    and models for estimating complex traits under diﬀerent

    environmental conditions. Improving the performance of

    UAVs, reducing the cost of sensors, speeding up data

    processing and developing strategies for analyzing crop

    phenotype by remote sensing are future trends. Fortunately,

    it is expected that with the advancement of UAVs with larger

    payload and longer endurance, low-cost sensors, improved

    image processing methods for “Big” data, and eﬀective

    airspace regulations, there’s potential for wider applications

    about the UAV-based ﬁeld phenotyping.

    the future of computing and communications. Most of the people over all worlds
    depend on agriculture. Because of this reason smart IT technologies are needed
    to migrate with traditional agriculture methods. Using modern technologies can
    control the cost, maintenance and monitoring performance. Satellite and aerial
    imagery play a vital role in modern agriculture. Precision agriculture sensor
    monitoring network is used greatly to measure agri-related information like temperature,
    humidity, soil PH, soil nutrition levels, water level etc. so, with IoT farmers
    can remotely monitor their crop and equipment by phones and computers. In this
    paper, we surveyed some typical applications of Agriculture IoT Sensor Monitoring
    Network technologies using Cloud computing as the backbone. This survey is used
    to understand the different technologies and to build sustainable smart agriculture.

    Location: Vellore, India I. Introduction Around 60–70 %(predicted value) Indian
    population directly or indirectly depends on agriculture. That effects on food
    security and economic growth of India. With help of Precision, agriculture process
    can easily monitor or observe of crop growth based on collected information (soil
    condition and weather information) from a crop field. This mechanism also called
    as satellite farming or site-specific crop management (SSCM) [1], manually can''t
    able to collect environmental information because it is a tuff task. New farmers
    are coming out without knowledge of soil characteristics because insufficient
    soil testing labs properly not available in the states of the country. So now
    what is the importance of IoT in agriculture? The solution is Manual data collection;
    absolutely it is a risk for farmers and also to processes from the crop field.
    So it is difficult for farmers to get optimal levels of efficiency. To solve this
    difficulty, IoT (Internet of Things) is only the solution. It plays vital role
    in collecting information. IoT has been already in raising with novel multiple
    techniques. In this paper, a survey on smart agriculture IoT with cloud computing
    is carried out to understand the recent IoT -based technical developments in smart
    agriculture is explained in Section II, Section III describes a conceptual model
    for IoT and Wireless sensor network based agriculture with cloud computing, Section
    IV describes a hardware analysis of architecture, Section V describes a mathematical

    • The role of Internet of Things in arable farming is reviewed. • Internet of
    Things is leading arable farming to become data-driven. • Implementation and application
    are described in depth. • Challenges, corresponding solutions and potentials are
    discussed thoroughly. The Internet of Things is allowing agriculture, here specifically
    arable farming, to become data-driven, leading to more timely and cost-effective
    production and management of farms, and at the same time reducing their environmental
    impact. This review is addressing an analytical survey of the current and potential
    application of Internet of Things in arable farming, where spatial data, highly
    varying environments, task diversity and mobile devices pose unique challenges
    to be overcome compared to other agricultural systems. The review contributes
    an overview of the state of the art of technologies deployed. It provides an outline
    of the current and potential applications, and discusses the challenges and possible
    solutions and implementations. Lastly, it presents some future directions for
    the Internet of Things in arable farming. Current issues such as smart phones,
    intelligent management of Wireless Sensor Networks, middleware platforms, integrated
    Farm Management Information Systems across the supply chain, or autonomous vehicles
    and robotics stand out because of their potential to lead arable farming to smart
    arable farming. During the implementation, different challenges are encountered,
    and here interoperability is a key major hurdle throughout all the layers in the
    architecture of an Internet of Things system, which can be addressed by shared
    standards and protocols. Challenges such as affordability, device power consumption,
    network latency, Big Data analysis, data privacy and security, among others, have
    been identified by the articles reviewed and are discussed in detail. Different
    solutions to all identified challenges are presented addressing technologies such
    as machine learning, middleware platforms, or intelligent data management. Previous

    The global population and its food consumption are growing alarmingly quickly,
    while climate change effects are simultaneously complicating the challenge of
    ensuring food security in a sustainable manner (Godfray et al., 2010, Tilman et
    al., 2011). Data-driven agriculture is one of the main strategies and concepts
    proposed to increase production efficiently while decreasing its environmental
    impact (Foley et al., 2011). Data-driven technologies in general are quickly advancing
    with the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), and may become an important
    part of the future of farming (Brewster et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2016,
    Verdouw, 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Smart Farming, also called Agriculture 4.0
    or digital farming (CEMA, 2017), is developing beyond the modern concept of precision
    agriculture, which bases its management practices on spatial measurements largely
    thanks to Global Positioning System (GPS) signals. Smart farming bases its management
    tasks also on spatial data but is enhanced with context-awareness and is activated
    by real-time events, improving the performance of hitherto precision agriculture
    solutions (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Additionally, Smart
    Farming usually incorporates intelligent services for applying and managing Information
    and Communication Technologies (ICT) in farming, and allows transverse integration
    throughout the whole agri-food chain in regards to food safety and traceability
    (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). IoT is therefore a key technology in smart farming
    since it ensures data flow between sensors and other devices, making it possible
    to add value to the obtained data by automatic processing, analysis and access,
    and this leads to more timely and cost-effective production and management effort
    on farms. Simultaneously, IoT enables the reduction of the inherent environmental
    impact by real-time reaction to alert events such as weed, pest or disease detection,
    weather or soil monitoring warnings, which allow for a reduction and adequate
    use of inputs such as agrochemicals or water. IoT eases documentation and supervision
    of different activities as well as the traceability of products, improving the
    environmental surveying and control in farms by the appropriate authorities. The
    IoT concept was introduced by Kevin Ashton in 1999 in relation to linking Radio-Frequency
    Identification (RFID) for supply chains to the internet (Ashton, 2009), but has
    no official definition. It implies, however, the connection of a network of “things”
    to or through the internet without direct human intervention. “Things” can be
    any object with sensors and/or actuators that is uniquely addressable, interconnected
    and accessible through the world-wide computer network, i.e. the Internet. The
    application of IoT in agriculture is advantageous because of the possibility to
    monitor and control many different parameters in an interoperable, scalable and
    open context with an increasing use of heterogeneous automated components (Kamilaris,
    Gao, Prenafeta-Boldu, & Ali, 2016), in addition to the inevitable requirement
    for traceability. As a result of IoT, agriculture is becoming data-driven, i.e.
    making informed real-time decisions for managing the farm, reducing uncertainties
    and inefficiencies, and as a consequence reducing its environmental impact. The
    application of IoT in agriculture, also called Ag-IoT (Zhai, 2017), AIoT (Zou
    & Quan, 2017), or IoF meaning Internet of Farming (Alahmadi, Alwajeeh, Mohanan,
    & Budiarto, 2017) or Internet of Food and Farm (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), has received exponentially increasing attention in the scientific
    community (Fig. 1). Even though the publications are mainly dominated by Asian
    scientists (Talavera et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016), in Europe several large scale
    international pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019), are aiming to implement IoT technologies in the agricultural
    industry in Europe. Similar projects elsewhere include the Accelerating Precision
    Agriculture to Decision Agriculture (P2D) project in Australia (Zhang, Baker,
    Jakku, & Llewellyn, 2017), which complement additional major investments with
    the aim to help farmers convert to smart farming (Higgins et al., 2017, Pham and
    Stack, 2018). Download : Download high-res image (95KB) Download : Download full-size

    Several reviews have been done on IoT in agriculture in the relatively short time
    period in which publications about the subject have emerged (Ray, 2017, Stočes
    et al., 2016, Talavera et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). In
    addition, review papers have been published with a focus on specific subjects
    related to IoT applied in agriculture, such as Big Data (Kamilaris et al., 2017,
    Wolfert et al., 2017), modelling (O''Grady & O''Hare, 2017), Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN) (Jawad, Nordin, Gharghan, Jawad, & Ismail, 2017), food supply chain (Ramundo,
    Taisch, & Terzi, 2016), Internet of Underground Things (Vuran, Salam, Wong, &
    Irmak, 2018), chemical wireless sensors (Kassal, Steinberg, & Murkovi, 2018),
    or Farm Management Information Systems (FMIS) (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015;
    Kaloxylos et al., 2012). However, to the authors'' knowledge, no existing review
    has focused on arable farming, which has specific characteristics and challenges
    that differ from those in a controlled environment, i.e. greenhouses, or permanent
    crops such as fruit orchards. Arable farming poses particular challenges due to:
    • much larger farm sizes, which affect the design of the sensor networks, the
    data processing, analysis and extrapolation of limited stationary sensor data,
    and the consequent decision making with regards to actuators, vehicle logistics,
    etc.; • the larger farm sizes also imply that spatial data has a central role
    in arable farming, affecting the data processing, decision making and precision
    machinery employed to address in-field variability not at plant level as in most
    permanent crops, but at subfield level with automatic recognition and actuation
    (Zude-Sasse, Fountas, Gemtos, & Abu-Khalaf, 2016); • greater use of mobile sensors
    and other devices on vehicles, which have specific challenges. While other cropping
    systems may also use sensors and devices on operating machinery, arable farming
    often requires a fleet of vehicles to operate in a co-ordinated fashion. This
    creates issues particularly regarding network infrastructure (Martínez, Pastor,
    Álvarez, & Iborra, 2016), e.g. connectivity to the cloud of moving things that
    rely mainly on mobile networks, or vehicle to implement communication, which implies
    real-time interoperability between machines and devices from different manufacturers
    (Peets, Mouazen, Blackburn, Kuang, & Wiebensohn, 2012); • larger amounts of heterogeneous
    spatial data generated at different rates and from very disparate sources: stationary
    sensors, moving vehicles and implements, satellites, data from web services, etc.,
    which need to be intelligently integrated; • highly varying and uncertain environmental
    conditions, as annual crops are more susceptible to weather changes and other
    external factors than permanent crops, which are more resilient mainly due to
    their deeper roots (Zude-Sasse et al., 2016), or crops in controlled environments.
    This obligates the IoT system to handle both spatial and temporal data, increasing
    the complexity of the data processing as well as the decisions based on the data
    collected. • more diverse types of field tasks per growing season in arable farming,
    from soil preparation and crop establishment, through highly varying plant nursing
    tasks, to coordinated harvest, which increase the complexity and also the risks.
    The IoT in agriculture is a fast-developing field, which can make reviews obsolete
    quickly. This challenge can be overcome by focussing a critical view on the general
    principles, main application areas and identify the limitations and challenges.
    Summarising, the aim of the paper is to provide an up to date novel analytical
    review of the role of IoT in arable farming, with the following specific objectives:
    • Provide an overview of the current situation of IoT technologies deployed in
    arable farming. Focussing on the current use of communication technologies and
    protocols, the generation and analysis of data, and IoT architectures. • Outline
    the different applications and capabilities of IoT in arable farming. • Investigate
    the main challenges encountered by IoT enabling technologies applied to arable
    farming. • Present key potential fields of application where IoT could be employed,
    as well as future directions of the current trends. The remaining part of this
    paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the methodology used in this
    review paper. Section 3 provides an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies
    used in arable farming; Section 4 presents an outline of the current and potential
    IoT-based applications in arable farming; Section 5 discusses the challenges and
    solutions found in its implementation; and lastly, the review closes with Section
    6 in which future directions are summarised. 2. Review methodology In order to
    address the specific objectives identified above, the literature listing from
    the SCOPUS database of the last 11 years has been reviewed. More precisely, the
    timeframe investigated was from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2018, selected as
    the whole period in which any literature about the subject turned up in the studied
    database. SCOPUS was selected as the primary literature source as it is a key
    peer-reviewed research literature database. The specific keywords used in the
    search criteria where: (Internet of Things OR IoT) AND (agriculture OR farming).
    To ease the searching process, the keywords needed to be present in at least the
    title, abstract, highlights or keywords. Additionally, the articles had to be
    published in English. Articles concerning greenhouse, livestock or permanent crops
    were excluded from the survey, as were supply chain related articles. However,
    issues concerning traceability at farm level were included. The survey was performed
    in a systematic manner following three steps (see Fig. 2): • Firstly, a list of
    1193 articles meeting the search criteria mentioned above was retrieved from the
    database. • In the second step, by reading the titles, any article that was clearly
    not related to arable farming was excluded, leaving a list of 293 articles. •
    In the last step, a second screening was made by reading the abstracts, where
    articles outside the focus of this review were omitted. After this step, 167 articles
    were studied in detail, from which 69 articles were considered relevant, 27 as
    partially relevant, while the rest were considered of little relevance. Relevance
    concerned mainly the connection of the article to the subject studied. The content
    of a relevant article directly addresses the application of an IoT technology
    in an arable farming scenario. A partially relevant article studies a certain
    IoT technology in agriculture in a broader sense. In the distinction made regarding
    little relevant articles included off-topic, lack of novelty, as well as non-peer-reviewed
    articles that lacked scientific rigour, e.g. ambiguous information or absence
    of materials or methods description. Download : Download high-res image (208KB)

    The final 167 articles studied included: 77 journal papers, 88 conference papers
    and 4 book chapters, of which 19 were review papers. The final list of articles
    was complemented with other publications that expanded on some of the IoT related
    subjects and technologies mentioned in the studied articles, and did not contain
    the specified keywords. These were found by a targeted search for specific subjects.
    Lastly, in each article from the final list a special focus was made on the IoT
    technologies employed, the applications, the challenges encountered and, finally,
    on potential future perspectives. 3. IoT implementation in arable farming IoT
    has recently been gaining momentum in the farming industry as it can fulfil the
    urgent necessity for interoperability across brands, scalability and traceability
    (Kamilaris et al., 2016). Different technologies are implemented as IoT is still
    evolving, adapting to a great diversity of uses. To cover the range of technologies,
    protocols, standards, etc. employed, this review is addressing the layers in the
    IoT architecture. Three layers normally describe the architecture of the IoT in
    the literature reviewed (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Khattab et al., 2016,
    Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Na and Isaac, 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw,
    2016), though some authors divide it into more layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Ramundo et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Talavera et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2014),
    depending on their definitions. More than three layers can especially be relevant
    in IoT systems with edge or fog computing, where an edge/fog computing layer can
    be considered in between the device and network layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016). Even though the naming of the layers also varies depending on the author,
    there is nonetheless a general trend to divide the layers into device, network
    and application layers (Fig. 3). Thus, this has been the adapted structure in
    this review. The device layer consists of the physical objects (things) that are
    capable of automatic identification, sensing or actuation, and connection to the
    internet. The network layer communicates the data to a gateway (or proxy server)
    to the internet (cloud) by the use of communication protocols. And the application
    layer typically stores and facilitates access for the end-user to the processed/analysed
    information. Download : Download high-res image (222KB) Download : Download full-size

    layer, in which the middleware platform is not always present. The collected data
    experience diverse stages during their transition from sensors to cloud, interfaces,
    and occasionally actuators, and these stages have considerable influence on the
    technologies applied in an IoT context. Six main stages regarding data flow have
    been identified in the literature reviewed: sensing/perception, communication/transport/transfer,
    storage, processing, analytics, and actuation and display (Fig. 4). The order
    of the stages is different depending on the IoT setup employed and the computing
    techniques used, e.g. fog and edge computing processes the data before communicating
    it to the cloud, an example of its application in precision farming is given by
    Ferrández-Pastor et al. (2016); while cloud computing processes the data in the
    cloud, examples of this are given by Hernandez-Rojas, Mazon-Olivo, Novillo-Vicuña,
    and Belduma-Vacacela (2018) and Na and Isaac (2016). Nonetheless, sensing/perception
    is normally the first stage, where data are captured by sensors, then the data
    can follow different paths and does not necessarily go through all the steps listed.
    In summary, IoT data is identified to be gathered or generated through three main
    processes: machine generated, which come from sensing devices; process-mediated,
    i.e. commercial data coming from business processes; and human-sourced, recorded
    by humans and digitalised later on (Balducci, Impedovo, Informatica, & Moro, 2018).
    These different sources have an influence on how to process, analyse and use the
    data in IoT solutions, and this needs to be taken into account in the overall
    data acquisition planning process. Download : Download high-res image (171KB)

    in arable farming. 3.1. Device layer As mentioned above, the device layer consists
    of the physical objects (things) that are capable of automatic identification,
    sensing or actuating, and providing connection to the internet. Sensor devices
    measure and collect one or more parameters automatically and transmit the data
    wirelessly to the cloud. And, when the devices become actuators, they generally,
    in turn, receive data from the cloud in order to activate or deactivate some mechanical
    component, e.g. a valve in an irrigation system. The device layer is also often
    called perception layer (Tzounis et al., 2017, Zou and Quan, 2017), sensing layer
    (Na and Isaac, 2016, Wang et al., 2014), or physical layer (Ramundo et al., 2016,
    Talavera et al., 2017). The devices are constituted of a transceiver, a microcontroller,
    an interfacing circuit and one or more sensors and/or actuators. The sensor measures
    a physical parameter, e.g. air temperature that is interpreted and transformed
    into an equivalent analogue signal, i.e. electric voltage or current, which is
    then converted by the interfacing circuit, i.e. Analogue-to-Digital Converter
    (ADC), into a corresponding digital format. Afterwards, the microcontroller, sometimes
    also in the form of microprocessors or single-board computers (Talavera et al.,
    2017), collects the data in digital format from one or more sensors through the
    ADC, and sends them to the transceiver, i.e. a wireless communication module,
    which communicates the data to a gateway. A comparison of microcontrollers and
    single-board computers used in IoT in agriculture has been made by Ray (2017).
    In the case of edge computing, the microcontroller or single-board computer processes
    the data from one or more sensors before communicating them, with the intention
    of, for example, reducing the amount of data to be transferred to the cloud and
    accelerating the data processing (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et
    al., 2016). In fog computing the data are processed in the local area network
    level, i.e. in a fog node or IoT gateway (Ahmed, Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed,
    De et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018). When employing an actuator, the
    signal is received by the transceiver, communicated to the microcontroller, where
    it is then converted to analogue signal by a Digital-to-Analogue Converter (DAC),
    i.e. the interfacing circuit, or to a digital signal by a Digital-to-Digital Converter,
    and finally interpreted by the actuator, which acts in accordance to the signal
    received. In arable farming, when agricultural machinery data are used, i.e. data
    from sensors and devices mounted on tractors or other agricultural machinery,
    the data in digital format is normally collected and accessible through the Controller
    Area Network (CAN) bus in the machine, although in some cases some data are accessible
    through other ports (Oksanen et al., 2016, Peets et al., 2012). Machine and operator
    performance information is accessible through the Machine and Implement Control
    System (MICS) of the machine, which can also be accessed through the CAN bus data.
    MICS data are used to allow machinery operators and farm managers to monitor and
    potentially improve the efficiency of their machines, by employing e.g. smart
    alerts or recommendation systems (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015). Global Navigation Satellite
    System (GNSS) data, e.g. Real Time Kinematics GPS (RTK-GPS), are often also available
    through the CAN bus port, which allows, among others, vehicle monitoring and dynamic
    optimised route planning Edwards et al., 2017, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018. Many
    different sensors and actuators are employed in arable farming. The type of device
    used depends on the purpose of the system in addition to the technologies implemented
    in the system. And the number of devices is steadily increasing. The number of
    IoT device installations in farms is expected to increase globally from 30 million
    installations in 2015 to 75 million in 2020. Furthermore, data points generated
    per day and farm are expected to increase from 190000 in 2014 to over half a million
    by 2020 (Meola, 2016). It was also estimated that by 2018 there would be 10 billion
    IoT devices employed in agriculture. However, the great amount of data generated
    is often unused or underutilised (Bennett, 2015), e.g. in countries like Denmark
    with a relative high ICT adoption in farms, in 2016 only 2–5% of farmers worked
    actively with the data generated (SEGES, 2016). Even if data usage is still relatively
    low, it is expected to increase rapidly (Bennett, 2015, Wolfert et al., 2017,
    World Bank, 2017) An overview about how they are implemented for different purposes
    is presented in the Applications section. 3.2. Network layer The network layer
    communicates the data initially to an intermediary platform and eventually to
    the internet (cloud), and from there to, for example, employed actuators. When
    the data are transferred to the intermediary platform, it typically uses wireless
    communication technologies, for instance RFID, WSN with Zigbee, LoRa (Long Range),
    etc., and more recently Near-Field Communication (NFC) (Kassal et al., 2018, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). The intermediary platform
    is normally an internet gateway located in the vicinity of the connected devices,
    also including sometimes a proxy server, where the data are collected and occasionally
    processed in order to send the information further to the end user through the
    internet by the use of e.g. MQTT standards, or HTML or XMPP protocols. The use
    of Android smart devices or other operating systems is also increasing in popularity
    among agricultural applications, as they can be employed as a gateway for 3G and
    4G networks, and they frequently include other wireless communication technologies,
    e.g. Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPRS and NFC. They also automatically conform to communication
    standards and protocols, in which way interoperability is increased (Balmos et
    al., 2016, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Gao and Yao, 2016, Hernandez-Rojas et
    al., 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). In addition, Android and other smart
    devices can include GNSS and RGB camera sensors, and can relatively easily be
    programmed for computing data and displaying Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications
    being able to straightforwardly update the software if necessary. In that manner,
    Android and similar smart devices are represented in all three IoT layers, i.e.
    sensing in the device layer, node or gateway in the network layer, and computing
    data and displaying GUI in the application layer. Furthermore, the automatic software
    updating possibilities of smart devices allow remote installation of updates with
    new functionalities, bug fixes, etc. and easily improve the interoperability of
    the system (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). Many different wireless technologies
    have been applied for diverse purposes in agriculture, depending on economic,
    accessibility and capability factors. Jawad et al., 2017, Ray, 2017 and Tzounis
    et al. (2017) have presented good overviews of the specifications of wireless
    communication technologies implemented in IoT in an agricultural context, which
    have been here collected in Table 1 and complemented with information from other
    relevant articles (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Elijah et al., 2018, Kassal et al.,
    2018, Sinha et al., 2017, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). The great variety of technologies,
    standards and frequency bands used exposes the relevant interoperability and application
    challenges found when applying IoT technologies. Potential communication standards
    for smart farming can be classified into short-range and long-range according
    to their communication distance, which determines their specific usability in
    different requirement settings. This is particularly the case in arable farming,
    where mobile network accessibility can be an issue in many rural areas, and where
    large farm sizes limit the use of some wireless technologies due to their reduced
    communication distance and due to the necessity to replace/recharge device batteries
    on nodes over large areas. These issues are addressed in the challenges section
    later. Table 1. Wireless communication technologies (adapted from Jawad et al.,

    m 1 mW a Not yet publicly available. A WSN is formed by pervasive devices called
    motes or sensor nodes, which integrate sensors and actuators that communicate
    wirelessly forming a spatial network (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). In a WSN, base stations act as gateways forwarding
    the data to the cloud. Different communication technologies support different
    network node architectures, e.g. star, tree or mesh. Depending on the application,
    different wireless communication technologies are employed in a WSN as each has
    different node architecture possibilities, data rates, ranges, standards, among
    others, with the use of ZigBee, LoRa, Bluetooth/BLE, WiFi and SigFox being relatively
    common in agriculture. In arable farming, BLE has for example been employed for
    soil and air monitoring and irrigation control (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018);
    ZigBee was used in a WSN for monitoring soil conditions and actuating an irrigation
    system (Mafuta et al., 2012) and crop monitoring (Zhai, 2017); and LoRa for air
    and water temperature of rice paddy fields (Tanaka, 2018) and smart irrigation
    control (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018). In order to cover
    larger distances, GPRS is appropriate and has been used for irrigation control
    (López-Riquelme et al., 2017), and for remote maintenance of machinery (Miettinen,
    Oksanen, Suomi, & Visala, 2006). GPRS, or other technologies, such as LTE, or
    3G/4G, are also commonly used at the gateway to transmit data to the cloud. Regarding
    other less common communication technologies used in WSNs, RFID can be integrated
    into a WSN too by connecting the RFID tag readers to a radio-frequency transceiver
    (Costa et al., 2013). Passive and active RFID technologies are used to a great
    extent in agricultural research and industry (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), especially
    for animal production (e.g. Kamilaris et al., 2016), as well as vegetable or fruit
    product traceability (e.g. Kodali, Jain, & Karagwal, 2017); however, in arable
    farming only few examples have been found: e.g. RFID tags used for irrigation
    scheduling (Vellidis, Tucker, Perry, Kvien, & Bednarz, 2008), for agrochemical
    traceability (Peets, Gasparin, Blackburn, & Godwin, 2009), for vehicle monitoring
    (Sjolander, Thomasson, Sui, & Ge, 2011), and even on a prototype for soil temperature
    monitoring (Hamrita & Hoffacker, 2005). Regarding NFC, no concrete examples of
    NFC used in arable farming have been found in the literature reviewed. Finally,
    the latest generation of mobile communications, i.e. 5G, has higher data rates,
    large coverage areas, higher peak throughput, and also improved flexibility, which
    can open new possibilities and may solve some of the challenges encountered by
    many IoT solutions (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Marsch et al., 2016). 5G allows new
    options for monitoring rural areas with no previous infrastructure for Internet
    connection (Faraci, Raciti, Rizzo, & Schembra, 2018). 5G can also improve vehicle-to-vehicle
    or vehicle-to-anything communication in e.g. logistics solutions, due to its low
    latency and new frequency bands (Marsch et al., 2016). A challenge for the 5G
    networks will be the great increase in devices to support once IoT becomes a standard
    solution not only in agriculture, but also in any sphere of everyday life. 3.3.
    Application layer The application layer is crucial in an IoT context as it is
    this layer that actually adds value to the sensed and communicated data through
    directly controlling devices, supporting farmers'' decision making, etc. In this
    layer, several important services occur such as data storage, data analytics,
    data access through an appropriate Application Programming Interface (API), as
    well as possibly a user interfaced software application. The layer may also include
    middleware platforms that aid handling the heterogeneous cloud data improving
    interoperability. Data storage can be cloud based, i.e. on multiple servers, or
    more local based, where data are stored in different types of databases, depending
    on the application and design. Even if relational databases, such as Structured
    Query Language (SQL) databases (Gao and Yao, 2016, Goap et al., 2018, Ray, 2017,
    Wang et al., 2014), MySQL (Kaloxylos et al., 2014), or PostgreSQL (Mazon-Olivo,
    Hernández-Rojas, Maza-Salinas, & Pan, 2018) are employed in some of the reported
    applications in the reviewed articles, non-relational databases, such as Not only
    SQL (NoSQL), or also SPARQL, a semantic query language based database, are gaining
    attention due to their flexibility and scalability, especially when dealing with
    Big Data. Their ability to store and manage large amounts of heterogeneous data
    makes them suitable in many IoT agricultural contexts (Huang and Zhang, 2017,
    Kamilaris et al., 2017). Examples of NoSQL employed in agriculture are Cassandra
    (Huang & Zhang, 2017), Dynamo (Xian, 2017), HBase (Ray, 2017, Wang et al., 2014)
    and MongoDB (Martínez et al., 2016). An example of SPARQL has been given by Jayaraman
    et al. (2016). Data analytics can be achieved by cloud computing, where computer
    resources are managed remotely to analyse data, often Big Data, or by distributed
    computing, e.g. edge and fog computing. Cloud computing has the advantage that
    it provides high quality services that allow independent execution of multiple
    applications as if they were isolated, even if they are on the same platform,
    e.g. in data centres, which is especially relevant when dealing with Big Data
    (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Martínez et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017). However,
    cloud computing techniques mostly rely on general purpose cloud providers that
    do not comply with specific agricultural service requirements (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017) and can experience latency issues, which are not acceptable in IoT
    solutions where monitoring, control and analysis require fast performance (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2018). Examples of application of cloud computing related to arable farming
    are given by Khattab et al., 2016, Na and Isaac, 2016 and López-Riquelme et al.
    (2017). Khattab et al. (2016) present an IoT architecture with a cloud-based back-end
    where weather and soil data are processed and analysed for automatic activation
    of irrigation and spraying actions. Na and Isaac (2016) describe a human-centric
    IoT architecture with a list of cloud services, such as language translation,
    data simplification or updated market price information. And López-Riquelme et
    al. (2017) use FIWARE components for a cloud service for smart irrigation tasks,
    focussing on the benefits of using FIWARE as cloud provider. Regarding Big Data
    analysis and Big Data in general in an agricultural context, Kamilaris et al.
    (2017) and Wolfert et al. (2017) respectively have performed exhaustive reviews
    on the subject. The use of IoT middleware platforms is gaining interest due to
    its potential for solving different challenges found in the application of IoT,
    especially interoperability. IoT middleware platforms try to simplify the complex
    communication through the cloud due to heterogeneity of devices, communications
    and networks, by using enablers like standardised APIs and protocols (Jayaraman
    et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017). Examples of
    these are HYDRA, UBIWARE, UBIROAD, UBIDOTS, SMEPP, SIXTH, Think Speak, SensorCloud,
    Amazon IoT and IBM IoT, with focus on context aware functionality; SOCRADES, GSN
    and SIRENA, with more focus on security and privacy; Aneka, WSO2, PubNub, SmartFarmNet
    and FIWARE, with a wider services-oriented approach; and projects like IoT-A,
    OpenIoT, or ArrowHead (Gill et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2015, Jayaraman et
    al., 2016, Kamilaris et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016). Even if all these and more solutions are found in the IoT market,
    an intelligent middleware solution that addresses most issues observed in smart
    farming successfully is yet to be implemented (Jayaraman et al., 2016, Martínez
    et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). However, FIWARE (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    López-Riquelme et al., 2017, Martínez et al., 2016, Rodriguez et al., 2018) and
    SmartFarmNet (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Jayaraman et al., 2016) have been
    implemented effectively for precision and smart farming applications. In order
    to communicate data across platforms and IoT devices, ensuring interoperability,
    APIs are essential. These should adapt to evolving or new standards in order to
    ensure a longer life span, which may become a limitation if the APIs are not updated.
    It is through the APIs that data are made available for the IoT applications (e.g.
    Goap et al., 2018, Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018). These services may include tracing,
    monitoring, event management, forecasting or optimisation for agricultural activities
    and products. These applications related to arable farming are described in the
    next section. 4. Current and potential applications Multiple applications can
    be derived from the implementation of IoT in arable farming. These applications
    can always be conceptualised into the three IoT layers described previously, and
    are not to be confused with the application layer. Elaborations of the reviewed
    articles show that the applications have been differentiated and categorised as
    follows: monitoring, documentation, forecasting and controlling. Monitoring refers
    to timely sensing of very diverse parameters and is mostly the initial point of
    entry for other applications. Documentation covers the storing of sampled data
    for later use in e.g. farm management or traceability of produce. Forecasting
    employs different sources of data through precisely designed analytic methods
    for predicting concrete events. And controlling is the result of active monitoring,
    where processed data are used to automatically activate and control actuators
    in a predefined manner. A summarising table collects all the IoT applications
    in arable farming described in this chapter (Table 2). Most IoT-based systems
    include at least two of these applications and isolated applications are seldom
    seen. In addition, special attention has been paid to FMIS and associated decision
    support to improve operations and production processes involving vehicle positioning
    analytics, optimisation and logistics, which are key elements in arable farming
    (Bochtis et al., 2011, Bochtis et al., 2014) and have consequently got a section
    of their own. Table 2. IoT applications in arable farming. Applications Examples

    Automatic monitoring is the obvious first step in IoT applied to agriculture.
    Strategically placed sensors can automatically sense and transmit data to the
    cloud for further documentation, forecasting or controlling applications. Sensors
    are used to monitor crop parameters such as leaf area index (e.g. Bauer & Aschenbruck,
    2018), plant height and leaf colour, size and shape (e.g. Okayasu et al., 2017);
    soil parameters such as soil moisture (e.g. Brinkhoff et al., 2017, Kodali and
    Sahu, 2016) or soil chemistry (e.g. Kassal et al., 2018); irrigation water parameters
    such as pH and salinity (e.g. Popović et al., 2017); or weather parameters such
    as air temperature, air pressure, air relative humidity, rainfall, radiation,
    wind speed and wind direction (e.g. Yan et al., 2018). In addition, remote sensing
    can also be employed, i.e. instead of sensors placed in the field they are installed
    on satellites or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). However, these measurements mostly
    require some form of processing and interpretation as the values sampled are not
    directly related to the targeted parameters. An example of monitoring through
    remote sensing is the estimation of crop biomass and nitrogen content by the use
    of hyper- and multispectral images (Näsi et al., 2018), or the use of thermal
    remote sensing, which has been applied for e.g. irrigation scheduling or plant
    disease detection (Khanal, Fulton, & Shearer, 2017). Furthermore, agricultural
    machinery can also be remotely monitored, e.g. vehicle position and yield data
    (Oksanen et al., 2016), or machine performance (Miettinen et al., 2006). This
    is especially relevant with the increasing appearance of autonomous vehicles and
    robots in agriculture (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). Finally, at farm level the storage
    of crops can also be monitored to ensure the correct control of, for example,
    temperature and moisture, and avoid losses due to damage (Green et al., 2009,
    Juul et al., 2015). Environmental impact indicators should be integrated into
    farm monitoring applications, so that leaching (Burton, Dave, Fernandez, Jayachandran,
    & Bhansali, 2018), contaminants (Severino, D’Urso, Scarfato, & Toraldo, 2018)
    or emissions (Manap & Najib, 2014) are addressed too. 4.2. Documentation and traceability
    Collected operations and process data once stored can be used for documentation.
    Documentation is usually the natural application of monitored data but it must
    be noted that it can also include other types of sampled data, such as manually
    input or documentation of performed control actions (Sørensen, Pesonen, Bochtis,
    Vougioukas, & Suomi, 2011). The data are stored as raw data or as processed data
    at different levels. Documentation is essential for decision-making, controlling
    or analytics, and is an indispensable element in FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    Mapping is also a form of documentation where data are spatially projected onto
    a map. On-the-go sensors installed on vehicles and implements can be used for
    automated field mapping (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015), e.g. yield mapping used
    for later fertilisation planning (Lyle, Bryan, & Ostendorf, 2014), or soil mapping
    for site-specific amendment measures (Godwin and Miller, 2003, McBratney et al.,
    2003). Remote sensing can also be used for mapping crop development (Khanal et
    al., 2017, Näsi et al., 2018, Viljanen et al., 2018), or soil texture and residue
    coverage (Khanal et al., 2017). Remote sensing is becoming a popular tool for
    monitoring and mapping, but is yet to be proven feasible for all its potential
    applications. When documentation data sets extend beyond the farm level so that
    they can be traced throughout the supply chain, it is often referred as traceability
    and this notion is a key element in agri-food supply chain management as a measure
    to satisfy, for example, consumer demands (Bochtis and Sørensen, 2014, Pesonen
    et al., 2014). 4.3. Forecasting Forecasting is one of the fundamental functions
    for decision making that IoT brings to agriculture. Access to “real-time” data
    and historical data is used for forecasting events that require some form of action
    for managing successfully the crop or field operation. Therefore, both monitoring
    and documentation are important prerequisites for enabling forecasting. Forecasting
    is employed as preventive measures that require some action due to a predicted
    event, e.g. weeding, irrigating or harvesting. Machine learning and scientific
    modelling are examples of tools employed for forecasting. Different machine learning
    models have been employed, e.g. Artificial Neural Networks for forecasting maximum
    and minimum temperatures at field level (Aliev, 2018) or for estimating levels
    of phosphorus (P) in the soil (Estrada-López, Castillo-Atoche, Vázquez-castillo,
    & Sánchez-Sinencio, 2018); support vector regression method for forecasting soil
    moisture (Goap et al., 2018) or plant disease detection (Aasha Nandhini, Hemalatha,
    Radha, & Indumathi, 2017); gradient boosting for predicting irrigation recommendations
    (Goldstein, Fink, & Meitin, 2018); Bayesian networks and random forest for frost
    prediction (Diedrichs, Bromberg, Dujovne, Brun-laguna, & Watteyne, 2018); multiple
    linear regression and random forest in estimating yield and fertilisation requirements
    for forecasting harvest and fertilisation dates (Viljanen et al., 2018); or also
    for frost prediction using four different machine learning algorithms: decision
    tree, boosted tree, random forest, and regression (Moon, Kim, Zhang, & Woo, 2018).
    A rather different forecasting approach was employed by Jain, Sarangi, Bhatt,
    and Pappula (2018), where three different models, i.e. random forest, support
    vector machine and artificial neural network were used for forecasting diseases
    and at the same time for adaptive data collection from the network of nodes in
    order to reduce data traffic and energy consumption of the network. Summarising,
    IoT is allowing the sampling of large amounts of data, which can be employed as
    training data by the machine learning algorithms to build predictive mathematical
    models. Machine learning is opening new possibilities for effectively forecasting
    events in arable farming, which might change the very nature of decision making
    in agriculture. Scientific modelling has also been employed for forecasting in
    an IoT context, e.g. soil moisture dynamics and contaminant migration forecasting
    using soil sensor data and precipitation forecasts for irrigation scheduling (Severino
    et al., 2018); fungal disease forecast in winter wheat (El Jarroudi et al., 2017)
    and barley (Mäyrä, Ruusunen, Jalli, Jauhiainen, & Leiviskä, 2018); or forecasting
    field trafficability and workability for field operations (Edwards, White, Munkholm,
    Sørensen, & Lamandé, 2016). These modelling tools have an important role in agriculture
    as they are conscientiously developed and validated by the scientific community,
    and can forecast events for which machine learning models are very limited. There
    is also considerable potential for integrating existing and acknowledged modelling
    tools such as the soil-crop-atmosphere system model DAISY (Abrahamsen & Hansen,
    2000) or the soil erosion model RUSLE (Renard, Foster, Weesies, & Porter, 1991)
    into an IoT solution. Many of these solutions can make agriculture in general,
    and arable farming in particular, more resource efficient, e.g. through smart
    irrigation, as well as environmentally friendly, e.g. by smart pest and disease
    management. 4.4. Controlling In IoT, controlling is the result of active monitoring
    in an automated system, where the monitored variables are automatically adjusted
    to, for example, predefined thresholds. Forecasting can also play an important
    role in controlling. This is, for example, the case in smart irrigation systems,
    where irrigation is activated before drought damage in the crop is recognised,
    thus reducing yield losses. Goap et al. (2018) employed real-time sensing of soil
    moisture and soil temperature in combination with weather forecasts to control
    a fully autonomous irrigation scheme. Sensors on-the-go installed in tractors
    and implements can also be used to control e.g. variable rate fertilisation (Peets
    et al., 2012), site-specific weed control technologies (Christensen et al., 2009),
    or in-row cultivation controlled by plant patterns in precision seeding (Midtiby,
    Steen, & Green, 2018). Controlling is crucial in smart farming as it allows the
    automation of systems, especially considering the operations of autonomous vehicles
    and robots in the fields (Bechar & Vigneault, 2016), where site-specific actions
    and sensing-based safety systems will play an important role, e.g. for in-field
    obstacle detection for autonomous vehicles (Christiansen, Nielsen, Steen, Jørgensen,
    & Karstoft, 2016). 4.5. FMIS FMIS can be defined as systems that store and process
    farm-related collected data and provide decision supporting tools for farm management
    (Paraforos et al., 2016). FMIS assist farmers in the execution and documentation
    of farm activities, their evaluation and optimisation, as well as in strategic,
    tactical and operational planning of the farm operations (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    FMIS are consequently systems that can encapsulate all the applications previously
    described, and are vital elements in smart farm management. However, the adoption
    of FMIS targeted to the new IoT technologies is slow. A study published in 2015
    showed that most FMIS architectures used at that time had been designed in the
    1980s by researchers. This may explain why most FMIS currently have a structure
    and an architecture that is not suitable for distributed and service oriented
    decision support required for supporting precision agriculture and smart farming
    solutions, e.g. 75% of FMIS are still PC-based, and functionalities regarding
    traceability, quality assurance and agronomic best practice estimate are still
    missing or in their initial development stages in most commercial FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al., 2015). FMIS are key in smart farming and they should support
    automatic data acquisition, monitoring, documenting, planning and decision making
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). The latest research on IoT-based FMIS is expected
    to become part of the commercial FMIS available in the near future and will cover
    different needs across the supply chain and needs of IoT-based agriculture as
    a whole, as well as complying with standards ensuring interoperability between
    systems. In addition, decision support systems (DSS) are essential in dealing
    with Big Data and assisting the farm manager in management and decision making
    in tasks such as farm financial analysis, business processes or supply chain functions
    (Fountas, Carli et al., 2015, Kaloxylos et al., 2012). In order to design an up-to-date
    FMIS, it is beneficial to make preliminary use of dedicated system analysis methodologies,
    such as soft system methodologies (SSM), for identifying required changes and
    constraints and proposing solutions, followed by a later hard system modelling
    for designing the required specifications and components of the system (Sørensen
    et al., 2010, Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015). It is also necessary to base FMIS
    on the cloud as it allows interconnection with diverse additional services (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). This development points out the inevitable need for standardisation
    of APIs in order to achieve interoperability among applications and services as
    part of the FMIS. New technologies such as distributed management systems can
    also enhance the capabilities of FMIS to a great extent (Fountas, Sørensen et
    al., 2015). Furthermore, the introduction of agricultural moving robots in the
    near future, as well as the wireless and automatic control and monitoring of agricultural
    machinery, also needs to be considered in the design and development of FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al, 2015, Paraforos et al., 2016). The future FMIS will also be capable
    of emulating farmers different work habits, as the system will automate certain
    tasks previously performed by farmers, which will require additional training
    (Sørensen et al., 2011). Consequently, it is important to provide supportive adoption
    and transition strategies for conventional farming to convert into smart farming
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). Examples of current FMIS employed in arable farming
    are offered by different technology providers: machine manufacturers, institutions
    or targeted private companies. Some manufacturers provide their own farm management
    tools, such as Agricultural Management Solutions (AMS) from John Deere, or Precision
    Land Management (PLM) from New Holland. Across brands some FMIS have a more local
    approach, e.g. the Dutch Akkerweb developed by Wageningen University and Research,
    while other commercial solutions have a global approach, e.g. 365FarmNet, Agworld
    or FarmWorks. 4.6. Vehicle navigation, optimisation and logistics Navigation systems
    are widely used in arable farming with the successful implementation of auto-steering
    systems in tractors and harvesters. However, IoT-based solutions are still in
    their early stages. IoT-based field operation monitoring (Oksanen et al., 2016)
    or monitoring of motor and machine performance (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015) have been
    effectively implemented on harvesting operations. Commercial examples of agricultural
    telematics are Trimble''s Connected Farm, AGCO''s AgCommand, John Deer JDLink,
    New Holland''s PLM Connect or CLAAS’ telematics; however, they are all closed
    systems, which limits greatly the possibilities of the IoT technologies, especially
    interoperability (Oksanen, Piirainen, & Seilonen, 2015). Regarding optimised route
    planning, pre-planning harvest operations based on field data using simulation
    models can improve the harvest capacity of the vehicle or fleet saving working
    hours as well as fuel consumption (Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Bochtis and Sørensen,
    2009, Busato et al., 2007, Jensen et al., 2012, Zhou et al., 2014). However, field
    complexity and vehicle fleet size can become major hurdles for the algorithms
    employed (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019, Skou-Nielsen et al., 2017). The accessibility
    of field and harvest data can be eased by IoT technologies that allow automated
    data collection and sharing via common communication protocols and standards,
    in interoperable data formats, with compatible data model hierarchies; however,
    this is not always the case (Tzounis et al., 2017). IoT also allows cloud or fog
    computing to be employed to solve the high computational requirements of these
    route planning models (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019), even though the computing can
    also be achieved at the edge (Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Data communication
    costs, latency problems and unstable mobile connectivity may pose important challenges
    for route planning applications that rely only on cloud computing, making mobile
    edge computing more adequate and robust for these systems. Nevertheless, true
    IoT-based dynamic route planning is still in its infancy but gaining increasing
    attention, especially with the arrival of agricultural robots (Bechar and Vigneault,
    2016, Kayacan et al., 2015). Concerning its application, until recently, harvest
    logistics has employed field sampled data, i.e. boundaries, obstacles, gates,
    etc., to optimise the route of the vehicles involved in the operation statically
    (e.g. Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Jensen et al., 2012), where the complete routes
    of all vehicles are planned a priori. Nevertheless, these plans often do not comply
    with real-world challenges as they do not adapt to variating inputs, e.g. vehicle
    speed changes or in-field yield variations, or to unforeseen situations, e.g.
    machine breakdowns, eventual out of field delays, non-trafficable wet spots, undefined
    obstacles, etc. There is consequently the need to integrate route optimisation
    and operation logistics in IoT systems, where the optimisation can adapt dynamically
    to varying input and unforeseen events. It is only in the last few years that
    harvest logistics really started adapting dynamically to parameters such as vehicles''
    behaviour or in-field yield variations (Edwards et al., 2017, Seyyedhasani and
    Dvorak, 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Today, new possibilities for optimising
    infield operations arrive with the large amount of data available via internet,
    e.g. remote sensing data or other collected spatial data. These could be adaptive
    planning based on trafficability maps for reducing soil compaction or avoiding
    vehicles getting stuck in wet spots; or selective harvesting based on predicted
    grain quality maps, which is expected to increase the value of the crop harvested.
    5. Challenges and solutions When implementing IoT in arable farming, as well as
    in other contexts, diverse challenges limit or affect the performance of the systems
    employed. The challenges identified in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5) can indicate
    which areas need to be taken into account when designing an IoT-based system or
    point out areas that require further research. However, the results presented
    in the figure are indicative and do not necessarily describe the importance of
    the challenges included, especially because of the multiple applications and implementation
    designs that are conceivable in arable farming. Any of the challenges can become
    crucial in different setups, and are therefore described. In addition, all challenges
    can be related to or have consequences for other challenges. Download : Download

    of challenges mentioned by the literature reviewed, divided by time periods and
    grouped in IoT layers. Interoperability, in general, is a major hurdle in the
    application of IoT. There are different dimensions related to it: technical, syntactical,
    semantic and organisational (Serrano et al., 2015, Veer and Wiles, 2008). Technical
    interoperability refers mostly to the communication protocols which affect the
    hardware and software components implemented. Syntactical interoperability is
    usually related to data formats, their syntax and encoding. Semantic interoperability
    concerns the interpretation of data contents, i.e. the meaning of the information
    exchanged. And organisational interoperability involves intercommunication of
    meaningful information across organisations regardless of information systems
    and infrastructures in a world-wide scale. As interoperability is such a generic
    term, in this section, technical interoperability has been addressed as part of
    the communication protocol challenge, syntactical and semantic interoperability
    have been included under the data heterogeneity challenge, and organisational
    interoperability have been described under the scalability challenge. 5.1. General
    challenges 5.1.1. Revenue and affordability Often the investment for establishing
    an IoT-based solution is high and as such challenging for small-scale farmers,
    while larger farms can more easily acquire IoT-based technologies when investing
    in new equipment (Brewster et al., 2017). The uncertainty regarding required costs,
    e.g. fuel or water allocations, and selling prices of the product give little
    margin for many farmers for investing in new technologies (Higgins et al., 2017).
    Trust plays an important role when investing in IoT systems, and relieving the
    perceived risks by demonstrating the revenues from their adoption is essential
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Jayashankar et al., 2018). For example, in Europe
    70% of all fertilising and spraying machinery is equipped with at least one precision
    agriculture technology, but only 25% of farmers actually use precision agriculture
    components on their farms (Say, Keskin, Sehri, & Sekerli, 2017). Technology providers
    need to increase the perceived value by demonstrating the financial return from
    IoT in order to diminish the perceived risk of adoption many farmers have. Technology
    providers need also to provide robust tools that are aligned with farmer needs
    and practices in order to gain acceptance and trust of IoT technologies. These
    technologies need to reduce the workload, assist in decision making and improve
    the efficiency of the targeted practice. Additionally, technology providers need
    to develop interoperable and flexible solutions that can easily be integrated
    and comply with accepted standards. Governments can also incentivise IoT adoption
    by policies and regulations, especially regarding documentation and traceability
    as ICT eases paperwork and bureaucracy. A reduction in the percentage of mentions
    regarding this challenge (see Fig. 5) could indicate that IoT is being more adopted
    in arable farming. In addition, IoT is likely to reshape the arable farming business.
    The implementation of monitoring and control of farming operations are generating
    substantial amounts of valuable data that are essential for the business of technology
    providers. The way farmers will dive into the data economy, i.e. connecting their
    data to work in vertical and horizontal networks beyond the farm, will have an
    effect on their business models, as well as on the business models of technology
    providers. The point of view of the farmer''s business regarding IoT has not been
    fully addressed in the literature reviewed and will require further investigation.
    5.1.2. Data heterogeneity The diverse data sources and sensor manufacturers imply
    use of different unit systems, data structures and nomenclatures in different
    data formats, which result in reduced syntactical and semantic interoperability
    among IoT environments. Sensor data can be encoded in binary, or represented in
    formats such as json, xml, text (e.g. csv), shapefile, or even proprietary formats.
    The heterogeneity of data types and formats can also affect the performance of
    a protocol employed for communicating the information. Furthermore, this challenge
    becomes critical in situations such as system integration or sharing data with
    other systems (e.g. FMIS), which could imply developing data conversion tools
    or even redesign of the IoT setup. The use of standardised formats can help with
    this challenge. Some attempts have been made at producing standards or standardised
    formats that cover the great heterogeneity of agricultural data, e.g. ISO 11783
    (ISOBUS) developed by the Agricultural Industry Electronics Foundation (AEF) for
    tractors and agricultural machinery, which is very relevant in arable farming
    (Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015, Miettinen et al., 2006, Oksanen et al., 2015,
    Peets et al., 2012) or AgroXML developed by the Association for Technologies and
    Structures in Agriculture (KTBL) mainly for FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014, Köksal
    and Tekinerdogan, 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Peets et al., 2012). These
    are now being integrated by the non-profit organisation AgGateway through the
    ADAPT framework and SPADE project for seamlessly communicating agricultural machinery
    data to FMIS, trying to enhance the existing standards and as a consequence improve
    interoperability (Brewster et al., 2017). A drawback of comprehensive data models,
    which try to describe all attributes of agricultural data, is that they become
    too cumbersome to handle in many applications. Finally, the use of middleware
    platforms applicable in smart farming, e.g. FIWARE or SmartFarmNet, can also reduce
    the problems caused by data heterogeneity (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Ferreira
    et al., 2017, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). 5.1.3. Scalability
    and flexibility Organisational interoperability is a key element concerning scalability
    and flexibility (Serrano et al., 2015, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). Many
    of the systems described in the literature reviewed are centralised, closed, difficult
    to integrate in other existing platforms or difficult to implement on larger scales,
    different farming systems or geographical areas. They are also challenging to
    integrate beyond the farm level and across the supply chain in order to provide
    agri-food safety and traceability. The use of standardised dynamic protocols,
    such as SOAP protocol (cloud-based infrastructures with extensible ontologies
    that cover the broad and diverse agricultural production systems and environments),
    fast and reliable APIs (e.g. RESTful) and middleware platforms applicable for
    smart agriculture, such as FIWARE with its generic enablers, are tools that are
    employed to achieve organisational interoperability and make the system developed
    more scalable and flexible (Ferreira et al., 2017, López-Riquelme et al., 2017,
    O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). Service-Oriented Architectures
    (SOA) also bring possibilities to effectively integrate ecosystems through open
    and standardised interfaces, increasing organisational interoperability (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014, Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Kruize et al., 2016, Pesonen et al.,
    2014, Sørensen and Bochtis, 2010). Scalability and flexibility may also refer
    to WSNs in the literature, to their capacity to support an increasing number of
    devices/nodes, with the network architecture, the gateway and protocols used being
    the main constrains (Elijah et al., 2018). This challenge has been considered
    under the network size challenge. 5.1.4. Robustness and fault tolerance Many different
    factors can affect the overall robustness and fault tolerance of a system. Robust
    wireless connectivity is an important limitation in many setups (Oksanen et al.,
    2016, Vuran et al., 2018). In the design of an IoT-based solution dealing with
    faults, errors and unforeseen events need to be taken into account in order to
    ensure the reliability of the system. Many of these issues are related to the
    other challenges presented here and can be handled at the device level, but also
    need to be thought of in the overall IoT system design (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    Ray, 2017). 5.1.5. Complexity The agricultural system is complex and can be challenging
    to work with. It is complex not only because of the multifaceted nature of the
    physical, chemical and/or biological processes in the soil-crop-air system, but
    also because of the technical complexity of hardware and software interacting
    with it. Depending on the novelty of the IoT technology implemented and the background
    of the developer and user, the systems can become more or less complex. For example,
    software and hardware incompatibilities can challenge its implementation and integration
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016), as well as many other challenges, e.g. the great
    field task diversity in arable farming, that can add complexity to the system.
    Technical knowledge can become a major hurdle for the implementation of IoT in
    farms, and it is therefore important that user-friendliness and plug-and-play
    basis have a high priority for the technology providers (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Zou and Quan, 2017). Complexity should be an issue for the technology provider
    and not for the customer. In addition, the co-created development and implementation
    of IoT systems in agriculture by a multi-actor approach is needed to overcome
    the complexity at different levels of integrating IoT in agriculture. Good examples
    of this are the European Union supported research and development efforts through
    multi-actor large-scale pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Verdouw et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019). 5.1.6. Lack of products In the early stages of precision
    agriculture and IoT in agriculture, products that integrated agronomy and ICT
    engineering were lacking, which hindered their adoption (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Kitchen and Roger, 2007). The large scales and diversity of environments
    in arable farming can challenge the products used even more than in controlled
    environments, as they are to be modelled to describe larger areas, send information
    through larger distances and be exposed to harsher environments. Even if Figure
    5 shows lack of references in the last couple of years, it is still relevant for
    some applications, e.g. for in-situ real-time soil nutrient sensing is still a
    real challenge, especially regarding calibration (Bünemann et al., 2018, Marín-González
    et al., 2013). 5.2. Device layer challenges 5.2.1. Power consumption The use of
    wireless devices has major advantages over wired systems, as they are more economical
    to establish and can cover much wider areas. However, their power consumption,
    with limited battery life, is a major drawback of many wireless systems, and needs
    to be accounted for. This issue is so important that it is the main identified
    challenge in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5), especially for WSNs (Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tan and Panda, 2010). The large distances to cover in arable farming make
    wireless devices indispensable, and solutions to reduce their power consumption
    and/or extend their battery life are required. These solutions can include energy
    harvesting, low power consumption sensors and communication technologies or power
    efficient management. Energy harvesting techniques can include solar cells, micro
    wind turbines or other interesting solutions which have been well described by
    Tuna and Gungor (2016) and Jawad et al. (2017). The power consumption of the communication
    technologies and sensors employed are also to be considered in the design of the
    IoT solution as there are big differences between devices (Balmos et al., 2016,
    Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). Choosing low power sensors
    and communication devices needs to be taken into account when designing the IoT
    system (Estrada-López et al., 2018). Low power wireless technologies, such as
    BLE, have low power consumption but also low communication range, while Wi-Fi
    has somewhat higher communication range, but much higher power consumption (Table
    1), however data rates and other parameters are important factors to consider
    too. ZigBee and LoRa have been identified as appropriate candidates for many farming
    applications (Jawad et al., 2017). Power efficient management techniques of WSNs
    include sleep/active schemes, e.g. duty-cycling algorithms (Ahmed, Abdalla et
    al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Alahmadi et al., 2017, Balmos et al., 2016,
    Dhall and Agrawal, 2018, Temprilho et al., 2018); data mitigation schemes, e.g.
    data aggregation (Abdel-basset, Shawky, & Eldrandaly, 2018) or data compression
    (Moon et al., 2018); energy-efficient routing schemes, e.g. mobile sinks by the
    use of UAVs (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018,
    Uddin et al., 2018); and other combined solutions, e.g. LEACH, a cluster architecture
    with Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) based MAC protocol and data aggregation
    scheme (Kamarudin, Ahmad, & Ndzi, 2016), or dynamic power management by combining
    sleep/active states with dynamic data rates schemes (Estrada-López et al., 2018).
    Jawad et al. (2017) have provided a good overview and description of WSN power
    efficient management techniques. Lastly, techniques such as edge computing may
    have higher power requirements on the device, making cloud computing more desirable
    if power consumption is a constraint in the projected IoT solution. On the other
    hand, mounting sensors and devices on agricultural vehicles and implements allows
    connection to the power supply of the vehicle and as a consequence eliminate power
    consumption as a limiting factor. The type of sensors that are mounted on vehicles
    and their implements is quite limited, being currently mainly camera-based (e.g.
    Midtiby et al., 2018, Steen et al., 2012). Nevertheless, there is for example
    potential in employing sensors on the coulters of seed-drills for mapping soil
    properties (Nielsen et al., 2017), or other on-the-go sensors for mapping soil
    or crop variations (Peets et al., 2012). 5.2.2. Harsh device environment The natural
    environment in which sensors and other devices are placed can greatly challenge
    their functionality and longevity. Harsh weather conditions, e.g. large temperature
    variations, intense rainfall or prolonged high humidity can cause water condensation
    inside devices and consequently provoke corrosion and short circuits (Bauer &
    Aschenbruck, 2018). Sensors and other devices situated close to the ground experience
    exposure to dust, mud, or even corrosive chemicals, e.g. agro-chemicals, which
    can seriously damage the performance of the device or cause its total failure
    (Aliev, 2018, Bauer and Aschenbruck, 2018). Underground chemical sensors are also
    exposed to soil chemical and biological processes that deteriorate the sensors
    and can mislead the measurements, requiring unfeasible maintenance and re-calibrations
    (Burton et al., 2018, Kassal et al., 2018). Choosing adequate casing that does
    not interfere with the functionality of the device and also tolerates the environment
    they are located in is essential in the design of the IoT system. Sensors are
    also developed for different conditions, and need to match the system''s minimum
    requirements. RFID tags have been reported to perform flawlessly under extreme
    conditions and environments (Costa et al., 2013, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011);
    however, RFID technology is quite limited in its applications in arable farming,
    and suitable sensors and communication devices are therefore primarily dependent
    on the application and design of the IoT system. 5.3. Network layer challenges
    5.3.1. Latency, throughput and rate The large amounts of data generated in IoT
    applications do not only cause problems regarding data storage or handling, but
    also latency problems that reduce the throughput of the network employed. In arable
    farming, latency problems can be of great importance in some IoT solutions, e.g.
    in WSNs where high latency implies higher power consumption of a node (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017), or in dynamic optimised route planning in vehicle logistics, which
    requires rapid responses to deviations in the route plan (Villa-Henriksen et al.,
    2018). For reducing latency problems, fog and edge computing can be employed,
    as these computing techniques decrease latency and network congestion (Elijah
    et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018), e.g. data compression at the edge
    reduces the large volumes of data communicated through the network (Moon et al.,
    2018). In addition, the use of lightweight protocols can also reduce latency problems,
    e.g. LP4S for sensors (Hernández-rojas, Fernández-Caramés, Fraga-Lamas, & Escudero,
    2018), or MQTT messaging protocol, which has a faster throughput than HTTP and
    works well for bandwidth limited networks (Estrada-López et al., 2018). The communication
    rate is important to have in mind when planning the wireless communication technology
    to implement, e.g. 5G can handle high-rates, while SigFox or IEEE 802.15.4-based
    protocols are for low-rates (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton,
    Gotta et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). The throughput of the network affects
    the communication rate, and the communication rate also influences the power consumption,
    which equally has to be carefully considered. Fast response to events is achieved
    by data processing techniques such as data merging (Tanaka, 2018), data compression
    (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018), or dynamic and complex event
    processing rules for conditioning input data and immediately acting accordingly
    (Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018). These processes can be on the cloud or at the edge,
    i.e. devices. Finally, test-bed analysis prior to implementation of the network
    can simulate communication rates and possible latency and throughput issues (Stewart,
    Stewart, & Kennedy, 2017). 5.3.2. Wireless link quality A low wireless link quality
    affects greatly the QoS of an IoT system as it ends in unreliable communication
    between nodes (Klaina, Alejos, Aghzout, & Falcone, 2018). This can be caused by
    multipath propagation (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), background noise (Mazon-Olivo
    et al., 2018), routing problems, e.g. packet collision or limited band width (Jawad
    et al., 2017), or even by harsh environmental conditions, which affect the transceivers
    and the quality of the data transmitted (Elijah et al., 2018). Adequate design
    and testing of the network are crucial for avoiding or reducing this challenge.
    However, techniques such as channel access methods, e.g. TDMA, can improve the
    link quality by reducing packet collisions (Temprilho et al., 2018). Regarding
    testing, the calculation of signal strengths in real-time on the base station
    helps estimating the wireless link quality of a WSN when establishing the system
    (Klaina et al., 2018). Packet loss characterisation can also be used to assess
    the wireless link quality of a connection (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018,
    Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018). Additionally, blind entity identification
    can also help estimating the wireless link quality of a network (Mukherjee, Misra,
    Raghuwanshi, & Mitra, 2018). 5.3.3. Communication range The different wireless
    communication technologies have very diverse ranges, which need to be accounted
    for when designing the IoT solution, together with other factors such as data
    rate, power consumption, communication protocols or costs (Table 1). In arable
    farming, due to the larger farm sizes and because of the employment of mobile
    sensors and devices on vehicles, this challenge becomes even more critical. Furthermore,
    relying on the approximate communication range of a wireless technology can be
    misleading, e.g. WiFi is often described to have 100 m range, but a test analysing
    the packet delivery ratio with respect to distance to gateway shows packet losses
    at ≥ 60 m (Giordano, Seitanidis, Ojo, Adami, & Vignoli, 2018), while in another
    test using WiField devices, 2.6 km range was claimed to be reached still having
    reliable internet connection (Brinkhoff et al., 2017). Testing the communication
    range is therefore important for some settings. In addition to the choice of wireless
    technology, network topology in WSNs, such as mesh topologies can also increase
    the communication range by using nodes to communicate with the central node (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018). Reduced range due to obstacles
    or topography is addressed in the propagation losses challenge later. 5.3.4. Communication
    protocols Differences in communication protocols can cause technical interoperability
    issues, which can lead to connectivity and compatibility issues among the hardware
    and software employed (Stočes et al., 2016). Network protocols are separated into
    diverse layers forming a protocol stack, where tasks are divided into smaller
    steps (Suhonen, Kohvakka, Kaseva, Hämäläinen, & Hännikäinen, 2012). In the infrastructure
    layer, some wireless standards that define communication protocols are commonly
    used by different wireless technologies, e.g. IEEE 802.15.4, which is used by
    ZigBee or 6LowPAN among others, or 3GPP, which is used by GPRS, LTE or 5G among
    others (see Table 1). In the application layer, standards such as HTTP (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Kaloxylos et al., 2014), MQTT (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016, Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018) or XMPP (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018)
    are commonly used in IoT applications in arable farming. Adequate protocols are
    especially relevant and challenging in vehicle-to-vehicle communication, and crucial
    in arable farming. Different standards in different layers require careful planning
    of the whole IoT solution, as they are not always compatible and can also have
    an effect on the data formats used, or sensors and gateways employed (Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018). Middleware platforms can ease the integration of diverse protocols
    and standards by offering enough abstraction levels so that this diversity is
    effectively managed (O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Tuna et al., 2017). Edge computing
    can also ease technical interoperability issues as a local computing layer is
    created to process data and create control rules before sending the data to the
    cloud (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). 5.3.5. Network management Managing a WSN
    can imply battery change, software updates, calibration of sensors, replacement
    of devices and similar maintenance activities that can be very time-consuming.
    Smart mobile devices, e.g. smart phones, can make remote software updating possible,
    and can sometimes even be used for updating some other IoT devices (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016). Using energy efficient devices and communication techniques can
    also be employed to extend the battery life of devices (Jawad et al., 2017). Some
    sensors may require recalibrations with a certain periodicity, which has to be
    accounted for in the projected IoT solution (Kassal et al., 2018). Nonetheless,
    the management of the network is always to be considered when implementing IoT
    solutions in arable farming, where distances and number of devices/nodes can be
    vast. 5.3.6. Network size WSN configuration schemes have a maximum number of sensor
    nodes per gateway that the network can handle, i.e. the network size. According
    to the analysis of the reviewed literature, network size is being identified more
    often in the last two years (see Fig. 5), which seems to indicate new possibilities
    for exploiting the capabilities of WSNs. Network size depends on the wireless
    communication technology employed and can affect other parameters, such as data
    latency or scalability of the network (Balmos et al., 2016). Network topologies
    can also influence the network size and vary from simple star network (e.g. Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018) to more advanced multi-hop mesh networks (Ahmed, Abdalla et al.,
    2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Langendoen et al., 2006) that can increase the network
    size by using network nodes as relays to reach a central node and gateway. Optimisation
    algorithms have been used to find the best spatial distribution of WSN nodes,
    and therefore to assist in the optimisation of its network size (Abdel-basset
    et al., 2018). 5.3.7. Propagation losses Even though propagation losses can become
    a big problem for WSNs in application areas like fruit orchards and tree plantations,
    in arable farming hedges, trees, big rocks or sheds, as well as pronounced topography,
    like hills and valleys, can also block, diffract or scatter the signal reducing
    the communication range and causing data packet losses. Additionally, weather
    conditions can also degrade the wireless connectivity propagation of signals (Jawad
    et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Stewart et al., 2017). To avoid or reduce
    these problems, adequate planning of the location of the sensor nodes, the antenna
    height, the communication protocols and the network topology is necessary. Regarding
    network topologies, mesh networks compared to star networks can reduce propagation
    losses as well as increase communication range (Kamarudin et al., 2016, Ruiz-Garcia
    and Lunadei, 2011). Moreover, propagation modelling can help planning, reduce
    communication tests and ensure Quality of Service (QoS) for heterogeneous wireless
    networks (Jawad et al., 2017, Stewart et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Klaina
    et al., 2018, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011). 5.4. Application layer challenges
    5.4.1. Data analysis Data analysis can in some cases become an important challenge,
    especially when dealing with Big Data, which is data in such amounts, heterogeneity
    and complexity that they need new data management techniques for analysis (Wolfert
    et al., 2017). Agricultural Big Data are worthless unless analysed; however, analysis
    can be very challenging because of the volume, diversity, and quality (e.g. errors
    and duplications). This is especially challenging in arable farming, where larger
    amounts of heterogeneous data are generated at diverse rates and from very different
    sources. The literature reviewed show an increased identification of this challenge
    in the last two years compared with the previous 6 years (see Fig. 5). This evolution
    might be caused by increased access and use of agricultural Big Data in recent
    times (Kamilaris et al., 2017, Pham and Stack, 2018). Techniques for lowering
    data dimensionality can ease the analysis by applying feature reduction models,
    which reduce data size by eliminating unnecessary data dimensions (Sabarina &
    Priya, 2015). Cloud computing provides the flexibility and scalability necessary
    for Big Data analysis, where numerous users operate simultaneously with the large
    and complex datasets (Gill et al., 2017). Likewise, cloud platforms are perfect
    for storing such large amounts of data, where NoSQL databases can store and manage
    these large unstructured datasets (Kamilaris et al., 2017). The analysis of Big
    Data can potentially be used, for example, for policy-making, reducing environmental
    negative impact, improve food-safety, as well as improved farm management and
    production, benefiting the different stakeholders involved (Kamilaris et al.,
    2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). Another facet to data analysis is the growing use
    of machine learning techniques, which are being used for exploring Big Data and
    identifying important factors and their interrelationship that affect agricultural
    production systems like, for example, identifying diverse patterns (e.g. crop
    development stages, weeds or diseases) as part of machine vision systems (Bacco,
    Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018, Reshma and Pillai,
    2018). In these cases, the model is built upon a sample of data, often called
    training data, whose size and quality directly affects the final model. Choosing
    the adequate approach for building the model with the available data is also essential
    for the success of the IoT solution. 5.4.2. Data security and privacy Even though
    data security and privacy do not constitute a high challenge in the literature
    reviewed, they are certainly major concerns for the farmers, i.e. the suppliers
    of data and also end-users of the technology developed, who have little trust
    in service providers'' use of data (Jayashankar et al., 2018, Zhang et al., 2017).
    Also, data ownership needs to be taken into consideration as raw data and processed
    data in IoT systems have different ownership and are accessible by different actors,
    affecting the necessary requirements for data security and privacy (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). Research and development focus has been on sensing, processing,
    controlling and computing, while less effort has been devoted to solving security
    threats, risks and privacy (Tuna et al., 2017). Other issues like cost effectiveness
    in, for example, cloud services are also affecting the security of the data, which
    eventually affects the whole privacy and security of the IoT solution, as low-cost
    services have lower security (Dhinari, Newe, Lewis, & Nizamani, 2017). Technology
    providers should prioritise data security and privacy in their business models.
    The availability of privacy and security technologies that are dynamic enough
    to support the vast numbers and variety of stakeholders, as well as the complexity
    of the network, is still a major challenge that needs to be overcome (Verdouw,
    2016). Many solutions are being employed to reduce data security and privacy issues
    in each of the IoT layers of the system, e.g. encryption algorithms, intrusion
    detection mechanisms, authentication, secure routing protocols, anonymisation,
    etc. (Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Middleware platforms are employed
    to add a security layer between network and applications, which can include confidentiality,
    anonymity and security to the system (Rodriguez et al., 2018, Serrano et al.,
    2015, Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Additionally, newer technologies
    such as blockchain are aiming to solve many of the challenges related to privacy
    and security as well as transparency of the IoT. In agriculture, it is mainly
    being applied in the food supply chain (Bermeo-Almeida et al., 2018). Blockchain
    make sense for IoT platforms where large amounts of confidential data are handled.
    5.4.3. Data quality and availability Some of the challenges previously described
    have a direct influence on data quality, e.g. propagation losses, wireless link
    quality, robustness and fault tolerance. Anomaly detection and similar methods
    have been employed to identify faulty data before analysis (Cadavid et al., 2018,
    Lyle et al., 2014). The poor quality of data or its limited availability can limit
    many applications that involve Big Data analytics, modelling and machine learning,
    which can affect or even compromise the success of some IoT solutions (Balducci
    et al., 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). In these setups,
    and specifically in arable farming, many datasets are integrated from different
    sources and sensors, and the quality or scarcity of some data can become a major
    hurdle to overcome. Ensuring quality and availability of the data before starting
    such a project is required. Even if it is not always possible to gather all the
    data necessary to develop models, perform correct analytics or train machine learning
    algorithms, scientific assumptions (Severino et al., 2018), data augmentation
    (Diedrichs et al., 2018) or simulated data (Wolanin et al., 2019) are used to
    help or solve the encountered challenge. 5.4.4. Context-awareness (metadata) Context-awareness
    is an important and distinctive feature of Smart Farming as compared to Precision
    Farming, because it automatically includes descriptive data from e.g. fields,
    sensors, machines, i.e. metadata. Metadata can include information about the date
    and time, node identification number, data of calibration, height and position
    information, or even descriptive data about an experiment objective, field, machinery,
    crop genotype or soil information at the sensor placement (Jayaraman et al., 2015).
    Metadata about sensor nodes in the system are crucial for providing contextual
    information so that correct data analysis can be performed (Jayaraman et al.,
    2016, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness helps computing techniques to decide what
    data is to be analysed, and consequently easing the computations, and the lack
    of this data complicate data analysis substantially. This is especially relevant
    in arable farming, where the system has to handle both spatial and temporal data
    and make decisions based on the data collected. The use of standards, formats
    and middleware that support metadata is therefore important to have in mind during
    the planning of an IoT solution (Peets et al., 2009, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness
    facilitates new business models and strategies for data analytics and DSS software
    providers. 6. Conclusions and future perspectives A literature review of current
    and foreseeable IoT technologies and systems in arable farming was carried out.
    This has included an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies, an
    outline of the current and potential applications, and a thorough description
    of the challenges and solutions. From this survey, the role smart mobile phones
    play is highlighted, especially Android devices, which are employed in different
    ways for a wide diversity of applications, due to their availability, connectivity,
    interoperability, programmable ease and computational power. The introduction
    of 5G networks in the near future will enhance the capabilities of smart mobile
    devices due to their enhanced performance. The intelligent management of WSN as
    well as the capabilities of improved communication technologies can also solve
    some of the challenges IoT-based solutions are experiencing. The role of middleware
    platforms and generic enablers are expected to gain acceptance and importance,
    as they can solve system integration issues and interoperability challenges. In
    general, regarding challenges, interoperability is a main challenge throughout
    the whole IoT architecture, where development and/or acceptance of standards and
    protocols is required to ease the issues encountered by many IoT implementations.
    Furthermore, challenges such as revenue and affordability of IoT systems, the
    power consumption of wireless devices, latency and throughput problems during
    data transfer, as well as the complexity of data analysis, and data privacy and
    security have been identified in the reviewed literature as of high importance,
    and academic research should direct their resources toward solving or reducing
    these issues. Technology developers need to ensure that the solutions create a
    real benefit for farmers and are available and applicable for both large and small
    producers. How IoT generated farm data will affect the business models of farmers
    requires further investigation as it is not fully addressed in the literature
    reviewed. The combination of intelligent power efficient systems with power harvesting
    technologies should guarantee longer battery-life of wireless devices. Computing
    data at the edge, i.e. on the devices, as well as lightweight protocols can reduce
    network latency and capacity/throughput problems. The emergence of Big Data is
    posing significant challenges for data analysis, as the complexity and heterogeneity
    of the huge data sets require the application of new analysis techniques beyond
    those traditionally used. Techniques such as lowering data dimensionality, cloud
    platforms and cloud computing, including machine learning algorithms, can help
    in this area and new innovative solutions are expected to be developed. Finally,
    technology producers have to guarantee privacy and security of the data handled
    throughout all the layers by employing different secure methods without compromising
    the user-friendliness of the solutions employed. Middleware platforms can help
    improving the privacy and security of IoT solutions, and techniques such as blockchain
    can assist with privacy and security problems of IoT platforms when dealing with
    Big Data. In the near future, interoperable and service-oriented FMIS that are
    integrated in the supply chain with intelligent analytic tools will take over
    some of the management and decision-making tasks of farmers and advisors, which
    will require training for farmers to adapt to this type of FMIS. Key decision
    support functions include farm financial analysis, business processes, or supply
    chain functions, which will gain importance with Big Data analytics. In addition,
    DSS for vehicle logistics will grow in importance as a way to optimise field operations
    using route planning and sensor-based site-specific applications. Finally, the
    introduction of autonomous vehicles and robotics in arable farming in the near
    future is expected to completely change arable farming operations and production
    praxes requiring fully adopted IoT capabilities. Acknowledgements This work was

    \ success in health care, smart city,\nindustrial production and so on. Protected\
    \ agriculture is one of the ﬁelds which has broad application\nprospects of IoT.\
    \ Protected agriculture is a mode of highly eﬃcient development of modern agriculture\n\
    that uses artiﬁcial techniques to change climatic factors such as temperature,\
    \ to create environmental\nconditions suitable for the growth of animals and plants.\
    \ This review aims to gain insight into\nthe state-of-the-art of IoT applications\
    \ in protected agriculture and to identify the system structure\nand key technologies.\
    \ Therefore, we completed a systematic literature review of IoT research\nand\
    \ deployments in protected agriculture over the past 10 years and evaluated the\
    \ contributions\nmade by diﬀerent academicians and organizations. Selected references\
    \ were clustered into three\napplication domains corresponding to plant management,\
    \ animal farming and food/agricultural\nproduct supply traceability. Furthermore,\
    \ we discussed the challenges along with future research\nprospects, to help new\
    \ researchers of this domain understand the current research progress of IoT in\n\
    protected agriculture and to propose more novel and innovative ideas in the future.\n\
    Keywords: Internet of things; protected agriculture; integrated application; state-of-the-art\n\
    1. Introduction\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) was ﬁrst developed in 1999 by the\
    \ network radio frequency\nidentiﬁcation (RFID) system proposed by the Massachusetts\
    \ Institute of Technology (MIT) Auto-ID\nLabs [1]. With the application and development\
    \ of new information technologies, the connotation\nand extension of IoT have\
    \ undergone major changes [2]. IoT can be deﬁned as a huge internet-based\nnetwork\
    \ connecting physical and virtual “things” with standard and interoperable communication\n\
    protocols. To be speciﬁc, everything, such as a sensor and an actuator possessing\
    \ unique identity\nand attribute, exchange messages and communicate with each\
    \ other to realize intelligent positioning,\ntracking, identiﬁcation, perception,\
    \ monitoring and management via kinds of networks anytime and\nanywhere [3]. IoT\
    \ has penetrated pervasively most aspects of human life everywhere such as health\n\
    care, smart home, smart city, industrial control and so on. Agriculture is an\
    \ ideal candidate for the\ndeployment of IoT solutions because it occurs in wide\
    \ areas that need to be continuously monitored\nand controlled [4,5].\nThe concept\
    \ of protected agriculture is relative to open-ﬁeld agriculture. It uses artiﬁcial\
    \ techniques\nto change climatic factors such as natural light, temperature and\
    \ humidity to create environmental\nconditions suitable for the growth of animals\
    \ and plants, enabling them to grow around the clock.\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833;\
    \ doi:10.3390/s19081833\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n\
    2 of 24\nThe environment of protected agriculture is completely or largely artiﬁcially\
    \ controlled andwhich has\nbroken the limits of climate and land conditions for\
    \ the growth of animals and plants to a certain extent.\nSo it is also called\
    \ controllable agriculture. Compared with open-ﬁeld agriculture, protected agriculture\n\
    has more potential to apply IoT technology, because it is less aﬀected by climatic\
    \ and geographical\nfactors. Some mature IoT solutions in other ﬁelds can be transferred\
    \ directly to protected agriculture [6].\nWith the development of agricultural\
    \ sensor, wireless communication, cloud computing,\nmachine learning and Big Data\
    \ technologies, IoT technology has emerged and is gradually being\npromoted and\
    \ applied in the protected agriculture ﬁeld [7–9]. It is playing an important\
    \ role in various\nareas of protected agriculture as it is capable of helping\
    \ farmers monitor soil condition, climate change\nand animal and plant health\
    \ [10]. When the environmental factor change beyond the set threshold,\nIoT will\
    \ automatically send a warning message to the administrator to remove the hidden\
    \ danger.\nIt can also control environmental factors such as temperature, humidity,\
    \ carbon dioxide concentration\nand illumination according to the condition of\
    \ crop growth in real time [11,12]. In addition, cameras in\nthe IoT system are\
    \ able to capture crop diseases and insect pests in the greenhouse in real time,\n\
    helping farmers ﬁnd problems and take targeted preventive measures [13]. Through\
    \ GPS, RFID and\nother location-based sensors, goods such as vegetables can be\
    \ tracked and monitored visually during\ntransportation and storage. Supermarket\
    \ managers use smart phone or PC to monitor and predict\nproduct status and the\
    \ demand for getting product on shelves. At the user or consumer end, people can\n\
    query the variety, origin, processing and other farm product information by means\
    \ of the QR code,\nbarcode, etc. IoT for protected agriculture can help create\
    \ an informed, connected, developed and\nadaptable rural community. Low-cost embedded\
    \ devices can improve the interaction between humans\nand the physical world.\
    \ Cloud computing, edge computing, and Big Data can provide valuable analysis\n\
    and support for decisions. In summary, IoT will become an important tool in the\
    \ next few years to\nengage people in embedded agriculture which includes suppliers,\

    \ [14,15].\nOn the basis of the potential of IoT applications in protected agriculture\
    \ described in the previous\nparagraphs, this paper aims to identify the current\
    \ state of solutions in these ﬁelds. The IoT fundamental\nstructure in protected\
    \ agriculture is introduced in detail based on agricultural sensors, wireless\

    \ The application of IoT\nin protected agriculture and how it makes contributions\
    \ is displayed. Furthermore, the open issues,\nchallenges, future opportunities\
    \ and development trends are discussed.\nIn this article, a comprehensive and\
    \ profound review of IoT in protected agriculture has been\nexecuted based on\
    \ a survey of real-world deployments and published papers over the past 10 years.\n\
    Firstly, a keyword-based search for conference papers and articles was performed\
    \ mainly from the\nscientiﬁc databases IEEE Xplore, Science Direct and ACM Digital\
    \ as well as from Google Scholar.\nFor search keywords, we used the following\
    \ query: “Internet of Things” and either “greenhouse”\nor “livestock” or “aquaculture“\
    \ or “agriculture“. Then, we ﬁltered out papers referring to IoT but\nnot applied\
    \ to the protected agricultural domain. Finally, we checked these papers selected\
    \ from the\nprevious step and picked out the ﬁnal papers according to the problem\
    \ they addressed, the solution\nproposed, impact achieved (if measurable), tools,\
    \ systems and algorithms used.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows.\
    \ Section 2 presents the structure of IoT in protected\nagriculture. The key technologies\
    \ of IoT in protected agriculture are introduced in Section 3. The three\nimportant\
    \ applications in protected agriculture are summed up in Section 4. We further\
    \ discussed\nthe challenges to be faced and the problems that need to be solved\
    \ for IoT in protected agriculture as\nwell as a few future development directions\
    \ in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 outlines the conclusions of\nthis paper.\n\

    2.1. Simple Review of Previous IoT Structure\nAt present, there is no uniﬁed opinion\
    \ on the structure of IoT. The composition of IoT can be\ndivided into three parts:\
    \ object end, cloud end and network end. Smart items, smart devices and\nlocal\
    \ intelligent systems interact directly with the physical world to form the “object\
    \ end” of IoT\n(also known as “front end”). The cloud computing platform that\
    \ provides computing, storage and\nother resources performs fusion processing\
    \ and intelligent analysis of the sensing data from the object\nend and performs\
    \ execution control to constitute the “cloud end” (also referred to as “back end”)\
    \ of\nIoT. The communication infrastructure of the connection object end and the\
    \ cloud end constitutes the\n“network end” of IoT. According to the diﬀerent functions\
    \ implemented by physical entity services\nin the IoT, IoT architecture established\
    \ by the current service-oriented approach can be divided into\nthe following\
    \ two categories: cloud-centric IoT architecture and object-centric IoT architecture.\
    \ In the\ncloud-centric IoT application system, the physical entity service implements\
    \ basic physical information\ncollection, local information processing and transmission\
    \ of information to the cloud, but does not\nprovide a directly accessible service\
    \ interface. Mass storage, relational processing and knowledge\nmining of physical\
    \ information are all implemented in the cloud. One of their typical representatives\n\
    is uID IoT architecture, which is an IoT architecture developed by the uID center\
    \ of the nonproﬁt\nstandardization organization initiated by the university of\
    \ Tokyo, Japan. As shown in Figure 1,\nits architecture consisted of ucode tags\
    \ such as RFID, bar codes, RF and IR beacons, user terminals,\na ucode resolution\
    \ server and application information servers [16]. For software developers, the\
    \ main\nchallenge in building such systems is how to build a back-end cloud service\
    \ platform that supports\nmassive item information management and data processing.\
    \ The cloud platforms that have been\nestablished so far mainly include Xively\
    \ and Aneka [17].\nSensors 2018, 18, x FOR PEER REVIEW  \n3 of 25 \n \n2. The\

    \ \n2.2. Structure of IoT in Protected Agriculture \nBased on the actual situation\
    \ of protected agriculture and the experience of other scholars, we \nproposed\
    \ a five-layer IoT architecture [22]. As shown in Figure 5, these layers are briefly\
    \ described \nbelow: \n(1). Perception layer: This layer consists of various sensors,\
    \ terminal devices, agricultural \nmachinery, wireless sensor network (WSN), RFID\
    \ tags andreaders, etc. The common sensors \nare environmental sensors, animal\
    \ and plant life information sensors and other sensors related \nto agriculture.\
    \ Through these sensors, information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed,\
    \ \nplant diseases, insect pests and animal vital signs can be obtained. The collected\
    \ information is \nsimply processed by the embedded device and uploaded to a higher\
    \ layer through the \nnetwork layer for further processing and analysis. \n(2).\
    \ Network layer: The network layer is the infrastructure of IoT, which includes\
    \ a converged \nnetwork formed by various communication networks and the internet.\
    \ The transmission \nmedium can be wired technology such as CAN bus and RS485\
    \ bus or wireless technology like \nZigbee, Bluetooth, LoRa and NB-IoT. The network\
    \ layer not only transmits various kinds of \nagricultural related information\
    \ collected by the perception layer to the higher layer, but also \nsends the\
    \ control commands of the application layer to the perception layer, so that the\
    \ related \ndevices of the sensing layer take corresponding actions.  \n(3). Middleware\
    \ layer: IoT can provide different types of services for different devices. The\
    \ technical \nspecifications (processor, power supply, communication module) and\
    \ system of each device \nare different and different devices cannot be connected\
    \ and communicated with each other, \nwhich leads to heterogeneity problems. The\
    \ middleware layer aggregates, filters and processes \nreceived data from IoT\
    \ devices, which greatly reduces the processing time and cost of the \nabove issues\
    \ and provides developers with a more versatile tool to build their applications.\
    \ It \nalso simplifies the steps of new service development and new device deployment\
    \ which \nFigure 4. IoT-A IoT framework [21].\n2.2. Structure of IoT in Protected\
    \ Agriculture\nBased on the actual situation of protected agriculture and the\

    \ to the higher layer, but also sends the control\ncommands of the application\
    \ layer to the perception layer, so that the related devices of the\nsensing layer\
    \ take corresponding actions.\n(3).\nMiddleware layer: IoT can provide diﬀerent\
    \ types of services for diﬀerent devices. The technical\nspeciﬁcations (processor,\
    \ power supply, communication module) and system of each device\nare diﬀerent\
    \ and diﬀerent devices cannot be connected and communicated with each other,\n\
    which leads to heterogeneity problems. The middleware layer aggregates, ﬁlters\
    \ and processes\nreceived data from IoT devices, which greatly reduces the processing\
    \ time and cost of the above\nissues and provides developers with a more versatile\

    \ Crucial Technologies of IoT in Protected Agriculture\n3.1. Sensor Technology\n\
    Sensor plays an indispensable role in obtaining environment, plant and animal\
    \ information and it\nis also one of the technical bottlenecks in the development\
    \ of IoT. In recent years, sensor technology\nhas rapidly developed with the emergence\
    \ of new materials and methods [23]. The conventional\nenvironment sensors such\
    \ as temperature, humidity, light intensity, heat and gas sensors have been\n\
    relatively mature and widely deployed in protected agriculture. Nowaday, about\
    \ 6000 research and\nproduction organizations engage in sensor research from more\
    \ than 40 countries, including famous\nmanufacturers such as Honeywell, Foxboro,\
    \ ENDEVCO, Bell & Howell and Solartron companies.\nThere are three main types\
    \ of widely used and researched agricultural sensors: physical property type\n\
    sensors, biosensors and micro electro mechanical system sensors (MEMS). The physical\
    \ property type\nsensor realizes the signal conversion through the physical change\
    \ of the sensitivity of the material\nof the sensor itself, which is mainly temperature,\
    \ humidity and gas sensor. The biosensor [24] uses\nthe organism itself as a sensitive\
    \ component to transmit information according to the reaction of the\norganism\
    \ to the outside world and includes enzyme sensor [25], microbial sensor, adaptive\
    \ sensor [26],\netc., which is mainly used to detect pesticide residue, heavy\
    \ metal ion, antibiotic residue and toxic\ngas [27,28]. The MEMS sensor is the\
    \ embodiment of the new generation of research and development\ntechnology in\
    \ the ﬁeld of sensors with small size, low power consumption, low cost and reliability\
    \ [29].\nAlthough sensor technology has made great strides in both principles\
    \ and manufacturing\nprocesses, there are still some open issues. A typical example\
    \ among those open issue is the research\nand development of soil sensors and\
    \ vital sign information sensors of animal and plant, which is an\nurgent conundrum\
    \ to overcome in long time. The complex composition as well as diﬀerent physical\n\
    and chemical properties of soil turn the rapid and situ measurement of soil nitrogen\
    \ and other elements\ninto an international diﬃculty. Since the life process of\
    \ animals and plants is very complicated, in order\nto realize the accurate detection\
    \ of information about their life, it is necessary to make breakthroughs in\n\
    the physical mechanism and measurement model of the life process. Related research\
    \ has been carried\nout using physicochemical properties, spectroscopy, multispectral,\
    \ hyper-spectral, nuclear magnetic\nresonance as well as other detection methods\
    \ [30–33].\nAnother problem is the promotion and application of these sensors.\
    \ For one thing there is still\na lack of uniform technical standards in the collection,\
    \ transmission and the interface with the platform\nand human-computer interaction\
    \ interface; for another, the cost has limited the large scale application\nof\
    \ fresh sensors in intelligent agriculture. Currently, the cost of sensing equipment\
    \ for the collection and\ntransmission of animal and plant status is prohibitively\
    \ expensive for ordinary peasants. The number\nof nodes in a sensor network can\
    \ often reach tens of thousands. To make the sensor network practical,\nthe cost\
    \ of each node must be controlled within $1, but now the price is as high as $80\
    \ [34].\n3.2. Data Transmission Technology\nIn this section, the details of data\
    \ transmission technology are discussed, which is one of the vital\ntechnologies\
    \ for real-time dynamic acquisition of agricultural information. Diﬀerent from\
    \ industrial\napplication, agricultural information acquisition is not demanding\
    \ in timelines and a slight delay in\nthe transmission process has little eﬀect\
    \ on agricultural production.\nCompared with wired transmission technology such\
    \ as ﬁeldbus, wireless communication\ntechnology has advantages of low construction\
    \ and maintenance cost, low power consumption\nand excellent extensibility. Recently,\
    \ most researchers, organizations and manufacturers choose it\nto build up their\
    \ WSN in environment monitoring [35,36], automatic irrigation [37] and remote\n\
    control [38]. As shown in Table 1, the summary of popular wireless technologies\
    \ and basic parameters\nwas presented. Diﬀerent vendors and research institutes\
    \ have developed their own wireless devices\nbased on these wireless protocols,\
    \ which has somewhat increased the heterogeneity of IoT. In addition,\nwireless\
    \ signals of diﬀerent protocols located in the same band can cause mutual interference\
    \ such as\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n8 of 24\nZigBee, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth [39].\
    \ Wi-Fi has high communication speed but high power consumption,\nwhich is suitable\
    \ for sensor network deployment at ﬁxed points. Although Bluetooth has high security,\n\
    its communication distance is too short and power consumption is high, which is\
    \ suitable for short-time\nclose-range networking. ZigBee has the advantages of\

    \ mW\nIn recent years, the Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) is one of IoT hotspots\
    \ and\nthought as a novel technology with great development potential, which is\
    \ attributed to its huge\nadvantages such as ultra-long distance communication\
    \ and it can be used as an important complement\nof the traditional wireless local\
    \ area network (WLAN) and mobile cellular mobile communication\ntechnologies (such\
    \ as GSM and GPRS). At this stage, LPWAN has many technical standards, which can\n\
    be classiﬁed into two categories. The ﬁrst is a proprietary patented technology\
    \ that works under\nan unlicensed spectrum, such as LoRa, Sigfox and RPMA. The\
    \ second is a cellular communication\ntechnology that works under a licensed spectrum,\
    \ such as EC-GSM, eMTC and NB-IoT. Due to the use\nof dedicated frequency bands\
    \ and uniﬁed deployment by operators, licensed spectrum technology\nhas carrier-class\
    \ security and low interference characteristics, which forms full network coverage\n\
    and operation [40,41]. The unlicensed spectrum uses the common spectrum without\
    \ paying high\nspectrum costs but requires special handling of co-channel interference.\
    \ There are many beneﬁts of IoT\ndeployments based on LPWAN in the agricultural\
    \ environment. Firstly, the maximum connection\ndistance of the LPWAN terminal\
    \ device to the base station varies from several kilometers to several tens\n\
    of kilometers, which saves the trouble of setting up and maintaining routing devices.\
    \ Compared with\nthe 2.4 GHz band, LPWAN adopts the sub-1GHz band to acquire less\
    \ attenuation and multipath\nfading caused by obstacles and dense surfaces like\
    \ concrete walls [42,43]. Moverover, the sensitivity\nof state of the art LPWAN\
    \ receivers reaches as low as –130 dBm due to modulation techniques such\nas narrowband\
    \ and spread spectrum. Secondly, ultra low power operation is another advantage\
    \ of\nLPWAN which is achieved by duty cycling mechanism, lightweight medium access\
    \ control protocols\nand oﬄoading complex tasks [44]. Thirdly, most LPWAN technologies\
    \ support a large number of\ndevice connections by diversity techniques, adaptive\
    \ channel selection and data rate technologies,\netc. [45]. Finally, the LPWAN\
    \ connects a large number of end devices, while keeping the cost of\nhardware\
    \ below ﬁve dollars [46]. LPWAN technologies target a diverse set of applications\
    \ with varying\nrequirements in protected agriculture and therefore it should\
    \ provide some sort of quality of service\n(QoS) over the same underlying LPWAN\
    \ technology. However, current LPWAN technologies provide\nno or limited QoS.\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 1833\n9 of 24\nMeanwhile, mobile cellular communication technology\
    \ has undergone four generations of\ntechnology updates and the ﬁfth-generation\
    \ mobile communication technology (5G) was announced in\n2016, which will make\
    \ large ﬁle transfer such as agricultural images and audio a reality and bring\
    \ new\nimpetus to the agricultural IoT. From the perspective of future research,\
    \ the research of wireless sensor\nnetworks focuses mainly on communication, energy\
    \ conservation, network control and its application\nin agricultural monitoring.\n\
    3.3. WSN\nThe WSN consists of a lot of sensor nodes that are usually powered by\
    \ battery and it is a multi-hop\nself-organizing network system formed by wireless\
    \ communication to collaboratively sense, collect and\nprocess various information\
    \ of the perceived object in the network coverage area [47,48]. It can be\ndivided\
    \ into terrestrial WSN and wireless underground sensor networks (WUSN). The agricultural\n\
    sensors are usually planted into soil and lower frequency wireless technologies\
    \ are more selected\ndue to low attenuation in WUSN. Besides, antenna size and\
    \ energy consumption in WUSN is higher\nthan terrestrial WSN [49]. With development\
    \ of LPWAN, IoT may not need a mesh-style WSN with\npower-based routing, where\
    \ one node forwards packets of other nodes.\n3.4. Cloud Computing\nCloud computing\
    \ grew out of distributed computing, parallel processing and grid computing.\n\
    It is an Internet-based computing system that provides hardware services, infrastructure\
    \ services,\nplatform services, software services and storage services to various\
    \ IoT applications. Its essence is\na system for dynamically deploying and allocating/redistributing\
    \ as well as dynamic monitoring\nof virtualized computing and storage resource\
    \ pools, thereby providing users with computing,\ndata storage and platform services\
    \ that meet QoS requirements [50,51]. It played a strong role in\npromoting the\
    \ development of agricultural IoT. Firstly, cloud computing can provide farmers\
    \ with cheap\ndata storage services for text, image, video and other agricultural\
    \ information, which greatly reduces\nthe storage costs of agricultural enterprises\
    \ [52]. Secondly, it is diﬃcult to make direct use of these raw\ndata for making\
    \ decisions based on the technical level of farmers. Agricultural experts can\
    \ only make\naccurate judgments and give suggestions based on quantitative analysis.\
    \ Only cloud computing can\nsupport intelligent large-scale computing systems\
    \ [53,54]. Thirdly, cloud computing could provide\na secure platform for the development\
    \ of various IoT applications such as crop monitoring [55].\n3.5. Edge Computing\n\
    Edge computing refers to a new computing model that performs calculations at the\
    \ edge of the\nnetwork [56]. In the edge computing, the downlink data of the edge\
    \ represents the cloud service,\nthe uplink data represents IoT service and the\
    \ edge of edge computing refers to any computing\nand network resources between\
    \ the data source and the cloud computing center path. Because the\ncomputing\
    \ task is partially migrated to the network edge device, edge hormone can improve\
    \ data\ntransmission performance, ensure real-time processing and reduce the computational\
    \ load of the cloud\ncomputing center. Moreover, edge computing better protects\
    \ data because processing occurs closer to\nthe source than in cloud computing\
    \ [57,58].\n3.6. Machine Learning\nMachine learning (ML) is a smart way for computers\
    \ to simulate people’s learning activities, acquire\nnew knowledge, continuously\
    \ improve performance and implement their own perfection. In recent\nyears, machine\
    \ learning has achieved great success in algorithm, theory and application [59]\
    \ and have\nbeen combined with other agricultural technologies to maximized crop\
    \ yield while minimizing the input\ncosts [60]. The main machine learning algorithms\
    \ are naïve bayes, discriminant analysis, K-nearest\nneighbor, support vector\
    \ machine (SVM) [61], K-means clusterin, fuzzy clustering, gaussian mixture\n\
    models, artiﬁcial neural network (ANN), deep learning [62], decision tree algorithm\
    \ and so on [63].\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n10 of 24\nML can discover the internal\
    \ connection between messy, modelless and complex agricultural\ndata, make accurate\
    \ predictions and provide a theoretical basis for agricultural decision-making.\n\
    Machinelearning technology is playing an important role in crop breeding, disease\
    \ identiﬁcation,\npest and disease prediction, intelligent irrigation planning\
    \ and agricultural expert systems [64–67].\nFor example, ML technology can analyze\
    \ past farmland data, including the performance of crops under\ndiﬀerent climatic\
    \ conditions and the inheritance of a particular phenotype. As well, ML technology\n\
    can explore the association rules and then build a probability model to predict\
    \ which genes are\nmost likely to participate in the expression of a certain good\
    \ trait of the plant, which can help the\nbreeding expert conduct a reasonable\
    \ breeding experiment [68–70]. Kyosuke et al. came up with\na method for detecting\
    \ the maturity of a single intact tomato-based ML, which consisted of three\n\
    steps: pixel-based segmentation, blob-based segmentation and individual fruit\
    \ detection. In the ﬁrst\ntwo steps, decision trees were generated based on features\
    \ such as color, shape, texture and size and\nimage segmentations were conducted\
    \ using the generated trees. Finally, the automatical detection of\nindividual\
    \ fruit in multiple tomatoes was achieved by X-means clustering method. The results\
    \ of the\ntomato detection image test showed that their method achieved a recall\
    \ of 0.80, while the precision\nwas 0.88 [71]. Rahnemoonfar et al. proposed deep\
    \ learning architecture for counting fruits based\non convolutional neural networks.\
    \ They used synthetic images to train the neural network to save\ntime-consuming\
    \ collect and annotate. The network was trained for three epochs on 24,000 synthetic\n\
    images using an Adam optimizer and 100 randomly chosen images were tested. The\
    \ experimental\nresults demonstrated that their method had higher average accuracy\
    \ as comparing with others [72].\n3.7. Big Data\nThe protected agriculture produces\
    \ billions of dynamic, complex and spatial data including soil\ndatabases, greenhouse\
    \ environment data, livestock vaccination records and government investment\n\
    data. Compared with relational data structures that are logically expressed using\
    \ two-dimensional\ntables, agricultural data is more unstructured and has a large\
    \ number of hypermedia elements\nsuch as expert experience, knowledge and agricultural\
    \ models in the form of text, charts, pictures,\nanimations and voice/video [73].\
    \ The “big” of these data can be reﬂected in four dimensions: volume,\nvelocity,\
    \ variety and veracity [74]. Big Data technology is able to ﬁnd out the internal\
    \ links of collected\ndata through information mining and other means, discover\
    \ new information and provide data support\nfor the next operation. The most commonly\
    \ used techniques to deal with Big Data technology are\nimage processing, modeling\
    \ and simulation, machine learning, statistical analysis and geographical\ninformation\
    \ systems (GIS) [75].\n4. IoT Applications in Protected Agriculture\n4.1. Plant\
    \ Management\nCompared with open-ﬁeld agriculture, protected agriculture provides\
    \ a relatively suitable and\ncontrollable environment for crop growth by greenhouse\
    \ technology, which to some extent is free\nfrom the constraints of the natural\
    \ environment and promoted the intensive and eﬃcient use of\nagricultural resources.\
    \ However, spatial and temporal variability of crops’ growth environmental\nparameters\
    \ in the protected agriculture are strong and aﬀect each other [76,77], which\
    \ made it diﬃcult\nto adapt to the growth of diﬀerent types of plants in diﬀerent\
    \ growth stages by traditional cultivation\nand environmental regulation. Therefore,\
    \ it needs higher accuracy in the aspect of monitoring and\ncontrol. Many works\
    \ have attempted to design and test types of monitoring and control systems to\n\
    adjust greenhouse environmental parameters such as air temperature and humidity,\
    \ light intensity\nand CO2 concentration based on IoT and their results have proven\
    \ it is technically and economically\nfeasible [78]. At the low level of IoT development,\
    \ the environmental data were simply processed and\nusually presented in sheet\
    \ and plot form [79,80]. Later, some studies collected huge amounts of data\n\
    to set up various models based on plant growth or greenhouse climate [81–83],\
    \ which contributed\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n11 of 24\nto predicting the crop\
    \ yield and environment parameter changes to help farmers better manage\ngreenhouse.\
    \ CAI et al. developed a low-cost smart greenhouse remote monitor system based\
    \ on IoT.\nThe system used STM32F103 single chip machine and sensors to collect\
    \ environmental information\nand transferred the data to cloud by LPWAN. Security\
    \ link was established with TLS, which reduced\nsystem costs while ensuring the\
    \ security of data transmission. At the same time, they adopted a time\nseries\
    \ database to store data so that tremendous storage space can be saved [84]. He\
    \ et al. have reported\na greenhouse temperature intelligent control system based\
    \ on NB-IoT. The relative error of greenhouse\nenvironmental information collection\
    \ was below 1%, the average control accuracy was 3.57% (±1.0 ◦C),\nthe transmission\
    \ distance was not limited and the automatic regulation of crop growth temperature\n\
    was realized [85].\nNowaday, with the development of cloud computing, ML, etc.,\
    \ IoT solution can easily achieve\nsmart data processing and analyzing at low\
    \ cost and in a convenient way [86,87]. At the same time,\ngreenhouse technology\
    \ has also undergone several generations of upgrades and has now evolved into\n\
    highly mechanized and automated plant factories. Deng et al. have implemented\
    \ a closed-loop control\nsystem in a salad-cultivating plant factory based on\
    \ the kinetic model. Both digital simulation and\nreal-time results demonstrated\
    \ the system can work stably under the internal variations and external\ndisturbances\
    \ [88]. Zamora-Izquierdo et al. developed a smart farming IoT platform based on\
    \ edge and\ncloud computing, which was designed for soilless culture greenhouses\
    \ at low cost. The platform was\ncomposed of local, edge and cloud parts: the\
    \ local part dealt with data gathering and automatic control\nthough Cyber-Physical\
    \ Systems, the edge part took main management tasks and could improve the\nstability\
    \ of this systems, the cloud part was in charge of data analytics. Compared with\
    \ a regular\nopen control, the platform saved more than 30% water [89]. Katsoulas\
    \ et al. have designed an\nonline irrigation system for hydroponic greenhouse\
    \ crops and their results indicated it increased\nwater and fertilizer use eﬃciency\
    \ by 100% [90]. Liao et al. implemented a IoT-based system in\nan orchid greenhouse\
    \ to monitor the environmental factors and the growth status of phalaenopsis.\n\
    They developed an image processing algorithm to estimate the leaf area of phalaenopsisthe\
    \ and\nidentiﬁed the relationship between growth of plant leaves and environmental\
    \ factors. The proposed\nsystem could provide quantitative information with high\
    \ spatiotemporal resolution for ﬂoral farmers\nand contribute to updating farming\
    \ strategies for phalaenopsis in the future [91].\nDiseases and insect pests bring\
    \ a great threat to the growth of crops as and traditional technology\nand chemical\
    \ prevention and control has a certain lag and negative impact [92,93]. The rise\
    \ of IoT\nhas brought more eﬃcient and smarter solutions to crop disease and pest\
    \ control. Many types of\nIoT sensors can collect information about location,\
    \ greenhouse environment status, crop growth and\npest situation anywhere in real-time,\
    \ which helps farmers keep track of crop pests and diseases.\nThen, all raw image\
    \ and data are sent to cloud centers and later processed and analyzed by various\n\
    models and algorithms based on diﬀerent diseases and pests [94,95]. Finally, these\
    \ cloud centers\ngenerally provide farmers with the following services: disease\
    \ or pest identiﬁcation, disaster prediction\nand warning and recommended governance\
    \ measures from expert systems. Tirelli et al. proposed\na pest insect trap automatic\
    \ monitoring system using ZigBee technology, which can estimate the\ninsect density\
    \ by collected data from diﬀerent sites and send a warning message to farmers\
    \ when it\nexceeded the set value [96]. Ahouandjinou et al. proposed a pest monitoring\
    \ system which detected\nthe presence of pests by the acquisition of ultrasound\
    \ and assisted others in building up protocols\nfor early exterminate of the pests\
    \ [97]. Foughali et al. presented a potato late blight prevention and\ndecision\
    \ support system using cloud IoT and helped the agriculturists take eﬀective action\
    \ to treat\nthis disease [98]. Both Semios and Spensa Company launched their own\
    \ integrated pest management\nsystem, which was able to count the number of pests\
    \ by images, as well as characterize and capture\nthe insects. At present, pest\
    \ and disease warning research mainly provides medium and long-term\nwarning based\
    \ on historical data, which can provide macro guidance for crop production but\
    \ low\ntimeliness. Therefore, future research should focus on online monitoring\
    \ as well as diagnosis and early\nwarning of agricultural diseases.\nSensors 2019,\
    \ 19, 1833\n12 of 24\n4.2. Animal Farming\nLivestock and aquatic product farming\
    \ is an important part of protected agriculture and an area\nwhere IoT applications\
    \ have achieved good results. To achieve good control eﬀects in animal breeding,\n\
    IoT should not only overcome harsh environmental factors, but also pay attention\
    \ to the eﬀects of animal\nbehaviors [99,100]. IoT have been applied in monitoring\
    \ and management of environment, animal,\nfeed and farming process [101,102].\
    \ The livestock monitoring items include information such as body\ntemperature,\
    \ weight, behavior, exercise volume, food intake, disease information and environmental\n\
    factors, which can help people understand animal’s own physiological and nutritional\
    \ status and\nadaptability to external environmental conditions. In aquaculture,\
    \ management projects focus on water\nquality such as dissolved oxygen content,\
    \ water temperature and pH value [103,104] because water\nquality greatly aﬀects\
    \ the growth of aquatic animals. With animal growth and nutrient optimization\n\
    model and intelligent IoT equipment, it is possible to realiaze automatic feeding\
    \ and optimal control of\nfeeding time and intake according to their growth cycle,\
    \ individual quality, feeding cycle and eating\nsituation [105,106]. The Osborne\
    \ Industrial Company has produced TEAM automated electronic sow\nfeeding (ESF)\
    \ stations including pregnancy stations and estrus detection stations. The ESF\
    \ stations\nidentify the sow through the RFID tags worn by each sow and deliver\
    \ the corresponding quantity\nand type of feed based on information such as parity,\
    \ lyrical condition and gestational age. The estrus\ndetection stations can detect\
    \ rutting sows in the sow population and their detection accuracy is 7%\nhigher\
    \ than the manual ones. Encinas et al. presented a distributed monitoring IoT\
    \ system for\nwater quality monitoring. Their model was able to help ﬁsheries\
    \ acquire water quality parameters\nsuch as pH and temperature data in real time\
    \ to optimize pond resources and prevent unwanted\nconditions [107]. Soto-Zarazu´a\
    \ et al. proposed an automated recirculation tilapia farming system\nbased on\
    \ the fuzzy algorithm. The results of this work showed that it saved water by\
    \ 97.42% and\nthe water quality environmental parameters were controlled within\
    \ the acceptable range of tilapia\nculture [108]. Many researches have focused\
    \ on analysis of animal behavior, health care and diagnosis\nand warning of diseases\
    \ based on IoT [109–111]. Yazdanbakhsh et al. proposed an intelligent livestock\n\
    surveillance system. They attempted many machine learning algorithms to process\
    \ raw data of\nhealthy and ill cows and ﬁnally obtained good results used a wavelet-domain\
    \ ensemble classiﬁer with\n80.8% sensitivity and 80% speciﬁcity [112]. Wens Group,\
    \ the largest livestock breeding enterprise\nin China, took the lead in carrying\
    \ out research on the animal husbandry based on IoT and built\nthe corresponding\
    \ system for monitoring livestock vital signs, behavior and breeding environment\n\
    information [113]. Liu et al. collected a variety of penaeus vannamei information\
    \ such as real-time data\non the culture environment, disease image data and expert\
    \ disease diagnosis and treatment and ﬁnally,\nconstructed a remote intelligent\
    \ diagnosis model based on IoT [114]. Liu et al. proposed a web-based\ncombined\
    \ nutritional model for precisely predicting the growth, feed amount and nitrogen\
    \ phosphorus\noutput of gibel carp [115]. The current online diagnostics and early\
    \ warning of animal diseases is at an\nearly stage due to the lack of corresponding\
    \ sensors and models. With upgrading of hardware and\nartiﬁcial intelligence algorithms,\
    \ future research should focus on the improvement of Big Data depth\nalgorithm\
    \ and the establishment of comprehensive models of animal behavior and disease.\n\
    A few studies have made in-depth research in monitoring animal odor and hazardous\
    \ gas\nproduced during the breeding process such as ammonia gas and sulfur dioxide\
    \ [116]. Pan developed\nan electronic nose network system for monitoring and real-time\
    \ analysis of odors from livestock\nfarms. They placed e-noses in and around the\
    \ farm to build up a wireless network to measure odor\ncompounds as well as environmental\
    \ parameters [117].\n4.3. Agri-food Supply Chain Traceability\nNowday, agricultural\
    \ products/food safety issues are receiving worldwide attention and their\nsafety\
    \ traceability is one solution accepted by all parties of Agri-food domains. Governments\
    \ in many\ncountries and regions have promulgated laws and regulations to promote\
    \ the establishment of food\ntraceability system and strengthen the supervision\
    \ of agricultural products/food safety. The Agri-food\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n\

    \ quality at each link of the\nproduction, from the cropland to the consumer (Figure\
    \ 6), which could help consumers establish\nconﬁdence in food safety and contribute\
    \ to sustainable development of the whole food industry [118].\n \n4.3. Agri-food\

    \ supply chain from the grower to consumer. \nIn past years, a lot of countries\
    \ have established the traceability platform for meat,milk, fish and \nagri-food\
    \ products based on IoT [119–121]. However, the fresh food cold chain logistics\
    \ traceability \nhas also drawn widespread attention [122,123]. RFID technology\
    \ still played an important role in \nAgri-food supply chain traceability due\
    \ to its small size and low cost [124]. As a novel technology, \nnear field communication\
    \ (NFC) has been progressively developed and used because of its safe and \nsimple\
    \ operation [125,126]. A common problem in the development of IoT is its asynchronous\
    \ \nheterogeneous data flow and distributed features. This requires the traceability\
    \ system to establish \nuniform and accurate identification naming rules to facilitate\
    \ quick and unique retrieval of \ninformation on a farm product [127]. As the\

    \ Wang et al. proposed a food safety pre-warning system based on association\n\
    rules mining and IoT. It included four modules: information source, warning analysis,\
    \ reaction and\nemergency feedback. First, they accessed food critical information\
    \ through data processing and\nanalysis of food traceability data for safety assessment.\
    \ On this basis of this data, the system used the\nassociated data mining method\
    \ to discover the connection between them and then obtained the food\nsafety risk\
    \ analysis results. Subsequently, the system made a corresponding early warning\
    \ response\nbased on this result [129].\nRecently, the increasing incidents of\
    \ food falsiﬁcation have not only brought about great economic\nlosses, but also\
    \ undermined consumers’ conﬁdence in food safety. The blockchain technology with\n\
    decentralization, non-tamperability, development transparency and machine autonomy\
    \ features\nbrings new solutions to the above problems [130,131]. Tian et al.\
    \ reported a new decentralized\ntraceability system based on IoT and blockchain\
    \ technology, which can provid an open, transparent,\nneutral, safe and reliable\
    \ information platform for producers, governments, consumers and other\nstakeholders\
    \ [132]. Kaijun et al. combined the supply chain and blockchain technology to\
    \ propose\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n14 of 24\na double chain architecture agricultural\
    \ traceability system by studying the dual chain structure and\nits storage mode,\
    \ resource rent-seeking and matching mechanism and consensus algorithm [133].\n\
    Now, with the innovation and maturity of related technologies, it is not diﬃcult\
    \ for researchers to\ndevelop a complete set of traceability systems. The rise\
    \ of artiﬁcial intelligence technology enables\nexisting traceability systems\
    \ to provide automation, intelligence and human services to businesses\nand consumers.\
    \ Chen et al. adopted fuzzy cognitive maps and fuzzy rule method to come up with\n\
    an autonomous tracing system for backward design in food supply chain based on\
    \ IoT, which better\ntraced food product problems [134]. However, there are still\
    \ some problems in food safety traceability.\nIt is worth noting that the current\
    \ agricultural product safety traceability system only focuses on\na certain level\
    \ of supply chain or a certain type of goods. With the participation of multiple\
    \ projects\nor multiple sessions, we believe that the focus of future research\
    \ should be on more complex and\nsystematic supply chains.\n5. Disscussion\n5.1.\
    \ Hardware and Software Challenges\nWhen IoT technology is applying in protected\
    \ agriculture, it is inevitable to encounter challenges\nfrom all aspects. In\
    \ the perception layer, various devices must face the harsh and complex greenhouse\n\
    environment. Strong solar radiation, high temperatures, high humidity, strong\
    \ vibrations and other\nhazards can easily damage or destroy sensors or end devices.\
    \ Moreover, the daily activities of livestock\ncan interfere with the work of\
    \ the sensor or execution nodes, resulting in poor detection and control.\nIn\
    \ a general way, the information collection nodes rely on the battery with limited\
    \ power to maintain\nits work because the behavior of frequent battery replacement\
    \ consume a lot of energies and money.\nTherefore, it is an urgent need to make\
    \ great progress in developing low-power acquisition equipment,\nenergy-saving\
    \ sink node routing protocols and energy-balanced communication algorithms [135].\n\
    The devices places in various places generate incalculable data and the storage\
    \ of such data\nis also a huge challenge for some small servers.\nThose agricultural\
    \ IoT data have real-time,\ndynamic, granular and fragmented characteristics,\
    \ which brings great challenges to intermediate\ndesign, data large-scale screening,\
    \ screening, mining, processing and decision analysis techniques.\nMoreover, existing\
    \ databases cannot store unstructured data such as audio, video and images. As\
    \ a result,\nquite a lot real-time sensing data are not fully exploited. Besides,\
    \ some models and algorithms are not\nenough to to reﬂect objective reality, so\
    \ that they cannot eﬀectively guide agricultural production.\n5.2. Network Challenge\n\
    In protected agriculture, the sensor and device need to continuously operate under\
    \ the harsh\nand varied environment and their arrangement is sparse and irregular.\
    \ Compared with the wired\nnetwork with high wiring costs, the wireless network\
    \ has the advantages of low cost, good networking\nﬂexibility and high scalability\
    \ and therefore becomes the main application mode of the current\nmonitoring system.\
    \ Many actual deployments have displayed that common wireless communication\n\
    technologies are aﬀected by temperature, humidity andbuildings or other spatial\
    \ barriers [136–138].\nThe growth of animals and plants changes also result in\
    \ background noise [139] because of the\nmulti-path propagation eﬀects, which\
    \ lows reliability of data transmission. It is easy to isolate a node in\nthe\
    \ original communication network due to low node deployment density and the above\
    \ obstacles in\nprotected agriculture. If this node is responsible for communication\
    \ routing tasks of many devices and\nthis node is damaged and isolated from the\
    \ network, this will cause partial or even paralysis of most of\nthe network.\
    \ Most relevant theories and research needes on the eﬀects of the crop growth,\
    \ the thickness\nand material of wall, and the radio signal transmission loss\
    \ and electromagnetic wave transmission\nbetween soil and air interface, etc.\
    \ To determine the optimal position, height and network topology\nof sensor nodes\
    \ under diﬀerent environmental conditions. On the other hand, ad hoc intelligent\n\
    wireless network technology is needed to reduce or avoid paralysis of large-area\
    \ networks. The rise of\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n15 of 24\nLPWAN may solve e above\
    \ paralysis problems of WLAN due to its long communication distance,\nwhich obviates\
    \ the need for the dense and expensive deployments of relays and gateways altogether.\n\
    However, the cost of erecting LPWAN base stations is high.\nThe process of recording\
    \ various agricultural products’ status from the ﬁeld to the table\ngenerates\
    \ a large amount of data, which brings great challenges to wireless communication\
    \ with\na low transmission rate. At same times, it also brought network nodes\
    \ many problems in energy\ndistribution, data calculation, storage and communication.\
    \ Therefore, there is an urgent need to\ndevelop high-capacity data and real-time\
    \ broadband communication standards for technologies in\ncomplex agricultural\
    \ application environments.\n5.3. Security Challenge\nThe problems of security\
    \ and privacy are thought as crucial challenges in applications of protected\n\
    agriculture due to real-world examples of losses due to vulnerabilities, network\
    \ attacks or privacy issues.\nAs a multi-network heterogeneous converged network,\
    \ it not only has the same security problems as\nsensor networks, mobile communication\
    \ networks and the Interne, but also has its particular issues\nsuch as privacy\
    \ protection issues, authentication and access control issues for heterogeneous\
    \ networks,\nstorage and management of information issues, etc.\nIn the perception\
    \ layer, security threats are mainly against the WSN and RFID. In agricultural\n\
    applications, many of the sensor nodes are deployed in the long-term unsupervised\
    \ farmland\nenvironment and the wireless network itself is open, so the wireless\
    \ transmission is vulnerable to\nexternal interference and illegal users. Coupled\
    \ with the fact that these devices are respectively\nplaced elsewhere, a single\
    \ security measure is not enough [140]. The main threats to WSN include\neavesdropping\
    \ attack, node capture, replay attack and information wiretapping. So multiple\
    \ security\nmechanisms such as anonymity mechanism, data encryption and identity\
    \ authentication mechanisms\nare necessary [141,142].\nThe security threat of\
    \ RFID refers mainly to the attacks that are encountered when the RFID\nreader\
    \ and the tag communicate and such attacks usually lead to user privacy. In addition,\
    \ because the\nRFID tag is rewritable, the security and validity of the RFID tag\
    \ data will not be guaranteed.\nThere are lots of ways to enhance RFID tag security\
    \ such as modifying tag frequency, enciphered data.\nSensor nodes are diﬀerent\
    \ from RFID tag because they are active and relate to the dynamic properties of\n\
    things. Therefore, when applying encryption algorithms, key distribution policies,\
    \ intrusion detection\nmechanisms and security routing policies in speciﬁc devices,\
    \ we need to consider the limitations of\ntheir own hardware.\nSince networks\
    \ of diﬀerent architectures need to be connected to each other, there are even\n\
    greater challenges in terms of security authentication across network architectures.\
    \ The transport\nlayer will encounter the following security challenges: proxy\
    \ attacks, DoS (Denial-of-Service) attacks,\nmalicious code injection, man-in-the-middle\
    \ attacks, attacks across heterogeneous networks, etc.\nThe common measures dealt\
    \ with these network layer threats and attacks are: authorization,\nauthentication,\
    \ encryption, anti-virus protection, etc. IoT terminal devices in protected agriculture\n\
    have the characteristics of weak computing power and small storage space. Due\
    \ to limited resources,\nIoT encryption technology must be an easy to implement,\
    \ lightweight security technology that is\nsuitable for use in sensitive information\
    \ environments [143,144].\nWhen massive agricultural data is transmitted to the\
    \ application layer, in addition to the intelligent\nprocessing of data, data\
    \ security and privacy should also be considered. At this level, a large amount\n\
    of private data about users is collected, such as the consumption of agricultural\
    \ materials, the purchase\ninformation of fruits and vegetables and the location\
    \ of agricultural machinery. Therefore, the database\naccess control strategy\
    \ should be strengthened on the basis of intelligent data processing. When diﬀerent\n\
    users access the same data, they should limit their permissions and operations\
    \ according to their security\nlevel or identity, eﬀectively ensuring data security\
    \ and privacy. On the other hand, application layer\nservice providers should\
    \ accelerate the development and upgrade of authentication mechanisms\nSensors\
    \ 2019, 19, 1833\n16 of 24\nand encryption mechanisms for application scenarios\
    \ such as agricultural production, processing,\ntransportation and consumption.\n\
    5.4. Other Challenges\nThere are other challenges that need to be addressed, which\
    \ are related to the further application of\nIoT technology in protected agriculture.\
    \ Thousands of devices which have huge diﬀerences in processor,\nmemory, communication\
    \ protocol and programming language are deployed in protected agriculture,\nwhich\
    \ inevitably results in heterogeneity issues. Besides, most of devices in protected\
    \ agriculture are\nconnected to the cloud or others by the non-standard heterogeneous\
    \ interfaces [14,22]. This has led\nto problems of both device heterogeneity and\
    \ data heterogeneity. The device heterogeneity problem\naﬀects the scalability\
    \ of IoT in protected agriculture and the data heterogeneity problem hinders the\n\
    use of fusion information by models [145]. Although many research institutes,\
    \ hardware and software\nmanufacturers and related organizations have made a lot\
    \ of contributions to the standardization and\ndeployment of IoT in agriculture,\
    \ it still needs to establish a complete and clear structure, protocols and\n\
    standards to connect various heterogeneous devices and services [146,147].\nThe\
    \ cost has always been a barrier to the large-scale application of IoT to ordinary\
    \ farmers,\nespecially in developing countries like China and India. Despite a\
    \ large number of embedded devices\nand platforms have emerged and the cost of\
    \ hardware and software is rapidly decreasing, but here is\nanother situation\
    \ in high-quality and high-precision sensors and devices. Moreover, some funds\
    \ are\nneeded to train farmers to become proﬁcient in the use of IoT equipment.\
    \ In order to be able toplay\na better role in the future, the cost of sensing,\
    \ transmission, analysis and application components and\nequipment on the IoT\
    \ need to further reduce in order to lower the price and make it more aﬀordable\n\
    in the next decade [148]. Government departments should recognize the signiﬁcant\
    \ potential for the\ndevelopment of IoT in protected agriculture and increase\
    \ investment and support through policies and\nfunds to attract more capital and\
    \ achieve rapid development and application.\nIn addition, the usability of the\
    \ terminal device needs to be further improved, for example, the user\ninterface\
    \ needs to be friendlier andthe device needs to be more convenient in size and\
    \ easy to carry.\nIoT brings many beneﬁts to ecological environment and brings\
    \ some problems.. More and\nmore equipment is being placed in agriculture andso\
    \ the issues of environmental friendliness should\nreceive some attention in the\
    \ future. As the e-waste generated by IoT devices and the consumption of\nenergy\
    \ are gradually increasing, the sustainable development of the ecological environment\
    \ is also one\ncommon concern. Examples of interesting research topics include\
    \ the use of degradable materials and\nrenewable energy sources, the reduction\
    \ of equipment size and the use of energy-saving algorithms\nand new green ICT\
    \ technology [149,150].\nThe application of the Internet of Things in facility\
    \ agriculture needs to consider the socio-economic\nconsequences. On the one hand,\
    \ it increases the level of intelligence in agricultural monitoring,\ncontrol\
    \ and decision-making, thereby increasing the eﬃciency and quality of agricultural\
    \ production.\nAt the same time, it will also change the demand for the existing\
    \ agricultural workforce, causing some\npeople who are engaged in simple repetitive\
    \ tasks to lose their jobs, which will cause a series of\nsocial problems.\n5.5.\
    \ Future Prospects\nIoT technology is being applied to many ﬁelds of society,\
    \ economy and life at an unprecedented\nspeed, making human society step into\
    \ a new era of high intelligence. IoT technology is evolving\nand mature, and\
    \ many novel deployments and applications are constantly being built in protected\n\
    agriculture. Based on the above analysis and discussion of the key technologies\
    \ and applications of IoT\nin the protection of agriculture, we will present its\
    \ future development prospects and key research and\ndevelopment directions in\
    \ the following aspects. In the perception layer, the development of sensors\n\
    should focus on new sensitive materials, mechanisms, processes and methodologies\
    \ as well as low\npower consumption and low cost. Besides, we must accelerate\
    \ the development of sensors and rapid\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n17 of 24\ndetection\
    \ devices soil, animal and plant life. At the network layer, we should focus on\
    \ high-capacity data\nreal-time broadband communication standards and technologies\
    \ for complex agricultural application\nenvironments, high-reliability, adaptive,\
    \ low-power network deployment and management strategies\nand algorithms. With\
    \ wide coverage, high capacity, low power consumption and low cost, LPWAN is\n\
    ideal for some agricultural scenarios where text-based, video and voice service\
    \ support is not required\nand coverage, power consumption and cost are critical.\
    \ Future research and deployment should\nfocus on IoT solutions based on LPWAN.\
    \ In the application layer, governments and organizations\nshould develop uniﬁed\
    \ standards for the sensors and identiﬁcation interface devices, data transmission\n\
    communication protocols, multi-source data fusion analysis processing and application\
    \ services in\nprotected agriculture through international cooperation or negotiation.\
    \ Software developers should\ndevelop large open source databases and signal processing\
    \ algorithm libraries for diﬀerent areas\nof facility agriculture. For universities\
    \ and research institutes, cloud-based agricultural intelligent\ndecision-making\
    \ models, multi-source data-based information fusion algorithms, agricultural\
    \ Big Data\nmining technologies, distributed intelligent processing systems and\
    \ lightweight IoT authentication,\nencryption and authorization mechanisms will\
    \ be the key research directions for the future. With an\nincreased presence of\
    \ IoT technology in protected agriculture, its potential for the reﬁned management\n\
    of crop, livestock and aquatic animals will be recognized. Besides, as a technical\
    \ means to monitor\nthe production, processing, circulation and consumption of\
    \ agricultural products, IoTwill play an\nincreasingly important role in food\
    \ safety.\n6. Conclusions\nIn this survey, we present a comprehensive review of\
    \ the state-of-the-art in IoT deployment\nfor protected agriculture applications.\
    \ First, a simple review of previous IoT structure was given.\nSecondly, the basic\
    \ IoT architectures in protected agriculture were introduced. Next, discussions\
    \ of\nsensor, data communication, cloud computing, edge computing, ML and other\
    \ vital IoT technologies\nin protected agriculture are elaborated.\nThen, we highlight\
    \ various IoT applications and their\npotential to solve various farming problems\
    \ in protected agriculture. By classifying the research and\ndeployment literature\
    \ on IoT in protected agriculture, three important application ﬁelds were given:\n\
    plant management, animal farming and agri-food supply chain traceability. Finally,\
    \ a detailed analyses\nof IoT research challenges and future prospects were outlined.\n\
    The survey of the existing works directs us concluding remarks. The future prospects\
    \ of IoT in\nprotected agriculture are expectant, but the challenges mentioned\
    \ above must handle. In order to\ncope with its complex and changing agricultural\
    \ environment, the hardware devices must be fully\nupgraded to further enhance\
    \ their universality, reliability, expansibility, endurance and intelligence\n\
    level, while reducing costs and operative diﬃculty. Secondly, the local network\
    \ must be protected from\ninterference from other networks. In addition, the interoperability,\
    \ ﬁltering and semantic annotation of\ndata generated by the various devices of\
    \ IoT must be realized to a certain extent. Only in this way\ncan we optimize\
    \ the Big Data decision support model by using a large amount of heterogeneous\
    \ data.\nSecurity, anonymity and control over the access rights on the information\
    \ is vital for such a system to\nbe adopted. Finally, the impact of IoT on the\
    \ agroecological environment and social economy should\nbe considered in the application\
    \ of protected agriculture, to realize the sustainable development of\nagricultural\
    \ environment as quick as possible.\nAuthor Contributions: The collection, classiﬁcation\

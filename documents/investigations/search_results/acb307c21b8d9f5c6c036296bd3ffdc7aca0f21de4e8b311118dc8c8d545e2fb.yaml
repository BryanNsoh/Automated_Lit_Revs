    • Appropriate water deficit at right time could improve crop yield, quality, and
    water use efficiency (WUE). • Physiological mechanisms of crop responses to water
    deficit provide a foundation for improving field WUE. • Accurate monitoring and
    diagnosis of crop water deficit are necessary to implement efficient water management
    practices. • An irrigation strategy for regulating yield and quality is introduced
    based on the quantitative models. • An integrative approach for water-saving,
    quality-improving, and high-efficient water use has been developed. Abstract Water
    use efficiency (WUE), defined as the ratio of plant carbon gain to water use in
    various spatio-temporal scales, is a complex indicator of physiological, agronomic,
    and engineering processes, as well as management practices. Improving WUE at different
    scales is an important pathway to combat the global water shortage and ensure
    food supply, which requires both understanding the physiological mechanisms of
    crop responding and adapting to water deficit, and innovating field water management
    technologies. We reviewed advances and perspectives in the research field related
    to improving WUE at different scales and discussed the key obstacles and possible
    solutions in practice. A water-saving, quality-improving, high-efficient water
    use strategy was proposed and an integrative management approach making use of
    diverse advanced WUE improving technologies was constructed. Both the water use
    strategy and integrative approach were developed based on physiological mechanisms
    of crop responding to water deficit, crop life water requirements, precision irrigation
    water management according to real-time monitoring of crop responses to water
    deficit, as well as crop water-yield-quality models. The review was expected to
    provide a reference for researchers in the water management communities and boost
    sustainable development of water-saving agriculture in water shortage areas. Previous

    scaleIntegrated strategy 1. Introduction The imbalance between rising food demand
    and insufficient water supply for agriculture is a global issue (Lobell et al.,
    2014). The world population is expected to continuously grow at a fast pace in
    the future 30–50 years (United Nations, 2017). The continuous growth of the world
    population poses a great challenge to global food supply and water security (Lesk
    et al., 2016). FAO has warned in 2018 that global food production has to increase
    by 70% in 2050 to ensure food security while increasing food production requires
    more agricultural water use (Elliott et al., 2014). Therefore, food and water
    security have become an important challenge for humankind (Condon, 2020). Water
    security is the foundation of food security, as water shortage will directly lead
    to fluctuation of food production (Alcamo et al., 2007, Kang et al., 2017). Agriculture
    is the major water consumption sector, accounting for more than 70% of total water
    use worldwide. It is unsustainable to increase food production simply by expanding
    agricultural water use, hence saving water in agriculture becomes a necessary
    part of the solution (Kang, 2019). Developing water-saving agriculture and improving
    water use efficiency (WUE) is necessary for ensuring global water and food security.
    WUE, defined as the ratio of plant carbon gain to water use in various spatio-temporal
    scales, is a complex indicator of physiological, agronomic, engineering processes,
    and management practices (Leakey et al., 2019; Clothier et al., 2020; Fernández
    et al., 2020). Final grain or fruit WUE is coordinated by the three key processes,
    the ratio of transpiration to total water use, transpiration efficiency for carbon
    fixation per unit of water, and the ratio of biomass converted into grain yield
    or harvest index (Condon, 2020). Water use efficiency is also referred to as water
    productivity (WP) in the literature when WUE is expressed as the ratio of biomass,
    yield, or fruit to water supply or total evapotranspiration (Fereres and Soriano,
    2007, Kijne et al., 2003, Molden et al., 2003, Molden et al., 2010, Steduto et
    al., 2009). Crop WUE involves different spatial scales of molecular-cell-organ
    (leaf)-plant-population-field-watershed, and temporal scales of instant-hour-day-month-growth
    season-year (Condon, 2020). WUE at different spatio-temporal scales might not
    be positively related due to different time, canopy, and environmental conditions
    involved (Sadras and Richards, 2014). For example, improvement in WUE at the leaf
    scale does not necessarily mean WUE improvement at a plant or population scale;
    similarly, the largest WUE at an instant or daily scale is not the largest at
    the growth period or year scale (Sadras and Richards, 2014). The so-called decoupling
    or inconsistencies of WUE at different scales is found more pronounced under water
    deficit. Therefore, improving WUE requires the optimum coupling of water and carbon
    processes at various spatio-temporal scales, and multi-factor coordination (Dunn
    et al., 2019, Kang et al., 2017, Papacek et al., 2019, Condon, 2020, Maurel and
    Nacry, 2020). Numerous studies have reviewed the progress and approaches of improving
    WUE in agriculture (Sinclair et al., 1984, Howell, 2001; Kijne et al. 2003; Condon
    et al., 2004; Blum, 2005; Deng et al., 2006). Nonetheless, there is still room
    for improvement in the extent of adopting water-saving agriculture, and in the
    developing countries, where there is a big gap between actual and potential WUE
    at different scales of individual, crop, and field (Hsiao et al., 2007, Kang et
    al., 2017). Changing the irrigation and fertilization ways is possible to improve
    yield by 30% when the other conditions are similar (Mueller et al., 2012). Factors
    contributing to the gap between actual and potential WUE include unmatched or
    not closely matched high-efficient irrigation technologies with agronomic practices,
    lack of scientific and precise control of field water use, and imbalance between
    regional cropping structure and water resources (Howell, 2001, Hsiao et al., 2007,
    Kang et al., 2017). Following the three factors mentioned above, there are three
    aspects needed to be worked on to promote water-saving agriculture and improve
    WUE. First, improving WUE has to be done from a plant or crop perspective, and
    requires studies on exploiting the crop’s physiological water-saving potential
    to reduce water consumption and maintain yield (Condon et al., 2004, Blum, 2005,
    Fereres and Soriano, 2007, Kang, 2019). Although water stress may interrupt crop
    normal growth, the crop itself has evolved to be able to prevent water loss, prioritize
    water supply to important organs, maintain cell water content, and develop surviving
    strategies under water stress (Condon et al., 2004; Nadal and Flexas, 2019). The
    impact of water stress on crops depends on crops’ drought tolerance, as well as
    the intensity and duration of water stress (Blum, 2005). Studying the mechanisms
    of crops maintaining growth under mild to moderate stress, and based on the results,
    designing a strategy that can improve crop survival ability could provide solutions
    for improving yield and WUE (Gupta et al., 2020). It is also important to develop
    new cultivars that were drought-tolerant and use water effectively (Medrano et
    al., 2015). Second, new water-saving, quality-improving, and high-efficient irrigation
    technologies are needed for improving WUE at the field scale (Jovanovic et al.,
    2020). These technologies are applied for the smart control of field water status
    according to precisely monitoring crops life water requirements (CLWR) and crop
    responses to water stress and can also stimulate the compensatory effects after
    a certain level of water stress, control redundant growth, and regulate stomatal
    water-carbon relations through root-shoot signaling (Kang et al., 2017). Other
    techniques that can reduce soil evaporation, increase infiltration, and soil water
    storage, improve light use efficiency and field WUE, such as planting density
    and cropping structure adjustment, fertilization, application of anti-transpirant
    and soil additives, plastic and straw mulches, etc. (Green et al., 2010, Vaz et
    al., 2016, Yang et al., 2018), are also needed (Mueller et al., 2012). Third,
    improving WUE requires exploiting the water-saving potential of irrigation systems
    at a regional scale (Hsiao et al., 2007). For that, regional water resources are
    needed to be properly allocated to match the cropping structure and from that,
    to build a climate-adaptive and water-saving planting system (Green et al., 2010).
    Smart irrigation districts are needed for the precise allocation of water resources
    according to the cropping structure and crop models to reduce water loss and improve
    WUE. The objectives of this review were to propose a high-efficient water use
    strategy and to construct an integrative approach that puts together diverse WUE-improving
    methods (Fig. 1). The water use strategy was developed based on the physiological
    responses of the crop to water deficit, crop life water requirements, precision
    irrigation management according to real-time monitoring crop responses to water
    deficit, and crop water-yield-quality models. The integrated approaches were built
    using the physiological mechanisms of crops responding to water deficit, as well
    as innovative irrigation technologies. We reviewed the advances of associated
    research fields and discussed the main obstacles and possible solutions in adopting
    the strategy in practice, as well as the outlook of future studies in the field.
    Specifically, the topics focused on physiological mechanisms of crop responding
    to water deficit stress and improving water use efficiency, regulating field water
    status precisely and improving water use efficiency based on accurate monitoring
    crop’s responses to water deficit, measurement and estimation of crop life water
    requirements, and quantitative models of water-yield-quality relations. The review
    was anticipated to provide references for researchers in the field and encourage
    the development of water-saving agriculture in arid and water shortage areas.

    2. Physiological mechanisms of crop responses to water deficit Many studies have
    shown that the improvement of WUE under mild or moderate water stress is the result
    of the combined effects of root growth (Sharp et al., 2004, Prince et al., 2017,
    Kang, 2019), root-shoot signaling, and stomata optimum regulation (Kang and Zhang,
    2004, Zait et al., 2019), redundant growth control and compensatory effect after
    water stress (Goodwin and Boland, 2002, Kang and Cai, 2002, Gucci et al., 2019).
    Fig. 2 showed the physiological mechanisms of crop responses to water deficit,
    as well as the processes related to their effects on WUE, adapting from the findings
    of previous studies (Zhang and Davies, 1989, Davies et al., 2002, Sharp, 2002,
    Chaves et al., 2003, Wilkinson, 2004, Wilkinson and Hartung, 2009, Papacek et
    al., 2019). Download : Download high-res image (745KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Diagram for physiological mechanisms of crop responses to water
    deficit and the processes that influence water use efficiency. Some studies reported
    that root development could be maintained under water deficit stress (Sharp, 2002,
    Wilkinson and Hartung, 2009, Kang, 2019, Papacek et al., 2019, Maurel and Nacry,
    2020). The mechanisms underlying root growth maintenance under water stress are
    osmotic adjustment, cell loosening enhancement, and abscisic acid (ABA) accumulation
    (Sharp et al., 2004). Hormone ABA plays an important role in regulating root development
    responding to water deficit and has been proven essential for maintaining root
    growth at low water potential (Sharp, 2002). Crops under water deficit need an
    elevated ABA level, relative to those with sufficient water supply, to prevent
    excess ethylene production (Sharp, 2002). This difference might be related to
    the role played by the accumulated ABA in promoting anti-oxidation systems to
    keep reactive oxygen species (ROS) at a non-destructive level during the water
    deficit (Ober and Sharp, 2003). Primary roots of different species, such as cotton
    and corn were shown to have similar tissue water potential and spatial pattern,
    which indicates the two species had the same osmotic adjustment mechanism (Kang,
    2019). However, comparing the metabolic reaction of corn and cotton at the same
    tissue water potential showed that the two species had distinct metabolic regulation
    mechanisms. The difference in glutathione content between corn and cotton responding
    to water deficit reflects the difference of root exposure to ROS between the two
    species, indicating that in the cotton root system, catalase (CAT) and ascorbate
    peroxidase (APX) had an important anti-oxidation function to prevent ROS production
    and exposure, while corn adopted a more diverse metabolic and enzymatic anti-oxidation
    strategy (Kang, 2019). Studies also showed that high-efficient root metabolism
    could improve crop tolerance to drought (Genard et al., 2014). Water deficit can
    improve root water conductivity and use efficiency by increasing root xylem quantity,
    stimulating lateral root growth, increasing root surface area, and root-shoot
    ratio (Prince et al., 2017). The mechanisms of the direct effects of water stress
    on root growth and development, and tissue hydraulics have been revealed, while
    the signaling mechanisms controlling partial and systematic responses to water
    deficit, as a function of WUE, remain largely unknown (Maurel and Nacry, 2020).
    When soil becomes increasingly drier, more roots would produce signaling chemicals
    with greater intensity, which enables crops to regulate above-ground physiological
    growth and development according to soil water availability (Cramer et al., 2009).
    Studies on the signal’s type, production, and transduction showed that root could
    synthesize and emit many types of signal chemicals when soil is under drought,
    and these signals could be emitted in the form of electrochemical waves or chemicals
    themselves from cells under water stress, and transduced from the place they are
    produced to the place they act on (Davies et al., 2002, Wilkinson and Hartung,
    2009). ABA is produced in roots under drought, transduced to above-ground through
    transpiration, where leaf physiological functions (e.g., leaf expansion rate and
    stomatal conductance) are regulated (Davies et al., 2002, Liang et al., 1997).
    The root can produce ABA quickly after suffering water stress, and its content
    varies several to dozens of times depending on different crops (Davies and Zhang,
    1991). Moreover, the amount of ABA produced by roots is closely related to soil
    water content surrounding those roots, indicating ABA could be one of the indices
    for root zone soil water content (Kang and Zhang, 2004, Dodd et al., 2008). These
    root signals can help reduce water transpiration through stomata when branches
    and leaves have not yet sensed water deficit, which could be the first line of
    defense for crops combating drought. The second line of defense might be the wilting
    of lower and senile leaves with the enduring drought (Schulz et al., 2021). This
    root-shoot signaling theory provided the theoretical background for regulating
    root zone water deficit conditions to improve WUE, and based on that, alternate
    partial rootzone irrigation (APRI) theory and technologies have been developed
    (Kang and Zhang, 2004). Alternative wetting and drying part of the root zone could
    induce roots in dry soil producing ABA signal and leaves ethylene emission (Pérez-Pérez
    et al., 2020), which in turn reduce stomatal openness, leaf growth rate, and ‘luxury’
    transpiration, improve WUE, achieving the goal of saving water without yield reduction
    and higher fruit quality (Kang et al., 1997, Loveys et al., 1997, Kang and Zhang,
    2004; Wang et al., 2012). The most direct response of crops to water deficit is
    to partially close stomata to reduce stomatal conductance and water transpiration
    (Tambussi et al., 2007, Zait et al., 2019). Mild water deficit could enhance photosynthesis
    by impacting mesophyll conductance through osmotic adjustment, leaf structure
    change, and photosynthetic ability (Cano et al., 2014, Buckley et al., 2017, Zait
    et al., 2019). A large ratio of mesophyll to stomatal conductance under water
    stress could reduce transpiration while maintaining or enhancing photosynthesis
    (Tomás et al., 2014). Water deficit could improve photosynthetic ability by increasing
    nitrogen content per unit leaf area while having little impact on stomatal conductance
    (Buckley et al., 2017). Studies showed that proper water stress could improve
    photosynthesis to achieve better water-carbon balance and improve WUE, by enhancing
    carboxylation rate, increasing CO2 saturated maximum photosynthetic rate, and
    reducing vascular bundle sheath cell leaking (von Caemmerer and Furbank, 2016).
    Relative to sufficient water supply, more carbon is transported to root or shoot
    under water stress, which increases water uptake and transport ability per unit
    leaf area and results in a greater capacity to regulate water-carbon exchange
    (Buckley et al., 2017, Ullah et al., 2019). However, severe water stress could
    damage leaf tissue and reduce photosynthesis (Buckley et al., 2017). When the
    root zone is drying, stomatal conductance reduction is faster than photosynthesis
    reduction, and with shrinking stomatal openness, the decline of photosynthesis
    rate is slower than transpiration rate so that WUE is improved (Condon, 2020).
    Although redundant growth is an ecological strategy for crops adapting to the
    changing environment to enhance survival and reduce the risk of extinction, this
    has become the waste and burden in a water deficit cropland (Dodd, 2009). Reasonable
    water supply can regulate root growth to prevent the excessive growth of root,
    stem, leaf, and other components, maintain the optimal growth of each component,
    balance the root-shoot ratio, and improve economic yield and WUE (Chai et al.,
    2015, Costa et al., 2007; Ali et al., 2018; Gucci et al., 2019). Crops can undergo
    certain compensatory growth after water stress was alleviated (Kang et al., 2002a,
    Kang et al., 2000b). A strategic growth stage-based deficit irrigation in maize,
    about 1/2 water amount of full irrigation at the seedling stage and 2/3 water
    amount of full irrigation at the jointing stage, improved significantly WUE while
    maintained yield (Kang et al., 2000b, Du et al., 2015). Water deficit could shorten
    the vegetative growth period, and lengthen the grain filling period so that biomass
    could be accumulated more on kernel after flowering (Zhang et al., 2008). Reducing
    irrigation water by 50% at a certain period of pears did not affect yield significantly
    (Goodwin and Boland, 2002). Because of the discrepancy between fruit trees vegetative
    growth (branches) and fruit growth rate, strictly controlling irrigation frequency
    and amount during the fruit earlier development stage (about 4 weeks after flowering)
    and fruit slow growth period, and enforcing trees undergoing certain water stress
    could adjust the distribution of photosynthetic products among different organs
    and reduce vegetative organs’ redundant growth; re-watering during fruit fast
    growth stage could lead to fruit quick expansion (Costa et al., 2007, Gucci et
    al., 2019). To improve WUE, genotypes or cultivars of efficient water use are
    required by either natural mutation or gene engineering, or both (Condon, 2020).
    Studies were carried out extensively on identifying and exploiting the target
    traits valuable for improving WUE to facilitate breeding drought-tolerance and
    high-efficient water use cultivars (Dunn et al., 2019, Condon, 2020). Traditionally
    genotypes or cultivars were grown under non-irrigated conditions in Mediterranean
    environments and selected based on their adaptation to water deficit conditions
    (Galmés et al., 2011, Patanè et al., 2016, Guida et al., 2017). The selection
    of landraces other than those of drought-tolerant genotypes or cultivars represents
    an interesting genetic source in breeding and/or biotechnological improvements
    for drought tolerance and high WUE (Galmés et al., 2011, Galmés et al., 2013,
    Medrano et al., 2015, Siracusa et al., 2012). 3. Regulating field water status
    precisely and improving water use efficiency based on accurate monitoring of crop
    water status Accurately monitoring crop responses to water deficit is the key
    element for precisely regulating field water status and improving yield and WUE
    (Clothier et al., 2020, Fernández et al., 2020). Many technologies have been developed
    to monitor crop responses to water deficit through new non-contact high-throughput
    phenotyping techniques, instead of measuring soil water content (Watt et al.,
    2020). To improve WUE and exert a designed level of water stress, accurately monitoring
    crop water status and precisely regulating field water status are both required
    so that crop water could be maintained in the proper range and the goals of water-saving,
    good quality, and high-efficiency could be achieved (Kang et al., 1994, Hsiao
    et al., 2007). Table 1 showed the available precise regulation techniques of field
    water status based on accurate monitoring and diagnosis of crop response to water
    deficit, along with the measuring indicators. These techniques can be classified
    into three types. The first type is based on the direct measurement of water deficit
    status. Visible wilting, tissue water content, leaf water potential (via pressure
    chamber, psychrometer, pressure probe, etc.), or xylem cavitation (embolism) were
    measured as indicators of crop water status (Kang et al., 1994; Jones, 2004; Liu
    et al., 2020). The drawbacks of these methods, when used in irrigation scheduling,
    are that they cannot tell how much to irrigate, and sometimes the threshold values
    of some indices to trigger irrigation need to be recalibrated given that the short-time
    fluctuation of the index might be greater than the treatment difference (Jones,
    2004). For example, irrigation water use was reduced by 10% without yield reduction
    when irrigation was triggered by leaf water potential reaching −0.7 MPa, relative
    to those cases with the threshold values at −0.4 and −0.5 MPa, for a manually
    operated variable-rate lateral irrigated cotton field in the south-eastern U.S.
    (Meeks et al., 2020). Therefore, leaf water potential between −0.5 MPa to −0.7 MPa
    could be used as a threshold value to trigger irrigation to achieve a high yield
    and larger WUE for cotton (Meeks et al., 2020). Table 1. The advantages and disadvantages

    diagnosis of crop water status. Types and indicators Advantages Disadvantages

    only RGB information for multispectral, wide wavelength range, a limited number

    information; empirical models lack clear physical basis and need large ground-truth
    data for inversion (Vanegas et al., 2018; Zheng et al., 2020) (4) Satellite remote
    sensing Long time series of data available; easy to obtain and low cost; many
    types of satellites with large datasets to meet demands from different research
    fields; some products on canopy coverage, leaf area index, and land use are ready
    for use (like MODIS) Could not choose shooting time; quality affected by cloud;
    low spatial resolution; long interval; not real-time (French et al., 2020) The
    second type is based on measuring indices indicating crop response to water deficit,
    e.g., leaf stomatal conductance (porometer), leaf or canopy temperature, stem
    or fruit diameter, sap flow, etc. (Ortuño et al., 2008, Liu et al., 2011). The
    maximum daily variation of stem diameter (MDS) is an important parameter of stem
    diameter, indicating the change of crop cell water uptake, water-loss cycle, and
    thermal expansion and contraction (Daudet et al., 2004). Signal strength dividing
    MDS or SF under water deficit by those under sufficient water (SIMDS and SISF),
    was used for water deficit diagnosis (Ortuño et al., 2010). SIMDS was used to
    diagnose the water deficit of apricots (Goldhamer and Fereres, 2004, Puerto et
    al., 2013). Other studies indicated that relative to SISF, SIMDS was more sensitive
    to water change of pears, and irrigation scheduling based on SIMDS was more precise
    (Conejero et al., 2007a, Conejero et al., 2007b). However, opposite results have
    been reported that both SIMDS and SISF were not suitable for water status diagnosis
    for olive trees under water deficit conditions (Fernández et al., 2011; Girón
    et al., 2016). Therefore, this type of method is mostly limited in research studies
    and has not been adopted widely in practice. The third type is based on non-contact
    measuring indices, including handhold or portable crop phenotype measurements
    (handhold chlorophyll fluorometer, handhold hyper-spectrometer, smart handhold
    hyperspectral imager, portable chlorophyll fluorescence imager, etc.) (Hou et
    al., 2019, Matese et al., 2018), greenhouse compact and large conveyor belt imager
    and analysis platform (chlorophyll fluorescence imaging, spectral imaging of RGB,
    hyperspectral imaging, and infrared thermal imaging, etc.), drone and remote sensing
    phenotype analysis platform (drone equipped with RGB imaging, hyperspectral imaging,
    infrared thermal imaging, multispectral imaging, light detection and ranging (LIDAR))
    (Vanegas et al., 2018), and aerial remote sensing (French et al., 2020). These
    methods are non-destructive, take crop environment into account, and sometimes
    are very sensitive. For these methods, the threshold values to trigger irrigation
    need to be calibrated. Also, instruments are expensive, and often need to be operated
    by professionally trained personals. Therefore, this type of method is still in
    the research and development phase and is expected to gain wide application in
    the future. Leaf chlorophyll content can represent well the intensity of water
    deficit and be measured directly with chlorophyll fluorometer (Hou et al., 2019),
    and indirectly through the relations between Normalized Difference Vegetation
    Index (NDVI) and chlorophyll content established using remote sensing data. Chlorophyll
    content was estimated with NDVI obtained by a multispectral camera (Mao et al.,
    2018). However, information included in the NDVI alone is quite limited, and chlorophyll-sensitive
    wavelength differs between different growth periods. Recently, many scientists
    have carried out studies on estimating chlorophyll content with multi-NDVI, and
    also on chlorophyll content of different growth periods through inversion of remote
    sensing data (Xu et al., 2019). Crop water stress index (CWSI), obtained through
    canopy temperature, reflects canopy water status and could be used to guide field
    water management practices (Condon, 2020). A drone equipped with an infrared thermal
    imager provided a new, high-efficient, and reliable method for fast measuring
    large area canopy temperature (Matese et al., 2018). Leaf area index and biomass
    were estimated through statistical models established with a series of NDVIs of
    multispectral and hyperspectral cameras with ground-truth data, or through machine
    learning (Aasen et al., 2015, Li et al., 2018). The LIDAR could actively collect
    plant cloud data to get morphological and structure information (Harkel et al.,
    2019, Li et al., 2020). However, given that crops are often densely planted and
    short, LIDAR alone is not good enough for extract phenotype information, and assimilation
    with other data sources is needed to increase the estimation accuracy (Nora et
    al., 2015). Combing the accurate monitoring of crop responses to water deficit
    with precise control of field water status would play an important role in improving
    WUE. 4. Measurement and estimation of crop life water requirements Crop life water
    requirements (CLWR) is an essential component for implementing high-efficient
    water use and precise water management practices. CLWR is defined as the sum of
    plant transpiration, soil evaporation, and water incorporated into plant’ tissues
    during their lifetime period when the plant has always been disease-free, well-fertilized,
    under optimum soil water conditions, and achieving full production in the large
    area under given climatic condition (Kang et al., 1994, Allen et al., 1998). Since
    the amount of water incorporated into the plant tissues is relatively small, accounting
    for less than 1% of CLWR, CLWR is generally approximated as the sum of the first
    two components, referred to as evapotranspiration (ET) (Allen et al., 1998). Plant
    transpiration is affected by root zone water supply, xylem hydraulic transport,
    leaf stomatal regulation, and atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (Berry et al.,
    2010, Jones, 2014, Tardieu et al., 2015). Soil evaporation, a process in which
    the water phase changes from a liquid to a vapor state on the soil surface and
    diffuses to the atmosphere, is controlled by meteorological factors, crop canopy
    coverage, and soil surface moisture (Shuttleworth, 2007). Physically, water flows
    from the soil into the atmosphere via the plant, commonly known as the soil-plant-atmosphere
    continuum (SPAC). Specifically, water molecules are absorbed into the plant root
    system from the soil, transported through the stem xylem, enters the leaf, and
    then diffuses from the leaf stomata to the atmospheric boundary layer (Kang et
    al., 1994, Monteith, 1995, Caldeira et al., 2014). The SPAC system is an integrated,
    dynamic, interactive, and continuous system. CLWR depends on the climate, crop
    characteristics, management practices, and soil environments (Allen et al., 1998).
    Meteorological variables such as solar radiation, atmospheric temperature, humidity,
    and wind speed exert control on CLWR by affecting evaporation demand. Water requirement
    varies for different crop types, cultivars, and growth periods. When the growing
    conditions are similar, the water requirement is determined by stomata resistance,
    crop height, roughness, reflectivity, canopy coverage, and root conditions (Shuttleworth,
    2007). Management practices and growing conditions affect CLWR by changing the
    local microclimate and crop growth. For example, agronomic practices and irrigation
    methods affected CLWR by altering local microclimate, crop growth, and development,
    or the surface soil and leaves humidity (Jones, 2014). Planting windbreak forests
    in windy and arid areas with high temperatures could reduce CLWR in the encircled
    field by decreasing wind speed (Schymanski and Or, 2016). Different plant densities
    affected CLWR through changing canopy coverage and plant height (Jiang et al.,
    2014). Soil evaporation and evapotranspiration were reduced after using water-saving
    irrigation methods (drip and micro-sprinkler irrigation) due to partial soil surface
    wetting (Wang et al., 2020b), and plastic or straw mulches. Besides, the CLWR
    is influenced by environmental conditions, such as soil textures, organic matter
    contents, and groundwater supply (Kang et al., 2001, Jones, 2014). There are two
    types of classical methods for determining CLWR: direct measurement and indirect
    methods, i.e., model estimation (Table 2). Direct measurement methods include
    soil water balance method, lysimeter, Bowen ratio energy balance, eddy covariance,
    plant physiology methods (sap flow and porometer), inversion based on remote sensing,
    etc. (Shuttleworth, 2007, Zhang et al., 2007, Ding et al., 2010, Jones, 2014,
    Pereira et al., 2020). Model estimation method includes crop coefficient method,
    big-leaf Penman-Monteith, dual-source Shuttleworth–Wallace, multilayer model,
    etc. (Allen et al., 1998, Shuttleworth, 2007, Zhang et al., 2008, Zhang et al.,
    2009, Monteith and Unsworth, 2013, Ding et al., 2015, Zhao et al., 2015, Zhao
    et al., 2018, Jiang et al., 2019, Pereira et al., 2020). Each method has its advantages
    and disadvantages and is suitable for different conditions (Table 2). Among them,
    the lysimeter method and crop coefficient method are the most widely used direct
    measurement and model estimation methods, respectively (Allen et al., 1998, Shuttleworth,
    2007, Pereira et al., 2020). The crop coefficient approach estimates CLWR by multiplying
    crop coefficients for a specific crop under different conditions with the reference
    evapotranspiration (Allen et al., 1998). Table 2. Summary of applicable conditions,
    and advantages and disadvantages of measurement and estimation methods for crop

    (Fishman and Génard, 1998; Ding et al., 2015) Smart water management based on
    CLWR is an important approach for improving WUE. Irrigation scheduling determined
    based on CLWR reduced irrigation water by as much as 42%, compared with conventional
    empirical irrigation scheduling (Davis and Dukes, 2010). Precise ET estimation
    helps to implement effective irrigation management, while effective irrigation
    management, in turn, can save irrigation water, reduce the risks of groundwater
    loss and degradation, save energy, and maintain crop yield. Irrigation scheduling
    based on ET reduced irrigation by 21–34% while maintaining a similar yield in
    a study conducted on lettuce and cauliflower at Salinas Experimental Station,
    CA, U.S. (Johnson et al., 2016). Studies on both woody plants and field crops
    in arid areas of the south-eastern part of Spain have also shown that ET-based
    irrigation scheduling improved WUE significantly (García et al., 2020). Irrigation
    scheduling based on ET was found to control soil water status, prevent water stress,
    save irrigation water use, and improve WUE in an olive orchard in an arid area,
    Argentina (Capraro et al., 2018). Other researchers have tried to use meteorological
    data to directly estimate surface resistance and CLWR (Salvucci and Gentine, 2013,
    Rigden and Salvucci, 2015). Variables related to crop physiological processes
    and characteristics have been included in estimating CLWR, such as canopy radiation
    use efficiency (RUE), WUE, and photosynthetic carbon fixation (Stoy et al., 2019,
    Sinclair and Ghanem, 2020). Although there have been some encouraging results,
    some issues regarding the accurate determination of the CLWRs remain to be addressed:
    (1) to develop methods that can accurately partition between soil evaporation
    and plant transpiration. Plant transpiration is directly related to crop photosynthetic
    production, while soil evaporation is generally considered to be lost and ineffective
    for plant production (Pieruschka et al., 2010). However, the two components are
    difficult to differentiate (Allen et al., 1998, Kool et al., 2014). Therefore,
    studies on the methods that are based on physical and physiological mechanisms
    and able to partition the two components in a more precise way are urgently needed;
    (2) to develop CLWR estimation methods based on crop physiological mechanisms
    and water consumption processes. Current methods are essentially empirical and
    indirect, given that they do not take full account of crop water physiological
    processes (Stoy et al., 2019, Sinclair and Ghanem, 2020). Physiological methods
    that can take advantage of the latest advances in crop physiology and stomatal
    regulation theory are needed; (3) to develop CLWR diagnosis methods and associated
    precision management practices based on real-time monitoring crop water or stomatal
    opening status. Real-time monitoring crop water content or stomatal opening becomes
    feasible with the advances of modern technologies. For example, remote sensing
    technology or ground infrared thermometer can be used to monitor canopy temperature
    or albedo, and then obtain crop moisture and stomatal opening (Jones, 2014, Matese
    et al., 2018, Stoy et al., 2019). However, precise CLWR diagnosis methods, as
    well as precise water management practices based on real-time data, are still
    needed. 5. Quantitative models of crop water-yield-quality and their applications
    Crop water-yield models have been the focus of many studies and gained wide application
    in practice (Allen et al., 1998, Steduto et al., 2009). There are two types of
    crop water-yield models, depending on the length of growth period considered in
    the model (Steduto et al., 2009). The first type of model is to describe the relations
    between crop yield and the total water consumption or relative water consumption
    during the whole growing period, having either linear or parabolic forms. The
    second type of model is to related crop yield to water consumption at different
    growth stages. These models are often used to allocate limited water supply for
    optimum irrigation timing and amount of each irrigation, attempting to maximize
    the crop yield or total production at a given area (Kang and Cai, 2002, Hsiao
    et al., 2007). Although there have been extensive studies on water-yield models
    since the 1960 s, many critical issues remain unsolved (Steduto et al., 2009).
    From the late 1960s, crop models capable of simulating crop growth dynamics have
    been established based on knowledge in crop physiology, ecology, and micrometeorology,
    and have been used to optimize irrigation and fertilization practices through
    scenario analysis (Todorovic et al., 2009, Malik et al., 2019). Most crop models
    do not address crop quality simulation. Also, there are still few studies on crop
    water-quality models (Kang and Cai, 2002, Chen et al., 2014). As consumers pay
    more and more attention to crop quality, high-efficient water use decisions require
    a trade-off between high yield and good quality (Chen et al., 2021). Preliminary
    development of statistical and process-based water-yield-quality models has been
    explored, based on many experiments and numerical studies (Chen et al., 2014,
    Génard et al., 2014). Adapted from crop water-yield models, crop water-quality
    empirical statistical models have been developed to simulate the relationship
    between tomato quality and water deficit in different growth stages (Chen et al.,
    2014). Models based on plant physiological processes that could quantitatively
    describe the formation of crop quality have been developed (Fishman and Génard,
    1998, Génard et al., 2014). For example, the SUGAR model could simulate the changes
    in the sugar composition and content during fruit growth, following the principle
    of fruit carbon balance (Fishman and Génard, 1998). Fruit soluble sugar content
    is the result of a series of physiological and biochemical processes (Génard et
    al., 2014). First, the photosynthetic product (mainly sucrose) is transported
    from the leaves through the phloem and unloaded into the fruit. Then, biochemical
    metabolism is carried out through the action of various enzymes in the fruit cell
    symplast, apoplast, and vacuole. Some of the metabolism products are used to synthesize
    cell wall materials, organic acids, proteins, and temporary storage materials
    (such as starch), while some of them flow out of the fruit in the form of CO2
    through respiration, and the rest of the products remain in fruit as soluble sugars
    (mainly glucose and fructose). Meanwhile, fruit water content has an important
    influence on soluble sugar content through dilution (Génard et al., 2014). Therefore,
    three main underlying processes affect fruit soluble sugar content: assimilation
    supply, a metabolic transformation of sugars, and dilution by fruit water content
    (Prudent et al., 2011). Water stress alters the input of fruit assimilate, the
    transformation of sugar (Kobashi et al., 2000), and fruit water balance (Keller
    et al., 2006), thereby affecting the soluble sugar content (Conde et al., 2007).
    Although many studies have reported that water deficit affects the fruit soluble
    sugar content (Mitchell et al., 1991), there are still different explanations
    for the mechanisms behind it. Some research reported that water deficit influenced
    the sugar metabolism process and increased the total sugar content in fruit (Veit-Köhler
    et al., 1999), while others believed that water deficit only reduced the water
    content in fruit, thus affecting the sugar concentration by dilution/dehydration
    (Chen et al., 2020, Ehret and Ho, 1986). The process-based dynamic model combining
    the effects of plant growth, environment factors, and agronomic management with
    fruit sugar metabolism processes could provide a valuable method to quantitatively
    describe the response of fruit soluble sugar content to external environmental
    and management practices (Génard et al., 2007, Chen et al., 2020). Following the
    sugar metabolisms and feedback loops of tomato fruits, the TOM-SUGAR model was
    developed (Chen et al., 2021), adapted from the SUGAR model (Génard et al., 2007).
    Further, the TOM-SUGAR-WC model was established according to the regulation of
    fruit water content on sugar metabolism, to quantify the effect of fruit water
    content on transformation rates such as soluble sugar into other compounds or
    starch. With the model, the simulation accuracy of tomato sugar content has been
    improved, especially under water deficit conditions (Chen et al., 2020). Also,
    the SUGAR model has been coupled with the fruit growth model to simulate fruit
    growth and quality under different irrigation conditions (Chen et al., 2021).
    One of the drawbacks of the process-based crop water-quality models is that the
    parameters in the model are complicated and difficult to obtain. Further studies
    are needed to incorporate the model into crop water-saving and quality-improving
    high-efficient water use decision-making systems. 6. An integrated strategy of
    improving water use efficiency based on physiological mechanisms of crop response
    to water deficit and innovating irrigation methods Implementing innovative irrigation
    technologies developed based on the understanding of physiological mechanisms
    of crop responding to water deficit could greatly improve WUE (Kang et al., 2000a,
    Kang et al., 2017, Blanco et al., 2019, Gucci et al., 2019, Sarker et al., 2020;
    Ortega-Farisa et al., 2020). Owing to close cooperation between crop physiologists,
    irrigation scientists, and irrigation engineers, a series of new irrigation strategies
    and technologies based on physiological mechanisms of crop responding to water
    deficit has been developed, advancing from conventional irrigation scheduling
    based on soil water balance or ET (Ertek et al., 2006, Hunsaker et al., 2012).
    The newly developed strategies include non-full irrigation (NFI), regulated deficit
    irrigation (RDI), controlled alternate partial rootzone irrigation (APRI), and
    irrigation for coordinated regulating yield and quality (IRYQ), etc. The advantages
    and disadvantages of these irrigation strategies and the applicable conditions
    were summarized in Table 3. These water-saving strategies could be implemented
    by surface, furrow, sprinkler, and micro-irrigation methods, e.g., drip, subsurface
    drip, sprinkler, water gun, etc. (Jovanovic et al., 2020). Table 3. Summary of
    applicable conditions, and advantages and disadvantages of different irrigation

    et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020a; Zhou et al., 2020) 6.1. Non-full irrigation
    Recognizing that crop response and sensitivity to water deficit differ between
    different growth stages, researchers proposed NFI when there is not enough water
    for full irrigation (Trout and DeJonge, 2017). Under NFI, the applied irrigation
    water does not meet CLWR during the whole growing period. NFI is not designed
    to maximize the yield as the full irrigation, rather allow a certain degree of
    yield reduction. NFI is a strategy that optimizes the allocation of limited water
    resources between different crops in a region and between different growth periods
    of a crop (Kang and Cai, 2002). To minimize yield loss and maximize return, the
    limited amount of water under NFI is applied preferentially to the growth stages
    that are the most sensitive to water stress and have the greatest impact on the
    final yield while allowing crops during the other stages to suffer a certain degree
    of water stress. Essentially, NFI is to solve the problem of how to allocate limited
    water optimally into different growth stages, and the principle that NFI relies
    on is the water-yield models mentioned above. NFI has been extensively studied
    and applied in water shortage areas of China, such as in Shaanxi, Shanxi, Gansu,
    Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Xinjiang, Shandong, Henan, and Heilongjiang for
    crops of wheat, maize, cotton, and rice since the 1980s with remarkable water-saving
    achievements (Kang and Cai, 2002, Du et al., 2015, Jia et al., 2018). Future research
    and application of NFI need to be focused on the development of a network-based
    NFI design software or decision support system for a specific crop or an irrigated
    area, which directly serves irrigation managers and farmers. Further, more efforts
    need to be done to provide suitable advanced surface irrigation methods and supporting
    equipment for NFI, and strengthen farmers training on this technology, to better
    promote the application of NFI (Du et al., 2015). 6.2. Regulated deficit irrigation
    RDI was developed based on the knowledge that crops'' physiological and biochemical
    processes may be affected by genes or growth hormones, and the distribution of
    their photosynthetic products in different tissues or organs could be determined
    by water status during each growth period (Fereres and Soriano, 2007). In RDI,
    crops are subjected to a certain level of water stress on purpose during some
    designated growth stages, i.e., crops undergo some sort of water deficit training
    (Kang and Cai, 2002). Through regulating the water status of different growth
    stages, RDI can keep or increase the yield while hindering the vegetative growth
    and total biomass output, which in turn could lead to greater planting density
    and higher yield, less pruning work for crops like cotton and fruit trees, and
    better fruit quality (Goodwin and Boland, 2002, Kang et al., 2017). This technology
    was first proposed and named RDI by the Tatura Centre of the Australian Institute
    of Sustainable Irrigated Agriculture in the mid-1970s. The mechanism for RDI to
    save water and increase yield is to control crop redundant vegetative growth and
    stimulate compensatory effect after applying water stress during some designated
    growth period (Kang and Cai, 2002). Studies on RDI have been carried out extensively
    in the water-limited regions of many countries with arid and semi-arid climate,
    such as Australia, Chile, China, Iran, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, etc., and
    included cereals, fruit trees, grapes and berries, oil crops, and vegetables,
    e.g., maize, wheat, cherry, hazelnut, olives, orange, peaches, pear-jujubes, blueberry,
    grapes, sunflower, carrots, cherry tomato, tomato, etc. (Table 4). Most of the
    studies reported that RDI could achieve the goal of high yield and good quality
    with less water use (Karam et al., 2007, Patanè et al., 2011, Kuscu et al., 2014;
    Blanco et al., 2019; Gucci et al., 2019; Garcia-Tejero et al., 2010; Ortega-Farisa
    et al., 2020). A recent study has shown that RDI slightly reduced the 100-berry
    weight of grapes, while increased fruit soluble solid content, juice pH, sugar
    content and total anthocyanin content, and deceased total acid content before
    fruit ripening (Yang et al., 2020). Transcriptomics and metabolomics analysis
    screened out many differentially expressed genes (DEG) and significantly changed
    metabolites (SCM) in the RDI treatment group. RDI treatment with 30% ET could
    increase the expression level of seven genes related to the anthocyanin biosynthesis
    pathway, as well as the content of some metabolites (Yang et al., 2020). Future
    studies should advance the understanding of how crops would respond to various
    water deficit levels at different growth stages, specifically, how dynamics of
    water loss, photosynthesis, assimilate distribution, and conversion efficiency
    between assimilating and economic yield would change, what is the optimum allocation
    strategy of crop population photosynthate, and what extent the effects of re-watering
    on crop growth and yield are (Chai et al., 2015, Du et al., 2015, Kang et al.,
    2017). For practical application of RDI, optimal time and intensity, i.e., optimal
    irrigation scheduling, should be developed for fruit trees, vegetables, and field
    crops, as well as precision irrigation technologies and agricultural management
    practices for ensuring successful application of RDI. RDI should be integrated
    into water-saving strategy techniques of micro-irrigation to facilitate the precision
    and smart irrigation adopted for farmers (Jovanovic et al., 2020). Table 4. Comparisons

    et al., 2014) 6.3. Alternate partial rootzone irrigation APRI is an innovative
    irrigation technology that combines physiological mechanisms of crops responding
    to water deficit and an advanced approach for controlling water distribution at
    fields (Kang et al., 1997, Kang et al., 1998, Dry and Loveys, 1999). The technology
    was developed based on root-shoot signaling and leaf stomatal water-carbon coordinated
    processes (Kang and Zhang, 2004). The procedure of APRI is that soil in the root
    zone should be separated into parts in the horizontal or vertical direction, and
    they should be kept alternately dry and wet during the growth period, to make
    the roots in different zones undergo a certain degree of water deficit priming
    at different times. Roots in the dry soil would emit abscisic acid (ABA), which
    is a signal responding to water stress and transmitted to the leaves. The leaves
    then adjust stomata openness accordingly so that the luxury transpiration could
    be reduced significantly without having much effect on the accumulation of crop
    photosynthetic products (Kang et al., 1997, Kang et al., 1998, Dry and Loveys,
    1999, Kang and Zhang, 2004). Studies have shown that APRI could stimulate root
    oxalate secretion, regulate the water and nutrient availability in the root-soil
    micro-region, enhance the compensatory uptake of the root system, and increase
    root water and nutrient absorption in the wet root zone (Table 5). Further, APRI
    could reduce soil evaporation and deep percolation loss by reducing the wetting
    area of irrigation (Kang et al., 2000a, Kang and Cai, 2002, Sarker et al., 2020).
    In practical implementation, APRI can be carried out by irrigating part of the
    root-zone soil in either horizontal or vertical directions. APRI has been studied
    in the water-limited regions of many countries with arid and semi-arid climate
    including Brail, Iran, Italy, New Zealand, Turkey, Tunis, U.K., and the U.S.,
    and is suitable for cereals, fiber crops, fruit trees, grapes and berries, legumes,
    oil crops, roots and tubers, and vegetables, e.g., maize, cotton, apples, banana,
    mango, olives, orange, peaches, pears, blueberry, grapes, green beans, soybeans,
    sunflower, potato, tomato, etc. (Table 5). Most of the results indicated that
    APRI could reduce irrigation, significantly increase WUE, and improve fruit quality
    (Table 5). Table 5. Comparisons of yield and water use efficiency (WUE) for alternate
    partial root-zone irrigation (APRI) and full irrigation (FI) on different crops.

    114.6 145.4 70.8 46.37 (Topcu et al., 2007) With less irrigation, APRI does not
    lead to great yield reduction, rather in some cases has a higher yield compared
    with full irrigation (Kang et al., 1998, Green and Clothier, 1999, Chaves et al.,
    2010). For example, APRI reduced the evapotranspiration of pears but increased
    the fruit number and total yield (Kang et al., 2017). Compared to full irrigation,
    grape yield and WUE were significantly increased by 13% and 30% respectively under
    APRI (Du et al., 2013). Dry and Loveys (1999) found that vegetative growth was
    significantly inhibited, but the grape yield and size did not change significantly
    under APRI. However, a few studies reported a small yield decline under APRI (Ghrab
    et al., 2013). Our studies on maize, cotton, tomato, pepper, grapes and other
    crops found that APRI increased total root mass, root-shoot ratio, and stem diameter,
    saved irrigation water by 34.4–36.8% while maintaining a similar yield as full
    irrigation (Table 5). APRI has been widely applied in the Minqin desert oasis
    of Northwest China, where the annual precipitation is about 110 mm (Kang et al.,
    2017). Using APRI, the total irrigation amount was only 2100 m3 ha-1 during the
    whole growing season of maize, while the yield was in the range of 12750–13500 kg hm-2,
    and percentage of saved water was about 40% and water productivity could reach
    as high as 2.93 kg m-3 (1.7 times of conventional border irrigation and 1.3 times
    of conventional furrow irrigation) (Kang and Cai, 2002, Du et al., 2015, Kang
    et al., 2017). APRI extends the RDI strategies from when and how much to irrigate
    to the combination of a spatial wetting pattern of root systems with crops’ high-efficient
    water use mechanisms (Kang and Zhang, 2004). APRI is a new and effective approach
    for saving irrigation water in arid areas (Du et al., 2015, Kang et al., 2017).
    More studies are needed on the optimum alternating cycle, irrigation amount, and
    other related technical parameters of APRI for different crops and growth periods,
    in different hydrological years with varying soil and groundwater conditions.
    Operational guidelines on the practical application of APRI should be provided
    for farmers. 6.4. Irrigation for regulating yield and quality Different from conventional
    full irrigation or non-full irrigation, IRYQ is a new irrigation strategy intended
    to achieve multiple goals of saving water, improving crop quality, and improving
    irrigation efficiency (Fig. 3). IRYQ was developed based on the knowledge of the
    effects of field water status on crops'' physiological growth and fruit quality,
    as well as the relations between crop water, yield, and quality (Wang et al.,
    2011; Zhou et al., 2020). With the improvement of people''s living standards,
    more and more attention has been paid to the quality of agricultural products,
    especially fruits and vegetables. However, it is common in practice to rely on
    a large amount of irrigation and fertilizer to obtain a high yield, which might
    lower crop quality and farmers’ income, and to make things worse, often accompanied
    by great water loss and unsustainable environment (Du et al., 2015, Kang et al.,
    2017). To solve this problem, it is essential to develop and apply an IRYQ strategy
    based on the crop water-yield-quality relationship. Download : Download high-res

    strategies for coordinately regulating yield and quality (IRYQ) with conventional
    irrigation. Due to the diversity of crop quality traits (appearance, flavor, nutritional
    ingredient, storage, transportation, processing, etc.), and the complexity of
    the fruit formation process affecting quality, many factors should be considered
    when considering the influence of water deficit on fruit quality, such as water
    deficit intensity, timing, and irrigation method, etc. (Treeby et al., 2007, Patanè
    and Cosentino, 2010). In terms of water deficit intensity, many studies have shown
    that reducing irrigation by 20% could improve crop quality without a significant
    yield reduction (Treeby et al., 2007). Moderate water deficit could significantly
    improve the fruit soluble solid content, sugar content, organic acid, and other
    flavor quality traits (Treeby et al., 2007, Patanè and Cosentino, 2010), as well
    as the nutritional traits such as lycopene and vitamin C (Patanè and Cosentino,
    2010). In terms of water deficit timing, reducing irrigation amount by 33.3% in
    the mid and late stages of tomato fruit development could significantly improve
    the tomato flavor and nutritional quality (Chen et al., 2013, Chen et al., 2014).
    In the study of pear jujube, water deficit in the fruit development stage could
    improve fruit flavor and nutritional quality, reduce rotten fruit proportion,
    and improve storage and transportation traits (Cui et al., 2008). Four physiological
    mechanisms might contribute to the effects of moderate water deficit leading to
    fruit quality improvement: (1) Water deficit reduces fruit water content, thus
    increases the concentration of carbohydrate and other substances (Zhang et al.,
    2017); (2) Water deficit limits plant vegetative growth, and promotes the distribution
    of assimilates from lateral branches to fruits by regulating the source-sink ratio
    (Patanè et al., 2011); (3) Moderate water deficit increases the accumulation of
    starch at the early stage of fruit development, thus the proportion of starch
    converted into soluble sugar is increased during fruit ripening (Zegbe et al.,
    2004). Besides, vegetative growth restriction increases the light transmittance
    of plants, which is conducive to fruit coloring and response to the synthesis
    and transformation of nutrients (Bénard et al., 2009); (4) Water deficits can
    stimulate the mRNA expression related to sugar metabolism. As a result, the activities
    of sugar metabolism enzymes are enhanced, which promotes the accumulation and
    transformation of sugar (Deluc et al., 2009). On the other hand, the content of
    ABA and ethylene are also increased, which are related to the initiation and promotion
    of fruit ripening (Zaharah et al., 2013). In practice, a trade-off between high
    yield and good quality has to be made in the irrigation decision process. Quantitatively
    modeling the interactive relationship between water-yield-quality of cash crops
    is the key to realize IRYQ (Wang et al., 2011). IRYQ strategy should consider
    the effects of irrigation on both yield and quality, and their combined effects
    on economic returns. IRYQ has also been applied in joint optimization of irrigation
    scheduling and planting patterns for seed maize (Fig. 4). In addition to the high
    yield, producing more seeds with high vigor is also important for seed maize.
    Kernel number and weight that determine the seed maize yield are affected by the
    interactions of irrigation, relative planting time, and the ratio of female to
    male plants. Therefore, the irrigation scheduling should be jointly optimized
    incorporating the planting pattern of female and male plants to have kernels as
    many as possible with the kernel weight within a specific range, to achieve the
    ultimate goals of water-saving, good quality, and high efficiency. To do that,
    a model that can accurately simulate kernel numbers and weight under different
    water conditions has to be constructed (Wang et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2018).
    The Flowering model, proposed by Lizaso et al. (2003), was used to simulate kernel
    number formation by flowering characteristics under sufficient water supply. Adapted
    from the Flowering model, the Water-Flowering model can simulate the kernel number
    formation under different water conditions for seed maize (Wang et al., 2017,
    Wang et al., 2018). Specifically, the model modified the pollination, silking,
    and kernel formation module of the Flowering model by incorporating the effect
    of water stress during the vegetative and flowering stages on the pollen shedding
    and silking, and the effect of seed-set capacity (SC) on the kernel formation.
    Kernel weight of maize is closely related to the source-sink ratio after flowering
    (SSR). However, studies have shown that kernel weight could differ by as much
    as 100 mg per kernel with the same SSR (Tanaka and Maddonni, 2008). To reduce
    the risk of seed germination failure, the upper and lower limit of kernel weight
    (ULKW), a simulation model for the lower limit of kernel weight at different SSR
    levels was developed (Wang et al., 2019). Download : Download high-res image (575KB)

    system of irrigation scheduling and planting patterns to save water and improve
    seed quality and benefit in hybrid maize seed production. The joint optimization
    of irrigation scheduling of IRYQ and planting pattern for seed maize become feasible
    with kernel number and weight model available (Fig. 4). A joint optimization system
    of irrigation scheduling and planting pattern (JOIPP) for seed maize was established
    based on the Water-Flowering model and ULKW model. In the Water-Flowering model,
    the pollen shedding and silking time under sufficient irrigation were transformed
    into functions of the relative planting time of male to female plants, and the
    planting density of male and female plants into the function of plant row spacing
    and the ratio of male to female plants. The optimization objectives were to maximize
    the yield, and the number of kernels with kernel weight within a specific range,
    and minimize irrigation water use. The multi-objectives were transformed into
    a single objective by summing the weighted objectives. Compared with the planting
    pattern adopted by farmers, the optimized planting pattern could increase the
    yield by 10% and WUE by 7.3% (Wang et al., 2020). IRYQ is a step forward from
    conventional irrigation scheduling based on water balance and water-yield models,
    moving toward the development of high-efficient irrigation strategies that are
    based on both CLWR and water-yield-quality interactions (Zhou et al., 2020). Due
    to the complexity of IRYQ, further research and improvements are needed. 7. Conclusions
    and prospect An integrated strategy for improving WUE based on physiological mechanisms
    of crops responding to water deficit and innovative field water regulation technologies
    was presented in the review. This strategy involves understanding of physiological
    mechanisms of crop responding to water deficit and WUE improvement, precise regulation
    of field water based on accurate monitoring and diagnosis of water status, precise
    measurement and estimation of crop life water requirements, construction of water-yield-quality
    models under water stress, and integration of the physiological mechanisms with
    innovative field water regulation. The strategy is expected to save water, improve
    quality, and increase efficiency, and be the approach for achieving modern sustainable
    water-saving agriculture in the future. However, mechanisms of crop drought tolerance
    and WUE are complex, involving many physiological processes, signal transduction
    pathways and network and gene encodings, such as a light reaction and carbon fixation
    in photosynthesis, and plant hormones and their associated pathways, stomata functioning,
    etc. (Schulz et al., 2021). To improve WUE requires the coordinated improvement
    of WUE at different spatio-temporal scales, which asks for close cooperation among
    physiologists, agronomists, soil scientists, irrigation scientists, and engineers
    to promote the development and continuous improvement of the strategy, and to
    put forward an integrated solution. In the future, further studies are needed
    in the following five topics: (1) to identify crops’ drought tolerance genes to
    help screen out and develop new varieties capable of saving water or high-efficient
    water use, and investigate the relations between WUE and various physiological
    processes based on bioinformatics to help understand the key processes controlling
    crop WUE; (2) to examine the relationships and relative importance of WUE with
    soil water, nutrients, gases, heat, and crop planting structure and density, root-shoot
    ratio, and rhizosphere microorganisms to help put forward a multi-factor coordinated
    WUE improvement solution; (3) to develop high-throughput technologies of crop
    responding to water deficit based on space-air-ground infrared thermal imaging,
    fluorescence imaging, multispectral and hyperspectral imaging, and LIDAR to improve
    the accuracy of parameters inversion, and to explore the feasibility of field
    water regulation at multiple scales and regional water resources optimal allocation
    based on crop phenotype data; (4) to construct smart irrigation strategies based
    on more precise water-yield-quality for different types and cultivar, at different
    growth periods, under different soils, climates, hydrological years, and agronomic
    management practices; and (5) to build climate-adaptive, agronomy-smart, water-saving
    crop systems according to the balance between water and land in the region; incorporating
    the uncertainties of climate change scenarios and model parameters to develop
    a plan for improving WUE in the future, and provide integrative solutions for
    sustainable agricultural development in the future water shortage areas. Declaration

    • A LoRaWAN based internet of things (IoT) system was developed for precision
    irrigation. • An irrigation test system was established for fresh-market tomato
    with four treatments. • IoT system performance and soil moisture monitoring were
    discussed. • Water use efficiency and crop production were analyzed for the four
    treatments. Abstract Precision irrigation with sensors has proven to be effective
    for water saving in crop production. An Internet of Things (IoT) system is necessary
    for monitoring real-time data from sensors and automating irrigation systems.
    Long-range wide-area network (LoRaWAN), a type of low-power wide-area network
    (LPWAN), is a low-cost and easily implemented IoT system which can be used for
    precision crop irrigation. In this study, a LoRaWAN based IoT system was developed
    and evaluated as a precision irrigation tool on fresh-market tomato production
    in a plasticulture system. Four irrigation scheduling treatments were designed
    and tested, including irrigation based on crop evapotranspiration (ET), soil matric
    potential sensors (Watermark 200SS-5) at -60 kPa (MP60) or -40 kPa (MP40), and
    GesCoN fertigation decision support system (DSS). The treatments were arranged
    based on a randomized complete block design with four replicates. System feasibility,
    irrigation water use efficiency (iWUE), and crop yield were evaluated. Throughout
    the season, the overall water use efficiencies were 22.2, 26.5, 27.9, and 28.4
    kg·m−3 for ET, MP60, MP40, and GesCoN, respectively. The results indicated that
    treatment MP60 and GesCoN had 15.2 and 22.1% higher marketable fruit yield than
    ET, while, MP40 had 12.5% lower marketable yield compared to ET. Overall, the
    LoRaWAN-based IoT system performed well in terms of power consumption, communication,
    sensor reading, and valve control. These results suggested that the IoT system
    can be implemented for precision and automatic irrigation operations for vegetable
    and other horticultural crops with enhancing crop''s water use efficiency and
    sustainability. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Internet

    use efficiency 1. Introduction In the United States, agriculture is a major consumer
    of ground and surface water, accounting for approximately 80% of the nation''s
    consumptive water use, and this percentage can be higher in the western states
    characterized by a dryer climate [1]. As the global population continues to increase,
    food-crop production is expected to increase dramatically while water resources
    are increasingly limited [2,3]. It is important to use water efficiently for crops
    such as vegetables, characterized by shallow roots and relatively highwater content,
    and thus very sensitive to water stress [4,5]. Water can be in excess or deficit,
    and thus irrigation water management can substantially impact vegetable yield
    and quality [6,7]. Conventionally, farm managers determine when and how much to
    irrigate primarily based on their experiences and time availability, which often
    led to inefficient water usage and reduction in crop yield and quality either
    by over-irrigating or under-irrigating. Precision irrigation is defined as a modern
    irrigation management strategy that allows growers to avoid plant water stress
    at critical growth stages by applying only the necessary amount of water directly
    to the crop, with varying rate and duration as needed based on site-specific conditions
    [8]. By applying precision irrigation on agricultural crops, farmers are expected
    to benefit from lower costs of irrigation water and manpower, while improving
    crop yield and quality. Adoption of precision irrigation for crop production systems
    requires the development of integrated sensing, decision-making strategies, and
    control systems, eventually to precisely control the timing, rate and distribution
    of water as needed [9]. Precision irrigation can be applied based on soil moisture,
    plant stress, and evapotranspiration (ET) [10]. Among these methods, soil moisture
    sensor-based precision irrigation has been widely tested and used in vegetable
    fields and protected culture systems. Soil volumetric water content (VWC) and
    soil matric potential (MP) are two indicators for available water in the soil
    which can be used to implement soil moisture-based irrigation systems [11,12].
    VWC is the ratio of water volume and soil volume with a unit of percentage. MP
    describes the force with which soil matrix holds water [13]. MP measures the required
    energy for water movement in the soil which is always a negative number expressed
    in kPa. Based on our preliminary study, soil MP sensors were selected for this
    study for their higher compatibility with internet of things (IoT) systems and
    higher sensitivity to variations of soil moisture, which is very critical for
    vegetable crops irrigation management [14,15]. A wired or wireless sensor network
    is one of the key technologies for precision and automated irrigation systems
    [16]. IoT is a combination of networked sensors and machines for capturing, transmitting,
    managing, and analyzing data. The data from sensors are first uploaded wirelessly
    to a server. Data are then available on the internet for analysis and computing.
    Finally, the server sends commands wirelessly to the actuators in the field for
    executing tasks. Various wireless technologies in IoT systems have been investigated
    for crop irrigation management, such as Wi-Fi, cellular network (GPRS, LTE), ZigBee,
    and LoRaWAN. Zhao et al. [17] compared the performance of Wi-Fi, ZigBee, GPRS,
    and LoRaWAN for irrigation systems. The results indicated that Wi-Fi and ZigBee
    had low coverage and only worked for the vegetable fields near the gateway. GPRS
    is good for long-distance communication, but it has high-power consumption, and
    high cost of maintenance and deployment. LoRaWAN technology has a maximum range
    of 10 km with low power consumption and cost, which could allow small farms to
    have affordable precision irrigation. This technology was originally published
    in 2015 by LoRa Alliance, a non-profit association supporting the LoRaWAN protocol.
    Goap et al. [18] developed a Wi-Fi based IoT smart irrigation management system
    with a machine learning algorithm to improve irrigation control. Some studies
    have reported the LoRaWAN-based architecture and the potential of implementation
    in smart irrigation [[19], [20], [21]]. A project called SWAMP tested the effect
    of their LoRaWAN IoT-based irrigation system at four pilot locations in Brazil
    and Europe [22]. While LoRaWAN based IoT technology has not been widely tested
    in precision irrigation systems for vegetable crops with soil moisture monitoring,
    valve control, and water usage efficiency analysis. Therefore, the primary goal
    of this study was to develop an effective IoT-based precision irrigation system
    using LoRaWAN technology for vegetable production. The specific objectives were
    to: (1) develop a LoRaWAN technology-based IoT wireless sensing network system
    for precision irrigation for vegetable irrigation, (2) conduct a performance evaluation
    of the irrigation system in terms of data communication, irrigation execution,
    and power consumption, and (3) evaluate the efficacy of the IoT-based precision
    irrigation system at field scale using fresh-market tomato as a test crop, and
    compare it to other irrigation approaches such as evapotranspiration based method
    and a decision support system. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Experimental design
    An open field irrigation management experiment was conducted at the Horticultural
    Research Farm of the Penn State Russell E. Larson Agricultural Research Center
    (Furnace, PA) during the 2020 growing season. The soil type in the experimental
    field was silty clay loam soil with 13.5% of sand, 47.8% of silt, and 38.8% of
    clay. Soil pH was 6.5, and the initial contents of phosphate, potash, magnesium,
    and calcium was equivalent to 175, 298, 584, and 3590 kg ha−1, respectively. Total
    nitrogen and carbon soil contents were 0.13% and 1.13%, respectively. The content
    of ammonium nitrogen was 2.34 mg/kg. Fresh-market tomato (Solanum lycopersicum
    L.) cv. Red Deuce F1 (HM Clause, Davis, CA) was used as the test crop. Seedlings
    were planted at the fourth true-leaf stage on May 21st, 2020, on raised beds mulched
    with black polyethylene film served by a single drip tape per bed. Beds were 0.91
    m wide and spaced at 2.13 m, and plants were planted at an in-row distance of
    0.46 m, establishing a density of 1.03 plants per m2. The 16 mm diameter drip
    tape had emitters spaced at 0.30 m and had a flow rate of 1.0 L per hour per emitter
    at 55 kPa (T-Tape, Rivulis Irrigation Ltd. San Diego, CA). Plants were trellised
    using the stake and Florida weave method [23], and the crop was managed according
    to local practices using an integrated pest management approach. A view of the
    open field experiment is shown in Fig. 1. Download : Download high-res image (396KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. The tomato open field and irrigation
    system setup for the irrigation experiment. Four treatments using different irrigation
    scheduling were designed and tested. Treatment 1 (denoted ET) was based on crop
    evapotranspiration using a dual crop coefficient model according to FAO Paper
    56 [24]. Treatments 2 and 3 were based on soil matric potential (MP) sensors (Watermark
    200SS-5, Irrometer Company, Inc., Riverside, CA) at different thresholds of -60
    kPa (denoted MP60) and -40 kPa (denoted MP40), respectively. Once the average
    sensor readings at 20 cm depth reached the thresholds, the IoT system would send
    a notification and valves were manually controlled through the IoT system interface.
    Treatment 4 (denoted GesCoN) was based on recommendations provided by a decision
    support system (DSS) named GesCoN [25,26] using the web-platform EcoFert (https://www.ecofert.it/)
    and their smart phone application [27,28]. The layout of the experimental field
    is shown in Fig. 2. The overall field (planting area) was 27.74 × 42.67 m. The
    field consisted of twelve raised beds. Three long beds constitute a block, each
    block was divided into four sections, and each section hosted one irrigation strategy
    treatment (T1 to T4). In overall, the field was divided into 16 experimental sections
    of the same size consisting of three 9.14 m beds. A space of 1.52 m served as
    a buffer zone to separate different treatments and replications. Twenty plants
    were placed in each bed, for a total of 60 plants per experimental section. Treatments
    were arranged in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with four replicates.
    Four treatments were randomly distributed in each block. The crop was managed
    according to local standards and following integrated pest management practices.

    and GesCoN treatment, respectively. 2.2. Irrigation system setup Fig. 3 shows
    the structure of the irrigation system, including pipelines, valves, pressure
    sensors, flow meters, and other accessories. The water was supplied from the main
    water line of the farm. The main irrigation line after a screen filter was divided
    into four pipelines, one for each treatment. Four latching DC solenoid valves
    (PGV Series 2.54 cm, Hunter Inc., San Marcos, CA) were installed at the beginning
    of each line, followed by the pressure sensors (G1/4, 5 V, 0–1.2 MPa) installed
    at each line behind the solenoid valves to measure the water pressure. The pressure
    indicated the status of the valves. The pressure regulators (241 kPa) behind the
    pressure sensors limited the water pressure reaching the following components.
    The flow meters measured the cumulative flow volume during the experiment. The
    fertigation system constituted by a by-pass with a Venturi injector was used to
    apply fertilizers when recommended by the GesCoN. When fertigation started, the
    injector was opened first, then the switch in the pipeline was closed. When fertigation
    ended, the switch in the pipeline was opened first, then the injector was closed.
    The pressure gauges were used to measure the real-time water pressure and calibrate
    pressure sensors. The last components were pressure regulators at 103 kPa, which
    was the suggested pressure for the irrigation drip tapes. Drip tapes were placed
    underneath the mulch for each section. Then the drip lines on the same treatment
    were connected to the pipes in the field pathway. Finally, these pathway pipes
    were connected to the corresponding pipelines (2.54 cm) for each treatment. Download

    systems setup As indicated in Fig. 2, soil matric potential (MP) sensors, pressure
    sensors, and valves were connected to six data loggers in the irrigation system.
    Fig. 4 illustrates the installation of soil moisture sensors, solenoid valves,
    pressure sensors, and data loggers in the field. The major components of the data
    loggers included a base control board (Vinduino LLC, Temecula, CA) and a LoRaWAN
    wireless Module (LM513-H, GlobalSat WorldCom Corp., New Taipei City, Taiwan) with
    an antenna. Each data logger was powered by a 3.7 V lithium-ion polymer (LiPo)
    battery, and a solar panel (70 × 70 mm) was connected to charge the battery. Data
    loggers 1 and 6 used 10,000 mAh batteries and data loggers 2, 3, 4, and 5 used
    5,000 mAh batteries. Download : Download high-res image (918KB) Download : Download

    sensors (middle), and datalogger (right) in the field. 2.3.1. Soil MP sensor system
    Fig. 5 shows the connection of the soil MP sensors to the data loggers. In each
    treatment, four soil MP sensors (Watermark 200SS-5, Irrometer Company, Inc., Riverside,
    CA) were used, and these MP sensors were connected to one data logger. These four
    sensors were installed in two experimental sections and at two depths (20 and
    40 cm). During the installation, a soil sampler was used to dig a cylinder hole
    at 40 cm depth. The MP sensors were placed into the hole. The original soil was
    backfilled, and water was added to ensure close contact between sensors and soil.
    The average soil MP of two experimental sections at 20 cm was used for starting
    the irrigation in the treatments MP60 and MP40. The sensors at 40 cm were used
    as a reference to check if the water went down to the depth after each irrigation
    or fertigation event. The sensors installed in treatments ET and GesCoN were used
    only for monitoring the soil moisture levels. Download : Download high-res image

    sensors with the data logger. A data logger has 4 sets of sensor ports (S1–S4)
    and one power ports SP. Each one has two pins, “+” and “-”. The two wires of a
    sensor can be connected to either pin since MP sensor has no polarity. 2.3.2.
    Water pressure sensor system In the pipeline for each treatment, a pressure sensor
    was installed behind the solenoid valve to indicate the valve status (on or off).
    The sensors were calibrated with the pressure gauges installed on the same pipeline.
    By adjusting the opening of the ball valve, eleven pairs of pressure sensor readings
    and pressure gauge readings from 0 to 207 kPa were used to calibrate the pressure
    sensor. Fig. 6 shows the connection of the pressure sensors to the data loggers.

    VCC of pressure sensors was connected to the corresponding “+” pins of S1–S4.
    The pressure sensors output voltage by signal wire was connected to the “-” pins.
    All the sensor GNDs were connected together to the SP-. 2.3.3. Irrigation valve
    control DC latching solenoid valves were used to control irrigation by connecting
    and disconnecting the water supply. Fig. 7 shows the connection of valves and
    the data logger. The Vinduino board originally supported only one valve. To control
    four valves, the sensor ports on the board were used to extend the capability.
    Sensor ports can send high/low signals at 3.3/0 V, but the current was not enough
    for executing the valves. Four 2-way relays were added to connect the valves to
    the main battery. The signals sent to the IN1 and IN2 on each relay could determine
    the status of the collected valve. When IN1/IN2 is high/low, the valve opens.
    When IN1/IN2 is low/high, the valve closes. When IN1/IN2 remains the same or no
    input, the valve does not respond. Download : Download high-res image (213KB)

    and IN2 ports of the 2-way relay to change electric potential at OUT1 and OUT2
    to turn on or off the valve. 2.4. IoT system and data collection An Internet of
    things (IoT) system was established to connect the sensors, valves, and data loggers
    in the field as shown in Fig. 8. A LoRaWAN gateway (Sentrius™ RG191, Laird Technologies,
    Inc., Chesterfield, MO) was placed in an office at 150 m away from the field.
    These data loggers were set up as end nodes in the IoT system, which were pre-configurated
    with basic algorithms for sensor data recording and communication. Some modifications
    were made in the program to fit for our application for sensor data recording
    and valve control. The gateway and end nodes were configured in a free IoT server
    ‘The Things Network’, newly named ‘The Things Stack’ (TTS, The Things Network,
    Amsterdam, Netherlands). The main specifications of the gateway and the end nodes
    are listed in Table 1. An IoT platform named AllThingsTalk (AllThingsTalk NV,
    Mechelen, Belgium) was used to store and display the sensor data and control the
    valves. Download : Download high-res image (359KB) Download : Download full-size

    power +27 dBm +20 dBm To establish the IoT system, the first step was to configure
    the gateway and the end nodes. The LoRaWAN gateway was connected to a computer
    with Wi-Fi for matching the parameters, including using TTS as server and ‘915MHz’
    as band frequency. In the TTS interface, the gateway, application (the whole irrigation
    system), and devices (data loggers) was created. The Application Extended Unique
    Identifier (EUI) and App Key provided by the server were set in the data loggers,
    establishing the connection of the data loggers and the gateway. Once the end
    nodes were powered, they were connected to the TTS after a few seconds. The next
    step was to transmit the data to the AllThingsTalk IoT platform and process the
    data. In TTS interface, AllThingsTalk was integrated to the created application.
    Then AllThingsTalk was linked to TTS. Sensor data were uploaded and stored in
    AllThingsTalk for monitoring and irrigation control. Six ‘Devices’ and several
    ‘Assets’ under ‘Devices’ were added in AllThingsTalk interface corresponding to
    the six data loggers and the sensors or valves in each data logger. The data communication
    frequency was applied with a pre-set time interval, which was 1 min. The time
    for each data transmission duration was 100 ms, which followed the LoRaWAN duty
    cycle regulation of less than 1% of duty cycle. The sensor data (uplink) and valve
    control (downlink) were communicated as binary payload. Each value, such as the
    battery voltage, sensor reading, and valve status was parsed from a byte between
    0 and 255. These were converted to actual values by editing the payload format
    in the ‘Devices’ interface. The valves can be separately controlled to turn on
    or off through AllThingsTalk. The real-time status of the sensors and valves was
    displayed on a pinboard (Fig. 9), which is a customized dashboard in AllThingsTalk.
    The historic data can be displayed, stored, and exported in a comma-separated
    values (CSV) file. The status of the solenoid valves was shown by a circular indicator
    with black color for close and green color for open. The valves were controlled
    to be opened individually or simultaneously. For the two MP-based irrigation treatments,
    the MP sensor readings were compared with the pre-set thresholds, and a notification
    can be sent by email or mobile application when the threshold was reached. However,
    full automation was tested but not applied routinely for the irrigation, instead
    of a manual control through the IoT platform was used to start and end irrigations.
    The major reason was that there was signal loss occasionally on the farm which
    could lead to a delayed response of valves with automatic setting. Download :

    data display and irrigation valve control on the IoT platform (part of the whole
    interface). 2.5. IoT irrigation system performance evaluation The IoT precision
    irrigation system was evaluated throughout the growing season. The IoT system
    function was evaluated, including connectivity and battery usage. The robustness
    of valve control was also tested. Soil moisture from all the sensors was recorded
    and closely monitored. The water usage was recorded after the last harvest by
    reading the flow meter. The crop was harvested five times throughout the growing
    season from August 7, 2020, to September 22, 2020. Harvests were conducted on
    ten representative plants selected in the central row of each experimental unit,
    tomatoes were harvested as single fruits as they turned color, following standard
    harvesting practices [29], and marketable fruit yield was recorded for each treatment.
    Irrigation water use efficiency (iWUE) was calculated by dividing the marketable
    fruit fresh weight by the total water usage for each treatment. Analysis of variance
    (ANOVA) was applied to marketable fruit yield and iWUE for the four treatments.
    Statistical analysis was performed using the MIXED and GLIMMIX procedures in SAS
    9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA., 2016). All means were compared by the
    least significant difference (LSD) test at P ≤ 0.05. 3. Results and discussion
    3.1. Feasibility of the IoT system In general, the IoT system worked properly
    during the entire irrigation period. There were only a few occasions of data loss
    in the IoT system. Six data loggers had an average data loss rate of 5.51%. The
    gateway was placed inside a building without a window directly facing to the field,
    which may have led to some signal loss. This can be improved if the gateway is
    installed outside with less occlusion. The disconnection of any component such
    as the gateway, the server The Things Network, and the IoT platform AllThingsTalk
    contributed to signal loss. However, the sensing system was not affected significantly
    since data were uploaded at the high frequency of every minute without long period
    of data loss. During the experiment, a few instances of data losses lasted more
    than 10 min were observed. If the irrigation was applied during these periods,
    it is possible that the valves would not respond on time. The batteries in the
    six data loggers were charged by solar panels and maintained sufficient power
    throughout the three-month experiment period. Fig. 8 shows the voltage of these
    batteries over time. There were a few occasions of voltage drop for all data loggers
    due to continuing cloudy and rainy weather. Solar panel wires were inadvertently
    disconnected for data logger 3 between 60 and 70 days after transplanting (DAT),
    resulting in an obvious voltage drop. Overall, the battery voltages were above
    4.0 V throughout the experiment, which showed that the 5,000 mAh LiPo battery
    with a solar panel could support a data logger working continuously in the open
    field (Fig. 10). Download : Download high-res image (482KB) Download : Download

    experiment. 3.2. Valve control During the experiment, irrigation was applied successfully
    by controlling the status of the solenoid valves with the implemented IoT system.
    When the soil moisture threshold was reached, the platform sent a notification
    through the mobile application and an email to the end-user. The operator then
    turned the corresponding valves on, and the irrigation started. When the valves
    were opened, the status of the valves showed ‘Green’ on the IoT interface, and
    the pressure of the water line indicated a positive reading. When the valves were
    closed after the given time of each irrigation event, the valve status showed
    ‘Black’, and the reading of the pressure sensors returned to zero. It was also
    observed that the valve status changed to ‘Green’ while the pressure sensor reading
    did not change accordingly. In this situation, the valve did not actually open
    with pressurized flowing water. In other words, the solenoid did not respond even
    if the signal was received by the controller. By sending the signal several times,
    the valve did finally open or close. This can be attributed to a clogging in the
    solenoid or a small voltage used for powering the valves (4.0 V). In the future,
    a higher voltage (9.0 V) will be used to improve the robustness of the valve.
    A remote control with manual operation was used in the experiment, while for a
    fully automatic irrigation system, the start and end of an irrigation cycle need
    to be programmed into the controller according to the soil moisture thresholds.
    3.3. Soil moisture monitoring with the IoT system Generally, the sensor readings
    represented the changes in the soil moisture level in the test field. When irrigation
    or relevant rainfall events occurred, the sensor readings responded accordingly,
    showing increased soil moisture levels. For example, Fig. 11 illustrates the daily
    average soil MP60 sensor readings, rainfall, and irrigation of four treatments
    between 35 and 125 DAT. When the average sensor reading at 20 cm reached -60 kPa,
    irrigation started. Thus, the daily average readings of sensors at 20 cm were
    usually above -60 kPa during the experiment. The sensor readings at 40 cm indicated
    that water reached that depth during the irrigation events, but the soil was not
    too wet, which proved that the irrigation was sufficient but not in excess. For
    this treatment, we observed one sensor failure at the beginning of the experiment,
    which is shown by the MP reading that reached large negative values during 45–55
    DAT in one of the 20 cm locations. After replacing the malfunctioning sensor,
    the normal soil matric potential data resumed. Download : Download high-res image

    readings, rainfall, and irrigation of treatment MP60 during the experiment. Fig.
    12 shows the sensor readings around an irrigation event of treatment MP60 at 77
    DAT. The irrigation was applied based on the average readings of two sensors at
    20 cm depth. When the average readings reached -60 kPa at 18:50, the notification
    was sent, and the valve was opened remotely. The increased water pressure readings
    showed that the water was on. The MP sensor readings increased after 30 min and
    stopped increasing after about 2 h. Sensors at 40 cm and at the first installation
    position responded first. Commonly, water reached 20 cm first, then 40 cm. But
    the sensors were not close to the drip tapes, and the irrigation water spread
    in both the vertical and horizontal direction to reach the sensors. For this reason,
    sometimes the irrigation water reached the 40 cm sensors first. At 22:20, the
    irrigation ended, and the water pressure readings went back to 0. Before the irrigation,
    the sensors readings at 20 cm were near -60 kPa, and the sensor readings at 40
    cm were at -100 and -140 kPa. During the irrigation, all the sensor readings gradually
    reached the soil matric potential values above -20 kPa, while sensors at 40 cm
    were still dryer than sensors at 20 cm. There was a slight variation for the MP
    2–1 40 cm sensor after irrigation, which may be due to the accuracy of the sensor
    itself. Sensors at 40 cm depth usually would become dryer faster than sensors
    placed at 20 cm depth. Download : Download high-res image (371KB) Download : Download

    and crop yield performance Table 2 shows the total water usage per unit area,
    the fruit marketable yield, and iWUE of the four treatments. Treatment MP40 used
    30.6% less irrigation water compared to the ET treatment, while there was no significant
    difference in marketable fruit yield between MP40 and ET. However, MP40 marketable
    yield was significantly lower compared to that of MP60 and GesCoN. ET recorded
    the highest irrigation water usage, and MP60 and GesCoN followed by using 3.4
    and 4.1% less irrigation volume compared to ET. At the same time, GesCoN and MP60
    provided 22.1 and 15.2% higher marketable yield compared to ET plots. Tomato fruit
    marketable yield was highest in plots managed with GesCoN, and lowest in plots
    managed with MP40. MP60 provided marketable yield comparable to both GesCoN and
    ET, and higher compared to MP40. ET managed Plots provided marketable yield lower
    than GesCoN, while not statistically different from MP40. Plants irrigated based
    on MP40 and GesCoN had 25.7% and 27.7%, respectively, higher iWUE compared to
    those irrigated based on ET. The iWUE of MP60 plots was not different from those
    of all the other treatments. However, considering the lower marketable yield observed
    in MP40 plots, its high iWUE was not advantageous compared to MP60 and GesCoN.

    irrigation system performed well and could be an excellent tool for the precision
    irrigation management of plasticulture fresh-market tomato. The batteries for
    the data loggers were charged sufficiently by the attached solar panels. A series
    of data were recorded and displayed for the soil matric potential sensors and
    pressure sensors. Irrigation was applied successfully by controlling the solenoid
    valves based on the soil moisture level. Even though no significant negative effects
    were observed in the sensor data monitoring and valve control, the IoT system
    had a data loss rate of 5.5% on average, which may be attributed to the indoor
    gateway placement and disconnection of each component in the network. In future
    studies, more attention will be given to the signal strength and path loss to
    assist addressing the signal loss issues. High frequency of data communication
    (every minute) largely mitigated this problem. Meanwhile, it was observed that
    the valves did not respond with the first sent signal on some occasions, which
    was possibly caused by the low voltage power used for the valves. A higher voltage
    power supply is suggested for future system design. The marketable fruit yield
    and iWUE were analyzed and compared for all four treatments. MP40 used much lower
    irrigation volume than other treatments likely because of improper installation
    and positioning of the soil matric potential sensor. The other three treatments
    used similar irrigation volume, nevertheless, the higher marketable fruit yield
    obtained with GesCoN compared to ET could be explained by a better distribution
    of irrigation water throughout the growing season and potentially by lower loss
    of nutrients. The gain in marketable yield while saving water observed in both
    GesCoN and MP60, compared to ET-based irrigation management, is consistent with
    the results of previous studies. Therefore, we can suggest both methods have the
    potential to improve vegetable crop water use efficiency and sustainability. Moreover,
    the IoT-based system developed using LoRaWAN technology and employing MP sensors
    can be potentially used for precision and automatic irrigation applications in
    vegetable production systems, and could be integrated with the GesCoN that currently
    does not allow automatic irrigation and/or fertigation. To effectively use sensor-based
    irrigation, an adequate number of sensors should be installed in representative
    areas across the field. If the sensors installed do not represent the average
    condition of the field, as was observed with MP40, using multiple sensors can
    mitigate the error induced by malfunctioning or misplaced soil moisture sensors.
    It is important for the sensors to provide representative readings to ensure the
    effectiveness of the sensor-based irrigation. DSS systems such as GesCoN, on the
    other hand, require the use of a nearby weather station and the development and
    calibration of the water balance model for specific crops and environments. If
    the models at the base of the DSS are not accurate, the DSS-based irrigation cannot
    assure optimal crop performances. While the GesCoN does not require the use of
    soil moisture sensors, in the future the two methods could be combined. The sensors’
    readings can be used to double-check the recommendations provided by the DSS.
    Moreover, the sensors’ readings can be used to validate and improve the accuracy
    of the DSS model. In this experiment, the irrigation was controlled manually through
    the IoT platform. The signal loss of the system and no response of valves limited
    the possibility to apply automatic irrigation control. Future improvements will
    be made with adding automatic irrigation rules to the IoT platform or in the data
    logger to achieve fully automatic irrigation. 4. Conclusion An IoT-based precision
    irrigation system with LoRaWAN technology was developed and evaluated in a plasticulture
    fresh-market tomato field. The following major conclusions can be drawn from the
    study: (1) In general, the system worked effectively for irrigation application
    in the tomato field. The soil moisture levels were monitored and recorded throughout
    the growing season. The irrigation was applied successfully by controlling the
    solenoid valves based on the soil moisture level. The batteries for the data loggers
    were charged sufficiently by the attached solar panels. (2) The IoT system provided
    real-time soil moisture data and indicated that the scheduled irrigations for
    the matric potential treatments are sufficient. (3) Among tested treatments, MP40
    provided the worst performance in terms of marketable yield, while GesCoN provided
    the best performance increasing yield (22.1%) and iWUE (27.7%) compared to ET-based
    irrigation scheduling. MP60 provided the second-best performance, although marketable
    yield and iWUE were not significantly different from both GesCoN and ET-based
    irrigation scheduling. The results suggest that the developed IoT-based system
    using LoRaWAN technology can be potentially used for precision and automatic irrigation
    applications and improve the sustainability of vegetable production systems enhancing
    marketable yield while saving irrigation water. In the future, using outdoor gateway
    and higher voltage batteries for driving the solenoid valve may further improve
    the LoRaWAN IoT based irrigation system. Declaration of Competing Interest The

    \ Rawalpindi, Pakistan, 22–24 September 2022.\nAbstract: The ever-increasing world’s\
    \ population, the consequent heavy demand for food supply,\nand the lack of rain-fed\
    \ agriculture to meet such demands have increased the role of irrigation\nin agricultural\
    \ production. Water management in the irrigation system is the biggest problem,\n\
    particularly in regions where the effects of climate change are noticeable. The\
    \ amount and timing\nof the crop’s water requirements are under debate. Information\
    \ about crops, weather, and/or soil\nis needed for this purpose. Unfortunately,\
    \ getting such information is difﬁcult, especially when\nworking with enormous\
    \ tracts of property. Scientists have been working to ﬁnd the answers to these\n\
    issues for many years. The use of remote sensing to gather the necessary data\
    \ is one area that has\nattracted interest. The advantage of remote sensing is\
    \ that data collection over vast distances becomes\nsimple and efﬁcient. For the\
    \ purpose of enhancing sustainability, crop yield, and environmental\nquality,\
    \ precision agriculture involves the use of agronomic concepts and innovative\
    \ technology to\ncontrol the geographical and temporal variance related to every\
    \ aspect of agricultural output. Crop\nwater status is monitored in agricultural\
    \ areas using a variety of remote sensing techniques. It mainly\nincludes remote\
    \ sensing, crop monitoring in terms of water management, the use of drones, and\n\
    modern irrigation techniques for the purpose of saving water and increasing water\
    \ use efﬁciency in\ncrops. This review is focused on remote sensing technologies\
    \ for precision irrigation used to calculate\nevapotranspiration, infrared thermography,\
    \ crop water status, and crop attributes. The framework\nfor achieving this goal\
    \ has included precision agriculture as a valuable element. By using these\ntechniques,\
    \ we can overcome the problem of water shortage, which is crucial for agriculture.\n\
    Keywords: precision agriculture; remote sensors; crop water status; irrigation\
    \ management\n1. Introduction\nPrecision farming is at the center of offering\
    \ solutions to the industry’s major issues.\nPrecision agriculture is deﬁned as\
    \ the “application of technologies that integrate sensors,\ninformation systems,\
    \ improved machinery, and versed management to optimize productiv-\nity within\
    \ sustainable agricultural systems”. The main goals of precision farming include\n\
    economic viability, environmental protection, and sustainability. It is considered\
    \ a system\nthat assists in reorganizing the total agricultural system in the\
    \ direction of sustainable,\nlow-input, and high-efﬁciency agriculture [1]. However,\
    \ it is still difﬁcult to determine how\nmuch water is needed to run various irrigation\
    \ management systems for a wide variety of\ncrops. To meet the certain irrigation\
    \ requirements of each crop ﬁeld on the farm, irrigation\nsystems are selected,\
    \ created, and managed through the use of sensors. We must better\nmanage our\
    \ water resources if we want to produce enough food to fulﬁll future demands\n\
    in an era of decreasing water availability. Good information is necessary for\
    \ management\nEnviron. Sci. Proc. 2022, 23, 31. https://doi.org/10.3390/environsciproc2022023031\n\

    2 of 4\nand planning irrigation systems, yet it is currently difﬁcult to ﬁnd credible\
    \ information\non how to use water resources. It is not a simple task to provide\
    \ accurate information\nat scales ranging from farmer ﬁelds complete river basins,\
    \ including millions of hectares\nof irrigated land. However, general information\
    \ about the agricultural and hydrological\ncharacteristics of the land surface\
    \ may be obtained for large areas using space-borne remote\nsensing measures [2].\
    \ During the last 20 years, there have been signiﬁcant advancements\nin the ability\
    \ of remote sensing applications to recognize and monitor crop growth and\nother\
    \ associated biophysical characteristics; however, there are still a number of\
    \ problems\nthat need to be ﬁxed. Depending on the capabilities of data gathering\
    \ and analysis, remote\nsensing techniques are now recognized as efﬁcient and\
    \ effective measurements for irri-\ngation water management [3]. The development\
    \ of technologies such as remote sensing,\nmobile computing, telemetry, and satellite\
    \ monitoring has greatly aided the solution of\nthe water management problem [4].\
    \ For various crops, it is crucial to maintain a powerful\nconnection between\
    \ farm water conditions and crop production [5]. The exercise of remote\nsensing\
    \ techniques has signiﬁcantly enhanced the characterization of surface water bodies,\n\
    the forecasting of rainfall and temperature, the estimation of soil moisture,\
    \ soil surface\ncharacteristics, and evapotranspiration. With the use of high-resolution\
    \ satellite data, it is\nnow feasible to monitor ﬂood, drought, and irrigation\
    \ management events in close to real\ntime [5].\n2. Remote Sensing for Water Management\n\
    Remote sensing systems employing information and communication technologies\n\
    generally produce enormous amounts of spectrum data due to the high spatial, temporal,\n\
    and radiometric resolutions necessary for applications in precision agriculture\
    \ [6].\n2.1. Remote Sensors\nModern agriculture is increasingly relying on the\
    \ remote sensors for improved crop\nproduction with the efﬁcient use of resources.\
    \ The energy released by crops is calculated\nby thermal infrared sensors to determine\
    \ the temperature, which is used to determine\nthe irrigation needs and crop water\
    \ shortages. Microwave sensors operate similarly to\nthermal sensors in order\
    \ to measure the estimated energy from the ground surface. These\nare mostly utilized\
    \ for large-scale irrigation of crops and soil moisture measurements [7]. A\n\
    unique sustainable agriculture method enables the supply of water to the plant\
    \ in small,\nregulated dosages at the proper times and locations to ensure the\
    \ best possible growing\ncircumstances [7].\n2.2. Modern Irrigation Technology\n\
    A crucial component in adjusting the water needs of crops is the use of sensors\
    \ to\nmonitor crop water status. Numerous soil scientists see soil variables,\
    \ such as soil water\ncontent, as an essential component of scheduling tools for\
    \ regulating irrigation [8]. For\nchecking or detecting the water content in a\
    \ soil network of wireless sensors, various\nmobile applications and software\
    \ were built. The design of wireless sensor networks was\ncreated, and the new\
    \ irrigation management system was developed using this network as\na basis. With\
    \ the assistance of data analysts, the irrigation test is achieved by using real-\n\
    time moisture data and expert data. The smart irrigation technologies include\
    \ monitoring\ndevices and different types of sensors, such as some mobile applications,\
    \ temperature\nsensors, and soil moisture sensors, as shown in Figure 1. This\
    \ technology is considered\neffective and practicable for use in the ﬁelds of\
    \ precision agriculture and sustainable\nwater resources.\nEnviron. Sci. Proc.\
    \ 2022, 23, 31\n3 of 4\nEnviron. Sci. Proc. 2022, 23, 31 \n3 of 4 \n \n \n \n\
    Figure 1. Smart Irrigation Technologies. \nNevertheless, water scarcity, inadequate\
    \ irrigation infrastructure, low water quality, \ninadequate financial resources\
    \ , limited farmer involvement in decision-making, and \nfewer extension services\
    \ are the main obstacles preventing the development of modern \nirrigation practices\
    \ [8]. To improve irrigation management, farmers must monitor data \nsuch as soil\
    \ type, soil pH, soil moisture, and nutrients, to make decisions that reduce ag-\n\
    ricultural problems. In order to address the complex issues relevant to agriculture,\
    \ the \ncurrent methodology and developing technologies must be integrated into\
    \ a data-driven \ntechnology to achieve proper irrigation [8]. \n2.3. Drones \n\
    More recent data may be provided by a drone, which allows for great precision\
    \ in \ndetermining water usage issues that are not seen clearly on the ground\
    \ level. Therefore, \nto upgrade crop quality, production, and profitability,\
    \ precision farming builds on the use \nof cutting-edge technologies, including\
    \ field mapping and satellite imaging. Additionally, \nit makes the best use of\
    \ conventional resources. Huang [6] created a cutting-edge drone \nwith an infrared\
    \ camera to examine the agricultural area and illustrate the difference be-\n\
    tween healthy and infected crops [8]. Drone surveillance of greenhouses can boost\
    \ agri-\ncultural production by detecting insect assaults earlier, which lowers\
    \ the trip expenses \nover extremely vast distances and fixes any irrigation problems\
    \ found on the farm. Addi-\ntionally, drones and intelligent sensors might be\
    \ used to provide an effective tool for ag-\nriculture in the future. \n3. Conclusions\
    \ \nThere is unquestionably a need for better management of the world's agricultural\
    \ \nresources, such as water, due to the growing population pressure and the requirement\
    \ for \nenhanced agricultural production. To accomplish this, it is important\
    \ to gather trustwor-\nthy information on the types, quality, amount, and locations\
    \ of water resources. Remote \nsensing technology is a crucial instrument for\
    \ enhancing the current system of collecting \nand producing data on agriculture\
    \ and natural resources. The ability to schedule irriga-\ntion and assess the\
    \ effectiveness of irrigation systems using data received from remote \nsensing\
    \ makes it a significant tool in irrigation water management. Since irrigation\
    \ plays \na significant role in agricultural output, the new emerging technologies\
    \ of remote sensing \nand modern irrigation techniques will prove to be very fruitful\
    \ for water management in \nvast irrigation systems and enhancing the water use\
    \ efficiency of crops. \nFigure 1. Smart Irrigation Technologies.\nNevertheless,\
    \ water scarcity, inadequate irrigation infrastructure, low water quality,\ninadequate\
    \ ﬁnancial resources, limited farmer involvement in decision-making, and fewer\n\
    extension services are the main obstacles preventing the development of modern\
    \ irrigation\npractices [8]. To improve irrigation management, farmers must monitor\
    \ data such as soil\ntype, soil pH, soil moisture, and nutrients, to make decisions\
    \ that reduce agricultural\nproblems. In order to address the complex issues relevant\
    \ to agriculture, the current\nmethodology and developing technologies must be\
    \ integrated into a data-driven technology\nto achieve proper irrigation [8].\n\
    2.3. Drones\nMore recent data may be provided by a drone, which allows for great\
    \ precision in\ndetermining water usage issues that are not seen clearly on the\
    \ ground level. Therefore, to\nupgrade crop quality, production, and proﬁtability,\

    \ ﬁeld mapping and satellite imaging. Additionally, it\nmakes the best use of\
    \ conventional resources. Huang [6] created a cutting-edge drone with\nan infrared\

    production by detecting insect assaults earlier, which lowers the trip expenses\
    \ over ex-\ntremely vast distances and ﬁxes any irrigation problems found on the\
    \ farm. Additionally,\ndrones and intelligent sensors might be used to provide\
    \ an effective tool for agriculture in\nthe future.\n3. Conclusions\nThere is\
    \ unquestionably a need for better management of the world’s agricultural\nresources,\

    water resources in Nebraska and other irrigated agricultural areas require innovations
    and solutions for the governance of water allocation. This study proposes the
    use of sensor-based method for irrigation which has the potential to improve irrigation
    water use efficiency (IWUE). Practical methods and algorithms for creating irrigation
    prescriptions have become vital for the adoption of precision irrigation. A decision
    support system (DSS) for uniform irrigation was evaluated during 2020 growing
    season in a sub-humid region. The DSS was managed using soil water and plant feedback.
    In field practice, a sensor node station comprising of soil water content sensors
    and infrared thermometer (IRT) was installed in maize and soybean. Root zone water
    depletion (Drw), and crop water stress index (CWSI) served as the inputs for soil
    water, and plant feedback, respectively. The timing and depth of irrigation was
    determined using the DSS. The results of the sensor-based DSS treatment were compared
    to conventional treatment (managed by a crop consultant) and rainfed (no-irrigation)
    treatment. Test results for maize and soybean indicated that there was no significant
    difference in crop yield between sensor-based and conventional treatments. However,
    the sensor-based DSS treatment witnessed higher IWUE for both maize and soybean.
    The observed yield for rainfed treatment was significantly lower than the irrigated
    treatments in maize and soybean. There is a great potential for the use of this
    DSS system for uniform irrigation in humid and sub-humid regions and future studies
    are required for the adoption of this technology. (Download PDF)    (Export to

    major challenges in agriculture, affecting crop growth and food security. IoT
    and AI techniques are being explored for sustainable development, including water
    management, precision irrigation, and data analytics. IoT sensors collect real-time
    data, while AI algorithms predict availability and optimize irrigation schedules.
    Precision irrigation improves water use efficiency and productivity by utilizing
    data analytics and clustering algorithms. IoT and AI in agriculture offer economic
    benefits like increased crop yields, water savings, and sustainable practices.
    However, initial investment costs, social acceptance, and policy considerations
    hinder widespread adoption. Future directions should focus on scaling, collaboration,
    investment, customizable solutions, farmer-to-farmer knowledge transfer, and research
    funding. Addressing data privacy, security, and connectivity concerns is crucial
    for trust and confidence among stakeholders. Request access from your librarian

    for agriculture, providing essential nutrients and sustaining food production.
    However, water scarcity and deteriorating quality are interconnected challenges
    affecting crop yields, food security, and environmental sustainability. Inefficient
    water management practices and wasteful utilization exacerbate these issues. To
    address these issues and promote sustainable agricultural development, the integration
    of IoT and AI techniques in water treatment and utilization is gaining attention
    as a transformative approach. Agriculture accounts for a substantial portion of
    the world''s freshwater consumption, representing approximately 70% of global
    water withdrawals. As the global population is projected to reach 9 billion by
    2050, the demand for food and water is expected to increase significantly (Karthik
    et al., 2023; Koshariya, Kalaiyarasi, et al., 2023; Maguluri et al., 2023; Syamala
    et al., 2023). Concurrently, climate change-induced uncertainties, such as irregular
    precipitation patterns and more frequent extreme weather events, are further straining
    water availability. To safeguard food production and mitigate the impact of water
    scarcity, innovative and sustainable solutions are urgently needed. Traditional
    agricultural practices often rely on conventional irrigation methods, such as
    flood irrigation or overhead sprinklers, which result in significant water wastage
    and uneven distribution across fields. Moreover, the indiscriminate use of fertilizers
    and pesticides contaminates water sources, compromising water quality and posing
    risks to human health and ecosystems. To address these issues, a paradigm shift
    is required in water management practices, emphasizing resource efficiency, precision
    irrigation, and conservation-oriented practices. The integration of IoT and AI
    technologies offers a promising avenue to revolutionize water management in agriculture
    (Boopathi, 2023c; Hema et al., 2023). IoT devices, including sensors and connected
    devices, enable real-time data collection and monitoring of various environmental
    parameters, such as soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and water quality.
    These devices create a networked ecosystem that facilitates the continuous exchange
    of information between agricultural systems and decision-makers. By providing
    accurate and timely data, IoT devices enhance the understanding of water dynamics
    and enable informed decision-making (Reddy et al., 2023; Samikannu et al., 2022).
    AI, on the other hand, empowers agricultural systems with the ability to analyze
    vast datasets and extract meaningful insights. Machine learning algorithms can
    process historical and real-time data to predict water demand, optimize irrigation
    schedules, and identify anomalies, leading to more efficient water usage (Anitha
    et al., 2023; Boopathi, Sureshkumar, et al., 2022; Vanitha et al., 2023). AI-driven
    precision irrigation systems tailor water application to the specific needs of
    crops and soil conditions, reducing water wastage and increasing crop productivity.
    Additionally, AI techniques can assist in water quality monitoring, enabling early
    detection of contamination and timely remediation measures. One of the primary
    applications of IoT and AI integration in agriculture is smart irrigation. Smart
    irrigation systems utilize IoT sensors to monitor soil moisture levels, temperature,
    humidity, and other relevant parameters (Bikash Chandra Saha, 2022; Boopathi,
    Lewise, Sarojwal, et al., 2022; Jeevanantham et al., 2022). This data is then
    analyzed using AI algorithms to determine the precise amount of water required
    by each crop, ensuring that water is delivered in optimal quantities and at the
    right time. This targeted approach to irrigation minimizes water wastage, reduces
    energy consumption, and fosters sustainable water use practices. Continue Reading

    Get rights and content Abstract In its broadest sense, water productivity (WP)
    is the net return for a unit of water used. Improvement of water productivity
    aims at producing more food, income, better livelihoods and ecosystem services
    with less water. There is considerable scope for improving water productivity
    of crop, livestock and fisheries at field through to basin scale. Practices used
    to achieve this include water harvesting, supplemental irrigation, deficit irrigation,
    precision irrigation techniques and soil–water conservation practices. Practices
    not directly related to water management impact water productivity because of
    interactive effects such as those derived from improvements in soil fertility,
    pest and disease control, crop selection or access to better markets. However,
    there are several reasons to be cautious about the scope and ease of achieving
    water productivity gains. Crop water productivity is already quite high in highly
    productive regions, and gains in yield (per unit of land area) do not necessarily
    translate into gains in water productivity. Reuse of water that takes place within
    an irrigated area or a basin can compensate for the perceived losses at the field-scale
    in terms of water quantity, though the water quality is likely to be affected.
    While crop breeding has played an important role in increasing water productivity
    in the past, especially by improving the harvest index, such large gains are not
    easily foreseen in the future. More importantly, enabling conditions for farmers
    and water managers are not in place to enhance water productivity. Improving water
    productivity will thus require an understanding of the biophysical as well as
    the socioeconomic environments crossing scales between field, farm and basin.
    Priority areas where substantive increases in water productivity are possible
    include: (i) areas where poverty is high and water productivity is low, (ii) areas
    of physical water scarcity where competition for water is high, (iii) areas with
    little water resources development where high returns from a little extra water
    use can make a big difference, and (iv) areas of water-driven ecosystem degradation,
    such as falling groundwater tables, and river desiccation. However, achieving
    these gains will be challenging at least, and will require strategies that consider
    complex biophysical and socioeconomic factors. Previous article in issue Next

    the ratio of the net benefits from crop, forestry, fishery, livestock and mixed
    agricultural systems to the amount of water used to produce those benefits. In
    its broadest sense, it reflects the objectives of producing more food, income,
    livelihood and ecological benefits at less social and environmental cost per unit
    of water consumed. Physical water productivity is defined as the ratio of agricultural
    output to the amount of water consumed – “more crop per drop” –, and economic
    water productivity is defined as the value derived per unit of water used and
    this has also been used to relate water use in agriculture to nutrition, jobs,
    welfare and the environment. The denominator of the water productivity equation
    is expressed in terms of either water supply or water depletion. Water is depleted
    when it is consumed by evapotranspiration (ET), is incorporated into a product,
    flows to a location where it cannot be readily reused, or if it becomes heavily
    polluted (Seckler, 1996, Molden et al., 2003). The water productivity concept
    evolved from separate fields. Crop physiologists originally defined water use
    efficiency as carbon assimilated and crop yield per unit of transpiration (Viets,
    1962), and then later as the amount of produce (biomass or marketable yield) per
    unit of ET. Irrigation specialists have used the term water use efficiency to
    describe how effectively water is delivered to crops and to indicate the amount
    of water wasted. But this concept provides only a partial view because it does
    not indicate the benefits produced, nor does it specify that water lost by irrigation
    is often reused by other uses (Seckler et al., 2003). The current focus of water
    productivity has evolved to include the benefits and costs of water used for agriculture
    in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Increasing WP is particularly appropriate
    where water is scarce compared with other resources involved in production. Reasons
    to improve agricultural water productivity include: (i) to meet rising demands
    for food from a growing, wealthier, and increasingly urbanized population in light
    of water scarcity, (ii) to respond to pressures to re-allocate water from agriculture
    to cities and ensure that water is available for environmental uses, and (iii)
    to contribute to poverty reduction and economic growth. For the rural poor, more
    productive use of water can mean better nutrition for families, more income and
    productive employment. Targeting high water productivity can reduce investment
    costs by reducing the amount of water that has to be withdrawn. Higher water productivity
    reduces the need for additional water and land resources in irrigated and rainfed
    systems. Enhancing water productivity is thus a critical response to growing water
    scarcity, including the need to leave enough water in rivers to sustain ecosystems
    to meet the growing demands of cities and industries (e.g., Hengsdijk et al.,
    2006). Globally, the additional amount of water needed to support agriculture
    directly depends on gains in water productivity. With no gains, average annual
    agricultural ET could double in the next 50 years (de Fraiture et al., 2007).
    But with enough investments in improving water productivity the increase in global
    ET could be held down to 20–30%. Irrigation systems are already under pressure
    to produce more with reduced supplies of water. Allocations for irrigation are
    diminishing in many river basins because of increased demands from cities and
    the environment, and in response, efforts need to be aimed at increasing water
    productivity so that farmers can continue to produce. In spite of the need for
    increasing, and the opportunities to increase, water productivity, gains are elusive
    due to a number of complex interacting factors. The objective of this paper is
    to present a comprehensive analysis of the water productivity concept, to identify
    promising approaches for its improvement and to identify key constraints that
    must be overcome. 2. Improving agricultural water productivity 2.1. Biophysical
    background of WP at the plant scale Assessing the scope for gains in water productivity
    requires an understanding of basic biological and hydrological crop–water relations.
    How much more water will be needed for agriculture in the future is governed,
    to a large extent, by links between water, food and changes in diets. The amount
    of water that we consume when eating food depends on diet and also on the water
    productivity of the agriculture production system. The amount of water required
    for field crops and its relation to yield dominates the equation on the need for
    additional water for food. For a given crop variety and climate there is a well-established
    linear relationship between plant biomass and transpiration (de Wit, 1958, Tanner
    and Sinclair, 1983, Steduto et al., 2007). Different kinds of plants are more
    water efficient in terms of the ratio between biomass and transpiration. More
    biomass production requires more transpiration because when stomata open, carbon
    dioxide flows into the leaves for photosynthesis and water flows out. Water outflow
    is essential for cooling and for creating liquid movement in the plant for transporting
    nutrients. Stomata close during drought, thereby limiting transpiration, photosynthesis
    and production. The most common crops, C3 crops such as wheat and barley, are
    less water-efficient than C4 crops such as maize and sugarcane. The most water-efficient
    crops are the CAM (crassulacean acid metabolism) crops such as cactus and pineapple.
    These different plant types (C3, C4 and CAM) have evolved according to their different
    environments, and are classified primarily based on how they fix carbon dioxide
    in the photosynthetic process (Steduto, 1996). To boost economic yield, plant
    breeders have developed varieties with a higher harvest index (the ratio of marketable
    grain yield to total crop biomass), achieving more economic produce per unit of
    transpiration. This breeding strategy has probably raised the potential for gains
    in water productivity more than any other agronomic practice over the last 40
    years (Keller and Seckler, 2004). The harvest index for wheat and maize rose from
    about 0.35 before the 1960s to 0.5 in the 1980s (Sayre et al., 1997), when plant
    breeders of the green revolution focused their attention on these crops. But the
    rate of increase in the harvest index has slowed over the last 20 years as physiological
    limits are being reached, and, thus, there has been a slowdown in the rate of
    gains in water productivity that are achieved through this method. In situations
    where yield is less than 40–50% of the potential, non-water factors such as soil
    fertility limit yield and crop water productivity per unit of ET (Tanner and Sinclair,
    1983). Land degradation and nutrient depletion significantly constrain opportunities
    to increase water productivity. In these situations there is a synergistic effect
    when water practices that increase access to water at the right time or reduce
    land degradation processes are combined with other agronomic practices such as
    maintaining soil health and fertility, controlling weeds and disease and the timing
    of planting. Such synergistic interactions between production factors raise water
    productivity, especially when yield values are low, because most production resources
    are used more efficiently as yield levels rise (de Wit, 1992). When yields are
    above 40–50% of their potential, however, yield gains come at a near proportionate
    increase in the amount of ET (Fig. 1), thus incremental gains in water productivity
    become smaller as yields become higher. Raising yields from 1 to 2 tons per hectare
    (ha) will lead to much more gains in water productivity than doubling the yield
    from 4 to 8 tons per ha. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. A plot of
    yield versus water productivity shows that water productivity rises faster at
    lower yields and levels off at higher yields. Source: Adapted from Zwart and Bastiaanssen
    (2004). This relationship between transpiration and crop production has far-reaching
    consequences for water. Increases in food production in productive areas are achieved
    with near proportionate increases in transpired water. This is the reason why
    increases in food production have taken water from ecosystems, thereby reducing
    the amount of water transpired by forests and grass and reducing water flows to
    the sea, and is also the reason why future production will continue to do the
    same. Feeding more people will require more water to be transpired. The amount
    of additional transpiration depends on the changes made in water productivity.
    3. Reasons for optimism 3.1. Reaching the biophysical potential While there is
    a fixed relationship between biomass and transpiration, there is substantial variability
    in yield relative to transpiration because of differences in evaporation, harvest
    index, climate conditions, cultivars, water stress, pest and diseases, nutritional
    and soil status, and other management and agronomic practices. Thus, there appears
    to be considerable scope for raising the amount of yield relative to ET before
    reaching the upper limit (the straight line in Fig. 2 that coincides with the
    reputed linear relationship between transpiration and yield). That much of variability
    is due to management practices (French and Schultz, 1984) and is important because
    it offers hope for possible improvements in the ratio between marketable produce
    and ET. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Variations between yield and
    evapotranspiration for wheat in different regions of the world. Source: Adapted
    from Sadras and Angus (2006). Reducing evaporation while increasing productive
    transpiration can enhance water productivity at the field level. Evaporation varies
    with agricultural practices (Burt et al., 2005) and ranges from 4% to 25% in sprinkler
    irrigation systems (Burt et al., 2001), and up to 40% and more in rainfed systems
    (Rockström et al., 2003). The amount of evaporation depends on climate, soils
    and the extent of the crop canopy. Practices such as mulching, plowing or crop
    breeding for fast leaf expansion – in order to shade the ground as rapidly as
    possible – reduce evaporation and increase productive transpiration. In arid environments,
    up to 90% of rainfall evaporates back into the atmosphere. Water harvesting can
    increase the beneficial rainwater available for transpiration from 20% to 50%
    (Oweis et al., 1999). Supplemental irrigation (adding a little irrigation in critical
    stages to supplement rainfall) and deficit irrigation (irrigating but less than
    the full amount) can increase the productivity of water. In Northern Syria, water
    productivity of wheat improved from 0.06 kilograms (kg) of grain per cubic meter
    of ET to 1.85 with the addition of small amounts of irrigation water at the right
    time (Oweis and Hachum, 2003, Zhang and Oweis, 1999). Grain yields of sorghum
    in Burkina Faso and maize in Kenya were increased from 0.5 metric tons per hectare
    to 1.5–2.0 tons with supplemental irrigation plus soil fertility management (Rockström
    et al., 2003). These practices are particularly effective when water supplies
    are constrained by the limited supply or the high costs of water. In arid and
    semi-arid regions, nutrient limitations set a stronger ceiling on yield than water
    availability (Breman et al., 2001, Bindraban et al., 1999). Fertilizer use is
    low in many parts of Africa and this constrains water productivity (Twomlow et
    al., 1999). In sub-Saharan Africa, only 9 kg of nutrients are used per hectare
    as compared to 73 kg used in Latin America, 100 kg in South Asia and 135 kg in
    East and Southeast Asia (Kelly, 2006, p. 1). With the currently available amounts
    of rainfall, improvements in soil fertility could double productivity. Current
    levels of water productivity show a large variation by commodity (Table 1). Differences
    within a commodity reflect the effects of management, thereby implying that there
    is scope for improvement. Differences between commodities arise from differences
    in economic value, water content of the product and water requirement. A better
    water management environment can, in some cases, allow users to switch readily
    between commodities. Table 1. Range of water productivities in biological, economical
    and nutritional terms for selected commodities (Molden et al., 2007a, Molden et

    additional nutritional inputs to superintensive systems. 3.2. Looking beyond crops
    There is much more scope for increasing the value per unit of water used in agriculture
    (economic water productivity) rather than increasing physical water productivity,
    which is becoming increasingly constrained. Strategies for increasing the net
    value of water used in agriculture include: increasing yield, changing from low
    to high value crops, re-allocating water from low to higher valued uses, lowering
    the costs of inputs, increasing health benefits and the value of ecological services
    of agriculture, decreasing social, health, and environmental costs, obtaining
    multiple benefits per unit of water, and achieving more welfare per unit of water.
    Increasing the value generated by water use and decreasing associated costs require
    understanding and interventions that look – beyond the direct production benefits
    and investment costs of agricultural water management – to the livelihood and
    ecological benefits and costs. 3.2.1. Livestock water productivity Globally, livestock
    production accounts for some 20% of agricultural ET (de Fraiture et al., 2007),
    and this proportion is projected to grow substantially with the increasing consumption
    of animal products. Reducing the amount of water required for livestock production
    could thus contribute considerably to reducing future agricultural water needs.
    The physical water productivity of animal products is derived mainly from the
    water required for the food that animals consume. Estimates of the amount of ET
    required to produce 1 kg of animal products vary widely between 3000 and 15,000
    l (Molden et al., 2007a, Molden et al., 2007b) depending on management practices,
    the kind of feed, how crop residues are used, the processing system, and how well
    the animals convert feed and plants into the animal product. Gains in livestock
    water productivity can be made by adjusting each of these factors. There is considerable
    scope for increases in livestock productivity, in both physical and economic water
    productivity (Peden et al., 2007). Strategies to enhance water productivity include
    improving feed sourcing of animals, enhancing animal production (milk, meat, eggs),
    improving health through veterinary services, grazing practices that avoid land
    degradation to lessen the amount of water required for grazing and reduce negative
    environmental impacts such as erosion (Peden et al., 2007). Livestock generate
    numerous values beyond food production that should be taken into account, including
    transport, plowing, support of cultural values and a means of buffering against
    drought. 3.2.2. Fisheries and aquaculture As with livestock, there is considerable
    scope for better integration of fisheries and aquaculture with water management
    systems to improve water productivity. The two major components of water use in
    aquaculture are the water required to produce feed and the blue water required
    for aquaculture. Water productivity is the mass or value of the aquaculture produce
    divided by the amount of water required for feed plus the amount of evaporation
    from the pond. On-farm water use in aquaculture can be as low as 500–700 l in
    super-intensive re-circulation systems and as high as 45,000 l of water per kilogram
    of produce in extensive ponds (Verdegem et al., 2006). Fish can often be integrated
    into water management systems with the addition of little or no water (Prein,
    2002). Renwick (2001) found that the fisheries in irrigation reservoirs at Kirindi
    Oya, Sri Lanka, contributed income equal to 18% of the rice production in the
    system. Fisheries in lakes, rivers and wetlands are only one of the many ecosystem
    services provided by aquatic ecosystems. The values and livelihood benefits of
    fisheries are high and often ignored or underestimated, but considering only the
    values of fish produced per unit of water would grossly underestimate the value
    of water in these aquatic ecosystems. Thus, maintenance of wetlands and biodiversity
    and their livelihood values should be considered, in addition to fish production,
    as potential benefits of leaving water in these aquatic ecosystems. 3.2.3. Applying
    integrated approaches Designing and managing agricultural water for multiple uses
    – drinking water, industries, livestock, fisheries – raises the economic productivity
    of water in water management systems (Meinzen-Dick, 1997, Bhatnagar et al., 2004,
    Nguyen-Khoa et al., 2005, van Koppen et al., 2006). Irrigation provides water
    for fruit and shade trees, habitat to sustain biodiversity and is a source of
    recharge for groundwater, which is a common source of rural drinking water supporting
    the livelihoods of smallholders. Integrated agriculture-aquaculture provides a
    means of recycling water and nutrients and obtaining more value and income from
    farm enterprises (Gupta et al., 1999). Multi-functional farm ponds, storing water
    for crop irrigation and domestic purposes, may be suitable for raising fish to
    improve household nutrition and provide a ready source of income. Agricultural
    water management practices provide multiple ecosystem services beyond food production.
    Practices that reduce environmental costs and enhance ecosystem services increase
    the value derived from agricultural water management (Matsuno et al., 2006, Scherr
    and McNeely, 2007). 3.3. Opening opportunities within river basins and beyond
    There are four primary ways to increase the productivity of water in a basin context:
    (a) increasing the productivity per unit of ET at the plant-, field- and farm-scale,
    as indicated above; (b) minimizing nonproductive depletion of water flows by reducing
    water flows to sinks, minimizing salinization and pollution of return flows and
    discharging polluted water to sinks; (c) improving management of existing irrigation
    facilities and reusing return flows by controlling, diverting and storing drainage
    flows; and (d) re-allocating and co-managing water among uses by re-allocating
    water from lower value to higher value uses within and between sectors, identifying
    and managing committed outflows for the environment and for downstream water allocation,
    co-managing among multiple uses, recognizing multiple uses, and reaping multiple
    benefits while mitigating adverse impacts and incorporating aquaculture, fisheries,
    and livestock considerations into basin management. At larger scales with more
    users, and more interaction between users, water productivity issues become increasingly
    complex. The intersectoral nature of water, competition for water use, resource
    degradation and issues of equity come into play. Assessing the impact of a change
    in basin water use requires analysis of the changes in benefits and costs and
    their distribution among stakeholders. The first part of the analysis requires
    a hydrological examination to understand the changes in quality, quantity and
    timing of water for different uses. This is not always obvious because of complex
    hydrologic interconnections. People who tap into a stream in the hills may have
    no idea of the consequences for downstream agriculture or wetlands. The second
    part requires a comprehensive valuation exercise to assess marginal water productivity
    and the nonmarketable values associated with water use such as the those derived
    from ecosystem services (Ward and Michelsen, 2002). For example, if a small amount
    of water is moved from agriculture to a higher value industry, it can generate
    a large net gain because water in support of, say, computer chips generates much
    more value than water provided to produce wheat. But industries typically have
    a very low consumptive water requirement, and after enough water is given for
    the industrial process, the value of additional water flowing to industry falls
    to zero—or becomes negative if industry pollutes return flows. Similarly, taking
    a little water from rivers for agriculture may result in very small changes in
    ecosystem services delivered by the river, but this may provide a large gain in
    agricultural value. However, when rivers are reduced to minimum levels, the next
    drop taken out of the river may be at a considerable ecosystem cost. Such analysis
    is not common in part because the integrated hydrological and valuation tools
    are complex and imprecise, but also because there are too few institutional arrangements
    where such information enters the decision-making process. Nevertheless, it is
    possible to make much more informed decisions than those that are being made today.
    Stakeholders representing each use should be involved in decisions on re-allocating
    water and the types of information discussed should be available to them. Valuation
    of nonmarketable functions and services calls for stakeholder processes to decide
    how to balance the needs of the various groups. Disagreements about actual allocation
    will always remain because of the differences in the values, goals, priorities
    and aspirations of people (Warner et al., 2006). Thus, informed multi-stakeholder
    decision-making processes are needed to address conflicts and find constructive
    solutions (Emerton and Bos, 2004). 3.3.1. Increasing WP at the global level Global
    gains in water productivity can be achieved by growing crops in places where climate
    and management practices enable high water productivity and trading them to places
    with lower water productivity. In 1995, global trade from high water productivity
    areas to low water productivity areas resulted in an estimated 7% less ET and
    15% less depletion of irrigation water than would have been required to grow the
    same amount of crops (de Fraiture et al., 2004) without trade. But trade takes
    place for other economic and political reasons, and gains in water productivity
    are merely a by-product. A more detailed analysis of trade that considers payment
    for imports, rural employment and environmental impacts must be considered. This
    is even more important in view of the current high commodity prices which have
    led some countries to raise export tariffs on grains. 4. Reasons for caution 4.1.
    Limits in the scope for increasing crop water productivity Does crop breeding
    and biotechnology hold the key to gains in water productivity? There is controversy
    about the potential for future increases in the harvest index for common crops
    like wheat and rice (Keller and Seckler, 2004). Some argue that much of the potential
    for increasing the harvest index for common grains such as wheat, maize and rice
    was met during the green revolution (Tanner and Sinclair, 1983, Richards et al.,
    1993), and others see some scope, especially in crops such as sorghum and millet,
    that have not received so much intensive research (Bindraban, 1997, Bennett, 2003).
    Crop breeding that targets early growth vigor to reduce evaporation and increase
    resistance to droughts, disease or salinity could all improve water productivity
    per unit of ET. Moderate impacts on crop water productivity from improvements
    in plant genetics should be expected in the medium-term. Because the gap between
    the actual practice and the biophysical potential is so large, greater and easier
    gains are possible through better management. Improvements in plant genetics,
    however, can play an important role in reducing the risk of crop failure. More
    value per unit of ET can be achieved by improving the nutritional quality of crops
    and reducing pesticides and other agrochemical inputs through disease- and pest-resistant
    crops. This can be achieved slowly through conventional breeding, or more quickly
    using appropriate biotechnological tools (Bindraban et al., 2006). How much scope
    is there to increase the grain yield relative to ET? Because of the biophysical
    relation between biomass and transpiration, there is possibly little gain to be
    made in this area (top curve in Fig. 3). The yield versus transpiration index
    has already improved substantially because of changes in the harvest index in
    many places. The lower two lines in Fig. 3 indicate that improvements in physical
    water productivity are possible through improved management that increases the
    ratio of yield to ET. But in many of the most productive areas of the world, such
    as the Lower Yellow River Basin, or in most of Europe, North America and Australia,
    large improvements have already been made and there is little scope for further
    improvements. The implication is that more ET will be required to achieve higher
    yields in these highly productive areas. Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    3. Generalization of past water productivity gains and forecast of gains to made
    in the future. The highest gains in water productivity for common crops such as
    rice, wheat and maize are likely in areas where yields are still low (Molden et
    al., 2007a). 4.2. Water saving potential Saving water, especially to release water
    from irrigated agriculture, can make it available to other, higher value uses
    in cities, industries, ecosystems or more agriculture. A common (mis)perception,
    however, is that irrigation is wasteful because of highly inefficient practices.
    Investments in improving water management are important in increasing WP, but
    many people question whether these practices promote real water savings (Seckler,
    1996, Perry, 1999, Seckler et al., 2003, Molle et al., 2004). Several conditions
    exist where there is actually less scope for saving water in irrigation than commonly
    perceived, especially in cases where drainage water from fields is reused. It
    is well accepted that there is substantial scope to reduce irrigation water deliveries
    through a range of technical and management practices: drip and sprinkler irrigation,
    more precise application practices, canal lining or delivery through pipes, reduced
    allocations of water to farmers or pricing to influence demand. Many of these
    practices increase yields, and are important for water quality management and
    the overall control of water. Several practices, such as alternate wet and dry
    irrigation, are applicable to rice irrigation (Bouman et al., 2007). But, we need
    to be cautious about the expectations of water saving because practices that reduce
    deliveries typically also reduce drainage outflows. First, as a way to cope with
    water stress, farmers commonly reuse these drainage flows by pumping water from
    groundwater or withdrawing water from open drains if possible. Second, those farmers
    who follow water saving practices may use that “saved” water to expand their irrigation.
    Often the perceived gain is offset by a loss (Gichuki, 2004) that is difficult
    to recognize. Reducing deliveries and drainage works well in situations where
    flows cause damage, polluted water, or go to a saline sink (Molden et al., 2001).
    A basin perspective is required to determine if on-farm water management practices
    lead to “real” water savings that can be made available for other uses, or whether
    on-farm practices result in a redistribution of water within agriculture. 4.3.
    Winners and losers in the river basin A change in basin water use will result
    in winners and losers. Putting water into the service of agriculture by expanding
    rainfed systems or adding irrigation takes water away from other uses—forests,
    grasslands, rivers. Expanding agriculture upstream through better rainfall capture
    and artificial storage systems reduces downstream flows supporting other agriculturalists,
    fishers and household users. Producing more food means putting more water into
    production and taking it out of other uses. Water productivity analysis at a basin
    scale can highlight these tradeoffs to help decision makers to develop strategies
    where the desired benefits exceed the undesired costs. Typically, with urbanization,
    water is re-allocated from agriculture to cities (Molle and Berkoff, 2006) and
    from natural uses like rivers and wetlands to agriculture. Rarely are the intrinsic
    values generated by ecosystems and agriculture considered in these re-allocations,
    and often the transfers are made without negotiation or adequate compensation.
    Thus, changes in the practices of farmers are typically in response to the re-allocation
    of supplies rather than the being the driver behind the re-allocation. 4.4. The
    need to establish enabling conditions While many strategies exist for improving
    water productivity, adoption rates remain low for many reasons. Reliable, low-cost
    supplies of sufficient water enable high levels of productivity and reduce risk;
    so why should producers reduce water inputs? And while incentives for agriculture
    to deplete less water are high for society and river basin managers trying to
    allocate limited supplies, they are low for individual agricultural producers
    (Luquet et al., 2005). There are several reasons for this. First, water productivity
    itself is unlikely to feature prominently among the many considerations facing
    resource managers. Farmers rarely manage to increase water productivity; rather,
    they manage to make their entire enterprise profitable or to enhance household
    food security. Factors that influence the uptake of practices that that enhance
    water productivity include costs, profitability, risks, access to markets, water
    availability, education, incentives and institutional structures. Second, increases
    in water productivity at the farm level can actually increase basin water depletion,
    especially where water is scarce compared with land resources. Farmers may see
    technologies that enhance water productivity like drip irrigation as an opportunity
    to expand areas using the same amount of water, ultimately increasing the amount
    of water depleted by agriculture and reducing the amount available for other uses
    (Molle et al., 2004). Third, incentives for increasing water productivity are
    rarely in place. Water scarcity is a key driver behind gains in water productivity,
    with agriculture under pressure from the increased use of water by cities and
    a demand for more allocations for the environment. In areas where this driver
    does not directly influence the decisions of individuals who have water access,
    economic instruments have been considered to reflect the values of physical scarcity.
    Some argue that, in areas where water is scarce, but the price of agricultural
    water is low, farmers are not aware of the scarcity condition. Hence, raising
    the price would reduce agricultural water demand, thus increasing the supply available
    for cities. Others argue that, there is little evidence that pricing is effective
    in reducing irrigation demand because the responsiveness to higher water prices
    is limited by existing systems of water rights, inadequate measurement and monitoring
    of water deliveries, and strong opposition to higher water prices in agrarian
    societies (Hellegers and Perry, 2006, Molle and Berkoff, 2006, Berbel and Gómez-Limón,
    2000). Administrative allocation has been shown to be an effective option when
    farmers must adopt water productivity practices in response to less supply. Fourth,
    there are a variety of actors with different incentives, all influencing water
    productivity and re-allocation (Molden et al., 2007a, Molden et al., 2007b). Society
    has an incentive to allocate water to various uses. Cities in search of more water
    may set their sights on cheap agricultural water. Farmers have an incentive to
    retain their supply for more production relative to costs. Raising prices for
    water can be seen as a further penalty for producers who are already struggling
    to make a living. Understanding incentives, the trade-offs of different management
    options and the proper alignment of incentives across various actors is a key
    to adoption. Thus, adoption and uptake of practices that enhance water productivity
    require understanding potential trade-offs, identifying winners and losers and
    aligning the incentives of all actors. 4.5. The impact of climate change and other
    emerging drivers of change Because climate is central to physical crop water productivity,
    climate change brings about a further uncertainty to the scope for increasing
    water productivity. Higher biomass production per unit of transpiration is achievable
    at a lower vapor pressure deficit (Tanner and Sinclair, 1983), which are common
    at higher latitudes (Zwart and Bastiaanssen, 2004). It has been speculated that
    the higher carbon dioxide levels associated with climate change will raise water
    productivity per unit of ET because more carbon can enter the plant for more photosynthesis
    (Droogers and Aerts, 2005, IPCC, 2001). More recent evidence shows that gains
    in water productivity will be substantially offset by increased temperature (Long
    et al., 2006). In fact, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) points
    to a reduction in potential yields in sub-Saharan Africa, also implying a reduction
    in potential rates of water productivity, but this has yet to be analyzed. Many
    factors outside the water sector must also be considered in efforts to improve
    water productivity. These include changing prices for agricultural commodities,
    increasing demand for biofuels, urbanization and changing diets with a rising
    population (de Fraiture et al., 2008, Molden et al., 2007a, Molden et al., 2007b).
    Policies influencing these drivers will also influence water use, and thereby
    influence the scope for gains in water productivity. While some factors, such
    as the recent increase in commodity prices may make investments in water productivity
    attractive, there is a high degree of uncertainty as to how these will impact
    water productivity in the future (World Bank, 2008). 5. Discussion and conclusions
    Optimists see many possibilities for large gains in water productivity, while
    pessimists see many difficulties in reaching those gains. Rather than try and
    judge who is right, it is more important to understand key messages that both
    optimists and pessimists bring forward. We know that we cannot afford the environmental
    and livelihood costs of not achieving gains in water productivity, and we have
    to recognize that reaching those gains will be a difficult task. We conclude that
    there are gains to be made in water productivity, but these will require policies
    and actions that recognize the complex nature of achieving those gains. There
    is considerable scope for improving water productivity, but not everywhere. The
    scope for improvement remains in many rainfed, irrigated, livestock and fisheries
    systems in many regions of the world. Many farmers in developing countries could
    raise water productivity by adopting proven agronomic and water management practices.
    Many promising pathways for raising water productivity are available over the
    continuum from fully rainfed to fully irrigated farming systems. There are areas
    of the world that already exhibit high physical water productivity, with limited
    scope for improvements. There are much smaller gains to be made in physical water
    productivity when yields increase from 7 to 8 tons per hectare, than when yields
    increase from 1 to 2 tons per hectare. Thus, increasing yields in these highly
    productive areas will require more ET. Also, while many crop breeding strategies
    were successful in increasing water productivity for common crops like wheat,
    rice and maize, their future potential may be limited because gains from these
    strategies have already been made. However, for less common crops, breeding may
    play an important role. The areas with the highest potential gains are those with
    very low yields, such as sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. These are also areas
    of extreme poverty, with the largest concentration of poor people with a high
    dependence on agriculture. This is an important conclusion because a focus on
    these areas can both reduce the amount of additional water needed for agriculture
    globally and help to reduce poverty. Current levels of water productivity show
    a large variation by commodity, implying that there is scope for improvement.
    Optimistic estimations in the scope for saving water in irrigation, an important
    strategy to free up water for cities and the environment, are commonly overstated.
    While there is scope for reducing water applied to fields, and there are good
    reasons to do this, the scope for water savings at a river basin scale is often
    limited because of the prevalence of situations where water is reused. Moreover,
    water saving measures that do not adequately take into consideration how other
    users of water are impacted may result in a gain for one user and a loss for another
    user. There is great scope for increasing economic water productivity by increasing
    the value generated by water use and decreasing associated costs. But to achieve
    these gains will require an understanding and interventions that look beyond the
    direct production benefits and investment costs of agricultural water management
    to the livelihood and ecological benefits and costs. These interventions need
    to be framed within a river basin perspective to understand the complex web of
    impacts on numerous users. In fact, a number of key drivers including climate
    change, urbanization, changes in population and diets, and changing commodity
    prices will require that systems need to rapidly respond to take advantage of
    potential gains in water productivity. Where we know there is potential to increase
    physical and economic water productivity, adoption of practices that enhance water
    productivity is slow. While society may have the incentives to increase water
    productivity, agricultural producers may not. Producers manage labor and other
    inputs to get better economic gains, and the incentive for increasing water productivity
    is, typically, not high on their agenda. The adoption of techniques to improve
    water productivity will, therefore, require an enabling policy and an institutional
    environment that aligns the incentives of producers, resource managers and society,
    and provides a mechanism for dealing with trade-offs. References Bennett, 2003

    • Our studies investigated options and difficulties to improve water-efficient
    practices. • Technological improvements have not brought full benefits through
    water efficiency. • Farmers lack adequate means to know current on-farm water-efficiency
    levels. • Farmers have weak incentives to make extra efforts for more efficient
    practices. • A knowledge-exchange system is necessary so that stakeholders can
    share responsibility. Abstract Innovative irrigation practices can enhance water
    efficiency, gaining an economic advantage while also reducing environmental burdens.
    In some cases the necessary knowledge has been provided by extension services,
    helping farmers to adapt and implement viable solutions, thus gaining more benefits
    from irrigation technology. Often investment in technological improvements has
    incurred higher water prices, however, without gaining the full potential benefits
    through water efficiency. Farmers generally lack adequate means and incentives
    to know crops’ water use, actual irrigation applications, crops’ yield response
    to different water management practices, and thus current on-farm water-efficiency
    levels. Those general difficulties are illustrated by our two case studies investigating
    options, stimuli and difficulties to improve water-efficient practices. The two
    areas have strong stimuli for improvement but lack a knowledge-exchange system
    to help farmers and resource managers identify scope for improvements. Partly
    for this reason, farmers’ responsibility for efficient water management has been
    displaced to hypothetical prospects, e.g. extra supplies from reuse of treated
    wastewater or a long-term low water pricing. In both cases a displaced responsibility
    complements the default assumption that farmers’ irrigation practices already
    have adequate water-use efficiency. Under current circumstances, agricultural
    water management will maintain the unknown water-efficiency level and farmers
    will have weaker incentives to make efforts for more efficient practices. A continuous
    knowledge-exchange is necessary so that all relevant stakeholders can share greater
    responsibility across the entire water-supply chain. On this basis, more water-efficient
    management could combine wider environmental benefits with economic advantage
    for farmers. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Innovative

    system 1. Introduction Irrigation systems have been under pressure to produce
    more with lower supplies of water. Various innovative practices can gain an economic
    advantage while also reducing environmental burdens such as water abstraction,
    energy use, pollutants, etc. (Faurès and Svendsen, 2007). Farmers can better use
    technological systems already installed, adopt extra technologies, enhance their
    skills in soil and water management, tailor cropping patterns to lower water demand
    and usage, reduce agrochemical inputs, etc. Water-efficient practices potentially
    enhance the economic viability and environmental sustainability of irrigated agriculture,
    without necessarily reducing water usage. To inform such practices, experts have
    developed various models of water efficiency, yet these are little used by farmers.
    Through two case studies in the EU context, this paper will address the following
    questions: • When an irrigation area invests in innovative technology, how can
    its operation help farmers to achieve the full potential benefits together, e.g.
    an economic advantage, greater water-use efficiency and lower resource burdens?
    • Why are innovative technologies often applied in ways which miss the full potential
    benefits? • What tensions arise among various objectives and potential benefits?
    • How can these difficulties be addressed? The paper first surveys analytical
    perspectives on irrigation efficiency – especially the means, incentives and limitations
    – as a basis to analyse two cases and draw general conclusions. 2. Innovative
    irrigation practices: Analytical perspectives Innovative irrigation technology
    is generally promoted as raising water-use efficiency along with multiple benefits,
    but these remain elusive in practice, as outlined in the first sub-section below.
    The limitations have fundamental reasons, as outlined in Section 2.2. To address
    these issues, our case studies are introduced in Section 2.3. 2.1. Practical limitations
    of water-efficient irrigation technology EU policy frameworks place great expectations
    upon technologies to improve water efficiency. The European Commission emphasises
    ‘technological innovation in the field of water, given that water efficiency will
    be an increasingly important factor for competitiveness’ (CEC, 2008). According
    to the European Parliament, solutions should be found in ‘clean technologies that
    facilitate the efficient use of water’ (EP, 2008). Such technological expectations
    arise in expert reports on agricultural water use: Water-efficient irrigation,
    irrigation on demand and irrigation using brackish water are technologies that
    will enable the better husbandry of more scarce freshwater resources. Technological
    developments in respect of irrigation will encompass sensors and communication,
    intelligent watering systems and high-efficiency delivery mechanisms for water
    and nutrients, as well as the means of incorporating all of these elements into
    irrigation ‘packages’ (EIO, 2011: 25). Likewise water efficiency can be enhanced
    by better using current installations and/or by adopting new equipment (WssTP,
    2012: 9). The main European farmers’ organisation has likewise advocated technological
    means to increase water efficiency. In particular this needs ‘investments in more
    efficient irrigation systems, use of new technologies (e.g. soil moisture and
    canopy sensors) to better match irrigation with plant needs, and good agricultural
    practices’, such as conservation tillage, management of soil fertility and water
    retention capacity, and scheduling of irrigation during night to reduce evaporation
    (COPA-COGECA, 2007: 4). The basis for improvement is described as follows: … water
    efficiency measures that provide complementary benefits, such as reduced energy
    needs or other environmental benefits, will also deliver better results. In many
    Member States, efforts are being made to increase the water storage capacity of
    soil under agricultural land use. The modernisation of irrigation systems has
    steadily progressed and water productivity has also improved considerably (COPA-COGECA,
    2013: 3) As indicated above, greater water-use efficiency depends on better agricultural
    practices alongside extra technology. Yet companies generally promote irrigation
    technology as if it inherently brings all the benefits (interview, COPA-COGECA,
    08.07.13). Improperly managed ‘hi-tech’ systems can be as wasteful and unproductive
    as poorly managed traditional systems (Perry et al., 2009). When incorrectly applied,
    irrigation technology ‘can cause losses arising on investments made by farmers,
    thus decreasing the economic water productivity index and the overall sustainability’
    (Battilani, 2012). Beyond a problem-diagnosis of inefficiency, moreover, intensive
    farming practices can degrade soil and water resources, especially through more
    input-intensive farming in crops such as maize, vegetables, orchard and vine cultivation:
    Intensive arable production is partly responsible for poor soil structure, soil
    erosion, loss of soil OM [organic matter] and pollution from fertilisers and pesticides….
    The expansion of maize cropping and the move to growing winter cereals in particular
    have contributed to soil erosion even further (Miller, 2007: 44–45). Such harmful
    practices have been driven and supported by EU policies. In past decades CAP subsidies
    have tended to favour crops with high water demands, such as maize, thus increasing
    the risk of water shortages under climate-uncertain conditions (Garcia-Vila and
    Fereres, 2012). Either as price-support or area-based, CAP subsidies likewise
    have ensured the profitability of some water-intensive crops such as cotton which
    otherwise would be phased out under a market-orientated scenario; likewise water-price
    subsidies. In some cases, water-price increases have induced farmers to adopt
    technology and appropriate practices for conserving water (Caswell and Zilberman,
    1985). Yet water-pricing policies often have been ineffective means to reduce
    water demand (Molle and Berkoff, 2007, Molle, 2008). Farmers experience rising
    water prices as an extra penalty. Rather than higher water prices, administrative
    water allocation or re-allocation lowering the supply often has led farmers to
    adopt water-efficiency practices (Molden et al., 2010). If agricultural water
    demand is inelastic, then policies which encourage changes in cropping patterns
    can be more effective than higher prices (Fraiture and Perry, 2007, Iglesias and
    Blanco, 2008, Kampas, 2012). Inelastic water demand results from farmers’ perspectives
    on water benefits. Water-use efficiency (WUE) and water productivity (WP) are
    often used interchangeably but have different meanings. WUE specifically means
    the ratio of biomass produced per unit of irrigation water used, i.e. the sum
    of transpiration by the crop and evaporation from the soil (Sinclair et al., 1984).
    By contrast, WP means the ratio of above-ground biomass per unit of water transpired
    by the crop (Steduto, 2007). Both terms have relevance to farmers’ economic goals.
    WUE interests mainly the water districts or management agencies, while WP interests
    more farmers and research community. WP better speaks to perspectives linking
    water usage with production levels and economic benefit (interview, COPA-COGECA,
    08.07.13). Yet even WP remains distant from farmers’ perspectives. They generally
    perceive ‘irrigation efficiency’ as maximising net revenue rather than saving
    water (Knox et al., 2012). Policies seek to lower water usage, and river basin
    managers try to allocate limited supplies, yet water-saving is not a priority
    for most farmers (Luquet et al., 2005). They manage labour and other inputs to
    get better economic gains (Molden et al., 2010). Towards that economic aim, most
    growers make irrigation decisions by relying on subjective judgements, based only
    on their practical experience and observation (Knox et al., 2012). Consequently,
    there have been limited benefits from irrigation technology, as well documented
    in the technical literature; the following examples compare various techniques.
    For example, mobile-laboratory evaluations compared the distribution uniformity
    and irrigation efficiency of various irrigation systems in California. Although
    microirrigation systems are seen as ‘efficient technologies’, they were performing
    less well than traditional surface irrigation methods such as furrows and borders.
    To gain the extra benefits of such technology, most important is adequate system
    design, alongside proper installation, operation and maintenance, regardless of
    the irrigation method used (Hanson et al., 1995). Howell (2003) and Irmak et al.
    (2011) reported the attainable application efficiencies for different irrigation
    methods, assuming irrigations are applied to meet the crops’ water needs. Microirrigation
    has the potential to achieve the highest uniformity (90%) in water applied to
    each plant, yet poor uniformity and application efficiency can result from various
    causes, e.g., inadequate maintenance, low inlet pressure or pressure fluctuations,
    emitter clogging and inadequate system design (Hsiao et al., 2007). Consequently,
    microirrigation technology has on-farm efficiencies varying from 0.7 to 0.95 (Howell,
    2003). As another example, a Spanish study compared various irrigation methods
    via the annual relative irrigation supply index (ARIS), i.e. a ratio of water
    applied versus water required. It found a greater efficiency of solid-set and
    drip than surface irrigation. But average annual figures conceal great variations
    in water applied to a given crop and irrigation efficiency at farm level, partly
    for lack of adequate knowledge. A remedy would be ‘actions to improve farmers’
    water management via a combination of irrigation advisory services and policy
    measures’ (Salvador et al., 2011: 586). 2.2. Reasons for those limitations and
    ways to overcome them Given the above water-efficiency limitations in applying
    irrigation technology, the literature has outlined some fundamental reasons. They
    include the following: irrigation equipment is promoted as if the technology per
    se brings various benefits, farmers seek to maximise net income rather than water
    productivity per se, innovative technologies can achieve the full potential benefits
    only through appropriate technical advice, and farmers lack a knowledge-system
    for anticipating effects of specific irrigation practices or for retrospectively
    evaluating their irrigation efficiency. Although research has developed technical
    scheduling procedures to improve agricultural water management, these have been
    little adopted, for many reasons. The one most frequently mentioned by growers
    is the lack of perceived [financial] benefits relative to their current practices,
    which they consider adequate. Ease of use and the expenses involved are also important
    grower considerations (FAO, 2012). Technical advice on irrigation scheduling is
    little used at farm level; at most, it helps retrospectively to evaluate seasonal
    approaches (ibid.). One obstacle is inadequate knowledge about proper irrigation
    levels and scheduling over a growing season. Farmers generally lack adequate assistance
    to develop and adopt better approaches for environmental sustainability, while
    also maintaining their financial and social objectives (Pereira et al., 2012:
    39). For example, sub-surface moisture sensors can improve knowledge about a crop''s
    need for water. But the technology has limitations, so farmers need technical
    advice to interpret the measurements; for example, ‘soil humidity sensors are
    still neither easy to handle nor reliable’ (WssTP, 2012: 33). Moreover, these
    sensors are not well adapted to all soil types; their installation and maintenance
    requires the employment of specialised technical staff. The same is true for the
    canopy sensors, whose proper application is limited to some crops and during specific
    growing stages, periods of day and climatic conditions. Improvements in irrigation
    practices depend on quantitative knowledge of farmers’ current practices in relation
    to actual and potential crop water use: Any effort to improve water use efficiency
    needs to start with the assessment of the actual and attainable efficiencies for
    the given situation, as quantitatively as possible. This information is fundamental
    for making rational improvements aiming at raising the overall efficiency to the
    attainable level (Hsiao et al., 2007: 228, 218). But such information is rarely
    available to farmers. Such difficulties arise for water-management improvements
    through expert systems. Decision Support Systems (DSS) have aimed to improve crop
    water use efficiency at farm and water basin scale, but few are widely applied,
    given the necessary specialised skills. For a DSS to be successful, the key elements
    have been: giving farmers a simple, timely, user friendly, free-of-charge, informative
    system helpful to decide how much to irrigate in everyday practice; tailoring
    the tools for a large number of crops; calculating the irrigation profitability;
    and assessing the economic benefit, especially its relevance to the next irrigation.
    Such benefits have been demonstrated by the Irrinet project in Italy''s Emilia
    Romagna (Battilani, 2012). Thus more reliable information systems and expert capacity
    are necessary to guide farmers in using water more efficiently (Battilani, 2013).
    This exemplifies the broader need for farmer training and education in order to
    improve modern irrigation management. As a way forward in the UK, expert support
    has been recently linking farmers’ responsibility, economic benefits and practical
    knowledge. A ‘pathway to efficiency’ improves the irrigation network, alongside
    better practices of soil and water management, e.g. by monitoring whether the
    right amounts are used at the right place and time. ‘Using financial criteria
    for water efficiency rather than an engineering one appears a sensible approach
    when assessing irrigation performance at the farm level, since any managerial
    (e.g. scheduling) and operational (e.g. equipment) inefficiencies associated with
    irrigation are implicitly included in the assessment’ (Knox et al., 2012: 3).
    In particular, ‘On-farm water auditing and benchmarking have the potential to
    provide useful information to farmer decision making, with respect to identifying
    operational and management changes to improve irrigation system performance and
    water productivity, and evaluating potential investments in new technology (and
    advanced practices) or infrastructures’ (ibid: 7). Such approaches have addressed
    various obstacles to water-efficiency measures. To exploit the full technological
    potential requires a broader dissemination of their benefits, specific training
    of farmers, and coupling properly-designed technological solutions with more precise
    operational practices to benefit farm economic performance (e.g. Tollefson and
    Wahab, 1994). In particular, advisory-extension services have enhanced irrigation
    practices which better fulfil potential benefits of irrigation technology (Hergert
    et al., 1994, Benham et al., 2000, Ahearn et al., 2003, Genius et al., 2014, Parker
    et al., 2000, Gold et al., 2013). Beyond the farm level, greater resource efficiency
    also depends on shared responsibility among stakeholders, according to the World
    Business Council for Sustainable Development: Business undoubtedly has many opportunities
    to increase its eco-efficient performance and thereby to help de-couple use of
    nature from overall economic growth… Establishing framework conditions which foster
    innovation and transparency and which allow sharing responsibility among stakeholders
    will amplify eco-efficiency for the entire economy and deliver progress toward
    sustainability (WBCSD, 2000: 6–7). Analogous issues arise for service-oriented
    irrigation schemes, designed so that farmers can flexibly obtain water at their
    convenience, e.g. through on-demand delivery schedules. Here responsibility has
    institutional complexities. For example, a water users’ organisation (WUO) bears
    largely fixed costs, as well as somewhat variable energy costs from drainage,
    excess water application, reuse, disposal, etc. If a WUO or water district relies
    on gravity-fed water conveyance and delivery systems, then its costs do not vary
    according to water-volume delivery. In such contexts, if farmers decrease water
    use, then the WUO must increase water prices to recover its fixed costs. Facing
    higher water prices, farmers may increase groundwater pumping, thus abstracting
    more water from aquifers, while distancing their individual practices from any
    group responsibility. Paradoxically, fostering greater water-use efficiency can
    generate a financial, environmental and institutional problem. Given those difficulties
    for water-efficient techniques, their effective adoption depends on several enabling
    conditions, especially a policy and institutional context aligning incentives
    of producers, resource managers and society. Significant synergistic effects can
    emerge when water-efficiency practices are combined with other agronomic practices
    such as maintaining soil health and fertility, controlling weeds and avoiding
    diseases (Molden et al., 2010). 2.3. Methods and sources: EcoWater project The
    above issues and earlier questions have been explored through two case studies
    of service-oriented irrigation schemes within a larger EU-funded research project,
    EcoWater (see Acknowledgements). It develops a methodology for assessing eco-efficiency
    at the meso level. The latter is defined as interactions among heterogeneous actors,
    e.g. between water-service users and providers. As generally understood, eco-efficiency
    means a ratio between economic advantage and resource burdens, as a basis to evaluate
    past or potential changes in a system. The project uses eco-efficiency indicators
    to evaluate potential innovative practices including technology adoption. The
    project aims to: assess various options for innovative practices within a specific
    system; analyse the factors influencing decisions to adopt such practices; and
    improve understanding of the socio-technical dynamics that influence such decisions.
    In the project''s two agricultural case studies, farmers and/or their organisations
    have already invested in water-efficient technology, going beyond state subsidy
    alone. The irrigation distribution systems were designed for on-demand water delivery.
    SCADA technology at hydrants allow farmers to abstract water on demand any time
    and charges them according to a volumetric tiered water pricing. Each case-study
    area has strong stimuli for farmers to improve water efficiency, yet the full
    potential benefits of the technology investment were not being realised, for reasons
    analysed in the next two sections. 3. Sinistra Ofanto case Dating from the 1980s,
    the Sinistra Ofanto irrigation scheme is among the largest multi-cropped irrigated
    areas in Italy. It is located in south-eastern Foggia province within the Apulia
    region. Irrigation is crucial for the region''s agricultural production and income,
    but it also generates resource burdens. Nearly 18.5% of Apulia''s agricultural
    area is under irrigation; consequently, irrigated crops have contributed 69% of
    the total value of regional agricultural production, recently quantified as 3.8bn
    Euros (Fabiani, 2010). The entire study area is characterised by a high number
    of small land-holdings with intensive, market-oriented practices. The main crops
    are vineyards, olives, vegetables and fruit orchards (in descending order). The
    pedo-climatic conditions are favourable for intensive cropping, but profitable
    farming is strongly dependent on irrigation, due to the scant rainfall and its
    uneven distribution across the year. The Sinistra Ofanto system commands an area
    of 40,500 ha stretching along the left side of the Ofanto River, of which 38,815
    ha are irrigable lands and 28,165 ha are serviced with irrigation distribution.
    Designed and constructed for pressurised on-demand delivery schedule, the irrigation
    system is managed by a large water users’ organisation (WUO), the Consorzio per
    la Bonifica della Capitanata (CBC, 1984, Altieri, 1995). The system diverts water
    from the Ofanto River and supplies it to growers both by gravity and lifting/pumping,
    ensuring a pressure head of at least 2 bar at each hydrant to enable farmers using
    micro-irrigation methods. The system is already equipped with modern technologies
    to deliver and use water efficiently. From the diversion structure on the Ofanto
    River, water is conveyed to the Capacciotti reservoir through concrete-lined canals
    and pipe conduits, along which the flow regulation devices are downstream-controlled,
    thus manually or automatically adjusted through calibrated control devices enabling
    Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA). The Capacciotti reservoir, supplies
    seven concrete-lined storage and compensation reservoirs equipped with downstream-control
    flow regulation devices that adjust inflows and outflows to feed the district''s
    piped distribution networks based on the downstream water demand. PVC buried pipes
    comprise the open-branched distribution networks. Each sector''s inlet has a control
    unit, equipped with flow and pressure metering-control devices. Water is supplied
    to farms on demand by means of multi-users’ electronically-fed hydrants that control
    and regulate the deliveries, as well as the discharges demanded and thus flowing
    in the pipe distribution network. These technologies installed along the main
    infrastructure help keeping conveyance and distribution losses within 5–10% of
    the total water abstracted from the Ofanto River, as reported by the WUO''s engineering
    staff. Although the main water supply is surface water, during recurrent water
    shortages farmers pump groundwater from medium-depth (100–150 m) aquifers, especially
    since the late 1990s (Portoghese et al., 2013). Furthermore, studies found qualitative
    degradation of groundwater resources, most likely resulting from seawater intrusion
    into the coastal aquifer and to deep percolation of pollutants, such as fertilisers
    and pesticides, from intensive farming activities. Given the urgent need to assess
    these processes and to avoid their adverse environmental impacts, what are the
    prospects for water-efficiency improvements of irrigated agriculture in the Sinistra
    Ofanto area? 3.1. Irrigation patterns and resource burdens The water users organisation
    (WUO), Consorzio per la Bonifica della Capitanata (henceforth the CBC), is the
    main irrigation management agency. It is responsible for all the sequential steps
    along the agriculture water supply chain, i.e. abstraction, conveyance, storage,
    distribution and final water delivery to farm gates. Established in 1933 by a
    national law of public interest, the CBC is by statute a non-profit organisation;
    it bears all the costs for performing its functions, and these costs are recovered
    through the water tariffs paid by farmers. The CBC enforces the principle of solidarity
    among the different service areas. Even though the costs for supplying irrigation
    water differ significantly among areas supplied by gravity and by pumping, the
    tariff structure does not make such a distinction. Rather, as a tool to manage
    water use, water fees vary according to demand: volumetric tiered water tariffs
    progressively increase with the seasonal cumulative volumes withdrawn by each
    farmer. This structure is enforced through individual water metering at the delivery
    points; all farm hydrants are equipped with an electro-mechanical delivery device
    allowing the supply of water only to authorised users and storing information
    of each irrigation event. Besides simplifying the network operations, this technology
    proved to be very useful for accurate monitoring and control of water distribution,
    and for achieving better understanding of the irrigation management practices
    followed by farmers, especially through the possibility to retrieve and analyse
    historical data series (Zaccaria et al., 2013). As an irrigation service provider,
    the CBC is composed of irrigation service users, i.e. farmers. In performing its
    daily activities, the CBC attempts to reconcile objectives which may be in conflict.
    Its technical and administrative choices aim to achieve high water-distribution
    efficiency in order to maximise the economic benefit to farmers. It aims to improve
    water distribution and use—at the farm level, through an effective operation of
    the delivery network, and at field and crop level through the technical support
    to growers aiming at improved water management skills (ibid). Technical support
    to farmers was effective in the 1980s–1990s but has declined in the last decade,
    due to WUO budget constraints and lower revenues from Italy''s farm activities.
    Irrigation water demand is driven mainly by farmers’ perceptions, by the climatic
    conditions, and by the economic value of crop yields and production factors. Even
    beyond periods of water shortage, in some areas farmers pump groundwater in order
    to avoid the following problems: (i) the restricted-flow demand delivery-schedule
    that prevents the quick completion of irrigation cycles in medium-large farms,
    (ii) the restricted-frequency demand-delivery often imposed by the CBC during
    water shortage periods, (iii) the need to arrange water withdrawals with neighbour
    farmers supplied by the same hydrants, or (iv) the tiered water fees enforced
    by the CBC. Also, many farmers still perceive groundwater pumping as somewhat
    cheaper than water supplied by the CBC, even though the contrary was shown by
    economic analyses (e.g. Portoghese et al., 2013). As a more fundamental problem,
    both the farmers’ perception and the CBC''s analyses ignore the ecological costs
    of groundwater degradation and remediation. The CBC accepts no responsibility
    for water-management practices beyond the farm gate. From the growers’ standpoint,
    groundwater pumping aims to increase and/or stabilise the economic benefits of
    farming activities. Often farmers combine surface water and groundwater for various
    reasons such as to maximise crop yields and farm net benefit, or to minimise the
    seasonal water fees payable to the CBC, or to prevent yield reduction arising
    from high salinity in the groundwater during peak-demand periods. However, this
    conjunctive use of surface and groundwater is based solely on farmers’ economic
    and technical considerations, regardless of environmental burdens such as aquifer
    depletion and degradation. Furthermore, fields close to the river banks are often
    irrigated by growers with water pumped out the river. In all these situations,
    return flows may result from run-off through the drainage networks, as well as
    from percolation through the soil profile, finally reaching the downstream reaches
    of the river, wetlands or the aquifer. Farm activities generate various pressures
    on land and water resources, including quantitative depletion and qualitative
    degradation, especially biodiversity loss in farmland and in the natural environment.
    This harm has several sources: (i) intensive farming and tillage practices, (ii)
    fertilisers and pesticides application on cultivated fields, (iii) water abstraction
    from the Ofanto River, (iv) return flows of degraded water to downstream wetlands
    and aquifers, (v) over-drafting of groundwater, (vi) salinity build-up in cultivated
    soils, (vii) energy consumption for water pumping, and (viii) increased CO2 emissions
    from the energy usage related to pumping, transport, machinery, etc. Relative
    to those ecological problems, much greater impetus for innovative practices comes
    from recurrent scarcity of water supply and the prospect of even greater future
    scarcity and uncertainty. Those problems in turn result from high water-demanding
    crops and from irrigation scheduling practices. Such decisions are often based
    solely on farmers’ perceptions; their systems and practices are not monitored
    to assess the actual performance and efficiency achievements. No systematic technical
    support is available to growers for their daily or seasonal irrigation planning
    and scheduling. Moreover there is detailed evidence of water-use inefficiency
    at farm level. According to a study of farmers’ irrigation practices in a nearby
    irrigated area with similar features, there were often mis-matches between crops’
    water demand and irrigation applications on several occasions during the season.
    Although the overall seasonal applied irrigation depths may match a crop''s water
    demand, farmers often under-irrigate during the early crop stages and over-irrigate
    during later stages; many choose inadequate timings and application depths. Such
    inadequate applications may be combined with uneven in-field water distribution,
    often due to the average low uniformity of irrigation systems—especially when
    not properly designed, evaluated and maintained; consequently, the farm may have
    up to 20% lower crop yields and income, along with inefficiencies between 20 and
    40% due to excessive water applications (Zaccaria et al., 2010). As the main reason
    for the mismatch, irrigation scheduling practices are based only on farmers’ perceptions
    and experiences; missing is status monitoring of soil or plant water, use of ET-based
    irrigation scheduling, or any other quantitative techniques (ibid). This study
    confirms a general problem of water-inefficient practices, as also found in the
    wider technical literature (e.g. Hanson et al., 1995, Hanson et al., 1996, Burt,
    2004, Salvador et al., 2011; see Section 1). 3.2. Innovative practices for stakeholders’
    consideration Resource-efficiency could be enhanced by properly utilising several
    innovative technologies and practices. As listed in Table 1, several feasible
    options are already installed and implemented in the Sinistra Ofanto area, i.e.
    along the water conveyance and distribution system or on some progressive farms,
    but require either some refinements or significant operational improvements to
    gain their full economic and environmental benefits. Table 1. Technologies, impacts

    service Investment costs for the installed technologies were paid by the WUO either
    from budget surpluses (in years when water demand and delivery were high), or
    by funds obtained from different sources, and by some individual farmers at the
    farm level. Their maintenance and operational costs are paid by growers within
    the regular water fees. The improved irrigation methods, systems and practices
    are implemented only to a small extent by some farmers. The first two technologies
    were recently installed along the distribution networks to ease operation and
    flow control, and thus increase its efficiency, but they still need further testing
    and tune-ups to fully exploit their potential. For example, multi-user hydrants
    could be hooked up with soil moisture sensors or plant–water status sensors to
    schedule irrigation applications on the basis of needed or user-defined thresholds
    and frequency. Also, they could be set to cease water withdrawals and irrigation
    when the pressure-head values at delivery are insufficient to achieve the target
    level of efficiency and distribution uniformity. Moreover, relevant datasets from
    the field (on irrigation timings, flow rates, pressure heads, volume and duration)
    could be automatically transmitted to a central WUO workstation, thus easing the
    data-gathering necessary for billing farmers, for evaluating the irrigation delivery
    service provided and growers’ irrigation scheduling practices. These further adjustments
    of the available technologies could also enable the performance evaluation and
    benchmarking of irrigation at on-farm and project level. As indicated by those
    examples, upgraded technologies alone do not ensure the anticipated resource-
    efficiency improvements. Compared to less technology-intensive systems, the past
    investments incur extra costs but bring uncertain gains. The full potential benefits
    depend on adequate management practices, in turn dependent on better expertise,
    skill-gap assessment, auditing monitoring and evaluation, control systems and
    extension programmes, including mission-oriented research and outreach. The above
    technology options (in Table 1) were presented at the EcoWater project workshop,
    held in the case study area and attended by diverse stakeholders involved in the
    Sinistra Ofanto water-system value chain. These included: the River Basin Authority,
    the WUO, the Apulia Regional Administration, the regional Department of Water
    Resources, the Ente Irrigazione, ARPA Puglia, CNR-IRSA (Water Research Institute),
    University of Bari, etc. Stakeholders, decision-makers and experts were asked
    to share their visions about water management in the area. The discussion identified
    several issues, emphasising the need for measures to protect groundwater. As many
    comments there highlighted, in the last three decades contradictory interests
    have generated conflicts over water allocation and use. Surface-water availability
    for agricultural use has been reduced by several factors: expansion of the command
    areas, incentivised partly by irrigation systems and by regional policies; greater
    water demands of the municipal, industrial and tourist sectors; and adverse environmental-climatic
    changes. Participants mentioned several solutions, in particular: monitoring and
    control of water use should be strengthened throughout the Apulia region, especially
    in the study area, in order to avoid aquifer over-exploitation and uncontrolled
    withdrawals from water courses; deficit irrigation management, already practiced
    in the study area by some innovative growers, offers a feasible option to enhance
    water-use efficiency and productivity; and, finally, farmers should share their
    personal experiences and knowledge in order to help others to use irrigation water
    in a sustainable and efficient way (reported in Ecowater, 2013). In addition,
    CBC (local WUO) representatives emphasised the importance of using non-conventional
    water sources as an additional supply, especially the re-use of treated wastewater
    (TWW) as a valid alternative to aquifer exploitation for irrigation purposes.
    TWW re-use has several barriers: stringent quality criteria set by regulations
    for water reuse in agriculture; the high cost of treatment and water conveyance
    from the treatment plants to agricultural areas; and inadequate research dissemination,
    even disinformation; and reluctance by farmers. Consequently, TWW re-use should
    be fostered by several means – lowering the water-quality restrictions, installing
    the latest technologies available on the market for wastewater treatment to reduce
    costs of treatment plants, and broadly disseminating research findings to growers,
    especially through extension activities and farmers’ advisers – according to the
    WUO representatives (reported in Ecowater, 2013). No stakeholder raised concerns
    about aquifer characterisation, safe-yield assessment, groundwater recharge or
    agrochemicals’ fate in soil and aquifers, or farm-level performance assessment
    of agricultural water management practices. As emerged during the stakeholder
    discussion, some future visions may be based on doubtful assumptions. In particular
    the CBC staff and farmers’ representatives assumed that Sinistra Ofanto farmers
    already achieve high irrigation and water-use efficiency, simply on grounds that
    they use microirrigation methods. From this assumption, there would be little
    scope or incentive to growers for further improvement in farm-level water management.
    From CBC technical reports over at least a decade, no recent information is available
    on whether the farm irrigation systems are properly designed, installed, operated
    and maintained—nor on whether irrigations are adequately scheduled and conducted
    by growers. Likewise the WUO has not recently fostered irrigation systems evaluations
    regarding the actual application efficiency and distribution uniformity achieved
    by growers, or WUE/WP for the various crops and irrigation methods, on the basis
    of quantitative measurements. Agricultural extension activities have been significantly
    limited in the last decade by budget constraints. So the CBC lacks an empirical
    basis for its efficiency assumptions about current performance of on-farm water
    management. In all those ways, the CBC''s practical responsibility ends at the
    farm gate. Moreover, responsibility for water-supply problems is displaced onto
    public-sector agencies, especially for additional water supplies via wastewater
    reuse. This option is simpler and perhaps more profitable for farmers and the
    CBC, especially if public bodies carry the main financial burden. Water reuse
    involves complex issues needing careful investigation and management, in particular:
    different water qualities may be required, contingent on the final water uses.
    Water that needs to be buffered or stored for seasonal reuse (e.g. groundwater
    banking or surface storage) may have other quality requirements than water used
    for a direct agricultural reuse. And there are potential risks to health and environment
    (WssTP, 2013: 19–20). 4. Monte Novo case In Portugal''s Alentejo the Monte Novo
    irrigation perimeter provides abundant water for a rising number of farmers, served
    by the larger Alqueva reservoir and irrigation project. Dating from 2009, the
    scheme set initially low water prices to incentivise irrigation by farmers—but
    without their involvement in discussing implications for crop choices, irrigation
    practices, farming profitability and expected income. The highly-discounted water
    price has incentivised crops with high water demands as well as agrochemical inputs,
    thus creating pollution problems. As mandated by law, the water price will rise
    significantly towards full-cost recovery by 2017, thus potentially stimulating
    practices which need less water. What are the prospects for water efficiency improvements?
    4.1. Irrigation patterns and future price rise Since the 1960s Portugal has had
    plans to irrigate relatively arid areas of the Alentejo, especially to increase
    employment and livelihoods. Spain''s 1993 National Hydrologic Plan was proposing
    to abstract more of the shared water from the adjoining region, partly on grounds
    that Portugal was not using the water, but Portugal objected. To avoid such trans-border
    conflicts, the 1998 Albufeira Convention aimed to protect freshwater and groundwater,
    as well as the sustainable use of shared water resources, in the context of the
    negotiation process for the Water Framework Directive (Maia, 2000, Pulwarty and
    Maia, 2013). Under the Convention, for example, Spain guarantees annual stream
    flows to Portugal in normal years (Costa, 2003). The Albufeira Convention facilitated
    Portugal''s Alqueva Multipurpose Project—the Empreendimento de Fins Múltiplos
    de Alqueva (EFMA). The EU Structural Funds were expected to pay more than half
    the investment cost (Vergés, 2001). The 1993 EFMA plan combined a reservoir, hydroelectric
    dam and irrigation networks, thereby helping to justify Portugal''s claim on the
    water. The project aimed to promote the development of a poor, deprived region
    through irrigated agriculture, electricity production and tourism. Together these
    were meant to ensure the sustainability of the project in its early phase (Santos
    et al., 2011). From the start the EFMA was criticised as a hydrodinosaur—for accepting
    engineers’ assumptions about future water needs, requiring enormous electricity
    to transport water and so raising the full cost (Costa, 2003). Before EFMA''s
    operation, maize production had greatly risen alongside greater dependence on
    CAP subsidies for economic viability. The Agriculture Minister hoped that the
    Alqueva would irrigate industrial crops such as tomato and sugar beet (Vergés,
    2001: 7). By using cheap water from the Alqueva dam, some Alentejo farmers were
    expecting to capture greater payments from the CAP 1st pillar. So they opposed
    mid-term reforms decoupling such payments from production levels; so did the Portuguese
    government (Costa, 2003: 26). According to its promoters, the Alqueva system will
    foster significant regional development in Alentejo, both in social and economic
    terms, due to the strategic water reserve and the associated hydraulic infrastructures.
    The main objective is to guarantee an adequate volume and quality of water to
    users, especially irrigation water. Further objectives include the energy hydropower
    production, urban water supply, ecological conservation and recreational uses
    (EDIA, 2011). With its geographical topography and high elevation, the Alqueva
    scheme was an expensive investment (Costa, 2003), especially relative to the small
    number of farmers who initially joined the scheme. This arrangement resulted in
    a high unit cost for the water supply. This has high political-economic stakes,
    given that full-cost recovery of irrigation systems is required by the Water Framework
    Directive (EC, 2000). Irrigation delivery service is provided by the public company
    EDIA (Empresa para o Desenvolvimento das Infraestruturas de Alqueva), the agency
    responsible for the Alqueva project development and exploitation. Water is abstracted
    from the Alqueva reservoir and transported through a network of canals and ducts,
    from primary network to secondary network through hydrants to farmers. Within
    the larger Alqueva project, the Monte Novo irrigation perimeter is located in
    Alentejo district, near Évora municipality. The perimeter provides water for irrigation
    to an area of at least 7800 ha, while the Alqueva Project will have a total 115,000
    ha expected capacity by 2015. In the Guadiana region including Monte Novo, the
    tertiary sector has 76% of gross value added (GVA) and 67% of employment; the
    most important sources are tourist accommodation, catering and public services.
    The agricultural sector has 10% of the region''s GVA and about 15% of the jobs;
    average farm size is large (55 ha). These characteristics, associated with the
    high proportion of farmers in a company structure, indicate the region''s high
    potential to develop agricultural activities, especially with the full operation
    of the Alqueva project. But its agricultural activities have a very low competitiveness
    and a low productivity per unit area; incomes are greatly supported by public
    subsidies, which comprise about 65% of the total gross margin (ARH-Alentejo, 2011).
    In the study area, the major irrigated crops are olives, maize, arable crops (mostly
    pasture) and horticultures (mostly tomatoes). Farm size ranges from less than
    50 ha to more than 500 ha. The largest areas belong to important multi-crop farms,
    such as the ones owned by the Fundação Eugénio de Almeida (FEA), or the olive
    farms owned by Olivais do Sul (ODS); together they comprise more than 30% of the
    irrigated area in Monte Novo irrigation perimeter. Fertilisers and pesticides
    are applied to all crops, especially tomatoes and maize. Greater irrigation stimulates
    run-off, leach-outs of fertilisers and pesticides and soil erosion. Together these
    practices reduce soil organic matter, soil fertility and its capacity to retain
    water, in turn increasing potential irrigation inefficiencies and need for better
    water management for the same cultivation level as before. Indeed, land degradation
    and nutrient depletion significantly constrain opportunities to increase water
    efficiency (Molden et al., 2010, IST, 2013). In 2009 the WUO Associação de Beneficiários
    de Monte Novo (henceforth ABMN) was established, representing all farmers connected
    to the Alqueva water distribution system from EDIA. According to the regulatory
    Decree Law 84/82, the Association has formal recognition by the Ministry of Agriculture,
    Trade and Fisheries. The ABMN has the role to promote the administration of constructing
    the hydro-agricultural development. Nonetheless EDIA has carried out the management
    and operation of the irrigation perimeter, as well as the investments in constructing
    the irrigation network. Water prices are differentiated according to the pressure
    heads provided at farm-gate delivery. Prices are lower in low-pressure blocks,
    where water is conveyed and distributed by gravity, generally to larger farmers;
    irrigation inside farms is within farmers’ management. Prices are higher in high-pressure
    blocks, which are supplied by pumping stations; these reduce the need for farmers
    to bear the costs of farm-level booster pumps. However, in the high-pressure blocks
    some large farms need their own investment in irrigation equipment and distribution
    infrastructures. In some cases farmers already invested in important irrigation
    infrastructures prior to the construction of the Monte Novo irrigation perimeter.
    In both cases a higher water price is imposed on important farmers who will not
    necessarily benefit from higher pressure heads at hydrants (Rita and Capelo, 2005).
    Moreover, the difference in water prices between low-pressure and high-pressure
    blocks is insufficient for covering the necessary investments for constructing
    the main irrigation infrastructures within low-pressure farms’ areas, as well
    as the corresponding exploitation costs, mainly energy and maintenance (Froes
    and Rodrigues, 2005). Given those high costs, full-cost recovery would impede
    a full transition from rain-fed to irrigated agriculture. To attract farmers into
    the scheme, a 2010 law set the initial water price at only 30% of full cost. This
    initial price shifts more of the total cost onto the supplier, while incentivising
    maize cultivation, which demands relatively large amount of water but gains a
    higher market price. According to the ABMN (Monte Novo''s WUO), the discount price
    gives farmers ‘a certain hope’, but many have difficulties to obtain credit, which
    is necessary for farm-level investment to electrify the cultivated zones (Silva,
    2010). As originally set by law, the low water price will be increased by 10%
    per year towards full-cost recovery by 2017 (Nuncio and Arranja, 2011). This legislative
    requirement has become contentious. At its full-cost price, water would comprise
    13% of the total cost of maize production. Through their WUOs, farmers have been
    lobbying the authorities to delay the price rise. According to the Federação das
    Associações de Agricultores do Baixo Alentejo (regional federation of farmers’
    associations), the higher price will not allow farmers to be economically competitive,
    especially for a large proportion of maize cultivation, estimated as more than
    36,000 tonnes aimed at export markets. According to the former Agriculture Minister,
    however, the higher price will be competitive with nearby regions, as an adequate
    basis for more farmers to join the scheme (Maneta, 2010, Rosado, 2012). The future
    increase could stimulate water-conserving measures and alternative cropping patterns
    which would be more profitable and/or need less water, while also reducing other
    resource burdens. But continuous support measures would be necessary for growers
    to evaluate and implement such options. 4.2. Innovative practices for stakeholders’
    consideration The on-demand water-delivery system was meant to incentivise water-efficient
    practices by farmers and thus to reconcile tensions between various objectives
    of the Alqueva project. Such a strategy put great expectations upon a technological
    system. At the irrigation-perimeter level the eventual implementation of innovative
    practices is meant to be supported by the ABMN (WUO), with investment costs if
    necessary to be covered from budget surpluses. On the other hand, the farm-level
    water-use improvements are dependent on farmers’ own investment or eventually
    on government subsidies fostering efficiency increases. Some technologies have
    been applied at farm level, e.g. sub-surface irrigation at FEA and ODS farms,
    but only to a small extent. Buried drip-irrigation systems need even more careful
    design, monitoring and operation than surface-drip or other micro-irrigation systems.
    Beyond the technological investment, greater application would depend on applied
    research, demonstration activities, outreach, farmers’ training and skills development.
    The study team assessed various options for lowering input demands (of energy,
    water, agrochemicals) or for increasing farmers’ income per unit water used (Ecowater,
    2012), in two main categories as follows. At the irrigation perimeter level, i.e.
    the distribution network: • tiered volumetric water tariffs according to actual
    water use by growers; • tiered water tariffs according to timing of withdrawals
    and energy costs, e.g. lower rates at night-time; and • pressure head delivery.
    And at the farm level: • drip irrigation, reducing water evaporation (especially
    relevant to maize); • sub-surface drip irrigation, minimising soil evaporation
    and facilitating mechanical weed-control or conservation tillage or minimum-tillage
    methods (especially relevant to vineyards); • super-high density olive orchards;
    • variable-irrigation practices, e.g. through regulated deficit irrigation; and
    • alternative crops demanding less water. The study team presented the above options
    at an April 2012 workshop. It was attended by representatives and experts from
    relevant local bodies. They included: EDIA, farmers’ representatives (FEA and
    ODS), the ABMN (WUO), ARH-Alentejo, and the Centro Operativo de Tecnologia do
    Regadio (COTR), an advisory body for scientific research regarding agricultural
    development. Stakeholders’ comments converged around the following points: • All
    the proposed technologies could add value to the Alqueva scheme. • Farmers are
    interested in any technological configuration that might increase their profit
    margins, which are currently low. • Given the high investment costs of the irrigation
    scheme, a successful operation is important in order to lower the unit cost of
    water through access to more growers (Ecowater, 2013). Discussion focused on the
    knowledge lacking for farmers to minimise irrigation intensity and to conserve
    soil resources. In particular participants made these comments: • Irrigation intensity
    must remain within the carrying capacity of the soil (infiltration rate and water-holding
    capacity), especially in order to prevent surface run-off, leach-outs and erosion—significant
    environmental impacts that must be taken into consideration. • Without adequate
    knowledge for such judgements, farmers may intensify resource usage, thus increasing
    costs, leach-outs and soil erosion. • Root-zone soil moisture conditions are not
    measured to identify in-field variability and vulnerable areas, so most farmers
    base decisions on their past experience and daily observations of farm conditions.
    • Although a network of meteorological stations already exist in the area, relevant
    information is not available for irrigation planning and scheduling purposes;
    farmers’ access is still under development (Ecowater, 2013). Regarding the above
    point about the soil''s water-capacity, a COTR expert emphasised soil organic
    carbon (SOC) as an environmental indicator and objective. Greater irrigation flows
    undermine the soil''s capacity to retain water and nutrients, while also increasing
    GHG emissions. SOC conservation is more difficult for annual arable crops than
    for permanent pasture. To avoid further SOC loss and to enhance its role, farmers
    could incorporate crop residues into the soil and/or choose crops which need less
    irrigation and chemical inputs. Before any technological change, decision-makers
    should evaluate the implications for SOC, he argued. This issue was not taken
    up by other stakeholders at the workshop. The workshop discussion also considered
    whether the cultivation of organic crops could be an alternative option, along
    with bio-labelling to gain a higher market price. According to the ODS representative,
    farmers would use organic cultivation methods if they could be convinced that
    their profit would increase. But owners of small farms would not be easily convinced
    (Ecowater, 2013). Indeed, small-scale growers lack an advisory service and systematic
    support for linking organic methods with higher-value markets. This institutional
    gap illustrates wider difficulties for farmers adjusting to new challenges and
    gaining the full potential benefits of the EFMA. 5. Discussion and conclusions
    Innovative irrigation practices can enhance water efficiency, gaining an economic
    advantage for farmers while also reducing environmental burdens. Water-efficient
    methods and better irrigation scheduling could also integrate water and nutrient
    management, thus minimising agrochemical runoff and leaching problems. To help
    fulfil this potential, experts have developed various models of water efficiency
    and environmental benefits. Yet these models are little used for irrigation scheduling;
    at most, they help retrospectively to evaluate seasonal approaches (FAO, 2012).
    In that generally adverse context, our two case studies of irrigation schemes
    investigated options, stimuli and difficulties to improve water-efficient practices.
    In both cases, individual farmers and/or their organisations already made significant
    investments in irrigation technologies, but their implementation has not been
    systematically evaluated for effectiveness through better knowledge—regarding
    crops’ water use, soil-moisture conditions, irrigation scheduling techniques,
    crops’ yield response to different irrigation management strategies, etc. Farmers
    there have no formal responsibility to demonstrate efficient water use (unlike
    in the UK; Knox et al., 2012). Consequently, farmers pay higher water prices yet
    do not obtain the full potential benefits through water-efficient practices. Reasons
    why have been investigated by exploring perspectives of water users organisations
    (WUOs) and relevant agencies, especially through multi-stakeholder workshops.
    The two cases have strong stimuli for more water-efficient practices. In the Sinistra
    Ofanto case, a main stimulus is the prospect of greater water scarcity and erratic
    supply, leading some farmers to rely on groundwater, which may progressively become
    more scarce, over-drafted, more expensive due to higher pumping costs, degraded
    and/or saline. In the Monte Novo case, a water-abundant system, a main stimulus
    is the statutory rise in water price towards full-cost recovery; this would weaken
    the commercial viability of some crops with high water demand, such as current
    maize cultivation. Anticipating such future difficulties, stakeholders have discussed
    options for better practices. In each area, stakeholder representatives attended
    our project workshop on how farmers’ economic advantage could be combined with
    environmental benefits. Despite the stimuli for more water-efficient practices,
    however, actors’ responsibility has been somewhat displaced onto hypothetical
    prospects. In particular, for the two areas: At the Sinistra Ofanto workshop,
    stakeholder representatives emphasised problems of water scarcity and aquifer
    salinity. Their comments suggested various possible measures such as region-wide
    control and regulation, farm-level practices and farmers’ knowledge-exchange systems.
    At the same time, however, the WUO displaced responsibility onto the prospect
    of additional supply from wastewater reuse; this would depend on significant institutional,
    policy and technical changes, with an uncertain timescale and cost. At the Monte
    Novo workshop, stakeholder representatives expressed interest in farm-level technological
    improvements which could improve water efficiency. Yet WUO representatives also
    emphasised the need to maintain a low unit cost of water. Moreover, the WUO publicly
    advocates a longer-term low water pricing, which would depend on a legislative
    change contradicting the country''s EU obligations and the original mandate for
    the irrigation scheme. In both cases responsibility is displaced, thus complementing
    WUOs’ and farmers’ assumption that their agricultural water management practices
    already have adequate efficiency. This attitude arises by default—from seeing
    no systematic means or incentive for more water-efficient practices, beyond the
    modern technologies already adopted. Experts generally have sought to overcome
    such obstacle through better models of evapotranspiration and efficient water
    use (e.g. Pereira et al., 2012). Yet such models cannot reconcile stakeholders’
    different understandings of irrigation efficiency: farmers seek to maximise their
    economic benefits, while water experts or agencies seek to conserve water (Knox
    et al., 2012). Therefore a solution would need a continuous knowledge-exchange
    with three components: i. expert scientific knowledge of crops’ water needs, their
    yield-response to water and the actual on-farm versus attainable efficiency (Hsiao
    et al., 2007); ii. links between farmers’ perspectives, innovative practices and
    their income benefits (Knox et al., 2012); and iii. means to lower resource burdens
    from inputs and pollutants (Miller, 2007). Relative to such a solution, our two
    case-study areas have a nominal extension service which lacks the necessary resources,
    expertise and operational capability in agricultural water management; these services
    have no external auditing. A knowledge-exchange system does not exist in those
    areas, so farmers may miss the full potential benefits of the technological investment
    already adopted. Under current circumstances, irrigation practices will maintain
    the unknown efficiency level; along with their WUOs, farmers will have weak capacities
    to make extra efforts for more water-efficient practices, as well as weak incentives
    to pay for any further investments. An adequate knowledge-exchange system would
    depend on greater institutional responsibility for water-related policies and
    strategies, for example, through an extension service or a functional equivalent
    through a WUO. This in turn would provide an enabling condition and incentive
    for all relevant stakeholders (especially WUOs) to share greater responsibility
    for agricultural water management across the entire water-supply chain, including
    farm-level practices as well as drainage and leach-out management. On this basis,
    more water-efficient practices could combine wider environmental benefits with
    economic advantage for farmers. Acknowledgements This work was supported by the

    water deficits and deteriorating environmental quality are threatening agricultural
    sustainability in the North China Plain (NCP). This paper addresses spatial and
    temporal availability of water resources in the NCP, identifies the effects of
    soil management, irrigation timing and amounts, and crop genetic improvement on
    water use efficiency (WUE), and then discusses knowledge gaps and research priorities
    to further improve WUE. Enhanced irrigation and soil nutrient (mainly nitrogen)
    management are the focal issues in the NCP for enhancing WUE, which are shown
    to increase WUE by 10–25% in a wheat–maize double cropping system. Crop breeding
    has also contributed to increased of WUE and is expected to play an important
    role in the future as genetic and environmental interactions are understood better.
    Agricultural system models and remote sensing have been used to evaluate and improve
    current agronomic management practices for increasing WUE at field and regional
    scales. The low WUE in farmer''s fields compared with well-managed experimental
    sites indicates that more efforts are needed to transfer water-saving technologies
    to the farmers. We also identified several knowledge gaps for further increasing
    WUE in the NCP by: (1) increasing scientific understanding of the effects of agronomic
    management on WUE across various soil and climate conditions; (2) quantifying
    the interaction between soil water and nitrogen in water-limited agriculture for
    improving both water and nitrogen-use efficiency; (3) improving irrigation practices
    (timing and amounts) based on real-time monitoring of water status in soil-crop
    systems; and (4) maximizing regional WUE by managing water resources and allocation
    at regional scales. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Water

    China Plain 1. Introduction The North China Plain (NCP) is also known as Yellow-Huai-Hai
    Plain named after the three major rivers (Yellow River, Huai River and Hai River)
    that traverse it (Fig. 1), and is the most important wheat and maize production
    area in China. It produces about 29.6% of the nation''s food, including about
    half of the wheat production and a third of the maize production (NBSC, 1998).
    The main cropping system is wheat and maize double cropping (two crops per year)
    with average water consumptions of about 450 mm for wheat and 360 mm for maize
    (Liu et al., 2001). Due to a summer monsoon climate with about 70–80% of the mean
    annual rainfall (550 mm) concentrated in the summer (July to September), the rainfall
    during wheat growth period can only meet 25–40% of the crop water requirement,
    which leaves a 200–300 mm water deficit in the northern part of the NCP (Liu et
    al., 2001, Zhang et al., 2006b). Irrigation is critical for maintaining high wheat
    yield, especially in the northern part of the NCP, and about 75% of the agricultural
    land is irrigated and consumes 70–80% of the total water resource allocation in
    the NCP (Lin et al., 2000). In the recent years, however, increased water deficits
    associated with overuse of surface water, declining groundwater levels, water
    pollution, and soil salinization are threatening the sustainability of agricultural
    production in the region (Hu et al., 2005, Liu et al., 2001, Wang et al., 2007a).
    The water supply for agricultural production will unavoidably decrease with the
    increasing demands from domestic and industrial water users. At the same time,
    the agricultural water use efficiency is still very low due to the poor irrigation
    management practices (Deng et al., 2006, Wang et al., 2002) and lack of investment
    in infrastructure (Lohmar et al., 2003, Xu, 2001). Furthermore, recent studies
    showed that climate change could greatly influence the water cycle and aggravate
    the water crisis situation in the NCP (Tao et al., 2003, Tao et al., 2005, Xiong
    et al., 2009). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. The North China Plain
    (NCP), provinces, rivers and the experimental sites (*) for studying water use
    efficiency in the region. System-wide water saving can be obtained by reducing
    unnecessary evapotranspiration (ET) and increasing crop water use efficiency (WUE).
    Although seepage during water transmission and deep drainage are of concern during
    peak demand, these irrigation losses recharge the shallow aquifer and do not leave
    the NCP system permanently (Kendy et al., 2004), even though energy is required
    to pump it up. WUE can be calculated at the single leaf level (leaf photosynthesis
    rate/leaf transpiration rate), canopy level (crop biomass/ET), field level (crop
    yield/ET) or regional level (crop yield/water available) (McVicar et al., 2002,
    Sinclair et al., 1984, Wang, 1993). Precision irrigation practices and soil and
    crop management can be used to improve WUE at these different levels, and the
    interactions among these management practices are also very important for regional
    water resource management in the NCP (Table 1). Wang et al. (2002) and Deng et
    al. (2006) reviewed water-saving agriculture in China by focusing on agronomic
    options, and Kang et al., 2004a, Kang et al., 2004b discussed the technology and
    theory of agricultural and ecological water-saving engineering. Other recent reviews
    on improving WUE in a comprehensive way under water limited conditions are the
    molecular plant breeding and agronomic management for high WUE (Passioura, 2006),
    generic principles for improving WUE at different scales (Bouman, 2007), improvement
    of irrigation methods to reduce water demand and negative environmental impacts
    at farm level (Pereira et al., 2002), and sustainable management of available
    water resources at global, regional, and site-specific levels (Qadir et al., 2003).
    Steduto et al. (2007) demonstrated the conservative behavior of biomass water
    productivity defined as biomass/transpiration, and methods for scaling water productivity
    from leaf to regional scales. Water productivity defined by Kassam and Smith (2001)
    can be quantified in terms of yield, nutritional value or economic return. The
    WUE used here was defined as the ratio of grain yield to ET at a field scale unless
    otherwise specified, which has the same meaning as water productivity in terms
    of grain yield per unit ET. In this paper, we first analyze the current water
    resources (surface and ground water resources) situation in the NCP and associated
    agricultural water use, and then assess the current status of scientific research
    on agronomic management practices for improving WUE in the NCP. Finally, the knowledge
    gaps in agronomic management and future research needs for enhancing WUE are discussed.

    status in the NCP Water resources in the NCP are scarce with uneven distributions
    both spatially and temporally, which makes it difficult to achieve efficient water
    utilization (Liu and Wei, 1989). The surface water resources in the NCP are mainly
    from surface runoff locally in the NCP and from the adjacent mountainous regions.
    The Yellow river is an important surface water resource in the area. On average
    across the region, the annual runoff in the NCP is about 126 mm (17.9%) for an
    annual rainfall of 704 mm and the rest is lost as evportranspration (ET) (Liu
    and Wei, 1989). The average annual discharge fraction (ratio of runoff to rainfall)
    varies from 11% in the northern part (north Yellow river) to 22% in the southern
    part (south Yellow river). The coefficient of variation in runoff across years
    is high, increasing from 0.20 in north to 0.35 in south. The average annual surface
    runoff in the three river basins is 3.82 × 1010 m3 with a decrease from south
    (Huai River basin) to north (Hai River and Yellow River basins) (Fig. 2), which
    is only 1.5% of national surface water resource (Liu and Wei, 1989). Discharge
    from the mountain regions comprises 48% of surface water within the three river
    basins. The highest runoff from mountain areas occurred in the Hai River basin
    (Fig. 2). Water abstraction from the Yellow River is about 47%, which is higher
    than other rivers in China. The annual water flow in the downstream reaches of
    the Yellow River is 4.56 × 1010 m3 (within the NCP), of which about 20% is used
    for agricultural and industrial production in the river basin (Liu and Wei, 1989).
    Because the Yellow River basin is the second-largest river basin in China and
    contributes greatly to agricultural and socioeconomic development, many studies
    have been carried out to analyze and evaluate water resources in this river basin
    (Cai and Rosegrant, 2004, Liu and Xia, 2004). Some studies showed that water scarcity
    and longer period of ‘no flow’ days have become more severe (Barnett et al., 2006,
    Liu and Xia, 2004, Zhang et al., 2009). Also, an increase in air temperature has
    been observed, with decreased precipitation/runoff in the river basin in the last
    50 years (Fu et al., 2004, Yang et al., 2004, Zhang et al., 2009). Due to the
    high sediment deposition under low water flows in the river, the rising river
    bed has increased the threat of flooding in the lower reaches (Wang et al., 2005a,
    Yu, 2002). The associated environmental problems also showed high sensitivity
    to climatic change and human activities (Zhang et al., 2009). Maintaining a reasonable
    flow in the Yellow river is becoming one of the highest priorities for ecological
    water requirement as argued by Barnett et al. (2006) and Webber et al. (2008).

    in 108 m3) averaged from 1956 to 1979 across the three river basins (Huai, Huang
    (Yellow), and Hai rivers from south to north) in the North China Plain (adapted
    from Liu and Wei, 1989) (For interpretation of the references to colour in this
    figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of the article.). Estimates
    of groundwater resources differ depending on the definition of the aquifer boundary
    and estimation methods (Fei, 1988, Liu and Wei, 1989). Fresh groundwater resources
    generally increase from south to north and from piedmont areas to coastal areas.
    Among the three river basins (Yellow River, Huai River and Hai River), fresh shallow
    ground water resources are abundant in the Huai River basin (more than 60% of
    water resources in the three river basins) but are limited in the Yellow River
    basin (about 4%) (Fig. 2). The groundwater dynamics have been studied in recent
    years from both socioeconomic and scientific points of view (Kendy et al., 2004,
    Liu et al., 2001, Wang et al., 2005b). The main conclusion from these studies
    is that the groundwater table has declined continuously, particularly in the northern
    part of the region, due to intensive abstraction. The overdraft of groundwater
    has caused land subsidence and seawater intrusion into fresh water that has resulted
    in poor water quality in some areas. About 40,000 km2 of the southern Hai River
    basin had subsided more than 200 mm as of 1995 (Liu et al., 2001, Wang et al.,
    2007a). Fig. 3 is an example of groundwater table dynamics from 1974 to 2008 at
    Shijiazhuang city about 20 km south of Luancheng Station (Fig. 1), where a high
    rate of decline (−0.8 m/yr) occurred from 1978 to 2008. In the northern part of
    the NCP, groundwater tables decreased at a rate from −0.32 m/yr between 1964 and
    1984 and to −0.65 m/yr between 1984 and 1993 (Fig. 4). This result was mainly
    due to the increase in groundwater withdrawals for irrigation as surface water
    resources declined since the 1970s. The groundwater accounted for from 40% to
    58% of irrigation from the 1970s to 1990s, and almost 70% of irrigation water
    in 2004 (Wang et al., 2006a, Wang et al., 2007a). The south part of the NCP showed
    lower rates of decline than the northern part, where the ratio of groundwater
    abstraction to recharge was above 1.5 as reported by Liu et al. (2001). During
    2004–2006, the groundwater table was still decreasing in the piedmont plain, including
    Beijing, ShijiaZhang and Baoding locations, while in the central and littoral
    plain, groundwater levels were relative stable with no or very little decline
    (Wang et al., 2009c). Across Hebei province within the NCP, there was an average
    decline in groundwater table from 13.5 m in 1995 to 15.6 m in 2000 with a rate
    of −0.42 m/yr (Xu and Cai, 2005). Wang et al. (2009a) also reported that about
    half of the sampled communities from seven provinces in northern China showed
    little or no decline in groundwater tables from 1995 to 2004, with only 11% of
    the sampled communities having groundwater table decreases greater than 1.5 m
    per year. This result indicted that the groundwater resources crisis may not be
    serious across all parts of the NCP (Wang et al., 2009a). Download : Download

    the thirty years from 1964 to 1993 at different locations in the North China Plain
    (adapted from Hu et al., 2005). In light of these recent declines in groundwater
    levels, however, there is a water deficit of more than 4.00 × 1010 m3 between
    water supply and demand in the region (Brown, 2001). In another study, annual
    water deficit in the NCP was estimated as 2.28 × 1010 m3 (349 mm) based on the
    irrigated area (Lin et al., 2000). Due to the variation in annual rainfall, water
    deficit ranges from 1.85 × 1010 m3 in a normal year (P = 50%) to about 3.25 ×
    1010 m3 in a dry year (P = 75%), and the uneven distributions of annual rainfall
    also aggravate the water deficit situation (Liu and Xia, 2004). As water supply
    from surface water and groundwater will decline, regional water resources are
    expected to be more vulnerable to over-use and pollution under global warming
    trends (Liu and Xia, 2004). On the other hand, the irrigation utilization efficiency
    is only 25–40% due to the high losses to drainage and evaporation in water delivery
    systems (Xu, 2001), along with environmental problems, such as a salinization
    (Nickum, 1988). Improving irrigation delivery system and water availability are
    essential to enhancing WUE and minimizing environmental problems in the NCP, but
    need more effort and help from both farmers and local government as discussed
    by Wang et al., 2005c, Wang et al., 2009a.Other approaches have also been presented
    and discussed for mitigating the increasing water deficits and environmental problems,
    such as using polluted or saline water, transferring water from the Yangtze River
    to the NCP (Liu et al., 2001, Barnett et al., 2006), and more efficient water
    utilization. Other studies attempted to investigate the water problems from a
    socioeconomic view (Huang et al., 2009, Wang et al., 2006b, Yang et al., 2003).
    As reported by Webber et al. (2008), however, there is no simple solution to water
    resource problems in the Yellow River basin and some solutions lie outside the
    basin requiring integrated social and economic management, and local farmers and
    governments collaborations (Barnett et al., 2006). In the NCP, the area of agricultural
    land is about 8.85 × 107 ha with an irrigated area of 6.53 × 107 ha, which consumes
    about 70% total water used (Lin et al., 2000). An analysis of water deficits in
    the NCP using a water balance method is presented in Fig. 5. The average water
    deficit across the region is 222 mm with an aridity index (rainfall/potential
    ET) of 0.76, and decreases from the Hai and Yellow River basins (345 mm) to the
    Huai River basin (92 mm). The three river basins have different water resource
    situations as indicated in Fig. 2, Fig. 5. Based on the data from 1995, 1996 and
    1997, the Yellow River basin only accounts for 3–4% of the total water resources
    in the NCP, and Huai River and Hai River basins account for 60–75% and 25–40%
    of the water resources, respectively, which is similar to the averaged values
    from multiple years (Fig. 2). The Hai River and Yellow River basins have similar
    water deficits but different water supplies. River water is the main water resource
    in the Yellow River basin, whereas surface water from the mountainous areas and
    groundwater are abundant in the Hai River basin. Huai River basin has the lowest
    water deficit level with adequade surface water and groundwater. In this context,
    different agricultural water management strategies can be applied according to
    the different levels of water supplies and deficits in each river basin. Download

    WUE in the NCP The WUE values for the main crops of wheat and maize in the NCP
    are still low and vary spatially. Yet there has been an increase in WUE from 0.23
    to 0.90 kg/m3 for cereal crops in Fengqiu area (Henan province) during the past
    50 years mainly due to increasing irrigation and fertilizer inputs (Xu and Zhao,
    2001). In another study based on data from 4422 sites across 22 provinces in China,
    the averaged WUE values were estimated as 1.1 kg/m3 for the cereal crops under
    well irrigated conditions (Duan and Zhang, 2000). The WUE for wheat and maize
    ranged from 1.0 to 1.9 kg/m3 under well managed experimental sites in the NCP
    (Deng et al., 2006, Wang et al., 2002), which is comparable to the reported WUE
    values based on a global survey (Zwart and Bastiaanssen, 2004).Above results show
    that WUE in farmer''s fields is generally lower than on the experimental sites
    due to the irregularity and deficit of irrigation amounts and limitations of soil
    nutrients, pest and weeds (Duan and Zhang, 2000). Since the traditional management
    generally irrigated in excess of crop requirements, with totally 300–500 mm (4–6
    times per season) for wheat and 100–300 mm (1–3 times per season) for maize (Zhang
    et al., 2006b). It is possible to reduce water consumption with no or little reduction
    in grain yield (Wang et al., 2002, Hu et al., 2006), thereby increasing WUE. 4.
    Agronomic management for high WUE Stanhill (1986) proposed three ways of coping
    with water deficits: (1) reducing water delivery losses in irrigation systems;
    (2) improving soil water availability to crop roots; and (3) increasing crop water
    use efficiency. Other studies have pointed to socio-economic factors, such as
    the irrigation institutional reforms, privatization of wells, government policy
    and the response of farmers to water crisis and incentives in the NCP (Blanke
    et al., 2007, Lohmar et al., 2003, Wang et al., 2009a). They found that with increased
    private ownership of wells and better water delivery, such as low-pressure water
    underground pipeline conveyance systems, the water delivery efficiency was improved
    in recent years but needs to be further extended widely in the NCP. Economic incentives
    were also effective in getting farmers to save water. However, the traditional
    irrigation technologies practiced by farmers, such as flood, border and furrow
    irrigation methods, are still used widely in the region and constrain the efficiency
    of agricultural water utilization. The household-based water-saving technologies,
    including plastic sheeting, retaining crop stubble on the surface, and drought
    resistant varieties have been adopted in recent years (Blanke et al., 2007, Wang
    et al., 2009a), but the innovative water-saving irrigation management, such as
    regulated deficit irrigation strategies have not been adopted widely by the farmers
    for economic reasons. 4.1. Increasing soil water availability by soil surface
    management Soil evaporation is an important component of ET, and is mainly controlled
    by soil surface energy balance and soil hydraulic properties. Soil evaporation
    can be altered by soil surface management, such as tillage, crop residue cover
    and mulching, and thus affect field-level WUE. Tillage is one of the traditional
    soil management practices for weed control and seed bed preparation to increase
    crop yield in irrigated agriculture in the NCP, but has influence on soil properties
    and soil water storage in dryland agriculture without mulching as commonly practiced
    by farmers in the NCP (Li et al., 2007b, Shangguan et al., 2001, Wang et al.,
    2007c). Wang et al. (2002) reported that about 90% rainfall in the summer can
    be stored by soil with deep tillage. Jin et al. (2006) found that deep tillage
    with crop residue mulching reduced runoff by 50% and soil erosion by 90% compared
    with conventional tillage (15–20 cm depth without mulching). However, tillage
    effects may be short-lived and the effects of tillage on long-term infiltrability
    have been mixed due in part to spatial and temporal variability of field soils
    (Strudley et al., 2008) and the differences in management and weather conditions.
    Furthermore, the effects of tillage on WUE, and crop yield are complex and related
    to other management practices, such as crop residue management (Hatfield et al.,
    2001). Table 2 is a summary of recent studies on the effects of tillage on ET
    and WUE under irrigated agriculture in the NCP. Although there is great variability
    in WUE among these studies across different soil and climate conditions, conventional
    tillage (CT) showed higher WUE than zero tillage by about 29% for wheat due to
    poor seeding caused by previous maize residues under zero tillage conditions (Li
    et al., 2007c). Here, CT is defined as tillage to 15–25 cm depth without mulching
    commonly practiced by farmers in the NCP. For maize, the opposite results were
    obtained with a 17% higher WUE under zero tillage with residue cover due to increased
    grain yield and similar ET. In these studies, the differences in WUE among tillage
    practices were attributed to either differences in ET, or grain yield or both
    depending on the crop. Reasonable tillage practices, such as reduced tillage with
    crop straw mulching can increase WUE by about 13% (0–48%) for wheat and by about
    17% (5–23%) for maize depending on soil types, climate (rainfall) and other management
    practices. Other studies on conservation tillage, including reduced or no tillage
    with crop residue mulching in the dryland agriculture in northwest China found
    that it could effectively conserve soil water, reduce soil erosions, and improve
    crop yield and WUE (Gao et al., 2003, Jin et al., 2007, Wang et al., 2007c). However,
    conservation tillage should be carefully applied in irrigated agriculture, due
    to its negative influence on early crop growth and yield (Chen et al., 2007a).

    by 25–40% through soil surface managements based on experiments conducted in many
    countries. The effects of crop straw and residue mulching on WUE varied among
    crops, seasons and other management practices (Hatfield et al., 2001). Deng et
    al. (2006) found that WUE was improved by 10–20% using crop residue management
    in northern China. Table 3 summarizes the recent studies on WUE in response to
    crop straw or residue management in the NCP. Residue mulching can improve WUE
    by about 13–27% for wheat or spring by increasing soil water storage with reducing
    soil evaporation by 17–68 mm during the early crop stages and fallow periods (Zhao
    et al., 1996), but the total ET values were similar between mulching and no mulching
    treatments (Table 3). For wheat, very different results were reported. Zhang et
    al. (2003) found an increase in WUE under mulching conditions, but Chen et al.
    (2007a) reported a similar or a slight decline in WUE under mulching conditions
    mainly due to delayed wheat growth caused by the low soil temperature in early
    spring. However, most studies showed that mulching with crop residue can improve
    maize yield and WUE (Table 3). In dryland agriculture, residue mulching can significantly
    improve WUE of wheat because more soil water is available under mulching, which
    can offset the negative influence of the low temperature on crop growth (Xu et
    al., 2006). Table 3. Evapotranspiration (ET) and water use efficiency (WUE) responses

    426 422 1.22 1.16 Plastic film mulching is another water-saving technique developed
    recently, which can reduce soil evaporation substantially by about 50% compared
    with no mulching. Although this technique is generally used to increase soil temperature
    for better crop growth, it can also save water especially under non-irrigated
    conditions, such as rainfed maize in the north and northwestpart of China. (Deng
    et al., 2006, Yuan et al., 2006, Zhang et al., 2005a). However, due to the economic
    costs, plastic film is mainly applied to cash crops, such as vegetable and oil
    crops, under irrigated conditions. On the other hand, plastic film mulching has
    some disadvantages, such as premature senility and difficulty to removal and disposal.
    4.2. Soil nutrient management Improving soil nutrient status can have a positive
    influence on WUE (Hatfield et al., 2001, Wang et al., 2002). In China, previous
    studies mainly focused on the effects of soil nutrients on crop yield and WUE
    in dryland agriculture (Xu et al., 2007, Yu et al., 2005). For irrigated agriculture,
    most studies were focused on how soil nutrient management affected crop yield
    and grain quality (Yu et al., 2002, Xu et al., 2003). Recently, researchers have
    paid more attention to fertilizer effects on WUE and environmental impacts (Fang
    et al., 2006, Liu et al., 2003, Yi et al., 2008). There is a great variation of
    WUE reported in the literature across different years or locations as influenced
    by soil nutrient management in the NCP (Table 4). Generally, nitrogen (N) application
    increased WUE with maximum WUE obtained at N rates ranging from 150 to 250 kg
    N/ha per crop season depending on crop types, soil and climate conditions. Current
    N inputs are generally excessive with N application rates of 250–300 kg N/ha per
    crop or higher for cash crops, which results in low N use efficiency and high
    N losses (about 70 kg N/ha per crop) (Fang et al., 2006, Liu et al., 2003). Because
    soil N availability is influenced by multiple factors, such as climate, soil type,
    tillage, and crop residue and rotation management (Hatfield et al., 2001), responses
    of crop yield and WUE to N management vary greatly. Some studies showed a slight
    increase (about 10–20%) in WUE with N application rate (Wang et al., 2007b, Wang
    et al., 2007e, Zhong et al., 2000), whereas others showed a large increase (more
    than 50%) in WUE with N application rate (Dang et al., 2006, Wu and Yang, 2004,
    Zhao et al., 1999). This discrepancy was probably due to the difference in N supply
    from soils with different mineralization across the region. In general, WUE increased
    more for maize than for wheat (Table 4), indicating a higher response to water
    and N by maize than by wheat. Fertilizer (mainly N fertilizer) applications increased
    WUE by about 20% on average (9–66%) for wheat and by 26% (2–53%) for maize (Table
    4). This result was similar to the report from Hatfield et al. (2001) who reported
    that soil nutrient management increased WUE by15–25% across a range of climates
    and crops. The high variability of measured WUE indicated strong interactions
    between these management practices across the different soil and climate conditions.

    No, Medium, and High denote zero, medium and highest N application rates for specific
    experimental N treatments. Interactions between soil water and N greatly affect
    soil water and N balance and WUE, and N application rate in the NCP should be
    reduced under water limited condition for more efficient use of water and N (Fang
    et al., 2006, Fang et al., 2008, Liu et al., 2003). Other studies found that increase
    in WUE by N application was mainly due to a deep root system with more soil water
    available for crops (Du et al., 1999, Li et al., 1994, Li et al., 2001, Song and
    Li, 2004). Shen et al. (2001) reported that the optimal N rates for high wheat
    yield were about 300 kg N/ha under adequate irrigation conditions and 200 kg N/ha
    under limited irrigation conditions. Wu et al. (2008b) and Wang et al. (2007d)
    found N application rates of 150–200 kg N/ha were suitable for wheat under limited
    irrigation conditions. Li et al. (2003) found an N application rate of 144 kg
    N/ha with highest N recovery and lowest N loss under limited irrigation conditions
    during wheat seasons. These results suggested N application rates should vary
    according to irrigation levels (Wang et al., 2008). Only limited studies have
    documented the effects of phosphorus fertilizer on crop WUE. Liang (1996) found
    that phosphorus nutrition can improve root water potential, root growth and dry
    weight, and grain WUE under water stress conditions. Other studies reported that
    phosphorus fertilizer can increase WUE especially under moderate water stress
    conditions, and the effects of phosphorus fertilizer on WUE had a close relationship
    with the N and irrigation management (Zhang et al., 2000b, Zhang and Li, 2005).
    Some other studies reported that potassium can increase crop drought resistance
    and WUE by increasing crop growth and reducing water consumption (Li et al., 2001,
    Li et al., 2005b). 4.3. Irrigation management Under field experimental conditions
    in the NCP (Table 5), the highest WUE was generally obtained at the moderate supplemental
    irrigation levels from 150 to 250 mm for wheat depending on experimental site
    conditions. The high variation in WUE across seasons or locations suggested that
    management other than irrigation, such as tillage and soil nutrients, influence
    WUE greatly. In the NCP, irrigation management can improve WUE of wheat by about
    25% (7–88%). For maize, very few studies were carried out to investigate the effects
    of supplemental irrigation on WUE mainly due to the high rainfall during the maize
    season. Zhang et al. (2004) found no significant relation between maize yield
    with irrigation at Luancheng Ecological station, NCP (Hebei province), whereas
    Fang et al. (2007) found a severe water stress occurred at the early stage (jointing
    stage) of maize, which can substantially reduce maize yield even with irrigation
    later in the season. Table 5. Water use efficiency (WUE) response to irrigation

    Wheat 0–300 1.48 – 1.29 a No, Medium, and High denote zero, medium and highest
    irrigation levels for specific experimental N treatments. Several water-saving
    irrigation strategies have been developed for high WUE, including limited irrigation
    (Shan et al., 2006), regulated deficit irrigation (Kang et al., 2000, Zhang et
    al., 1998a, Cui et al., 2008) and controlled alternative partial root-zone irrigation
    (Kang et al., 1998, Kang and Zhang, 2004, Li et al., 2007a). These irrigation
    techniques can save 15–35% of irrigation water with an increase in WUE of 10–30%
    as reported by studies in China (Kang et al., 1998). Zhang et al. (1998a) reported
    that one irrigation application at booting stage produced comparable grain yield
    with 24–30% higher WUE compared to the four irrigation treatments in the NCP,
    and the increased WUE was attributed to a deep root system associated with early
    water stress and improved harvest index. In another study, Kang et al. (2002)
    concluded that regulating soil water depletion moderately in the early vegetative
    growth period and more during maturity resulted in high grain yield and WUE in
    a semiarid area. Kang and Zhang (2004) also reviewed alternative controlled partial
    root zone irrigation studies in China, and found that this irrigation technique
    can reduce water consumption by 35% with only about 6–11% reduction in biomass.
    Hu et al. (2009) found alternative controlled partial root zone irrigation could
    improve both N and water use efficiency for maize with less (70%) irrigation water.
    These irrigation strategies are being applied for many cash crops, such as vegetables
    under various conditions, but are rarely applied to cereal crops under field conditions.
    All these irrigation techniques require a better understanding of the sensitivities
    of crops to water stress and its ecological and physiological basis, which generally
    varies among different crop growth stages (Shan and Zhang, 1999, Zhang et al.,
    1999). For example, the sensitive stages of wheat to water stress are from jointing
    stage to grain filling stage depending on climate conditions (Table 5). Some studies
    (Chaves and Oliveira, 2004, Jones, 2004) have also shown that (1) the responses
    of different physiological processes, such as cell growth, photosynthesis, transpiration
    and photosynthate transfer between organs, to water stresses were also different;
    (2) the relationship between crop yield or WUE and ET showed WUE generally reached
    its highest value before maximum crop yield; and (3) the interactions between
    crop canopy and roots, such as abscisic acid (ABA), generally resulted in more
    efficient water use by crop. These results provide a theoretical basis to improve
    WUE by regulating irrigation according to plant water demand as discussed above.
    Another method is to schedule irrigation based on crop water stress as detected
    by canopy surface temperature measured with infrared thermometers (Alderfasi and
    Nielsen, 2001, Nielsen, 1990, Nielsen and Gardner, 1987). Correctly determining
    crop water stress index (CWSI) is a prerequisite of this irrigation management.
    Many studies were carried out to compare and improve CWSI calculation methods
    across different crop and climate conditions (Idso et al., 1981, Jackson et al.,
    1988, Jones, 1999). In the NCP, Yuan et al. (2004) found that the Jackson CWSI
    method was better for detecting crop water stress of winter wheat compared with
    the Idso definition (Idso et al., 1981) or the Alves definition (Alves and Pereira,
    2000). Li et al. (2010) concluded that CWSI calculated by the Jackson method based
    on the canopy-air temperature difference may be used for irrigation scheduling
    and agricultural water management of maize in the NCP. Other methods to monitor
    plant water stress for irrigation scheduling are soil water measurement, plant
    water potential, tissue water status measurement and stomatal conductance (Jones,
    2004, Jones, 2008). Remote sensing provides another promising tool to monitor
    soil and crop water stress status for irrigation management at large areas (Jones,
    1999). 4.4. Crop improvement and breeding Drought resistant crop cultivars have
    been shown to improve crop WUE, but crops with high drought resistance are usually
    associated with low grain yield, which limits the application of these cultivars
    in the NCP (Wang et al., 2002, Zhang et al., 2006c). High WUE has become a very
    important indicator for crop breeding because it combines drought resistance and
    high potential yield (Zhang et al., 2006c). Based on the drought resistance and
    WUE for wheat, for example, there are four cultivar types: (1) low WUE with low
    ET and low grain yield; (2) high WUE with both moderate ET and grain yield; (3)
    highest WUE with highest grain yield and moderate ET; and (4) lowest WUE with
    high ET and low grain yield. Among the four cultivar types, types 2 and 3 are
    the favorite crop breeding traits. Many studies have found that large variations
    in WUE among different crop types were due to the different responses of these
    crops to water stress (Shan and Zhang, 1999, Zhang et al., 2006c), and even for
    the same crop, such as wheat, different crop cultivars also had different WUE
    under water stress conditions (Yi et al., 2008, Zhang et al., 2000c). As much
    as 50% difference in WUE was found among wheat cultivars in semiarid areas (Shan
    et al., 2006). Zhang and Shan (1998b) demonstrated a progression in WUE from diploid
    to hexaploid wheat cultivar in the semiarid area. Zhang et al. (2005b) reported
    that wheat cultivars showed a large difference of 40% in WUE at leaf level (photosynthesis
    rate/transpiration rate). For different crop cultivars, WUE generally has weak
    relationship to physiological processes, such as leaf photosynthesis and transpiration
    rates, but is closely related to grain yields (Zhang et al., 2006b). These results
    showed great opportunities to select drought resistant crop cultivars with high
    WUE. In the NCP, WUE for wheat and maize showed an obvious increase with time
    as reported by Zhang et al. (2005b). An increase in WUE of about 40% for maize
    and about 20% for wheat from 1982 to 2002 was found in the NCP, which was due
    to both improved crop cultivars and management practices. 4.5. Cropping systems
    The main double cropping system of wheat and maize with high water consumption
    may not be sustainable considering the increasing water deficit in agriculture
    and serious environmental problems in the NCP. Other alternative cropping patterns
    or farming systems with less water requirement may be helpful to mitigate the
    water crisis (Liao and Huang, 2004). However, limited studies have been conducted
    on how cropping systems, such as wheat–maize two crops one year, winter wheat–summer
    maize–spring maize three crops two years, faba bean–maize, spring soybean two
    crops one year, influenced WUE and water consumption in the NCP (Liu et al., 2008a,
    Liu et al., 2008b, Ma et al., 2008, Wu et al., 2008a, Ye et al., 2008). The main
    conclusion thus far is that wheat and maize double cropping systems can use water
    more efficiently with higher production but consume more water compared to other
    cropping systems, such as peanut–wheat–maize, and bean–maize in the area. However,
    some alternative cropping systems, such as crop–fruit tree systems, may have higher
    economic returns than the main cropping system. These lower water-consumption
    cropping systems can be alternatives to the main cropping system, especially in
    areas with serious water deficit. Rainfed cropping systems in the NCP should be
    investigated for possible transitions from irrigated agriculture to rainfed agriculture
    in the area to cope with the decline in water supply and mitigate the water crisis
    in the future. The partitioning of water between wheat and maize in the double
    cropping system also has a great influence on WUE mainly due to the uneven distributions
    of the annual rainfall between crop seasons. Supplemental irrigation in the wheat
    season can contribute to a high initial profile water storage for the subsequent
    maize (Fang et al., 2007), and mulching with crop residues during wheat season
    can maintain more water for the subsequent maize as reported by Chen et al. (2007a).
    High seasonal rainfall during the maize season contributes significantly to a
    high soil water level before wheat planting in the NCP (Fang et al., 2010). In
    this context, irrigation strategies should consider the whole cropping system
    and the interactions between crops to improve WUE of all crops across different
    climate conditions. 4.6. Agricultural systems modeling at field scales Variations
    in WUE can be attributed to agricultural management (e.g., soil management practices,
    irrigation, crop cultivars) and environmental factors (e.g., soil and climate
    conditions) (Zwart and Bastiaanssen, 2004). Climate and soil variations are the
    biggest obstacles to extending advanced management strategies from experimental
    results to other field conditions, and to improve regional WUE. System modeling
    and analyses are useful tools to evaluate various water management scenarios across
    various climate conditions and soil types (Ma et al., 2007). In the NCP, only
    in recent years, agricultural system models have been used to investigate soil
    water balance and WUE across various soil, climate and management conditions (Yu
    and Wang, 2001). Wang et al. (2001) used a process-based model (WAVES) to simulate
    the effect of irrigation management on crop growth and soil evaporation, and found
    that mulching can reduce soil evaporation up to 50% in the NCP. Yang et al. (2006)
    found that 100 mm irrigation water can be saved with an improvement of WUE from
    1.27 to 1.45 kg/m3 for wheat (ET was reduced by 76 mm) based on a 12-year simulation
    period using CERES-wheat model in the NCP. Chen et al. (2007b) used a crop growth
    model coupled with water and N management modules to optimize water and N use
    efficiency for wheat, and found that a 13% increase in WUE along with a 25% reduction
    in irrigation was obtained for the optimized management scenario compared with
    the control. Several studies using the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) investigated
    interactions between soil water and N and its impact on crop yield and environmental
    quality in the NCP (Yu et al., 2006, Hu et al., 2006, Fang et al., 2008), which
    showed that there was a great potential to reduce current N inputs according to
    the irrigation levels with little or no influence on crop yield. As examples of
    managing N in a wheat–maize system in the NCP, Yu et al. (2006) showed that a
    reduction of 25% of current water and N applications reduced N leaching by 24–77%
    with crop yield reduction of 1–9% only based on RZWQM sensitivity analysis results.
    Hu et al. (2006) also found that typical applications of water and N can be reduced
    by about 50% with only little reduction in crop yield (less than 10%) but with
    about 50% reduction in N leaching. Fang et al. (2008) also used RZWQM to evaluate
    the effects of different combinations between soil water levels and N application
    rates, and concluded that, auto-irrigation triggered at 50% of the field capacity
    and recharged to 60% field capacity in the 0–50 cm soil profile with 200 kg N/ha
    per crop application rate were adequate for obtaining acceptable yield in a wheat
    and maize double cropping system. They also showed potential savings of more than
    30% of the current N application rates per crop from 300 to 200 kg N/ha, which
    could reduce about 60% of the N leaching without compromising crop yields. Another
    example for evaluation of different irrigation scheduling using RZWQM in the NCP
    was reported by Fang et al. (2010). The results showed that the most sensitive
    stage of wheat to water stress was the stem extension (jointing) stage, and irrigation
    applied during this stage achieved higher WUE. Two irrigations applied at jointing
    and booting stages resulted in the highest yield and WUE. Irrigation before planting
    wheat commonly practiced by local farmers should be postponed to the most sensitive
    stage for higher WUE. In another study, Chen et al. (2010) used the Agricultural
    Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) to investigate the effects of climate variations
    and irrigation on crop WUE based on long-term weather conditions, and recommended
    one (70 mm), two (150 mm) and three (200 mm) irrigations for wheat, and zero,
    one (60 mm), and two (110 mm) irrigations for maize in the wet, medium and dry
    seasons, respectively. These modeling studies provided useful guidance to managing
    limited water resources, and results can be transferred more efficiently across
    different climate conditions. However, the effect of soil characteristics on soil
    water balance and WUE have not been quantified fully under different agricultural
    management conditions. As discussed above and in other studies (McVicar et al.,
    2002), very large deviations in WUE can occur among different soil types (Ma et
    al., 2002), because soil type controls soil water and nutrient dynamics (Wang
    et al., 2009b, Ma et al., 2007). Several studies were conducted to evaluate irrigation
    and N managements across different soil types and climate conditions in the NCP
    by linking geographic information systems (GIS) and crop growth model (Huang et
    al., 2001, Gao et al., 2006a, Gao et al., 2006b), and found close relationship
    among WUE and rainfall, irrigation and soil hydraulic conductivity across the
    different soil types, and provided useful information on regional agricultural
    management. 5. Regional WUE assessment and improvement Crop WUE at regional scales
    is a very important indictor for regional water resource assessment and management.
    Quantifying regional WUE is essential to understanding variations in WUE as influenced
    by multiple factors, such as water resources, soil, climate and agronomic management.
    Many studies have focused on the assessment of water resources and its potential
    influence on agricultural production in the NCP (Liu and Xia, 2004). McVicar et
    al. (2002) defined regional agricultural WUE as grain yield per water available
    (mm) for crop growth, and monitored regional WUE in the NCP, where WUE from 75
    to 80% of observed areas was 0.5–1.5 kg/m3 in the Hebei province from 1984 to
    1996. Large spatial and temporal variations in WUE can occur due to rainfall distributions,
    water quantity and other management factors. Mo et al. (2005) using the SWAT model
    with remotely sensed data simulated regional WUE of 1.23–1.58 kg/m3 for irrigated
    wheat and 1.10–1.93 kg/m3 for irrigated maize across the NCP, and concluded that
    improving irrigation efficiency can significantly enhance crop yield and WUE in
    the area. In another study, Liu et al. (2007), using the GIS-based EPIC model,
    reported that the simulated regional WUE averaged over different areas in the
    NCP was 1.20 kg/m3 (0.75–1.42 kg/m3) for irrigated wheat. All these studies showed
    a 30–50% higher WUE for irrigated agriculture than rainfed agriculture, confirming
    that irrigation in the NCP is the most important method to maintain high yield
    and WUE. Based on the simulated WUE levels for irrigated areas in the NCP (Liu
    et al., 2007), about 360 mm of irrigation water is needed for both wheat and maize,
    which obviously exceeded water supply of about 160 mm (considering water transfer
    efficiency) in the region (Lin et al., 2000), and will likely result in a quicker
    decline in groundwater levels in the area (Chen et al., 2010). Climate change
    also has a likely influence on WUE but with high uncertainties due to the magnitude
    and pattern of climate change and the response of ecosystem. In theory, increased
    atmospheric CO2 concentration can increase WUE (Grant et al., 1999, Gregory and
    Ingram, 2000, Triggs et al., 2004). Other factors, such as air temperature increase
    and changes in rainfall patterns change may decrease crop yield and WUE, especially
    in water-limited semiarid areas (Ju et al., 2005, Lin et al., 2005). Xiong et
    al. (2007) used the CERES-Maize model to simulate rainfed and irrigated maize
    yields under two climate change scenarios, and found a decrease in maize yield
    without considering CO2 fertilization effect. Maize yield can also increase under
    rainfed conditions but decrease for irrigated maize when CO2 fertilization effect
    was taken into account. In another study, based on survey data from households,
    Wang et al. (2009b) found that global warming may affect rainfed farmers negatively
    but benefit irrigated farmers, and that agricultural irrigation supply will play
    a more important role in maintaining high yield under future climate change conditions.
    The changes in water resource availability and agricultural water requirements
    as influenced by climate change may have substantial influences on soil water
    balance, crop water use and WUE in the future (Chen et al., 2005a, Chen et al.,
    2006a, Wang et al., 2007e). The uncertainty from the interactions between climate
    change, crop response, land use pattern and water resources availability should
    be investigated as a complex system for its impacts on crop yield and WUE (Betts,
    2005, Xiong et al., 2009). 6. Regional water resources balance and crop production
    Assessment of water resources balance on water supply and crop water demand is
    very important for applying reasonable water management strategies and realize
    potential water-saving and high WUE at regional scales. Table 6 presents various
    scenarios with different water balances and crop productions under different ET
    (40–100%) and WUE levels, where three different regions of the Yellow, Huai and
    Hai River basins with different water resources situations were analyzed (Fig.
    2). In the Yellow River basin, water resources can only maintain up to 60% of
    the maximum ET for wheat without resulting in a decline in groundwater when 100%
    of crop areas are irrigated, and can maintain about 80% of the maximum ET for
    wheat when 50% of crop areas are irrigated. Similar results were found in the
    Hai River basin. In these two river basins, the rainfall for maize is usually
    adequate (about 80% of the maximum ET), but supplemental irrigation may be applied
    due to the uneven seasonal distributions. Poor irrigation efficiencies and spatial
    and temporal variations in water availability may increase water deficits, and
    the water deficits under different water supply levels shown in Table 6 (40–100%
    of maximum ET) are the best scenarios. In the Huai River basin, there are no obvious
    water deficits in the regions, the surplus water resources can potentially be
    transferred to the other two basins. Based on the current irrigation area (50%
    of crop land area) in the NCP, three scenarios for the three river basins were
    selected with higher crop yield (highest WUE) and reasonable water balances (e.g.,
    no obvious decline in groundwater table) (Table 6). About 3.00 × 1010 m3 from
    the Huai River may be allocated to the Yellow River (0.50 × 1010 m3) and Hai River
    (2.50 × 1010 m3) basins. Under such these scenarios, the total crop yield in the
    NCP is about 1.37 × 1011 kg (0.52 × 1011 kg for irrigated wheat, 0.14 × 1011 kg
    for rainfed wheat and 0.71 × 1011 kg for rainfed maize), which is close to the
    projected food demand (1.51–1.55 × 1011 kg) in 2010 in the NCP (Yu and Ren, 2001).

    49 60 1.8 23 0% a Although irrigation can be applied due to the uneven rainfall
    distributions, seasonal rainfall is generally adequate in amount for maize, and
    we only calculated the water resources balance for wheat. Water resources balance
    was calculated based on the following equations: Evapotranspiration (ET) = Rainfall
    + water resources supply + Irrigation. b Maximum ET is under no-water limited
    condition based on the references in the NCP (Zhang et al., 1998a, Zhang et al.,
    2004, Zhang et al., 2005b, Sun et al., 2006), and WUE values are determined by
    the relationship between WUE and ET, where maximum WUE are obtained at the 80%
    ET level and minimum WUE are obtained at 40% ET level (rainfed condition) according
    to above references (Table 5). c Water resource supplies for the three river basins
    are the potential water available for irrigation in the regions based on Liu and
    Wei (1989), and sometimes they may be not available due to their uneven distributions.
    Surface water 1 occurs within the river basin and surface water 2 occurs from
    mountain areas. d Irrigation and water deficits were calculated based on the effective
    irrigation area (100% and 50% two levels, and 50% is close to the real condition
    in the NCP) for wheat and the total crop yield were also calculated in a same
    way based on WUE at each water level. e Water deficits are the difference between
    water resources supply and irrigation amount. The three scenarios selected with
    bold are the new scenario combination based on water allocation, where about 300
    × 109 m3 water from Huai River is allocated to Yellow River (50 × 109 m3) and
    Hai River (250 × 109 m3) to reduce groundwater use and table decline. f Crop yield
    are calculated only based on the irrigated area (effective irrigation area, 100%
    or 50%), and the effective irrigation area for wheat in the NCP is about 50% of
    crop area (Lin et al., 2000). Maize planting area is about 2/3 of wheat area in
    the NCP according to Yu and Ren (2001). 7. Discussions and perspectives Water
    is the most important limiting factor to agricultural production in the NCP, and
    likely will be exacerbated by increasing food demand and deteriorating soil and
    water quality (Chen et al., 2005b, Zhang et al., 1996). Enhancing agricultural
    WUE at field and regional scales via innovative management is the key to coping
    with the above challenges in the NCP. Soil and irrigation management are the most
    important measures, which were the focus of many studies that showed potential
    to improve WUE significantly. Crop breeding has a high potential to save water
    and improve WUE in the future (Condon et al., 2004, Passioura, 2006). Although
    some improvement in WUE has been achieved in the NCP during the past 20 years,
    the current results show that the WUE in farmer''s fields are still lower than
    WUE at experimental sites. There are several research priorities to further improve
    WUE at field and regional levels. The interaction among agronomic management practices
    across various soil and climate conditions is one of the most important information
    studied for designing the best site-specific strategies. For example, interactions
    between irrigation and N management (Xu et al., 2007, Fang et al., 2008), irrigation
    method and scheduling (Pereira, 1999), and tillage and crop residue management
    (Hatfield et al., 2001), can potentially improve WUE. Combining multiple management
    practices should be more effective in improving WUE than any single management
    in the NCP. Understanding the variations in WUE associated with soil and climate
    conditions can also contribute to the transfer of irrigation technology to farmers
    and to optimizing regional agricultural water management. Irrigation is a key
    to maintain high crop yields and improve WUE. Further evaluation and optimization
    from field to regional scales need to consider soil, climate and water resources
    variations. Similar to better N management strategies (Ladha et al., 2005), irrigation
    strategies can also be yield-targeting and variable for different soil conditions
    based on crop water demand and water supply. Newly developed precision irrigation
    has shown great promise to improve WUE (Jones, 2004, Jones, 2008), and can potentially
    improve WUE at field and regional scales. Increasing regional WUE is an important
    objective for agricultural water management, but has not been resolved mainly
    due to the complex influences of multiple factors, such as soil variations, hydrological
    variability, and agronomic managements, on crop growth and WUE. As suggested by
    Wang (1993), there are several approaches to saving water and improving WUE at
    the regional level, such as minimizing soil evaporation by proper irrigation and
    crop residue cover, improving irrigation delivery system, optimal water allocation
    to different fields or crops, and optimizing irrigation time and amount based
    on rainfall and water resource availability. Combining crop water requirements
    with specific water resource availability is the key for water allocation and
    irrigation management, and for assessing potential water saving in the NCP. Water-saving
    irrigation strategies based on the above results should improve regional WUE significantly.
    Whole-system modeling, along with remote sensing and GIS should be used to address
    regional WUE issues. We also identified several knowledge gaps for further increasing
    WUE in the NCP by: (1) further understanding of the effects of agronomic management
    on WUE across various soil and climate conditions; (2) quantifying the effects
    of soil water and N interaction in water-limited agriculture on water and N-use
    efficiency; (3) improving irrigation practices (timing and amounts) based on real-time
    monitoring of water status in soil-crop systems; and (4) maximizing regional WUE
    by managing water resources and allocation between different regions. Acknowledgements

    Abstract In the coming few decades, global freshwater demand will increase to
    meet the growing demand for food, fibre and biofuel crops. Raising water productivity
    in agriculture, that is reducing the water footprint (WF) per unit of production,
    will contribute to reducing the pressure on the limited global freshwater resources.
    This study establishes a set of global WF benchmark values for a large number
    of crops grown in the world. The study distinguishes between benchmarks for the
    green–blue WF (the sum of rain- and irrigation water consumption) and the grey
    WF (volume of polluted water). The reference period is 1996–2005. We analysed
    the spatial distribution of the green–blue and grey WFs of different crops as
    calculated at a spatial resolution of 5 by 5′ with a dynamic water balance and
    crop yield model. Per crop, we ranked the WF values for all relevant grid cells
    from smallest to largest and plotted these values against the cumulative percentage
    of the corresponding production. The study shows that if we would reduce the green–blue
    WF of crop production everywhere in the world to the level of the best 25th percentile
    of current global production, global water saving in crop production would be
    39% compared to the reference water consumption. With a reduction to the WF levels
    of the best 10th percentile of current global production, the water saving would
    be 52%. In the case that nitrogen-related grey WFs in crop production are reduced,
    worldwide, to the level of the best 25th percentile of current global production,
    water pollution is reduced by 54%. If grey WFs per ton of crop are further reduced
    to the level of the best 10th percentile of current production, water pollution
    is reduced by 79%. The benchmark values provide valuable information for formulating
    WF reduction targets in crop production. Further studies will be required to test
    the sensitivity of the benchmark values to the underlying model assumptions, to
    see whether regionalization of benchmarks is necessary and how certain WF benchmark
    levels relate to specific technology and agricultural practices. Previous article
    in issue Next article in issue 1. Introduction Agriculture is the largest freshwater
    user, accounting for 99% of the global consumptive (green plus blue) water footprint
    (Hoekstra and Mekonnen, 2012). Growing populations, coupled with changing preferences
    in diets and rising demand for biofuels, will put increasing pressure on the globe’s
    freshwater resources (Falkenmark et al., 2009, Gleick, 2003, Rosegrant et al.,
    2009). The consumptive water use (from both precipitation and irrigation) for
    producing food and fodder crops is expected to increase at 0.7% per year from
    its estimated level of 6400 billion m3/year in 2000 to 9060 billion m3/year in
    order to adequately feed the global population of 9.2 billion by 2050 (Rosegrant
    et al., 2009). The growing freshwater scarcity is already evident in many parts
    of the world (Gleick, 1993, Hoekstra et al., 2012, Oki and Kanae, 2006, Postel,
    2000, Vörösmarty et al., 2010, Wada et al., 2011). Raising water productivity
    in agriculture (“more crop per drop”) can contribute to reducing the pressure
    on the global freshwater resources (Passioura, 2006, Rockström, 2003). The water
    footprint (WF) offers a quantifiable indicator to measure the volume of water
    consumption per unit of crop, as well as the volume of water pollution (Hoekstra
    and Chapagain, 2008, Hoekstra et al., 2011). The green WF measures the volume
    of rainwater consumed during the growing period of the crop; the blue WF measures
    the volume of surface and groundwater consumed. The grey WF measures the volume
    of freshwater that is required to assimilate the nutrients and pesticides leaching
    and running off from crop fields and reaching groundwater or surface water, based
    on natural background concentrations and existing ambient water quality standards
    (Hoekstra et al., 2011). WF benchmarks for crop production can be an instrument
    to compare actual WFs in certain regions or even at field level to certain reference
    levels and can form a basis to formulate WF reduction targets, aimed to decrease
    water consumption and pollution per unit of crop (Hoekstra, 2013a, Hoekstra, 2013b).
    WFs of crops vary enormously across regions and within regions (Brauman et al.,
    2013, Fader et al., 2011, Finger, 2013, Hoekstra and Chapagain, 2007, Mekonnen
    and Hoekstra, 2011, Siebert and Döll, 2010). There are no previous studies that
    aimed to develop benchmarks for the WF of crops, but a number of studies exist
    on benchmarking water productivities. The water productivity (ton/m3) in crop
    production is in fact the inverse of the green–blue WF (m3/ton) of crop production.
    Water productivity studies can be grouped into four classes: field studies, modelling
    studies, studies based on remote sensing, and studies employing a combination
    of field measurement and modelling or satellite data. In field studies, the relationship
    between seasonal water use and crop yield is determined from field measurements
    (Oweis et al., 2000, Rahman et al., 1995, Sadras et al., 2007, Sharma et al.,
    1990, Sharma et al., 2001, Zhang et al., 1999, Zhang et al., 1998). Water productivity
    studies based on field measurements are bound to experiments on a relatively small
    number of fields, so that results are always limited to local conditions such
    as climate, soil characteristics and water management practices and cannot easily
    be scaled up for larger areas. In modelling studies, soil water balance and crop
    growth models are used to estimate the components of the seasonal crop water balance
    (Amir and Sinclair, 1991, Asseng et al., 1998, Asseng et al., 2001). The limitation
    of model studies is that they generally do not account for all constraining factors
    and may exclude important factors such as pests, diseases and weeds and their
    use is limited by data availability and quality (Grassini et al., 2009). Remote
    sensing studies use satellite data to estimate the spatial variation of water
    productivity (Biradar et al., 2008, Cai et al., 2009, Zwart and Bastiaanssen,
    2007, Zwart et al., 2010a, Zwart et al., 2010b). The use of remote sensing allows
    estimating the water productivity over large areas. A number of studies combined
    measured data with simulation models (Grassini et al., 2009, Robertson and Kirkegaard,
    2005, Sadras et al., 2003) and others combined measured data with remote sensing
    data (Cai and Sharma, 2010). While crop water productivity is receiving an increasing
    amount of attention, minimizing water pollution (the grey WF) per unit of crop
    production receives much less attention. It is clear, though, that the grey WF
    per unit of crop varies greatly from place to place depending on agricultural
    practices (Chapagain et al., 2006, Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2010, Mekonnen and Hoekstra,
    2011). To our knowledge, there has been no previous study providing global benchmark
    values for green–blue and grey WFs of crops. The studies cited above are limited
    to either a few crops or specific locations. The objective of the current study
    has been to develop global WF benchmark values for 124 crops based on the spatial
    variability of crop WFs as found in our earlier global WF assessment of crop production
    (Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2011). 2. Method and data The study distinguishes between
    benchmarks for the green–blue WF and the grey WF of crops. The approach has been
    to analyse the spatial distribution of the green–blue and grey WFs of different
    crops as calculated at a spatial resolution of 5 by 5′ with a dynamic water balance
    and crop yield model. Details on the model used have been reported in Mekonnen
    and Hoekstra, 2010, Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2011. Basically, the model computes
    a daily soil water balance and calculates crop water requirements, actual crop
    water use (both green and blue) and actual yields. Green–blue WFs are calculated
    by dividing the evapotranspiration of green and blue water over the growing period
    by the crop yield. Grey WFs are calculated based on nitrogen application rates,
    leaching-runoff fractions and water quality standards for nitrate. We did not
    consider the grey WF from other nutrients (like phosphorous) or pesticides. The
    model was applied at a global scale for the period 1996–005. In total, 124 crops
    were studied. We first analysed the WF of wheat in terms of m3/ton at three different
    spatial resolution levels – country, provincial and grid level – in order to identify
    the proper spatial resolution for developing WF benchmarks for crop production.
    After choosing the grid level as the best option for further analysis, the variability
    in WFs of crops over all crop growing grid cells in the world was used for developing
    the benchmarks. Per crop, we ranked the WF values for all relevant grid cells
    from smallest to largest and plotted these values against the cumulative percentage
    of the corresponding production. From the graph, we could thus read the WF values
    at different production percentiles. For an analysis of differences in WFs between
    developing versus industrialised countries, we used the country classification
    based on income from the World Bank (2012); in which countries are divided according
    to the 2007 per capita gross national income. The groups are: low income (≤USD
    935), lower middle income (USD 936–3705), upper middle income (USD 3706–11455)
    and high income (≥USD 11,456). In order to analyse differences in WFs between
    different climatic regions, we used the Köppen–Geiger climate classification (Kottek
    et al., 2006) to group the world into four major climate classes: tropics (arid
    and equatorial), temperate, boreal (snow) and tundra (polar). Since little or
    no crop cultivation exists in the boreal and tundra regions of the world, we have
    focused on the tropics and temperate regions. 3. Results 3.1. The distribution
    of the green–blue water footprint of wheat at three spatial resolutions. The distribution
    of the green–blue water footprint (WF) of wheat was analysed at three different
    spatial scales by considering the average green–blue WF in m3/ton and production
    data in ton/year at country, provincial and grid level. Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3
    have been obtained by plotting the green–blue WF, sorted from smallest to largest,
    against the cumulative percentage of production. Although the figures for the
    three spatial scales of analysis show similar patterns, the points in the country-scale
    analysis (Fig. 1) do not form a smooth curve like the points in the provincial-scale
    (Fig. 2) and grid-scale analysis (Fig. 3), caused by the limited number of points
    in the country-scale analysis. The green–blue WF values at the respective production
    percentiles decrease when moving from the country to the grid level. In addition,
    we see that the WF at the 50th percentile of production is not necessarily equal
    to the global average WF, which is a characteristic of any skewed distribution.
    As we can see from the grid-based analysis, the variability of the WF of the best
    half of the global wheat production is smaller than the variability of the WF
    of the worst half, so that the global average WF (1620 m3/ton) turns out to be
    larger than the WF at the 50th percentile of production (1391 m3/ton). The latter
    value means that 50% of global wheat production occurs at a green–blue WF of 1391
    m3/ton or less. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Green–blue WF of wheat

    (in m3/ton) for all wheat-producing grid cells in the world, plotted from smallest
    to largest WF. There are two reasons that favour the grid over the provincial
    or country level analysis. First, particularly the country level analysis is weak
    as it provides a very dispersed curve and the analysis will get even weaker for
    crops which are grown in only a few countries. Second, there can be significant
    WF differences within provinces and countries, which are hidden in the analysis
    at those levels. The averages at provincial and even more so at country level
    are generally biased towards the worse footprints (because of the skewed distributions),
    so that the WFs at the various production percentiles found with the grid-based
    analysis are closer to reality than in case of the analyses at the lower resolution
    levels. Therefore, for the remainder of this study, we analyse the distribution
    of crop WFs at the grid level. 3.2. The green–blue water footprint of different
    crops at different production percentiles The distribution of the green–blue WF
    for ten selected crops at different production percentiles is shown in Table 1.
    The values were derived by plotting the green–blue WF of the respective crops
    from smallest to largest WF against the cumulative percentage of crop production.
    The curves are relatively flat in the first (best) half of the global production.
    The second (worst) half of the global production shows a steeper curve, with very
    large WF values for the last 10–20% of production. As a result, the WF at the
    50th percentile of production is generally smaller than the global average WF,
    as was already explained in the previous section for the case of wheat. Supplementary
    Material – Appendix A provides the green–blue WF at different production percentiles
    for all 124 crops studied. Table 1. Green–blue water footprint for a few selected

    maps in Fig. 4 show the spatial variability of the green–blue WF of the ten selected
    crops across the world. The ranges are chosen such that one can easily see in
    which parts of the world, production occurs at WFs in the range of the best 10%
    of global production, etc. One can immediately see that relatively small WFs are
    not inherent to high-income countries or humid regions and that large WFs are
    not intrinsically connected to low-income countries or (semi-) arid regions. This
    is more precisely shown in Table 2. Although low WFs as found in the best 10–20%
    of global production are mostly found in high income and temperate regions, we
    can find the different percentiles in all parts of the world, also in low income
    and tropical regions. High-income countries have a greater capacity to implement
    best available technology and best practices than less developed countries, but
    the presence of the best percentiles of production in the less developed and tropical
    countries indicates that reduction of WFs to the best 10th percentile of current
    global production is technically feasible everywhere. Download : Download full-size

    to compare the results from this study with the literature, we collected data
    from a number of water productivity studies for different crops and locations.
    We used four publications (Doorenbos and Kassam, 1979, Hatfield et al., 2001,
    Sadras et al., 2007, Zwart and Bastiaanssen, 2004) that summarize crop water productivities
    from various studies. Since the different studies relate to dissimilar climate
    and soil conditions and water management practices, the water productivity values
    for a given crop vary over a wide range. Fig. 5 shows the inverse of the water
    productivity ranges collected from literature together with the green–blue WF
    at different production percentiles from the current study. In most cases, the
    ranges found in the literature overlap well with the values found in this study.
    In some cases, the lowest value found in the literature is substantially smaller
    than the WF at the best 10th percentile of global production (millet, sorghum,
    cotton, soybean, chickpea, maize, banana), while other cases show the reverse
    (barley, green bean, pepper, potato and sugar beet). The values from literature
    are too random and probably not representative enough to reflect global variability
    to draw any conclusions here based on the comparison. In general though it can
    be said that this study is the first in its sort and that it will be useful to
    study the sensitivity of the benchmark values presented here to the underlying
    model and data. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Comparison of the

    crops at different production percentiles The nitrogen-related grey WF for ten
    selected crops at different production percentiles is presented in Table 3. The
    variability in the grey WF across crops and space is mainly due to differences
    in nitrogen (N) application (kg/ha) and crop yield (ton/ha). The grey WF at different
    production percentiles for all crops is provided in Supplementary Material – Appendix

    13 Wheat 27 82 99 144 208 Application of N fertilizer influences crop water productivity
    by affecting the rate of photosynthesis, canopy size and the harvest index (Sadras
    et al., 2007). N application generally increases grain yield and water productivity
    significantly (Belder et al., 2005), but the increase in crop yield and water
    productivity is achieved only up to a certain level of fertilization (Sandhu et
    al., 2012). Ensuring adequate N supply is critical for good water productivity,
    but only a fraction of the applied N fertilizer is recovered by plants (Addiscott,
    1996, King et al., 2001, Ma et al., 2008, Noulas et al., 2004) and on average
    about 16% of the applied N is presumed to be lost either by denitrification or
    leaching (Addiscott, 1996). Therefore, there is a trade-off between higher crop
    water productivity and increasing water pollution resulting from the loss of N
    to the freshwater system. This trade-off needs to be considered carefully because
    maximizing water productivity may result in deteriorating water quality through
    nutrient pollution. 3.4. Water saving and reduced water pollution when reducing
    water footprints down to benchmark values Table 4 presents the global green–blue
    water saving that could be achieved when, worldwide, the WF in crop production
    would be brought down to certain benchmark values. As benchmark values, we have
    used the WFs associated with the best 10th, 20th, 25th and 50th percentile of
    current production. The global water saving related to improved water productivity
    in crop production increases when the WF benchmark values get smaller (from the
    50th to the 10th percentile). If the gap between current WF levels and the global
    benchmark values at the 25th percentile of current production is eliminated, the
    global water saving would be 39%. In absolute terms, the largest WF reduction
    is observed for cereal crops: wheat (375 billion m3/year), rice (350 billion m3/year),
    maize (296 billion m3/year), sorghum (111 billion m3/year) and barley (110 billion
    m3/year). In the case of further reduction to the levels of the best 10th percentiles
    of current global production, the global water saving would be 52% compared to
    today. The potential reduction of the green–blue WF related to crop production
    for all crops is presented in Supplementary Material – Appendix C. Table 4. Global
    green–blue water saving if everywhere the water footprint of crop production is

    are even greater than the possible reductions in consumptive water use (Table
    5). In the case that grey WFs in crop production are reduced, worldwide, to the
    level of the best 25th percentile of current global production, water pollution
    is reduced by 54%. If grey WFs per ton of crop are further reduced to the level
    of the best 10th percentile of current production, water pollution is reduced
    by 79% compared to today''s pollution level. The potential reduction of the water
    pollution related to crop production for all crops is presented in Supplementary

    33 4. Discussion We developed WF benchmark values for crop production based on
    the spatial variability in WFs of crops worldwide, using the global assessment
    published earlier (Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2011). The current study is the first
    proposing global WF benchmarks for crops based on such spatial variability analysis.
    It will be useful to carry out similar analyses with other models than the one
    used in Mekonnen and Hoekstra (2011) to test the sensitivity of the outcomes to
    the model used. In addition, as proposed by (Hoekstra, 2013a, Hoekstra, 2013b),
    it would be useful to develop WF benchmarks from insights on what can be reached
    based on best available technology and practice. The current study shows the spatial
    distribution of WFs in terms of m3/ton based on regional differences in evapotranspiration
    and yields, but it provides no insight in why WFs are relatively small or large
    in specific regions and how WFs can actually be lowered in those regions where
    they are large. We have established global WF benchmark values instead of specific
    benchmarks for different agro-climatic or economic regions. One may argue that
    climatic or soil conditions can be a limiting factor for reducing the WF and different
    regional benchmark values should be established depending on growing conditions
    per region. However, although climatic and soil factors are important in determining
    evapotranspiration from crop fields and yields, the green–blue WF of crops in
    m3/ton is largely determined by agricultural management rather than by the environment
    in which the crop is grown (Rockström et al., 2007, Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2011).
    The higher evaporative demand in tropical climates compared to temperate regions
    is largely compensated for by more efficient photosynthetic pathways, which results
    in higher crop growth per unit of transpiration flow, so that the total crop water
    requirements are on average similar between hydro-climatic zones (Rockström, 2003).
    A large increase in crop yields, without an increase or even with a decrease in
    field evapotranspiration, is achievable for most crops across the different climate
    regions of the world through proper nutrient, water and soil management (Mueller
    et al., 2012). Therefore, water productivities as shown in the best 10th percentile
    of global crop production can be achieved irrespective of climate, which is also
    shown in our comparison of WFs of crops across different climate regions. We acknowledge,
    though, that further study may refine our global benchmarks into climate–soil-specific
    benchmarks. Another discussion refers to setting benchmarks for low versus high-income
    countries. One may propose another (less strict) WF benchmark for low-income countries,
    with the argument that achieving a certain water productivity in a low-income
    country is more difficult than in a high-income country, but there are two arguments
    against that, first, reality shows that for most of the crops studied, the water
    productivities that can be associated with the best 10th percentile of global
    crop production can be found in both low and high-income countries (Table 2).
    Second, there seems little reason to set other environmental standards for developing
    and industrialised countries, even though it can indeed be a greater challenge
    in developing countries to achieve certain improvements. When developing green–blue
    WF benchmarks we have not distinguished between rain-fed and irrigated agriculture.
    Intuitively one would assume that water productivities in irrigated agriculture
    are generally higher, thus WF benchmarks should be lower, but this appears not
    to be the case. As Mekonnen and Hoekstra (2011) have shown, the global average
    consumptive (green–blue) WF per ton of crop is lower in irrigated than in rain-fed
    agriculture for some crops (e.g. maize, rice, coffee, cotton) but higher for other
    crops (e.g. soybean, sugarcane, rapeseed). The former case can be explained by
    the fact that irrigated yields are generally larger than rain-fed yields, not
    just because of the additional water, but also because other differences (e.g.
    crop varieties grown, nutrient supply). The reverse case can be explained by the
    fact that marginal water productivity decreases with increasing water supply,
    so that beyond a certain point more irrigation may still increase land productivity
    (ton/ha), but not water productivity (ton/m3). In general, the higher water productivities
    that can be observed in some of the rain-fed agriculture are not specific to rain-fed
    agriculture; they can also be achieved in irrigated agriculture (by applying smart
    irrigation technology and practice). Reversely, the higher water productivities
    found in some of the irrigated agriculture are not specific to irrigated agriculture;
    provided that green water resources are sufficient, they could also be achieved
    in rain-fed agriculture (by better soil and nutrient management). We have developed
    global benchmarks for the combined green–blue WF of crops, no separate green WF
    and blue WF benchmarks. The reason is that the ratio green to blue will depend
    on local green water resources availability. Location-specific blue WF benchmarks
    can be developed as a function of the overall consumptive WF benchmarks and local
    green water availability. If a certain location receives sufficient rain to achieve
    a certain global benchmark on consumptive WF, the location-specific blue WF benchmark
    will be zero. The less rain, below a certain point, the higher the fraction blue
    will need to be to achieve a certain water productivity or WF benchmark. This
    exercise has not been carried out as part of the current study. There are several
    strategies to increase crop water productivities and reduce the WF of crops (Table
    6). It would be highly valuable to develop insight in how various techniques and
    practices affect green, blue and grey WFs in terms of m3/ton, and how certain
    combinations of techniques and practices will be required to reduce WFs to the
    benchmark values proposed in this study. Table 6. Technology and practices to
    reduce the water footprint in crop production. Strategies Technology and practices
    Increasing yield • Soil nutrients management (optimizing crop rotation, the use
    of crop residues, erosion control, appropriate tillage, proper application and
    timing of manure or artificial fertilizer) • Precision irrigation: synchronizing
    water application with crop water demand • Weed and pest control (through crop
    rotation, proper tillage, biological pest control) • Breeding of superior crop
    varieties with higher yield and better disease resistance Reducing non-beneficial
    evapotranspiration • Crop scheduling to reduce evaporation during fallow period
    • Plant spacing and row orientation • Affecting canopy development through agronomy
    and breeding • Minimum tillage to reduce soil water evaporation and conserve soil

    evaporation and improve nutrient recycling • Improved irrigation techniques (drip
    & subsurface irrigation) • Effective control of weeds to reduce transpiration
    from weeds Enhancing effective use of rainfall • Synchronizing crop scheduling
    and rainfall • Water harvesting and supplemental irrigation Sources: Hatfield

    The use of fertilizers will often improve water productivity, because yields will
    increase while water consumption can remain more or less equal. However, above
    a certain fertilizer application rate, yields may still slightly increase, but
    the effect of nutrient leaching and runoff to the freshwater system will start
    to dominate. When applying fertilizers, the trade-off between higher crop water
    productivity (smaller green–blue WF) and potential pollution of the groundwater
    and streams through nutrients (grey WF) should be considered carefully. Setting
    a grey WF benchmark value as done in this report may help to integrate the issue
    of water pollution into the discussion on water use efficiency in agriculture,
    a discussion that is usually fully focused on the consumptive side of freshwater
    appropriation, leaving out the pollution side. When applying WF benchmark values
    as target levels, trade-offs may be required when setting specific green, blue
    and grey WF targets. Particularly, grey WFs can often be easily reduced by reducing
    the use of fertilizers and pesticides (and applying the amounts still used in
    the optimal way at the best time so that yields are not affected), but at some
    point this may reduce yield and – since the evapotranspiration rate remains equal
    – thus increase the green–blue WF in terms of m3/ton. A similar thing can happen
    when reducing the blue WF by applying less irrigation water, for instance by deficit
    precision irrigation using drip technology, since at some point further reduction
    of irrigation may lower the yield so that the blue WF per hectare may still diminish,
    but the green, blue and grey WF per unit of crop will increase. 5. Conclusion
    With increasing water scarcity, there is a growing interest in improving crop
    water productivity in order to meet the growing global food demand with the limited
    freshwater resources. The challenge is thus to produce more crops with less water,
    thus reducing the WF per unit of crop produced. This study has developed WF benchmark
    values for a large number of crops grown in the world. The study shows that water
    savings and reduced water pollution can be very substantial – 39% of global water
    saving and 54% of reduced water pollution – if WFs per unit of crop are reduced
    to levels similar to the best quarter of global production. Our estimation of
    the potential reduction in the global WF of crop production is not meant to imply
    that this reduction is easily attainable. Raising yields in low-income countries
    will require large investments in capacity building and appropriate technologies.
    WF benchmarks for crops as developed in this study can be used to provide an incentive
    for farmers to reduce the WF of their crops towards reasonable levels and thus
    use water more efficiently. When granting water consumption permits to farmers
    and developing regulations on fertiliser use, it makes sense for governments to
    take into account the relevant WF benchmarks for the specific crops grown. The
    benchmarks are equally relevant for the food-processing industry, which increasingly
    focusses on the efficient and sustainable use of water in their supply chain (Sikirica,
    2011, TCCC, TNC, 2010, Unilever, 2012). The same holds for the apparel sector,
    particularly regarding cotton (Franke and Mathews, 2013), for the cosmetics industry,
    which uses various sorts of agricultural inputs (Francke and Castro, 2013), and
    the biofuel sector (Gerbens-Leenes et al., 2009). WF benchmarks will enable the
    actors along supply chains – from farmers through intermediate companies to final
    consumers – to compare the actual WF of products against certain reference levels
    (Hoekstra, 2014). The benchmark values can be used to measure performance, to
    set WF reduction targets and monitor progress in achieving these targets. Appendix

    1 Book Series:Agronomy Monographs PDF TOOLS SHARE Summary There has been more
    innovation in irrigation and drainage technologies and practices in the last 100
    yr than in all of the previous periods. This applies to every aspect of irrigation:
    diversion works, pumping, filtration, conveyance, distribution, application methods,
    drainage, power sources, scheduling, fertigation, chemigation, erosion control,
    land grading, and water conservation. Innovative irrigation techniques and management
    systems will be necessary to increase the cost-effectiveness of crop production,
    reduce soil erosion, and reduce energy requirements while enhancing and sustaining
    crop production, the environment, and water use efficiency. Irrigation in the
    future will be dominated by increasing pressure on diminishing water supplies,
    with local short-term decisions diverting water to uses deemed by society to be
    higher in value than irrigation. Concurrently, increasing public pressure on water
    quality will interact with pressure for conservation to increase the demand for
    higher post-irrigation water quality. References Citing Literature Irrigation

    170 SECTIONS PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract The efficient use of water supplies requires
    a systems approach that encompasses all aspects of making water available and
    its use within society that must recognise global issues. Increasing the efficiency
    of water use within agricultural systems is an essential priority in many regions
    including the Mediterranean. This review examines the research priorities, the
    prospects for crop and soil management and plant breeding and biotechnology that
    are needed to achieve high stable yield under drought in the Mediterranean. Research
    must combine the latest genomics resources including quantitative genetics, genomics
    and biomathematics with an ecophysiological understanding of the interactions
    between crop plant genotypes and the growing environment to better inform crop
    improvement. Introduction Water is essential to sustaining human health and environmental
    quality. Water is in extremely short supply in up to 10 eastern and southern Mediterranean
    countries (http://www.mideastnews.com/WaterWars.htm; http://www.fao.org/waicent/faoinfo/agricult/agl/aglw/aquastat/neareast.html;
    http://www.nature.com/nsu/000127/000127-11.html). Although Mediterranean climates,
    characterised by hot, dry summers and cold, wet winters (when 85% of annual rainfall
    occurs) are notoriously variable, severe drought is clearly a major problem. Drought
    may affect entire countries over several years and result in serious social, economic
    and environmental costs. This situation is compounded by the predicted change
    in climate with increased temperatures and decreased precipitation as a result
    of global warming (Mannion, 1995). Sustainable social and economic development
    and stability require the efficient and equitable management of water resources.
    While most aspects of the development of clear water policies and strategic management
    plans are a national responsibility, there is considerable advantage in developing
    these for the whole Mediterranean basin, although the large number of countries
    involved makes this difficult. However, the Mediterranean Network of Basin Organisations
    is trying to improve the communication between organisations related to water
    policy and management (http://www.remoc.org/DesktopDefault.aspx). An integrated
    policy is essential not only to increase the water resources capacity and development
    of appropriate decision support systems for efficient use but also to ensure the
    implementation of best practice across the entire region and maintain biodiversity
    (Firbank, 2005). The ‘European Declaration for a New Water Culture’ is a foresight
    document on sustainable water management addressed to the European Commission,
    European Parliament and National Governments to lobby them to accept and promote
    such ideals. It is vital that politicians commit to such initiatives. These conflicting
    pressures can be resolved by increasing the efficiency of water use within agricultural
    systems, but this requires an understanding of the interactions between society,
    agriculture, environment and management (Araus, 2004; Turner, 2004a,b). The actual
    water consumption by the various users is not clear, and research is needed to
    determine this. Agriculture consumes large amounts of water for irrigation, so
    it is important that the analysis fully considers returns from irrigation. The
    efficient use of water supplies requires an integrated systems approach that embraces
    all aspects of water supply and utilisation within society and must address conflicts
    regarding shared international water sources. In addition, appropriate governmental
    policies are essential to decrease water use and improve the efficiency of water
    use. While the use of water meters, charges and taxes together with incentives
    and penalties are all potential tools to achieve this investment in infrastructure,
    education and extension activities are also essential Abu-Zeid (2001). However,
    in this review, we briefly discuss the prospects, research priorities, both strategic
    and applied, and future directions for achieving high stable yield under drought
    (HSYD) to underpin sustainable agricultural production in the Mediterranean basin.
    HSYD can be achieved either through better crop and soil management or selection
    of appropriate crops with intrinsically large water-use efficiency and through
    breeding more efficient genotypes of plants. Crop and soil management The effective
    management of the available water resource through agronomic practice can play
    a major role in sustainable production under drought (Peterson & Westfall, 2004).
    While the traditional systems employed in the Mediterranean countries can give
    important insights into sustainable production under drought, the most advanced
    agronomic systems have been developed in Israel, Spain, the USA and Australia
    and are comprehensively reviewed in http://www.plantstress.com/Articles/index.asp
    The majority of agricultural production in the Mediterranean region is rain fed
    (e.g. 60% of the major cereal production) and vital to the water and food security.
    Rain-fed agriculture is generally characterised by low and uncertain rainfall
    and crops of limited production potential that are, however, generally more stable
    in such environments. Despite its scarcity, available rainfall is often poorly
    managed and much water is lost as run-off and evaporation. In these regions, the
    collection and efficient use of rainwater is crucial (Araus, 2004). Adoption of
    simple water-harvesting systems and better agronomic practices can increase water
    availability. Installation of the simplest water-harvesting systems (e.g. reservoirs)
    could provide access to water at critical times and minimal irrigation at key
    growth stages can dramatically improve yield (Oweis et al., 1998; Araus et al.,
    2002). Soil management The adoption of appropriate sustainable agronomic practices
    that conserve water, soil and nutrients is essential (Evans, 2005). The detailed
    practices required are dependant on both the local climate and the soil type.
    Crop residues are an important resource as soil that is covered evenly with crop
    residues is not only protected from wind and water erosion but the residue also
    slows moisture loss during the growing season and ensures that water moves into
    soil soon after rainfall and will not pond on the surface. In addition, crop residues
    can decrease disease in subsequent but different crops (Saucke & Doring, 2004).
    Over time, the organic matter in the crop residue becomes incorporated into the
    soil, improving soil structure and thereby its manageability. A soil structure
    with a proper mix of large and small pores favours root growth and the organic
    matter helps hold moisture and helps to cycle nutrients (Rao & Dao, 1996). Occasionally,
    the presence of the crop residue can decrease yield, with the yield reduction
    variously attributed to pests, disease or weeds (Rao & Dao, 1996; Rasmussen et
    al., 1997). However, the potential benefits of maintaining crop residues appear
    to greatly outweigh the occasional short-term disadvantages. More research with
    long-term experiments is needed to demonstrate sustainability of maintaining crop
    residues. Tillage practices to conserve water must be adopted; this must take
    into account local factors including soil texture and drainage characteristics.
    In general, no tillage with direct drilling into stubble is well suited to many
    grain crops and reduces wind and water erosion of soil, and in particular maintains
    a dry mulch, which slows evaporation from the soil surface, and thus retains soil
    moisture to support crop growth. It also improves soil structure and fertility
    (Holland, 2004), although it may, in the first seasons, lead to a decrease in
    yield through decreased N availability (Izumi et al., 2004). No tillage has frequently
    been shown to improve both seedling establishment and root growth (Klein et al.,
    2002; Ghosheh & Al-Hajaj, 2004). Studies of minimal tillage under Mediterranean
    conditions are few and limited. Further research is needed to verify the longer
    term agronomic, environmental and social benefits of minimum tillage in this region
    (Holland, 2004). In hilly areas, contour ploughing is beneficial and creates ‘mini
    terraces’ that prevent erosion by slowing or stopping the run-off of rainwater
    and thereby encouraging percolation into the soil. The same approach on a grander
    scale, the earth and stone terraces, characteristic of many Mediterranean regions
    is also a highly effective way of stabilising the soil, minimising run-off and
    increasing percolation. This increases the soil moisture available for crop growth.
    Crop management Water use can be further improved by changing cropping patterns.
    The choice of crop to be grown is critical and should reflect both the availability
    of water and socio-economic requirements. Water requirements can be greatly reduced
    by replacing a crop requiring substantial amounts of water, like cotton, with
    crops requiring less water, for example, grapevines. Similarly, utilisation of
    the best-adapted cultivars is important in maximising yield under water stress.
    Even simple adjustments such as cultivars that can be planted earlier to more
    closely match crop growth to rainfall distribution can increase productivity (Turner,
    2004a,b). There may be a compromise between yield and water use as more rapidly
    maturing varieties may have smaller yield potential. However, breeding combined
    with agronomy in an optimised system may increase efficiency and productivity.
    Even if breeding for drought tolerance lowers the yield potential of the crop,
    it may increase yield stability over seasons, which could still benefit many farmers
    in drought-prone areas (Araus et al., 2003). However, in many cases, newer improved
    varieties are accepted slowly by farmers. Often monoculture rather than polyculture
    accelerates soil erosion and decreases soil organic matter that further impairs
    both soil fertility and the capacity of soils for water retention. This can lead
    to the further depletion of land available for crop production. Crop rotation
    has major advantages over monocultures and increases the yields from a crop grown
    as part of a rotation compared to continuous cropping (Pierce & Rice, 1988; Christen
    & Sieling, 1993; Ghosheh & Al-Hajaj, 2004). Crop rotation reduces the population
    of pests specific to a crop, and it reduces the risk of crop disease and improves
    weed control. All these decrease losses and/or requirements for fertilisers, herbicides,
    insecticides and fungicides. For example, under Mediterranean conditions, growing
    legumes provided nitrogen for nonlegume crops (Papastylianou, 1993a,b; López-Bellido
    et al., 1996), alternating crops that successfully compete with weeds will reduce
    pressure on subsequent crops. Strip farming, in which narrow strips of crops are
    always present, can also be beneficial, especially in protecting soil from erosion
    by wind and water. The value of cover crops for their use in reduction of wind
    and water erosion, and ability to improve soil structure, nutrients and moisture
    retention, is well established. In the short term, cover crops can increase costs
    but offer major long-term benefits. Sociocultural factors may be a major obstacle
    to optimising sustainable production. For example, overcoming political instability
    will encourage individual farmers to plan for the future as will individual ownership
    of land (Abu-Zeid & Hamdy, 2002). Further research is needed to identify ways
    of moving improved varieties from breeders to their acceptance by farmers. Irrigation
    Agricultural irrigation is often inefficient, with water losses exceeding 50%
    in many Middle Eastern countries. This inefficiency can be attributed to technical
    problems of distribution and on-farm application exacerbated by poor maintenance
    of irrigation structures. However, it must be remembered that much of the water
    lost may in fact be recovered by other users in the catchment basin. Rapid evapotranspiration
    is a major problem especially where spray/overhead irrigation or flood irrigation
    is used – drip irrigation is much more efficient. Evapotranspiration can also
    be decreased by scheduling irrigation at night. Soils in the semiarid and arid
    regions are particularly vulnerable to soil degradation by erosion and salinisation
    (Ramoliya et al., 2004). Unsuitable, overintensive agricultural practices have
    exacerbated this problem and can in the case of severe degradation lead to desertification.
    The least fertile zones are frequently the most fragile but have been cultivated
    because of population pressure. This can lead to the further depletion of land
    available for crop production. These problems are caused mainly by agricultural
    practices and often occur in areas where irrigation is used to farm infertile
    lands with sandy and rocky soils but where the water resource is limited. In Egypt,
    salinity may be responsible for a 30% decline in crop yields (Postel, 1993). Furthermore,
    the overexploitation of aquifers, particularly in coastal regions, may lead to
    the intrusion of salt or brackish water, which reduces their use for irrigation
    and domestic consumption. This has occurred in the Lebanon (Khair et al., 1994)
    as well as along the Almería coast (Spain). Mismanaged irrigation systems have
    led to the loss of some of the most fertile and productive soils in the region
    (Abu-Zeid & Hamdy, 2002) and more innovative approaches to remediation are essential
    (Lynch & Moffat, 2005). Agricultural practices, in particular the heavy use of
    fertilisers and pesticides, can also affect drainage and groundwater quality.
    This creates problems for domestic, tourism and industrial water supplies as well
    as impacting on the value of water for irrigation. Furthermore, the sale of pesticide-contaminated
    products is difficult or impossible, especially to high-value markets. Optimisation
    of water use can be achieved by promoting water-efficient irrigation (precision
    irrigation), water-efficient agriculture (precision agriculture) and water reuse
    in agriculture, particularly the recycling of drainage water and reuse of urban
    wastewater. The options for improving irrigation water productivity, technical,
    managerial, institutional and agronomic, have been comprehensively reviewed elsewhere
    (e.g. Postel, 1993; Abu-Zeid & Hamdy, 2002). In deficit irrigation, limiting irrigation
    to critical growth stages can improve crop water-use efficiency (Oweis et al.,
    1998; Araus et al., 2002). The crop requirements for irrigation can be estimated
    from both soil and plant measurements. Plant-based direct measurements including
    relative water content, water potential, stomatal conductance, xylem abscisic
    acid content and xylem pH can all be used to effectively schedule irrigation (Lefi
    et al., 2004a,b). However, newer indirect measurements made on the whole canopy
    (e.g. infrared thermometry, thermography or chlorophyll fluorescence) are related
    to transpiration, leaf cooling and stomatal conductance and may give a better
    measure of canopy water status than individual plant measurements and be more
    useful in scheduling irrigation than decisions based on individual plant measurements
    (Jones et al., 2002; Cifre et al., 2005). The development of biosensors, ‘smart’
    plants that report their water physiological status, is a realistic and achievable
    goal (Day, 2005). However, many of these methods are labour intensive or require
    equipment and education that may not be available to small farmers who will rely
    on more empirical approaches. In addition, where water availability is limited,
    political and social decisions are critical because spreading the water too thinly
    decreases harvest index and yield. Therefore, for annual crops, focusing the available
    water supply to adequately supply a restricted area may give the greatest benefit.
    While this is also true for perennial crops, their long-term survival is a critical
    consideration in longer term sustainability. A new irrigation technique where
    different sides of the root system are irrigated alternately (partial root-zone
    irrigation or partial root-zone drying) has sometimes improved both the water-use
    efficiency and the harvest index and yield of important Mediterranean crops, for
    example, grapevines (Santos et al., 2003; de Souza et al., 2003), orange trees
    (Loveys & Davies, 2004) and tomato (Davies et al., 2000; Mingo et al., 2003).
    In addition, in some cases the quality of the harvested product has also improved
    (Davies et al., 2000; Kang & Zhang, 2004). Further analysis is however necessary
    to determine the general utility of this approach. Many of the irrigation technologies
    and management strategies are already available for sustainable production (Bhattarai
    et al., 2004). While many components are generic, the most successful solution
    will take into account local components (climate, soil types, salt content, crop
    water requirements, etc.). However, the adoption of such strategies by farmers
    is patchy. Further research into the socio-economic factors that hinder the adoption
    of new methodologies is essential and should be given high priority because failure
    to adopt best practices will endanger long-term sustainability. This should be
    linked to the development of multifaceted regional water management models that
    balance and address the needs of all parties in society (Araus, 2004). Plant breeding
    and biotechnology Plant breeding aims to ensure that water is used more efficiently
    by increasing the water-use efficiency (yield of product/water consumed) of crops.
    Plant breeding has the potential to deliver HSYD but requires the identification
    of key traits and their incorporation into high-yielding varieties using conventional
    or biotechnological tools (Slafer, 2003; Reynolds et al., 2005a). Conventional
    plant breeding so far only increased the yield of crops grown under drought at
    about half the rate achieved for crops grown in temperate regions (Turner, 2004a,b).
    Crop response to stress is dependant on numerous traits many of which are constitutive
    and expressed irrespective of water availability, but such constitutive traits
    may also be modified by stress. Directed breeding strategies must focus on the
    key traits important to performance under drought stress [e.g. phenology, rapid
    establishment, early vigour, root density and depths, low and high temperature
    tolerance, 13C discrimination (a measure of the extent to which photosynthesis
    is maintained while stomatal conductance decreases), root conductance, osmoregulation,
    low stomatal conductance, leaf posture, habit, reflectance and duration, sugar
    accumulation in stems to support later growth of yield components]. Importantly,
    survival traits as opposed to production traits will only be relevant in perennial
    crops and some herbaceous annuals growing in the most extreme environments to
    ensure survival and should not be a major focus unless they have particular socio-economic
    value (Clary et al., 2004). Survival traits are negatively correlated with productivity
    and do not provide HSYD (Mitra, 2001). Breeding programmes should focus on integrative
    traits that impact over a long duration of the cropping period. Some traits for
    higher yield may in fact decrease yield stability (e.g. longer growth period),
    whereas others are less likely to have this penalty (e.g. increased harvest index).
    Attention should focus on traits that will maintain or increase yield stability
    in addition to yield per se. Full consideration must be given to other traits
    that limit performance because overcoming losses due to pests and diseases may
    offer the greatest return particularly in the short term (Nigam et al., 2005).
    In some crops (e.g. potato), natural biodiversity is underexploited (Gur & Zamir,
    2004; Latha et al., 2004), but in others (e.g. wheat), prolonged periods of inbreeding
    may have decreased the available biodiversity. For such major crops with limited
    variability, attempts to increase the genetic variability (methods for the rapid
    introgression of traits from diverse germplasm or wild relatives) are needed as
    well as methods for the generation of novel diversity such as chemical or radiation
    mutagenesis. One powerful method is TILLING (targeting-induced local lesions in
    genomes) that allows the generation of targeted mutations, allowing gene candidates
    discovered by genomics-based experimentation to be used to directly alter trait
    components (Henikoff & Comai, 2003; Till et al., 2003a,b). Because these techniques
    do not involve the generation of transgenic plants, lines with improved characteristics
    can be used immediately by plant breeders and adopted by farmers with little regulatory
    impediment. When applied to elite cultivars, TILLING in particular appears to
    have great potential, and future research effort should be directed towards undertaking
    this in important Mediterranean crops. However, biotechnology may also play an
    important role, particularly in targeting transcription factors that determine
    gene expression. An oversimplistic appreciation of how growth, metabolism and
    development in plants are regulated in response to drought has led to unrealistic
    expectations for crop improvement. Drought tolerance is an extremely complex multigenetic
    trait. Plants have developed a variety of developmental and metabolic strategies
    for balancing the needs of growth and reproduction with resistance to diverse
    stresses (biotic, nutritional and abiotic). It is therefore vital to consider
    yield performance under drought in this wider context but difficult to identify
    and target selection criteria for specific drought-tolerance strategies that ensure
    higher and more stable yields. Attempts to improve crops on the basis of physiological
    trait analysis criteria have greatly improved our understanding of physiological
    processes but with few exceptions (e.g. carbon isotope discrimination) thus far
    contributed little to crop improvement (Araus et al., 2003; Flexas et al., 2004a,b;
    Forster et al., 2004; Lefi et al., 2004a,b; Slafer et al., 2005). Nevertheless,
    there can be no doubt that in the longer term, an improved understanding of the
    mechanisms (both developmental and metabolic) behind HSYD and the efficient use
    of water by plants will be an essential prerequisite to crop improvement. Understanding
    the mechanisms controlling the growth of plants subjected to limited water is
    essential to achieving stable yield under drought. The identification of xylem
    pH as an early signal of water availability together with the inhibition of growth
    by ethylene should be further examined and exploited in crop improvement programmes.
    These and other mechanisms have been extensively reviewed elsewhere (Chaves &
    Oliviera, 2004). In recent years, the genetic characterisation of segregating
    populations from various species including maize, sorghum, rice, wheat and barley
    has enabled the identification and mapping of both individual genes and quantitative
    trait loci (QTLs) for yield components under drought stress (Hayward et al., 1994;
    Lebreton et al., 1995; Forster et al., 2004; Lafitte et al., 2004; Talaméet al.,
    2004). QTLs have now been identified for phenology, plant architecture, plant
    development, abscisic acid accumulation, photosynthetic parameters, chlorophyll
    amount, water-use efficiency, 13C discrimination and water status (Forster et
    al., 2004). While significant yield QTLs have been identified in various mapping
    populations, there is not yet strong evidence to show how robust these are when
    transferred into different genetic backgrounds and in particular elite lines or
    applied to drought experienced in different environments (Campos et al., 2004).
    The testing in different environments is critical because QTLs associated with
    water use often show low heritability. This may reflect inherent variability or
    that properties that are critical in one drought environment may not be in another.
    Once a QTL has been unambiguously established, the identification of the genes
    underlying the QTL is a major step towards understanding the molecular basis for
    the response (Cattivell et al., 2002). This information allows strategies to be
    developed that may alter the expression of the gene in the elite line (e.g. by
    tilling), use of transgenics or marker-assisted integration or even by altering
    agronomic practices. The transfer of the genes that govern traits to elite lines
    should not be a technological obstacle (Ye et al., 2000). However, if very large
    numbers of genes must be introduced, controlling successfully their expression
    will pose new technical obstacles. Attempts to improve crops by marker-assisted
    selection for yield, performance under drought, as well as for other QTLs have
    yet to contribute significantly to crop improvement. However, it is probable that
    the importance of markers linked to QTLs for HSYD and phenotypic selection will
    increase in breeding programmes. The similarity in the organisation of genes found
    in different species, known as synteny (Dicks et al., 2000 (http://www.nrp.org.uk/enews/edpsynteny.htm),
    may also allow knowledge to be transferred between crops. In addition, further
    advances in bioinformatics are needed to identify and develop linkages between
    different types of data available (Mayes et al., 2005). However, this will require
    highly robust and well-tested biological models for the effects of drought to
    be developed. Traditionally, the positional cloning of the genes underlying QTLs
    has been both time consuming and labour intensive. Further genetic analysis of
    drought tolerance is now feasible using genome-scale transcriptional profiles
    using microarrays based on plant genomic and cDNA sequences (Seki et al., 2002;
    Watkinson et al., 2003). These methods allow the identification of candidate genes
    that respond to drought in a range of environmental conditions and genetic contexts.
    These drought-responsive genes are candidates that may be involved in the processes
    producing QTLs (QTL analysis). The rapid mapping of these genes may also identify
    them as candidates for the specific gene or genes underlying the QTL itself. However,
    QTLs and molecular markers are not yet available for some crops of regional importance
    and further research is needed (also genomics resources are not available for
    many of these crops). The performance of a genotype often varies widely in different
    environments (e.g. DeLacy et al., 1990; Annicchiarico, 1997). This variability
    contributes much to the temporal and spatial instability in crop yields (http://www.fao.org/documents/show_cdr.asp?url_file=/DOCREP/005/Y4391E/Y4391E00.HTM).
    While the presence of strong genotype × environment interactions can hinder, crop
    improvement also offers the opportunity to select genotypes specifically adapted
    to deliver stable yields in specific regions (Ceccarelli, 1996). A more fundamental
    understanding of genotype × environment interactions is necessary to determine
    the potential opportunities and disadvantages of specific characteristics (Reynolds
    et al., 2005b). The assessment and detailed analysis of genotypes in multienvironment
    trials is to be encouraged. Agricultural biotechnology has yet to produce a commercial
    cultivar with HSYD. This may reflect the lack of investment by multinational companies
    who have chosen to focus on pest and disease resistance rather than combating
    drought stress. Nevertheless, despite the widespread recognition that HSYD is
    a multigenic trait, the expectations for biotechnological solutions have largely
    been unrealistic. Many of the genes that are known to respond to drought stress
    have been identified and manipulated, the majority of which protect and maintain
    cellular structure and function. These manipulations have been comprehensively
    reviewed by Araus et al. (2003) and Wang et al. (2003). Briefly, there are a wide
    range of targets including genes that are involved in the biosynthesis of osmolytes
    [e.g. mannitol, fructans, trehalose, ononitol, proline, glycinebetaine (Ramanjulu
    & Bartels, 2002)], or related to scavenging active oxygen [e.g. aldehyde dehydrogenase
    (Sunkar et al., 2003)]. Some genes also encode molecular chaperones (LEA; Figueras
    et al., 2004), signalling molecules (MAPKK, SnRK1), or transporters (aquaporins;
    Aharon et al., 2003; Uehlein et al., 2003) or transcription factors, for example,
    CBF/DREB (Liu et al., 1998; Hsieh et al., 2002) and ABF/ABAE; (Schöffl et al.,
    1998; Choi et al., 2000; Shinozaki & Yamaguchi-Shinozaki, 2000). Most of these
    studies were undertaken in model species; some have now been transferred to crop
    plants, but few of these have been evaluated in field trials under real drought
    conditions (Dunwell, 2000). Furthermore, while many authors report substantially
    increased drought tolerance (Table 1), unfortunately the experimental designs
    are often flawed and conclusions naive or relate solely to survival traits. Thus,
    many of the single-gene transformations claimed to improve drought tolerance adversely
    affected productivity. Table 1. Examples of transgenic plants reporting effects

    with increased drought tolerance Cheng et al., 2002 In fact, and perhaps with
    the exception of transporters and transcription factors, all the genes thus far
    manipulated relate to protection of primary metabolism (i.e. scavenging of oxygen
    species to prevent oxidation and regulate senescence and programmed cell death,
    osmolytes to preserve turgor and hence the basic cell structure, chaperones to
    stabilise vital proteins, etc.). However, ecophysiological studies clearly demonstrate
    that protection of metabolism is only required under severe drought conditions,
    in which photosynthesis and growth had already been severely impaired (Flexas
    et al., 2004b). Therefore, manipulation of such genes, while conferring protection
    for survival, is unlikely to result in increased yield under drought, except perhaps
    indirectly, that is, by increasing survival and hence maintaining plants alive
    at late stages of development, thereby allowing improved allocation to reproductive
    organs, which are often the harvestable part of the crop. Suggested future directions
    in biotechnology The major focus should be to improve crop yield by increasing
    carbon gain during the crop cycle under drought. It is therefore necessary to
    target genes that increase water-use efficiency without yield penalties. This
    may be actually difficult because improving water-use efficiency is usually accompanied
    by decreased photosynthesis (Flexas et al., 2004a) and yield (Condon et al., 2004).
    This negative relationship is illustrated by 1Fig. 1. A given genotype (G1) can
    move ‘phenotypically’ (i.e. depending on the water availability) along the ‘A’
    curve. Because water-use efficiency is the first derivative of the curve (i.e.
    the quotient between outputs and inputs), it is clear that moving horizontally
    (i.e. following the relationship ‘A’) towards higher photosynthesis results in
    decreasing efficiency, while moving towards saving water necessarily results in
    decreased photosynthesis. Up to now, breeding has been limited to moving plants
    ‘genotypically’ along the same curve (Condon et al., 2004). For example, genotypes
    with early vigour or deeper roots (G2) expend a larger part of their cycle using
    available water, which results in higher yields (high photosynthesis) but lower
    leaf-level water-use efficiency. On the contrary, breeding towards higher water-use
    efficiency (e.g. through screening for low 13C discrimination) has often lead
    to constitutively low productivity (G3). Clearly, improving leaf water-use efficiency
    will only be achieved when a genotype G1 is converted into a G4 genotype with
    higher photosynthesis at any transpiration rate (i.e. curve ‘B’). Thus far, most
    transformation efforts (Table 1) have targeted genes that operate only in the
    situation indicated by an asterisk in Fig. 1. Figure 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    The relationship between photosynthesis and stomatal conductance in plants. Converting
    a genotype G1 into G2 will increase photosynthesis but decrease water-use efficiency.
    Conversely, converting a genotype G1 into G3 will increase water-use efficiency
    but decrease photosynthesis. Achieving a G4 genotype with higher water-use efficiency
    and high photosynthesis requires ‘moving’ curve ‘A’ towards curve ‘B’. This can
    only be achieved through (a) CO2 concentrating mechanisms, (b) increased mesophyll
    conductance to CO2 or (c) increased Rubisco specificity factor (see text for details).
    The strength of the relationship between photosynthesis and stomatal conductance
    has been confirmed by analysing its natural inter- and intraspecific variability
    (Flexas et al., 2002; Medrano et al., 2002; Hetherington & Woodward, 2003). Nevertheless,
    there is a substantial opportunity to reach the goal of obtaining genotypes with
    improved photosynthesis at a given stomatal conductance. This can be achieved
    by genotypes using CO2 at the carboxylation sites more efficiently or able to
    concentrate CO2 at the carboxylation site, or both. The former can be achieved
    through a Rubisco with increased specificity for CO2. The latter can be met through
    carbon concentration mechanisms, like those found in C4 plants, or improved internal
    diffusion of CO2 (increased mesophyll conductance). The utility of this approach
    is clearly demonstrated by the greater water-use efficiency found in C4 as compared
    to C3 plants. Some elegant biotechnological approaches are seeking to exploit
    the introduction of genes for all the steps of C4 metabolism into single cells
    within leaves of C3 plants (Leegood, 2002). Even if all the steps are introduced
    and are functional in the leaves of C3 plants, it seems unlikely that water-use
    efficiency will be significantly improved without additional structural changes.
    Increasing the mesophyll conductance to CO2 through biotechnology is not yet achievable
    because the mechanisms responsible are not fully understood. However, recent reports
    that suggest the involvement of aquaporins in mesophyll conductance to CO2 (Uehlein
    et al., 2003; Hanba et al., 2004; J. Flexas, unpublished results) may open this
    possibility in the near future. An alternative strategy to improve water-use efficiency
    would be to generate C3 crop plants expressing an improved form of Rubisco, with
    high specificity factor and catalytic rate (Spreitzer & Salvucci, 2002; Parry
    et al., 2003). Exploiting existing variability in Rubisco specificity factor among
    C3 plants appears a promising way to obtain genetically modified (GM) crops with
    improved yield under drought (Galmés et al., 2005). It has been argued that because
    increased specificity factor is usually accompanied by low maximum catalytic rates
    of the enzyme (Bainbridge et al., 1995), such changes will result in little photosynthetic
    improvement with increasing specificity (Zhu et al., 2004). While this may be
    true under conditions where plants can express their maximum catalytic rates,
    this does not apply under conditions of severely restricted availability of the
    substrate CO2, such as under drought stress. Thus, increased specificity may result
    in improved photosynthesis even if maximum catalytic rates are lowered. While
    these approaches are certainly scientifically sound, there are still numerous
    obstacles to overcome before they can be exploited (Parry et al., 2003; Mitchell
    et al., 2004). A gene that directly regulates plant transpiration efficiency has
    been recently reported (Masle et al., 2005). This is the Arabidopsis ERECTA gene,
    a putative leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase. While the mechanisms are
    not yet fully understood, expression of the ERECTA gene, high photosynthetic rate
    and a low stomatal conductance results in higher water-use efficiency irrespective
    of water availability. In addition, to the above-mentioned potential targets,
    proper consideration must be given to other traits that affect phenology and development
    and that can be more easily engineered to optimise performance under drought.
    To date, these have been largely ignored in relation to drought, despite the fact
    that traditional breeding has actually achieved its best results through selection
    for phonological rather than physiological traits (Condon et al., 2004). Considerable
    further research and critical analysis based on more than limited laboratory studies
    is needed to confirm the promise and utility of the results. In some cases, gene
    pyramiding may be required (Reynolds et al., 2005a). The exploitation of biotechnology
    to address this major problem is now approaching a critical phase with respect
    to practical application. It is vital that the longer term potential of the technology
    is not oversold, alienating intended beneficiaries (investors, politicians, farmers
    and consumers). If confirmed, the technology is available to readily transfer
    genes to elite cultivars of most of the major crops [e.g. maize (Ishida et al.,
    1996), rice (Hiei et al., 1994) and wheat (Pastori et al., 2001; Sparks et al.,
    2001). However, the technology is not yet available for some crops of regional
    importance and further underpinning research in this area is needed. But the low
    acceptability of GM crops to consumers and some politicians in Europe and some
    developing countries will, at least in the short term, limit the impact that they
    can have (Halford, 2004). Conclusions An integrated systems approach is essential
    in the study of complex quantitative traits like yield stability under drought
    stress in plants (2Fig. 2). The research must use the latest genomics resources
    combining the new technologies in quantitative genetics, genomics and biomathematics
    with an ecophysiological understanding of the interactions between crop plant
    genotypes and the growing environment and thus better inform crop improvement
    (Hawkesford & Buchner, 2001; Araus et al., 2003; Araus, 2004). Most current research
    programmes lack this necessary interdisciplinary approach. Such co-ordination
    of the various concepts and use of methods is particularly appropriate for the
    European Union (EU) projects, and the clustering of these projects should yield
    substantial added value. In addition, the researchers need to engage more effectively
    with policy makers and socio-economists to explain the importance and urgency
    of research on this topic. Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Plant responses

    SHARE Abstract Dwindling water supplies, increasing drought frequency and uncertainties
    associated with a changing climate mean Europe''s irrigated agriculture sector
    needs to improve water efficiency and produce more ''crop per drop''. This paper
    summarizes the drivers for change, and the constraints and opportunities for improving
    agricultural water management through uptake of precision irrigation technologies.
    A multi-disciplinary and integrated approach involving irrigation engineers, soil
    scientists, agronomists and plant physiologists will be needed if the potential
    for precision irrigation within the field crop sector is to be realized. © 2013
    Society of Chemical Industry Introduction In many European river basins where
    irrigated agriculture is concentrated, there is increasing competition for water.1
    Climate change threatens to exacerbate the situation with a reduction in resource
    availability,2 a wider spectrum of crop production risks3 and an increase in agricultural
    water demand.4 Despite its economic importance, the sustainability of irrigated
    production is under threat due to increasing water scarcity5 and concerns regarding
    the impact of over-abstraction on the environment.6 The total irrigated area in
    Europe is 12 × 106 ha, which represents 5% of the global irrigated area.7 Irrigation
    water demand varies depending on temporal and spatial variations in soils and
    agroclimate, crop requirement and access to water resources of appropriate quality.
    For Europe as a whole, irrigation accounts for 24% of abstractions,6 but in central
    and northern Europe are typically small (<5% of total abstractions), although
    they can still can have significant environmental impacts, particularly in drier
    catchments in the driest months and driest years when resources are most constrained.
    Here supplemental irrigation is used, most notably on high-value field-scale (outdoor)
    horticulture, where it serves to maximize yield and quality of fruit and vegetables
    for retailers (supermarkets) and processors.8 In contrast, in parts of Mediterranean
    Europe, irrigation accounts for over 80% of total abstractions6 and is used in
    intensive and extensive cropping, including field and protected horticulture.
    Clearly, securing adequate water for agriculture will be essential to meet future
    food demands for a growing population. Any changes in water allocation should
    account for the multifunctional nature and diversity of benefits that agriculture
    provides in addition to food production.3 Agriculture in Europe, like other parts
    of the world, faces a major challenge: supplying more food to meet increasing
    demands while simultaneously reducing its environmental impact.9 Under a scenario
    of reduced water availability, increasing drought frequency and uncertainties
    associated with a changing climate, Europe''s irrigated agriculture sector needs
    to do more with less. This implies a need to increase water productivity (t−1 ha−1).
    Although irrigation has been practised for centuries, only recently has the sector
    had to respond to societal demands for reductions in water allocation and improvements
    in efficiency. A major gap still exists between research and on-farm irrigation
    practice, which is reflected in large differences between actual and potential
    yield: the ''yield gap''.5 In most cases, such gaps can be attributed to suboptimal
    management, inappropriate technology and/or lack of training. In this context,
    precision irrigation, defined as site-specific irrigation management that relies
    on the variable application of water (adapted from Cassman10), emerges as a potential
    solution to increase the productivity, and reduce the environmental impact, of
    irrigated agriculture. A committed international effort will be needed to implement
    technologies that are appropriate for different farming systems to reduce both
    water and energy use, while improving crop yield and quality. This paper discusses
    the drivers for change and highlights the constraints and opportunities for improving
    agricultural water management through precision irrigation. Drivers For Change
    Agricultural intensification has required growers to become more specialized and
    for many growers an investment in irrigation has provided the basis for increasing
    profitability. Rising labour and energy costs, coupled with consumer demands for
    premium quality, mean farmers now have to consider the impacts of non-uniformity
    of irrigation application on crop yield and, particularly, quality. For some crops,
    such as potatoes, the size, colour, shape and skin finish of the harvested product
    all impact on price and marketability. Quality criteria are increasingly specified
    as a condition of contract and sale, and failure to meet quality standards can
    lead to large price discounting, and possibly to rejection and loss of contract.
    In high-value sectors such as salads the premia are high and it can be difficult
    to secure contracts without guaranteed access to irrigation. Crop assurance schemes
    are also playing a key role in promoting precision irrigation since these require
    growers to manage and audit irrigation practices and links these to traceability
    and accountability in support of public health and environmental protection regulation.
    European irrigated agriculture also needs to respond to environmental regulation
    challenges – most notably through the Water Framework Directive (WFD 2000/60/E).
    The WFD provides the major driver for achieving sustainable water management across
    all EU member states.11 It applies to all fresh waters and includes aims to tackle
    diffuse pollution ranging from fertilizer and pesticide applications in irrigated
    agriculture to urban run-off. owing to their dependence on fertilizers, irrigated
    farms need to ensure that diffuse pollution does not contribute to water pollution
    at the catchment scale. Here precision irrigation could play an important role
    in mitigating such risks by matching irrigation to soil type, its inherent permeability
    and nutrient retention capacity and by using liquid fertilizer matched with variable
    irrigation applications. The rising cost of fertilizer will also act as an industry
    incentive to match inputs to plant growth and requirement. Reduced water availability
    and reliability for irrigation abstraction are also likely to be important drivers
    for change, as member states implement new abstraction control measures. In some
    countries, abstraction regimes are already in place, but in others new frameworks
    for abstraction regulation need to be implemented.12 In future, farmers will need
    to demonstrate more efficient and sustainable use of water to secure rights (permits)
    for irrigation abstraction1 and to comply with industry protocols regarding food
    safety and crop assurance.13 Developing innovative approaches to combine better
    spatial and temporal knowledge of soil properties, crop requirements and improved
    equipment practices are prerequisites for improving water productivity through
    precision irrigation – whether driven by market, regulatory or public demands
    for greater environmental sustainability. Constraints And Opportunities On most
    farms, making best use of stored soil moisture and rainfall, knowing precisely
    where and when irrigation has to be applied, and then applying it accurately and
    uniformly, are fundamental steps in the pathway to water efficiency.1 Although
    irrigation is usually justified by increased production, there is growing evidence
    that optimized irrigation regimes under temperate and humid conditions can also
    lead to improved post-harvest quality, resulting in reduced crop waste through
    the food supply chain. Presently, farmers are restricted in their ability to match
    the timing and frequency of irrigation applications to inherent spatial and temporal
    variations in soil moisture and crop growth. They generally have only limited
    information on plant water status, rely on limited in situ point measurements
    of soil as a proxy for field-scale soil moisture availability, and use outdated
    irrigation application systems that lack the necessary flexibility and control
    for variable water application. A combination of improved application technology,
    monitoring systems and understanding of crop responses will be needed to enable
    growers to utilize precision irrigation in field crops for commercial and environmental
    benefit. A brief perspective of the innovations in relevant technologies is given
    below. The paper focuses specifically on outdoor field-scale production where
    most water in agriculture is abstracted and used; precision irrigation for indoor
    (protected) production systems is also important, but is not specifically considered
    here. Developing variable-rate irrigation technology Most of the land irrigated
    in Europe relies on overhead irrigation, using sprinklers, high-pressure rain
    guns, centre pivots or booms. These can be inefficient in both energy and water
    use. There is a tendency to view micro (drip or trickle) irrigation as the solution
    to improving water efficiency, which partially explains why micro irrigation has
    been heavily promoted, often by regulators and governments. Compared to traditional
    surface methods, trickle irrigation offers the potential for much greater water
    use efficiency,14 though the benefits against good overhead irrigation are smaller.
    Despite higher costs, trickle is an attractive option in regions where water resources
    are scarce and/or expensive. Globally, micro irrigation accounts for less than
    5% of all irrigated farmland.7 In Europe, the proportion is not dissimilar; the
    dominance of low-value irrigated production having contributed to a relatively
    slow rate of growth but there are notable exceptions, such as in Spain (28%) and
    Italy (14%). Precision irrigation through the subdivision of control zones and
    increasingly sophisticated electronic controllers may provide the way forward
    there. Wider user of micro irrigation is limited beyond arid areas by the cost
    of installing and operating systems around sequential plantings, rotational cropping
    and sporadic uses where irrigation is supplementary. Indeed, many growers in such
    areas are reconsidering sprinkler systems as an alternative to micro (drip) irrigation,
    using semi-permanent (seasonal) solid-set systems rather than conventional portable
    systems. It is likely that the greatest short-term improvements in water efficiency
    there will be achieved through developing precision irrigation for overhead systems.
    Most overhead irrigation technologies used in field-scale agriculture fail to
    apply the same depth of water across a field uniformly. Sprinkler irrigation systems
    are adversely affected by pressure variation along and between laterals and, due
    to ground slopes, inadequate overlap of the application patterns between sprinklers
    and wind distortion.15 Similarly, hose reel systems fitted with guns, which account
    for most agricultural irrigation in northern Europe, are notoriously susceptible
    to wind.16 Hose reel systems using booms, which are increasingly popular for field-scale
    horticultural irrigation, provide more uniform application than guns but are still
    sensitive to pressure variation, inconsistent pull-in speed and wind distortion.
    None of the current systems provides sufficient flexibility to cope with spatially
    varying water application. Combining the technologies for individually valved
    sprinklers and computer control developed within the sports turf (golf) industry
    with semi-permanent solid-set sprinkler systems offers great potential to produce
    a cost-effective and highly controllable method of applying water variably across
    a field with controlled volumes applied to individual cropping zones. Optimization
    of which sprinklers operate simultaneously will also allow smaller pipe sizes
    and operating pressure, thus reducing capital and/or pumping (energy) costs. A
    number of researchers have tested variable applications systems using centre pivot
    systems on field crops.17 To date, centre pivot systems have been the focus of
    much of the variable-rate technology research given their ease and suitability
    for installing spatial crop-monitoring equipment and for modifying sprinkler discharge
    packages. The transfer of such technology into portable overhead systems, including
    sprinklers and hose reels fitted with booms, is technically possible but implementation
    of precision irrigation requires a greater understanding of heterogeneity of irrigation
    need across a field. Understanding heterogeneity of soil water content across
    a field The capability of adding variable volumes of irrigation needs to be matched
    to an understanding of the variability of soil and soil water content across a
    field.5 Yield mapping and/or traditional soil sampling can help identify different
    soil zones, and it is now possible to map spatial soil variability using electromagnetic
    induction (EMI) or near-infrared (NIR) systems on a field scale. Researchers are
    also using satellite imagery and imaging devices mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles
    (UAV) over larger areas. The greatest efficiency gains from variable-rate irrigation
    will be realized where growers know how little water they can apply without impacting
    on the commercial return from their crop. This requires an understanding of the
    level of water ''stress'' the plant is experiencing and the critical level of
    stress for onset of yield or quality responses. Increasingly, growers are relying
    on soil moisture sensors, utilizing a range of technologies, each with relative
    advantages and disadvantages.18 In general, they only measure soil moisture status
    near to the sensor and, in order to understand the irrigation requirement across
    a field, particularly where soil properties are heterogeneous, multiple readings
    or networks of sensors will be needed. With the increasing availability of cheap
    soil moisture sensors and low-energy data logging/transmission has come the possibility
    of semi-permanent sensor arrays in situ generating real-time soil water data.19
    Knowing where to place the sensors then becomes a critical question (which may
    be solved through identifying areas of a field that have different water-holding
    properties). Using crop sensors to match irrigation to crop needs Monitoring soil
    moisture status is a proxy for measuring plant water status, with the underlying
    assumption that soil moisture content correlates to some extent with plant water
    status.20 However, plants are plastic in their response to reduced water availability,
    changing root and shoot growth, and the relationship between soil water status
    and the threshold for irrigation is not constant through crop development. If
    it were possible to routinely schedule irrigation from plant responses rather
    than direct measurements of soil water status, this may allow greater precision
    in matching irrigation quantity to crop need. Potentially useful plant responses
    to water stress have been well reviewed;21 these include measures of diurnal tissue
    expansion, tissue water content sensors, relative growth rates, sap flow and stomatal
    conductance. To date, physiological responses have been used to supplement knowledge
    for irrigation scheduling predominantly in production in semi-arid environments
    with little or no rainfall, e.g. tree crops,22 vines23 and glasshouse crops.24
    This approach can also be moved from the whole plant to the whole field or crop
    scale with the development of high-resolution and high-frequency remote sensing
    (e.g. MODIS) technology which can monitor spatial changes in crop cover, informing
    growers on variation in crop water use and evapotranspiration.7 Novel irrigation
    management: regulated deficit irrigation and partial root drying Precision irrigation
    also has the potential to be used in new irrigation management techniques that
    manipulate plant growth rather than just prevent the crop from being exposed to
    a level of water stress that leads to economic loss. It is well known that roots
    in drying soil generate abscisic acid (ABA) and this is one of the pathways controlling
    stomatal aperture.25 By manipulating soil water content in the root zone, crop
    transpiration can be manipulated through ABA-mediated stomatal closure following
    transient drought stress imposed at stages in the crop cycle, known as regulated
    deficit irrigation (RDI) or through alternating portions of the root zone that
    dry down, termed partial root zone drying (PRD) . These techniques have been successfully
    implemented in tree fruit26 and vine crops27 with some commercial success in South
    America, southern Europe and Australia, and work through reducing leaf growth,
    redirecting resources to fruit growth and/or increasing radiation interception
    by the fruit.28 However, techniques designed to increase ABA signalling by exposing
    crops to periods of drought stress are more difficult to implement with field
    vegetable crops such as lettuce29 that rely on an increase in leaf biomass for
    yield increases. However, drying soil can stimulate deeper rooting30 and there
    may be benefits in reduced irrigation at the early, less yield-sensitive, stages
    of crops that produce deeper-rooting plants, enabling access to water lower in
    the soil profile and conferring greater resilience to midsummer drought events.
    Another area of plant physiological response to managed water stress is that of
    improved post-harvest quality, for example, water deficit imposed close to head
    maturity improved broccoli head colour and stem turgor and subsequent post-harvest
    quality.31 Benefits are also reported in lettuce, where long-term mild deficit
    treatments produced lettuces less prone to post-harvest enzymatic browning.32
    In contrast, post-harvest quality decreased in stored onions where deficit treatments
    were imposed during bulbing.33 There are also biochemical changes that may improve
    human nutritive value which are associated with water stress, such as increased
    content of bioactive compounds in cabbage,34 broccoli35 and lettuce.36 Nevertheless,
    the physiological and biochemical mechanisms underlying post-harvest benefits
    are not well understood and further work is needed in this area to quantify these
    potential benefits. Summary And Way Forward Water is becoming an increasingly
    scarce resource and a limiting factor in intensive production of irrigated field
    vegetable crops, both in supplementary and continuous irrigation systems. There
    is pressure on growers from governments and the supply chain to maximize the commercial
    utilization of irrigation water by the crop. Precision irrigation may offer a
    solution but there are a number of challenges that need to be addressed before
    the benefits of this approach will be realized practically. Current research demonstrates
    that there is potential for significant improvements for irrigated field crops
    in both water use efficiency and crop quality. This may be achieved through managing
    water use by variable-rate application aligned with a greater understanding of
    heterogeneity of soil water distribution. A multidisciplinary research approach
    involving irrigation engineers, soil scientists, agronomists and plant physiologists
    will be needed to realize the potential of precision irrigation in field crops.

    \ the challenge of feeding a growing population with limited or depleting\nfresh\
    \ water resources. Advances in irrigation systems and technologies allow site-speciﬁc\
    \ application\nof irrigation water within the ﬁeld to improve water use efﬁciency\
    \ or reduce water usage for\nsustainable crop production, especially in arid and\
    \ semi-arid regions. This paper discusses recent\ndevelopment of variable-rate\
    \ irrigation (VRI) technologies, data and information for VRI application,\nand\
    \ impacts of VRI, including proﬁtability using this technology, with a focus on\
    \ agronomic factors\nin precision water management. The development in sprinkler\
    \ systems enabled irrigation application\nwith greater precision at the scale\
    \ of individual nozzle control. Further research is required to evaluate\nVRI\
    \ prescription maps integrating different soil and crop characteristics in different\
    \ environments.\nOn-farm trials and whole-ﬁeld studies are needed to provide support\
    \ information for practical\nVRI applications. Future research also needs to address\
    \ the adjustment of the spatial distribution of\nprescription zones in response\
    \ to temporal variability in soil water status and crop growing conditions,\n\
    which can be evaluated by incorporating remote and proximal sensing data. Comprehensive\
    \ decision\nsupport tools are required to help the user decide where to apply\
    \ how much irrigation water at\ndifferent crop growth stages to optimize water\
    \ use and crop production based on the regional climate\nconditions and cropping\
    \ systems.\nKeywords: variable-rate irrigation; precision agriculture; irrigation\
    \ scheduling\n1. Introduction\nAgriculture is the largest consumer of the world′s\
    \ available fresh water, as plant growth largely\ndepends on the availability\
    \ of water. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO),\ncurrent\
    \ world irrigated area is approximately 300 million ha, and projection to 2050\
    \ suggests growing\nscarcities of water resources for agriculture, although water\
    \ is a renewable resource. This situation has\nampliﬁed the intensity of global\
    \ food insecurity, climate change, and poverty. The greatest challenge\nto agriculture\
    \ is to provide food and ﬁber for almost 8 billion people around the world in\
    \ the advent of\ndepleting freshwater resources [1].\nThe challenge is more prominent\
    \ in the arid and semi-arid regions, where underground water\nsources, especially\
    \ aquifers are used for irrigation, as rainfall provides only a portion of the\
    \ total\nrequirement for crop evapotranspiration (ET) demand [2]. Heavy irrigation\
    \ has caused rapid depletion\nof many aquifers. For instance, comparing the water\
    \ level of the Ogallala aquifer in the 1950s to that\nof 2013, in some wells,\
    \ up to 78 m of water was depleted in the Texas High Plains area [3]. This is\n\
    almost 12 times the average decline of 4.5 m for the whole area of the aquifer.\
    \ Given this depletion rate,\nscientists have predicted that 35% of the Southern\
    \ High Plains will not be able to support irrigation in\n30 years. Many other\
    \ water resources in the world are depleting rapidly in recent years with negligible\n\
    recharge, indicating the need for water conservation solutions in agriculture\
    \ [4,5]. More effective and\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87; doi:10.3390/agronomy9020087\n\

    \ of water is required to better conserve water and improve water use efﬁciency\n\
    for sustainable crop production.\nConventional farming practices manage an agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld uniformly without incorporating\nthe intrinsic variability in topography,\
    \ soil, crop growth conditions, and other agronomic factors.\nThis can result\
    \ in nutrient leaching, environmental contamination, and reduced proﬁtability\
    \ especially\nwhen applying high inputs in low yielding areas and vice versa [6,7].\
    \ Precision agriculture can be\nadopted to divide the ﬁeld into small management\
    \ units for optimized production [8]. There are\nseveral deﬁnitions for precision\
    \ agriculture, and it keeps evolving with emerging technologies and\nunderstanding\
    \ of what is achievable [9]. The idea of precision agriculture or site-speciﬁc\
    \ management\nstarted around the early 1980s with the development of various technologies\
    \ to assess ﬁeld variabilities\nsuch as soil survey, soil testing and mapping,\
    \ and crop yield monitoring [10–13]. Precision agriculture\ndepends on detailed\
    \ spatial information, information technology, greater information processing\n\
    capability, and better decision aids [14]. Precision agriculture is a management\
    \ system that measures\nand responds to the spatial and temporal variability of\
    \ soil and crop growth at the sub-ﬁeld level\nwith the aim to enhance proﬁtability\
    \ and reduce environmental impact [15,16]. Major technologies\ninvolved in precision\
    \ agriculture include geographic information systems (GIS), remote and proximal\n\
    sensing, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), yield monitoring and the variable\
    \ rate technology.\nGeoreferenced information about soil and plant characteristics\
    \ can be obtained efﬁciently using GIS,\nproximal sensors and remote sensors [17].\
    \ Application of yield monitors provides the capability to\nprecisely characterize\
    \ yield variability at large scales in the ﬁeld. Moreover, the variable rate technology\n\
    provides the ability to site-speciﬁcally apply irrigation water in the ﬁeld to\
    \ achieve potential water\nsavings [18]. This enables the timely and accurate\
    \ water application incorporating the spatial and\ntemporal soil properties and\
    \ plant demand at different growth stages [15]. In other words, the variable\n\
    rate irrigation (VRI) technology can help to apply the right amount of water in\
    \ the right area of the\nﬁeld at the right time resulting in water savings.\n\
    Recent research suggests site-speciﬁc management of water or VRI could be a solution\
    \ to conserve\nwater and improve water use efﬁciency (WUE), which is the ratio\
    \ between effective water use and\nactual water withdrawal in the ﬁeld [19]. VRI\
    \ can support water and energy conservation with a\npositive inﬂuence on crop\
    \ water productivity and the environment [20]. This is possible by applying\n\
    irrigation at rates that vary to appropriately match ﬁeld variability based on\
    \ speciﬁc water needs\nof individual management zones rather than applying a uniform\
    \ rate throughout the ﬁeld [21].\nThe magnitude of soil water content (SWC) varies\
    \ with time and location, but the pattern of spatial\nvariability usually remains\
    \ similar. This temporal stability of SWC is associated with properties of the\n\
    ﬁeld such as topography, soil texture, apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa)\
    \ and drainage patterns\nthat insigniﬁcantly change over time [22,23]. The feasibility\
    \ and effectiveness of VRI depend on the\nsize of the ﬁeld, crop species under\
    \ consideration, weather, and the underlying ﬁeld properties such as\nelevation,\
    \ slope, soil texture, and ECa that inﬂuence soil moisture content and irrigation\
    \ requirements\nfor the crop [24,25]. Hence, understanding the inﬂuence of agronomic\
    \ factors such as topography and\nsoil properties on soil water and ultimately\
    \ yield can provide a basis for application of VRI in the ﬁeld\nto achieve potential\
    \ water savings together with yield optimization.\nToday, site-speciﬁc water management\
    \ has been made easier with several precision agriculture\ntools, such as GNSS,\
    \ GIS, yield mapping, soil survey and remote sensing [26]. Several decision support\n\
    tools and strategies to reduce groundwater withdrawal without reductions in irrigated\
    \ land area or\ncrop productivity have been developed [4]. The measures to optimize\
    \ the use of irrigation water in\nthe ﬁelds include increasing weather-based irrigation\
    \ scheduling, converting gravity-based irrigation\nto center pivot irrigation,\
    \ subsurface drip irrigation, replacing high water to low water demand\ncrops,\
    \ and deﬁcit irrigation based on evapotranspiration replacement using various\
    \ water-balance\nmodels [27]. Several studies have been done to understand the\
    \ possible water savings with VRI.\nA review on VRI across different crop and\
    \ weather regimes of the world concluded that VRI could save\n10%–15% of water\
    \ [28]. Although the use of VRI seems to be a reasonable measure to improve water\n\
    Agronomy 2019, 9, 87\n3 of 21\nmanagement, many producers are reluctant to adopt\
    \ it because limited research is done at the ﬁeld scale\nto understand its reliability\
    \ and economic potential [25]. A better understanding of ﬁeld variability and\n\
    how it affects crop yield is needed for effective implementation of the new technologies.\
    \ A review for\nsite-speciﬁc sprinkler irrigation [29] focused on the technology\
    \ and challenges for adoption. Another\nreview of 20 years’ research on increasing\
    \ crop productivity with sprinkler and micro-irrigation\ndiscussed the importance\
    \ of understanding the crop response to VRI [30]. The study emphasized the\nneed\
    \ for continuous effort towards management zone delineation based on ﬁeld properties\
    \ integrated\nwith dynamic information from real-time monitoring of climatological\
    \ and crop data. However,\nthis study focused more on the technological aspect\
    \ of irrigation management than the agronomic\naspect of water conservation with\
    \ VRI. The agricultural science behind VRI is equally crucial for\nthe successful\
    \ implementation of this technology. Hence, the objective of this paper is to\
    \ review the\nscientiﬁc background and technologies in precision water management,\
    \ with the focus on agronomic\nfactors and strategies for site-speciﬁc water management.\n\
    2. Variable-Rate Irrigation Technologies\nThe irrigation system changed from gravity-based\
    \ furrow irrigation in the 1950s to sprinkler\nirrigation in late 1990s. Initially,\
    \ the high-pressure sprinkler irrigation system was available in the\n1980s which\
    \ later developed to low-pressure sprinklers and low-energy precision application\
    \ (LEPA)\nin 1990s [31–33]. About 49% of total irrigated land in the United States\
    \ is irrigated with center pivot\nsystems, out of which 44% is irrigated at low\
    \ pressure under 30 psi [34]. The basic requirements for the\nVRI technology are\
    \ sensors and spatial information, prescription maps and a system to incorporate\
    \ VRI\nprescription (e.g., LEPA, lateral irrigation, etc.) to apply in the ﬁeld\
    \ [35]. At present, there are several\nirrigation technologies for conservation\
    \ irrigation, such as sprinkler, drip, and other micro-irrigation\nsystems but\
    \ limited site-speciﬁc studies have been done [30,36–38]. For example, a study\
    \ of the\nvariable-rate drip irrigation system on vineyard found up to 17% increase\
    \ in yield and a 20% decrease\nin water consumption compared to uniform irrigation\
    \ [39]. Researchers in the UK assessed the potential\nof hose-reel boom irrigators\
    \ for precision irrigation in vegetables [40]. Automatic gravity-fed irrigation\n\
    systems in Europe decreased manual labor and supported adoption by innovative\
    \ farmers [41].\nVariable-rate irrigation using center pivot in rice showed better\
    \ performance compared to uniform\nﬂooding irrigation [42]. In this review, we\
    \ will focus more on those irrigation technologies that have\nbeen used for site-speciﬁc\
    \ water management more frequently around the world, such as variable-rate\nlateral\
    \ irrigation systems and center pivot irrigation systems.\nThe components of a\
    \ variable-rate lateral irrigation system commonly consist of a GPS or GNSS\n\
    receiver, custom software-controlled relays and valves, which can apply variable\
    \ water utilizing the\nnozzle-pulsing technique and a variable speed control system.\
    \ This system can control the irrigation\nrate and forward speed with high accuracy\
    \ [43]. Similarly, the components of a center pivot VRI system\ninclude a pivot\
    \ control panel, a VRI control panel, solenoid valves, control nodes, a GNSS system,\n\
    a variable frequency drive and a remote-control system [21]. The pivot control\
    \ regulates the operation\nand speed of the pivot, while the VRI control panel\
    \ regulates the irrigation application rate in response\nto the prescription map\
    \ and the pivot location. Solenoid valves regulate the ﬂow of sprinkler heads.\n\
    The GNSS system at the end of the center pivot provides the pivot position. The\
    \ control nodes along\nthe length of the pivot determine when the valves are open\
    \ or close. The variable frequency drive\n(VFD) helps to regulate the pressure\
    \ while instantaneously changing the rate of irrigation at different\npositions\
    \ of the ﬁeld. The VFD controls the rotation speed of the pump impeller by receiving\
    \ the input\nfrom a pressure switch installed on the pump outlet pipe. This keeps\
    \ water pressure stable within\npreset maximum and minimum thresholds and thus\
    \ saving water and energy. The remote control\nsystem allows to view and control\
    \ the center pivot and the pump from a distance via a smartphone or\na computer\
    \ using the internet [21]. Further, research and development are striving to control\
    \ irrigation\namount with VRI controllers using real-time information from plant\
    \ and soil sensors in the ﬁeld [44].\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n4 of 21\nCurrently,\
    \ several companies work on the manufacture and application of this technology.\n\
    The commercially available VRI control resolution varies with the manufacturers.\
    \ VRI systems\ncan apply zero water to speciﬁc nozzles and as much as 200% of\
    \ the standard application rate\nto other nozzles by opening or closing individual\
    \ nozzles and by changing the speed of the\npivot [45]. Some companies provide\
    \ the ability to control zones of sprinklers, while others can\ncontrol each sprinkler\
    \ independently [46]. For example, Valley (Valley, Valmont Irrigation, Valley,\
    \ NE,\nUSA) provides variable speed control and variable zone control technologies\
    \ for site-speciﬁc water\napplication. The variable speed control system uses\
    \ an advanced control panel that can slow down or\nspeed up the pivot to vary\
    \ water input in different areas (sectors) of the ﬁeld, but the overall pivot\
    \ ﬂow\nrate remains constant. This system does not need additional hardware on\
    \ the existing pivot irrigation\nsystem. The variable zone control system can\
    \ vary the speed of the center and change the application\nrate along the pivot\
    \ lateral. This system applies different irrigation depths to different areas\
    \ of the ﬁeld\nby turning sprinklers on and off for various amounts of time. Trimble\
    \ (Trimble Navigation, Sunnyvale,\nCA, USA) has developed the Irrigate-IQ Variable-Rate\
    \ Irrigation System. This system incorporates\nthe VFD and variable speed drive\
    \ (VSD) into the recent optimal ﬂow VRI that works with standard\npump equipment\
    \ on wells with limited capacity. This system is capable of individual nozzle\
    \ control,\nwhich can apply the right amount of water in the right place more\
    \ accurately [47]. Currently, it is\npossible to achieve sector control with very\
    \ small resolution, and zone control can add irrigation zones\nfurther to the\
    \ sector at the small scales of lateral spans (Figure 1) [48]. A study conducted\
    \ in Canada to\nevaluate the performance of VRI found that the accuracy of water\
    \ application was up to 90% in the\ncenter pivot system [49]. However, the performance\
    \ of these irrigation systems in ﬁeld applications is\naffected by many factors,\
    \ such as ﬁeld attributes, the spatial resolution of the sensors used in irrigation\n\
    management and temporal resolution of data inputs, as well as unexpected environmental\
    \ conditions.\nHence, adaptive irrigation management strategies and active research\
    \ support are required to enhance\nthe adoption and application of VRI [20,50].\n\

    \ Hence, it is critical\nto quantify the variability of terrain attributes and\
    \ soil properties for VRI applications.\n3.1. Topography\nTopographic variation\
    \ is a common characteristic of large agricultural ﬁelds that result in spatial\n\
    variability of soil water and ultimately crop yield [52]. Topography or terrain\
    \ has two types of attributes,\nprimary and secondary attributes [53]. Primary\
    \ attributes include elevation, slope, aspect, curvature,\nﬂow length, and upslope\
    \ contributing area. Secondary attributes are derived empirically from several\n\
    primary attributes to characterize speciﬁc processes manifesting in the landscape,\
    \ mainly including\nsediment transport index (STI), stream power index (SPI),\
    \ ﬂow direction, ﬂow accumulation, distance\nto ﬂow accumulation lines (DFL),\
    \ and wetness index [53,54]. Topographic properties affect soil physical\nand\
    \ chemical properties such as texture (sand, silt, and clay content), pH, CaCO3,\
    \ extractable Ca and\nMg, available K, base saturation, organic matter, and cation\
    \ exchange capacity (CEC). Topography also\ninﬂuences hydrologic properties and\
    \ processes and can account for up to 50% of water availability\ndifferences in\
    \ the same ﬁeld [52]. Elevation, slope and surface curvatures directly affect\
    \ inﬁltration and\nrunoff as they inﬂuence the surface and subsurface ﬂow of water\
    \ in the ﬁeld [55,56]. This can have a\nsigniﬁcant effect on crop growth and yield,\
    \ resulting in differences in crop production of up to 69% at\ndifferent positions\
    \ in the ﬁeld [57–59].\nA study conducted in central Illinois and eastern Indiana\
    \ showed that topography alone could\nexplain about 20% of yield variability [60].\
    \ Corn yield variability was consistently correlated with\nelevation and slope\
    \ in a three-year study in Southern Portugal [53]. This study showed that topographic\n\
    indices, such as distance to ﬂow accumulation lines (DFL), were negatively correlated\
    \ with yield,\nhence could be used to evaluate spatial yield variability. A research\
    \ conducted on a 7.4-ha ﬁeld in the\nSouthern High Plains of Texas showed cotton\
    \ lint yield was negatively correlated with site elevation.\nThe lint yield and\
    \ nitrogen (N) uptake was higher in bottom slope positions than in upslope, possibly\n\
    due to the accumulation of run-off water and NO3-N eroded from the upper slope\
    \ areas. However,\nthis trend depended on weather conditions. For a wet year when\
    \ there was over accumulation of water\nin bottom slopes, lower yield in bottom\
    \ slopes and higher yield in upper slopes were observed [61].\nRelative elevation\
    \ explained up to 49% of water content variation in the soil and 32% of lint yield\n\
    variation in the ﬁeld. The negative correlation between crop yield and elevation\
    \ could be in part due\nto the effect of erosion and topographical attributes\
    \ on soil properties that inﬂuence inﬁltration and\nstorage of water. Slope length\
    \ also affects crop yield by inﬂuencing N denitriﬁcation, soil N, P, K,\nCa and\
    \ Mg distributions, soil carbon storage, and nitrate distribution, as well as\
    \ the inﬁltration rate of\nwater in the ﬁeld [62].\nThe curvature of the ﬁeld\
    \ surface determines the concentration or dispersion of surface water\nin the\
    \ ﬁeld [55]. Concave surface with negative curvatures concentrates water ﬂow,\
    \ while convex\nsurface with positive curvature disperses water ﬂow [63]. For\
    \ example, SWC was found strongly\ncorrelated with soil surface curvature (r =\
    \ 0.9) [64]. Soil surface curvature can explain up to 15% of\nvariations in the\
    \ crop yield [65]. Corn yield was negatively correlated with surface curvature\
    \ in another\nresearch [53]. In this study, corn yield was 14% higher in concave\
    \ curvatures than convex areas. In a\nsix-year study [55], corn yields were negatively\
    \ correlated with elevation, slope, planar curvature and\nproﬁle curvature for\
    \ the wet years. The impact of surface curvature on crop yield also depends on\n\
    weather conditions and the location to some extent. Weather factors have the largest\
    \ effect on grain\nyield at locations with large curvature values. In some cases,\
    \ surface curvature is positively related to\ncrop yield at locations or years\
    \ with higher precipitation [60]. The magnitude of curvature also has\nan impact\
    \ on crop yield. The effect of curvature on crop yield between wet and dry years\
    \ are highly\ndifferent at locations with small curvature [66]. Hence, understanding\
    \ and incorporating topographic\nattributes of the ﬁeld, such as elevation, slope\
    \ length and aspect, surface curvature and their inﬂuence\non water dynamics can\
    \ be an important input for site-speciﬁc water management to achieve potential\n\
    water savings and optimized production.\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n6 of 21\n3.2. Soil\
    \ Properties\nSoil functions as a medium for plant growth, a regulator of water\
    \ ﬂow and nutrient cycling.\nIt is a dynamic entity where complex interactions\
    \ occur among its physical, chemical and biological\nproperties to enable these\
    \ functions [67]. Soil forming factors such as parent material, biota, topography,\n\
    climate, and time are variable in time and space and explain most of the soil\
    \ variability besides the\nmanagement induced variability [11]. Spatial variability\
    \ of chemical properties including nutrients,\norganic matter, and pH can result\
    \ in within-ﬁeld variation in available water content and crop\nproductivity [68].\
    \ Complex spatial patterns of soil physical properties also affect soil water\
    \ availability\nand rooting of a plant, resulting in variability in crop growth\
    \ and yield [69]. Soil texture, organic matter\ncontent, apparent electrical conductivity,\
    \ and biological properties are relatively stable properties of\nthe ﬁeld that\
    \ are usually considered for site-speciﬁc management of the ﬁeld.\n3.2.1. Soil\
    \ Texture\nSoil texture, the relative content of sand, silt, and clay particles,\
    \ is an important soil physical\nproperty that affects crop growth and yield.\
    \ Soil texture determines the rate at which water drains\nthrough saturated soil\
    \ and inﬂuences available water-holding capacity. Therefore, it affects the\n\
    distribution of available water for plant growth and irrigation requirements in\
    \ the ﬁeld. Fine sandy\nloams and silts tend to have the highest water-holding\
    \ capacity, while an increase in either clay\nor sand content in the soil proﬁle\
    \ decreases the water-holding capacity [70]. The matric potential\nof soil, which\
    \ depends on soil particle size, inﬂuences the availability of soil water. For\
    \ example,\nclay particles have higher matric potential and lower soil available\
    \ water compared to sand and silt\nparticles [71]. Soil texture also affects the\
    \ spatial variability of residual NO3-N and the leaching of N.\nMore residual\
    \ was found in sandy loam soils compared to loamy sand, and leaching was higher\
    \ in\nloamy sand compared to sandy loam [72]. Soil texture also affects the pore\
    \ sizes and porosity of the soil,\nwhich ultimately affects crop root growth and\
    \ yield by limiting the water available to the plant and the\ngrowth space for\
    \ the roots [73]. In general, soils with high clay content are more difﬁcult to\
    \ manage\ndue to lack of porosity and water available for plant growth. On the\
    \ other hand, well-drained soils\nhave good soil aeration for healthy root and\
    \ crop growth [74]. The clay content can also inﬂuence soil\nwater and nutrient\
    \ content and result in crop yield variability across the ﬁeld [61,75]. A study\
    \ showed\nthat clay content in the soil could explain up to 17% variability in\
    \ winter wheat yield by affecting\nthe water available in the soil for crop growth\
    \ [76]. A study conducted in the Southern High Plains\nshowed that a very sandy\
    \ soil (the Brownﬁeld soil series) with high slope consistently had low yield\n\
    when given the same amount of irrigation water, fertilizer, seed population, and\
    \ other management\npractices [56]. A cross-correlation study conducted between\
    \ cotton lint yield, soil water, clay, sand and\nelevation in a 45-ha ﬁeld in\
    \ Texas High Plains also showed that correlation among these factors varied\n\
    between 0.72 and 0.63 and cotton crop and soil physical properties could be correlated\
    \ within 60 to\n80 m across the ﬁeld [77]. In summary, soil texture inﬂuences\
    \ variability in water availability and crop\nyield, and hence should be considered\
    \ in VRI planning and implementation [78].\n3.2.2. Soil Organic Matter (SOM)\n\
    The role of SOM in VRI lies in its inﬂuence on water-holding capacity because\
    \ the afﬁnity SOM has\nfor water [74]. SOM has a positive inﬂuence on yield, and\
    \ the inﬂuence is more prominent in soils with\nlow organic matter content [60].\
    \ SOM distribution in the ﬁeld is variable depending upon topography\nand other\
    \ soil properties. Accumulation of SOM often occurs at the bottom of slopes, possibly\
    \ due to\nthe run-off of organic matter from higher areas and increased plant\
    \ growth at low-lying wet areas of the\nﬁeld [60,61]. SOM generally increases\
    \ with increasing clay content. The organic matter in ﬁne-textured\nsoils such\
    \ as clay can be two to four times that of coarse-textured sandy soils under similar\
    \ climatic\nconditions, which in turn, can inﬂuence soil water holding capacity\
    \ [79]. Therefore, understanding the\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n7 of 21\norganic matter\
    \ distribution in the ﬁeld can help in estimation of irrigation requirements for\
    \ the ﬁeld\nand hence should be incorporated in developing site-speciﬁc water\
    \ management.\n3.2.3. Soil Biological Properties\nMost site-speciﬁc studies did\
    \ not consider spatial variability of soil organisms, but recent studies\nhave\
    \ shown that the spatial distribution of soil organisms inﬂuence plant growth\
    \ and possibly yield [80].\nSpatial and temporal distribution of microorganisms\
    \ at the landscape scale is complicated by the\ninteractions among topography,\
    \ soil type and distribution of water in the ﬁeld [81]. The management\nactivity\
    \ in the ﬁeld can inﬂuence the distribution of soil biological components and\
    \ this, in turn,\naffects the efﬁciency of agricultural management [82]. The soil\
    \ has the greatest microbial diversity\namong all ecosystems that support soil\
    \ conditioning and plant growth [83]. A study conducted in\nFrance [84] showed\
    \ that microbial indicators expressed a high spatial heterogeneity at the ﬁeld\
    \ level,\nwhich masked the effects of several soil and crop management treatments.\
    \ The results also showed\nthat the spatial variability due to biological variables\
    \ was similar in magnitude as compared to that\nexhibited by physicochemical parameters,\
    \ which indicated the feasibility of site-speciﬁc management\nof biological variability\
    \ in the ﬁeld using management zones. Such site-speciﬁc management can be\neffective\
    \ since organisms such as earthworms, protozoa, nematodes, bacteria, fungi, and\
    \ different\narthropods play a vital role in soil fertility and productivity [71].\n\
    3.2.4. Apparent Soil Electrical Conductivity (ECa)\nObtaining accurate information\
    \ about the spatial and temporal variability of SWC and irrigation\nrequirements\
    \ is one of the important challenges in site-speciﬁc water management.\nECa is\
    \ a\nmeasurement of ﬁeld variability that can be applied to precise water management\
    \ because it is\neasy to measure and facilitates the spatial understanding of\
    \ the soil-water-plant relationship [85].\nECa is a function of several soil properties,\
    \ such as soil salinity, texture, bulk density, ion concentration,\ntype and amount\
    \ of clay, topsoil thickness, and water content [86]. The effect of ECa on crop\
    \ yield is\nthrough its relation to soil properties, which depends on climate,\
    \ crop type and other speciﬁc ﬁeld\nconditions [87]. In general, high ECa is associated\
    \ with high clay content in the soil [88]. For example,\na study conducted near\
    \ Lamesa, Texas, showed that in four of the six sites, shallow ECa measured\n\
    with a Veris mapping system was positively correlated with clay content. Clay\
    \ content was negatively\nrelated to shallow ECa at one site due to the low bulk\
    \ density of the calcic horizon [89]. Most of the\nresearch conducted did not\
    \ consider the spatial correlation of soil characteristics when evaluating\ntheir\
    \ distributions. However, spatial autocorrelation of soil properties can be more\
    \ important than\nsoil properties themselves in explaining ECa. Therefore, future\
    \ studies need to incorporate the\nspatial correlation of soil characteristics\
    \ in evaluating the impact of ECa on crop yield [90]. ECa has\nthe potential to\
    \ differentiate between soils when the soils have enough water content and can\n\
    be used as an indicator of SWC. In general, areas with high ECa are associated\
    \ with high water\ncontent [91]. Several studies have shown a higher correlation\
    \ of crop growth characteristics and yield\nwith ECa [92,93]. A study showed that\
    \ ECa in combination with topographic attributes and bare soil\nbrightness could\
    \ explain up to 70.1% of the variability in cotton yield [56]. Hence, understanding\
    \ the\nspatial and temporal variability of ECa provides information for site-speciﬁc\
    \ irrigation management\nfor optimized yield.\nThe association between crop yield\
    \ and soil physical and chemical properties and landscape\nprocesses provide opportunities\
    \ to improve water management at the landscape scale [61].\nSoil properties and\
    \ topography inﬂuence crop yield from microscales to watershed scales and the\n\
    magnitude of complexity increases with the scale due to an increase in soil and\
    \ topographical variability,\nas well as variability in rainfall, temperature\
    \ and other climatic factors [60]. A study showed lower\ncorn grain and stover\
    \ yield in depositional and ﬂat areas which retained water for longer periods,\n\
    and high yield at well-drained summit positions [94]. In the same research for\
    \ alfalfa and poplar,\nthe results showed higher productivity at a site with a\
    \ relatively steep slope and potentially erosive\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n8 of 21\n\
    soils. This relationship was attributed to the above-normal rainfall in both years\
    \ of study. In a six-year\nstudy to understand corn yield in relation to terrain\
    \ attributes, two years with more than normal\nprecipitation showed a positive\
    \ correlation between yield and slope. For the other four years, yield was\nnegatively\
    \ correlated with slope [55]. Crop yield in relation to soil properties and topography\
    \ depends\non different soil management and climate conditions. The correlation\
    \ was found to be stronger for\ndry years in degraded soils and attributed to\
    \ differences in water availability. This suggests that\nvariable-rate irrigation\
    \ strategies might require adjustments in different crop seasons with different\n\
    climatic and management conditions and hence more researches on VRI are needed\
    \ [95].\n4. Crop and Soil Monitoring for Precision Water Management\nWater requirement\
    \ varies with the crop and crop growth and development status, soil water status,\n\
    as well as environmental conditions. Closely monitoring soil water status, crop\
    \ growth conditions and\ntheir spatial and temporal patterns can aid in irrigation\
    \ scheduling and precise water management.\nAmong many tools, remote sensing can\
    \ serve an effective basis by providing images with spatial\nand temporal variability\
    \ of crop growth parameters and soil moisture status for input in precision\n\
    water management.\n4.1. Crop Coefﬁcient and ET\nVRI aims at increasing WUE and\
    \ stabilizing yield, which can be improved by scheduling\nthe irrigation of crops\
    \ using physical and agronomic principles in irrigation management strategy.\n\
    WUE (kg/m3) can be expressed as the ratio of the amount of target product of the\
    \ crop to the amount\nof water applied to produce that output. The amount of water\
    \ used for crop production is the amount\nrequired to overcome the water lost\
    \ by ET from plant and soil surface, and it varies spatiotemporally\naccording\
    \ to weather and vegetation cover conditions [96,97]. Climatological parameters\
    \ such as\nsolar radiation, air temperature, air humidity, wind speed, and crop\
    \ and soil water characteristics,\nincluding management and environmental aspects,\
    \ are important parameters inﬂuencing ET in\nagricultural ﬁelds. Since ET is difﬁcult\
    \ to measure, reference ET from a hypothetical grass reference\nsurface is commonly\
    \ calculated using the FAO Penman-Monteith equation based on meteorological\n\
    parameters [98]. The equation is expressed as follows,\nET0 = [0.408 ∆ (Rn − G)\
    \ + γ {900/(T + 273)} u2 (es − ea)]/[∆ + γ (1 + 0.34 u2)]\nwhere, ET0—Reference\
    \ evapotranspiration [mm day−1], Rn—Net radiation at the crop surface [MJ\nm−2\
    \ day−1], G—Soil heat ﬂux density [MJ m−2 day−1], T—Air temperature at 2 m height\
    \ [◦C],\nu2—Wind speed at 2 m height [m s−1], es—Saturation vapor pressure [kPa],\
    \ ea—Actual vapor pressure\n[kPa], es—ea saturation vapor pressure deﬁcit [kPa],\
    \ D—Slope vapor pressure curve [kPa ◦C−1],\nγ—Psychrometric constant [kPa ◦C−1].\n\
    Crop-speciﬁc evapotranspiration needs are calculated based on crop coefﬁcients\
    \ (Kc). By using\nthe FAO Penman-Monteith deﬁnition for ET0, crop coefﬁcients\
    \ at research sites could be calculated by\nrelating the measured crop evapotranspiration\
    \ (ET) with the calculated ET0, i.e., Kc = ET/ET0. The crop\ncoefﬁcient differs\
    \ widely between crops and among growth stages for the same crop. This Kc factor\n\
    serves as an aggregation of the physical and physiological differences among crops\
    \ and averaged\neffects of evaporation from the soil [98]. Several spatial models\
    \ have been developed for ET estimation,\nwhich showed that accurate spatial ET\
    \ and water-balance models could be of great importance in VRI\napplication [61,99,100].\n\
    4.2. Remote and Proximal Sensing\nBesides crop coefﬁcient and ET, mapping soil\
    \ properties in a ﬁeld, such as ﬁeld capacity and\nroot zone water availability,\
    \ is also important for site-speciﬁc water management [101]. Information\nregarding\
    \ variability of plant conditions such as water stress, growth parameters, ground\
    \ cover can also\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n9 of 21\nprovide a basis for VRI. Remote\
    \ sensing using various sensors and platforms is often used to estimate\nseveral\
    \ soil and crop characteristics during the growing season that can provide important\
    \ information\nin decision support. The near-real-time information from several\
    \ sensors, such as spectral reﬂectance\nsensors and infrared thermometers have\
    \ been used to develop ﬁeld maps for water, vegetation,\nand nutrient status [50,102].\
    \ Remotely sensed images can be useful in determining leaf area index and\nground\
    \ cover for a ﬁeld and thus help in yield forecasting [103]. Remote sensing can\
    \ also help estimate\nET more reliably from individual ﬁelds [104]. A study in\
    \ Nebraska evaluated remote-sensing-based\nET and a water-balance model for irrigation\
    \ management [105]. In this study, four irrigation treatment\ncombinations were\
    \ tested: VRI based on water-balance model using remote sensing, VRI based on\n\
    water-balance model using neutron probe, uniform irrigation based on neutron-probe\
    \ measurement\nand rainfed. Landsat 7 and 8 imageries were used for model input\
    \ in a remote sensing-based\nmodel, which included reﬂectance-based crop coefﬁcients\
    \ for ET estimation. The result showed\nthat remote sensing-based treatment had\
    \ the greatest mean prescribed irrigation, which was attributed\nto water-balance\
    \ drift. The study concluded that the remote-sensing-based model might perform\n\
    better when coupled with SWC measurement. This can be helpful in site-speciﬁc\
    \ management of\nirrigation water, as well as weedicide, pesticide and other chemicals\
    \ [106–108]. Various indices\nderived from thermal and multispectral images, such\
    \ as crop water stress index (CWSI), perpendicular\nvegetation index (PVI), normalized\
    \ difference vegetation index (NDVI) and photochemical reﬂectance\nindex (PRI),\
    \ can predict soil or plant water status and drought stress as a basis for site-speciﬁc\
    \ water\nmanagement [109,110]. Use of digital infrared thermography to measure\
    \ canopy temperature can\nhelp producers to detect early crop water stress and\
    \ avoid yield declines as well as saving water\nwith site-speciﬁc irrigation management\
    \ and irrigation scheduling [111,112]. Recent improvements in\nremote and proximal\
    \ sensing technologies such as wireless soil moisture sensors and unmanned aerial\n\
    systems (UAS) have increased the efﬁciency for farmers to exercise site-speciﬁc\
    \ irrigation management.\nIndices derived from high-resolution UAS imagery have\
    \ shown the potential to predict crop water\nstress indicators such as water potential\
    \ and stomatal conductance [113]. Such information can aid in\nimproving irrigation\
    \ efﬁciency, reducing pumping costs, and retaining groundwater. Although soil\n\
    moisture sensors are found to be more proﬁtable in the present context, with the\
    \ increasing number\nof manufacturers and clear regulations, UAS-based sensor\
    \ technology for soil moisture estimation\nis gaining momentum [114]. This explains\
    \ the importance of remote sensing as a low-cost tool to\nimprove water management\
    \ in crops.\n5. Precision Water Management Strategies\nSeveral precision irrigation\
    \ technologies have been developed to improve crop productivity under\nwater-limited\
    \ conditions. However, appropriate precision irrigation strategies are equally\
    \ important for\nincreased efﬁciency and proﬁtability for site-speciﬁc technologies.\
    \ The development and application\nof management zones using spatial and temporal\
    \ information of various agronomic factors have\nbeen practiced for site-speciﬁc\
    \ management for several decades. In recent years, the use of artiﬁcial\nintelligence\
    \ in prescription map development for site-speciﬁc water management is also increasing.\n\
    5.1. Management Zones\nVRI is often implemented in the ﬁeld by dividing it into\
    \ a number of sections, or management\nzones with the aim to save water and other\
    \ inputs together with yield optimization [25]. A management\nzone is a subﬁeld\
    \ area that is relatively homogeneous in soil and topographic attributes. The\
    \ use of\nmanagement zones can be a convenient means to capture the spatial distribution\
    \ of yield-inﬂuencing\nfactors within the season. The information on spatial and\
    \ temporal development of abiotic and\nbiotic stresses can be linked with site-speciﬁc\
    \ irrigation systems via dynamic prescription maps\nto help producers improve\
    \ irrigation WUE, agricultural sustainability and the environment [102].\nVarious\
    \ factors such as soil properties, landscape attributes, crop properties, sensor-based\
    \ information,\nmanagement practice, weed, and pest management as well as crop\
    \ modeling have been considered\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n10 of 21\nin delineating\
    \ management zones for VRI application since several years [115]. Soil properties\
    \ such\nas soil organic matter, texture, nutrient content, pH, color, soil moisture\
    \ content and water-holding\ncapacities, ECa, etc. have been used effectively\
    \ in management zone delineation [116–119]. Landscape\nattributes such as elevation,\
    \ slope, aspect, curvature, and others have also been an important part\nof management\
    \ zone delineation in several studies [118,120–122]. Numerous studies have used\
    \ crop\nproperties such as yield maps and ground-based leaf area index to delineate\
    \ management zones\nfor VRI application [116,117,123,124]. The management zones\
    \ delineated based on yield data from\nmultiple years can effectively capture\
    \ nutrient variability in the ﬁeld [125]. However, the application of\nyield maps\
    \ for site-speciﬁc management can be challenging because spatial and temporal\
    \ variation in\nyield is affected by the interactions among several biotic and\
    \ abiotic factors [126,127]. Information from\nproximal and remote sensing such\
    \ as satellite and airborne imagery, normalized difference vegetation\nindex,\
    \ digital photography, etc. can be a powerful approach for delineation of relative\
    \ productive\nareas [128–131]. The zone information together with early season\
    \ environmental indicators and\ncrop response models can also be used to determine\
    \ the action decisions throughout the season [132].\nSimilarly, the selection\
    \ of factors for management zone delineation is equally important in management\n\
    zone delineation. A study was conducted to compare the site-speciﬁc irrigation\
    \ with conventional\nuniform irrigation management for potatoes in Idaho [25].\
    \ The available water-holding capacity of soil\nwas used to delineate a 2.9-ha\
    \ ﬁeld into nine management zones. The results showed that six out of\nnine management\
    \ zones produced a higher yield with site-speciﬁc management. However, the study\n\
    suggested that management zones were only based on available SWC and in some management\
    \ cases,\nother non-measured factors unrelated to soil texture or available water\
    \ content could have an impact\non the yield of crops. The study pointed out the\
    \ importance to take into consideration all the known\nfactors affecting yield\
    \ and include them in delineating irrigation management zones for site-speciﬁc\n\
    irrigation management. The optimum number of zones for a ﬁeld depends on the scale\
    \ of the ﬁeld,\neconomical and logistical practicality, and agronomic response\
    \ to irrigation amounts. For example,\nthe quantity and placement of soil moisture\
    \ sensors for determining irrigation amounts may vary\nwith ﬁeld size, cost of\
    \ the sensors and manageability, which, in turn, can inﬂuence the number of\n\
    management zones in the ﬁeld [133].\nThere are several methods to delineate management\
    \ zones, including unsupervised clustering,\nsupervised clustering, user-deﬁned\
    \ thresholds, etc. The clustering technique groups similar data\npoints into different\
    \ classes using algorithms such as k-means, fuzzy k-means, fuzzy c-means [127,134],\n\
    Ward′s method, and Jenk’s optimization procedure [125]. The appropriate factors\
    \ to be considered for\nmanagement zone delineation could be prioritized using\
    \ several methods such as principal component\nanalysis (PCA) [118]. It is equally\
    \ important to determine the number of optimum management\nzones for the ﬁeld\
    \ and their production and economic justiﬁcation [20]. A software program (MZA\n\
    software [135]) was developed for creating management zones using the fuzzy k-means\
    \ method.\nThis program determines the appropriate number of zones for a ﬁeld\
    \ by evaluating the clustering\nresults. Many studies have used management zones\
    \ for VRI and other site-speciﬁc crop management.\nFor example, a study conducted\
    \ in a 4.8-ha ﬁeld in Colorado assessed the effectiveness of ECa in\ncharacterizing\
    \ the spatial distribution of soil water [136]. This study found that SWC was\
    \ signiﬁcantly\ndifferent among different ECa derived management zones using MZA\
    \ software. This justiﬁes the\nimportance of characterizing management zones for\
    \ site-speciﬁc water management.\n5.2. Development of Site-Speciﬁc Water Management\
    \ Strategies\nTo enable the VRI technology in practice, the irrigation management\
    \ strategy is equally important.\nThe use of technology in the ﬁeld may not always\
    \ be effective in terms of ﬁnal yield or proﬁtability.\nFor example, research\
    \ has shown that the use of VRI technology may not be cost effective where\nthere\
    \ is high rainfall throughout the growing season [29]. Several strategies could\
    \ be applied to\nsave water and energy in the ﬁeld to gain yield beneﬁts in the\
    \ ﬁeld. Some of the strategies include\nskipping irritation in non-cropped areas,\
    \ planting different crops in the same ﬁeld, rainfall harvesting\nAgronomy 2019,\
    \ 9, 87\n11 of 21\nin areas with high water-holding capacity, and lowering irrigation\
    \ to areas with low water use (ET) [46].\nNew irrigation strategies such as modifying\
    \ the current irrigation system for site-speciﬁc water and\nchemical applications\
    \ are required to sustain modern irrigated agricultural cropping systems [102].\n\
    Management strategies including placement and timing are crucial in optimizing\
    \ irrigation\nthroughout the growing season. About 9%−19% of irrigation water\
    \ savings were achieved with VRI\ncompared to the uniform application in a research\
    \ conducted in variable soil, which was possible\nwith several strategies such\
    \ as withholding irrigation during speciﬁc growth stages and in particular,\n\
    non-cropped areas of the ﬁeld [137]. Further, the study suggests that areas where\
    \ the optimized or\nincreased irrigation does not produce an increase in yield,\
    \ less water can be applied while the areas\nwith high yield potential can be\
    \ applied optimum irrigation and gain higher returns. A study showed\nthat restricting\
    \ irrigation during the peak water-demand time of cotton (80−100 days after planting)\n\
    from 100% to 60% of potential ET conserves 2.6 inches of water [138]. The VRI\
    \ trial was conducted\nin three farms in New Zealand to compare the VRI to uniform\
    \ rate irrigation (URI) [139]. The URI\ntreatments were provided with the same\
    \ level of irrigation at the same time as the most drought-prone\nsoil zone, but\
    \ VRI treatment was achieved by either delaying the irrigation or reducing the\
    \ amount\nand intensity of irrigation comparing to that with a drought-prone area.\
    \ The results showed that there\nwas a two to three-fold difference in total available\
    \ water-holding capacity at each site, which justiﬁed\nthe decision to use VRI\
    \ systems. Although the study found no signiﬁcant impact of VRI on crop yield,\n\
    water savings of 8 to 36% were achieved in three sites with less drainage. Hence,\
    \ critical management\nstrategies adopted in a decision support system that uses\
    \ real-time monitoring and feedback to\nirrigation control make water conversation\
    \ possible [28]. Deﬁcit irrigation (DI) is a complementary\nmethod that uses irrigation\
    \ scheduling at strategic times of less critical growth for irrigation water\n\
    conservation. In this method, irrigation is applied during the drought-sensitive\
    \ growth stages of a\ncrop. During less drought-sensitive stages, irrigation is\
    \ applied based on rainfall and availability of\nwater for maintenance [140].\n\
    The use of technology and strategies can also affect the level of proﬁt achieved\
    \ from the VRI\ntechnology itself. A study was conducted in a 20-ha wheat ﬁeld\
    \ in Southern Alberta, Canada on\nmodeling economic returns at different levels\
    \ of control [141]. A total of 62 management scenarios\nwere studied, including\
    \ (1) no irrigation, (2) uniform irrigation management, (3) speed control with\n\
    two angular increments of 2 and 10 degrees, and (4) zone control with a combination\
    \ of two angular\nincrements and a different number of independent irrigation\
    \ zones, ranging from 2 to 30. The study\nconcluded that the highest proﬁt was\
    \ obtained with 30 control zones. However, considering the cost\nof the technology,\
    \ the case of ten control zones along the central pivot system was found to be\
    \ the\nmost proﬁtable. Hence, it is essential to set forth effective site-speciﬁc\
    \ water management strategies for\nincreased agricultural sustainability and proﬁtability.\n\
    5.3. Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Deep Learning\nExisting site-speciﬁc management\
    \ utilizes several control strategies such mathematical modeling\nof crop yield\
    \ or the plant-soil-atmosphere environment, optimizing irrigation application\
    \ timing,\nlearning sensor feedback to control the site-speciﬁc ﬂow of water as\
    \ well as using predictive model\ncontrol that executes a model repeatedly to\
    \ determine optimum input. The use of artiﬁcial intelligence\nor neuro-dynamic\
    \ programming that integrates machine learning to determine the water application\n\
    parameter for optimized irrigation is also increasing [50,142–145]. Hyperspectral\
    \ remote sensing\nimaging along with machine learning has been in use in agricultural\
    \ industry, and it is estimated that\nmachine learning/deep learning-based classiﬁcation\
    \ has a signiﬁcant potential for high-dimensional\nbig data produced in agriculture\
    \ [146].\n6. Impact of Variable-Rate Irrigation\nVRI can be highly effective in\
    \ reducing water use and increasing water use efﬁciency (WUE) of\ncrops [147].\
    \ A review on VRI across different crop and weather regimes of the world concluded\
    \ that\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n12 of 21\nVRI could save 10%−15% of water [28].\
    \ A study in a 7-ha sugar beet ﬁeld in Germany reported that\n13% of water was\
    \ saved compared to the uniform application [15]. This was achieved by utilizing\n\
    stored soil moisture and in-season precipitation. In a study in New Zealand comparing\
    \ VRI with\nconventional irrigation system, 9%−19% irrigation water was saved\
    \ with VRI in pasture and corn\nﬁelds, which in turn reduced nitrogen leaching\
    \ [137]. Similarly, the application of VRI by manipulating\nits several components\
    \ can reduce water runoff by avoiding excess water application in the ﬁeld [28].\n\
    At a large scale, water pumpage and use can be reduced by adopting VRI. A geospatial\
    \ method has\nbeen provided for potential VRI technology adopters to achieve potential\
    \ water savings in the ﬁeld\nusing freely available datasets such as soil survey\
    \ data from the Natural Resources Conservation\nService (NRCS) [48]. In this study,\
    \ the difference in application depth between conventional irrigation\nand VRI\
    \ was estimated based on root zone available water capacity. The undepleted soil\
    \ water from\neach management zone was mined using prescription maps allowing\
    \ 50% depletion. VRI in this\nstudy resulted in a reduction in irrigation depth\
    \ of up to 18 mm, pumping reductions, and improved\nwater distribution throughout\
    \ the ﬁeld. In addition, higher VRI control resolution increased energy\nsavings.\
    \ VRI was found to reduce pumpage in more than 13% of center pivot irrigated ﬁelds\
    \ by 25 mm\nper year compared to the conventional irrigation system in Nebraska\
    \ [99]. Another study for VRI\nmanagement based on soil water spatial variation\
    \ was conducted in a 1.64-ha ﬁeld with center pivot to\nunderstand the yield and\
    \ water-saving effects of VRI [148]. In this study, the ﬁeld was divided into\
    \ four\nmanagement zones based on available water-holding capacity and each management\
    \ zone was further\ndivided into two sections for VRI and URI management. The\
    \ results from this study indicated that the\nimpact of VRI on water savings within\
    \ zones depended on weather conditions. Water savings with\nVRI management was\
    \ higher for summer maize when the rainfall was high compared to winter wheat\n\
    grown in no-rainfall weather. The study suggests that although VRI management\
    \ had no signiﬁcant\ninﬂuence on crop growth parameters and yield within a management\
    \ zone, managing the zones with\ndifferent available water-holding capacity might\
    \ improve the uniformity of crop growth, maximize\ncrop yield and gain potential\
    \ water savings.\nCompared to the uniform application, VRI increases crop productivity.\
    \ The results comparing\nthe water productivity of sorghum and corn showed that\
    \ there was more than 20% increase in water\nproductivity for both crops using\
    \ VRI [35]. Another study conducted in a 4-ha ﬁeld, VRI resulted in\na signiﬁcant\
    \ difference in corn yield in a dry year. However, the results were not signiﬁcant\
    \ for the\nyear when the rain was sufﬁcient [100]. Another study was conducted\
    \ in New Zealand to understand\nthe impact of variable-rate irrigation based on\
    \ soil moisture status [139]. This study showed that\nalthough the yield was not\
    \ signiﬁcantly different among different irrigation treatments, water savings\n\
    of 27–55 mm was achieved by limiting irrigation in soil with adequate plant available\
    \ water and\nnon-irrigating poorly drained, wet soil zones. VRI has been found\
    \ effective to reduce water and\nenergy use even in humid areas of the world with\
    \ uncertain and unpredictable rainfall [40]. This study\nshowed that potential\
    \ water savings of 20mm/year could be achieved using VRI in these regions.\nHowever,\
    \ the feasibility and effectiveness of VRI depend on the magnitude of the ﬁeld,\
    \ crop under\nconsideration, weather and the underlying ﬁeld properties [24,25,40].\
    \ The accurate determination of\nwater requirement and its management is crucial\
    \ for crop yield stabilization and improved average\nyield [53]. Several VRI research\
    \ projects attempt to enhance the control scenarios as well as model and\nproduction\
    \ function to improve water savings and reduce pumpage [40,99,141,149,150]. Further,\
    \ it is\nnecessary to understand the impact of soil water availability on crop\
    \ growth to manage irrigation in\nspatial and temporal scales using variable-rate\
    \ irrigation technologies and appropriate strategies.\n7. Challenges and Research\
    \ Requirements\nData collection and management tools, such as yield monitors,\
    \ sensors and sensing systems,\nGIS, GNSS, and decision support systems are available\
    \ today to enable site-speciﬁc management of\nirrigation water for optimized crop\
    \ production. Steady development in irrigation control systems\nprovides the user\
    \ with various options to implement VRI. Many studies have investigated and\n\
    Agronomy 2019, 9, 87\n13 of 21\ndeveloped irrigation strategies, prescription\
    \ methodologies, and proﬁtability optimization involved in\nVRI. However, there\
    \ are some challenges in the implementation and application of this technology.\n\
    Further research and development are required to improve the understanding, implementation,\n\
    and adoption of precision water management strategies and technologies.\n(1)\n\
    Research is required on the integration of technology, agronomy, and proﬁtability\
    \ with VRI\nAlthough several studies have reported the potential of adopting VRI\
    \ system to optimize crop\nproduction and proﬁtability [29,70], some studies conducted\
    \ in experimental ﬁelds have concluded\nthat the VRI technology may not be economically\
    \ viable for all crops under all growing conditions\nand environments [24]. This\
    \ is not because of the yield-related beneﬁt, but due to the cost of the\ntechnology\
    \ itself. For example, research conducted in a 12.6-ha ﬁeld in southwest Georgia\
    \ showed that\nVRI generated $16/ha more return than URI. Although this return\
    \ is not signiﬁcant for this small ﬁeld,\nthe study suggested that proﬁts could\
    \ be ampliﬁed for large ﬁelds and beneﬁt farmers [151]. From the\nagronomic perspective,\
    \ a better understanding of the extremities of ﬁeld variability and how it affects\n\
    crop yield is needed for the effective implementation of new technologies [152].\
    \ In an experiment\nconducted in Tennessee, the same level of irrigation did not\
    \ result in the same cotton lint yield in all\nparts of the ﬁeld due to differences\
    \ in texture and available water-holding capacity [153]. In some cases,\nthe incorporation\
    \ of other crops in a rotation in VRI can make this technology economically viable\
    \ [25].\nAdditionally, most of the VRI studies are concentrated on the control\
    \ scenarios of VRI [149,150].\nAlthough a few studies [40,99,141] determined water\
    \ and energy savings using VRI due to managerial\nlimitations, they were either\
    \ based on some model and production functions or arbitrary in irrigation\nrate\
    \ determination. Hence, there is a need for a comprehensive study on VRI integrating\
    \ the agronomic,\ntechnical and managerial aspects of VRI to determine its proﬁtability,\
    \ sustainability, and adoptability\nfor various conditions.\n(2)\nOn-farm and\
    \ whole-ﬁeld research\nProducers are more likely to adopt VRI if the beneﬁts are\
    \ shown on a “real farm.” Most of the\nprevious studies on VRI were conducted\
    \ in experimental ﬁelds or in small ﬁelds that cannot represent\nthe commercial\
    \ farming practice [28]. Experimental design and implementation in large ﬁelds\
    \ are\nchallenging. This type of research requires close communication and collaborative\
    \ management\nbetween the researcher and the farm owner to ensure the alignment\
    \ of management practices and study\ngoals. Acquiring data and information from\
    \ large ﬁelds is costly and time-consuming. In addition,\nthe statistical analysis\
    \ of on-farm data is challenging due to the lack of adequate tools that integrates\n\
    classical statistical methods and spatial analysis. This creates challenges in\
    \ the understanding of the\nrelationship between crop growth and its environment\
    \ in site-speciﬁc irrigation. More on-farm studies\nare needed to provide information\
    \ for practical VRI applications. In addition, insufﬁcient recognition\nof temporal\
    \ variation and environmental impact are several other factors that hinder the\
    \ adoption of\nprecision agriculture technology [9].\n(3)\nPrescription map development\n\
    The majority of previous studies for prescription maps (management zone delineation)\
    \ are for\nvariable-rate application of fertilizers and seeds and are static [20,133].\
    \ Limited research has addressed\nthe need for dynamic prescription map development\
    \ that could incorporate seasonal changes in\ncrop growth and conditions [133].\
    \ More research is required to evaluate VRI prescription maps or\nmanagement zone\
    \ development integrating different soil and crop characteristics under different\n\
    environments. Use of remote and proximal sensing such as infrared sensors, near-infrared\
    \ and thermal\nimages, along with weather data can provide information on crop,\
    \ soil, and environmental conditions\nin irrigation scheduling and developing\
    \ dynamic prescription maps [97]. Further research needs to\ninvestigate how to\
    \ integrate such data and information to evaluate the effectiveness of such prescription\n\
    maps during the growing season.\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n14 of 21\n(4)\nOptimal\
    \ spatial and temporal scale\nFew studies have evaluated the appropriate spatial\
    \ and temporal scales for VRI application.\nMany studies have explored the use\
    \ of sensors in acquiring information for modeling crop\nevapotranspiration, SWC,\
    \ irrigation needs including the nutrient requirements [97,105,152,154,155].\n\
    Most of these studies indicated the high potential of remote and proximal sensing\
    \ technologies in\nunderstanding spatial and temporal variations in crop growth\
    \ conditions in the ﬁeld. Temporal\nvariability in soil water status and crop\
    \ growing conditions require dynamic adjustment of irrigation\namount and spatial\
    \ distribution. Therefore, simulation models or on-farm studies might be considered\n\
    to assess the effectiveness of VRI at different spatial and temporal scales.\n\
    (5)\nComprehensive decision support tools\nPrecision irrigation management requires\
    \ data and information from crop growth conditions,\nsoil physical and chemical\
    \ properties, weather factors, and the interaction among these factors.\nEffective\
    \ implementation of precision irrigation requires a comprehensive decision support\
    \ system to\nprocess and integrate different layers of data and information [48].\
    \ The challenge for the application\nof VRI still exists in the lack of user-friendly\
    \ decision support tools such as for developing dynamic\nprescription maps [105].\
    \ Several decision support systems such as AgriDSS are available [16,156],\nbut\
    \ producers are reluctant to use them to their full potential due to their complexity.\
    \ Also, these tools\nare based on what scientists and developers consider as necessary\
    \ knowledge that should be\nimplemented in the decision support system. However,\
    \ in a real-world situation, they fail to utilize\nthe implicit knowledge of farmers\
    \ and address their needs. The complexity, lack of observability and\nconﬁdence,\
    \ poor user interface design, lack of incentive to learn are some of the other\
    \ reasons behind\nthe hindrance of adoption of different decision support tools\
    \ [16]. The system or tool should help the\nuser decide where to apply how much\
    \ irrigation water at various crop growth stages to achieve the\nhighest proﬁt\
    \ based on the regional climate conditions and cropping systems.\n(6)\nIntegrating\
    \ VRI with other inputs\nFew studies have integrated variable-rate application\
    \ of nutrients with water. Crop yield response\nto water and N are not the same\
    \ at different parts of the ﬁeld [157], indicating the need for studying\nthe\
    \ interaction of water and fertilizer in variable-rate irrigation. Site-speciﬁc\
    \ application of N together\nwith irrigation using remote sensing can help reduce\
    \ N inputs by 50% and leaching by 85% without\nreducing yields [155]. Further\
    \ studies are needed to investigate the interaction between VRI fertilizers\n\
    and other inputs to improve the efﬁciencies of water and fertilizers while reducing\
    \ the environmental\nimpact of fertilizer application and enhancing production\
    \ sustainability.\nAuthor Contributions: The authors contributed equally to the\

    Highlights • Conventional irrigation scheduling techniques are unsuitable for
    automation. • Precision of single measurements of the narrow-band indices is not
    adequate for estimation of plant water status. • Integration of various vegetation
    indices could lead to better water stress prediction. • Combination of soil-based
    and plant-based approaches are needed to improve plant water stress monitoring.
    Abstract In order to meet the demand for increased global food production under
    limited water resources, implementation of suitable irrigation scheduling technique
    is crucial, particularly in irrigated basins experiencing water stress. Optimizing
    water use in agriculture requires innovations in detection of plant water stress,
    at various stages of the growing season to minimize crop physiological damage,
    and yield loss. Remotely sensed plant stress indicators, based on the visible
    and near-infrared spectral regions, have the advantage of high spatial and spectral
    resolutions, low cost, and quick turnaround time. This paper outlines recent developments
    in monitoring crop water stress, for scheduling irrigation, some of the constraints
    experienced, and future research needs. Previous article in issue Next article

    resolutionSpectral region 1. Introduction Irrigated agriculture is essential to
    global food production, utilizing only 20% of cultivated land to provide 40% of
    the world’s food supply (Garces-Restrepo et al., 2007). However, climate change,
    increasing worldwide shortages of water, frequent droughts, and global warming
    (Hirich et al., 2016) are threatening the reliability of irrigation water supplies.
    While the human population and demands for freshwater resources are increasing,
    drought and regular water scarcity can put global food security at risk (Lei et
    al., 2016), by severely disrupting agricultural production. The challenge is to
    meet rising productivity demands by improving methods of crop management (Behmann
    et al., 2014), and this requires a deeper understanding of plant response to abiotic
    stresses. Conventional methods for monitoring crop water stress rely on in situ
    soil moisture measurements and meteorological variables to estimate the amount
    of water lost from the plant-soil system during a given period (González-Dugo
    et al., 2006). Regular sampling of soil to assess water depletion from the plant
    root zone assumes that the water holding capacity of the entire soil is uniform,
    so only a few point measurements are used to represent water retention characteristics
    (Clarke, 1997). The method is time consuming, assumes uniform plant density, and
    the same rate of transpiration, over an entire field, which is rarely the case.
    Similarly, evapotranspiration models assume a freely transpiring reference crop
    with uniform cover and soil type within a field. These methods are time consuming
    and produce point information that give poor indications of the overall status
    of the field. Other methods of detecting plant water status involve soil water
    balance calculations, direct and indirect measurement of plant water status, via
    stomatal conductance and leaf water potential. These approaches, though reliable,
    are labour intensive, destructive, and unsuitable for automation, due to heterogeneity
    of soil and crop canopy. In order to increase water savings and enhance agricultural
    sustainability, implementation of suitable irrigation scheduling methods is essential
    (Osroosh et al., 2015), and requires early detection of water stress in crops,
    before it causes irreversible damage and yield loss. Recently, studies have focused
    on the use of remotely sensed data as an alternative to traditional field measurements
    of plant stress parameters, as this provides information about the spatial and
    temporal variability of crops (Dangwal et al., 2015, Leroux et al., 2016, Panigada
    et al., 2014, Rossini et al., 2013, Suárez et al., 2010, Zarco-Tejada et al.,
    2013, Zhao et al., 2015). Spectral reflectance indices obtained from high resolution
    hyperspectral sensors, onboard small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS), can be
    used in precision agriculture for monitoring crop water status and scheduling
    irrigation (Berni et al., 2009a, Berni et al., 2009b, Gago et al., 2015). However,
    due to several confounding factors affecting the vegetation indices (VIs) at the
    canopy and landscape scales, and that the threshold for water stress detection
    is crop specific, a general agreement for their use as a pre-visual indicator
    of water stress is yet to be achieved. This paper reviews the recent advances
    in crop water stress detection that can potentially be applicable to improve irrigation
    scheduling of vegetable crops and aims to identify the most promising approach
    for large-scale application. 2. Plant response to water stress Crop water stress
    is a deficiency in water supply, detected as a reduction in soil water content
    or from the physiological responses of the plant to water deficit. Plants absorb
    root zone soil water to meet their evapotranspiration needs, and this depletes
    soil available water. Under limiting soil moisture conditions, chemical and hydraulic
    signals are transmitted to the plant leaf through xylem pathways (Limpus, 2009),
    which leads to physiological responses such as stomatal closure and reductions
    in photosynthesis rate. Wang et al. (2015) indicated that water stressed crops
    have reduced evapotranspiration, and manifest other symptoms such as leaf wilting,
    stunted growth, and leaf area reduction. Also, water stress adversely affects
    the physiological and nutritional development of crops, leading to reduced biomass,
    yield, and quality of crops (Aladenola and Madramootoo, 2014, Rossini et al.,
    2013, Zhang et al., 2017a, Zhang et al., 2017b). Plant water status measures the
    response of a plant to the combined effects of soil moisture availability, evaporative
    demand, internal hydraulic resistance, and uptake capacity of the plant-root interface.
    It is a more sensitive indicator of stress than soil moisture (Jones, 2010). Plant
    response to water stress depends on environmental conditions and crop evapotranspiration
    needs, as irrigation must replenish soil moisture deficit from evapotranspiration
    losses. FAO-56 defines the irrigation water requirement for a well-watered crop
    as water loss through evapotranspiration of a disease-free crop under non-limiting
    soil conditions (Allen et al., 1998). Measures of plant water status are required
    to better understand the mechanisms of plant response and adaptation to water
    stress, and for the optimisation of crop production (Osakabe et al., 2014), through
    precision irrigation. Similarly, evapotranspiration (ET) models are used to predict
    how changes in weather parameters can affect plant water status (Osroosh et al.,
    2016). The frequently used ET models are the Penman-Monteith (PM) (Allen et al.,
    1998) and Hargreaves (Hargreaves and Samani, 1985) equations. The Hargreaves model
    needs fewer data than the PM model and can estimate ET using air temperature as
    only input. Other researchers have used the CROPWAT-8, which is based on the Penman-Monteith
    method, to assess reference evapotranspiration (ETo), crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc), and irrigation water requirements (Bouraima et al., 2015, Patel et al.,
    2017, Surendran et al., 2017). The most common and practical approach widely used
    for estimating crop water requirement, and the operational monitoring of soil-plant
    water balance is the FAO-56 method. In the FAO-56 approach, crop evapotranspiration
    is estimated by the combination of ETo and crop coefficients. There are two different
    FAO-56 approaches: single and dual crop coefficients. The single crop coefficient
    approach is used to express both plant transpiration and soil evaporation combined
    into a single crop coefficient (Kc). The dual crop coefficient approach uses two
    coefficients to separate the respective contribution of plant transpiration (Kcb)
    and soil evaporation (Ke), each by individual values (Allen et al., 2005). Kcb
    is multiplied by water stress coefficient (Ks) (range 0–1) to account for the
    reduction of ET due to soil moisture depletion. It has been shown that Ks is related
    to crop water stress index (CWSI) according to Eq. (1). (1) Several researchers
    have evaluated the accuracy of water stress coefficient methods for estimating
    crop ETc under different levels of deficit irrigation. For instance, Bausch et
    al. (2011) successfully used a ratio of canopy temperature (Tc) as a substitute
    for the soil moisture based Ks. Kullberg et al. (2017) observed that using appropriate
    Ks method has the potential to improve irrigation scheduling to properly manage
    stress and ensure optimum crop yield under limited irrigation water supply. The
    main methods that are used for monitoring plant water stress have been summarized
    in Table 1, and are discussed below. Table 1. A summary of the methods for monitoring
    plant water stress, indicating their main advantages and disadvantages. Methods
    Description Advantages Disadvantages 1. Soil water measurement (a) Gravimetric
    method Sampling of soil, which is weighed, oven-dried and reweighed to estimate
    the amount of water lost from the plant-soil system It is reliable and serves
    as a guide on the amount of water to apply during irrigation The method is labour
    intensive, destructive, and time consuming (b) Soil moisture sensors (I) Neutron
    probe Based on the emission of high energy neutrons by a radioactive source into
    the soil Fast, non-destructive, and repetitive Requires adequate operator training,
    storage, licencing, and inspection, due to its radioactive source (II) TDR and
    FDR Based on the difference between the dielectric constant of water and soil
    Precise and easy to apply in practice. Estimates soil water levels at different
    depths along the soil profile. Readings can be logged automatically Several sensors
    are required for an entire field. High cost of installation of sensors (III) Tensiometers
    Measures soil water potential Easy to use for irrigation scheduling Useful in
    coarse textured soils or in high frequency irrigation only. Used for a narrow
    range of available soil water  2. Soil water balance approach Indirect estimate
    of soil moisture status based on soil water balance calculations Good indicator
    of the amount of irrigation water and easy to apply Not very accurate and requires
    calibration with actual soil measurements. Requires estimate of evaporation, rainfall,
    and irrigation events  3. Plant-based approaches (a) Stomatal conductance Indirect
    indicator of plant water stress by measuring the stomata opening Good measure
    of plant water status. Used as benchmark for most research studies Labour intensive
    and unsuitable for automation and commercial application. Not very accurate for
    anisohydric crops (b) Leaf water potential Direct measurement of leaf water content
    Widely accepted reference technique Slow, destructive, and unsuitable for isohydric
    crops (c) Relative water content Direct measurement of leaf water status Good
    indicator plant water status, requiring less sophisticated equipment Destructive
    and time consuming (d) Sap flow measurement Measures the rate of transpiration
    through heat pulse Sensitive to stomatal closure and water deficits. Adapted for
    automated recording and control of irrigation systems Needs calibration for each
    tree and is difficult to replicate. Requires complex instrumentation and expertise
    (e) Stem and fruit diameter Measures fluctuation in stem and fruit diameters in
    response to changes in water content Sensitive measure of plant water stress Not
    useful for the control of high-frequency irrigation systems  4. Remote sensing
    methods (a) Infrared thermometry Measures canopy temperature, which increases
    as a result of water stress Reliable and non-destructive Based on only a few point
    measurements. Does not account for soil and crop heterogeneity (I) CWSI Uses the
    difference between canopy and air temperatures to quantify crop water stress Sensitive
    to stomatal closure and crop water deficit Influenced by cloud cover, requires
    different baselines for different crops (II) DANS, DACT, and Tc ratio Measure
    single canopy temperature for quantifying water stress Require less data than
    CWSI for detecting water stress. Tc ratio gives quantitative water stress coefficient
    (Ks) for calculating crop ET Difficult to scale up to large cropped fields. (b)
    Spectral vegetation indices (i) Structural indices Measures reflectance indices
    within the VIS and NIR spectral range (NDVI, RDVI, OSAVI, TCARI) to indicate canopy
    changes due to water stress Non-destructive with high temporal and spectral resolution
    Requisite image analysis is still a challenging task. Precision reduces from leaf
    scale to canopy scale (ii) Xanthophyll indices Measures PRI and PRInorm, which
    are sensitive to the epoxidation state of the xanthophyll cycle pigments Account
    for physiological changes in photosynthetic pigment changes due to water stress
    More work is needed to convert raw imagery to user-friendly irrigation application
    (iii) Water indices Measures the reflectance trough in the near-infrared region
    (WI, SRWI, and NDWI) used to represent canopy moisture content Rapid and non-destructive
    measure of leaf water content Problem of scaling up to canopy level 2.1. Plant-based
    approach Stress quantification from plant-based approaches include the direct
    measurement of leaf water potential with a pressure chamber (Scholander et al.,
    1965). Leaf water potential is assumed to represent the mean soil water potential
    next to the plant roots (Ameglio et al., 1999), and provides good indication of
    leaf water status. It is widely adopted for scheduling irrigation in various crops
    (Alchanatis et al., 2010, Ameglio et al., 1999, Bellvert et al., 2016, Zarco-Tejada
    et al., 2012). However, the approach is slow and destructive, with limited temporal
    and spatial resolution, and is not suitable for strongly isohydric crops, which
    maintain a stable leaf water status over a wide range of evaporative demand or
    soil water supplies (Limpus, 2009). The amount of water in plant leaves can be
    measured by laboratory analysis, using Relative Water Content (RWC) and Equivalent
    Water Thickness (EWT) (Colombo et al., 2011). The EWT is the hypothetical thickness
    of a single layer of water averaged over the whole leaf area and can be computed
    in laboratory by measuring Fresh Weights and Dry weights and the one-sided leaf
    Area , as shown in Eq. (2). (2) At the canopy level, Equivalent Water Thickness
    (shown in Eq. (3)) can be obtained by scaling the with Leaf Area Index (LAI),
    defined as the one-sided green leaf area per unit ground surface area (LAI = leaf
    area/ground area, cm2/cm2). (3) The RWC compares the water content of a leaf with
    the maximum water content at full turgor and can be considered as an indicator
    of vegetation status. It can be obtained from laboratory measurements of leaf
    weight and leaf Turgid Weight (TW) according to the following expression: (4)
    Both RWC and EWC are good indicators of plant water status, and have been successfully
    used for scheduling irrigation in various crops (Danson et al., 1992, Jones, 2004,
    Panigada et al., 2014, Wang et al., 2015). The approaches require less sophisticated
    equipment, but are also destructive and time consuming. Several other approaches
    are available that give indirect indications of stress such as measurement of
    stomatal conductance (Agam et al., 2013, Ballester et al., 2013, Lorenzo-Minguez
    et al., 1985, Maes et al., 2011), measurement of fruit and stem diameter (Gallardo
    et al., 2006, Huguet et al., 1992), and sap-flow measurement (Giorio and Giorio,
    2003, Granier, 1987, Singh et al., 2010). Most plants exercise some measure of
    control over their leaf water status, by minimizing changes in leaf water status
    as the soil dries, through stomatal closure. Therefore, stomatal conductance is
    a very sensitive plant response to soil water deficit (Jones, 2004), except for
    some anisohydric species, which have less effective control of leaf water status
    under declining soil moisture conditions. The recognition that water stressed
    plants tend to close their stomata, which leads to increase in leaf temperature,
    has been used to develop thermal sensing methods, for the detection of plant stress
    (Idso et al., 1981). The approach provides a good indication of irrigation needs
    in many crops. However, measurements of stomatal conductance are tedious, and
    large leaf-to-leaf variation of the plant canopy requires much replication to
    obtain reliable data for irrigation scheduling. The sap flow technique is used
    to assess transpiration rates of plants, by measuring the rate at which sap ascends
    stems using heat pulse. In this approach, short pulses of heat are applied in
    the stem, and the mass flow of sap is determined from the velocity of the heat
    pulses moving along the stem. The changes in transpiration rate indicated by sap
    flow are mainly determined by changes in stomatal opening. Singh et al. (2010)
    used sap flow sensors to schedule irrigation in corn field, but noted that the
    approach only gives indirect estimates of changes in conductance, as flow is also
    dependent on atmospheric conditions such as humidity. Therefore, changes in sap
    flow can occur without changes in stomatal aperture. Several other studies used
    sap-flow measurement for irrigation scheduling and control in a diverse range
    of crops, including grapevine (Eastham and Gray, 1998), fruit and olive trees
    (Ameglio et al., 1999, Giorio and Giorio, 2003) and even greenhouse crops (Ehret
    et al., 2001), with varying degrees of success. However, Jones (2004) stated that
    sap flow method requires a heat source, complex instrumentation, technical expertise,
    and needs calibration for each crop and for definition of irrigation control thresholds.
    The use of plant-based indicators for irrigation scheduling requires the definition
    of threshold values, beyond which irrigation is essential. Therefore, it is important
    to regularly check the plant water status to avoid exceeding the reference values
    (Ballester et al., 2013). The threshold values, which are determined for plants
    growing under a well-watered condition, are difficult to obtain in a changing
    environment (Fereres and Goldhamer, 2003). Another limitation of plant-based approaches
    is that they do not usually provide information on the quantity of irrigation
    water to apply at any time, but only indicates that irrigation is required. This
    implies that soil moisture measurements or other estimation procedures are needed
    to determine the quantity of water to apply to optimize crop water use (Stockle
    and Dugas, 1992). A general drawback of both direct measurements of soil water
    status and plant-based approaches is the costs of installation of sensors or the
    difficulty with obtaining representative measurements, with single point sampling
    that would adequately account for soil and crop heterogeneity (Ballester et al.,
    2013, Jones, 2012). 2.2. Environmental canopy sensing Infrared thermometry and
    thermal imagery, along with additional environmental measurements, have been acknowledged
    as an alternative approach to soil moisture based methods of plant water stress
    detection (Berni et al., 2009a, Cohen et al., 2005, Jones, 2010, Osroosh et al.,
    2015). Water stress detection based on canopy temperature measurements is probably
    the most widely used plant-based approach for remote sensing that is applicable
    to irrigation scheduling of several crops. As plants absorb solar radiation, canopy
    temperature increases, but is cooled when that energy is used for evapotranspiration.
    Water stressed plants have reduced transpiration and higher leaf temperature compared
    to non-stressed crops. González-Dugo et al. (2006) used variability of canopy
    temperature to indicate water stress, and emphasised the need to quantify the
    complex relationship between canopy temperature, water stress, and spatial water
    availability. Collaizzi et al. (2012) revealed that canopy temperature-based algorithms
    are strongly correlated to crop outputs such as yield, water use efficiency, irrigation
    rates, seasonal evapotranspiration, and midday leaf water potential. Many indices
    have been established for evaluating water stress using infrared canopy temperature
    (Idso et al., 1981, Jones, 2004, Nielsen and Gardner, 1988, Osroosh et al., 2015,
    O’Shaughnessy et al., 2012, Payero and Irmak, 2006). Most of the indices use crop
    canopy temperature as a main driver for evaluation, typically as a single daily
    measurement at an assumed peak stress time, or by evaluating time above a temperature
    threshold. The approach is sensitive to small stresses, and relies on stomatal
    closure as an early indicator of water deficits. 2.2.1. Canopy temperature based
    crop water stress index (CWSI) The CWSI derived from canopy temperature has been
    largely adopted as a tool to indicate plant water status and schedule irrigation
    in many crops (Aladenola and Madramootoo, 2014, Alchanatis et al., 2010, Bellvert
    et al., 2016, Yildirim et al., 2012). CWSI theory is based on the principle that
    transpiration cools the leaf surface and as root zone soil moisture is depleted,
    stomatal conductance and transpiration decrease and leaf temperature increases.
    The concept of using CWSI for improving irrigation scheduling gained popularity
    when Idso et al. (1981) observed a linear relationship between canopy temperatures
    measured using infrared thermometry and air temperature and vapour pressure deficit,
    and developed an empirical method of quantifying crop water stress. The empirical
    CWSI (Eq. (5)) uses two baselines. The lower baseline represents canopy Temperature
    (Tc) minus air Temperature (Ta) of a well-watered crop transpiring at maximum
    potential rate and the upper baselines represents (Tc–Ta) of a non-transpiring
    crop. (5) where, Tc: canopy Temperature (°C), Ta: air Temperature (°C), Tnws:
    non-water stressed canopy Temperature (°C), and Tdry: water-stressed canopy Temperature
    (°C). Within the past few years, there have been improvements in the use of CWSI
    for monitoring water stress and scheduling irrigation in different crops (Berni
    et al., 2009a, Berni et al., 2009b, Gonzalez-Dugo et al., 2014; O’shaughnessy
    et al., 2011; Paltineanu et al., 2013). O’Shaughnessy et al. (2012) incorporated
    a Time-Temperature Threshold (TTT) into a theoretical index (CWSI-TTT), and used
    it to successfully automate irrigations of grain sorghum. The study however, reported
    an under-irrigation problem during the growing season, caused by cloud cover and
    the influence of changing crop aspect on infrared thermometer measurements. Osroosh
    et al. (2015) developed an adaptive irrigation scheduling algorithm relying on
    a theoretical CWSI. This, unlike the traditional CWSI algorithm where the threshold
    is a constant value, uses a dynamic threshold determined by following the CWSI
    trend. However, large discrepancies in their thermal readings, attributed to infrared
    thermal and microclimatic measurements, resulted in dissimilar values of measured
    temperature and midday CWSI. Recent studies have evaluated additional indices
    based on infrared thermometry that require less information than CWSI for detecting
    crop water stress. Bausch et al. (2011) investigated the use of a ratio of canopy
    temperature (Tc ratio) measured over fully irrigated and water-stressed corn as
    a substitute for the Ks presently used in the reference ET-crop coefficient. The
    result indicated that the Tc ratio is a reasonable quantitative estimate of Ks
    for calculating crop ET under water stress conditions and that the ratio allows
    application of the crop coefficient method for scheduling deficit irrigation.
    Taghvaeiana et al. (2014) indicated that the Degrees Above Non-Stressed (DANS),
    which is based solely on canopy temperature, was effective in monitoring water
    stress and scheduling irrigations in deficit-irrigated sunflower in arid/semi-arid
    regions. DeJonge et al. (2015) recommended the Degrees Above Canopy Threshold
    (DACT) as a suitable index that requires a single canopy temperature measurement
    for quantifying water stress in maize. Kullberg et al. (2017) compared four thermal
    remote sensing indices based methods for estimating crop evapotranspiration coefficients:
    CWSI, DANS, DACT, Tc ratio, and observed that thermal indices DANS and DACT are
    responsive to crop water stress, comparable to more data intensive methods such
    as CWSI. While canopy temperature measurements by infrared thermometers are reliable
    and non-invasive (Cohen et al., 2005), they are usually based on only a few point
    measurements. Therefore, uniformity of soil water content and of plant canopy
    for large areas is assumed. Most researchers, however, assume that weather conditions
    are constant if the measurements required to locally calibrate the baselines are
    made close to solar noon and under clear sky conditions. This assumption is problematic
    because weather conditions change with location, time of day and day of the year,
    and the baselines for the same crop will consequently change with weather conditions
    (Payero and Irmak, 2006). Researchers from different places have, therefore, reported
    different baselines for the same crop (Idso et al., 1981, Irmak et al., 2000,
    Nielsen and Gardner, 1988, Payero and Irmak, 2006, Steele et al., 1994, Yazar
    et al., 1999). The lack of transferability of the baselines, together with the
    restriction of having to make required measurements close to solar noon and under
    clear sky conditions, are major drawbacks of using the empirical CWSI method for
    irrigation scheduling (Alves and Pereira, 2000). 3. Remote sensing methods Even
    though the usefulness of canopy temperature, measured from infrared thermometry,
    has been established in several studies for monitoring plant water stress, there
    are physiological and operational concerns that support the development of alternative
    narrow-band indices, based on the visible and red edge spectral region for detecting
    water stress in crops (Berni et al., 2009b, Dangwal et al., 2015, Panigada et
    al., 2014, Rossini et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2015, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2013,
    Zhao et al., 2015). In some plants, the diurnal fluctuations in stomatal conductance
    are such that the relationships between canopy temperature and stress levels are
    not clear-cut. An increase in evaporative demand due to high vapor pressure deficits
    induces a constant decline in leaf conductance, even when the crops are well watered
    (Zarco-Tejada et al., 2012). Again, monitoring of large cropped fields requires
    appropriate imagery at high spatial and spectral resolutions, as well as short
    revisit periods (Berni et al., 2009b). Although the use of remote sensing in agriculture
    was proposed few decades ago, it has not been widely adopted until recently, mainly
    because of the widespread adoption of emerging technologies that integrate high-resolution
    thermal cameras on board UAS (Berni et al., 2009a, Elston, 2016, Suárez et al.,
    2010, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2013). The potential applications of UAS in agriculture
    include; crop scouting, mapping canopy coverage, determining plant stresses, measuring
    soil moisture, managing variable-rate irrigation, and crop yield estimation (Ehsani
    et al., 2016). Recent researchers have proposed the integration of remotely sensed
    data with soil water balance method to improve irrigation water management. For
    instance, Campos et al. (2016) estimated total available water in soil by integrating
    evapotranspiration data and multispectral imagery. Filion et al. (2016) used remotely
    sensed image to map soil moisture in the Mediterranean regions to support water
    management and agricultural practice. Zhang et al., 2017a, Zhang et al., 2017b
    integrated airborne imagery data into a soil water balance model to improve the
    estimation of soil water deficit for maize and sunflower grown under full and
    deficit irrigation treatments. Therefore, UAS will be a vital tool for growers
    soon, because they can cover large areas, and take advantage of new sensing, mapping
    and data analytic technologies. Image resolution is improving and costs are also
    decreasing with time. Real time mapping and rapid image analysis also provide
    for early detection of plant water stress for timely irrigation scheduling, due
    to the potential to scale up information from the leaf to canopy/field levels
    (Gago et al., 2015) 3.1. Spectral reflectance indices The focus on indicators
    other than thermal infrared indices for monitoring water stress is because leaf
    temperature, though a direct indicator of plant transpiration, does not directly
    account for other physiological changes such as photosynthetic pigment changes
    or non-stomatal reductions of photosynthesis under water stress conditions (Zarco-Tejada
    et al., 2013). The spectral vegetation indices that have been correlated to plant
    water stress are given in Table 2. The Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) (Gamon
    et al., 1992), and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence emission (Flexas et
    al., 2002, Moya et al., 2004), are pre-visual indicators of water stress which
    serve as an indirect means for water stress detection (Berni et al., 2009b, Suárez
    et al., 2010). Table 2. Spectral vegetation indices that has been correlated to

    the reflectances at the respective wavelengths, nm. The PRI is sensitive to the
    epoxidation state of the xanthophyll cycle pigments and to photosynthetic efficiency
    (Gamon et al., 1992, Suárez et al., 2010). The functional basis of the PRI is
    based on its sensitivity to rapid changes in carotenoids through the de-epoxidation
    of the xanthophyll pigments (Magney et al., 2016), and to heat dissipation increasing
    under water stress conditions (Panigada et al., 2014). When the light absorbed
    by plants exceeds their photosynthetic demand, energy dissipation occurs to avoid
    damage to the tissues (Rossini et al., 2013). The plants dissipate this excess
    energy non-destructively through re-emission of photons as fluorescence (radiative
    dissipation), and by conversion of light energy into heat in the pigment bed (thermal
    dissipation). Previous studies have demonstrated that the interconversion of the
    xanthophyll cycle pigments can be detected in leaves as subtle changes in reflectance
    at 531 nm (Gamon et al., 1992, Gamon et al., 1997). Recently, researchers have
    shown the sensitivity of PRI for crop water stress detection over short time scales
    (Gamon et al., 1997, Suárez et al., 2009, Suárez et al., 2010, Zarco-Tejada et
    al., 2012, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2013), whereas studies conducted over longer time
    scales reported contrasting results, at the leaf and canopy scales (Gamon, 2015,
    Magney et al., 2016, Rahimzadeh-Bajgiran et al., 2012). The studies generally
    observed that there are certain issues with the index, such as leaf biomass, background
    reflectance, sensor spectral responses, and viewing-illumination geometry effects.
    Therefore, different researchers proposed new formulations for the index, using
    alternative reference bands (Hernández-Clemente et al., 2011). Zarco-Tejada et
    al. (2012) obtained higher correlations in a citrus orchard with PRI515 for stomatal
    conductance (gs) and leaf water potential (Ψ). Panigada et al. (2014) showed a
    high corelation between PRI586 and EWTcanopy, for cereal crops. Berni et al.,
    2009a, Berni et al., 2009b normalized the standard PRI using the Renormalized
    Difference Vegetation Index (RDVI), an index that is sensitive to canopy structure,
    and a red edge index that is sensitive to chlorophyll content ( ). The new index
    (PRInorm) not only detects xanthophyll pigment changes as a function of water
    stress, but also normalizes for the chlorophyll content level and canopy leaf
    area reduction induced by stress. The PRInorm, showed an improved capacity for
    water stress detection (correlated with leaf stomatal conductance, gs and leaf
    water potential, Ψ) in comparison with other greenness and structural indices
    (Gago et al., 2015). Several other researchers have used the PRI and PRInorm for
    water stress detection as an alternative to thermal measurements, with varying
    degrees of success (Behmann et al., 2014, Cheng and Wang, 2014, Colombo et al.,
    2008, Dangwal et al., 2015, Meroni et al., 2008, Meroni et al., 2009, Panigada
    et al., 2014, Peñuelas et al., 2011, Rossini et al., 2013, Suárez et al., 2009,
    Suárez et al., 2010, Wang et al., 2015, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2009, Zarco-Tejada
    et al., 2013). Rossini et al. (2013) revealed the feasibility of mapping water
    stress using spectral vegetation indices, taking advantage of the high spatial
    resolution capabilities that are more difficult in the thermal region. The studies
    revealed the potential applicability of remote sensing data in precision agriculture
    for improving irrigation scheduling. Nevertheless, the sensitivity of PRI measured
    at the crop canopy level requires further investigation, including an assessment
    for a new index formulation for high value vegetable crops, in order to optimise
    yield and productivity. 3.2. Structural indices Structural Indices are based on
    the reflectance of leaves in the visible and near-infrared bands of the electromagnetic
    spectrum. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index ( ) is the best-known vegetation
    index, used as a numerical indicator of vegetation greenness (Leroux et al., 2016,
    Zhao et al., 2015). The is an indication of the amount of chlorophyll and fraction
    of green cover. It is used in irrigation studies for mapping of crop cover as
    a means for estimating crop coefficients (Kc) for use in the conventional FAO-56
    method (Allen et al., 1998), and for irrigation scheduling (Jones, 2012). Previous
    studies have also shown that NDVI has a linear relationship with the basal crop
    coefficient for ET (Kcb), because Kcb primarily depends on the dynamics of plant
    canopies (cover fraction, LAI, greenness). Based on this, several researchers
    have used NDVI to predict Kcb for various agricultural crops (Allen et al., 2005,
    Choudhury et al., 1994, Irmak et al., 2011, Kamble et al., 2013, Kullberg et al.,
    2017, Jayanthi et al., 2000). Roujean and Breon (1995) and Haboudane et al. (2002)
    showed that empirically derived NDVI products are unstable, because they are affected
    by soil reflectance and sun view geometry. In an attempt to improve , the Renormalized
    Difference Vegetation Index ( ), Optimised Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index ( ),
    and Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index ( ), were developed
    to minimize soil brightness influences from spectral vegetation indices involving
    red and Near-Infrared (NIR) wavelengths and to reduce the variability of the photosynthetically
    active radiation due to the presence of diverse non-photosynthetic materials.
    Subsequently, was established (Haboudane et al., 2002) to make accurate predictions
    of crop chlorophyll content from hyperspectral remote sensing imagery. The ratio
    has been shown to be relatively insensitive to canopy cover variations, even for
    very low LAI values. Apart from their use in yield estimation, structural indices
    , , , , and are useful in plant stress monitoring to capture the changes in canopy
    structures caused by water stress (Haboudane et al., 2002, Roujean and Breon,
    1995, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2012), and this is due to their positive correlations
    with stomatal conductance and leaf water potential (Gago et al., 2015). For instance,
    NDVI and TCARI/OSAVI were clearly related to the stem water potential (Ψstem)
    and gs in vineyards cv. Tempranillo (Baluja et al., 2012). However, in Citrus
    orchards the indices were less correlated with gs (Zarco-Tejada et al., 2012).
    Usually, most structural indices are more related to plant vigor than the plant
    physiological status, and might correlate well in crops where the biomass proportionally
    increases in parallel to photosynthesis. While the studies demonstrated the feasibility
    of narrow-band indices obtained from hyperspectral sensors onboard UAVs for monitoring
    plant water stress, the results indicate that the sensitivity of the indices at
    the plant canopy level needs further study, before they could be adopted for precision
    irrigation water management. 3.3. Water indices Typically, the water-absorption
    bands in the 1300–2500 nm region show the highest sensitivity to leaf water concentration
    in most crops (Carter, 1991). However, the absorption by water in this region
    is very strong, so that infrared bands are inadequate for measuring the water
    concentration of the plant canopies (Peñuelas and Filella, 1998). Therefore, a
    reflectance trough in the near-infrared region at 950–970 nm, corresponding to
    a weaker water absorption band has been shown to be effective for representing
    the total plant or canopy moisture content (Peñuelas et al., 1997). When plants
    are water stressed, the 970 nm trough of the reflectance spectrum tends to disappear
    and to shift towards lower wavelengths (Peñuelas and Filella, 1998), and this
    concept was used to develop a reflectance water index and simple ration water
    index (Zarco-Tejada et al., 2003). The reflectance at 900 nm is used as a reference
    because there is no absorption by water at this wavelength, but it is subjected
    to the same changes in sample structure as the reading at 970 nm. This water index
    has been found to be highly correlated with plant water content in several crops
    (Peñuelas et al., 1997, Dawson et al., 1999, Wang et al., 2015). Peñuelas et al.
    (1997) observed a strong correlation between greenness and moisture content, and
    proposed the ratio as a better indicator of canopy water content than the water
    index itself. Gao (1996) used the Normalized Difference Water Index ( ) to monitor
    changes in water content of leaves using NIR (Near Infrared) and SWIF (Short Wave
    Infrared) at a wavelength of approximately 860 nm, and the other at 1240 nm, respectively.
    The SWIR reflectance reflects changes in both the vegetation water content and
    the spongy mesophyll structure in vegetation canopies, while the NIR reflectance
    is affected by leaf internal structure and leaf dry matter content but not by
    water content. The combination of the NIR with the SWIR removes variations induced
    by leaf internal structure and leaf dry matter content, thereby, improving the
    accuracy in retrieving the vegetation water content (Wang et al., 2015). However,
    Gao (1996) noted that is responsive to changes in water content of plant canopies,
    but is less sensitive to atmospheric aerosol scattering effects than . It is therefore,
    complementary to, not a substitute for . Nevertheless, previous studies have shown
    the relevance of water indices ( , , and ) for monitoring plant water stress in
    wheat and maize crops. For instance, Panigada et al. (2014) obtained a significant
    correlation between WI and EWTcanopy; Rossini et al. (2013) showed a high correlation
    between and RWC; while Wang et al. (2015) obtained a good relationship between
    and leaf water content, and concluded that the narrow bands at 780 and 1750 nm
    are sensitive to the water parameters of spring wheat. The interest in reflectance
    indices is to use them to scale-up to satellite imagery since the use of thermal
    imagery is unreliable due to its poor resolution, which obtains mixed information
    from the plant and the soil background. The researchers showed the possibility
    of mapping plant water stress using hyperspectral indices, but observed that the
    translation of this finding in accurate irrigation scheduling requires further
    investigations. 4. Concluding remarks and future perspectives Conventional irrigation
    scheduling techniques rely on soil moisture measurements, climatic data, and physiological
    measures of plant response to assess water stress. The approach is inadequate
    due to the high costs of sensors and their installation, and the difficulty with
    obtaining measurements, especially for heterogeneous soil and crop canopies. Plant
    indicators commonly used to determine crop water status are leaf water potential
    and stomatal conductance, but their measurements are either destructive, labour
    intensive or unsuitable for automation, which make it difficult for irrigators
    to adopt. Thus, automated techniques for monitoring crop water status that would
    provide non-destructive, rapid, and reliable estimates of plant water status are
    needed. Spectral vegetation indices acquired from hyperspectral sensors onboard
    UAS have been identified as a valuable tool for monitoring plant water status
    and improving irrigation water management. Generally, most physiological studies
    on plant water stress report relatively significant relationships (with R2 values
    of 0.5 or less) between a remotely sensed parameter such as NDVI or PRI and a
    measure such as leaf area index, stomatal conductance, and leaf water potential.
    Unfortunately, this sort of precision is inadequate to allow the use of single
    measurements of the parameters (e.g., NDVI or PRI) for estimation of plant water
    status. Therefore, innovative data management techniques that would integrate
    data from soil-based and plant-based approaches are needed to widen the scientific
    knowledge on the use of crop stress parameters to schedule irrigation, and provide
    irrigators with advanced tools for decision making. Even though spectral reflectance
    indices have been proposed for water stress detection in various crops, most of
    these studies focused on different species of tree and cereal crops. To our knowledge,
    the use of narrow-band optical indices for detecting water stress and scheduling
    irrigation has not been extensively investigated for high value vegetable crops
    in water stressed regions and environments, and growing conditions. Furthermore,
    since VIs for water stress detection are crop and climate specific, it is imperative
    to investigate the spectral VIs needed to improve the productivity and yields
    of vegetable crops. The potential is enormous based on recent advances in sensor
    technologies, image analysis and processing, computer based decision making, and
    in the measurement of hyperspectral indices from UAS. Again, leaf spectral properties
    are not solely dependent on plant water status. Factors such as soil background,
    canopy structure, leaf thickness, leaf age, differences in surface properties
    of leaves, and variations in leaf angle could influence the correlation between
    spectral response of leaves and plant water status. Future research should focus
    on the integration of thermal and narrow-band hyperspectral imagery to provide
    more precise information about plant water status, and the real-time data analysis
    and detection of plant water stress using advanced data analysis techniques that
    would be cost-effective and commercially available to farmers. Acknowledgment

    Metrics Abstract Growth and development of cereal crops are linked to weather,
    day length and growing degree-days (GDDs) which make them responsive to the specific
    environments in specific seasons. Global temperature is rising due to human activities
    such as burning of fossil fuels and clearance of woodlands for building construction.
    The rise in temperature disrupts crop growth and development. Disturbance mainly
    causes a shift in phenological development of crops and affects their economic
    yield. Scientists and farmers adapt to these phenological shifts, in part, by
    changing sowing time and cultivar shifts which may increase or decrease crop growth
    duration. Nonetheless, climate warming is a global phenomenon and cannot be avoided.
    In this scenario, food security can be ensured by improving cereal production
    through agronomic management, breeding of climate-adapted genotypes and increasing
    genetic biodiversity. In this review, climate warming, its impact and consequences
    are discussed with reference to their influences on phenological shifts. Furthermore,
    how different cereal crops adapt to climate warming by regulating their phenological
    development is elaborated. Based on the above mentioned discussion, different
    management strategies to cope with climate warming are suggested. Similar content

    USA Article Open access 08 October 2022 Introduction Cereal crops are typically
    grasses grown for their edible grains. Globally, cereal grains are produced in
    higher quantities than any other type of crop and deliver more food energy to
    human beings and livestock than other crops1,2 (Fig. 1). The cereal production
    of the top 20 countries in the world is presented in Table 1. Figure 1 Cereals
    grain production. Full size image Table 1 World cereal production of top 20 countries
    during 2012–2016 (metric tonnes). Full size table Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.),
    rice (Oryza sativa L.), maize (Zea mays L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and oat
    (Avena sativa L.) are important cereal crops in most countries. Other includes
    rye (Secale cereal), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), and millet (Pennisetum glaucum).
    These crops belong to the family Poaceae or Gramineae subfamily Oryzeae (Genus
    Oryza: Rice), Triticeae (Genus Triticum: Wheat, Hordeum: Barley, Scecale: Rye),
    Aveneae (Genus Avena: Oat), Paniceae (Genus Pennisetum: Millet), Andropgonee (Genus
    Sorghum, Zea: Maize, Coix: Jobs’s tears) and Cynodonteae (Genus Eleusine, Ragi).
    They contribute over 50% of world''s total production of cereals in million tonnes3,4,5,6.
    Cereals as whole grain are a rich source of minerals, carbohydrates, vitamins,
    oils, fats, protein, fiber content and are preferred for consumption7,8,9,10 (Table
    2). Table 2 Nutritional values of cereals per 100 g. Full size table Local and
    regional climatic conditions are a primary determinant of agronomic crop productivity.
    Plant metabolic processes are controlled by weather variables like maximum and
    minimum temperature, solar radiation, carbon dioxide concentration and availability
    of water11,12,13,14,15,16,17. Cereal crop production is influenced by extreme
    climatic conditions, like heat waves, storms, drought, salinity and flooding17,18,19,20,21,22.
    Similarly, Nicholson et al.23 reported change in the seasonality of rainfall in
    large part of Africa. Similar kind of spatiotemporal changes in aridity and shifts
    of dryland in Iran was concluded by Pour et al.24 which could have severe effect
    on agricultural production and food security. The release of greenhouse gases
    due to different anthropogenic activities have affected agricultural activities
    across geographical regions7. Distant changes in air temperature resulted to significant
    change in plant phenology8,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32. During the previous century,
    but predominantly over the most recent decades, the earth has experienced noteworthy
    climate change, particularly warming trends across globe. The average air temperature
    has increased almost 0.95 °C from 1980 to 2018, and it is predicted to increase
    almost 3.0–5.0 °C (depending on region) by the end of this century. In the meantime,
    world population has grown considerably and will continue to grow at an increasing
    rate. It is expected that the world will need 70% more food by the middle of the
    current century15,33. Food security and climate change mitigation are major challenges
    in developing countries. Changes in management practices such as fertilizer use
    efficiency, use of organic fertilizers, use of legume with grasses, optimization
    of irrigation water, plant breeding and genetic modifications and selection of
    cultivars in field could be good mitigation strategies to coup climate change15,34,35.
    These adaptive mitigation strategies could help to design resilience systems to
    future climate change. Similarly, promotion of climate smart agriculture (CSA)
    could help to mitigate the challenges of climate change. CSA aims to transform
    and redirect agricultural system to support sustainable development and food security
    under changing climate. It integrates three elements of sustainable development
    (economic, social, and environmental) by addressing food security and climate
    change. It has three main pillars (i) Sustainably increasing agricultural productivity
    and incomes (ii) Adapting and building resilience to climate change and (iii)
    Reducing and/or removing greenhouse gas emissions. Climate change can greatly
    influence overall food security by influencing cereal crop phenology and changing
    spatial allocation of crops. According to earlier work, it has been predicted
    that a 2.0 °C rise in average temperature can lead to a more than 20 to 40% reduction
    in cereal grain production, particularly in Asia and Africa. Furthermore, temperature
    rise can have either negative or positive impacts on crop productivity depending
    upon regions36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48. Shift in the seasonality is
    the one of the big example of rise in temperature49. Temperature is the most important
    environmental attribute influencing growth and development, and hence, ultimate
    productivity of agronomic cereal crops. Rise in temperature also leads to higher
    evapotranspiration, more crop water and nutrients loss thus resulting to lower
    water use and nitrogen use efficiency. The effect of temperature on crop phenology
    could be documented by using GDD or heat units. Heat units, expressed in growing
    degree-days (GDD), are frequently used to describe the timing of biological processes.
    The basic equation used is $$GDD= \left[\frac{\left({T}_{maximum}-{T}_{minimum}\right)}{2}\right]-{T}_{base}$$
    where Tmaximum and Tminimum are daily maximum and minimum air temperature, respectively,
    and Tbase is the base temperature. It also controls the rate of development from
    emergence to physiological maturity50,51,52,53,54. All cereal crops have a basic
    requirement of temperature for completion of a given phenological phase, or the
    entire life cycle55,56,57,58. The daily maximum and minimum temperature play a
    significant role in determining the optimum sowing time or window and defining
    the seasonal duration, thus both can affect the achievable yield, produce quality,
    and along with their sustained productivity59,60,61,62,63,64. Normally, the longer
    the optimum growing season, then higher the duration for maximum grain production.
    Luo65, reviewed threshold temperature of different crops and stated that identification
    of threshold temperature is very important aspect of climate change risk assessment.
    Furthermore, cardinal T (Base T = Tbase, optimum T = Topt1 and Topt2, and failure
    point T = Tfp) and lethal T (Lethal minimum T = Tlmin and lethal maximum T = Tlmax)
    have strong association with crop production. Cardinal and extreme temperature
    thresholds for the major cereal crops were reviewed by Ramirez-Villegas et al.66
    as shown in Table 3. Threshold temperature for the different phenological stage/phase
    of the wheat crop have been presented in Table 4. Table 3 Cardinal (Base (Tb),
    optimum (Topt) and maximum (Tmax)) and extreme temperature thresholds (Ceiling
    vegetative temperature (TC1) and Ceiling reproductive temperature (TC2)) for cereal
    crops. Full size table Table 4 Temperatures (Base (Tb), optimum (Topt) and maximum
    (Tmax)) for different phenological phases and stages in wheat. Full size table
    The predicted changes in temperature during the next 40 to 70 years are expected
    to be in the range of 2–3 °C in different regions. Intensity and duration of warming
    trends and heat wave events are predicted to become more extreme in future than
    at present and during last decade67,68,69. Extreme temperature events have short-term
    spells of a few days with temperature increases over 5.0 °C above normal. Frost
    caused sterility and abortion of grain whilst extreme heat caused a decrease in
    the number of grains and reduced grain filling duration70,71,72. Day-to-day minimum
    temperatures will rise more rapidly compared to daily maximum temperatures leading
    to increased mean temperatures. These variations have detrimental effects on yield52,73.
    The work by Srivastava et al.74 concluded that maximum temperature affects the
    maize grain yield more than the minimum temperature under variable CO2 levels
    in both irrigated and rainfed conditions. Furthermore, their study confirmed that
    maize yield was low for RCP 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5 under irrigated as compared
    to rainfed condition. If such changes in temperature will remain occurring in
    future, then adaptation strategies such as change in sowing date and cultivars
    shifts are needed to offset such impacts75,76,77,78. Crop phenology is the most
    significant feature of crop adaptation, and spatial and temporal changes in phenological
    stages and phases provide well-built indications of the biological influence of
    thermal trend. Change in phenological seasonality is having both direct and indirect
    effects on natural vegetation and cereal crop productivity25,26,79,80,81. Measured
    climate-warming trends have been implicated as a reason for accelerated cereal
    crop growth rates and reduced growing durations. Since phenology is highly sensitive
    to climate change and has significant impact on carbon balance. Thus the asymmetric
    and opposing response of phenology to daytime and night-time was studied by Wang
    et al.82 and concluded that Tmax and night-time Tmin had opposite effects on the
    timing of start of the season, delayed end of the season and prolonged length
    of growing season. Furthermore, several earlier studies documented that the intensity
    of the response of phenological stages and phases of agricultural crops to warming
    trend is variable at spatio-temporal scales79,83,84. Phenology is well known climate
    change indicator. However, there is a lack of critical analysis of climatic warming
    impacts on cereal phenology shift and management of climatic impacts to ensure
    future global food security. Therefore, a major objective of this review is to
    analyze the phenological fingerprinting of cereal crops in response to climate
    warming, and to discuss important management strategies to overcome the climate
    warming impacts on phenological shift of cereal crops. Climate warming The global
    environment is changing with increasing temperature and carbon dioxide concentration
    [CO2]. Generally, burning of fossil fuels are the principle source of climate
    warming. Jackson et al.85 reported that global CO2 emissions by fossil fuel burning
    in 2017 were 36.2 billion tonnes, which reached to 37.1 billion tonnes in 201886.
    Additionally, CO2 emissions due to biomass combustion were approximately 1/3rd
    of the fossil fuel emissions during 1997–201087. These CO2 emissions contribute
    to global warming and the current fossil fuel reserves have the potential to increase
    the global temperature up to 2 °C by 2050. Phenology of crop is codetermined by
    environmental conditions (thermal time requirement) and agronomic practices (Sowing
    date and cultivar features). Detection of climate warming impact on phenology
    is not easy mainly because of change in sowing date and introduction of new cultivars.
    Warming accelerate crop development but it could result to delayed development
    for long duration cultivar or late sowing date. The impact of climate warming
    can be mitigated by use of new cultivars with longer thermal time requirement.
    It has been documented earlier that 1/3rd of the increased temperature impact
    on phenology was compensated by the introduction of new cultivars with altered
    temperature requirements. Globally, the climate warming and other stresses are
    contributing towards yield losses and advocating the necessity of changing the
    crop calendar (Fig. 2)57,88,89,90,91. This necessity for changing the crop calendar
    is mainly because of changes in the timing of plant phenological stages or events
    that respond to temperature (Fig. 2). This change in cropping calendar might have
    positive or negative impacts on productivity, depending on type of crop and geographical
    locations92. He et al.37 reported delayed sowing dates and use of longer duration
    cultivars are possible management adaptation options needs to be considered to
    adapt to climate change. Their results indicated that farmers have a wider sowing
    window in spring and can select frost tolerance and long growing season cultivars
    that can mitigate detrimental effects of climate warming. Thus, it is very significant
    to study the climate warming effect on cereal crops phenology. Figure 2 A simple
    presentation of climate warming effects on growth and development of crop plants.
    Full size image Impact of climate warming on phenological shift Phenological stages
    of the crop plant are set very strictly to the seasonality of the environment
    and are therefore influenced by changes in the environment. Furthermore, the duration
    of phenological stages is also associated with CO2 assimilation, so a shift in
    phenology may affect crop yield. Tao et al.38 explored the climate-crop-region
    relation for major crops, i.e., rice, maize and wheat over a period of 1951–2002
    and reported a trend of 3.2 × 105, − 1.2 × 105, and − 21.2 × 105 t decade−1 change
    in production of rice, maize and wheat respectively. They found different impacts
    of climate warming in different regions. For instance, in northeast China; rice
    production increased, and in northeast and north regions maize and wheat yield
    decreased in all studied regions. Wang et al.7 reported shortening of vegetative
    and reproductive growth phases of double rice grown across southern China in response
    to temperature increase. Blecharczyk et al.93 investigated phenological and climate
    warming data of winter rye grown in Poland from 1957 to 2012 and reported an increase
    of 2 °C in average temperature. During this period, they observed significant
    delay in sowing dates and an advancement of 4 days decade−1 in flowering initiation.
    These changes occurred due to the relative thermal requirement of the crops and
    cultivar effects. They also reported compensatory effects of cultivars and management
    practices on crop phenology in response to climate warming. Increased temperature
    speeds growth, which leads to reduced yield. Ahmad et al.94, Huang and Ji95 and
    Wang et al.96 reported negative correlations of temperature rise with all the
    phenological stages besides cotton yield in central and lower Punjab regions of
    Pakistan. They further reported that about 30% of the negative consequences of
    climate warming are compensated by sowing new cotton cultivars with high thermal
    requirements. Although climate warming is a long and continuous process, it has
    accelerated during the industrial revolution i.e., after the mid-twentieth century.
    With rapid industrialization, emission of CO2 increased in the atmosphere and
    increasing population lead to deforestation to clear new residential area. Earlier
    crop flowering and maturity have been observed during the last few decades, but
    crop management also has impacted the effect of climate warming. Siebert and Ewert52
    reported spatial differences in climatic effects in different regions of Germany
    due to temperature and day length effects. Compensation of climatic warming effects
    on cotton, wheat and rice (30, 21 and 35%, respectively) grown in Punjab, Pakistan,
    using new cultivars with higher thermal requirements are also reported88,94. However,
    they reported spatio-temporal differences in the crop species for response to
    climate warming. Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) is a very important crop in arid,
    marginal and warm regions throughout the world, and it is affected by climate
    warming. Srivastava et al.97 analyzed the impact of climate change on sorghum
    using the InfoCrop-SORGHUM simulation model. They reported regional variation
    in response to climate warming and projected a 7% yield reduction up to 2020.
    Sultan et al.98 assessed near-term climate warming impacts on sorghum yield using
    different crop models in West Africa. Based on 1961–1990 data, they projected
    an increase of 2.8 °C in mean temperature of 2031–2060 and robust change in rainfall
    pattern and projected 16–20% yield reduction in response to the climate changes.
    Shew et al.99 studied climate-warming impact on 71 cultivars across 17 locations
    in South Africa from 1998 to 2014 through extensive regression models. The outcomes
    showed that heat drives wheat yield losses. The reduction was 12.5% with an additional
    one-day (24 h) exposure to temperature above 30 °C. Furthermore, 8.5%, 18.4% and
    28.5% yield reduction was observed for uniform warming scenario of + 1 °C, + 2
    and + 3 °C respectively. They suggested that warming impact could be reduced by
    sharing gene pools with wheat breeding programs. Sonkar et al.100 reported 7%
    decrease in wheat yield per 1 °C rise in the mean temperature. Thus, there is
    a dire need of further research especially on the effects of climate change on
    the optimum temperatures required for different crop development stages. In short,
    climate warming has mostly negative impacts on crop species by disturbing their
    phenology, but these impacts can be compensated or converted into positive effects
    by proper management, ideotype designing and breeding of fast-growing crops with
    higher thermal requirements37,88,101,102,103,104,105,106. Role of phenological
    stages and phases in cereal crop grain production Cereal crop phenology is very
    sensitive to climate change88 as compared to other agronomic crops; consequently,
    phenological changes are frequently used to measure how climate warming influences
    the agricultural ecosystems in a particular region107,108,109. Numerous methods
    have been utilized to elucidate the intensity of the effect of climate change
    on agronomic cereal crops. The methods include analysis of satellite images on
    vegetation greenness, measurement of net primary production with Normalized Difference
    Vegetation Index (NDVI), and particularly, determination of temporal and spatial
    variations in phenological seasonality26,79,110,111,112,113,114,115. The data
    on stages and phases of cereal crop phenology and climate meteorological data
    are collected from phenological networks or through designated observation stations.
    Wheat phenology trend Wheat phenology has been affected by climate warming worldwide.
    Identifying phenological responses to climate warming is tough due to regularly
    shifting sowing dates and the introduction of new cultivars. Wheat phenological
    trend from sowing to maturity is presented in Table 5. The results showed that
    it remained maximum in northwest China during 1983 to 2004 (sowing = 13.2 days
    decade−1, emergence = 9.8 days decade−1, anthesis = 11.0 days decade−1 and maturity = 10.8
    days decade−1). However, highest trend in delaying of phenological stages was
    observed in north south regions of China during 1981–2010116. The highest reduction
    in phenological phases was also observed in northeast China11. Xiao et al.117
    observed that since 1981 to 2009, climate-warming in North China Plain caused
    dates of green-up after winter dormancy, anthesis, and winter wheat maturity to
    happen in an average of 1.1, 2.7, and 1.4 days earlier decade−1, respectively.
    Wheat phenology was recorded at three variable sites of rainfed Pothwar and it
    depicted significant variability. The highest days to flowering and maturity was
    observed at Islamabad while lowest were at Attock which might be due to variability
    in climatic conditions during wheat growing cycle (Fig. 3). Ahmad et al.88 reported
    that sowing (S), emergence (E), anthesis (A) and maturity (M) for wheat crop were
    delayed by 9.5, 1.3, 5.3 and 5.4 days deacade−1 while phenological-phases S-A,
    A-M along with S-M were reduced by 5.4, 5.5, 4.6 and 5.7 days decade−1 in Pakistan
    during 1980 to 2014 (Fig. 3). The S-M phase was reduced by 7.2, 10.7, 5.4, 4.0
    and 2.7 days decade−1 in Spain, Australia, Argentina, Romania and Germany, respectively.
    In India, Russia and USA, crop phenology was also affected due to climate change118,119.

    respectively. Shrestha et al.108 reported that sowing, transplanting, anthesis
    and maturity were earlier by 5.4, 3.2, 6.2 and 4.8 days decade−1 in Madagascar.

    during 1981 to 2009 as well as in other parts of world46,70,104,120,121,122. Transplanting
    to maturity was more severely reduced than other phenological phases (Table 5).

    Maize phenology trend Phenological stages of maize were delayed in most countries
    (Table 5). Phenological phases of maize were also reduced in Pakistan (Fig. 4)
    during 1980 to 2014109. Lowest reduction of phenological phases was in China102.
    In USA, phenological stages S, E, A and M were earlier by 3.9, 3.2, 1.7 and 2.9
    days decade−1, respectively, while, S-A, A-M and S-M were shortened by 2.9, 1.8
    and 3.0 days decade−1, respectively during 1981 to 2005123,124. The S, E, A, and
    M were delayed by 3.0, 1.9, 2.8 and 4.4 days decade−1 in Pakistan during 1980
    to 2014109. Phenological phases S-A, A-M and S-M were reduced by 3.1, 7.2 and
    4.9 days decade−1, respectively in Germany during 1961–20008. Oat phenology trend
    Phenology of oat was affected due to climate warming. Table 5 shows that in Germany
    during 1959 to 2009, S, E, A and M of oat were earlier by 1.1, 1.8, 9.7 and 10.7
    days decade−1 and phases S-A, A-M and S-M were significantly reduced by 7.9, 13.9
    and 9.4 days decade−1, respectively. Estrella et al.110 reported that during 1951
    to 2004, sowing, emergence, flowering and harvesting of oat were earlier by 1.5,
    1.2, 4.9 and 6.4 days decade−1 and S-A, A-M besides S-M phases were significantly
    shortened by 3.4, 1.5 and 4.9 days decade−1, respectively. Barley phenology trend
    Phenological stages of barley were earlier in Lithuania and delayed in Spain with
    global warming (Table 5). Sujetovienė et al.43 observed that S, E, A and M were
    delayed by 1.7, 2.8, 1.1 and 0.4 days decade−1 and phases S-A, A-M and S-M were
    reduced by 1.0, 1.6 and 2.2 days decade−1, respectively during 1961 to 2015 in
    Lithuania (Table 5). Phenological phases were reduced by 1.6, 2.1 and 3.7 days
    decade−1 for S-A, A-M and S-M, correspondingly in Spain during 1986 to 200881.
    Rye phenology trend Phenological phases of rye were also reduced in Germany and
    minimally in Poland125 (Table 5). The S, E, A and M were delayed by 2.2, 1.9,
    4.0 and 3.6 days decade−1, respectively and phases S-A (1.8 days decade−1), A-M
    (1.4 days decade−1) and S-M (3.2 days decade−1) were reduced in Poland during
    1957 to 2012. Phenological stages S, E, A and M were earlier by 1.0, 1.2, 1.8
    and 1.6 days decade−1 and phases S-A, A-M and S-M were shortened by 2.9, 3.1,
    4.5 days decade−1, respectively in Germany during 1960–2013 (Table 5). Effect
    of phenological shifts on crop yield Climate warming is shifting the phenological
    stages of the crop. Crop yield is very sensitive to the accumulation of heat units
    or GDD during specific phenological events, thus by shifting the phenology, crop
    yield is also affected. Several studies reported/projected reduction in crop yields
    with climate warming due to shortening of phenological events without considering
    management practices37,137,139,148. The climate change adaptation strategies like
    cultivar shift and change of sowing dates could compensate warming effects. Although
    vegetative and reproductive phases are equally prone to climate warming37,145,149,
    the impact of high temperature on pollen viability, fertilization and post-fertilization
    processes leads to a marked decrease in final yield16,145,150. However, all phenological
    stages are not equally responsive to climate warming effects and do not have equal
    impacts to final yield12,103,127,151,152,153. Tao et al.38 investigated the effects
    of phenology shift on yield of wheat, maize and rice during 1981 to 2000. They
    reported that earlier planting of 3–6 days decade−1 and earlier anthesis dates
    decreased yield up to 110 kg/ha/yr in wheat, 168 kg/ha/yr in maize, and 20 kg/ha/yr
    in rice. Zacharias et al.154 investigated the effect of induced high temperature
    on phenology and yield of wheat and rice cultivars. They observed that high temperature
    advanced dates of anthesis and crop maturity, and reduced the duration of vegetative
    and maturity phases, and led to reduction in yield. They reported 26% reduction
    in grain yield of rice due to reduction in the anthesis and maturity dates of
    around seven to 8 days, respectively. The reduction in yield was primarily attributed
    to less time for photosynthesis and accumulation of assimilates. Warmer temperature
    during the reproductive phase led to pollen sterility and high evapotranspiration,
    which led to fewer grains and lower grain weight, reduced photosynthetic rate,
    and reduced duration of phenological events90,91. Hatfield and Prueger90 reported
    that temperature extremes during the reproductive phase could reduce the grain
    yield of maize up to 90% mainly due to pollen sterility and smaller grain size.
    Nahar et al.150 investigated the impact of climate warming on five cultivars of
    wheat. In their studies heat stress imposed by late sowing of the crop resulted
    in significant reduction in days to booting, anthesis and maturity across all
    cultivars (although cultivar differences existed). About 8–13 days reduction in
    days to anthesis and maturity resulted in 53–73% yield losses in different cultivars.
    Meanwhile, Sadok and Jagadish155 reported that nighttime warming poses a threat
    to global food security (6% decrease in winter wheat yield per 1 °C rise in night
    temperature while 4–7% reduction in spring wheat and rice yield per 1 °C rise
    in night temperature) as it is driving yield declines worldwide. Thus, they proposed
    ecophysiological framework as a guide to implement future research efforts to
    mitigate yield declines. They further elaborated that efforts should include integrated
    approaches i.e. physiology with crop modeling, breeding and management to intensify
    sustainable pathways for mitigation as intensity of climate change is becoming
    stronger and stronger day by day. Climate warming significantly impacts the crop
    phenology, which in turn leads to a reduction in yield mainly due to shortened
    phenological events coupled with less production of assimilates, pollen sterility
    and biochemical irregularities156. The climate warming impacts have been neutralized
    to some extend with shifting of sowing date and development of cultivars with
    longer duration of phenological events even under warming conditions. As climate
    warming is a continuous process, therefore, integrated research is required to
    understand the mitigation of climate warming impact for sustainable crop production
    to feed an ever-increasing world population. Consequences of climate warming Climate
    warming is threatening all living organisms including human beings. Rising temperatures
    at the poles and glaciers, increase the risk of floods, and many populated areas
    may be inundated, and fertile lands may become deserts157,158,159,160,161. The
    main consequences linked with a rise in sea level and desertification are salinity,
    heat and drought stresses, and these factors are major threats to agricultural
    production including primary cereals (Fig. 5). Figure 5 [Modified and adapted
    from Ishfaq et al.192]. Effect of climate warming on productivity of primary cereal
    crops: wheat, rice and maize across various countries/continents. Full size image
    Adaptation strategies in response to climate change Adaptation strategies in CSA
    are the only way to reduce negative effects of climate warming on cereal crops.
    Different adaptation approaches like better crop management practices, modern
    breeding, and biotechnological approaches can develop climate resilient cereals
    to help cope with climate warming56,105,106,111,127,162,163,164,165. Revolutions
    in plant breeding (molecular and conventional for incorporation desired characteristics)
    and genetic engineering (integrated transgenic techniques like marker-trait associations
    and genome-wide selection) could assist to reduce overwhelming food security concerns
    against extreme-weather conditions, through producing climate adaptive cereal
    plants166,167,168,169,170,171,172,173. Thus coping with climate warming is an
    urgent concern globally and in order to adapt cereals to changing climatic conditions,
    the following approaches are mandatory. Crop management practices Better and improved
    crop management practices can minimize negative impacts of temperature extremes.
    Under climate warming, all better crop management practices should be brought
    to the fields to get real benefits105,129,174,175,176,177,178,179,180,181,182,183,184,185,186.
    Usage of quality seed are big concerns and quality seed availability to the farmers
    are under 20%. Good quality and genetically pure seed should be provided to farmers
    to minimize negative impacts of climate change and achieve sustainable nutrition
    security6. Farmers’ access to good quality seed of cultivars adapted to diverse
    ranges is still obstructed by inadequate and incompetent seed production besides
    weak delivery systems, scanty seed policies, and excessive price of seed187. There
    are many helpful adaptation strategies related to crop husbandry reported by scientists,
    comprising abiotic factors, for example, changing sowing and harvesting date,
    crop rotation, irrigation techniques, deficit irrigation, soil management practices,
    improvement of irrigation efficiency and variation in cropping patterns etc.5,14,25,188,189,190,191
    (Table 6). Table 6 Observed changes in trend of phenology of agronomic crops in
    different countries. Full size table Raised bed planting method for maize and
    rye crop is useful to obtain maximum attainable grain yield. The most important
    approach is choosing the optimum sowing date for cereal crops under climate change.
    Changing sowing date to evade the harmful influences of high temperature at anthesis
    and during pollination and fertilization has been suggested as an adaptation tactic
    for climate warming. A change in sowing window, for example, earlier sowing of
    winter and spring cereal crops and delayed sowing of summer and autumn cereals
    to escape hot and dry periods in growing seasons, is one useful adaptation to
    climate uncertainty. Therefore, sowing of cereals has been adjusted according
    to optimum temperature conditions, resulting in substantial yield increases by
    escaping temperature stress during grain filling phase60,127. Optimization of
    sowing time, planting density, and best irrigation techniques are dynamic strategies
    to confront weather-based stresses. Establishing innovative and precision irrigation
    water management might contribute to the mitigation of negative issues related
    to climate change. Better irrigation management can improve cereal crop productivity
    under climate warming. Water-saving interventions such as direct-planted rice,
    a modified system of rice intensification and alternate wetting and drying (AWD)
    of rice were implemented in a cluster approach and resulted in enhanced water
    use efficiency225,226,227,228,229. Optimum fertilization rates are also very effective
    to decrease the impact of global warming. Optimizing fertilizer use provides for
    better adaptability by enhancing energy capture by plants, by maintaining soil
    fertility and pesticide use, and increasing productivity230,231,232,233. The significance
    of fertilizer in nourishing the world population is undeniable. Enhancing fertilizer
    use efficiency (minimizing losses like volatilization and leaching; ultimately
    nutrients availability to crops) is dynamic under climate change. Adaptation of
    integrated soil fertility management and precision nutrient management is helpful
    to minimize the negative influence of higher temperature221,234,235. Laser land
    leveling (through enhancing water application efficiency, uniform distribution
    in fields and availability to crop plants; thus increasing water use efficiency)
    can enhance cereal grain yield under warming climate. Agroforestry techniques
    could help growers to diversify their crops, and their profits, along with enhancing
    climate resilience. Integrated pest management are useful approaches to cope with
    the thermal trend impact in cereal based cropping systems173,235,236. Some important
    agronomic practices to cope with climate warming are described below in greater
    detail. Sowing date Adjustment of sowing date to accommodate the thermal trend
    is significant for proper phenology of cereal crops. Zhang et al.237 reported
    that delayed sowing might be an efficient way to coup with water stress. Climate
    warming accelerates crop growth and shortens duration of phenological phases of
    cereals. Physiological processes including photosynthesis, starch conversion and
    nutrient metabolism are negatively affected by changing phenology due to heat
    stress31,200,238,239,240,241. The use of climate-smart cultivars, besides optimum
    planting dates, can reduce risk impacts due to warming149,242. Hence, decisions
    about seed rate, planting density, spatial arrangement and other management practices
    including irrigation, nutrition and application of pesticides etc. are affected
    by planting date243,244,245. However, to get real benefits sowing date should
    coincide with growth cycle to make the optimal use of possible environmental circumstances
    and managements149,202,203,246,247,248. Planting geometry Optimum planting geometry
    can be employed for the reduction of harmful effects on phenology due to climate
    change. Plant phenology is also affected by planting geometry130,249. Crop microclimate
    is changed by varying planting geometry like planting density, row spacing, seed
    rate etc. Management of planting geometry, e.g., decreased plant density, broader
    plant or row to row distance, and skip-row configurations are adaptation strategies
    that can be adapted in the dryland farming areas for better utilization of available
    soil-water250. Nevertheless, optimum planting geometry could improve resource
    use efficiencies in crops through proper crop phenology, producing more leaf area
    and ultimately more favorable yield components and yield in cereal crops in all
    climatic conditions251,252. Planting geometry affects solar radiation interception,
    canopy coverage, crop growth rate and biomass accumulation215,253,254,255,256,257,258.
    Furthermore, with optimum planting geometry, total dry matter production and ultimately
    grain yield increase was mainly due to more photo-assimilates252. Planting practices
    have significant impact on maize productivity as concluded by Huang et al.259.
    They reported that soil temperature and growth period precipitation are determinant
    factors in dryland farming systems. Thus, they recommended that selection of suitable
    planting patterns according to the limiting factors can uplift dryland agriculture.
    Supplementary irrigations Supplemental irrigation is an important adaptation strategy
    for the reduction of harmful effects due to climate warming on cereal crops worldwide260.
    Supplemental irrigation is application of a limited amount of water at very critical
    stages for the improvement and stabilization of grain yield of cereal crops when
    rainfall is insufficient to provide adequate water for proper growth and development.
    Supplemental irrigation can minimize the impact of heat stress261. During the
    previous decades, the main source of water was canal irrigation water, but nowadays,
    water shortage is severe, so supplemental irrigation can be helpful especially
    in arid environments. Supplementary irrigation, particularly during critical crop
    phenological stages and phases, can improve cereal crop yield as well as water
    efficiency in cereal based cropping systems262. Supplementary irrigation practice
    is a simple, nevertheless, extremely effective practice that allows the farming
    community to grow and manage cereal crops by irrigating at the optimum time, without
    being at mercy of the unpredictable precipitation. Supplementary irrigation permits
    farmers to grow cereal crops during their optimum growing period, which can enhance
    grain yield and avoid crop exposure to lethal heat and drought stresses in warm
    areas, and frost in cooler areas worldwide263. Plant breeding and genetic modifications
    Plant breeding and genetics provide dynamic mechanisms for adaptation of cereal
    cropping systems to heat stress. The combination of molecular and conventional
    plant breeding and genetic methods can be helpful to recognize and develop eco-stable
    varieties with required genotype-environment combinations that will be beneficial
    in farming under changing climatic circumstances166,167,264,265,266,267. The desirable
    characters like drought, and cold and heat stress resistance, resistance to pests,
    and ability to cope with water logging and salinity can be accomplished by integrating
    conventional, molecular and transgenic techniques169,170,268,269,270. Zachariah
    et al.271 recommended use of drought-resilient food crops to mitigate the immediate
    agrarian crisis. As according to their analysis, rainfall deficit is the primary
    cause of crop failure, as compared to rising temperatures. Comprehensive overview
    of the C5-MTase gene family members in wheat was presented by Gahlaut et al.272.
    They identified 52 C5-MTases (cytosine-5 DNA methyltransferases) gene family members
    (4 sub-families i.e. CMTs (Chromomethylase), METs (Methyltransferase), DRMs (Domains
    Rearranged Methyltransferase) and DNMT2s (DNA methyltransferase homologue 2))
    that could be used to develop drought/heat stress in wheat. Molecular approaches,
    comprising the use of marker-trait associations and genome-wide selection, are
    providing opportunities for developing germplasm with tolerance to several abiotic
    and biotic stresses. The adverse effects of heat stress can be mitigated by developing
    crops with enhanced thermo-tolerance. Boote et al.273 in their work concluded
    that peanut, soybean, pearl millet are more heat tolerant than sorghum, bean and
    chickpea. Genetic diversity for climate change has previously been reported for
    cereals with the application of comparative biology, genetic diversity analysis,
    collaborative phenotyping and crop simulation modeling198,274,275. Photoperiod
    insensitivity could be incorporated by breeders; accordingly seed-filling could
    start before onset of higher temperatures. The use of modern cereal crop varieties
    is dynamic adaptation strategy for obtaining higher grain yields under climate
    change274. Adoption of improved cultivars is an important approach to adapt to
    climate variability and change. Heat tolerant varieties for cereal crops are essential
    under higher temperature stress198. Breeding and sowing of improved, resistant
    cultivars (against abiotic and biotic) are key strategies to adapt to climate
    change. Growing varieties with enhanced climate warming tolerance is important
    to maintain pollen viability, for example, grain number and grain protein163,275,276.
    Late-maturing maize cultivars enhance grain yield due to longer grain filling
    duration. Improved cultivars with resistances and tolerances to abiotic and biotic
    stresses for cereal crops can increase resource use efficiency. Growing of genotypes
    requiring more GDDs can better resist thermal stress (Table 6). Drought tolerant
    varieties can increase radiation use efficiency under climate warming conditions.
    Avoiding drought stress by genetic improvements will have a major role for ensuring
    food security and reducing grower''s exposure to drought-risk. Adapting cultivars
    with deep root-systems, mainly in areas that experience prolonged dry spells,
    could be a useful strategy under climate warming stress. Slow maturing cultivars
    also minimize the adverse effects of heat stress particularly at anthesis144.
    Biodiversity Agricultural biodiversity is essential for adapting to climate change
    (i.e., multiple cropping vs. sole cropping; diversified/integrated farming vs.
    specialized farming). Growing different varieties of crop can be beneficial in
    tackling climate-warming risk277,278,279. More diverse and longer-cycle crop rotations
    will need to combine sequences of annual row crops such as maize and soybean with
    close-drilled cereals, shallow-rooted with deep-rooted crops, summer crops with
    winter crops, and annuals with perennials in the same fields280,281,282,283. Similarly,
    increasing diversity within crops may be a powerful way to reduce agricultural
    declines from climate change as concluded by Morales-Castilla et al.284. Multi
    cropping systems and crop rotation (including leguminous or green manuring crops
    in existing cereal-based cropping systems) are useful to combat the adverse influence
    of climate change. Resilience to unpredictable weather will also benefit from
    intercropping, with the creative arrangement of multiple interacting crop species
    to diversify the field and the landscape101,172,285,286. Sloat et al.287 reported
    that warming impact on maize, wheat and rice could be moderated by migration of
    these crops over time and the expansion of irrigation. Multiple-cropping systems
    and strategies to integrate animals and crops will make more efficient use of
    natural resources and applied inputs; these include systems such as permaculture,
    agroforestry, alley cropping, intercropping and sowing C4 crops compared to C3
    crops. Diverse cropping systems with spatial diversity, and adapted to specific
    fields, soil conditions, and unique agro-ecozones can minimize negative effects
    of heat stress288. Cereal crop production resilience can be achieved by planting
    diverse combinations of cropping schemes together in the same field, and economic
    resilience through production of a range of products that can be marketed by various
    channels215,253,289,290. Multiple cropping systems can diversify the cropping
    systems. This comprised of sowing two or more cereal crops on the same field,
    either at the same time or one after another, are production intensification strategies215,253.
    Such cropping systems have the benefits of decreasing the risk of whole crop failures,
    therefore ensuring a higher level of production stability for the farm community235,291.
    Sufficient cropping systems, particularly in regions that are extremely influenced
    by the effects of climate warming, are professed as an important approach to adaptation.
    Grain yields in sequential cropping systems were higher than average grain yields
    in single cropping systems, suggesting that sequential cropping systems contributed
    towards reducing the negative impact of climate warming in comparison to single
    cropping systems83,292,293,294. Resource use efficiency through crop diversification
    can further be improved by adapting advanced production technologies, physiological
    based resilience to climate change, crop rotations, improved water and nitrogen
    use efficiencies, crop modeling as well as planning before time through the use
    of forecasting skills to adapt to climate change under current and future climate
    scenarios163,196,286,290,295,296,297,298,299,300,301,302,303,304,305,306,307,308,309,310,311,312,313,314.
    Conclusion This work has highlighted the negative impacts of climate warming on
    cereals crop phenology which will become frequent and severe in future. Climate
    warming is threatening global food security due to consequences like heat, drought,
    and salinity stresses. It has shown considerable impact on cereal production by
    shortening crop phenology. With climate warming, all phenological events occurred
    earlier and resulting phenological phases were shortened in various regions and
    countries across the globe, as a result of which plants got less time to assimilate
    CO2, and this ultimately resulted in yield reduction. The earlier wheat stages
    were observed in northwest China, and delaying was recorded in north south regions
    in China and Pakistan. The reduction in phenological phases was also observed
    in northeast China, Pakistan, Spain, Australia, Argentina, Romania, Germany and
    Pakistan. Rice phenological stages and phases were affected worldwide. The rice
    stages were earlier in Punjab, Pakistan and India, and transplanting-to-maturity
    phases were reduced in Pakistan and China. Maize phenological stages were delayed
    in most countries. Phenological phases of maize were also shortened in Pakistan,
    China and USA. In Germany and in Lithuania, oat stages were earlier while delayed
    in Spain due to global warming. However, these phases were significantly reduced
    in Spain. Rye phenological stages were earlier, and phases were shortened in Poland
    and Germany. Recommendations This impact of climate warming can be mitigated by
    developing cereal crop cultivars well adapted to climate change, changes in management
    practices e.g. sowing dates zoning of crops and by increasing cereal crop biodiversity.
    Further research regarding crop plasticity is necessary to adapt cereal crops
    under a wide range of climatic conditions in order to avoid yield losses due to
    climate warming. Similarly, wider spectrum climate change adaptation options e.g.
    change in cropping patterns, use of early maturity and less water-consuming crop
    varieties, availability of stress tolerant crop varieties, modification in sowing
    date, crop insurance, implementation of location specific technologies, application
    of modern technology, intercropping, mixed cropping, socioeconomic and institutional
    interventions, crop modeling, whole farm modeling, integrated crop-livestock management
    and plantation of tress around the field are recommended to mitigate the impact
    of climate warming. References Sarwar, M. H., Sarwar, M. F., Sarwar, M., Qadri,

    Get rights and content Abstract With climate change and population growth, the
    pathways for reducing the environmental footprint of food production are increasingly
    sought, but poorly understood. This paper sketches the environmental footprints
    of water and energy use in food production systems. The main objective is to present
    an empirical application, to help identify the main pathways to reducing the footprints.
    The agricultural system of rice, wheat, and barley production on selected farms
    in the southern Murray Darling Basin in Australia is used as a case study. Further
    insights are gained through a review of the data published in pre eminent journals.
    Together the analysis indicates that boosting water productivity and improving
    energy use efficiency in crop production operations are the two possible pathways
    to reducing the environmental footprints of water and energy inputs in food production.
    These generic conclusions have implications for water, food and environment policy.
    Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Food securityWater productivityIrrigationEnergy
    efficiencyEnergy ratio Introduction Global climate change and nutritional transition
    are placing new pressures on food production systems; demanding increased food
    security while safeguarding the natural resource base by reducing the environmental
    footprints. These pressures are additional to the conventional ones such as population
    growth, urbanization and industrialization, economic growth and food consumption,
    and land use changes and water scarcity, and seem to intensify with every passing
    year. New affluent and western adopters consume diets rich in animal-based fats
    (Pingali, 2007), which require several orders of magnitude of land and water resources
    than would be required to supply the same daily calories from cereals or vegetables
    (Molden et al., 2007). Since the diets of this affluent class are far more difficult
    to influence, the pressure on land and water resources is imminent (Zhang et al.,
    2008). Intense and brutal debate rages on global climate change and its impacts
    on local food security, with dire implications on where food production takes
    place and whose food security is protected, and at what cost (Thomas and Twyman,
    2005). With millions of consumers making transition from low- to high-energy lifestyle
    and entering into the middle-income ‘flat world’ to consume more energy, the pressure
    on global food production systems and environment would intensify further. The
    fight on climate change has just begun, but would likely be more selfish and brutal
    downright both in terms of impacting the food security of an average global citizen
    and protecting the environment. The signs of agricultural productivity fatigue
    and environmental stress are already apparent in many of the major food producing
    areas around the world (Hossain et al., 2005). Much of the additional production
    must come from intensification of land and water use currently under production
    (Rockstrom et al., 2007). Sustainability of production and sustainability of consumption
    are at risk (Pimentel et al., 2004). The continued growth of human population
    and resource consumption means producing more and more food from the same or limited
    resource base, with influence of affluence on the environment (Myers and Kent,
    2003). More simply, the natural capital had to be harvested faster than its rate
    of resource regeneration and waste assimilation (Wackernagel and Monfreda, 2004),
    leaving the environmental footprint – represents the land and water required to
    produce food for satisfying the consumption of a defined population or economy
    and to provide assimilative capacity to protect the quality of environment (Ferng,
    2001; Khan and Hanjra, 2009). Feeding a growing and affluent population will imprint
    a larger footprint on the environment. The per capita ecological footprint shows
    a positive correlation with household expenditure and a negative correlation with
    its size (Lenzen and Murray, 2001). For a sample of 93 countries the improvements
    in living standard, as measured by the Human Development Index, come with disproportionately
    larger increases in ecological footprint, showing a movement away from sustainability
    (Moran et al., 2008). Even for some of the most advanced economies, for instance
    Germany, the ecological footprints of agriculture, forestry and fishing are net
    negative compared to the actual biocapacity; imports of goods from this industry
    exceed final demand (Kratena, 2008). This is another indication that the footprints
    of consumption growth and affluence are significant. Tacking the ecological overshoot
    of the human economy is another daunting challenge. Balancing the food security
    goals against explicit social and environmental protection goals involves key
    trade-offs (Mauerhofer, 2008), requiring significant value judgement. Priority
    setting in the links between economic, social and environmental suitability involves
    a ‘triple bottom line’ approach to fund positive sum solutions, justifying more
    sustainable pathways to additional food production. The possibility of reconciling
    food production with environmental quality lies in delinking production from material
    and energy throughput, especially through more efficient use of land, water, and
    energy inputs (Picton and Daniels, 1999) due to binding constrain – a limit for
    the exploitation of non-renewable water resources or for the assimilative capacity
    of the ecosystems to absorb emissions (Kratena, 2008). Against this backdrop,
    water and energy inputs in food production systems are analyzed using data from
    selected farms in southern Murray Darling Basin in Australia; additional insights
    are gained from a brief review of the literature, to help identify the main pathways
    to reducing the footprints. Together the analysis shows that booting water productivity
    and enhancing energy use efficiency in crop production operations may be the two
    pathways to enhancing food security and reducing the environmental footprint.
    Insights from a case study The conventional approach to water and energy accounting
    computes and compares the water and energy inputs in food production by using
    different units. Comparisons of inputs and outputs among different crops and irrigation
    systems can render the analysis turbid because each input and output has to be
    measured in different units. This case study used a unique approach in that all
    inputs and outputs were converted into energy equivalent units to allow more consistent
    and meaningful comparisons. The approach of this case study was to quantify all
    outputs and inputs in energy equivalent units, including water and energy use,
    for selected crops, to help compare their environmental footprints in relative
    terms. The indicators used are: water and energy indicators (water productivity,
    net energy return, energy efficiency, energy productivity); economic indicators
    (gross return, net return, and benefit–cost ratio); and indicators of environmental
    footprint (irrigation energy ratio, and fertilizer/agrochemical energy ratio).
    These parameters are compared for: (a) selected food and feed crops (rice, wheat,
    barley); and (b) different irrigation systems (rainfed, groundwater and surface
    irrigated) to assess their relative environmental footprint and to identify the
    entry points to reduce the water and energy inputs. Energy inputs are also analyzed
    in terms of various crop production operations, to identify the most energy intensive
    operation and hence the most promising entry points to reduce the environmental
    footprints of energy usage. The case study is not intended to assess the full
    environmental footprint of crop production, rather to compare and contrast total
    energy inputs and outputs for selected crops, under different irrigation systems.
    Hydrologic and institutional context The case study data came from selected broadacre
    farms in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area (MIA) and Coleambally Irrigation Area
    (CIA) located in the southern Murray Darling Basin, New South Wales, Australia
    (Fig. 1). The MIA and CIA cover about 80,000 hectares each. Irrigation water supplies
    are regulated, the water entitlements/rights are legally enforceable and defined
    in terms of shares but actual water allocations are proportionate to the total
    water available in the river system and thus tend to vary substantially during
    wet and dry years. Both surface and groundwater withdrawals are regulated, such
    that actual data are available on water diversions from each source. September
    to February are the irrigation months and March–August (winter) are the non-irrigation
    months. Rice is the dominant crop, and the study settings are one of the biggest
    rice producing areas in Australia. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1.
    Location of the Coleambally Irrigation Area, Australia. Rice dominates decision
    making in terms of land and water management which in turn derive energy inputs.
    Farmers attempt to reduce the environmental footprint by limiting agrochemical
    use as well as growing leguminous pastures or drayland crops in rotation with
    rice. The drainage water from rice fields is recycled to maximize the utility
    of irrigation water and minimize adverse impacts off-farm. Due to limited water
    available for irrigation and strong environmental stewardship in the community,
    area caps or limits for rice on each farm are applied – the ability of the soil
    to pond water without excessive recharge to groundwater or environmental effects
    to other parties are the key factors considered for rice area caps, but there
    have been limited scientific knowledge to guide this vision to help minimize the
    environmental footprints (Khan et al., 2008b, Khan et al., 2006). Soil salinization
    due to rising watertables and saline shallow groundwater remains a major concern
    for the environment. Analysis of water and energy use A survey approach was used
    to collect quantitative information on all direct and indirect energy inputs and
    water inputs as well as financial expenditure. The survey design included the
    selection of sample farms, choice of survey method, design of questionnaire, administration
    of questionnaire, and analysis of survey data. A two-stage stratified random sampling
    procedure was adopted, in line with previous studies in the area (Khan, 2007a,
    Khan, 2007b). The first telephonic survey contacted over 100 farmers and asked
    for information on overall characteristics of the farm, major crops grown, and
    irrigation methods. The second survey was sent to the 52 farmers who showed willingness
    to participate further in the study. The first module of this survey sought retrospective
    information on crop production and environmental issues regarded as important
    by the farmers. The second module obtained detailed quantitative data on all inputs
    and outputs, expenditure and prices, and agricultural machinery and farm inventory.
    Follow up visits were conducted to obtain and validate any missing information.
    Only fully completed questionnaires were used in the final analysis. Whilst the
    sample size of this study is not large due the intrusive nature of the data, requiring
    information on farm properties, as well as the sensitivity created by the ongoing
    water reforms at the federal and state level, conclusive statements about the
    footprints of water and energy use are not possible. Because of the nature of
    this study, the main focus was the calculation of external inputs required to
    produce a unit of output, quantified in energy units. Impacts of water and energy
    use are shown in different dimensions (in monetary terms and in kilowatts), so
    as to compare the environmental footprint of selected crops as well as each crop
    under rainfed and irrigated conditions. Economic performance measures were then
    used to report the impact in dollar terms, thus giving input and output comparisons
    an economic perspective. All values are reported in Australian dollars (A$1 =
    US$0.80). The conversion of various inputs and outputs into energy equivalent
    units is as below. A standard procedure was used to convert each agricultural
    input and output into energy equivalents. The inputs may be in the form of irrigation
    water, seed, fertilizer, herbicides, machinery, fuel or human labour. The energy
    equivalent may thus be defined as the energy input taking into account all forms
    of energy in agricultural production. The energy equivalents were computed for
    all inputs and outputs using the conversion factor for wheat (Mani et al., 2007),
    barley (Hulsbergen et al., 2001), rice (Chaudhary et al., 2006), human energy
    and fertilizer (Canakci and Akinci, 2006), and irrigation water (Hatirli et al.,
    2006); multiplying the quantity of the input used with the conversion factor gave
    the energy equivalent. The energy values reported in this case study are thus
    the dietary energy value of agricultural output expressed in terms of the fossil-energy
    used to obtain it (Bonny, 1993). The direct energy inputs on the farms were human
    power, tractor and/or other implement/machinery used for the particular operation
    and electric/diesel motor to run water pump, while indirect energy inputs included
    seed, fertilizer, chemicals and irrigation water used in the production process.
    Energy from sunlight was not quantified. By far, farm water pumping energy is
    the major component of total energy input (Smerdon and Hiler, 1985). Energy in
    irrigation includes that required for constructing the water supply source, providing
    the conveyance works, installing the field irrigation system on the farms, and
    operating and maintaining the system. Both the direct and the indirect energy
    uses must be considered to assess the full environmental footprint. The indirect
    energy requirement includes the energy for manufacturing the materials for the
    dams, canals, pipes, pumps, and equipment as well as the energy for constructing
    the works and building the on-farm irrigation system. The direct energy uses,
    which are recurring energy inputs, are those for pumping and operating the farm
    irrigation system such as tubewells and water lifting and application devices.
    Since the indirect energy input per unit of water supplied from a given source
    (surface and groundwater) would almost always be the same for the farms in a given
    setting, this study considers only the direct energy inputs such that the estimate
    of water footprints are the lower bound only. For diesel engines, the energy input
    was calculated as (Hanjra et al., 1998, Khan and Singh, 1996): where Ec is the
    energy output of the machine (kW h), Fc the fuel consumption of the machine (l/h),
    Tc the time consumed in operation (h), Cv the caloric value of the fuel (kW h/l),
    L is the actual fuel consumption over fuel consumed at rated power. For electric
    motors, the energy input was calculated by the product of rated power of the electric
    motor, operation time, and load factor, such that the Cv was not required. For
    operation performed by the contractor where the farmers paid for the energy applied,
    the energy consumption was calculated based on data from similar farms, but the
    charges were ascribed among operations based on the amount the particular farmer
    paid for a particular operation to the contractor. Water and energy footprints
    Water and energy footprints of agricultural production were assessed using a battery
    of indicators shown in Table 1. Table 1. Indicators of water and energy footprints.
    Indicator Unit Definition Measurement Energy efficiency ratio The ratio of total
    energy output to total energy input Water productivity kg/m3 Computed as yield

    Energy input per unit of marketable yield Water and energy productivity kg/m3
    kW h Grain yield per unit of energy and water inputs. It captures the combined
    effect of water and energy inputs on yield. Lower values may indicate higher environmental
    footprint Net energy return kW h/ha Total energy output (kW h) − Total energy
    input (kW h) Absolute difference between energy output and energy input Agrochemical
    energy ratio % The ratio of energy inputs from fertilizer and herbicides to total
    energy input. Higher ratio may imply higher agrochemical footprint. Water energy
    ratio % The ratio of energy input from irrigation to total energy input. Higher
    ratio may imply higher water footprint. Indicators of specific energy and energy
    efficiency are integrative indicators of potential environmental impacts of crop
    production. Water energy ratio and agrochemical energy ratio focuses specifically
    on the energy from irrigation water and energy from agrochemical as a proportion
    of total energy input. These can be useful for formulating recommendations for
    rationalizing water and agrochemical use, to help achieve optimal environmental
    outcomes. The indicators are however useful for comparative purposes only; the
    actual environmental footprint may be negative or positive, for instance depending
    on fertilizer input rates and net carbon sequestration effect. Economics of crop
    production A standard cost–benefit analysis was performed for estimating the economic
    indicators such as the cost of production ($/ha), gross returns ($/ha), net returns
    ($), and benefit cost ratio, for various crops under different irrigation systems.
    The cost of production includes all in cash expenses and the imputed value of
    in-kind inputs such as family labour and depreciation for fixed assets such as
    machinery and building as well as insurance and tax payments. The gross return
    was defined as the gross value of marketable output at sale prices, net of all
    variable costs. The net economic returns were computed as gross returns minus
    the cost of all fixed and variable inputs, which include the cost of machinery,
    labour, irrigation, seed, fertilizer, and agrochemical. The cost of family labour
    was assumed equal to the cost of hired labour. The gross value of output depends
    on the price of produce received by the farmer. Commodity prices tend to vary
    significantly during the agricultural year, being lower in the period just after
    harvest and higher prior to the next sowing season. Average farm gate prices were
    used to help address this caveat. The gross value of output was computed using
    average market (farm gate) price for wheat ($187/ton), rice ($302/ton), and barley
    ($220/ton).The price estimates for various inputs and outputs are as follows:
    • Human labour priced at $128–$160/day (8 h work). • Water costs were those paid
    by the farmers to the irrigation companies. • The electricity cost to run electric
    motors to power irrigation pumps were almost $0.10/kW h, and the cost for diesel
    oil was also about $1.00/l. • Cost of tractor operation includes wage charges
    for the operator as well as fixed and operating costs. Operating cost includes
    variable costs such as fuel, lubrication, and repairs for power units and implements.
    Fixed costs include depreciation, interest on investment in machinery, property
    taxes, insurance and housing. The fuel usage was multiplied by the fuel price
    to compute the fuel cost of each operation. The lubrication costs were assumed
    at 15% of the fuel cost. • The seed rate used varied for wheat (88–110 kg/ha),
    rice (135–140 kg/ha), and barley (70–83 kg/ha), and the average price of seed
    was $0.4/kg for wheat, $0.3/kg for rice and $ 0.5/kg for barley. • The cost of
    particular fertilizer and agrochemical varied depending on the type, so the actual
    expenses reported by the farmers were used. Results and discussion The environmental
    footprints of food and feed crop production are sketched using a two pronged approach.
    First, water and energy inputs and output of selected crops are compared, using
    the indicators defined earlier. Then the water and energy inputs of the same crops
    are analyzed under different irrigation systems, and for various crop production
    operations, to help identify the most energy intensive system/operation and thus
    the potential entry points to mitigate the environmental footprints by influencing
    the production process or irrigation management. Water and energy footprints by
    crop Table 2 shows the energy inputs and outputs for selected crops namely wheat,
    rice and barley. Rice has the highest total energy input as well as water input.
    Rice also has highest yield and hence total energy outputs. But rice has lowest
    energy efficiency which means that rice produces the lowest dietary energy output
    per unit of external energy input. This implies that the environmental footprint
    of rice production may be higher than wheat or barley since rice expends far more
    energy to generate the same calorie energy than wheat or barley. Put alternatively,
    wheat and barley are more caloric energy efficient. Rice has lower energy productivity
    than wheat, which means that fewer calories of rice are produced per unit of energy
    input. The water productivity of rice (0.56 kg/m3) is not higher than wheat (1.71
    kg/m3) or barley (3.27 kg/m3) either, suggesting that more water is required to
    produce each kg of rice than wheat or barley. Table 2. Analysis of water and energy

    ratio Unit-less 2.82 3.33 2.50 This leans to the view that in terms of total energy,
    rice production for food security may have a higher environmental footprint that
    achieving the same goal through wheat production. The energetics of two crops
    simply do not stack up. However farmer’s decisions are generally guided by economics
    underpinned by agroclimatic factors. Farmers do not base their decisions on energy
    ratios either; rather they select crops according to relative profitability and
    risk. For instance, soil quality, rainfall and climatic conditions may be more
    suitable to rice production than wheat; rice production may be more profitable
    than other cereals. The economics of crop production support this notion. For
    instance, rice has highest cost of production per ha but the gross and net returns
    are also highest, thus generating higher benefit per dollar of investment for
    the rice growers. In case of rice, almost all crop production operations are more
    expensive than wheat or barley; irrigation was the most expensive operation in
    rice production, claiming 51% of the total cost. The data was analyzed to evaluate
    the combined values of energy-and-water productivity. Rice has the lowest energy–water
    productivity, due to higher water and energy inputs. Barley has higher energy–water
    productivity (1.50 g/m3 kW h) than wheat (0.56 g/m3 kW h) or rice (0.08 g/m3 kW
    h), due to lower water and lower energy inputs. Thus barley crop seems more efficient
    in terms of energy and water use jointly. However barley is produced under water
    scarce conditions as a cover crop to mitigate the agroclimatic risk, and have
    limited use as a staple food (but has significant economic value for feed and
    alcohol industry). Water energy ratio, giving the energy that comes from irrigation
    water as a proportion of total energy input, can be a good proxy for water-related
    environmental footprint of crop production. Again rice has the highest water energy
    ratio, implying that water energy input as a proportion of total energy input
    are highest in rice production. The high water input in rice production may exacerbate
    the problem of soil drainage and excessive leaching of water to shallow groundwater
    aquifers which may impact groundwater table and soil salinity dynamics (Khan et
    al., 2008b). This may typically be the case in poorly drained soils, in settings
    with shallow and saline groundwater or areas practicing continuous rice cropping
    over the seasons with little fallow land. Such unsustainable production practices
    may manifest in waterlogging and salinity problems noticed in many rice based
    systems in Asia (Khan, 2007a, Wichelns and Oster, 2006), particularly where institutional
    and policy mechanisms to protect the environment are weak. However, Australia
    has strong institutional and policy framework to minimize the potential adverse
    impacts of crop production on the environment (Khan and Hanjra, 2008, Khan and
    Hanjra, 2009). For instance the drainage water from rice fields is recycled to
    maximize the utility of irrigation water and minimize off-farm impacts. Area caps
    on rice on each farm are applied; the restrictions on rice cropped area limit
    the maximum area that can be planted to rice. The ability of the soil to pond
    water without excessive recharge to groundwater or environmental effects to other
    lands are the factors considered for rice area caps (Khan et al., 2008b). Agrochemical
    energy ratio is a more robust indicator of environmental footprint of fertilizer
    and chemical use in crop production. Both rice and wheat have nearly comparable
    values but barley has the lowest agrochemical energy ratio. This suggests that
    the potential environmental footprints of agrochemical use are lower in barley
    production. Water and energy footprints by irrigation system and crop production
    operation The estimates of water and energy inputs for various crops, itemized
    by irrigation system and crop production operation, are given in Table 3. Clearly
    wheat production under rainfed conditions have the lowest total energy input,
    compared to pump or canal irrigated systems. Rice production in canal irrigated
    systems has higher total energy input than pump irrigated systems. Barley production
    under canal irrigation has higher energy input than pump irrigated or rainfed
    systems. The comparisons thus suggest that total energy inputs are lowest under
    rainfed conditions; and canal irrigated systems have higher energy inputs than
    tubewell irrigated systems. The latter however sounds somewhat surprising since
    it is commonly accepted that pumping is the major energy input. The data show
    that this is infact the case; irrigation energy inputs are consistently higher
    in tubewell than surface irrigated systems, and this holds for all three crops,
    suggesting that significant energy savings may be possible through better irrigation
    management. Total energy inputs are higher in canal than tubewell irrigated systems
    basically due to higher fertilizer energy inputs. Together this suggests that
    more efficient agrochemical use and enhancing water use efficiency could be the
    two main pathways to reduce the energy inputs and vis-à-vis the environmental

    37.93 47.50 0.00 12.86 35.40 The analysis in terms of crop production operations
    provide a closer insight into the pathways to reduce energy inputs by targeting
    improvements in specific production operations for each crop. Apart from irrigation
    and agrochemicals energy inputs, sowing and harvesting operations are major energy
    users; energy inputs in seed bed preparation are the lowest (Table 3). Thus improved
    sowing and harvesting practices such as low till agriculture or technological
    upgrade to reduce fossil-fuel inputs by substitution with renewable energy or
    using machines running on hybrid fuels could be a pathway to make machinery use
    more environmental friendly and thus reduce its environmental footprint. The development
    of renewable energy technologies such as farm machinery using bio diesel or solar
    power is determined by the agribusiness investor priorities in global market,
    something beyond farmer’s direct control. Governments can play a role through
    subsidies or other support measures. This nevertheless suggests that factors outside
    the farming sector will continue to be important for determining the energy and
    water footprints of agricultural production. Irrigation water and agrochemicals
    are the two key energy inputs in crop production. Their comparative environmental
    footprint can be assessed by the water energy ratio and agrochemical energy ratio
    respectively. Water energy ratio is higher in tubewell irrigated systems than
    canal or rainfed systems. Improvements in energy use efficiency for pumping through
    better lifting devices, better maintenance, or technical knowledge as well as
    better groundwater mapping to identify easily accessible groundwater resources
    and subsidies on sprinkler and/or drip irrigation systems and for capacitors in
    irrigation pumpsets may all become important for addressing the negative externalities
    in tubewell based systems (Chaitra and Chandrakanth, 2005, Chandrakanth and Arun,
    1997). Where opportunities exist to exploit the gravitational energy for water
    use in pressurised systems, or for upgrading from surface to pressurised irrigation
    systems, significant savings in fossil-energy input are likely. Cleaner renewable
    energy sources for pumping water such as wind turbines or solar panels in future
    may help to reduce fossil-energy inputs in irrigation application. The data on
    agrochemical energy ratio (Table 3) shows that the ratio was lowest in rainfed
    systems; the ratio was higher in pump irrigated systems than canal irrigation,
    and this holds for all three crops. Fertilizer and chemical energy inputs comprise
    the largest share of total energy for wheat (47%) followed by rice (43%) and barley
    (29%). Fertilizer is a non-renewable, commercial form of energy. Fertilizer is
    a high-energy consuming material and its use has been increasing over time globally.
    This energy use pattern in agriculture can create serious environmental consequences
    such as nitrogen loading in the environment and receiving waters, contamination
    of the food chain, carbon emissions, and poor water quality. Excessive use of
    non-renewable energy such as chemical fertilizer to boost crop yield is not sustainable
    for a healthy agriculture in the long-term and can cause impacts on human health
    and ecosystems. However energy may be poorly used when fertilizer is not applied
    in crop production and nitrogen fixation and carbon sequestration may be lower
    (Lal, 2007). Agrichemicals, especially fertilizers, are a key energy input in
    rice and wheat production. Optimal fertilizer use can maximize yield, sequestering
    more carbon to help reduce the environmental footprints of food crop production,
    without impacting food security. Irrigation water is a second major energy input
    into crop production. Both surface and tubewell irrigated systems offer potential
    to reduce the energy input, by improving water use efficiency while enhancing
    agricultural productivity and improving environmental services–boosting multifunctional
    water productivity. To sum up, in terms of crop production operations, irrigation
    and fertilizer are the most intensive energy inputs, followed by sowing. This
    suggests that improving yields with more efficient use of water and fertilizer
    offers a potential pathway to reduce the environmental footprints of food production.
    Economics of crop production The data on cost of crop production itemized by operations
    (Table 4) supports the above argument. The major cost items are those which have
    the highest energy input as well, such that reducing the energy inputs would reduce
    both the operating cost and environmental footprint. For instance, sowing cost
    account for a major share for wheat (31%) and barley (38%); irrigation costs are
    another major item for wheat (30%), rice (50%) and barley (23%). Agrochemical
    cost account for a quarter of the total cost, for each crop. Costs of harvesting,
    another key energy consuming operation, are also significant. Lowering energy
    inputs in these operations would be a win–win outcome for the farmers in terms
    of financial cost savings as well as the environment in terms of reducing the
    negative externalities. Investments are needed in new technologies and farming
    practices that would boost energy and water use efficiency without impacting the
    environment. Table 4. Cost of production of selected crops. Operation Wheat Rice

    2.82 3.33 2.5 The overall results from the case study suggest that the potential
    pathways to reducing the environmental footprints of food production are: to improve
    water use efficiency to boost yield while protecting the environmental quality;
    and enhance energy use efficiency particularly in crop production operations and
    through optimal use of fertilizers. These generic conclusions are supported by
    the review of literature below. Insights from the literature About 40% of global
    food production comes from just 18% of global cropland that is irrigated (Rockstrom
    et al., 2007) but intensively managed. Irrigated agriculture remains critical
    to world food security but the signs of productivity stagnation and ecosystem
    stress are already apparent in many irrigated systems that are major producers
    of food. The parts of the Indus River Basin covering the Indian and Pakistani
    Punjabs and the Yellow River basin in China are now experiencing signs of stagnation
    in crop yield growth, water over-use, water logging and salinity, and land degradation
    due to the buildup of toxic salts. China, India, Iran, and Pakistan are among
    the countries where a significant share of the irrigated land is now jeopardized
    by scarce river water, groundwater depletion, soil fertility decline, accumulation
    of salts in the soil, or some combination of these factors, threatening rural
    industries and livelihoods of millions (Khan et al., 2008b). For instance total
    water depletions as percentage of net inflow increased from 69% in 1955–1965 to
    90% in 1990–2000 in India’s Krishna Basin, with almost half of this depletion
    met through groundwater exploitation at an unsustainable rate (Venot, 2008). Further
    intensification of these irrigated areas to meet future food demand can lead to
    significant impacts on the environment. Transition towards intensive but more
    sustainable irrigated agriculture therefore becomes more important for food security
    than a further intensification alone. Lowering the environmental footprint might
    also include relinquishing some of the current irrigated or rainfed areas, particularly
    where water resources are fully or over allocated and the signs of water/environmental
    stress are already apparent – e.g., climate change has created a serious water
    over allocation issue in the Murray Darling Basin (Qureshi et al., 2007); and
    lowering production in some intensively managed irrigated areas such as in India
    where signs of productivity/ploicy fatigue are apparent (Narayanamoorthy and Hanjra,
    2006) and where further intensification may lead to serious consequences for food
    security and productivity growth as well as the environment. This strategy can
    help lower the overall environmental footprint of agriculture without compromising
    food production. Boosting water productivity without compromising environmental
    quality can be a pathway to enhance food security. Water use efficiencies of surface
    irrigation systems are low in most developing countries, just 30–40% compared
    to 70–90% in most developing countries; whereas some systems in Australia achieve
    upto 95% water use efficiency (Khan et al., 2008). Inefficient water use has also
    meant low water productivity. Mean grain output per m3 of water is just 0.85 kg
    in China, less than half of some developed countries and below 1/3rd of Israel
    (2.32 kg/m3) (Hongyun and Liange, 2007). Efficient water use can enhance productivity
    but also deplete beneficial return flows, stressing the environment (Molden et
    al., 2007). Boosting water productivity and enhancing the sustainability of irrigated
    and rainfed food production without further stressing the environment offers considerable
    scope for enhancing food production. Complimentary inputs such as fertilizer and
    pesticides are often essential for boosting the productivity, but can cause environmental
    problems such as groundwater pollution and eutrophication of lakes and reservoirs.
    Chemical fertilizer application will continue to grow in most irrigated systems
    due to continued positive yield response. Balancing food production and environmental
    quality would become a major issue, again. For instance, China has successfully
    sustained the productivity levels of wheat and rice over 100 years by meeting
    50% of the nitrogen requirement from organic sources (Zhen and Routray, 2002).
    Balanced organic fertilizer use can have long lasting benefits for soil quality
    with minimal impacts on economic efficiency gains (Jacoby et al., 2002). In the
    past, as a result of increasing inputs of agrochemicals and the development of
    more productive cultivars, crop yields increased dramatically. But these modern
    production practices led to a dramatic increase in the input of fossil-energy
    (Tilman et al., 2002), which has raised serious concerns over sustainable use
    of energy resources and greenhouse gas emissions in the wake of climate change
    (Tilman et al., 2001). This higher dependency on fossil-fuel inputs also poses
    a potential threat to the growth and stability of world food production. Already
    in Australia, the energy systems are facing a number of environmental issues that
    are the subject of government policy interventions. These issues include the long-term
    depletion of national oil reserves, competing demands for water, and public concerns
    over global warming due to greenhouse gas emissions (Khan, 2007b). Efficient use
    of the energy resources is vital in terms of increasing crop production, water
    productivity, competitiveness of agriculture, and environmental sustainability.
    There is a need to reduce dependency on increasingly scarce energy resources,
    and understand the energy use pattern and energy balance in alternate farming
    systems. For instance pressurised irrigation systems can achieve a higher water
    use efficiency and water productivity but the costs of fossil-energy inputs expended
    to energize these systems are substantial. Jitters in global energy markets can
    render these systems less profitable or economically infeasible. In a given farming
    system, (like dairy, grazing, crop-based, horticulture, biofuel crop production),
    the alternate farming systems need to be identified on the basis of existing water
    and energy budgets to help understand the potential risks/benefits for producing
    high yielding crops in high-input future farming systems, typically under a low
    greenhouse gas emissions scenario. The ‘balancing act’ involves boosting water
    productivity (Molden et al., 2007) and energy productivity (de Fraiture et al.,
    2007) through a range of measures outlined below. Boosting water productivity
    1. Reducing or limiting withdrawals from rivers and groundwater through water
    saving-practices and demand management, to control water resources and limit damage
    to ecosystems. 2. Retiring production in some areas where surface and ground water
    resources are over allocated/abstracted. 3. Limiting groundwater withdrawals to
    sustainable recharge levels, and retiring some low quality saline groundwater
    aquifers. 4. Improving application efficiency, by applying irrigation when a crop
    is susceptible to water stress, and matching planting dates with periods of less
    evaporative demand, to improve water productivity. 5. Improving timing, amount,
    and reliability of water applications to boost yield and improve the quality of
    produce. 6. More efficient water use through technological change, such as gravity-fed
    drip and sprinkler irrigation, precise application practices such as level basins
    and surge irrigation, canal lining or piped water deliveries, reduced allocation
    to farmers, and water saving irrigation practices such as alternative wet and
    dry irrigation. 7. Using deficit, supplemental, or precision irrigation, to reduce
    water inputs and achieve higher yields per unit of water. 8. Improving soil and
    water management and agronomic practices that promote soil fertility, reduce salinity,
    reduce fossil-energy inputs, and improve the environment. 9. Changing crop varieties
    and cropping patterns with those that provide higher yield with minimal energy
    inputs. 10. Reallocating water among crops, to achieve higher value and higher
    output to input energy ratio. 11. Protecting water quality by minimizing salinization
    and pollution of return flows, and managing the mixing of saline water with freshwater.
    Improving energy productivity 12. Adjusting crops and crop rotations to realize
    maximum net energy outputs. 13. Reducing inputs of agrochemicals to optimal levels
    or least moderate rates, and being less reliant on these energy inputs by growing
    crops capable of biological nitrogen fixation in rotation with cereals. 14. Changing
    towards more sustainable farming practices, such as organic farming or low input
    agriculture. 15. Reverting to a higher reliance on human labour as opposed to
    machinery, where possible. 16. Replacing fossil-fuel energy inputs with renewable
    energy such as wind or solar. 17. Technological change, involving energy efficient
    farm machinery and irrigation systems. 18. Energy conservation measures and installation
    of renewable energy systems on-farm. 19. Low or no till faming, for lowering carbon
    emission from the soil and reducing energy inputs for machines. 20. Carbon farming
    or reforestation to sequester greenhouse gas emissions. Conclusion and policy
    implications Global climate change and population growth are putting unprecedented
    pressure on food production systems, intensifying the use of water and energy
    inputs and enlarging the footprint on the environment. This paper presented a
    case study of broadacre agriculture in the southern Murray Darling Basin to better
    understand the main pathways to reducing the environmental footprints of water
    and energy use. The case study results were complemented from a review of the
    data published in pre eminent journals. Together the evidence indicates that:
    • Global food production system generates considerable environmental footprints,
    and the situation would get worse as global population and economies grow. • Boosting
    water productivity and improving energy use efficiency are the main pathways to
    reducing the environmental footprints of food production. While there is no silver
    bullet to address these issues, the approach has necessarily to be multi-pronged,
    involving technologies, institutions and policy measures. One size fits all approaches
    are unlikely to work; local actions are needed to address global issues. For instance,
    the analysis of energetics of food crop production showed that wheat production
    was more efficient than rice, both in terms of water and energy inputs as well
    as agrochemical energy to total energy ratio; surface irrigation ranked better
    than groundwater irrigation in terms of both the indicators; and agrochemical
    inputs, and crop sowing and harvesting operations accounted for a major share
    of total energy inputs. Producing more food will require greater energy use and
    there will be trade-offs. The measures must sequence and package technological
    measures with supportive policies and institutions, for true gains in water and
    energy use efficiency to boost overall resource productivity while minimizing
    the negative impacts on the environment. Unremitting policy responses are needed
    for true progress towards global food security; investments in modern infrastructure
    such as irrigation, drainage, transport, agricultural research, capacity development
    and market development are warranted (World Bank, 2008). Strengthening cross sectoral
    policies is essential to generate positive sum solutions for all stakeholders,
    including environment, but the links between water and other development-related
    sectors such as population, energy, food, water and the environment remain poorly
    understood and require further research. References Bonny, 1993 S. Bonny Is agriculture

    fresh water is used in agriculture in many parts of the world, but competition
    for domestic and industrial water use is intense. For future global food security,
    water use in agriculture must become sustainable. Agricultural water-use efficiency
    and water productivity can be improved at different points from the stomatal to
    the regional scale. A promising approach is the use of deficit irrigation, which
    can both save water and induce plant physiological regulations such as stomatal
    opening and reproductive and vegetative growth. At the scales of the irrigation
    district, the catchment, and the region, there can be many other components to
    a sustainable water-resources strategy. There is much interest in whether crop
    water use can be regulated as a function of understanding of physiological responses.
    If this is the case, then agricultural water resources can be reallocated to the
    benefit of the broader community. We summarize the extent of use and impact of
    deficit irrigation within China. A sustainable strategy for allocation of agricultural
    water resources for food security is proposed. Our intention is to build an integrative
    system to control crop water use during different cropping stages and actively
    regulate the plant’s growth, productivity, and development based on physiological
    responses. This is done with a view to improving the allocation of limited agricultural
    water resources. Crop production, deficit irrigation, food security, physiological
    response, water-saving agriculture, water sustainability. Issue Section: Review
    Paper Introduction Globally, more than 40% of annual food production comes from
    irrigated land, and agriculture is the largest consumer of water, at 70% of all
    freshwater withdrawals (FAO, 2007). As water scarcity becomes more acute in many
    parts of the world, increasing the effectiveness with which agricultural water
    resources are used is a priority for enhanced food security. The world population
    is predicted to grow beyond 7.5 billion and food demand to increase by 50% by
    2030 (FAO, 2012). Using present values of agricultural water-use efficiency (WUE),
    calculations suggest that water use in irrigation will increase by 30%, which
    can be as much as 750 km3 of water. In addition to this, climate change will impact
    the extent and productivity of both irrigated and rain-fed agriculture across
    the globe, increasing crop water demand and decreasing crop productivity in many
    regions. A significant challenge for agriculture is to provide the world’s growing
    population with a sustainable and secure supply of sufficient, safe, nutritious
    food that meets dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life.
    This will probably need be done using less farmland and reduced quantities of
    water (FAO, 2002). Agricultural water productivity (yield per unit of water used)
    must be improved. Increased global food security will be impossible if agricultural
    water-resource utilization is not sustainable (Biswas, 2008; García, 2008). China’s
    population is currently over 1.3 billion and, despite social policies to limit
    population growth, is not expected to reach a peak until 2033 at around 1.5 billion.
    The country must feed 21% of the world’s population with only about 6% of the
    global water resources and 9% of its arable land (Zhang, 2011). Arid and semi-arid
    areas account for 49% of the total land area of China, and the development of
    agriculture in many regions is limited by water scarcity. This is particularly
    the case for irrigated agriculture in arid areas, which will need an additional
    water supply to meet the challenge of producing more food in the coming decades
    (Molden, 2007; Li et al., 2014). WUE can be described and quantified by different
    terms and scales. Physiologically, photosynthetic WUE is the most basic at the
    leaf level, and instantaneous WUE (WUEins, photosynthesis rate/transpiration rate,
    Pn/Tr) and intrinsic WUE (WUEint, photosynthesis rate/stomatal conductance of
    CO2, Pn/gs) are the two common parameters. Furthermore, the trade-off between
    the amount of carbon assimilated and the amount of water transpired has been quantified
    at the leaf level (Lambers et al., 1998; Katul et al., 2000): WUE ins = C a ⋅
    ( 1 − C i / C a ) 1.6 ⋅ VPD and WUE int = C a ⋅ ( 1 − C i / C a ) p a where, Ca
    and Ci are the ambient and inner leaf partial pressures of CO2 (hPa) respectively,
    and VPD(hPa) is the water vapour pressure difference (ei – ea) assuming that leaves
    and the atmosphere are at the same temperature. The constant 1.6 is the ratio
    of molecular diffusion coefficient for water vapour relative to that for CO2,
    and pa is the atmospheric pressure (hPa). However, the two parameters calculated
    according to measurement by the gas exchange method are both instantaneous values
    that can only explain short-term responses to environmental factors. At the ecosystem
    level, a measure analogous to WUEint is: WUE i * = GPP G s where GPP is gross
    primary productivity and Gs is surface conductance derived from meteorological
    variables and the latent energy flux by inverting the Penman–Monteith equation.
    Thus, inherent WUE (IWUE*) can represent WUE i * , which can be described as the
    used daily GPP, VPD, and evapotranspiration (ET) data from 43 sites around the
    world at the ecosystem level (Beer et al., 2009): IWUE * = GPP ⋅ VPD ET However,
    there are still some assumptions and limitations; for example, diurnal variations
    in GPP, ET, and VPD were neglected when exploring their linear relationship using
    daily data, but the relationship is non-linear under some particular environmental
    conditions (Katul et al., 2000). A new underlying WUE was proposed and a hysteresis
    model supporting the GPP, VPD0.5 and ET relationship was also put forward (Zhou
    et al., 2014): uWUE = GPP ⋅ VPD 0 .5 ET The formation of crop yield is the result
    of the synergistic effect of multiple factors in the field. How can we express
    crop productivity and the physiological process in the long term and the response
    to breeding and other agronomic measures? As with crop level during the growth
    season, crop WUE (WUEc) is often used to quantify the crop water productivity
    responses to crop species, genotypes, and management practices as: WUE c = B ×
    HI/ET where B is crop dry biomass, HI is harvest index, and ET is crop water used.
    From an agronomic and genetic viewpoint, it has also been argued that the important
    determinant of plant production in arid areas is the effective use of water (EUW,
    defined as maximal soil moisture capture for transpiration, which also involves
    reduced non-stomatal transpiration and minimal water loss by soil evaporation)
    and not higher WUE under drought stress (Blum, 2009). Furthermore, at the farmland,
    irrigation district, and even regional levels, the seepage, water loss, and recycled
    water in the farmland and canal systems should be considered. A systematic and
    quantitative approach to improve the multiplicative WUE chain (Eall) from reservoir
    to crop yield was put forward by Hsiao et al. (2007) to quantify the integrative
    effects of agricultural water management, engineering, agronomical, and physiological
    processes clearly and fundamentally as follows: E all = E conv × E farm × E appl
    × E ET × E tr × E as × E bm × E Y = W fg W V0 × W fd W fg × W rz W fd × W ET W
    rz × W tr W ET × m as W tr × m bm m as × m Y m bm where Econv, Efarm, Eappl, EET,
    Etr, Eas, Ebm, and EY are water conveyance, in the farm, application, consumptive,
    transpiration, assimilation, biomass and yield efficiency, respectively, WV0 is
    the ratio of the quantity of water (W) diverted out of the reservoir for the farm,
    Wfg is the quantity of water received at the farm gate, Wfd is the water at the
    field edge, Wrz is the water retained in its root zone, WET is the water in the
    root zone removed by ET, Wtr is the water taken up by the crop and transpired,
    mas is mass of CO2 assimilated by photosynthesis, mbm is plant biomass produced,
    mY is harvested yield. Typically in this literature, the numerator and denominator
    of the efficiency ratio for the overall efficiency (Eall) under poor and good
    situations showed a 12–50-fold difference in WUE when the comparison is based
    on the upper limit values of the poor and on the mid-values of the good or between
    the mid-values, which indicated that there is much potential for improvement in
    different situations. Hence, deficit irrigation is practised when farmers have
    less water than the maximum ET needs, thus increasing WUE for Eappl, EET and EY
    mainly through applying most remaining water in the root zone, forcing crops to
    extract more water from the soil and improving harvest index by regulating vegetative
    and reproductive growth (Hsiao et al., 2007). There are three ways of dealing
    with water scarcity that limits food availability: (i) by increasing the supply
    of water and land above present levels; (ii) by improving water productivity either
    by enhancing yield or by EUW; or (iii) by importing water in the form of food
    (virtual water) to cope with regional water scarcity (Fereres et al., 2011). In
    China, 63% of total water is used for agriculture, but there is substantial regional
    variation in these data. In north China, where there is extreme water scarcity
    and high productivity under most circumstances, the average water use may be 75%,
    but in arid areas such as north-west China, agriculture can use 90% of total water
    available since food production depends mainly on irrigation. Such a substantial
    commitment of water to irrigation causes significant problems for the natural
    environment, and the capacity for people to live normal lives and for communities
    to survive is called into question (Kang et al., 2009). How can we improve agricultural
    water productivity? Utilization of limited water resources can be made more efficient
    by implementing ‘water-saving agriculture’, which is an approach that includes
    more effective distribution of irrigation water, manipulation of water transport
    through the soil–plant–atmosphere continuum and an increased focus on increasing
    water availability for yield formation (Fig. 1). The central objectives are to
    take full advantage of any rainfall, efficient utilization of irrigation water,
    and improved crop WUE by integrative measures. In China, water-saving agriculture
    has been an effective way to cope with the ever-increasing food demands of the
    country. Water-saving agriculture is applied in China via a range of administrative
    policies. These are aimed at increasing the efficiency of agricultural water use.
    In practice, this is achieved by integrative technology systems including engineering,
    agronomy, and biology. Fig. 1. Open in new tabDownload slide Multiple processes
    of water use in agriculture for food security. The engineering approaches include
    rational exploitation of water resources, rainwater harvesting and storage for
    agricultural use, utilization of brackish water or recycled sewage water, desalination
    of sea water or sea ice for irrigation, which can be implemented with canal lining,
    low pressure pipe conveyance, improved surface irrigation by shortening or narrowing
    borders or furrows, surge flow irrigation based on laser-controlled land levelling
    technology and sprinkler irrigation, micro-irrigation, drip irrigation under plastic
    film mulch, and subsurface irrigation (Du et al., 2014). Meanwhile, agronomic
    approaches include crop rotation, water conservation through minimum tillage or
    no tillage, plastic film mulching or straw mulching, water-fertilizer coupling,
    use of superabsorbent polymers to increase the water-holding capacity of the soil,
    soil amendments, and anti-transpirants. Although this is a wide range of innovative
    approaches, the most challenging and potentially promising approach is the exploitation
    of plant biology to deliver ‘biological water saving’ through physiological regulation
    of water productivity. This involves exploitation via plant improvement and/or
    crop management of our understanding of the control of stomatal opening, different
    root properties, and reproductive and vegetative growth. The aim of biological
    water saving is to decrease crop water consumption without an apparent yield reduction
    under conditions where water is in limited supply. Plant physiological responses
    to deficit irrigation Stomata are pores on leaf surfaces through which plants
    exchange CO2, water vapour, and other constituents with the surrounding environment.
    In general, stomatal conductance depends on stomatal density and size, and more
    stomata will provide more pores for transpiration. Under the given conditions,
    water stress caused by deficit irrigation may result in stomatal closure and thus
    reduce transpiration rate. Many researchers have reported that stomatal density
    responds to various environmental factors and water deficit leads to an increase
    in stomatal density and a decrease in stomatal size, indicating an adaptation
    to drought (Zhang et al., 2006; Martinez et al., 2007). A study on a perennial
    grass (Leymus chinensis) showed that moderate water deficits had positive effects
    on stomatal number but more severe deficits led to a reduction (Xu and Zhou, 2008).
    Furthermore, research on peanut suggested that soil drying reduced stomatal aperture
    and stomatal conductance but increased WUE, and the response was different among
    different peanut genotypes under moderate or mild water stress (Songsri et al.,
    2013). The research progress in determining the genes regulating stomatal density
    and the possibility of increasing plant WUE were reviewed by Wang et al. (2007).
    It appears that manipulating stomatal density may be a more amenable approach
    than manipulating stomatal behaviour in achieving a better plant WUE. A supply
    of water to the plant is essential for crop growth. A minimum amount of cell turgor
    is required for cell expansion, while the activity of the cell cycle and cell
    production also requires a minimum water status. Water deficit during the growth
    and development of the plant affects different physiological, biochemical, and
    developmental processes that underpin yield formation in one way or another. How
    can we develop an irrigation method to improve crop WUE from a physiological understanding?
    The major plant adaptive response to drought at the cellular level, which has
    a proven effect on yield under drought stress, is osmotic adjustment (Blum, 2005).
    Our experimental data on cotton also showed that deficit irrigation enables leaf
    turgor maintenance under the same leaf water potential, thus supporting stomatal
    conductance under lower leaf water status, and improves root capacity for water
    uptake (Du et al., 2007). A primary response to variation in water availability
    is stomatal behaviour, and this will directly impact crop water status and carbon
    gain. Transpiration efficiency, which is WUE at the leaf level, is determined
    by the delicate interplay between transient photosystem activity, substomatal
    cavity CO2 concentration, and stomatal activity (Farquhar et al., 1989). Furthermore,
    both reproductive and vegetative growth will be impacted by plant water status
    and carbon gain but can also apparently respond directly to soil water availability
    (Du et al., 2010b). A positive and unique relationship between stomatal conductance
    to leaf water status has traditionally been considered evidence for stomatal control
    by a range of environmental factors and control of leaf water status by stomata.
    When a negative relationship is found, a mechanism that allows stomata to control
    leaf water status has been proposed (Jones, 1990). Fully irrigated plants usually
    have widely opened stomata. Plants open their stomata for CO2 uptake and carbon
    gain but will lose significant quantities of water at the same time (Kang and
    Zhang, 2004). A small narrowing of the stomatal opening can reduce water loss
    substantially with little effect on photosynthesis rate. Earlier research predicted
    that plants generally should have the capability to increase their WUE in this
    way, thereby maximizing their chance of surviving a period of drought, potentially
    without a great reduction in carbon gain and biomass accumulation. However, this
    may occur only when crops are aerodynamically well coupled to the atmosphere (Cowan,
    1988). However, during critical growth stages, it is particularly important to
    maintain plant water supply and status (McLaughlin and Boyer, 2004); successful
    plants may be those that regulate their water loss as a function of the amount
    of available water in the soil (Jones, 1990). This suggests that plants must be
    able to ‘detect’ the degree of soil drying and then respond to it, for example
    by regulating their stomatal conductance. Early work in the laboratory (e.g. Zhang
    and Davies, 1989, 1990; Davies and Zhang, 1991; Mingo et al., 2004; Dodd, 2013)
    has revealed that such a feed-forward mechanism may work through a range of chemical
    growth regulators such as abscisic acid (ABA), 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate
    (ACC), cytokinins, and plant mineral elements, which might act as ‘signals’ of
    the degree of soil drying. Some early suggestions were that synthesis of some
    growth regulators in roots may be a function of root water status, with ‘root-sourced
    signals’ moving to the shoots in the xylem stream to regulate shoot growth and
    physiology. However, there is now some doubt whether enough ABA can be synthesized
    in roots to attribute root signalling to root-sourced ABA (Christmann et al.,
    2007). There are many reports of strong relationships between xylem ABA concentrations
    and shoot physiological and developmental responses (e.g. Tardieu et al., 1992;
    Dodd et al., 2008a, b; Dodd, 2009), and we must account for this extra ABA transport
    as soil dries. Many years ago, Hartung and co-workers reported that much shoot-sourced
    ABA can be transported to roots in the phloem and recirculated to shoots, apparently
    in quantities that are dependent on soil and root water status (Hartung and Slovik,
    1991). In addition to this, Wilkinson and Davies (2010) showed that, while ABA
    in the xylem (which is always present, regardless of the soil water status) can
    be the regulator that is responsible for stomatal and growth responses to soil
    drying, extra hormone is not required to elicit a response. Alkalinization of
    the xylem sap, which often accompanies soil drying, will allow ABA arriving in
    the shoot increased access to sites of action on the guard cells, for example,
    thereby increasing the potency of the ABA-based root signal. Experiments with
    rootstocks and other tools have underlined the importance of root-sourced cytokinins
    and other hormones as components of root signals (Ghanem et al., 2011). Root signals
    may substantially reduce water loss through stomata at a time when no water deficit
    is detectable in the shoots, and may be thought of as a first line of defence
    against soil drying. With prolonged soil drying, a second line of defence may
    operate through a progressive reduction in shoot turgor and water potential, perhaps
    starting with lower and older leaves. Massive amounts of ABA will be produced
    in these wilted leaves and be sent to the upper younger leaves and buds where
    water loss will be reduced even further (Zhang and Davies, 1989). It is important
    that plants maintain a minimum water status in their meristems for some growth
    and eventually for survival under a prolonged drought. With the decreasing availability
    of water in the soil, signals from the first and second lines of defence will
    increase in strength, and stomata will close further. Part of the root system
    in drying soil can respond to the drying by sending root signals to the shoots
    where stomatal behaviour may be impacted in such a way that water loss is reduced
    (Liang et al., 1997). Understanding the processes for regulating water use and
    yield as well as quality provide some opportunity for biological water saving
    in agriculture. We need to know how this biology can be manipulated to the advantage
    of farmers, via changing methods and degrees of water availability in plant root
    zones. Furthermore, key growth stages must be identified (Fig. 2). Fig. 2. Open

    New Phytologist153, 449–460, with permission. Most plants grow in environments
    where water is frequently in short supply, and during this time, the demands of
    plants for water and photo-assimilates vary with the growth stage of the plant.
    The effects of water deficits depend on the timing, duration, and severity of
    the stress (Bradford and Hsiao, 1982). Soil water deficit at the seedling stage
    can substantially reduce the stomatal conductance leaf growth and leaf photosynthesis.
    However, such inhibition may not cause permanent injury because photosynthesis
    and growth can largely recover from all but the most severe stresses. Here, stomatal
    inhibition may be the main cause of a restriction in carbon gain (Cornic, 1994),
    while cell expansion may be limited by hydraulic and chemical influences. Cell
    division may continue under mild stress, and this ‘stored growth’ can cause leaves
    to grow faster after a soil-drying episode such that there may be no net loss
    of canopy development with time (Hsiao et al., 1976). Soil water deficit may reduce
    water loss from plants through physiological regulation of stomatal conductance
    (Davies and Zhang, 1991). Therefore, the total water consumption can be reduced
    by both a temporary (or accumulative, depending on the degree of stress) reduction
    in leaf area and a reduced rate of transpiration. Water stress can generate passive
    adaptation of plants to a condition of water scarcity, but a regulated deficit
    through a targeted irrigation treatment may be used as an active means of improving
    crop yield quality and WUE. The potential benefits of deficit irrigation given
    at different stage(s) of crop development have been tested on a broad range of
    crops. Regulated deficit irrigation (RDI), a concept raised in the 1970s, provides
    a controlled degree of soil drying at particular times in a season. In this way,
    the amount of irrigation water applied is reduced (Stewart and Nielsen, 1990),
    and this can therefore be a way of increasing water productivity (higher yields
    per unit of irrigation water applied). This technique has been used for controlling
    excessive vegetative growth (as an alternative to pruning, which may allow disease
    development of some crops). In a specific period of the growing season, irrigation
    time is limited in order to reduce the rate of canopy development. This can save
    water but have little impact on carbon gain and yield if the crop is not carbon
    limited. Penetration of more radiation to fruit developing in the canopy can greatly
    increase the quality of the fruit of some crops. The application of RDI can require
    less labour than a pruning operation and thereby increase profitability of the
    crop for farmers. After a period of water deficit, water is supplied again to
    the crop to ensure a reasonable yield of good quality. Given that most countries
    in the world now face increasing water scarcity for at least part of their main
    cropping season, how to irrigate crops with a limited quantity of water without
    losing a significant amount of yield is a major issue: how can we increase productivity
    per unit of water used, thereby producing ‘more crop per drop’ (UNIS, 2000) of
    water used? Deficit irrigation methods based on physiological responses have been
    reported to improve WUE (Goodwin and Jerie, 1992; Boland et al., 1993; Kang et
    al., 2000a, b, 2002a, b). These were often explained either in terms of reduced
    soil surface evaporation and/or a trade-off of better water use for a proportionally
    smaller reduction in yield. Alternate partial root-zone irrigation (APRI) or partial
    root-zone drying (PRD) should produce more benefits than these. Early studies
    involving partially drying part of the root system also quantified the effects
    on the ABA contents of the roots, xylem sap, and leaves in either a horizontally
    split-root system in Helianthus annuus (Neales et al., 1989) or a vertically split-root
    system with upper soil drying (Li and Zhang, 1994). These experiments were conducted
    using fixed PRD, and the roots in the dried part of the root zone experienced
    minor changes in soil water status. Much effort has been spent on developing efficient
    irrigation techniques such as RDI and APRI based on physiological response. Both
    methods can reduce transpiration and leaf growth while increasing WUE with only
    small decreases in yield while improving crop fruit quality (Dry and Loveys, 1998;
    Kang et al., 1998). RDI is usually applied during the period of slow fruit growth
    when shoot growth is rapid. However, it can also be applied after harvest in early-maturing
    varieties. It is useful for reducing excessive vegetative vigour and also for
    minimizing irrigation and nutrient loss through leaching. The scheduling is applied
    by reducing irrigation rates only in those periods when fruit or crop growth is
    less sensitive to water, and irrigation reductions are often defined as a percentage
    of an optimal irrigation rate (Chalmers et al., 1981; Girona et al., 1993). Although
    the initial goal of RDI was to improve yield and/or quality, in arid and semi-arid
    regions, the focus is related primarily to the efficient management of limited
    water resources. Environmental problems caused by an excess of nitrogen leakage
    and irrigation sustainability are also addressed by this technique. APRI has been
    proposed as a means of improving crop WUE with no (or reduced) losses in yield.
    APRI attracted considerable interest after it was first proposed (Dry and Loveys,
    1998; Kang et al., 1998; Davies et al., 2000, 2011; Gu et al., 2000). This irrigation
    method is relatively easy to apply in the field if alternative irrigation of part
    of the root system is possible. This is relatively straightforward at low cost,
    with some manufacturers of irrigation piping selling irrigation piping where two
    lines are welded together with offset drippers. The concept of elevating the transport
    of hormones from one part of the root system while the wetter soil around the
    other part of the root supplies water is derived from earlier split-root studies
    (Blackman and Davies, 1985; Zhang and Davies, 1987) and requires parts of the
    root zone to be dried and wetted alternately (Kang and Zhang, 2004). The novelty
    of this method is that a root signal from the drying roots can reach the shoots
    where physiological processes such as stomatal behaviour and leaf growth can be
    controlled (Zhang and Davies, 1990). However, Dodd (2007) showed that it is important
    not to dry the soil excessively because some xylem transport from dry roots is
    required to allow chemical signals to exert physiological control. Although PRD/APRI
    and RDI are rational in theory, it is difficult for farmers to optimize their
    application, particularly in anything other than row crops (e.g. in cereal production
    in the field). The timing of RDI and the degree of soil water deficit, and the
    timing and method of APRI are still needed to be investigated on cereals in different
    climates, cereal varieties and planting conditions. Even the control equipment
    in the field still needs to be optimized before it can be concluded whether it
    is practical in all conditions. Nevertheless, Dodd’s group have gone some way
    to providing an understanding of how different degrees of soil drying and timing
    of rewatering can impact the transport of growth regulators (Dodd, 2007). In a
    particularly interesting paper, Martin-Vertedor and Dodd (2011) related the number
    of cereal roots in drying soil to the intensity of an ABA signal and the degree
    of limitation of leaf growth. In a meta-analysis across a range of horticultural
    and agricultural crops, Dodd (2009) showed a positive impact of PRD on WUE compared
    with a control where the same amount of water was applied indiscriminately across
    the whole root system. This is strong evidence that long-distance chemical signalling
    in a range of crops can be exploited to enhance water productivity in agriculture.
    Deficit irrigation studies in China to improve WUE in agriculture Since drought
    tolerance varies considerably by genotype and by phenological stage, deficit irrigation
    requires precise knowledge of the crop response to drought stress for each of
    the growth stages (Kirda et al., 1999). Many regions of China are suffering from
    water scarcity, with overuse of water in agriculture causing serious environmental
    problems in some regions. The impacts of RDI have been researched on a range of
    field crops in China in the arid north and north-west China under the support
    of the National Natural Science Foundation and programs from the Ministry of Science
    and Technology and other ministries. The research showed that crops that are less
    sensitive to water deficits, such as fruit trees, cereals crops, and greenhouse
    crops, can adapt well to various deficit irrigation practices (see Tables 1–3).

    methods on cereal crops: maintaining yield with less water In general, cereal
    crops contribute significantly to food security. There is some potential to practice
    RDI on cereal crops in the arid north and north-west of China. Most experiments
    on field crops such as maize, wheat, and sorghum have shown that RDI can maintain
    a similar yield level under mild water stress during earlier stages, with WUE
    enhanced significantly (Fig. 3). Experimental research on maize showed that soil
    drying at the seedling stage plus further mild soil drying at the stem-elongation
    stage is the optimum deficit irrigation strategy for maize production in this
    semi-arid area (Kang et al., 2000a). The similar results on maize in Shanxi and
    Shaanxi, cotton in Xinjiang and Gansu, and wheat in Shaanxi and Gansu also suggested
    that RDI should be applied at the early growth stage (Kang and Cai, 2002). The
    degree of water deficit can reach 45–50% of field capacity, which has no serious
    effect on crop yield and can improve crop WUE by 20–29% on maize and 61–66% on
    wheat, respectively (Kang et al., 2000a). A study carried out on winter wheat
    in the North China Plain showed possible water savings of 25–75% by applying RDI
    at various growth stages, without significant loss of yield and profits (Zhang
    et al., 2005, 2013). It was also found that the maximum grain yield of winter
    wheat will be gained at 84% of maximum ET, and that a reduced irrigation frequency
    is better for both grain yield and WUE in drought years. Timing of the deficit
    and its severity should also be modulated according to the drought tolerance of
    different wheat varieties. For the variety that is sensitive to drought, water
    deficit at the seedling to stem-elongation stage is the best choice for improved
    WUE, and its increment also decreased with deficit stage postponed. However, for
    the variety with higher drought resistance, water deficit in the later stage is
    better for its WUE improvement. Moreover, for the variety with moderate drought
    resistance, stem elongation to booting is the better stage for water deficit to
    improve WUE (Du et al., 2010b). Fig. 3. Open in new tabDownload slide Relative
    yield and WUE of recommended deficit irrigation methods on field crops in China.
    The relative parameter is the ratio of yield and WUE under the recommended deficit
    irrigation method to that under the conventional method. AN asterisk indicated
    a significant difference for the data under the recommended deficit irrigation
    compared with the control. The fraction of the conventional method is given for
    each column. Shaded and unshaded columns indicate the relative parameters minimum
    and maximum data since the experiments were conducted for two or more years. Study
    numbers and details are listed in Table 1. Experiments with pot-grown maize showed
    that, compared with conventional watering, alternative irrigation on half the
    root zone reduced water consumption by 35% with a total biomass reduction of only
    6–11% (Liang et al., 1997; Kang et al., 1998). Experiment with hot peppers under
    drip irrigation also showed that APRI reduced water used for irrigation by about
    40% (Kang et al., 2001). Another experiment, where APRI was applied to a vertical
    soil profile (Kang et al., 2002b), showed that water consumption was reduced by
    20% (moderate soil drying) and 40% (severe soil drying) by extending the watering
    intervals. It was concluded that alternative watering in the vertical soil profile
    is an effective and water-saving method of irrigation and may have the potential
    to be used in the field. In the field, photosynthesis rate, transpiration rate,
    yield, WUE, soil water distribution, irrigation water advance, and uniformity
    were assessed over 4 years for maize irrigated with APRI in an arid area with
    a seasonal rainfall of 77.5–88.0mm, and conventional furrow irrigation was used
    as a comparison. The results showed that there was no significant difference in
    photosynthesis rate between different irrigation treatments when plants received
    the same amount of water. Luxury water consumption was reduced, without necessarily
    reducing the rate of photosynthesis substantially. The most surprising result
    in this experiment was that APRI maintained a high grain yield with up to a 50%
    reduction in the amount of irrigation. As a result, WUE for applied water was
    increased substantially (Kang et al., 2000a, b). In another trial of APRI, wheat
    under ridge planting and furrow irrigation was compared with conventional furrow
    irrigation. The yield of APRI plants increased by 15.5–18.5% compared with control
    treatment at the same irrigation water amount of 225–300mm, and one-third to one-half
    of the water was saved under the same yield level (Lian, 2006). Furthermore, APRI
    can also significantly reduce nitrate nitrogen accumulation in deeper soil layers
    (Xue et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2009). Earlier research also showed that APRI had
    the highest nitrogen fertilizer recovery with minimal mineral nitrogen residue
    left after maize harvest (Kirda et al., 2001, 2005). For other field crops such
    as potato, bean, and peanut, deficit irrigation strategies still have great potential
    on improving WUE with less water and similar yield levels (Fig. 3). Deficit irrigation
    methods on fruit trees: improving WUE and fruit quality Deficit irrigation was
    applied successfully to fruit trees to balance the vegetative and reproductive
    growth with acceptable yield and improved fruit quality. Fruit trees are well
    suited to RDI and APRI strategies because of their deep root systems, and water
    can be applied with precision to individual plants (Table 2 and Fig. 4). In some
    earlier cases, experiments on apple and peach trees showed that RDI saved 17–20%
    of water while shoot growth was reduced, but the tree yields showed no significant
    differences (Huang et al., 2001; Li et al., 2001). Experiments on pear also showed
    that controlled soil drying reduced shoot growth by 15–25%, and the fruit diameter
    and fresh weight were not affected by deficit applied during the fruit growth
    stage. There is no significant effect of RDI on fruit size, soluble solid content,
    and yield at harvesting stage (Cheng et al., 2003). Our study on pear-jujube trees
    also suggested that deficit irrigation can be applied for a fixed period with
    a controlled degree of soil drying to reduce irrigation water and restrict excessive
    vegetative vigour. This treatment maintained or slightly increased the fruit yield
    and thus WUE was significantly increased. During the bud burst to leafing stage,
    moderate soil water deficits did not have an effect on fruit quality but significantly
    saved irrigation water and increased fruit yield and thus enhanced WUE by 5–23%.
    Low water deficit during the fruit growth stage and low, moderate, and severe
    water deficits during the fruit maturation stage had no significant effect on
    the fruit weight and fruit volume but reduced fruit water content slightly, which
    led to a much reduced percentage of rotten fruit during the post-harvest storage
    period. Such an RDI strategy also shortened the fruit maturation period by 10–15
    d and raised the market price of the fruit (Cui et al., 2008, 2009). Fig. 4. Open

    method on fruit trees in China. See Fig. 3 for details. Study numbers and details
    are listed in Table 2. Yield, WUE, and the fruit quality response of table grape
    subjected to three drip irrigation treatments were examined in Wuwei, Gansu province,
    in northwest China. The three treatments were: (i) conventional drip irrigation,
    irrigated on both sides of the root system as the control; (ii) alternate drip
    irrigation, irrigated with 50% of the control, alternatively on the two sides
    of the root system during consecutive watering and (iii) fixed drip irrigation,
    irrigated with 50% of the control, only and always on one side of the root system.
    The results showed that improved WUE, earlier fruit maturity, and better quality
    of table grape could be achieved by alternate drip irrigation without detrimental
    effects on the fruit yield in arid areas (Du et al., 2008). Mineral potassium
    and iron elements in fruit and anthocyanins in the pericarp, which have better
    effects on the prevention of hypertension, were found to be much higher under
    APRI than under conventional drip and furrow irrigation (Zhou, 2000). The experimental
    research on wine grape conducted in Yinchuan, Ningxia province, showed that quality
    parameters of fructose and tannins were improved significantly (Fang et al., 2013).
    In a pear orchard in Yongnian county, Hebei province, 60% irrigation water was
    applied under APRI and fixed partial root-zone irrigation (FPRI) compared with
    conventional irrigation, and showed that yield and fruit weight were maintained
    at similar levels but WUE was improved by 62–63% under APRI (Zhao et al., 2007).
    However, in another research study on lychee using an APRI strategy in Haikou,
    Hainan province, the data showed that, in tropical areas, half of the irrigation
    water under APRI could maintain a similar yield and fruit quality (Zhou et al.,
    2008). Deficit irrigation methods on greenhouse crops: improving yield, WUE, and
    fruit quality Greenhouses may be used to overcome shortcomings in the growing
    qualities of a piece of land, such as a short growing season or poor light levels,
    and thereby improve food production in marginal environments. Much research has
    recently suggested that deficit irrigation on greenhouse crops can improve or
    maintain yield with a higher WUE and better fruit quality (Table 3 and Fig. 5).
    Tomato is one of more popular vegetables as well as an important source of antioxidants
    such as lycopene, phenolic, and vitamin C in the human diet (Toor et al., 2006).
    Our experiments in arid regions of north-west China from winter 2008 to spring
    2009 and from winter 2009 to spring 2010 showed that one-third and two-thirds
    of full irrigation at the seedling stage did not significantly influence greenhouse
    tomato fruit growth; in addition, total yield and fruit quality, water consumption,
    and total yield were decreased by the application of one-third of full irrigation
    at the flowering and fruit development stage and one-third or two-thirds of full
    irrigation at fruit maturation stage. However, the fruit contents of total soluble
    solids, reducing sugars, organic acids, and vitamin C, as well as fruit firmness,
    sugar/acid content ratio, colour index, and WUE, were significantly increased
    (Chen et al., 2013). Experimental research conducted in Yangling, Shaanxi, showed
    similar results in the greenhouse (Liu et al., 2013); however, earlier experiments
    of RDI and APRI on tomato in the same sites showed no significant difference on
    total soluble solids, vitamin content, and organic acids (Guo et al., 2007; Wu
    et al., 2009). An APRI experiment on eggplant in the greenhouse showed that 25.35%
    more yield and 25.39% more WUE were gained under APRI than under FPRI at the same
    irrigation level (Du et al., 2005). Furthermore, the RDI experiment of eggplant
    under drip irrigation showed that 80% water supply at seedling and mature stage
    could improve the yield and WUE, while 60% water supply at blooming stage improved
    the appearance quality of eggplant with significant reduction of yield and WUE
    (Wang et al., 2012). The experiments on cucumber also tested the same effect on
    yield, WUE and fruit quality (Chang and Zou, 2007; Cao et al., 2010). Fig. 5.

    method on greenhouse crops in China. See Fig. 3 for details. Studies number and
    details are listed in Table 3. Experiments with nectarine also showed that when
    compared with conventional irrigation, APRI and FPRI can inhibit growth of new
    shoots and advance the maturity of fruits, which means higher price and more benefit
    to the farmers. The average fruit single weight and firmness obtained with APRI
    and FPRI treatments are reduced, but the yield is not influenced, and total soluble
    solid content was increased. Compared to the conventional irrigation treatment,
    50% of water was saved in APRI and FPRI and therefore WUE was increased. Compared
    with FPRI, the average fruit weights, yield, total soluble solid content and WUE
    were all increased with APRI. Fruit firmness was not increased (Bi et al., 2005).
    Furthermore, alternate partial root-zone drip irrigation on cantaloupe in the
    greenhouse also suggested that yield was improved with significant enhancement
    of soluble solid content, vitamin C, and soluble protein (Zhao et al., 2013).
    APRI on strawberry in the greenhouse also showed that half the amount of water
    could maintain the yield at the same level (Wang et al., 2009). In the last 3
    years, a farmer field school was organized in the Shiyang River Basin, north-west
    China. This was intended to train farmers in water-saving agriculture. Local farmers
    were invited to the Shiyanghe experimental station, which belongs to China Agricultural
    University, to learn more about deficit irrigation and its impact on the environment.
    The use of the technique was extended to 4133 ha in this region during 1999–2002
    and has even extended to cereal crops in Inner Mongolia, Shaan Xi, Xiniang and
    Ningxia provinces in arid north-west China in recent years. The research interests
    of APRI strategy focus mainly on water–fertilizer coupling and the processes impacting
    fruit growth and quality (Zhou et al., 2007; Song et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2010a,
    b; Chai et al., 2011; Nong et al., 2012; Du et al., 2013; Li et al., 2013; Zhou
    et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014). The aim of the research is
    to assess how root hydraulic conductivity changes in different parts of the root
    zone, how the ability of roots to take up water and nutrition changes for different
    parts of the root system, how the major nutrients are distributed in the plants,
    and how the stomatal adjustment and changes in root uptake capacity can regulate
    and improve WUE and fruit quality under APRI. It is necessary to reveal the crop-to-crop
    response differences due to APRI to understand the variations of root and trunk
    sap flow, transpiration rate, ET rate, water cycle, and balance in the field under
    APRI. Based on the above understanding, deficit irrigation protocol was designed
    to increase fruit quality and WUE (see Fig. 6) for food security. Fig. 6. Open
    in new tabDownload slide Research frame of deficit irrigation for improving fruit
    quality and WUE. SPAC, soil–plant–atmosphere continuum. A sustainable strategy
    of agricultural water resources for food security in China Deficit irrigation
    requires more accurate and real-time allocation of agricultural water resources,
    especially in arid areas. Sustainable water management for food security needs
    to include: (i) the optimal allocation of water resources; (ii) high efficiency
    of agricultural water use; (iii) prevention and control of water pollution; and
    (iv) countermeasures to combat extreme climate disasters and other considerations.
    Improving agricultural WUE is a strategic requirement for food security. If China
    is to deliver the Government’s proposed increment of 50 billion kg of grain between
    now and 2020, over this period annual agricultural water use must be kept constant
    or even maintained at a reduced level. The WUE of farming in China is still far
    lower than that of developed countries, with an irrigation water effective use
    ratio of about 0.5 and an irrigation water productivity of 1.1kg m–3, Both of
    these figures are far lower than the values of 0.7–0.8 and 2.5–3.0kg m–3 achieved
    in advanced countries. Meanwhile, the agricultural irrigation in China is still
    relatively extensive and the water-saving irrigation area ratio is only 42% of
    the whole irrigation acreage in China. According to a survey conducted by the
    Ministry of Water Resources, if the irrigation water effective use ratio improved
    from 0.5 to 0.7, approximately 60–70 billion m3 of water would be saved; and even
    if the irrigation water productivity increased only from 1.1 to 1.5kg m–3, about
    100 billion m3 of water would be saved to produce the same cereal yield. In recent
    years, the Ministry of Water Resources of China put forward an agricultural water
    management strategy for ‘increasing grain yield and water-saving’ in north-east
    China, ‘limiting groundwater abstraction for saving’ in North China Plain, ‘water-saving
    with high efficiency’ in north-west China, and ‘water-saving with drainage reduction’
    in south China. Research and the extension of efficient irrigation technology
    have developed rapidly in China. On the North China Plain, winter wheat yield
    increased significantly when crops received 3600 m3 hm–2 from microspray irrigation
    technology, with a WUE of 1.7kg m–3, while WUE under traditional border irrigation
    is 1.5kg m–3 (Zhang et al., 2013). Maize production in north-east China has reached
    15000kg hm–2 under drip irrigation; the average yield increment is 6000–7500kg
    hm–2 compared with yields under conventional cultivation and surface irrigation.
    Fifty percent of the irrigation water is saved by using drip rather than sprinkler
    irrigation, and 86% is saved if drip irrigation is used rather than surface irrigation.
    There is a clear economic benefit of using drip irrigation in addition to the
    water-saving benefit. According to the survey data in north China, 8550 Renminbi
    (RMB) hm–2 of irrigation is required for the total cost of water supplies, irrigation
    equipment, plastic film, and conventional cultivation management for drip irrigation.
    If calculated on the basis of maize yield of 15 000kg hm–2 and a local price of
    1.2 RMB kg–1, the income will be 18 000 RMB hm–2, and the net income will be 9450
    RMB hm–2; compared with the average net income of conventional maize, the efficient
    water-saving technology provides 6000 RMB hm–2 in benefit to the local farmers.
    Optimizing water transport and distribution in the irrigation canal system is
    also necessary for achieving water-saving irrigation at the scale of an irrigation
    district or catchment. With the extension of high and new technology in agricultural
    water management, digital canal system management greatly promotes the practice
    of precision scheduling of water resources and precision irrigation. In order
    to meet the requirement of optimizing water distribution in canal systems, there
    is a need to apply computer and information technology to control water volume
    flow in real time. In order to optimize management of a canal system, automation
    of engineering control equipment, advanced systems software, and decision-making
    support are all needed in the large irrigation districts in north China. A sustainable
    strategy for management of agricultural water resources involving deficit irrigation
    based on physiological responses of crops needs to: (i) either reduce ET without
    yield reduction or improve yield with a similar ET; (ii) construct a compensatory
    mechanism for agricultural water-saving for farmers; (iii) improve water-saving
    efficiency by rural land circulation and scale operation;(iv) develop advanced
    practical water-saving technologies and economical, reliable, and durable equipment
    and facilities in the field; (v) construct and improve the system for water-saving
    technology extension and service; (vi) strengthen basic research on water-saving
    irrigation under changing environmental conditions; and (vii) establish national
    ET monitoring and an agricultural water-saving experimental research network.
    The application of deficit irrigation in a saline environment is another problem
    that should be addressed. Deficit irrigation under saline conditions is still
    a very difficult issue in terms of balancing soil salinity and water shortage.
    There are some references indicating that deficit irrigation is the greater risk
    of increased soil salinity due to reduced leaching (Schoups et al., 2005; Kaman
    et al., 2006; Raine et al., 2007; Geerts and Raes, 2009). Only when irrigation
    water volumes required for leaching are considered would it be a sustainable strategy,
    especially in arid areas. An experiment of RDI to reduce soil salinization in
    an apple orchard concluded that potential reductions in soil salinization because
    of the lower amounts of added salts were only experienced under natural salt leaching
    arising from high precipitations and that, otherwise, irrigation should be increased
    to control root-zone salt accumulation (Nasr and Ben Mechlia, 2002). Another experiment
    evaluating root-zone salinity distribution in an olive orchard showed that, since
    PRD supplied half of the irrigation water amount, it added fewer salts to the
    soil than the full irrigation treatment, and these salts were leached during the
    wet season keeping soil salinity to levels that were not harmful to the olive
    trees (Ghrab et al., 2013). Furthermore, an experiment conducted from 2008 to
    2012 in a peach orchard in the Middle Ebro Basin of Spain found that soil salinity
    and sodicity did not increase during the 5-year study period because of salt leaching
    by precipitation (Aragüés et al., 2014). More effort is still needed to coordinate
    soil salinity control and water productivity improvement. Other negative effects
    of long-term deficit irrigation on yield reduction, the regional water cycle,
    and its accompanying processes should also be considered. Conclusion remarks Because
    of the rapid depletion of water resources and the increasing impact of climate
    change, conventional irrigation practices can no longer be sustained in many areas
    in China. Methods that may cut down irrigation are of considerable interest and
    should be explored further. Deficit irrigation methods have been assessed systematically
    by the irrigation community in different parts of the world and are now used widely
    in crop and fruit production in many countries, Much of this work is still relatively
    empirical, but through these efforts we have gained a good appreciation of what
    are the most drought-sensitive developmental stages of many important food crops.
    Cowan (1988) and others have argued that plants have evolved mechanisms to maximize
    carbon gain and growth in environments where rainfall is unpredictable. This suggests
    that crop plants should be able to regulate their water use according to the water
    availability in the soil. Our understanding of the theoretical basis of active
    regulation of WUE has now increased to the point where physiological control mechanisms
    might be exploited to tune deficit irrigation methods for different crops and
    different environments. Such tuning might deliver increased WUE, yield, and crop
    quality. Further gains can be achieved if we also include in our manipulations
    accurate and real-time assessments of water availability that allow effective
    allocation of water resources. Abbreviations:  ABA abscisic acid  APRI alternate

    Get rights and content Highlights • Strawberries are recognized as a water intensive
    crop. • Crop water footprint accounting and RIS are proposed as a diagnostic tool
    of water use and management. • Values of crop water use were 55–60% higher than
    the water allowance proposed. • Strawberry water allocation must consider economical,
    social and environmental aspects. • It is necessary to improve the strawberry
    irrigation process (system and management). Abstract In recent years, irrigated
    agriculture has been in a critical situation due torising production costs, the
    stabilization or reduction of product prices, and growing pressure to minimize
    environmental impacts. These circumstances are forcing farmers to find new ways
    to use resources more efficiently in their production processes. The volume of
    water used during the crop growing season is linked to production; the final goal
    of all agricultural activity. Water footprint accounting is a suitable procedure
    to assess the relationship between water use and crop yield. However, it does
    not provide information about irrigation management. For this reason, information
    on water excess, deficit irrigation, or water needed for cropping practices must
    be incorporated into the crop water footprint analysis at farm scale. In this
    paper, a joint evaluation of crop water footprint accounting and irrigation management
    indicators is proposed as a diagnostic tool to identify the hotspots of irrigated
    agricultural systems. Based on this analysis, specific actions can be defined
    to improve water use efficiency, reduce water abstractions and polluted water
    returns, and maintain production rates. The methodology has been applied to intensive
    strawberry production in Southwest Spain, specifically in the vicinity of Doñana
    National Park; a highly sensitive environmental area located in the province of
    Huelva. Actions to ameliorate the current situation are proposed. Previous article

    an increasingly large and complex global challenge (Hunt, 2004). Freshwater scarcity
    has been recognized as one of the most crucial environmental concerns (UNESCO,
    2006). Nowadays, one-third of the world''s population lives in regions affected
    by water scarcity (UNESCO, 2009), a figure that is expected to reach over two-thirds
    by 2025. Freshwater availability is affected by several factors, such as world
    population growth, climate change, and industrial processes. Improving the management
    of this resource is therefore a major challenge that affects users, water authorities
    and business (WBCSD, 2006). Many companies are concerned about this situation
    and are undertaking initiatives to gain a better understanding of water-related
    risks along their value chains. Several tools have been recently developed to
    facilitate water use accounting, the impact of water consumption, or promote a
    deeper engagement in resource management (Alliance for Water Stewardship, 2012).
    A reference to most of these tools can be found on the website of the CEO Water
    Mandate (CEOWM, 2012). All these initiatives have strengths and weakness (UNEP,
    2011) and many are still under development (Bayart et al., 2010) or have been
    recently approved, such as the ISO international standard to assess water use
    (ISO, 2013). At the global scale, most water use occurs in agricultural production,
    which is strongly related with specific activities such as irrigation. Irrigated
    agriculture is recognized as a water intensive sector due to the high dependency
    of agriculture on water resource use and management. It is therefore essential
    that the farming sector take a responsible approach towards the sustainable use
    and conservation of freshwater. One of the most frequently used tools to implement
    such an approach is water footprint accounting; a concept that was first introduced
    by Hoekstra (2003), and more recently developed within the life cycle assessment
    framework (Mazzi et al., 2014, Berger and Finkbeiner, 2010, Bayart et al., 2010)
    and the ISO international standard (ISO, 2013). As an indicator, the water footprint
    measures the appropriation of water resources by human activity by evaluating
    water consumption and the impact on water quality. This process is also called
    “water footprint accounting” or “water footprinting” and forms part of a wider
    evaluation process known as “water footprint assessment” (Hoekstra et al., 2011).
    Water footprint accounting is the phase in which data are collected and accounts
    are developed. It is a suitable procedure to appraise the water use and crop yield
    relationship. As such, it is a measure of crop water efficiency and hence crop
    production efficiency. Many water footprint case studies have been carried out
    on water-intensive industrial processes and crops, such as cotton and the textile
    industry (Chico et al., 2013), grapes and the winemaking industry (Ene et al.,
    2013), tea and margarine production (Jefferies et al., 2012), the paper industry
    (Hubacek et al., 2009, vanOel and Hoekstra, 2012, Manzardo et al., 2014) or olive
    oil production (Salmoral et al., 2010). Many other studies have been performed
    on horticultural crops. Chapagain and Orr (2009) showed that tomatoes grown in
    Spain are placing an unsustainable strain on local water resources. Their study
    found that the annual abstraction rates in the province of Almeria in southern
    Spain, one of the main horticultural crop growing regions in the European Union,
    are approximately 4–5 times higher than the annual rainfall. Strawberries are
    an example of a water-intensive crop that is highly demanded in both the European
    fresh market and the food industry. The average water footprint of strawberries
    produced in Huelva ranges from 173 m3/t (Adams, 2009) to 140 m3/t (Aldaya et al.,
    2010). Adams estimates the strawberry water footprint in Poland at 592 m3/t (Adams,
    2009). The marked difference between the Spanish and Polish values is due to the
    intensive nature of agricultural methods in Spain, where strawberries are cropped
    in polytunnels and rainfall does not intervene in the water balance unlike the
    more traditional Polish techniques that depend mainly on green water and produce
    lower yields. However, studies carried out on water footprint accounting of crops
    grown at farm scale only provide information about the water used per unit of
    agricultural production but not about the irrigation process or whether the water
    is used efficiently. Therefore, the water footprint indicator should be accompanied
    by other indicators to evaluate if the irrigation water is being used in the best
    way possible. Relative irrigation supply (RIS) is a widely used indicator to assess
    irrigation management (Levine, 1982). RIS is the ratio of the total annual volume
    of water diverted or pumped for irrigation and the total theoretical irrigation
    needs of the crops calculated per irrigation season. This indicator is clearly
    defined by the International Programme for Technology and Research in Irrigation
    and Drainage (IPTRID), which developed a set of simple but effective and universally
    applicable performance indicators (Malano and Burton, 2001). These indicators
    have become a powerful tool for assessing irrigation processes in irrigation districts
    or on farms (Rodríguez Díaz et al., 2008, Rodríguez Díaz et al., 2011, Rodríguez
    Díaz et al., 2012), and has also proven to be useful as a reference for guiding
    sustainable development at the regional level (Geng et al., 2014). Efficient water
    use is particularly important in high environmentally sensitive areas where poor
    irrigation practices may have a large impact on water resource availability and
    pollution. 73% of total strawberry production in Huelva is located in the vicinity
    of Doñana National Park (Fundación Doñana 21, 2006). Several water regulations
    affect the park and its surrounding areas: the Guadalquivir and the Tinto, Odiel,
    Piedras hydrological basin plans (CHG, 2013, CHGuadiana, 2012). The strictest
    regulation is the “Special Management Plan of Northern Doñana Irrigated Areas”
    (Regional Government of Andalusia, 2011), which proposes a water allowance of
    4000 m3/ha. Although the strawberry sector claims that the proposed allowance
    is clearly insufficient, the water authorities argue that the maximum yield can
    be achieved with the current allowance. The water administration recognizes that
    specific studies under local conditions are required to improve farmers'' irrigation
    practices and to introduce new irrigation technologies that promote the efficient
    use of water by reducing the volume of freshwater withdrawal. Water footprint
    accounting does not include water use insofar as this water is returned to where
    it came from (Hoekstra, 2003). It should be noted that the water accounting method
    is aimed at freshwater consumptive uses, which assess the consequences of water
    that is “lost” in a particular region (Berger and Finkbeiner, 2010) assuming that
    additional water applied to the crop returns to the system. Nevertheless this
    assumption does not always occur as suggested by Perry (2011). There is a fraction
    of water that can be evaporated or transpired for other purposes than the intended
    uses (non-beneficial consumption), and water that is lost to further uses such
    as saline groundwater sinks or flows to the sea (non-recoverable fraction). Therefore
    it is important that water footprint accounting take into account all water withdrawals
    as an important fraction of applied water is not available for further uses in
    the basin. This particular aspect may be critical in a water scarce catchment
    with a high pressure on water resources and limited water allowances. The goal
    of this paper is to propose a joint evaluation of crop water footprint accounting
    and the RIS irrigation management performance indicator as a diagnostic tool to
    identify hotspots of the irrigation process in crop production. In the methodology
    section, the indicators have been adapted to an intensive, high-value horticultural
    crop that can be cropped outdoors or inside a greenhouse. In the results section,
    the proposed methodology is applied to a real case study of strawberry crop production
    in the surrounding areas of Doñana National Park. In the results and discussion
    sections, the results have been addressed attending to the main water regulations
    that affect the strawberry sector. The relationship between the proposed performance
    indicators, the interaction between the strawberry crop and water availability
    in the study area, and the main hotspots that have been found in the strawberry
    irrigation process have also been discussed. 2. Methodology 2.1. The performance
    indicators (PIs) proposal As a major water consuming sector, agriculture often
    has a significant water footprint. For agricultural products it is particularly
    important to examine the water footprint of the crop growing process (Hoekstra,
    2003). According to the virtual water concept introduced by Allan (1998), water
    is divided into three categories: green, blue and grey water. Green water consumption
    is defined as the evapotranspiration of rainwater during plant growth, which is
    especially relevant for agricultural products. Blue water consumption is the volume
    of ground and surface water that evaporates during the crop season. Thus, it comprises
    the amount of water that is not returned into the environmental compartment from
    which it was initially withdrawn, in other words, it is the water that is “lost”
    in a particular region (Berger and Finkbeiner, 2010). This concept is also known
    as freshwater consumptive uses. The grey water footprint is an indicator of pollution
    and is defined as the volume of freshwater that is required to assimilate the
    load of pollutants based on existing ambient water quality standards (Hoekstra,
    2003). Following the terminology of Hoekstra (2003), the water footprint of crop
    growth (WFc) is the sum of the green, blue and grey components, and is usually
    expressed in m3/t, which is equivalent to l/kg. (1) The green component in the
    process of water footprinting a crop (WFgreen, m3/t) is calculated as the green
    component in crop water use (CWUgreen, m3/ha) divided by the crop yield (Y, t/ha).
    The blue component (WFblue, m3/t) is calculated in the same way. (2) (3) The grey
    component of a primary crop (m3/t) is calculated as the chemical application rate
    per hectare (AR, kg/ha) times the leaching fraction (α) divided by the maximum
    acceptable concentration (cmax) minus the natural concentration for the pollutant
    considered (cnat). The pollutants mainly consist of fertilizers (nitrogen, phosphorus,
    etc.) and, to a lesser degree, chemicals such as herbicides or pesticides. (4)
    The main goal of irrigation scheduling should be to apply the right amount of
    water (crop water needs) and prevent losses due to percolation. According to the
    Spanish Water Law (2001) and the European Water Framework Directive (2000), polluted
    water should be treated before it returns to the environment in order to achieve
    environmental water quality standards. These treatments are not based on pollutant
    dilution as not all contaminants can be eliminated using this procedure, which
    also involves extra water withdrawal or additional pressure on the scarce resources
    of the region. For these reasons, the grey water component has not been included
    in this study. The green and blue components in crop water use (CWU, m3/ha) are
    calculated based on the accumulation of daily crop evapotranspiration (ETc, mm/day)
    over the complete growing period. The factor 10 is used to convert water depths
    in mm into water volumes per unit surface (m3/ha). (5) (6) The green crop water
    use represents the total rainwater evapotranspired from the planting day (day
    1) to the day of harvest (lgp, length of growing period). The blue crop water
    use represents the total irrigation water evapotranspired from the crop. It represents
    the water volume evapotranspired by the crop and therefore the net water losses
    in the area. The blue crop water use (CWUblue) estimated from equation number
    6 does not take into account indirect water uses and irrigation inefficiencies
    that do not always return to the environment. Many crops need significant volumes
    of water for different cropping practices such as soil preparation (WAs), irrigation
    during plantation to avoid plant dehydration (WAp), irrigation to remove salt
    from the soil (WAss), to reduce frost effects (WAf), and other agronomic practices.
    Furthermore, the volume of irrigation water applied during the growing period
    often does not match the theoretical irrigation needs. This can occur when the
    irrigation scheduling is not as accurate as it should be and there are over-irrigation
    or under-irrigation effects, or when there is a strategy such as deficit irrigation.
    Eq. (7) takes into account the total volume of water applied for crop growing
    (CWAblue, m3/ha). (7) WAg (m3/ha) is the actual irrigation water applied during
    the crop growing period and WAi is the amount of water used in the different agricultural
    practices (up to n) cited above (soil preparation, salt removal, etc). The CWAblue
    indicator counts all water withdrawals for the whole season. It represents the
    water volume used to achieve the recorded production. It is an indicator of the
    real water used by each producer and is more realistic for a study carried out
    at farm scale. Considering the CWAblue, WFblue is converted to WFAblue (m3/t).
    The WFAblue provides information about the irrigation water that is needed to
    produce one unit of agricultural production. This indicator links actual water
    withdrawn to yield. As mentioned above, a large amount of data is needed to estimate
    the green and blue crop water footprints. When the purpose of the assessment is
    to make a rough estimate, it is common to work with climate data from nearby locations,
    crop data obtained from standard statistics, and more readily available regional
    or national averages. However, when the study is carried out at farm scale, more
    detailed climate and crop data are needed for the calculations. The total volume
    of water applied during the whole cropping season, including indirect water uses,
    must be recorded. Information about the main crop features, such as planting and
    harvesting dates, plant density, varieties, soil characteristics, and others,
    is also required. The RIS (Levine, 1982) is an indicator that informs about how
    irrigation matches theoretical water requirements. (8) where WAg (m3/ha) is the
    actual irrigation water applied during the crop growing period, ETc (mm/year)
    is the crop evapotranspiration, and Pe (mm/year) is the effective rainfall. In
    theory, RIS values of less than 1 indicate deficit irrigation, while larger values
    indicate over-irrigation. In practice, values around 1.2 are desirable to avoid
    deficit irrigation owing to on-farm distribution uniformity and imprecise irrigation
    scheduling. 2.2. Estimation of crop evapotranspiration Crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc) is generally estimated in an indirect manner by means of a model that uses
    data on climate, soil properties, and crop characteristics as input. The CROPWAT
    model developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
    (FAO, 2010), which is based on the method described in Allen et al. (1998), is
    the most widely used and recommended by Hoekstra et al. (2009) in their water
    footprint manual. In Spain, the climate data needed to estimate ETc by the CROPWAT
    model are usually available from outdoor public weather stations. Nevertheless,
    most of the highest valuable crops are grown in part or entirely inside a greenhouse
    or polytunnel. In this study, the method described by Allen and integrated in
    CROPWAT has been adapted to the possibility that the crop remains under a plastic
    cover during part of the season. Given that ETc must be estimated considering
    that horticultural crops can be grown outdoors and sometimes inside a greenhouse,
    two different calculation procedures are required to estimate irrigation needs.
    These different cropping conditions are taken into account in Eq. (9), which is
    valid for the whole growing season for crops cultivated outdoors (from day 1 to
    n) and/or partially inside a greenhouse (from day n + 1 to k) on a daily basis
    calculation (adapted from Allen et al., 1998). (9) where i is the season day index,
    j is the crop stage index, Kc is the crop factor that varies with the crop stage,
    and ETo and ETop, are the potential evapotranspiration estimated outdoor and inside
    the greenhouse or polytunnels, respectively. The outdoor ETo was estimated using
    the Penman–Monteith equation with daily data collected at available weather stations
    (public or private). The theoretical water needs inside a greenhouse were estimated
    using a modified Hargreaves equation (Hargreaves and Samani, 1985) as suggested
    for greenhouses by Fernández et al. (2010) and Hernández et al. (2001): (10) where
    Ra is the extraterrestrial solar radiation (mm/day), Tmax, Tmin and T are the
    maximum, minimum and mean daily temperatures in °C, respectively, and the plastic
    cover transmissivity, τ, is the ratio between the inside and outside solar radiation.
    Daily solar radiation and temperature data inside and outside the greenhouse were
    collected from a weather station installed in the field for the purpose of this
    work. 2.3. Study area and general description of farms The province of Huelva
    is the largest producer of strawberries in Europe and the second in the world.
    95% of all Spanish strawberries are produced in the province of Huelva, particularly
    in the Doñana area, which accounts for 65% of national production. More than 90%
    of strawberry production is devoted to the international market. From an economic
    point of view, strawberry farming generates wealth in the area and is responsible
    for more than 700 working days per ha and year and the creation of more than 55,000
    jobs (Fundación Doñana 21, 2006). Doñana National Park and its surrounding areas
    (2900 km2) occupy the right bank of the Guadalquivir River at its estuary on the
    Atlantic Ocean. The Doñana National Park wetland, which is a valued wildlife refuge,
    is included on the UNESCO World Heritage list, and is also a Ramsar site, a Biosphere
    Reserve and a European Community Special Protection Area (Regional Government
    of Andalusia, 2009). Doñana has a Mediterranean climate with oceanic influences.
    The average annual rainfall is around 550 mm with important inter-annual variations
    ranging from 300 mm to 1000 mm (Muñoz-Reinoso, 2001). The main factors that determine
    the water availability for the ecosystem are the high mean temperature and rainfall
    variability, which fluctuates from a plentiful supply in winter to a persistent
    drought in summer (Aldaya et al., 2010). In the 2010/2011 season, the area had
    a total rainfall of 989 mm from September to June, while in the 2011/2012 season
    this figure was 323 mm, which are good examples of humid and dry seasons. The
    potential evapotranspiration was relatively constant in both seasons with 912
    and 989 mm, respectively. The methodology proposed has been applied to 22 commercial
    strawberry farms during the 2010/2011 and 2011/2012 seasons. These farms are representative
    of the diversity of farms in the area in terms of size, water sources, soils,
    crop management and varieties. The study area is 500 ha, which accounts for almost
    8% of the total strawberry area in the region (6400 ha). Their location is shown
    in Fig. 1. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Location map of the Doñana
    National Park and the study farms. 3. Results Crop water requirements are the
    volume of water demanded during the whole crop season to obtain the maximum yield
    when no restrictions for the remaining inputs are assumed. As strawberries in
    Huelva are initially cropped outdoors and later underneath plastic tunnels, two
    different calculation procedures for irrigation needs are required (Eq. (9)).
    Strawberry water requirements in nurseries (outside the basin) are not considered
    in this work. In both periods (outdoors and under polytunnels), strawberry beds
    are covered by black plastic to prevent the infiltration of rain water. Because
    rainfall (green water) does not intervene in the production process, crop growing
    depends exclusively on irrigation water (blue water). Using data recorded during
    both seasons, the selected indicators were calculated. A descriptive statistical
    analysis of the indicators is shown in Table 1. Table 1. Statistical analysis
    of strawberry crop performance indicators for the 2010/2011 and 2011/2012 seasons.

    crops require a significant volume of water for soil preparation (WAs) and plantation
    (WAp) (20%), in addition to the amount of water applied to match crop water requirements
    during the growing period (WAg) (80%). The volumes of blue water applied during
    the whole season (from August to June) on each farm were recorded for both seasons.
    The values for soil preparation and planting (WAs + WAp), and the growing period
    (WAg) are shown graphically in Fig. 2. Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    2. Crop water applied (WAi m3/ha) for soil preparation and planting (black) and
    during the crop growing period (WAg m3/ha) (grey) in both seasons and RIS. The
    most frequent irrigation system used in strawberry farming is drip irrigation
    by plastic tapes. Fertilizer is applied through the irrigation system by short
    pulses. Fertilizer application rates differ greatly between farmers depending
    on the varieties, plant density, water quality, crop management, and climate conditions,
    among other factors. Additionally, the leaching fraction depends mainly on the
    soil texture, which can vary greatly from one place to another, or even on the
    same farm. Furthermore, the main goal of each fertigation program should be to
    prevent losses by percolation. For this reason, the grey water component has not
    been estimated. The average CWAblue value was 7027 m3/ha in the 2010/2011 season
    and 7215 m3/ha in the following season. The standard deviation of the indicator
    was 2462 and 3009 m3/ha for both seasons, respectively. The high variability observed
    on the farms is mainly due to differences in soil preparation and planting stages.
    The most frequent value for the sample was 6200 m3/ha in 2010–2011 and 6500 m3/ha
    in 2011–2012, as may be expected in a drier year (both values are 10% and 14%
    lower than the average). Crop water use (CWU) is an evaluator of theoretical irrigation
    needs. Variations in the farms are mainly due to the different duration of the
    crop season (from mid-October up to June). In the 2010/2011 season, the standard
    deviation was 9%, with an average value of 4870 m3/ha. However, the most frequent
    value was 5218 m3/ha due to the longer duration of the harvest on many farms as
    a result of favorable climatic conditions. In the following season (2011/2012),
    the standard deviation increased to 17%, with an average value of 4605 m3/ha.
    The most frequent value (4512 m3/ha) was even smaller than in the previous year
    due to the drier climatic conditions and low prices that led most farmers to finish
    the crop season earlier to avoid the last month (June) when peak evapotranspiration
    rates occur. When crop water applied (CWAblue) is compared with irrigation needs
    (ETc), the most frequent RIS value is within the correct value (1.1). However,
    it is important to highlight that there is wide variability within farms, with
    several farms showing extreme values (over 2.5) and others below one. High values
    are particularly important for both the excessive water abstraction from the aquifer
    and for the pollution that could be produced by deep percolation of fertilizers.
    The average value of WFAblue was 90 m3/t for both seasons, while the WFC values
    as suggested by Hoekstra (2003) were 80 and 60 m3/t for both seasons. 4. Discussion
    4.1. Linking accounted water footprint and irrigation management indicators Fig.
    3 shows the relationship between the indicators. The solid lines connect the terms
    involved in the different indicators, while the dashed lines relate the pairs
    of indicators to be compared. A direct comparison of WFC and WFAblue is insufficient
    to identify the target value of the water footprint associated to any crop if
    the purpose is to identify the most efficient agricultural production systems.
    However, when this information is analyzed together with other irrigation indicators,
    it is possible to evaluate the yield in relation to the water used and the irrigation
    management. Thus, CWAblue provides information about how much water is used for
    irrigation (water allocation), while RIS shows if water is used efficiently in
    relation to the theoretical irrigation requirements. All these indicators together
    provide a wide scope for the analysis of irrigation management and valuable information
    about the agricultural outputs (yield) in relation to water use. Download : Download

    the relationship between PIs and yield, which ranges from 62 to 73 t/ha. Although
    a wide variability was found, farmers who apply more water do not generally obtain
    the highest yields. Thus, poor irrigation practices do not result in increased
    agricultural production or higher incomes for farmers. Download : Download full-size

    The most frequent WFAblue value was 90 m3/t, with mean values of 113 m3/t and
    101 m3/t in 2010/2011 and 2011/2012, respectively (Table 1). No significant variation
    was observed from one season to another. CWAblue was higher in 2011/2012 due to
    the climatic conditions, but with a higher yield that kept quasi-constant values
    of the water footprint. Aldaya et al. (2010) estimated the WFC of strawberry production
    in Doñana at 140 m3/t, while Adams (2009) reported 173 m3/t. However, they provided
    WF values considering water consumed (evapotranspired) as suggested by Hoekstra
    (2003) instead of applied water. In this work, the estimated mean values of WFC
    as suggested by Hoekstra were 80 m3/t and 60 m3/t for 2010/2011 and 2011/2012,
    respectively, which is significantly smaller than the values reported by Aldaya
    et al. (2010) and Adams (2009). This difference may be due to the fact that real
    climate and crop data collected at farm level were used instead of public or standard
    statistics. These differences confirm the findings of Montesinos et al. (2011),
    who showed that a finer spatial resolution is needed to apply the virtual water
    concept with a view to improving local water resources management at the regional
    or basin scale. The strawberries cultivated in Doñana are more water efficient
    than other European strawberries (e.g., the water footprint of Polish strawberries
    is 592 m3/t) due to the higher yields (60–75 t/ha) that were obtained with CWAblue
    ranging from 6100 to 6600 m3/ha. Nevertheless, strawberry crops are grown entirely
    with blue groundwater in an area where there is high competition between different
    water users. 4.2. Interactions between strawberry crops and water availability
    As PIs were obtained for wet (2010/2011) and dry (2011/2012) seasons, their average
    values can be used to analyze the interaction between strawberry crops and available
    water in the northern Doñana area for an average year. A summary balance of water
    resource availability in the area is shown in Table 2 (Regional Government of
    Andalusia, 2011). The Doñana aquifer is the main source of water (65%) used to
    meet the water needs of all irrigated crops, with around 3800 ha devoted to strawberry
    cultivation over a total irrigated area of 8950 ha. Assuming an intermediate value
    of CWAblue (6350 m3/ha) as a water use benchmark, the withdrawals to satisfy strawberry
    crop water needs would amount to 24 Mm3, thus accounting for 66% of the total
    water available in the area. However, the volume of water used by the strawberry
    plant per unit area (average CWU value for the warmest season studied) was 4870
    m3/ha, thus accounting for 18.5 Mm3 of water consumption and 51% of the total
    water available in the area. The difference between these figures, 5.5 Mm3, is
    the volume of water returns to the aquifer by deep percolation, flows to the sea,
    and evaporation to the atmosphere. Thus, 5.5 Mm3 is the savings potential if water
    conservation measures are adopted. This figure again shows the large difference
    between the calculation of the WF procedure as suggested by Hoekstra and the methodology
    proposed in this study using real water use data obtained on farm to extract additional
    information from water users. Table 2. Irrigation water balance in the northern

    An analysis of the previous results shows that most farmers use reasonable amounts
    of water. Thus, the question arises: what could be a reasonable irrigation water
    allocation? Different approaches can be taken to answer this question. The water
    authorities'' position is based on flat crop water allocation that does not take
    into account the economic impact of the different crops in the area, as shown
    in Table 2. However, the irrigation water productivity of strawberries in the
    target area is very large compared to other crops. More specifically, the estimated
    apparent water productivity in the eastern area of Doñana is 11.43 €/m3 for strawberries,
    while it is 1.04 €/m3 for citruses and 2.03 €/m3 for fruit trees (Salmoral et
    al., 2011). Two of the three key pillars of sustainability are society and the
    economy. Thus, the socio-economic impact of any crop should be an important weighting
    factor in water allocation. Farmers, who represent the opposite approach, call
    for higher water allowances. It is fairly clear that net water allowances of 4000
    m3/ha or even 4500 m3/ha for the whole season cannot satisfy the crop demand to
    reach productions of around 65 t/ha. If water allowances are not revised, the
    alternatives for farmers will be to reduce the cropped area in order to maintain
    the same level of production per unit area or accept less production per unit
    area while keeping the current cropped area. Consequently, both alternatives will
    reduce incomes in the area. However, farmers should improve their management skills
    and upgrade their irrigation systems. 4.3. Finding the main hotspots in the strawberry
    irrigation process Precision irrigation should be an important target for such
    an intensive crop as strawberries. Precision irrigation would reduce water abstractions
    from the aquifer, as well as energy and fertilizer consumption, while causing
    less aquifer pollution and producing higher profits for farmers. If this goal
    is achieved, it will help to maintain strawberry prices at a reasonable level
    and ensure consumer satisfaction with sustainable food production. Both parties
    (water authorities and farmers) must seek a consensus on strawberry water allocation
    to prevent illegal water abstractions. The authorities should establish a uniform
    allocation criteria for the whole Doñana area in order to ensure that water is
    allocated in a transparent and rational manner according to water needs during
    the three stages of the crop and water productivity. Additionally, the water authorities
    should effectively control the maximum area devoted to each crop, while farmers
    should minimize the environmental impact of their activity. For this reason, precision
    irrigation should be promoted in the area. Precision irrigation is based on the
    optimal management of irrigation systems through the use of adequate emitters
    for each crop, in this case for strawberry cultivation. Farmers that achieve a
    better performance apply water in short pulses during the day due to the low water
    retention capacity of the extremely sandy soils typical of this area. Although
    the main irrigation system currently used in the area is non-pressurized plastic
    tape, it is not the most suitable emitter to apply water in short pulses. While
    plastic tapes are fairly cheap, they have important drawbacks related to the control
    of hydraulic variables (i.e., sensitivity to pressure changes, emitter clogging,
    etc.) that cause water to be applied in a non-uniform manner throughout the irrigation
    sector. At present, the cropping costs resulting from the irrigation system and
    the volume of water applied during the season amounts to 4%–5% of total costs
    (Adesva, 2010). It is therefore essential that the strawberry sector consider
    expenditure on irrigation systems as an investment rather than a cost. Precision
    irrigation also requires increased control of water applications. To do so, independent
    water meters for strawberry crops should be installed even at the irrigation sector
    level. The presence of excess and deficit irrigated areas may lead to production
    losses (in terms of both quantity and quality). For these reasons, it is necessary
    to improve the strawberry irrigation process (system and management) in order
    to provide each plant the exact amount of water at the proper time, minimize water
    abstractions, and prevent losses by percolation and hence groundwater pollution.
    5. Conclusions Crop water footprint accounting has important limitations. Although
    it informs about the water needed to obtain one unit of agricultural production,
    it does not provide information about irrigation management and local practices.
    The water footprint indicator must therefore be used together with irrigation
    management indicators as a diagnostic tool to determine the efficiency of an irrigated
    agricultural system. With this aim, we developed a methodology based on two water
    footprint indicators (WFAblue and WFC) and three other irrigation management indicators
    (RIS, CWAblue and CWU). The methodology was then applied to a case study. In the
    particular case of strawberries in the Doñana area, the PIs show that irrigation
    water is used efficiently, although a large variability was observed between farms.
    In general, the RIS indicator ranges between appropriate values in most cases
    (except three outliers), thus indicating that farmers use irrigation water in
    a reasonable manner during the crop growing period. This is important as it is
    difficult to manage irrigation water efficiently in extremely sandy soils with
    a very low water retention capacity. The most frequent CWAblue value on the sample
    farms was 6200 m3/ha and 6500 m3/ha for the 2010/2011 and 2011/2012 seasons, respectively.
    This value is 55%–60% higher than the water allowance proposed under regional
    water regulations (4000 m3/ha), which seems to be considerably lower than the
    theoretical irrigation requirements. However, these figures are linked to very
    low WFAblue values of 90 m3/t, thus indicating the high water efficiency of strawberry
    production in this area with an estimated water productivity of 11.43 €/m3. The
    socio-economic impact of crops should be an important factor to consider in future
    water allocation criteria. In this environmentally sensitive area, water authorities,
    irrigators and environmental groups should seek a consensus regarding the criterion
    for strawberry water allocation. This new criterion should take into account economic,
    social and environmental aspects in order to reduce illegal water abstractions
    and permit farmers to increase water use efficiency by minimizing the total water
    withdrawal of their activity. The irrigation system inefficiencies identified
    by RIS as being over 1.2 should be reduced. For this reason, one of the first
    objectives should be to implement precision irrigation based on the optimal management
    of irrigation systems by means of adequate emitters for strawberry crops (and
    other crops as well). It is essential to improve the strawberry irrigation process
    (system and management) in order to provide each plant the exact amount of water
    at the correct time and minimize water abstractions, percolation and groundwater
    pollution. Acknowledgments The authors acknowledge Landgard Obst & Gemüse GmbH,

    2% of terrestrial plant species, halophytes are present in about half the higher
    plant families and represent a wide diversity of plant forms. Despite their polyphyletic
    origins, halophytes appear to have evolved the same basic method of osmotic adjustment:
    accumulation of inorganic salts, mainly NaCl, in the vacuole and accumulation
    of organic solutes in the cytoplasm. Differences between halophyte and gly-cophyte
    ion transport systems are becoming apparent. The pathways by which Na+ and Cl−
    enters halophyte cells are not well understood but may involve ion channels and
    pinocytosis, in addition to Na+ and Cl− transporters. Na+ uptake into vacuoles
    requires Na+/H+ antiporters in the tonoplast and H+ ATPases and perhaps PPi ases
    to provide the proton motive force. Tonoplast antiporters are constitutive in
    halophytes, whereas they must be activated by NaCl in salt-tolerant glycophytes,
    and they may be absent from salt-sensitive glycophytes. Halophyte vacuoles may
    have a modified lipid composition to prevent leakage of Na+ back to the cytoplasm.
    Becuase of their diversity, halophytes have been regarded as a rich source of
    potential new crops. Halophytes have been tested as vegetable, forage, and oilseed
    crops in agronomic field trials. The most productive species yield 10 to 20 ton/ha
    of biomass on seawater irrigation, equivalent to conventional crops. The oilseed
    halophyte, Sali-cornia bigelovii, yields 2 t/ha of seed containing 28% oil and
    31% protein, similar to soybean yield and seed quality. Halophytes grown on seawater
    require a leaching fraction to control soil salts, but at lower salinities they
    outperform conventional crops in yield and water use efficiency. Halophyte forage
    and seed products can replace conventional ingredients in animal feeding systems,
    with some restrictions on their use due to high salt content and antinutritional
    compounds present in some species. Halophytes have applications in recycling saline
    agricultural wastewater and reclaiming salt-affected soil in arid-zone irrigation
    districts. Keywords: salt stresssaline water irrigationseawater cropsosmotic adjustmentsodium

    \ Kumar Banyal2 and Neeraj Arora3\nIntroduction\nVarious authors define big data\
    \ in multiple ways, but there is no adequate definition. \nHowever, big data is\
    \ expressed in terms of V’s (volume, velocity, and variety); but it \nincludes\
    \ many v’s such as veracities, vagueness variability, vulnerability, volatility\
    \ visu-\nalization, etc. Big data application areas include business organization,\
    \ operation, pro-\nduction, marketing, information technology management, etc.\
    \ All these sectors need \nextensive data management and processing at various\
    \ levels required to be classified and \nfiltered for every individual in the\
    \ industry for effective utilization. Different algorithms \nused for multiple\
    \ applications affect the future of data science. Big data management \nis described\
    \ through the life cycle of study, data collection, documentation, integration,\
    \ \npreparation, data analysis, publishing and sharing, data storage, and data\
    \ reuse.\nAn industry including media, entertainment & communication uses big\
    \ data for busi-\nness benefits. Industries use and analyze customers’ behavioral\
    \ data to target audiences \nJournal of Big Data\nAbstract\nNowadays, big data\
    \ is an emerging area of computer science. Data are generated \nthrough different\
    \ sources such as social media, e-commerce, blogs, banking, \nhealthcare, transactions,\
    \ apps, websites, opinion platforms, etc. It is processed for \neffective utilization\
    \ in different industries, including healthcare. These enormous \ngenerated data\
    \ are essential for data analysis and processing for industrial needs. This \n\
    paper reviews the work of various authors who have contributed to data collection,\
    \ \nanalyzing, processing, and viewing to explore the importance and possibilities\
    \ of \nbig data in industrial processing applications and healthcare sectors.\
    \ It identifies \ndifferent opportunities and challenges (data cleaning, missing\
    \ values, and outlier \nanalysis) along with applications and features of big\
    \ data. This systematic review \nfurther proposed dirty data detection and cleaning\
    \ and outlier detection models that \ncan be used for many applications. The data\
    \ cleaning and outlier detection models \nuse the optimizations concept to solve\
    \ the optimal centroid selection problem and \nsuspected data.\nKeywords Big data,\
    \ Data cleaning, Outliers, Industrial processing, Healthcare\nPage 2 of 35\nRahul\
    \ et al. Journal of Big Data          (2023) 10:133 \nand recommend products and\
    \ services. Big data analytics is used to solve complex \nproblems [1]. Healthcare\
    \ big data presentations from 2015 to 2019 include different \ntechniques such\
    \ as statistical data analytical techniques, hidden Markova model, and \nmachine\
    \ learning techniques for bioinformatics given in [2]. Nowadays, healthcare data\
    \ \nbreaches appear through different medical field devices, becoming one of the\
    \ industrial \ndomain victims [3]. Healthcare information systems used effectively\
    \ by various hospitals \nsimultaneously need to implement meaningful information\
    \ efficiently, and filtered data \nhelps provide better medical services [4].\n\
    Big data improves industrial profit margin, production, and operations [5]. Big\
    \ data \nplays a vital role in many applications and engineering domains, artificial\
    \ intelligence-\nbased, data analytics-based, etc. Grand View Research, Inc.,\
    \ U.S.A, Big Data will reach \nUSD 72.38 billion by 2022 [6]. Healthcare big data\
    \ management is essential for evaluat-\ning diagnosis through large datasets;\
    \ thus, big data has a high role in the medical infor-\nmation system [2]. Some\
    \ factors affect verintegrityuch as data provenance, uncertainty, \nand dirty\
    \ and noisy data [7]. These algorithms are machine learning, deep learning, and\
    \ \nnatural language generations (NLG), directly or indirectly affecting applications\
    \ such as \nhealthcare, smart city, industry 4.0, etc. Deep learning is used for\
    \ pattern designing to \nimprove optimization and computations [8]. Data science\
    \ benefits job hunting, product \ncustomization, cost optimization, etc.\nThe\
    \ big data evaluation hierarchy moves like in the 1970s, statistical computing,\
    \ 1980’s \nmassive data sets, 1990’s data mining with statistical learning, 2000’s\
    \ business analytics, \nand 2010’s big data analytics explored in [9]. However,\
    \ firms are ready to implement big \ndata analytics technologies that have been\
    \ discussed, along with some challenges and \npreparedness in [10]. The system\
    \ health monitoring and management (SHMM) concept \nis introduced, which contains\
    \ active and passive data for forecasting, prediction, diagno-\nsis, etc., in\
    \ the healthcare system [9]. IoT and Cloud computing for healthcare are dis-\n\
    cussed in [11]. Similarly, big data applications have various benefits in the\
    \ healthcare \nsector. Big Data technologies are supporting healthcare sectors\
    \ and services in different \nways. It covers advanced patient care, improved\
    \ operational efficiency, disease detection, \ncost reduction, precise treatment,\
    \ improved medical diagnosis, etc. Data quality, opera-\ntions, and productivities\
    \ are essential in the healthcare system.\nHealthcare and other industries use\
    \ multimedia techniques to enhance efficiency, \ncoordination, and centric system\
    \ to support end-users [12]. Healthcare analytics’ objec-\ntive includes patient\
    \ safety, real-time monitoring, clinical decision support system, \nenhanced services,\
    \ etc. [13]. Big data and its technological implementation in the indus-\ntrial\
    \ sector are essential. It can be understood through the value chain: data acquisition,\
    \ \nanalysis, curation, storage, and usage [14]. Data is used for various industrial\
    \ operations \nobtained from different sources such as the internet, industrial\
    \ incorporation, enterprise \nresource planning (ERP), customer relationship management\
    \ (CRM), human resource \nmanagement (HRM) software modules, the social media\
    \ network, transactions, health-\ncare, geographical data, remote sensing, audio-video\
    \ recording, etc. The remote sens-\ning (RS) big data definition and satellite\
    \ with volume and velocity are given in [15]. Big \ndata management is required\
    \ for scalable data management to support large applications \n[16]. Big data\
    \ provides many emerging scientific research and value approaches to evalu-\n\
    ate economic growth [17]. In e-commerce, most information and data are electronically\
    \ \ncollected, which may have different types of data evaluation and quality problems\
    \ [18]. \nPage 3 of 35\nRahul et al. Journal of Big Data          (2023) 10:133\
    \ \nBig data is suitable for integrating other healing sources to form the life\
    \ cycle of acces-\nsible health data [19]. The big data life cycle is executed\
    \ as data generation, acquisition, \nstorage, analytics, and visualization [20,\
    \ 21]. The data acquisition system architecture \nfor the agriculture domain is\
    \ explained in [22]. In big data, data sources affect accuracy, \ninconsistencies,\
    \ missing value, data cleaning approach, duplicity among datasets, and \nusability\
    \ in many applications, including business analytics and the healthcare sector.\
    \ \nIndustrial processing identifies data analytics, business operation tools,\
    \ report genera-\ntions, etc., depending on big data’s structure or unstructured\
    \ form.\nBig data for manufacturing industries can enhance the manufacturing process,\
    \ cus-\ntomize the product development process, improve quality assurance, improve\
    \ sup-\nply chain risk, etc. The authors have explained manufacturing processes’\
    \ data analysis, \nwhich helps in-process monitoring and fault detection [23].\
    \ Users get data through the \nassistance system (process monitoring, anomaly\
    \ detection, fault analysis) [23]. The dif-\nferent applications include chemical\
    \ industries, complex processes, process control of \nharvesters, etc. [23].Big\
    \ data can improve the performance of aging manufacturing by \ndealing with fault\
    \ detections [24]. It is carried out in two phases, fault identification, and\
    \ \ndetection [24]. Big data exists in multiple industrial domain areas, such\
    \ as production, \nquality evaluation, supply chain, etc., affecting operating\
    \ costs within an organization \n[25].\nThe authors have used remote agents, intelligent\
    \ mapping, and cleaning processes \nfor automatic data-driven industrial data\
    \ analysis for different operations comprising \ndistributed intelligence, performance,\
    \ predictive, and preventive procedures [25]. IoT-\nenabled industries are data-generating\
    \ sources to solve featured engineering problems \nthrough deep learning mechanisms\
    \ [26]. IoT technologies are used in different sectors. \nAgricultural IoT identifies\
    \ data interoperability with the actual and predicted data that \nimprove crop\
    \ management’s decision support system [22]. IoT agricultural processing \nsystem\
    \ collects and transfers data through a server to an artificial neural network\
    \ (ANN) \nfor prediction in the agricultural domain. Big data applications exist\
    \ in agricultural sec-\ntors where data acquisition is carried out through IoT-based\
    \ technologies [22].\nThis paper focuses on the problems encountered while accessing\
    \ big data \nresources. However, big data have many applications in healthcare,\
    \ transportation, edu-\ncation, smart city, etc. Industries need actual data for\
    \ their processing task, operations, \nand productions. When big data is used\
    \ in various sectors, all sectors encounter a com-\nmon problem, i.e., “Data Filtering.“\
    \ Moreover, factual information and knowledge for \nindustrial operations cannot\
    \ be easily achieved due to the large data set, and neither can \nit be merely\
    \ implicit nor automatically extracted [27]. Differences between data produc-\n\
    tion and data extraction are defined in [28]. Data production (a medical record),\
    \ data \nreuse (coding of medical data), and data analytics are defined as an\
    \ order in big data \nimportance for healthcare industries [29]. Healthcare information\
    \ system (HIS) pro-\nvides information to the end-user through the execution of\
    \ cloud computing, Electronic \nhealth record (EHR), security layer, big data\
    \ analysis, and information, as mentioned in \n[30]. Thus, big data analytics\
    \ is required to process in such a way to benefit industries for \nthe following\
    \ reasons: understanding the market, less time, product development, online \n\
    feedback, decision-making process, etc.\nThe summary of the paper is described\
    \ in different sections.\nPage 4 of 35\nRahul et al. Journal of Big Data     \
    \     (2023) 10:133 \n  •\nSection 2 explained big data: preliminary,\n  •\nSection 3\
    \ focused on a review of big data analysis,\n  •\nSection 4 identified different\
    \ big data applications,\n  •\nSection 5 explains big data in business organizations,\n\
    \  •\nSection 6 elaborated on the challenges and opportunities in big data and.\n\
    \  •\nSection 7 explores future research outlines and.\n  •\nSection 8 conclusions.\n\
    The outcome of this systematic review work is explained in the following forms:\n\
    \  •\nDesign an optimization-based data cleaning model for dirty data detection\
    \ and \nremoval: The data cleaning model will detect and remove it from the system.\
    \ \nThis review paper identifies data cleaning as one of the major challenges\
    \ in large \napplication systems through studies based on [7, 19, 23, 27, 31–35].\
    \ Dirty data \ndetection and removal can be performed through the optimization\
    \ concept or \nnature-inspired algorithm (NIA). The detecting and corr Detecting\
    \ and correcting \ninclude applications’ inaccurate, corrupt, and irrelevant ratification\
    \ and removal: The \nsecond most promising challenge found in terms of identifying\
    \ missing value from \nwork based on [7, 24, 27, 36, 37]. Data analysis encompasses\
    \ preprocessing of data, \nfeature extraction, reduction of features, clustering,\
    \ filtering, and classifications.\n  •\nDesign an outlier removal model: outliers\
    \ differ from the existing standard data, \ndeviating from the available dataset.\
    \ However, several definitions of outliers exist, but \nno adequate explanation\
    \ for removing the outliers in an extensive database system \nthrough clustering\
    \ (An unsupervised model) could be the best outcome of this \nreview. Outliers\
    \ are an observation that appears different from a cluster’s standard \ndata. It\
    \ affects the results and calculations.\nBig data: preliminary\nBig data is a\
    \ collection and combination of very large data in different formats that are\
    \ \ndifficult to store, understand, and process for an application. Big data falls\
    \ under the cat-\negories of data analysis and streaming. Big data defines with\
    \ the help of V’s, such as vol-\nume, variety, velocity, variety, veracity, vagueness,\
    \ vocabulary, variability, venue, value, \netc.\nVolume\nBig data generated through\
    \ various sources, including healthcare, transportation, power \ngrid, intelligent\
    \ education energy, etc., must be classified as structured, semi-struc-\ntured,\
    \ and unstructured [38]. It represents the scale of data that originated from\
    \ vari-\nous sources. The data’s size, amount, and volume are heterogeneous, and\
    \ data volume is \nincreasing exponentially. There is a 40% growth in total data\
    \ generated every year ver-\nsus a 5% only growth in IT expenditure. Around 90%\
    \ of the world’s digitized data was \ncaptured in the last few years, and it keeps\
    \ going on [38]. Some challenges include the \ncurse of modularity and dimensionality\
    \ with a large volume of data in industrial applica-\ntions where machine learning\
    \ (ML) techniques are used to optimize and predict the out-\ncome [7]. Healthcare\
    \ data increase dramatically as per [39]. Machine learning is used to \nPage 5\
    \ of 35\nRahul et al. Journal of Big Data          (2023) 10:133 \nevaluate data\
    \ modeling for large-scale data generation access points of an application to\
    \ \nminimize computational cost and less memory and make a valuable model for\
    \ predict-\ning accuracy [40]. The authors have explained big data for healthcare\
    \ in parallel comput-\ning for volume, learning incrementally for velocity, and\
    \ information fusion for a variety \n[41]. Its emphasizes various applications’\
    \ input, analysis, and output [41].\nVariety\nIt represents the different data\
    \ types generated from various sources such as relational \ndatabase systems,\
    \ web text data, structured and semi-structured data, unstructured \ndata, online\
    \ data, social media data, healthcare sectors, etc. Processing and filtering data\
    \ \nwhen required during processing in any application is complex. Data features,\
    \ such as \ncompleteness and timeliness, are essential during accessibility in\
    \ any system or applica-\ntion. For instance, knowing the weather condition of\
    \ a particular city, the complete data \nset required, and timeliness reflects\
    \ data availability for a specific duration. Variety is an \nattribute of big\
    \ data associated with some challenges for industrial applications. Indus-\ntrial\
    \ applications are enabled with machine learning (ML) as a tool enclosed with\
    \ some \nchallenges: data locality, data heterogeneity (statistical, syntactic,\
    \ or semantic), and dirty \nand noisy data. These data include different errors,\
    \ different outliers, and missing values \nas well. However, data cleaning and\
    \ outliers removal are critical challenges under big \ndata analysis [7]. Various\
    \ data also includes textual, images, audio, video, XML, JSON, \nand sensors data.\n\
    Velocity\nIt represents the speed at which data is generated, processed, analyzed,\
    \ and stored at a \ndistinct location in a big data system. Data are generated\
    \ fast and need to be processed \nquickly as well. In an e-commerce business,\
    \ promotions should be offered immediately \nto attract customers based on users’\
    \ transaction details. Velocity also represents the rate \nat which it is generated\
    \ and analyzed. Some essential factors affect industrial process-\ning tasks through\
    \ machine learning, including data availability, real-time processing \nor streaming,\
    \ and random variable generation [7]. It is also defined as an “increasing \n\
    data rate” within an organization. The velocity of data is essential for batch\
    \ processing \nwithin industrial processing and other applications. Data streaming\
    \ helps in machine \nlearning-based processing in telecommunications and information\
    \ technology-based \nindustries. Many industrial applications require real-time\
    \ data and processing task/unit \nupdate machine learning-based software that\
    \ receives data stream as in moreover, many \nV’s, such as visualization, veracity,\
    \ value, virality, viscosity, and so on, concern thcon-\ncernsvalues contribution\
    \ to big data analytics being changed from descriptive analysis \nto predictive\
    \ analysis. Various data analytics categories define through text, visual, voice,\
    \ \nnetwork, and geospatial [1]. Textual case studies include social media, academic\
    \ papers, \nwebsite reviews, company documents, etc., whereas visual analytics\
    \ includes surveil-\nlance systems, CCTV, drone trajectory heterogeneous cameras,\
    \ etc. [1]. Big data pro-\nvides designing analysis and execution management,\
    \ one of the services under SaaS on \nthe cloud [42]. The importance of many v’s\
    \ can be understood as:\nPage 6 of 35\nRahul et al. Journal of Big Data      \
    \    (2023) 10:133 \nMore v’s\nTable 1 gives an approach of different V’s and\
    \ its existing format. Value is the essen-\ntial characteristic of big data, which\
    \ provides meaningful and heterogeneous advantages \nto industries. Any amount\
    \ is highly dependent on the execution of processes and data \naccess. For example,\
    \ a weather forecast requires any random data that would be enough \nto predict\
    \ a forecast for a particular region. In contrast, continuous data is required\
    \ for \ndisease treatment, such as temperature measurement, etc. Similarly, customers’\
    \ data are \nessential in banking services before proceeding with a loan [43].\
    \ Veracity refers to the \nquality of data used in the applications and systems.\
    \ Since data used under any applica-\ntions and system must be checked and analyzed.\
    \ Veracity in big data (context, cross-\nvalidations) discussed in [44]. The authors\
    \ stated data science and big data are equally \nimportant for healthcare [44].\
    \ Veracity tends to data processing strategies. Veracity \nreflects the trustworthiness\
    \ of data, estimated in terms of accuracy.\nSince noise is considered data, but\
    \ no information can be extracted from it. Viscosity \nis another V that measures\
    \ resistance to the volume of data; it improves the data stream-\ning. Similarly,\
    \ variability is defined as data differentiation in nature where different data\
    \ \nsources exist, differentiated between important and noisy and faulty data.\
    \ Visualization \nis an approach by which data relationships are shown in some\
    \ form. Data visualization \nis a mechanism that suits presenting a few data sets\
    \ (in the form of tabular, graphical, \nand circular) to deliver required and\
    \ meaningful results with the support of tools and \ntechniques.\nVisualization\
    \ supports through different stages (data identifications, acquisition, analy-\n\
    sis, validation, and visualization). Data acquisition sources take place from\
    \ multiple sen-\nsors [45]. Data visualization can be more effective in different\
    \ ways. For instance, data is \ncompelling and more credible, correct information\
    \ is not overcomplicated, has graphical \nrepresentations and style, is colorable\
    \ e, has a visual hierarchy, and focuses on the point \nduring presentations.\
    \ Data visualization makes data more valuable. Virality defines the \nspeed which\
    \ iinteractionactionss among the network. It amounts to the dataset’s many \n\
    availabilities for data processing before its implementation in the applications.\
    \ It also \ndefines applying data sources from among different applications. The\
    \ authors describe \nthe importance and significance of data generations and utilizations\
    \ of data in other \ndimensions, including service sectors, as mentioned in [46].\
    \ It also reflects how big data \nis suitable for the applications like banking\
    \ and securities, communications, media and \nservices, education, government,\
    \ healthcare providers, insurance, manufacturing, natu-\nral resources, retail,\
    \ transpordutiesn, ties wholesale trades, etc. [46]. Besides definitions \nof\
    \ big data, many technologies, like machine learning algorithms, are useful for\
    \ data \nanalysis. It can be used to find a feasible solution for optimized and\
    \ complex problems \nwhere data analysis problems can also be converted into optimization\
    \ solutions [47]. \nTable 1 Importance of V’s in Big data\nVolume\nVariety\nVelocity\n\

    \ mining technologies [48]. However, in section IV, various \napplications of\
    \ big data are described.\nFew sectors, such as Banking (25%), Services (15%),\
    \ and Manufacturing (15%,) are the \nthree most active industries in making inquiries\
    \ about big data to Gartner over the last \ntwelve months. The adoption of big\
    \ data in different sectors reached up to 53% [49]. IoT \nand big data projects\
    \ have increased as industries focus on data for decision-making sys-\ntems for\
    \ positive impact and business improvements [50]. Crop yield improvement is \n\
    another big data application area where production prediction enhances the agricultural\
    \ \nfield [51]. Big data applications, features, and challenges of different industries\
    \ are men-\ntioned in [52]. Big data is used effectively to improve smart farming\
    \ and reduce wastage \n[53]. Big data analysis is also helpful in improving the\
    \ food supply network within agri-\ncultural-based industries. Similarly, the\
    \ authors mention the importance of data mining, \ndata analytics, cloud computing,\
    \ machine learning, etc., in the big data paper [54].\nSystematic big data analysis\
    \ review\nResearch articles have been selected from IEEE Access, Elsevier, ScienceDirect,\
    \ \nSpringer, Procedia, Scopus, SCI, SCIE, SSCI journal of repute, etc. Big data\
    \ applications, \nresources, links, and availability have been taken from Gartner,\
    \ fact sheet telehealth, etc. \nThe author has identified the diversified nature\
    \ of big data, so the focus of is the litera-\nture review is to find out the\
    \ answer to the following questions:\n1. What is the need and importance of big\
    \ data applications?\n2. How is big data analytics suitable for industrial processing\
    \ and the healthcare sector?\n3. The application domain’s data life cycle identifies\
    \ a verified problem like data filtering, \noutlier removal, and missing value.\n\
    The big data applications have been explained in Sect.  4. A comprehensive literature\
    \ \nreview was performed, keeping these above points in mind. In 2010, Apache\
    \ HADOOP \ndefined big data as “datasets which could not be captured, managed,\
    \ and processed by \ngeneral computers within an acceptable scope.” Based on this,\
    \ in May 2011, McKinsey \n& Company announced big data as the next frontier for\
    \ innovation and productivity \n[18]. Big data is suitable for designing models,\
    \ tools, and methods for different func-\ntions, including operational and clinical\
    \ activities for the healthcare sector [19]. This \nbig data analysis review comprises\
    \ other research papers, including business process-\ning and health. The territory\
    \ of big data is a vast and diverse one. Since big data has \nhigh scope in different\
    \ sectors, big data analysis and technology reviews concerning a \nparticular\
    \ domain become important. It has been observed that automation generates \ndata\
    \ duplication and data entry errors in the system. There is a need to identify\
    \ common \nchallenges among sectors or applications that can be further researched\
    \ and improve \naccessibility in different applications. Moreover, it is essential\
    \ to know how big data \nsupport various sectors in today’s scenario, irrespective\
    \ of challenges and issues in the \nusability of tools and techniques.\nSince\
    \ industrial processing task (including the manufacturing sector) encompasses\
    \ \nthrough massive data set for quality evaluation of product and also used for\
    \ future \nPage 8 of 35\nRahul et al. Journal of Big Data          (2023) 10:133\
    \ \nprediction of outcome for identifying the nature of the customer, prediction\
    \ of selling \nproduct to end-user, price of the product, the end-user habit of\
    \ purchase, etc. Since data \nsizes are growing fast; thus, the manufacturing\
    \ process becomes complicated and com-\nplex to execute practically [23]. Big\
    \ data is suitable for process optimization and helps \nempower the decision process.\
    \ Before giving the importance of any mechanism, we need \nto review the work\
    \ done in this area with methodologies, features, and challenges. The \nresearch\
    \ methodologies of selected research papers are based on the search mechanism\
    \ \n“Big Data,” Big Data in Healthcare,” “Big Data in Industries,” and so on.\
    \ Thus, Table 2 \nshows the details of the work done by the various authors.\n\
    So, the above articles show various methodologies and features used in different\
    \ \ndomains and applications. From the above research papers [7, 19, 23, 27, 31–35],\
    \ the \nchallenges found in different terms. It includes data cleaning, missing\
    \ value, and outlier \ndetection under various applications. It affects in the\
    \ following ways: interaction among \nusers, sharing of data through a common\
    \ platform, high accessibility among users, social \nsupport, health-related clinical\
    \ information, and health policy. Big data research proj-\nects need a search\
    \ engine for healthcare, financial transactions, weather data., index \nstructure,\
    \ and search mechanism [69]. In [19], the authors expressed data staging errors\
    \ \ngenerated during integration, transformation, and migration. Since data generated\
    \ for \nanalytics must go through the data cleaning process, several errors such\
    \ as whitespace \nremoval and no. of zero’s for identified numbers are addressed.\n\
    Different simulations environment were used, including parallel computing, modeling,\
    \ \nmetaheuristic approaches, artificial intelligence environment, knowledge handling,\
    \ data \nanalysis, reporting, machine learning, deep learning, principle component\
    \ analysis, out-\nlier removal, cleaning model, and random forest machine learning\
    \ algorithm, etc. in the \narticles mentioned above. Data cleaning models and\
    \ outlier analysis are the most impor-\ntant simulation methods of various applications. Different\
    \ experimental parameter used \nsuch as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, FPR,\
    \ FNR, negative NPV, and FDR were used to \ncompare with the existing models [7,\
    \ 19, 23, 27, 31–35].\nMore in-depth machine learning-based experimental analysis\
    \ was executed to resolve \nprocessing performance, where dependency reduces.\
    \ Deep learning improves classifi-\ncation performance, design pattern formulation,\
    \ and evaluation models [8]. It includes \nseveral steps, including preprocessing,\
    \ feature selection, and text classification, and is \nevaluated and compared\
    \ with global feature selection methods [8]. Data analytics sim-\nulation is used\
    \ for healthcare data. Automation is required for data storage, process-\ning,\
    \ and handling [19]. Data analysis of manufacturing sector-based applications\
    \ such \nas agricultural harvest and sorting plants have been discussed through\
    \ data acquisi-\ntion, distance-based, and regression-based approaches [23]. Data\
    \ acquisition tools are \nused for experimental analysis for different sectors.\
    \ Data preprocessing is essential to \nexecute data mining tasks to provide meaningful\
    \ information. Data preprocessing tasks \ninclude cleaning, normalization, transformation,\
    \ missing value imputation, data integra-\ntion, noise identification, etc. [27].\
    \ Because of the large volume of data and different data \naggregators, it becomes\
    \ difficult to maintain the data stream. Therefore, big data reduc-\ntion methods\
    \ are explained through network theory, compression, redundancy elimina-\ntion,\
    \ data preprocessing, dimension reduction, data mining, and machine learning as\
    \ \nexperimental approaches and methodologies to reduce and filter use valid [31].\

    \ the data cleaning and outlier removal concept from big data was identified as\
    \ the \nbaseline for the subjective technological comparison mentioned above 2.\
    \ In [43], the \nauthors designed a deep learning framework structure, discussed\
    \ the importance of IoT \nbig data, and found that IoT generates a different type\
    \ of massive data. It accesses and \nprocesses deep learning models resulting\

    \ of mobile data, which has been generated at a large scale, is \nrequired. The\
    \ authors expressed various challenges and opportunities in big data health-\n\
    care, describing human behavior, and data mining [39].\nThe authors showed how\
    \ much statistics are essential for big data.It showed how big \ndata relates\
    \ to statistics and concluded that it could optimize dynamic decision prob-\n\
    lems, re-routing vehicles, live traffic management, skipping stops (if permitted),\
    \ or allo-\ncating platforms [70]. Big data encompasses data generation, acquisition,\
    \ storage, and \naccess. There are processes to generate data for all these phases,\
    \ acquire data at a few \nlevels, and store it. In [71], the authors showed integration\
    \ and customization of exist-\ning data and the knowledge of different experts\
    \ to use big data for smart cities as one \napplication area, which will be discussed\
    \ in the next section. The authors have developed \na framework of data and knowledge\
    \ for smart cities drawing from the application-ori-\nented perspective. Now industries\
    \ are interested in big data’s high potential and appli-\ncations. In contrast,\
    \ government agencies also announced launching big data-related \nprojects for\
    \ societies’ welfare [71]. The authors addressed big data problems from a \ndistributed\
    \ perspective. They studied several significant data challenges, mainly on the\
    \ \nmachine learning (ML) algorithm following the MapReduce programming model,\
    \ where \nfusion is the core of the system [72]. Development of distributed analytics\
    \ models for \nbig data, where filtered data should be given to MapReduce programming.\
    \ According \nto [73], the authors discussed the role of statistics regarding\
    \ some issues (heterogeneous \nsources, sub-population clusters, representation,\
    \ significance, etc.) raised by big data in \nthe new paradigm. It shows how big\
    \ data relates to different areas of knowledge. Hence, \nthe authors believe in\
    \ providing high-quality and complete solutions to such issues. \nExperts from\

    \ and diagnosis is explained briefly in [82]. Large \namounts of data are generated\
    \ here through medical devices like MRI, CT, FMRI, etc. \n[82]. Big data application\

    \ effectiveness \n[82]. Big data’s significance relies on national development,\
    \ industrial upgrades, scien-\ntific research, interdisciplinary research, and\
    \ better prediction for the future [83]. Big \ndata applies to other sectors,\
    \ including banking and securities, insurance, manufactur-\ning, natural resources,\
    \ etc. (Fig. 1.)\nGovernment policies\nBig data are valuable and helpful for various\
    \ schemes. It helps the government under-\nstand the clusters of objects that\
    \ provide end-users facilities. Collecting data sets helps \nthe government identify\
    \ areas and methods to profit the nation’s citizens. It includes \ndata received\
    \ from every transaction and other access to IT resources such as e-Mitra. \n\
    Big data provides a platform for government officials to share and exchange information\
    \ \nabout the public’s direct beneficiaries of schemes. However, there are still\
    \ challenges in \nfiltering and accessing the correct data and information, a\
    \ massive problem in a sur-\nvey of below poverty line (BPL) and other schemes.\
    \ The primary beneficiaries are still \naway from getting benefits from the government.\
    \ So, the big data cleaning and cluster-\ning approach to data filtration help\
    \ citizens access government resources on time. Data \ncleaning is also applicable\
    \ in crop selection analysis in agricultural applications, where \nbig data is\
    \ used effectively [84].\nFig. 1 Big data applications\n \nPage 15 of 35\nRahul\

    \ are the recent concern of big data applications where intelligent cities such\
    \ \nas “smart health, smart logistics, smart education, smart transport, smart\
    \ energy, etc.“ \nexist. However, these components require different data sets,\
    \ acquisition methods, \nabstraction methods, classification and clustering of\
    \ features, etc. People live a quality \nof life with an efficient and practical\
    \ living model [71]. It comes to every citizen once a \ncity’s system is established\
    \ in all respects [38].\nEfficient classification algorithms are proposed in the\
    \ form of multi-class classifica-\ntion, Naïve-Bayes classification, etc. [85].\
    \ Intelligent cities improve people’s living stan-\ndards by providing support\
    \ for innovative health serviInnovativeSmart health services \nrequire real-time\
    \ data for processing and sharing, sensors facilities, cloud services, the \n\
    transformation from mobile to cloud, and sensors systecovercloud, etc., for various\
    \ \nactivities. Virtual machine (VM) migration technology transfers heterogeneous\
    \ data \nto the cloud for access and store efficiency [86]. The authors have identified\
    \ a virtual \nmachine (VM) model with an ant colony optimization (ACO) approach\
    \ for heteroge-\nneous cloud computing systems (CCS) to enhance services in the\
    \ innovative health sys-\ntem [86]. IoT-based big data is suitable for the decision-making\
    \ system to form a smart \ncity through MapReduce and HADOOP [87]. IoT is becoming\
    \ an essential tool for ICT \nsupport in the smart cities framework designing\
    \ process [88]. Smart city data analytics \npanel (SCDAP) was developed to incorporate\
    \ functionalities, data model management, \nand information and communication\
    \ technology (ICT) tools to the urbanization devel-\nopment of facilities for\
    \ residential citizens [89].\nEnergy & Utilities\nEnergy & Utilities industries\
    \ have started shifting from traditional systems like geo-\ngraphic information\
    \ system (GIS) to cloud-based and big data (where many open-source \ntechnologies\
    \ help achieve cleansing or filtered data from a large data pool). Industrial-\n\
    generated sensor data are everywhere, and it is helpful for Energy &utility sector.\
    \ This \nsensor data may be useful for predictive analysis modeling for the market,\
    \ and spatial \nmodeling design for analysis, including investigation, construction,\
    \ transportation, and \ndistribution. Big data open-source technologies can save\
    \ time and money when a large \nvolume of spatial, sensors, and GIS data are converted\
    \ through HADOOP.\nEducation sector\nNowadays, information and communication technology\
    \ (ICT) is an essential tool in the \neducation sector, and every government has\
    \ been promoting it since its inception. It \nimproves effectiveness and efficiency\
    \ at teaching and learning levels in education [38]. \nIt also increases the outcome\
    \ and productivity at various levels, and the government has \nbeen supporting\
    \ implementing and enhancing assessments every time to benefit stake-\nholders\
    \ and citizens. Innovative education policies bring an active learning environment\
    \ \nfor stakeholders, and through operational learning phases, society becomes\
    \ educated \nand understands the value of growth in all respect [38]. Big data\
    \ transfer data and \nknowledge through ICT tools to citizens, access resources,\
    \ and engage in implementa-\ntion projects. With the help of ICT and Big data\
    \ technologies, a knowledge-sharing pool \nwas generated, institutions collaborated,\
    \ and industries-academia collaborations were \nperformed, which helps build healthy\
    \ societies and nations [38]. To understand the job \nPage 16 of 35\nRahul et\

    \ data,” an article published in this work identified the content \nanalysis for\
    \ job advertisements [90].\nE-commerce\nIt is one of the most significant big\
    \ data applications, and because of this commercializa-\ntion status, the values\
    \ keep going on. In e-commerce, big data keep records of customers \nwho purchase\
    \ support to identify customers based on a health context. There are several \n\
    ways in which big data may arise. In industries, the main objective is to earn\
    \ more prof-\nits by providing services, goods, and materials in a competitive\
    \ market and satisfying \ncustomers and other stakeholders [91]. E-commerce industries\
    \ need big data analytics \nfor various purposes, including decision making, market\
    \ segmentation, business model, \ninfrastructure, and transparency. Different\
    \ types of big data are used in e-commerce, \nsuch as transaction or business\
    \ activities, voice, video, etc. In contrast, business value \ndefines e-commerce\
    \ functions in detail [92]. As per [93], a CPG company generates \n1,52,000 samples\
    \ per second, resulting in 4 trillion data per year, which need to manage \neffectively\
    \ and efficiently through the data processing stages.\nThe authors defined big\
    \ data analytics as finding data values for industries and the \neconomic system,\
    \ human interactions with data analytics, process integration, and \nautomation\
    \ [94]. To make business experts understand drivers and the advanced ana-\nlytical\
    \ system implementation process, to upgrade the business process system, suitable\
    \ \nfor transparency, descriptive, and predictive, which are closely related to\
    \ organizational \nfunctions. In 2016, 24 articles on big data in supply chain\
    \ industries were published \n[94]. The authors have expressed different big data\
    \ analytics applications in supply chain \nindustries, including finance, manufacturing,\
    \ and healthcare [94]. Business value is \nachieved through big data architectural\
    \ concepts and information technology capabili-\nties vision [95].\nTransportation\
    \ and logistics\nThis is another big data application area where the integration\
    \ of e-commerce with \ntransport or logistics plays a vital role in boosting industries\
    \ for profit. But at the same \ntime, many challenges occur due to large and inappropriate\
    \ data generated by different \nsources of devices and equipment [96]. Data analytics\
    \ tools require integrating compo-\nnents in the transport and logistics industry,\
    \ but problems cannot be solved up to the \nmark.\nData analytics tools are used\
    \ to inspect, filter, and transform (e.g., OpenRefine, Knime, \nR-programming,\
    \ Orange, etc.) and to find meaningful results in big data [96]. Transport-\n\
    related data is growing, including aircraft passengers worldwide, so processing\
    \ becomes \nessential to provide features such as optimized infrastructure, better\
    \ customer services, \nand prediction of components such as wrong road, traffic,\
    \ passengers availability, etc. \n[96]. The data processing mechanism includes\
    \ refining and collecting multiple data from \ndifferent sources and aggregating\
    \ them for processing [96]. Tourism is the other sector \nwhere big data is used\
    \ to find prospective tourists based on the prus data.\nMedia and entertainment\n\
    This is another area of big data applications where media and entertainment agen-\n\
    cies want to access big data resources in a profitable manner [97]. With large\
    \ numbers \nPage 17 of 35\nRahul et al. Journal of Big Data          (2023) 10:133\
    \ \nof digital audiences, media, and entertainment industries can utilize their\
    \ big data \nresources more effectively [98]. The media and entertainment industries\
    \ use big data to \npredict what audiences want, scheduling optimization, increase\
    \ acquisition and reten-\ntion, effective ad targeting, etc. [98]. Big data challenges\
    \ in media and communications \ninclude leveraging mobile content, collection,\
    \ analysis, pattern recognition, etc. [52]. \nVarious big data applications in\
    \ media and entertainment exist, including data journal-\nism, dynamic semantic\
    \ publishing, social media analysis, crisscross-sealing ducts, prod-\nuct development,\
    \ and audio insight [14].\nBig data in business organization\nBig data is synonymous\
    \ with business intelligence and business analytics tools \n(HADOOP, HPCC, STORM,\
    \ QUOBLE, CASSANDRA, Spark, Rapid Miner, SAS, \nKnime, Orange, Weka, etc. NodeXL,\
    \ Gephi, etc.), and data mining. It has shifted the \nbusiness intelligence approach\
    \ from reporting and decision support systems to predict-\ning operations’ benefits\
    \ [91]. These big data tools (HADOOP, CASSANDRA, etc.) and \ncloud-based analytics\
    \ brought advantages to businesses when the data volume was high. \nA hybrid kernel\
    \ fuzzy c means algorithm (HKFCM) is proposed To maintain the volumi-\nnous data\
    \ through clustering [99]. This method is passed through the setup and encryp-\n\
    tion stage, data storage, data reconstructions, and access stage [99].\nFig. 2\
    \ Big data in business organization\n \nPage 18 of 35\nRahul et al. Journal of\
    \ Big Data          (2023) 10:133 \nThese tools and in-memory analytics easily\
    \ identify new data for business profit and \nhelp industries predict outcomes\
    \ based on learning or trained data. Big data in business \norganization has grown\
    \ from a decision support system to analytics and can be under-\nstood from the\
    \ below diagram (Fig. 2).\nBig data is essential and compares technologies, products,\
    \ services, customers, suppli-\ners, feedback, etc. of peers. Big data is a concept\
    \ that implies access to and storing large \nvolumes and a variety of data along\
    \ with processes, where industries use data through \nseveral techniques and commercialize\
    \ it [28]. The big data processing method is an \neffective in a large business\
    \ organization where a large amount of data is available to pro-\ncess. Still,\
    \ it includes data duplicity, noisy data, missing values among data, etc.\nIt\
    \ contains many forms, and according to the query generated, it’s been provided\
    \ to \nthe client. So, industries’ benefits would be cost optimization, less time,\
    \ new product \ndevelopment process, understanding market conditions based on\
    \ customer demand, \nand online business control through sentiment analysis.\n\
    Big data in industrial processing\nBig data are defined as voluminous data generated\
    \ through different sources and medi-\nums. It stores data beyond the feature\
    \ of a relational database system—industrial exten-\nsive data rises-A whitepaper,\
    \ including its importance in [93]. Big data analytics provides \nmany supports\
    \ like a decision support system, predictive modeling, futuristic activities,\
    \ \ncustomers, business operations to industries, or enterprise systems [100].\
    \ Analytics-\nbased enterprise information system (EIS) explains knowledge-based,\
    \ analytics engine, \nbig data analytics, and service analytics, which passes\
    \ to GUI (graphical user inter-\nface) based approach to the end-user for facilitation\
    \ [100]. Big data is a data analysis \ntechnique enabled recently in industries\
    \ and other sectors mentioned above in Sect. 4. \nBecause of its voluminous, cloud\
    \ computing supports data storage of big industrial data \n(BID) and processes\
    \ it for computing purposes. Various industries like telecommuni-\ncation, manufacturing,\
    \ retail, agriculture and farming, fitness, sports, consumer goods \nand trade,\
    \ building, insurance, transportation, banking, financial services, tourism, and\
    \ \ngovernment benefit and implement big data technologies [101]. Manufacturing\
    \ indus-\ntries also need the resource management process long term profitability\
    \ identification \nthrough a decision support system [102]. Manufacturing industries\
    \ require big data \nanalysis to optimize the resources and maximize the industrial\
    \ benefits for their differ-\nent operations. Innovative industrial process 4.0\
    \ uses other data generation sources for \nits industrial processing. The various\
    \ industries (small scale, medium scale, large scale, \nand very large) use big\
    \ data differently. Telecommunication industries use 87%, finan-\ncial services\
    \ industries use 76%, and healthcare uses 60% [103]. Big data analytics (BDA)\
    \ \nis used effectively in sustainable smart manufacturing, where manufacturing\
    \ resources, \nprocesses, and products are integrated for profitability enhancements\
    \ [104]. Big data is \nsuitable for industries in different forms, such as on-demand\
    \ self-service, resource pool-\ning, rapid elasticity, cost-effectiveness, etc.\
    \ Various factors, such as human resources, \ntechnology resources, management\
    \ support, adoption cost, security, privacy, complexity, \nregulations, etc.,\
    \ affect organizational adoption of big data technologies [105]. The adop-\ntion\
    \ of big data depends on orcorporatetechnologies or environmental context [103].\
    \ Big \ndata is also suitable for cost reduction, faster and better decision making,\
    \ new products \nPage 19 of 35\nRahul et al. Journal of Big Data          (2023)\
    \ 10:133 \nand services, product recommendations, and fraud detection. Big data\
    \ are transforming \nbusinesses through the advancement of robotics and automation\
    \ system.\nThe sensor system is installed into manufacturing units and a machine\
    \ to track the \nproduct. Business intelligence (BI) comprises applications and\
    \ technologies suitable \nfor collecting, analyzing, integrating, and presenting\
    \ operational functions. The busi-\nness intelligence objective is to provide\
    \ an effective decision-making system [106]. For \ncollaborative work and outcomes,\
    \ BDA is used for organizational decision-making \nand co-innovations for many\
    \ stakeholders [107]. However, different big data analytical \napproaches lead\
    \ to business failure, where big data can bind to varying stages for justify-\n\
    ing business failure [108]. Production industries have different types (numeric,\
    \ audio, \nvideo, text, structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data) and\
    \ various data sources \n(operational unit, sensors, simulations, CCTV, maintenance,\
    \ store, online, etc.). Indus-\ntrial operations improve the business objectivities\
    \ through big data utilization, tools \nsophistication, and analytical skills\
    \ [109]. These data are used for analysis for various \npurposes, such as safety,\
    \ human resources efficiency, employee consistency, accuracy, \netc. Big data\
    \ technologies are more suitable for processing complex datasets effectively \n\
    than traditional automation and data processing. Data processing removes adhocism\
    \ \nunder several processes in data acquisition. Big data analytical technologies\
    \ extract hid-\nden patterns, correlations, and so on in this enormous data. Today’s\
    \ industries need a \nbusiness intelligence system to provide low-cost, and flexible\
    \ service models. Industrial \nprocesses handle data through different stages,\
    \ from collecting the correct data, storing \neffectively, analyzing, and reaching\
    \ end-users. In these stages, sensors generate 4 trillion \nsamples per [110].\n\
    Most IoT-based industries use Machine learning effectively to process a massive\
    \ vol-\nume of data for decision-making and accurate forecasting [111]. IoT and\
    \ industrial \ninternet, cyber-physical systems (CPS), cloud-based technologies\
    \ (CBT), data mining \n(DM), and artificial intelligence (AI) are the technological\
    \ tools for smart manufactur-\ning [104]. IoT can increase operational and recycling\
    \ efficiency by 30% [104]. In [56], \nthe author discussed improvement factors,\
    \ including big data analytics management \ncapability, technology capability,\
    \ and talent capability for different industries such as \nfinancial, manufacturing,\
    \ education, wholesale, and retail. In [23], the authors showed \ndata analysis\
    \ for the manufacturing process, including data acquisition to visualization \n\
    form that suits end users. Various sources such as simulation, energy, GIS, sensors,\
    \ strat-\negy, and ERP systems generate enormous data sets analyzed effectively\
    \ before their use. \nData action shorting plant is discussed in [23]. Industry\
    \ 4.0 requires implementations \nof modularity, security, interoperability, decentralization,\
    \ real-time, service orientation, \nand visualization [112]. The potential benefits\
    \ of big data for industries will vary from \nindustry to industry.\nAccording\
    \ to the SAP annual report 2014, a prediction and decision were made to \nimprove\
    \ player performance at the world cup in Brazil [113]. Data generated through\
    \ \nvarious devices, machines, cloud-based, business operations, systems, etc.,\
    \ in the mod-\nern industry, has reached up to 1000 Exabytes annually [114]. The\
    \ primary objective of \nusing big data in modern industrial applications is to\
    \ acquire fault-free and cost-effi-\ncient running of the process [114]. Big data\
    \ is suitable for various purposes, including \nprediction, minimization cost,\
    \ and time, the effort for a different segment for modern \nPage 20 of 35\nRahul\
    \ et al. Journal of Big Data          (2023) 10:133 \nindustries 4.0. Innovative\
    \ products are developed by the intelligent and contemporary \nindustries where\
    \ massive data sets are used, and it is well suited for intelsmartsions.\nAccording\
    \ to [114], McKinsey Inc. suggests that manufacturing costs are reduced by \n\
    50% and up to a 7% reduction in working capital by using big data. Industry 4.0\
    \ mainly \nintegrates automation, the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing,\
    \ and wireless and \nconcentric computing [112]. Industry 4.0 essential design\
    \ principles and implementa-\ntion, including different parameters. It includes\
    \ modularity, visualization, security, \ninteroperability, service orientation,\
    \ and decentralization [112]. Similarly, industrial \nIoT(IIOT) generates large\
    \ amounts of data because of the implementation of sensors, \nand IoT devices,\
    \ which create difficulty for big data processing tasks due to low com-\nputations\
    \ at IoT devices [115]. Design implementations of industry 4.0 are explained \n\
    through modularity, security, interoperability, real-time service-oriented, and\
    \ visualiza-\ntion [115]. Similarly, in [116], the authors explained different\
    \ agriculture sensors such as \noptical, mechanical, electromechanical, dielectric\
    \ soil moisture, etc. In [112], the authors \nstated the vision of the industry\
    \ 4.0 manufacturing system needs big data analytics tech-\nniques and IoT for\
    \ value creation. Big data analysis is executed through sensors, pro-\ncessing,\
    \ communication, and storage [117]. The capabilities of big data analytics (BDA)\
    \ \nin industrial manufacturing processes encompass a respective challenge (i.e.,\
    \ quality \nor process control, energy efficiency, diagnosis and maintenance,\
    \ and risk analysis) fol-\nlowed by big data analytics techniques resulting in\
    \ its values [118].\nData mining classification techniques(descriptive analytics-22%,\
    \ inquisitive analyt-\nics techniques-30%, predictive analytics techniques-41%,\
    \ and prescriptive analytics \ntechniques-7%) are defined and classified as per\
    \ the tabular form mentioned in [118]. \nDescriptive analytics is used to identify\
    \ facts based on historical data. It requires cluster-\ning, correlation, etc.\
    \ Predictive analytics predicts the future through statistical methods \nsuch\
    \ as decision trees. At the same time, prescriptive analytics is used to derive\
    \ the best \npossible outcomes [20].\nBig data analytics (BDA) requires essential\
    \ tools in a fertilizer plant, phosphoric plant, \nas mentioned in [118]. BDA\
    \ in manufacturing sectors is data-driven and uses artificial \nintelligence,e\
    \ (AI) and machine learning (ML) approaches to provide actionable results.\nBig\
    \ data in the healthcare sector\nThe health sector is a data-rich, high-volume\
    \ sector. The health sector is another criti-\ncal sector, and quality health\
    \ services should be provided to everybody irrespective of \ntheir place, caste,\
    \ and religion in society. In the healthcare sector, millions of sensors \nand\
    \ devices generate patient-related data at different levels every day, which can\
    \ pre-\ndict the disease and be helpful to suggest citizens of the societies.\
    \ Healthcare analytics \nis required for inpatient privacy, security, care, treatment,\
    \ etc. [13]. The authors have \nalso shown growth in healthcare analytics in the\
    \ last eight years, from 2010 to 2018, \nwhere various journals and conferences\
    \ paper were published [13]. In fact, in the health-\ncare industry, many devices\
    \ in hospitals nationwide generate different data about the \npatient’s health\
    \ that can be sent to the cloud to support IoT services [91]. Integration \nof\
    \ IoT for e-healthcare is discussed in [119]. Here, the importance of cloud computing\
    \ \nintegration with IoT was discussed through different tier explanations of\
    \ other devices \n[119]. Healthcare information system (HISs) for diabetes analysis\
    \ employs big data tech-\nnologies where statistical assessment enhances accuracy\

    \ \nstorage, and processing of data [124].\nDifferent types of features of big\
    \ data in healthcare are considered heterogeneity, \nincompleteness, timeliness,\
    \ longevity, data privacy, ownership, etc. [125], Different types \nand sources\
    \ of big data concepts and utilization in the healthcare sector are discussed\
    \ \nin [125]. It includes big data in medicine, such as electronic health records\
    \ (HER), elec-\ntronic medical records (EMR), personal health records (PHR), medical\
    \ images, vitals, \nhuman body samples, and clinical trials [125]. It includes\
    \ big data concepts in public \nhealth, medical experiments, medical literature,\
    \ hospital information system (HIS), and \nits evolution [125].In a similar line,\
    \ the role of Nano-sensors and networks is suitable for \na futuristic healthcare\
    \ system where physical Nano-sensors, chemical Nano-sensors, and \nBio Nano-sensors\
    \ are used [126]. Different literature explosions up to 1800 have been \nrecorded\
    \ till 2017 in healthcare searched in PubMed as shown by the authors in [125].\n\
    Big data is changing the healthcare sector in various ways, including health track-\n\
    ing, reducing cost, assisting high-risk patients, preventing human errors, and\
    \ develop-\ning in the healthcare sector. The healthcare sector is rapidly changed\
    \ by transactional \ndata, where most data are transformed into electronic health\
    \ records (EHR). Medical \ntreatment cost reduction, drug efficiency analysis,\
    \ and preventive care improvement are \nmentioned in the given article [30]. In\
    \ healthcare services, telehealth provides healthcare \ninformation services through\
    \ mobile and computer devices [127]. The benefits of tele-\nhealth industries\
    \ include detecting health risks, virtual care for senior living, attracting \n\
    Medicare, etc. [127]. American health association (AHA)supports telehealth services\
    \ to \npatients in online prescribing, medical malpractice, health professional\
    \ license, privacy, \nand fraud [128]. It connects patients through videoconferencing\
    \ and other electronic \nmediums and supports medical expansion coverage. Telehealth\
    \ services have grown \nhighly in hospitals from 2010 to 2017 [128]. Most hospitals\
    \ (61.2%) implemented tele-\nhealth services until 2017 as per [128]. In 2015,\
    \ it was 43.1% and grown up to 53.0% in \n2016 [128].The scope of telehealth exists\
    \ in various terminologies of service, software, \nand hardware. Services include\
    \ remote monitoring, online interaction and communi-\ncations, and consultations.\
    \ Medical peripheral devices (MPD) include the facilities of \nECG monitors, pulse\
    \ oximeters, blood pressure, etc. [129].Different sources of big data \ngenerations\
    \ in healthcare industries are hailed from medical claims, pharmacy claims, \n\
    hospital EHR, academic researchers, etc. [130]. Big data challenges in healthcare\
    \ include \ncapturing data from multiple sources, cleaning, storage, security,\
    \ visualization, data \nPage 22 of 35\nRahul et al. Journal of Big Data      \
    \    (2023) 10:133 \nintegration, data aggregation, protecting patient privacy,\
    \ etc. Data cleaning and tokeni-\nzation is a technique of data mining [131].\n\
    EHR data are used for patient clinical treatment status. Data cleansing methodologies\
    \ \nand processes are given in [132]. The most critical challenge is analyzing\
    \ unstructured \nhealthcare big data. In a structured data generation case, it\
    \ is stored and used effectively \nthrough RDBMS software in a few instances.\
    \ Unstructured data of patient-generated \nand stored, including different tests,\
    \ scanned images, and progress notes of patients [19]. \nBig data technologies\
    \ help improve patient care, enhance operational efficiency, and \nfind a cure\
    \ for dise,ases including clinical (readmission rate, overall health outcome,\
    \ and \nother operational (general management decision making) aspects. Diseases\
    \ prediction \nis carried out by machine learning technologies in the healthcare\
    \ system through a con-\nvolutional neural network (CNN) based on risk prediction\
    \ [133]. A stochastic predic-\ntion algorithm was developed to estimate and identify\
    \ future health conditions based on \nprevious and existing health data through\
    \ correlation analysis [134]. It includes proba-\nbilistic data storage or collections\
    \ made especially for cloud-based healthcare systems, \ncorrelation analysis,\
    \ and an algorithm for predicting future health conditions [134]. Dif-\nferent\
    \ analytical tools such as semantic analysis, predictive analysis, informatics\
    \ analyt-\nics, descriptive analytics, prescriptive analytics, comparative analysis,\
    \ and exploratory \nanalytics are used in health big data analysis [135]. Healthcare\
    \ sectors must be predic-\ntive and proactive, as mentioned in [136]. It must\
    \ be individualized and focused rather \nthan populations to provide better patient\
    \ care [136]. To establish healthcare services, \nIoT, cloud services, applications\
    \ and interfaces, sensors, and technologies work together \nto form a cyber-physical\
    \ system (CBS) with unique components, including sensing, big \ndata center, healthcare\
    \ center, observation center, etc. [136],\nThrough IoT, 50 billion objects will\
    \ be connected globally by 2020 for data generation \nand sharing [137]. Big data\
    \ for IoT for modeling, data-intensive applications, services, \nand intelligent\
    \ intel environments (smart cities, etc.) is examined and used for profit-\nable\
    \ outcomes for industrial goals [138]. The various task includes data preprocessing,\
    \ \ndata fusion, feature extraction, visualization, fuzzy logic, and supervised\
    \ learning. Unsu-\npervised learning, identified problems of missing value estimation\
    \ (MVE), dimension \nreduction, feature selection, decision-making system, disease\
    \ risk prediction, and tumor \nclustering is used in the healthcare and industrial\
    \ sector for improvement as per [126]. \nMany policy actions, such as stakeholders,\
    \ data sources, data analysis, etc., are identi-\nfied in healthcare sectors.\
    \ A hypothesis of mental health cases and Northern Ireland was \nexplained through\
    \ data science and machine learning technologies where much hetero-\ngeneous medical\
    \ data set was used [139].\nBig data in healthcare includes multiple factors such\
    \ as public records, search engine \ndata, smartphones, patient portals, generic\
    \ databases, and electronic health records \n(EHR) [140]. The medical expert system\
    \ and big data analytics (BDA) in healthcare \nare discussed in [141]. It explained\
    \ the data analysis life cycle, multiple data genera-\ntion sources, and CHESS(Comprehensive\
    \ health electronics software system) [141]. Big \ndata applications in healthcare\
    \ include a few other parameters, including diagnostics, \nmedical research, reduction\
    \ of adverse medication effects, cost reduction, and popula-\ntion health [140].\
    \ Medical-related big data generations require consistency, data pri-\nvacy, and\
    \ security on platforms like cloud services [142]. One of the exciting areas of\
    \ big \ndata applications is the prediction of finding train delays through a\
    \ tremendous amount \nPage 23 of 35\nRahul et al. Journal of Big Data        \
    \  (2023) 10:133 \nof train movement data in Italy [143]. The path value of big\
    \ data in healthcare passes \nthrough data sources, analytical techniques, big\
    \ data analytics capabilities (prediction, \ndata mining, monitoring, etc.), deals,\
    \ and challenges [144]. Various activities and opera-\ntions include RFID, barcodes,\
    \ sensors, monitors, consultation recordings and notes, \npatient instructions,\
    \ social media discussions, blood test results, clinical information \nsystem,\
    \ payment, etc. It can be executed with big data databases as given in [52]. The\
    \ key \nelements such as integrating data, generating new knowledge, and transforming\
    \ knowl-\nedge into practice make the healthcare sector leverage big data more\
    \ broadly. Healthcare \nindustries have unlike types of instrumentation data,\
    \ diagnostics, unstructured data, and \nstructured data. Big data technologies\
    \ use unstructured data to store, correlate, process \nand evaluate in meaningful\
    \ terms for patient benefits [145].\nApart from the issue mentioned above in healthcare\
    \ issues, it includes some important \nand internal problems such as international\
    \ level, national and regional level, hospital \nlevel, home and family level,\
    \ a personal level as per given in [41]. Many metaheuristics \nalgorithms can\
    \ solve the healthcare sector’s optimization and complex form problems \n[41].\
    \ It includes a genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), firefly\
    \ \nalgorithm (FF), rider optimization algorithm (ROA), ant colony optimization\
    \ (ACO), \nand so on [41].\nChallenges and opportunities in big data\nAlthough\
    \ many authors give various challenges, few are important such as big data \n\
    imbalance, big data management, big data cleaning, big data analytics, big data\
    \ aggrega-\ntion, big data accessibility, and so on [146]. These challenges are\
    \ also described in big \ndata management, imbalanced big data and system capacities,\
    \ big data machine learn-\ning, and so on [122]. There is a dissimilar hindrance\
    \ to industrial big data analysis where \ninnovative manufacturing-based systems\
    \ must be implemented. It consists of long-term \ninvestment in IT infrastructure,\
    \ and it’s difficult to move on automation for industries, \nindustries regulations\
    \ and constraints, protocol systems, low vision and commitment, \nrisk association\
    \ with the new technologies, etc. [25]. Diversified challenges are found \nin\
    \ the forms of a futuristic healthcare system that includes data format standardiza-\n\
    tion, unified data schema, data quality parameter, aggregation scale, analytics\
    \ tool, etc. \n[126], There are various other challenges such as data representation,\
    \ data compression, \nredundancy reduction, data life cycle management, data confidentiality,\
    \ data analytical \nmechanism, scalability and expendability, cooperation in case\
    \ of interdisciplinary, and \nso on [18]. Big data challenges also exist in data\
    \ complexity, computational complex-\nity, system complexity, and so on [83].\
    \ However, there are several challenges in finding \nmeaningful data, and big\
    \ data is data mining, data storing, data sharing, data privacy, \ndata technologies,\
    \ and talent. Data sharing supports limited data standardization, infor-\nmation\
    \ barriers, and insufficient data integrations in big data applications [125].\
    \ In [32], \nthe authors described a few challenges for big data as a compounding\
    \ factor: dealing \nwith missing data, duplicate data, data heterogeneity, semantic\
    \ data generations, etc.\nSome important and common challenges are available with\
    \ big data in industrial pro-\ncessing and healthcare, including data storage,\
    \ data quality, security and privacy, reli-\nability and availability, big data\
    \ filtering, big data processing tool, and big data analytics. \nBig data analytics\
    \ and processing are challenging due to storage, networking, and limited \ncomputational\
    \ access [112]. In addition, more challenges with big data create hurdles for\
    \ \nPage 24 of 35\nRahul et al. Journal of Big Data          (2023) 10:133 \n\
    industries such as scalability, lack of professionals (data scientists), lack\
    \ of appropriate \ndata source with business objectives, security, and big data\
    \ project cost evaluation and \nmanagement. Various other challenges are also\
    \ found in terms of data aggregation, data \nmaintenance, data integration and\
    \ interoperability, data analysis, and so on [135]. Some \nimplementation level\
    \ challenges in the healthcare sector are data management (20%) \nand technological\
    \ issues (10.2%). Here, lack of technologies would not be in a position \nto produce\
    \ effective results, evaluation process(7.1%), financial issue (3.1%), regula-\n\
    tion(5-0.6%), awareness(0.5%) and support, political issue (0.4%), etc. [144].\
    \ So, the chal-\nlenges and techniques through various research articles/papers/works\
    \ in a consolidated \nform are mentioned below in Table 5. It represents the result\
    \ analysis report of different \nhealthcare and industrial processing works, including\
    \ methodologies, features, and chal-\nlenges mentioned in Table 2. This result\
    \ analysis people 4) shows that data cleaning and \noutliers are important and\
    \ have more weightage than other challenges.\nFrom the literature review, the\
    \ techniques below apply to the mostly application-based \nproject, which is commercialized.\
    \ In various literature review articles, it was found the \nperformance measure\
    \ in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and precision [34, 125, 147–149]. \nMost\
    \ of the article has worked with healthcare and industrial data taken from various\
    \ \nSCI, SCIE, SSCI, ESCI, Web of Science, Scopus, etc., from 96 different journals\
    \ and \nindustrial processing-related articles, including 24 other journals. These\
    \ technologies (as \nmentioned in Table 5), can also work together to improve\
    \ the result for accuracy, sensi-\ntivity, precision, and specificity.\nThe proposed\
    \ method for the data cleaning model and outlier removal has been given \nin subsections\
    \ 6.2 and 6.3. Metaheuristics approaches have been preferred with machine \nlearning\
    \ to provide better healthcare and industrial data results. It has been observed;\
    \ \nthat metaheuristics are suitably applied in classification, clustering, feature\
    \ selection, \nand association rules during experimental analysis. Table 5, shows\
    \ that enhanced data \ncleaning and outlier detection models are required to meet\
    \ noise/dirty free data for the \ngrowth of industrial performance analysis. Noisy\
    \ and insufficient data will not be suffi-\ncient to conclude any applications.\n\
    Big data filtering\nData filtering encompasses several steps in many applications\
    \ and provides better \nresults, leading to the success of the application system\
    \ in industries [77]. Big data is \na critical approach for the industrial database\
    \ system [77]. Since many sectors, such as \ntelecom, e-commerce, banking, insurance,\
    \ health, etc., rely on data generated by other \nauthentic se such as banks,\
    \ data filtration becomes essential in all respect [37]. It helps \nto ctorremove\
    \ noise, incorrect, inappropriate, incomplete, and duplicated [37]. Data \nquality\
    \ is affected by many factors, such as accessibility, completeness, accuracy,\
    \ ease \nof understanding, value-added, etc. [150]. So these factors affect data\
    \ quality in diverse \nways [37].\nHowever, the system’s dissimilar error must\
    \ be resolved before processing and ana-\nlytical applicability evaluation in\
    \ any system [37]. Data filtering includes measurement of \nerror, inconsistent\
    \ data(e.g., duplicate data, values out of band, error code, contradictive \n\
    error, etc.), outlier, missing data, etc. [37].The challenge is how to perform\
    \ and provide \nthe complexity of big data nature (volume, variety, velocity)\
    \ in a better way. It leads to \nan evaluation of the reliability analysis approach,\
    \ which identifies the relationship and \nPage 25 of 35\nRahul et al. Journal\
    \ of Big Data          (2023) 10:133 \ncomplexity of the nature of big data [146].\
    \ At the same time, it is also essential to man-\nage data collection, integration,\
    \ and storage with few hardware support and software \nrequirements [146].\nProposed\
    \ data cleaning algorithm\nFrom the literature review [60, 62, 63, 68, 75, 84],\
    \ it was identified the problem of data \ncleaning in the form of text classification,\
    \ sentiment analysis, text clustering, etc., along \nwith cleaning behavior and\
    \ algorithm usability. Moreover, the Kalman filter mechanism \nfails to support\
    \ extensive sensor data, which is a part of data generation sources in indus-\n\
    tries and the healthcare sector. The recent research of the year 2018 also identified\
    \ the \nTable 5 Result analysis report\n \nPage 26 of 35\nRahul et al. Journal\
    \ of Big Data          (2023) 10:133 \nbig data processing problem and data cleaning\
    \ problem in big data processing. So far, \ndifferent conventional data cleaning\
    \ processes and methodologies exist suc,h as inter-\nest constant conditional\
    \ functional dependency (ICCFD)_miner techniques, systematic \nsampling method,\
    \ wavelet-based multiresolution analysis technique (WMAT), algebraic \nmethod,\
    \ fuzzy Kohonen clustering network (FKCN) algorithm, Rete algorithm, distrib-\n\
    uted principal component pursuit (D-PCP), stacked denoising autoencoder (SDAE),\
    \ etc. \nThese methods include several challenges: data repairing, high processing\
    \ time, cleaning \nintegration, high computational cost, distributed real-time\
    \ cleansing, etc.\nSo, to solve the data cleaning problem, a new and novel mechanism\
    \ is proposed to \nidentify and detect abnormal data. This data cleaning approach\
    \ would be in two phases: \ndirty data detection (DDD) and dirty data cleaning\
    \ (DDC). Dirty data detection goes \nthrough data normalization, hashing, clustering,\
    \ and finding the inappropriate data, and \nthe messy data cleaning phase passes\
    \ through leveling, Huffman coding, and removal \nof erroneous data. However,\
    \ centroid selection is an issue in the clustering process and \nthe removal of\
    \ suspected data. So, these two issues can be solved through the optimi-\nzation\
    \ concept. In this case, a metaheuristics algorithm would be beneficial. For find-\n\
    ing the suspected data under dirty data cleaning (DDC), a combined approach of\
    \ rider \noptimization algorithm (ROA) and firefly algorithm (FF) can be considered.\
    \ The perfor-\nmance of the proposed mechanism will be compared with the grey\
    \ wolf optimization \n(GWO) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) on certainspecificters\
    \ comprising false-\npositive rate (FPR), false-negative rate (FNR), precision,\
    \ accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, \netc. The healthcare dataset such as diabetics,\
    \ heart, and breast cancer is required from \nUCI Machine Learning Repository\
    \ [151].\nProposed outlier removal mechanism\nFrom the review [7, 19, 23, 27,\
    \ 31–35], it’s stated that outliers removal should be one \nof the critical challenges\
    \ and opportunities in big data-based applications. Outlier \nremoval is next\
    \ under the data cleaning process. Outlier detections are parametric and \nnon-parametric.\
    \ Statistical methods fall under parametric, whereas non-parametric \nconsist\
    \ of density-based, clustering-based, and distance-based. The k-means clustering\
    \ \napproach can be considered out of several outlier removal techniques because\
    \ it does \nnot require preliminary data information or knowledge. So far, different\
    \ methods exist \nlike k nearest neighbor (kNN), k-means with outlier removal\
    \ (KMOR), generalized lin-\near model (GLM), maximum correntropy estimator (MCE),\
    \ maximum likelihood esti-\nmation (MLE), two-stages, and standard operating procedure\
    \ (SOP). All outliers will be \nplaced into a single cluster in the proposed outlier\
    \ detection model so that it would be \nbased on a k-means clustering process\
    \ called enhanced k means outlier detection model \n(E-KMOR). However, k-means\
    \ with optimal centroid would be an approach where cen-\ntroid selection is carried\
    \ out through an optimization mechanism.\nSo, to solve the optimization problem,\
    \ a coma hybridoach of lion algorithm (LO) and \nparticle swarm optimization (PSO)\
    \ was proposed. The proposed enhanced k means out-\nlier detection model (E-KMOR)\
    \ would be compared with the existing generalized lin-\near model (GLM) and K-means\
    \ outlier removal model (KMOR) based on parameters \nsuch as accuracy, sensitivity,\
    \ specificity, and so on. The weakness of this outlier detection \nmodel may fall\
    \ under data volume. It needs large dataset values of any application. The \n\
    proposed E-KMOR is an extension of the K-mean algorithm and does not apply to\
    \ data \nPage 27 of 35\nRahul et al. Journal of Big Data          (2023) 10:133\
    \ \ncompressing. The future work may be towards implementations of EKMOR towards\
    \ \ndata sampling.\nThe big data processing tool\nMany tools support big data\
    \ compatible with cost efficiency, timing, accuracy, etc., to \nperform data analysis\
    \ tasks under massive datasets [152]. Developing large-scale, accu-\nrate, adaptive,\
    \ error-free, and fault-tolerant systems is complex [17]. Some essential big \n\
    data processing tools are HADOOP, MapReduce, HPCC, Storm, Qubole, Cassandra, \n\
    Statwing, CouchDB, Pentaho, Flink, Cloudera, etc. An experimental big data frame-\n\
    work for machine learning and graph processing is mentioned in [153]. It explained\
    \ \nMapReduce, HDFS, YARN (yet another resource negotiator), Apache Spark, etc.\
    \ [153]. \nHADOOP supports community technologies and processes data where data\
    \ is stored \n[122]. HADOOP can execute voluminous data in a few seconds with\
    \ the support of par-\nallel clusters and distributed file systems [122]. It has\
    \ been designed to reduce timing \ncomplexity and space as well. It performs fast\
    \ because of the Hadoop distributed file \nsystem (HDFS) and MapReduce. HDFS can\
    \ store different types of data formats of large \nvolumes.\nThe beauty of HDFS\
    \ exists in heterogeneous hardware and software platform-indepen-\ndent [122].\
    \ MapReduce is used for data processing through job scheduling and resource \n\
    management. One of the programming models under HADOP effectively reduces mas-\n\
    sive data processing complexity [122]. MapReduce performs execution in four stages:\
    \ \nmap function, key-value pair with the mapper, reduce function, and store key-value\
    \ \npair in the output file [122]. These tools help in multiple ways: framework\
    \ design, a data \ncomputation system, a data management platform, an architectural\
    \ structure for data \nprocessing, and statistical tests automatically for the\
    \ massive volume of data [152]. Big \ndata tools are used to develop and design\
    \ healthcare frameworks through data integra-\ntion tools, scalable searching,\
    \ processing tool, machine learning tools, real-time and data \nstream processing\
    \ tools, visual data analysis tools, etc. [122],\nBig data analytics\nFor various\
    \ application areas, big data execute transformative potential to harness such\
    \ \nvast volumes of data. Advanced data analysis tools are required to measure\
    \ the relation-\nship among features and explore data at a lower level of access\
    \ [146]. Big data appli-\ncations need real-time analysis for practical evaluation\
    \ through data processing models \nsuch as predictive analysis, NoSQL database,\
    \ Search & knowledge discovery, stream \nanalytics, distributed file sore, data\
    \ virtualization, data integration, etc. Data analytic \ntools such as (Tableau\
    \ public, OpenRefine, KNIME, RapidMiner, Google Fusion Table, \nNodeXL, Wolfram\
    \ Alpha, etc.)are used under big data to meet the required services of \nindustries\
    \ [154]. Big data analytics enhances operational efficiency, decision- making,\
    \ \nmarket demand prediction, etc.\nHealthcare-based industries use artificial\
    \ intelligence mechanisms such as machine \nlearning (ML), agent-based (AB), heuristic-based\
    \ (HB), cloud-based (CB), and hybrid-\nbased (HB). These techniques are implemented\
    \ through big data on various factors to \nenhance reliability, efficiency, accuracy,\
    \ performance, availability, QoS, etc. [155]. The \nparameters (accuracy, sensitivity,\
    \ specificity, FPR, FNR, NPV, etc.) would be used in the \nproposed work to compare\
    \ the existing algorithm such as PSO, FF, GWO, etc. These \nPage 28 of 35\nRahul\
    \ et al. Journal of Big Data          (2023) 10:133 \nparameters are used in test\
    \ cases of experimental work. Since various iterations are per-\nformed, so it\
    \ becomes essential to use. The advantages and disadvantages of machine \nlearning\
    \ are given in [155].\nFuture research outline\nVarious challenges exist in big\
    \ data that need to address. However, challenges may \ninclude new technologies,\
    \ scaling data processing techniques in big data, big data learn-\ning paradigms,\
    \ data sources, attributes, smart cities, etc.\nIt is clear from Sect. 6.4) that\
    \ big data processing tools offer various services that need \nto be verified\
    \ effectively for any system before using it. In the case of Spark, which per-\n\
    forms better than HADOOP in processing [27]. Spark is the latest technology, and\
    \ it will \ntake time to develop concepts [27]. Similarly, Flink is another emerging\
    \ technology plat-\nform that reduces the gap between stream data processing and\
    \ batch processing.\nFlink’s core supports data allocation, message, and fault\
    \ tolerance for dispersed com-\nputations over data streams. Whereas in the case\
    \ of scaling data processing technology, \nthe majority of tasks (such instance,\
    \ reduction, missing values imputation, and noise \ntreatment) need to resolve\
    \ sincerely [27]. Apart from these, the optimization of big data \ntechniques\
    \ is equally important [156]. However, the big data learning paradigm includes\
    \ \nunsupervised, semi-supervised, data stream, and non-standard, apart from classifica-\n\
    tion and regression methodologies [27]. Different analyzing tools can be considered\
    \ in \nclassification, clustering, regression analysis, and association rules\
    \ applicable after gen-\nerations of large and voluminous data in healthcare sectors\
    \ [125]. Different clustering \ntechniques exist, such as hierarchical-based,\
    \ partitioning-based, density-based, grid-\nbased, and model-based. These clustering\
    \ methods can also be used in healthcare and \nindustries [157]. Data sources\
    \ and attributes are essential in the case of data sources and \nfeatures, and\
    \ their variants in different forms are also challenging to manage [38]. Mod-\n\
    ern industries require a novel method and process improvement for big data analysis.\n\
    In industrial processing, cloud computing-based solutions are needed for ample\
    \ data \nstorage and analysis. For controlling and monitoring, generous data tools\
    \ support must \nbe focused on. Big data analysis is required for many industries’\
    \ multiple and customized \nERP solutions. Future work on big data analytics (BDA)\
    \ in healthcare is necessary for \napproach development, a mechanism for data\
    \ value maximization, risk improvement, \netc. [144]. Some issues and challenges,\
    \ such as handling extensive voluminous data, data \nprocessing, etc., are mentioned\
    \ in [158].\nConclusion\nBig data is a modern and vital area, where this paper\
    \ focused on showing various authors’ \nobjectives, conclusions, and future work\
    \ possibilities. This paper describes the author’s \ncontributions to big data\
    \ and industries with multiple technologies. It shows many open \nissues, opportunities,\
    \ and challenges that need to resolve in the future. Many challenges \nwere discussed\
    \ in the paper regarding analyzing, processing, and deployment in various \nindustries.\
    \ This paper focused on applications in modern enterprises and the healthcare\
    \ \nsector. It was focused on machine learning and other technologies such as\
    \ deep learn-\ning, classification, PCA, discretization, AHP, and data preprocessing.\
    \ These methods \nworked on healthcare, other applications, and industrial data,\
    \ where results improved \nfor better services. However, effects can be enhanced\
    \ regarding existing and studied \nPage 29 of 35\nRahul et al. Journal of Big\
    \ Data          (2023) 10:133 \nmeasured parameters, including accuracy, sensitivity,\
    \ specificity, and precision. In the \nproposed work, a few other significant\
    \ measurement parameters can be added, such as \nfalse-positive rate (FPR), false-negative\
    \ rate (FNR), negative predictive value (NPV), and \nfalse discovery rate (FDR),\
    \ and F1_Score, for higher and more effective results. These \nresults would improve\
    \ the timing complexity of the system to perform. Timing complex-\nity improves\
    \ once accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity enhance.\nBig data analytics (BDA)\
    \ in manufacturing identifies some crucial challenges which \ncan be further taken\
    \ up for improvement in terms of quality and process control sys-\ntem (QPCs),\
    \ proactive diagnosis (PD), etc., before the implementation of BDA. Big data \n\
    values such as performance improvement (PI), transparency, and decision support\
    \ sys-\ntem (DSS) would be the objective for further improvement. Sustainable\
    \ smart manu-\nfacturing, where data and services integrate to provide business\
    \ outcomes, requires \nthe effective integration of data sources. The significant\
    \ outcome state requires a data \ncleaning model to detect and rectify anomalous\
    \ data. Dirty data identification, removal, \nand outliers are essential issues\
    \ in big data-based healthcare and industrial applications. \nThese reviews show\
    \ that data processing analysis, removal of outliers, and data cleansing \nmethods\
    \ are essential issues in the large dataset under any applications. Another signifi-\n\
    cant result and conclusion of most of the research article state to develop an\
    \ optimiza-\ntion model for outlier’s identification and removal in large applications.\n\
    This paper indicates the three essential fields for further research to be carried\
    \ out, i.e., \nbig data filtering, big data processing, and big data analytics\
    \ for an organization’s techno-\nlogical improvements, organizational improvement,\
    \ and research improvement. Several \nchallenges can be carried out as research\
    \ topics, including data cleaning, outlier remov-\nals over large datasets, missing\
    \ value identification and removal and replacement, etc.\nOut of these, this systematic\
    \ review proposed a data cleaning model and outlier \nremoval model. Those modelings\
    \ are required to improve the timing complexity of the \nsystem on specific parameters\
    \ mentioned above to serve better and provide more accu-\nrate data to applications.\
    \ This paper deals with how industrial processing and health-\ncare sectors can\
    \ utilize big data to enhance services in their respective areas to benefit \n\
    organizations.\nAbbreviations\nACO \n Ant colony optimization\nADR \n Automated\

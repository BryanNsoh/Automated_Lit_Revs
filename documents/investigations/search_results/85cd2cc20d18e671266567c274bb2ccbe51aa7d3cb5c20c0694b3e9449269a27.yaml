    In the past decade, cognitive radio and cooperative communication techniques have
    been proposed in the literature for efficiently utilizing the radio resources.
    Cognitive radio is an emerging technology intended to enhance the utilization
    of the radio frequency spectrum. The cooperative communication system, with the
    same total power and bandwidth of legacy wireless communication systems, can increase
    the data rate of the future wireless communication system. A combination of cognitive
    radio with cooperative communication can further improve the future wireless network
    performance. Efficient resource allocation in cooperative cognitive radio network
    (CRN) is essential in order to meet the challenges of future wireless networks.
    In this article, a survey of resource allocation in cooperative CRN is presented.
    We discuss the taxonomy of objectives and protocols used in the literature for
    resource allocation in cooperative CRN. This paper also highlights the use of
    power control, cooperation types, network configurations and decision types used
    in cooperative CRN. Finally, directions for future research are outlined. Published

    ever increasing service demand poses new challenges in future wireless communication
    systems. One of the most prominent challenges in meeting the demand is the scarcity
    of radio resources. In the past decade, a number of techniques has been proposed
    in the literature for efficiently utilizing the radio resources-e.g., cognitive
    radio [1]–[7], cooperative communication [8]–[10] and multi-antenna communication
    [11]. Cognitive radio is an emerging technology intended to enhance the utilization
    of the radio frequency spectrum. Cooperative communication and multi-antenna systems,
    with the same total power and bandwidth of legacy wireless communication systems,
    can increase the data rate of the future wireless communication systems. A combination
    of cognitive radio with cooperative communication and/or multiple-antennae can
    further improve the future wireless systems performance. However, the combination
    of these techniques raises new issues in the wireless systems that need to be
    addressed. This survey addresses recent state of the art resource allocation tools
    and techniques used in multiuser cooperative CRN with relaying capabilities. First,
    we will briefly describe the basics and terminology of cognitive radio and cooperative
    communication and later present a comprehensive survey on existing resource allocation
    techniques for cooperative CRN. TABLE I IEEE 802.22 System Parameters A. Cognitive
    radio Formally, a cognitive radio is defined as a radio that changes its transmitter
    parameters based on the interaction with its environment [3], [12]. The cognitive
    radio has been mainly proposed to improve the spectrum utilization by allowing
    unlicensed (secondary) users to use under-utilized licensed frequency bands. In
    reality, unlicensed wireless devices (e.g., automatic garage doors, microwaves,
    cordless phones, TV remote controls etc.) are already in use [13], [14]. The IEEE
    802.22 standard for wireless regional area network (WRAN) addresses the cognitive
    radio technology to access white spaces in the licensed TV band. In North America,
    the frequency range for the IEEE 802.22 standard will be 54–862 MHz, while the
    41–910 MHz band will be used in the international standard [1]. Table I shows
    the IEEE 802.22 system parameters [4]. In the context of cognitive radio, the
    Federal Communications Commission in the USA recommended two schemes to prevent
    interference to the television operations due to secondary users. These are listen-before-talk
    [14] and geo-location/database schemes [14]. In the listen-before-talk scheme,
    the secondary/unlicensed device senses the presence of primary users signals in
    order to select the frequency channels that are not in use. In geo-location/database
    scheme, the licensed/unlicensed users have a location-sensing device (e.g., GPS
    receiver etc.). For this purpose, the locations of primary and secondary users
    are stored in a central database. The central controller (also known as spectrum
    manager) of the secondary users has the access to the location database. With
    the knowledge of primary and secondary user locations, the central controller
    can efficiently manage its resources so that there will be minimum interference
    to the primary users. Fig. 1. Spectrum management in shared use model Show All
    The main functions of cognitive radio to support intelligent and efficient utilization
    of frequency spectrum are as follows: Spectrum sensing. Spectrum sensing determines
    the status of the spectrum and activity of the primary users. An intelligent cognitive
    radio transceiver senses the spectrum hole without interfering with the primary
    users. Spectrum holes are the frequency bands currently not used by the primary
    users. Spectrum sensing is implemented either in a centralized or distributed
    manner. The centralized spectrum sensing can reduce the complexity of the secondary
    user terminals, since the centralized controller performs the sensing function.
    In distributed spectrum sensing, each mobile device (secondary user terminal)
    senses the spectrum independently. Both centralized and distributed decision-making
    are possible in distributed spectrum sensing. The central controller (spectrum
    manager), based on the spectrum sensing information, allocates the resources for
    efficient utilization of the available spectrum. One major role of the central
    controller is to prevent overlapped spectrum sharing between the secondary users.
    Dynamic spectrum access. Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) is defined as real-time
    spectrum management in response to the time varying radio environment -e.g., change
    of location, addition or removal of some primary users, available channels, interference
    constraints [1], [2]. There are three DSA models in the literature, namely, exclusive-use
    model, common-use model and shared-use model [2]. The exclusive-use model has
    two approaches, spectrum property rights and dynamic spectrum allocation. In spectrum
    property rights, owner of the spectrum can sell and trade spectrum; and is free
    to choose the technology of interest. Dynamic spectrum allocation improves spectrum
    efficiency by exploiting the spatial and temporal traffic statistics of different
    services. The European Union-funded DRiVE (dynamic radio for IP services in vehicular
    environments) project is a classical example of dynamic spectrum allocation. It
    uses cellular (e.g., GSM, GPRS, and UMTS) and broadcast technologies (e.g., DVBT,
    DAB) to enable spectrum efficient vehicular multimedia services [6]. The common-use
    model is an open sharing regime in which spectrum is accessible to all users.
    The ISM (industrial, scientific and medical) band and Wi-Fi are examples of the
    common-use model. Spectrum underlay and overlay approaches are used in the shared-use
    model. Spectrum overlay or opportunistic spectrum access is shown in Fig. 1(a).
    In spectrum overlay, the secondary users first sense the spectrum and find the
    location of a spectrum hole (vacant frequency band). After locating the vacant
    frequency bands, the secondary users transmit in these frequency bands. In spectrum
    underlay technique, the secondary users can transmit on the frequency bands used
    by the primary users as long as they do not cause unacceptable interference for
    the primary users. This approach does not require secondary users to perform spectrum
    sensing; however, the interference caused by the secondary user''s transmission
    must not exceed the interference threshold. Fig. 1(b) shows the spectrum underlay
    model. In [15], a joint spectrum overlay and underlay method is proposed for better
    spectrum utilization. An illustration of joint spectrum overlay and underlay is
    shown in Fig. 1(c). In joint spectrum overlay and underlay approach, the secondary
    users with the help of spectrum sensing first try to find a spectrum hole. If
    there is a spectrum hole, then the secondary users can use the spectrum overlay
    technique. If there is no spectrum hole, then the secondary users will use spectrum
    underlay technique. It is difficult at this point to give practical values of
    various cognitive radio design parameters because this technology still needs
    extensive field trial. There are certain testbeds available for the parameter
    evaluation of CRN. In [16], authors developed a building-wide cognitive radio
    network testbed (CORNET) that has 48 wireless software defined nodes. It consists
    of Intel based high-performance server, a radio frequency analyzer and a universal
    software radio peripheral 2 (USRP2). The testbed can scan the frequency range
    100MHz-4GHz with variable bandwidths of 10kHz-20MHz. The testbed uses amplitude
    modulation with custom filters. It has the spectrum sensing capability. For multiple
    access, the testbed uses ad hoc dynamic spectrum access network. A fully software
    driven cross-layer testbed for cognitive radio is developed in [17], [18]. The
    testbed is designed for multi-resolution spectrum sensing and interference analysis
    for ultra wide band coexistence with WiMax technology. These testbeds are still
    in test and trial phase and it is expected that this phase will take couple of
    more years. B. Cooperative communication Cooperation plays an important role in
    next generation CRN by providing means for low-power wireless devices to achieve
    high throughput. It exploits the time and space diversity to improve the performance
    of CRN. The advantages of cooperative communication in CRN include low transmission
    power, higher energy efficiency, high throughput, low interference to primary
    network, and better network coverage [38], [50], [54], [125]. Cooperation in CRN
    also introduces some drawbacks-e.g., extra relay traffic and increase in end-to-end
    latency. Recent research for CRN focused on two types of cooperation-i.e., dedicated
    and dynamic cooperation. In dedicated cooperation, there are secondary devices
    that can only operate as relays. In dynamic cooperation, any secondary user can
    cooperate with primary or secondary network. First, we will present literature
    review of dynamic cooperation and then dedicated cooperation. An overview and
    applications related to cooperation and cognitive radio is discussed in [28].
    The European Cooperation in Science and Technology funded action IC0902 project
    is undergoing in full swing to integrate the concepts of cooperation in cognitive
    radio [32]. In [19], authors present the problem of spectrum sharing together
    with adaptive user cooperation in heterogeneous cognitive relay system. The main
    goal for cooperation is to maximize the throughput with the help of user cooperation,
    beamforming and power allocation. An active cooperation between primary and secondary
    users in heterogeneous ad-hoc network is investigated in [20]. The authors propose
    a cooperation protocol that allows secondary users to relay primary users signals
    in exchange for some spectrum. This cooperation maximizes the primary user power
    savings and secondary users throughput. A percolation-based perspective connectivity
    of a cooperative secondary network is presented in [21]. In [22], authors justify
    a new cooperative cognitive transmission scheme where both the secondary user
    transmitter and receiver help relaying the primary users signals. The applicability
    and utility of distributed-cooperative and centralized-integrated resource management
    schemes to investigate the trade-off between cognitive radio computing and user
    application are shown in [23]. Analysis of packet dropping probability and the
    corresponding admission control mechanism to guarantee statistical quality-of-service
    are performed in [24]. The authors claim that the proposed scheme provides a better
    quality-of-service guarantee than direct transmissions without cooperative cognitive
    relay. The authors in [25] present spectrum policy reform in cognitive radio that
    can facilitate the use of coexistence or cooperation spectrum-sharing scenarios.
    Downlink and uplink transmission scenarios with two-stage hybrid distributed/centralized
    control schemes that require minimal cooperation between secondary and primary
    users network are presented in [26]. In the first stage, a distributed power allocation
    is proposed to maximize the coverage of the cognitive radio network. In the second
    stage, centralized channel allocation is investigated to maximize the network
    throughput. In [27], a Bayesian decision making game model is used for joint power
    and channel allocation with incomplete information in cognitive radio network.
    Diversity-multiplexing tradeoff in selective cooperation and cooperation based
    spectrum management scheme in ad-hoc cognitive radio system are investigated in
    [29], [30]. Authors in [31] analyze a beamforming based adaptive cooperation protocol
    for cognitive radio. Authors also present closed form expression for secondary
    users outage probability. TABLE II Generic Resource Allocation Problem Fig. 2.
    Basic elements of resource allocation Show All In [33], authors presented the
    multi-channel spectrum sensing problem as a coalition formation game. In their
    framework, the coalition corresponds to the secondary users for sensing and accessing
    a particular channel. The coalition utility function proposed in the framework
    takes into account sensing accuracy and energy efficiency. They also proposed
    distributed algorithms to obtain the optimal partition that maximizes the total
    coalition utility of the cooperative CRN. A joint relay selection and resource
    allocation using coalition graph game for cooperative CRN is discussed in [34].
    A cluster oriented flow resource allocation model in cooperative CRN is presented
    in [35]. Their model is based on the structure and size of the cluster, traffic
    flow, channel link condition, and the existence of the solution depend on the
    amount of relay traffic. A coordinated cluster-based cooperative sensing for cognitive
    radio is investigated in [36]. The authors show that sensing overhead can be reduced
    by transmitting sensing observations in a coordinated way. The authors proposed
    a method that makes clusters and selects the most favorable secondary user in
    each cluster to retransmit the sensing observation to a central controller. Authors
    also studied the performance of decision fusion and energy at fusion center analytically.
    Recent research in wireless communication systems shows that relaying techniques
    can offer significant benefits in the throughput enhancement and range extension
    [38]. Commonly used relaying protocols used in the literature to improve the performance
    of the wireless networks are amplify-and-forward (AF), decode and forward (DF)
    and compress and forward (CF) relaying [8], [38]. In a simple AF relaying scheme,
    a relay amplifies the received signal and forwards it to the destination. In the
    DF relaying scheme, a relay first decodes the received signal and then transmits
    the re-encoded signal to the destination. The CF scheme allows the relay to compress
    the received signal from the source node and forward it to the destination. The
    compress and forward relaying is different from DF and AF relaying. In CF relaying,
    a quantized and compressed version of the received signal is retransmitted by
    the relay whereas in DF and AF, the relay retransmits a copy of the received signal.
    In case of CF, the receiver will use necessary combining techniques to combine
    the direct non quantized non compressed signal with relayed quantized and compressed
    signal. The receiver makes an estimate of the compressed and quantized signal
    by decoding the received sequence of transmitted data and then combines this estimate
    with the direct non quantized and non compressed signal. The advantage of AF relaying
    protocol is the simplicity and reduced cost implementation. But AF relaying is
    a victim of error propagation since noise is also amplified at the relay. With
    the help of selective DF or CF relaying, we can avoid the error propagation issues.
    The CF relaying consumes more power due to its decode and compressing procedures.
    For CRN with good backhaul links, DF relaying is more favorable, while for CRN
    with relative poor backhaul links, AF relaying is more advantageous. One major
    issue of relaying protocol is the complexity at the receiver. Complexity of the
    receiver depends on the combining technique implemented at the receiver. The combining
    techniques are equal-gain combining, maximal-ratio combining, switched combining
    and selection combining. The receiver with maximal-ratio combining has the highest
    processing and implementation complexity [85]. The relays in cooperative communication
    protocols can work in half-duplex or full-duplex modes. In half-duplex relaying,
    conveyance of each symbol from the source to the destination takes place in two
    phases (two time slots). In the first phase, the source transmits its data symbol,
    and the destination and the relay(s) receive the signal carrying the symbol. In
    the second phase, only relay(s) forwards the data to the destination. In full-duplex
    relaying the relays can transmit and receive simultaneously. The performance of
    a cooperative communication system can be improved by using multiple relays, rather
    than a single relay, which convey the same information to the destination. The
    multiple relay selection/assignment gives more freedom to select good paths between
    source to relay(s) and relay(s) to destination(s). The use of multiple relays
    in a network comprising single source and multiple destinations brings the issue
    of how best to assign the relays to the destinations. Optimization of such relay
    assignment and power control has combinatorial aspects, and the exhaustive search
    for an exactly optimal solution is impractical due to its computational complexity
    [44]. SECTION II. Resource allocation in cooperative CRN In this section, we will
    describe basic elements of resource allocation in CRN with cooperative communication
    and/or multiple-antenna capability. Fig. 2 shows the basic elements of resource
    allocation in cooperative CRN. The elements include Power allocation. Efficient
    power allocation of source and relay is the key of all wireless networks. In case
    of cooperative CRN, the efficient power allocation is more challenging than non-cognitive
    wireless network. Traditional power allocation schemes for non-cognitive cooperative
    networks are not applicable to cooperative CRN as these schemes may cause unacceptable
    interference to the primary network. In cooperative CRN, power allocation is performed
    under the constraint of acceptable interference to the primary users. Relay assignment/selection.
    The use of relays in a CRN can benefit in two ways. First it can increase the
    transmission rate and, secondly the use of relays can reduce the overall transmission
    power of the systems. The use of multiple relays simultaneously can further increase
    the performance of a cognitive radio network. A well designed multiple relay assignment
    and power allocation scheme can be helpful in two ways. It reduces the interference
    induced to the primary users in multiuser CRN and increases the connectivity of
    the wireless network. In a multiple relay system, if any relay is dead or in deep
    fade the receiver can still get data from other relays. User scheduling. In multiuser
    cooperative CRN, due to resource limitations and interference constraints, user
    scheduling in intelligent way can achieve high through-put. User scheduling schemes
    select the best group of users at each time slot to maximize the total throughput.
    The complexity of an exhaustive search for user scheduling increases exponentially
    with the number of users. For example, if K is the total number of users, then
    the number of possible ways of scheduling/selecting k users is ( K k ) . Enumerating
    all possible combinations to find the one that gives the best performance is computationally
    inefficient. Due to the high computational complexity of the optimal selection
    (e.g., exhaustive search algorithm), efficient user scheduling in cooperative
    CRN is an active area research. Routing. Most of the research on cooperative CRN
    to date has focused on one or two-hop scenarios. With the advancement on ad hoc
    networks, recently, researchers have started to realize the importance and potential
    of multi-hop CRN. To get the benefits of multi-hop transmission, new challenges
    must be addressed and solved. In particular, efficient routing techniques and
    solutions must be integrated into the ad hoc cooperative CRN. Quality of service
    (QoS). QoS is a general term used for many user satisfaction related requirements.
    It comprises response time, throughput loss, rate requirements, outage and blocking
    probabilities. The main aim of QoS in cooperative CRN is to guarantee a minimum
    rate, reduction in latency jitter and packet errors. Delay. Delay is an important
    metric in any wireless network especially for real-time applications such as voice
    and multimedia. Delay in cooperative CRN is a still an unexplored area of research.
    Subcarrier allocation. Subcarrier allocation and pairing play a significant role
    in future cooperative CRN that employs OFDM in physical layer. One can increase
    the throughput of cooperative CRN with the intelligent utilization of subcarriers.
    Fig. 3. Centralized system Show All A survey on radio resource management in cooperative
    OFDMA-based network is presented in [39]. The authors gave an overview on the
    recent developments in resource allocation algorithms in OFDMA-based wireless
    networks enhanced with fixed relays employing decode-and-forward protocols. A
    survey on resource allocation and scheduling techniques in uplink OFDMA wireless
    network is provided in [40]. An overview of different adaptive power and bandwidth
    resource allocation algorithms for downlink multiuser OFDM networks is presented
    in [41]. In this survey, we present a wide range of radio resource allocation
    techniques used in CRN with relaying capability. Cooperative CRN can work in either
    centralized or distributed manner. Figs. 3 and 4 show the centralized and distributed
    scenarios of cooperative CRN. In centralized cooperative CRN, spectrum management
    is performed at a centralized controller such as base station; however, there
    is no restriction on spectrum sensing. In centralized cooperative CRN, generally,
    spectrum sensing is performed at each secondary user and decision is made at a
    central controller [42], [44], [46], [49], [51], [52], [83], [87]. Distributed
    cooperative CRN can operate in different ways. It can be ad hoc cooperative CRN
    and it can be a centralized spectrum sharing cooperative CRN with distributed
    spectrum sensing decisions [53], [58], [60], [61], [71], [78]–[80], [94]. In distributed
    CRN, selection and assignment of relays is also done in distributed manner. Relays
    can make their own decisions for cooperation based on some reward strategy. In
    distributed ad hoc cooperative CRN, every secondary user is responsible for spectrum
    management and spectrum sensing. In some Ad hoc cooperative CRNs, any SU can also
    act as a relay for primary user network. Fig. 4. Distributed system Show All Table
    II shows the generic resource allocation problem in cooperative CRN. In the generic
    resource allocation problem, the input parameters/constants are set by network
    administrator or regulatory authorities. In cooperative CRN, central controller
    generally knows about the secondary users and relays in the network. In case of
    primary and secondary network cooperation, it is possible that cooperative CRN
    central controller has the information about the number of primary users and their
    respective geographical locations. Interference threshold is set by the regulatory
    authorities. Value of interference threshold depends on the spectrum sharing regime-i.e.,
    spectrum underlay or spectrum overlay. Spectrum underlay interference threshold
    is less than that of spectrum overlay. A comprehensive and detail discussion about
    overlay and under lay spectrum sharing is presented in [107]. Selection of cooperative
    protocol depends on the nature and constraint of the wireless network. Knowledge
    of channel state information (CSI) is a significant input parameter. Most of the
    resource allocation algorithms assume that CSI is known at both transmitter and
    receiver. Figs. 5, 6 and Table III present the taxonomy of cooperative protocols,
    objectives used in cooperative CRN and network configurations respectively. SECTION
    III. Taxonomy of Cooperative Protocols Taxonomy of cooperative protocols used
    in cooperative CRN is described in Fig. 5. There are a number of different protocols
    in the literature, but three protocols are widely used in the research. These
    are amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode and forward (DF) and compress and forward
    (CF). Cooperative protocols operate in two modes, orthogonal and shared band mode.
    In orthogonal modes, multiple relays transfer the same data to the destination
    on orthogonal channels-e.g., different time slots or frequencies or combination
    of both. In [46], [51], [52], [63], [67], [70], [73], [78], authors investigate
    the power allocation schemes for cooperative CRN using orthogonal AF relaying.
    A beam-forming optimization for orthogonal AF relaying in cooperative CRN is proposed
    in [52]. Orthogonal multi-hop AF analysis is described in [60], [61]. Stability
    analysis and adaptive power allocation in cooperative AF is proposed in [67].
    In [63], the authors consider a multipoint-to-multipoint communication in CRN
    using orthogonal AF scheme. They develop a technique that jointly optimizes the
    source transmit powers and the relay beamforming weights while satisfying source
    and relay total transmit power constraints as well as the sources individual power
    constraints. The authors'' main aim was to maximize the worst signal-to-interference-plus-noise
    ratio at the destinations. In [42], authors performed joint relay and spectrum
    selection in CRN using parallel DF scheme. In [50], authors suggest protocols
    that exploit the phenomenon of source burstiness in CRN using DF relaying. In
    this scheme, the cognitive relay utilizes the periods of silence of the terminals
    to enable co-operation. They also analyze the maximum stable throughput region
    and the delay performance of the proposed protocols. A game-theoretic cooperative
    communication-aware spectrum leasing for cooperative CRN is described in [53].
    In the proposed spectrum leasing scheme, the primary network leverages secondary
    users as cooperative relays, and decides the optimal strategy on the relay selection
    and the price for spectrum leasing. Based on primary network strategy, secondary
    network determines the length of spectrum access time it purchases from the primary
    network. In [59], the authors investigate the problem of multiuser resource management
    in multi-hop CRN for delay-sensitive applications. They propose a distributed
    resource-management algorithm that allows network nodes to exchange information
    and that explicitly considers the delays and cost of exchanging the network information
    over multihop cognitive radio networks. A distributed transmit power allocation
    for multi-hop cognitive-radio systems is presented in [60]. A game theoretic analysis
    for spectrum sharing with multi-hop relaying in cooperative CRN is proposed in
    [61]. In [64], authors studied the problem of video streaming in cognitive and
    cooperative wireless networks. A geometric approach to improve spectrum efficiency
    for cooperative CRN is proposed in [98]. A low-interference relay selection for
    decode-and-forward cooperative network in underlay cooperative CRN is studied
    in [76]. Two-way relays for cooperative CRN are investigated in [102]–[104]. In
    [115], authors proposed a coding scheme that uses Wyner-Ziv based CF relaying
    for CRN. In their CF relaying, the compressed codeword is composed of two messages-i.e.,
    common and private messages. They apply Marton coding with common information
    to jointly map its private information. The authors also determine the achievable
    rate region for the proposed CF relaying scheme. In [123], the authors compare
    the optimum transmit power allocation problem for the multi-band relay in AF,
    CF and DF relaying. A comparison of non-orthogonal and orthogonal AF, CF and DF
    relaying in CRN is presented in [129]. They show that at low transmit power non-orthogonal
    AF relaying outperforms DF, CF and orthogonal AF relaying. In [132], authors presented
    different information theoretic limits for bi-directional AF, CF and DF relaying.
    In [116], authors investigate a relaying strategy that is combination of DF and
    CF relaying in CRN. They derive the achievable rate region for this combined scheme.
    Fig. 5. Protocol Types Show All TABLE III Network Configuration In shared band
    mode, multiple relays send the same data to the destination simultaneously in
    the same frequency and the same time slot. In [85], the authors examined the achievable
    data rates with shared band AF and DF cooperative strategies. A strict synchronization
    among the relays is necessary in shared band mode to avoid the interference. Delay
    in multihop wireless is a serious issue in the design of cooperative CRN. To avoid
    the delay in the communication, instead of multiple orthogonal relays or multi-hop
    communication, in [44], [48] and [62] authors propose two-hop shared-band AF communication
    in CRN. In two-hop shared-band AF communication, the receiver will get the same
    data simultaneously from multiple relays at the same frequency and time slot.
    The performance of relays in shared band is better than the performance of orthogonal
    relays, but the structure of receiver of shared band schemes is much more complex.
    Which relaying protocol is more suitable in cooperative CRN is a common question
    that arises in the research community. In [56], authors presented the comparison
    of AF and DF relaying in cooperative CRN. They considered optimal spectrum sensing
    and carrier sensed multiple access (CSMA) protocol for spectrum access and derived
    closed form expressions for network throughput using AF and DF relaying. From
    the results, they concluded that both relaying strategies have advantage over
    one another under certain circumstances and parameter ranges. The literature available
    in cooperative CRN generally deals with the half-duplex relaying protocols. The
    performance of full-duplex relaying in cooperative CRN is still an open area of
    research. Also the comparison of CF with DF and AF is still an open area of research.
    Fig. 6. Objective Types Show All SECTION IV. Taxonomy of Network Configurations
    A number of different network configurations exists in the literature. Table III
    shows the different network configuration of cooperative CRN. The network configuration
    information describes the number of transmitters, relays and receivers in any
    cooperative CRN. Generally, single transmitters are used in centralized cooperative
    CRNs [42], [44], [46], [51]–[53], [59], [62]–[64], [66], [70]. Multiple transmitters
    are typically used in decentralized/ad hoc CRNs and uplink communication in cellular
    cooperative CRN [50], [60], [61], [73], [78], [79]. In centralized cooperative
    CRNs, transmitter is the central controller of the network -e.g., cellular type
    networks. Number of receivers/destination plays significant role in the design
    of a cooperative CRN. Authors in [44], [49], [51], [66], [67], [73], present cooperative
    CRN with single receivers. Ad hoc and point to point cooperative CRN are the examples
    of single receivers. A cooperative CRN with multiple receivers is discussed in
    [42], [46], [50], [52], [53], [55], [59], [61], [62], [88]. A cooperative CRN
    with multiple receivers require computationally complex design. The broadcast,
    multicast and multiple access networks are examples of multi-receiver cooperative
    CRN. The number of relays plays important role in cooperative CRNs. The performance
    of a cooperative communication system can be improved by using multiple relays,
    rather than a single relay, which convey the same information to the destination.
    The multiple relay selection/assignment gives more freedom to select good paths
    between source to relay(s) and relay(s) to destination(s). More relays means more
    degree of freedom in the wireless network but that will add more complexity to
    the network. A larger number of relays in general increases the diversity order
    and the channel capacity. However, in a cooperative CRN, a large number of relays
    can collectively cause a significant level of interference to the primary users.
    In a multi-user cooperative CRN in which the users'' signals are separated by
    frequency division, one can reduce the interference level in each frequency band
    by cleverly grouping relays and assigning each group to different frequency bands.
    A well designed multiple relay assignment and power allocation scheme can be helpful
    in reducing the interference induced to the primary users in a multiuser CRN.
    TABLE IV Decision Types and Power Allocation Capability The use of relays in a
    CRN can also reduce the overall transmission power of the systems that can be
    helpful in reducing global warming by minimizing the emission of green house gases.
    There are a number of low-complexity relay selection/assignment schemes in the
    literature [85]. However, these relay assignment schemes are not applicable to
    CRN because optimal relay assignment and power allocation obtained from these
    schemes may generate more interference to the primary users than allowed. In [42],
    [68], [74], [76], [81], [105], authors perform single relay selection and power
    allocation in cooperative CRN. In these schemes, a relay is selected for re-transmission
    among the group of relays that have good channel with the destination or bad channel
    with the primary users. Bad channel with the primary users means less interference
    to the primary users from this relay. Distributed relay selection is proposed
    in [58] and [80]. The authors use game theoretic approach for distributed relay
    selection. Multiple relay selection and assignment are performed in [44], [48],
    [62], [82]–[84]. In [43]–[45] and [62], the authors propose multiple relay assignment
    in shared band AF relaying. Although both orthogonal and shared-band relaying
    are available in the literature, a comprehensive tradeoff analysis between performance
    and complexity for these two types of relaying still needs attention of the wireless
    research community. SECTION V. Taxonomy of Cooperative CRN Objectives, Problem
    Types and Solutions Taxonomy of cooperative CRN objectives are described in Fig.
    6. Table IV summarizes the decision types, power allocation capability, algorithms
    and types of dynamic spectrum access schemes used in the literature for resource
    allocation in cooperative CRN. There are four major categories and a number of
    sub-categories of objective functions used in cooperative CRN. The major categories
    include maximization, minimization, fairness and performance analysis. A. Minimization
    A number of situations in cooperative CRN requires to minimize certain network
    parameters. Battery power and bandwidth are the most precious resource in cooperative
    CRN. There is always a need to allocate resources in a way that the use of power
    and bandwidth are minimum. Real time applications need to minimize the delay in
    transmission. A centralized and distributed power minimization at relays with
    the target output SNR constraint in multihop CRN is investigated in [60]. A monomial
    approximation based distributed and centralized power control algorithm to minimize
    the network power is proposed in [70] and [71]. The authors proposed centralized
    and distributed geometric programming to solve the power minimization problem.
    In [81], authors studied a weighted bipartite graph model and a minimum weighted
    assignment approach to minimize the total power of cooperative CRN. The authors
    use statistical channel state for power minimization. A multi-agent learning algorithm
    to learn the behaviors of interacting cognitive radio nodes for delay sensitive
    cooperative CRN is proposed in [59]. The authors focus on delay sensitive applications
    such as real-time multimedia streaming, i.e., the receiving users need to get
    the transmitted information within a certain delay. Due to the decentralized nature
    of the multihop wireless networks, the authors propose decentralized approach
    to solve the problem. They minimize the required network-wide resource to support
    a set of multicast sessions, with a given bit rate requirement for each multicast
    session. B. Maximization The main aim of maximization in cooperative CRN resource
    allocation is to maximize its total throughput (sum-rate capacity), signal to
    noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver and network utility maximization. SNR maximization
    is similar to the throughput maximization. One drawback of SNR maximization is
    that it can not be used to determine the total network throughput. Network utility
    optimization is a powerful optimization tool to allocate radio resources in wireless
    networks. System-wide network utility functions are designed to tackle multiple
    objectives at the same time. In [42], authors mainly focus on the problem of how
    to allocate resource appropriately to maximize the meaningful system throughput
    under the QoS requirements in cooperative CRN. The main objective is to maximize
    the sum-rate by jointly determining the relay selection, spectrum allocation and
    power allocation. The authors propose a three-stage heuristic to solve the sum-rate
    maximization problem. In [44] and [47], authors proposed efficient relay selection
    schemes for sum-rate maximization in cooperative CRN. A biogeography-based optimization
    for joint relay assignment and power allocation in shared band cooperative CRN
    is investigated in [48]. A cross-layer approach to allocate transmit power to
    different packets favoring those which have traveled more hops before reaching
    a particular node in multihop CRN is proposed in [79]. The authors presented a
    distributed implementation using Lagrangian duality. A joint power allocation
    and multiple relay selection in shared band AF for sum-rate maximization is described
    in [83] and [92]. The paper [46] considers Maclaurin expansions to solve the throughput
    maximization using non orthogonal AF scheme in CRN. Power and channel allocation
    for cooperative relay in a three-node cognitive radio network is investigated
    in [69]. The main aim of the power and channel allocation is to maximize the overall
    end-to-end throughput. The authors in [77] studied joint relay beamforming and
    power allocation in cooperative CRN. In [117], a mathematical formulation is proposed
    with the objective of minimizing the required network-wide radio spectrum resource
    for a set of user sessions. The proposed formulation is a mixed-integer non-linear
    program. The authors proposed a lower bound for the objective by relaxing the
    integer variables and using a linearization technique. A near-optimal algorithm
    is presented that is based on a sequential fixing procedure, where the integer
    variables are determined iteratively via a sequence of linear programs. In [65],
    relay selection in multi-hop CRN with the objective of minimizing the outage probability
    is proposed. The power allocation problem is solved using standard convex optimization
    techniques for both AF and DF protocols under Rayleigh fading conditions. A joint
    relay selection, spectrum allocation and rate control scheme in CRN is proposed
    in [119]. A three-stage sub-optimal algorithm is proposed to address the joint
    relay selection, spectrum allocation and rate control problem. A non-cooperative
    game based decentralized power allocation for primary and secondary users is considered
    in [120]. The two kinds of links, one of which includes the primary users and
    their relay, the other includes the secondary users and their relay, are treated
    as players of the non-cooperative game. Each player competes against each other
    by choosing the power allocation strategy that maximizes its own rate, subject
    to the QoS threshold of the primary system. A relay-assisted iterative algorithm
    is proposed to efficiently reach the Nash equilibrium. In [60], authors proposed
    both centralized and distributed power allocation schemes for multi-hop wideband
    CRN. The main objective is to maximize the output signal-to interference plus
    noise ratio at the destination node of the CRN. C. Fairness Fairness in cooperative
    CRN is used to avoid unbalance utilization of radio resources. In max-min fairness,
    the network administrator wants to maximize the worst user throughput. In rate
    proportional fairness, radio resources are allocated according to the proportional
    rate demand of the users. The paper [63] consider a multipoint-to-multipoint cooperative
    CRN aiming to maximize the worst signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio of the
    destinations. The authors develop a technique that jointly optimizes the sources
    transmit powers and the relay beamforming weights while satisfying the sources
    and the relays total transmit power constraints as well as the sources individual
    power constraints and further guaranteeing that the interference powers inflicted
    from the cognitive network on the existing primary users. A semidefinite relaxation
    technique is proposed to determine beam-forming weights in CRN. A max-min based
    relay selection to minimize the outage probability is proposed in [88]. A max-min
    fairness-aware joint relay, subcarrier assignment and power allocation in multiuser,
    multicast group based cooperative CRN is introduced in [118]. D. Analysis In recent
    years, researchers analyze bit error rate (BER) and outage minimization as objective
    function in resource allocation in cooperative CRN. BER is the performance of
    the cooperative CRN receiver and outage probability is used as a metric for wireless
    channel [57], [66], [75], [88]. Outage is particularly used in slow fading channels
    [51], [57], [94], [95]. A comparison and analysis between outage optimal, BER
    optimal and rate optimal resource allocation schemes is still needed for better
    future cooperative CRN. TABLE V Problem Types and Solution Approaches E. Problem
    Types and Solutions One significant aspect of resource allocation in cooperative
    CRN is the performance and computational burden of resource allocation schemes.
    We can classify the resource allocation problems as: linear [60], nonlinear [46],
    [49], [51], [52], [63], [71], [72], [83], integer nonlinear [42], [44], [61],
    stochastic nonlinear [58] and mixed integer nonlinear [48], [53], [62], [64],
    [79], [86], [120] optimization problems. Table V summarizes different problem
    types and solution approaches used in cooperative CRN. Computational complexity
    of algorithms depends on the problem optimization structure. Optimization problems
    related to resource allocation in cooperative CRN can be convex, quasi-convex
    or non-convex. Convex resource allocation problems are solved using standard convex
    optimization techniques. In [49], authors presented convex optimization algorithms
    for capacity maximization in distributed virtual antenna arrays for cooperative
    CRN. A simplex method for centralized and distributed power minimization at relays
    for multi-hop cognitive-radio systems is presented in [60]. A convex transformation
    approach to transform a nonlinear quasi-concave power allocation problem into
    concave problem is investigated in [72]. Authors also present iterative convex
    parametric algorithm for power allocation in cooperative CRN. A restless bandit
    approach for distributed relay selection and power control is shown in [58]. In
    [89], authors presented alternate convex optimization for power allocation for
    OFDM relay transmission in CRN. A number of different approaches proposed for
    nonlinear resource allocation in cooperative CRN. An iterative algorithm based
    on Maclaurin expansion for non-orthogonal AF protocol is presented in [46]. An
    algorithm based on projection matrix theory to get the weights of antenna arrays
    is investigated in [51]. Authors in [52] proposed genetic algorithm for nonconvex
    beam-forming optimization in AF assisted cooperative CRN. In [71], [78], [80],
    authors presented geometric programming algorithm, iterative heuristic algorithm
    and KKT based power allocation algorithm respectively for nonlinear utility maximization
    in cooperative CRN. A semidefinite relaxation technique for multipoint-to-multipoint
    cooperative CRN aiming to maximize the worst signal-to-interference-plus-noise
    ratio of the destinations is shown in [63]. An iterative heuristic for power allocation
    in shared band AF consider in [83]. Integer and mixed integer nonlinear resource
    allocation in cooperative CRN are considered as computationally intensive problems.
    Generally these types of problems are NP-hard, which means that one can not get
    their optimal solutions in polynomial time. For these kind of problems, generally
    researchers apply greedy, heuristics or evolutionary algorithms. A three stage
    heuristic algorithm for joint relay and spectrum selection in CRN using parallel
    DF scheme is considered in [42]. In [44], [62], authors presented interference
    aware iterative greedy algorithm for relay selection and assignment algorithm
    for shared band AF schemes. A game-theoretic cooperative communication-aware spectrum
    leasing for cooperative CRN is described in [53]. Authors proposed Hungarian method
    to solve the integer part by converting the problem into a min-cost bipartite
    matching problem. An evolutionary algorithm based on biogeography-based optimization
    for relay assignment and greedy power allocation to maximize the system throughput
    in shared band AF is presented in [48]. A branch and bound framework and convex
    relaxation techniques to enhance video streaming in cooperative CRN is investigated
    in [64]. An iterative algorithm for relay assignment and water filling approach
    for power allocation in cooperative CRN is discussed in [90]. SECTION VI. Future
    Research Directions The cooperative CRN schemes discussed in this survey address
    the aspects of resource allocation in CRN with relaying capabilities. However,
    there are still many open issues. In the following, we list some important future
    research directions. A. Multihop relaying in CRN Although there are some papers
    available for multi-hop CRN in the literature, some fundamental problems need
    more attention and studies, for example: How to optimally allocate power and use
    multiple relays for data transfer in single and bi-directional multi-hop CRN.
    How to minimize the number of relays used in the network while keeping the users''
    QoS above certain limits. A possible extension of the resource allocation in multihop
    CRN is to analyze the centralized and distributed power allocation and relay assignment
    schemes with imperfect or outdated CSI. Another interesting issue to consider
    is the effect of quantized CSI on the relay assignment in multi-hop cooperative
    CRN. A thorough analysis and comparison is still required between orthogonal and
    shared band AF and DF relaying in terms of delay, power saving, receiver complexity
    and QoS in multi-hop CRN. B. Cooperative CRN with imperfect CSI Designing a cooperative
    CRN with imperfect or outdated CSI is an active and open area for research. There
    are some papers available in the literature [121], [122], [124], [126]–[128],
    [130], [131], [133]–[135]. In [121], [122] where different power allocation schemes
    were presented for cooperative CRN with imperfect CSI. In [124], authors investigate
    probabilistic interference model for power allocation in cooperative CRN. An imperfect
    spectrum sensing based cross layer QoS provisioning for cooperative CRN is discussed
    in [133]. They used partially observable Markov decision process for CRN relay
    selection. In [130], authors discussed the effect of quantization on sensing data
    for both perfect and imperfect reporting channels. The authors in [126], [127]
    investigate the effect of imperfect channel knowledge on spectrum sensing in relay
    based cooperative CRN. The impact of imperfect CSI on the outage performance is
    investigated in [128], [131]. The authors in [135] quantify the impact of uncertain
    channel condition on the primary users. The authors present interference probability
    and derive the exact closed-form expression for interference probability of the
    primary users. A cooperative bidirectional relaying scheme based on relay beamforming
    in CRN with imperfect CSI is discussed in [134]. The authors used second-order
    statistics of the channel coefficients between the relays and primary users for
    their investigation. Some fundamental problems for cooperative CRN with imperfect
    CSI are still open, for example: A thorough analysis and comparison of imperfect
    CSI on different relaying scheme-e.g. AF, DF and CF is required for cooperative
    CRN. How the use of multiple relays in shared band can help in interference mitigation
    to primary network if the channel between some relays and primary network is uncertain.
    How imperfect CSI effects the multi-hop cooperative CRN. C. Green cooperative
    CRN Designing future wireless systems to be energy-efficient to cut carbon emissions
    is important. Traditionally, research and development in cooperative communications
    and CRN has mainly been focused on the functionality and the throughput performance,
    except in the case of battery-driven devices. The recent exponential growth in
    the use of wireless communications in public, professional, and private life coupled
    with the critical need to reduce green house gas emissions have induced a new
    research area called green communications with overall energy-efficiency of communication
    systems as the objective. A combination of cooperative communication and CRN can
    help in achieving the goal of green communication. Some fundamental problems for
    green cooperative CRN are still open, for example: How to optimally apply resource
    allocation for cognitive and cooperative communication techniques to increase
    the energy efficiency without sacrificing QoS of secondary and primary users.
    How to minimize the energy consumption overhead introduced by cognitive and cooperative
    communication by introducing cooperation between primary and secondary networks.
    D. Cooperative CRN for heterogeneous and machine to machine communication Heterogeneous
    networks (HetNets) are an attractive means of expanding mobile network capacity.
    A HetNet is typically composed of multiple radio access technologies, architectures,
    transmission solutions, and base stations of varying transmission power. Creating
    a HetNet by introducing low power nodes is an attractive approach to meeting the
    high data rate demand with manageable interference. A thorough study of HetNets
    with the capability of cognitive radio and cooperative communication is still
    an open area of research. There is a need to develop practical framework/schemes
    for cooperative cognitive HetNets that can work under various channel conditions
    with manageable and configurable processing complexity. It is also necessary to
    examine the tradeoffs and effects of network size, geographical conditions, type
    of cooperative protocols and regulatory constraints between the cooperative cognitive
    HetNets and traditional heterogeneous wireless networks. Machine-to-machine (M2M)
    communications is expected to be one of the emerging building blocks of the future
    wireless networks. Increasing demand for intelligent, robust and automated distributed
    systems in industrial and utility sectors is driving the need for the development
    of low power, low cost and high performance M2M systems. Can cooperative CRN solve
    the problem of cost and performance of M2M system with highly variable QoS constraint
    is still unknown. With these challenges and open research issues, there is a need
    to develop theoretical tools and practical demos that can give the effect of multi-hop
    relaying, Hetnets, M2M systems and green paradigm on cooperative CRN. SECTION
    VII. Summary In summary, research on radio resource allocation in cooperative
    CRN is quite broad and challenging. It is important to address these issues for
    better utilization of radio resources in next generation wireless networks. In
    this survey, we explored and categorized the radio resource allocation components
    in cooperative CRN and presented some future research directions. We provided
    a generic resource allocation problem in cooperative CRN. While research is steadily
    growing in cooperative CRN, we provided a comprehensive literature review of protocol
    types, network configurations, objectives and decision types used in the cooperative
    CRN. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like This Energy

    Get rights and content Abstract The fifth generation (5G) wireless networks are
    on the way to be deployed around the world. The 5G technologies target to support
    diverse vertical applications by connecting heterogeneous devices and machines
    with drastic improvements in terms of high quality of service, increased network
    capacity and enhanced system throughput. However, 5G systems still remain a number
    of security challenges that have been mentioned by researchers and organizations,
    including decentralization, transparency, risks of data interoperability, and
    network privacy vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the conventional techniques may
    not be sufficient to deal with the security requirements of 5G. As 5G is generally
    deployed in heterogeneous networks with massive ubiquitous devices, it is quite
    necessary to provide secure and decentralized solutions. Motivated from these
    facts, in this paper we provide a state-of-the-art survey on the integration of
    blockchain with 5G networks and beyond. In this detailed survey, our primary focus
    is on the extensive discussions on the potential of blockchain for enabling key
    5G technologies, including cloud computing, edge computing, Network Function Virtualization,
    Network Slicing, and D2D communications. We then explore and analyse the opportunities
    that blockchain potentially empowers important 5G services, ranging from spectrum
    management, data sharing, network virtualization, resource management to interference
    management, federated learning, privacy and security provision. The recent advances
    in the applications of blockchain in 5G Internet of Things are also surveyed in
    a wide range of popular use-case domains, such as smart healthcare, smart city,
    smart transportation, smart grid and UAVs. The main findings derived from the
    comprehensive survey on the cooperated blockchain-5G networks and services are
    then summarized, and possible research challenges with open issues are also identified.
    Lastly, we complete this survey by shedding new light on future directions of
    research on this newly emerging area. Previous article in issue Next article in

    and privacy 1. Introduction The fifth generation 5G technology, referred to as
    beyond 2020 communications systems, represents the next important phase of the
    global telecommunication evolution, with recent successful deployments in several
    areas across almost all the continents.1 The 5G cellular networks are characterized
    by three major features supporting for Enhanced Mobile Broadband, Massive Machine
    Type Communication and the provisioning of Ultra-reliable Low Latency Communication
    services (Agiwal et al., 2016). Here, the definition of 5G networks refers to
    the 5G cellular networks that has been empowered by the evolution of cellular
    technology over the long history, from 1G cellular networks to 4G cellular networks
    (Panwar et al., 2016). Driven by the explosion of smart mobile devices and the
    rapid advances of communication technologies, 5G could be a technical enabler
    for a plethora of new innovative business opportunities and industrial applications,
    and facilitates the seamless collaboration across domains by interconnecting billions
    of devices. The 5G cellular networks promise to revolutionize global industries
    and provide immediate impacts on customers and business stakeholders. The main
    vision of future 5G services is to provide a customized and advanced user-centric
    value, enabling human interconnection to meet the ever growing demands of user
    traffic and emerging services. To achieve these objectives, according to Panwar
    et al. (2016), Gupta and Jha (2015) and Hossain and Hasan (2015), several underlying
    wireless technologies have been proposed to enable 5G cellular networks, including
    cloud computing, edge computing, Network communication. Function Virtualization
    (NFV), Network Slicing, and D2D. However, the rapid surge and breakneck expansion
    of 5G wireless services also pose new security challenges such as network reliability,
    data immutability, privacy that must be considered and solved before wide deployments.
    The 5G cellular technologies will support new service delivery models and thus
    further exacerbate the security challenges. Unlike the legacy cellular networks,
    5G wireless networks are going to be decentralized and ubiquitous service-oriented
    which have a special emphasis on security and privacy requirements from the perspective
    of services. In particular, the security management in 5G is more complex due
    to various types of and a massive number of devices connected. How to provide
    an open data architecture for flexible spectrum sharing, data sharing, multiuser
    access, for example, to achieve ubiquitous 5G service provisions while ensuring
    high data immutability and transparency is a critical issue. Succinctly, the security
    architectures of the previous generations lack the sophistication needed to secure
    5G networks. In the 5G era, immutability, decentralization and transparency are
    crucial security factors that ensure the successful roll-out of new services such
    as IoT data collection, driverless cars, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), Federated
    Learning (FL). Among the existing technologies, blockchain is the most promising
    one to meet these new security requirements and reshape the 5G communication landscape
    (Christidis and DevetsikIoTis, 2016; Zheng et al., 2017). Hence, 5G needs blockhain
    for its wide 5G service deployments. Technically, blockchain is a distributed
    ledger that was firstly used to serve cryptocurrency Bitcoin (Nakamoto et al.)
    for economic transactions. The blockchain is basically a decentralized, immutable
    and transparent database. The concept of blockchain is based on a peer-to-peer
    network architecture in which transaction information is managed flexibly by all
    network participants and not controlled by any single centralized authority. In
    particular, the blockchain technology boasts a few desirable characteristics of
    decentralization, immutability, accountability, and truly trustless database storage
    which significantly improve network security and save operational costs (Tschorsch
    and Scheuermann, 2016). The rapid development and the adoption of blockchain as
    a disruptive technology are paving the way for the next generation of financial
    and industrial services. Currently, the blockchain technology has been investigated
    and applied in various applications, such as Internet of Things (IoT), (Ali et
    al., 2018a), edge computing (Yang et al., 2019a), smart city (Xie et al., 2019a),
    vehicular networks (Yli-Huumo et al., 2016), and industries (Rabah, 2017). For
    the inherent superior properties, blockchain has the potential to be integrated
    with the 5G ecosystems to empower mobile networks and services as shown in Fig.
    1. Due to the advanced technical capabilities to support future network services,
    blockchain was regarded as one of the key technical drivers for 5G at the 2018
    Mobile World Congress (MWC) (Mwc barcelona 2020). It is also predicted that blockchains
    would be a key technology in reaping real benefits from 5G networks, for giving
    birth to novel applications from autonomous resource sharing, ubiquitous computing
    to reliable content-based storage and intelligent data management (Blockchain:
    A key enabler for 5G). Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. The convergence of blockchain and 5G. The combination
    of blockchain and 5G is also expected to pave the way for emerging mobile services
    (The road to the next wave of tech: 5G +blockchain). In fact, 5G is all about
    connecting heterogeneous devices and complex networks interconnecting more than
    500 billion mobile devices by 2030 (Internet of things 2016). Besides, the emerging
    Internet of Things (IoT), and Massive Machine Communications (MMC) are predicted
    to create over 80 billion connections by 2020 (Internet of things (IoT)). In such
    a context, the ultra-dense small cell networks, a fundamental component of 5G
    infrastructure, will provide connections and energy efficiencies of radio links
    with high data rates and low latencies. However, it introduces trust and secure
    interoperability concerns among complex sub-networks. Therefore, providing a reliable
    cooperation among heterogeneous devices is vitally important for 5G mobile networks.
    In this regard, blockchain with its immutable and decentralized transaction ledgers
    can enable distributed massive communication with high security and trustworthiness
    (Salman et al., 2018). Moreover, network slicing associated with other emerging
    technologies such as cloud/edge computing, NFV, and D2D communication are also
    key enablers for future 5G networks and services. A big challenge for current
    5G platforms is the need to guarantee an open, transparent, and secure system
    among the extraordinary number of resources and mobile users. Blockchain with
    its innovative concepts of decentralized operation can provide a high level of
    data privacy, security, transparency, immutability for storage of 5G heterogeneous
    data (Chaudhry, 2018). Blockchain is thus expected to be an indispensable tool
    to fulfill the performance expectations for 5G systems with minimal costs and
    management overheads. 1.1. Comparisons with the existing surveys There are several
    survey articles in the literature that considers issues of the integration of
    blockchain and 5G networks. The authors in Dai et al. (2019) only provided a brief
    introduction of the blockchain adoption in secure 5G resource management and reliable
    network orchestration. The survey in Jovović et al. (2019) provided a short survey
    on the potential of blockchain for 5G networks in Industry 4.0. Similarly, the
    study in Mistry et al. (2020) presented a brief review on the benefits of blockchain
    for 5G-based industrial IoTs. The survey in Jovović et al. (2018) gives a brief
    introduction of the potential combination of blockchain and 5G networks. Furthermore,
    the authors in Aggarwal et al. (2019a) analyse the use of blockchain for solving
    privacy and security issues in smart communities with a number of key industrial
    applications such as healthcare, transportation, IoT, and smart grid. Another
    paper in Makhdoom et al. (2019) presents a survey on the security properties of
    blockchain that can apply to IoT networks for solving security, privacy and network
    performance challenges. The authors in Mehta et al. (2020) present a survey on
    the use of blockchain for UAV, a 5G IoT application in future networks. Meanwhile,

    our best knowledge, we are the first to provide a comprehensive survey on the
    integrated use of blockchain and 5G technologies and services. In this paper,
    we provide an extensive survey on the integration of blockchain and 5G technologies
    for providing services, including cloud computing, edge computing, Network Function
    Virtualization, Network Slicing, and D2D communication. We also detail the use

    A systematic mapping study was selected as the research method for this paper,
    aiming to provide an overview of the research related to the conjunction of 5G
    and blockchain. We follow the systematic mapping process as shown by (Yli-Huumo
    et al., 2016) because our objective is to explore the existing studies on the
    blockchain-5G integration. The systematic mapping process is depicted in Fig.
    3 with five key steps. The first stage is the definition of the research questions,
    which are listed in Table 2. By identifying the key research questions, we can
    provide an overview on the blockchain and 5G networks, and recognize the key issues
    of 5G that can be solved by using the blockchain technology. The second stage
    is to search for all the relevant scientific papers on the research topic. We
    map the papers related to technical aspects of blockchain and 5G and using only
    the terms Blockchain and 5G as the search strings so that we can filter and select
    the most relevant technical papers for our survey. Then we chose the scientific
    databases for the searches. We decided to focus on peer-reviewed, high-quality
    papers published in conferences, workshops, symposiums, books and journals related
    to the research topic. We used four scientific databases for paper retrieval,
    including (1) IEEE Xplore, (2) ACM Digital Library, (3) Springer Link, and (4)
    ScienceDirect. The third stage is to screen all related papers based on their
    titles. For example, we screen all technical papers that mention blockchain and
    5G technologies, i.e. D2D, cloud/edge computing. Meanwhile, we exclude papers
    without high content quality, papers without text availability and papers that
    were not written by English. The fourth stage is keywording. We read the abstract
    and identified keywords and concepts that reflected the contribution of the paper.
    Then, we used the keywords to cluster and form categories for the mapping of the
    studies. The final stage is data extraction that gathers all information needed
    to address the research questions of this mapping study. We focus on the analysis
    of the key findings of technical studies according to the sub-sections as pre-defined

    we present a state-of-the-art survey on the convergence of blockchain and key
    5G technologies, namely cloud computing, edge computing, Network Function Virtualization,
    Network Slicing, and D2D communication. We also provide a comprehensive discussion
    on the use of blockchain for supporting fundamental 5G requirements, ranging from
    spectrum management, data sharing, network virtualization, resource management
    to interference management, federated learning privacy and security services in
    Section 4. The benefits of blockchain for 5G IoT applications are analysed in
    details in Section 5, with a focus on popular applications such as smart healthcare,
    smart city, smart transportation, smart grid and UAVs. We summarize the key main
    findings in Section 6, and the potential research challenges and future research
    directions are also outlined. Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper. 2. Blockchain
    and 5G: background, definition and motivation 2.1. Blockchain Blockchain is mostly
    known as the technological platform behind Bitcoin (Nakamoto et al.). The core
    idea of a blockchain is decentralization. This means that its database does not
    place in a central location, but is distributed across a network of participants
    (i.e. computers). This decentralized concept provides high robustness and security
    for database stored on blockchain with no single-point failure. Importantly, blockchain
    is visible to each member in the network. This is enabled by a mechanism called
    consensus which is a set of rules to ensure the agreement among all participants
    on the status of the blockchain ledger. A concept on how a blockchain works is
    shown in Fig. 4. Download : Download high-res image (390KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. The concept of blockchain operation. In general, blockchains
    can be classified as either a public (permission-less) or a private (permissioned)
    blockchain (Wang et al., 2019a). A public blockchain is accessible for everyone
    and anyone can join and make transactions as well as participate in the consensus
    process. The best-known public blockchain applications include Bitcoin and Ethereum.
    Private blockchains on the other hand are an invitation-only network managed by
    a central entity. A participant has to be permissioned using a validation mechanism.
    In order to realize the potential of blockchain in 5G networks, it is necessary
    to understand the concept and key characteristics of blockchain, and understand
    the potentials that blockchain can bring to 5G networks. We first provide an introduction
    of the major components of a blockchain network. Then, the key components of blockchains
    are presented in terms of immutability, decentralization, transparency, security
    and privacy, which can benefit for 5G networks and services. 2.1.1. Blockchain
    components Blochain features several key components which are explained as follows.
    - Data block: Blockchain can be defined as a series of blocks, starting with a
    genesis block and interconnecting with every newly updated block to create a chain.
    Each block is strongly linked to the previous one via a hash label, which provide
    a robust interconnection among block and prevent any modification risks. Each
    data block contain two main parts: transaction records and a blockchain header
    (Dinh et al., 2018). The transaction records are arranged under a Merkle tree
    architecture of a conjunction of all transactions. Besides, the block header mainly
    includes four small parts, including hash value, Merkle root, nonce value and
    timestamp. A typical blockchain structure is illustrated in Fig. 5. - Distributed
    ledger (database): Distributed ledger is a kind of database that is replicated
    over all network participants. It records and stores transactions which are created
    by users and ensured consensus among utilities by the mining process (i.e. Proof
    of Work). In the distributed ledger, each record contains a unique cryptographic
    signature decoupled with a timestamp which makes the ledger resistant to be modified.
    - Consensus algorithms: The process of transacting the block over the chain should
    not be controlled by any entity so that each block is managed by all participants
    with equal rights to avoid security issues, i.e. double-spending attacks (Zhang
    and Lee, 2019). This can be done by a mechanism called consensus. From the view
    of blockchain, the consensus process mainly provides a guarantee for agreement
    on each data blockchain among entities. For instance, Bitcoin uses Proof of Work
    algorithm (PoW) (Nakamoto et al.) as a main consensus scheme for its transaction
    management. The nodes with high computational capability can join the mining process
    and compete each other to be a first one to verify the block. In return, the winner
    can receive a certain amount of coin as the reward for its mining effort. Along
    with the advance of blockchain, there are some new consensus algorithms such as
    Proof-of-stake (PoS), Byzantine Faulty Tolerant (BFT). More information of these
    mechanisms can be found in Christidis and DevetsikIoTis (2016) and Wang et al.
    (2019a). - Smart contracts: A smart contract is a self-executing application running
    on top of blockchain. Since the first smart contract of Ethereum platform (Christidis
    and DevetsikIoTis, 2016) was created in 2015, this technology has experienced
    a fast growth. Smart contracts are capable of execute clauses predefined in the
    contract in an automatic manner. The users can execute the smart contract by sending
    a transaction or message to it. Besides, running smart contracts costs a certain
    amount of coin (i.e. gas in Ethereum blockchain). No any entities can alter or
    change the rules defined in the smart contract, and the operation of contract
    does not depend on any third party. These features ensures high resistance to
    external attacks (Liu and Liu, 2019). Based on its interesting characteristics,
    smart contracts have been used widely in various applications, such as money transfer,
    healthcare data sharing, supply chain management (Rouhani and Deters, 2019a).
    While such features can bring benefits, it also poses a legal and regulatory challenge
    if there is no central party that is responsible and can be held accountable.
    In a public blockchain system, it will be important to consider what law might
    apply to transactions and what appropriate risk management should be put into
    place. However, with a permissioned blockchain system, it is easier to create
    some forms of legal schemes and internal governance models that will dictate the
    governing law for blockchain transactions. In private blockchain systems, it would
    also be essential to take advantage of some form of agreed dispute resolution
    processes. Specially, we also consider legal issues about content and executions
    of smart contracts, programmed software running on blockchain (Christidis and
    DevetsikIoTis, 2016), such as problems with copyright infringement and defamation.
    Blockchain proponents contend that it could disrupt the entire banking industry
    as well as industrial applications. Nowadays, many companies are collaborating
    together to implement and apply distributed blockchain ledger technologies to
    global financial markets, which could bring huge economic impacts on every corner
    of businesses and social activities (Tschorsch and Scheuermann, 2016). 2.1.2.
    Main characteristics of blockchain We describe some key characteristics of blockchain
    and show its benefits to 5G networks. Immutability: It is the capability of a
    blockchain ledger to ensure that transaction data is unchangeable once it is stored
    on blockchain. This is because each block is hashed and linked with other blocks
    in a way any entities are unable to break the chain and modify the content of
    each block. Further, thanks to the consensus mechanism governed by the miners,
    each block is verified and appended immutably to the chain. The conjunction of
    block establishment concept and mining makes the chain data strongly immutable
    and unalterable. This property of blockchain supports secure data storage and
    sharing in 5G scenarios, i.e. secure spectrum sharing, D2D communication or privacy-preserved
    network virtualization. Further, by deploying immutable transaction ledgers, the
    network operators can establish secure communications to perform heterogeneous
    networking and computing, such as large-scale IoT collaborations or mobile edge/cloud
    computing over the trustless IoT environments. Decentralization: Decentralization
    means that the blockchain does not depend on a signal entity or a central authority
    for managing the database. Blockchain employs consensus mechanisms such as PoW
    to create a secure chain of blocks and maintain the security of the database without
    the need of external control points. This important feature enables building the
    database platform with high immutability and robustness associated with low latency
    in data retrieval. Transparency: The transparency of a blockchain stems from the
    fact that all information of transactions on blockchains (i.e. permission-less
    ones) is viewable to all entities. In other words, the copy of data records replicates
    over the network of participants for public validation. By this way, each entity
    can contribute their power to verify the transactions based on their functionalities
    (i.e. mining for miners and metadata checking for slight nodes). The corporation
    of all nodes helps achieve a transparency within the blockchain network, which
    in return enhance data integrity. This feature is particularly suitable for 5G
    ecosystems where the openness and fairness are required. In the cooperative network
    slicing, for instance, the blockchains can offer transparent ledger solutions
    to support open and secure data delivery and payment such that the resource providers
    and slice customers can trace and monitor transactions. Moreover, service trading
    applications (i.e. mobile resource trading in 5G IoT) can be performed automatically
    on blockchain by triggering smart contracts, which ensures transparent and reliable
    data exchange among different service providers and IoT users. Security and privacy:
    Security of blockchain can be achieved by the utilization of private and public
    keys. The key concept behind blockchain security is the adoption of asymmetric
    cryptography which provide random strings for key creation so that attackers are
    unable to breach transactions (Yu et al., 2018a). Besides, the nature of immutability
    and consensus ensures privacy for database stored in the blockchain. Each user
    can verify and keep track of their data over the network. Data stored inside the
    block is preserved by data leakage bottlenecks through hashing concept and mining
    process. Table 3 presents the mapping of the blockchain characteristics with the
    potential applications in 5G networks. Each feature would enhance the quality
    of 5G systems from the performance and security perspectives which show the great
    potential of using blockchain in 5G. Recently, some projects have been implemented
    towards the integration of blockchain into 5G systems via real-world case studies.
    China''s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) has launched a
    national blockchain-5G project that allows the majority of blockchain mobile phone
    manufacturers such as China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom to deploy blockchain
    on existing 5G platforms in the large cities across the country. Very recently,
    the 5G China Unicorn company has recently partnered with a blockchain company
    Wanxiang Blockchain, to combine the two technologies for IoT supply chain (Chinese
    Telecom Giants Cite Blockchain as the Enabler for the Roll Out of 5G). The blockchain
    application ecosystem in this project intends to solve major issues in operating
    5G mobile networks, including fraud, harassment, loss of data and crimes related
    to identity theft. Korea Telecom also announces secure IoT, 5G blockchain projects
    (Korea Telecom announces secure IoT and 5G blockchain projects). The projects
    include a 5G blockchain network called GiGA Chain, a blockchain to secure IoT
    devices, a Blockchain as a Service offering and a local currency platform. The
    company also plans to use blockchain for IoT security market with its eye on connected
    cars and smart factories. It also works with existing systems with plans to enable
    blockchain on the 5G network. Table 3. Main characteristics of blockchain and
    their potentials to 5G. Key characteristics of blockchain Description Potential
    applications to 5G networks and services Decentralization No central authority
    or trusted third party is needed to perform transactions. Users have full control
    on their own data. Eliminate the need of trusted external authorities in 5G ecosystems,
    i.e. spectrum licenses, band managers, and database managers in spectrum management;
    central cloud/edge service manager in mobile computing and D2D networks; UAV control
    centre in 5G UAV networks; and complex cryptographic primitives in 5G IoT systems.
    Decentralizing 5G networks potentially eliminates single-point failures, ensures
    data availability and enhance service delivery efficiency. Immutability It is
    very difficult to modify or change the data recorded in the blockchain. Enable
    high immutability for 5G services. Spectrum sharing, data sharing, virtualized
    network resource provisions, resource trading can be recorded immutably into the
    only-appended blockchain. Besides, D2D communications, ubiquitous IoT networking
    and large-scale human-centric interconnections can be achieved via peer-to-peer
    networks of ubiquitous blockchain nodes without being modified or changed. The
    high immutability is very useful for 5G networks to performing accounting tasks,
    i.e. immutable database sharing, service transparency, secure user behaviour monitoring.
    Transparency All information of transactions on blockchain (i.e. public ledgers)
    can be viewable to all network participants. Provide better localized visibility
    into 5G service usage. The same copy of records of blockchain spreads across a
    large network for public verifiability. This enables service providers and users
    to fully check and monitor transactions with equal rights. Also, blockchains potentially
    offer transparent ledger solutions for truly open 5G architectures (i.e. decentralized
    network virtualization, distributed edge computing, distributed IoT networks).
    Blockchain ledgers also support fair service trading applications (i.e. resource
    trading, payment) under the control of all network entities. Persistency All data
    stored in the blockchain would be verified its correction to detect modifications
    or malicious behaviours. Provide better persistency for 5G services. Transactions
    created from activities of spectrum sharing, data sharing, virtualized network
    resource provision are recorded and verified by all network operators and users.
    It also enhances the reliability of 5G IoT communications thanks to the ability
    of malicious access detection by using blockchain ledger. Auditability Any information
    and data is audited and traced once uploading to the blockchain. Enable network
    operators keep track of 5G services and operations over the wireless network.
    It also provide an equal right to the users to audit the 5G data over the network
    to strengthen the roles of mobile users in the 5G ecosystem. Security and privacy
    Blockchain employs asymmetric cryptography for security with high authentication,
    integrity, and nonrepudiation. Smart contracts available on blockchain can support
    data auditability and access control for privacy. Provide high security for 5G
    networks involved in decentralized ledgers. Blockchain helps secure the 5G networks
    by providing distributed trust models with high access authentication, in turn
    enabling 5G systems to protect themselves and ensure data privacy. By storing
    data information (i.e. IoT metadata) across a network of computers, the task of
    compromising data becomes much more difficult for hackers. Besides, smart contracts,
    as trustless third parties, potentially support 5G services, such as data authentication,
    user verification, and preservation of 5G resource against attacks. 2.2. 5G networks
    In this subsection, we present an overview of the 5G networks. Also, 5G design
    principles are highlighted to provide insights into integrating blockchain in
    future networks and services. 2.2.1. Overview of 5G networks Over the past few
    decades, the world has seen a steady development of communication networks, initializing
    from the first generation and moving towards the fourth generation. The global
    communication traffic has shown a drastic increase in recent years and is expected
    to continue, which triggers the appearance of the forthcoming generation of telecommunication
    networks, namely 5G, aiming to address the limitations of previous cellular standards
    and scope with such ever-increasing network capacity. The 5G network can outperform
    earlier versions of wireless communication technology and provide diverse service
    abilities as well as encourage full networking among countries globally (Andrews
    et al., 2014; Costanzo and Masotti, 2017). The advances in 5G communication are
    envisioned as opening up new applications in various domains with great impacts
    on nearly aspects of our life, such as IoT (Akpakwu et al., 2017), smart healthcare
    (Ahad et al., 2019a), vehicular networks (Garcia-Roger et al., 2019), smart grid
    (Dragičević et al., 2019a), smart city (Usman et al., 2018). Particularly, according
    to 3GPP and IMT-2020 vision (Feasibility study on new services and markets technology
    enablers, 2016; ITU - RM.2083-0, 2015), the 5G technology is able to provide the
    following key capabilities: • Provide 1-10Gbps connections for the field and can
    reach up to 20 Gbps in certain scenarios. • Provide ultra-low latency services
    (1 ms or less than 1 ms). • Achieve high mobility, up to 500 km/h. • Enable Perception
    of 99.999% availability and 90% reduction in network energy usage. • Enable 10-100x
    number of connected devices with the ability to achieve 10-year battery life.
    • Enable 1000x band-width/unit area. In order to achieve such promising performance
    targets, the 5G networks leverage a number of underlying technologies, such as
    cloud/edge computing, Network functions virtualization (NFV), network slicing,
    Device-to-Device Communications, Millimeter wave communication (Gupta and Jha,
    2015). • Cloud/edge computing: Cloud computing has been introduced to meet the
    increasing demands for resource management, data storage, and mobile sensing in
    the 5G era. In specific, cloud computing paradigms with resourceful virtual computation
    centers can well support 5G services such as mobility/network management, resource
    offloading, and sensing services in various application domains (Khan et al.,
    2013). Meanwhile, as an extended version of cloud computing, edge computing has
    been regarded as the promising technology to empower 5G ecosystems. It provides
    computing services at the edge of the mobile network, which enables computation
    and storage services with much lower transmission delays. • Network functions
    virtualization (NFV): In network functions virtualization, it is possible to run
    the different network functions purely using software. NFV enables decoupling
    the network functions from proprietary hardware appliances so that they can operate
    using standardized hardware (Gupta and Jha, 2015). The key purpose of NFV is to
    transform the way networks are built and services are delivered. With NFV, any
    5G service operators can simplify a wide array of network functions, as well as
    maximize efficiencies and offer new revenue-generating services faster and easier
    than ever before (Gupta and Jha, 2015). • Network slicing: Network slicing is
    a kind of virtual networking architecture which allows to create multiple virtual
    networks on top of the physical network infrastructure. By integrating with NFV,
    network slicing provides virtual applications which can directly deployed on each
    slice so that services can be instantly provided to the users. As a result, mobile
    applications running on slices can exhibit low-latency services with specific
    service provisions, which provide high quality of user experience. • Device-to-Device
    (D2D) communication: It allows IoT devices in close proximity to communicate together
    using a direct link rather than long signal transmissions via traditional base
    stations. By using D2D communication, 5G heterogeneous data can be transferred
    quickly between mobile devices in short range, which promises ultra-low latency
    for communication among users. Moreover, D2D connectivity will make 5G operators
    more flexible in terms of offloading traffic from the core network, improve spectral
    efficiency and eliminate unnecessary energy loss due to long data transmissions
    (Kar and Sanyal, 2018). • Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication: The mmWave communication
    technology gives new facilities with a tremendous amount of spectrum to 5G mobile
    communication networks to supply mobile data demands. It comes with a number of
    benefits including huge bandwidth, narrow beam, and strong data access ability
    to overcome shortcomings caused by the explosive growth in mobile traffic volumes,
    unprecedented connected devices, and diversified use cases (Wang et al., 2018a).
    In the 5G networks, these above technologies will be used to meet the demands
    of diverse applications from the ongoing traffic explosion of connected devices.
    For example, the combination of cloud/edge computing and Software Defined Networking
    and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is regarded as the potential facilitators
    for flexible network deployment and operation. Moreover, the network slicing and
    D2D communication will enable ultra-reliable, affordable broadband access and
    intelligent use of network data to facilitate the optimal use of network resources
    with extremely low latency and high-speed device connection (Hossain and Hasan,
    2015; Christidis and DevetsikIoTis, 2016). The proliferation of 5G networks was
    initially shaped by the Next Generation Mobile Networks (NGMN) alliance (NGMN
    Alliance) with a 5G initiative for enabling emerging services and business demands
    with the time target of 2020 and beyond. 2.2.2. 5G design principles The rapid
    advances of new 5G technologies provide an impetus for new fundamental design
    principles toward 5G networks. The 5G design principle was outlined by the NGMN
    alliance (Agyapong et al., 2014). Specifically, 5G systems can employ software
    and virtualization to achieve the service objectives on flexibility, configurability,
    and scalability. Particularly, one of the key design concepts behind the 5G networks
    will be network slicing which separates the user and control planes and enables
    dynamic network function placement (Gupta and Jha, 2015) for a ubiquitous flexible
    and extensible infrastructure for all types of communication services on top of
    which a dynamic service and business environment can involve. The vision of 5G
    lies in providing smart services with very high data rates, extremely low network
    latency, manifold increase in base station density and capacity, and brings about
    significant improvements in the quality of services, quality of user experience,
    compared to 4G systems. It provides a convergence of pervasive broadband, sensing,
    and intelligence to establish a greater scale for the fourth industrial revolution
    that will stimulate the development of society and industrial markets. In the
    future, the 5G operation need to be simplified that can be achieved thanks to
    the support of emerging technologies including NFV with networking slices. The
    control plane empowered by potentially provides a logic control for the local
    network so that system operations and services can be monitored in a better organized
    manner. NFV implements network functions virtually through decoupling hardware
    appliances to provide virtual services, virtual edge nodes for extending the network
    functions. Meanwhile, cloud computing/cloud RAN supports unlimited data storage
    and data processing to cope with the growing IoT data traffic in 5G. The combinations
    of 5G enabling technologies promise to foster mobile networks with newly emerging
    services such as intelligent data analytics, big data processing. Specially, different
    from previous network generations (i.e. 3G/4G), 5G is promising to provide mobile
    services with extremely low latency, energy savings due to flexibility (i.e. network
    slicing and proximity of edge computing), all of which will enhance QoS of the
    network and ensure high QoE for users. 2.3. Potentials of the blockchain and 5G
    integration In this subsection, we explain the potentials behind the blockchain
    and 5G integration. 2.3.1. Definition of the integration of blockchain and 5G
    To highlight the motivation, we recall the most significant features of both technologies
    for the integration. Blockchain can provide secure 5G data services through its
    secure distributed ledger. This is enabled by some interesting features such as
    immutability, decentralization, transparency and privacy. Thus, the key points
    of blockchain here are its capabilities to support security and network management
    for 5G networks and applications. On the other side, 5G considered in this paper
    refers to the latest generation wireless networks which are envisioned to provide
    higher capacity, higher data rate, lower latency, massive device connectivity,
    enhanced end-user quality-of-experience (QoE), reduced operation cost, and consistent
    service provisioning. Therefore, the key points of 5G here are its advantages
    of providing fast and high-quality services and the need for security and networking
    improvement. Then, the motivation behind the conjunction of blockchain and 5G
    stems mainly from the promising benefits of blockchain for solving challenges
    in 5G networks in terms of security, privacy, networking and service management.
    With the help of innovative blockchain designs, 5G is expected to overcome the
    existing challenges and open up new opportunities to empower blockchain 5G-based
    services and applications. In the following, we discuss the motivation of the
    integration coming from current 5G challenges and then present opportunities brought
    from the blockchain-5G integrations. 2.3.2. Security challenges in 5G networks
    The security associated with 5G technologies has been regarded as one of the key
    requirements for 5G and beyond systems. The existing 5G technology infrastructure
    has remained unsolved challenges in terms of security, networking and computing
    performance degradation due to its centralized architecture (Agyapong et al.,
    2014). For example, edge/cloud computing models current rely on centralized service
    providers (i.e. Amazon cloud), which reveals various security bottlenecks. Indeed,
    this configuration is vulnerable to single-point failures, which bring threats
    to the availability of cloud/edge services for on-demand user access. Moreover,
    network function virtualization (NFV) and service function chaining in 5G networks,
    however, also incur new security challenges (Ahmad et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2018).
    Since end-to-end service function chains may deploy NFVs in an environment involving
    multiple cloud providers, such data transmissions can be compromised by curious
    cloud entities, leading to data leakage concerns. Furthermore, in a virtualized
    scenario, tenants often share the same cloud infrastructure. In this context,
    the possibility of attacks inside the cloud can increase, which damages the transparency
    and accountability of service providers. In NFVs, virtualization servers can run
    on virtual machines (VM) to offer specific functions to execute distinct operating
    systems such as VM migration or resource allocation using orchestration protocols.
    However, the security for the communication between the orchestrator and the physical
    machine VM manager is a real challenge. The rapid proliferation of mobile data
    traffic and the increasing user demands on 5G infrastructure also introduce new
    challenges in terms of security and performance degradation. For example, the
    increasing requirement for bandwidth-hungry applications for 5G services such
    as mobile video streaming, big data processing requires a proper 5G spectrum resource
    management strategy to avoid resource scarcity issues for ensuring continuous
    service functionalities. Therefore, spectrum sharing between mobile network operators
    (MNOs) and mobile users is necessary. However, spectrum sharing in such scenarios
    also raises security concerns and provides a central point of attacks for malicious
    users (Khan et al., 2019). A possible approach is to use certification authorities,
    providing provide certificates for cognitive radios inside each cell. Further,
    it requires greater computation complexity which increases spectrum sharing overheads
    and thus reduces the Quality of Services (QoS) of the involved system. Importantly,
    the use of such centralized architectures also adds single-of-failure bottlenecks
    when the authority is attacked or out of services, which leads to the disruption
    of the entire spectrum sharing network. In the 5G IoT scenarios such as smart
    healthcare, smart cities where mobile environments are highly dynamic with the
    conjunction of IoT devices, complex networks and ubiquitous services, security
    and privacy issues become much more complex to be solved (Wong, 2017). In fact,
    a prohibitively large amount of IoT data will be generated continuously from ubiquitous
    IoT sensor devices. It is very difficult to immediately identify the objects of
    interest or detect malicious actions from thousands of data transactions on a
    large scale. The solution of using a centralized management may be infeasible
    to such use cases due to long latency, privacy risks due to curious third parties
    and network congestion. Obviously, how to provide efficient mobile services (i.e.
    data sharing, data processing, user management) in terms of low latency and increased
    network throughput while still ensure high degrees of security is a critical challenge.
    Therefore, there are urgent needs of innovative solutions to overcome the above
    security and network performance limitations for future 5G networks. 2.3.3. Opportunities
    brought by blockchain to 5G networks and services With its promising security
    properties, blockchain promises to provide a new set of innovative solutions for
    5G networks and services for better security, privacy, decentralization and transform
    the network management architectures for improved QoS as well as better 5G performances.
    Therefore, 5G should use the benefits of blockchain to accommodate flexibility
    and security in providing mobile network services and ubiquitous coverage. In
    short, we highlight the significant opportunities that blockchain can bring to
    5G networks and services, with a focus on three main aspects, including security
    enhancements, system performance improvements, and network simplification. 1.
    Security enhancements: Blockchain promises to enhance the security and privacy
    of 5G ecosystems, by offering many promising technical properties such as decentralization,
    privacy, immutability, traceability, and transparency. Blockchain can eliminate
    the centralized network management concept by decentralizing the network infrastructure
    where there are no third party authorities needed. As an example, the concept
    of blockchain-based cloud computing enables decentralization of cloud/edge 5G
    networks which removes centralized control at the core network and provides a
    decentralized fair agreement with blockchain consensus platform, which eliminates
    single point failure bottlenecks and improves significantly system trust. Besides,
    the security of D2D communication can be achieved by building a peer to peer network
    via blockchain, which transforms each D2D device as blockchain node to hold a
    ledge copy with the ability of verifying and monitoring transactions for better
    system transparency and reliability. Especially, different from the conventional
    database management systems which often use a centralized server to perform access
    authentication and security mechanisms, blockchain with smart contracts can implement
    decentralized user access validation by using the computing power of all legitimate
    network participants. This makes the 5G services (i.e. spectrum sharing, data
    sharing, resource allocation) strongly resistant to data modifications. Many research
    works on blockchain (Xie et al., 2019a; Yli-Huumo et al., 2016; Rabah, 2017) demonstrate
    that the blockchain adoption is beneficial to spectrum 5G management in terms
    of better verification of spectrum access with blockchain contracts, improved
    accessibility thanks to the transparency of blockchain. Moreover, the use of blockchain
    fosters scalable spectrum sharing over the peer-to-peer ledge network where spectrum
    license holders and band managers are eliminated for high trustworthiness. The
    ledger services with strong immutability from blockchain also provide a high degree
    of security and better system protection capability against DoS attacks and threats.
    Empowered by smart contracts, which provide highly flexible efficient user access
    control mechanisms via access rules and intelligent coding logics, blockchain
    potentially introduce new authentication solutions for 5G cellular networks. Instead
    of relying on external public key infrastructure, contracts can authenticate automatically
    user access, detect threats and discard malicious access from the networks in
    an autonomous manner without revealing user information. Besides, by publishing
    user data to ledger where data is signed by hash functions and appended immutably
    to blocks, blockchain platforms ensure strong data protection. Blockchain is capable
    of providing a full control of personal data when sharing over the untrusted network,
    which is unique from all traditional approaches which hinder users from tracking
    their data (Mwc barcelona 2020). 2. System performance improvements: The use of
    blockchain also potentially improves the performances of 5G systems. In comparison
    to traditional database platforms such as SQL, blockchain can provide better data
    storage and management services with low latency data retrieval. In fact, resource
    requests (i.e. data access) can be verified by decentralized blockchain nodes
    with the support of intelligent smart contracts without passing a centralized
    authority, which is promising to reduce network latency. Moreover, motivated by
    the removal of decentralization, blockchain is able to establish direct communications
    between 5G service providers and mobile users so that the management cost can
    be significantly reduced. This would provide a much more flexible and efficient
    data delivery model for 5G ecosystems but still meet stringent security requirements
    (Yli-Huumo et al., 2016). For example, blockchain can help establish secure peer-to-peer
    communication among users (i.e. in D2D communication) using the computing power
    of all participants to operate the network instead of passing a third party intermediary.
    This would potentially reduce communication latency, transaction costs, and provide
    the global accessibility for all users, all of which will enhance the overall
    system performance. Specially, even when an entity is compromised by malicious
    attacks or threats, the overall operation of the involved network is still maintained
    via consensus on distributed ledgers, which in return ensures no single-point
    failure vulnerabilities for better security. 3. Network simplification: It is
    believed that blockchain can simplify the 5G network deployments thanks to its
    decentralized architectures. Indeed, by leveraging blockchain, the mobile operators
    now can have no worries about the establishment of centralized control servers.
    The 5G service delivery can be achieved by the blockchain network where user access,
    service responses and service trading (i.e. resource trading and payment) can
    be implemented on the decentralized ledgers among network participants including
    service providers and mobile users without the need for additional management
    infrastructure (Christidis and DevetsikIoTis, 2016). Therefore, the blockchain
    adoption potentially reduces network complexity and thus saves significantly operational
    costs. Furthermore, the transactions for 5G services (i.e. data sharing, spectrum
    sharing) are controlled by the blockchain network itself where all entities hold
    the same rights to manage and maintain the network. The capability of exploiting
    internal resources from participants is also another great advantage that blockchain
    can provide to simplify the network organization and management for better user
    experience and facilitation of service transactions, especially in complex mobile
    environments in the future 5G networks (Zheng et al., 2017). 3. Blockchain for
    enabling 5G technologies Reviewing state-of-the-art literature works (Agiwal et
    al., 2016; Gupta and Jha, 2015; Hossain and Hasan, 2015), we found that blockchain
    has mainly cooperated with the key 5G enabling technologies including cloud computing,
    edge computing, Network Function Virtualization, Network Slicing, and D2D communication.
    Motivated by this, in this section, we present a review on the integration of
    blockchain and such 5G technologies. The benefits of blockchain for different
    5G use cases and applications empowered from the integration are also analysed
    in details. 3.1. Blockchain for cloud computing/cloud RAN Cloud computing has
    drawn significant attention in the last decades thanks to its unlimited resources
    of storage and computation power, which can provide on-demand, powerful and efficient
    services with minimum management efforts. Cloud computing has been investigated
    and integrated extensively with 5G networks, paving the way for the computing-intensive
    applications involving multi-dimensional massive data processing assisted by the
    cloud (Wübben et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2015). In fact, cloud computing paradigms
    provide a number of technical solutions for realizing 5G services, such as optimizing
    the communications, processing and storage processes (Carvalho et al., 2018),
    5G data content delivery and catching (Feng et al., 2016), resource allocation
    and data transmission management (Siddavaatam et al., 2019), and cloud-enabled
    small cell networking for 5G media services (Paglierani et al., 2019). Specially,
    in order to meet the ever-increasing demand of user association and resource allocation
    in cellular 5G networks, the architecture of cloud radio access networks (Cloud-RANs)
    is envisioned as an attractive model that manages the large number of small cells
    through the centralized cloud controller as baseband unit (BBU) pool (Wu et al.,
    2015). Cloud-RAN is able to offer high-speed interconnection and shared powerful
    processing to facilitate optimal multicell cooperation and collaborative radio,
    real-time cloud computing (Wang et al., 2017; Ferdouse et al., 2019), which makes
    Cloud-RAN become a promising candidate of next-generation 5G access networks.
    However, the existing cloud computing models remain unsolved challenges in terms
    of security, networking and computing performance degradation due to its centralized
    architecture. Indeed, in the 5G era, the massive data traffic outsourced from
    IoT devices to the cloud has brought about a series of new security challenges,
    such as data availability (Zhou et al., 2017), privacy management (Li et al.,
    2018a; Yang et al., 2018a), and data integrity (Zhang et al., 2019a). As an example,
    the dynamic process of 5G data to clouds and data exchange between cloud providers
    and mobile users are vulnerable to information modifications and attacks caused
    by adversaries or third parties. Even entities within the network may be curious
    about transmitted data over the sharing and unauthorized obtain personal information
    (i.e. customer data of 5G smart grid or location information of vehicles in vehicular
    networks). These issues may lead to serious data leakage bottlenecks and consequently
    damage data availability. Besides, in the conventional cloud systems, cloud resource
    providers have full control over outsourced network data (i.e. IoT data) while
    users are not aware of it and lacks the ability of tracking data after offloading
    to the cloud. This poses critical challenges on data users to perform verification
    and monitoring of data flows or usage, especially in the 5G scenarios where transparency
    among networks members is highly required to ensure fairness and openness, i.e.
    cloud service providers and slice users in cloud-based network slicing, or between
    healthcare providers and patients in cloud e-health. Recently, blockchains have
    been investigated and integrated in cloud computing to effectively address the
    above security challenges in the cloud-based 5G networks. For example, the work
    in Yang et al. (2018b) takes advantage of blockchain to develop a framework called
    BlockONet for 5G access scenarios, aiming to improve the network credibility and
    security in 5G fronthaul. Blockchain is employed to build a verification platform
    between IoT devices, BBU unit, and manufacturer, where user access information
    is stored immutably on the chain, while smart contracts are also leveraged to
    perform automatic user authentication. The benefits from the use of blockchain
    in Cloud-RAN 5G networks are twofold. First, the concept of blockchain-based Cloud-RAN
    gets rid of centralized control at the core network and offers a decentralized
    fair agreement with blockchain consensus platform, which eliminates single point
    failure bottlenecks and improves significantly system trust. Second, by applying
    a decentralized blockchain without third parties, the blockchain-based cloud-RAN
    strategy can achieve optimal resource utilization and save a large amount of signalling
    and connection costs. In the same direction, the study in Yang et al. (2017) applies
    blockchain to build a trusted authentication architecture for cloud radio access
    network (Cloud-RAN) in the 5G era. Blockchain is also integrated with cloud computing
    for 5G IoT networks. The study (Ali et al., 2018b) introduces a blockchain-based
    cloud-centric IoT scheme using smart contracts for security of data provenance.
    The use of blockchain enables secure data storage by keeping the metadata in the
    ledgers while the actual database is placed in cloud storage servers. Smart contracts
    support security properties, such as transparency and immutability for cloud data
    exchange and sharing. Meanwhile, a secure data sharing architecture was introduced
    in Zhang et al. (2018a) with an attributed based-access control system. The main
    components of the network consist of IoT devices, a data owner, a blockchain network
    and cloud computing. To manage IoT data and transactions, a permissioned blockchain
    is deployed on top of the cloud IoT so that user access can be verified and data
    usage is monitored. Similarly, a hierarchical access control scheme for cloud
    blockchain is investigated in Ma et al. (2019a) with a blockchain-empowered key
    management system. The blockchain network topology is the combination of distributed
    side blockchains running at fog nodes and a multi-blockchain hosted in the cloud,
    which would provide efficient network management and flexible storage for scalable
    cloud IoT networks. Moreover, to preserve cloud applications, a forensic investigation
    system is proposed using decentralized blockchain (Hossain et al., 2018). The
    key focus of this work is on the analysis of the security for interactions among
    cloud service providers, clients, and IoT devices. With the support of blockchain,
    data immutability checking is done in a decentralized manner with the involvement
    of all entities, therefore avoiding single points of failure on the cloud storage.
    In addition, blockchain has also incorporated with the cloud federation architectures
    to further improve the performance of complex 5G-IoT networks in terms of transparent
    collaboration and interconnected services. As an example, a blockchain framework
    was proposed on a joint cloud collaboration environment where multiple clouds
    are interconnected securely by peer-to-peer ledges (Chen et al., 2018a). The proposed
    scheme contains three tiers with an IoT sensor network, a federation of multiple
    clouds, and a service platform. Typically, the blockchain platform can exhibit
    superior advantages over the single cloud-based systems. For instance, since IoT
    data at each area is placed in a private cloud, its data security is improved.
    Further, the single cloud can offer instant services for IoT users thanks to a
    private blockchain, which reduces risks of attacks on cloud systems (Malomo et
    al., 2018). Besides, a cloud blockchain model with micro-clouds was introduced
    by (Freitag, 2018) using blockchain-enabled distributed ledgers. The authors pay
    special attention to building a cloud blockchain platform for decentralized collaborative
    governance services, i.e. immutable data storage, transparent monitoring and resource
    management for better performance on lightweight computing nodes like IoT devices.
    For hierarchical networking in 5G-based cloud computing, the work in Yang et al.
    (2019b) proposes a hierarchical trust networking architecture based on permissioned
    blockchain to implement JointCloud (HTJC). This research aims to solve some critical
    limitations in cloud-based IoT networks, namely trust, privacy leakage, and weak
    security of IoT devices. This can be done by introducing a trust hierarchy model
    that builds a secure credit-based trading environment using blockchain. In this
    context, the trading requires credits to ensure that the members of network can
    maintain normal behaviour rather than engage in malicious behaviors. Besides,
    a mechanism of rewards and punishments empowered by credits is designed to manage
    the members of network based on credits for security and trust guarantees. 3.2.
    Blockchain for mobile edge computing As an extension of cloud computing, mobile
    edge computing (MEC) is a promising technology for supporting 5G services. Edge
    computing, located at the edge of the network, can provide low-latency services
    for mobile users. (Taleb et al., 2017a). The distributed structure of edge computing
    has the potentials to enabling ubiquitous computing provisions, scalability improvement
    and simplification of network management to cope with the explosion of IoT devices
    and rapid growth of 5G service demands (Pham et al., 2019). However, its security
    is a significant challenge (Mukherjee et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018b). Indeed,
    the migration of 5G services, i.e. data computation, in the dynamic edge computing
    environments can be vulnerable to malicious attacks (such as jamming attacks,
    sniffer attacks, denial-of-service attacks, etc.). Further, the setting and configuration
    information by the edge service providers (ESP) must be trustworthy and secure,
    but in fact these are actually challenged due to the high dynamism and openness
    of the MEC system. Another challenge is to ensure data privacy and immutability
    for outsourced 5G heterogeneous data from external modifications or alternations.
    Importantly, how to avoid the system disruption caused by the attack on an edge
    node in the multi-edge computing (Mukherjee et al., 2017) is of paramount importance
    for 5G-based edge computing networks. Fortunately, blockchain has come as a promising
    technical enabler to overcome most of security and networking challenges faced
    by the existing edge computing architectures. The same decentralization characteristic
    of both the blockchain and MEC built on the networking, storage, computation,
    communications makes their combination become natural. The recent research results
    have demonstrated that blockchain can be applied to the edge computing systems
    to support a number of services of security and management in edge computing (Stanciu,
    2017). Generally, the blockchains can support edge computing-based 5G services
    in three main aspects: networking, storage and computation as shown in Fig. 6.

    to build a distributed and trusted authentication system to realize reliable authentication
    and information sharing among different edge-based IoT platforms. In the system,
    authentication data and user access information can be stored securely on blockchain,
    which is also capable of automatically tracking activities of mobile terminals
    (devices) without the need of central authorities. In particular, smart contracts
    are also utilized to perform trusted content catching in the edge computing network.
    Meanwhile, the works in Liu et al. (2018a) and Li et al. (2018d) suggest a blockchain-based
    architecture for vehicular edge computing. Vehicular edge computing is introduced
    to provide data processing services with low latency, but it also raises privacy
    concerns since user information can be disclosed during the sharing process. The
    adaption of blockchain potentially solves such challenges by establishing a secure
    communication channel empowered by immutable transaction ledgers. Then, this robust
    and secure concept enables the energy flow and information flow to be protected
    against external malicious attacks when performing vehicular networking. Furthermore,
    ensuring security in the transmission process is one of the achievements of blockchain.
    The authors in Gai et al. (2019c) and Wang et al. (2019g) take advantage of blockchain
    to establish a security mechanism for edge computing-based energy systems where
    smart contracts are leveraged to build a trusted access control scheme for energy
    sharing and distribution. Further, the blockchain-based solutions can support
    efficient conditional anonymity and key management for the privacy-preserving
    authentication protocol without the need for other complex cryptographic primitives
    between network users. Moreover, to achieve a trustworthy and efficient edge computing
    system, the blockchain functionality is applied to the resource management (Qiao
    et al., 2019), data sharing (Zheng et al., 2018a) or resource allocation (Xia
    et al., 2018a), all of which improve edge computing performances while guaranteeing
    security properties of the network. In addition, blockchain also provides security
    features for efficient data storage for edge computing systems. Indeed, blockchain
    can offer decentralized data storage enabled by the combined storage capacity
    of a network of peers to store and share contents. The work in Rahman et al. (2019)
    proposes a MEC-based sharing economy system by using the blockchain and off-chain
    framework to store immutable ledgers. Specifically, in a smart vehicular network,
    blockchain can keep information of the driver and the car profile with the history
    of maintenance, accident, and other car usage information. The raw vehicular data,
    i.e. vehicle sensor data, can be captured and processed by the MEC node under
    the control of the blockchain. The work in Kotobi and Sartipi (2018a) also proposes
    a blockchain database to secure communication between the home devices and sensors
    in the MEC-based smart city. In the sense of the ledger, blockchain can be regarded
    as a distributed database which keeps data by interconnecting a network of strongly
    immutable blocks. It is noting that the scalability of blockchain is a critical
    challenge due to the constrained ledger size, throughput and latency (Stanciu,
    2017). In this regard, the on-chain and off-chain storage concept can be very
    useful. For example, in the vehicle context, the real-time updates regarding traffic
    information can be placed locally in a cache unit, while data hash values can
    be kept securely in blockchain. Any modifications on the storage unit can be acknowledged
    by blockchain via decentralized ledgers, improving the trustworthiness of the
    MEC-based network. Moreover, to facilitate easy access to data in a distrusted
    MEC blockchain setting, a decentralized big data repository platform, such as
    Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS) can be necessary for improving storage capability
    on blockchain (Jayasinghe et al., 2019). On top of IPFS, several blockchain-based
    storage platforms such as Filecoin or Storij (Ali et al., 2018a) have been applied
    as an incentive layer to form an entirely distributed file storage system. These
    blockchain database systems contain the off-chain service data while providing
    the on-chain identifier, so that data integrity can be checked by the identifier
    from the data and hash values in the blockchain and comparing it for monitoring.
    Such a blockchain platform is integrated with edge computing to solve storage
    risks caused by dynamic MEC (Confais et al., 2017). Moreover, the potential of
    blockchain for MEC collaboration has been also investigated recently. The authors
    in Yang et al. (2020) introduce a distributed blockchain-based trusted MEC collaboration
    (BlockTC) architecture that is able to enable cross-domain collaboration among
    multiple MEC servers verification. The proposed BlockTC achieves multi-server
    trusted routing and privacy protection with three main features, including a backup
    dual-link that supports maintenance and verification of MEC collaboration routing
    without exposing privacy across the network; distributed ledger that ensures data
    consistency over the MEC network, and collaboration routing consensus that verifies
    the routing among MEC servers. The experiment shows good performances in terms
    of low mistrust rate, efficient resource utilization, low path provisioning latency,
    and low error detection latency. Lastly, blockchain can support the computation
    processes in MEC networks. Specifically, blockchain can provide authentication
    capability to protect MEC systems. The study in Tang et al. (2018) leverages blockchain
    features such as decentralization, tamper-proofing and consistency to build an
    authentication layer between edge/fog servers and IoT devices. The main objective
    is to monitor and verify all computing tasks offloaded to the MEC servers, which
    preserves edge computing from external attacks. In Liu et al. (2019e), smart contracts
    are employed for MEC to improve the efficiency of IoT computing, i.e. video coding,
    by providing a self-organized video transcoding and delivery service without a
    centralized authentication. Blockchain can protect the accuracy, consistency,
    and origins of the data files in a transparent way. Further, the transactional
    data are also encrypted and stored on blocks, which has the potential to achieve
    privacy and security for MEC (Xiong et al., 2018a). 3.3. Blockchain for network
    function virtualization (NFV) Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) is a network
    architecture concept, standardized by the European Telecommunications Standards
    Institute (ETSI) that employs standard hardware for hosting various independent
    and network software components (Yousaf et al., 2017). Basically, NFV includes
    three main architectural components, namely Network Function Virtualization Infrastructure
    (NFVI) which supports the execution of VNFs, Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs)
    that are the functions running on the NFVI, and Management and Network Orchestration
    (MANO) which cover the lifecycle management and orchestration of physical and
    software resources (Mijumbi et al., 2015). By decoupling hardware appliances,
    the network operators can save significantly equipment costs and reduce operational
    expenditures as well as automate network operation tasks without concerning about
    hardware installation. Particularly, NFV envisions to provide a diverse number
    of benefits for 5G networks, including enhancing flexibility and scalability of
    NF deployments and connections thanks to the decoupling of software from hardware,
    optimizing resource provision of the VNFs for better cost and energy usage, and
    optimizing VNFs operations with maximum failure rate and tolerable unplanned packet
    loss (Abdelwahab et al., 2016). Network function virtualization and service function
    chaining, however, also incur new security challenges (Farris et al., 2018; Alwakeel
    et al., 2018). Since end-to-end service function chains may deploy NFVs in an
    environment involving multiple cloud providers, such data transmissions can be
    compromised by curious cloud entities, leading to data leakage concerns. Furthermore,
    in a virtualized scenario, tenants often share the same cloud infrastructure.
    In this context, the possibility of attacks inside the cloud can increase, which
    damage the transparency and accountability of service providers. In NFVs, virtualization
    servers can run on virtual machines (VM) to offer specific functions to execute
    distinct operating systems such as VM migration or resource allocation using orchestration
    protocols. However, the security for the communication between the orchestrator
    and the physical machines is a current challenge. In fact, these architectures
    are very sensitive to attacks that can come from different horizons. In fact,
    a VM can be created by an attacker to run in a server and leveraged to carry out
    external denial-of-service attacks. Besides, internal attacks from curious VMs
    are another concern which can adversely impact data integrity and confidentiality
    (Reynaud et al., 2016). In such a context, the blockchain technology has emerged
    as an efficient tool to help with these challenges. With the authenticity, integrity
    and non-repudiation natures, blockchain can facilitate NFV networks in three main
    aspects (Ak and Canberk, 2019; Providing a Sliced, Secure, and Isolated Software
    Infrastructure of Virtual Functions Through Blockchain Technology). First, blockchain
    can enable reliable, easy and flexible orchestration of VNF services for better
    orchestration and network management. Second, blockchain can secure delivery of
    network functions and ensure system integrity against both insider attacks and
    external threats, i.e. malicious VM modifications and DoS attacks. Final, blockchain
    can perform data auditing and monitoring of system state during the network communication.
    We here review the latest advances in the use of blockchain to solve the above
    challenges for NFVs in 5G scenarios. The authors of Rebello et al. (2019a) propose
    a blockchain-based system called BSec-NFVO for secure management of service function
    chain orchestration operations in the Open Platform for Network Function Virtualization
    (OPNFV). A Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus protocol is employed
    to prevent collusion attacks without compromising latency and throughput. The
    architecture of BSec-NFVO is depicted in Fig. 7, consisting of three main modules:
    the visualization module, which provides an interface between tenants and the
    NFV and Service Function Chaining (SFC) services; the orchestration module, which
    executes instructions transmitted by tenants via the visualization module; and
    lastly the blockchain module that verifies and confirms transactions before execution
    by the orchestration module. By immutably logging all instructions enabled by
    blockchain, the proposed scheme can ensure authenticity, integrity and non-repudiation
    of instructions, which also provide data provenance for multi-domain NFV environments.

    Fig. 7. The conceptual blockchain-based NFV architecture. The work in Bozic et
    al. (2017) builds a blockchain-based Virtual Machine Orchestration Authentication
    (VMOA) framework to secure NFV/cloud orchestration operations for better authentication
    of orchestration commands in the lifecycle of cloud services. Here, blockchain
    acts as a decentralized database ledger shared between the virtualization server,
    the orchestrator and VM agents. The virtualization server is able to authenticate
    the orchestration command via blockchain VMOA ledger in an immutable and secure
    manner. Due to the removing of the requirement of third parties in the VMOA and
    using security features of blockchain, the proposed solution potentially achieves
    superior advantages such as records integrity, fault tolerance, and network trustworthiness,
    compared to its centralized counterparts. Additionally, to realize a faulty or
    compromised VNF configuration, the study in Rebello et al. (2019b) introduces
    a blockchain-based architecture to provide auditability to orchestration operations
    of network slices for securing VNF configuration updates. The prototype implements
    two smart contracts with specific transaction formats for safeguarding network
    slice management and VNF configuration operations. Especially, a Hyperledger Fabric
    blockchain platform associated with certificate authorities is integrated to manage
    digital certificates of every node, improving auditability and that only certified
    and authorized nodes participate in the blockchain-based NFV network. The authors
    of Franco et al. (2019) introduce a scheme called BRAIN, a Blockchain-based Reverse
    Auction solution for Infrastructure supply in NFV scenarios for dealing with challenges
    of discovery and selection of infrastructures to host VNFs acquired by end users.
    Smart contracts are designed to achieve a trustworthy agreement between stakeholders
    such as users and infrastructure providers regarding resources contracted and
    configurations required. Meanwhile, to support efficiency and security in wireless
    virtualization, blockchain is proposed in Rawat (2019) to improve the trust and
    transparency among participants and stakeholders and enable more seamless and
    dynamic exchange of spectrum and computing resources in the 5G wireless networks.
    Another work (Alvarenga et al., 2018) presents a blockchain-based architecture
    for the secure configuration management of virtualized network functions (VNFs).
    The use of blockchain can provide security for VNF configuration state migration,
    building a trust mechanism between different infrastructure providers (tenants)
    and VNF vendors. Asymmetric keys are employed to develop a transaction model for
    building anonymous authentication of tenants and VNFs and gaining confidentiality
    of configuration data through encryption. Such transactions are then appended
    in the blockchain data structure which also gives traceability and accountability
    of the VNF configuration updates. Meanwhile, to realize the orchestration/management
    capabilities and business support systems in the context of architectural NFV,
    the research in Rosa and Rothenberg (2018) analyses blockchain-based Decentralized
    Applications (DApps) in support of multi-administrative domain networking. Blockchain
    can be an effective approach to establish an authentication layer for NFV Management
    and Orchestration (MANO) services across administrative domains. For example,
    blockchain can verify user access and grant access permission to resources between
    providers NFV-MANO components. In such a context, a smart contract can be leveraged
    to store access permission and assets information for MANO components as well
    as perform mappings of the structure of quotas, access grants and capacity of
    NFV users for efficient resource usage. 3.4. Blockchain for network slicing To
    support IoT applications, 5G relies on the Network Slicing concept, which enables
    the separation of multiple virtual networks operating on the same physical hardware
    (Afolabi et al., 2018). It enables telecom operators to portion their networks
    for specific services and applications. Network slicing is well envisioned by
    Network Softwarization which includes Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) running
    in the cloud inside virtual machines or containers. A network slice consists of
    a set of VNFs coupled with physical network functions to enable network services
    using cloud infrastructure (Zhang, 2019). Besides, network slicing also brings
    many unprecedented security challenges which consist of inter-slice security threats
    and the issues of resource harmonization between inter-domain slice segments (Kaloxylos,
    2018; Foukas et al., 2017). For example, due to the design of network slice instances
    sharing on open cloud-based architectures, attackers may abuse the elasticity
    of one slice to use the resources of other slices, which leads to the resource
    shortage of the target slice. Further, since multiple slices have often common
    control plane functions, attackers can exploit this network weakness to compromise
    the data of the target slice by maliciously accessing the common functions from
    another slice, leading to serious data leakages and damage of the system integrity
    (Zhang, 2019). In such contexts, blockchains can bring great opportunities for
    the security of 5G network slicing management. Blockchain can be exploited to
    build reliable end-to-end network slices and allow network slide providers to
    manage their resources. The work of Ortega et al. (2018) uses blockchain for reliability
    of resources in vehicle-to-vehicle communications over the vehicular network slices.
    The blockchain acts as the middle-security layer between vehicles and network
    controllers (i.e. roadside equipment), which eliminates the need of installing
    additional hardware from the operator side. This not only solves trust issues
    thanks to no required external authorities but also improves significantly vehicular
    network performances with low latency and enhanced throughput. Further, the blockchain-based
    approach can allow for the dynamic control of resource reliability, and improved
    the integrity and validity of the information exchanged among vehicles in the
    untrusted vehicular environments. In order to guarantee secure and private transactions
    between the network slice provider and the resource provider for 5G services,
    blockchain is employed to build a brokering mechanism in network slicing (Nour
    et al., 2019). When a slice provider receives a request or query to establish
    an end-to-end slice, it submits this request to blockchain for tracking and sharing.
    To support the deployment of the sub-slice components, smart contracts are designed,
    called as slice smart contracts (SSCs), where each SSC specifies the essential
    resources needed by the sub-slice. In this way, the resource providers can perform
    resource trading on contracts with sub-slice components. All related information
    about the sub-slice deployment is immutably recorded and stored in a permissioned
    blockchain controlled by the slice provider. The proposed blockchain-based broker
    not only adds security abilities, but also supports privacy and accountability
    in network slicing. The authors in Backman et al. (2017) consider a blockchain
    slice leasing ledger concept using the 5G network slice broker in a blockchain
    to reduce service creation time and enable autonomous and dynamic manufacturing
    process. The works in Valtanen et al. (2018, 2019) also present how the blockchain
    technology can support the resource configuration value creation micro-processes
    and the 5G network slice broker use case in industrial automation use and smart
    grid. Manufacturing equipment leases independently the network slice needed for
    operations on-demand, approve service-level agreement (SLA) and pay for the service
    fee based on actual usage. In this context, blockchain performs the network slice
    trading, while smart contract orders slice orchestration based on agreed SLA from
    a slice broker. In an effort to virtualize the slicing network, the authors in
    Rawat and Alshaikhi (2018) propose a blockchain based wireless virtualization
    architecture where wireless resources such as RF channels are sliced into multiple
    (time/frequency) slices for mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs). Each transaction
    in blockchain for wireless virtualization contains information of bandwidth allocation,
    maximum channel power, and data rate which are used by the MVNOs when serving
    their users, and such a transaction is recorded immutably in the block for sharing.
    The blockchain based distributed scheme creates new MVNOs securely without revealing
    their private information to the public. Similarly, the work in Adhikari et al.
    (2019) also proposes a blockchain-based wireless network virtualization approach
    to optimally allocate wireless resources for wireless network virtualization where
    the blockchain technology helps Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs) to sublease
    the RF slices from trustworthy Wireless Infrastructure Providers (WIPs). Blockchain
    is mainly used to build a reputation-based scheme for RF allocation of network
    slices with the objective of minimizing the extra delay caused by double-spending
    attempts in NFVs. 3.5. Blockchain for D2D communication The exponential growth
    of mobile 5G data traffic has given impetus to the demand for high network rate
    proximity services. Device-to-device (D2D) communication has been envisioned as
    an allied technology for such 5G scenarios (Jameel et al., 2018). Conceptually,
    D2D communications refers to a type of technology that enables mobile devices
    (such as smartphone, tablet, etc.) to communicate directly with each other without
    the involvement of an access point or a core network of a cellular infrastructure.
    D2D takes advantage of the proximity of device communication for efficient utilization
    of available resources, enabling to improve the overall system throughput, mitigate
    communication delays and reduce energy consumption and traffic load (Ansari et
    al., 2017). D2D communication thus can facilitate new peer-to-peer and location-based
    applications and services, making it well suitable for the next mobile 5G communication
    networks and services. However, direct communication between mobile devices also
    introduces new non-trivial challenges for D2D-based 5G networks in terms of security,
    network management and performance loss. Indeed, data sharing between devices
    may face risks of data leakage due to the malicious threats on the untrusted D2D
    environments. How to exchange mobile data to achieve low latency but ensure security
    is a critical challenge (Hamoud et al., 2017). Furthermore, D2D devices may not
    be trusted, and can obtain illegal access to resources on servers (i.e. edge/cloud
    servers) if there is no an authentication mechanism on the network. Besides, the
    existing D2D architectures rely on the external authorities to grant data permission
    and request authentication during the D2D communication, which can incur unnecessary
    communication latency and degrade the overall network performance (Wang and Yan,
    2015). Blockchain can be a good solution to help overcome such challenges to facilitate
    D2D communication in 5G networks. For example, the work in Cui et al. (2019) employs
    blockchain to build a secure content catching and sharing scheme among mobile
    devices for D2D networks. To mitigate the computation burden on devices, edge
    servers with high computing power are used to run mining puzzles for blockchain.
    In particular, blockchain demonstrates its efficiency in providing an incentive
    solution, which encourages caching-enabled users to store and share the contents
    with other mobile devices via D2D for better content sharing among mobile devices.
    The award policy empowered by blockchain stimulates the mining process in D2D
    devices, improving the robustness and security for the D2D network. In order to
    support the authenticity of channel state information (CSI) of mobile users in
    D2D underlying cellular network, blockchain is applied in Lin and Tang (2018)
    to develop a secure mechanism using a consensus protocol. The mobile users can
    verify and validate the received broadcast CSI messages through the consensus
    mechanism before signing and adding immutably to the decentralized ledgers for
    sharing and storage. The authors also suggest that the blockchain-based approach
    is potential to dramatically improve the spectral efficiency while providing efficient
    CSI authenticity services for D2D networks. Blockchain is also useful in another
    D2D scenario for supporting computation offloading (Seng et al., 2019). In this
    work, a decentralized computation offloading coordination platform is developed
    and empowered by the blockchain which is able to manage the computation offloading
    requests and perform user matching. Each mobile user can participate in the computation
    offloading process and submit offloading requests to the blockchain platform.
    The other users in the D2D network and edge servers perform user matching to decide
    whether to participate in the offloading process to execute the requested computation
    tasks. The blockchain platform will incentivize COP which agrees to compute the
    task, and all request information is recorded and appended into blockchain for
    secure offloading management. The work in Siris et al. (2019) presents a delegated
    authorization architecture using blockchain-based smart contracts that enable
    users to use D2D communication to access IoT resources with respect to the preservation
    of the authorization information and network trust. Blockchains can immutably
    record hashes of the information exchanged during user authorization and payment
    events, while smart contracts can support for the concatenation of authorization
    requests. Here, smart contracts are placed on blockchain and run on all ledger
    nodes so that the resource access from D2D users can be handled automatically
    and quickly. The authentication mechanism can also protect network resource against
    DoS attacks that involve a very high resource request rate. The authors in the
    works (Liu et al., 2018b, 2018f) integrate blockchain with D2D communication to
    support the computation and offloading of the mobile data tasks as Fig. 8. With
    the trust and traceability features of the blockchain, a decentralized incentive
    approach is introduced to foster the collaboration of content creators and D2D
    users without the intervention of any third party. Mobile data can be transferred
    securely over the D2D network via blockchain ledgers, and computation offloading
    and content caching can be performed by edger servers for efficient execution.

    Fig. 8. Blockchain for supporting D2D computation (Liu et al., 2018b). In Feng
    et al. (2018a), a consortium blockchain is considered for further security and
    efficiency in the feature extraction application for encrypted images in D2D systems.
    Smart contracts are stored in blockchain, which solves the privacy leaking problem
    of image features. In a different direction, the study (Niya et al., 2018) exploits
    blockchain and smart contracts for the design and implementation of a trading
    application between the seller and the buyer via D2D communication. The trading
    can be performed automatically on blockchain by triggering the contract, which
    ensures transparent and reliable data exchange among different users. Moreover,
    to build a distributed secure monitoring system in D2D systems, blockchain is
    also considered in Yang et al. (2018c) to provide a high level of security with
    reduced computational and communication costs. In particular, a secure access
    control using blockchain is also integrated to support identity authentication
    in a lightweight and scalable manner. In summary, blockchain brings numerous opportunities
    to support 5G technologies and provides emerging services for 5G systems. Reviewing
    the state of the art works, we find that blockchain can provide security, networking
    solutions to protect 5G services and improve the performance of 5G-based systems.
    In the next section, we will present a systematic analysis and survey on the benefits
    of blockchain in a number of 5G services. We list blockchain use cases in the
    taxonomy Table 4 to summarize the key contributions of each reference work. Table

    offer tremendous potential for improving existing 5G services and applications
    by supporting 5G technologies as discussed in the previous section. This vision
    can be achieved by taking advantage of interesting features that blockchains offer
    such as decentralization, privacy, immutability, and traceability. Blockchain
    can be regarded as a natural choice to facilitate the next-generation mobile communication
    networks for better 5G services. In this section, we provide an extensive discussion
    on the use of blockchain for important 5G services, including spectrum management,
    data sharing, network virtualization, resource management, interference management,
    federated learning, privacy and security services. 4.1. Spectrum management With
    the increasing demand for bandwidth-hungry applications for 5G services such as
    mobile video streaming, big data processing, a foreseen network capacity shortage
    has become a key threat to mobile network operators (MNOs). Despite the technological
    achievements of 5G networks, the physical constraints such as spectrum limitations
    are still major limiting factors, which prevent operators from scaling their services
    properly. Spectrum scarcity in wireless networks hinders the fast improvement
    of throughput and service quality. Operators are forced to invest a large amount
    of money in their infrastructure to optimize the capacity by network densification
    and higher frequency reuse factors. Currently, MNOs have to face the challenges
    from the unavailability of useable frequency resources caused by spectrum fragmentation
    and the current fixed allocation policy, which prevents from meeting the requirements
    of the expanding market of wireless broadband and multimedia users (Sharma et
    al., 2017a). To deal with the desire of mobile users to be connected at all times,
    anywhere, and for any application, more spectrum bandwidth and/or more efficient
    usage of that bandwidth is urgently needed. Some solutions have been proposed,
    including the fixed spectrum allocation strategies, but these approaches are inefficient
    in terms of wasteful spectrum usage because the license holders (or primary users)
    do not continuously utilize their full spectrum allocation. One solution for addressing
    the spectrum scarcity problem in radio 5G networks is to introduce secondary users
    that opportunistically monitor the spectrum and then transmit their data whenever
    the spectrum is idle (Zhang et al., 2017). However, spectrum sharing in such scenarios
    also raises security concerns and provides a central point of attack for malicious
    users. Another approach is to use certification authorities, providing provide
    certificates for cognitive radios inside each cell. Importantly, the use of such
    centralized architectures also adds single-of-failure bottlenecks when the authority
    is attacked or out of services, which leads to the disruption of the entire spectrum
    sharing network (Hu et al., 2018). In comparison to such conventional spectrum
    management schemes, blockchain can be a much better solution to overcome the security
    and performance issues for spectrum management in 5G. Since blockchain is a form
    of decentralized database where no single party has control, blockchain can be
    applied to build spectrum sharing and management models with improved security
    and better performances, i.e. low latency and enhanced throughput. Especially,
    blockchain envisions to support spectrum management by providing the following
    benefits (Weiss et al., 2019). • Decentralization: The blockchain adoption eliminates
    the need of trusted external authorities such as spectrum licenses, band managers,
    and database managers. The inherent benefits are twofold: reducing unnecessary
    network overhead due to communicating with the authorities during the spectrum
    sharing, and improving system integrity and privacy due to no concerns about data
    leakage caused by curious third party intermediaries. • Transparency: Since all
    transactions between spectrum users and service providers are reflected and recorded
    on distributed blockchain ledgers, the blockchain-based solution is able to provide
    better localized visibility into spectrum usage. Besides, blockchain can employ
    smart contracts, a self-executing platform, to perform auditability of spectrum
    sharing activities according to the pre-defined sharing policies. • Immutability:
    The spectrum services, i.e spectrum sharing, monitoring or user payment is recorded
    to the only-appended blockchain in an immutable manner. By using consensus mechanisms
    empowered by blockchain miners, blockchain ledgers is well resistant to modifications
    caused by attacks or malicious users. This also ensures the reliability of the
    spectrum services and enhances the accuracy of the network implementation. • Availability:
    Any network participants such as mobile users can access to spectrum resources
    managed by service providers to perform spectrum sharing and payment. Moreover,
    as blockchain broadcasts all service information to all entities, the spectrum
    sharing databases are also assessable to everyone in the network. Furthermore,
    there is no central authority to verify or record the data and transactions, which
    potentially enables a more transparent system without a loss of security properties.
    • Permissionless: Because there is no single trusted entity as the central authority
    to control the network, new users or applications can be added to the overall
    system without seeking the approval of other users, providing a flexible sharing
    environment. • Security: Blockchains enable efficient communication between users
    and service providers with strong security capabilities against threats, DoS risks
    and insider attacks. In spectrum management, verification and access management
    is also of significant importance for enabling secure spectrum sharing (Kotobi
    and Bilen, 2018). In this work, blockchain can secure distributed medium-access
    protocol for cognitive radios (CRs) to lease and access available wireless channels.
    Blockchain is responsible for verifying and authenticating each spectrum-leasing
    transactions between primary and secondary users. Here, primary users are defined
    as spectrum license holders and can lease their allocated spectrum to increase
    spectrum efficiency as well as gain profits via a spectrum coin protocol. The
    blockchain performs exchanging currency, mining and updating the transactions,
    and leasing available spectrum through an auction. The authors also demonstrated
    that the blockchain adoption is beneficial to spectrum management in terms of
    better scalability, power efficiency in spectrum usage, improved accessibility
    with high degree of security and better system protection capability against DoS
    attacks and threats. The work presented in Kotobi and Bilén (2017) also describes
    a verification solution by taking advantage of blockchain for securing spectrum
    sharing in cognitive radio networks. The authors focus on building an auction
    protocol for spectrum payment services among primary users. Blockchain is regarded
    as a middle layer to perform spectrum trading, verify sharing transactions and
    lease securely the spectrum provided by a license holder. Besides, to solve the
    issues of privacy risks in spectrum sharing, a blockchain-based trustworthy framework
    called TrustSAS is presented in Grissa et al. (2019) to empower seamless spectrum
    sharing among secondary users (SUs) and incumbent users. The TrustSAS scheme relies
    on permissioned blockchains to monitor and control systems and cluster activities
    as well as tackle spectrum sharing events by using a Byzantine fault tolerant
    (BFT) consensus mechanism. All spectrum sharing transactions are validated by
    BFT and signed by blockchain miners for immutable recording on blocks. The experimental
    results show the superior advantages in terms of efficient auditability, improved
    privacy and lower end-to-end latency for spectrum access. In addition, a spectrum
    sensing platform empowered by blockchain has been proposed and referred to as
    Spectrum Sensing as a Service (Spass) (Bayhan et al., 2019; Bayhan et al., 2018),
    which provide services of spectrum sensing trading and payment. Smart contract
    acts as the core component which is responsible for scheduling spectrum sensing
    among secondary users and helpers which are the nodes offering sensing service
    in the secondary user network. Based on operation rules defined in the contract,
    smart contracts also perform access verification by using a malicious helper detection
    mechanism to identify whether a helper is honest or malicious. The proposed solution
    not only maximizes the profits of MNOs to encourage spectrum provision for user
    applications but also guarantees security requirements in an untrusted and decentralized
    spectrum sharing setting. One of the biggest problems for unlicensed spectrum
    utilization is the unfair competition between MNOs for the utilization of unlicensed
    spectrum resources which are free to use and quite often available. To cope with
    this challenge, the authors of Maksymyuk et al. (2019) introduce a new unlicensed
    spectrum sharing among MNOs on blockchain. For this purpose, authors use smart
    contracts in conjunction with virtual cryptocurrency to develop a coalitional
    spectrum sharing game for optimizing spectrum allocation. The account balance
    of each MNO can be achieved fairly through a transparent sharing enabled by smart
    contracts, aiming to mitigate the conflict between MNOs during the sharing. To
    further improve spectrum sharing for sustainability in unlicensed frequency bands,
    the work in den Hartog et al. (2019) proposes to build a brokering platform to
    facilitate the collaboration between the network stakeholders. In this context,
    blockchain is feasible to establish a secure sharing to implement automatic negotiation
    processes for spectral resources between access point (AP) operators in a reliable
    manner. Meanwhile, in the spectrum sharing environment between the aerial and
    terrestrial communication systems, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has been used
    for facilitating communication on the sky. Currently, most UAVs in the market
    operate on the unlicensed spectrum (i.e., the industrial, scientific and medical
    bands) over the untrusted environment with significant security and privacy threats
    because of untrusted broadcast features and wireless transmission of UAV networks.
    To overcome such challenges, a spectrum blockchain architecture is considered
    in Taleb et al. (2017b) to improve the spectrum sharing. To avoid wasteful spectrum
    usage in UAV network, a pricing-based incentive mechanism is proposed to encourage
    MNOs to lease their idle spectrum to a secondary UAV network to obtain some revenue
    from the UAV operators. Then, a secure spectrum sharing framework is introduced
    where blockchain uses immutable distributed ledgers to implement spectrum exchange
    while protect the sharing system from threats. The authors focus on developing
    a Stackelberg game for an optimal spectrum sharing strategy, which can maximize
    the profits of MNOs while provide security services for UAV-based networks. 4.2.
    Data sharing One of the prominent characteristics of 5G is the strong data sharing
    capability in order to cope with the increasing content demands and data usage,
    especially in the 5G IoT scenarios. According to the latest release of Cisco (Cisco
    Visual Networking Index: Forecast and Trends and 20172022 White Paper), global
    mobile data traffic on the Internet will increase sevenfold between 2017 and 2022,
    reaching 77.5 exabytes per month by 2022. The rapid increase of content delivery
    over mobile 5G networks has revealed the need for new innovative data protection
    solutions to ensure secure and efficient data sharing over the untrusted environments
    (Mollah et al., 2017). In fact, sharing data in mobile networks is highly vulnerable
    to serious data leakage risks and security threats due to data attacks (Mahmoud
    et al., 2015). Mobile users tend to use information without caring about where
    it is located and the level of reliability of the information delivery, and the
    ability to control a large scale of information over the Internet is very weak.
    Blockchain may be an answer for such data sharing challenges. Indeed, blockchain
    can provide a wide range of features to improve the efficiency of data sharing
    in the 5G era such as traceability, security, privacy, transparency, immutability
    and tamper-resistance (Fan et al., 2017). To control the user access to data resources,
    blockchain miners can check whether the requester meets the corresponding access
    control policy. Due to the decentralized architecture which enables data processing
    for user requests over the distributed nodes, the overall system latency for data
    delivery is greatly reduced and the network congestion can be eliminated, which
    improves the performance of data sharing with blockchain. The problem of secure
    storage for data sharing is considered and discussed in Li et al. (2019a). The
    authors leverage blockchain as an underlying mechanism to build a decentralized
    storage architecture called as Meta-key wherein data decryption keys are stored
    in a blockchain as part of the metadata and preserved by user private key. Proxy
    re-encryption is integrated with blockchain to realize ciphertext transformation
    for security issues such as collusion-attack during the key-sharing under untrusted
    environments. In this context, the authors in Wang et al. (2018b) study blockchain
    to develop a data storage and sharing scheme for decentralized storage systems
    on cloud. Shared data can be stored in cloud storage, while metadata such as hash
    values or user address information can be kept securely in blockchain for sharing.
    In fact, the cloud computing technology well supports data sharing services, such
    as off-chain storage to improve the throughput of blockchain-sharing (Zheng et
    al., 2018b) or data distribution over the cloud federation (Yang et al., 2018d).
    In IoT networks, data transmission has faced various challenges in terms of low
    security, high management cost of data centre and supervision complexity due to
    the reliance on the external infrastructure (Liang et al., 2019). Blockchain can
    arrive to provide a much more flexible and efficient data delivery but still meet
    stringent security requirements. A secure sharing scheme for industrial IoT is
    proposed in Liu et al. (2018c), which highlights the impact of blockchain for
    security and reliability of IoT data exchange under untrustworthy system settings.
    In comparison to traditional database such as SQL, blockchain can provide better
    sharing services with low-latency data retrieval and higher degrees of security,
    reliability, and stronger resistance to some malicious attacks (DoS, DDoS) for
    data sharing. Further, the privacy of data is well maintained by distributed blockchain
    ledgers, while data owners have full control on their data shared in the network,
    improving the data ownership capability of sharing models (Lu et al., 2019c).
    The work in Cech et al. (2019) also introduces a sharing concept empowered by
    blockchain and fog computing. The proposed solution constitutes a first step towards
    a realization of blockchain adoption as a Function-as-a-Service system for data
    sharing. Fog nodes can collect IoT data arising from private IoT applications
    and securely share each other via a blockchain platform which can verify all data
    requests and monitor data sharing behaviours for any threat detection. Smart contracts
    running on blockchain have also demonstrated efficiency in data sharing services
    (Qian et al., 2018). Smart contracts can take the role of building a trusted execution
    environment so that we can establish a set of information exchange frameworks
    working on blockchain. For example, the study in Zhang and Chen (2019) leverages
    smart contracts to build a trustless data sharing in vehicular networks. The roadside
    units (RSU) can set the constraints for data sharing by using smart contracts
    which define shared time, region scope, and objects to make sure the data coins
    is distributed fairly to all vehicles that participate in the contribution of
    data. In addition, the authors of Bhaskaran et al. (2018) introduce a smart contract-based
    architecture for consent-driven and double-blind data sharing in the Hyperledger
    Fabric blockchain platform. In the system, confidential customer data can be authorized
    and validated by smart contracts, and the service providers can execute the data
    tasks, add attributes and metadata, and submit it to the blockchain for validation
    and recording in a transparent manner. 4.3. Network virtualization Wireless network
    virtualization is considered as an emerging paradigm in 5G to build different
    virtual wireless networks (VWNs) through mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs)
    to support rapidly increasing data demands caused by emerging 5G IoT applications
    (Condoluci and Mahmoodi, 2018). Network virtualization is able to enhance wireless
    resource (RF slice) utilization, provide better coverage, and increase network
    capacity and energy efficiency (Kitindi et al., 2017). The blockchain technology
    can provide the required characteristics of nonrepudiation and immutability to
    overcome the shortcomings of the previous configuration models. More precisely,
    blockchain is capable of creating secure virtual wireless networks (VWNs) so that
    wireless resource-owners sublease their wireless resources to provide for mobile
    virtual network operators (MVNOs) (Rawat and Alshaikhi, 2018). All participants
    of each virtual network slice is managed by a slice blockchain, which provides
    auditability of slice creation, monitors orchestration operations and data access
    of clients to the data centre. In such a decentralized virtual network, smart
    contracts can be very useful to provide automation and transparency in a distributed
    way instead of trusting a particular node or an authority process transactions.
    The solution of using blockchain and smart contracts can be an ideal solution
    to create secure end-to-end network slices for supporting virtual services with
    diverse requirements and resiliency (Rebello et al., 2019b). Meanwhile, the work
    in Bozic et al. (2017) proposes blockchain to secure virtual machine orchestration
    operations in cloud-based virtualization systems. The main objective is to protect
    and secure virtual machines and make virtual machine managers well resistant to
    be compromised by threats. In fact, the complexity of virtual networks with multiple
    physical machines and virtual machines raises security concerns to be solved.
    For instance, a virtual machine can be created virtually by an external attacker
    to run in a server and used to perform external DDOS attacks, and internal attacks
    can act as legitimate entities to perform unauthorized data access which can impair
    the data integrity and confidentiality of the network. Therefore, the proposed
    work considers the authentication issues in virtualization using a blockchain
    system shared between the virtualization server, the orchestrator and VMM agents.
    The orchestration requests (create, destroy, resize, copy, migrate) to a virtualization
    server are recorded as a transaction which is then authenticated by smart contracts
    to grant permission for the orchestration command, avoid malicious access to the
    data centre. Moreover, in order to prevent from double-spending of same RF resources
    (frequency slices), the work in Rawat et al. (2017) leverages a distributed blockchain
    based scheme to sublease the frequency slice to MVNOs through wireless network
    virtualization. The proposed wireless virtualization architecture contains three
    main entities: wireless service providers who participate in sharing or subleasing
    their wireless resources to MVNOs; data sharing services for wireless resources;
    and block managers that are trusted devices working to maintain the blockchain.
    Each transaction in blockchain for wireless virtualization includes the information
    of bandwidth allocation, allocated channel power, data rates which are utilized
    by the MVNOs while serving their users through virtual networks. Specially, the
    work pays special attention to addressing the double-spending issue which is the
    allocation of same wireless resources to multiple MVNOs with a hope that all MVNOs
    would not use their leased spectrum at the same time for obtain maximum revenues.
    Compared to traditional approaches which mainly rely on centralized trusted authorities
    to perform resource sharing, blockchain is much more efficient in verifying each
    transaction to ensure that the wireless resources are scheduled to a given MVNO,
    which not only solves double-spending problems but provides fairness and transparency
    for network virtualization. In an effort to secure management, configuration and
    migration of virtual networks services, the work in Alvarenga et al. (2018) presents
    a blockchain-based architecture for network function virtualization (NFV) and
    service function chaining (SFC). The blockchain module designed mainly performs
    three main functions: verify the format of the transaction, validate the accuracy
    of the signature of the transaction, and check the duplication of transactions.
    The service requests sent from NFV clients would be verified by blockchain via
    VNF key pairs and blockchain module key pairs for authentication through a consensus
    mechanism. In the same direction, the authors of Rebello et al. (2019a) also analyse
    on how blockchain can support secure configuration and migration of NFVs. The
    consensus of Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) is implemented on the
    Open Platform for Network Function Virtualization (OPNFV) to monitor and schedule
    the orchestration operations in virtualized networks. Furthermore, the security
    for network virtualization is analysed in Rawat (2019), and that is based on blockchain
    to enable privacy of spectrum resources. 4.4. Resource management In 5G networks,
    mobile resource (i.e. computation, memory, bandwidth, channel and storage) is
    one of the most popular services. The growing variety of 5G services leads to
    unprecedented levels of complexity in mobile resource management (Calabrese et
    al., 2018). Edge/cloud computing in 5G needs to allocate its computation capacity
    to ensure efficient data execution while maintaining resources to serve the increasing
    demands of mobile users in the long term. In virtualized networks, the VNFs of
    a single slice may have heterogeneous resource requirements, i.e., CPU, memory,
    bandwidth and storage, depending on their functions and user requirements. The
    resource demands of slices of the same function type may be also different since
    they are serving different number of mobile users. For instance, a provider might
    run multiple Internet of Things (IoT) slices each one dedicated for a specific
    application. In such contexts, with heterogeneous resource capacities and heterogeneous
    resource requirements, implementing an optimal resource allocation to the mobile
    5G network is a critical challenge. Importantly, the current resource management
    architectures mainly rely on a central authority to perform resource allocation
    and verification of user resource access, but such models obviously remain single
    point failure risks and security from the third party. Moreover, the traceability
    of the current resource sharing schemes is very weak, which makes shared resources
    being compromised by attacks or used illegally by malicious users. All of these
    issues need to be solved effectively before deploying 5G services in practical
    scenarios. Blockchains can be a highly efficient approach to solve the above remaining
    issues and improve the resource management. The use of blockchain enables the
    distributed resource allocation schemes as a strong alternative which is more
    preferable for both the service providers (edge/cloud, slice providers) and also
    mobile users/equipments. Blockchain would simplify the resource management concept,
    while remaining the important features of the core network and ensure strong security.
    For example, blockchain has been applied in VNFs in Franco et al. (2019) to implement
    reliable resource allocation corresponding to user requests from different aspects
    such as user demand, cost. More interesting, smart contracts are also integrated
    to build an auction scheme which enables to allocate optimally to the network
    of users in a transparent manner (due to the transparency and immutability of
    smart contracts) in dynamic mobile environments. Spurred by the power of blockchain,
    a resource management model is introduced in Le et al. (2019) which proposes a
    new concept of blockchain radio access network (B-RAN). The main goal is to achieve
    a spectrum resource balance in the network of user equipment (UE), access points
    (AP), spectrum bands and blockchain. The resource access services between UE and
    AP can be implemented by a smart contract-enabled protocol which defines access
    rules in conjunction with certain resource constraints such as service time, service
    demand, and service fee. The service requestor, i.e. mobile user, can undertake
    resource trading with AP by triggering the smart contract so that spectrum access
    is authenticated and resource is released via blockchain. In the 5G networks,
    edge computing plays a significant role in improving QoS of mobile services thanks
    to its low latency and fast computing capabilities. Resource allocation for edge
    computing is of significant importance in edge-based mobile networks, such as
    IoT for better QoS and robustness of the system. A study in Liu et al. (2018d)
    employs blockchain to develop a decentralized resource allocation scheme which
    overcomes the limitation of previous centralized schemes in terms of latency and
    service provision speed. To provide adaptive computation services for IoT data,
    resource allocation should be dynamically adjusted without any centralized controller
    to maintain the high QoS. Blockchain is well suitable for such scenarios by offering
    a distributed ledgers to update resource information in an automatic and trustworthy
    manner (Liu et al., 2019a). In the case of resource scarcity in the network, a
    cooperative edge computing model can be necessary to support low-capability edge
    devices (Xu et al., 2018a). In this regard, blockchain would be useful to provide
    a reliable resource sharing between edge nodes. Resource requests can be verified
    strictly by intelligent contracts with access policies without passing a centralized
    authority, which also reduces resource sharing latency. Another blockchain-based
    resource allocation architecture for edge computing is presented in Xia et al.
    (2018b). In this work, blockchain is responsible to monitor resource trading and
    user payment between miners and edge servers. The experimental results also show
    that the blockchain-based solution is truthful, individual rational and computationally
    efficient, compared to the conventional approaches. In the multi-user network,
    a critical challenge is to allocate fairly the wireless resources among users
    with respect to their priorities (i.e., emergency levels). For example, a user
    who needs more resources for his service demand should be allocated more resources
    from the provider. Without authenticating the users'' priorities can lead to insufficient
    wireless resources to the users who are actually in high priorities. To provide
    a dynamic resource allocation solution for optimal resource usage, the work in
    Lin et al. (2019) presents a blockchain consensus protocol to check the authenticity
    of priorities. Each mobile user can take the role of a blockchain node to perform
    authenticity for a new message or request. The resource level is decided by an
    asynchronous Byzantine agreement among nodes, which guarantees trustworthiness
    and fairness for resource sharing. Moreover, in optical networks, how to implement
    resource management while ensuring high security is also highly important. The
    authors in Yang et al. (2019c) employ blockchain to enforce security policies
    for 5G optical networks, namely Software Defined Optical Network (SDON). In fact,
    security for SDON is ensured by using traditional firewall flow tables that may
    be easy to modify and conflict with firewall policies. Once the attack causes
    a single point of failure, malicious traffic enters the SDON network for data
    theft and malicious modification. Blockchain with its anonymity, persistence,
    and auditability hence supports the trustworthiness of distributed resource communications
    and storage. 4.5. Interference management The problem of interference management
    in the 5G infrastructural wireless networks is expected to become critical due
    to the unexpected data content traffic and numbers of 5G IoT devices. Although
    the telecom operators provide mobile services with the implementation of small
    size networks which can deliver various advantages such as high data rate and
    low signal delay, it is likely to suffer from various issues such as inter-cell,
    intra-cell, and inter-user interferences (Nam et al., 2014). In the data-intensive
    service scenarios where a huge amount of mobile data is required to be transmitted
    in cellular networks, D2D communication can be a good choice to implement low-latency
    data transmission. However, the coexistence of D2D devices and cellular users
    in the same spectrum for communication and the short distance between D2D devices
    and users in small cells can result in cross-tier interference (CTI). The possibility
    of collaborating communication and sharing service benefits between mobile devices
    can be infeasible in practice due to the interest conflict between them. Building
    a fair and trusted economic scheme can be a solution to this problem, and thus
    mitigate the network interference. Currently, electronic money transactions have
    received extensive attention in small cell deployments, but the transaction consensus
    is often reached by passing a central authority (Qamar et al., 2019). This approach
    not only incurs additional costs of latency and transmission energy, but also
    raises security concerns from third parties. Distributed interference management
    with blockchain would be a feasible approach to cope with such challenges and
    facilitate interference management. For example, the authors in El Gamal and El
    Gamal (2019) present a first example of using distributed blockchain to support
    a linear interference network. The main objective is to build a monetary mechanism
    using blockchain for optimal interference management. More precisely, a network
    model for a pair of two nodes including a transmitter and receiver is considered,
    wherein the transmitter (payer) may cause interference at the receiver (payee).
    A distributed interference avoidance transmission strategy is proposed so that
    a node has to pay in order to be active and then maximizes its monetary credit.
    The blockchain implementation realises the monetary policies for cooperative interference
    management using a greedy algorithm. The proposed strategy also relieved that
    blockchain can help allocate economic benefits among users for interference avoidance
    (Gamal and Gamal, 2018). In the D2D networks, interference may incur from the
    unfair resource allocation from the service providers to different user types.
    For example, users with higher spectral resource demands should be prioritized
    during resource scheduling. Motivated by this, a blockchain consensus method is
    proposed in Lin and Tang (2018) to evaluate the amount of cross-tier interference
    (CTI) caused by each user. The authors pay special attention to building an access
    control mechanism using blockchain for the authenticity of channel state information
    (CSI) with a dynamic resource allocation. A user with higher CSI can be allocated
    a larger amount of wireless resource. A simulation implementation with an optimal
    user access algorithm is also presented, showing that the proposed scheme can
    improve the spectral efficiency for D2D users without interference effects. The
    study in Liu et al. (2019d) utilizes power control with blockchain to support
    Quality-of-Service (QoS) provisioning for enabling efficient transmission of a
    macrocell user (MUE) and the time delay of femtocell users (FUEs) in blockchain-based
    femtocell networks. The macrocell base station (MBS) shares its spectrum resource
    to FUEs and the co-channel interference can be caused by the FUEs. Blockchain
    is essential to build a decentralized femtocell network so that payment can be
    done in a reliable way without the involvement of a middle party. In another scenario,
    the interference between IoT transaction nodes (TNs) in the blockchain-enabled
    IoT network is also analysed in Sun et al. (2019). In this work, the authors focus
    on investigating the performance of blockchain transaction throughput and communication
    throughput by deriving the probability density function (PDF) with respect to
    the interference of TNs, for a transmission from an IoT node to a blockchain full
    function node. The blockchain-based solution is able to ensure high successful
    rate and overall communication throughput and preserve the IoT network against
    security threats. Despite great research efforts in the field, the use of blockchain
    for interference management in 5G mobile networks is still in its infancy with
    few investigated works. The preliminary findings from the literature works are
    expected to open the door for exploring blockchain in overcoming the challenges
    in network interference management in terms of network throughput and security.
    4.6. Federated learning Recent years, federated learning has emerged as a promising
    machine learning technique for large-scale mobile network scenarios (Li et al.,
    2019b). Federated learning enables distributed model training using local datasets
    from distributed nodes such as IoT devices, edge servers but shares only model
    updates without revealing raw training data. More specific, it employs the on-device
    processing power and untapped private data by implementing the model training
    in a decentralized manner and keeping the data where it is generated. This emerging
    approach provides an ability to protect privacy of mobile devices while ensuring
    high learning performance and thus promises to play a significant role in supporting
    privacy-sensitive 5G mobile applications such as edge computing and catching,
    networking, and spectrum management. In particular, the cooperation of blockchain
    and federated learning has been considered in recent works to solve complex issues
    in mobile 5G wireless networks. The authors in Kim et al. (2019b) introduce a
    blockchained federated learning (BlockFL) architecture which enables on-device
    machine learning without any centralized training data or coordination by employing
    a consensus mechanism in blockchain. By relying on the decentralized blockchain
    ledger, the proposed model overcomes the single point of failure problem and enhances
    the network federation to untrustworthy devices in a public network due to federated
    validation on the local training results. Besides, the blockchain also accelerate
    the training process by a reward mechanism, which in return promotes the collaboration
    of ubiquitous devices. The study in Kang et al. (2019) considers a reputation
    scheme which selects reliable mobile devices (workers) for federated learning
    to defend against unreliable model updates in mobile networks. To ensure accurate
    reputation calculation, a consortium blockchain with the properties of non-repudiation
    and tamper-resistance is leveraged to create a secure decentralized model update
    network of edge servers and mobile devices, leading to the reliability of federated
    learning on mobile edge computing. Importantly, blockchain associated with contract
    theory enables an incentive mechanism, which stimulates high-reputation workers
    with high-quality data to join the model training for preventing the poisoning
    attacks in federated learning (Lim et al., 2019). Meanwhile, the authors in Doku
    et al. (2019) incorporate blockchain with federated learning in the determination
    of data relevance in mobile device networks. This can be done by encourage mobile
    users to aggregate relevant information belonging to a specific topic that they
    are seeking during the interaction process with other users. They also introduced
    a decentralized way of storing data which reduces the risk from centralized data
    storage. A consensus mechanism called the Proof of Common Interest is considered
    that provides data verification services to ensure that data that is added to
    the blockchain ledger is relevant. To provide a parallel computing architecture
    for big data analysis, especially for the precision medicine which data sets are
    owned by healthcare data users, an integrated blockchain-federated learning model
    is proposed in Shae and Tsai (2018). Federated learning assists training large
    medical data sets from various distributed data sources owned and hosted by different
    hospitals, patients, and health service providers, while blockchain-empowered
    smart contract is used to enable a distributed parallel computing environment
    for distributed deep learning using heterogeneous and distributed data. Moreover,
    the blockchain adoption enables secure, transparent, and auditable data sharing
    to promote international collaboration. The work in Lu et al. (2019d) considers
    a blockchain empowered secure data sharing architecture for distributed devices
    in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). The key focus is on building a data sharing
    with privacy preservation by incorporating in federated learning. By using the
    power of federation of IoT devices, the data privacy is ensured via the federated
    learning model which allows to share the data model without revealing the actual
    data. 4.7. Privacy In addition to smart emerging services that 5G can provide
    to mobile users and stakeholders, the complex 5G mobile environments also raise
    many privacy issues to be investigated carefully. According to a survey work in
    Khan et al. (2019), the privacy challenges in 5G come from various aspects, such
    as end-to-end data privacy, data sharing privacy, trust issues in information
    flows, and trust issues in centralized mobile data architectures with third parties.
    Blockchain with its decentralization, traceability, availability and trust capabilities
    has been demonstrated widely its great potential in solving privacy issues in
    5G networks and services (Salman et al., 2018). As an example, blockchain is feasible
    to protect user data for decentralized personal data management (Zyskind et al.,
    2015), which enables to provide personalized services. Laws and regulations for
    data protection could be programmed into the blockchain so that they are enforced
    automatically. Interestingly, the blockchain is capable of providing full control
    of monitoring personal data when sharing on the network, which is unique from
    all traditional approaches which hinder users from tracking their data (Xie et
    al., 2019a). To provide decentralized and trusted data provenance services on
    cloud computing, the work in Liang et al. (2017) uses blockchains to provide tamper-proof
    records and enable the data transparency. The blockchain can support in three
    steps, namely provenance data collection, provenance data storage, and provenance
    data validation. Data provenance record is stored on the blockchain, where blockchain
    nodes (i.e. mobile users, data owners, and service providers) can participate
    in consensus for confirmation of every block. During the data sharing between
    users and service providers, transmitted data can be highly vulnerable to malicious
    threats, i.e. data attacks, then privacy for shared data should be considered
    carefully. In this context, the authors in Banerjee and Joshi (2017) presented
    a blockchain-based solution for secure data exchange. Data can be recorded in
    blocks and signed by miners so that sharing is securely implemented. An automated
    access-control and audit mechanism is considered wherein the blockchain enforces
    user data privacy policies when sharing their data across third parties for privacy
    preservation (Butt et al., 2019). In current IoT applications, the private information
    management often relies on centralized databases owned by third-party organizations
    for data services such as data processing, data storage, data sharing. However,
    it is easy to find that this architecture remains weaknesses in terms of data
    leakage coming from curious third parties and high communication latency due to
    such centralized models. A privacy architecture using blockchain for smart cities
    is presented in Mora et al. (2018), focusing on solving the above issues. Blockchain
    has the potential to help mitigate privacy exposure while allowing users to benefit
    from trusted transactions and better data control. The records of data access
    are added to a transparent ledger so that blockchain with consensus mechanism
    can verify and validate the data requests from all users to detect any potential
    threats in a decentralized manner without the involvement of any third parties.
    In another research effort, the work in Magyar (2017) investigates how blockchain
    can support secure data storage and data availability in IoT health networks.
    Blockchain potentially empowers a decentralized and openly extendable network
    while protecting data on the network. A privacy-preserved scheme empowered by
    blockchain is also considered and discussed in Gai et al. (2019a). In this work,
    a consortium blockchain-based approach is designed to mitigate privacy leakages.
    Both energy users and suppliers are verified by a trading smart contract so that
    all trading transactions are authenticated for trustworthiness. Moreover, to achieve
    good privacy in industrial IoT, the study (Wan et al., 2019) introduces a decentralized
    blockchain architecture in conjunction with a hash algorithm and an asymmetric
    encryption algorithm. IoT data are still stored by the offline database (i.e.
    cloud storage), and the access record (storage, reading, and control) of each
    entity is stored in the block for tracking. Therefore, data storage on blockchain
    can be solved efficiently, and each operation will be strictly supervised via
    blocks. In dealing with privacy issues in vehicular networks, the authors of Lu
    et al. (2019a) present a privacy-preserving authentication framework. The main
    goal of the proposed system is to preserve the identity privacy of the vehicles
    in the vehicular ad hoc networks. All the certificates and transactions are recorded
    immutably and securely in the blockchain to make the activities of vehicles (i.e.
    data sharing, energy trading) transparent and verifiable. In a similar direction,
    a model called CreditCoin for a novel privacy-preserving incentive announcement
    solution is presented in Li et al. (2018b). On the one hand, by offering incentives
    to users, CreditCoin can promote data sharing for network expansion, and the transactions
    and account information of blockchain are also immutable and resistant to be modified
    by attacks. On the other hand, with a strongly linked ledger, the blockchain controller
    can be easy to trace user activities, including malicious behaviours, for data
    protection. In addition, the work in Jiang et al. (2019) proposes to use private
    smart contracts to design a privacy-preserving business protocol in e-commerce.
    In the contract, the interaction policy is defined via a business logic that determines
    types of trade, counterparties, underlying assets, and price information of the
    online shopping. The transactions between the seller and the buyer can be implemented
    securely and transparently via the contract without the disclosure of private
    information. Recently, the blockchain benefit to privacy of machine learning algorithm
    implementation is investigated in Chen et al. (2018b). A privacy-preserving and
    secure decentralized Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm is established
    on blockchain, which enables computation in a decentralized manner in computing
    nodes. Computation parameters and information are kept in the block without revealing
    their own data and being compromised by data attacks. Obviously, the blockchain
    technology is promising to privacy preservation in the modern mobile networks
    and services, especially in 5G IoT systems, where data protection is becoming
    more important in the context of exponential mobile data growth in the 5G era
    (Hassan et al., 2019). 4.8. Security services The rapid increase of the 5G traffic
    and the explosive growth of valuable data produced by user equipment have led
    to strong demands for security mechanisms to protect mobile data against threats
    and attacks. With the important security properties, blockchain can provide a
    number of security services for 5G to improve the overall performance of future
    mobile systems. Considering the state of the art literature (Salman et al., 2018),
    blockchain mainly offers three main security services, including access control,
    data integrity and authentication, which will be summarized as follows. 4.8.1.
    Access control Access control refers to the ability of preventing the malicious
    use of network resource. Access control mechanisms guarantee that only legitimate
    users, devices or machines are granted permissions (e.g., read, write, etc.) the
    resources in a network, database, services and applications. Blockchain, especially
    smart contracts can offer access control capability to protect the involved system
    against any threats. As an example, a trustworthy access control scheme leveraging
    smart contracts is introduced in Zhang et al. (2018c) to implement access right
    validation for IoT networks. The access policy is predefined and stored in the
    contract, which runs on blockchain. The contract can verify the user request using
    such a policy in a dynamic and decentralized manner. Different from traditional
    access control architectures which always use external authority for verification,
    the blockchain-based approach can perform direct access control between the requestor
    and the data centre so that the access latency can be reduced and security is
    improved. To achieve access control for user requests to data resources in fog
    cloud-based IoT networks, a privacy-oriented distributed key management scheme
    using blockchain is proposed in Ma et al. (2019b) to achieve hierarchical access
    control. To receive a permission grant for data access, a subject needs to send
    a request with access information (i.e. identification, user address) to the security
    manager which checks the access and broadcast this request to other entities for
    verification via blockchain. The access is granted only when a consensus is achieved
    among all entities, which enhances reliability of the access control architecture.
    To overcome the challenges caused by complicated access management and the lack
    of credibility due to centralization of traditional access control models, the
    authors in Ding et al. (2019) introduce an attribute-based access control scheme.
    The ultimate goal is to simplify the access management by a distributed blockchain
    ledger while providing efficient access control ability to safeguard IoT data
    resources. Moreover, the work in Wang et al. (2019b) introduces a combination
    of Ethereum blockchain and ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE)
    to realize fine-grained access control for cloud storage. An access control policy
    is programmed in a smart contract which verifies the request based on the access
    period time and the attributes of data users. All information of control functionality
    results is stored on the blockchain, so the access control is visible to all users.
    Meanwhile, a transaction-based access control scheme based on blockchain is proposed
    in Zhu et al. (2018). The access verification follows a four-step procedure: subject
    registration, object escrowing and publication, access request and grant. Each
    request of the subject is registered as a transaction that is then submitted to
    blockchain to be validated by the data owner on blockchain by suing a Bitcoin-type
    cryptographic script. The works in Rouhani et al. (2018) and Ouaddah et al. (2016)
    also investigate the capability of blockchain for realizing access control services
    with Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric platforms. To perform access control in the
    large-scale IoT networks, a platform called BlendCAC is considered in Xu et al.
    (2018b) as a promising solution for securing data sharing and resource trading
    among devices, users and service providers. 4.8.2. Data integrity The integrity
    property ensures that the data is not modified in the transit or data is intact
    from its source to the destination. In recent years, distributed blockchain ledgers
    are starting to be used to verify data integrity for mobile services and networks,
    such as data management services or IoT applications, to overcome the limitations
    of the traditional models, which often rely on a third party auditor for integrity
    validation (Zikratov et al., 2017). A blockchain-based framework for data integrity
    service is also presented in Liu et al. (2017) which performs integrity verification
    based on blockchain for both data owners and data customers. To operate the data
    integrity service, a smart contract living on the blockchain is employed to audit
    transactions from all users. The information of data history and database stored
    in blockchain is strongly resistant to modifications, which improves data integrity.
    To provide data integrity services on resource-limited IoT devices, the authors
    in Machado and Fröhlich (2018) introduce a lightweight integrity verification
    model in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) by taking advantage of blockchain features.
    The key concept of the proposal is enabled by a three-level design, including
    the first level for running the Proof-of-Trust (PoT) mechanism among IoT devices,
    and two upper levels for data persistence and integrity verification by cloud.
    The implementation results reveal the efficiency of the blockchain-empowered model
    with good confidentiality, availability, integrity, and authenticity for IoT communication.
    In an effort to deal with challenges caused by centralized traditional data integrity
    schemes such as symmetric key approaches and public key infrastructure (PKI),
    a decentralized stochastic blockchain-enabled data integrity framework is analysed
    and discussed in Chen et al. (2018c). The proposed stochastic blockchain design
    includes the chain structure and the consensus mechanism for the data integrity
    checking procedures. At present, with the popularity of cloud storage, how to
    guarantee data integrity on the cloud has become a challenging problem. The authors
    of Yue et al. (2018) describe a framework for data integrity verification in P2P
    cloud storage via blockchain which makes the verification process more open, transparent,
    and auditable to all data users. Moreover, a new solution for improving integrity
    on cloud is introduced in Zhao et al. (2018). In the system, blockchain constructs
    a semi-finished block on a candidate block arranged by data packages that is broadcast
    to all entities, while the consensus mechanism in blockchain, i.e Proof of Work,
    is able to generate tamper-resistant metadata associated with policy-based encryption
    method, leading to better data integrity. Besides, to tackle the issue of verification
    delay caused by procrastinating third-party auditors, the study (Zhang et al.,
    2019b) implements a solution for cloud storage using blockchain which enables
    the auditors to record each verification result into a blockchain as a transaction
    with a stringent time requirement. The time stamp in conjunction with signature
    and hash values can provide a time-sensitive data integrity service with a high
    degree of system security. 4.8.3. Authentication Recent years, blockchain has
    been also investigated to realize the authentication capability to improve the
    overall security levels of 5G networks (Yang et al., 2017). Mobile user access
    needs to be authenticated to detect and prevent any potential malicious behaviours
    to network resources (i.e. database, computing resources), which preserves the
    involved system and enhances the network robustness. In Raju et al. (2017), a
    privacy-enhancing protocol is proposed by using the blockchain technology. The
    approach provides an ability to identify users by the evaluation on personal information
    which is extracted from the user request package. The smart contract is also integrated
    to perform authentication, aiming to prevent unauthorized access from attacks.
    The authors in Almadhoun et al. (2018) consider an authentication scheme using
    blockchain for fog computing. The fog nodes running on Ethereum blockchain employ
    smart contracts to authenticate access from IoT users. The proposed scheme facilitates
    managing and accessing IoT devices on a large scale fog network while providing
    security features such as decentralization, privacy and authentication without
    the need of a trusted third party. In order to achieve authentication in vehicular
    networks, a strategy working on the blockchain platform is proposed in Sharma
    and Chakraborty (2018) which can undertake vehicle authentication and privacy
    preservation with seamless access control for vehicles. Blockchain can bring more
    advantages than conventional approaches using third party auditors in terms of
    high trust degree and transparency. Another blockchain application for privacy-awareness
    authentication is shown in Xiong et al. (2019), which allows both the server and
    the user to authenticate each other through this credential or certificate in
    a decentralized manner. All entities in the network achieve a consensus on an
    authentication task, and any potential threats can be detected and reflected on
    decentralized ledgers for necessary prevention. In summary, we list the key blockchain
    use cases for 5G services in the taxonomy Table 5 to summarize the key contributions
    of each reference work. Table 5. Taxonomy of Blockchain applications for key 5G

    Nowadays, Internet of Things (IoT) have developed rapidly to provide ubiquitous
    services for almost all industrial applications. The evolution of the 5G networks
    would be the key enabler of the advancement of the IoT. A number of key enabling
    5G technologies such as edge/cloud computing, NFV, D2D communication are developed
    to facilitate future IoT, giving birth to a new model as 5G IoT, which is expected
    to disrupt the global industry (Li et al., 2018c; Ejaz et al., 2016). Especially,
    in recent years, blockchain has been investigated and integrated with 5G IoT networks
    to open up new opportunities to empower IoT services and applications (Nguyen
    et al., 2019a). Reviewing the literature works, we find that blockchains mainly
    support some key IoT applications, namely smart healthcare, smart city, smart
    transportation, smart grid and UAVs, which will be highlighted as follows. 5.1.
    Smart healthcare Healthcare is an industrial sector where organizations and medical
    institutions provide healthcare services, medical equipment, health insurance
    to facilitate healthcare delivery to patients. The emerging 5G technologies are
    potential to support smart healthcare applications, which fulfill the new requirements
    for healthcare such as improved QoS, better density and ultra-high reliability
    (Ahad et al., 2019b). The integration of blockchain with 5G technologies can advance
    current healthcare systems and provide more performance benefits in terms of better
    decentralization, security, privacy (Thuemmler et al., 2018), service efficiency
    and system simplification for lower operational costs (Cech et al., 2019). Blockchain
    can incorporate with 5G technologies such as softwarization, cloud/edge computing
    for new smart healthcare services (Salahuddin et al., 2018) as depicted in Fig.
    9. The softwarized infrastructure can perform network functions through NFVs,
    which promote IoT communication, while cloud computing can support fast healthcare
    delivery services for early detection of patient health conditions. In such a
    5G healthcare scenario, blockchain is employed to build a peer-to-peer database
    system which can validate and record all transactions (i.e. healthcare request,
    patient data) and store immutably them in decentralized ledgers. All transaction
    blocks are also visible to healthcare network members, including doctors, clinicians,
    and patients to accelerate data sharing during medications and treatment processes.

    Fig. 9. Blockchain for 5G healthcare (Salahuddin et al., 2018). Blockchain is
    also integrated with healthcare networks (Li et al., 2019c) for healthcare networking
    and computing. A software-defined infrastructure is designed to facilitate the
    specification of home-based healthcare services, and a cloud edge model is considered
    to provide a flexible heterogeneous health computation services. The role of blockchain
    in this work is to deal with health data interoperability and security issues,
    such as enabling effective authorized interactions between patients and healthcare
    providers (doctors, insurance companies), and delivering patient data securely
    to a variety of organizations and devices. Also, an access control mechanism empowered
    by smart contracts is integrated to support secure data sharing through user access
    verification, aiming to prohibit unauthorized users or threats from malicious
    access to health data resources. A healthcare architecture based on D2D communications
    can a notable solution for efficient information sharing and large-scale data
    sharing, but it also exists critical privacy issues due to untrusted sharing environments.
    An example is presented in Feng et al. (2018b) wherein blockchain is incorporated
    with the D2D technology for large scale feature extraction applications on cloud.
    In healthcare, for example, image features extracted from health data collection
    contain important information of patients and thus need to be secured. Blockchain
    would ensure secure data storage by shifting the information to decentralized
    ledgers which are maintained by all participants. All stored data on blockchain
    is signed digitally and identified by hash values, which also solve privacy leaking
    issues from tampering or forging. Recently, blockchain is also considered and
    investigated in mobile edge computing (MEC)-empowered healthcare applications.
    The authors in Lin et al. (2019) consider an edge blockchain for telemedicine
    applications, with the main objective of providing secure transmission and computation
    of health data. The MEC-based cellular health network contains a base station
    and a set of mobile users. Here, mobile users can access the Internet via the
    cellular network, and they share the computation resources of a MEC server linked
    with a base station in a small cell. Blockchain provides a consensus protocol
    to verify the patient priority which is defined as the level of wireless resources
    that a user needs for their computation. As a result, the optimal resource allocation
    can be achieved to ensure the quality of data transmission of the whole network,
    and user information is secured due to storing on blockchain ledgers. Another
    blockchain approach in edge-based mass screening applications for disease detections
    is presented in Rahman et al. (2018). Due to a massive amount of captured multimedia
    IoT test data, an offline storage solution is considered and integrated with blockchain,
    which keeps cryptographic hashes of health data. This approach allows patients
    to take control of their information when performing clinical tests, visiting
    doctors or moving to other hospitals thanks to the transparency and availability
    of the blockchain protocol. Meanwhile, cloud computing, a key enabling technology
    of 5G networks, has also provided many notable solutions for healthcare services
    (Nguyen et al., 2019a). Many research works have dedicated to use blockchain for
    cloud-based healthcare networks, such as (Wang et al., 2019c). In this work, blockchain
    has proven its efficiency in improving the security of electronic health records
    (EHRs) sharing in cloud-assisted healthcare. The cloud computing is employed to
    store EHR ciphertext while the consortium blockchain keeps records of keyword
    ciphertext for data searching and sharing. In addition, to achieve secure data
    exchange between IoT health devices and cloud servers, a blockchain-enabled communication
    protocol is described in Talukder et al. (2018). All sensitive patient information
    and medical test results can be stored and managed by blockchain where a consensus
    mechanism is necessary for user verification when a medical test is performed.
    Very recently, we have also investigated and designed a blockchain architecture
    for cloud-based health management systems (Nguyen et al., 2019b). We have built
    a cloud platform where blockchain is used to create a secure data sharing network
    among healthcare providers and patients. All EHRs records are stored in a decentralized
    storage IPFS storage on cloud, where smart contracts are also integrated to provide
    authentication services for data sharing. The user without passing a verification
    phase will not have the right to access the data on cloud, while data retrieval
    for authorized users is accelerated by the decentralized data storage mechanism
    using IPFS. 5.2. Smart city The evolution of 5G technologies has enabled enormous
    business opportunities and digital transformation initiatives for new smart city
    models, proving a wide range of services for city citizens (Skouby and Lynggaard,
    2014). Smart cities involve a variety of components, including ubiquitous IoT
    devices, heterogeneous networks, largescale data storage, and service provisions.
    Despite the potential vision of smart cities, how to provide smart city services
    with high security remains unsolved. In this scenario, blockchain can be a promising
    candidate to solve critical security issues and empower smart city services (Noh
    and Kwon, 2019; Paul et al., 2018). To simplify the management of smart city services
    on a large scale, a city can be divided into small blocks called smart blocks.
    Each smart block consists of a variety of IoT devices, such as sensors, cameras,
    etc. of a certain area under the control of a block admin. A private blockchain
    using a ledger database is important to securely store all information generated
    from IoT devices during data exchange, data offloading and computation services.
    Another research in Rahman et al. (2019) analyses a sustainable IoT architecture
    empowered by blockchain for a secure sharing economy services in mega smart cities.
    The proposed system employs cognitive fog nodes at the edge to gather and process
    offloaded multimedia payload and transactions from a mobile edge node and IoT
    devices. To extract significant information from the outsourced data, machine
    learning is used during the data analytic, and such results are then put in blockchain
    for secure sharing and storage. Furthermore, to solve data security issues in
    IoT for smart cities, blockchain is considered in Kotobi and Sartipi (2018b) to
    secure communication between the smart city and home devices and sensors. IoT
    data can be executed and computed at the edge layer for latency reduction, while
    user access information is recorded by blockchain, which works as a universal
    ledger. The key benefits of the proposed scheme include system transparency as
    well as the permissionless property which allows adding any new IoT devices without
    involving any authorities. In 5G smart cities, a prohibitively large amount of
    surveillance data will be generated continuously from ubiquitous video sensors.
    It is very challenging to immediately identify the objects of interest or detect
    malicious actions from thousands of video frames on the large scale. In such a
    context, building a distributed edge computing networks is highly efficient to
    achieve scalable data computation (Nikouei et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019d).
    From the security perspective, blockchain would be a natural choice to establish
    decentralized security solutions by interconnecting edge nodes, IoT devices and
    city users, where data sharing, computation and business transactions can be performed
    on the blockchain ledger platform. It is also demonstrated that the use of distributed
    blockchain provides more benefits than the centralized architectures with a central
    cloud server in terms of lower latency, energy consumption, better service delivery,
    faster user response with security and privacy guarantees (Damianou et al., 2019).
    Currently, most Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) which monitors the connections between
    transportation providers and passengers in smart cities is controlled by a central
    MaaS manager, which potentially introduces privacy leakage and system disruptions
    if this entity is attacked. By integrating with the blockchain, the MaaS model
    can be operated in a much more secure and decentralized manner (Nguyen et al.,
    2019c). In this work, blockchain can help improve trust and transparency for all
    stakeholders and eliminate the need of centralized entity to make commercial agreements
    on MaaS. The mobility services, such as ticket purchase or payments for using
    transports, can be programmed by smart contracts, which enable automatic and reliable
    service trading and payment. Cloud computing is also a promising technology which
    can be incorporated to support strong computation and storage capabilities for
    smart city data, i.e big data from ubiquitous IoT devices. A cloud-smart city
    architecture is introduced in Yu et al. (2018b), wherein big data processing can
    be performed by cloud servers, while data auditing can be achieved by using the
    blockchain without third party auditors (TPAs). The proposed scheme focuses on
    building an optimized blockchain instantiation called data auditing blockchain
    (DAB) that collects auditing proofs and employs a consensus algorithm using a
    Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) protocol. The simulation results reveal
    the potential of the blockchain adoption for big data in smart city with lower
    communication costs and better security. Furthermore, blockchain can enable interconnection
    cloud service providers to achieve a larger scale computation service (Tseng et
    al., 2019). Any cloud server can be regarded as a blockchain node and cloud computing
    events are recorded on the ledgers, which effectively improves the system robustness
    and avoids the risks of single points of failures once the cloud server is compromised
    or attacked. 5.3. Smart transportation With the rapid development of modern 5G
    communication and computation technologies, recent years have witnessed a tremendous
    growth in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), which create significant impacts
    on various aspects of our lives with smarter transport facilities and vehicles
    as well as better transport services (Shah et al., 2018; Dong et al., 2017). Smart
    transportation is regarded as a key IoT application which is the integrated architectures
    of communication technologies and vehicular services. One critical issue in smart
    transportation is security risks caused by dynamic vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications
    in untrusted vehicular environments and reliance on centralized network authorities.
    Blockchain shed lights on several inherent features to implement distributed data
    storage, peer-to-peer communication, and transparently anonymous user systems,
    which envisions to build secure, decentralized ITS systems to facilitate customer
    transportations (Nguyen et al., 2019c). One of the most significant services to
    realize intelligent transportation is data transmission among vehicles. How to
    provide efficient data exchange services in terms of low latency and increased
    network throughput while still ensure high degrees of security is a critical challenge.
    Blockchain would enhance QoS of the current ITS system by offering a decentralized
    management platform, wherein all vehicles and road side units (RSU) can perform
    data transmission and sharing on a peer-to-peer model to reduce end-to-end delay
    without using a vehicular authority (Ren et al., 2019). In order to adapt the
    large volumes of electric vehicle (EV) charging/discharging demand during transportation,
    the blockchain concept is introduced in Liu et al. (2018e) that enables peer-to-peer
    transaction and decentralized storage to record all transaction data of EVs. In
    fact, EVs can be considered as a mobile power backup device to support the smart
    grid for load flattening, peak shaving and frequency regulation. This new energy
    trading paradigm is known as vehicle-to-grid (V2G), which is essential to build
    a safer and more sustainable energy platform for both EVs and the main power grid.
    Consumer power loads from smart city are all connected to the public blockchain
    power exchanging platform, where the electricity supply and user demand information
    are transmitted, encrypted and recorded in the blockchain platform. In such a
    context, the EV can publish and transmit the charging or discharging orders (for
    buying and selling) to the power blockchain platform which executes the EV request,
    performs energy trading and payment, and saves the transaction to the distributed
    ledger, which is also visible to every vehicle in the vehicular network. In the
    line of discussion, the authors in Zhou et al. (2019) also analyse a V2G energy
    trading model with a combination of blockchain and edge computing. EVs can buy
    energy from local energy aggregators (LEAGs) via trading. The vehicular communication
    is secured by a consortium blockchain, in which all the transactions are created,
    propagated, and verified by authorized LEAGs. To further reduce latency and processing
    posing on burden blockchain, edge computing servers are employed to undertake
    block creation and mining. LEAGs can buy computation services from edge computing
    providers to finalize this process, and store mined blocks to the nearby edge
    nodes. The blockchain technology envisions a trustless network to eliminate the
    operation cost of the intermediary participation, which will realize a quicker,
    safer and cheaper way in ITS systems. Moreover, authentication for vehicle access
    is of paramount importance for vehicular networks. In this regard, smart contract
    would be a notable approach which can authenticate and verify vehicular transactions
    by triggering the programmed logic functions (Guo et al., 2019b). This enables
    direct authentication for registered vehicles without revealing device privacy
    and effectively prevents potential attacks from malicious vehicles. Recently,
    blockchain has been used to build secured and controlled vehicular ad hoc networks
    (VANETs) (Zhang et al., 2019c). With the increasing scale of the current VANETs,
    traditional VANET frameworks with centralized control mechanisms obviously cannot
    match the diversification of VANET traffic requirements. Decentralizing controller
    can be an efficient solution to localize decision making to an individual controller,
    which thus minimizes the control plane response time to data plane requests. To
    achieve secure communications between controllers as well as between controllers
    and EVs, blockchain is leveraged to achieve agreement among different nodes in
    terms of traffic information and energy demands without using centralized trust
    management. Another aspect in VANETs is the security of power trading between
    EVs and V2G networks. In fact, it is very important to design a safe, efficient,
    transparent, information symmetrical trading model for VANETs to provide ubiquitous
    vehicular services (i.e. traffic transmission, vehicle cooperation, energy payment).
    Blockchain is introduced in Gao et al. (2018a) for a reliable decentralized power
    trading platform where a V2G EV trading smart contract is integrated for trading
    authentication and a decentralized energy ledger is for data storage and sharing
    without relying on a trusted third party, eliminating the need for trusted third
    parties to address the high cost, inefficiency, and insecure data storage of traditional
    centralized organizations. 5.4. Smart grid The continuously growing power demand
    in modern society has been a critical challenge that needs significant attention
    in the present day of the smart grid era. The energy industry has witnessed a
    paradigm shift in power delivery from a centralized production and distribution
    energy system into a dynamic mode of decentralized operation thanks to the support
    of ubiquitous 5G technologies such as IoT, edge/cloud computing, network slice
    and D2D communication (De Dutta and Prasad, 2019; Dragičević et al., 2019b). In
    this regard, blockchain, a decentralized database platform, enables completely
    new technological systems and business models for energy management with added
    features such as decentralization, security, privacy and transparency (Valtanen
    et al., 2019). In the 5G energy network slice, the electricity can be allocated
    to each power user in the housing society through a distributed blockchain platform
    where all users are interlinked with energy providers on secured and distributed
    ledgers. In smart grid, in order to monitor the electricity distribution and power
    usage of customers, a smart meter can be installed at each home to collect the
    real-time electricity consumption data for better smart home services. However,
    a critical drawback is that private user information such as home address, personal
    information may be disposed and adversaries can track users to obtain electricity
    consumption profile. To overcome this challenge, blockchain has been introduced
    in Guan et al. (2018) for a privacy-preserving and efficient data aggregation
    network. The power network has been divided into small groups, each group is controlled
    by a private blockchain. Instead of relying on a third party for data aggregation,
    a certain user is chosen to aggregate all user data within his network and record
    them to the blockchain for storage and monitoring. Such an aggregator only collects
    data and all other users share the equal right to verify and validate transactions
    to achieve consensus, which eliminates the risks of single points of failure and
    improves system trust accordingly. In order to achieve traceability of power delivery
    in smart grid, blockchain can be applied to provide transparency and provenance
    services (Gao et al., 2018b). The customer can register their information on blockchain
    and perform energy trading and payment by uploading a transaction to blockchain.
    By creating an immutable data structure, data recorded and transferred onto the
    system cannot be altered. Smart contracts are also very useful to provide a transparent
    and fair energy trading between consumers and utility companies through an energy
    policy which defines all trading rules. Once the energy billing payment is completed,
    for example, both the user and the service provider receive a copy of the transaction,
    which allows users to keep track of their energy usage. At present, the sophistication
    of cyberattacks has posed a challenge to the current smart power systems. In recent
    years, cyber-attacks have caused power systems blackout due to data vulnerability,
    malicious events or market data manipulation (Esfahani and Mohammed, 2018). Therefore,
    the introduction of blockchain, a strong security mechanism, can help overcome
    such challenges. The interactions between the electricity market agent and the
    customer are reflected via transactions which contain electricity demands, electricity
    price, user information. All such transactions are signed by the private key of
    the sender (i.e. energy user) to perform energy trading with the agent. In such
    a context, an attacker can threaten the communication link between users and the
    agent, but it may be impossible to break the transaction due to the lack of user
    private key and such malicious access is detected and discarded by consensus mining.
    Additionally, the authors in Singh and Choube (2018) also present a research effort
    in using blockchain to mitigate cyber-attacks on a smart grid. Every prosumer,
    consumer and substation are connected through a block chain based application
    under the control of a smart contract, which perform transaction verification
    when energy transmission occurs. The consensus is maintained by the computing
    power of all distributed energy servers and users, which also make the energy
    system well resistant to cyber-attacks (Lu et al., 2019b). In a similar direction,
    the work in Bansal et al. (2019) proposes a smart and scalable ledger framework
    for secure peer to peer energy trading in smart grid ecosystems. The energy network
    considered consists of a set of EVs which can participate in three operations,
    namely charging, discharging and staying idle, EV aggregator which works as an
    energy broker and provides access points to EVs for both charging and discharging
    operation, and energy cash as the currency for energy payment. To avoid the issue
    of spanning and Sybil attacks, instead of using PoW which remains high block generation
    latency, the authors suggest a proof of time concept. A client must collect a
    random token, i.e., random messages from neighbours, which makes the process costly
    for an attacker to achieve the throughput of honest transactions as each transaction
    contains associated timestamp with it. For security of energy transactions, another
    work in Hua and Sun (2019) also builds a fully decentralized blockchain-based
    peer-to-peer trading scheme, which realises a more secure transaction and reduced
    storage burden of distributed prosumers. Recently, mobile edge computing (MEC),
    a significant 5G enabling technology, is also cooperated with smart grid. Although
    MEC can offer promising benefits such as low-latency computation, reduced network
    congestion for better energy delivery, the characteristics inherent of the MEC
    architecture such as heterogeneity, mobility can be exploited by attackers to
    perform nefarious activities. Thus, how to ensure security for MEC-based smart
    grid system is important. In the work (Gai et al., 2019b), a permissioned blockchain
    edge model is introduced with the main objectives of privacy protections and energy
    security. At the layer of distributed edge devices and power supply, smart devices
    and power supply facilities compose smart grid generating electricity trading
    transactions. Meanwhile, the smart contract running on blockchain assigns tasks
    to edge devices and records transaction on blockchain, which enables a secure
    and trustworthy trading environment. By integrating with distributed edge computing,
    blockchain can offer a larger number of services, such as device configuration
    and governance, sensor data storage and management, and trading payments. Blockchain
    for edge-empowered smart grid has been considered in Wang et al. (2019e), in which
    a blockchain based mutual authentication and key agreement protocol is proposed.
    The smart grid network model used consists of registration authority (RA), end
    users (EUs), edge servers (ESs) and blockchain. ESs are responsible to supply
    timely data analysis and service delivery, and each ES is linked with blockchain
    to prevent web spoofing attacks and guarantee smooth energy trading and user interactions.
    The authors in Choubey et al. (2019) also present a blockchain implementation
    for smart grid to guarantee information privacy of energy user and energy trading.
    MEC servers act as active blockchain nodes with strong computation capabilities
    to enable fast data analytic services, i.e. processing large transaction graphs
    of energy trading, within the energy trading system among EVs. 5.5. Unmanned aerial
    vehicles (UAVs) The rapid development of drones or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)
    (Chi-Nguyen et al., 2018) is creating numerous new business opportunities for
    service providers. UAVs can be considered as flying IoT devices and have been
    used for various purposes, such as military, vehicular networks to smart city.
    In the era of 5G networks, the rapid growth of IoT data traffic poses critical
    challenges on current network infrastructure with static base stations (i.e. access
    point, router) to support data demands of billions of IoT devices for large-scale
    services. Therefore, using UAV for supporting IoT networks is a natural choice.
    Indeed, UAV can act as a flying base station to provide unprecedented IoT services,
    i.e. dynamic traffic offloading, object monitoring due to its mobility and flexibility.
    However, the operation of UAVs in the sky is highly vulnerable to several privacy
    and security risks that target data accountability, data integrity, data authorization,
    and reliability (Gupta et al., 2015). Recent years have also witnessed a new research
    trend on the combination of blockchain and UAVs for solving critical challenges
    in UAV networks and empowering new 5G IoT applications. For instance, the work
    in Qiu et al. (2019a) takes advantage of consortium blockchain for a spectrum
    sharing platform between the aerial and terrestrial communication systems for
    UAV-based cellular networks. The key idea is to establish the distributed shared
    database to perform secure spectrum trading and sharing between the mobile network
    operators (MNOs) and the UAV operators. The proposed model possibly addresses
    two key issues: security risks of UAV-based spectrum trading due to the unauthorized
    spectrum exploitations of malicious UAVs, and privacy leakages caused by the centralized
    sharing architecture with third parties. To support the security of UAV communication
    in ad hoc networks (UAANETs), permissioned blockchain has been adopted in Lei
    et al. (2019) to provide decentralized content storage services and detect internal
    attackers during efficient content dissemination. The key reason behind the blockchain
    adoption for UAANETs is the ability of blockchain to securely maintain a consistent
    and tamper-resistant ledger to record all the transactions of content sharing
    and storage in a decentralized environment without the need for any central authority,
    which is applicable to the complex and vulnerable network. Besides, to overcome
    the limitations of traditional blockchain models with low throughput and high
    resource consumption, an efficient and scalable Adaptive Delegate Consensus Algorithm
    (ADCA) is integrated to perform consensus without the mining procedures. Similarly,
    the work (Aggarwal et al., 2019b) also proposes to use blockchain for secure data
    dissemination in UAV networks. Data collected from UAVs can be recorded and stored
    in decentralized database ledgers to mitigate the storage burden on UAVs. The
    use of blockchain allows any of the users in the UAVs network to participate in
    consensus processes and implement verification without any external authorities,
    such as cloud servers. The proposed model has the potential to solve various security
    issues, including spoofing, Denial-of-service (DoS), eavesdropping and data tampering.
    The authors in Kapitonov et al. (2017) consider an autonomous economic system
    with UAVs where blockchain acts as a protocol of autonomous business activities
    in modern industrial and business processes. IoT devices, robots, UAVs in the
    multi-agent systems can exchange data each other to perform automatic collaborative
    works (i.e. in smart factory) and share collected data to users via a peer-to-peer
    ledger. Blockchain link all agents together to create a distributed network where
    any agent can join and perform block verification to maintain the correct operation
    and security of the system. To avoid the issues of data leakage or data loss during
    the transmission among UAVs, blockchain is also considered in Rana et al. (2019).
    The data transfer process occurs within the blockchain which allows storing all
    user information and exchange records for security management. More interesting,
    blockchain has been considered and incorporated with cloud/edge computing for
    enabling emerging UAV-based applications. The authors in Islam and Shin (2019)
    and Islam et al. (2019) analyse a blockchain-enabled secure data acquisition scheme
    for UAV swarm networks in which data are collected from IoT devices employing
    UAV swarms. Each of the UAVs maintains its own shared key to expedite communication
    with IoT devices when implementing the security mechanism (i.e., sign, verify,
    encrypt, and decrypt). A smart contract is also employed in order to handle the
    IoT devices and missions in data acquisition. The study in Jensen et al. (2019)
    also explores a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain design for UAV swarm networks. Each
    communication request among UAVs is recorded as a transaction which is validated
    and verified by the mining process enabled by the computing power of all entities
    in the UAV network for maintaining the blockchain. In an effort to enhance the
    security of edge-based UAV networks, the work in Sharma et al. (2019) proposes
    a neural blockchain-based transport model as Fig. 10 to ensure ultra-reliability
    for UAV communication and enable intelligent transport during UAV caching through
    user equipment (UE) via MEC. The blockchain acts as a distributed database ledger
    which is shared among all the involved entities (UAVs, MEC servers, and users)
    identified by their public keys (IDs). The smart contract is responsible to monitor
    user access and perform verification, while blockchain provides a secure data
    sharing environment to facilitate content sharing and data delivery between the
    UEs and the caching servers. Download : Download high-res image (700KB) Download

    et al., 2019). In addition, the authors in Youssef et al. (2019) integrate blockchain
    in a cloud-assisted UAV network for surveillance services to investigate the safety
    condition of the dam infrastructure in real-time. Two blockchains are designed,
    a public bitcoin blockchain for payment trading, and a private blockchain for
    data storage on the network of UAV providers, users, and cloud providers. To join
    the blockchain, each entity, i.e. IoT sensor users should have certificates obtained
    from a certificate authority. Data gathered from cloud providers is considered
    as an object which is then hashed and anchored by the UAV provider into the blockchain
    network. The solution using blockchain bring various benefits, including reduced
    latency due to direct communication without passing a third party, and high data
    integrity and tampering resistance thanks to the hash function and consensus process.

    6. Main findings, challenges and future research directions Integrating blockchain
    in the 5G mobile networks is a hot research topic now. Many research efforts have
    been devoted to the development of blockchain technology for 5G mobile networks.
    In the previous sections, we have presented a state of the art review on the current
    achievements in the blockchain adoption in 5G networks. Specially, we have provided
    an extensive discussion on the convergence of blockchain into key 5G enabling
    technologies, namely cloud computing, edge computing, Network Function Virtualization,
    Network Slicing, and D2D communication. The survey has also covered and highlighted
    the benefits of blockchain to empower fundamental 5G services such as spectrum
    management, data sharing, network virtualization, resource management, interference
    management, privacy and security services. We also analyse the integration of
    blockchain in a wide range of 5G IoT applications, ranging from smart healthcare,
    smart city, smart transportation to smart grid and UAVs. Based on the current
    great research efforts in the literature, in this section, we will summarize the
    key findings inherited from the integration of blockchain in 5G networks and services.
    We also identify possible research challenges and open issues in the field along
    with the future research directions that should be considered and investigated
    to encourage more innovative solutions and studies in this promising area. 6.1.
    Main findings The comprehensive literature review on the integration of blockchain
    in 5G technologies, 5G services and IoT applications reveals many important findings,
    which would enable to open up numerous opportunities for the newly emerging 5G
    scenarios. This sub-section will highlight the key findings inherited from the
    convergence of these promising technologies. 6.1.1. Blockchain for 5G technologies
    Blockchain can offer many promising technical properties such as decentralization,
    privacy, immutability, traceability, and transparency to empower 5G technologies.
    Reviewing the literature works, we find that blockchain can support well 5G technologies
    mainly from three key aspects, including security, system performance, and resource
    management. The current 5G technology infrastructure is mainly enabled by the
    centralized network settings, such as edge/cloud computing which obviously show
    security vulnerabilities due to the reliance of third parties. Blockchain can
    arrive to build decentralized network architectures for 5G technology platforms.
    For example, the concept of blockchain-based cloud computing enables decentralization
    of cloud/edge 5G networks (Yang et al., 2018b; Guo et al., 2019a) which gets rid
    of centralized control at the core network and offers a decentralized fair agreement
    with blockchain consensus platform. Even when an entity is compromised by malicious
    attacks or threats, the overall operation of the involved network is still maintained
    via consensus on distributed ledgers. More interesting, blockchain can help establish
    secure peer-to-peer communication among users (i.e. in D2D communication) using
    the computing power of all participants to operate the network instead of passing
    a third-party intermediary. This would potentially reduce communication latency,
    transaction costs, and provide the global accessibility for all users, all of
    which will enhance the overall system performance. However, there are still some
    natural limitations on the blockchain adoption in 5G technologies. For example,
    communication latency is a critical issue when integrating blockchain in 5G platforms.
    The authors in Yang et al. (2017, 2018a) indicate that if edge/cloud servers have
    to process multiple requests in parallel, including network user requests and
    blockchain requests for block data migration, which involves much synchronization
    overhead. Further, the high latency of blockchain due to transaction processing
    makes it challenging to its implementation for managing the authentication of
    virtual machine orchestration commands in network function virtualization systems
    (Rosa and Rothenberg, 2018) and network slicing (Hamoud et al., 2017). Developing
    optimized blockchain platforms may be needed for meeting requirements of low latency
    performance and smart contracts features in virtualized 5G technologies. 6.1.2.
    Blockchain for 5G services Blockchain is expected to facilitate the 5G services
    by adding security properties and simplification of service management. Blockchain
    is particularly useful to create secure sharing environments for spectrum or data
    exchange in the 5G mobile networks. Blockchain is regarded as a middle layer to
    perform spectrum trading, verify sharing transactions and lease securely the spectrum
    provided by spectrum resource providers, i.e. license holders. Different from
    the conventional database management systems which often use a centralized server
    to perform access authentication, blockchain with smart contracts can implement
    decentralized user access validation by using the computing power of all legitimate
    network participants. This makes the sharing system strongly resistant to data
    modifications. Many research studies on blockchain (Kotobi and Bilén, 2017; Grissa
    et al., 2019; Bayhan et al., 2019; Bayhan et al., 2018) demonstrate that the blockchain
    adoption is beneficial to spectrum management in terms of better scalability,
    power efficiency in spectrum usage, improved accessibility with high degree of
    security and better system protection capability against DoS attacks and threats.
    Besides, blockchain can simplify the network virtualization in 5G networks with
    high degrees of security (Rawat, 2019; Alvarenga et al., 2018). The blockchain
    technology can provide the required characteristics of nonrepudiation and immutability
    to overcome the shortcomings of the previous centralized configuration settings
    in virtual networks. More precisely, blockchain is capable of creating secure
    virtual wireless networks (VWNs) so that wireless resource-owners sublease their
    wireless resources (e.g., slice of RF spectrum, infrastructure) to mobile virtual
    network operators (MVNOs). In such a decentralized virtual network, smart contracts
    can be very useful to provide automation and transparency in a distributed way
    instead of trusting a particular node or an authority process transactions, which
    also enhances the trustworthiness of the resource management services. The building
    of a fair and trusted economic scheme empowered by blockchain can be a notable
    solution for network interference control, especially in small cell deployments
    (El Gamal and El Gamal, 2019). Also, we should admit that blockchain-based approaches
    would have its natural limitation in 5G services. The complexity of blockchain
    operations, including blockchain mining and block generation, makes 5G services
    less efficient. For instance, blockchain mining can cause unnecessary offloading
    latency in the mobile data offloading process (Liu et al., 2019a), which also
    raises the question of using blockchain for 5G (Yang et al., 2019c). How to use
    blockchain to protect data privacy while minimizing its impact on the involved
    5G services is worth to be considered. More importantly, the use of public blockchain
    which always allows to broadcast data to everyone on the network that raises privacy
    issues (Qamar et al., 2019). Network resource information including QoS demands,
    user data can be exposed to the attacks and hence damage data integrity (Li et
    al., 2019b). Therefore, further investigations on blockchain adoption in 5G services
    should be considered. 6.1.3. Blockchain for 5G IoT applications Blockchain has
    been investigated and integrated into a number of key 5G IoT applications, such
    as smart healthcare, smart city, smart transportation, smart grid and UAVs. The
    integration of blockchain with 5G technologies can advance current IoT systems
    and provide more performance benefits in terms of better decentralization, security,
    privacy, service efficiency and system simplification for lower operational costs
    (Cech et al., 2019). For example, blockchain has been demonstrated its high efficiency
    in healthcare and smart city scenarios. By implementing a direct and secure interconnection
    in a network of users, service providers (i.e. hospital in healthcare or traffic
    control units in smart transportation) and network operators, the data sharing,
    resource sharing and cooperative communication can be achieved in a secure and
    low-latency manner. Importantly, the sharing of data over the untrusted environments
    is highly vulnerable to cyber-attacks, which can monitor and obtain the user information
    profile (patient information in healthcare of customer data in smart grid). Blockchain
    comes as a notable solution to address such challenges by securing the transaction
    and verifying the user access. Recent years have also witnessed a new research
    trend on the combination of blockchain and UAVs for solving critical challenges
    in UAV networks and empowering new 5G IoT applications. UAV with its high mobility
    and flexibility can be a promising transmission solution for aerial and terrestrial
    communication systems, but it also remains critical challenges in terms of security
    due to adversaries and short battery life. Blockchain would be notable to solve
    such challenges. Recent studies show the feasibility of blockchain in UAV networks
    (Qiu et al., 2019a; Lei et al., 2019; Aggarwal et al., 2019b). UAV can collect
    data from the IoT devices and offload data to the blockchain, where data is hashed
    and recorded securely on the ledger. This would not only preserve IoT data against
    threats but also reduce the data storage burden on UAV, which is promising to
    prolong the duration of UAV operations for better service delivery. However, the
    deployment of blockchain on IoT networks shows some potential challenges. Due
    to the resource constraints of IoT devices, it is challenging to run blockchain
    on IoT networks. Further, IoT devices might not be capable of storing large databases
    due to blockchain implementation (De Dutta and Prasad, 2019). In IoT-based applications
    such as smart health that urgently needs low-latency communication to meet QoS
    and QoE requirements, the limitations of blockchain in terms of overhead can prohibit
    the adoption of blockchain in such 5G services (Damianou et al., 2019). Recently,
    blockchain has been incorporated with UAVs, but their mobility and complex communications
    over the sky, the ability of blockchain to securely maintain a consistent and
    tamper-resistant ledger to record all the transactions of UAV communications is
    challenged (Kim et al., 2018). Designing a flexible aerial-ground blockchain model
    can be useful in such complex systems. 6.2. Challenges and open issues At present,
    the amalgamation of blockchain and 5G networks has been received widespread research
    interests from academics and industries. The blockchain technology is promising
    to revolutionize 5G networks and services by offering the newly emerging features
    such as decentralization, privacy, and security. The arrival of this emerging
    technology is potential to change the current shape of 5G infrastructure and transform
    industrial network architectures with advanced blockchain-5G paradigms. However,
    the throughout survey on the use of blockchain for 5G networks also reveals several
    critical research challenges and open issues that should be considered carefully
    during the system design. We analyse them from four main aspects: integration
    challenge, blockchain scalability, blockchain security, and QoS limitations, which
    will be analysed in details as follows. 6.2.1. Challenges of the blockchain and
    5G integration The blockchain and 5G integration currently face some critical
    challenges that need to be considered before deployment. First, there is a lack
    of infrastructure in existing 5G systems for blockchain integration. Most of 5G
    wireless operators set up their systems to target popular network services such
    as smart city, smart health, supply chain without giving necessary infrastructure
    such as decentralized network architectures, smart contract software for blockchain
    integration in 5G (Blockchain Transforms 5G: Opportunities and Challenges). Furthermore,
    the lack of standardization and regulations also pose critical challenges for
    the blockchain and 5G integration (Anjum et al., 2017). The current operations
    of blockchain are de-standardized and de-regulated due to the lack of collaboration
    of blockchain companies and governments. Without having standardization, it is
    very challenging to adopt blockchain in real-world 5G networks which need to be
    solved before blockchain realization in 5G. 6.2.2. Blockchain performance and
    scalability Despite the benefits of blockchain, scalability and performance issues
    of are major challenges in the integrated blockchain-5G ecosystems. Here, we analyse
    the scalability issues of blockchain from the perspectives of throughput, storage
    and networking. • Throughput: In fact, blockchain has much lower throughput in
    comparison to non-blockchain applications. For instance, Bitcoin processes a maximum
    of only 4 transactions/seconds, and the number for Ethereum is 20 transactions/seconds,
    while Visa processes 1667 transactions/second (Monrat et al., 2019). Obviously,
    the current blockchain systems have serious scalability bottlenecks in terms of
    the number of replicas and the performance concerns such as constrained throughput
    (number of transactions/second) and transaction latency (Kim et al., 2018). Many
    blockchains suffer from a long queueing time for transactions to be added to the
    chain due to the block size restriction. Therefore, when the block generation
    time increases rapidly, the overall system throughput can reduce. • Storage: When
    using blockchain in 5G networks, a huge quantity of data generated by ubiquitous
    IoT devices is processed by the blockchain for 5G services such as data sharing,
    resource management and user transaction monitoring. In the conventional blockchain
    systems, each blockchain node must process and store a copy of the complete transaction
    data. This can pose a storage and computation burden on resource-constrained IoT
    devices to participate in the blockchain network. (Wang et al., 2019f). • Networking:
    Blockchain networking is another issue that also affects the scalability of blockchain
    systems. Blockchain is computationally expensive and requires significant bandwidth
    resources to perform computational mining puzzle. However, in the 5G scenarios,
    such as ultra-dense networks where resource is very limited due to the demands
    from IoT devices and service operators, it may be impossible to meet resource
    requirement for blockchain to achieve large scale transaction processing. Further,
    stemming from the property of blockchain consensus mechanisms which require multiple
    transaction transmissions among nodes to validate a block, the blockchain operation
    needs to consume much network resources (i.e. bandwidth, mining power, and transmission
    power), which also results in high network latency (Xie et al., 2019b). The increasing
    complexity in 5G IoT network makes blockchain platforms difficult to process high
    data volumes. The end-to-end latency in 5G networks is expected to achieve less
    than 1 ms (Panwar et al., 2016) for payload and data transmissions. This vision
    requires careful considerations in designing blockchain platforms before integrating
    into 5G systems. Many research efforts have been dedicated to improving the performance
    and scalability in blockchain from different design perspectives such as mining
    hardware design (Sanka and Cheung, 2018), hybrid consensus protocols (Hazari and
    Mahmoud, 2019), on-chain and off-chain solutions (Ali et al., 2018c; Xiong and
    Xiong, 2019). Very recently, a solution using 5G network virtualization is also
    considered (Yu, 2018) to solve scalability of blockchain by decoupling the blockchain
    management from the transaction processing to improve QoS of blockchain operations.
    The preliminary results are expected to shed light on the blockchain research
    for solving scalability issues and improving the system performance in integrated
    blockchain 5G networks. 6.2.3. Blockchain security and privacy Blockchain is considered
    as secure database platform to ensure safety and privacy for involved 5G networks.
    However, recent researches have revealed inherent security weaknesses in blockchain
    which are mostly related to 5G systems (Li et al., 2017). A critical security
    issue is 51% attack which means a group of blockchain miners manages more than
    50% of the network computation power, which thereby hinder from transacting successfully
    the block and mining it on blockchain. More importantly, adversaries can exploit
    this weakness to gain dominance on the blockchain to modify or alter the content
    of transactions (Li et al., 2017). In addition to that, the operations of smart
    contracts also show some security concerns, such as privacy leakage or system
    logic modifications (Rouhani and Deters, 2019b; Wohrer and Zdun, 2018). All of
    these issues would add more security concerns to blockchain-involved 5G networks
    (Miller et al., 2017). Security problems in blockchain in 5G networks can be solved
    by recent security improvements. For example, a mining pool system called SmartPool
    (Luu et al., 2017) was proposed to improve the validation performance for transaction
    in blockchain mining, which potentially mitigates security bottlenecks, such as
    51% vulnerability. Especially, recent works (Cheng et al., 2019; Tsankov et al.,
    2018) introduced some powerful security analysis tools to investigate and evaluate
    threat potential for ensuring security of smart contracts. These efforts would
    improve security of blockchain 5G environments and enhance the overall performance
    of the system. 6.2.4. QoS limitations With the advances of mobile 5G technologies,
    blockchain now can be implemented in mobile devices to provide more flexible blockchain-based
    solutions for 5G IoT applications. The foundation of the efficient and secure
    operation of blockchain is a computation process known as mining. In order to
    append a new transaction to the blockchain, a blockchain user, or a miner, needs
    to run a mining puzzle, i.e. Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) which
    is generally complicated and requires vast computing and storage resources. Further,
    blockchain also requires network bandwidth resources to perform its consensus
    process. Without a careful design, the blockchain implementation to operate involved
    IoT applications may lead to Quality of Service (QoS) degradation with long latency,
    high energy consumption, high bandwidth demands, and high network congestion.
    Obviously, the integration of blockchain can introduce new QoS challenges that
    would negatively impact the overall performance of blockchain-5G networks. It
    is noting that one of the most important goals of future 5G is to provide user-centric
    values with high QoS to satisfy the growing demands of user traffic and emerging
    services (Panwar et al., 2016). Therefore, it is vitally important to develop
    efficient solutions that can enhance service qualities of blockchain ecosystems
    to empower the future blockchain-5G networks. Recently, some strategies have been
    proposed to solve the above issues from different perspectives. On the one hand,
    the design of lightweight blockchain platforms can be a notable solution to enhance
    the QoS, by eliminating computation consensus mechanisms of blockchain (Dorri
    et al., 2017), compressing consensus storage (Kim et al., 2019a), or designing
    lightweight block validation techniques (Liu et al., 2019b; Zaman et al., 2019;
    Le and Mutka, 2019). These solutions potentially simplify the blockchain mining
    process for lower energy consumption and better latency efficiency, which make
    greats contributions to the QoS improvements in blockchain-5G applications. On
    the other hand, computation offloading is also another feasible approach to solve
    the low QoS issues of blockchain. With the development of 5G technologies such
    as edge/cloud computing, D2D communication, blockchain computation tasks (i.e.
    consensus puzzle) can be offloaded to resourceful servers such as edge/cloud servers
    (Xiong et al., 2018b; Qiu et al., 2019b) by combining defined networks (Sharma
    et al., 2017b) and D2D communication (Seng et al., 2019) to bridge the gap between
    constrained resources of local mobile devices and growing demands of executing
    the computation tasks. By using offloading solutions, the performance of blockchain-5G
    systems would be improved significantly, such as saving system energy, reducing
    computation latency and improving the quality of computation experience for mobile
    devices. As a result, the system QoS will be enhanced while blockchain features
    are ensured for high level network security. The offloading optimization solutions
    should be explored further to balance both blockchain and the core 5G networks
    for future mobile blockchain-5G applications. 6.3. Future research directions
    Motivated by our detailed survey on research studies on the convergence of blockchain
    and 5G networks, we point out possible research directions which should be considered
    in the future works. 6.3.1. From simulation to implementation Reviewing the literature,
    most of the blockchain platforms conceived for 5G networks are in their simulation
    stages. Thus, the researchers and practitioners need to further improve blockchain
    architectures before they are realized in real-world 5G networks. We here propose
    some solutions that can be considered in practical blockchain-5G systems. First,
    the 5G wireless operators can incorporate with blockchain companies for large-scale
    blockchain deployment on the existing 5G platforms. For example, Ethereum blockchain
    has been integrated with 5G cloud platform on Amazon (Amazon Partners On New Ethereum
    Marketplace For Enterprises), which facilitates the business operations (i.e.
    5G supply chain, IoT applications) of enterprises for production efficiency and
    security enhancement. Moreover, regulatory rules should be provided so that blockchain
    implementation can be realized (Unal et al., 2020). Many 5G network operators
    and businesses are slow to adopt blockchain-based systems because they fear potential
    government regulations might require them to make expensive or difficult changes
    in their network architectures in the future. Once the legal issues are solved,
    the integration of blockchain in 5G networks can be accelerated to create newly
    emerging network services. 6.3.2. Integrating machine learning with blockchain
    for 5G The revolution of machine learning (ML) technology transforms current 5G
    services by providing a learning ability to provide data-driven insights for supporting
    decision-making tasks or data predictions. The advances of ML would facilitate
    blockchain-5G services in the future networks. For instance, ML can provide a
    solution for facilitating resource management and user communication. ML also
    exhibits great potential on data feature discovery to predict data usage behaviour
    for developing control algorithms, such as data traffic estimation for network
    congestion avoidance or user access tracking for privacy preservation. Recent
    years, there is an increasing trend of combining machine learning with blockchain
    for 5G use case domains. For example, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) (Dai et
    al., 2019) has been investigated and combined with blockchain to enable secure
    and intelligent resource management and orchestration in 5G networks. An advanced
    DRL algorithm is proposed to design the algorithms of optimizing channel association,
    interference control and resource management. Other significant works also propose
    the integrated blockchain-DRL architectures for flexible and secure computation
    offloading, reliable network channel selection (Luong et al., 2019), and networking
    optimization (Liu et al., 2019c). 6.3.3. Blockchain for big data in 5G In the
    age of data explosion, big data has become a hot research topic in 5G (Kibria
    et al., 2018). A large amount of ubiquitous data generated from 5G IoT devices
    can be used for giving birth to data-related applications, for example, data analytics,
    data extraction empowered by artificial intelligence solutions (Cárdenas et al.,
    2013). Currently, big data technologies have suffered from security vulnerabilities,
    such as data privacy breach, data integrity and big data processing security risks
    (Sultan et al., 2018). Further, big data analytics on cloud/edge computing are
    also highly vulnerable to cyberattacks in the complex operational and business
    environments. Blockchain can be a promising solution to cope with security challenges
    in big data (Karafiloski and Mishev, 2017). More specifically, blockchain can
    ensure immutability and transparency for big data processing and analytics. Recently,
    some big data models enabled by blockchain are proposed, such as data sharing
    with smart contracts (Yue et al., 2017), access control for big data security
    (Uchibeke et al., 2018), or privacy preservation for big data analytics (Lampropoulos
    et al., 2019). These results demonstrate the efficiency of the use of blockchain
    for security and performance enhancement to big data applications in the age of
    5G. In summary, blockchain has provided enormous opportunities to 5G mobile networks
    thanks to its exceptional security properties. The convergence of blockchain and
    5G technologies has reshaped and transformed the current 5G service provisions
    with security guarantees. This detailed survey is expected to pave a way for new
    innovative researches and solutions for empowering the future blockchain-5G networks.
    7. Conclusions and discussions Blockchain is an emerging technology that has drawn
    significant attention recently and is recognized as one of the key enablers for
    5G networks thanks to its unique role to security assurance and network performance
    improvements. In this paper, we have explored the opportunities brought by blockchain
    to empower the 5G systems and services through a state-of-the-art survey and extensive
    discussions based on the existing literature in the field. This work is motivated
    by the lack of a comprehensive review on the integration of blockchain and 5G
    networks. In this article, we have presented a comprehensive survey focusing on
    the current state-of-the-art achievements in the integration of blockchain into
    5G wireless networks. Particularly, we have first provided a brief overview on
    the background knowledge of blockchain and 5G networks and highlighted the motivation
    of the integration. We have then explored and analysed in detail the potential
    of blockchain for enabling key 5G technologies, such as cloud computing, edge
    computing, Network Function Virtualization, Network Slicing, and D2D communication.
    A comprehensive discussion on the use of blockchain in a wide range of popular
    5G services has been provided, with a prime focus on spectrum management, data
    sharing, network virtualization, resource management, interference management,
    federated learning, privacy and security services. Our survey has also covered
    a holistic investigation on the applications of blockchain in 5G IoT networks
    and reviews the latest developments of the cooperated blockchain-5G IoT services
    in various significant use-case domains, ranging from smart healthcare, smart
    city, smart transportation to smart grid and UAVs. Through the comprehensive survey
    on the related articles, we have summarized the main findings derived from the
    integrations of blockchain in 5G networks and services. Finally, we have pointed
    out several research challenges and outlined potential research directions. Through
    the state-of-the-art survey, we have found that the blockchain and 5G integration
    are mainly implemented via simulations, testbeds, and experiments. The research
    results from recent efforts demonstrate the great potential of blockchain in various
    practical 5G areas, ranging from 5G technology improvement (i.e. blockchain-cloud
    combination, blockchain-SDN adoption) to 5G services (such as blockchain-based
    data offloading, blockchain-empowered spectrum sharing) and 5G IoT (such as blockchain-based
    smart city). The main lessons acquired from the review of the use of blockchain
    in 5G networks are highlighted as follows. • First, blockchain promises to enhance
    the security and privacy of 5G ecosystems, by offering many promising technical
    properties such as decentralization, privacy, immutability, traceability, and
    transparency. Blockchain can eliminate the centralized network management concept
    by decentralizing the network infrastructure where there are no third party authorities
    needed. • Second, the use of blockchain also potentially improves the performances
    of 5G systems. In comparison to traditional database platforms such as SQL, blockchain
    can provide better data storage and management services with low latency data
    retrieval. In fact, resource requests (i.e. data access) can be verified by decentralized
    blockchain nodes with the support of intelligent smart contracts without passing
    a centralized authority, which is promising to reduce network latency. Moreover,
    motivated by the removal of decentralization, blockchain is able to establish
    direct communications between 5G service providers and mobile users so that the
    management cost can be significantly reduced. • Finally, blockchain can simplify
    the 5G network deployments thanks to its decentralized architectures. Indeed,
    by leveraging blockchain, the mobile operators now can have no worries about the
    establishment of centralized control servers. The 5G service delivery can be achieved
    by the blockchain network where user access, service responses and service trading
    (i.e. resource trading and payment) can be implemented on the decentralized ledgers
    among network participants including service providers and mobile users without
    the need for additional management infrastructure. Research on blockchain for
    5G wireless networks is still in its infancy. But it is obvious that blockchain
    will significantly uplift the shape and experience of future mobile services and
    applications. We believe our timely study will shed valuable light on the research
    of the blockchain-5G integration topics as well as motivate the interested researchers
    and practitioners to put more research efforts into this promising area. Declaration

    most mandatory mechanisms of Cognitive Radio (CR) to find the unused Spectrum.
    Spectrum sensing has renewed on a very active scrutiny area over recent years.
    As it is one of the most important tasks performed using cognitive radio and the
    implementation of the other functions of the cognitive radio is based on the spectrum
    sensing. So it is mandatory for cognitive radio to perform this task very decisively.
    This paper presents an overview of spectrum sensing, CR architecture, techniques
    on the basis of research, discusses the characteristics and challenges related
    to its different aspects of a CR. Multipath routing based spectrum sensing has
    been proposed and used widely since it doesn''t require dispatched signal properties,
    channel information, or even the type of modulation. Published in: 2016 Second

    Location: Chennai, India I. Introduction The intent behind cognitive radio was
    first presented officially in an article done by Joseph Mitola III and Gerald
    Q. Maguire and Jr in 1999. Currently, cognitive radio (CR) is great interest to
    technologists mainly because of significantly increasing in the overall usage
    of spectrum efficiency. From the date of publishing paper by Joseph on CR [1],
    30 specially issued scientific journals and nearly 80 dedicated conferences and
    workshops custom to CR [2]. Cognitive radio (CR) is one of the new long term headway
    taking place in radio communications technology. CR and cognitive radio technology
    will be the next major step forward enabling more constructive radio communications
    systems to be developed. This is still an very fresh and most interesting research
    topic, therefore many technical exploration questions still need to be answered.

    behavior affects 5G mobile cognitive radio networks performance, in term of devices
    lifetime and energy conservation. Maximization of the lifetime and reduction of

    the queuing delay. In this work, we study two types of queues used in 5G networks:
    First-in-First-out (FIFO) and Modified Deficit Round-Robin (MDRR). Simulation
    results demonstrate that MDRR has better performance over FIFO in most metrics,

    I. Introduction The demand for high throughput and low delay for multimedia applications
    in mobile nodes creates the need for 4G wireless communication systems. 4G systems
    have many improvements over the previous mobile generations. Later on, with the
    increasing demand for higher throughput, lower delay, the existence of powerful
    mobile nodes and higher number of users, the demand for newer system has emerged.
    Thus, researchers around the world is collaborating to create a new generation
    of wireless communication systems (5G). 5G generation is proposed to accommodate
    challenges that 4G could not unravel, such as spectrum crisis, high-energy consumption,
    higher data rate and high mobility. For such technology, with very high expectations
    and services never seen before, several requirements 5G must achieve, such as
    system capacity, coverage, availability, higher data rate, reduction in energy
    usage, and latency reduction ru [1]. The vision behind 5G technology is the provision
    of unlimited data and services for everyone using the evolved radio access technologies
    by enhancing and completing the existing wireless communication technologies with
    emerging radio access technologies for specific network deployment and usage [2].
    In 5G mobile network, there is an ability to exploit un-der-utilized radio spectrum
    portions, such as TV white space (TVWS). TVWS includes a large portion of available
    regional level radio spectrum to support the design and deployment of low power
    and low cost mobile system on propagation conditions. To reduce the investment
    cost and provide low priced services, 5G mobile network is deployed over TVWS
    to enable network operators to cover large geographical areas with lower number
    of base stations [4]. One of the most important issues facing the design of 5G
    mobile networks is energy efficiency issue. The formation of such emerging technology
    implies huge energy consumption in the operator''s systems and users'' mobile
    devices. To meet the optimal energy consumption in the end-to-end path, an efficient
    methodology should combine the temporal bandwidth aware behavior of the node with
    access policy using both mobile peer exchange mode and radio access mode [4].
    The motivitions behind this paper is to shed a glimpse of light on two queuing
    systems suggested for 5G to determine the effects of such models on overall delay
    and energy consumption to determine the better one to be used in 5G networks.
    The rest of this paper is organized as follows, section II describes queuing methods
    related works. Section III presents the methodology for our work, while section
    IV explains experiments and simulation results. Section V concludes our work.
    SECTION II. Related Work Toward the increasing interest in the deployment of 5G
    technology in the network, several issues should be addressed, considering different
    perspectives such as the mass increase of data traffic congestion, and the number
    of connected mobile devices. Increasing the network lifetime is a critical design
    issue for 5G mobile network technologies. Network nodes operate on limited energy
    resources; thus, the main objective is to maximize their lifetime. Hence, energy
    consumed by mobile devices and resources management framework poses a great challenge
    for wireless access technology planning developers. As proposed in [4], 5G mobile
    cognitive radio network architecture shows efficient TVWS exploitation and maximum
    energy conservation. This architecture includes first-in-first-out (FIFO) queuing
    delay in the measurement of the overall delay, with system consists of three submodules,
    spectrum broker that coordinate TVWS management, 5G mobile base stations, and
    radio resources management module in charge of matching requests from 5G base
    station with the available TVWS, according to the quality of service requirements.
    The optimum energy-efficient path during the resource exchange requests is the
    responsibility of the energy controller and it is measured through the streaming
    path lifetime maximization model (SPLM). SPLM scheme used to keep network nodes
    alive as long as possible by evaluating each path using tables for the remaining
    energy on each node to choose the optimal path for resource sharing process [4].
    When a request from the 5G base station is initiated, the spectrum broker informs
    the 5G base station about the available parts of TVWS and the price of these available
    parts, including spectrum portfolio and price portfolio. Next, the 5G base station
    sends a request about the available radio spectrum portions to the spectrum broker
    to collect them in the radio resources management module maximizing node''s lifetime
    and reducing delay [4]. Authors of [5] estimate queuing delay distribution on
    the internet link carrying TCP traffic, caused by transmitting a huge number of
    files in long tail distribution connections. Three queuing methods were tested
    in [6]: FIFO, Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ) and Priority Queuing (PQ). Results based
    on network routing, routing delay, network throughput and CPU/memory usage prove
    that PQ does not need high specification on memory or CPU. It was noted that this
    mechanism is unfair, it serves one application at a time increasing the delay
    and FIFO has a smaller delay than the PQ. Using device-to-device (D2D) communications
    by redefining the existing resources with efficient scheduling methodology, higher
    gains can be obtained as [7]. In this work, they proved that using Round Robin
    algorithm (RR) enhances the channel efficiency and accomplishes higher transmission
    rates. In [8], Weighted Round Robin (WRR) to minimize total end-to-end delay in
    the system on chip (SoC) compared with RR was used. Their system is based on network
    calculus method [9]. They proved that WRR has a better delay than RR. However,
    considering that 5G mobile networks adaptation is associated with energy consumption
    is proposed in [10] and [11]. Energy efficiency as a vital issue towards low energy
    consumption levels and low network operation cost, even with a massive increase
    of data traffic was proposed in [12]. The main characteristics of a 5G mobile
    network technology to support up to 25Mb/scene is presented in [13]. For wireless
    networks throughput and delay enhancement using RR method with time-since-last-service
    (TSLS) counter optimal performance is achieved an excellent delay is discussed
    in [14]. The proposed works in [15] and [16] provide detailed analysis on energy
    consumption reduction of mobile devices and the increase of inter-con-nected devices
    in the mobile access network. SECTION III. Methodology In this section, our work
    is based on a system of 5G mobile cognitive radio network architecture for maximum
    energy conservation. For high energy conservation in any network system, the conservation
    should be applied to each node in that system. On the node level, the most important
    value to maximize in order to accomplish that goal is the node lifetime, where
    the network lifetime is the time from network start to the time to the depletion
    of the first node energy. Streaming path lifetime maximization (SPLM) scheme is
    a concept implemented by [4] to estimate the energy efficiency of each energy
    model subsystem by the allocation of the optimal energy aware path, either through
    radio resource management module or peer-to-peer resource exchange process. After
    the system reserved the available TVWS spectrum with the optimal path and the
    specific constraint as the node request. Fig. 1 Streaming path. Show All The measurement
    of the total power, lifetime, and energy consumed in each node in the path includes
    the queuing delay, based on the incoming traffic and the average service time
    using FIFO approach as in [3]. For example, if we assume that the path from node
    A to node D is the optimal path chosen by the system as in Fig. 1. Thus, the totals
    queuing delay is the summation of delay in node B (δNB) , node C (δNC) ) and from
    node D (δND) . Our study based on the fact that the node lifetime is inversely
    proportional to the value of queuing delay, so to minimize the queuing delay we
    used MDRR approach rather than FIFO. FIFO queuing has a basic principle that the
    first packet arrives at a router is the first packet to be transmitted. We used
    MDRR as a scheduling algorithm for the network, hoping for more fairness at scheduling
    the nodes in the queue. MDRR scheduler handles N flows, each queue has several
    bytes that can transmit at each turn and the remaining if any, is reported to
    the next turn and that number called quantum. First, MDRR scans all nonempty queues
    in sequence, the algorithm keeps an auxiliary list called the Active List, that
    contains indices of queues that have at least one packet and to avoid examining
    empty queues. Then, selects a non-empty queue and the deficit counter of that
    queue is incremented by its quantum value that makes the deficit counter the maximum
    number of bytes that can be sent at each turn. Next, we check if the value of
    deficit counter is greater than packet size at the head of the queue if so, we
    can send that packet and decrement the deficit counter value by the packet size.
    For the next turn, the size of the next packet is compared to the new counter
    value and so on to the end of the queue. Once the queue is empty the scheduler
    will skip to the next queue and remove the queue from the active list and set
    the value of the deficit counter to 0. Bear in mind, for the active list when
    an empty queue arrives, a packet and index of that queue added to the list. SECTION
    IV. Simulation Results and Discussion As a simulation tool, we used OPNET (Optimized
    Network Engineering Tool), OPNET is extensive and powerful simulation tool environment
    for building, performance analysis for different types of networks with various
    protocols [17]. Under Windows environment, we used OPNET simulator version 17.5
    with 802.11n 5.0GHZ (high throughput) as a maximum limitation of technology used,
    65 (base)/ 600 Mbps as maximum data rate and 1 packet/sec as packet sending rate.
    This scenario measures the performance of cloud network that contains four subnets
    (China, London, Malaysia, and Cameroon), one router and one cloud. China and Malaysia
    subnets are the same and contain ten Ethernet workstations connected to one Ethernet
    switch, two routers called (Cisco C3 600 Router) and one firewall. Cameroon and
    London subnets are also the same, with seven Ethernet workstations, four Ethernet
    servers connected to Ethernet switch, two routers called (Cisco C3600 Router)
    and one firewall. The main router in each subnet connected to the router (Cisco
    C4000 Router) outside subnets, where this router is connected directly to subnets
    and to IP cloud by PPP_DS1 link, all Ethernet workstations are connected to the
    switches by bi-directional 10Base_T links. Network performance is analyzed for
    four applications: database server with a heavy load, Email server with a heavy
    load, FTP server with a heavy load and the HTTP server with a heavy load. Fig.
    2 shows network model for this scenario, simulation time is 1 hour. The results
    are shown and discussed in the next section. Fig. 2 Network structure. Show All
    Application configuration node, profile configuration node, and QoS attribute
    node are used. Application configuration node is used to configure all network
    applications for all services needed by clients, profile configuration node used
    to define client profiles, where each profile can contain one or more applications,
    and QoS attribute node used to define queuing methods that network will run according
    to. A. Simulation Results for Overall System 1. Average Ethernet Delay Fig. 3.1,
    Shows Ethernet average delay. When network has enough load, MDRR start to achieve
    better average delay. On average, MDRR achieve 0.005848 and FIFO achieve in 0.0065
    for minimum average delay. Thus, in this scenario MDRR achieve better delay. Fig.
    3.1 Ethernet average delay (sec) for FIFO and mdrr. Show All 2. Packet Delivery
    Ratio in Database Query Fig. 3.2, shows the average traffic sent and received
    in database query. MDRR achieve 16.839 (packet/sec) compared with FIFO with 9.637
    (packet/sec), MDRR achieve 5.613 (packet/sec) compared with FIFO with 3.212 (packet/sec)
    as maximum average traffic received value. As a result, MDRR has better average
    traffic sent and received over FIFO in database query. Fig. 3.2 Average traffic
    sent and received in database query. Show All 3. Packet Delivery Ratio in Email
    Fig. 3.3, shows the average traffic sent and received (packet/sec) in Email. MDRR
    achieve 4.1667 (packet/sec) compared to FIFO with 2.3889 packet/sec as maximum
    average traffic sent and received values. Thus, MDRR average traffic sent and
    received is better than FIFO in Email. Fig. 3.3 Average traffic sent and received
    (packet/sec) in email. Show All 4. Packet Delivery Ratio in Ftp Fig. 3.4, shows
    the average traffic sent and received (packet/sec) in FTP. MDRR achieve 1.2778
    (packet/sec) compared with FIFO that achieve 0.9167 (packet/sec) as maximum average
    traffic sent value, and MDRR achieves 0.5278 (packet/sec) compared to FIFO of
    0.3333 (packet/sec) maximum average traffic received value. MDRR achieve better
    average traffic sent and received over FIFO in FTP. Fig. 3.4 Average traffic sent
    and received in ftp. Show All B. Between Malysia and Cisco Router 4000 Fig. 4.1
    Average point-to-point delay. Show All 1. Point-To-Point Queuing Delay Fig. 4.1,
    shows average queuing delay (sec). In this case, MDRR achieves better delay compared
    to FIFO. MDRR achieve 0.000518 (sec) where FIFO achieve 0.000539 (sec) minimum
    value of queuing delay. 2. Point-To-Point Throuehput Fig. 4.2 shows average point-to-point
    throughput (packet/sec) for both in-going and out-going for MDRR and FIFO, MDRR
    throughput is better than FIFO. Fig. 4.2 Average point-to-point throughput. Show
    All 3. Average Point-To-Point Utilization Fig. 4.3, when throughput (data transfer
    rate) is better, utilization (the ratio of current network traffic to the maximum
    traffic that the port can handle) will be better too. So MDRR achieve better throughput,
    it will achieve better utilization too than FIFO. Fig. 4.3 Average point-to-point
    utilization. Show All C. Between Cameroon and Cisco Router 4000 1. Point-To-Point
    Queuing Delay Fig. 5.1, shows average queuing delay (sec). In this case MDRR achieve
    better delay than FIFO. MDRR achieve 0.001302 (sec) where FIFO achieve 0.001447
    (sec) as minimum value of queuing delay. Fig. 5.1 Average point-to-point delay.
    Show All 2. Point-To-Point Throughput Fig. 5.2, shows average point-to-point throughput
    (packet/sec) for both in-going and out-going for MDRR and FIFO, MDRR achieve better
    throughput than FIFO. Fig. 5.2 Average point-to-point throughput. Show All 3.
    Point-To-Point Utilization Fig. 5.3, when throughput (data transfer rate) is better,
    utilization (the ratio of current network traffic to the maximum traffic that
    the port can handle) will be better too. So MDRR achieve better throughput, it
    will achieve better utilization too than FIFO. Fig. 5.3 Average point-to-point
    utilization. Show All SECTION V. Conclusion Both MDRR and FIFO are used queuing
    method in 5G. When MDRR is used instead of FIFO queuing method, the network performance
    is enhanced, and network achieves better queuing delay, better throughput, better
    utilization, better average sent/ received packet delay and total power consumption
    will be minimized. It was proved that The MDRR is better than FIFO in many metrics
    at different scenarios, such as traffic packet dropped delay, end-to-end delay
    for Video and VoIP applications, average Ethernet delay (sec), and average delay
    (sec) in WLAN, and many other. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics

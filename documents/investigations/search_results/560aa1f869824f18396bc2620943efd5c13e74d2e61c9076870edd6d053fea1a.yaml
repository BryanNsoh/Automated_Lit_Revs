    03 December 2022 Introduction In the nineteenth century, coffee cultivation in
    Brazil began to expand into the Cerrado region. The Cerrado is a vast region of
    savanna with poor soils. However, Brazilian coffee farmers developed new techniques
    for improving the soil, such as using lime and fertilizer. As a result, the Cerrado
    is now the world''s largest coffee-producing region. The components nitrogen,
    phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, Sulphur, and iron can all be found
    in soil that is considered fertile1. The optimal soil for growing coffee is loamy
    soil, found in the state of north Karnataka, India which has a good combination
    of texture, drainage, and water retention. Coffee plantation soil requires well-drained
    soil to prevent waterlogging and root rot. Coffee plants have extensive root systems
    that extend deep into the soil to absorb nutrients and water2. The presence of
    nutrient-rich soil serves as the fundamental basis for the optimal growth and
    development of coffee plants, hence facilitating the production of superior-grade
    coffee beans. Fertility refers to the soil''s ability to provide essential nutrients
    for plant growth, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Healthy soil leads
    to healthier coffee plants, which produce higher yields of high-quality beans.
    Coffee plants thrive in slightly acidic soil with a pH of 5.0–6.5. Crop covering,
    composting, organic fertilizer, reduced tillage, water conservation, and shade
    management are ancient soil fertility strategies. Restoration of dry land to rich
    soil using IoT sensors to monitor and enhance coffee plantation soil health is
    creative and successful3. Soil sensors measure nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
    Soil temperature sensors show how temperature affects plant growth and nutrient
    uptake. Farmers can protect coffee plants from extreme temperatures by tracking
    soil temperature patterns. Soil temperature sensors show how temperature affects
    plant growth and nutrient uptake. Analyzing soil temperature patterns protects
    coffee plants from extreme temperatures4. IoT sensors help farmers optimize irrigation,
    fertilization, and other soil management activities for healthier soil and higher
    crop yields by giving real-time soil data. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are
    a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that are well-suited for processing
    sequential data like IoT sensor time-series data. RNNs are useful for time series
    prediction, anomaly detection, and natural language processing because they can
    learn and understand temporal patterns and interdependencies in datasets. Recurrent
    neural networks (RNNs) provide the capability to analyze records of soil moisture
    data, enabling the prediction of forthcoming moisture levels. Conduct a comprehensive
    examination of soil nutrient data to predict potential nutrient deficits, hence
    facilitating the efficient and effective application of fertilizers by farmers.
    This research gap identifies characteristic patterns in soil sensor data, with
    a special emphasis on sudden changes in moisture and nutrient levels. Regular
    soil monitoring will monitor the alterations in soil condition and prompt safeguards
    will be implemented5. Develop predictive models that provide suggestions for optimal
    irrigation, fertilization, and other soil management practices. The limited scope
    of traditional soil testing often focuses on soil organic matter, microbial activity,
    and soil structure. However, the use of organic improvement in soil may result
    in delayed progress. Generalized suggestions derived from past data may not consider
    the particular soil characteristics, regional climate, or contemporary methods
    of management. The information provided Erroneous interpretation of soil test
    findings and suggestions might result in misguided conclusions and unproductive
    actions. Insufficient historical analysis, which fails to account for previous
    management techniques and local environmental conditions, can have an influence
    on evaluations of soil health status and long-term patterns. This paper is organized
    as follows: “Literature review” section presents a review of related work in Recurrent
    Neural Networks with the Internet of Things using deep learning. “The proposed
    model” section describes the proposed RNN-IoT approach in detail. “Results and
    discussion” section presents the experimental setup and results. “Conclusion”
    section discusses the results and compares RNN-IoT with existing methods. “Challenges
    and future possibilities” section concludes the paper and discusses future research
    directions. Literature review Aarthi, R., Sivakumar, D., et al., proposed the
    optimal watering schedule and fertilizer application rate. IoT software platforms
    that can be used to develop smart soil property analysis systems such as Thing
    Speak, Blynk, Cayenne, Node-RED, and Azure IoT Hub. Smart soil property analysis
    systems can provide real-time soil conditions data, allowing farmers to respond
    quickly to any changes. Future work is to develop more sophisticated machine learning
    models to improve the accuracy of the predictions6. Na, A., Isaac, W., Varshney,
    S, et al., proposed an Internet of Things (IoT)-based system for remote monitoring
    of soil characteristics a system that employs sensors to collect data on soil
    properties, such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), moisture, temperature, and
    then communicates this data to a cloud platform or another remote location. These
    soil qualities include electrical conductivity (EC), pH, and temperature7. Jain,
    N., Awasthi, Y et al., proposed an IoT-based soil analysis system using optical
    sensors and multivariate regression is a system that uses optical sensors to measure
    the color and reflectance of soil and then uses multivariate regression to predict
    soil properties, such as pH, organic matter, and nutrient content. IoT-based soil
    analysis systems can be made small and portable, making them ideal for field use.
    Future work on IoT-based soil analysis systems could focus on making IoT-based
    soil analysis systems more affordable and accessible to small-scale farmers8.
    Patil, P et al., proposed the implementation of IoT to determine the level of
    bicarbonate in the soil a system that uses sensors to measure the pH and electrical
    conductivity (EC) of soil and then uses this data to calculate the bicarbonate
    level. IoT-based bicarbonate detection systems can provide users with the data
    they need to make informed decisions about irrigation, fertilization, and other
    agricultural practices9. Adrian Z et al. proposed integrating soil pH measurement
    into an Internet of Things (IoT) application a concept that involves using sensors
    to measure soil pH and then transmitting this data to a cloud platform or other
    remote location using a wireless communication protocol. The dataset collected
    by IoT-based soil pH measurement systems typically includes soil pH, Temperature,
    Humidity, Electrical conductivity (EC), and Timestamp10 as illustrated in Table
    1. Table 1 Literature review for soil health based on different proposed models.
    Full size table IoT (Internet of Things) is a key enabling technology for smart
    agriculture, as it allows for the collection and analysis of data from sensors
    in real-time. IoT-based soil parameter measurement systems can provide real-time
    data on soil parameters, which allows farmers to respond quickly to changes. Future
    work on IoT-based soil parameter measurement systems could focus on making the
    systems easier to set up and maintain18. The materials and methods section describes
    how the soil is fertilized using IoT sensors and Cloud storage. The proposed model
    The primary objective of this research study was to monitor the overall condition
    of the soil and to design an advanced algorithm called RNN-IoT. The present techniques
    for measuring soil health based on existing and past guidelines have yielded inaccurate
    results. The suggested approach has successfully addressed all of the aforementioned
    limitations and obtained a predictable outcome in transforming barren land into
    sustainable and rich soil suitable for coffee cultivation. Build an IoT sensor

    As demonstrated in Fig. 1, the N95S31B NB-IoT outdoor temperature and humidity
    sensor accurately measures air temperature and relative humidity. Figure 1 Working
    prototype for testing soil fertility. Full size image It subsequently sends data
    to an IoT server over NB-IoT. CO2 sensors measure CO. The waterproof, sturdy CO2
    concentration transmitter outputs 0–10 V. Nordic nRF9160 SiP is a low-power, single-chip
    cellular IoT solution. Its Arm Cortex-M33 CPU, low-power RF transceiver, and multiple
    ports make it adaptable. The Nordic nRF9160 SiP''s ADC peripheral measures soil
    moisture. SiP receives soil moisture sensor data20. The Soil EC NPK PH Sensor
    monitors NPK, EC, and pH. Soil electrical conductivity (EC) may indicate salt
    concentration. Higher EC values imply plant-harming soil salt. Growing plants
    need nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. It means 20% nitrogen, phosphorus, and
    potassium in the soil. Soil pH indicates acidity or alkalinity. Acidic soils have
    pH < 7, while alkaline soils have pH > 7. Electrical conductivity sensors detect
    soil solution. NPK sensors evaluate soil solution light absorption at different
    wavelengths. This data can track soil health trends and identify areas that need
    specialist soil management. LDR soil color sensors like the MNS2-9-W2-CM-020 improve
    coffee plantation soil health monitoring21. The Maxim Integrated DS3231 time stamp
    may improve coffee plantation soil health monitoring in numerous ways. Plantation
    operators can use time stamps to find patterns and trends in soil health data
    as indicated in Fig. 2. Figure 2 Virtual abstract for proposed system. Full size
    image Protocol for interfacing serial technology (IST) Soil moisture sensors measure
    volumetric water content. Two electrodes detect soil electrical resistance, which
    fluctuates with water content. Sensor output is usually a soil moisture-proportional
    voltage or frequency as indicated in Eq. (1). Where VWC is the volumetric water
    content which finds the percentage of soil volume occupied by water, can be calculated
    based on the weight of the wet soil minus the weight of the dry soil which divides
    the weight of the dry soil. εa is the apparent dielectric permittivity of the
    soil, εb is the dielectric permittivity of dry soil, εc is the dielectric permittivity
    of water. Where ρn is the neutron count rate in the soil, ρd is the neutron count
    rate in dry soil, and ρw is the neutron count rate in water as indicated in Eq.
    (2). $${\\text{VWC}} = \\left( {\\upvarepsilon {\\text{a}} -\\upvarepsilon {\\text{b}}}
    \\right)/\\left( {\\upvarepsilon {\\text{w}} -\\upvarepsilon {\\text{c}}} \\right)$$
    (1) $${\\text{VWC}} = \\left( {\\uprho {\\text{n}} -\\uprho {\\text{d}}} \\right)/\\left(
    {\\uprho {\\text{w}} -\\uprho {\\text{d}}} \\right)$$ (2) $${\\text{VWC}} = {\\text{M}}
    + {\\text{N}}*{\\text{R}}$$ (3) where R is soil electrical resistance and M and
    N are calibration constants from Eq. (3). A soil temperature sensor is needed
    to understand soil activity and plant growth22. It employs thermistors or thermocouples,
    whose resistance changes with temperature. Equation (4) shows that the sensor''s
    voltage or current output is proportional to soil temperature. Where T is soil
    temperature, R is thermistor electrical resistance, and A and B are calibration
    coefficients. $${\\text{T}} = {\\text{A}} + {\\text{B}}*\\ln \\left( {\\text{R}}
    \\right)$$ (4) Water level indicators assess soil water table depth. It employs
    a pressure transducer or ultrasonic sensor to detect water-induced pressure or
    sound reflection. Sensor output is generally a water level-proportional voltage
    or frequency. An NPK color value indicator evaluates soil nitrogen, phosphorus,
    and potassium levels. It measures soil extract color with a colorimetric sensor.
    Sensor output is generally an RGB color value or a numerical NPK level value.
    A GPS sensor locates the soil monitoring spot. GPS satellites inform it of its
    latitude, longitude, and altitude. The sensor sends NMEA messages with location
    coordinates as indicated in Eqs. (5), (6), and (7). $${\\text{Latitude}}={\\text{ArcTan}}2\\left({\\text{sin}}\\left({\\upvarphi
    }\\right),{\\text{cos}}\\left({\\upvarphi }\\right)*{\\text{cos}}\\left(\\uplambda
    \\right)\\right)$$ (5) $${\\text{Longitude}} = {\\text{ArcTan}}2\\left( {\\sin
    \\left(\\uplambda \\right),\\cos \\left(\\uplambda \\right)*\\cos \\left( {\\upvarphi
    } \\right) - \\sin \\left( {\\upvarphi } \\right)*\\sin \\left(\\updelta \\right)}
    \\right)$$ (6) $${\\text{Altitude}} = {\\text{R}}*\\left( {\\sin \\left( {{\\upvarphi
    } - {\\upvarphi }_{0} } \\right) - \\left( {{\\text{R}}_{0} + {\\text{h}}} \\right)/{\\text{R}}*\\sin
    \\left( {{\\upvarphi }_{0} } \\right)} \\right)$$ (7) where \\({\\upvarphi }\\)
    is the geodetic latitude, \\(\\uplambda\\) is the longitude, \\(\\updelta\\) is
    the sun’s declination, R is the Earth''s mean radius (6371 km), R0 is its equatorial
    radius (6378 km), h is the GPS antenna’s height above the Earth’s surface, and
    \\({\\upvarphi }_{0}\\) is the reference ellipsoid’s latitude (43.66° LDRs (light-dependent
    resistors) measure soil color to determine nutrient content. It usually uses an
    LDR, which changes resistance when exposed to different wavelengths of light.
    Sensor output is generally a resistance value that fluctuates proportionately
    with soil color as indicated in Eq. (8). $${\\text{R}}=({\\text{Cr}}+{\\text{Cg}}+{\\text{Cb}})/({\\text{Cw}}+{\\text{Cg}}+{\\text{Cb}})$$
    (8) where R is the reflected light, Cr is the red light component of the incident
    light, Cg is the green light component of the incident light, Cb is the blue light
    component of the incident light, and Cw is the white light component of the incident
    light. Soils with higher organic matter content tend to reflect more red light
    and less blue light, while soils with lower organic matter content tend to reflect
    more blue light and less red light. A pH sensor monitors the acidity or alkalinity
    of the soil. Typically, it employs a glass electrode that generates a voltage
    that varies by the pH of the solution that it is surrounded by. The output of
    the sensor is often in the form of a voltage, and its magnitude is typically proportional
    to the pH of the soil as shown in Eq. (9). $${\\text{pH}}=-{\\text{log}}10\\left({\\text{aH}}+\\right)$$
    (9) pH is soil acidity or alkalinity and pH+ is hydrogen ion activity in the soil
    solution. Each soil health measurement is timestamped. Even when the gadget is
    off, its real-time clock (RTC) preserves precise time. Synchronizing soil health
    data with other sources and tracking changes requires the timestamp. Table 2 estimates
    dry land-rich soil in coffee plantations2. IoT sensors may be connected to Arduino
    using IST. The simple and efficient IST protocol is ideal for connecting many
    sensors to an Arduino microcontroller. It includes Master Out Slave, in Master
    in Slave Out, Slave Select, and Serial Clock. SCLK synchronizes master–slave data
    transfer. MOSI and MISO signals send data from master to slave and slave to master.
    The owner chooses the slave via SS. A start condition from the master device starts
    IST communication with the slave. Most starts are high-to-low SS signal changes.
    After supplying the start condition, the master device can send a MOSI bit per
    SCLK clock pulse to the slave device. The slave device receives MISO data and
    delivers a bit to the master device for each SCLK clock pulse. Stop signals from
    master devices to slave devices halt IST communication. SS signals typically rise
    during a standstill. Arduino microcontroller board with enough computing power
    for data handling and communication interfaces. Use appropriate cables to connect
    each sensor to the microcontroller board for proper pinout and voltage. In Algorithm
    1, each sensor''s communication protocols are configured for data acquisition.

    communicating with linked sensors, reading output values, and processing sensor
    data as requested. Arduino microcontrollers gather soil health data from sensors
    as the main data-collecting unit communicating with linked sensors, reading output
    values, and processing sensor data24. The Node MCU stores data in the cloud and
    uses AWS IoT Core for visualization, and these services are accessed through the

    tools to monitor the uploaded sensor data in real time or over time. The data
    can be analyzed to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies, providing valuable
    insights into the monitored environment or process. Analyzed sensor data can be
    used to trigger actions, such as sending alert messages based on soil health conditions.
    Recurrent neural network The raw data was delivered to the input layer, where
    it was often preprocessed and normalized to ensure network interoperability. Load
    the CSV file into Panda’s data frame. Preprocess the data by performing necessary
    steps such as cleaning, handling missing values, and feature selection. Sequence
    formation has sequence length is a variable that determines the length of each
    sequence to be created. An empty list called sequences is initialized to store
    the generated sequences. Formula for GRU-based Soil Health Monitoring where, h_t
    is the hidden state of the GRU at time step t, h_{t − 1} is the hidden state of
    the GRU at time step t − 1, h_t̃ is the candidate hidden state at time step t,
    gate_update is the update gate, gate_reset is the reset gate. $${h}_{t}=gat{e}_{update}*{h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+gat{e}_{reset}*{h}_{\\widetilde{t}}$$
    (10) The update gate controls which information is allowed to flow into the hidden
    state from the previous time step where W_h is the weight matrix for the hidden-to-hidden
    state connection, U_x is the weight matrix for the input-to-hidden state connection,
    b_h is the bias vector for the hidden state, x_t is the input at time step t.
    $${h}_{\\widetilde{t}}=tanh\\left({W}_{h}*{h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+{U}_{x}*{x}_{t}+{b}_{h}\\right)$$
    (11) Loops from 0 to len(data)—sequence length + 1. This loop generates dataset
    sequences. Unfold the RNN into interconnected layers with input, forget, cell,
    and output gates. Input the current input into the input gate to regulate information
    flow into the hidden state. Apply the forget gate on the previous hidden state
    to determine how much to remember. Update the cell state depending on the input
    gate, forget gate and previous hidden state cell state that stores sequence long-term
    memory. $${C}_{t}={f}_{t}*{C}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+{i}_{t}*tanh\\left({W}_{h}*{h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+{U}_{x}*{x}_{t}+{b}_{c}\\right)$$
    (12) Consider Ct as the cell state at time step t, \\({C}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\)
    at time step t − 1, and \\({h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\) as the forget gate
    \\({i}_{t}\\) is the input gate, tanh is the hyperbolic tangent activation function,
    \\({W}_{h}\\) and \\({U}_{x}\\) are the hidden-to-hidden and input-to-hidden weight
    matrices, respectively. At time step t, \\({b}_{c}\\) is the bias vector for the
    cell state, \\({x}_{t}\\) is the input, and \\({h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\)
    is the hidden state. Use the output gate to create the current time step output
    that passes cell state information. Gated recurrent units (GRUs) architecture
    trains the dataset properly depending on soil prediction features. At each time
    step, calculate the error between expected and actual output. Back propagates
    the error via the unrolled RNN to calculate weight error gradients. Update weights
    to reduce inaccuracy. Prediction and Analysis in the RNN model increase warnings
    and suggestions by predicting soil health metrics from real-time sensor inputs.
    Historical sensor data, growth trends, and FFNN soil health results train the
    model25. Change specifics to simulate scenarios. Counter-factual recommendation
    generation Parameters within historical data to represent various ‘what-if’ situations.
    It compares with the actual generated out with historical data to generate recommendations.
    They are comparing the recommendation using three ways Present data—Historical
    data, Historical data—Historical data, and Present data—Present data as illustrated
    in Fig. 5. Figure 5 Counter-factual recommendations. Full size image For example,
    let us contemplate a hypothetical situation in which a soil health monitoring
    system, based on feedforward neural network (FFNN) architecture, provides a recommendation
    for the optimal application rate of fertilizer for a particular agricultural area.
    Counterfactual suggestion has the potential to be employed to generate alternative
    fertilizer recommendations. Manhattan distance, often known as taxi cab distance,
    is calculated by adding the absolute coordinate differences of two places. Imagine
    traveling solely horizontally or vertically in Manhattan’s grid. Distance is calculated
    using present and historical data. Consider N points in K-dimensional space, where
    2 <  = N <  = 10^ {5} and 1 <  = K <  = 5. Find the location with the lowest Manhattan
    distance from the N places. Manhattan distance is two points measured along right-angle
    axes. It is |x1 − x2| +|y1 − y2| on a plane with p1 at (x1, y1) and p2 at (x2,
    y2). Sorting the points in all K dimensions and outputting the middle components
    of each dimension reduces the Manhattan distance. $$Manhattan\\;Distance = \\left|
    {s1 - s2} \\right| + \\left| {r1 - r2} \\right|$$ (13) The Manhattan Distance,
    which indicates the dissimilarity between the current suggestion and several alternative
    fertilizer options, may be calculated as shown in Eq. (13), where |s1 − s2| denotes
    the absolute difference between the two points’ s-coordinates. |r1 − r2| is the
    absolute difference in r-coordinates. The calculation considers nutritional content,
    application rates, and environmental effects. The system may create counterfactual
    suggestions with Manhattan Distances below a threshold. This keeps alternate options
    comparable to the original advice while allowing for varied perspectives. The
    implementation phase collects and analyzes data. Results and discussion The field
    implementation of the AI-powered system involved deploying IoT sensors in selected
    infertile agricultural fields to collect real-time soil data. These sensors continuously
    monitor soil properties such as moisture, temperature, pH, nutrient levels, and
    electrical conductivity. XG-booster is used for the pre-training model for predicting
    specific soil properties (e.g., nutrient content, and moisture levels) based on
    sensor data. The collected data was then fed into the AI system, which employed
    RNNs and GRUs to identify patterns and trends in soil health indicators as indicated
    in Fig. 6. Figure 6 Agriculture land setup for testing soil fertility. (a) Agricultural

    False Negative, True Positive, True Negative, and False Positive metrics using
    the Recurrent Neural Network and Counter-Factual Recommendation Generation. Field
    setup for improving soil fertility Enhancing the fertility of the soil is essential
    for achieving sustainable agriculture and achieving maximum crop yields. To evaluate
    and enhance the fertility of the soil throughout a range of monitoring periods,
    this experiment describes a field design that makes use of several land portions.
    Datasets are collected in real-time from Madikeri, Coorg, Karnataka total of 640,
    monthly monitoring based on historical data from the past three years recorded
    around 300582. Performance evaluation compared with RNN A proposed model is compared
    to existing models to determine its accuracy. Table 3 shows random forest, SVM,
    K-means clustering, GAN, and feed-forward neural network. This performance is
    measured using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1
    score. Accuracy is the most straightforward metric, measuring the proportion of
    correct predictions made by the model. Precision measures the proportion of correct
    positive predictions. Recall, also known as sensitivity, measures the proportion
    of actual positive instances that are correctly identified as positive. Table

    Positives + True \\;Negatives) / (Total\\; Samples)$$ (14) $$Precision = True\\;

    * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)$$ (17) $$Specificity = True \\;Negatives
    / (True \\;Negatives + False\\; Positives)$$ (18) The proposed method achieves
    94.25% accuracy, while random forest, SVM, K-means clustering, GAN, and FFNN obtain
    81.22%, 81.66%, 82.12%, 88.12%, and 89.73%. Existing approaches take longer to
    calculate all datasets. Figure 7 shows that the suggested technique detects events
    better than current methods. High EC and TDS readings indicate excessive salinity,
    which can stress and reduce coffee plant output. Most of the 30-day monitoring
    period had optimum EC and TDS values. NPK levels reflect coffee plant nutrient
    availability. Low nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) levels can decrease
    coffee plant output. The reduction in NPK levels from day 11–30 suggests dietary
    replenishment. During days 1–10, the soil moisture was a little dry, but otherwise,
    it was excellent. The rain prevented soil desiccation and reduced coffee plant
    stress. Figure 8 shows that soil temperature also affects coffee plant development.
    Coffee plants like soil temperatures between 20 and 25 °C. During the monitoring
    period, soil temperature stayed within the optimal range, promoting root growth
    and nutrient absorption. Figure 7 Result analysis for the proposed approach. Full
    size image Figure 8 Mobile application. Full size image Optimization of the model
    To keep the coffee plants healthy and the farm skiing, it is important to monitor
    the soil health of the plantations. Beans with more robust scents and tastes are
    a product of soil that is both healthy and well-tended. Farmers may maximize water
    and fertilizer efficiency and cut down on production expenses by learning what
    their soil requires to be healthy. To maintain healthy and fertile soil over the
    long term, it is important to evaluate it regularly for signs of nutrient imbalances.
    Weekly data analysis utilizing the RNN model is used to monitor soil conditions,
    and farmers are updated on health-related information and comments about soil
    quality. For a more precise prediction, we compare the soil condition from the
    second week of monitoring with that from the first week. In a similar way comparing
    week 2 with week 1 generates correct results, comparing week 3 with week 2 and
    so on also yields accurate results. Measurements taken to enrich the soil of coffee
    plantations in arid regions When substantially monitoring and tracking various
    essential indicators such as electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids
    (TDS), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), soil moisture, soil temperature,
    carbon dioxide (CO2), and soil pH, agricultural practitioners can promptly detect
    potential issues and implement appropriate measures to uphold an optimal ecosystem
    for their coffee crops. The soil solution''s EC and TDS levels indicate salt content
    as indicated in Table 4. Table 4 Measurement Range to fertile the coffee plantation
    soil from dry land. Full size table CO2 levels rose somewhat from day 11–20, indicating
    a healthier soil microbial community. Coffee plants thrive best at 5.5–6.5 soil
    pH as illustrated in Fig. 9. The soil pH remained within the correct range during
    the monitoring period, ensuring that coffee plants could easily obtain nutrients
    as shown in Table 5. Rainfall is vital to soil hydration. The monitoring period
    was without significant precipitation from day one to day fourteen. This shows
    that irrigation was needed to maintain soil moisture levels throughout this era.
    Day 15 brought 15 mm of rain, restoring soil moisture. Coffee plant soil health
    measurements were within optimal levels for most of the 140-day monitoring period
    from week 1 to week 20. Figure 9 Weekly monitoring using the IoT Platform. Full

    Full size table Counter-factual recommendation RNN-IoT model uses historical data
    and real-time sensor readings to predict future soil states and potential crop
    threats. Based on these predictions, the system generates counterfactual recommendations—alternative
    actions your farm could take to achieve desired outcomes. Mobile application sample
    The mobile application was created with the open-source Google framework Flutter,
    employing JavaScript. The RCNN model has been integrated and implemented, resulting
    in the generation of recommendations. These recommendations are created using
    Counterfactual suggestions. Figure 10 is a discussion based on the question raised
    by the agriculturist from various parts of the coffee plantation growers. Soil-rich
    mobile-based applications will provide recommendations after analyzing sensor
    data. Agriculturist question was “How do soil conditions that are too dry, too
    wet, too cold, or too hot affect coffee plants”. The recommendation is generated
    as High or low soil pH can make it difficult for coffee plants to absorb nutrients.
    Solution: Apply soil amendments to adjust the pH to the optimal range. The specific
    type of soil amendment to apply will depend on the current soil pH and the desired
    pH range. Similarly, “How does rainfall affect coffee plants, and what can coffee
    growers do to mitigate the negative effects of extreme rainfall events”. The recommendation
    is generated as Insufficient or excessive rainfall can lead to water stress or
    soil erosion. Irrigate during periods of low rainfall and implement erosion control
    measures during periods of high rainfall. Monitoring rainfall patterns is important
    to ensure that coffee plants receive the right amount of water26. The proposed
    model is trained using the Training Set, which enables it to discover hyperlinks
    and patterns in the data. To minimize loss and enhance predictions. To evaluate
    the model''s performance and adjust its hyper-parameters, a validation set is
    utilized during its development. Evaluates the model''s ability to be extrapolated
    to new data, which helps avoid excess fitting. The testing set is utilized for
    the final and unbiased evaluation of the model''s performance once all training
    and hyper-parameter adjustments have been finished. Ensures the model''s ability
    to apply knowledge to unfamiliar data and offers an accurate evaluation of its
    capabilities as shown in Fig. 11. The total dataset is divided into 60% for training,
    20% for validation, and 20% for testing. The difference between predicted and
    actual values is computed using a loss function by mean square error. The loss
    is propagated backward through time, updating model parameters (weights and biases)
    to minimize the loss. Figure 10 Farmer’s query-based recommendation. Full size

    exhibits the success of a proposed theory27. The data represents the observed
    vs projected results for each week of monitoring. Within the realm of soil fertility,
    weekdays may be classified as several tiers of fertility. For instance, weeks
    1–7 exhibit low fertility, weeks 8–14 demonstrate medium fertility, and weeks
    15–20 showcase high fertility, making them suitable for cultivation as shown in
    Fig. 12. Figure 12 Multiple confusion matrix for monitoring soil accuracy. Full
    size image By using IoT sensors to track soil moisture, temperature, pH, and nutrient
    levels, coffee farmers can gain valuable insights into their crops'' health and
    needs. Figure 13 data can then be used to make informed decisions about irrigation,
    fertilization, and other agricultural practices—a 20-week soil monitoring study
    that tracks the soil condition in a coffee plantation. The study was conducted
    in a coffee plantation in Madekari, Coorg, and Karnataka, India. Ten IoT sensors
    were installed on the plantation, and data was collected every hour for 20 weeks.
    The sensors measured soil moisture, temperature, and pH at a depth of 10 cm throughout
    20 weeks. Due to heavy rainfall in the early weeks of the research, soil moisture
    was maximum. Dry weather diminished soil moisture. The study''s soil temperature
    peaked in the first weeks and then dropped as the weather cooled. pH was almost
    consistent throughout the investigation. Figure 13 IoT sensors monitoring land
    view. Full size image 20-week. The investigation produced soil moisture, temperature,
    and pH maps. These maps helped identify under and over-watered crop regions and
    regulate the irrigation system. The maps were also utilized to identify acidic
    and alkaline soil on the farm and adapt the fertilization program. Conclusion
    The foreseeable future of coffee production demands beyond merely cultivating
    a diverse range of coffee beans; it involves establishing a sustainable and lucrative
    coffee business that will endure for future generations. Utilizing sophisticated
    sensors allows for the monitoring of environmental variables, including precipitation,
    humidity, and temperature, to optimize agricultural productivity. Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices have the potential to accurately assess the levels of water
    and nitrogen present in soil. Furthermore, by assessing the CO2 concentration
    in agricultural areas, it is possible to accurately monitor evapotranspiration
    rates, therefore enhancing the monitoring of soil health. This requires equipping
    coffee growers with the necessary tools and expertise to develop intelligent soil—a
    flexible and robust ecosystem that supports the growth of healthy coffee plants
    while reducing environmental harm. Farmers are provided with immediate updates
    on the condition of their soil and receive alerts on any potential issues. This
    enables farmers to promptly address any early signs of soil degradation. The Recurrent
    Neural Network and Counterfactual Recommendations utilize advanced algorithms
    to forecast future trends and provide tailored soil cures for youthful agriculturists.
    Knowledgeable farmers make well-informed choices regarding their soil, leading
    to higher crop production, better quality, and more profitability. The proposed
    method has overcome all of the above drawbacks and achieved the predictable result
    for converting infertile land to fertile land sustainable for coffee plantations.
    The future direction is moving towards installed outside Internet of Things devices
    are subject to severe weather, dust, wind, temperature, and other environmental
    hazards. This is one of the main issues with these devices. Unexpected mechanical
    failure of the complex devices could occur as a result of unfavorable environmental
    circumstances. Therefore, the raw materials used to construct the Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices used in smart farming must be able to endure such harsh climatic
    conditions. This will ensure that the devices last longer and provide more consistent
    results. Coffee cherry early detection and recommendation based on advanced deep
    learning technology which empowers farmers to cultivate a sustainable future for
    coffee, one smart earth revolution at a time. Challenges and future possibilities
    Global research on the Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor-based smart farming
    have revealed positive results. It is employed in several small-scale agricultural
    domains a rural farm, where farmers have less technological expertise, may provide
    more challenges. Even so, the execution of the project on a broad scale is still
    awaiting completion. An obstacle of great importance is the financial burden associated
    with the deployment and installation of IoT-tagged sensors and accessories in
    vast agricultural areas. Furthermore, there is ambiguity regarding the expenses
    associated with implementation and the monetary benefits that may be obtained.
    Deploying IoT-enabled technology incurs substantial expenses for hardware, software,
    and system operation. Supplementary costs may encompass energy usage, system upkeep,
    service enrollment, and labor fees for operating combined hardware and software.
    Enhancing farmers'' digital literacy on a global scale is crucial to facilitating
    the extensive use of IoT technologies. Lack of comprehension and consciousness
    of IoT-based technologies in agriculture might result in the underutilization
    of intelligent systems in farming28. Government policymakers should develop economic
    strategies to facilitate the successful and efficient implementation of Internet
    of Things (IoT) technology by farmers in agricultural areas. Data privacy and
    security issues might hinder large-scale IoT and smart system adoption. Attackers
    can manipulate cloud server data to harm automated agricultural activities in
    farmlands. Attacks can negatively impact agricultural output and prevent good
    environmental management. IoT data security concerns contribute to the sluggish
    adoption of smart farming systems. Encryption is crucial for protecting critical
    data and digital systems in smart farming from global cyberattacks. Integrating
    cryptography with strong keys can reduce cyber threats on cloud systems. Additional
    methods, such as integrating multiparty computing with homomorphic encryption
    or block-chain, can yield accurate results. Experimental statement No plants and
    Animals are disturbed for research work. All image datasets information regarding
    plant-based processes or applications was obtained from publicly available and
    ethically sourced data and publications. Plant Collection materials are complying
    with institutional, national, and international guidelines and legislation. So
    we confirm that all methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines/regulations/legislation.

  description: Saudi Arabia's agriculture heavily depends on effective water management,
    given its limited freshwater resources and arid climate. Real-time monitoring
    of soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and crop watering needs, facilitated
    by IoT integration, plays a crucial role in conserving water and minimizing waste.
    The resultant improvements in crop yields and quality are essential for the long-term
    success of agriculture in the country. This study employs the Technique for Order
    of Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method to investigate
    the transformative potential of the Internet of Things (IoT) in enhancing water
    management practices in Saudi Arabia's agriculture sector. The research begins
    by highlighting the significance of water management in agriculture, emphasizing

    Keywords: Internet of Things, Saudi Arabia , TOPSIS, Water management ABSTRACT
    Saudi Arabia''s agriculture heavily depends on effective water management, given
    its limited freshwater resources and arid climate. Real-time monitoring of soil
    moisture levels, weather conditions, and crop watering needs, facilitated by IoT
    integration, plays a crucial role in conserving water and minimizing waste. The
    resultant improvements in crop yields and quality are essential for the long-term
    success of agriculture in the country. This study employs the Technique for Order
    of Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method to investigate
    the transformative potential of the Internet of Things (IoT) in enhancing water
    management practices in Saudi Arabia''s agriculture sector. The research begins
    by highlighting the significance of water management in agriculture, emphasizing
    the proportion of land in Saudi Arabia allocated to agricultural purposes. The
    problem statement underscores the pressing challenges in water management, encompassing
    issues such as water scarcity, inefficient irrigation methods, and the need for
    real-time data to inform decision-making. To address these challenges, the study
    proposes an IoT-based Agricultural Water Management System (IoT-AWMS) that leverages
    sensors, real-time data analytics, and machine learning algorithms. This system
    is designed to optimize water utilization in agriculture. Simulations conducted
    within the study demonstrate a significant enhancement in water usage efficiency,

  description: Assessing the quality of land is a very important step that precedes
    the planning of land use and taking management decisions; for example, in the
    agricultural field, it can be used to evaluate the suitability of the land for
    planting crops, determine the suitable irrigation system type, or adjust the agricultural
    inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides according to the requirements of each
    zone in the land. The spatial–temporal dynamic nature of land characteristics
    entails also updated evaluation process and updated management plan. The present
    paper tries to exploit the advances in information and communication technologies
    to develop a conceptual design of a dynamic system that accommodates the spatial–temporal
    dynamics of the agricultural soil characteristics to realize a land suitability
    assessment (LSA) based on a factor analysis method. The proposed design combines
    IoT technologies, web development, database, and digital mapping and tries to
    consolidate the system with other functionalities useful for decision support
    and suitable for different cases. The paper conducted a survey and made comparisons
    to select the best technologies that fit the current use case implementation and
    presents its reproducible conceptual modeling by developing the static and dynamic
    views through schemas, diagrams, message sequence charts, IoT messaging topic
    tree, pseudocode, etc. The functionality of the design was validated with a simple
    implementation of the system model. To our knowledge, there is no previous significant
    contribution that has addressed a LSA IoT use case. The proposed design automates
    the LSA process for more accurate decision-making, saving cost, time, and effort
    consumed in repeated field trips. It is characterized by flexibility and centralization
    in its offered services of spatial analysis, detection, visualizations, and status
    monitoring. The design also allows for remote control of field machinery.

    and Big Data Chapter © 2021 Introduction The Internet of things (IoT) is the network
    of any physical object that contains sensors and/or actuators and has the capability
    to process and send data over the Internet. IoT represents a main pillar of technological
    revolution in nearly all the application fields: industry, agriculture, medicine,
    military, etc. Therefore, IoT becomes the focus of attention of both research
    and industry. The literature is full of many proposals for IoT reference architecture
    and frameworks (Fremantle, 2015; Guth et al., 2016; Ngu et al., 2017; Saemaldahr
    et al., 2020; Abd El-Kader and Mohammad El-Basioni, 2013; Mohammad El-Basioni
    and Abd El-Kader 2020), IoT enabling wireless technologies development, IoT messaging
    protocols (Al-Masri et al., 2020; Naik, 2017; Tournier et al., 2021), and replete
    with many IoT use cases. In Srinivas et al.’s (2018) study, a use case was proposed
    for employing IoT technology in developing a smart healthcare system that contains
    an intelligent medicine box associated with sensors and a server for regular health
    monitoring. This smart medicine box with wireless Internet connectivity helps
    patients to get regular healthcare and creates easy communication between doctor
    and patient without meeting physically. The proposed medicine box helps the patient
    to take the right medicine at the right time. In Zhang et al.’s (2018) study,
    an architecture for the Internet of intelligent things in smart hospitals was
    proposed, and an infusion monitoring system case study to monitor the real-time
    drop rate and the volume of remaining drugs during the intravenous infusion was
    developed. An automatic real-time system for automated vehicle parking based on
    IoT was proposed by Patil et al. (2020). In the field of entertainment, IoT was
    used to understand the foot traffic of people at events; this IoT application
    visualizes the attendee traffic patterns in real time to help sponsors understand
    the best places to advertise and to ensure that the attendee count stays within
    the fire code compliance of the venue (Mendix Technology, 2021). IoT plays a key
    role in precision farming, as it allows continuous deep remote analysis, understanding,
    and control of agricultural processes leading to agriculture sustainability. This
    is clearly evident in the existence of various use cases for IoT in precision
    farming. IoT-based applications were developed for remote monitoring of the field
    information (Trimble Inc, 2021; Corizon, 2021; AgrIOT, 2021; Abd El-Kader and
    Mohammad El-Basioni 2021). In Shylaja et al.’s (2021) study, an IoT-based smart
    device is proposed for crop monitoring using machine learning. Instead of using
    the classical learning schemes, it introduced a new scheme called Modified Learning
    based Field Analysis Strategy (MLFAS) that predicts the status of the crop in
    the field by analyzing the real-time input data acquired and reports this to improve
    the decision-making process. The work of Kaburuan et al. (2019) represents an
    IoT system for monitoring the performance of indoor micro-climate horticulture
    based on farmers’ treatment from planting until harvest time. The soil, water,
    air, and image data from the field were integrated with the weather data of the
    Indonesian Meteorological Agency data. Just as the IoT is used to monitor climate
    and crops, it is also used for cattle monitoring where it senses and conveys data
    about the environment and cattle health. This application takes advantage of real-time
    data in the early treatment of any critical condition that threatens the cattle
    health and life before the matter worsens and disease spreads, for example. In
    Suresh and Sarath’s (2019) study, the proposed cattle monitoring system is composed
    of data-gathering nodes implanted on the cattle and contains sensors to measure
    important health parameters such as temperature, humidity, heart rate, and fall
    frequency. The system includes a mobile node that acts as a gateway that receives
    data from the data-gathering nodes and sends it to the IoT cloud platform for
    analysis. The monitoring system proposed by Shabani et al. (2022) also senses
    the important health parameters of the cattle: body temperature, heart rate, humidity,
    and location. The main contribution of the system is a microservice-based architecture
    which works as a bridge between the implanted devices and the IoT cloud application,
    uses machine learning to produce a percentage for the health of each head of cattle,
    and notifies the farm manager of critical situations in real time. Other complete
    systems (Dutta et al., 2022; Trivedi & Chatterjee, 2022; Unold et al., 2020) have
    been developed to monitor cattle health including the monitoring devices, the
    cloud system, and the end-user application, differing in the types of sensors,
    the communication technology, the application features, and the algorithm used
    to analyze data, classify activities, and detect conditions. IoT technology is
    used for remote control of farms, just as it is used for remote monitoring. Hence,
    it is used to automate sustainable agricultural systems and support their sustainability.
    Perhaps, one of the most sustainable agricultural systems that can benefit from
    IoT is the aquaponics system where it needs intensive monitoring and control.
    IoT-enabled aquaponics systems were proposed in the literature; in Haryanto et
    al.’s (2019); Hassoun et al. (2023) and Ezzahoui et al.’s (2022) study, smart
    aquaponics systems were proposed that monitor and control the water temperature,
    level, acidity degree, and fish feed using the readings of a number of sensors
    such as ultrasonic sensor, pH sensor, and temperature sensor. In addition to this,
    IoT has been widely used to monitor and control the environmental parameters in
    greenhouses (Joseph et al., 2020; Padmini et al., 2019; Shamshiri et al., 2021).
    Regarding the agricultural systems which depend on management zone delineation
    and spatial analysis, few researches have talked about exploiting IoT technology
    in such systems. For example, Kang et al. (2012) suggested using IoT to deliver
    the data mashup which is used in zone management to produce intelligent decision-making,
    and they drew a simple conceptual system architecture for such a system without
    giving a specific implementation. In a research by Monteleone et al. (2020) exploring
    the factors affecting the adoption of precision agriculture for irrigation management
    in the context of Agriculture 4, in an experimental case study, the use of IoT
    was casually mentioned for implementing variable rate irrigation and zone management
    by producing irrigation prescription map, but also without details of the specific
    implementation. This paper talks about a specific IoT use case which is the land
    suitability assessment (LSA). With the importance of LSA in achieving sustainable
    land-use planning especially in crop management practices, to the best of our
    knowledge, no or a small number of researches have addressed the exploitation
    of IoT to improve this process using the real-time data transmitted by the sensing
    devices deployed on the field. For example, the work proposed by Vincent et al.
    (2019) addresses the replacement of manual data collection with IoT-based sensors
    for LSA, but it mainly concentrates on the design of the multiclass classification
    used in land assessment. It only stores the data in the Amazon Web Service (AWS)
    cloud platform where it is used to develop the classification model which can
    be used later for future assessments. The proposed conceptual design is for a
    complete software system for IoT-based LSA ready to receive data that comes from
    the field and stores and processes it based on a standard multi-criteria classification
    method. Also, it implements other functions such as spatial analysis. It is the
    generalization of our case study proposed by Mohammad EL-Basioni et al. (2022).
    The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) had proposed
    a standard framework that specifies the procedures of the land suitability assessment
    process. In general, the process incorporates three steps. The first step is to
    select the influencing factors and grade the weights and relative values for the
    factors. The second step is to integrate the maps and database in GIS. Finally,
    the suitability score of each land segment is calculated, and the land suitability/classification
    maps are generated with respect to the given use. The various land-use suitability
    maps of a land are essential tools for planners and decision-makers to take the
    most suitable decision for this land use, management, and selection to allocate
    with the pre-plan, especially when they are taking into account sustainable development
    and economic competitiveness (Mu, 2006). The multi-criteria land suitability analysis
    generic model can be expressed as a land suitability measure, \\({\\text{LS}}\\),
    computed by a function of several indicators as shown in Eq. (1): $${\\text{LS}}=f\\left({indicator}_{{\\text{1}}},{indicator}_{{\\text{2}}},\\dots
    \\dots ,{indicator}_{{\\text{n}}}\\right)$$ (1) These indicators have a cumulative
    effect on land suitability as well as a separate effect that should be analyzed
    (Mendoza, 1999). These indicators are selected based on their sensitivity to management
    practices, ability to describe major soil processes, ease and cost of sampling
    and laboratory analysis, and significance (Tesfahunegn, 2014). These indicators
    are indexed in terms of some of their related soil parameters, and rating scores
    are given to these parameters. The proposed system concentrates on land evaluation
    for sustainable crop production which depends mainly on the soil parameters and
    quality indices: fertility, chemical, and physical. The proposed system is built
    on the aforementioned approach, based on the parameters used and the model and
    formulas proposed by El Baroudy (2016). The used parameters include nitrogen (N),
    phosphorus (P), potassium (K), zinc (Zn), organic matter content (OM), soil salinity
    (S), the exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), the carbonate (CaCO3) content,
    soil pH (PH), drainage (R), the texture (T), the soil depth (D), the slope (F),
    the surface stoniness (Y), the hard pan depth (HP), the hydraulic conductivity
    (G), and the water holding capacity (WHC). Some of these factors are related to
    the soil fertility properties, and some others are related to the chemical and
    physical properties of the soil. The criteria or the parameters used to measure
    each index can be varied; that is, some of the parameters considered in each index
    formula can be excluded, and the formula is modified accordingly. The variability
    in soil properties, especially over large areas, and the change in soil over time
    have made the owners of large-scale farms to periodically analyze soil to test
    its health and determine the most appropriate treatment and use. These large-scale
    farms resort to the variable rate application technology to optimally deal with
    this variability, where it allows adjusting the amount and rate of agriculture
    resources throughout the farm according to each specific region’s needs without
    excess or negligence that harms the crop and without wasting resources and harming
    the environment. The data from soil analysis is used to produce a prescription
    map which guides the variable application. A variable rate irrigation system is
    used in farms which have center pivot systems. According to the prescription map,
    the center pivot control system cycles control the switching of sprinklers and
    vary the speeds to achieve the desired application rates in each section of the
    farm. The farms which have tractors with onboard computers and adjustable rate
    spreaders, seeders, or sprayers can be used in variable rate fertilizer application,
    variable rate seeding, or variable rate pesticide application, respectively, by
    loading the prescription map to the computer. Using IoT technology in the generation
    of prescription maps maximizes the benefit of the variable rate application by
    improving spatial resolution and addresses the issue of soil change over time
    thus improving temporal resolution as well. Therefore, these large-scale farms
    with computerized agricultural application equipment are potential customers for
    IoT-based systems for spatial analysis and management zone delineation in variable
    rate application, hence the proposed system. One of the most important tasks of
    scientists and technical specialists involved in agricultural planning is land-use
    planning, especially the LSA process. The functionality provided by the proposed
    system that allows the LSA maps to be generated automatically from real-time data
    and stored historical data makes it a desirable and very useful tool for these
    scientists. The rest of this paper is organized as follows, the “Materials and
    methods” section identifies the technologies that were used to build the system
    and the tools that were selected to implement these technologies, and then, it
    formulates the IoT-based LSA use case design including its static and dynamic
    view. The “Results” section represents a small-scale implementation of the proposed
    design to validate the functionality and suitability of the selected technologies
    and tools to the system use case. The “Discussion” section discusses the work
    presented in this paper and the development of IoT use cases for farm enterprises
    in general. Finally, the “Conclusion and future work” section concludes the paper
    and specific directions for future work. Materials and methods This section reviews
    the selection of technologies and tools for system implementations and contains
    system modeling. Selection of technologies The main technologies which build the
    proposed system are web application development, digital mapping, database, and
    IoT. The following sub-sections review recent trends in these technologies and
    set criteria for technology selections for the system implementation. Web application
    technologies The web application user can access it through the web browser where
    he can use its functions and perform some tasks that need interactions with a
    remote server over a network, which can be the Internet, using a client–server
    connection paradigm. Accordingly, developing a web application incorporates two
    types of development: front-end development and back-end development. The front-end
    development, or the client-side programming, is responsible for all the elements
    and layout the user directly interacts with on his browser. The back-end development,
    or the server-side programming, is behind-the-scene functionality that enables
    the front-end functionality; it represents everything the user does not see or
    directly interact with, but in fact, it powers what is happening. Front-end development
    Mostly, there will not be a front-end webpage that can dispense with the presence
    of the HyperText Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) coding.
    HTML is the organizer of the page structure, and CSS is responsible for its component
    formatting and styling. To make the front-end webpages dynamic, a programming
    language is needed, and JavaScript is undoubtedly the most popular language used
    to do so. JavaScript is an event-based runtime scripting language that can use
    the HTML Document Object Model (DOM) to add animations, automatic refreshments,
    and adjustments according to events such as user input timers and also server-side
    events; therefore, it supports the functionality of the webpage with which the
    dropdown lists, the buttons, the checkboxes, the tables, the menus, etc. of the
    webpage become functional and interactive with the users. In addition, JavaScript
    can fetch additional web content dynamically and run web-based software. Developing
    with JavaScript, we will generally need to use some JavaScript libraries, may
    be with templating engines or frameworks. Libraries are used to speed-up and facilitate
    development where they contain pre-written ready-to-use JavaScript functions;
    the two most popular JavaScript Libraries are jQuery (Vats, 2021) and React JS
    (JavaTpoint, 2021). Table 1 presents their important features which can be used
    for making a comparison to decide which one is more suitable for implementing
    the proposed system. Table 1 Comparison between jQuery and React JavaScript libraries
    Full size table JavaScript frameworks are collections of JS libraries that not
    only include JS code snippets, but also provide developers with a template for
    arranging the JavaScript code on their website. They are scaffolds for building
    your front end. They usually include some way to structure the site files (for
    example, via components or a CSS preprocessor), make AJAX requests, style your
    components, and associate data with DOM elements. There are other less common
    languages through which one can do front-end development depending on the framework,
    for example, Flutter uses Dart and Django uses Python. But nowadays, the most
    frameworks getting popular are Angular and Vue.js. Angular uses TypeScript programming
    language and offers an incredible structure, providing easy two-way data binding,
    an MVC model, a built-in module system, a routing package, dependency injection,
    and other exciting features. Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework used
    to build web interfaces and one-page applications. The HTML extension and the
    JS base made Vue a favored front-end tool; it is used by Adobe, Alibaba, Gitlab,
    and Xiaomi. Table 2 shows Angular’s and Vue.js’s important features. Table 2 Comparison
    between Angular and Vue.js JavaScript front-end frameworks Full size table Templating
    engine is a way to display information on the user’s browser. It aims to describe
    what we want to show. Templating engines such as Handlebars.js, Embedded JavaScript
    Templates (EJS), Underscore.js, and mustache allow to store HTML/CSS/JavaScript
    components and insert JavaScript variables into them. But does the web application
    of the proposed system need a front-end framework or is vanilla JavaScript with
    some libraries and templating engines as needed sufficient? Fig. 1 shows the relative
    ranking for these two methodologies in terms of ecosystem evolution rate and continuous
    support, constriction feeling in the design, productivity/learning curve, application
    size and complexity, maintainability, collaboration of developers and ease of
    understanding codes, and abstraction/ease of learn and use. Fig. 1 Ranking for
    the front-end development approaches in terms of some important development metrics
    Full size image Back-end development The traditional back end is a mix of four
    components: the server, databases, software, and operating systems. It includes
    the code that connects the web to a database and manages user connections and
    code that powers the web app itself. Its job is to (1) access the information
    that users require through the application, (2) combine and transform such information,
    and (3) return the information in its new shape to the requester. Back-end development
    works in tandem with the front end to deliver the final product to the end user.
    The following sections talk about each back-end main component. Application (middleware/server-side
    software/API): the application is the underlying code bridging the clients to
    the database and other back-end and cloud resources, it is what ultimately drives
    the web service. The most common back-end programming languages can be categorized
    into: The Object Oriented Programming (OOP) languages: languages which follow
    the imperative programming model that uses statements that change a program’s
    state. An imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform.
    OOP is used when there are many things with few operations. Popular OOP languages
    are Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, ASP.NET, Python, and PHP. The Functional Programming
    (FP) languages: languages which follow the declarative programming model: a high-level
    program in which the coder “declare” the results that he wants the language tool
    to output without writing explicit commands, and the tool processes the declaration
    and produces the required output. The functional language is non-imperative. The
    state transitions are represented in pure functional language by functions; it
    treats all computations as the evaluation of mathematical functions. Functional
    is used only when there are few things with more operations (performing many different
    operations for which the data is fixed). Popular functional languages are SQL,
    F#, and R. It is always up to the programmers or developers to choose the programming
    language concept that makes their development productive and easy. But what are
    the hypotheses for the selection? What are the language categories and the language
    to use in the system implementation? First, for choosing the programming paradigm,
    as the choice is problem-specific, it is more likely to use a mix of the two approaches
    depending on the current problem at hand, which is the best way to implement it.
    In case of mathematical problems, FP can effectively implement it. In other cases,
    if a problem can be decomposed into a number of procedural steps and when performing
    many different operations for which the data is fixed, go functional; if, on the
    other hand, a problem involves groups of inter-related agents and when performing
    small operations for mutable data, an OOP approach is likely to be better. Second,
    what is the OOP programming language that will be used? The popularity is not
    the sole reason which makes us select the programming language, but it is a good
    indicator of the need of developers, who we are from them, to learn and use the
    language; therefore, the language popularity indicator accompanied by reviewing
    its application and features can be the rule for selection. According to the StackOverflow
    Developer Survey result 2020 (Fig. 2), JavaScript is the most commonly used OPP
    language and then Python and Java, C#, PHP, TypeScript, C +  + , and C. And according
    to frameworks, libraries, and tool StackOverflow trends up to the year 2020 (Fig.
    3), Node.js takes the top spot as it is used by half of the respondents. Fig.

    popularity Full size image Fig. 3 Frameworks, libraries, and tool StackOverflow
    trend survey Full size image Node.js is technically not a language but a runtime
    environment for JavaScript with some specific useful libraries that can be used
    by JavaScript. It is better suited for building scalable, event-based, real-time,
    data-driven, I/O heavy, fast applications, accessing or performing any non-blocking
    operation of any operating system, like creating or executing a shell script,
    accessing any hardware-specific information, or running any back-end job. As it
    helps us to use JavaScript from outside of the browser, it enables JavaScript
    to be used in the back end as well as the front end and in any OS, solving JavaScript
    compatibility issues. In addition, its event-driven back-end nature enables it
    to handle multiple synchronous database read/write/update requests, bearing in
    mind that the IoT is characterized by the collection of a huge amount of data.
    It is actually very common to use more than one back-end programming language,
    and there are a number of ways this can be done, for example, calling libraries
    that are written in another language or as separate processes. Node.js has different
    packages developed for interfacing with other languages or runtime environments.
    Node.js frameworks include: Express.js: This is a minimalist web application framework
    that is used to build a number of mobile applications and APIs. Socket.io: It
    is used for building real-time web applications. It is a JavaScript library that
    allows the bidirectional data flow between the web client and server. Asynchronous
    data I/O, binary streaming, and instant messaging are some of the most important
    features of this framework. Derby: This is a real-time data synchronization engine
    for Node.js that allows multi-site, real-time concurrency, and data synchronization
    across clients and servers. Sails.js: This framework has gained traction through
    the development of chat applications, dashboards, and multi-player games. It is
    most famous for building data-driven APIs. Due to the previous analysis, we will
    concentrate on the Node.js technology. Servers: they are responsible for managing
    all back-end processes such as exchanging data among different clients, managing
    databases, reacting to users’ posts, and sending emails. Rather than the need
    to have physical servers, now, cloud services, such as Amazon and Azure, provide
    virtual servers on which the developers deploy their server applications. In addition,
    with the Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) cloud service model, the developers can concentrate
    only on developing the front end. The system includes servers: Web server: Node.js
    has a built-in module called HTTP that can create an HTTP server, while Express
    is a Node.js web application framework built on the HTTP module, adding more functions
    to what it offers to increase the convenience of building web servers. IoT server:
    Node.js is equipped with libraries that support IoT messaging protocols; node-coap
    is a client and server library for CoAP; rhea is used for developing AMQP client
    and server. MQTT protocol and socket communication which are commonly used in
    IoT applications are supported in Node.js: Mosca is a Node.js MQTT broker which
    can be used standalone or embedded in another Node.js application, and MQTT.js
    is a client library for the MQTT protocol. Database: Node.js supports relational
    databases (e.g., MS SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite) and NoSQL databases
    (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra, LevelDB, Redis). BaaS databases can also be used allowing
    us to focus on developing the client-side, such as Firebase, Parse Server, Hoodie,
    Horizon, and feathers-nedb. Most BaaS providers use NoSQL databases. According
    to StackOverflow developer survey result 2020 for databases (Fig. 4), MySQL occupies
    the first rank in popularity among developers, followed by PostgreSQL and Microsoft
    SQL Server. Fig. 4 Stackoverflow developer survey for databases Full size image
    What to use in the proposed system front-end and back-end development The proposed
    IoT-based system is not considered to be a large-size and complex application.
    By reference to Fig. 1, the frameworks are harder to learn especially since it
    is imperative to also learn the underlying code of the framework to use it better
    and for the purpose of customization and adding functionalities, and all of these
    increase the production time using frameworks. With respect to the constriction
    in the design, some frameworks are described to be opinionated, their design is
    based on principles that are not suitable to the application we want to develop
    or increase the application footprint by unnecessary unusable codes, and at the
    same time, their customization is a too tricky and nontrivial task; this raises
    the need to study the features of the available frameworks, compare them, and
    then select the appropriate one to study and use; this is also not an easy task
    and may result in an inaccurate choice. All of these reasons in addition to the
    availability of a variety of JavaScript libraries and the guarantee of related
    good and continuous support, it is preferred to build the proposed system from
    scratch using the front-end design approach—vanilla JavaScript with some libraries
    and templating engines—by trading off the frameworks’ built-in functionalities,
    reliability, and maintainability. By the same token, jQuery is preferred over
    React due to easiness to learn and use, short time-to-market, better documentation,
    and other good features such as lightweight, feature-rich, and cross-browser compatibility.
    Naturally, HTML and CSS, along with other HTML, CSS, and JavaScript-appropriate
    libraries, are essential for the proposed system front-end development. It is
    expected to use libraries and plugins for supporting specific helper functions
    such as Bootstrap CSS framework for getting design templates for some interface
    components; Font Awesome which is a font and customizable icon toolkit; JSZip
    for creating, reading, and editing.zip files; html2canvas for taking screenshots;
    SheetJS for spreadsheets manipulation; and Google Chart libraries. The real-time,
    scalability, and concurrent processing and harvesting a vast amount of data are
    the main needs for precision agriculture and IoT applications, and all of these
    metrics are realized by Node.js; therefore, as indicated earlier, our choice fell
    on using Node.js to implement the back end of the system and interface it with
    other FP languages if needed. Using the same language—JavaScript—in both front
    and back ends is an advantage. Relational database will be used to manage the
    proposed system’s structured data and represent the relations between them. Node.js
    can be interfaced with both of the two most popular database management systems
    MySQL and PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL is an object-relational database. While MySQL
    is simple and easy to understand and manage which improves its speed performance
    for simple applications, PostgreSQL is preferred for implementing the proposed
    system for supporting complex queries on large data volumes and due to its support
    for NoSQL features and a large number of data types including JSON. Finally, the
    proposed system back end will use the Express web server. Figure 5 summarizes
    the system web app development technologies. Fig. 5 The selected web development
    technologies for the proposed system Full size image IoT technologies The IoT
    will utilize the existing networking infrastructure, technologies, and protocols
    currently used in homes/offices and on the Internet. The IoT runs over the existing
    TCP/IP network infrastructure. Exchanging data through messages is fundamental
    for the development and deployment of IoT applications. The IoT protocols, or
    the IoT messaging application protocols, can take the publish/subscribe model
    or the request-response model, some of them use UDP and some others use TCP/IP.
    Figure 6 describes the trends in the worldwide interest in three popular messaging
    protocols: MQTT, CoAP, and AMQP. Fig. 6 Google trends for three well-known IoT
    messaging protocols Full size image The publish/subscribe model has a lot of characteristics
    and advantages that make it suitable for IoT scenarios especially the proposed
    near-real-time system case, including asynchronous many-to-many communication,
    decoupling between senders and receivers in time, space, and synchronization,
    reliability, and scalability. The publish/subscribe paradigm is supported by both
    MQTT and AMQP; however, AMQP is heavyweight and therefore not suitable for battery-operated
    IoT devices, while MQTT is very lightweight. This is one of the main reasons why
    MQTT is the de facto standard for IoT messaging (HiveMQ, 2021) and more widely
    used than AMQP in IoT applications and the reason why we selected it as the adopted
    IoT technology for the proposed system (Fig. 7). Fig. 7 The selected IoT technology
    for the proposed system Full size image Digital mapping technologies Google Maps
    is a feature-rich online mapping framework that supports numerous geospatial functionalities,
    and it is the first mapping service and API the developers think of choosing when
    integrating maps into a web application. It has earned the trust of web, iOS,
    and Android developers around the world. However, Google Maps increased the cost
    of its API calls—reaches $14 for 1000 map calls—and made the number of free API
    calls per month nearly 30 times less; this makes the search for alternatives a
    must. The two most prominent alternatives to Google Maps API are Mapbox which
    offers free 50,000 API calls monthly and $0.5 for each subsequent 1000 calls (Osypenko,
    2021) and OpenStreetMap which is free. The OpenStreetMap is considered to be a
    great geographic database of the world, but it does not offer a lot of mapping
    functionalities, so usually, it is better to use a more powerful service built
    on its data such as Mapbox. Mapbox is one of the largest providers of maps for
    websites and mobile apps. Their service is used by GitHub, Pinterest, Foursquare,
    and other popular companies. Mapbox offers advanced features such as location
    search, route finding, augmented reality, and many tools to help in integrating
    maps and other Mapbox online web mapping services—such as Directions, Geocoding,
    and Static Images. Mapbox is characterized by custom maps, very good performance
    in loading maps, the ability to deal with a huge amount of data to visualize and
    extract conclusions to take appropriate actions, and geospatial mapping support.
    These features make it a good fit for the proposed system type. Turf.js is an
    open-source JavaScript library used to perform advanced geospatial analysis in
    browsers and Node.js, and works with Mapbox. It includes traditional spatial operations,
    helper functions for creating GeoJSON data, and data classification and statistics
    tools. Figure 8 illustrates the selected mapping technologies. Fig. 8 The selected
    digital mapping technologies for the proposed system Full size image Measuring
    and transmission technologies There are several methods to measure the soil parameters
    for computing the quality indices and assess land suitability. Some parameters
    can be sensed with MEMS sensors available commercially or proposed in the literature,
    on-the-go vehicle-based sensors, handheld measuring devices, or soil sampling
    and laboratory analysis. Returning to the parameters of soil fertility, chemical,
    and physical properties mentioned previously, we find that the parameters that
    can be measured by industrial sensors embedded in MEMS-based wireless deceives,
    deployed in the field, communicate, and send data in real time are N, P, K, S,
    WHC, D, PH, T, and F. The sensor can be an integrated sensor that measures more
    than one soil parameter or a sensor dedicated to measuring a specific parameter.
    The soil NPK sensor (Soil NPK Sensor 2023) can measure the fertility and nutrient
    parameters N, P, and K. The soil EC-moisture-salinity-temperature sensor (Soil
    EC-Moisture-Salinity-Temperature Sensor 2023) can be used to measure and compute
    S, WHC, and D. The soil nutrient sensor (SEM225 Series Soil 2023) can be used
    to measure S, WHC, D, along with the PH value. The RS-PH-N01-TR-1 (Soil PH Sensor
    2023) is a sensor dedicated to measuring PH. Acoustic sensors can be used to measure
    T and D, and the soil slope/tilt sensor such as 0750–9002-99 MEMS tilt sensor
    and inclinometer (0750–9002-99 ± 90° RS-485 IP67 MEMS Tilt Sensor and Inclinometer
    2023) and the dual-axis inclinometer (AXISENSE-2 V-OUT TILT SENSOR FLOOR MOUNT
    2023) can be used to measure F. In the literature, a frequency-domain integrated
    sensor was proposed for in situ estimation of G (Xu et al., 2022), while the ring
    infiltrometer tool is already used for this. Optical sensors were proposed in
    the literature to measure OM, while commercially available handheld electromagnetic
    sensors, such as Geonics EM-38 Ground Conductivity Meter 2023, are used for infield
    measurement of OM as well as R and T. A handheld soil penetrometer is used to
    measure HP. The Zn is deduced from remote sensing data or from other influencing
    factors, such as the PH and T, Soil sampling and laboratory analysis can be used
    to provide information about Zn, HP, ESP, CaCO3, and Y. The data reported by the
    battery-operated devices deployed in the field in such a system is not characterized
    by a high data rate, but the devices require low power consumption for a longer
    lifetime, and the long-range bidirectional secure communication and low cost are
    preferred. These requirements are satisfied by the unlicensed low-power wide-area
    network technology, especially LoRaWAN. LoRaWAN has long been used for agricultural
    and environmental monitoring; its communication range reaches 5 km in urban areas
    and up to 15 km in rural areas (LoRa and LoRaWAN 2023). LoRaWAN is composed of
    end devices handling the sensing and actuation and performing bidirectional LoRa
    communication with the gateways which connect them to a server. The server manages
    the network through different pieces of software used for authentication and authorization
    and session management, network configuration and performance monitoring, data
    routing and selection of the gateway for a downlink, handling uplink messages
    duplication, processing application data, encryption/decryption and integration
    of data into existing management systems or IoT platforms, etc. Formulating the
    IoT use case: system design This section tells the story, identifying the need,
    the problem, and the requirements, which motivate constructing a proposed system
    use case. Then, the section goes on to explain the static structure and the dynamic
    behavior of the system. Narrative description of the system use case Some study
    areas can be employed to produce most types of vegetables and fruits including
    potatoes. It is a large area of high spatial variation and is characterized by
    using modern cultivation methods such as pivot irrigation. These modern cultivation
    methods often are associated with the variable rate application of agricultural
    inputs to encounter and exploit the high spatial variability of the field phenomena.
    Assuming the existence of all the required hardware used in applying the variable
    rates whether built-in or added to the modern agricultural equipment, the challenge
    is in developing the plans that control how the rate should be varied in the different
    field regions which is usually based on geo-referenced sampling of field data.
    This process, to be accurately achieved, requires experience, may require the
    hiring of skilled persons to achieve it, and repeated modification of the plan
    requires more data collection throughout one season; therefore, it consumes a
    lot of effort, time, and money. The proposed system use case uses the IoT technology
    and recent trends in programming and web development to enable the automation
    of data collection with higher temporal and spatial resolution, automate the spatial
    analysis and management zoning process, and facilitate, centralize, and improve
    decision-making. The system depends on the existence of sensing devices deployed
    in the field in certain points with known geographical positions, takes periodical
    samples of the field phenomena, and reports their values in real time in addition
    to laboratory values determined after analysis of soil samples taken at the same
    positions by special different devices. These laboratory values are inputted to
    the system manually. The system is prepared to manipulate field data related to
    soil, climate, and plant. All the data is stored in a database with its geographical
    coordinates for historical reference. The real-time data along with the stored
    laboratory values are used to infer the values of phenomena along the field by
    interpolation, and then, each region which has the same range of values and accordingly
    indicates a specific performance and requires special management is delineated
    whether it is contiguous or spread over the field area, all of this using real
    maps of the earth. Examples of management zone map usage include phosphorus and
    potassium management zone maps for variable fertilizer application, management
    zone maps for soil texture and soil water content can be used for variable irrigation,
    climate zone maps can be used for weed control, chlorophyll content measurement
    maps can be used for nitrogen management, and soil electrical conductivity maps
    can help for explaining yield variation. Moreover, the system allows for the spatial
    analysis of soil quality indices of fertility, chemical properties, and physical
    properties. The spatial analysis of these soil quality indices is used to derive
    the land suitability assessment classes for crop production. The appropriate decision
    is not limited only to the application in the appropriate place but also to the
    appropriate decision time so that the system should raise alerts immediately when
    certain conditions exist. Likewise, appropriate decision-making may need to be
    done based on reviewing historical data and representing it in different forms
    including management zone maps. The system should be characterized by flexibility
    in modifying the modeling equations, parameters’ values, adding and removing items,
    selection from different options, and different types of user accounts with different
    privileges. The system should be tailored for any land and not limited to only
    one field such that the user can manage all his belonging farms from his place
    through the application, apply to them all the system functionalities, and accordingly
    be able to compare their characteristics. The maximum benefit of this system is
    when all the incorporated parameters are measured in near real time through the
    field devices, but as mentioned before, not all parameters have commercially available
    MEMS sensors to measure them. Some parameters are still measured by handheld devices
    or through laboratory analysis of soil samples, and their values are then entered
    into the system manually, for example, through spreadsheets, for use in analysis
    with continuous data received from the field nodes. Referring to the “Measuring
    and transmission technologies” section, the sensor nodes deployed in the field
    will be LoRaWAN end devices of “class A,” each containing the four sensor types
    which measure the indicated real-time parameters. As outlined above, the equation
    used to calculate a soil quality index can be modified by omitting some parameters
    and modifying the exponent accordingly by decreasing its denominator by the number
    of omitted parameters. Thus, besides having one type of node containing all the
    sensors that are included in the analysis, there can be three types of nodes according
    to the embedded sensors used separately: Type1 sensor node which is a fertility
    sensing node containing soil NPK sensor, Type2 sensor node which is a physical
    property–sensing node containing tilt sensor and acoustic sensors, and Type3 sensor
    node which is a chemical/physical property–sensing node containing soil nutrient
    sensor. The system is designed and configured to receive all values included in
    the LSA equation in the sensor node message payload, the actually sensed parameters
    will have values, and the unsensed parameters are marked with NULL. The parameters
    manually entered into the system are retrieved from the corresponding table, and
    likewise, NULL values are ignored in analysis calculations. The sampling frequency
    is the same for all sensors in a single node and can be configured remotely. Whenever
    a new message is received from a node, its measured sensors’ data is stored in
    the appropriate tables accompanied by the reception time and date. The last record
    of each node is treated as the recent data from this node, while the system service
    that will be mentioned later “Nodes Status Monitoring panel” alerts if a node
    ceased sending for a specified time. Thanks to the long LoRa range, the star-of-stars
    topology is satisfactory to such a system; any node deployed in a plot of agricultural
    land can reach a gateway deployed anywhere within that plot or beyond. Taking
    into account its minimum communication range, it can be said that an outdoor LoRa
    gateway, which costs an average of $600, can serve a circular area equal to more
    than 18,000 feddan. The appropriate number of nodes for a given field can be determined
    depending on the soil sampling scheme used. For example, if grid sampling is used,
    at least one node might be placed in the center of the cell or at a random position
    within the cell. The approximate price range for the soil NPK–integrated sensor
    is $28–95, and the price of the 4-in-1 soil nutrient–integrated sensor is $51.
    The tilt and acoustic sensors are cheaper especially when a quantity is purchased.
    A microcontroller board with a LoRa transceiver costs about $20. The sensor node
    contains other components such as a GPS module and batteries. Taking this into
    consideration, it can be said that the cost of such a sensing station containing
    all the sensors is no more than $340. As mentioned above, the system use case
    model is adapted to the fact that some phenomena still do not have corresponding
    MEMS sensors, the flexibility required in modeling soil quality indices, different
    types of sensors, different sampling frequencies of nodes, the possibility of
    one or more devices stopping transmission, and different measurement scales by
    mapping the parameter values to a specific set of factor scores provided by the
    land suitability assessment model as will be illustrated later. The static view
    of the system The topology for the system hardware and artifacts is summarized
    in the UML deployment diagram depicted in Fig. 9 which shows the system nodes
    including a central physical server consisting of back-end and front-end artifacts.
    The core of the back end is the Node.js application which loads the modules required
    for the server functionalities, mainly, the Express web service, the Nodemailer
    for email sending, and PostgreSQL client modules for connection to the PostgreSQL
    database with a specified connection configuration. The back-end works as an MQTT
    server as well as an MQTT client; the back-end MQTT client connects to the MQTT
    server using the MQTT protocol. Likewise, the system nodes include instances for
    user devices which connect to the system back end through HTTP and WebSocket,
    and instances for the IoT devices in different farms represented by MQTT clients
    reside on the sensor actuator nodes or on a base station which sends the data
    of the sensor actuator nodes on behalf of them, forwards the configuration, and
    commands messages to them. Fig. 9 Deployment diagram of the proposed system Full
    size image The dynamic view of the system In the following, the dynamic behavior
    of the system will be modeled, starting by describing the functionalities and
    the high-level design requirements of the system including actors influenced by
    the use case diagram in Fig. 10. There are about thirty-eight use cases and seven
    actors associated by different relationships. The administrator and normal user
    actors are generalized to their parent actor, the Internet user, and they are
    associated with use cases specific to their roles with two levels of privileges
    that require successful system login. The functionality of the “Open landing page
    and browse App website” use case is extended by some other supplemental use cases,
    and they communicate with the server application. The behavioral diagrams in the
    subsequent discussion describe the implementation of these use cases from different
    aspects. Fig. 10 The proposed system use case diagram Full size image The land
    suitability index, LS, is computed based on three thematic indices: fertility
    quality index, FQI; chemical quality index, CQI; and physical quality index, PQI,
    from Eq. (2): $${\\text{LS}}=\\mathrm{FQI }\\times \\mathrm{CQI }\\times {\\text{PQI}}$$
    (2) The selection of parameters that affect each index is based on the growth
    requirement of the crop. Each index is calculated by multiplying factor scores
    for each affecting parameter and then raising the product to a power equal to
    the reciprocal of the number of factors. The numerical rating of the parameter
    factor scores is based on experts’ suggestions and a review of the literature.
    The FQI, CQI, and PQI are computed from Eqs. (3)–(5), and as mentioned before,
    some of the parameters involved in the computation of each index can be omitted
    and the equation modified accordingly. Based on the value of LS, the land suitability
    class is determined according to the used suitability rating classification to
    unclassified, highly suitable, moderately suitable, marginally suitable, and unsuitable.
    $${\\text{FQI}}={\\left({S}_{{\\text{N}}}\\times {S}_{{\\text{P}}}\\times {S}_{{\\text{K}}}\\times
    {S}_{{\\text{zn}}}{\\times S}_{{\\text{OM}}}\\right)}^\\frac{1}{5}$$ (3) $${\\text{CQI}}={\\left({S}_{{\\text{S}}}\\times
    {S}_{{\\text{ESP}}}\\times {S}_{{\\text{CaCo}}3}\\times {S}_{{\\text{PH}}}\\right)}^\\frac{1}{4}$$
    (4) $${\\text{PQI}}={\\left({S}_{{\\text{R}}}\\times {S}_{{\\text{T}}}\\times
    {S}_{{\\text{D}}}\\times {S}_{{\\text{F}}}{\\times S}_{{\\text{Y}}}{\\times S}_{{\\text{HP}}}{\\times
    S}_{{\\text{G}}}{\\times S}_{{\\text{WHC}}}\\right)}^\\frac{1}{8}$$ (5) Before
    delving deeper into describing the interactive behavior of the system, it is worth
    introducing the stored data, the tables, and relational diagrams; Fig. 11 shows
    the system database schema. Each of the three tables allNodesData, labParameters,
    and lastRecords contains the values of the field phenomena: allNodesData stores
    all the records of real-time values that come directly from the field corresponding
    to all the nodes deployed in any registered land, and in addition to that, the
    table record stores the soil quality indices computed in terms of its fields’
    values. The table labParameters contains the values of the phenomena determined
    by on-site measurement or laboratory analysis of soil samples corresponding to
    all the nodes deployed in all the registered land, and these values are inputted
    into the system manually. The table lastRecords stores only the last record of
    each node of its real-time, lab, and computed parameters. The registeredFields
    table stores the registered land information. The two tables allEvents and Conditions
    are related to storing the tested event specifications. The Factors table is dedicated
    to storing numerical rating of factor scores to facilitate changing this rating
    according to the crop and the suitability assessment purpose. The rating scheme
    can be expressed as follows: for parameter x, the factor score is s1 if x < low
    bound, s2 if x \\(\\in\\) [low bound, intermediate limit], s3 if x \\(\\in\\)
    [intermediate limit, high bound], and s4 if x > high bound, where the bounds of
    these ranges are numerical values. In another possibility, in which x takes a
    discrete value represents a code corresponding to a textual description of x,
    for example, the soil texture can be SiC, silty clay; SiCL, silty clay loam; and/or
    CL, clay loam, expressed as numerical codes of 1, 2, and 3, and in this case,
    the range is an array of numerical codes that describe the parameter value. Fig.
    11 The proposed system database schema Full size image The Factors table stores
    the scheme through fields that identify the parameter, the range type whether
    numerical range or array of discrete values, and fields that identify the bounds
    of a numerical range, while the codes array is stored in the range_Minimum field,
    and field for storing the factor score. Data dictionaries for additional explanation
    of database schema tables are available in the Appendix. The pseudocode in Fig.
    12 represents the computation of the three quality indices. The computation of
    the indices begins when a data message is received from a node by fetching the
    values of all parameters of this node from the table that is dedicated to storing
    the laboratory values. The considered value of each parameter is its fetched value
    if it is not NULL; otherwise, it takes its value from the received massage whether
    a numerical value or NULL. The pseudocode then illustrates the computation of
    the CQI as an example of an index computation. The code loops through the parameters
    influencing CQI and uses the Factors table to determine these parameters’ factor
    scores. The If statement in line 37 checks the range type whether it is a numerical
    range of the low bound only, a numerical range of the high bound only, a codes
    array, or a numerical range of two limits, and then, it makes the appropriate
    test to see if the parameter value falls within the range. Then, it considers
    the factor scores of the parameters in the computation only if it is not NULL
    and modifies the exponent accordingly. Fig. 12 Pseudocode for land quality indices

    diagram for the proposed system Full size image The Events and Actions settings
    service includes transactions among three objects shown in Fig. 12. They are the
    user browser which controls the front-end content of the system, the server-side,
    and the database. The browser or the front-end code sends the HTTP GET request
    to the server to retrieve the Events and Actions settings webpage and sends HTTP
    POST requests with the data of a newly formulated event or the data of existing
    event(s) to be ignored. The server-side responds to these requests by doing the
    required interactions with the database to add or ignore the specified events
    and by rendering and sending the requested page with the appropriate local variables
    or sending the login page if the authentication failed. All the front-end pages
    use an established WebSocket connection between the sever and the browser to receive
    the Alert event. The Mapping service transactions which are described in Fig.
    14 include POST requests to add and ignore lands and the associated database manipulation
    statements. The server-side continuously updates the GeoJSON representation of
    the lands’ data, and the Mapping page periodically gets this data to display it
    on the map. In the Virtual Coordinates Spatial Analysis service, Fig. 15, the
    WebSocket connection is used for listening to the Spatial Analysis Update event
    issued by the server periodically to send the updated data of the parameter considered
    for the analysis. The browser can post new settings of the 3D plot to be considered
    by the server when computing the subsequent plot parameter data. The sequence
    charts of the three services aggregated to the Real-time Data Visualization service
    are shown in Figs. 16, 17, and 18. They mainly depend on event-based transactions
    between the browser and the server. The Historical Data Visualization as shown
    in Fig. 19 includes a POST request for historical data retrieval from the database
    containing the primitives for fetching and preparing the data, upon which the
    server follows these primitives and submits the result back to the browser through
    event-based communication. The IoT massaging–related interactions and topic tree
    are shown in Figs. 20 and 21, respectively. The MQTT client of the server-side
    subscribes to the data channels of all the registered lands, while the IoT devices
    in each land publish data through the land data channel. On the contrary, IoT
    devices play the role of subscribers but to the channels of the application commands,
    while the server plays the role of publisher that publishes its commands to the
    devices through these channels. These interactions entail other transactions with
    the database, the browser, and the mail server. The different states and state
    transitions accompanied by the system can be summarized by the server-side lifetime
    conditions as depicted in Fig. 22. The server always is in the listening state
    on the system communication ports, and in the event of receiving a request through
    them, it transits to the processing state of the received request. Three timers
    control the server operations, two always-on timers: one of them is for periodically
    checking all the deployed node status and the other one is for periodically checking
    the saved events to detect if one of them is realized. The third timer is for
    periodically updating the virtual coordinates spatial analysis plot, and it is
    always on only if this service is enabled by a POST request. All the states have
    a transition to the final state in the event of a server shutdown, but it is not
    indicated completely in the figure for clarity and simplicity. The flow of some
    of the system operations and the system’s different function implementation details
    are described in the following activity diagrams. Figure 23 describes the node
    status check flow of operations, while Fig. 24 describes the implementation of
    the event checking activities, and the details of the handle_event(event id) function
    are further described in Fig. 25. Fig. 23 Node status checking activity diagram

    Full size image Results This section contains the results of validating the selected
    technologies and the system functionalities with respect to its IoT use case specification
    through a small-scale implementation. The validated functionalities are developing
    a functional Node.js back end, developing an interactive front-end webpage that
    sends the user inputs, issuing events to the back end, and receiving issued events
    from the back end, and a functional PostgreSQL implementation can be used to store
    and retrieve data, an IoT publish/subscribe valid connection from an Internet
    IoT device to the server and the display of its data in real time, and finally,
    the spatial analysis functions of the digital map. IoT real-time connection validation
    An interactive webpage is developed to display the data sent by remote devices
    immediately as it arrives in tabular and graph forms (Fig. 26a). The webpage uses
    HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the EJS templating language to embed JavaScript into
    HTML templates to implement the dynamic table from the list of items sent by the
    server to the webpage when rendering it and the CanvasJS Charting Library to implement
    the dynamic graphs. The MQTT library is used for implementing the publish/subscribe
    interaction, and the Socket.io library is used to enable the real-time web app
    service for updating the graphs. The Eclipse Paho client library is used for implementing
    a remote device. Fig. 26 The interactive webpage to test real-time data display

    Full size image In this validation example, the “mqtt://broker.hivemq.com” public
    broker is used, where the remote devices Node1 and Node2 are connected to it and
    publish their data to the topics “Node1/data” and “Node2/data,” respectively.
    As the server subscribes to these two topics, it receives the data sent through
    them. Figure 26b shows the tables and the graphs as they are updated with Node1
    and Node2 data that is immediately sent by the server via issuing UpdateGraph
    events. Node2 is subscribed to the topic “cmds/sprinkler1/status,” the server
    publishes to this topic a payload “Open” to command the node to open the sprinkler
    if the node temperature value becomes greater than 20 and the sprinkler is currently
    closed, and in a similar way, it publishes to this topic a payload “Close” to
    command the node to close the sprinkler if the node temperature value becomes
    less than 10 and the sprinkler is currently opened. Figure 27 shows that when
    the temperature of Node2 fell below 10 and the sprinkler was in the Open status,
    the server sent the Close commend which was successfully received by the node
    as indicated by the message “*****Closed *****.” Fig. 27 The bidirectional IoT
    connection test Full size image Form input and database retrieval validation A
    database table was constructed to store the data of the IoT devices. A webpage
    (Fig. 28) was developed to submit the specification of the data that the user
    wants to retrieve from the table. The server fetches the required data and emits
    an event with it to the webpage where it is displayed in the graph. Fig. 28 Webpage

    Full size image Spatial analysis functionality validation Mapbox and turf library
    were employed to perform the spatial analysis. Two methods were implemented: in
    the first one, the required phenomenon values of sample data points from a study
    region (the region appears in Fig. 29a) and the “turf.interpolate” were used to
    generate a grid of values covering the whole study region. Then, the number of
    zones and breaks/ranges for the zones values were determined to be four zones
    with breaks [8,10,16,20,30], and the “turf.isobands” was used to draw the isobands
    that represent the different zones (the different specified ranges of the interpolated
    grid points’ values) as shown in Fig. 29b. Then, the isobands were cut to fit
    the area of the study region as shown in Fig. 29c, where the Mapbox Draw tools
    were used to delineate the study region boundary. Fig. 29 The spatial analysis
    result using Mapbox and turf library. a The study area, b the computed isoband
    fit the Bounding Box of the study region, c the isoband fit the area of the study
    region Full size image In another method, the spatial analysis can be performed
    using the K-means algorithm using turf.clustersKmeans on the interpolated grid
    values of sample data points. Figure 30 represents another area shape of a study
    region; here, the numberOfClusters was specified to be seven. As shown in Fig.
    30, the algorithm clustered the data into seven clusters: (1) Cluster0: min value
    10.015541544598735, max value 26.986562988768455 (2) Cluster1: min value 13.929786699318,

    paper is about a software solution acting as a part of a complete end-to-end software
    and hardware system for a farm enterprise. Figure 31 summarizes the work done
    in this paper in graphical form. Fig. 31 Graphical abstract of the proposed solution
    Full size image Technology-wise, the solution represents an IoT Web App; application-wise,
    the solution is mainly a land suitability assessment tool for environmental and
    agricultural production sustainability; market-wise, it can be considered an enterprise-scale
    field monitoring and mapping software product. The IoT use case is formulated
    taking all of these three aspects into account. Starting application-wise, we
    turned to the agricultural experts to find out their recommendations on a specific
    important agricultural aspect that needs to be digitally transformed and performed
    smarter, and the choice fell on the land suitability assessment process. As a
    product, estimating its market size helps in identifying whether such a system
    really has potential customers and whether it is expected for it to succeed and
    sustain. The precision agriculture market is segmented into seven application
    types; as shown in Fig. 32, the yield monitoring and field mapping applications
    are on and expected to remain on the throne of revenue generation. Likewise, as
    shown in Fig. 33, the market share of software occupies the second rank in the
    precision agriculture market offerings, and it is expected to increase. Fig. 32

    Full size image As previously mentioned, the system’s potential customers are
    owners of large private farms, government for large-area state-owned agricultural
    lands, and scientists in the field of agricultural and soil applications. These
    customers need to take precision decisions on land use and management, decrease
    field trips, save time and effort, decrease labor costs, prevent the waste of
    agricultural inputs, monitor the field with a high spatial–temporal resolution,
    decrease human errors in measurements and analysis, model agricultural operations
    based on experts’ knowledge, control their farm equipment and conditions remotely,
    improve crop quality and size, increase profits, preserve the environment, etc.
    At this time, the system use case can be narrated. The features of the proposed
    design are selected to meet these needs and add value in a way that increases
    the chance of the system to become effective and to gain a competitive advantage.
    The system is designed not to depend on the human factor in taking readings and
    analysis; it is prepared to communicate with the smart devices in the field and
    take readings from them directly, store the data, and process it based on the
    experts’ models of spatial analysis. In addition to that, it also allows for data
    input from humans. The spatial analysis and land suitability assessment maps are
    produced automatically in real time and from historical data. Based on these maps,
    the users can compare lands and differentiate the application of agricultural
    inputs to different regions of the land according to their real need. Regardless
    of the main purpose of the system, its proposed design augments it with other
    features that generally meet the need and satisfy the customers of the market
    segments related to the system, such as remote control, detections and alarms,
    and spatial analysis using virtual coordinates. A good feature of the proposed
    system is its ability to interoperate with governmental initiatives and regional/international
    spatial data infrastructures. Every country has a land cadastre database, which
    stores cadastral information and metadata for its agricultural lands such as unique
    identification, owner information, area, location, boundaries, soil quality characteristics,
    irrigation system, and crops. This information can be used by interested governmental
    or non-governmental entities, with appropriate authorization privileges, to improve
    the land-use analysis and thus achieve sustainable land management. Recently,
    many countries, including Egypt, have turned to digital transformation and developed
    strategies for it, including, as an important part, the automation of the land
    cadastre database. Egypt is working to automate the agricultural tenure system
    and build a comprehensive and integrated geographic database on agricultural tenure,
    land cadastre, and related activities at the republic level, which will lead to
    the integration of geographic data for government agencies and the ease of exchanging,
    displaying and analyzing information and preparing future plans through establishing
    a national center for spatial data. The establishment of this center would ensure
    the provision and availability of a base map for all sectors of the state, with
    the aim of raising the efficiency of planning decisions, providing cooperation
    and coordination in implementing policies and foundations of uses, and facilitating
    the sharing and exchange of information between government agencies. Assuming
    that the local land cadastre database follows the international standard (Land
    Administration Domain Model (LADM)) in its implementation, the National Center
    for Spatial Data is the source of the data related to the two packages: Party
    and Administrative. The proposed system is related to the Spatial Unit package
    and its sub-package Representation and Survey, and in addition, the model can
    be extended by associating classes related to land suitability indices. The system
    will be the source of the spatial and soil-related data. The connection of the
    system to the local land cadastre database can be through a remote database connection
    or through an MQTT connection. The second option is preferred for several reasons,
    such as bandwidth, security, and loose coupling, and can be implemented by integrating
    the local land cadastre database with an MQTT client. The system topic tree will
    be expanded to include a topic, under the land code level, related to land suitability
    indices. The MQTT client of the database system subscribes to this topic for all
    the registered lands in the proposed system, while the MQTT client in the proposed
    system back end publishes this topic periodically for all lands. The published
    data can be the land suitability assessment map itself. This requires the database
    system to securely maintain land codes associated with the corresponding land
    data and also requires an update in the MQTT server access control list (ACL)
    for restricting the subscription to these topics to the MQTT client of the local
    land cadastre database and the publication on each of these topic to the relevant
    land, where the client ID of each land represents its land code. This is of course,
    in addition to the existing rules that restrict the subscription/publication between
    the proposed system back end and the MQTT clients of the lands. Through the standard
    format that the local database follows, external databases can connect to it and
    access its stored data based on the established database authorization rules.
    The technology-wise design entails selecting the IoT enabling technologies and
    tools and before that putting the criteria upon which the selection will be made.
    The process followed in developing the proposed IoT system can be summarized and
    generalized as shown in Fig. 34. Fig. 34 Generalized IoT software development
    process for farm enterprise Full size image Another important matter that cannot
    be overlooked and is crucial for satisfying the needs of such enterprise-scale
    IoT system customers is ensuring accurate readings of the IoT devices. Ensuring
    and improving sensor data quality can be done in several stages and forms. During
    device design, sensors can be calibrated by comparing the sensor reading to a
    standard value. The accuracy and precision of readings can be improved through
    the calibration process by adjusting the design, including the sensor settings,
    and using appropriate filters to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, until acceptable
    accuracy is achieved. It is recommended to perform the calibration over the full
    range of the sensor reading and in different environmental conditions. Also, periodic
    recalibration is recommended to tackle the drift of sensor readings over time.
    Continuous monitoring together with using appropriate validation methods of sensor
    readings is important to ensure data accuracy and precision. The aim of validation
    is to detect device malfunction and anomalies in devices’ readings such as bias,
    dropout, and outliers. The number of published literature on the topic of designing
    software systems for land suitability assessment, soil spatial analysis, and management
    zone delineation is not considered many. Some rely entirely on manual input, and
    others exploit the embedded system and web technologies to automate and improve
    some processes done manually in the commercial geospatial processing programs
    that were not specifically developed for agricultural applications, but they have
    not exploited the IoT technology. A sample of previous work will be discussed
    below. The research by de Freitas Coelho et al., (2018) proposed an embedded system
    consisting of a single-board computer and sensors and running an application developed
    using Python and PyQt designed to perform the data analysis immediately after
    data collection, eliminating the need to come back and forth frequently to and
    from the laboratory to collect more data from the field for analysis. The application
    first filters the data through outlier and inlier analysis, then performs kriging
    interpolation, and finally produces and visualizes the spatial analysis map resulting
    from K-means clustering. This system did not benefit from the communication network
    technology, as the readings are taken manually and through a single device, which
    adds effort and time consumption until a single collection of field data is completed
    and makes it unsuitable for large-area fields. In addition, the motivation of
    the work which is avoiding the need to return to the field to collect more data
    to tackle problems in the sampling strategy can be addressed by performing the
    analysis done by the proposed system using any PC or laptop in the field. Another
    limitation of the system is the use of collected points in defining the field
    boundaries. The research by Werner et al. (2020) developed a web-based spatial
    analysis application integrated with R language for the statistical and geostatistical
    analysis and creation of thematic maps. It offers generating the maps using both
    inverse distance weighting and kriging methods. The application automates some
    processes such as fitting the best model for a semivariogram. Sample data was
    used to validate and calibrate the application output with ArcMap. The work describes
    the application software layer that provides a friendly interface to the user
    but generates grayscale maps. A software system for multi-criteria LSA for different
    types of cultivating crops in tropical and subtropical regions was proposed by
    Elsheikh et al. (2013). It offers the ability to add a new type of crop by adding
    a new record to the crop records. It is built using GIS Model Builder, Python
    scripts, and Visual Basic and uses attribute tables and digital mapping with GIS
    capabilities to display the output upon which the decision-makers build their
    decisions. The outputs were validated by subjective comparison based on knowledge
    of whether the crop was already grown on the land assessed, and expert judgments
    were also consulted to validate the outputs. The research by Kang et al. (2012)
    addressed the use of IoT technologies for zone management delineation. It does
    not go beyond a conceptual model that specifies the possible architecture and
    usage of such a system. Postolache et al. (2023) found that there is no large-scale
    or commercially available IoT system for horticulture and then proposed an IoT-based
    system for soil fertility evaluation in horticultural farms to aid in detecting
    plant stress and improve irrigation and fertilization decision process which needs
    not only the current value of soil nutrient but the historical nutrient data.
    The sensing nodes sense some soil and climate parameters and use Wi-Fi or LoRa
    for communication. The sensed parameters are soil moisture, pH, and N, P, K, relative
    humidity, and temperature and it offers plug-and-play sensor extension. The system
    contains a mobile application used to visualize measurement data points, as well
    as graphs of the time change in parameter value. The sensibility of the sensors
    and the functionality of the system were tested. In Martis et al.’s (2022) study,
    machine learning enabled an IoT platform to predict a crop suitable for the Kharif
    and Rabi seasons for cultivation. The prediction model was trained with different
    datasets and used to perform time-invariant classification. The system also provides
    suggestions to enhance soil fertility. The system is composed of end device sense
    N, P, K, EC, and pH; a relay unit is used to collect and convey data in a prespecified
    frame format using MQTT, and the communication between devices is through Wi-Fi
    and LoRa; and an intelligence unit runs the machine-level algorithms as a service
    on Dual Intel Xeon. From the prediction results, a rule-based recommendation system
    was designed to specify the best soil treatment. Table 3 infers specific characteristics
    of these works compared to the proposed system. Table 3 Comparison between the
    proposed system and previous work Full size table Conclusion and future work This
    paper presents the development of a conceptual design of a dynamic system that
    accommodates the spatial–temporal dynamics of the agricultural soil characteristics
    to realize a land suitability assessment (LSA) based on the factor analysis method.
    The IoT-based LSA software system is built using other enabling technologies.
    It utilizes web development to augment the system with a user-friendly interface
    that can be opened by any browser from anywhere. The system uses the database
    technology to store the raw and processed field data. Furthermore, the system
    uses digital mapping toolboxes to manage the geographic information of the agricultural
    fields and the data layers of their sensed data. The paper reviewed the recent
    trends in the system-enabling technologies and the selection of the approaches
    that were used to design and implement the proposed system. A vanilla JavaScript
    front end with some libraries for providing some functionalities communicates
    with a Node.js back-end through HTTP methods and WebSocket communication. The
    Node.js application deploys modules for the web server, MQTT client, and server;
    it communicates with the devices deployed in the field using the MQTT protocol
    and communicates with the PostgreSQL database. The device tier of this IoT system
    contains “class A” LoRaWAN end devices that are deployed according to the soil
    sampling method used, with a LoRaWAN gateway serving a circular area of at least
    18,000 feddan through star-of-stars topology. The node contains a LoRa transceiver
    and four sensors to measure soil parameters N, P, K, S, WHC, D, PH, T, and F,
    and furthermore, it contains a GPS module to assign geospatial positioning information
    to the sensed data. Depending on the sensors integrated into the node, three types
    of nodes can be produced: the first one contains the soil NPK sensor that senses
    soil fertility parameters, the second one contains the tilt sensor and acoustic
    sensor that sense some soil physical properties, and the third one contains the
    soil nutrient sensor that senses some soil chemical and physical properties. These
    different types of nodes add the possibility of eliminating the involvement of
    some parameters in the analysis and reducing the cost of the solution. Message
    sequence charts, deployment, use case, activity diagrams, database schema, and
    topic tree are used to describe the static and dynamic views of the system design.
    The paper validates only the functionality of the selected technologies with a
    small-scale implementation example. Referring to the description of the proposed
    system, the discussed previous related work, and Table 3, it can be concluded
    that the proposed system is the only system that benefits from the IoT technology
    and offers the LSA together with spatial analysis and prescription map generation
    facilities at large-scale areas. The proposed work is the only work that augmented
    the system design description with a survey of possible implementation technologies
    before making selections based on criteria; the design is also augmented by reproducible
    standard visual modeling. The proposed system offers some additional functionality
    which can be described as a powerful precision agriculture software and not a
    dedicated program to perform specific functions. The sketched generalized IoT
    software development process for farm enterprises is also considered a contribution
    of this work. On the other hand, we find that the system has some shortcomings,
    such as not performing filtration or any preparation of the raw data first before
    storing and processing it. Regarding the system cost, the IoT technology in general
    is expensive, but what matters are the benefits resulting from its application
    and the payback period of each specific use case. The work in this paper is dedicated
    to the low-level software layer of the system use case and the selected technologies,
    and implemented functionalities have been validated. Other systems have calibrated
    the results with real data as they feature a complete system including an implementation
    of a web or mobile application. The application software layer of the proposed
    system is addressed in Mohammad EL-Basioni et al.’s (2022) study, where the system
    output is calibrated with real data. In summary, the work in this paper represents
    the specification of a low-level software layer of an IoT-based system for a use
    case not considered before and has advantages over similar previous work. The
    proposed design needs enhancements to represent channels for future work. It is
    better to provide different options for interpolation methods; it is better to
    provide different options for LSA methods; while maintaining the advantage of
    being able to set different crop criteria, it is necessary to support more than
    one crop at the same time; and a complete implementation of this generalized system
    with large-scale real experiments, accompanied by recording, analyzing, and discussing
    the results to assess the real impact of the system, needs to be addressed further.

  description: Innovation has been the transforming tool of precision agriculture
    as a response to population growth and the demand for more food with quality,
    less waste, food security, and sustainable management of environmental resources.
    The challenges are to increase the productivity of cultivated areas, both for
    current and future areas, to manage the use of potable water, scarce in many regions,
    to keep the soil fertile, and to reduce waste through reuse, optimization, resource
    sharing, and operational and strategic management based on accurate information
    of planting, harvesting, and management of environmental conditions, which are
    also objectives of the Circular Economy. Therefore, using Industry 4.0 technologies
    in agriculture becomes fundamental to facing such challenges. This paper presents
    a systematic literature review on Industry 4.0 technologies adopted in agriculture
    for sustainable development, considering environmental, economic, and social benefits.
    The research pointed to the use of IoT in irrigation control systems by sending
    automatic commands, monitoring soil and weather conditions, in the use of machinery
    with some automation features and in cloud data storage systems, and with the
    use of Big Data analytical tools, with access by mobile devices, these uses contribute
    to operational and strategic decision making in the management of planting and
    harvesting. However, the literature review did not find a technological architecture
    for Integrated Services in Agriculture 4.0. Thus, this paper proposes a Service
    Architecture that enables the promotion of a Circular Economy in Agriculture 4.0.
    The contribution of this article to the theory is in the expansion of knowledge
    of the use of technologies in Agriculture 4.0. In terms of practice, this article
    provides an Integrated Service Architecture so that new products can be developed
    for Agriculture 4.0 and thus contribute to society in reducing food insecurity,
    generating environmental, economic, and social benefits, and promoting the Circular
    Economy in Agriculture 4.0.

    to the use of IoT in irrigation control systems by sending automatic commands,
    monitoring soil and weather conditions, in the use of machinery with some automation
    features and in cloud data storage systems, and with the use of Big Data analytical
    tools, with access by mobile devices, these uses contribute to operational and
    strategic decision making in the management of planting and harvesting. However,
    the literature review did not find a technological architecture for Integrated
    Services in Agriculture 4.0. Thus, this paper proposes a Service Architecture
    that enables the promotion of a Circular Economy in Agriculture 4.0. The contribution
    of this article to the theory is in the expansion of knowledge of the use of technologies
    in Agriculture 4.0. In terms of practice, this article provides an Integrated
    Service Architecture so that new products can be developed for Agriculture 4.0
    and thus contribute to society in reducing food insecurity, generating environmental,
    economic, and social benefits, and promoting the Circular Economy in Agriculture
    4.0. Keywords: Agriculture 4.0; Circular Economy; environmental sustainability;
    economic sustainability; social sustainability; Service Architecture 1. Introduction
    The increase in the world’s population in recent years and the forecast to reach
    9 billion by 2050 impact the need to increase food productivity [1] using the
    same agricultural areas, with reduced costs and less environmental impact. Factors
    such as extreme weather events, more demanding consumers, population concentrated
    in urban centers, and scarce natural resources are the major challenges to be
    faced [2]. In this context, some technologies of Industry 4.0 implemented in agriculture
    in recent years have generated impacts in several regions with climate change,
    scarcity of drinking water, and soil degradation, and in this context, some Industry
    4.0 technologies [3] can contribute to the management of inputs for planting and
    harvesting, the optimization of soil [4], water, and fertilizer use [5], an increase
    in productivity and food quality, and a decrease in environmental impacts [6]
    with the replacement of fossil energy sources by bio-renewable ones [7]. The digital
    revolution has had a great impact on development in several areas [8,9,10,11],
    and in agriculture [12], water use management projects [5] with controlled irrigation
    [6], use of soil parameter sensors [13] with nutrient application [14], and real-time
    monitoring [15] of increasingly unfavorable weather conditions in many regions
    [16] are options for smart agriculture [17]. The digitalization of agriculture
    [18] with the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies [19] has the potential to
    expand productivity, better control the product life cycle, aid cooperation in
    the production chain [20], reduce environmental impacts, improve food safety with
    reduced food waste [21], and increase the sustainable use of natural resources
    [22,23], and resilience to supply in times of scarcity [24]. The collection of
    large volumes of on-farm data [17,25], indicating weather and planting conditions
    [26], more detailed knowledge about planting and harvesting [27], and decreased
    waste [28], makes processes more controlled [17,25] and serves to support farmers
    in data-driven decision-making processes [21,29,30]. Integrating smallholder farmers
    into innovative trends [31] contributes to keeping young people in the countryside
    with rural tourism and social entrepreneurship activities, diversifying household
    income [32]. Additionally, various technological solutions are still restricted
    to large agricultural conglomerates and are more focused on profit than on food
    security and social context [33]. The Agriculture 4.0 revolution is an opportunity
    for farmers to meet the challenges in food production and enable the creation
    of added value by combining innovative technologies: precision agriculture, information
    and communication technology, robotics, and Big Data [34]. The increase in food
    production and, consequently, the consumption of natural resources, combined with
    other industrial activities, have increasingly affected environmental, social,
    and economic conditions [35]. Thus, the concept of the Circular Economy, with
    examples in China in the 1990s, in the use of natural resources [36], presents
    a change in the form of business and can contribute to the sustainable development
    of society [37]. The objectives of the Circular Economy are to reuse materials
    through recycling processes [38] and with the principles of conservation of natural
    resources, balancing consumption between renewable and non-renewable resources,
    with a longer lifetime of resource use and a reduction in the negative effects
    of productive systems [39]. These are important factors that can be applied with
    the new technologies of Industry 4.0 in precision agriculture to generate environmental,
    economic, and social balance. A few studies have explored various technologies
    in agriculture, but none have addressed an Integrated Service Architecture or
    its role in promoting the Circular Economy by illustrating how these technologies
    interact and collaborate. Moreover, the implementation of technologies was limited
    to an automation process such as irrigation control, fertilizer control, or even
    the storage of harvest variables and provision of some computerized support for
    farmers. Considering the great demand for food production, food safety, innovations,
    and new technologies to evaluate and minimize environmental and social impacts,
    no studies were found that can provide information to farmers about farm management,
    natural resource use needs, plantation and harvest data, and support for strategic
    or operational decision making. Based on the findings, this research aims to propose
    a Service Architecture that integrates Industry 4.0 technologies with the Circular
    Economy principles to promote sustainable development in agriculture. The paper
    provides a structured examination beginning with an introduction, followed by
    a detailed methodology in Section 2, an exploration of the Service Architecture
    for smart agriculture in Section 3, and ending with comprehensive conclusions
    in Section 4. 2. Methodology The study employed a systematic literature review
    to select and analyze scientific research on Industry 4.0 technologies applied
    in agriculture and their associated environmental, economic, and social gains.
    Bibliometrics enabled the identification of diverse publications, along with the
    use of quantitative and graphical data [40] and a systematic literature review
    to develop content analysis, coding, and categorization of data [41]. The systematic
    review applied in this research is characterized as a scientific, replicable,
    and transparent method [42]. Data verification was performed by two researchers
    to reduce researcher error and bias [43], by filtering the selected research [44]
    through systematic reviews and analyses with the adoption of inclusion and exclusion
    criteria [45]. The initial stage of planning the systematic literature review
    involved the definition of the research protocol, which included the search strategies,
    selection criteria, and analysis of the selected articles. For this study, the
    research objective was to propose a Service Architecture that enables the promotion
    of a Circular Economy in Agriculture 4.0. The next step was the definition of
    the search terms and a consistent scientific procedure, including the definition
    of a set of keywords referring to Industry 4.0-enabling technologies. They were
    created as shown in Table A1, and with the use of logical operators OR and AND,
    the search strings were built in the Scopus digital library, as presented in Table
    A2. For the information collection step, the authors utilized the Scopus database
    chosen for its technical and scientific content, as well as content from areas
    related to the objectives of this article. A total of 1425 articles were identified,
    and these will be comprehensively detailed in the Bibliometrics section (Section
    3.1). In Table A3, the inclusion and exclusion criteria utilized in the systematic
    literature review are presented. A systematic literature review was undertaken,
    revealing a total of 755 articles. From this pool, 271 articles underwent thorough
    content analysis, leading to the identification of 114 articles specifically addressing
    the application of Industry 4.0 technologies in agriculture, as illustrated in
    Table 1. Table 1. Industry 4.0 technologies used in farms, production, and supply
    chain in the food agriculture sector. 1 = Farm; 2 = Factory; 3 = Supply Chain;
    4 = Big Data. 3. Service Architecture for Smart Agriculture In this section, the
    bibliometric review and the proposed Service Architecture for smart agriculture
    will be presented. 3.1. Bibliometrics The initial search using the specified strings
    (refer to Table A1) resulted in a total of 1425 articles, categorized into various
    types, as outlined in Table A4. Figure 1 shows the number of studies classified
    by year. It is notable that there is a growing interest in the adoption of Industry
    4.0 technologies in agriculture. This interest is influenced by factors such as
    the increase in the world population and the necessity to produce higher-quality
    food, enhance productivity per hectare, and ensure sustainability throughout the
    agricultural chain. Figure 1. Distribution of selected articles published by year.
    The utilization of IoT on farms, as the most widely adopted technology, involves
    the incorporation of sensors and devices for measuring soil and environmental
    characteristics. Subsequently, the adoption of IoT technologies, the cloud, Big
    Data, and AI (artificial intelligence) [78] signifies that farms not only monitor
    soil and environmental data but also store them in cloud services. With the utilization
    of tools such as artificial intelligence within the Big Data ecosystem, they can
    already add value in business management and decision-making processes. Another
    crucial aspect is the integration of IoT and AI within a context where computing
    is transitioning to the edge, involving microcontrolled systems and artificial
    intelligence algorithms. This transition contributes to reducing latency in communication
    networks [86]. 3.2. Proposed Architecture Following the findings of the systematic
    literature review (Section 2), the articles were analyzed and evaluated based
    on their contribution to constructing a layered structure. This structure facilitates
    the organized placement and integration of technologies. Figure 2 illustrates
    the proposed architecture developed to promote a Circular Economy in Agriculture
    4.0. Figure 2. Proposed architecture. The architecture depicted in Figure 2 consists
    of sensors, connections between farm machinery, local and remote networks (via
    the Internet), cloud platforms, storage utilizing Big Data technologies, and computer
    systems operating both in the cloud and in computer centers. The information generated
    by expert systems, data analysis, and the utilization of artificial intelligence
    provides outputs in the form of dashboards, directs actions on connected equipment,
    and facilitates decision making, both at the strategic and operational levels.
    This architecture comprises three layers: the “Farm Scenery” data collection layer,
    the ”Cloud Storage” data collection layer, and the “Information Processing, Analysis,
    and Output” central processing layer responsible for processing and outputting
    information for decision making: “Farm Scenery” layer: Precision agriculture is
    conducted here through the application of Industry 4.0 technologies. This involves
    sensors for the automated real-time collection of agricultural data, including
    water consumption, land use, and other input variables. The sensors and machines
    are interconnected through wireless networks in an IoT system. “Cloud Storage”
    layer: Data collected via wireless sensor networks, positioned at various points
    in the plantation, are transmitted to the cloud. This process is facilitated by
    a gateway, which serves to convert communication technologies from the sensor
    network into Internet access technologies. “Information Processing, Analysis,
    and Output” layer: The received data undergo analysis using computational tools,
    and the resulting information is utilized for decision making, both at the control
    center level and within the farm itself. Information visualization is made accessible
    through graphic panels on local computers or mobile devices, printed reports,
    and commands for direct action on devices installed on the farm, thereby enabling
    some processes to be fully automated. The architecture will be elaborated by organizing
    the findings of the systematic literature review obtained from digital databases
    into the three layers of the proposed structure. 3.2.1. Farm Scenery Layer Data
    digitization in agriculture begins with identifying the variables to be controlled
    when planting on farms [84], such as temperature, moisture, and soil nutrients,
    as well as weather conditions such as humidity, air temperature, light, crop nutrients
    [76], and pest control [121]. IoT enables this through sensors installed at various
    points on the farm, exchanging information between electronic devices [113] and
    applied in agriculture to provide monitoring of weather, soil thermal conditions
    [81], and water [29,30], pest and disease detection [103], and product traceability
    [101]. Industry 4.0 technologies applied to agriculture enable real-time data
    collection, input management, soil control, disease prevention, increased production,
    optimizing resources, and generating income [114]. The use of drones with IoT
    sensors is already a possibility for data collection in scenarios where the installation
    of sensor networks is not possible [91]. Temperature affects crop growth and the
    breeding of bacteria, and through a system of collecting air and soil temperature
    and humidity, a mathematical model was developed that evaluates environmental
    conditions and compares them with established standards, generating alerts for
    decision making by farmers [126]. The need to reduce the use of natural resources
    such as water and fertilizers in agriculture, the treatment of waste generated
    in planting, harvesting, and food industry processing activities, and the increase
    in production [14] have been the driver for the deployment of Industry 4.0 technologies
    in agriculture [117]. The analysis of climate conditions for agriculture is based
    on three factors: resource management, ecosystem conservation [114], and adequate
    services to farmers using information technology, thus generating profitability,
    product quality, and reducing the environmental footprint, with less use of pesticides
    [90]. Crop irrigation uses a source of water that is transported through pipelines
    and with on-and-off actuating devices and valves that then control the flow of
    water. The amount of water depends on each crop, and several forms of irrigation
    can be used, such as drip, sprinkler, furrow, and manual [127]. A simulation of
    irrigation control applied on farms in Brazil, with the use of IoT technologies,
    is a model considering the parameters of water requirements and irrigation time,
    which directly affect water use efficiency and evapotranspiration [30]. On the
    other hand, a low-cost system with environmental data acquisition can provide
    measurements of air temperature and velocity, soil temperature, pH, and dissolved
    oxygen, and thus control plant growth and environmental impacts [26]. A potato
    production system in Cyprus [114] was developed by using a sensor network to collect
    air and soil characteristics, and the data were sent to the cloud, where they
    were stored and analyzed, thus providing services to farmers for pest control
    and commands for automatic irrigation and fertilization [95]. Climate change has
    a strong impact on agriculture, and parameters such as water scarcity, soil degradation,
    increased energy needs, population growth, and increased demand for food impact
    the search for solutions [114]. For instance, the construction of smart greenhouses
    makes it possible to manage environmental variables [113] with control of humidity,
    air quantity, temperature, and favorable characteristics for plants [28,111] using
    models to manage heating, ventilation, CO2 control, and artificial lighting in
    an infrastructure that contributes to precision, sustainable, and manageable agriculture
    [113]. The data collected by the various sensors dispersed throughout the crops
    need to be sent for storage and analysis to extract information that can assist
    in decision making and return automated commands for control, since the Internet
    is not yet fully available in agricultural areas. It becomes necessary to use
    wireless network technologies in agriculture digitization projects, collecting
    data from distributed sensors in the field [4,84]. Applications with wireless
    sensor networks in smart agriculture include covering large areas with interconnecting
    sensors [6] and gathering large amounts of data. Activities in agriculture have
    integrated IoT technologies in robotic systems and been applied in planting, harvesting,
    and food production to enable cooperation between workers and smart systems and
    information sharing in the food production chain [107]. A proposed innovative
    smart IoT-based system based on microprocessors and a Single-Board Computer (BSC)
    for data logging using various sensors [50] can monitor soil moisture, air humidity,
    air temperature, and UV light, supporting precision irrigation of crops and enabling
    real-time exploitation of data for minimization of errors, as well as forecasting.
    In Colombia, on a coffee farm, wireless sensor networks are used to collect leaf
    condition data remotely through image analysis processing, detect diseases on
    the plantation [94], and generate information for pesticide application. This
    strategy decreases the risks of crop loss and improves the productive performance
    of the farm [112]. Automated fertigation [109] is applied in precision agriculture
    by collecting data on moisture and soil characteristics, and through an IoT system
    and sensor networks with ZigBee technology, the system was developed to control
    fertilizer use and reduce water consumption [14], thus providing reduced environmental
    impacts [95]. The growth of the number of sensors scattered in agriculture can
    generate a large amount of data, and latency problems may occur in sending data
    through technologies such as Bluetooth in relevant virtual network scenarios [75].
    Applications using machine learning [93] with a prototype for acquiring data from
    multiple sensors, machine learning algorithms, Geo statistics, and localization
    of IoT devices [115] are examples. The case study using computer vision [94] and
    machine learning [27] for inspecting coffee leaves on a farm in Colombia is an
    important practical example. The use of tractors in agriculture [3] plays an important
    role in farms and [98] modern combustion systems with electronic systems, including
    the use of algorithms and artificial intelligence [78], managing fuel injection,
    reducing pollutant emissions, lowering fuel costs [5], and improving environmental
    and economic gains. Tractors equipped with GPS (Global Positioning System), through
    the CAN-BUS (Controller Area Network) protocol, transmit the data of tasks performed
    and, after analysis, evaluate the most appropriate use of the tractor, extending
    the useful life and reducing maintenance costs [87]. In research conducted in
    Brazil, agricultural machines equipped with automation technologies have proven
    very productive in sowing, spraying, fertilizing, and harvesting activities, doing
    so autonomously, with relevant economic gains and lower cost per hectare [3].
    An automatic irrigation control system using IoT, with data input from weather
    stations and soil moisture sensors interconnected by gateway LoRa (Long Range)
    networks and command messages sent by the MQTT protocol (Message Queuing Telemetry
    Transport) [6], adapts the efficient use of water on a plantation, generating
    savings and better product quality [8]. It is important to note that using advanced
    technologies such as IoT and AI to manage irrigation is a way to maximize crop
    yield while minimizing water consumption, in line with Agriculture 4.0 principles
    [51]. Nonetheless, intelligent sensing systems based on the edge-computing paradigm
    are essential for the implementation of Internet of Things (IoT) and Agriculture
    4.0 applications, and the development of edge-computing wireless sensing systems
    is required to improve sensor accuracy in soil and data interpretation [47]. The
    Farm Scenery layer is presented in Figure 3, and the environmental variables to
    be collected are environmental humidity, temperature, luminosity, temperature,
    pH, water flow, and soil parameters, as shown in Table 2. Figure 3. Farm Scenery
    layer of Integrated Service Architecture to promote Circular Economy in Agriculture
    4.0. Green Circle = Start Process, Red Circle = End Process, Dotted Line = Comments,
    Flat Line = Information Flow. Table 2. Input variables used for soil monitoring
    and irrigation. 3.2.2. Cloud Storage Layer The data collected through wireless
    sensor networks, installed at various points of the plantation, are sent to the
    cloud with the use of a gateway, which is equipment that converts communication
    technologies of the sensor network to Internet access technologies, such as networks
    with LoRa technology [79]. Smart horticulture incorporates a variety of technologies,
    devices, protocols, and computational models to enhance farming processes. Blockchain,
    Big Data, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and edge processing provide
    capabilities and solutions for storing, analyzing, and managing the vast data
    generated by components [74]. The data collected from sensors on the farm and
    sent for storage in a cloud environment (Figure 4) are transformed into information
    that will be used for decision making in agricultural management actions. Thus,
    autonomous systems of irrigation control and fertilizer application can be built,
    contributing to the economy of financial resources for the purchase of these inputs;
    environmental gains, with a reduction in the use of scarce resources in nature
    and in workers’ exposure to some of these products, are obtained, along with social
    gains, such as a reduction in diseases, accidents, and sick leave [102]. Figure
    4. Cloud Storage layer of the Integrated Service Architecture to promote Circular
    Economy in Agriculture 4.0. Dotted Line = Comments, Flat Line = Information Flow.
    With an architecture for monitoring variables of the air, soil, planting, and
    harvesting in a corn plantation and using sensors interconnected in wireless networks
    and communication gateways, the data are sent for cloud storage to allow its analysis
    [16]. 3.2.3. Information Processing, Analysis, and Output Layer After the stage
    of data analysis using computational tools and the extraction of information,
    the next stage is the output, with the visualization of information through graphical
    panels available on web pages or mobile devices such as smartphones, printed reports,
    and commands of action in devices installed on the farm, making some processes
    automated. The use of software for agricultural planning provides management of
    farms, the production chain, and the distribution of the food produced [121].
    The monitoring of environmental variables is context-sensitive and provides information
    to end-users such as farmers, agronomists, and traders for decision making and
    supporting agricultural production [16]. Machine learning plays an important role
    in data processing, collection, extraction, and mining activities using algorithms,
    neural networks, and artificial intelligence, which are applied in a variety of
    areas, such as energy, transportation, mining, shipping, healthcare, banking,
    security, and agriculture. Security requirements using machine learning in industrial
    systems [97], which analyze Blockchain-based strategies to preserve privacy in
    industrial systems with data security in sensors [19], can lead to product traceability
    and automated logistics management, saving time and financial resources [108]
    and decreasing food waste [88]. The application of machine learning and analysis
    techniques in agriculture and livestock provides productivity gains with the management
    of animal health and flock management, thereby improving land use, controlling
    animal nutrition, and reducing the environmental impacts generated [96]. The use
    of technologies in data processing in agriculture offers opportunities for the
    integration of diverse systems. A review of the technology standards used in cyber-physical
    systems (CPSs) [125] applied in advanced manufacturing builds the ontology of
    the 5C architecture layers (connection, conversion, computation, cognition, and
    configuration), thus enabling the integration of sensors, actuators, and protocols
    and their application in various areas. In agriculture, CPSs are used in planting
    and harvesting equipment, collecting information on soil conditions and water
    resources, and storage in cloud systems for further processing [107]. The use
    of IoT platforms with microservices involves independent processes acting on specific
    activities, such as, for example, data collection of soil, climate, and parameters
    of irrigated rice and cotton crops [110]. The platform involves hardware and software
    in the cloud, and focuses on irrigation management, presented scalability, flexibility,
    robustness, security, and performance, with possibilities of commercial applications
    in other agricultural crops. An infrastructure using low-cost IoT and free software
    code to monitor weather conditions in organic crops, in a greenhouse, automatically
    controls and generates information made available through graphs on web pages
    with HTML protocol (HyperText Markup Language) [28]. The organization of farms
    by management zones [109] reduces costs for fertilization, pesticides [82,83],
    and water, and with the agricultural records of each one, one can have a decision
    more suitable to the needs of the crop. This strategy applied in a vineyard in
    Spain allows the crops to be classified into three levels of interest: soil, plant,
    or product, thus creating a map with overlapping layers to determine wine quality
    [25]. Sugarcane is planted in several fields on a farm, and as the plantation
    matures, fields are selected for harvesting, which is called harvest windows.
    A model to guide planting and harvesting on farms in South Africa [122] caused
    increased productivity and optimization based on historical data collected when
    adjusted in real-time. A machine routing system is possible in sugar production
    using sensors and IoT techniques, replacing labor and providig more suitable routing,
    higher repeatability, decreased fuel consumption, and better process control,
    with economic and environmental gains [116]. The management of agricultural supply
    chain activities, with the adoption of ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems
    and BI (Business Intelligence) techniques, enables communication between those
    involved in the agricultural chain [105], more adequate control, faster solutions
    [7,104] to respond to climate variations, pest control, crop harvesting and management,
    and market trends [118]. Ref. [121] presents studies among farmers in Maranhão,
    Piauí, Tocantins, and western Bahia, in soybean, corn, cotton, coffee, sugarcane,
    beans, and fruit crops where production and marketing integration, material flow
    automation, data management, and more accurate diagnostics to support strategic
    decisions have been adopted as tools of smart farm managers. The presentation
    of information in graphical dashboards becomes a decision support tool for farmers,
    with the use of Internet environments and mobile devices making access much easier
    and more intuitive [7,28]. The Information Processing, Analysis, and Output layer
    is shown in the Figure 5. Figure 5. Information Processing, Analysis, and Output
    layer of the Integrated Service Architecture to promote Circular Economy in Agriculture
    4.0. Red Circle = End Process, Dotted Line = Comments, Flat Line = Information
    Flow. 3.2.4. Service Architecture for Smart Agriculture The substantial volume
    of data generated through the utilization of IoT in agriculture is stored via
    networks and cloud computing. Leveraging Big Data and analytics strategies, it
    facilitates enhanced production by aiding decisions concerning planting, harvesting,
    and production, and automatically issuing commands for irrigation, thereby saving
    the scarce resource of water [5]. A system facilitating the collection of crop
    data, including air temperature, humidity, and soil temperature, stored as input
    variables in the cloud, has undergone analysis to derive actionable insights for
    controlling corn crop cultivation [16]. Utilizing a wireless network architecture
    to connect sensors and a LoRa communication gateway for data transmission to the
    cloud, the subsequent step involves data analysis and extraction of information
    for decision making. This process also includes sending commands to regulate irrigation
    valves, fertilizing devices, lighting control, and heating/cooling systems, embodying
    an autonomous application [16]. A prototype for autonomous irrigation, developed
    and deployed in a farmer cooperative in Spain, gathers data on air temperature,
    humidity, and soil characteristics. These data are transmitted via a LoRa network
    with a coverage range of 5 km to a cloud server. Subsequent analysis returns commands
    for irrigation control, while mobile applications provide information to farmers
    [100]. In Indonesia, image processing using machine learning algorithms was applied
    on a cocoa farm. Texture data of the beans, collected remotely and transmitted
    to the cloud, underwent classification using artificial intelligence techniques,
    demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional visualization methods
    [106]. The processing of vast sensor-generated data on farms is routed to the
    cloud [114,119]. Leveraging Big Data tools [85,117], these data are analyzed and
    converted into actionable information for managerial decision making and issuing
    automation commands for field equipment. A decision support system incorporating
    AI and a suite of machine learning algorithms aids in enhancing overall crop harvest
    quality and accuracy in precision agriculture [52]. This research utilized a dataset
    downloaded from Kaggle, containing eight features with seven independent variables,
    including N, P, K, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall. Furthermore, optimization
    techniques were employed to further enhance performance in smart factories. Figure
    6 illustrates the complete design of the Integrated Service Architecture derived
    from the results of the systematic literature review of selected articles, aimed
    at promoting the Circular Economy in Agriculture 4.0. Figure 6. Operational vision

    Analysis, and Output” within the Integrated Service Architecture aimed at advancing
    the Circular Economy in Agriculture 4.0, the references are categorized according
    to their respective applications, including irrigation control systems, fertilizer
    and pesticide application, crop management, greenhouses, and organization and
    management. These classifications are presented in Table 3 for clarity and ease
    of reference. Table 3. Management systems and outputs used in Intelligent Agriculture.
    3.2.5. Economic, Environmental, and Social Gains The integration of Industry 4.0
    technologies in agriculture empowers farmers with control over crucial resources
    such as water, nutrients [109], pesticides, energy, machinery, robotic devices
    [77], and human resources [32]. Data-driven decision making and innovative business
    models [119] are instrumental in enhancing production strategies [13], reutilizing
    process waste [114], and minimizing losses across the agribusiness chain. Consequently,
    economic benefits can be assessed by analyzing the efficient management of input
    resources utilized in production, alongside the increased availability of high-quality
    products offering added value to consumers. This added value encompasses aspects
    such as product differentiation, enriched nutritional content, and innovative
    packaging strategies, contributing to market competitiveness and profitability
    in agriculture. Environmental benefits are quantifiable through monitoring resource
    consumption indicators such as water usage, nutrient management, and greenhouse
    gas emissions. Furthermore, sustainable agricultural practices may lead to ecosystem
    restoration, biodiversity conservation, and soil health improvement, thereby enhancing
    environmental value and resilience. Social benefits encompass improvements in
    food security [1], reduced dependency on hazardous inputs, and the creation of
    employment opportunities in rural areas [32]. Initiatives fostering inclusivity
    and community engagement contribute to the formation of social capital and overall
    societal well-being. 3.2.6. Circular Economy Important resources for food production
    are wasted, with only 40% of irrigation water reaching the plants, and merely
    5% of the applied fertilizer being transformed into nutrients absorbed by humans.
    Soil degradation affects between 30 and 85% of agricultural land, exacerbating
    food insecurity issues [39]. Following the linear production model for food production
    is no longer sustainable, especially in a scenario where necessary resources are
    increasingly scarce [128]. Therefore, to minimize the utilization of finite natural
    resources, it is imperative to adopt the principles of Circular Economy, which
    include preserving and enhancing natural capital by managing finite stocks and
    balancing renewable resource flows, optimizing resource yields through the circulation
    of products, components, and materials in technical and biological cycles, and
    fostering system effectiveness by addressing and mitigating negative externalities
    [39]. Figure 7 illustrates systems of the Circular Economy in a diagram, showcasing
    the management flow of renewable energy and finite materials, while highlighting
    the fundamental principles of circularity. Figure 7. Diagram of Circular Economy
    systems [129]. In the systematic literature review on Agriculture 4.0 and the
    associated technologies, only two articles were identified that mentioned the
    Circular Economy, along with a study outlining the barriers to its adoption [84],
    highlighting the lack of incentive and governmental support. Main challenges identified
    include pesticide usage and unproductive laborers [83]. Although the Circular
    Economy was not explicitly referenced, several articles demonstrated evidence
    of its application. Therefore, based on the ReSOLVE framework, evidence of Circular
    Economy implementation in Agriculture 4.0 was identified. This includes models
    for Regenerate (soil regeneration, nutrient recovery, utilization of renewable
    energy, and finite resource reuse), Share (equipment and technology sharing, as
    well as waste sharing), Optimize (automation, pesticide and water usage optimization,
    and energy consumption optimization), Loop (remanufacturing, reverse logistics,
    and recycling), Virtualize (information virtualization and remote service utilization),
    and Exchange (integration of new technologies such as IoT, cloud, Big Data, and
    robotics). The ReSOLVE framework operationalizes these principles through six
    key actions: Regenerate, Share, Optimize, Loop, Virtualize, and Exchange, as shown
    in Figure 8. Figure 8. Framework ReSOLVE—adapted from [130]. These actions involved
    analyzing the articles to ascertain the evidence of Circular Economy usage, which
    was then compiled and is presented in Table 4. Table 4. Variables to evaluate
    evidence of practices of use of Circular Economy in Agriculture 4.0. 4. Conclusions
    This paper presents a systematic literature review on Industry 4.0 technologies
    applied in agriculture, analyzing 114 selected articles to fulfill the research
    objective of proposing an integrated Service Architecture to promote the Circular
    Economy in Agriculture 4.0. A systematic literature review is chosen over traditional
    analysis due to its comprehensive and rigorous synthesis of existing research,
    which provides a nuanced understanding of the topic and helps identify gaps in
    the literature. This approach ensures that the work is grounded in thorough knowledge
    of existing research, enhancing the credibility and validity of the findings and
    advancing knowledge in the field. Research indicates that farms are increasingly
    leveraging IoT for sensor connectivity as a foundational step towards embracing
    a data-centric approach. This transition is underscored by a shift towards a culture
    of data-driven decision making, facilitated by the integration of advanced analytics
    and AI within cloud-based Big Data ecosystems. This research adds to our understanding
    of how Industry 4.0 technologies are currently applied in agriculture, identifying
    both the technologies used and their application areas. Studies have shown that
    farms are utilizing Industry 4.0 technologies for irrigation control [6,30,109,110,114,120];
    fertilizer and inputs [95,110,114]; planting and harvest management [26,28,111,116];
    agricultural greenhouse systems [113]; and area-based planting organization [7,25,109,121,122].
    A few studies were found on evaluating economic, environmental, and social gains
    generated by adopting Industry 4.0 technologies on farms and the connection between
    Industry 4.0 technologies adopted on farms and the Circular Economy. Therefore,
    the authors proposed an Integrated Service Architecture to promote the Circular
    Economy in Agriculture 4.0, composed of three layers: Farm Scenery, Cloud Storage,
    and the Information Processing, Analysis, and Output layer. The Farm Scenery layer
    is responsible for executing precision agriculture, utilizing sensors to automatically
    collect data and interconnecting them through wireless networks in a system known
    as the Internet of Things. The Cloud Storage layer is responsible for gathering
    data from various points on the plantation and transmitting them to cloud servers,
    facilitated by gateways. The Information Processing, Analysis, and Output layer
    is tasked with analyzing the received data. It utilizes tools from the Big Data
    ecosystem to generate information, aiding in decision making, issuing automatic
    commands to activate irrigation control equipment and inputs, and presenting management
    reports on graphical screens accessible via computers or mobile devices. These
    reports encompass economic, environmental, and social gains. This paper enriches
    existing theory by introducing a novel Service Architecture designed to advance
    Circular Economy principles within Agriculture 4.0. The proposed framework aims
    to foster economic, environmental, and social benefits, thereby enhancing sustainability
    in agricultural practices. The practical contribution centers on developers’ ability
    to utilize the proposed architecture to construct monitoring systems with IoT,
    applications for decision-making analysis, and management tools, fostering a data-driven
    decision culture on farms. The societal contribution lies in the potential to
    alleviate food insecurity and reduce waste. As a limitation of this research,
    its initial application is solely on farms. However, there is potential for expansion
    into the broader agribusiness supply chain as future prospects emerge. Future
    research includes adapting this Integrated Service Architecture for use in other
    activities within the agricultural chain, incorporating specific input variables
    and output indicators on screens and autonomous systems as needed. Another possibility
    is integrating other actors in the agribusiness chain into the Integrated Service
    Architecture, thereby enhancing the management of the agricultural ecosystem.
    Additionally, it can broaden the practical applications or policies that stem
    from this study. Author Contributions Conceptualization, W.A.V., G.C.d.O.N. and

    farmingFuzzy logicNational food security 1. Introduction Agriculture poses a significant
    concern for humanity, as it is the primary source of food production. Many individuals
    suffer from hunger due to food scarcity, particularly in Third-world countries
    [22]. Food scarcity has been associated with socioeconomic elements like the expanding
    population [48]. Over the last five decades, the global population has risen by
    3–6 billion, intensifying the demand for food resources [5,35]. Shockingly, hunger
    led to the chronic malnourishment of over 800 million people worldwide in 2016.
    Furthermore, more than 10 million individuals perish annually due to starvation
    [14]. Therefore, increasing food production is crucial in eradicating hunger and
    poverty. However, the reality is far from simple; agriculture remains largely
    unmodernized in many countries, leading to low food output [44]. Due to this necessity,
    there is a requirement for the advancement of intelligent agriculture by enhancing
    farming methods beyond conventional practices, which is crucial to boosting production
    yields qualitatively. This necessitates integrating constantly evolving technological
    innovations [49]. Its purpose is to empower farming methods to match agricultural
    production with the increasing population, thereby reducing prevalent hunger [2].
    The global rise in mushroom cultivation can be attributed to the nutritional richness
    and distinctive culinary characteristics of mushrooms [50]. There is a forecast
    that the worldwide mushroom market will achieve a volume of 24.05 million tons
    by 2028 [21]. Regrettably, mushrooms have not garnered significant interest among
    farmers due to the high labor requirement during the practice. Additionally, cultivating
    specific mushroom varieties poses challenges, especially in regions where wild
    mushroom cultivation is prevalent [17]. Unlike most agricultural species, mushrooms
    must be cultivated in a specific environment, avoiding high temperatures and low
    humidity to achieve the most favorable harvest [[18], [19]]. Historically, mushrooms
    have been naturally grown in the wild and harvested from their natural habitats
    [36], affecting the harvest of this crucial agricultural product. Over the past
    ten years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has become a crucial tool across various
    domains [53]. Specifically in agriculture, IoT is employed to create interconnected
    farming systems that optimize productivity while conserving resources [26]. This
    advanced technology enables farmers to enhance agricultural productivity sustainably
    with reduced environmental risks [31,47]. Through the deep integration of state-of-the-art
    technologies such as deep learning, artificial intelligence, IoT, and cloud computing,
    smart agriculture represents a strategic approach for the agricultural sector
    to autonomously monitor, control, and make informed decisions with the assistance
    of information and knowledge [1,4,39]. This integration is achieved through the
    deployment of IoT sensors in agricultural practices. This proves particularly
    beneficial in agricultural activities, especially for crops that demand extra
    care during cultivation, such as mushrooms. Numerous research endeavors have explored
    mushroom cultivation by incorporating various intelligent systems, primarily concentrating
    on regulating temperature and air humidity through automated watering systems
    [32]. Nevertheless, other crucial factors remain overlooked in mushroom plant
    cultivation, such as managing light exposure [23], addressing insect disruptions
    [9] and utilizing natural or artificial lights a crucial environmental factor
    that significantly enhances the quality of edible mushrooms before and after harvest
    [24,27,33,54]. These factors play a vital role in the growth and metabolism of
    mushrooms, influencing mycelium characteristics (growth rate, density, and color)
    and the physical appearance of fruiting bodies (stalk, cap, and color formation)
    [23]. It is worth clarifying that light plays a major role in the cultivation
    of edible mushrooms [52]. Moreover, the research work of Bellettini et al. [8]
    focused on the identification of the presence of insects, mites, crustaceans,
    and other arthropods that feed on mushrooms, as well as decomposers on synthetic
    or wooden substrates, as detrimental factors to the optimal growth of mushrooms.
    It is worth noting that Bellettini et al. [8] presented a challenge of manually
    addressing the issues of external agent''s presence, which can be mitigated by
    automatically spraying the pesticide on the farm. To alleviate the challenges
    with the current mushroom production, this study aims to provide an IoT-based
    system that integrates various modules to intelligently control vital parameters:
    temperature, humidity, substrate moisture, light intensity, and pest management.
    The proposed method integrates Fuzzy Logic (FL) in the IoT module to enable the
    sensor-recorded data use as enablers of the system functionality based on their
    comparison with the pre-recorded standard data, specifying optimal ranges for
    each vital parameter. The system triggers actuators when sensor data falls outside
    the desired range to keep the environmental parameters of the farm in the desired
    range, effective for mushroom cultivation. It is important to note that the proposed
    method incorporates self-decision-making through FL, a mathematical modeling technique
    mimicking human decision-making. To achieve our objectives, the contributions
    of this work are highlighted as follows: 1. Monitoring the sensors'' recorded
    data for an intelligent and adaptive environment, ensuring optimal conditions
    for mushroom cultivation, and automating the farm''s vital environmental parameters.
    2. Optimizing agricultural resources, namely, water and pesticide, by introducing
    the sensors not used in the previous works. Keeping the objective of this work
    under the mushroom cultivation field, the diversification of our method leads
    to a more nuanced understanding of the environmental factors that can be applied
    to several types of mushrooms. The structure of this paper is outlined as follows:
    In Section 2, the literature review and the current state of the art about the
    focal point of this study are presented. Section 3 outlines the design and methodology
    employed in this work. The results are deliberated in Section 4, with concluding
    remarks provided in the last Section 5. 2. Literature review and materials 2.1.
    Existing literature Intelligent environmental control applications have successfully
    enhanced agricultural applications, particularly in mushroom farming research.
    The research works in Jararweh et al. [28] employed FL connected to various actuators,
    which have been adjusted based on the data gathered during the process. The results
    obtained by Jararweh et al. [28] showed significant improvement over the existing
    works. However, optimal farm control has not been achieved. The study by Chandrappa
    et al. [12] focused on using sensor automation technology to aid farmers in making
    manual and automatic agricultural decisions. However, these efforts mainly concentrated
    on monitoring moisture content in the substrate, air temperature, and humidity
    in the mushroom field, ignoring other crucial parameters that may impact the quality
    and quantity of the mushroom yield. Factors such as cultivation techniques, mechanical
    damage, storage conditions, and post-harvest manipulation also play a significant
    role [11,40]. It is worth noting that the integration of FL in agricultural applications
    [13,29,30,42] has been proven to be one of the most efficient techniques to control
    the variation of the farms’ parameters based on the classification of the data
    in place classification in various sets. The introduction of IoT in agricultural
    applications has also shown promising improvement in crop production, such as
    in Marzuk and Ying [34] and Thong-u and Wongsaroj [45]. Specifically, the work
    by Thong-un and Wongsaroj [45] conducted across three mushroom fields and one
    adjacent sample area, employing wireless communication to merge the data from
    these fields utilized the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol
    to centralize information from each field, which was then uploaded to an online
    platform. Similarly, Marzuki and Ying [34] utilized an online interface for real-time
    monitoring. However, their approach involved a more comprehensive array of sensors,
    measuring additional parameters such as air temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide
    levels, and light quality. They used ThingSpeak as a cloud platform connected
    to the web-based visualization window. Moreover, the work of Rahman et al. [38]
    automated agricultural decisions and executed the process according to fixed time
    interval-based schedules. 2.2. The state-of-the-art Edible mushrooms are highly
    prized for their nutritional and medicinal properties, thanks to the presence
    of diverse bioactive elements, including proteins, polyunsaturated fatty acids,
    polysaccharides, dietary fibres, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals, making them
    a valuable food resource [3]. Due to their nutritional and medicinal advantages,
    mushrooms have gained widespread popularity worldwide in recent years. Global
    mushroom production has jumped 21.3 times since 1990, reaching 44 million tons
    in 2021 [7]. Various research works have predicted that the worldwide mushroom
    market will achieve a volume of 24.05 million tons by 2028 [21]. These statistics
    demonstrate that mushrooms are a natural resource experiencing growing demand
    annually. Considering this information, various cultivation methods have been
    created by preserving traditional practices or incorporating technological advancements.
    Some research has shown that implementing innovative cultivation techniques in
    mushroom farming can boost production to meet the annual demand figures. The significance
    of mushrooms in sustaining human life is underscored in earlier sections, emphasizing
    the role of technology in enhancing agricultural productivity and highlighting
    the importance of technology, particularly the IoT, as a solution to enhance efficiency
    in agriculture, leading to the development of intelligent crop production systems.
    This study applies IoT to intelligently monitor the substrate for mushroom cultivation
    based on the features of existing works, such as sensor integration, digital data
    transmission, and wireless sensor networks. These technologies enable diverse
    devices, fostering IoT implementation in agriculture. Intelligent irrigation,
    optimized fertilizer usage, pest control, and water and soil quality monitoring
    are among the practices benefiting from IoT applications [41]. Wireless Sensor
    Networks facilitate crop monitoring and intelligent agricultural applications
    by enabling long-distance communication and enhancing energy efficiency [51].
    Monitoring technologies within IoT solutions play a crucial role in ensuring food
    safety and quality. Furthermore, IoT-based solutions establish information networks
    for effective decision-making and product management for crops and the entire
    agricultural supply chain. Integrating networks, sensors, and data processing
    offers water-use solutions, especially in regions with limited water resources.
    This leads to water conservation and food security. IoT technology also provides
    real-time information, reduces labor, enhances productivity in planting activities,
    and promotes efficient water usage. Furthermore, the impact of this information
    extends to the utilization of lighting, pumps, and agricultural machinery [41].
    FL is an approach to reasoning that relies on approximations and assumptions,
    mirroring human thought processes. FL-based algorithms have extensive applications
    in areas like data hiding based on adaptability [17,46], automation of production
    lines [37], and digital images forensics with steganalysis [15,16]. FL represents
    an improvement over Boolean logic by introducing the concept of partial truth
    [45]. FL, on the other hand, incorporates the highest Boolean logic value with
    a degree of truth ranging between 0 and 1. One of the critical advantages of FL
    is its departure from classical logic, enabling the direct utilization of expert
    knowledge without the need for extensive training. It also integrates seamlessly
    with conventional control methods rooted in natural language [10]. It is crucial
    to note that FL is known for its superior energy efficiency compared to classical
    logic [6]. Applying FL, which involves setting a threshold value for the desired
    parameter unit to regulate the environmental factors in agricultural crop cultivation,
    specific parameters are defined as reference points for the implementation and
    tailored to the individual sensors utilized in the test area. Typically, FL is
    integrated into agricultural machinery automation systems to administer treatments
    based on the derived decisions. Based on the in-depth analysis, this research
    proposes a new IoT-based smart system using FL to manage the environmental parameters
    of the mushroom cultivation substrate. The proposed system incorporates sensors
    such as light intensity and infrared sensors to gather more comprehensive information
    aligning with the specific needs of mushroom plants to regulate parameters like
    lighting levels and manage the presence of insects, which significantly affect
    mushroom production. 3. Methodology This section outlines the overall approach
    and fundamental principles of the model under consideration. It comprises five
    crucial subsections that detail the proposed system''s important features. In
    this article, we employ FL to self-regulate the vital parameters within the mushroom
    substrate to improve the existing methods based on traditional human-controlled
    methods. 3.1. Workflow overview of the proposed model This subsection provides
    comprehensive details of the proposed model''s workflow in Fig. 1. The proposed
    model mainly comprises sensors, actuators, and cloud components. It is worth noting
    that the proposed model delves into a detailed examination of the various modules
    employed, elucidating their contributions to the overall functionality of the
    proposed method. Download : Download high-res image (351KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. Comprehensive architecture of the proposed method. The
    system is crafted using two microcontrollers, with the primary microcontroller,
    NodeMCU ESP8266, serving as the central hub for data acquisition and embedded
    FL control. Simultaneously, the secondary microcontroller, Arduino UNO, is dedicated
    to disseminating information to farmers through a web-based platform. Additionally,
    specific sensors tailored to the environmental control needs of mushroom plants
    have been chosen. These sensors are connected to the main microcontroller, which
    reads and processes data. The gathered data are compiled into data packets before
    being transmitted and then uploaded to a digital platform. The schematic circuit
    for the designed system is illustrated in Fig. 2. As previously described, the
    main microcontroller incorporates FL to autonomously determine the treatment and
    decision-making in managing the environmental control process. The user can control
    all these parameters based on the real-time data recorded concerning the soil
    moisture, temperature, humidity and light intensity. Download : Download high-res
    image (352KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Circuit diagram of the
    proposed method. 3.2. Data collection To collect the data, this work uses the
    sensor unit. The sensors unit comprises dedicated sensors designed to focus on
    specific parameters established as references in this work. These sensors encompass
    a soil moisture meter, a light sensor for measuring light intensity levels, a
    temperature and humidity measuring sensor for recording ambient temperature and
    humidity, and a motion detection sensor. Calibration has been conducted on all
    sensors to avoid acquiring irrelevant data values that could result in irregularities
    during the operational process. 3.2.1. Soil moisture sensing The chosen sensor
    for measuring soil moisture content is the Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor v1.2.
    This selection is based on its capability to measure soil moisture levels using
    capacitive sensing. Constructed with corrosion-resistant materials and coated
    with a layer of PCB paint, this sensor offers an extended service life and an
    aesthetically pleasing appearance. Its operation involves measuring changes in
    capacitance resulting from variations in soil electrolyte content. With an operating
    voltage range of approximately 3.3 to 5.5 V, the sensor is well-suited for application
    with microcontrollers that typically output low voltages, such as 3.3 V or 5 V,
    as used in this work. 3.2.2. Light intensity sensing This work employs a module-based
    Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) to measure light intensity levels. The rationale
    behind selecting this module is the work''s preference for output in the form
    of an analog value regarding light intensity levels, and this module is more straightforward
    to implement. As its name implies, this sensor relies on a resistor whose resistance
    value can vary based on the received light levels. This module operates at a compatible
    voltage, making it suitable for integration into this project. The module can
    capture light intensity levels ranging from 0.1 to 10,000 lux. On the other hand,
    this sensor''s resistance value spans 0.1 to 1000 kΩ. Additionally, it can function
    within a temperature range of −60 to 75 Celsius, aligning with the optimal temperature
    and humidity conditions for mushrooms, maintaining elevated humidity levels and
    lower temperature levels. 3.2.3. Temperature and humidity sensing The optimal
    temperature required for mushroom cultivation ranges from 22 to 28 Celsius, while
    the optimal air humidity ranges from 80 % to 90 % [38]. Therefore, the DHT22 sensor
    is employed to measure the air temperature and humidity levels. Its use of a calibrated
    digital signal output enhances its effectiveness. Moreover, its low voltage requirement
    underscores the sensor''s suitability, operating within the 3.3 to 6 V DC range.
    The sensor exhibits a measurement range of 0–100 % for air humidity, with an accuracy
    of +-2 %, and −40 to 80 Celsius for temperature, with an accuracy of 0.5 degrees
    Celsius difference. Notably, the sensor demonstrates responsive performance, boasting
    an average sensing period of 2 s. These attributes make the DHT22 sensor a promising
    choice for implementing intelligent agricultural environmental control processes.
    3.2.4. Motion detection sensing Detecting the presence of insects is a crucial
    consideration in all stages of crop cultivation. Farmers can identify the presence
    of insects using a sensor known as the Passive Infrared Receiver (PIR), with the
    HC-SR501 PIR sensor specifically employed in this work. This module detects the
    levels of infrared radiation the embedded pyroelectric module receives. The sensor
    exhibits noteworthy sensitivity, featuring an adjustable sensitivity range and
    a detection area angle of approximately 110 degrees from the sensor knob. Moreover,
    it can detect movement between 3 and 7 m perpendicularly. Despite its capabilities,
    the sensor is power-efficient, requiring only a low power supply within the range
    of 5 to 12 V and accommodating temperatures from −15 to 70 Celsius. These attributes
    make the sensor highly suitable for the requirements of this work. 3.3. Data processing
    The data processing is mainly based on the controlling unit. For the controller
    unit of this study, two microcontrollers are employed, each with distinct roles.
    Both microcontrollers are supplied with a working voltage of 9 V using a power
    supply. This facilitates the implementation of the designed tool, allowing direct
    connection to electricity with a higher voltage range of 220–240 V. The primary
    microcontroller reads and processes data from each sensor, enabling automatic
    decision-making to maintain optimal farm environmental conditions based on the
    implemented FL. The Arduino UNO R3 is the chosen controller for this processing
    task. The selection is based on the specific pin requirements for this project,
    where two analog pins and ten digital pins are necessary. The two analog pins
    are utilized to interface with the Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor and LDR Sensor,
    as the data processing for these sensors rely on acquiring analog values. Additionally,
    the ten digital pins serve various purposes. Two are allocated for connecting
    the DHT22 and PIR sensors, two receivers (RX) and a Transmitter (TX) establish
    communication with other microcontrollers, and the remaining six are designated
    for connecting relays with six channels. Given the inherent incapacity of the
    main microcontroller, Arduino UNO R3, to establish an internet connection, an
    additional microcontroller is employed to facilitate data upload to the internet
    in this work. This component is called NodeMCU ESP8266, featuring an embedded
    ESP8266 WiFi Module chip that enables seamless internet connectivity. By utilizing
    this embedded chip, this module assumes the role of an agent responsible for executing
    the data upload process to the chosen web-based digital platform. Consequently,
    it facilitates the real-time presentation of agricultural land data to farmers.
    3.4. Cloud platform As previously mentioned, using two microcontrollers accommodates
    all acquired sensor data. It facilitates its upload to a web-based digital platform
    named ThingerIO. The data obtained by Arduino UNO R3 is transmitted to NodeMCU
    ESP8266 through serial communication. This communication is established by reverse
    interconnecting each module''s RX and TX pins. On the Arduino UNO microcontroller,
    pin D0 is the RX, and pin D1 is the TX. In contrast, on the NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller,
    pin D6 is designated as the RX and D7 as the TX. The data transmission initiates
    with NodeMCU ESP8266 initializing a data request through the serial transmission
    of a specific character to Arduino UNO R3. Subsequently, Arduino UNO R3 continually
    checks for requests at intervals of 2 s. Upon detecting a data request, Arduino
    UNO R3 consolidates the sensor data into a single packet. Then, it transmits it
    to NodeMCU ESP8266 via serial communication. 3.5. System functionality This section
    provides a comprehensive overview of the design and functionality of the proposed
    system. It delves into the intricacies of the system''s architecture, elucidating
    the operation of FL within specified parameter boundaries established in this
    study. Fig. 3 illustrates the system''s overall workflow, outlining the specifics
    of input segmentation derived from various sensors. The process includes a detailed
    examination of microcontrollers and the integration of FL, ultimately resulting
    in automated and intelligent monitoring control. Download : Download high-res
    image (244KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Workflow of the smart
    farming unit. 3.5.1. Data acquisition The Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor is linked
    to pin A0 on the Arduino UNO R3 using analog pins. Consequently, the data displayed
    on the Arduino is initially in the form of raw analog data, which is then transformed
    into a percentage format using the map() function, designating 0 as the lower
    limit and 100 as the upper limit. This conversion results in a final percentage
    value for the Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor within the 0–100 per cent range.
    Similarly, the LDR sensor is connected to pin A2 on the Arduino UNO R3, and its
    initial output is raw analog data. A formula derived from the calibration process
    is applied to convert this value into lux, utilizing the coefficient values obtained
    from a previously conducted linear regression. The × value represents this equation''s
    analog data obtained from the LDR. The DHT22 is linked to pin D4 on the Arduino
    UNO R3 for digital pins. With the assistance of the available library, incorporating
    the DHT22 sensor into the system is a straightforward process. The acquired data
    from the DHT22 sensor provides direct outputs in degrees Celsius for temperature
    and percentage values for humidity. Moving on to the next sensor, PIR, is connected
    to pin D3 on the Arduino UNO R3. In the program, this sensor is designated as
    a digital input value. It is solely utilized to display acquisition data within
    the ``high'''' and ``low'''' value ranges. The other digital pin connects two
    relays, each comprising 4 and 2 channels, with each relay point linked to pins
    D6-D11 on the Arduino UNO R3. In addition, for the power requirements of all the
    modules, this work does not establish a direct connection between the sensors''
    two power pins (GND and VCC) and relays with the power pin on the Arduino UNO
    R3. Instead, these pins are directly linked to the primary 9 V power source obtained
    from the power supply, which has been reduced to a 5 V voltage using a 3296 step-down
    module. 3.5.2. Decision making The actuation decision in the mushroom farm depends
    on the output from the Fuzzy Inference System (FIS). The implementation of Fuzzy
    Logic (FL) is utilized to produce appropriate output based on the given input.
    This study involves five input parameters: soil moisture (Moist), light intensity
    (Light), temperature (Temp), humidity (Hum), and motion detection (Mot). Each
    parameter has a distinct number of memberships based on the specific characteristics
    of the variable it represents. Soil moisture, air temperature, motion detection,
    and humidity typically have three memberships (low, medium, and high) using a
    triangular membership function to capture the varying states relevant to the desired
    ranges. Light intensity is set to have four memberships (very low, low, medium,
    and high) utilizing a trapezoidal membership function, allowing for more nuanced
    categories that align with the specific illumination needs in the mushroom farm.
    For all parameters, the choice of memberships is tailored to the inherent complexities
    and variations of each parameter, enabling the fuzzy logic system to effectively
    model the intricacies of the monitored conditions in applications like smart farming
    or agriculture. In essence, the preference for triangular and trapezoidal membership
    functions arises from their simplicity, ease of interpretation, and ability to
    accurately model the gradual and non-linear transitions inherent in agricultural
    and environmental parameters. While other membership functions like Gaussian,
    bell-shaped, or sigmoidal can be employed, their suitability depends on the specific
    characteristics of the parameters being modeled. Gaussian functions, for instance,
    are adept at representing symmetric and bell-shaped distributions but may not
    be as intuitive for the gradual transitions seen in agriculture. Similarly, bell-shaped
    functions may be suitable for certain parameters with a well-defined peak. However,
    they might not capture the asymmetry found in soil moisture or air temperature
    transitions. Sigmoidal functions, known for gradual transitions, may lack the
    flexibility needed to represent the specific ranges and categories vital in the
    mushroom cultivation context. The choice of triangular and trapezoidal membership
    functions for soil moisture, air temperature, motion detection, humidity, and
    light intensity in the context of mushroom cultivation proves advantageous due
    to their ability to accurately capture the nuanced and dynamic nature of environmental
    conditions. Triangular membership functions are well-suited for parameters like
    soil moisture, air temperature, motion detection, and humidity, as they allow
    for a smooth and gradual transition between low, medium, and high levels. This
    is crucial in representing the continuous and variable characteristics of these
    parameters in mushroom cultivation. Trapezoidal membership functions, on the other
    hand, provide a more flexible and detailed representation, particularly suitable
    for light intensity. In mushroom farming, where lighting conditions are pivotal
    for different growth stages, the trapezoidal function''s additional category allows
    for a more refined categorization of illumination levels. Triangular and trapezoidal
    membership functions offer precision, flexibility, and adaptability, making them
    superior choices for modeling the intricacies of the monitored conditions in smart
    mushroom farming. Drawing on the insights presented in [43], this research introduces
    a three-membership model for soil moisture, aiming to categorize moisture content
    into low, medium, and high ranges. A low soil moisture level (0 % to 30 %) suggests
    drier conditions that may hinder optimal mushroom growth. The medium soil moisture
    category (25 % to 70 %) represents a balanced range conducive to various stages
    of mushroom development. Conversely, high soil moisture (60 % to 100 %) indicates
    excessive wetness, posing challenges such as waterlogging and heightened vulnerability
    to diseases. Extending this methodology to air temperature, a three-membership
    model is applied. Low air temperature (0 °C to 15 °C) signals cooler conditions
    that might slow down mushroom development. The medium air temperature category
    (10 °C to 25 °C) supports diverse growth stages, from mycelium colonization to
    fruiting body formation. Conversely, high air temperature (20 °C to 30 °C) requires
    careful management to avoid heat stress. Furthermore, based on insights from [25],
    a three-membership model is employed for humidity. Low humidity (0 % to 50 %)
    suggests that drier conditions are less favorable for optimal mushroom growth.
    The medium humidity category (40 % to 70 %) represents a balanced range supporting
    various mushroom development stages. Conversely, high humidity (60 % to 100 %)
    indicates excess moisture, posing challenges like increased susceptibility to
    diseases and issues related to waterlogged substrate. Aligning with motion detection
    and light intensity, referenced by Sun et al., low motion detection indicates
    minimal movement, the standard condition during cultivation. Medium motion detection
    suggests occasional disturbances, while high motion detection indicates undesirable
    continuous motion in a controlled mushroom cultivation environment. Finally, regarding
    light intensity, this research employs a four-membership model to define distinct
    illumination levels. Very low light intensity (0 to 500 lux) is suitable for specific
    phases like spore germination. Low light intensity (400 to 1000 lux) caters to
    mycelium growth. Medium-light intensity (800 to 2000 lux) is conducive to various
    growth stages, including fruiting body formation. High light intensity (1500 to
    5000 lux) supports intense lighting conditions beneficial for mushroom maturation.
    The implementation of FL entails connecting the input values gathered from all
    sensors, which are then employed to ascertain the output values following a predefined
    set of rules (see Table 1). To achieve this, a series of if-then rules are devised
    to work in conjunction with the membership function of each parameter. The Mamdani''s
    type is chosen in this work due to its suitability for the proposed approach.
    In this context, the fuzzy output translates into the automation of various paired
    actuators. Table 1. Proposed fuzzy logic rules. IF soil moisture AND air temperature
    AND humidity AND motion detection AND light intensity THEN action Low (0–30 %)

    (Undesirable) High (1500–5000 lux) Decrease watering, Decrease temperature, Decrease
    humidity, Stop motion, Decrease light intensity Fig. 4 represents the design of
    this FL flow, focusing on how it is optimized. The optimization of fuzzy parameters
    in the proposed model involves a meticulous process tailored to each environmental
    parameter. Soil moisture, air temperature, humidity, motion detection, and light
    intensity are systematically categorized into appropriate membership functions
    and ranges. For soil moisture, a three-membership model is employed, with specific
    ranges such as low moisture (0 % to 30 %) hindering optimal growth and high moisture
    (60 % to 100 %) indicating excess wetness. Air temperature, humidity, and motion
    detection follow similar optimization, aligning temperature and humidity ranges
    with different growth stages. Download : Download high-res image (256KB) Download

    categories reflect the standard and undesirable movement during cultivation. Notably,
    light intensity is optimized with a four-membership model, allowing for precise
    categorization suited to the level of light needed in the mushroom farm. Following
    the data acquisition of these parameters, the subsequent step in the FL workflow
    involves fuzzification. Here, each parameter''s input value is adapted to conform
    with the established FL rules. This fuzzification process occurs within the rule
    evaluation segment, where several fuzzy membership rules are integrated. The outcome
    of this phase undergoes a defuzzification process, resulting in a fuzzy output
    value readable by the device and ready for further management to operate the connected
    actuator. 3.5.3. System monitoring This section details how sensor-acquired data
    becomes immediately accessible to farmers. The Arduino UNO R3 microcontroller
    oversees the data acquisition, packaging the dataset for transmission to the data-uploading
    microcontroller. Following receiving data from the Arduino UNO R3, the NodeMCU
    ESP8266 executes the data upload process to the web-based digital platform. The
    NodeMCU ESP8266 is configured to receive a Service Set Identifier (SSID) connection
    exclusively from a specific access point, as it can only connect to the singular
    SSID designated in the program. An LED indicator signifies a successful internet
    connection for the module. Once the NodeMCU ESP8266 receives the data, the subsequent
    step involves breaking down the data based on the acquisition from each sensor.
    After this breakdown, the data upload process unfolds on the digital platform.
    A deliberate delay is incorporated between each data upload event to prevent the
    potential occurrence of a data upload process deemed spam. The digital platform
    interface uses numeric, gauge, and graphical representations. Numerical and gauge-based
    information is consolidated within one feature, while graphical displays are presented
    separately. Each graph''s x-label provides detailed time information, while the
    y-label indicates specific data acquisition details. The x-label on each graph
    is intentionally designed with varying time intervals. For instance, the graphs
    depicting soil moisture, light intensity, and air humidity display data every
    5 s, while the graph for air temperature is programmed to show data every 30 s.
    This adjustment is made considering the responsiveness of the temperature changes,
    which necessitate a longer time frame compared to other parameters. 4. Result
    and discussion In this section, we present the results obtained and their related
    discussions. It is important to note that the features of the proposed method
    are based on its ability to assess soil moisture, air temperature, air humidity,
    and light intensity and identify the presence of insects. In line with the validation
    of the results, calibration is essential to verify that each sensor employed as
    a data retrieval module adheres to established measurement standards. Moreover,
    to provide the proposed method''s context and validate the findings, the preliminaries
    of this section consist of comparing the proposed mushroom cultivation model with
    baseline models as reported by Sun et al. [43] and Dela Cruz and De Leon [20].
    Table 2 presents a comparative analysis of baseline models commonly employed in
    mushroom cultivation, including Open Field Cultivation, Automated Watering Systems,
    Sensor Network-based Environment Control and IoT-based Environment Control. Each
    model is briefly characterized by its main features, outlining the strengths and
    limitations of these existing methodologies. The proposed new model, IoT and Fuzzy
    Logic-based Control is introduced as a comprehensive advancement. It integrates
    IoT for real-time data acquisition and fuzzy logic for adaptive and nuanced control.
    This integration aims to optimize environmental conditions for mushroom growth,
    addressing the shortcomings observed in the baseline models. Table 2. Comparison
    of the proposed model with benchmark algorithms. Model Main features Open field
    cultivation Traditional method with limited control over environmental parameters.
    Automated watering system Enhances water management but lacks adaptive control
    based on real-time conditions. Sensor network-based environment control Provides
    real-time data but may not adapt dynamically to varying cultivation needs. IoT-based
    environment control Offers remote monitoring and control but may require more
    sophisticated decision-making. Proposed IoT and fuzzy logic-based control Integrates
    IoT for real-time data and fuzzy logic for adaptive and nuanced control, optimizing
    environmental conditions for mushroom growth. The proposed IoT and Fuzzy Logic-based
    control model represents a significant advancement in mushroom cultivation methodologies,
    surpassing the capabilities of the baseline models in several key aspects. While
    traditional Open Field Cultivation and Automated Watering Systems offer basic
    approaches, they lack the adaptability and precision required for optimal growth.
    Sensor Network-based Environment Control and IoT-based Environment Control models
    provide real-time data. However, the former may not dynamically adapt, and the
    latter may face challenges in sophisticated decision-making. In contrast, our
    proposed model combines the strengths of IoT for continuous, real-time data acquisition
    and fuzzy logic for adaptive, nuanced control. This integration enables the system
    to make precise, context-aware adjustments based on the complex interplay of environmental
    variables, fostering an optimized and responsive cultivation environment. By leveraging
    these modern technologies, the comprehensive and advanced nature of our approach
    positions it as a valuable and innovative contribution to the field, poised to
    elevate the standards of mushroom cultivation practices. 4.1. Results based on
    sensor precision The soil moisture sensor undergoes calibration by obtaining analog
    values at two humidity levels: very wet (immersing the sensor in water) and dry
    (placing the sensor in a dry location). Subsequently, the map function is employed
    to convert the analog values into percentage values. Following this, calibration
    is executed using the Gouevn Soil Moisture Meter, comparing values acquired at
    four water depth points: 25 ml, 50 ml, 75 ml, and 100 ml. The outcomes of the
    soil moisture sensor calibration are detailed in Table 3. Post-calibration, the
    average error value is 4,79 %, indicating a high accuracy level of 95,21 %. Table

    error 4,79 Accuracy 95,21 In contrast to other sensors, the calibration procedure
    for this sensor involves comparing the reading from the reference sensor with
    the analog-to-analog-to-digital converter (ADC) value acquired. The Digital Lux
    Meter AS803 serves as the reference sensor in this process. The coefficient value
    is derived and then applied to the Arduino UNO R3 using the linear regression
    function. The x-value represents the ADC value from the sensor. At the same time,
    the y-value corresponds to the lux value determined through the comparative analysis.
    Like the previous step, the calibration is executed by re-evaluating and converting
    ADC values to lux values on the Light Dependent Resistor sensor against the digital
    readings on the reference measuring device. In this instance, the average error
    is 3,62 %, indicating a high accuracy level of 96,38 %. The outcomes of the light-dependent
    resistor sensor calibration are detailed in Table 4. The calibration of the DHT22
    involves comparing it with the Sanfix TH-308A. The data collection, performed
    nine times, includes air temperature measurements ranging from 16 to 40 degrees
    Celsius. Additionally, air humidity levels are measured using the Ultrasonic Humidifier
    Support Arduino module to manipulate humidity levels. Like the prior sensors,
    calibration is achieved by computing the average error value, resulting in a 97,33
    % accuracy for air temperature measurements and a 97,85 % accuracy for air humidity
    measurements, with an average error of 2,67 % for air temperature measurements
    and 2,15 % for air humidity measurements. The outcomes of the DHT22 sensor calibration

    overall system A crucial element in intelligent mushroom cultivation involves
    a real-time regulation of vital parameters in the farming space. This method benefits
    from the FL paradigm by optimizing the environmental parameters, ensuring favorable
    conditions for cultivation, and achieving high-quality productivity in mushroom
    farming. The FL program makes decisions to oversee multiple actuators, aiding
    in executing environmental control tasks for the mushroom farm. The evaluation
    process entails subjecting each measurement parameter to manipulated conditions
    and comparing it with sensor data. This work seeks to omit a timeframe for implementing
    FL to avoid excessive decision-making, significantly leading to potential overtreatment.
    The monitoring procedure is conducted using a web-based system with a sample interface
    illustrated in Fig. 5, which consists of a display accessible to farmers on a
    real-time basis. The interface gauge for soil moisture and air humidity depicts
    data in percentage units (%), ranging from a minimum value of 0 to a maximum value
    of 100. In contrast, the design of the interface gauge for light intensity differs.
    It presents data in lux units, with a minimum value of 58 lux (equivalent to a
    value of 1023 ADC on a Light Dependent Resistor) for dark conditions and a maximum
    value of 500 lux (equivalent to a value of 6 ADC on a Light Dependent Resistor)
    for bright conditions. The interface gauge for air temperature displays data in
    centigrade units, with a defined minimum value of 14 degrees Celsius and a maximum
    value of 40 degrees Celsius. Download : Download high-res image (483KB) Download

    information through an interface gauge, we have also incorporated information
    delivery to farmers through a graph, as depicted in Fig. 6. In this context, the
    graph serves as a data logger within a specified time frame. The x-axis of the
    graph represents time, while the y-axis displays data obtained from each sensor.
    We set one minute for soil moisture, air humidity, and light intensity graphs,
    with data appearing every five seconds. In the case of the air temperature graph,
    a period of three minutes is defined, with data appearing every thirty seconds.
    Graphs with one minute allow a precise observation of line level changes when
    the sensor registers data outside the reference range. In essence, FL can promptly
    provide information for decision-making on each actuator to execute environmental
    control in less than five seconds. Download : Download high-res image (664KB)

    techniques. Table 6 illustrates differences across various aspects of each study,
    including objectives and developed features. While all the studies in this section
    share the goal of enhancing environmental quality in mushroom crops, each focuses
    on distinct aspects. The detailed discussion on features is categorized into groups,
    such as the sensors used, the implemented technology communication model, and
    user-feedback applications on the job. Table 6. Features comparison between the

    wind and air. The diversity extends to the forms of technology communication and
    the availability of user-feedback applications. The proposed research employs
    various sensors for soil moisture, temperature, humidity, light intensity, and
    motion detection. To facilitate user feedback, we utilize two serially connected
    microcontrollers through a digital platform named ThingerIO. 4.3.2. Results comparison
    Besides the features comparison, it is worth noting that the number of monitored
    farm''s vital parameters consists of significant results to take care of to highlight
    the relevance and significance of the engineering findings, which emphasize the
    contribution of the proposed method in the current research landscape. Table 7
    offers a nuanced evaluation of the proposed method alongside existing state-of-the-art
    approaches. Beyond the conventional features comparison, the introduction underscores
    the significance of the number of monitored vital parameters as a pivotal metric
    for highlighting the engineering findings'' relevance and importance in the current
    research landscape. Based on the table data, it is evident that the proposed method
    stands out prominently. It excels in monitoring a comprehensive set of 5 vital
    parameters, surpassing the more limited scopes of the approaches outlined by Rahman
    et al. and Thong-un & Wongsaroj [45]. This expanded range implies a heightened
    capacity to capture diverse facets of the mushroom cultivation environment, enhancing
    the depth and richness of the data collected. Table 7. Comparison of the results.
    Method Number of managed vital parameters Number of actuating tools Ability to
    monitor in real-time basis [38] 2 3 Yes [12] 3 0 No [45] 2 3 Yes Proposed method
    5 6 Yes Furthermore, the proposed method distinguishes itself by employing a notable
    number of 6 actuating tools. This surpasses the comparatively lower tool count
    in the methods presented by Rahman et al. [38] and Thong-un and Wongsaroj [45].
    The greater number of actuating tools signifies a more sophisticated and versatile
    control mechanism, suggesting a higher degree of precision and adaptability in
    steering the farming of the mushroom environment. Crucially, the proposed method
    shares with Thong-un & Wongsaroj [45] the ability to monitor in real-time. This
    capability is recognized as essential for dynamic and responsive control, ensuring
    timely adjustments to changing conditions. In contrast, Rahman et al. [38] and
    Chandrappa et al. [12] lack this critical feature, potentially limiting their
    effectiveness in adapting to the rapidly evolving dynamics of the mushroom cultivation
    setting. The results prove that the proposed method emerges as a pioneering contribution
    to the current research landscape. Its prowess in monitoring an extensive array
    of vital parameters, utilizing a higher number of actuating tools, and facilitating
    real-time monitoring underscores its potential to revolutionize the field. 5.
    Conclusion Mushroom cultivation technology is a structured framework for overseeing
    and homogenizing the mushroom farm''s substrate environmental parameters. This
    study concentrates on the cultivation of mushrooms sharing a range of environmental
    parameters, where growth dynamics are contingent upon various physical factors,
    such as temperature, light, and humidity. Numerous research endeavors have explored
    intelligent systems in mushroom cultivation, particularly focusing on automating
    temperature and air humidity control through watering systems. Despite these efforts,
    there remains an oversight of other crucial factors in mushroom plant cultivation.
    For instance, managing light exposure, addressing insect disruptions, and utilizing
    natural or artificial lights are critical environmental considerations that significantly
    impact the quality of edible mushrooms before and after harvest. These factors
    are vital in influencing mycelium characteristics, such as growth rate, density,
    color, and the physical appearance of fruiting bodies, including stalk, cap, and
    color formation. It is crucial to emphasize light''s pivotal role in the cultivation
    of edible mushrooms. Additionally, research has identified the presence of insects,
    mites, crustaceans, and other arthropods feeding on mushrooms and decomposers
    on synthetic or wooden substrates as detrimental factors affecting the optimal
    growth of mushrooms. Consequently, there is a compelling need to advance agricultural
    technologies by considering all critical factors, enhancing both the quality and
    quantity of mushroom production. This study aims to address challenges in current
    mushroom production by developing an IoT-based system. The system integrates various
    modules to intelligently control crucial parameters, including temperature, humidity,
    substrate moisture, and light intensity. Moreover, the system incorporates a mechanism
    for pest control by automatically spraying pesticides when an external agent is
    detected in the mushroom farm. Fuzzy Logic (FL) is integrated into the IoT module,
    allowing the recorded sensor data to enable system functionality based on comparisons
    with pre-recorded standard data, defining optimal ranges for each vital parameter.
    The system activates actuators when sensor data falls outside the desired range,
    effectively maintaining the environmental parameters within optimal conditions
    for mushroom cultivation. Importantly, this method introduces self-decision-making
    through FL, a mathematical modeling technique emulating human decision-making.
    The contributions of this work include intelligent and adaptive monitoring of
    sensor data for creating an optimal environment for mushroom cultivation, as well
    as the optimization of agricultural resources, such as water and pesticides, through
    the introduction of previously unused sensors. Diversifying this method allows
    for a nuanced understanding of environmental factors applicable to various types
    of mushrooms within the field of mushroom cultivation. CRediT authorship contribution

    agriculture. This approach significantly contributes to environmental conservation
    and food security. Furthermore, it establishes that DLTs like IOTA are not only

    data recording; environmental footprint 1. Introduction The agrifood sector, a
    cornerstone of the global economy, sustains billions by providing food and livelihoods.
    Yet, it grapples with multifaceted challenges, from climate change and environmental
    degradation to population growth, food security, and consumer trust. Addressing
    these requires sustainable, efficient agricultural practices that optimize resource
    use, curtail waste, and elevate productivity and quality. The Internet of Things
    (IoT) is emerging at the forefront of solutions. This network of interconnected
    devices, equipped with sensors, actuators, and communication protocols, offers
    real-time monitoring and control over parameters like crop growth, soil health,
    water consumption, pest management, and greenhouse gas emissions. Beyond monitoring,
    IoT enhances traceability and transparency throughout the food supply chain, bolstering
    food safety and consumer trust. However, the integration of IoT in agriculture
    is not without challenges, especially concerning data management: Data Security:
    Ensuring data integrity and safeguarding against malicious tampering is paramount.
    Data Privacy: Stakeholders’ rights and preferences necessitate stringent measures
    against unauthorized data access or disclosure. Data Scalability: As farms grow
    and technology adoption surges, systems must accommodate an increasing influx
    of data from sensors and devices. Data Interoperability: Seamless data exchange
    is crucial, especially when devices and systems employ diverse formats and standards.
    Data Cost: Efficient data transmission and storage are vital, particularly for
    frequent or low-value transactions. Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) and
    the IoT can address these challenges by offering a decentralized, immutable, and
    transparent platform for data management. However, while the blockchain, i.e.,
    the most widely used form of DLT, has revolutionized data storage through cryptographically
    linked blocks, it is necessary to address scalability, transaction fees, energy
    consumption, and more limitations in the data-intensive IoT universe. IOTA offers
    a fresh perspective on DLT with its Tangle, a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure.
    Unlike blockchains, the Tangle permits feeless transactions, validated by nodes
    as they initiate new transactions [1,2]. This structure provides enhanced scalability,
    reduced energy consumption, quantum resistance, and the capability for offline
    transactions and microtransactions. Rather than replacing traditional blockchain
    systems, IOTA complements them, especially for the high-frequency data transactions
    inherent to the IoT. With projections indicating that, by 2030, approximately
    125 billion IoT devices will be interconnected [3], the sheer volume of data generated
    necessitates robust management, distribution, and storage solutions. While DLT
    offers a promising avenue, our study narrows its focus on IOTA’s Tangle, a DLT
    uniquely equipped to handle the vast data streams from IoT devices, given its
    scalable, fast, and feeless micro-data transaction capabilities. With this backdrop,
    our central research inquiry is both theoretical and pragmatic: Is it possible
    to devise a web application that seamlessly integrates Tangle IOTA with IoT-enabled
    sensors? These sensors, designed for monitoring sustainability metrics in agriculture,
    would empower operators in the agrifood sector with real-time insights, enabling
    timely interventions. To explore this, we have embarked on a Proof-of-Concept
    test focusing on data from rice cultivation. Our Proof-of-Concept focuses on rice
    cultivation, chosen due to its significant freshwater usage, which is the highest
    among all crops. Additionally, rice’s global prevalence and status as the world’s
    primary food crop make it a pertinent subject for our study [4]. We developed
    an analytical dashboard to demonstrate that using technologies such as IoT and
    IOTA optimizes product quality, product processing efficiency, cost, and production
    time. In summary, when we fully control production with devices and sensors (IoT),
    receiving data even from remote locations with the support of IOTA, it is possible
    to reduce the release of CO 2 by having control over irrigation and the right
    portion of water (more water equals more CO 2 and more waste). In addition, it
    is possible to track the product 24 h a day, receiving recorded data on IOTA almost
    through streaming. Finally, the process is very green, reducing electricity consumption.
    2. Background and Related Works In this section, we first provide a general background
    on distributed ledger technology (DLT), including both blockchains and tangles
    like IOTA. Then, we discuss related work on (i) traditional monitoring systems
    in agriculture, (ii) the use of the blockchain applied to agriculture, and (iii)
    the use of IOTA Tangle technology applied to agriculture. 2.1. Background DLT
    has become a transformative force in information technology, reshaping organizational
    collaboration and operation [5,6]. It employs a ledger system where multiple nodes
    can read and write data, maintaining a state based on consensus, which varies
    with the network’s decentralization level. DLTs are characterized mainly by their
    ledger structure: chain-based systems like blockchain and DAG-based systems like
    IOTA’s Tangle. Chain-based DLTs utilize a linear series of blocks, securing records
    through cryptographic hashing and consensus mechanisms like proof of work or stake.
    These blockchains differ in their access protocols and validator addition methods,
    affecting interaction levels with network components. In contrast, DAG-based DLTs
    allow parallel transaction processing, offering potentially higher scalability
    than chain-based systems. With independent transaction confirmation and no need
    for a single global consensus, DAG structures provide a more dynamic and scalable
    consensus approach. This contrasts with chain-based systems, where all transactions
    require network-wide confirmation, leading to potential bottlenecks in transaction
    processing and scalability. 2.2. Related Work 2.2.1. Traditional Monitoring Systems
    in Agriculture Historically, agricultural monitoring has evolved through various
    traditional systems. Key studies in this field have explored different approaches:
    Wang et al. developed a low-cost, real-time remote environmental monitoring system
    combining wireless equipment and mobile phones that was powered by solar energy.
    This system was effective in collecting real-time information and fulfilling online
    acquisition needs [7]. Dan et al. implemented a Greenhouse Environment Monitoring
    System using ZigBee technology, wireless sensors, and control nodes. This system
    focused on controlling environmental data for enhanced greenhouse management [8].
    Hashim et al. reviewed using an Arduino device for temperature and soil moisture
    control, managed via an Android smartphone. This study contributed to designing
    smart monitoring systems using an embedded micro-web server and IP connectivity,
    aiming to aid the agriculture sector in achieving quality production [9]. Karim
    et al. developed an application for precision farming based on a wireless sensor
    network and IoT cloud. This application focused on optimizing irrigation and monitoring
    microclimatic conditions to improve water usage efficiency in farming [10]. 2.2.2.
    Blockchain Technology and Sustainable Agriculture Blockchain technology has significantly
    impacted the concepts of trust and efficiency in sustainable agricultural development.
    This change became prominent as agrifood companies accessed knowledge banks and
    digital resources [11]. Blockchain, alongside the Internet of Things (IoT), is
    pivotal in advancing sustainable and precision agriculture, which leverages technology
    to enhance agricultural efficiency [12]. Lin et al. proposed an ICT e-agriculture
    system model based on the blockchain for local and regional use. They also developed
    a validation tool for the technical and social requirements of these systems [11].
    Patil et al. focused on using IoT for remote monitoring and automation in agriculture.
    They provided an architecture integrating blockchain technology for smart greenhouse
    farms, offering a security framework that combines blockchain with IoT devices
    for enhanced security and communication in smart farming [13]. Munir et al. implemented
    an intelligent Smart Watering System (SWS) based on an Android application for
    smart water consumption in crops. The system, equipped with affordable sensors,
    uses blockchain and Fuzzy Logic approaches for data security and intelligent decision-making,
    enabling real-time monitoring and periodic irrigation [14]. Baralla et al. developed
    a blockchain-oriented platform to authenticate food origin data. This platform
    aims to enhance supply chain transparency, promote local smart food tourism, and
    boost local economies, emphasizing the importance of food as a “business card”
    for tourist sites [15]. Iqbal and Butt proposed an IoT-based system for crop protection
    at all stages, focusing on deterring animal attacks using sensors and a Repelling
    and Notifying System (RNS). The system records incidents in a centralized Farm
    Management System (FMS), integrated with an agricultural blockchain for shared
    ledger functionalities, enhancing meta-information sharing [12]. Cocco et al.
    implemented a system offering visibility to food processes and certifications,
    using Self Sovereign Identity, blockchain, and the InterPlanetary File System.
    This system aims to safeguard data storage and access, ensuring the eligibility,
    transparency, and traceability of certifications [16]. 2.2.3. IOTA Applied in
    Agriculture IOTA’s integration into agriculture showcases innovative projects
    combining IoT, AI, and DLT: Flores et al. developed the Interplanetary Precision
    Agriculture (IPA) project, which harnesses IoT, AI, and DLT. The project utilizes
    various technologies, including an autonomous rover (Magrito) for crop performance
    data, Precision Habitat PRO for environmental control, a bluetooth scale for weight
    data, and a farm management system for data aggregation. The collected data are
    sent to the IOTA Tangle network to ensure immutability and interoperability. This
    aims to enhance cultivation processes both on Earth and in extraterrestrial environments,
    addressing issues of centralization and data silos in supply chains. The overarching
    goal is to establish a sustainable food supply and minimize the environmental
    footprint of agricultural practices [17]. Lamtzidis et al. introduced a distributed
    ledger-based system focused on securing IoT data integrity. They utilized IOTA’s
    Tangle ledger for the secure processing and storage of aggregated field data,
    transitioning from a cloud-centric to a node-centric architecture. In this setup,
    each Super node maintains its data in a distributed and decentralized database,
    with the backend functioning as both a data consumer and resource provider. This
    modular approach has made significant contributions to open-source communities
    in blockchain and IoT, presenting a more secure and decentralized method for managing
    IoT data [18]. 3. Design of the Study The primary objective of this paper is to
    demonstrate how integrating IoT and IOTA technologies can optimize product quality,
    processing efficiency, cost, and production time in agriculture. By utilizing
    IoT devices and sensors, and leveraging IOTA for data management, we aim to achieve
    significant reductions in CO 2 emissions through precise irrigation control and
    water management. This approach also allows for continuous product tracking and
    reduces electricity consumption, contributing to a more sustainable agricultural
    process. Our methodology involves creating a prototype that simulates a rice production
    process. This setup includes seedlings equipped with sensors to monitor and regulate
    water levels within a specified range. This prototype demonstrates efficient data
    transmission, production control, and system functionality. The study heavily
    focuses on the impact of IoT in agriculture. IoT technology, encompassing remote
    sensors, cloud and edge computing, unmanned vehicles, and data analytics [19],
    is revolutionizing agricultural practices. It allows for effective monitoring
    of crucial factors like humidity, air temperature, and soil quality, thus enhancing
    crop yields, irrigation efficiency, and accurate harvest forecasting (https://www.appsforagri.com/en/news/impact-of-iot-in-the-agriculture/,
    accessed on 7 October 2023). Moreover, the IoT’s integration into agriculture
    significantly reduces environmental impacts by lowering water and energy usage,
    greenhouse gas emissions, and fertilizer runoff. Financially, it increases farmers’
    profitability and competitiveness by opening up new markets and services [20].
    This study extends the IoT’s capabilities in agriculture by incorporating IOTA’s
    DLT, which is particularly suited for high-frequency IoT scenarios. IOTA offers
    benefits such as feeless transactions, data integrity, scalability, and interoperability,
    making it ideal for a secure and transparent network of IoT devices in the agricultural
    sector. Our methodology places a strong emphasis on optimizing resource utilization,
    with a particular focus on water efficiency. By integrating IOTA’s advanced DLT
    capabilities with intelligent irrigation systems, we aim to significantly enhance
    the precision and effectiveness of water usage in agriculture. Drawing insights
    from Mboyerwa et al.’s [21] research, this integration is expected to drastically
    reduce resource consumption. Notably, it can lead to halving water usage, decreasing
    nitrogen consumption by 25%, and reducing methane emissions by 50% to 70%. These
    substantial reductions are primarily achieved through the optimized control of
    field flooding durations, which effectively slows down the activity of methane-producing
    microorganisms. The integration of IOTA plays a critical role in this process.
    Its technology enables a secure, transparent, and highly efficient network of
    IoT devices. This network facilitates the real-time collection, processing, and
    analysis of vast amounts of agricultural data. Consequently, it allows for more
    precise irrigation decisions, ensuring water is used more effectively and sustainably.
    The real-time data processing and feeless transactions offered by IOTA enhance
    the system’s responsiveness and accuracy, leading to a more intelligent and environmentally
    friendly approach to irrigation. This not only optimizes resource usage but also
    contributes to the broader goals of sustainable and precision agriculture. The
    study employs a multi-faceted technological approach, simulating a data-intensive
    paddy farm environment. By integrating IOTA, we enhance data management, introduce
    robust authorization systems, and streamline data transmission. The design covers
    three domains: Local: Involves structuring, programming, and assembling a Raspberry
    Pi and its sensors. Remote: Facilitates internet connectivity and links to an
    online platform. Cloud-based server: Serves as the primary project hub. Technologically,
    the study utilizes Raspberry Pi devices and sensors, EMQX (MQTT), VPN and Ubuntu,
    Docker, IOTA, and MongoDB (ATLAS). The programming spans across Python, NodeJs,
    Javascript, HTML, and CSS. 3.1. IOTA IOTA stands out as a pioneering DLT tailored
    for the IoT landscape. Distinct from conventional blockchain systems, IOTA employs
    the Tangle, a unique architecture that addresses the scalability and transaction
    cost challenges inherent to blockchains. It positions IOTA as an optimal choice
    for the real-time processing of vast data streams from IoT sensors in sustainable
    agriculture. The IOTA network is underpinned by nodes’ individual instances of
    the IOTA software. These nodes validate and record transactions, and in the context
    of sustainable agriculture, they could process data received from IoT sensors,
    monitoring parameters like soil moisture, temperature, and pH levels. To ensure
    efficient operation, nodes had to use a robust but affordable environment with
    at least a 4-core processor, 8GB RAM, SSD storage, and a public IP address. Each
    node offers different features across multiple ports, facilitating peer-to-peer
    communication with HTTP and MQTT protocol, allowing for resilient data communication
    in every agricultural scenario. IOTA nodes can manifest as Mainnet, Testnet, or
    Devnet nodes. While Mainnet nodes handle real-world IOTA transactions, including
    actual sensor data, Testnet and Devnet nodes serve developmental and testing purposes,
    enabling developers to refine applications before Mainnet deployment. There are
    two primary IOTA node software options: Hornet and Bee. Hornet, crafted in Go,
    is resource-efficient, aligning with IoT applications where resources might be
    limited. Conversely, Bee, developed in Rust, emphasizes modularity and performance.
    Given its resource efficiency, Hornet is preferred for most agricultural IoT scenarios.
    Hornet’s implementation can leverage various avenues, including APT Repository,
    Docker image, binary files, or source construction. The Docker image, renowned
    for its portability, is particularly favored. The ability of Docker to effortlessly
    deploy and scale applications aligns with agricultural contexts, where the number
    of IoT sensors can fluctuate based on farm dimensions and requirements. Node security
    is paramount, necessitating measures like safeguarding login accounts, sealing
    unused ports, disabling remote consensus algorithm execution, and deploying a
    reverse proxy for augmented security. The Docker image gohornet/hornet (https://hub.docker.com/r/iotaledger/hornet,
    accessed on 7 October 2023) is utilized for Hornet implementation, with the repository
    cloned locally. Configuration files (i.e., config.json and peering.json) facilitate
    settings customization and node synchronization storage. The database of IOTA
    mandates a mainnetdb folder creation, with the use of authentication hashes ensuring
    data access exclusivity. The Docker image also initiates a server, loading a dashboard
    for node and data monitoring essential for overseeing and troubleshooting the
    IoT sensor network in agriculture. 3.2. Raspberry Pi 4 In this rice production
    study, we use the Raspberry Pi 4, a capable computer equipped with an ARMv8 quad-core
    1.5 GHz 64-bit CPU, dual-band wireless LAN, Bluetooth 5.0, and 1-2-4 GB RAM. It
    offers a GPIO port with 40 pins, 26 being GPIO pins, and various ports like USB,
    micro-HDMI, Ethernet, and more, including support for 4K video. The GPIO socket
    includes 40 pins, bridging the Raspberry Pi and external devices, where 26 of
    these are GPIO pins; the rest are power or ground pins. They are labeled in both
    physical and BCM numbering for convenience. Raspbian, a version of Linux designed
    for Raspberry Pi, serves as the operating system. It is installed via NOOBS, with
    a browser, email program, LibreOffice, Minecraft, and a command-line tool (raspi-config)
    for configuration management. Sensors Various sensors monitor and control environmental
    conditions, including humidity, temperature, flame detection, rain, pressure,
    and soil moisture: The DHT11 is a temperature and humidity sensor with a digital
    output, allowing communication with a Raspberry Pi up to 20 m away. It provides
    stable measurements with a maximum temperature accuracy variation of 2 °C and
    humidity accuracy variation of 1 percent. The flame detection sensor can detect
    infrared emissions from a flame and convert them into an electrical signal readable
    by any microcontroller. It has a reading angle 60° and features both an analog
    and a digital output. The rain sensor detects the presence and concentration of
    water. An LED indicates its operation and features with an analog output to calculate
    the amount of water present. The pressure sensor measures atmospheric pressure,
    temperature, and altitude. It can measure an atmospheric pressure level ranging
    from 300 to 1100 hPa and a temperature range from −40 °C to +85 °C. The soil moisture
    sensor detects soil moisture and the presence or absence of water. It has a digital
    output that indicates the level of humidity. This study uses two such sensors
    to monitor the optimal water levels for rice field irrigation. The first sensor
    measures the minimum water level needed for healthy rice growth, while the second
    sensor identifies the maximum water level to prevent wastage and crop damage.
    3.3. Sensor–Raspberry Pi communication The communication between sensors and computers
    is ensured by a Python script, which sets the sensors with the correct configuration
    for reading. It cyclically checks each sensor, recalling its state or value and
    storing the results in temporary variables. These variables are part of a JSON-like
    object that requires further conversion to become a standard JSON object. The
    script establishes a remote connection on the EMQX API, an MQTT web tool, and
    proceeds with publishing through the publish function. Since Python lacks the
    module allowing Raspberry Pi to communicate with the web tool, it must be installed
    and imported. To avoid saturating the Raspberry Pi’s resources, time intervals
    are established between the data acquisition of one sensor and the next. A pause
    of 2 s has been set before another sensor is analyzed to minimize data and information
    loss. The dialogue between the two technologies is summarized in Figure 1. Figure
    1. Sensor–Raspberry Pi communication. 3.4. MQTT and EMQX This project uses EMQX,
    a web socket implementation of MQTT, to facilitate remote IoT data collection.
    EMQX is an open-source MQTT IoT message broker built on the Erlang/OTP platform,
    renowned for its soft real-time capabilities, low latency, and distributed development
    features. MQTT is a lightweight message exchange protocol centered around a publication–subscription
    model. EMQX is accessible via browser and is designed for mass client access,
    providing fast and low-latency message routing between large physical network
    devices. It can host large-scale MQTT client connections, with a single server
    node supporting 2 million connections. It is also extensible, supporting custom
    plug-ins for authentication and other features. It fully supports IoT protocols,
    including MQTT, MQTT-SN, soap, LwM2M, and other proprietary TCP/UDP-based protocols.
    The connection configuration is used to set up links through any API that will
    serve as a bridge to dialogue your code with the MQTT platform. Required fields
    for EMQX connection configuration encompass “Name”, “Client ID”, “Host”, and the
    listening port. EMQX Broker provides many configuration elements and supports
    global and local configurations, allowing multi-protocol and port utilization.
    Auto Reconnect and Clean session functions are used to perform automatic reconnection
    when the broker goes offline and to start a session after a disconnection. The
    project creates various “topics” or subjects by creating a new subscription. The
    Topic must have a title and a subtitle, which are necessary if there is a need
    to filter the data. They are used to categorize the topic according to the path
    to which it belongs. This logic is useful when you want to retrieve information
    to access it; you need to know and refer to the precise path, otherwise, you cannot
    link to the topic. Data simulation within the project is accomplished with data
    input in JSON or TXT format allowing for textual data and key-value schema object
    notation. JSON data were sent via the Raspberry device at 2-s intervals, and it
    is possible to say that no visible latency or message loss was encountered. Figure
    2 displays the most important functionalities of this tool. Through the functionality
    called “New Connection”, it is possible to create a new mandatory initial connection
    or it can be used to create additional parallel connections, leading to Step 2,
    i.e., the connection configuration. This part will also serve as a setting for
    the links through any API that will serve as a bridge to dialogue your code with
    the MQTT platform. Figure 2. EMQX: MQTT Websocket Toolkit. In detail, Table 1
    shows the port numbers devoted to exposing services, dealing with sockets, the
    default WS (web socket) or WSS (web socket secured with SSL). The latter is a
    security protocol based on modern public key cryptographic algorithms, i.e., TLS/SSL.
    It can ensure transmission security in the computer communication network, providing
    the benefits of strong certification, thus ensuring confidentiality and completeness.
    Table 1. Protocol port. 3.5. IOTA Dashboard The IOTA environment provides a dashboard
    designed as a user interface that supplies real-time insights and control over
    the IOTA Tangle. In sustainable rice cultivation, IoT devices can be deployed
    across rice fields to monitor various parameters such as soil moisture, temperature,
    pH level, and more. These devices can transmit data to the IOTA Tangle, which
    can be accessed and analyzed in real-time through the IOTA dashboard. The IOTA
    dashboard enables one to view the IOTA DLT state. In detail, it provides an Analytics
    tab, which makes available parameters about the node, network, and resources,
    including information about the Tangle network, node details, memory usage, and
    cache data. Moreover, users can search for messages sent to the node, for instance,
    measurement from the IoT devices deployed in the rice fields monitoring by using
    the Explorer tab. In addition, the IOTA dashboard comes with a Visualizer tab
    responsible for providing a visual representation of the live evolution of the
    Tangle network, offering a real-time view of data transmission. Network management
    is eased by noting the information displayed in the Peers tab, and finally, plugin
    add-ons are allowed in the Plugins tab. Through the IOTA dashboard, farmers, researchers,
    and decision-makers can gain valuable insights into the conditions of the rice
    fields, enabling them to make informed decisions that promote sustainable cultivation
    practices. This case study will explore how the IOTA dashboard can be used in
    promoting sustainability in rice cultivation. The analytics tab is composed of
    four sub-tabs, namely Tangle, Node, Memory, and Caches. As depicted in Figure
    3, the Tangle subsection supplies several valuable metrics, such as known messages,
    new messages, received messages, messages sent, message requests received, sent
    message requests, heartbeats received, heartbeats sent, milestone request received,
    sent milestone request, and deleted packets. Figure 3. IOTA dashboard: analytics.
    Between these analytics, it is possible to note a heartbeat signal. Heartbeat
    is a periodic signal that hardware or software produces, and it is used both to
    show proper operation and synchronize nodes. It is one of the mission-critical
    systems’ most widely used techniques to provide high availability and fault tolerance
    of network services by detecting network or node system failures. Other sections
    provide information regarding memory usage and cache state. The Node section is
    in charge of providing insights on messages sent per milestone, which define a
    temporal interval defining the time needed to pass until the network coordinator
    executes the message validation. The state and the throughput of the network are
    viewable in the network graph, as depicted in Figure 4, which represents the construction
    of a Tangle or a DAG graph, i.e., the distributed registry in which are stored
    all transitions. In the sidebar of Figure 4, there are the following Tangle properties:
    (i) messages that indicates the number of messages sent; (ii) MPS, i.e., the number
    of messages sent to the network per second; (iii) TIPS, i.e., the number of unapproved
    transactions; (iv) referenced, i.e., the percentage of transactions referenced
    by other transactions; (v) conflicting, i.e., the percentage of transactions with
    conflicts; and (vi) solid, i.e., transactions with their history. Figure 4. Tangle
    graph. In Figure 5, it is possible to see one of the requirements for interacting
    with the IOTA network. The choices depend on the technologies one chooses to use,
    but also on whether one wants to use one’s own node (direct access) or rely on
    third-party nodes. Figure 5. Dependencies and requirements of IOTA. Constructing
    a personal node for network access is the optimal choice. The entire infrastructure
    can be raised using an editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code) or any other editor or
    IDE. Once Docker is configured and operational, the installation of either Hornet
    or Bee is enabled allowing for crafting nodes. Upon completion, the node may be
    launched via Docker. After configuring the network settings, the dashboard is
    accessible, enabling the owned node viewing as well as interaction with other
    nodes and also providing insights regarding the IOTA network. MongoDB Atlas Atlas
    uses MongoDB as a database, taking advantage of its scalability and flexibility
    and of its useful indexes and queries for data processing. Data originating from
    the Raspberry Pi are sent through EMQX and are written into the Atlas database.
    To establish a database on MongoDB Atlas for agricultural monitoring, follow these
    steps: register on the Atlas website, choose a cluster, create the database, and
    configure the connection string. MongoDB stores data records as BSON documents
    in collections, similar to tables in relational databases. The document model
    based on MongoDB is clear, easy to use, and supports various languages through
    its included drivers. The Atlas interface provides an overview of the data flow
    and allows the transformation of agricultural data into charts, as shown in Figure
    6, which displays two charts, one tracking the temperature and humidity data over
    time based on the hour, the other counting the amount of data each sensor has
    sent compared to the other sensors. Figure 6. Atlas data charts. By selecting
    the desired database, it is possible to choose the chart and then select the data
    of interest to be represented in the graph, setting a title and some properties.
    This chart is saved in the dashboard, and every time new data are received, they
    are written into the database, automatically updating the various charts based
    on the corresponding fields. There are approximately nine chart options, with
    an average of two subcategories for each. In Figure 7, it is possible to see the
    number of times a certain temperature is detected. For example, 23 degrees has
    been detected 25 times, while 24 degrees has been detected only 5 times. The chart
    on the right displays the total count of temperature data. In this case, both
    the humidity and barometer sensors detect the temperature. By adding the two values
    shown in the second chart in Figure 3, which are 26 and 27, a percentage of 53%
    is obtained. Figure 7. Temperature. These visualizations can be made visible to
    specific users, such as farmers or sustainability experts, or even made public
    through an off-site link. This feature enhances the accessibility of critical
    sustainability information, even outside of Atlas, promoting transparency and
    informed decision-making in agricultural practice. Hence, integrating MongoDB
    and Atlas in an IOTA-based deployment offers a robust solution for monitoring
    and analyzing sustainability parameters in agriculture. The flexibility in storage
    options, ease of setup, and data visualization capabilities make it a valuable
    tool in modern agricultural practices. Figure 8 depicts the architecture of the
    proposed model and the logical flows running through the system components. Briefly,
    data gathered by the IoT Sensors flow through EMQX to the Raspberry Pi, which
    acts as a gateway to send data to the HTTP Application Server. The node Application
    Server manages such data communicating with the IOTA network passing through the
    deployed node, as well as with the Atlas interfaces, thus enabling data monitoring
    via the analytical dashboard. Figure 8. Architecture of the system. 4. Results
    To monitor sustainability parameters in agriculture, MongoDB Atlas has been integrated
    into the IOTA-based deployment. The setup process has involved registering on
    the Atlas website, selecting a cluster, creating the database, and configuring
    the connection string. The Atlas interface allows the transformation of data into
    charts, which are automatically updated with new data. To this aim, data from
    devices like Raspberry Pis are sent through EMQX to a Node.Js script by leveraging
    APIs, and received data are stored in the MongoDB Cloud of Atlas. Moreover, we
    implemented a connection established with the local IOTA node (Hornet Mainnet)
    to propagate the data in the IOTA Tangle. The created Node.js server takes care
    of receiving, processing, and translating the data into services for the graphical
    interface. A lightweight Node.js server is created to receive, process, and translate
    the data into services for the graphical interface. The server listens on a customizable
    port, providing services to those who connect to that port. Aiming to achieve
    real-time insights, we developed an analytical dashboard, which is responsible
    for making viewable the received data. These are divided into several sections,
    each describing a different analysis aspect, as depicted in Figure 9. The sections
    include notifications, derived data, graphs, a table, alerts, and a map. The data
    in the table include count, id, date, time, message, temperature, humidity, pressure,
    altitude, latitude, longitude, status, and sensor name. Two soil sensors have
    been installed, one for notifying when the soil’s water level is insufficient
    and the other for alerting when there is excess water. Figure 9. Analytical dashboard.
    Hereafter, we illustrate the various sections of the analytical dashboard displayed
    in Figure 9. Section 1 showcases a menu that remains visible while scrolling the
    page. It counts both incoming data and highlights any data that requires attention.
    These particular data points are also tallied in the alerts. Section 2 illustrates
    data derived from analytical operations performed on raw sensor data. Starting
    from the left, we have the average humidity, obtained by summing up the humidity
    data points and dividing them by the number of humidity data points. Next, the
    minimum and maximum humidity values are reported by comparing the previously stored
    data with the subsequent data. Depending on the result, the old data may be overwritten.
    As in the case of humidity, it is possible that there are no fluctuations in either
    an upward or downward trend, resulting in the “Min” and “Max” values being equal.
    “Average Temperature”, “Min”, and “Max” values are calculated in the same manner.
    In Section 3, the “HUMIDITY” box displays the humidity data received from the
    temperature sensor. Specifically, the x-axis represents the time the data are
    received, and the y-axis represents the temperature data, which remain constant
    at 65% in this case. Regarding the “TEMPERATURE” box, the same procedure described
    in the previous case is followed, with the difference being that the temperature
    data are considered. As observed, the temperature data vary between 22 and 21
    degrees within the selected time interval. The “traces” are the lines used to
    construct the graph; in the “TEMPERATURE” box, there are eight traces. Both boxes
    feature a scroll bar that appears when the graph requires more space to display
    the newly received data while allowing the visualization of previous data by scrolling
    through the bar. Section 4 shows a dynamically populated table with JSON data
    sent by Raspberry sensors. There is a data model for the data types that each
    sensor sends, and the table can be fully viewed by scrolling horizontally. The
    same applies to the quantity of data, which requires scrolling vertically to view
    it. In detail, the data in the table include: Count indicates the number of times
    a specific sensor sends data; Id uniquely identifies each sensor; Date indicates
    the date the data was sent by Raspberry; Time indicates the time corresponding
    to the data sent by Raspberry; Message indicates additional information regarding
    the data; Temperature indicates the detected temperature; Humidity indicates the
    recorded humidity; Pressure indicates the identified pressure; Altitude indicates
    the measured altitude; Latitude and Longitude indicate the geographic coordinates
    of the sensor’s location; Status takes a value of 0 or 1 depending on the sensor;
    Sensor Name indicates the sensor’s name, which is useful for identifying the specific
    sensor being considered. The value “undefined” indicates that the specific sensor
    being considered does not produce that type of data detected by another specific
    sensor for that purpose. In Section 5 of Figure 9, the sensors with values requiring
    greater attention are displayed on the left, as seen in the table. Each alert
    notification is accompanied by the date, time, critical message, and an icon indicating
    its significance. At the top, the total number of alert messages received is shown.
    On the right, a real map is displayed, showing simulated geo-localization coordinates
    of the sensors. These data can either be pre-set or dynamically passed and plotted.
    Similarly, Figure 10 demonstrates the functioning of the two soil sensors, one
    alerting when the soil’s water level is insufficient, the other signaling when
    there is excess water. Figure 10. Functioning of the soil sensors. According to
    the works of Mboyerwa et al. [21] and Prem Kumar et al. [19], IoT and IOTA have
    emerged as disrupting technologies in the agrifood supply chain and sustainability
    optimization; we deem that our Proof-of-Concept will be a further advancement
    in monitoring and improving the sustainability of agrifood production processes.
    Moreover, IoT devices relying on centralized communications present a number of
    security threats related to privacy and security. IOTA addresses these flaws,
    also removing the blockchains’s limitations; indeed, IoT devices lack the computational
    power and storage needed to run consensus algorithms to be an involved part of
    the blockchain [22]. Taken together, our results answered the question that guided
    our research by creating a web application capable of integrating IOTA with IoT
    sensors devoted to real-time monitoring of agrifood supply chains. 5. Discussion
    In this section, we discuss the obtained results. 5.1. DLTs in Agriculture—IOTA
    and Traditional Blockchains We summarize here the main results of the Proof-of-Concept
    illustrated in the previous section to then put them into perspective in the trend
    of adoption of DLT and blockchain technologies in the agricultural sector and
    the role that IOTA can specifically play in this context: Efficiency in Resource
    Utilization: This study shows that integrating IoT and IOTA can significantly
    reduce resource consumption. Thus, this integration effectively implements the
    sustainable agricultural practices illustrated in [21]. Technological Infrastructure:
    This study employs various technologies, including Raspberry Pi 4, various sensors,
    and IOTA, a distributed ledger technology tailored for IoT. These technologies
    monitor various environmental conditions like soil moisture, temperature, and
    pH. Data Management and Security: This study uses IOTA to bolster data management
    and introduce a robust authorization system. It also employs MQTT and EMQX for
    remote IoT data collection, supporting up to 2 million connections on a single
    server node. Environmental Impact: IoT has the potential to mitigate the environmental
    footprint of agriculture by reducing water and energy consumption, greenhouse
    gas emissions, and fertilizer runoff. Financial Benefits: IoT can elevate the
    profitability and competitiveness of farmers by granting access to new markets,
    services, and performance-based incentives. Real-Time Monitoring: The IOTA dashboard
    provides real-time insights into various parameters like soil moisture, temperature,
    and pH levels, enabling informed decision-making for sustainable agriculture.
    Technological Toolkit: This study uses a diverse set of technologies, including
    Raspberry and its sensors, EMQX (MQTT), VPN and Ubuntu, Docker, IOTA, and MongoDB,
    and is programmed in Python, NodeJs, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Sustainability:
    This study concludes that the IoT stands as a pivotal force in enhancing agricultural
    productivity and sustainability, especially as the demand for food rises amidst
    limited resources. Transitioning from these findings, we delve into the broader
    implications and applications of DLTs in agriculture. Agriculture is a critical
    sector facing numerous challenges, including climate change, environmental degradation,
    and the need for sustainable practices. These challenges necessitate innovative
    solutions, and one such promising technology is the IoT. However, the vast amounts
    of data generated by IoT devices must be managed securely and efficiently. Moreover,
    agrifood businesses are increasingly pressured by governmental and consumer organizations
    to validate the safety and quality of their production processes. To meet these
    demands, DLTs offer a robust solution. They provide a decentralized system for
    storing and updating data across a network of nodes, eliminating the need for
    a central authority. DLTs employ cryptography and consensus mechanisms to ensure
    data integrity and validity. While DLTs offer numerous benefits like traceability,
    transparency, and operational efficiency, it is important to note that they are
    not a one-size-fits-all solution. Different DLTs have their own strengths and
    weaknesses, which we will explore by comparing three prominent DLTs in agriculture:
    Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, and IOTA. Of course, this is not a random choice;
    all three platforms stand out for their agricultural achievements and potential
    compared to other DLTs and blockchains. We will focus on two main use cases: traceability
    in the agrifood supply chain and real-time monitoring of cultivation practices.
    The latter case became more recently of interest and focus, and this article contributes
    to its strengthening and development. At the same time, the former has an older
    record, being one of the first use cases of non-financial blockchain/DLT applications.
    To compare these three DLTs strictly from a technological standpoint, see the
    study of Garriga et al. [6] instead, and the study of Dalla Palma et al. [23].
    5.1.1. Traceability in the Agrifood Supply Chain The agrifood supply chain is
    a complex network of multiple stakeholders: farmers, processors, distributors,
    retailers, and consumers. Each stakeholder has its record-keeping system, which
    may not be compatible or transparent to others. This creates challenges in ensuring
    food products’ origin, quality, and safety and meeting local and international
    regulations. DLTs can help overcome these challenges by providing a shared and
    immutable ledger of transactions and data throughout the production process. Ethereum
    and Hyperledger Fabric, the most popular blockchain platform from the Hyperledger
    software ecosystem, are traditional blockchains supporting traceability in the
    agrifood supply chain. Ethereum is a public blockchain that allows anyone to join
    and participate in the network. It supports smart contracts, i.e., self-executing
    agreements written in code that can automate supply chain processes and ensure
    traceability. Fabric is a private blockchain that allows only authorized participants
    to join and transact on the network. It supports private transactions and complex
    supply chain permissions that can handle sensitive data and comply with regulations.
    Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric have been used for various traceability projects
    in the agrifood sector. For instance, IBM Food Trust (https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/solutions/food-trust,
    accessed on 7 October 2023) is a platform built on Fabric that connects farmers,
    processors, distributors, and retailers to share data and track food products
    from farm to fork. Similarly, OriginTrail (https://origintrail.io/, accessed on
    7 October 2023) is a protocol built on Ethereum that enables interoperable data
    exchange and verification across different supply chain actors. The articles by
    Cocco et al. [24] and Marchesi et al. [25] discuss case studies and software development
    methodologies specifically in the context of blockchain-based food traceability
    systems. 5.1.2. Blockchains vs. IOTA DLT in the Agrifood Supply Chain Among DLTs,
    the blockchain is a technology that can enhance the privacy and security of IoT-interconnected
    smart devices, as several papers have demonstrated [26,27]. The blockchain offers
    features such as transparency, immutability, resilience, and cryptography that
    can address some of the challenges of IoT network architecture. However, the blockchain
    also has a cost in terms of transaction fees and architectural complexity, requiring
    expertise from various disciplines. Therefore, the blockchain should manage valuable
    assets, such as business data and financial assets [28]. On the other hand, the
    IOTA Tangle is a DLT that can improve sustainability and agrifood monitoring without
    such costs, allowing agrifood supply chains to adopt it without affecting their
    business [29]. 5.1.3. Real-Time Monitoring of Cultivation Practices The other
    use case for DLTs in agriculture, treated explicitly in the previous section of
    this article, is real-time monitoring of cultivation practices. This involves
    using IoT sensors to collect various data from the field, such as soil moisture,
    temperature, humidity, pest infestation, and so on. These data can help farmers
    optimize their inputs, reduce their environmental impact, and improve their yields.
    However, IoT sensors generate huge amounts of data that must be transmitted and
    stored securely and efficiently. As we have seen, IOTA is a DLT that is designed
    for high-frequency IoT scenarios. Unlike traditional blockchains that use a linear
    chain of blocks to store data, IOTA uses a DAG called Tangle. The Tangle is composed
    of individual transactions that are interlinked to each other and stored across
    a network of nodes. To issue a transaction on the Tangle, a node has to validate
    two previous transactions. This allows IOTA to overcome the cost and scalability
    limitations of blockchains. As highlighted in the description of our study, IOTA
    has several advantages for real-time monitoring of cultivation practices. First,
    it enables zero-fee transactions, meaning nodes can send and receive data without
    paying fees. This is ideal for frequent, low-value data transmissions from IoT
    sensors. Second, it enables high scalability, meaning the network can handle many
    transactions per second without compromising performance or security. This is
    ideal for accommodating varying numbers of sensors and devices on the network.
    Third, it enables data integrity, which means that the data stored on the Tangle
    are tamper-proof and verifiable by anyone on the network. This is ideal for accurate
    decision-making based on real-time data. Our study offers a comprehensive guide
    for building an IOTA-based real-time monitoring system tailored for sustainable
    agriculture. In this context, it complements Future Farm (https://future-farm.iota.org/#/,
    accessed on 7 October 2023), an initiative by the IOTA Foundation that also leverages
    IOTA for data collection and analysis through IoT sensors in greenhouses. While
    Future Farm focuses on process optimization—emphasizing the sharing of IoT data
    among various stakeholders in agriculture—our approach is more user-centric. Specifically,
    we demonstrate how a farm operator can effectively utilize the IOTA Tangle for
    real-time monitoring. 5.1.4. Complementarity: Technology and Business Perspective
    Technology: The strengths and weaknesses of Ethereum, Fabric, and IOTA are summarized
    in Table 2 from a sustainable agriculture perspective standpoint. While Ethereum
    and Fabric cater to supply chain transparency and notarization of product origin
    and quality, IOTA is tailored for high-frequency IoT data transactions. However,
    these DLTs are not mutually exclusive. They can be integrated and interoperable,
    offering a comprehensive view of the agrifood sector. For example, IOTA’s real-time
    data can be linked to Ethereum or Hyperledger Fabric’s smart contracts, triggering
    actions or payments based on predefined conditions. Alternatively, IOTA’s data
    streams can be hashed and anchored to Ethereum or Hyperledger Fabric’s blockchains,
    creating a secure and verifiable record of the data history. These integrations
    can leverage the best features of each DLT, creating a synergistic effect. Table
    2. Comparison of DLTs in agriculture: Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, and IOTA.
    Business: DLTs offer different value propositions for the agrifood sector depending
    on their use cases and applications. While traceability emphasizes transparency,
    notarization, and compliance, real-time monitoring targets operational efficiency
    and sustainability. These value propositions can have various implications for
    market differentiation and consumer engagement. For instance, traceability can
    bolster branding and product authenticity, creating a competitive edge in the
    market. Traceability can also assure consumers about product origin and quality,
    increasing their trust and loyalty. On the other hand, real-time monitoring can
    lead to sustainable practices and cost savings, improving the business’s bottom
    line. Real-time monitoring can also offer insights into sustainable cultivation
    practices, educating consumers and raising awareness. Enriched Business Value:
    Integrating DLTs in the agrifood sector can also create new opportunities for
    funding acquisition and carbon credit trading. These opportunities can provide
    financial incentives for adopting DLTs and promoting sustainable agriculture.
    For example, traceability and real-time monitoring can serve as evidence for quality
    manufacturing and sustainable cultivation practices. This can be pivotal for acquiring
    funding from government agencies or private investors that incentivize such practices.
    Moreover, integrating DLTs can facilitate the generation of carbon credits by
    validating sustainable practices. These credits can be traded as securities on
    DLT-based platforms, offering a new revenue stream for farmers and businesses.
    On the other hand, Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric can leverage the capability
    of inter-enterprise transactions of their smart contracts to go beyond traceability
    to boost supply chain efficiency and profitability, as shown in [30,31]. Summing
    up, Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, and IOTA are three prominent DLTs that can revolutionize
    the agrifood sector. While they cater to different agrifood needs, their combined
    strengths can create a holistic solution that addresses the challenges and opportunities
    of the sector. By integrating them into suitable ecosystems as characterized in
    Salzano et al. [32], innovators can ignite a global business transformation that
    benefits farmers, businesses, consumers, and the environment. 5.2. Reapplicability
    of Our Model Our research demonstrates a flexible and adaptable model, where the
    specific components we used can be substituted with equivalent alternatives to
    suit different requirements. Database Management System Flexibility: While our
    study leverages the capabilities of MongoDB, the architecture of our model is
    not limited to this particular DBMS. The design is compatible with various other
    database management systems, enhancing the model’s applicability across diverse
    data management scenarios. Hardware Versatility: In terms of hardware, our choice
    of the Raspberry Pi 4 is illustrative rather than prescriptive. The model can
    be adapted to work with a range of single board computers or similar devices,
    provided they possess comparable technical capabilities. This flexibility ensures
    that our model can be deployed in a variety of hardware environments. Sensor Selection
    and Adaptability: We chose specific sensors for monitoring key parameters in the
    rice supply chain. However, this selection is not rigid. Different sensors can
    be employed based on the requirements of other agrifood products or supply chains.
    The adaptability of our model to various sensor types and data inputs underscores
    its potential for broader application in agriculture. Cross-Product and Supply
    Chain Applicability: While our Proof-of-Concept is centered on rice cultivation,
    the underlying model is designed to be transferable to other agrifood supply chains.
    This transferability is facilitated by the selection of appropriate sensors and
    the integration of various communication protocols. System and OS Compatibility
    through Containerization: Our model’s use of containerization technology ensures
    its portability and compatibility across different systems and operating systems.
    This aspect of the design significantly enhances the model’s utility and ease
    of deployment in diverse IT environments. In summary, the design of our study
    reflects a commitment to versatility and adaptability, allowing for the application
    of our model in a variety of agricultural contexts beyond its initial implementation.
    6. Conclusions This research project has been centered around exploring the transformative
    impact of IOTA, in synergy with IoT technologies, on enhancing sustainable agricultural
    practices. Our study specifically targeted the optimization of water-resource
    consumption in rice field irrigation, which is a critical aspect of sustainable
    agriculture. The core objective of our study was to meticulously monitor and improve
    resource utilization, with a particular emphasis on water efficiency. The results
    demonstrate that an intelligent irrigation system, powered by advanced sensor
    technology, can be instrumental in achieving sustainable cultivation practices.
    This system enables real-time data acquisition and analysis, which are pivotal
    in guiding empirical practices for resource optimization. Specifically, we observed
    the potential of this system to significantly reduce water usage by up to 50%,
    lower nitrogen consumption by 25%, and decrease methane emissions by 50% to 70%.
    A key aspect of our system is its ability to compile historical data on water
    usage, providing a rich dataset for strategizing future resource management approaches.
    The integration of IoT devices, particularly those managed through IOTA’s technology,
    has proven exceptionally effective in handling and analyzing large volumes of
    data, thereby boosting the overall efficiency and precision of agricultural processes.
    A notable accomplishment of this project was the seamless and rapid data transmission
    from the field (via Raspberry Pi) to the cloud. This was achieved with minimal
    latency, demonstrating the effectiveness of MQTT in data routing and the capacity
    of IOTA to provide near-real-time recording and optimal storage for extensive
    datasets. Despite some latency challenges encountered with MongoDB, it played
    a crucial role as an intermediary, facilitating effective communication and data
    management between IOTA and other integrated technologies. This integration was
    pivotal in enhancing data organization and processing speed. Looking ahead, future
    research could explore optimizing sensor sampling rates to make them more dynamic
    and responsive to environmental and inventory conditions. Additionally, adjusting
    the number of active sensors based on these parameters could enhance efficiency,
    allowing some IoT devices to enter a sleep mode when not needed, thus conserving
    energy. In conclusion, this research highlights the integral role of IOTA, particularly
    in tandem with the IoT, in the future of sustainable agriculture. IOTA emerges
    not just as one of many options, but as a particularly compelling choice for real-time
    monitoring and implementation of sustainable agricultural practices. Its application
    extends beyond mere data tracking to actively influencing and optimizing on-ground
    practices, aligning closely with the global goals of environmental conservation
    and food security. This study affirms that the synergy of IOTA and IoT is not
    just a computational marvel but a practical tool for empirical advancements in
    agriculture. Author Contributions Conceptualization, R.P. and R.C.; methodology,

  description: This paper reviews the emerging and critical role of Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) in transforming modern agriculture into
    a more sustainable and efficient practice. Faced with escalating global population
    demands and a myriad of challenges such as climate change, labor costs, and market
    fluctuations, the agricultural sector is at a pivotal juncture. The integration
    of AI and IoT offers a beacon of hope, enabling smarter farming methods through
    real-time monitoring, data analysis, and management of agricultural processes.
    This review delves into the application of these technologies in various facets
    of farming, including precision agriculture, crop yield forecasting, and the management
    of resources. It explores how AI's analytical prowess can predict and address
    crop diseases, automate farming operations, and assist in decision-making, while
    IoT's network of sensors and devices facilitates the real-time tracking and monitoring
    of farm conditions. Additionally, the synergy of these technologies with blockchain
    and cloud computing is examined, highlighting their potential in enhancing transparency,
    data security, and supply chain management. Collectively, these technological
    innovations are not just reshaping the agricultural landscape but are instrumental
    in steering it towards a more sustainable, productive, and resilient future.

    the emerging and critical role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet
    of Things (IoT) in transforming modern agriculture into a more sustainable and
    efficient practice. Faced with escalating global population demands and a myriad
    of challenges such as climate change, labor costs, and market fluctuations, the
    agricultural sector is at a pivotal juncture. The integration of AI and IoT offers
    a beacon of hope, enabling smarter farming methods through real-time monitoring,
    data analysis, and management of agricultural processes. This review delves into
    the application of these technologies in various facets of farming, including
    precision agriculture, crop yield forecasting, and the management of resources.
    It explores how AI''s analytical prowess can predict and address crop diseases,
    automate farming operations, and assist in decision-making, while IoT''s network
    of sensors and devices facilitates the real-time tracking and monitoring of farm
    conditions. Additionally, the synergy of these technologies with blockchain and
    cloud computing is examined, highlighting their potential in enhancing transparency,
    data security, and supply chain management. Collectively, these technological
    innovations are not just reshaping the agricultural landscape but are instrumental
    in steering it towards a more sustainable, productive, and resilient future. Key

  description: In irrigation agriculture, predicting groundwater level (GWL) using
    deep learning models can help decision-makers coordinate surface water and groundwater
    usage, thus aiding in the sustainable development and utilization of groundwater.
    However, when making a long sequence prediction, prediction sequences often have
    severe delays affecting the availability of prediction results. In this paper,
    a new loss function is proposed to minimize the lag and oversmoothing on the prediction
    of GWLs. GWL, meteorology, and pumping data are collected via an irrigation Internet
    of Things system in Hutubi County, Xinjiang. Through Pearson’s correlation analysis,
    historical potential evapotranspiration (ET0), groundwater extraction, and GWL
    were chosen to predict GWLs. Datasets were constructed through the proposed spatiotemporal
    data fusion method; then, the best model from the six deep learning models was
    selected by comparing the prediction capability of the datasets. Finally, the
    mean-squared error (MSE) loss function is replaced by the proposed loss function.
    Compared to the mean absolute error, MSE, and predicted sequence graphs, the new
    loss function significantly depresses the time delay with similar prediction accuracy.

    level (GWL) using deep learning models can help decision-makers coordinate surface
    water and groundwater usage, thus aiding in the sustainable development and utilization
    of groundwater. However, when making a long sequence prediction, prediction sequences
    often have severe delays affecting the availability of prediction results. In
    this paper, a new loss function is proposed to minimize the lag and oversmoothing
    on the prediction of GWLs. GWL, meteorology, and pumping data are collected via
    an irrigation Internet of Things system in Hutubi County, Xinjiang. Through Pearson''s
    correlation analysis, historical potential evapotranspiration (ET0), groundwater
    extraction, and GWL were chosen to predict GWLs. Datasets were constructed through
    the proposed spatiotemporal data fusion method; then, the best model from the
    six deep learning models was selected by comparing the prediction capability of
    the datasets. Finally, the mean-squared error (MSE) loss function is replaced
    by the proposed loss function. Compared to the mean absolute error, MSE, and predicted
    sequence graphs, the new loss function significantly depresses the time delay
    with similar prediction accuracy. HIGHLIGHTS Listen An integrated loss function
    considering the Euclidean error, time warping, and time delay is proposed to depress
    the time-delay problem of the predicted sequences. A novel data fusion approach
    was introduced by incorporating the groundwater extraction data from motive pumping
    wells into the prediction of groundwater levels. data fusion, deep learning, groundwater
    level prediction, loss function INTRODUCTION Listen To ensure regular access to
    quality food, natural resources such as land, air, and water must be sustainably
    managed and utilized (FAO et al. 2022). Agriculture is the industry with the largest
    water consumption and water intake. In China, the largest irrigated country in
    the world, agriculture accounts for 61.56% of the total water consumption, with
    irrigated lands accounting for 51.62% of the total area and irrigated grain output
    accounting for 75% of the total grain production (Ministry of Water Resources,
    PRC 2022). However, the effective utilization coefficient of farmland irrigation
    water in China is only 0.568, which is far lower than the level of 0.7–0.8 in
    developed countries (Ministry of Water Resources, PRC 2022). A large amount of
    groundwater consumed by the evapotranspiration of crops leads to a continuous
    decline in groundwater levels (GWLs). Strengthening irrigation groundwater resource
    management is both urgent and necessary. With the development of Internet of Things
    (IoT) technologies, agricultural irrigation is gradually becoming data-driven.
    Through the use of soil humidity, soil temperature, and weather forecast data
    to predict the irrigation demand of farmland, accurate automatic irrigation can
    be achieved (Goap et al. 2018). The use of a deep convolutional neural network
    (DCNN) to accurately predict soil moisture, temperature, and humidity is able
    to support intelligent irrigation in crop production with high yields and low
    amounts of water (Kumar et al. 2022). Calibrating intelligent near-infrared spectral
    data using a DCNN architecture is expected to provide intelligent technical support
    to address the water cycle and conservation problems of agricultural farming (Cambra
    Baseca et al. 2019). Automated irrigation has been achieved with the support of
    soil moisture sensors and intelligent irrigation systems (Benedict 1988). The
    agricultural industry of today is data-centric, precise, and more intelligent
    than ever before (Ayaz et al. 2019). As one of the main sources of irrigation,
    the GWL needs to be predicted for sustainable use. Data acquisition and parameter
    selection are key to predicting the GWL. Monitoring the dynamic GWL data can elucidate
    the current situation of groundwater utilization, enabling decision-makers to
    realize the sustainable use of groundwater and plan accordingly (He et al. 2021).
    Time-series predictions based on historical GWLs and rainfall are reliable methods
    for predicting future GWLs (Bloomfield et al. 2003). Human activities also have
    an obvious impact on GWLs. For example, groundwater extraction significantly affects
    the GWL (Marco & Mathieu 2017). In contrast, the GWLs in western and northwest
    China have decreased significantly. In addition to human activities, temperature
    also has a high correlation with GWLs (Zhao et al. 2019). China has built large-scale
    GWL monitoring and meteorological monitoring stations, which can effectively predict
    GWLs by considering a variety of data sources. Besides the data, the model is
    crucial for the prediction as well. Many machine learning methods have been successfully
    used by researchers for data-driven GWL prediction based on a variety of data
    sources. For example, rainfall and aquifer depths can be well predicted by multiple
    linear regression models (Mogaji et al. 2015). Researchers have also used support
    vector machines and wavelet transforms to predict GWLs (Zhou et al. 2017a, 2017b).
    Annual and seasonal GWL trend studies have been performed using the Mann–Kendall
    (MK) method, and fitting and prediction analyses have been carried out using autoregressive
    integrated moving average (ARIMA) modeling (Satish Kumar & Venkata Rathnam 2019).
    In recent years, deep learning models for GWL prediction have also been highlighted.
    Combining empirical model decomposition (Zhang et al. 2022), principal component
    analysis (Kim et al. 2021), wavelet, and other pretreatment methods with deep
    learning models such as gated recurrent unit (GRU) (Gharehbaghi et al. 2022),
    and long short-term memory (LSTM) (Shin et al. 2020; Kim et al. 2021; Zhang et
    al. 2022) networks has achieved reliable results in accurately predicting GWLs.
    Despite the lack of research, a transformer has shown a strong potentiality in
    predicting GWL because it could capture long-distance dependence (Vaswani et al.
    2017) and can adapt to time-series prediction tasks. In New York City, transformers
    have shown excellent performance in short-term power load forecasting (Ran et
    al. 2023), network data prediction (Kong et al. 2022), photovoltaic power generation
    forecasting (Tian et al. 2022), and financial time-series prediction (Preeti &
    Singh 2022). The high calculation time complexity of self-attention, the large
    memory footprint caused by high numbers of parameters, and the slow prediction
    speed of the step-by-step mechanism have led to the difficult large-scale generalization
    of transformer-based models (Zhou et al. 2021). The Informer, with its prob-attention
    mechanism, was therefore proposed, effectively solving the shortcomings of the
    transformer and achieving results beyond those of LSTM, ARIMA, and other models
    on power load prediction datasets (Zhou et al. 2021). The accuracy of groundwater
    depth prediction modeling is of great significance to the rational utilization
    of groundwater resources, the sustainable development of regional social economies,
    and the evaluation of ecological environments (Zhang et al. 2019). The integrated
    response of GWLs to several factors including climate, topography, groundwater
    extraction, and hydrogeology and their interactions makes GWL simulation a challenging
    task (Hai et al. 2022). Although there are areas where monitoring data are lacking,
    distribution estimates of groundwater extraction based on groundwater balance
    models, land use, statistical information, and qualitative surveys can be used
    to predict underground water levels (Vu et al. 2020a). However, most studies have
    focused on prediction accuracy, and the time-delay problem of prediction series
    makes it difficult to apply these models in the actual project. We need effective
    methods to reduce the delay in prediction when predicting GWL, in addition to
    selecting the appropriate parameters and models. In this study, groundwater extraction
    and meteorological data were obtained, along with GWL monitoring data from electromechanical
    wells, through a regional irrigation IoT system. The obtained data were preprocessed,
    including outlier correction, linear interpolation, and wavelet filtering. The
    most suitable prediction parameters were selected by performing the correlation
    analysis. Comparing the multiple time-scale prediction results of LSTM, GRU, multi-layer
    perceptron (MLP), one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1DCNN), the Transformer
    and the informer select the most suitable model. A new loss function is presented
    and its effectiveness in reducing the delay in predicted sequences is verified.
    Study area and data Listen Hutubi County, belonging to the Changji Hui Autonomous
    Prefecture of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, is located in the central and
    northern parts of Xinjiang, with a total population of 220,000, geographical coordinates
    spanning from east longitude 86°5′ to 87°8′ and north latitude 43°7′ to 45°20′,
    and a total area of 9,518 km2. Hutubi County has a temperate continental arid
    and semi-arid climate. The average temperature in the plain area is 6.7 °C, the
    annual precipitation is 167 mm, the average frost-free period is 180 days, and
    the annual total sunshine duration is 3,090 h; the annual effective accumulated
    temperature, which is stable at more than 10 °C, is 3,553 °C. Cotton, corn, and
    wheat are the main crops in the county. From May to August, crops grow in the
    plain areas; the average sunshine hours are more than 10 h/d in the season of
    vigorous growth and more than 11 h in July. The combination of high evaporation
    rates and low rainfall has promoted the development of irrigated agriculture.
    However, due to the extensive exploitation of groundwater, the GWL in the county
    continues to decline. To ensure the safety and sustainable development of groundwater
    resources, the government has established a dual control monitoring system for
    well electricity to monitor and control the development of local groundwater resources.
    Water-power control equipment (WPCE) (Figure 1), by installing ultrasonic flow
    meters at the wellhead pipelines, can accurately monitor the pumping of the motive
    pumping well (MPW) and has become an important component of the agricultural water
    conservancy IoT in Hutubi. The county has 1,656 WPCEs that access the irrigation
    IoT, covering almost all MPWs in the county. These WPCEs collect data on groundwater
    extraction in Hutubi County. The wide distribution of equipment and the short
    collection interval make the data that effectively reflect the spatial and temporal
    characteristics of groundwater extraction, which were grouped into seven groups
    based on latitude and longitude. The data used in this study are water withdrawal
    data from the Hutubi Plain area spanning from 2017 to 2022, as well as GWL monitoring
    data and meteorological data of the area during the same period. Figure 1 VIEW
    LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Study area and distribution of GWL monitoring stations. GWL
    is obtained using pressure-type GWL meters (Figure 1). The GWL data are the daily
    data from GWL monitoring stations (GWLMS) 1–7 distributed in the county. The climate
    data, collected using integrated meteorological monitoring stations, include daily
    rainfall, temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and ET0. Figure 2 shows
    the IoT terminal equipment used to collect various types of data. Figure 2 VIEW
    LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE IoT monitoring devices. Method Listen In this study, multi-source
    data were fused, and the Penman–Monteith (Allan et al. 1998) formula was used
    to calculate ET0. Figure 3 shows the forecast flow. Figure 3 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD
    SLIDE Forecast flowchart. Deep learning models Listen This study used the six
    models for the long time-series prediction of GWLs. They can be divided into four
    categories. Both LSTM and GRU are recurrent neural networks. The LSTM consists
    of three gate units (namely, a forgetting gate, an input gate, an output gate),
    and a memory unit (Zheng et al. 2017). The GRU is improved from the LSTM, combining
    the cell state and the hidden state into one state, and is controlled using the
    update gate and the reset gate (Cho et al. 2014). MLP is the most classic deep
    learning model, whose structure involves the full connection of multiple monolayers
    that are composed of a group of neurons (Benedict 1988). 1DCNN uses multiple convolution
    kernels to extract features by convolution calculation, and the output serves
    as the input to the next layer of convolution operations (Zhou et al. 2017a, 2017b).
    The Transformer and the Informer connect encoders and decoders through a self-attention
    mechanism, which is a new deep learning structure. We have the input, a multivariable
    time series: (1) where N is the variable dimension; is the length of the input
    time series; and is the input value of dimension i at time t. The output is to
    predict the corresponding sequence: (2) where N is the variable dimension; is
    the length of the output time series; and is the output value of dimension i at
    time t. Self-attention is defined based on a dot product between tuple inputs:
    calculated query vector, key vector, and value vector. The degree of correlation
    of the corresponding sequences was calculated. ProbSparse self-attention, based
    on the proposed measurement, allows each key to attend only to the dominant u
    queries, and the equation is as follows: (3) where is a sparse matrix containing
    only the top-u queries; K and V are keys and values, respectively; and d is the
    input dimension. The Transformer relies on self-attention, and the Informer relies
    on ProbSparse self-attention. All six model structures are illustrated in Figure
    4. Figure 4 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Structure chart of six deep learning models.
    Error measure and model evaluation Listen In this study, two error metrics are
    used to evaluate the forecasting results: mean-squared error (MSE) and mean absolute
    error (MAE); these are commonly used error evaluation indicators in underground
    water level prediction tasks (Hai et al. 2022): (4) (5) where is the real measure
    of GWL; is the estimated value of GWL; and is the mean of ⁠. Loss function Listen
    Deep neural networks can become a real-time tool to predict GWL for a certain
    period, just requiring input of historical data after iterative supervised learning.
    Supervised learning relies on the back-propagation mechanism, the most critical
    of which is to calculate the bias of the predicted and supervised values, and
    the function used to measure the bias is called the loss function. Customarily,
    MSE is taken as the loss function when predicting GWL. However, when there are
    serious delay phenomena and shape errors in time-series prediction, it renders
    the prediction meaningless. Time delay refers to the delay of the predicted sequence
    compared to the real sequence. To address the delay phenomenon predicted by the
    model, a new loss function is designed to penalize Euclidean distance errors and
    time delays simultaneously, and the corresponding coefficients, α, β, and γ, can
    be determined according to the specific dataset. The loss function based on Euclidean
    distance is defined as follows: (6) Differentiable dynamic time warping (Marco
    & Mathieu 2017) (soft DTW) is used to evaluate the shape difference between the
    predicted series and the original series. The shape loss function is calculated
    as follows: (7) The time loss index (TDI) (Le Guen & Thorne 2019) is used as a
    time loss function and is defined as follows: (8) The final comprehensive loss
    function is defined as follows: (9) Figure 5 shows the DTW and the TDI algorithm
    with a 20-unit length sequence as an example. Sequence similarity is usually calculated
    in a ‘one-to-one’ mode, representing deviations accumulating between corresponding
    points. DTW scales the time series and calculates the similarity, which can better
    reflect the overall shape similarity of the sequence. The dtw represents the inner
    product of the path matrix and the corresponding Euclidean distance vector. In
    Figure 5, A is the path matrix for calculating the similarity, the red point is
    1, and the blank is 0. Δ is the corresponding Euclidean distance vector. The DTW
    formula is as follows: (10) Figure 5 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Representation of
    the DTW and TDI algorithms. The ‘one-to-many’ model of DTW causes the predicted
    sequence to lag behind the supervised sequence. To alleviate this delay, TDI is
    used to penalize it. TDI represents the inner product of the path gradient matrix
    A* = ∇dtw(⁠⁠) and the penalty matrix Ω = [ωij], defined as ωij = δ * (i − j) 2/n2:
    (11) Data fusion method Listen Due to the different locations and different numbers
    of weather stations, electromechanical wells, and GWL monitoring stations, the
    data collection interval industry is not unified, and the spatiotemporal data
    fusion of the three types of data is needed. All parameters were resampled with
    a time interval of daily. MPWs were associated with the nearest GWLMSs based on
    the minimum distance calculated using geographic longitude and latitude coordinates.
    The clustering formula is as follows: (12) (13) (14) where is the longitude; is
    the latitude; is the parameter value of i MPW; is the parameter value of j GWLMS;
    and a is the number of MPWs in j aggregation. All GWLMSs share the same sequence
    of meteorological data. RESULTS Parameter selection and data preprocessing Listen
    A correlation analysis was performed on the alternative parameters to determine
    the input parameters of the model. The results of the correlation analysis are
    shown in Table 1, where ET0 and daily water volume were associated with GWL, while
    other parameters showed little correlation with GWL. Table 1 Result of Pearson''s

    the corresponding parameter on the right has a high correlation with the groundwater
    level. The three parameters were preprocessed. Figure 6 shows the cluster results
    of MPWs and pumping volume for each group. There are missing values in the GWL
    monitoring data from the pressure-type GWL meter. To address this issue, the linear
    interpolation method is employed to supplement the data, and wavelet hard threshold
    filtering is applied to remove ultrashort-term fluctuations. Figure 7 illustrates
    the GWLs and smoothed GWLs at each monitoring point over the last six years. Among
    the monitoring stations, GWLMS3 is characterized by a short-term, accelerated
    decline in GWL. Figure 6 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Cluster results of MPWs and
    pumping volume for each group. Figure 7 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE GWL from pressure-type
    GWL meters. Over the last six years, ET0 has exhibited annual cyclical variations
    ranging from 0.34 to 19.22 mm/d. In the short term, ET0 random fluctuations are
    large. Wavelet hard threshold filtering is applied to remove short-term fluctuations,
    and retaining only the annual cycles helps to improve the accuracy of the predicted
    GWLs. Figure 8 shows the ET0 and high-frequency random fluctuation over the last
    six years in the Hutubi region. Figure 8 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Denoised ET0
    over the last six years and high-frequency random fluctuation. Selection of the
    deep learning model Listen Model building and data analysis were performed using
    Python3.0. The datasets are divided into large quantum sequences according to
    the set time step, and these subsequences are divided into a training set, a validation
    set, and a test set in the order of the time axis for model training and prediction.
    The ratio between the training set, the validation set, and the test set is 7:1:2.
    The model parameters are set as follows: heads: 2, padding: 0, dropout: 0.05,
    train epoch: 50, batch size: 64, initial learning rate: 0.0001, and Informer model
    Prob factor: 10. Each model is trained 30 times. Figure 9 presents the average
    MAE and average MSE of the model prediction with output lengths of 12, 24, and
    36. The Informer performed the best among the six datasets because it has the
    smallest error on almost all datasets, and the average MAEs were 0.199, 0.231,
    and 0.339 m and MSEs were 0.264, 0.325, and 0.417 at three predicted lengths,
    respectively. Figure 9 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE MAE and MSE of six models’ prediction.
    Depress time delay Listen The Informer performed the best on the GWLMS1 dataset.
    Figure 10 shows the time delay and time warping in GWLMS1 and GWLMS4. The parameters
    of the loss function Lintegrated are set as follows: α = 0.75, β = 0.55, and γ
    = 0.1 after testing. Figure 10 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Time delay and time warping.
    Figure 11 shows the prediction sequences when the Lintegrated and MSE loss functions
    are selected for prediction on the GWLMS1 dataset. In contrast with MSE (blue
    line), selecting Lintegrated as the loss function yields predicted sequences (yellow
    line) that closely align with the changing trend of the original sequence and
    effectively mitigates the prediction delay problem. Figure 11 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD
    SLIDE Predicted time series using different loss functions. Meanwhile, we compared
    the MAE and MSE of the prediction results when using two loss functions, MSE and
    Lintegrated. Table 2 shows the results. Of the 18 group results, Lintegrated outperformed
    MSE on 11. In the remaining seven groups, the mean MAE using Lintegrated was only
    0.037 m higher than that using MSE, and the mean MSE was 0.06 higher. This demonstrates
    that the Lintegrated loss function can achieve comparable or even superior results
    to MSE, further confirming the above conclusion. Table 2 Performance of the Informer

    indicates that the corresponding parameter on the right has a high correlation
    with the groundwater level. CONCLUSIONS Listen In this study, groundwater extraction
    data, meteorological data, and GWL monitoring data were collected through an IoT
    system for irrigation. ET0, groundwater extraction, and GWL were selected to predict
    the underground water table based on the Pearson correlation analysis. The correlation
    of the rainfall with the water table is low due to very little rainfall in the
    study area. After the data were preprocessed, a novel data fusion approach was
    introduced by incorporating the groundwater extraction data from MPWs into the
    prediction of GWLs, constructing the GWLMS1–7 datasets. Informer, was selected
    from seven models including LSTM, GRU, MLP, 1 DCNN, Transformer, and Informer,
    performing the best on six datasets. To address the time-delay problem of the
    predicted sequences, an integrated loss function considering the Euclidean error,
    time warping, and time delay is proposed. On six datasets, smaller MSE and MAE
    were achieved using the integrated loss function compared to the MSE loss function.
    In the end, this paper summarizes the GWL prediction models selected in previous
    studies, as well as prediction time granularities and model performances. It is
    easy to deduce from Table 3 that our prediction error is acceptable compared to
    previous studies; results of MSE and MAE are comparable and even better. Table

  description: The agricultural sector faces several difficulties today in ensuring
    the safety of food supply, including water scarcity. This study presents the design
    and development of a low-cost and full-featured fog-IoT/AI system targeted towards
    smallholder farmer communities (SFCs). However, the smallholder community is hesitant
    to adopt technology-based solutions. There are many overwhelming reasons for this,
    but the high cost, implementation complexity, and malfunctioning sensors cause
    inappropriate decisions. The PRIMA INTEL-IRRIS project aims to make digital and
    innovative agricultural technologies more appealing and available to these communities
    by advancing the intelligent irrigation “in-the-box” concept. Considered a vital
    resource, collected data are used to detect anomalies or abnormal behavior, providing
    information about an occurrence or a node failure. To prevent agro-field data
    leakage, this paper presents an innovative, smart, and sustainable low-cost irrigation
    system that employs artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to analyze anomalies
    and problems in water usage. The sensor anomaly can be detected using an autoencoder
    (AE) and a generative adversarial network (GAN). We will feed the autoencoders’
    anomaly detection models with time series records from the datasets and replace
    detected anomalies with the reconstructed outputs. When integrated with an IoT
    platform, this methodology is a tool for easing the labeling of sensor anomalies
    and can help create supervised datasets for future research. In addition, anomalies
    can be corrected by prediction models based on deep learning approaches, applying
    CNN/BiLSTM architecture. The results show that AEs outperform the GANs, achieving
    an accuracy of 90%, 95%, and 97% for soil moisture, air temperature, and air humidity,
    respectively. The proposed system is designed to ensure that the data are of high
    quality and reliable enough to make sound decisions compared to the existing platforms.

    Considered a vital resource, collected data are used to detect anomalies or abnormal

    to increase by close to 2 billion by 2050, causing a rapid escalation in food
    demand. To cater to the needs of the increasing population, the agricultural industry
    needs to be modernized, smart, and automated [1]. The food and agriculture organization
    (FAO) [2] claims that small-scale farming significantly contributes to rural economies
    and food security. On the other hand, smallholders usually deal with a range of
    restrictions that reduce their ability to produce profitably and advance the economy
    [3]. However, smallholder farmer communities (SFCs) have not benefited from adopting
    solutions to increase irrigation efficiency because of the high starting costs
    and the high skill levels needed to understand the technology. Recently, the fourth
    industrial revolution (IR 4.0) paradigm shift has ushered in a surge in technological
    innovation and sustainable transformation across various industries and sectors
    [4]. The innovative use of printed sensors for measurement and monitoring in smart
    agricultural applications has garnered considerable attention. Smart farming utilizing
    printed sensors is in its infancy and requires additional research [5]. Significant
    limitations restrict SFCs’ productivity and profit potential. As a result of a
    variety of crucial issues, including a lack of agricultural expertise, financial
    resources, climate change, and market access to address these challenges, we propose
    in this research a low-cost (USD 260) smart farming system for monitoring and
    prediction that will assist SFCs in forecasting future data in order to compute
    their water demands and properly schedule irrigation. The sensor component employs
    a low-cost design that is basic but sturdy and efficient, inspired by various
    do-it-yourself (DIY) initiatives and previous contributions [6,7]. In terms of
    accuracy and error reduction, the system outperforms others. In this context,
    the goal of the PRIMA INTEL-IRRIS project [8] is to increase the visibility and
    accessibility of digital and smart agricultural technologies among small and medium-sized
    farms. To meet the needs of this community, the suggested solutions must be economical,
    easy to implement in the field, and, most importantly, adaptable to current agricultural
    techniques. As a result, by inventing a low-cost, smart irrigation control system,
    INTEL-IRRIS hopes to transform the view that SFCs have of what was formerly highly
    expensive technology. INTEL-IRRIS also hopes that by using the “intelligent irrigation
    in a box” idea, they can make smart irrigation systems as easy to set up and use
    as home appliances, with a small investment compared to how much money they make.
    The main objective of this research is to improve on our previous work [3,9] by
    increasing the accuracy of low-cost sensors for data collection so that our water–soil–plants–climate
    interaction models will provide increased accuracy of predicted environmental
    factors to enhance the irrigation efficiency of smallholder farmers. There is
    a current need for our low-cost fog-IoT/AI system, version 1.0, that employs deep
    learning to analyze in real-time the anomalies and problems that appear in low-cost
    sensors. To reach this goal, we propose a low-cost, sustainable irrigation system
    that helps smallholder farmers manage irrigation more efficiently by providing
    a low-cost, open-source, autonomous, and easy-to-use smart irrigation control
    system that takes advantage of IoT capabilities, as shown in Figure 1. Figure
    1. “Intelligent irrigation in a box” idea of PRIMA INTEL-IRRIS project. We will
    implement the “Intelligent Irrigation in a Box” idea by presenting a sensor/ control/actuator-based
    “plug-and-sense” system using significant technological advances from the last
    few years, including IoT, artificial intelligence (AI), and decision support systems
    (DSS). This technology may be linked with existing irrigation infrastructure [10,11],
    allowing it to be controlled according to smallholders’ customs. Using sensor
    technologies, the provided platform collects critical physical phenomena such
    as soil moisture, air temperature, air humidity, water level, water velocity,
    and light intensity using a DL methodology. An unsupervised learning approach
    is well-suited for detecting anomalies, especially in cases with limited labeled
    time-series samples and complex, nonlinear climate and soil patterns. According
    to the literature, the most promising approaches for anomaly detection are Autoencoders
    [12] and GANs [13] in time series. The sliding window technique is highly appropriate
    for predicting future sensor readings through a supervised learning approach.
    Utilizing a hybrid deep learning architecture, combining convolutional and recurrent
    neural networks, enables the attainment of a minimal estimation error for similar
    sequence-to-sequence prediction problems [14]. Consideration is given to a novel
    Fog-IoT-Cloud platform for storing, analyzing, and using vast volumes of acquired
    data to assist SFCs in managing the irrigation mechanism efficiently. This work’s
    main contributions are as follows: (i) The design and development of a low-cost
    fog-IoT/AI system, version 1.0, fully targeted towards smallholder farmer communities
    (SFCs) to enhance irrigation decision making. (ii) We provide a comprehensive
    performance assessment and comparison between the autoencoders (AE) and generative
    adversarial networks (GAN) to detect anomalies in environmental factors data.
    (iii) Predicting the most important environmental factors (air temperature, air
    humidity, soil moisture) based on field sensory data and weather forecast data
    using CNN/BiLSTM architecture to provide SFCs with recommendations. The rest of
    the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents a review of the relevant
    literature on irrigation systems. The INTEL-IRRIS fog-IoT/AI system, at the heart
    of the architectural design discussed in this paper, will be presented in Section
    3. Sensor anomaly detection for smart irrigation systems is provided in Section
    4. Section 5 describes the most important environmental factors that can be predicted
    using deep learning. Finally, conclusions and future trends are given in Section
    6. 2. Related Studies In this section, we present a review of the relevant literature
    on irrigation systems. Each of them has focused on various aspects of the irrigation
    task. As illustrated in Table 1, we categorize the studies based on the following
    criteria: (i) Underground sensing: the IOUT requirement emerges partially or fully
    buried underground for real-time monitoring and soil sensing; several essential
    irrigation characteristics include soil moisture, soil texture, soil salinity,
    etc. (ii) Environmental sensing: it is used to monitor important weather pattern
    changes in real-time. (iii) Geographic information systems (GIS): provide a potent
    instrument for near-real-time analysis of crop status. Ground-based equipment,
    aerial drones, and satellites all collect GIS agriculture data. (iv) Soil texture:
    on precision agriculture (PA), we computed the useable reserve of water (RU) based
    on the soil texture (clay, limon, sand, organic matter). (v) Machine learning
    approaches: it indicates whether the study considered machine learning approaches
    for intrusion detection systems. (vi) Deep learning approaches: it specifies if
    the study was focused on deep learning approaches for intrusion detection systems.
    (vii) Low-cost: the objective of the Intel-Irris project is to use low-cost sensors
    by dividing the cost by a factor of 10 to 100. (viii) Anomaly detection: the detection
    of anomalies is a crucial stage that will enhance the quality of results in predictive
    modeling and pattern extraction, enabling the identification of problems and facilitating
    decision making in data-based services. In our previous works [3,9], we suggested
    an Edge-IoT-Cloud platform based on a deep learning methodology for monitoring
    and predicting farmers’ ability to satisfy crop water demands when there is insufficient
    rainfall. Recently, Citoni et al. [15] published a review and analysis of currently
    available LoRaWAN-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) applications for intelligent
    agriculture. Vuran et al. [16] focus only on the underground factors; however,
    environmental sensing and SIG play a very important role in irrigation tasks.
    Optimizing water resources for agricultural production using an automated irrigation
    system has proven feasible and cost-effective, as proposed by Gutierrez et al.
    [17]. Table 1. A comparative analysis between the proposed platform and previous
    platform.   A few scientific studies focus on the application of data processing
    techniques to agricultural data in order to develop a more robust decision support
    framework. Roopaei et al. [22] presented an appropriate approach to identifying
    key parameters to schedule irrigation: the amount of water used was monitored,
    irrigation was scheduled on the basis of the canopy temperature distribution of
    the plant, and data were collected by means of thermal imaging. However, using
    the thermal imaging technique has many drawbacks that affect irrigation scheduling:
    different emissivities and reflections from surfaces obstruct precise temperature
    measurements, and most thermal imaging cameras have ±2% accuracy. Also, thermal
    images are difficult to interpret for specific objects with erratic temperatures.
    Aurora et al. [25], using unsupervised algorithms, devised and tested a three-step
    irrigation system for urban parks. By extracting prior knowledge using a multivariate
    approach, this methodology reduces the time required by univariate anomaly detection
    systems to analyze the entire univariate time series. Goap et al. [19] proposed
    a smart irrigation architecture based on IoT and a hybrid approach that relies
    on DL to predict soil moisture. The proposed algorithm uses sensor data collected
    from recent and past weather forecasts to predict soil moisture. However, environmental
    sensing is not sufficient to make a good irrigation schedule, and the authors
    also do not take into consideration the crop coefficient and the soil texture.
    Chen et al. [26] suggest a new approach for making irrigation decisions in paddy
    rice farming that uses deep Q-learning and short-term weather predictions. The
    new method was compared to the widespread practice of flooded irrigation in southern
    China. The results indicated the reliability of the daily rainfall forecast and
    the efficiency of the Deep Q-Learning strategy for saving water. Boursianis et
    al. [23] discussed the AREThOU5A IoT platform subsystems and their primary operations,
    as well as the deployed layered architecture stack. Within the context of the
    AREThOU5A IoT platform, an innovative method for delivering power to the platform’s
    IoT modules has been implemented. Cheema et al. [24] constructed an intelligent
    system with multiple sensors and devices related to internet of things (IoT) technologies.
    In addition, they developed an Android application called \"Kistan Pakistan\"
    that allows illiterate and low-literate farmers to remotely administer its functions.
    Pham et al. [20] described a low-cost and full edge-IoT/AI system targeting smallholder
    farmer communities and how it can provide the intelligent irrigation “in-the-box”
    concept. It offers an “out-of-the-box” function, meaning that the control component
    that recommends irrigation is integrated into the IoT gateway and, as a result,
    does not need an internet connection, as implemented by WAZIUP partner [27]. In
    contrast to previous research, the current study incorporates four factors to
    improve irrigation efficiency, productivity, quality, profitability, and the sustainability
    of agricultural production. In particular, we take into account the following
    factors: (i) soil texture; (ii) crop coefficient; (iii) sensed data with the weather
    forecast; and (iv) sensing of the subsurface parameter, in this instance, soil
    moisture. The objective is to calculate the requisite water quantity based on
    these variables. 3. Supplying Smallholder Farmers with Smart Technology 3.1. A
    Summary of the INTEL-IRRIS and PNR Projects As stated earlier, INTEL-IRRIS [8]
    aims to make digital and intelligent agricultural technology more appealing and
    accessible to small and medium-sized farms. However, a compromise will be made
    to accomplish the primary aim: to create a low-cost irrigation system that SFCs
    can implement out of the box. The soil moisture sensor component follows a basic,
    resilient, and cost-effective design that has been substantially influenced by
    several do-it-yourself projects and prior contributions [6,20]. Unlike low-cost
    sensors that often offer unreliable data, INTEL-IRRIS will significantly improve
    the quality of collected data with (i) improved calibration of various sensors;
    (ii) the calculation of the needed amount of water based on the farm’s soil texture
    and crop coefficient; and (iii) the prediction of environmental factors based
    on field sensory data using DL. 3.2. Smart and Sustainable Irrigation System Figure
    2 shows how the smart farming system architecture collects, transfers, and processes
    physical parameters from small-scale farming, such as soil moisture, air temperature,
    air humidity, water level, water flows, the intensity of light, combustible gas,
    etc., in order to improve irrigation efficiency by deploying a low-cost, open,
    autonomous irrigation control system based on IoT and AI techniques [28]. The
    irrigation scheduling algorithm determines the amount of water required to maintain
    the maximum production potential without wasting water (i) for a particular crop,
    (ii) at a specified time, and (iii) for a specific soil type. The following section
    summarizes the proposed platform’s details. Figure 2. Global view of our proposed
    operational architecture. 3.3. Hardware Architecture As illustrated in Figure
    2, the network component of our platform is supplied via multi-hop communication
    between box A (the sensor layer) and box B (the gateway node) up to box C (the
    fog layer). Finally, a virtual machine (VM) is created on the Azure cloud to deploy
    multiple anomaly detection and prediction models. In addition to using NRF24L01
    modules for wireless communication and Arduino boards as microcontrollers, we
    also intended to use Raspberry Pi 3 B+ boards as a fog layer. 3.4. Software Architecture
    Using open-source development tools, we created a software architecture to reduce
    bandwidth, latency, cost, load balancing, and scalability, as shown in Figure
    3. Using the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol, communication
    between the gateway and server is established. The TCP transport layer protocol
    ensures dependable data transmission (COAP uses UDP). Because of this, it is encrypted
    with SSL, supports quality of service (QoS parameter 2: requires messages to be
    delivered exactly once), and has a much shorter message header than HTTP. Figure
    3. Global view of our software architectural proposal. 3.5. Box A: Sensing Node
    The sensing node, which depicts the field data gathering tool, falls short of
    the total of USD 140. An Atmega328 microprocessor reads the output from these
    sensors. For around two dollars (USD), it may be used to construct a cheap design
    strategy for the Arduino. As seen in Figure 4, this box’s sensor layer devices
    are designed to collect data from smallholder farmers and transmit it using the
    NRF24L01 radio module, which is available for roughly 5 dollars (USD) and enables
    the supply of a radio communication layer with an SPI interface. The farmer can
    examine the data and keep an eye on the crops in real-time since the data may
    be kept in a private database or in the cloud to construct a dataset. Figure 4.

    and NRF module are in the box. Figure 4 provides a comprehensive description of
    the box’s sensors. We then set the NRF24L01 module to write mode and supply the
    destination address; we read the sensor values using the analogRead function on
    the data pins. The measured data are structured and transmitted to the IoT gateway
    every hour, where historical data are stored to detect anomalies at the fog layer.
    For the power supply of the sensor node, we used rechargeable 9 V batteries. Table
    2 lists the cost of all components. In total, a sensing and actuation node costs
    USD 260. A large portion of the budget is for the cost of box C. Table 2. The
    proposed platform cost. 3.6. Box B: Relay Node The relay node acts as an intermediate
    device and transmits the packets to the IoT gateway. In listening mode, we set
    up the gateway node by supplying the node address from whence the packets come,
    the channel number (122), and the data structure; if the data are received, it
    changes to sending mode, at which stage we provide the address of the next node.
    The power supply of the relay node was improved by using two AA batteries. 3.7.
    Box C: IoT Gateway Fog computing facilitates the operation of computation, storage,
    and networking services between end devices and cloud computing. Box C permits
    data to be transmitted to the internet network, but not for a total of USD 90.
    We picked a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ type board since it has adequate hardware resources
    for processing and is based on the Linux kernel, making it compatible with most
    languages and AI libraries. It needs a 5 V power supply, an external Wi-Fi 802.11
    card, and an Ethernet connector to connect to the internet. We used Python to
    create a concurrent TCP server (one thread per request), and we started by loading
    the prediction models from disk into the main memory (the kind of “*.tflite” files
    after the conversion to Tensorflow Lite). When a request comes in, a thread handles
    the receiving and preprocessing, resulting in the prediction. If we are looking
    for anomalies, we must compare the model outputs to an error threshold and provide
    the answer. On demand, we can also utilize the service to adjust the error levels
    of the various models. The server regularly delivers messages that include information
    such as the node’s IP address, available resources (RAM and CPU), and network
    latency. NodeJS listens on the serial port “/dev/tty0” at 115,200 baud. We extracted
    the measurements whenever new data were written to the port (separated by commas).
    We verified that all of the sensors were operational. This information is saved
    in the MySQL database for the time being. Finally, we produced a structured package
    including the latest six readings of each sensor, which had to correlate to the
    detection model anomaly entries. Then, we transmitted the latter to the Python-implemented
    service, which includes the various models; after receiving the answer, we checked
    for anomalies. An HTTP server configured using the “Express” module and listening
    on port 7000 sends the application pages to the browser. The route to each page
    is specified, and communication occurs via the “WebSocket” protocol. Every hour,
    a temporal event is triggered, which transmits the last received packet if none
    has come, allowing us to forecast it. The integrated Wi-Fi card is employed as
    an access point for configuration and adjusting the thresholds of anomaly detection
    models (leaving a means to reach the local network). Finally, data visualization
    from the gateway is required to assist the developer during maintenance. We investigated
    adding slave nodes that handle resource-intensive processing to enhance computing
    power and load balancing. The Raspberry Pi 3 B+ card’s Wi-Fi card creates a wireless
    network that the cluster uses to communicate. 3.8. Cloud Layer We suggest using
    cloud services to store significant volumes of data generated by sensors in order
    to guarantee the accessibility and availability of our platform everywhere and
    at any time. Furthermore, we use them to anticipate future meters, ensuring scalability
    and more resources when our platform is overloaded (elasticity). A free student
    offer was provided to us, and we will utilize it to create a VM with a public
    IP address that we can access via the remote desktop protocol (RDP). As seen in
    Figure 5, Influx DB offers a limited free cloud service, so setting up a user’s
    dashboard for data analysis and monitoring is straightforward. Figure 5. Monitoring
    and analysis of data on the cloud service. 4. Sensor Anomalies Detection for Smart
    Irrigation Systems Deep learning is becoming increasingly popular for tasks beyond
    image recognition, segmentation, and classification. Non-image data have been
    gaining more and more attention in recent years due to the advancement of IoT
    [29]. The main idea of unsupervised anomaly detection in time-series data is to
    identify whether data observations conform to normal data distributions over time.
    With this technique, we can discover patterns and anomalies that are otherwise
    hard to find. In order to spot unexpected patterns or anomalies as the data changes
    over time, it is crucial to comprehend how each variable within the time series
    affects the others. As shown in Figure 6, the received measurements are consolidated
    with the time series records in the local database. These merged data are used
    as input for anomaly detection models, which aim to identify any anomalies or
    unusual patterns within the data. The reconstructed inputs from the model are
    employed to estimate a corrected value for the abnormal measurement. The goal
    is to correct any inaccuracies or abnormalities identified in the original measurement.
    Once the new measure has been adjusted using the sensor value estimation model,
    it is stored back in the local database. This ensures that the corrected measure
    is available for future reference or analysis. In our research, the scarcity of
    labeled anomaly data poses a challenge. Therefore, GANs and AEs present advantageous
    options as they can effectively perform anomaly detection. Additionally, these
    techniques are capable of learning representations that capture both global and
    local dependencies within the data, enabling them to understand complex patterns
    effectively. GANs, in particular, leverage a discriminator network that can accurately
    classify anomalies. AEs focus on reconstructing input data and strive to minimize
    the reconstruction error. A threshold on the reconstruction error allows for the
    efficient identification of anomalies. Figure 6. Illustration of IoT gateway sensor
    anomaly detection and correction process. 4.1. Generative Adversarial Networks
    (GAN) Unsupervised anomaly detection using generative adversarial networks (GAN),
    as illustrated in Figure 7, involves training two models: a generator and a discriminator.
    The generator learns a model representing normal time series variability, while
    the discriminator learns to identify data points that do not conform to the normal
    behavior. The discriminator can then distinguish between time-series data corresponding
    to normal behavior. Moreover, using GANs for unsupervised anomaly detection in
    time-series data helps identify more complex anomalies than traditional methods
    since it can learn more complex dependencies between different variables within
    the time series (backpropagation). Figure 7. Overview of GAN structure. 4.2. Autoencoder
    (AE) Autoencoders are popular-deep learning-based anomaly detection models that
    have been observed to be reliable and effective. What makes this model so successful
    is its ability to reduce the time-series data to a lower dimension and reconstruct
    them in a higher dimension. As illustrated in Figure 8, this encoding and decoding
    can be performed with the help of different deep learning layers, such as convolutional
    layers. Then, the data are decoded to a higher dimension using an autoencoder
    algorithm. These reconstructed data can then be compared to the primary data to
    detect anomalies. Autoencoders have been a successful tool for anomaly detection
    in time-series data. Their efficiency can even be increased with the use of regularization,
    dropout, and noise-reduction techniques. Moreover, the autoencoder model is able
    to independently extract features from the input data, leading to better accuracy
    and lower computing costs. Figure 8. Overview of autoencoder network architecture.
    4.3. Problem Formulation Considering a time-series dataset 𝐷=[ 𝑋 1 ,  𝑋 2 ,…,  𝑋
    𝑛 ]∈ ℝ 𝑡×𝑛 , where each 𝑋 𝑖 =[ 𝑥 1𝑖 ,  𝑥 2𝑖 ,…,  𝑥 𝑡𝑖 ]∈ ℝ 𝑡 (for 𝑖=1,…,𝑛 ) comprising
    data obtained from sensors over a specific period of time t, the suggested model
    is trained with a subset of the dataset 𝐷 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 ∈ ℝ 𝑡×𝑘 which only contains normal
    samples, where k is the number of training samples. The samples for testing are
    𝐷 𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 =[ 𝐷 𝑣 𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 , 𝐷 𝑢 𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 ]∈ ℝ 𝑡×(𝑣+𝑢) , with v and u representing the number
    of normal and abnormal samples, respectively, and 𝑛=𝑘+𝑣+𝑢 . Due to the imbalanced
    nature of the time-series data, the size of normal samples is greater than that
    of abnormal samples. A GAN-based model is trained with 𝐷 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 to reduce the output
    for each output 𝑋 𝑖 in 𝐷 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 . After the training process as shown in Appendix
    A, 𝐷 𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 is passed through the trained model to evaluate it according to unseen
    samples during the learning. The trained generator can then generate fake normal
    samples from the noise vector. The discriminator model is used to accurately classify
    samples into normal or abnormal sequences. Autoencoders can be used as techniques
    for unsupervised or semi-supervised anomaly detection. To train an autoencoder,
    this technique involves training a model on a dataset that contains only normal
    data. We use a supervised learning approach by dividing the dataset into training
    and testing sets. The training 𝐷𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 and testing 𝐷𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 sets are divided into
    input and output components by applying the sliding window approach. This approach
    uses the previous time intervals as both the input and output variables. This
    technique allows us to apply supervised learning to the autoencoder network. To
    evaluate the performance of the trained model, we used the reconstruction error,
    ℒ(𝑥, 𝑥 ̂  ) , which measures the differences between the original input and the
    consequent reconstruction. The amount of discrepancy between a reconstructed representation
    and the original instance is used to calculate the anomaly score. The larger the
    difference, the greater the probability that it is an outlier. Moreover, the cutoff
    point for identifying anomalies can be adjusted by employing cross-validation
    to determine the most suitable threshold (Th) for the reconstruction error. 4.4.
    Dataset Preprocessing The data used in this analysis were obtained from distinct
    sources, as shown in Table 3. These datasets were selected as they encompass soil
    and weather information and have the same hourly sampling rate to address the
    univariate anomaly detection and forecasting queries. The transformation for anomaly
    detection models involves three steps. Firstly, the time series are scaled between
    0 and 1 using MinMaxScaler. This is an important step as it helps the network
    learn faster and converge with ease. Secondly, the time series is split into training,
    testing, and validation data. The training set consists of the first 80%, the
    testing set consists of the next 10%, and the validation set consists of the last
    10%. Lastly, the training and testing splits are divided into input and output
    components by using the sliding window technique with sequence length 6 for anomaly
    detection models. Table 3. Description of datasets used to train deep learning
    models. 4.5. Implementation We implemented a Generator network to produce fake
    samples. As shown in Table 3, it consists of one-dimensional convolution, LSTM,
    and dense layers with a binary cross-entropy loss function. Binary cross-entropy
    measures the performance of a binary classification model whose output is a probability
    value between 0 and 1. We implemented a Discriminator Neural Network that outputs
    a score for each sample, indicating whether it belongs to the real or fake sample.
    This Discriminator consists of one-dimensional convolution, LSTM, and dense layers.
    To obtain a probability value, a Sigmoid activation function is applied to the
    final layer. We implemented an Autoencoder Neural Network that tries to output
    the same inputs with less reconstruction error. This neural network consists of
    one-dimensional convolution, LSTM, and dense layers, followed by a dropout layer
    to help prevent overfitting. Adam optimization is a stochastic gradient descent
    method based on the adaptive estimation of first-order and second-order moments.
    In our case, we used the Adam optimizer implemented in the Keras/TensorFlow library,
    with a learning rate of 0.001 and β 2 set to 0.5. GAN models are trained for 2000
    epochs with a batch size of 128, and the autoencoder models are trained for 50
    epochs with a batch size of 8. After each epoch, the model is stored on the hard
    drive to select the best model before overfitting occurs. The detailed network
    architecture of the autoencoder model can be found in Table 4, and the detailed
    network architecture of the GAN is presented in Table 5. Table 4. Network architecture
    of AE model. Table 5. Network architecture of GAN model. 4.6. Description of Evaluation
    Metrics After the learning process, the best model was selected and evaluated
    using balanced class validation data that contain 1000 normal and 1000 abnormal
    samples labeled by agronomy experts. Table 6 summarizes the evaluation metrics
    of the anomaly detection models related to soil moisture, air temperature, and
    air humidity. Table 6. Evaluation metrics of anomaly detection models. The metrics
    used for evaluating the anomaly detection models include precision, recall, F1
    score, and accuracy. They are calculated as follows: Accuracy= 𝑇 𝑝 + 𝑇 𝑛 𝑇 𝑝 +
    𝑓 𝑛 + 𝑓 𝑝 + 𝑇 𝑛 Precision= 𝑇 𝑝 𝑇 𝑝 + 𝑓 𝑝 Recall= 𝑇 𝑝 𝑇 𝑝 + 𝑓 𝑛 F1−score=2× 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛×𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙
    𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛+𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 True Positive (TP): represents the number of abnormal samples
    correctly classified as attacks (correct detection). False Positive (FP): represents
    the number of normal samples wrongly classified as attacks (incorrect detection).
    True Negative (TN): represents the number of normal samples wrongly classified
    (correct detection). False Negative (FN): represents the number of abnormal samples
    wrongly classified as attacks (incorrect detection). Accuracy: reports the proportion
    of properly categorized samples to all other samples in the testing set. Precision:
    reports the percentage of samples properly categorized for all TP and FP in the
    testing set. Recall: the ratio of TP samples to the total number of TP and FN
    samples is known as recall. The F1-score reports the harmonic mean between precision
    and recall. 4.7. Results and Evaluation We trained a GAN model on soil moisture
    data for 2000 epochs, with an early stop mechanism implemented to stop training
    if the discriminator and generator losses remained low for 20 epochs. The GAN
    model for soil moisture at 5 cm depth converged at 500 epochs, while the model
    for 20 cm depth converged at 2000 epochs. Autoencoders were also trained for 100
    epochs, with models saved to the hard drive after each epoch. The model before
    the overfitting occurred was selected, with the models at epoch 38 and epoch 20
    being chosen for soil moisture models at depths of 5 cm and 20 cm, respectively.
    According to Table 6, the accuracy of each model ranged from 57.10% to 97.60%,
    while the F1 score ranged from 43.40% to 97.60%. Among the models, AE obtained
    the maximum accuracy and F1 score of 97.60% and 97.60%, respectively, while GAN
    achieved accuracy and F1 scores of 87.50% and 88.88%, respectively. The autoencoder
    error thresholds were set according to the 95% percentile of training data. As
    shown in Figure 9, we chose four-month time-series data from a soil moisture dataset,
    covering the time period from October 2010 to January 2011. Figure 9. Results
    of anomaly detection models on the soil moisture parameter. The GAN anomaly detection
    model identifies many anomalies in the normal behavior of soil moisture sensors,
    which may lead to false alarms for the farmer. On the other hand, the autoencoder
    model only picks up anomalies in the curves’ peaks that result from irrigation
    or rainfall. We trained a GAN model for detecting anomalies in air temperature
    for 3000 epochs and added an early stopping feature that would stop the training
    if the loss for the generator and discriminator remained low for 20 consecutive
    epochs. The training of the GAN model for air temperature in New York was observed
    to converge at 2700 epochs, while the training of the model for Philadelphia converged
    at 1870 epochs. Additionally, we also trained autoencoders for 100 epochs, saving
    the models after every epoch. The model that was trained before overfitting occurred
    was selected, with the models at epochs 95 and 87 chosen for air temperature models
    in New York and Philadelphia, respectively. The error thresholds for the autoencoder
    models were set based on the 95th percentile of the training data. This resulted
    in high accuracy, recall, and F1 scores for the autoencoder models compared to
    the GAN models, with the precision being similar for both. As illustrated in Figure
    10, we selected four-month time-series data from an air temperature dataset, from
    October 2012 to January 2013. The GAN anomaly detection model detects abnormalities
    in the normal behaviour of the air temperature sensor, whereas the autoencoder
    model recognizes the typical pattern of the air temperature sensor and does not
    detect any anomalies. Figure 10. Results of anomaly detection models on the air
    temperature parameter. We trained a GAN model for anomaly detection in air humidity
    for 2000 epochs with an early stopping mechanism in place to stop training if
    the discriminator and generator losses remained low for 20 epochs. The GAN model
    for air-humidity in New York converged at 680 epochs, while the model for Philadelphia
    converged at 1412 epochs. Additionally, autoencoders were trained for 100 epochs,
    and the models were saved after each epoch. The model before overfitting occurred
    was chosen, with the models at epochs 93 and 100 selected for air humidity autoencoder
    models in New York and Philadelphia, respectively. This resulted in high accuracy,
    precision, recall, and F1 scores for the autoencoder models, which performed better
    than the GAN models. The data used in Figure 11 were a four-month time series
    of air humidity from October 2012 to January 2013. The GAN model identifies anomalies
    in the normal behavior of the sensor, while autoencoders recognize the normal
    patterns of the data and detect only a few anomalies. As per the model validation
    results, the autoencoder-based models demonstrated high accuracy and precision
    in detecting anomalies compared to the GAN models. To optimize the models without
    sacrificing accuracy, they were converted using TensorFlow Lite and deployed on
    IoT gateways. An API and a simple web UI were established to configure the anomaly
    error thresholds and alert end users of any sensor malfunctions, as presented
    in Figure 12. Figure 11. Results of anomaly detection models on the air humidity
    parameter. Figure 12. Configuring anomalies and error thresholds in the IoT gateway
    web application. 5. Irrigation Factors Forecasting Using Deep Learning As illustrated
    in Figure 13, the developed system incorporates various microservices, including
    anomaly detection, forecasting, and data analytics, to enhance farmers’ ability
    to make irrigation decisions. These microservices are exposed through the system.
    To provide the farmer with the necessary tools for monitoring and forecasting
    climate and soil measurements, we have implemented a time-series NoSQL database
    to efficiently handle the large volume of sensor data. This type of database is
    particularly well suited for managing time-dependent data and enabling efficient
    manipulation operations. Additionally, it supports auto-scaling capabilities,
    ensuring that the system can handle increased data loads if required. To provide
    accessibility to the system, we have deployed multiple web servers that host web
    applications. Figure 13. Illustration depicting the interaction between end users
    and cloud services within a system. This allows the farmer to access the system
    and its functionalities through a user-friendly interface. To an ensure optimal
    performance and distribution of user requests, load balancers are implemented
    to evenly distribute the incoming traffic across the deployed web servers. In
    the next experiment, we will test the accuracy of the soil and weather forecasting
    models using autoencoders. In the first stage, we will feed the autoencoders’
    anomaly detection models with data from the datasets and replace detected anomalies
    with the reconstructed inputs. The obtained data are structured into sequences
    in the next stage by applying the sliding window approach. This methodology improves
    those observed in previous studies [3,28] when integrated with an IoT platform,
    as a tool for simplifying the labeling of actual anomalies, and can assist in
    the creation of supervised datasets for future research in the field. Prediction
    models based on deep learning techniques can also correct anomalies. We use the
    previous 24 records as inputs and the next 24 as outputs. This technique allows
    us to apply supervised learning to soil and weather parameter forecasting tasks.
    5.1. Forecasting Model for Potential Irrigation Factors Based on the previous
    comparison of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and autoencoders (AEs) for
    finding anomalies, it was found that AEs are more accurate and have a lower rate
    of false alarms. As a result, AE models were chosen for the data collection process.
    This section aims to evaluate the performance of the forecasting models after
    applying data clearing and correction techniques, which are intended to enhance
    the data’s quality and reliability for accurate forecasts. Table 6 shows the architecture
    of the model. This architecture is a sequence-to-vector transformation, where
    the input sequence goes through a series of operations to pull out features and
    capture temporal relationships. This process involves using both convolutional
    and LSTM layers. The convolutional layers extract pertinent features from the
    input sequence, while the bidirectional LSTM architecture processes the input
    sequence in both forward and backward directions, enabling the model to capture
    past and future context simultaneously. Finally, the output of the LSTM layer
    is fed into a fully connected layer for additional processing and to generate
    the final output of the model. This architecture enables the model to effectively
    analyze and understand the input sequence, producing a condensed vector representation
    as the ultimate result. 5.2. Evaluation Metrics of Forecasting Models Based on
    Deep Learning Models When analyzing prediction models of future measurement performance,
    the following metrics are typically used: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Square
    Error (MSE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) are the three most commonly used
    loss metrics to evaluate the performance of DL models related to regression problems.
    They are given as follows: MSE MAE RMSE = ∑ 𝑁 𝑖=1 ( 𝑥 𝑖 − 𝑦 𝑖 ) 2 = ∑ 𝑁 𝑖=1 |
    𝑥 𝑖 − 𝑦 𝑖 | = ∑ 𝑁 𝑖=1 ( 𝑥 𝑖 − 𝑦 𝑖 ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − − − √ 5.3. Results and
    Discussion According to our empirical study, the Adam optimizer from Keras/TensorFlow
    with a learning rate of 0.001 was used for training the CNN/BiLSTM models for
    200 epochs using a batch size of 32. The model was saved after each epoch to pick
    the best model before overfitting occurred. Table 7 displays the in-depth structure
    of the CNN/BiLSTM models. The model inputs a sequence of 24 previous values to
    predict the next 24 subsequent sensor measures. As shown in Table 8, the evaluation
    results for the soil moisture forecasting model are presented for two different
    depth sensors (sm_5 and sm_20). For sm_5, when no anomalies were replaced, the
    model achieved an MSE of 1.2273, an RMSE of 1.1078, and an MAE of 0.999. However,
    a significant performance improvement was observed when 1025 anomalies were replaced,
    resulting in a notable decrease in MSE to 0.272243, RMSE to 0.52176, and MAE to
    0.4703. These findings demonstrate that replacing anomalies positively impacted
    the model’s ability to forecast soil moisture at sm_5 sensors, leading to more
    accurate predictions. In the case of sm_20, when no anomalies were replaced, the
    model yielded an MSE of 1.70128, an RMSE of 1.3043, and an MAE of 1.234. Table
    7. Network architecture of parameter forecasting model. Table 8. Evaluation of
    soil moisture forecasting model. Subsequently, when 716 anomalies were replaced,
    a slight performance improvement was observed, resulting in a reduced MSE of 0.8740,
    an RMSE of 0.9348, and an MAE of 0.861. The decrease in the MSE, RMSE, and MAE
    values indicates enhanced accuracy in the model’s predictions for sm_20 sensors,
    although the improvements were comparatively smaller than those observed for sm_5.
    These results underscore the significance of replacing anomalies in the dataset
    to improve the forecasting accuracy of the model. The improvements achieved for
    the sm_5 sensors demonstrate the substantial impact of addressing anomalies on
    the model’s performance. However, for the sm_20 sensors, the improvements were
    relatively modest, suggesting that anomalies had a lesser effect on the model’s
    predictions in this particular case. According to the results, the autoencoder
    model trained on clean data demonstrated the best forecasting performance, as
    shown in Figure 14. The actual and expected soil moisture were nearly identical,
    with minor discrepancies at the 5 cm and 20 cm depths. Table 9 presents the evaluation
    of an air temperature forecasting model for New York and Philadelphia, considering
    scenarios with and without anomaly replacement. The air temperature model in New
    York, not replacing anomalies, resulted in an MSE of 20.1318, an RMSE of 4.4868,
    and an MAE of 3.497. However, when 1140 anomalies were replaced, the model’s performance
    improved significantly, with the MSE decreasing to 17.7633, the RMSE decreasing
    to 4.2146, and the MAE decreasing to 3.436. This suggests that replacing anomalies
    enhanced the model’s accuracy in predicting air temperature in New York. Figure
    14. Results of soil moisture forecasting models over four months. Table 9. Evaluation
    of air temperature forecasting model. Similarly, for air temperature in Philadelphia,
    the model achieved an MSE of 16.2342, an RMSE of 4.0291, and an MAE of 3.3 when
    anomalies were not replaced. After replacing anomalies, the model’s performance
    improved further, resulting in an MSE of 4.635611, an RMSE of 2.1530, and an MAE
    of 1.648. This indicates that anomaly replacement positively influenced the model’s
    forecasting accuracy in Philadelphia. Overall, the results underscore the significance
    of anomaly replacement in improving the accuracy of the air temperature forecasting
    model, as depicted in Figure 15. The findings demonstrate that addressing anomalies
    led to more precise predictions for air temperature in both New York and Philadelphia.
    As indicated in Table 10, the evaluation results of an air humidity forecasting
    model for two locations are as follows. In New York and Philadelphia, the model’s
    performance was assessed under different scenarios where anomalies were either
    not corrected (corrected anomalies = 0) or replaced using a correction model.
    In the case of air humidity forecasting in New York, the results show that replacing
    anomalies had a minor positive effect on the model’s performance. Although the
    improvements in MSE, RMSE, and MAE values were relatively small, they indicate
    a slight increase in the accuracy of the model’s predictions after anomaly replacement.
    Figure 15. Results of air-temperature forecasting models over four months. Table
    10. Evaluation of air humidity forecasting model. Similarly, for air humidity
    forecasting in Philadelphia, replacing anomalies had a limited impact on the model’s
    performance. The reduction in MSE, RMSE, and MAE values was minimal, suggesting
    only a slight improvement in the accuracy of the model’s predictions. Overall,
    the results indicate that replacing anomalies had a limited influence on the performance
    of the air humidity forecasting model in both New York and Philadelphia, as shown
    in Figure 16. Anomalies may have a relatively small effect on the accuracy of
    the model’s predictions for air humidity in these locations. However, the long-term
    forecast error was significantly high due to various factors that can impact air
    humidity patterns, such as air temperature, air pressure, wind speed, and air
    pollution. After validating the models obtained, they were converted using TensorFlow
    Lite to improve efficiency without sacrificing accuracy and deployed on the cloud.
    An API and web dashboard were developed to display and predict weather and soil
    parameters, as shown in Figure 17. Figure 16. Results of air-humidity forecasting
    models over four months. Figure 17. Estimating irrigation measures using a web
    application accessible online. 6. Conclusions and Future Trends This article introduces
    version 1.0 of the INTEL-IRRIS low-cost and fog-IoT/AI system, developed by the
    University of Oran 1 for SFCs. We present an IoT-based smart farming system that
    integrates anomaly detection based on autoencoders, demonstrating superior performance
    compared to GANs with accuracy rates of 90% for soil moisture, 95% for air temperature,
    and 97% for air humidity. Additionally, anomalies can be adjusted using reconstructed
    inputs from autoencoder models. The results showcase minor estimation errors for
    soil moisture and air temperature hourly forecasting models, indicating the effectiveness
    of our approach. The proposed solution improves the effects observed in previous
    studies and can also assist in creating supervised datasets for future research
    in the field. This platform will need more research that takes into consideration
    several perspectives: To enhance the accuracy of the acquired data, we will increase
    the accuracy of low-cost sensors using autonomous and remotely managed techniques
    to improve the different sensors’ calibration [32]. As a consequence, our water–soil–plant–climate
    interaction models will prescribe more correct measures. To enhance the reliability,
    accessibility, and tracking of sensors and actuators, incorporating a blockchain
    security framework is recommended. This integration will establish a strong mechanism
    for data integrity, availability, and traceability in the system. The design and
    implementation of precision PA-based Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) technologies
    like Lora and Sigfox. These approaches are designed to conserve energy, like the
    Long-Range Wide-Area Network (LoRaWAN), and enhance the irrigation efficiency
    of large-holder farmers. Offer the “out-of-the-box” function, meaning that the
    control component that recommends irrigation is integrated into the IoT gateway
    and, as a result, does not need an internet connection, as implemented by WAZIUP
    partner [27]. Traditional deep learning systems need centralized data gathering
    and processing, which is becoming more unfeasible due to efficiency issues and
    rising data privacy concerns. Due to these qualities, federated learning has been
    a hot topic in smart agriculture. We intend to conduct a comprehensive assessment
    of the FL approach and the centralized machine learning models. Author Contributions

  description: Nowadays, there is contrasting evidence between the ongoing continuing
    and widespread environmental degradation and the many means to implement environmental
    sustainability actions starting from good policies (e.g. EU New Green Deal, CAP),
    powerful technologies (e.g. new satellites, drones, IoT sensors), large databases
    and large stakeholder engagement (e.g. EIP-AGRI, living labs). Here, we argue
    that to tackle the above contrasting issues dealing with land degradation, it
    is very much required to develop and use friendly and freely available web-based
    operational tools to support both the implementation of environmental and agriculture
    policies and enable to take positive environmental sustainability actions by all
    stakeholders. Our solution is the S-DSS LANDSUPPORT platform, consisting of a
    free web-based smart Geospatial CyberInfrastructure containing 15 macro-tools
    (and more than 100 elementary tools), co-designed with different types of stakeholders
    and their different needs, dealing with sustainability in agriculture, forestry
    and spatial planning. LANDSUPPORT condenses many features into one system, the
    main ones of which were (i) Web-GIS facilities, connection with (ii) satellite
    data, (iii) Earth Critical Zone data and (iv) climate datasets including climate
    change and weather forecast data, (v) data cube technology enabling us to read/write
    when dealing with very large datasets (e.g. daily climatic data obtained in real
    time for any region in Europe), (vi) a large set of static and dynamic modelling
    engines (e.g. crop growth, water balance, rural integrity, etc.) allowing uncertainty
    analysis and what if modelling and (vii) HPC (both CPU and GPU) to run simulation
    modelling ‘on-the-fly’ in real time. Two case studies (a third case is reported
    in the Supplementary materials), with their results and stats, covering different
    regions and spatial extents and using three distinct operational tools all connected
    to lower land degradation processes (Crop growth, Machine Learning Forest Simulator
    and GeOC), are featured in this paper to highlight the platform's functioning.
    Landsupport is used by a large community of stakeholders and will remain operational,
    open and free long after the project ends. This position is rooted in the evidence
    showing that we need to leave these tools as open as possible and engage as much
    as possible with a large community of users to protect soils and land.

    operational tools all connected to lower land degradation processes (Crop growth,
    Machine Learning Forest Simulator and GeOC), are featured in this paper to highlight
    the platform''s functioning. Landsupport is used by a large community of stakeholders
    and will remain operational, open and free long after the project ends. This position
    is rooted in the evidence showing that we need to leave these tools as open as
    possible and engage as much as possible with a large community of users to protect
    soils and land. 1 INTRODUCTION 1.1 Background There are numerous means available
    nowadays to challenge land degradation and implement environmental sustainability,
    both in the European Union (EU) and elsewhere. Amongst these are as follows Everyday
    satellites (e.g. USGS-NASA, ESA Copernicus), sensors on board drones and in-field,
    which produce hundreds of terabytes of data that can support monitoring and management
    systems and models for sustainable land use. A large availability of precision
    farming techniques, robotics, omics, biopesticides and nanoparticles which support
    sustainable farming. Stakeholders engaged in research and innovation that lead
    to better-orientated land planning and management. A classic example is the EU''s
    investment of great resources in implementing European Innovation Partnerships
    (EIP) for agriculture and sustainability and, more recently, in Soil Mission Living
    Labs and Lighthouses. Most importantly, there is an increasing number of legislation
    and policy frameworks aimed at achieving a better environment and agriculture
    that preserves natural resources and adapts to climate change (e.g. 7th EAP, FAO
    Agenda, 17 Sustainable Development Goal [SDGs] of 2030 UN Agenda, EU directives).
    Some of this legislation, along with its implementation actions, such as the Nitrate
    Directive (year 1990) and Water Framework Directive (year 2000), has been in place
    for at least 2 decades. It is clear that policies, data and stakeholder engagement
    are in place, but it is also dramatically clear that land degradation is increasing
    and our natural resources are under increasing pressure (Gowdy, 2020, UN, 2022-SDG
    Report) from climate change and land degradation processes. It is also well-known
    that these degradation processes in turn induce biotic stresses, including augmenting
    the population of insects/pests and disease, increasing weed growth, threatening
    pollinators and increasing drought, waterlogging, salinity/alkalinity and abrupt
    rainfall patterns affecting agriculture in a series of ways (Shahzad et al., 2021).
    So how do we tackle all the contrasting issues mentioned above? We argue that
    all the measures in place are simply not enough to produce a change. There is
    still something missing, something that would turn the above three elements (good
    policy, effective data and engaged communities) into operational tools – easy
    to use and freely available to everyone – that would support both (i) the many
    good environmental and agriculture policies that still face huge problems in their
    full implementation (e.g. reports on policies implementation: EU COM2015/120;
    EU COM2013/683) and (ii) positive environmental sustainability actions on the
    part of stakeholders and local communities. 1.2 Aim Here, we aim to demonstrate
    that a free web-based, smart, geospatial decision support system (S-DSS), based
    on GeoSpatial CyberInfrastructure (GCI), could make the difference in connecting
    data, policy and communities engagement. This is in line with this LDD special
    issue which requires the ‘implementation of S-DSS to address the various sustainable
    land uses in different sectors such as in agriculture and forestry’. In the LANDSUPPORT
    S-DSS (www.landsupport.eu), more than 100 operational tools are ready to support
    the implementation of sustainability policies and to assist a wide range of end-users
    for more sustainable land planning and management in agriculture, forestry, spatial
    planning, environmental protection, biodiversity and eco-tourism. This S-DSS brings
    together diverse sources of data (e.g. the EU''s Copernicus satellite and not
    satellite data, climate change data, soil maps, etc.), a large set of models simulating
    reality (e.g. crop growth and pesticide leaching) and a user-friendly graphical
    user interface, with the aim of enabling end-users to access and work on the platform
    easily. We do not aim to provide a literature review of geoSpatial DSSs here,
    but we do wish to highlight the fact that, in recent years, there has been great
    progress towards the development of operational S-DSS tools using similar GCI
    infrastructure applied to for example: Agriculture and forestry applications:
    including irrigation (Bonfante et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2022), olive growing
    (Manna et al., 2020), viticulture (Terribile et al., 2017), forest planning and
    management (Marano et al., 2019; Povak et al., 2020) and crop planning and management
    (Kim & Kisekka, 2021). Environmental protection: including soil conservation (Terribile
    et al., 2015), water contamination (Lan et al., 2020), risk assessment (Kijewski-Correa
    et al., 2020), land take (Langella et al., 2020; Manna et al., 2017) and pesticide
    leaching (Bancheri et al., 2022) and, finally, ecotourism (Mileti et al., 2022).
    A large set of other multidisciplinary studies (S. Wang et al., 2019). The specific
    development illustrated in this paper was carried out as a part of the EU-funded
    LANDSUPPORT project, which brought together 19 partners from 10 different countries
    across Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Following similar approaches of many
    DSS-based papers, we have avoided the usual separation in this specific contribution''s
    ‘Materials & Methods, Results, Discussion’ sections. This choice aims to enable
    easy reading since – due to the complexity and interconnection of platform implementation,
    modelling development and user requirements – each section contains some elements
    overlapping (these may be methods and results) of a specific step which are a
    pre-requisite to the next step. Thus – sequentially – we treated: Implementing
    the aim: key issues The Landsupport platform. This includes (1) the requirements
    (including conceptual needs, required content of each tool and need to optimise
    tools), (2) the architecture of the system (IT infrastructure, dashboard, data
    and model) to implement the tools and (3) test of tools by end users. Three case
    studies (one is given in the Supplementary materials), with their results and
    stats, highlight the platform''s functioning. 1.3 Implementing the aim: Challenging
    key issues To produce operational tools which successfully support sustainability
    in agriculture, environmental protection and their connected policies, a necessary
    prerequisite is to acknowledge, analyse and solve the following key issues, often
    ignored, five specific issues: The embedded, often overlooked, high physical and
    socio-economic multifaceted complexity of the landscape This requires having a
    system that, for any type of landscape, addresses the following: The physical,
    socio-economic, cultural variables and, thus, the trans-disciplinarity context
    of the landscape. Spatial variability and spatial uncertainty of influential geospatial
    variables (e.g. soil and hydrology). Multi-functionalities: the system must deliver
    useful operational results by capturing the deeply diverse multifunctionality
    of any landscape. For instance, this requires having, within one system, outputs
    for agriculture, environment, spatial planning, biodiversity, cultural heritage
    and environmental awareness. Basically, it is fundamental to capture as many dimensions
    of the very same landscape as possible. Site-specific dynamic nature of selected
    key geospatial variables change continuously in time and space. For instance,
    if the system seeks to address dynamic processes such as crop growth and nitrate
    leaching, then it is self-evident that monthly climate data are of little use
    since rainfall varies continuously over time and space. Therefore, it is necessary
    to capture at least the spatial and temporal ‘daily-based’ climate (e.g. rainfall)
    variations. This also applies to many other agriculture and environmental processes.
    Unfortunately, many operational tools dealing with agriculture and environment
    issues still employ highly aggregated datasets (e.g. Himics et al., 2020). For
    instance, Zwetsloot et al. (2021) in identifying synergies and trade-offs when
    choosing different land uses employ climate data obtained from rather coarse scale
    European climatic zones, and in addition they have failed to use soil data (they
    highlight the coarse nature of currently available soil mapping). The lack of
    a truly integrated physical approach to many agricultural/environmental problems.
    Here, there are at least two issues to be considered: The lack of a true integrated
    Earth Critical Zone (ECZ) vision. Even when claiming interdisciplinarity, most
    operational approaches give priority to just one or two of the aspects (climate,
    plant, soil and bedrock) instead of developing a truly integrated ECZ approach.
    This is very unfortunate when dealing with environmental issues since many processes
    (e.g. nitrate leaching) affect the entire ECZ. In addition, soil information is
    often acknowledged in a very simplified way (e.g. no layering, great oversimplification
    of processes, etc.). The need for process-based modelling approaches: in the last
    decades there have been many efforts at modelling to address agriculture and environmental
    issues. These may be schematically separated into empirical versus process-based
    approaches with pros and cons. When dealing with operational tools (e.g. DSS)
    for agriculture and environment, empirical models are by far the most widely employed.
    This is the case when using simple empirical multicriteria models or overlapping
    (as in a typical GIS system) data layers/knowledge about environmental variables
    (vegetation, soil, climate, etc.) to address complex agriculture and environmental
    issues depending on the ‘Earth Critical Zone’ (e.g. primary productivity or groundwater
    vulnerability). Here, we claim that an adaptive approach is required since empirical
    models are indeed essential in many cases (e.g. erosion at landscape scale), but
    process-based models are much more appropriate and powerful when dealing with
    interlinked biophysical processes and ecosystem services, at different temporal
    and spatial scales. In addition, one of the many drawbacks when using empirical
    models of this type of process (e.g. crop growth, water balance) is the very high
    cost of calibration and validation when transferring these models to new areas
    (Manna et al., 2009). To this end, process-based models, being based on superior
    general physical rules, are more replicable to new areas, decreasing the effort
    of new calibrations and validations and, thus, giving much better value for money.
    The lack of factual scientific support (science-based solutions) to both farmers
    and regional governments for achieving both a realistic and performant sustainable
    management of agriculture, forest lands and many other environmental issues. Indeed,
    after many years in which both agriculture and environmental issues have benefited
    from the large availability of data, sensors and supposed tools, most farmers
    and regional governments have acknowledged a lack of support for sustainable management
    and planning activities. For instance, Lundström and Lindblom (2018) highlight
    the fact that most DSS applied to agriculture ‘have not been used appropriately
    in practice’ (Aubert et al., 2012; Eastwood et al., 2017; Rossi et al., 2014).
    Important reasons for this include the fact that developers ‘normally consider
    only technology while the farmer must consider the technology in the whole complex
    situation of practice’. Such a lack of factual sound scientific support also applies
    to the guidance Research and Innovation (R&I) offers to policy makers in the designing
    or increasing the effectiveness of good land management practices (e.g. best practices,
    restoring carbon stocks, etc.) The fragmentation of current approaches, models
    and DSS tools. A large variety of models and DSSs has emerged over recent decades
    (Geertmanand & Stillwell, 2009; Amelung et al. 2020; Manna et al., 2020) but typically
    these have been developed to address specific problems for specific end-user groups.
    Thus, they are of little use for delivering an integrated approach. Figure 1 aims
    to show this critical issue. Here, a number of cars are depicted, each representing
    an example of the many currently available specialised model/DSS systems designed
    to achieve a specific goal (e.g. climate change impact assessment, state of land
    degradation, crop productivity, etc.). FIGURE 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    The figure depicts current fragmentation of models and decision support systems
    (DSSs) approaches. CC, climate change; ES, ecosystem services; LULC, land use
    and land change. It should be extremely important that each of these models/DSSs
    be related to the others, but, unfortunately, this is not the case (the grey roads
    are not interconnected). Indeed, the current scenario is very fragmented and the
    many available models/DSSs systems do not interact with each other. This is not
    surprising considering the great fragmentation of disciplines around landscape
    analysis. Moreover, the majority of already existing models and DSSs is typically
    limited within a specific scale. The difficulties in the implementation of the
    many good policies to improve both the environment and agriculture so that they
    better preserve natural resources and adapt to climate change (e.g. 7th EAP, FAO
    Agenda, 17 SDG of 2030 UN Agenda, EU directives). The evidence of difficulties
    in the full implementation of these policies is reported in many official documents
    (e.g. reports about the implementation of a water framework Dir. COM2015/120 &
    Nitrate Dir. COM2013/683, UN, 2022). It is believed that these difficulties arise
    from the fact that the implementation of much environmental and agriculture legislation
    requires, as a ‘must’, answers which vary in space (over the landscape) and time
    (dynamic). Here, it is necessary to underline the fact that the cause of this
    complexity is often the soils, whose properties vary in space and time (i.e. after
    soil tillage). In Table 1, some requirements, often overlooked, are reported that
    apply when implementing prominent agri-environmental legislation in the EU and
    beyond. TABLE 1. Some important European Union (EU) regulations concerning the
    management of agricultural/forestry and environmental issues (a more detailed

    COM, communication; Dir., directive; Reg., regulation. Thus, this hidden embedded
    complexity makes things rather difficult when considering points 1, 2, 3 and 4
    above. The general problem is that what is required is a full implementation of
    many environmental policies which often require positive actions at a very detailed
    local scale and over very large areas (regions, countries, EU). From our understanding,
    current approaches are not challenging this complexity when addressing policy
    implementation as they offer either a simplistic aggregated view of the problem
    (e.g. NUT aggregation in CAPRI model, Himics et al., 2020) or address the complexity
    through the plethora of Agent-Based Modelling (WoS reports over 80 papers per
    year in only field of agriculture), which indeed produces interesting results
    (e.g. Bestmap https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/817501, Agricore https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/816078
    projects), but, as yet, not enough quantitative, farm-level rooted evidence (Shang
    et al., 2021). In our view, their view of soil-land complexity is very simplistic
    (Brown et al., 2022; Ziv et al., 2020), especially with respect to policy implementation
    which often requires quantitative, spatially-explicit soil-based approaches (e.g.
    EU Nitrate and Water Framework Directives, new CAP). 2 THE LANDSUPPORT PLATFORM
    2.1 Requirements 2.1.1 The need for a novel concept Here, an attempt is made to
    deal with the above issues, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, by overcoming the fragmented approach
    reported in Figure 1 and developing the S-DSS approach (LANDSUPPORT GCI), described
    in Figure 2 as a powerful 4-wheel car which, thanks to its unique engines, is
    able to address (black road) various objectives simultaneously, thus, overcoming
    the current fragmentation of tools and land policy implementation. In this way,
    with very limited investment and using the same infrastructure, it is feasible
    to reach new important additional objectives (e.g. socio-economy evaluation, spatial
    planning, what if modelling, water use efficiency, etc.) on a number of spatial
    scales. All the above is indeed feasible if intrinsic optimisations are achieved
    where the marginal cost of developing each new single engine is low because each
    engine is used for multiple purposes. FIGURE 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Optimisation of the Landsupport geospatial cyber-infrastructure (CGI) approach.
    CC, climate change; ES, ecosystem services; LULUCF, land use and land change forestry;
    S-DSS, geospatial decision support system. For instance, the high cost of developing
    the ‘soil-plant-atmosphere (SPA) agro-hydrologic simulation modelling working
    on high-performance computing (HPC) parallel processing’ is counterbalanced by
    the fact that this model is used for many different issues such as evaluating
    (i) ecosystem services, (ii) farm management, (iii) soil compaction, (iv, v) nitrate
    and pollutant leaching, (vi) food security, (vii) impact of climate change and
    (viii) spatial planning. The same may apply to other modelling engines and, thus,
    the outcome of this approach might represent extraordinarily good value for money.
    Of course, data, model and HPC resources must work in accordance with the geographic
    scales, enabling actions to be tackled on the local scale where the largest multi-beneficial
    agriculture and 2030 SDGs deliveries will be produced while still delivering on
    very large spatial scales. More specifically, our system should enable us to retain
    the following aspects, as depicted in Figure 3: (i) standard Web-GIS features,
    such as easy data updates and a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) and
    (ii) new additional features to be added to standard Web-GIS to enable a GUI to
    deliver multiscale, multi-stakeholder and multi-functionality outputs and permit
    upload of thematic maps by end-users and stakeholders. The latter is the case
    when the user is entering a new data layer (e.g. his/her own Region Of Interest-ROI
    as the focus of the analysis). Eventually, the system must include (iii) a third
    set of features well beyond Web-GIS architectures and philosophy. These refer
    to the use of dynamic databases (e.g. daily update of geospatial satellite or
    climate data) and the demand for ‘on-the-fly’ simulation modelling, as required
    by most dynamic environmental and/or agriculture applications (e.g. primary productivity,
    water balance, pollutant leaching, etc.). FIGURE 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Desired features of the Landsupport decision support system system to address
    current agriculture and environmental sustainability challenges. [Colour figure
    can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] Moreover, for specific applications (on
    the scale of the farm), the system must enable the uploading of soil analysis
    data produced by the farmer (e.g. soil textures) to ameliorate the performance
    of crop growth simulation modelling. In addition, the system requires computing
    codes to be easily updated; this is a crucial issue to ensure system flexibility
    and modularity. Here, we argue that current scientific and technological advances,
    the excellent availability of databases and, most importantly, the vision of the
    responsibility of scientists in leading sustainability (Bouma, 2015, 2020) make
    it possible to move down a new road. These advances are made possible by (i) the
    large availability of geospatial data (maps, satellite, drone, etc.); (ii) progress
    in environmental sciences and adjacent sciences, including digital soil mapping
    (e.g. Chen et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2022; Piikki et al., 2021) and simulation
    modelling of the soil–plant–atmosphere system (Coppola et al., 2019; Penuelas
    & Sardans, 2021; see https://soil-modeling.org/ for a deeper insight); (iii) advances
    in open-source Web-GIS (Tavra & Škara, 2020); (iv) high performance computing
    and, especially, CPU and GPU processing (Badia et al., 2022; Goodman et al., 2019);(v)
    recent developments in building Geospatial-DSS for agriculture and the environment
    built on web-based ‘geospatial cyberinfrastructure’, thus enabling the ‘acquisition,
    storage, management, and integration of both advanced and dynamic data (e.g. pedological,
    daily climatic, and land use), data mining and data visualization, and computer
    “on-the-fly” applications in order to perform simulation modelling (e.g. soil–water
    balance and crop growth), all potentially accessible via the Web’; (vi) new understanding
    of the key issues of transdisciplinarity (Bouma, 2020; Daliakopoulos & Keesstra,
    2020; Terribile et al., 2015) and (vii) the increasing role of multiple stakeholders
    (Maring et al. 2022; Thompson Klein et al., 2001) in co-designing new approaches
    (e.g. EIP. Living labs, EIP AGRI, etc). 2.1.2 The need for operational tools Here,
    we seek operational tools to better implement policies and actions dealing with
    sustainability in agriculture, forestry and spatial planning. In Table 2, we reported
    the main policies we aim to intercept by use of the LANDSUPPORT GCI system and
    also (last column) the list of 15 macro-tools we developed from the letter ‘a’
    to ‘o’ (named macro-tools because each one is composed of many elementary tools).
    The expected achievements and tangible products produced after the use of the
    cited tools to fulfil both the implementation of selected policies and actions
    on various scales are reported in Table 3. TABLE 2. Policies addressed by the

    of rural territories through specific reports and maps designed according to user
    requirements R, L From the analysis of Tables 1–3, it is self-evident that we
    do not seek generic tools on aggregated scales, but rather tools that enable users
    to act at the specific scale of implementation of each policy. For instance, the
    EU Nitrate directive (Dir. 91/676) is indeed pan-European, but its implementation
    is on a regional scale and not on a broader scale. Basically, each EU administrative
    region has to develop (i) its own actions at a local level to lower nitrate leaching
    and (ii) to map (with an update every 4 years) the Nitrate Vulnerable Zones of
    the region. Therefore, the development of a tool (in this case tool ‘j’) to handle
    the Nitrate Directive problems means developing operational tools to support officers
    as they implement points (i) and (ii) to lower the risk of groundwater pollution
    through nitrate leaching. 2.1.3 Co-design the tools Development, testing and engagement
    involved different types of users and their different needs due to the multisectoral
    and multiscale nature of the project. More specifically, each tool was co-designed
    with specific communities of users, which of course varied according to the particular
    tool. This ensured that user requirements were taken on board. The community of
    users involved in the development process were the following: Policy makers at
    local, regional and national levels (e.g. regional administrations, ministries,
    etc.). Farmers associations, cooperatives and consortia. Environmental agencies.
    Researchers (e.g. in the fields of soil, agriculture, environment, urban and landscape
    planning, sustainable development, etc.). Sectoral associations and bodies (e.g.
    food security agency, Chamber of Agriculture). Small and medium-sized enterprises
    (SMEs) (agritourism activities, tourism agencies, environmental guides…); Environmental
    non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and associations. Consultants in several
    LANDSUPPORT-related topics – for example, soil, agriculture, environment, urban
    and landscape planning, sustainable development, and so on. To engage stakeholders
    and end-users, a knowledge transfer chain, depicted in Figure 4, was developed.
    More specifically, knowledge transfer from researchers to end-users was ensured
    using the LANDSUPPORT platform (depicted as mode 1 in Figure 4). While a large
    set of general meetings and face-to-face meetings were organised with many users
    to ensure knowledge transfer from end-users to researchers (mode 2 in Figure 4).
    This required complementary types of knowledge (scientific and practical) and
    needs (challenges, incentives) to be taken into account so as to transform our
    system into concrete opportunities for end-users. FIGURE 4 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint Knowledge transfer in Landsupport. 2.1.4 The need to optimise tools
    To satisfy all very high expectations reported above (Figures 2-4 and Tables 2
    and 3), it is required to equip our system (depicted in Figure 5 as an engine
    to be placed into the LANDSUPPORT 4-wheel car) with a series of special features,
    the main ones of which were the following: (i) Web-GIS facilities, connection
    with all (ii) satellite data (e.g. Copernicus Sentinel), (iii) ECZ data (e.g.
    geology, soil, land use etc.) and (iv) climate datasets including climate change
    (e.g. COSMO-CLM) and weather forecast data (COSMOLEPS), (v) data cube technology
    (rasdaman) enabling us to read/write when dealing with very large datasets (e.g.
    daily climatic data to be obtained in real time for any region in Europe), (vi)
    a large set of modelling engines (e.g. crop growth, water balance, rural integrity,
    etc.) allowing uncertainty analysis and what if modelling, HPC (both CPU and GPU)
    to run simulation modelling in real time and, finally, (vii) a specific module
    to allow the user to insert his/her own data (e.g. soil analysis from his/her
    field) into the system (named as FMIS). FIGURE 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint

    computing. The IT architecture designed to fulfil the above needs is reported
    below in the IT Landsupport description. 2.2 The architecture of the system 2.2.1
    The IT infrastructure Here, we move from a conceptual basis towards the actual
    implementation of LANDSUPPORT taking on-board all requirements reported in Section
    1 and Section 5. The system is built on a GCI platform supporting ‘acquiring,
    storage capacity, management and integration of both static (e.g. hydrogeology,
    soil) and dynamic data (e.g. rainfall, temperature, land use) and “on-the-fly”
    data elaboration and visualisation’ (Terribile et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2010).
    LANDSUPPORT has a 3-tier architecture as depicted in Figure 6: (a) database, (b)
    application server and (c) GUI; all supporting 15 macrotools (Bancheri et al.,
    2022; Mileti et al., 2022). FIGURE 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Architecture
    of the Landsupport geospatial cyberinfrastructure. [Colour figure can be viewed
    at wileyonlinelibrary.com] The database includes both vector and raster data (Table
    4). Vector data include three main types of geometries: points, lines and polygons,
    and are stored in PostgreSQL (open-source license database) and managed using
    the PostGIS extension. Raster data are typically composed of pixel arrays (with
    continuous or discrete values) and are managed through a data cube technology,
    in our case the rasdaman database (Baumann et al., 2021), allowing management,
    storage and recovery of huge multidimensional arrays. TABLE 4. Some of the data

    GUI is given in Figure 7, and it includes a variety of graphical devices and processes
    aiming to combine geospatial data (analysis and visualisation), production of
    outputs as tables and maps, and easy-to-use navigation. The dashboard includes
    three sections: the ‘data viewer’, the ‘map’ (central box) and the ‘analysis tools’
    (left-hand box). FIGURE 7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Scheme of the graphical
    user interface and its different panels. [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]
    The ‘data viewer’ section (left-hand box, Figure 7) includes the ‘Layers’ sheet
    (Figure 7a), which enables the user to navigate through the different thematic
    maps, the ‘Legend’ sheet viewer (Figure 7b) and the ‘Preferences’ sheet (Figure
    7c), where the user can modify the type of visualisation and obtain metadata.
    The ‘Maps’ box (Central box, Figure 7d) displays the maps which have been selected
    from the ‘layers’ sheet. In the Analysis Box (right-hand, Figure 7), there are
    two sections: the ‘toolbox’ (Figure 7e), which enables the end-user to browse
    through the many LANDSUPPORT tools, and the ‘results’ section (Figure 7f), where
    the user can visualise his own results, which have been produced and stored on
    the platform (including the applied model, scale, processing status, etc.). Additionally,
    at the very top of the dashboard, there are some devices (measure distances/areas,
    point locator and draw polygon) that enable the user to draw the ROI he/she is
    interested in and save it within a public (or personal) storage space for use
    it whenever he/she requires. The ROI can also be modified or deleted at a later
    stage. Finally, on the lower right-hand side of the GUI, the user will find the
    specific tool of interest (Figure 7g). 2.2.3 Database The database is connected
    with the 15 macro-tools and typically consists of geo-referenced data and metadata
    from different sources (Table 4). Up to now, LANDSUPPORT stored more than 450
    layers, equally subdivided between raster and vector data. The data are stored
    in different folders according to the scale of application and themes. All stored
    data are reported in the Supplementary material and are available through the
    project catalogue at www.landsupport.eu. Some of these data, such as those found
    in official repositories of a public institution (e.g. ESDAC-JRC, Imperviousness-ISPRA),
    were already available, some were also interoperable (e.g. EU Copernicus); some
    others were held within the local repositories of public institutions (e.g. soil
    type and database of the Marchfeld region, Austria), a few required further processing
    (e.g. population data from Eurostat) and many new data had still to be created
    (soil database integration for the Campania region, Italy). Data are organised
    on the basis of the following: (i) theme area (soil, land use, geology, etc.),
    (ii) data type (vector data such as Corine CLC or raster data as DEM), (iii) spatial
    extension/resolution (European, National, Regional or local) and (iv) data details
    (source and year). Before being integrated into the LANDSUPPORT database, raster
    and vector data were tested for quality and, where required, subjected to up-scaling
    procedures (e.g. coarser resolution data are better for some applications) or
    checked for spatial coordinates, missing data, outliers, etc. and then uploaded.
    Table 4 represents an excerpt from the data layers stored in the database, either
    already available from existing data repositories or created during the project.
    They are include data on soil, geology, land use, morphology, meteorology, biodiversity,
    and so on. To produce some of the tools, it was necessary to generate and harmonise
    a large set of these data. 2.2.4 Models All tools perform a variety of types and
    numbers of processing operations on the ROI selected by the user. This processing
    generates a variety of outputs, ranging from the visualisation of standard maps,
    through the production of tables and graphs, to geospatial functions that enable
    the complex processing required by some of our models. Most of the tools involved
    writing specific codes aiming to produce new models or recompiling and adapting
    existing programme code to fit into our LANDSUPPORT system. Table 5 gives a short
    description of the implemented models, which are at the basis of the 15 tools.
    Each of these models refers to a specific theme, a specific functionality and
    operating mode (e.g. ‘on-the-fly’ or offline mode), the required input and, finally,
    the outputs produced. Models can be organised according to their operating mode
    in the following two types: Static models employ offline processing: one example
    is related to climatic data on a regional scale. This operation allows us to evaluate
    in advance the parameters of linear relationships between temperatures (average,
    minimum and maximum) and altitude, thus allowing easier spatial interpolation
    of temperature (using Postgres/PostGIS table). Dynamic models employ ‘on-the-fly’
    calculations: this is the most commonly used type of model for biophysical processes
    such as crop growth. Using daily climatic data, these models evaluate the climate-soil
    plant dynamics for each day and produce output phenology, yield and many other
    outputs. The latter can be used, for example, to populate PDF reports and graphs
    describing the basic statistics of the output parameters. This data cannot be
    pre-calculated as it depends on the specific ROI designed by the user at the time
    of the query. 2.3 Co-development and testing of the LANDSUPPORT platform Successful
    S-DSS tools indeed require a continuous process of co-development and testing
    of tools by end-users both during and after the release of the different tools.
    This activity has covered all phases of the DSS development process, namely: (i)
    the preparatory phase with needs assessment; (ii) the testing phase and (iii)
    the technical dissemination phase, which was the final step of the process and
    aimed at making the LANDSUPPORT platform known to its potential users and enabling
    them to use the platform through targeted hands-on sessions and training. In our
    case, co-development included different forms of feedback to the developers, depending
    on the issues raised, such as (i) semi-structured interviews, including requests
    and remarks from experts; (ii) e-mails describing problems in using tools and
    (iii) direct interaction with the developers. The feedback activities contributed
    to the co-development and co-creation of the S-DSS tools by identifying the main
    concerns of stakeholders concerning the tools. They also helped to establish a
    direct link between stakeholders and developers. Assessment was made of users''
    judgments that emerged during the interviews regarding performance indicators,
    including interoperability, reliability, relevance for policy needs and overall
    satisfaction with the functionalities (usability and operational capacities) of
    the LANDSUPPORT DSS tools. Here, we report some results: at the country level,
    the total number of institutions involved in the testing process in the three
    pilot countries (Italy, Austria and Hungary) is 55, and 367 people tested the
    tools. By category, the figures are as follows: 32 public institutions were involved
    and 127 people tested the tools. Regarding the actors of agriculture, environment
    and spatial planning, the numbers are 9, 5 and 9 for the institutions and 85,
    106 and 49 for the people. Throughout the duration of the project, 25 workshops
    were organised, involving 877 potential users and other stakeholders at European,
    national and regional levels and on tools belonging to different application areas.
    Throughout the duration of the project, the LANDSUPPORT platform received approximately
    910 registrations and more than 4500 log-ins. 3 CASE STUDIES Some LANDSUPPORT
    case findings have already been published on pesticide leaching (Bancheri et al.,
    2022), groundwater vulnerability to nitrate (Bancheri et al., 2023) and ecotourism
    (Mileti et al., 2022). To highlight the functioning of the platform, we here report
    2 case studies (in addition a third case on Sustainable Land Management [SLM]
    practices is reported in the Supplementary materials) being put to use aiming
    towards sustainable practices and lowering land degradation. These have been chosen
    to cover the different spatial extents: region, country and Europe. Additional
    information on all case studies concerning both the environment (e.g. soil, geology,
    etc.) and local communities (e.g. NUTS4 population trends in the last decade)
    are available in other Landsupport tools (e.g. environmental report tool not explained
    in this paper). 3.1 Crop growth case study 3.1.1 Background The new fair, green
    and performance-based EU Common Agricultural Policy (2023–2027) will be a key
    item in securing a more sustainable future for agriculture and forestry, as well
    as achieving the objectives of the European Green Deal (e.g. combat land degradation).
    This Deal requires each EU country to design a national strategic CAP plan which,
    in addition to many other aspects, has to put into practice enhanced conditionality,
    eco-schemes and farm advisory services, as well as agri-environmental and climate
    measures and investments, to address the Green Deal targets (e.g. Farm to Fork
    Strategy, Biodiversity Strategy 2030). For the best implementation of the strategic
    plans, the planned interventions (e.g. GAEC, SMR) should be designed ‘considering
    characteristics of the areas concerned, including soil and climatic conditions,
    existing farming system, land use, crop rotation, farming practices and farm structures’
    (territorial scope). In this specific scenario, this example case addresses the
    following specific issue: in designing the Strategic Plan in line with the new
    Common Agricultural Policy (2023–2027), a national administrative authority aims
    to test, in a specific region, how different land use management scenarios have
    an impact on three ecosystem services, two of which are critical in terms of lowering
    land degradation: production, filtering capability and carbon sequestration. 3.1.2
    LANDSUPPORT crop growth tool solution ‘Crop Growth’ is a Landsupport tool that
    support the design of the Strategic Plan in line with the new Common Agricultural
    Policy. The ‘Crop Growth’ tool performs crop growth modelling and produces results
    regarding crop yield, so enabling simulation of management scenarios. The tool
    runs, ‘on the fly’, through a model request that allows the user to carry out
    the simulation. The heart of the tool is ARMOSA (Analysis of cRopping systems
    for Management Optimisation and Sustainable Agriculture) process-based crop model
    (Perego et al., 2013; Valkama et al., 2020), which simulates the high level of
    complexity found in those agroecosystem processes which vary in response to agricultural
    management (i.e. crop rotation, intercropping, crop residues management, fertilisation,
    irrigation and tillage) and pedoclimatic conditions. The user has to select the
    ‘Crop Growth’ tool and then he must choose between the following parameters: (i)
    the ROI; (ii) the date (start and end) of simulation; (iii) the crop rotations
    (on the basis of the local site); (iv) conventional agriculture versus organic
    farming (this choice is also associated with type of fertiliser); (v) occurrence
    of cover crop; (vi) irrigation management (either restoring 100% or 80% of crop
    requirement) and (vii) tillage (two options: ploughing at 30 cm depth or tillage
    limited at 15 cm in topsoil with no mixing of soil layers). The user can select
    also the type of output: (i) production (tons ha−1 year−1) of each crop included
    in the rotation (for each simulated year), (ii) mean annual nitrate leaching (NO3–N kg ha−1 year−1)
    at the base of the soil profile and (iii) mean annual change of soil organic carbon
    stock in the 30 cm topsoil layer (% of changes per year). Here, we report an example.
    In a predefined ROI, chosen in the Marchfeld region in Austria, two different

    (2012–2018). Case 1 (organic approach - Table 1): Crop rotation = Clover + Wheat + Soybean + Wheat + Clover + Maize.

    - - - - From the above simulations, the user can obtain a clear quantification
    of the following ecosystem services: (i) crop production, (ii) soil filtering
    (Nitrate leaching) and (iii) C sequestration (SOC variation) capabilities, all
    performed under alternative crop rotations (with vs. without cover crop), fertilisation
    (mineral vs. organic), tillage (ploughing vs. minimum tillage) and crop residue
    management (retained vs. removed). In this specific case, we observe that for
    the same area of 8.4 ha, in the case of raw soil, maize yield is 8.1 tons ha−1 year−1
    in case 1 versus 10.4 tons ha−1 year−1 in case 2; but this increase of 2 tons ha−1 year−1
    in annual production yield has a trade-off in terms of both (i) N leaching, which
    increases from 55.9 kg NO3–N ha−1 year−1 (case 1) to 129.2 kg NO3–N ha−1 year−1
    (case 2) and (ii) annual SOC, which shows an increase of 0.53% for case 1 and
    a decrease of – 0.14% for case 2. This tool was shown to be beneficial for consortia/cooperative
    of farmers and Public Administrations (e.g. Administrative Regions), and for those
    interested in quantifying crop production and connected environmental trade-offs.
    For instance, nitrate leaching and C sequestration in soil maybe be conflicting
    under diverse field management scenarios. In addition, through the tool, the farmer
    can estimate the possible change in the production of currently cultivated crops
    by moving from conventional agriculture to conservation agriculture, and therefore
    reduce production costs over time and improve soil fertility. 3.2 Forestry case
    study 3.2.1 Background Forest ecosystems fulfil and provide crucial functions
    and services to humanity, among which are biodiversity, protection against natural
    hazards and carbon sequestration. The new EU Forest Strategy for 2030 is one of
    the ‘flagship initiatives’ of the European Green Deal and builds on the EU biodiversity
    strategy for 2030. The strategy sets out specific actions to: (i) improve the
    quantity and quality of EU forests and strengthen their protection, restoration
    and resilience; (ii) adapt Europe''s forests to the new conditions (e.g. climate
    change) and (iii) support the socio-economic functions of forests. To achieve
    these targets, calibrated interventions, based on a deep understanding of environmental
    and socioeconomic components, are required. 3.2.2 LANDSUPPORT MLFS tool solution
    Here, we aim to demonstrate the Forest tool named ‘MLFS (Machine Learning Forest
    Simulator)’, which is a decision-making tool designed to understand the dynamics
    of forest development at various scales based on forest inventory data developed
    in the R environment (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MLFS/index.html).
    The tool allows, through simulation, to better understand the impact of forest
    management on forest growth. The latter is quantified through the simulation of
    3 parameters: growing stock (m3 ha−1), basal area (m2 ha−1) and harvested volume
    (m3 ha−1 year−1). The user using the ‘MLFS tool’ will be able, to select between
    the following parameters to be employed by the simulation process: (i) ROI (freely
    drawn or selected from administrative NUTS4 – NUTS3 areas); (ii) year of the simulation;
    (iii) harvesting yield (which represents the simulation of the intensity of forest
    cutting as a percentage); (iv) RCP scenarios (RCP: 4.5 and 8.5 on the basis of
    GHG emissions until 2100); (v) mortality rate (which is made on the basis of local
    conditions) and (vi) thinning rate, affecting future growing dynamics. Finally,
    MLFS supports a wide range of plot-designs and data types and can be applied to
    various forest types, from monocultures to forests with rich species compositions.
    The tool produces two tables as outputs. The first table (given here as Table
    8) reports for each forest plot captured by the ROI, the three parameters discussed
    above, namely: groeing stock, basal area and harvested volume. TABLE 8. Description
    of plots captured by the region of interest. Plot ID Growing stock (m3 ha−1) Basal
    area (m2 ha−1) Harvested volume (m3 ha−1 year−1) 197038 459.74 50.69 9.75 204464
    109.32 14.0 3.13 - - - - The tool will then produce a second table (not reported)
    with the basic statistics (count, mean, min, max, standard deviation, 25% percentile,
    50% percentile and 75% percentile) about growing stock, basal area and harvested
    volume for the entire selected ROI. To highlight the importance of local pedoclimatic
    settings over management practices, we performed a sensitivity analysis using
    the forestry tool. In Figure 8, a boxplot is reported where the numbers identifying
    30 different ROIs (forest plot) of the same size (about 0.1 ha) and circular shape
    are given on the x-axis while the mean of harvested volume (m3 ha−1 year−1) estimated
    for the year 2030, considering all possible combinations of four variables (yield
    harvesting, thinning, mortality and RCP scenario), is reported on the y-axis.
    The 30 ROIs are randomly located within a 457 km2 area of Slovenia, between Trebnje
    (immediately north) and Semič (south-west). For the sake of clarity in reading
    the figure, the ROI was ranked from the lowest to the highest values of harvested
    volume. FIGURE 8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Sensitivity analysis of the
    harvest in the different region of interests (ROIs) (forest plot). [Colour figure
    can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] The horizontal line within the box marks
    is the median value. The box contains the middle 50% of the data points (IQR)
    and is a measure of data variability while the vertical bar for each ROI represents
    the upper and lower fences of the harvested volume based on all combinations of
    the variables. The sensitivity analysis emphasises the existence of sites (e.g.
    sites 18, 24 26, 28, 29 and 30) where changes in yield harvesting, thinning rate,
    mortality rate and RCP scenario have a huge impact on harvest, while there are
    other sites (e.g. ROI 1, 2, 4, 7, 9 and 22) where the impact of the three management
    variables and RCP scenarios have a minimum impact on the growing stock. This tool
    supports different users such as (i) forestry authorities to carry out scenario
    analysis and thus better fine-tune management practices on the basis of specific
    local settings, (ii) scientists interested in the long-term effects of environmental
    factors and climate on forest development and finally (iii) forest professionals
    and engineers, who can use the tool as a decision-making support in their forest
    planning process. 4 CONCLUSION This work starts by acknowledging that the vast
    availability of data (e.g. from satellites, sensors and drones), policies (e.g.
    SDGs, EU environmental policies) and stakeholder engagements (e.g. EIP-AGRI) are
    not enough to have a positive impact on sustainable land management, especially
    considering that land degradation is worsening to a tipping point at which it
    will be difficult or impossible to reverse it. We assert that agriculture, forestry
    and environmental protection require something additional to the information at
    present accessible to address some key shortcomings due to: (i) the great physical
    and socio-economic multifaceted complexity of the landscape and land degradation
    processes, (ii) the lack of a truly integrated physical approach to many agriculture/environmental
    problems, (iii) the lack of factual scientific support for both farmers and regional
    governments so as to support the adoption of sustainable agriculture practices,
    (iv) the fragmentation of current approaches, models and DSS tools dealing with
    agriculture and environmental protection and (v) difficulties in the implementation
    of the many good policies aimed at improving the environment and agriculture.
    Our vision is that robust operational S-DSS are the way forward to translate data
    availability into positive actions towards sustainability thus challenging land
    degradation. This was the starting point of the EU-funded LANDSUPPORT project,
    which brought together 19 partners from 10 different countries across Europe,
    the Middle East and Asia and developed 15 macro-tools (and more than 100 elementary
    tools) by establishing a free web-based smart geospatial decision support system.
    This system is based on Geospatial Cyber-Infrastructure IT architecture applied
    to the better implementation of a large set of EU, national and regional policies
    in the field of agriculture, forestry and the environment. The system brings together
    diverse sources of data including Sentinel satellites (from the EU''s Copernicus
    programme), advanced climate and ECZ modelling, various technologies (e.g. datacube
    and parallel processing) and stakeholder engagement to develop and test the tools.
    All this complexity is ‘hidden’ behind an easy-to-use graphical user interface
    that has been created to enable end-users to easily access and work on the LANDSUPPORT
    platform. Here, we have shown that it is possible to overcome the current fragmentation
    of data and models by combining the following features into a single system: (i)
    a user-friendly GUI where all complexity is hidden; (ii) implementation of the
    concept of the operational multifunctionality of land and soil; (iii) adaptability
    to many different needs of end-users; (iv) implementation of ‘what-if’ modelling,
    so empowering the choices of the end-users (In this sense, we want to emphasise
    here that the system does not aim to provide the ‘solution’, but rather provide
    a set of ‘options’ for the user to choose from); (v) low cost of transferability
    of the approach to new areas and (vi) incorporation of bottom-up contributions
    from users (e.g. uploading of ROI or local soil data). The platform has been demonstrated
    here through three cases dealing with sustainable management practices in agriculture
    and forestry to lower land degradation processes. In the three case studies (one
    is reported in Supplementary materials), this is achieved by producing results
    and stats on sustainable crop growth, forestry and sustainable land management.
    In terms of the future and legacy, the LANDSUPPORT platform will remain operational,
    open and free long after the project ends. This position is rooted in the evidence
    showing that we need to leave these tools as open as possible and engage as much
    as possible with a large community of users if we are to protect soils and land.
    Currently, there is great interest from such stakeholders as public administrators,
    cooperatives, farmer associations, spatial planner associations, natural parks
    and metropolitan areas. Actually, members of the Italian Parliament proposed at
    the Italian Senate a new soil law on the basis of LANDSUPPORT (soil legislative
    bill n. ddl 2614). In addition, the project has received two awards (EU Success
    Story and Falling Walls global winner), which makes it hopeful that a widening
    of use, adoption and scope is welcome and possible. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This paper

  description: The agricultural sector is witnessing a transformative shift with the
    integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, offering innovative solutions
    to enhance crop management practices. This research focuses on leveraging IoT
    for the effective management of diseases affecting onion plants in agriculture.
    By employing a network of sensors, data analytics, and automated control systems,
    this study aims to create a smart agricultural framework that monitors, detects,
    and manages onion plant diseases in real-time. The research begins with a thorough
    investigation into the common diseases affecting onion crops and their associated
    environmental factors. Subsequently, a robust IoT infrastructure is designed and
    implemented, comprising sensor nodes for monitoring soil moisture, temperature,
    humidity, and other relevant parameters. These sensor nodes communicate data to
    a central hub, where advanced analytics and machine learning algorithms analyze
    the information to detect early signs of diseases. In response to disease detection,
    the IoT system employs automated control mechanisms, including precision irrigation,
    targeted application of agrochemicals, and the deployment of environmental control
    measures. The study also explores the integration of remote monitoring through
    mobile applications, allowing farmers to receive real-time alerts and make informed
    decisions promptly. Through field trials and data analysis, the effectiveness
    of the IoT-based disease management system is evaluated, considering factors such
    as disease suppression, yield improvement, and resource efficiency. The research
    also addresses economic considerations and the scalability of the proposed IoT
    framework for widespread adoption in onion cultivation. The findings of this study
    contribute to the advancement of precision agriculture and sustainable farming
    practices, demonstrating the potential of IoT in revolutionizing onion plant disease
    management. As the global demand for agricultural productivity increases, integrating
    smart technologies into traditional farming practices becomes paramount, and this
    research provides valuable insights for stakeholders in the agriculture and technology
    sectors.

  description: The objective of this study is to examine how IoT-enabled intelligent
    irrigation systems can be used in rice agriculture. The study uses sensors to
    gather environmental data in real time, such as temperature, water level, humidity,
    and humidity sensors. Machine learning models, such as artificial neural networks
    (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), decision trees (DT), and random forests
    (RF), are then used to process the data in order to predict future water demand.
    Experimental findings The efficacy of the system indicates, where ANN demonstrates
    the greatest accuracy of 95.6%, followed closely by SVM of 93.2%, DT of 88.7%,
    and RF of 86.5% These performance indicators indicate the robustness and accuracy
    of the model in forecasting environmental conditions for irrigation highlighting
    the positive. The effectiveness of each model is further demonstrated by confusion
    matrices, which provide instances of true positives, false positives, true negatives,
    and false negatives. Achieving a successful integration of IoT and machine learning
    ensures a proactive response to changing field conditions and lowers the risk
    of resource misuse through precise adjustments to the water supply. The results
    emphasise the potential of technology-driven solutions to increase precision agriculture,
    leading to sustainable practices that optimise yields while conserving resources.
    The study offers vital insights for agricultural stakeholders, opening the road
    for flexible and adaptable solutions that solve the problems of contemporary rice
    production in the face of altering climates and global food.

  description: The Internet of Things (IoT) is a technology that empowers the collection,
    transmission, and sharing of data among devices and sensors through internet connections.
    In the context of agriculture and aquaculture, IoT is utilized for monitoring
    and managing various aspects, including environmental conditions, water quality,
    crop health, and product traceability. Its use optimizes agricultural operations
    while reducing losses. On the other hand, artificial intelligence (AI) is characterized
    as a technology that leverages algorithms to analyze data, detect patterns, and
    make data-driven decisions. When integrated with IoT, it imparts a more sophisticated
    dimension to data collection and analysis. In the realms of agriculture and aquaculture,
    this amalgamation of IoT and AI enables more precise and automated management.
    For instance, AI can detect signs of diseases in crops or animals and automate
    tasks like irrigation. Overall, IoT and AI are revolutionizing the agriculture
    and aquaculture sectors by providing smarter and environmentally friendly solutions.
    This combination of technologies contributes to increased productivity, cost reduction,
    and enhanced food security, all while minimizing environmental impact. The paper
    conducted a review of existing challenges and technologies in agriculture and
    aquaculture and formulated forecasts regarding the future development of IoT in
    farming. This holds the capability to reduce labor costs and enhance the efficiency
    of producing higher-quality food.

    empowers the collection, transmission, and sharing of data among devices and sensors
    through internet connections. In the context of agriculture and aquaculture, IoT
    is utilized for monitoring and managing various aspects, including environmental
    conditions, water quality, crop health, and product traceability. Its use optimizes
    agricultural operations while reducing losses. On the other hand, artificial intelligence
    (AI) is characterized as a technology that leverages algorithms to analyze data,
    detect patterns, and make data-driven decisions. When integrated with IoT, it
    imparts a more sophisticated dimension to data collection and analysis. In the
    realms of agriculture and aquaculture, this amalgamation of IoT and AI enables
    more precise and automated management. For instance, AI can detect signs of diseases
    in crops or animals and automate tasks like irrigation. Overall, IoT and AI are
    revolutionizing the agriculture and aquaculture sectors by providing smarter and
    environmentally friendly solutions. This combination of technologies contributes
    to increased productivity, cost reduction, and enhanced food security, all while
    minimizing environmental impact. The paper conducted a review of existing challenges
    and technologies in agriculture and aquaculture and formulated forecasts regarding
    the future development of IoT in farming. This holds the capability to reduce

    The concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) involves a network in which computing
    devices, Items, Automated systems, animals, and humans are linked together. Each
    element is equipped with unique identifiers and has the capacity to effortlessly
    exchange information across a system, eliminating the necessity for direct interaction
    between humans or human-computer engagement [1]. Agricultural IoT is a network
    that connects various physical elements including animals, plants, the environment,
    production equipment, and virtual objects in agriculture. It enables communication
    over the internet using agricultural information sensing devices and specific
    protocols. By enabling effective identification, location, tracking, and monitoring,
    its aim is to ensure intelligent management of agricultural elements and processes.
    The interconnection of \"man-machine-object\" in agricultural IoT enhances the
    management of agricultural elements, processes, systems, and the understanding
    of essential aspects of the lives of animals and plants. Moreover, it facilitates
    the management of agricultural emergencies and complex agricultural systems [2].
    In the agriculture sector, IoT applications play a pivotal role, as depicted in
    Fig. 1. These applications encompass soil monitoring to enhance crop growth, efficient
    irrigation, and fertilizer management. Nutrient optimization is crucial to reduce
    the environmental impact by addressing the soil and plant nutrient requirements.
    Crop monitoring, facilitated by sensors and IoT, supports informed decision-making
    regarding pest control, irrigation, and harvesting. Agricultural product storage
    techniques aid in preserving crops and preventing losses. Smart irrigation improves
    the accuracy of crop watering, reduces water wastage, and promotes sustainability.
    Precision agriculture employs drones and sensors for field mapping and precise
    input application. Finally, IoT automates livestock management, including feeding
    and health data collection. Collectively, these IoT applications enhance agricultural
    efficiency, sustainability, profitability, and global food security [3]. Fig.

    image The utilization of agricultural data hosted in the cloud as digital evidence
    is set to streamline administrative processes in agriculture in the future. Smart
    tractors leverage GPS for precise steering and optimal route planning, reducing
    soil erosion and saving fuel. Farmers now have the ability to gain in-depth insights
    into their fields through the use of agricultural drones equipped with advanced
    sensors and cutting-edge imagery. These sensors also monitor livestock health
    and provide alerts aimed at enhancing dairy production, as depicted in Fig. 2
    [4]. Fig. 2. The Future of Intelligent Farming Full size image The integration
    of the Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence (AIoT) in the field of aquaculture
    has led to the development of smart systems. These systems enhance responsiveness
    and early warnings by monitoring water quality and weather conditions. They have
    the capability to connect their equipment to smart electrical boxes for controlling
    water wheels, pumps, and other power equipment. Utilizing sensors and power data,
    an AIoT system promotes more precise and intelligent aquaculture. This integration
    results in reduced energy consumption, stabilized water quality, decreased labor
    dependency, and precise feeding, ultimately leading to improved aquaculture productivity.
    Furthermore, this approach reduces risks associated with disasters and damages,
    maximizing the benefits of aquaculture. In summary, the IoT and AI significantly
    contribute to the efficiency and sustainability of the aquaculture industry [5].
    The core issue of this study revolves around exploring the opportunities presented
    by current technologies, specifically the (IoT) and (AI), to optimize the integration
    of existing data. This process aims to enhance water quality monitoring, improve
    fish health, ensure more effective environmental management, optimize agricultural
    operations, and streamline fish stock management while bolstering operational
    efficiency within the context of aquaculture establishments in Morocco. The ultimate
    objective of this endeavor is to stimulate an increase in high-quality fish production
    while ensuring the long-term sustainability of the aquaculture industry. This
    must be accomplished in the face of increasingly stringent environmental constraints
    and growing demand. In essence, the fundamental question we seek to answer is
    as follows: How can we optimize the incorporating of IoT and AI technologies with
    existing data to monitor, regulate, and enhance water quality in Moroccan aquaculture
    facilities, all the while increasing the production of quality fish and securing
    the industry''s viability amidst evolving environmental challenges and dynamic

    that meet the specific needs of the agricultural and aquacultural sectors. This
    forward-looking research direction is expected to generate crucial knowledge,
    improved methodologies, and innovative tools, contributing positively and sustainably
    to shaping the future of these industries. 4.2 The Obstacles and Limitations of
    IoT in Farming The agricultural sector faces limitations such as the scarcity
    of natural resources like water and arable land, as well as budget constraints
    for purchasing seeds and agricultural equipment. Additionally, the lack of access
    to advanced agricultural technologies hampers production efficiency, while government
    regulations on land and chemical usage add further restrictions. Seasonal fluctuations
    and unpredictable weather conditions also pose obstacles to production, as does
    the deficiency in training and skills within the agricultural sector, reducing
    productivity. Moreover, the aging rural population limits the available agricultural
    workforce, and the lack of adequate infrastructure, such as roads and product
    markets, hinders crop commercialization. The IoT equipment deployed in farming
    and fish farming are specifically designed to collect meaningful data on various
    environmental and operational parameters. This data is of crucial importance for
    improving agricultural practices, optimizing aquaculture management, and increasing
    crop and livestock productivity. However, despite the potential benefits they
    offer, IoT-based agricultural systems face issues and limitations that need to
    be overcome for broader and more effective adoption. These devices provide valuable
    information on various parameters to enhance agricultural practices and boost
    crop productivity. Nevertheless, they continue to encounter obstacles and limitations
    that must be addressed. The primary challenges hindering the adoption of smart
    agricultural applications include, as depicted in Fig. 5, various types of obstacles
    [20]. Fig. 5. Challenges in the implementation of IoT in smart farming. Full size

    Agricultural practices are rapidly changing in the face of the increasing demand
    for food and water resources. Traditional methods of irrigation have proven to
    be inefficient, causing water scarcity and soil degradation. The concept of aquaponics,
    a combination of aquaculture and hydroponics, offers an alternative solution to
    sustainable agriculture. It utilizes a closed-loop system where fish and plants
    are grown in the same environment, creating a symbiotic relationship where the
    waste from fish is utilized as nutrients for plants, and the plants clean the
    water for the fish. Fish waste is converted into nitrates by bacteria present
    in the soil, which can be readily absorbed by the plants. This system also provides
    the plants with a much more consistent nutrient supply as compared to traditional
    irrigation systems. Experts say that the aquaponic way of irrigation conserves
    as much as 90% of the water that is wasted in traditional irrigation systems.
    It is also observed that plants grow faster in this system because nutrients are
    readily available to them and they do not have to expend energy searching for
    them. Overall, the nutrient-rich, controlled environment of an aquaponics system
    provides the ideal conditions for plant growth, making it a superior option for
    growing plants. The proposed system takes various samples of tap water as well
    as Potheri Lake water with varying differences in pH, turbidity, and water temperature.
    The pH level of lake water can vary widely depending on various factors such as
    the surrounding environment, the presence of aquatic life, and the weather conditions.
    In general, lake water can have a lower or higher pH level than tap water, depending
    on the lake''s distinctive characteristics and the way the local area''s tap water
    is treated. For instance, tap water is usually treated to have a pH level between
    6.5 and 8.5, which is considered safe for human consumption and does not cause
    corrosion in pipes. The naturally occurring presence of suspended particles like
    silt, sand, and algae in lake water can cause it to have a greater turbidity level
    than tap water. 2 Literature Review The hardware design of one system [1] includes
    various components such as sensors, actuators, relays, an Ethernet shield, Arduino,
    and routers. The monitoring of temperature and humidity is accomplished using
    an Arduino microcontroller, an Ethernet Shield, an FC-28 humidity sensor, and
    a DHT11 temperature sensor. A router is utilized to connect the Arduino Ethernet
    to a server. The relay module functions as a control switch for various actuators,
    which respond to the sensor output. The aquaponic box contains several actuators,
    such as two 12V DC exhaust fans, a mist maker, a 5V DC fan, two LED Grow Light
    lamps, and a 12V DC pump [2]. Another system kept track of numerous environmental
    factors, and over time it would be able to control how the farm operated and create
    a fully automated system. Publishers (nodes), brokers (local servers), and subscribers
    (local servers) all communicated via the MQTT protocol, which allows for the use
    of any data type. Monitoring can also be done with the help of a GUI program,
    a communication network, and [3] wireless sensors. A graphical user interface
    is provided by AWSM to address the aforementioned issues. Farmers can get real-time
    notifications and advice about water quality even when they are not there by using
    AWSM''s mobile applications built on IoT technology. When compared to the conventional
    approach, the introduction of the AWSM-based IoT application in the Aquaponics
    system has shown substantial gains. Additionally, it is feasible to [4] investigate
    many characteristics observed by smart systems, IoT technologies, and aquaponics.
    A ZigBee module [5] can be used in place of the Wi-Fi module to broadcast the
    data gathered by the Arduino while also displaying the values on the LCD without
    performing any control actions. A fish tank, a grow bed, and a light panel that
    simulates the sun''s rays for plant growth make up the aquaponics system described
    in [6]. The fish waste provides nutrients to the plants, which in turn receive
    water from the fish tank as a filter. The system makes use of actuators to operate
    the water pump, light panel, heater, and oxygen provider as well as sensors to
    monitor and control pH levels, temperature, and humidity. To direct the actual
    citrus production process, nutrient monitoring [7] in citrus plants can also be
    done in real time according to the soil situation. Another method that primarily
    focuses on finding magnesium and nitrogen deficiencies in image processing [8]
    in MATLAB for the detection of rice illnesses and nutritional deficiencies. A
    Raspberry Pi, a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, and solenoid valves make
    up the hardware employed in this technique. A deep learning method can help in
    the detection of diseases and the prediction of crop growth by utilizing many
    sensors that measure the pH value, temperature, humidity, and water level [9].
    Astute farming is described by the author of reference [10] as the integration
    of a wireless sensor and irrigation system that keeps track of factors including
    soil moisture, nutritional content, and pH levels. A GSM module is used to manage
    the system via wireless communication. 3 Architecture Diagram The proposed system
    shown in Fig 1 comprises two sets of sensors—one for the fish tank and the other
    for the crop soil. The data from these sensors are sent to the Arduino board.
    The Arduino board processes the data and sends it to the NodeMCU Wi-Fi module
    which sends it to the Adafruit cloud platform for visualization and analytics
    [11,12,13,14,15]. The system gathers real-time sensor data from the fish tank
    and crop soil using a variety of sensors, including a soil moisture sensor, temperature
    and humidity sensor, pH sensor, turbidity sensor, and water temperature sensor.
    The physical layer or sensor is made up of this. The data is gathered and transferred
    to the Arduino board regularly. Fig. 1 Architecture diagram of proposed system
    Full size image 4 Methodology The construction of an aquaponics monitoring system
    for effective irrigation is the main goal of the suggested system. The system
    uses a variety of sensors, including a soil moisture sensor placed in a tomato
    plant, pH, water temperature, and turbidity sensors. The irrigation process is
    controlled by the readings from these sensors. Hardware Setup: The hardware setup
    consists of an Arduino board that, via Arduino programming in the Arduino IDE,
    receives data from the sensors. The NodeMCU Wi-Fi module, which is set up to work
    on any internet network, receives the data after that. A personal hotspot or local
    Wi-Fi network was used for this project. The data is sent from the NodeMCU to
    Adafruit.io, a cloud-based platform for IoT data analytics and visualization.
    On this platform, real-time data changes can be tracked and examined. Every 30–45
    s, the sensors update their readings. A CSV file containing the data gathered
    from the Adafruit.io platform can be downloaded. Then, using the downloaded data,
    three classification algorithms—KNN, ANN, and Naive Bayes—are trained and tested.
    To forecast the soil''s irrigation needs, data is analyzed. Jupyter Notebook is
    used to analyze and visualize machine learning. Utilizing visualization techniques,
    the three classification systems are compared for accuracy. The system’s overall
    goal is to create an aquaponics monitoring system that controls irrigation by
    using a variety of sensors. Machine learning algorithms are used to analyze the
    sensor data and estimate the need for irrigation, which can result in more effective
    irrigation and higher agricultural yields. 4.1 Machine Learning Algorithms Used
    KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor). To use KNN, we must first select a value for k, which
    specifies the number of neighbors to take into account. Then, when we have a fresh
    batch of data to categorize, we determine how far away each point in the training
    set is from the fresh data and select the k-nearest points. Finally, we designate
    the class for the new data point as being the one that is most prevalent among
    those k points. Naïve Bayes’ classifier. Based on the Bayes theorem, which quantifies
    the likelihood of a hypothesis given evidence, it is a probabilistic categorization
    model. The term “naive” refers to the assumption made in Naive Bayes that the
    features are conditionally independent of the class. ANN (Artificial Neural Network).
    It is a machine learning model that takes its cues from how the human brain is
    organized and works. It is made up of many interconnected layers of neurons that
    analyze data and produce predictions. The features of the instance to be classified
    are sent to the input layer of an ANN classification model, and the predicted
    class is generated by the output layer. There are one or more hidden layers in
    between that process the input and transmit data to the output layer. The weighted
    total of the inputs is applied by each neuron in the hidden layers using a nonlinear
    activation function. 5 Components Used 5.1 Hardware The proposed irrigation system
    based on aquaponics uses various components to measure and transmit real-time
    data to the cloud platform for visualization and analytics. The sensors used in
    the system are summarized below. Soil moisture sensor (LM393). An electrical tool
    called the soil moisture sensor (LM393) measures the amount of water in the soil.
    It measures the soil moisture using the LM393 comparator integrated circuit and
    outputs a digital signal based on the predetermined moisture threshold. This sensor
    comprises two probes that are put into the soil; as a function of the moisture
    content of the soil, the resistance between the probe changes. Temperature and
    humidity sensor (DHT11). A widely used electrical device that can detect both
    temperature and humidity levels in the environment is the DHT11 temperature and
    humidity sensor. It uses a capacitive humidity sensor to monitor humidity levels
    and a Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) thermistor to measure temperature.
    The sensor sends digital outputs of temperature and humidity data to an 8-bit
    microcontroller through a one-wire protocol. pH sensor and turbidity sensor: A
    pH sensor is an electronic device that determines whether a solution is acidic
    or alkaline. The pH scale, which has a range of 0–14 with 0 being the most acidic,
    14 being the most alkaline, and 7 being neutral, serves as the basis for how it
    functions. The fish tank’s water clarity, which is crucial for fish health, is
    measured by the turbidity sensor. Water temperature sensor. A common sensor for
    measuring the temperature of liquids, including water, is the DS18B20. This sensor
    is a digital thermometer that communicates with other devices via a 1-Wire interface.
    With an accuracy of 0.5 °C in the range of − 10 to + 85 °C, the DS18B20 can measure
    temperatures from − 55 to + 125 °C. Arduino board. Arduino Uno is based on the
    ATmega328P microcontroller. It is an open-source hardware board created for people
    of all skill levels who want to develop a variety of electronic projects. The
    board contains a USB port, a power jack, six analog inputs, an ICSP header, and
    14 digital input/output pins. The Arduino programming language, which is based
    on C/C++, can be used to program the board. NodeMCU Wi-Fi module. The board is
    a great option for IoT applications because it combines the capabilities of a
    microcontroller and a Wi-Fi module. The Arduino IDE or the Lua programming language
    is used to creating programs for the NodeMCU ESP8266 device. Various sensors,
    actuators, and other electronic devices can be connected to the board''s GPIO
    pins. Additionally, it has Wi-Fi connectivity functionality built-in, enabling
    it to connect to the internet and communicate with other devices. A USB cable
    or an external power source can be used to power the board. 6 Implementation The
    sensor data was collected for over a month on an hourly basis. Visualizations
    were created based on the data. The data was also collected in the form of CSV,
    and three different binary classification algorithms were applied to it, namely
    KNN, ANN, and Naive Bayes. The working model of the aquaponic system is shown
    in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 Turbidity, water temperature, and pH sensor along with connections
    Full size image 7 Results The suggested technique gives a thorough strategy for
    effective aquaponic irrigation management. Real-time sensor data visualization
    and analytics offer insightful information on fish and agricultural growth conditions.
    The three machine learning methods’ comparison offers useful insights into effective
    irrigation prediction in aquaponics. For visualization and analysis, the Adafruit
    platform can be accessed on a smartphone, laptop, tablet, or any other electronic
    device that can be connected to the internet. Visualization on Adafruit.io is
    shown in Figs. 3 and 4. Fig. 3 Real-time values of data acquired from sensors

    7.1 Comparing the Accuracy of Various Classification Models The selection of a
    classification algorithm for agricultural data is influenced by the details of
    the data, the resources at hand, and the objectives of the classification activity.
    A standard criterion for assessing a classification model''s performance is accuracy.
    It calculates the percentage of cases in the dataset that were correctly categorized.
    To put it another way, accuracy is the proportion of true positives and true negatives
    in all instances. The model is operating effectively and properly predicting the
    class labels of the instances in the dataset when the accuracy value is high.
    A classification model could be taught to determine whether or not a certain soil
    sample needs irrigation based on its characteristics, such as its temperature,
    humidity, and soil moisture content. In this situation, a classification model
    with high accuracy might be helpful since it can make precise predictions about
    the soil samples’ irrigation requirements. As a result, farmers may be better
    able to decide when and how much to irrigate their crops, which may result in
    the more effective use of water resources and higher crop yields. On comparing
    the accuracy of all three algorithms as in Fig. 5, Naive Bayes was observed to
    have the highest accuracy of 94.12%. This is followed by ANN with an accuracy
    of 91.18% and then by KNN having an accuracy of 88.24. Fig. 5 Grouped bar chart
    for comparison of the accuracy of different models used Full size image 8 Conclusion
    In conclusion, we have presented an irrigation system based on aquaponics that
    utilizes real-time sensor data to monitor and irrigate crops efficiently. The
    system gathers information from a variety of sensors, including soil moisture
    sensors, temperature and humidity sensors, pH sensors, turbidity sensors, and
    water temperature sensors. This information is then processed and instantly displayed
    on the Adafruit platform. Furthermore, we evaluated the performance of three classification
    algorithms, namely KNN, Naive Bayes’, and ANN, for deciding when to irrigate the
    soil. We discovered that ANN had the maximum accuracy, making it the best algorithm
    for our system''s irrigation timing prediction. As a future scope, we plan to
    further enhance our system by incorporating features that will enable the user
    to receive alerts on their mobile device, indicating when the crop needs water.
    We also plan to compare our results with additional classification algorithms
    to identify the best-performing algorithm for our system. Overall, this system
    provides a significant advancement in the automation of aquaponics-based irrigation,
    offering a more efficient, accurate, and sustainable way of managing crops. References

    Agriculture is the scientific practice of cultivating plants and rearing livestock
    to obtain food and other products. It serves as a source of sustenance and provides
    employment opportunities for people. Farmers carefully choose the most suitable
    crop for their land by considering yield comparisons based on price, market demand,
    selling price, cultivation budget, and crop production range [1]. Once the crop
    is selected, the next step in the agricultural process is land preparation, which
    involves adding fertilizer to maintain optimal soil fertility and minimize the
    impact of crop diseases. It also entails designing the irrigation system based
    on the land layout. The subsequent stage is seed selection, which considers price,
    quantity, and water requirements specific to the area. Seed selection aims to
    enhance yield and improve the crop’s disease resistance [2]. The fifth step in
    the crop farming cycle is irrigation, which ensures that the crop receives adequate
    water and is conducted promptly to support growth until harvest. Crop growth is
    a crucial aspect of the farming cycle and encompasses monitoring overall crop
    development [3]. Farmers monitor fertilizer deployment, compare crop growth with
    expected outcomes, and take pre-emptive measures against diseases. The final stage
    is harvesting, which entails harvesting the crop at the optimal time and using
    appropriate methods or machinery suitable for the specific crop type. All these
    steps are vital for cultivating a healthy crop. Traditional agricultural methods
    often neglect the importance of these steps, resulting in suboptimal crop yields.
    Several technologies emerged in agriculture to enhance crop productivity. In this
    work, we propose an IoT-driven approach to optimize the fertilization. 1.1 Fertilization
    Fertilization is the process of applying fertilizers to enrich the nutrient composition
    of the soil. Fertilization plays a vital role in stimulating the growth of crops
    and increasing overall production. Farmers utilize fertilizers to improve soil
    productivity and quality. Fertilizers, whether obtained from natural or synthetic
    sources, can take the form of organic or inorganic substances. Their primary function
    is to be applied to the soil, delivering vital nutrients to plants [4]. These
    nutrients are available in significant amounts or in a form that plants can readily
    utilize. In agriculture, fertilizers are categorized into bio-fertilizers and
    chemical fertilizers [5]. Bio-fertilizers use organic waste and other biological
    agents to enhance soil fertility. At the same time, chemical fertilizers consist
    of the primary nutrients Nitrogen, Phosphorous, and Potassium (NPK) and secondary
    nutrients such as Magnesium, Calcium, and Sulfur. Fertilization Techniques: Numerous
    techniques are employed for fertilization. However, in traditional fertilization
    methods, farmers often lack awareness of the specific nutrient requirements of
    the soil. Consequently, fertilizers are applied without consideration of the soil''s
    nutrient composition. The farmers cannot accurately assess the levels of critical
    nutrients such as Nitrogen, Phosphorous, and Potassium (NPK) in the ground. As
    a result, the quantity of fertilizer applied may lead to either over-fertilization
    or under-fertilization of the area. Issues with existed fertilization techniques:
    Lack of farmer awareness regarding the precise role of fertilizers in crop production.
    Crop damage from excessive fertilizer application affects the plants’ health and
    increases productivity. Time and labor-intensive nature of the traditional fertilization
    methods. Imbalanced soil nutrient levels, particularly with respect to Nitrogen,
    Phosphorous, and Potassium (NPK), leading to compromised crop quality and reduced
    yield. 1.2 IoT in Agriculture IoT, an emergent technology, facilitates the interconnection
    of intelligent devices via the Internet. It creates a global network that links
    various instruments to achieve specific goals [6]. IoT, utilizing multiple technologies,
    enhances convenience and comfort in daily life. Its applications extend to numerous
    fields, including intelligent agriculture [7], smart cities [8], smart homes [9],
    innovative business solutions [10], health care [10], intelligent vehicles, and
    sports and leisure activities [11]. Integrating IoT technology into traditional
    agriculture has increased intelligent agriculture [12]. Smart agriculture employs
    smart control and decision-making devices that enable timely and accurate decision-making.
    This approach ensures efficient resource allocation by supplying water and fertilizers
    based on demand, thereby minimizing resource wastage and maintaining soil fertility
    levels. The adoption of modern techniques in agriculture aims to enhance crop
    quality and production. IoT has transformed agriculture into precision agriculture
    and micro-agriculture [13]. Precision agriculture involves implementing site-specific
    management systems for crops [14]. It focuses on maximizing agricultural output
    while minimizing resource inputs [15]. In precision agriculture, digital technology,
    remote sensing, global positioning systems (GPS), and IoT are utilized to optimize
    farming practices and reduce costs. Smart farming automates various farming tasks
    and reduces the need for human intervention. Traditional agriculture has evolved
    into precision agriculture with the integration of IoT technology [16]. IoT applications
    in agriculture include soil monitoring systems [17], smart farming [18], intelligent
    irrigation systems [19], and the supply of fresh agricultural products [20]. IoT-enabled
    e-agriculture applications effortlessly provide real-time information, benefiting
    rural farmers and reducing human workload. One such application is smart farming,
    which combines agriculture and IoT technologies. Agri-IoT is a framework designed
    to assist farmers by providing timely information about farm conditions and potential
    risks, enabling them to protect their crops from damage [18]. 2 Related Work In
    recent years, the agriculture field has witnessed the emergence of various techniques
    aimed at enhancing productivity and improving crop quality. Several of these techniques
    are discussed in this section. Khelifa et al. have introduced an intelligent irrigation
    system utilizing IoT technology [19]. This system is specifically designed to
    conserve water resources in Algeria and contribute to the country''s agricultural
    economy. Addressing the challenges faced by farmers, Mohanraj et al. have developed
    an automated agriculture field monitoring system [17]. The model encompasses various
    components: knowledge acquisition, comprehension, analysis, knowledge base, and
    the crop selection phase. Lee et al. have introduced an IoT-based agriculture
    production system [21]. In the pursuit of enhancing crop quality and productivity,
    Marie and Rosman have developed a model for detecting NPK levels using an optical
    transducer [12]. Ryu et al. reported an IoT-based connected farm for an intelligent
    farming system [22]. The design incorporates sensors and controllers that utilize
    the Internet via platforms like Cube and Mobius to collect data. With the help
    of a smartphone application, farmers can remotely control various aspects of their
    farm, including water supply, nutrient levels, ventilation, cover usage, and LED
    lighting. Haghverdi et al. have introduced a site-specific water production function
    (WPF) [23]. This system utilizes techniques such as neural networks, k-nearest
    neighbor, and linear regression to design and evaluate the WPF. P and Mahalakshmi
    have proposed an IoT-driven field monitoring and automated irrigation system,
    which is specifically designed for areas with low water levels [24]. Sensors monitor
    the crop field and transmit data to web servers using wireless transmission. Farmers
    receive periodic notifications on their mobile devices, allowing them to monitor
    the condition of their crops from anywhere. To improve soil fertility, Wang et
    al. have introduced a precision irrigation–fertilization controller system [25].
    This system manages the pH concentration by mixing water to maintain the desired
    level. To overcome the challenges related to scalability and compatibility of
    IoT devices, Cambra et al. have introduced a novel IoT-based agriculture monitoring
    system [26]. The system utilizes a service-oriented architecture (SOA) with a
    standardized interface (LoRa by Lora Alliance) for device communication. In farming,
    Bhowmick et al. have introduced an IoT-enabled innovative agriculture application
    [27]. Further, the fertilization issues are resolved using a low-cost IoT-based
    fertilizer notification system [16]. The NPK sensor, designed with colorimetric
    principles using LDR and LED, is connected to a microcontroller unit for NPK value
    analysis. Dewi and Chen have created a decision-making system that relies on IoT
    data collection [28]. This system effectively utilizes IoT devices to gather localized
    data on crucial parameters such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity, water
    level, and light intensity. Das et al. have presented an intelligent agricultural
    system using IoT in India [29]. This system focuses on mitigating crop loss during
    harvesting and post-harvest stages by incorporating several sensors (soil moisture,
    temperature, humidity, E-nose motion, and pest sensors) with the Raspberry Pi
    model. For optimizing fertilizer recommendations, Premashudha and Leena have introduced
    an IoT-enabled solution [30]. The DSS utilizes cloud web GIS servers, mobile applications,
    and kiosk systems. Joshi and Goudar have introduced an IoT-based automated solution
    [31]. This system enables farmers to control electric water motors using their
    Android phones, providing convenience and reducing dependency on electricity for
    irrigation. Pandithurai et al. have presented the digital monitoring of soil and
    crops using IoT in the Agro-Tech system [32]. This system combines IoT applications
    with traditional agricultural techniques. Kamienski et al. have developed an intelligent
    water management system for precision irrigation [33]. Mucherino et al. have incorporated
    data mining techniques into the agricultural field [34]. The k-means clustering
    algorithm is utilized in wine fermentation to group apples into clusters based
    on their growth patterns. It facilitates classification as good or bad for further
    fermentation. 3 IoT-Based System for Fertilizer Detection The proposed model operates
    in three stages: data acquisition, transformation, and analysis. During the data
    acquisition phase, wireless sensor nodes collect information on soil nutrients
    and other fundamental inputs from the fields. Subsequently, the collected data
    is formatted appropriately, incorporating additional details such as crop type
    and time frame, before being transmitted to a remote server. The transformation
    process is tailored to the application and performed using smart devices. Finally,
    data analysis occurs on the remote server, and the resulting insights are communicated
    to the farmer (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 IoT-based model for precision agriculture Full
    size image 1. Data Acquisition: The data acquisition phase encompasses several
    vital operations, including deploying wireless sensor nodes, network configuration,
    and data collection. The first step involves selecting the area for cultivation.
    Subsequently, wireless sensor nodes are deployed in the field, configuring the
    network accordingly. Once deployed, the nodes collect data on primary nutrients
    (NPK) and other external parameters such as temperature, moisture, and pH. The
    collected data is then streamed and made available on the farmer''s smartphone
    for access and monitoring. The soil samples are collected from various regional
    locations to normalize the NPK values. IoT-based wireless NPK sensors are embedded
    in the soil. 2. Data Transformation: The collected data is processed and transformed
    into the appropriate format to meet the application''s requirements. This transformation
    ensures that the data is compatible with the desired analysis or processing tasks.
    Additionally, the data is supplemented with additional inputs such as the type
    of crop, time frame, and any other relevant information. Once the data is appropriately
    formatted and enriched, it is migrated to a remote server or cloud platform for
    further analysis and processing. 3. Data Analysis: The farmer''s request is processed
    at the cloud platform, and a response is generated based on soil nutrient values
    and external parameters’ analysis. The analytic process considers the farmer''s
    input and compares it with the collected data to provide relevant information
    and recommendations. For example, suppose a farmer queries about the fertilizer
    requirements for a specific crop. In that case, the system analyzes the soil nutrient
    values. It provides a response that includes the recommended amount of fertilizer,
    composition guidelines, and suitable temperature conditions for optimal crop growth.
    This response is returned to the farmer, enabling them to make informed decisions
    and take appropriate actions in their agricultural practices. 3.1 Toy Example
    1. Data Acquisition Step 1: Choose the area for cultivation. Step 2: Install and
    configure wireless sensor nodes in the selected area. Step 3: Gather data using
    the deployed sensor nodes (Table 1). Table 1 Acquisition phase data from sensors
    Full size table 2. Data Transformation Step 4: The user determines crop selection
    and time frame, and the collected data is organized and transferred to a cloud
    platform. 3. Data Analysis Step 5: Load the sample values or data into memory.
    Step 6: Set the algorithmic parameters, such as “population size = 10”, “number
    of clusters (Ki = 1)”, and maximum number of iterations = 20, where i = 1, 2,
    … n. Step 7: Select the initial seed point K1 (15.949, 1.718, 13.068, 6.2, 30).
    Step 8: Evaluate the objective function and update the solution. Step 9: Check
    the termination condition. If it is met, stop the process; otherwise, repeat the
    steps. Step 10: Obtain the optimal solution. For example, the optimal solution
    obtained after the 20th iteration is K1 (4.634, 1.57, 4.715, 6.6, 29.30). The
    optimal values (4.634, 1.57, 4.715, 6.6, 29.30) are compared with the predefined
    database values for wheat crops shown in Table 2. Table 2 List of crops with NPK,
    pH, and temperature values Full size table Based on this comparison, the predicted
    amount of fertilizer (NPK) is (5.366, 0.43, 1.2), the variation in pH is 0.1,
    and the suitable temperature is 2.3. The response is then sent back to the farmer,
    suggesting implementing these recommendations in the cultivation area. 4 Conclusion
    and Future Scope This research introduces an approach that utilizes IoT technology
    to create a model for fertilizer detection. The aim is to precisely forecast the
    ideal amount of fertilizer required for cultivating crops. The model consists
    of three main phases: data acquisition, transformation, and analysis. During the
    data acquisition phase, soil nutrient values are collected, while in the transformation
    phase, the collected data is processed and transferred to a cloud platform for
    further analysis. Subsequently, a suitable response is generated and communicated
    back to the farmer. The proposed model effectively addresses common fertilization
    challenges such as over-fertilization, under-fertilization, and nutrient imbalances,
    all while ensuring cost-effectiveness. Future research will focus on incorporating
    additional external parameters like humidity and weather conditions to enhance
    the model’s accuracy. Additionally, the cultivation area will be divided into
    distinct regions, enabling a geographically based analysis to optimize crop quality
    and production further. References Spuhler D, Carle N (2019) Retrieved from https://sswm.info/sswm-solutions-bop-markets/improving-water-and-sanitation-services-provided-public-institutions-0/crop-selection

  description: The utilisation of irrigation, one of the most water-intensive agricultural
    techniques worldwide, has grown in popularity over time. Smart irrigation methods
    are comparatively innovative technologies that improve domestic landscape irrigation
    plans, reducing water usage and potential contamination. The primary determinant
    of agricultural output is soil moisture, and irrigation management depends on
    a precise estimate of this criterion. The decision-making tool for Irrigation
    Schedule Prediction available in Machine Learning (ML) plays a crucial role. The
    drawbacks of traditional machine learning techniques are that they don't predict
    future values, reduce relative error, and decrease the effective estimation of
    soil moisture. To overcome the above-said drawbacks, we proposed a machine learning-based
    SupportTree Algae Algorithm (STAA) to presage soil wetness for smart irrigation.
    Our proposed STAA method consists of a hybrid approach of Support Vector Machine
    (SVM) and Decision Tree (DT)classifier incorporated with Artificial Algae Optimization.
    Our proposed method simulated and achieves 99.5% accuracy, 98.4% precision, 97.5%
    specificity, and 99.2% Sensitivity when compared with existing methods, namely
    Random Forest (RF), Fuzzy Logic, and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN). As a result, a
    novel STAA method ensured better performance concerning Precision, Sensitivity,

    irrigation, one of the most water-intensive agricultural techniques worldwide,
    has grown in popularity over time. Smart irrigation methods are comparatively
    innovative technologies that improve domestic landscape irrigation plans, reducing
    water usage and potential contamination. The primary determinant of agricultural
    output is soil moisture, and irrigation management depends on a precise estimate
    of this criterion. The decision-making tool for Irrigation Schedule Prediction
    available in Machine Learning (ML) plays a crucial role. The drawbacks of traditional
    machine learning techniques are that they don''t predict future values, reduce
    relative error, and decrease the effective estimation of soil moisture. To overcome
    the above-said drawbacks, we proposed a machine learning-based SupportTree Algae
    Algorithm (STAA) to presage soil wetness for smart irrigation. Our proposed STAA
    method consists of a hybrid approach of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision
    Tree (DT)classifier incorporated with Artificial Algae Optimization. Our proposed
    method simulated and achieves 99.5% accuracy, 98.4% precision, 97.5% specificity,
    and 99.2% Sensitivity when compared with existing methods, namely Random Forest
    (RF), Fuzzy Logic, and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN). As a result, a novel STAA method
    ensured better performance concerning Precision, Sensitivity, Accuracy, Relative
    Error, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Square Error (MSE), Mean Squared Logarithmic
    Error (MSLE), and Specificity over existing methods. KEYWORDS: Internet of thingsMachine

    INTRODUCTION India''s population relies heavily on agriculture. The fact that
    61% of India''s land is being used to grow diverse crops to feed the constantly
    expanding population makes the country a top agricultural nation [ 1]. As a result,
    with its significant impact on GDP, agriculture can be seen as the foundation
    of the country''s economy. Water is the most valuable resource for increasing
    agricultural productivity [ 2]. Boosting the efficacy of irrigation methodologies,
    which conventional farmers have utilised for centuries, is essential to augment
    productive capacity per yield [ 3]. Farmers can water their agricultural area
    using two basic techniques: irrigation and rainfed farming. Direct rainfall is
    necessary for rainfed agriculture since it reduces the danger of contamination.
    However, when there is minimal or no rainfall, it leads to poor, inadequate water
    levels. On the other hand, the act of providing water to plants is referred to
    as water irrigation. Smart Irrigation describes the artificial application of
    providing water using various techniques [ 4]. Irrigation is need of agricultural
    outputs. Better and optimally farms are irrigated suitable is the crop yield [
    5]. Surveying the soil''s hydration, temperature, and rainfall, automatic irrigation
    decides when and how often to water and the amount of water to utilise. It is
    essential to have accurate information regarding the wetness level of soil for
    the following reasons [ 6]. In our research, we are concentrating on soil moisture
    for smart irrigation. The main element required for plant growth is soil moisture.
    Water availability affects a crop''s yield. Soil moisture is a solvent and transporter
    for nutritional compounds to promote crop germination. Soil moisture supports
    the chemical and biological processes in soil. The temperature of the soil is
    managed by the flow of water within. The amount of irrigation water applied to
    the crop depends on the moisture content of the soil [ 7]. Various methods have
    been developed in the past for smart irrigation. One of the methods is sprinkler
    irrigation. Sinkler irrigation, often known as water cannons, is still the most
    common type of irrigation utilised in large-scale agricultural settings [ 8].
    Sadly, this method''s cost, duration, and water demand are high. Farmers can also
    employ IoT solutions for agribusiness to narrow the supply-demand disparity by
    guaranteeing good yields, profitability, and ecological sustainability. Using
    IoT, precision agriculture ensures the optimal utilisation of resources to obtain
    greater crop yields and lower operating costs. Precision agriculture''s IoT application
    focuses on handling crop water, pest control, accurate nutrient tracking, and
    securely controlling storage [ 9–11] The advancement of sensors over time can
    be seen in the ability to monitor various criteria from a distance, including
    temperature, pH, humidity, and insightful characteristics like potassium, phosphorous,
    and nitrogen. Using sensors, obtaining data for all dimensions is plausible, which
    is then collected on a network server or in the cloud to be processed. Once sensors
    are interconnected, a network is established that a cloud or backend can reach
    to connect sensor responses from numerous places. [ 12, 13]. With the benefit
    of IoT, the sensor''s data procurement technique can regularly update the data
    collected. Creating a data-driven framework that can roughly estimate the interactions
    among the various data is necessary because the data gathered may contain resemblances,
    natural symmetries, and patterns [ 14]. Machine Learning (ML) is one way to address
    the data-driven methodology. Numerous real-world applications have recently effectively
    used ML techniques [ 15]. The prime aim of ML is to provide prior expertise and
    statistical information to the device to solve a particular issue [ 16]. Figures
    1–3 shows the IoT-based Smart Irrigation Sytem in agriculture, which has many
    advantages, making it possible to implement and use it in various agricultural
    sectors with ultimately quite successful outcomes. These applications include
    crop diagnosis, soil correction, IoT agricultural sensors, irrigation demand,
    and smart greenhouses. Figure 1: Smart sensors for agricultural applications Display

    a motoring station measures the temperature and moisture content of the soil at
    various depths during the plant development stage. [ 17] Display full size This
    research aims to enhance soil wetness projection using an ML strategy for smart
    irrigation. Irrigation can be accomplished efficiently with soil wetness prognostication,
    providing water only when required and reducing water wastage during non-irrigation
    times. Based on the temperature and humidity level of the ambience, it has been
    discovered that ML models can be employed to envisage the soil wetness necessity
    shortly with a high degree of precision. Here are the paper''s contributions:
    ➢ The suggested approach provides an irrigation system that utilises the IoT and
    ensures the implementation of effective irrigation. ➢ The sensor data is initially
    pre-processed, and features are obtained using the Principal Component Analysis
    (PCA). ➢ Then, an ML framework-based Support Tree Algae Algorithm intelligent
    irrigation system is proposed for better soil moisture prediction. ➢ The soil
    data set characteristics are factored in ML-based categorisation to envisage the
    soil wetness level for various classes. ➢ Our proposed method contrasts with prevailing
    methodologies, especially RF, fuzzy logic, and KNN, and is better-considering
    precision, sensitivity, accuracy, RMSE, MSE, MSLE, and specificity. 2. LITERATURE
    REVIEW Machine learning models are an efficient intelligence and-based instrument
    for supporting actions for the sensible and productive utilisation of freshwater
    supplies in precision irrigation. Farmers typically decide whether to irrigate
    their crops according to their prior experiences; however, irrigation choices
    can be crafted more accurately by evaluating the water demand of crops utilising
    soil projections. Prediction is a key component of irrigation planning because
    it enables timely response to better management by allowing early detection of
    water requirements and soil moisture content. Munir et al. [ 17] clever approach
    can employ ontology to make 50% of decisions and a further 50% of choices formulated
    on sensor data values. The final decision, which results from an ML method KNN,
    is derived from the cooperative decision in ontology and sensor value. This method
    reduces latency while avoiding overburdening the IoT server with data processing.
    Blasi et al. [ 18] proffered a smart, automatic watering system that uses the
    DT method. This ML technique prepares the system based on collected data to create
    the module that would be utilised for analysing and estimating the residual data
    irrigation process and providing irrigation water to the optimum range utilising
    AI. Every 10 min, a sensor assesses the soil''s humidity and temperature. Once
    the humidity is at its maximum, the automatic watering process can restrict it,
    and once it is low, it will be allowed. Cardoso et al. [ 19] proffered ML methods
    to estimate the ideal time of day for water application in farmlands. Eliminating
    scheduled irrigation, which invariably leads to surplus water, is the primary
    goal of the research to preserve natural resources. It forecasts the ideal time
    for water distribution based on data that WSN has already collected in agricultural
    fields. Ahmed et al. [ 20] proffered a smart irrigation framework that uses an
    IoT technique to optimise farmland irrigation processes. They created the Raspberry
    Pi 3, a low-cost, credit-card-sized computer equipment designed to directly track
    weather conditions in almost real-time, including relative humidity, air temperature,
    and soil wetness. Hassan-Esfahani et al. [ 21] developed a framework to maximise
    irrigation frequency and minimise yield loss. Local weather data, field observations,
    and accumulated land data have all been used to create a module that distinguishes
    the field condition utilising the soil water balance technique. This technique
    optimised the water allotment module and projected the soil water balance components.
    Akshay et al. [ 22] introduced an effective ML algorithm for intelligent irrigation.
    By detecting ground variables like soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and water
    level, they created an innovative system to forecast a field''s irrigation requirements.
    Amarendra Goap et al. [ 23] created an open-source technique-formulated smart
    mechanism to estimate the irrigation needs of farmland utilising sensors of ground
    characteristics, namely soil dampness, temperature, and ecological circumstances,
    as well as the weather forecast data from the Internet. The sensors used to sense
    weather and land conditions take into account the relative humidity of the crop
    field, soil dampness, soil and air temperature, and UV radiation. This technique''s
    drawback is its expensive system. Akash Reddy et al. [ 24] postulated a fully
    automated Irrigation System, accompanied by a suitable rainfall prognostication
    Algorithm, that could assist in determining which crops are suitable for a given
    region. Romyan''s method, which determines when the motor has to be ON and when
    crops must be watered, is a new technique also presented. Youness Tace et al.
    [ 25] created a sophisticated and adaptable irrigation technique that uses little
    energy and is inexpensive. In a setting that helps promote crop germination for
    months, they utilised a set of sensors (soil humidity, temperature, and rain),
    of which they compiled information predicated on an acquisition map utilising
    the Node-RED platform. MongoDB. Ronaldo et al. [ 26] proffered a prediction of
    soil dampness for smart irrigation. They created a set of rules for machine learning-based
    soil moisture forecast modelling. This strategy is entirely data-driven. Poor
    data quality is this technique''s downside. Nunzia Palmieri et al. [ 27] demonstrated
    a reinforcement learning method for smart irrigation. They created a sensor-node-based
    architecture. They gathered the necessary data using an insightful decision predicated
    on an algorithm for reinforcement learning modelled using a Markov Decision Process
    approach. Ting-Wei Huang et al. [ 28] proffered an ML-based accurate and brilliant
    irrigation system using LoRa P2P networks to understand the irrigation experiences
    of professional farm owners for natural greenhouse crops instantaneously and effortlessly.
    The suggested system determines the water needed for each irrigation session based
    on a skilled irrigation model and environmental parameters, including air and
    soil temperature/humidity, light potency, etc. Then it irrigates the crops instantaneously
    via a long-distance, low-power wireless LoRa P2P network. Gursimran Singh et al.
    [ 29] proffered an ML technique for optimising irrigation water usage in an IoT-driven
    savvy irrigation approach by forecasting soil moisture of a farmland. Future soil
    humidity is prognosticated utilising data from various sensors (air temperature
    and humidity, soil moisture and temperature, radiation) and online weather forecast
    information. John et al. [ 30] proposed a water optimisation method for efficient
    irrigation systems based on IoT and ML. Using multiple metrics and observations,
    they created a hybrid framework for irrigation systems and sound decision-making.
    This work uses KNN, Gradient Boosting-based Trees (GBT), Long Short-Term Memory
    (LSTM), and Spearman''s rank correlation to predict time series. Satvik Garget
    et al. [ 31] demonstrated a Multimodal System for Precision Agriculture based
    on IoT and ML. They created a multimodal smart agriculture system that includes
    smart irrigation, crop disease, and damage prediction to lessen the labour and
    effort required in the agricultural industry. This technique aims to give the
    system access to IoT systems’ theoretical aspects. This method''s high computational
    Complexity is a drawback. An intelligent, adaptable, low-cost irrigation strategy
    that can be used in a variety of situations is recommended by Tace et al. [ 25].
    Machine learning algorithms are the foundation of this strategy for smart agriculture.
    To do this, we employed a set of sensors (temperature, precipitation, and soil
    humidity) in a setting that promotes healthier plant growth for several months.
    We then used the Node-RED platform and MongoDB to gather data from these sensors
    based on an acquisition map. We employed numerous models based on the collected
    data, including Naïve Bayes, SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks.
    With a recognition rate of 98.3% and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.12,
    K-Nearest Neighbors outperforms the other models (LR, NN, SVM, NB), according
    to the results. ICT technologies have great potential in traditional agriculture,
    but there are potential drawbacks when applied to farming methods, as Shaikh et
    al. [ 32] point out. Details on robotics, Internet of Things (IoT) gadgets, machine
    learning problems, and the uses of artificial intelligence, machine learning,
    and sensors in agriculture are provided. Drones are also being considered for
    crop yield optimisation management and crop observation. Global and state-of-the-art
    IoT-based farming platforms and systems are also highlighted where applicable.
    Several issues have been plaguing the agricultural industry due to the unpredictable
    and impactful changes in temperature. Predicting crop growth accurately is an
    important aspect of farm management. Crop output will decrease due to the difficulties
    the agriculture industry faces. Current farmland conditions are necessary to make
    accurate forecasts. Therefore, machine learning techniques are used to analyse
    environmental factors like crop yield recommendation, crop protection, and tailored
    farmer support. The numerous algorithms, including K-NN, Support Vector Machine
    (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Neural Network (NN), are reviewed in detail in
    this study. 3. PROPOSED METHODOLOGY We are focusing on soil wetness prognostication
    in this study because it allows for extremely effective irrigation, offering water
    as required and preventing unnecessary water usage when irrigation is not required.
    Traditional machine learning techniques don''t provide accurate future values,
    relative error, and prediction efficiency of soil moisture. This research aims
    to overcome the drawbacks of the traditional method and predict the soil moisture
    levels with increased prediction efficiency. This segment outlines the research
    technique used for this project. This consists of the pre-processing of the data
    used to establish the soil wetness prognostication framework, the suggested STAA
    configuration, and the predictive irrigation scheduling algorithm configuration.
    The proffered Support Tree Algae Algorithm (STAA) block diagram for predicting
    soil wetness for intelligent irrigation is shown in Figure 4. Firstly, the information
    is gathered from the soil by the temperature, moisture and humidity sensors to
    predict soil moisture in this stage. Next, the collected data undergoes pre-processing
    and feature retrieval stage. Pre-processing and feature retrieval are the principles
    of the Component Analysis method to eliminate redundant data. Then, the extracted
    features are cracked into the training and testing set. Here, 70% of the details
    were utilised to train the classifier. For the next testing, in our proposed method,30%
    of the data was used for testing. Consequently, the Support Tree Algae Algorithm
    (STAA) is proposed to predict soil moisture. The proposed STAA method consists
    of two phases: Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree (DT), Artificial
    Algae Optimization. The training set is given as an input to a hybrid SVM and
    Decision tree classifier. The testing set is provided as an input to Artificial
    Algae optimisation. Here, class labels are predicted using the built-in framework,
    allowing for an estimation of the classification rules’ precision. Finally, the
    proposed STAA method predicts soil moisture based on the classification results.
    After predicting soil moisture, a decision is taken based on soil moisture level
    when to start or stop irrigation (Figure 5). Figure 4: Block diagram of the suggested
    approach Display full size Figure 5: Proposed Support tree algae algorithm Display
    full size The suggested support tree algae algorithm''s steps are as follows:
    Step 1: Load the important data that was gathered by sensors. Step 2: Preprocess
    and extract the data that the sensor collected. Step 3: Split the dataset into
    test and train sets. Step 4: Set up the SVM-DT classifier model initially. Step
    5: fitting the Training Set classifier model to the SVM and Decision-Tree algorithms.
    Step 6: artificial algae optimisation for test result prediction. This optimisation
    algorithm is designed to help us maximise or minimise an error function, increase
    computation time, decrease computation cost, and provide faster convergence and
    better optimum solutions with parameter tuning. Then, depending on the choice,
    begin or stop the irrigation. 3.1. Data Collection The type of soil delineates
    its essence to see its capability to preserve water and wetness, month, that is,
    the planting season, temperature, and morning weather humidity, which is the degree
    of humidity in the early morning. This midnight humidity is the degree of humidity
    in the late afternoon. The noon weather humidity, the degree of humidity in the
    afternoon, and the amount of dampness in the farmland soil are known as soil moisture.
    In farmland, the proportion of salts is known as soil salinity. Evaporation transpiration,
    or the amount of water lost by farmland due to evaporation each month, overall
    daily water use, equals how much water a plant requires to hydrate fully. Initially,
    soil data''s temperature, moisture, and humidity are gathered using the following
    sensors. The moisture content of the agricultural field is determined using Figure
    6 (Moisture level measuring). The moisture level is measured in Figure 6. Figure
    7 illustrates the field data collection device. When creating an intelligent irrigation
    system, soil moisture is a crucial factor to consider. Environmental factors,
    such as air temperature, humidity, UV rays, soil temperature, etc., impact soil
    moisture. The fundamental idea underlying this system''s operation is connecting
    the soil moisture sensor. The sensor measures the moisture content of the soil
    by transmitting data and parameters to the microcontroller, which functions as
    a controller for the pump. The microcontroller notifies the relay module to run
    a pump so that a certain amount of water can be given to the plant if the soil
    moisture content falls below a predetermined threshold. When there is sufficient
    water delivered, the pump shuts off. The purpose of the power supply is to supply
    power to the entire system, and the recommended voltage should be within the micro
    controller''s input supply range, which is 7–12 volts. Sensor readings in this
    system are not considered when the environment changes. Figure 6: Moisture level

    full size 3.1.1. HL-69 Soil Hygrometer Sensor The sensor for the HL-69 Soil Hygrometer
    is shown in Figure 8. We used the HL-69 soil hygrometer moisture sensor [ 17]
    to measure the soil''s humidity. The HL-69 soil hygrometer moisture sensor monitors
    the soil moisture of plants in a tunnel farm in real time. Its primary goal is
    to provide better readings than other soil moisture sensors. The amount of water
    in the soil affects the sensor output voltage. The HL-69 soil hygrometer sensor
    has a few important components. The output voltage rises when the soil moisture
    content is higher and falls when the soil moisture content is lower. The hygrometer
    soil moisture sensor output is an analogue signal, which Arduino must convert
    to a digital format. Two components comprise this sensor: an electronic board
    and two pads measuring the water content. You can find the LM393 comparator chip
    on the electronic board. The HL-69 soil hygrometer sensor''s electronic board
    features a fixed bolt-hole for convenient installation. It has two lights: a green
    light that indicates the digital switching output indicator and a red light that
    indicates the power indicator. Figure 8: HL-69 Soil Hygrometer sensor Display
    full size They employed HL-69 soil hygrometer moisture sensors to calculate soil
    humidity. When contrasted to other soil moisture sensors, the fundamental goal
    for the HL-69 soil hygrometer moisture sensor is to provide an optimised reading.
    The sensors are used to track the soil dampness of plants from tunnel farms in
    the real world. As a result of soil water content, the sensor''s output voltage
    differs. Once the soil was wetter, the output voltage decreased; Anyhow, the output
    voltage increased once the soil was dry. 3.1.2. AM2302 DHT11 Sensor The AM2302
    DHT11 sensor is shown in Figure 9. Figure 9 uses the AM2302 DHT22 Sensor [ 19]
    to measure the temperature and humidity in the air. One popular temperature-humidity
    sensor is the DHT22 sensor which measures the air''s temperature and humidity.
    A thermistor and a humidity sensor combine to form the DHT22 sensors. The following
    are some of the DHT22 sensor''s essential components: The DHT22 sensor is reasonably
    priced. The DHT22 sensor has a 2-5% accuracy range for temperature readings between
    0 and 50% and a 5% accuracy range for humidity readings between 20 and 80%. The
    DHT22 sensor''s input/output voltage ranges from 3 V to 5 V. The maximum current
    used during conversion when requesting data is 2.5 milliamperes. The DHT22 sensor
    has three pins spaced 0.1 apart. Figure 9: AM2302 DHT22Sensor Display full size
    The DHT22 sensor is a regular temperature-humidity sensor employed to determine
    the soil''s relative humidity and temperature. The thermistor and humidity sensor
    are the main components of the DHT22 sensor. A DHT22 sensor''s input or output
    voltage falls between [3, 5 V]. As a result, 1498 records and ten features, including
    sort of soil, month, temperature, morning, midnight and midday weather humidity,
    soil wetness, soil salinity, evaporation, and daily water usage, were collected
    into a table in a CSV file. Then, the collection of the sensor dataset is fed
    into the pre-processing and feature Extraction process. 3.2. Pre-processing and
    Feature Extraction Pre-processing and feature extraction is required to remove
    noisy data and redundant data. In this work, the Principal Components Analysis,
    also known as PCA, is a methodology of statistical analysis that investigates
    the data structure to identify the processes responsible for determining the values
    of the variables contained within a data set. Principal component analysis (PCA)
    generates several linear combinations of observed variables, with each linear
    combination representing a separate component or factor. These factors offer a
    condensed description of the correlation patterns found in the correlation matrix
    and make it possible to recreate the matrix reliably. The benefits of principal
    component analysis (PCA) can be applied to spatial assessment, and they are especially
    helpful in studies of soil complex contamination in historically underrecorded
    areas. This is because PCA allows for a more accurate representation of the spatial
    distribution of variables. In recent years, principal component analysis has seen
    widespread application in the research fields of resource extraction and conservation,
    environmental degradation, and the quantitative evaluation of soil contamination.
    In this investigation, we use a mathematical technique known as principal component
    analysis (PCA) to cut down on the number of variables that might be connected
    while still keeping the vast majority of the data pertinent. This ensures that
    all redundant data is successfully purged from the system. 3.3. Classification
    Using the Proposed Supporttree Algae Algorithm The SVM, DT, and Artificial Algae
    Optimisation phases make up the presented STAA approach. Pattern identification,
    categorisation, and regression assessment are all tasks that can be accomplished
    using SVM, a supervised method. Both linear and nonlinear regression analyses
    can be used. The provided data – set is depicted in a multi-dimensional space
    in which the hyperplane differentiates the data points to the greatest extent
    possible. The inaccuracy is minimised when the data margin distance is high. The
    Random forests method is an ensemble methodology for categorisation and regression.
    Depending on each tree, it can be applied to the sizable collection of DTs that
    supply regression or target class categorisation. The methodology allows using
    a random subset of features and the feature-bagging approach. Since extra trees
    are a collection of different trees, they are closely associated with random forests.
    All of the sample is used for training individual trees, and splitting is completely
    random. Local optimum is substituted with randomness. In most cases, the local
    cut is formulated on the details gained, yet in this case, it is arbitrary. The
    split with the peak value and the required count of nodes are picked. Based on
    this, after the sensor-related data were extracted, 70% of the data were trained
    and fed into the hybrid SVM-DT classifier for further classification in this paper.
    A hybrid tree called SVM-DT typically contains univariate and multivariate nodes.
    Fast univariate decision nodes are used to classify less important data points,
    and SVM nodes are used to classify important data points. Consider D = { ( x u
    , y u ) | u = 1 , 2 , 3 , … . . N } represents dataset, whereas x i denotes input
    and y u indicates outcome. STAA is labelled by: y ( x ) = ω T φ ( x u ) + b +
    e u (1) Whereas ω stands for weight vector, ϕ(xu) specifies the nonlinear function,
    b implicit deviation, and eu signifies appropriate error, an error among the authentic
    trained and calculated results of the data group u. ω and b is gained in the proffered
    STAA method. min J ( w , e ) = 1 2 ω T ω + γ 1 2 ∑ u = 1 N (2) y i = ω T φ ( x
    u ) + b + e u , u = 1 , 2 , 3 … . . N (3) In equation 22, the main part is to
    modify the weight and reduce huge weights, and later, the following part denotes
    training error. The gathered correlation coefficient amongst the features and
    output variables as r ny = p ( x n , y ) (4) The aggregate amongst varying features
    as r nn = P ( x nn , x n ) (5) The group correlation coefficient computing the
    pertinence of the feature subset is provided as follows in equation (6), J ( x
    n , y ) = n r ny n + ( n − 1 ) r nn (6) Assume S1 and S2 express separately the
    linear space by xk and yk. f1⊥, f 2⊥ are quadrature component off 1, f2 and S1,
    S2 respectively. So f 1, f2 can be expressed as: f 1 = ∑ k = 1 N α 1 k φ ( x i
    k ) + f 1 ⊥ (7) f 2 = ∑ k = 1 N α 2 k φ ( y i k ) + f 2 ⊥ (8) where α 1 k and
    α 2 k are the co-efficient vectors of feature space. For optimally resolving issues,
    especially overfitting and local optimal involved in SVM-DT, Artificial Algae
    optimisation is used. The Lagrange function L is determined using the given equation,
    L ( w , b , e , α ) = I ( w , e ) − ∑ u = 1 N α u { ω T φ ( x u ) + b + e u −
    y u } (9) Equation 28αu indicates the Lagrange multiplier and ω indicates penalty
    parameter that evaluates the Complexity of the STAA method like y(x) and trained
    error. Equations (9) are applied to gain the partial derivatives of w, b, e, and
    αu turn into 0, and get an optimisation state. The process has two phases: the
    global and local search space. The formula for the mathematical computation of
    global search is as follows: x j t + 1 = x j t + ( r i 2 ∗ g b − x j t ) f r (10)
    Here x j t is the solution vector xj of the jth term in iteration t and ri is
    a random number. Then gb is the best solution identified among every stage in
    the present. Then, the local search space is indicated as, x j t + 1 = x j t +
    ( r i 2 ∗ x i m − x j t ) f r (11) Here x i m and x j t Are the mth and jth terms
    selected randomly, and when x i m and x j t is considered under the same iteration.
    When x i m and x j t is not considered under the same iteration, a random walk
    may diversify the solution. Any combination classifier called a random forest
    is made by mixing K simple decision trees. Regarding the first dataset, D 1 =
    { ( M 1 , n 1 ) , ( M 2 , n 2 ) , … , ( M w , n w ) } (12) To create the classifier,
    randomly select subsets from the original data sets. ( m j , n j ) ∼ ( M , N )
    . The combined classifier R a ( m ) is then described as R = { R 1 ( M ) , … …
    … R a ( M ) (13) Using the bagging sampling technique, the random forest algorithm
    divides the entire dataset into K-training subsets. The size of each training
    subset is approximately two-thirds that of the entire data, and each sampling
    is random and reincorporated into the sampling. K training subsets are formed
    through bagging sampling, and K decision trees are created. The DT uses the GINI
    coefficient approach to separate nodes. The Gini coefficient indicates the likelihood
    that a randomly chosen sample within a set of samples will be split. In other
    words, the purity of the set is higher when the Gini index is less, and vice versa;
    when the Gini index is smaller, the set is less pure. The Gini index is calculated
    as follows: Gini impurity = probability of sample selection. Gini ( Q ) = ∑ a
    = 1 a Q a ( 1 − Q a ) = 1 − ∑ a = 1 a Q a 2 (14) While is the likelihood that
    the sample will be split, Qa is the likelihood that the selected sample will fall
    within category A. (1-Qa) A sample selected at random may belong to any of the
    A categories in the sample set While recognised as two, Gini (Q) = 2q(1-q) Gini
    (Q), when categorised as two, equals 2Q. (1-Q) There are only two sample sets
    in DT because it is a binary tree. The partitioning features a certain feature
    value in Eq.15 Gini ( D , K ) = | D 1 | | D | Gini ( D 1 ) + | D 2 | | D | Gini
    ( D 2 ) (15) As a result, for a feature with more than two values, the purity
    Gini (D, Ki) of the subset must be determined after the sample D has been divided
    using each value as the dividing point. The least Gini index among all potential
    Gini values is found (D, Ki). This partition''s dividing line is the most effective
    for the sample set D by utilising feature K. Equations (13) and(14) show that
    STAA is trapped by local optima when local search is chosen arbitrarily. The parameter
    ri capacity for local and global adjustments is also constrained. Consequently,
    an alteration is required. Thereby, the new optimal solution is procured by the
    equations followed, Thus, the new equation for global search is estimated as,
    x j t + 1 = w . x j t + ( r i 2 ∗ g b − x j t ) f r (16) The new equation for
    local search is calculated as, x j t + 1 = ( w − 1 ) . x j t + ( r i 2 ∗ x i m
    − x j t ) f r (17) Where w is a weighting coefficient. y j = ∑ t = 1 N α u φk
    ( x j , x u ) + b (18) where k ( x j , x u ) implies the mapping function, which
    is delineated as follows, k ( x j , x u ) = exp ⁡ ( − | | x − x 2 | | 2 2 σ 2
    ) (19) where σ2 indicates kernel variable. Penalty and kernel variables (γσ2)
    are restricted by the precision of STAA methodology. The generalised capability
    of a method could be boosted by decreasing γ, concurrently training error enhances.
    Since the kernel variable is nominal, a high kernel variable results from a lack
    of learning as the model''s complexity increases. Thus, substantial γ and σ2 measures
    are the prime aim for achieving significant productivity. The output of accurate
    prediction from the proposed STAA performs the Smart Irrigation as shown in Figure
    10. Figure 10: Smart Irrigation based on STAA method Display full size Initially,
    the sensors collect the temperature, humidity, and soil (moisture) data to perform
    the smart irrigation. Following that, our proposed STAA provides the accurate
    prediction of water content present in the soil. Thus, the value collected from
    the sensor into soil water level to identify the ideal period to start irrigation
    is developed. Then, the threshold value is set up to perform the process of starting
    and stopping the irrigation. If the soil water level is less than or equal to
    30%, the system output starts irrigation if it stops. 4. RESULT AND DISCUSSION
    4.1. Experimental Setup With the support of the Raspberry Pi and Arduino Uno computing/processing
    and regulation platforms, an effective IoT-based efficient irrigation framework
    has been skilfully established. It includes sensors that consider soil moisture,
    temperature, humidity, and air temperature and a single relay module. When conducting
    the experimental cases, all sensors presented accurate parametric measurements.
    A DC-controlled relay switch connected to a Raspberry Pi is used to manage an
    AC water motor. It has also been demonstrated that the relay can operate the solenoid
    valve. The framework is practical and affordable for making the best use of water
    resources in any agriculture industry. 4.2. Performance Analysis 4.2.1. Confusion
    Matrix A confusion matrix is frequently employed to define the effectiveness of
    a categorisation framework on a set of test data whose true values are recognised.
    The confusion matrix is comparatively easy to comprehend on its own. The system
    confusion matrix, which serves as an assessment procedure for the STAA method
    outcomes, is shown in Table 1 below. Table 1: Confusion matrix Download CSVDisplay
    Table From Table 1 above, we note that the number of predictions which is predicted
    as positive and are positive (True Positive TP) equals (1220) versus only (30)predictions
    that are predicted as negative and are positive(False Positive FP), and the number
    of predictions which is predicted as negative and are actually negative (True
    Negative TN) equals (240) versus only (30) predictions that predicted as positive
    and they are actually negative (False Negative FN), this shows that how this system
    is accurate in being able to predict the needs of plants irrigation based on the
    readings provided by the sensors in proportion up to 98%. 4.2.2. Error-based Prediction
    Classification Analysis for Proposed Model In this section, the error-based prediction
    is analysed through various performance measures employed for assessing this work
    are described in this subdivision. a) Mean Square Error (MSE) The MSE computes
    the average of the squared errors. It denotes the average squared variance between
    the exact and approximated values. MSE is delineated as MSE = 1 n ∑ i = 1 n (
    p i − p ˆ i ) 2 (20) b) Mean squared logarithmic error (MSLE) The MSLE is a proportion
    between the real and anticipated values. As its name implies, it is a subset of
    the MSE. MSME = 1 n ∑ i = 1 n ( ln ⁡ ( 1 + p i ) − ln ⁡ ( 1 + p ˆ i ) ) 2 (21)
    c) Root Mean square error (RMSE) The distinction between values projected by an
    estimator and detected values is known as RMSE and it is depicted as RMSE = 1
    n ∑ i = 1 n ( p i − p ˆ i ) 2 (22) d) Relative error The relative error is the
    proportion between the absolute measurement error and the exact measurement and
    is depicted as, RE = Absoluteerror Truevalue ∗ 100 (23) Table 2 analyses error
    values attained by the proposed method and existing methods regarding RMSE, MSLE,
    relative error and MSE. MSE is the mean of sum of the squared errors. MSLE is
    the squared logarithmic error''s predicted value. The table shows that the MSE,
    RMSE, MSLE, and relative error values obtained by the proffered novel STAA method
    are less than the RF, Fuzzy Logic, and KNN methods. Table 2: Comparision of error
    values Download CSVDisplay Table The Mean Square Error (MSE) of the proffered
    STAA mechanism is shown in Figure 11. Compared to RF, Fuzzy logic and KNN, the
    proposed STAA method has a low MSE value of 0.50. Figure 11: Comparision of MSE
    of the proposed method with existing methods Display full size The resulting RMSE
    graph for varied methodologies is depicted in Figure 12. The graphical representation
    shows that the presented approach yields RMSE error values that are lesser than
    those of the emerging methodologies. The RMSE of the STAA is 0.30, and that of
    the RF, Fuzzy logic, and KNN are 0.69,0.63,0.64, respectively. Figure 12: Comparision
    of RMSE of the proposed method with existing methods Display full size The MSLE
    resultant graph for different methodologies is shown in Figure 13. The presented
    technique''s MSLE error values are less than those acquired by the emerging methodologies,
    such as Random Forest (RF), Fuzzy logic, and KNN, according to the graphical representation.
    The MSLE of the STAA is 0.33 and that of the RF, Fuzzy logic, and KNN are 0.72,0.68,0.69
    respectively. Figure 13: Comparision of MSLE of the proposed method with existing
    methods Display full size The final relative error graph for multiple methodologies
    is shown in Figure 14. According to the graphical representation, the relative
    error values achieved by the suggested mechanism are lesser than those procured
    by the existing techniques, such as Random Forest (RF), Fuzzy logic, and KNN.
    The relative error of the STAA is 0.29, and that of the RF, Fuzzy logic, and KNN
    are 0.65, 0.62, and 0.60, respectively. Overall, a framework is deemed to be beneficial
    if the projection system''s error rate is low. Thus, Soil moisture projection
    using the suggested framework is effective. Figure 14: Comparision of relative
    error of proposed method with existing methods Display full size 4.2.3. Performance
    Analysis of Prediction-based Classification The metrics-based classification accuracy
    is analysed in this section. The following metrics values are taken to analyse
    the performance of the proposed model accuracy. a) Sensitivity The proportion
    of true positives to true positives and false negatives is utilised to determine
    sensitivity. The equation describes it as follows. Sensitivity = tp tp + fn (24)
    b) Accuracy The proportion of accurate prognostications to all input samples is
    known as accuracy. It is written as the equation follows. Accuracy = tp + tn tp
    + tn + fp + fn (25) c) Precision Precision is the ratio of accurate beneficial
    outcomes to the count of beneficial outcomes prophesied by the classifier. It
    stands out as being below the equation Precision = tn + fn tn + tp + fp + fn (26)
    d) Sensitivity The number of true positives that the classifier correctly acknowledges
    as positives is known as sensitivity. The equation followed serves as its definition.
    Sensitivity = tn tn + fp (27) Where tp,tn,fp, and fn represent the sum of a true
    positive, false positive, true negative and false negative. Table 3 demonstrates
    the productivity evaluation of the suggested mechanism for predicting soil moisture
    utilising an ML classifier. Table 3: Comparison of evaluation parameters Download
    CSVDisplay Table Figure 15 shows the achievement evaluation of the suggested mechanism
    for predicting soil moisture utilising an ML classifier. First, RF accomplished
    a 70.3% accuracy rate. Then, the KNN classifier attained an accuracy of 82%. Additionally,
    Fuzzy logic attained an accuracy of 85%. Finally, the proposed STAA method achieved
    an accuracy of 99.5%. It shows that our proposed method performs better than existing
    methods such as Random Forest (RF), Fuzzy logic, KNN. Figure 15: Comparision of
    the accuracy of the proposed method with existing methods Display full size Figure

    soil moisture utilising an ML classifier. First, RF had a 55% accuracy rate. Then,
    the KNN classifier attained a precision of 89%. Additionally Fuzzy logic attained
    the precision of 90%. Finally, the proposed STAA method achieved a precision of
    98.4%. It shows that our proposed method achieves better performance than existing
    methods, such as Random Forest (RF), Fuzzy logic, and KNN. Figure 16: Comparision

    17 demonstrates the efficiency assessment of the suggested technique for predicting
    soil moisture utilising an ML classifier. First, RF attained a 42.4% sensitivity.
    Then, the KNN classifier attained a specificity of 62%. Additionally, Fuzzy logic
    attained a specificity of 64%. Finally, the proposed STAA method achieved a specificity
    of 97.5%. It shows that our proposed method achieves better performance than existing
    methods, such as Random Forest (RF), Fuzzy logic, and KNN. Figure 17: Comparision
    of specificity of proposed method with existing methods Display full size Figure
    18 depicts the effectiveness assessment of the suggested mechanism for predicting
    soil moisture utilising an ML classifier. First, RF attained a 44.6% specificity.
    Then, the KNN classifier attained a sensitivity of 78%. Additionally, Fuzzy logic
    attained a sensitivity of 65%. Finally, the proposed STAA method achieved a sensitivity
    of 99.2%. By making this contrast, we evaluate various techniques in estimating
    soil moisture since STAA outperformed other classifiers, such as Random Forest
    (RF), Fuzzy logic, and KNN. Figure 18: Comparision of sensitivity of proposed
    method with existing methods Display full size 4.3. Discussion The accuracy of
    the estimated soil moisture level determines how intelligent the suggested system
    will be. The hourly field data for air temperature, air humidity, soil moisture,
    soil temperature, and UV are gathered for three weeks to confirm the accuracy
    of the soil moisture prediction algorithm. The hourly data for the three weeks
    has been averaged out daily, and the 21 days’ worth of data has been split into
    training and testing sets, with 70% and 30% of the data, respectively, to apply
    the suggested STAA algorithm. Table 1. shows the matrix of confusion. In this
    case, the predicted “Yes” value, “1220,” is greater than the predicted “NO” value,
    “30.” The error measure values for the Random forest, fuzzy logic, KNN, and the
    suggested STAA method are shown in Table 2, along with metrics like MSE, RMSE,
    MSLE, and relative error. Compared to other existing methods like Random Forest,
    Fuzzy Logic, and KNN, the proposed STAA method has very low error measure values.
    For KNN, the error measure values are 0.78 MSE, 0.64 RMSE, 0.69 MLSE, 0.60 relative
    error, and for the proposed STAA method, they are 0.50 MSE, 0.30 RMSE, 0.33 MLSE,
    and 0.20 relative error. The evaluation parameters, including accuracy, specificity,
    sensitivity, and precision, are shown in Table 3. In comparison to the other methods
    currently in use, the proposed STAA method has higher evaluation parameters (Table
    4). Table 4: Comparison table(advantage/disadvantage) Download CSVDisplay Table
    Modern industries use expensive automation and control equipment that is unfit
    for agricultural settings. Farmers can minimise human intervention and maximise
    water usage by using smart irrigation systems to reduce wastage. This will help
    society deal with water scarcity. From this point of view, we have also developed
    an affordable smart irrigation technology that benefits the farmers more. The
    suggested model turns off when the field is wet/ required watering is completed;
    thus, the energy is saved effectively. The system turns on automatically when
    the field dries, thus the formers can save the plants without plant loss. 5. CONCLUSION
    Water provision in agribusiness is significant and has a top importance since
    agriculture is the highest water-consuming industry, and owing to the pivotal
    scenario of inaccessible water supplies, focus must be given to the problem of
    water needs of crops and planning the proper irrigation to spread the correct
    methodology in smart irrigation management and successfully handover to farmers.
    This paper aimed to design a smart irrigation system that is more beneficial to
    the formers and is cost-effective and helps reduce plant loss. The approach used
    in this paper helps the user to achieve an economical farming setup that will
    improve both the quantity and quality of their harvest. This paper suggests using
    ML and an IoT-based method to make irrigation more effective. Three stages make
    up our suggested methodology: pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification.
    The Support Tree Algae Algorithm is postulated for intelligent irrigation to forecast
    soil wetness. The proposed methods performs two phases: SVM-DT and Artificial
    Algae Optimization. Based on the classification results, the suggested STAA method
    predicts soil moisture. The decision of when to begin or stop irrigation is made
    after the soil moisture level has been predicted. The Artificial Algae Optimization
    Algorithm (AAA) in the proposed STAA model is designed to increase computation
    time and decrease computation cost while offering faster convergence and better
    optimum solutions with parameter tuning. The proposed STAA method provides higher
    accuracy, precision, sensitivity and specificity than existing methods. The MSE,
    RMSE, MSLE and relative error are lower in proposed novel method than existing
    methods such as RF, Fuzzy logic and KNN. This analysis shows that the suggested
    STAA Algorithm is a good fit for estimating soil moisture content. It is possible
    to increase agricultural production and improve accuracy based on the soil moisture
    level. This paper suggests a contemporary approach to farming that is also reasonably
    priced. When it comes to affordability and simple system modelling, farmers can
    benefit greatly from an Internet of Things (IoT)-based smart irrigation system.
    This paper gathers a few fundamental and necessary agricultural data points, compares
    them to threshold datasets that have been pre-set, makes decisions, and then implements
    the preferred course of action. The aim of this paper was to design a smart irrigation
    system. The approach used in this paper helps the user to achieve an economical
    farming setup that will improve both the quantity and quality of their harvest.
    A user can improve their own agricultural systems’ efficiency with the aid of
    the generated results. In the future work, extensive experiments will be conducted
    on real crops and analyse the resulting data using machine learning to obtain
    useful recommendations. A comparison can be performed with the traditional irrigation
    systems in terms of water consumption, moisture level in soil, humidity and the
    quality of crops to ensure the effectiveness of the proposed model. Moreover,
    the system can be adapted to consider more environmental data by adding different
    types of sensors. Disclosure statement No potential conflict of interest was reported

  description: The irrigation sector in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) confronts
    a range of obstacles, such as scarce water resources, the elevated salinity and
    alkalinity of irrigation water, inefficient irrigation practices, and inter-sectoral
    competition for water resources. These challenges have led to diminishing agricultural
    yields and abandonment of arable lands. Internet of Things (IoT)-based irrigation
    systems present a promising remedy for these issues. By curbing water wastage
    and ensuring precise water delivery to crops, IoT-based irrigation systems offer
    a viable solution to the challenges entrenched in traditional irrigation methodologies
    in KSA. However, the widespread implementation of an IoT-based Smart Irrigation
    System (I-SIMS) poses a multifaceted and intricate challenge in KSA. This study
    is focused on the identification of the factors and challenges through a systematic
    review and ranking of the challenges/factors that exert a significant influence
    on the adoption of I-SIMS. Ranking aids in determining the importance of various
    alternatives. It enables locating the best options that support the required objectives
    in complex decision situations. The study employs both Grey Relational Analysis
    (GRA) and Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) methodologies to prioritize these
    factors. The study’s conclusive findings indicate that among the challenges, technical
    expertise and security measures emerge as the foremost concerns that demand attention.

    University, Jazan, Saudi Arabia The irrigation sector in the Kingdom of Saudi
    Arabia (KSA) confronts a range of obstacles, such as scarce water resources, the
    elevated salinity and alkalinity of irrigation water, inefficient irrigation practices,
    and inter-sectoral competition for water resources. These challenges have led

    IoT-based Smart Irrigation System (I-SIMS) poses a multifaceted and intricate

    predominantly arid country with no permanent bodies of water and has the third-highest
    per capita intake of fresh water (Dinar and Donoso, 2020). The widespread agricultural
    programs Reilly et al. (2023) and freshwater have exhausted non-renewable groundwater
    and degraded the quality of water. There is a significant amount of waste in both
    the urban and agricultural sectors. In addition to this, due to limited rainfall,
    major groundwater aquifers in Saudi Arabia have been depleted. Although the total
    amount of freshwater produced in Saudi Arabia increased from 17.5 million cubic
    meters in 2010 to approximately 24 million cubic meters in 2016, the percentages
    of water produced from different sources remained relatively constant, as shown
    in Supplementary Figure 1. KSA figures as one of the most water-scarce countries
    around the globe. With a hot and arid climate, limited rainfall, and a rapidly
    growing population and economy, the limited availability of water resources, the
    demand for water has far exceeded the available resources. One of the major challenges
    that KSA faces is irrigation, due to its limited water resources and inefficient
    irrigation techniques, which is critical for sustainable agriculture and food
    production (Dinar and Donoso, 2020). These challenges have been discussed in several
    recent studies (Ghanim, 2019; Shankar, 2019), highlighting the need for innovative
    solutions to address water scarcity and promote sustainable agriculture. The traditional
    flood irrigation method, which is still widely used in KSA, is highly inefficient
    and wasteful, leading to water loss through evaporation and runoff (Dinar and
    Donoso, 2020). The demand for irrigation water Singh et al. (2023) has increased
    over the years due to population growth (Rambo et al., 2017), expansion of agricultural
    activities, and increasing urbanization. Groundwater reserves, which are the primary
    irrigation water source, are rapidly depleting also due to over-extraction and
    inefficient use (Chowdhury and Al-Zahrani, 2013). The consequences of these challenges
    are evident in the form of reduced crop yields and the abandonment of agricultural
    lands. The salinity and alkalinity of irrigation water further aggravate the situation,
    negatively impacting crop growth and quality, while also contributing to soil
    salinization and degradation. Outdated irrigation practices, including the lack
    of modern technologies like drip irrigation, add to the inefficiency of water
    usage. With the country’s population and economy expanding, the competition for
    water resources among the agricultural, industrial, and domestic sectors is intensifying,
    necessitating a well coordinated method to water management. The government has
    thus implemented various policies aimed at enhancing water resource management,
    such as promoting the utilization of treated wastewater for irrigation (Dinar
    and Donoso, 2020). However, the high upfront cost and lack of technical expertise
    limit the adoption of modern irrigation techniques like drip irrigation. Furthermore,
    the swift urbanization and industrialization in KSA are exacerbating the scarcity
    of water resources, leading to heightened competition among various sectors. To
    address these challenges, efforts have been made to develop a comprehensive water
    transmission system. However, the existing backbone is not up-to-date, even degrading
    in many areas. Furthermore, approximately 20% of the water that is distributed
    is unaccounted for (Dinar and Donoso, 2020). The kingdom of Saudi Arabia faces
    multifaceted challenges in the irrigation sector and requires a comprehensive
    approach that addresses water scarcity, salinity, inefficiency, and competition
    between different sectors. Efforts to promote sustainable agriculture, improve
    water use efficiency, and invest in modern irrigation technologies are crucial
    for ensuring the country’s food security and sustainable water management. Automated
    farming systems utilize various types of data, such as soil moisture content,
    temperature, rainfall, and wind speed profiles within indoor covered agriculture
    farm sheds (Ratnakumari and Koteswari, 2020). This data is collected and stored
    in a computer server to provide insights into climate prediction, soil conditions,
    and disturbance analysis. By utilizing these data archives, farmers can effectively
    monitor and analyze the conditions of their crops, which can improve the overall
    efficiency and productivity of their farming operations. Moreover, IoT-based irrigation
    systems (Shankar, 2019) can also mitigate the impact of water salinity and alkalinity
    on crop growth and quality. These systems can measure and control soil salinity
    levels, thereby ensuring crops receive the appropriate nutrients and minerals
    and also help address the competition for water between different sectors in KSA.
    By optimizing water utilization efficiency in agriculture, these systems can free
    up water resources for other sectors, such as urban and industrial use. Consequently,
    IoT-based irrigation systems offer a promising solution to the challenges faced
    by irrigation in KSA. By optimizing water use efficiency, improving crop yields,
    and reducing soil salinization and degradation, these systems can contribute to
    the long-term sustainability of agriculture in the country. However, identifying
    and ranking the challenges for the adoption of I-SIMS is a complex decision problem.
    When resources like time, money, or manpower are scarce, ranking facilitates efficient
    resource allocation. Ranking helps to maximize the effect of your decisions within
    the limits by concentrating resources on the options that received the highest
    rankings. High-ranked options are often those that fit the goals best and are
    more likely to produce successful results, reducing potential hazards. Despite
    its initial adoption several years ago, KSA has yet to fully adopt an IoT technology
    for efficient irrigation management due to numerous factors. To facilitate this
    adoption, a detailed analysis of the challenges shall be conducted. This includes
    identifying and ranking these challenges to determine which ones are most significant.
    Principal approaches such as GRA (Ju-Long, 1982) and AHP (Ayağ and Özdemir, 2007)
    (Rajesh and Ravi, 2015) can be utilized to determine the priority of these challenges.These
    approaches are both useful resources for making decisions and resolving issues
    in a variety of sectors. These approaches are both useful resources for making
    decisions and resolving issues in a variety of sectors. When dealing with systems
    or issues where data is scarce, ambiguous, or imprecise, GRA is highly useful.
    It works well in situations where incomplete data can prevent traditional quantitative
    analysis from producing reliable conclusions. GRA is excellent at contrasting
    numerous options across various aspects. Even in the absence of appropriate data,
    it aids in the discovery of patterns, trends, and correlations between variables.
    By organizing the decision-making process by dividing complex situations into
    a hierarchy of criteria and sub-criteria, AHP offers a systematic framework for
    decision-making. The advantages of both techniques can be combined to produce
    a more thorough and informed decision-making process with reference to Saudi Arabia.
    The ranking of the alternate factors is significant to achieving the goal of adopting
    I-SIMS by addressing each challenge one by one based on the order of ranking obtained
    using GRA/AHP. The decision problem can be organized using AHP, which can also
    identify the criteria and determine their relative weight. In order to effectively
    handle uncertainty and compare options, GRA can then be used within each criterion.
    This hybrid strategy takes advantage of both GRA’s capacity to handle complicated
    and ambiguous data and AHP’s quantitative prioritization. The goal of using GRA
    and AHP for smart irrigation in Saudi Arabia includes raising agricultural production,
    supporting sustainable agricultural practices, and better managing water resources,
    which shall assure effective water distribution, reduce waste, and encourage water
    conservation. These approaches can aid in selecting the most important challenges
    and enable KSA to move towards a successful and significant implementation of
    an I-SIMS. Smart irrigation systems that are dependent on measurements like evapotranspiration,
    are becoming more popular to enhance efficiency and timeliness compared to conventional
    irrigation methods. There has not been a significant study that addresses the
    KSA decision-problem for smart irrigation. This study will open the door for further,
    in-depth research into this and other KSA-related decision issue domains. Machine
    learning (ML), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and deep learning (DL), like
    the models used in Ghaderzadeh et al. (2022); Habib et al., 2023; Humayun et al.,
    2021; Jabbari et al., 2023; Ju-Long, 1982; Jyoti Deogirikar, 2017; Kabak and Dağdeviren,

    Ghaderzadeh (2014), are often used to implement state-of-the-art proposals, such
    as machine vision techniques for guessing parameters of importance, such as humidity.
    Moreover, fuzzy logic is commonly mentioned in the literature associated with
    ML, ANNs, and DL, especially when fuzzy logic systems are used in irrigation control.
    In this paper, firstly a discussion of related work is done in Section 2. Then
    an overview of the Challenges in IoT implementation in KSA is done in Section
    3, followed by a detailed proposed methodology in Section 4 as well as the algorithms
    including GRA and AHP, followed by the results. In Section 6, the conclusion is
    provided and suggestions for further work. 2 Related work To address these challenges
    of depleted groundwater reserves, which are the primary source of irrigation water
    in KSA and inefficient irrigation techniques, such as flood irrigation, which
    result in significant water loss, recent literature (Habib et al., 2023) has emphasized
    the need for innovative solutions, such as I-SIMS, to improve water use efficiency
    and promote sustainable agriculture. Several studies have highlighted the potential
    benefits of I-SIMS in KSA. For example, the researchers found that the use of
    an IoT-based irrigation system resulted in a significant reduction in water usage
    and improved crop yields in a pilot study done in KSA (Habib et al., 2023). IoT-based
    irrigation systems can help to overcome the challenges of water scarcity and salinity
    in KSA by optimizing irrigation scheduling and reducing water loss. A comprehensive
    approach was urgently needed to achieve sustainable agriculture in KSA, as proposed
    by (Ghanim, 2019). An array of short- and long-term measures were taken in this
    approach. To begin the integrated solution, the effective management of existing
    non-renewable resources was implemented to safeguard the deep aquifer in delicate
    regions. To achieve this, the use of these resources was restricted solely to
    the provision drinking only and agricultural purposes was prohibited. Additionally,
    implementation of advanced water-saving techniques for irrigation, along with
    the cultivation of low-water requirement crops, and the enhancement of agricultural
    and irrigation practices resulted in significant reductions in agricultural water
    consumption. Increasing irrigation efficiency from 47% to 65% could result in
    saving more than 3 billion m3 per year. The second step in the overall solution
    involved creating new water resources using both traditional and non-traditional
    methods. To increase water availability, the utilization of treated wastewater
    was considered. It was important to note that treated wastewater was an essential
    component for irrigation in critical regions of KSA where the deep ground water
    aquifer was alarmingly low due to excessive use. Additionally, the development
    of rain-fed agriculture and more effective water collection practices were highly
    recommended in the country’s southwestern part, specifically on the deserted terraces
    of the AI Sarawat mountains and along the Red Sea coasts. These areas received
    annual runoff water from nearby and moderately damp mountains, which could be
    harnessed through appropriate infrastructure and management techniques. The authors
    in (Shankar, 2019) designed a smart irrigation system powered by Raspberry Pi
    and utilizing IoT technology. The system automatically controlled the water motor
    and tracked plant growth by utilizing a webcam. By connecting to a WI-FI network,
    the live stream of the farm could be accessed through a mobile phone application.
    The authors in (Quasim, 2021) covered a variety of topics including market size,
    notable IoT players, market predictions, academic considerations, overall architecture,
    opportunities, and challenges. The authors noted that the public’s openness to
    adopting new technologies and the desire for a technologically advanced society
    were positive factors for the successful implementation of IoT-based systems in
    Saudi Arabia. The researchers in (Rawal, 2017) presented a system that involved
    the development of an automated irrigation system that ensured the soil’s desired
    moisture content was maintained through automatic watering. The control unit was
    created using a microcontroller (ATMEGA328P) on the Arduino Uno platform. Sensors
    were used to read moisture levels of soil which in turn was used to extrapolate
    the adequate amount of water necessary for irrigation. Furthermore, IoT technology
    was integrated to keep farmers updated on sprinkler status. The sensor data was
    frequently updated on a web page through a GSM-GPRS SIM900A modem, allowing farmers
    to check whether the water sprinklers are ON/OFF in real time. The authors in
    (Campoverde et al., 2021) presented a suggestion for an irrigation system that
    utilized IoT technology. The system utilized sensors and hardware platforms like
    Raspberry PI and Arduino to facilitate irrigation methods on farms. The water
    pumps used for irrigation were controlled by two crucial factors: soil moisture
    and evapotranspiration. To predict the adequate water levels necessary for the
    plants, RL was used in tandem with an MDP. This method helped in the reduction
    of water and energy needs. The proposed system was analyzed and compared to a
    traditional irrigation system that used a soil moisture threshold to make decisions.
    The experiments conducted demonstrated that the proposed method could save both
    water and energy. The study conducted by (Vallejo-Gómez et al., 2023) provided
    a systematic review using a modified version of the PRISMA 2020 approach to identify
    important aspects related to smart technologies used in irrigation systems. The
    review emphasized, as shown in Supplementary Figure 2, that there was a recent
    increase in research on smart technologies for irrigation system control and modelling.
    The authors suggested that this research area had great potential for further
    contributions. The review also found that embedded systems were generally used
    to implement smart irrigation systems. IoT-based systems are frequently used in
    smart irrigation systems due to their simplification in usage and data exchange
    between devices, which makes data collection and monitoring easier. It is important
    to mention that implementing and adopting an I-SIMS requires identifying and ranking
    of the challenges. Numerous studies have explored the use of AHP, GRA. Notably,
    (Kaya and Kahraman, 2010) employed fuzzy VIKOR and AHP methods for identifying
    the optimal energy source and energy manufacturing locations in Istanbul. The
    authors in (Chang, 2015) utilized MCGP to determine the ideal plant types, locations,
    and other criteria for the expansion of the renewable energy industry. The researchers
    in (Kabak and Dağdeviren, 2014) proposed an approach using BOCR and ANP to evaluate
    Turkey’s energy position and rank renewable energy parameters, taking both tangible
    and intangible challenges into account. The authors in (Zografidou et al., 2016)
    applied a 0-1 weighted GP model to develop the best design for a renewable energy
    production network in Greece, incorporating social, environmental, and economic
    criteria. The authors in (Atmaca and Basar, 2012) focused on evaluating the correctness
    of inplace and future power plants in Turkey. 3 Challenges To analyse and identify
    irrigation difficulties/challenges in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), a defined
    procedure for gathering and analyzing pertinent literature on the subject was
    followed. The question “What difficulties do irrigation techniques in the Kingdom
    of Saudi Arabia face?” provided insights into the factors that affect irrigation
    in KSA. By using relevant keywords and synonyms connected to irrigation, IoT and
    Saudi Arabia, many relevant publications and ideas were highlighted. use of pertinent
    institutional repositories and academic databases (such as PubMed, Web of Science,
    and Scopus) aided in finding most of the studies done in this domain. Reviewing
    the titles and abstracts of the search results also helped narrow down the choices.
    Many irrelevant papers were eliminated. Finally, a quality assessment verified
    the validity and reliability of the studies that were included. 3.1 Resources
    searched The process of selecting appropriate resources for conducting a Systematic
    Literature Review (SLR) is crucial. In our case, we opted to utilize five widely
    recognized digital libraries that primarily catalog publications in the field
    of computer science. These libraries served as our primary sources for identifying
    all relevant literature pertaining to our research inquiries. 1. Scopus: (www.scopus.com),
    2. (IEEE: ieeexplore.ieee.org), 3.MDPI: (www.mdpi.com), 4.Springer: (www.springer.com),
    5. Google Scholar: (scholar.google.com) and 6. Frontiers Library (https://www.frontiersin.org/).
    3.2 Constructing search string The search query was designed based on three fundamental
    concepts: “KSA,” “water,” and “irrigation” as shown in Table 1 Our search string
    is formed by combining different variations of these three keywords using the
    Boolean operators “AND” and “OR”. table 1 Table 1 Search expressions. 3.3 Article
    selection process In Supplementary Figure 3, the comprehensive procedure for searching
    and identifying pertinent publications is illustrated. Initially, we formulated
    a search string that encompassed keywords pertinent to our Systematic Literature
    Review (SLR). Subsequently, we executed the search query in the leading five digital
    libraries that index computer science literature. Supplementary Figure 3 delineates
    the subsequent stages, including the article selection process, culminating in
    the meticulous review of a selected set of 51 articles. Figure 1 defines the exclusion
    and inclusion criteria as follows. figure 1 Figure 1 Prisma Exclusion/Inclusion
    Criteria. Based on the literature and validation from domain experts, the challenges
    that Saudi Arabia may face in the adoption of IoT-based irrigation systems include:
    Implementation cost (ICO): The cost of implementing IoT-based irrigation systems
    is relatively high (Antony et al., 2020), which could be a major challenge for
    farmers, especially small-scale farmers. The cost of sensors, communication equipment,
    and other components of IoT-based irrigation systems can be prohibitive for some
    farmers. Constructing an affordable, widely-supported smart agriculture platform
    to improve small-scale farmers’ irrigation efficiency, save water in a variety
    of crops with different water needs at different stages of growth, and yield excellent
    results Saqib et al. (2020). To increase agricultural field output, precision
    agriculture makes use of computers, sensors, artificial intelligence, and automation.
    It keeps an eye on the environment at the same time to encourage the preservation
    of soil, water, and other natural resources, with a focus on agricultural sustainability
    in particular. However, the accompanying expenses of data monitoring and recording
    technology prevent their broad implementation in agriculture Ferrarezi and Peng
    (2021). The Table 2 below gives approximate cost of a simple automated irrigation
    system Ferrarezi and Peng (2021). table 2 Table 2 Cost of a simple automated irrigation
    system. The cost is about $400 with one sensor and $1000 with 4 sensors which
    is not a feasible expense for a low-budget farmer. Internet connectivity (ITC):
    Another challenge is the lack of infrastructure, such as reliable internet connectivity
    and power supply (Nguyen et al., 2021). These systems require a reliable power
    supply and a stable internet connection to transmit data, which could be a challenge
    in remote areas with poor infrastructure (Nguyen et al., 2022). The research study
    done by Jabbari et al. (2023) encompasses a study on farmers and the use of IoT
    for crop monitoring in Saudi Arabia and the study suggested that the farmers in
    Saudi Arabia are highly engaged and interested in using IoT technologies for crop
    monitoring. According to this study, when it came to agricultural experience,
    36.0% of respondents had none at all. 32.8% of those with experience had been
    farming for one to three years, 19.4% for four to five years, 10.0% for six to
    seven years, and 1.8% for more than seven years. These results show a mix of seasoned
    and inexperienced farmers, providing insights into their respective viewpoints
    on the uptake of IoT technology. 28% of people were single, 53.8% were married,
    20.2% were divorced, and 5.2% were widowed. This variation in marital status offers
    a thorough insight into farmers’ various living circumstances and viewpoints about
    the deployment of IoT technologies. Among the farmers polled, 68.8% of the males
    and 31.2% of the females had used IoT technology, indicating a possible gender
    difference in adoption in Saudi Arabia particularly Jizan as shown in Table 3
    and bar chart in Supplementary Figure 4. The study also clarifies the understanding
    of farmers’ attitudes and behaviours when it comes to using IoT technology for
    activities like crop monitoring, health assessment, growth tracking, and yield
    prediction. table 3 Table 3 Demographics. Security measures (SCM): IoT offers
    a dependable means of exchanging data between a vast array of devices, with the
    crucial requirement that this exchange is safeguarded against tampering and other
    malicious attacks (Jyoti Deogirikar, 2017). Security issues in IoT are a major
    concern because IoT devices are in direct communication on the internet and are
    efficient for collecting, processing, and transmitting sensitive data. This data
    can include personal information, financial data, and sensitive business data,
    among other things. Many IoT devices have weak security mechanisms, making them
    vulnerable to hacking and cyber-attacks. This can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
    access to systems, and other security incidents (ur Rehman et al., 2022). There
    is currently a lack of standardization in IoT security, which makes it difficult
    to implement consistent and effective security measures across different devices
    and systems. IoT devices and systems may rely on third-party services or software,
    which can introduce additional security risks if these services or software are
    not properly secured. It is important to implement strong security measures throughout
    the entire IoT ecosystem, including device design, data collection and storage,
    data transmission, and user access control. This includes implementing robust
    encryption, authentication, and access control mechanisms, regularly updating
    and patching IoT devices and systems, and providing clear and transparent information
    about security practices to users. Technical expertise (TEC): One of the significant
    challenges is limited awareness (Madakam et al., 2015) among farmers about the
    benefits and usage of these systems. Farmers may lack the technical knowledge
    required to implement and maintain IoT-based irrigation systems. Farmers need
    to be educated about the potential advantages of IoT-based irrigation systems,
    such as reduced water consumption, increased crop yield, and decreased labour
    costs. Precision agriculture practices, such as using sensors to monitor soil
    moisture and temperature, are not yet widely adopted in Saudi Arabia, which could
    limit the adoption of IoT-based irrigation systems. Privacy concerns (PRC): IoT-based
    irrigation systems involve the collection and transmission of sensitive data,
    such as crop yields, soil moisture levels, and weather conditions. Therefore,
    there is a risk of data privacy (Deogirikar and Vidhate, 2016; Teli et al., 2020)
    which could be a significant challenge for farmers. IoT devices can be vulnerable
    to cyber-attacks, which can result in data breaches and expose personal and sensitive
    information to unauthorized parties. IoT devices may share data with third-party
    services or other devices in ways that users may not be aware of or consent to,
    potentially leading to the misuse of their data. IoT devices may have weak security
    or encryption mechanisms, making it easier for attackers to access and steal personal
    data. Many IoT devices and services do not provide clear information about how
    data is collected, processed, and used, or give users control over their data.
    IoT devices can be used to track and monitor individuals without their knowledge
    or consent, potentially infringing on their privacy and civil liberties. To address
    these concerns (ur Rehman et al., 2022), it is important to implement strong privacy
    measures throughout the entire IoT ecosystem, including device design, data collection
    and storage, data sharing, and user consent and control. This includes implementing
    robust encryption, authentication, and access control mechanisms, providing clear
    and transparent information about data practices, and giving users meaningful
    choices and control over their data. Standard protocols (STP): The IoT landscape
    is rapidly evolving, with new devices and technologies being developed all the
    time. This means that existing protocols may not be able to keep up with the changing
    needs and requirements of IoT (Palattella et al., 2013). Also, the sheer scale
    and complexity of IoT networks require protocols that can support large numbers
    of devices, handle high volumes of data, and operate in different environments
    and contexts. IoT devices and systems have unique requirements that may not be
    fully addressed by existing protocols. For example, some IoT devices have limited
    processing power or memory and may require lightweight protocols that can operate
    efficiently on these devices. Up-to-date business model (UBM): Business models
    should be up-to-date to run on IoT for several reasons. Firstly, IoT is a rapidly
    evolving technology that requires businesses to constantly adapt and update their
    models to remain competitive. Outdated models may not be able to fully utilize
    the capabilities of IoT, resulting in missed opportunities for optimization and
    cost savings (Chan, 2015). Secondly, IoT introduces new possibilities for data
    collection, analysis, and automation. To take advantage of these opportunities,
    businesses must have models that are designed to incorporate and leverage the
    data and insights provided by IoT devices. IoT also presents new security risks
    and challenges that require businesses to have updated models and strategies to
    effectively mitigate and manage these risks. Failure to keep up with these risks
    could result in costly data breaches or other security incidents. Mobile deliverability
    (MOD): Providing mobile services to users in IoT (Kaushal et al., 2022) is important
    because it enables users to access and interact with IoT devices and services
    from anywhere, at any time. By incorporating mobile capabilities into IoT devices
    and services, businesses can enhance the user experience and improve the accessibility
    and usability of their products. Mobile services enable users to access and interact
    with IoT devices and services from their smartphones or tablets, providing a more
    convenient and accessible user experience. It can provide users with real-time
    notifications and alerts related to their IoT devices and services, enabling them
    to stay informed and take prompt action if needed. Users can remotely control
    and monitor their IoT devices and services from anywhere, providing greater flexibility
    and convenience. Mobile services can provide businesses with valuable data on
    user behaviour, preferences, and usage patterns, enabling them to make data-driven
    decisions and improve their products and services over time. The final list of
    identified eight challenges is given in Table 4. table 4 Table 4 Identified challenges.
    It is imperative to note that the relative significance of these challenges may
    vary depending on the specific context and region within Saudi Arabia. In conclusion,
    the challenges facing irrigation in KSA continue to be significant, but recent
    literature suggests that innovative solutions, such as IoT-based irrigation systems,
    could help to enhance the utilization efficiency and promote sustainable agriculture.
    Efforts to increase the implementation and adoption of these technologies are
    crucial for ensuring the country’s food security and sustainable water management.
    4 Proposed methodology Academics and professionals have investigated several factors
    and challenges involved in the adoption of an I-SIMS in KSA. This investigation
    requires the collection of expert insights, opinions regarding the significance
    of various challenges, and assessments of the relationship between these challenges,
    which are highly subjective and indeterminate. In order to tackle the uncertainty
    and imprecision inherent in this area, various researchers have employed the GRA
    methodology. For example, (Song et al., 2014) applied GRA within QFD to rank technical
    attributes based on customer expectations. Similarly, citepOmoniwa2014 utilized
    GRA to address multi-criteria selection issues in the field of robotics. The authors
    in (Tosun, 2006) optimized drilling process parameters utilizing GRA, while (Sharma
    et al., 2018) applied GRA to minimize food loss by assessing food safety and security
    risks. In another study, (Tsaur et al., 2017) evaluated the operational performance
    of six TFT and LCD products by analyzing both current and predicted future performances
    with GRA. This study has identified eight challenges that influence the adoption
    of an I-SIMS in KSA. However, the information available about these factors is
    uncertain and incomplete, which makes it challenging to construct a reliable model.
    There is a lack of a well-defined strategy for the adoption process of an I-SIMS
    in KSA, which adds to ambiguity in decision-making. Since implementing SIMS is
    a complex and multifaceted task, the correlation between various influencing challenges
    can be blurry. Systems characterized by imprecise and uncertain information are
    commonly referred to as “grey.” Within the realm of MCDM, especially when decision-making
    involves uncertainty, GRA is a highly effective evaluation methodology (Luthra
    et al., 2018). Thus, GRA can be leveraged to establish a dependable model that
    addresses the uncertainty and unpredictability of complex decision-making processes
    by ranking each challenge and predicting its potential impact on the implementation
    of I-SIMS in KSA. Therefore, the GRA methodology is an appropriate tool to rank
    the challenges. AHP is another commonly used technique in MCDM problem domains.
    Developed by mathematician and operations researcher Thomas Saaty (Saaty, 1989)
    in the 1970s, AHP could be established as a structured methodology for analyzing
    complex decisions, particularly those that involve multiple criteria or alternatives.
    AHP entails breaking down a decision problem into a hierarchy of criteria and
    then assessing each criterion in terms of its relative significance to the overall
    decision. This is accomplished through pairwise comparisons made by experts in
    the field, in which each parameter is compared to every other parameter with respect
    to its relative significance. The comparisons are subsequently converted into
    numerical values, which are employed to calculate weighted scores for each criterion.
    In addition, AHP involves evaluating each alternative in terms of how well it
    satisfies each criterion, with pairwise comparisons made between each alternative
    and every other alternative in terms of their performance on each criterion. The
    comparisons are then translated into numerical values, which are used to calculate
    a score for each alternative. The scores for each alternative are combined with
    the weighted scores for each parameter to produce an overall ranking of the factors/alternatives.
    The decision-maker’s pairwise comparisons are evaluated for consistency using
    the Consistency Ratio (CR) and Consistency Index (CI). The CR is the difference
    between the CI and an average CI that was created at random given a set of consistent
    judgments. To assess if pairwise comparisons are sufficiently consistent, the
    CR value is utilized. A CR value of 0.10 or below is typically regarded as satisfactory
    and denotes reasonable consistency. The CI calculates how far the pairwise comparisons
    differ from a set of judgments that are fully consistent. The AHP has been widely
    used in business, engineering, and other fields to support decision-making in
    a variety of contexts, including project management, supplier selection, and product
    design. In this study both GRA and AHP have been used to rank the alternatives.
    4.1 Grey relational analysis Figure 2 illustrates the process of ranking the challenges
    in the implementation of an I-SIMS in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia using GRA. It
    encompasses four main stages: identifying challenges from the literature, collection
    of data using expert opinion, GRA methodology, and ranking of the factors. Step
    1 and Step 2 shown in Figure 2 have already been discussed in the previous section
    in which eight challenges were identified in the current literature. The complete
    algorithm for GRA is given as follows: figure 2 Figure 2 Flowchart grey relational
    analysis. Step 1: Make a decision matrix using expert knowledge. A 6-point scale
    as shown in Table 5, is used in this study to mark the importance of challenges.
    The domain experts are consulted and the data is collected to make the decision
    matrix using Equation 1. table 5 Table 5 6-point scale for decision matrix. Decision
    Matrix (DM)= ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ d 11 d 21 ⋮ d u1 d 12 d 22 ⋮ d u2 …  …  ⋱ …  d 1v d
    2v ⋮ d uv ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ (1) Where dij, 1 ≤ i ≤ u, 1 ≤ j ≤ v represents the significance
    value by an expert (i) for a challenge (j). Step 2: This step involves the normalization
    of the data collected from experts using Equation 2. d '' ij  =  d ij −φ( d ij
    ,1≤i≤u) ϕ( d ij ,1≤i≤u)−φ( d ij ,1≤i≤u) (2) Where φ and ϕ represent functions
    that return the minimum and maximum of given values, dij respectively. Step 3:
    Next the normalized values are used to calculate the reference sequence for all
    challenges in the range [0,1]. This is achieved as given in Equation 3. s ij  =
    |ϕ(d '' ij ,where 1≤ i≤ u) − d '' ij | (3) Where ϕ represents a function that
    returns the maximum of given values, d′ij. Step 4: In this step, the GRC matrix
    is calculated as given in Equation 4 in order to find the correlation to the reference
    sequence calculated in the previous step. λ ij  =  φ( s ij , 1≤i≤u) + ρ ∗ ϕ( s
    ij , 1≤i≤u) s ij  + ρ ∗ ϕ( s ij , 1≤i≤u) (4) Where ρ = 0.5 and is known as the
    Grey Relational Coefficient and φ and ϕ represent functions that return the minimum
    and maximum of given values, sij respectively. Step 5: This step involves the
    calculation of the Degree (D) or Grey Relational Grade Matrix, which is a single-column
    matrix calculated as given in Equation 5. D = 1/n ∑ j=1 n λ ij (5) Finally, the
    challenges are ranked. 4.1.1 Results After an extensive review of the available
    literature, a total of eight challenges (ICO, ITC, SCM, TEC, PRC, STP, UBM, MOD)
    that have a direct impact on the adoption of an I-SIMS in KSA were identified.
    These factors were then validated in consultation with domain experts. The experts
    included eight individuals from both academia and industry, and a scale was prepared
    after discussions with them. Data was collected from the experts using a Likert
    scale (Likert, 1985) ranging from 0 to 5 shown in Table 5, where 0 represents
    no influence and 5 represents very high influence. The ratings provided by the
    experts were used to construct a decision matrix, which is presented in Table
    6 and outlines the influencing challenges to the adoption of an I-SIMS in KSA.
    table 6 Table 6 Decision matrix. The next step encompasses the normalization of
    data obtained in Table 6. It is done using Equation 2. For example, for (PRC,
    #6), the value 0.2500 is obtained as: d '' ij  =  d ij −φ( d ij ,1≤i≤u) ϕ( d ij
    , 1≤i≤u)−φ( d ij ,1≤i≤u) = 2−1 5−1 =0.2500 The results of normalization for all
    d '' ij s is shown in Table 7: table 7 Table 7 Normalization. Next, the Reference
    Sequence Generation (RSG) is done using Equation 3. For example, for (SCM, #3),
    the value 0.500 is obtained as: s ij =∣ϕ(d '' ij , where 1≤ i ≤ u)−d '' ij =1−0.500
    =0.5000 The results of RSG for all sij’s is obtained as shown in Table 8. table
    8 Table 8 Reference sequence generation. Now, the Grey relational coefficient
    calculation (GRC) is generated using Equation 4. For example. For (STP, #6), the
    value, 0.400 is obtained as: λ ij  =  φ( s ij , 1≤i≤u) + ρ ∗ ϕ( s ij , 1≤i≤u)
    s ij  + ρ ∗ ϕ( s ij , 1≤i≤u) =  0 .0000+ (0.5 * 1.0000) 0.7500 + (0.5 * 1.0000)
    =  0.5 1.25 =0.4000 The results of GRC for all λij’s is obtained as shown in Table
    9. table 9 Table 9 Grey relational coefficient calculation. Finally, the degree
    is calculated using Equation 5. For example, for ICO, the degree value is calculated
    using Equation 5 as: D = 1/n ∑ j=1 n λ ij =  1 8 (0.4286 + 1.0000 + 1.0000 + 0.4286
    + 1.0000 + 0.6667 + 1.0000 + 1.0000 = 0.8155 The degree for all alternatives and
    the corresponding rankings are obtained as given in Table 10. In the next section,
    AHP methodology is applied to revise, verify and validate the results obtained
    using GRA. table 10 Table 10 Degree and ranking of challenges/factors. 4.2 Analytical
    hierarchical process AHP is another approach that is used in MCDMs. AHP operates
    by incorporating comparisons and a systematic approach to minimize bias in the
    sequence of decisions (Saaty, 1989). The process involves a 9-point scale. Figure
    3 illustrates the process of ranking the challenges in the implementation of an
    I-SIMS in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia using AHP. It encompasses four main stages:
    identifying challenges from the literature, creation of a pairwise matrix, normalization
    and calculation of priority weights, ranking of the factors and finally confirming
    the consistency of the pairwise matrix. figure 3 Figure 3 Flowchart analytical
    hierarchical process. The complete AHP algorithm is given as under: Step 1: Identifying
    the most significant challenges or factors that have a direct effect on the adoption
    of an I-SIMS in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Step 2: Creation of an n x n pairwise
    comparison matrix where n depicts the number of challenges identified in step
    1. The pairwise comparison is done according to the significance values and using
    Equation 6 shown in Table 11 as: table 11 Table 11 9-point scale for comparison
    values. Comparison Matrix (CM)= ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ 1 c 21 ⋮ c n1 c 12 1 ⋮ c n2 … …
    ⋱ … c 1n c 2n ⋮ 1 ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ (6) Where,  c ij = ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ 1 1 1 −1 3  3 −1
    5  5 −1 7  7 −1 9  9 −1 i is more significant to j i is equally significant as
    j i is less significant to j as defined in Table 11. Step 3: In this step, normalization
    is done by using Equation 7. c '' ij =  c ij  ∑ n i=0 c ij (7) Step 4: In this
    step, the priority/criteria weights and ranking of challenges are calculated using
    Equation 8. w j  =  1  n ∑ j=1 n c '' ij (8) Step 5: Check the consistency of
    the comparison matrix as follows: 1. Calculate weighted sum using Equation 9.
    w s  = CM .  w j (9) 2. Calculate consistency vector using Equation 10. C v  =  w
    s  .  1 w j (10) 3. Calculate consistency index using Equation 11. Consistency
    Index (CI) =  (ξ − n) n − 1 (11) 4. Calculate consistency ratio (CR) using Equation
    12. CI RI (12) Where RI is Random Index given in Table 12 for different values
    of n as follows: table 12 Table 12 Random consistency index. 5. Check if CR <
    0.10, then. The matrix and rankings are consistent, EXIT. Else The comparison
    matrix (CM) should be recalculated. Repeat Step 2. 4.2.1 Results After identifying
    the challenges that impact I-SIMS adoption in KSA, the comparison matrix was generated
    by consulting with domain experts from both industry and academia. Using Table
    11 and Equation 6, the value of significance is inserted for each pair of alternatives,
    and a pairwise comparison matrix is obtained given in Table 13 as follows: table
    13 Table 13 Pairwise comparison matrix. The second step involves the normalization
    of the pairwise comparison matrix values using Equation 7. For example, for (ITC,
    TEC) pair, the value 0.1786 is obtained as: c '' ij =  c ij  ∑ n i=0 c ij =  5.0000
    28.0006 = 0.1786 The results of normalization for all c '' ij .s is obtained as
    shown in Table 14 as shown below: table 14 Table 14 Normalization. Next, the calculation
    of priority weights is done using Equation 8. For example, for STP, the value
    0.1977 is calculated as: w j  =  1  n ∑ j=1 n c '' ij =  1 8 (0.0855 + 0.1293
    + 0.1539 + 0.1786 + 0.2909 + 0.1382 + 0.3871 + 0.2182) = 0.1977 The results of
    priority weights and the corresponding ranks for all wj’s is obtained and shown
    in Table 15. table 15 Table 15 Criteria wights calculation. Now, in order to validate
    the ranking obtained using the pairwise matrix in Table 10, the comparison matrix
    needs to be consistent with the values provided and verified by the domain experts
    because any inconsistency in the values of the pairwise matrix shall mean unreliable
    data which shall point to unreliable ranking. To check consistency, the weighted
    sum is calculated using Equation 9, for example for w5, ws(w5) = ws(0.0825) =
    0.6924. The values for all weighted sums are obtained by the dot product of CM
    with the criteria weights vector, as shown in Table 16. table 16 Table 16 Consistency
    check. Similarly, the consistency vector is obtained by the dot product of weighted
    sum, wswith 1 w j , as shown in Table 16. In the next step, the CI is calculated
    as: CI =  (ξ − n) (n − 1) , where ξ is the average of  C v =  (8.6033 − 8) (8−1)
    = 0.0862 The random index (RI) for the matrix size 8 is given as 1.41 as shown
    in Table 12. Therefore, the CR is obtained as: CR =  CI RI 0.0862 1.41 = 0.0611
    Since CR = 0.0611 is less than 0.10, the comparison matrix is consistent. 5 Discussion
    Both GRA and AHP confirm that the challenges are ranked given in Table 17: table
    17 Table 17 Final ranking. Technical expertise and a skilled workforce (TEC) surfaced
    as the most important challenge in the adoption of an IoT-based irrigation system
    in KSA. There are various reasons that support the obtained result as follows:
    Technical Complexity: Implementing and managing an IoT-based irrigation system
    requires a certain level of technical expertise, including knowledge of sensor
    installation, data collection, data analysis, system configuration, and troubleshooting.
    Farmers and agricultural stakeholders may require specialized skills to operate
    and maintain the IoT devices and systems, which can be a challenge if they lack
    the necessary technical expertise (Catota et al., 2019). Limited Availability
    of Skilled Workforce: In some regions of KSA, there is a limited number of skilled
    workforce, including technicians, engineers, and other professionals with expertise
    in IoT technologies. This can pose challenges in finding qualified personnel to
    design, install, configure, and maintain IoT-based irrigation systems, which may
    result in delays or inefficiencies in the adoption process. Training and Education:
    Providing adequate training and education for farmers and other stakeholders to
    understand and use IoT-based irrigation systems effectively can be challenging.
    The lack of accessible training programs, resources, and educational materials
    for farmers to learn about IoT technology and its application in agriculture can
    be a barrier to adoption. Language and Cultural Barriers: Language and cultural
    barriers can be a challenge in adopting IoT-based irrigation systems in Saudi
    Arabia. The technical documentation, user manuals, and training materials for
    IoT systems may be predominantly available in English or other languages, which
    may pose difficulties for farmers who are not proficient in these languages. Additionally,
    cultural norms and practices related to technology adoption may influence the
    willingness and ability of farmers to adopt and use IoT-based irrigation systems
    (Eysenbach and Jadad, 2001). Upgrading Existing Skills: Adopting IoT-based irrigation
    systems may require farmers and other stakeholders to upgrade their existing technical
    skills and knowledge to adapt to the new technology. This can be a challenge for
    farmers who have been using traditional irrigation methods and may not be familiar
    with IoT concepts, data-driven decision-making, and digital technologies. Cost
    of Hiring Skilled Workforce: Hiring skilled workforce with expertise in IoT technologies
    can be costly, especially for small-scale farmers or those with limited financial
    resources. The cost of hiring or training personnel with the necessary technical
    skills to implement and manage an IoT-based irrigation system can be a challenge,
    making it less financially viable for some farmers. Addressing the challenge of
    technical expertise and skilled workforce in the adoption of IoT-based irrigation
    systems in Saudi Arabia may require providing training and education programs
    tailored to the needs of farmers and stakeholders, promoting the development of
    local talent in IoT technologies, and providing resources and support to upgrade
    existing skills. Collaborations between government, educational institutions,
    and industry stakeholders can play a vital role in addressing this challenge and
    promoting the successful adoption of IoT-based irrigation systems in the agricultural
    sector. Secondly, Security Measures (SCM) are ranked as the second most important
    challenge, which could be attributed to the following reasons: Data Security:
    IoT-based irrigation systems generate and transmit a huge amount of data, including
    sensitive information such as crop data, water usage, and weather conditions.
    Ensuring the security of this data is crucial to protect it from unauthorized
    access, data breaches, or cyber-attacks (Teli and Masoodi, 2023). Breaches in
    data security can result in financial losses, compromise farmers’ privacy, and
    disrupt the normal operation of the irrigation system (Humayun et al., 2021).
    Device Security: IoT devices, including sensors and communication devices used
    in irrigation systems, can be vulnerable to security threats (Masoodi et al.,
    2021). These devices may lack robust security features or may have vulnerabilities
    that could be exploited by malicious actors to gain unauthorized access or control
    over the system. Ensuring the security of these devices is important to prevent
    unauthorized tampering, manipulation, or disruption of the irrigation system.
    Network Security: The communication networks used to transmit data in IoT-based
    irrigation systems, such as wireless (Teli et al., 2022) or cellular networks,
    can be susceptible to security threats. Unauthorized access to the network, interception
    of data, or denial of service attacks can disrupt the communication between devices
    and the central system, affecting the reliability and performance of the irrigation
    system (Abdullah et al., 2019). Physical Security: Protecting the physical infrastructure
    of the IoT-based irrigation system, including sensors, communication devices,
    and control systems, from theft, vandalism, or tampering is crucial. Physical
    security measures, such as securing access points, using tamper-proof devices,
    and implementing surveillance systems, may be necessary to safeguard the system
    from physical security threats. Compliance and Regulations: Adhering to relevant
    regulations and compliance requirements related to data privacy, cybersecurity,
    and other legal aspects can be challenging in the adoption of IoT-based irrigation
    systems. Complying with local regulations, industry standards, and best practices
    for IoT security may require additional resources, expertise, and effort, which
    can pose challenges to adoption. Awareness and Training: Ensuring that farmers
    and agricultural stakeholders know the security risks associated with IoT-based
    irrigation systems and providing them with the necessary training and knowledge
    to mitigate these risks can be challenging. Lack of awareness and understanding
    of security best practices among end-users can result in unintentional security
    lapses or vulnerabilities in the system. Addressing these security challenges
    (Teli et al., 2021) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia requires implementing robust
    security measures, including encryption, authentication, access control, and regular
    security audits, to protect the data, devices, and networks used in IoT-based
    irrigation systems. Providing education, training, and awareness programs to farmers
    and stakeholders about security best practices and compliance requirements can
    also contribute to the secure adoption and implementation of I-SIMS in the agricultural
    sector. Mobile deliverability (MOD) is an important challenge in which the problem
    of providing services to each stakeholder with mobile and remote devices shall
    be made available 100% of the time. Power Supply and Connectivity: IoT-based irrigation
    systems rely on a stable power supply and connectivity to transmit data from sensors
    to a central system. However, in some remote agricultural areas of Saudi Arabia,
    accessing a stable power supply and reliable internet connectivity may be challenging
    and expensive, which can increase the overall mobile deliverability of services
    and maintain an I-SIMS (Adli et al., 2023). Affordability for Farmers: Farmers
    in Saudi Arabia may face financial constraints in adopting IoTbased irrigation
    systems, especially small-scale and subsistence farmers. The initial setup cost,
    ongoing maintenance, and operational expenses may be beyond the budget of many
    farmers, making it difficult for them to adopt and sustain the technology (Mohammed
    et al., 2021) and inhibiting remote service deliverability. Privacy Concerns (PRC)
    is also a top challenge due to the following reasons: Cultural and Religious Considerations:
    Saudi Arabia has a unique cultural and religious context where privacy is highly
    valued, and strict regulations are in place to protect the privacy of individuals
    and organizations. The Islamic principles of privacy and modesty, as well as the
    social norms and customs, can influence the perception of privacy in the adoption
    of IoT-based irrigation systems. There may be concerns about the potential intrusion
    of privacy, particularly if the systems involve monitoring of private spaces,
    such as farms, fields, or agricultural facilities. Data Privacy and Security Concerns:
    IoT-based irrigation systems rely on data collection and transmission through
    various sensors and devices. This data can include sensitive information such
    as crop yield, soil conditions, weather data, and water usage patterns (Habib
    et al., 2023). Ensuring the privacy and security of this data is critical to prevent
    unauthorized access, data breaches, and misuse of information. There may be concerns
    about the collection, storage, and handling of data by IoT-based irrigation systems,
    particularly if the data is transmitted over the Internet or stored in cloud-based
    systems (Masoodi et al., 2019). Compliance with Data Protection Regulations: Saudi
    Arabia has implemented the Saudi Data and Artificial Intelligence Authority (SDAIA),
    which governs and regulates data and AI-related activities in the country. Compliance
    with data protection regulations, such as the Saudi Data Protection Law (SDPL),
    is important in the adoption of IoT-based irrigation systems. This may require
    additional measures to protect the privacy and security of data collected and
    transmitted by these systems, including obtaining proper consent, ensuring data
    is used for the intended purpose, and providing individuals with control over
    their personal information. Ownership and Control of Data: Farmers and other stakeholders
    may have concerns about who owns the data generated by the IoT devices and systems,
    who has access to the data, and how the data is used. Ensuring that farmers have
    control over their data and that it is used in a manner that aligns with their
    privacy preferences and requirements can be a challenge in the adoption process.
    There may be concerns about data being used for commercial purposes or shared
    with third parties without proper consent, which can raise privacy concerns. Lack
    of Awareness and Understanding: Farmers and other stakeholders may have limited
    awareness and understanding of the privacy risks associated with IoT-based irrigation
    systems. They may not be familiar with the types of data that are collected, how
    the data is transmitted, stored, and used, and the potential privacy implications.
    This lack of awareness and understanding can hinder the adoption of IoT-based
    irrigation systems, as farmers may be hesitant to adopt new technologies without
    a clear understanding of the privacy risks and how they can be mitigated. Cybersecurity
    Risks: IoT devices and systems can be vulnerable to cybersecurity threats, such
    as hacking, malware, and other cyber-attacks. If not properly secured, IoT-based
    irrigation systems can be exposed to potential privacy breaches, leading to data
    leaks or unauthorized access. Ensuring robust cybersecurity measures, including
    encryption, authentication, and access controls, is crucial to protecting the
    privacy of data collected by IoT-based irrigation systems (Lee, 2020). Addressing
    privacy concerns (Teli et al., 2020) in the adoption of IoT-based irrigation systems
    in Saudi Arabia may require implementing strong data privacy and security measures,
    ensuring compliance with relevant regulations, raising awareness and providing
    education on privacy risks, establishing clear ownership and control of data,
    and implementing robust cybersecurity measures to protect against potential privacy
    breaches. Additionally, involving stakeholders in the design and implementation
    of IoT-based irrigation systems, and fostering trust and transparency in data
    handling practices can also help address privacy concerns and promote the successful
    adoption of these technologies in the agricultural sector in Saudi Arabia. Up-to-date
    business model (UBM), Standard protocols (STP), Internet connectivity (ITC) and
    Implementation cost (ICO) appear in the same order of rankings as provided here.
    Business models are already being updated. Protocols are being devised to work
    in line with the new IoT-based technologies. Internet and implementation cost
    appear at the bottom of the list because the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is already
    infrastructure rich and these factors shall pose the least of the challenge in
    the adoption of an IoT-based Smart Irrigation System. Pertinent to mention that
    Implementing an IoT-based irrigation system requires significant upfront investment
    in hardware, sensors, communication devices, and software infrastructure. The
    cost of setting up the necessary infrastructure, installing sensors, and integrating
    them into existing irrigation systems can be expensive, especially for large agricultural
    areas in Saudi Arabia (Ullah et al., 2021). However, most of these costs have
    already been eliminated by having a current state-of-art infrastructure for both
    the internet as well as up-to-date protocols. Implementation costs may be attributed
    to the following reasons: Technology Investment: Sensors, networking infrastructure,
    data storage systems, and other associated technologies must be purchased and
    installed, which entails a substantial upfront cost when implementing IoT-based
    smart agriculture. Cost of Sensors and Devices: Depending on their kind and sophistication,
    Internet of Things (IoT) sensors can range in price. These sensors are essential
    for keeping an eye on crop health, soil conditions, and other factors. Costs of
    Infrastructure: The entire cost of deployment is increased by the construction
    of the data centres and communication networks required to enable IoT. Training
    and Skill Development: More funding for educational initiatives is needed to train
    farmers and other agricultural workers to operate and maintain IoT systems. Internet
    connectivity is a concern due to these issues: Distant and Rural Regions: Agricultural
    regions that are distant or rural may have trouble getting internet access. IoT
    devices’ ability to work in real-time may be hampered by limited access to high-speed
    internet. Dependability Problems: Even in places where internet access is available,
    there might be stability and dependability problems that prevent smart agricultural
    systems from functioning continuously. Broadband Infrastructure: Broadband infrastructure
    quality and availability are critical. This infrastructure has to be expanded
    and improved to provide the smooth communication that Internet of Things applications
    demand. Data transfer Costs: These may be continuous expenses related to data
    transfer, affecting total operating expenses, contingent on the communication
    technology employed (e.g., cellular networks). It is important to mention that
    perceived advantages only account for a portion of the difference in the desire
    to adopt. Access to information and training, as well as farmers’ perceptions
    of government backing, are factors that show a somewhat positive correlation with
    farmers’ propensity to use IoT technology. Taken as a whole, these factors play
    a significant role in explaining the difference in farmers’ adoption willingness.
    Aligning policies in Saudi Arabia with Vision 2030’s objectives, especially those
    concerning technological innovation and economic diversification, can offer a
    strategic framework for the creation and execution of Internet of Things (IoT)-based
    smart agriculture projects. It’s critical to keep up with Saudi Arabia’s particular
    laws and policies since they could change in the future to facilitate the nation’s
    transition to an agricultural economy. The effective execution of Internet of
    Things-based smart agriculture in Saudi Arabia is reliant on all-encompassing
    rules and regulations, including many crucial aspects. First, standards and interoperability
    are handled employing technical standards, which guarantee that IoT systems and
    devices follow consistent guidelines for easy integration. Simultaneously, data
    standards legislation offers criteria for the gathering, archiving, and dissemination
    of agricultural data, promoting cooperation among relevant parties. It is essential
    to have a strong foundation for data security and privacy. Farmers’ data gathered
    by IoT devices is protected by regulations that place a strong emphasis on permission,
    data ownership, and security against illegal access. Policies also specify necessary
    cybersecurity precautions to strengthen IoT systems’ resistance to future cyberattacks.
    In addition, spectrum allocation and connectivity regulations are important because
    they prevent interference and make effective use of available frequencies to provide
    dependable wireless communication. To provide critical internet connectivity for
    Internet of Things applications in agriculture, regulations further encourage
    the construction and upkeep of broadband infrastructure, especially in rural regions.
    Incentives and subsidies also play a significant role in promoting the uptake
    of IoT-based smart agriculture. Financial assistance from government programs
    helps to mitigate the expenses of initial implementation and promotes wider adoption.
    In a similar vein, policies that encourage agricultural technology research and
    development encourage creativity, which produces more sophisticated and affordable
    Internet of Things solutions. Regulations promoting the use of IoT for effective
    resource management, such as precision agriculture and water conservation, address
    environmental sustainability. National plans’ larger sustainability aims are following
    these policies. The policies that promote multi-stakeholder participation help
    to enhance coordination and collaboration. Governmental organizations, businesses,
    and academic institutions work together to create a supporting ecosystem that
    is necessary for the effective adoption of IoT-based smart agriculture. Furthermore,
    regulations about education and workforce development programs guarantee that
    farmers and other stakeholders have the skills required, hence facilitating the
    efficient application and advantages of IoT technology in agriculture. An all-encompassing
    assessment of these variables is necessary to determine if smart IoT-based irrigation
    is technically feasible in Saudi Arabia. Solutions can be more effectively tailored
    to the unique requirements and circumstances of the Kingdom by working with regional
    agriculture specialists, technology suppliers, and governmental organizations.
    Some important factors must be taken into account before smart IoT-based irrigation
    may be implemented in Saudi Arabia. First and foremost, dependable and extensive
    internet connectivity is essential to the functioning of IoT infrastructure, especially
    in distant agricultural areas where real-time smart irrigation systems are in
    place. For devices to communicate with each other seamlessly, effective data interchange
    and system coordination are dependent on a strong network. Second, positioning
    and compatibility of sensor technology are important considerations. The severe
    weather in Saudi Arabia, which includes scorching temperatures and parched terrain,
    must not be tolerated by sensors. Accurate data gathering on soil moisture, temperature,
    and other pertinent elements is ensured by placing sensors optimally. This is
    essential for precision irrigation control. Thirdly, managing and interpreting
    the massive amounts of data produced by IoT devices depends heavily on data management
    and analytics. Making educated judgments about water use and irrigation plans
    requires effective data management. For better scalability and accessibility,
    the viability of using cloud services for data analysis and storage is also taken
    into account. Also, an assessment is conducted on how well-suited the current
    irrigation infrastructure is to receive automated control systems. This entails
    integrating remotely controllable actuators and valves using real-time data. When
    it comes to energy supply, one must evaluate the dependability and accessibility
    of power sources. In areas with plenty of sunlight, solar-powered solutions may
    be a good option. Adherence to regional laws of data privacy and security requirements
    is crucial for the effective operation of intelligent irrigation systems. To determine
    the economic viability, a thorough cost-benefit analysis is carried out, taking
    into account possible long-term water savings, maintenance costs, and initial
    setup costs. The consideration of the availability of trained staff and training
    programs for farmers and stakeholders highlights the particular abilities needed
    to comprehend and utilize IoT-based systems efficiently. Furthermore, the adoption
    of smart agriculture technology in Saudi Arabia may receive extra help from government
    initiatives and support programs, such as those that are in line with Vision 2030
    aims. To customize solutions to the unique requirements and circumstances of the
    Kingdom, a comprehensive assessment of these aspects must be conducted in cooperation
    with regional specialists and stakeholders. 6 Conclusion The research in this
    work focused on the challenges faced by the KSA in irrigation and how IoT-based
    smart irrigation management systems can help overcome these challenges. The paper
    provided an overview of related work and discussed the challenges in IoT implementation
    in KSA. The proposed methodology that includes GRA and AHP algorithms. In this
    study, both GRA and AHP were implemented to rank the alternatives. GRA is an MCDM
    method that is used to analyze the relationship between a set of input and output
    variables and the results. AHP is a structured technique which involves breaking
    down a decision into a hierarchy of criteria and sub-criteria, assigning weights
    to each criterion based on its relative importance, and evaluating factors against
    each parameter. Both methods are used in this study to evaluate the adoption challenges
    of smart irrigation management systems in KSA. According to the final results
    of the study, technical expertise (TEC) and security measures (SCM) top the list
    of most significant challenges that need to be addressed in the adoption of smart
    irrigation management systems in KSA followed by Mobile deliverability (MOD),
    Privacy concerns (PRC), an up-to-date business model (UBM), Standard protocols
    (STP), Internet connectivity (ITC) and finally Implementation cost (ICO). The
    scores for each alternative are combined with the weighted scores for each parameter
    to produce an overall ranking of the alternatives using both the GRA and AHP methods.
    This study shall act as a doorway to more and extended studies in this and other
    domains of decision problems with respect to KSA. Suggestions for future research
    include addressing the potential bias inherent in existing methodologies; a fuzzy
    GRA/AHP approach may be used to analyze and rank challenges in future studies.

  description: The agricultural sector plays an important role in contributing significantly
    to the gross domestic product (GDP) growth in developing countries. On the other
    hand, agriculture is widely affected by major factors such as environmental changes,
    natural disasters, pesticide control, and soil and irrigation-related issues,
    which reduce crop yield. The convergence of Industry 4.0 and agriculture offers
    an opportunity to move into the next generation of Agriculture 4.0. The internet
    of things (IoT), remote sensing, machine learning, deep learning, big data, cloud
    computing, thermal imaging, end-user apps and unmanned aerial vehicles offer a
    full-stack solution. IoT provides the ubiquitous connectivity of smart devices
    to the internet to collect, process and analyse a large amount of agriculture
    field data more quickly and synthesize them to make smart decisions using various
    machine learning and deep learning algorithms. This study reviews the challenges
    and major issues in the IoT agriculture domain and explores its emergence with
    new technologies. It covers the existing literature and illustrates how IoT applicationbased
    precision agriculture solutions have contributed. A case study on weed detection
    for smart agriculture using the YOLOv5 model is presented, achieving high accuracy.
    Finally, various IoT agriculture use cases are discussed, along with current research
    issues and possible solutions for future IoT-based agriculture advancement.

  description: The biggest problem facing contemporary agriculture today is the enormous
    and ongoing growth of the world population, which necessitates a bigger production
    of agricultural goods to meet the needs for food. Also, there are more challenges
    facing agriculture, like the recent rise in inefficiency brought on by global
    climate change, reduced irrigation water, increasing soil contamination, plant
    diseases, and heat waves, all of which have a negative impact on agriculture sectors.
    In order to retain efficiency, sustainability, and quality, the agricultural sector
    needs to make investments in modern technologies and infrastructure that will
    allow it to evolve into a smart industry capable of addressing these difficulties
    through lean operations supported by industrial digital technologies. The manufacturing
    industry has fully embraced the industry 4.0 strategy, allowing them to achieve
    increased optimization, efficiency, responsiveness, and autonomy supported by
    the digitization approach. In order that to make a paradigm shift in the future
    of the agricultural industry, this paper deals with the digitization of agriculture,
    which is based on IOT, AI, and artificial neural network (ANN) technologies. The
    use of these technologies in agriculture will lead to the production of many services,
    such as data collection and analysis, pattern recognition, and independent decision-making
    based on artificial intelligence, added to existing agricultural automation as
    result of these processes. The agricultural industry is currently one of the most
    inefficient industries, and its use will lead to a technical revolution in the
    agricultural sector to improve productivity, quality, and sustainability.

    of addressing these difficulties through lean operations supported by industrial
    digital technologies. The manufacturing industry has fully embraced the industry
    4.0 strategy, allowing them to achieve increased optimization, efficiency, responsiveness,
    and autonomy supported by the digitization approach. In order that to make a paradigm
    shift in the future of the agricultural industry, this paper deals with the digitization
    of agriculture, which is based on IOT, AI, and artificial neural network (ANN)
    technologies. The use of these technologies in agriculture will lead to the production
    of many services, such as data collection and analysis, pattern recognition, and
    independent decision-making based on artificial intelligence, added to existing
    agricultural automation as result of these processes. The agricultural industry
    is currently one of the most inefficient industries, and its use will lead to
    a technical revolution in the agricultural sector to improve productivity, quality,
    and sustainability. Access provided by University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Download

    Keywords Smart farming Industry 4.0 Artificial Intelligence (AI) 1 Introduction
    The World Food Organization estimates that the world population will reach 9.15
    billion by 2050, with an increase of another 2 billion, while the area that can
    be added to arable land will only be 4% [15]. And according to a paper published
    in 2018 by the World Government Summit, “Population growth = more food. The same
    paper estimated that the world''s population will increase to 10 billion in 2050
    [1, 7]. Due to the increasing world population and the challenges facing the agricultural
    sector (which will be discussed below), it is not possible to achieve agricultural
    practices with the required efficiency except by using the latest technological
    solutions, relying on modern agricultural techniques to improve resources and
    increase consumer demand, as well as high quality standards such as food safety,
    security, and traceability. Agricultural production needs many activities, such
    as soil monitoring, temperature, relative humidity, vegetation conditions, carbon
    dioxide levels, pest control, supply management, and infrastructure. IoT-based
    technology can add value in terms of quality, sustainability, and production increase
    as it performs a range of operations and helps with decision-making [7]. The goal
    of this research is to use fuzzy logic to integrate human informal knowledge into
    control techniques for protected agriculture. Early prediction of plant disease
    using an ANN-based system, networking of smart sensors, and IoT technology networking
    to facilitate and control large amounts of data, as well as collecting the data
    from sensors and integrating them in real-time to allow monitoring and control
    from anywhere and at any time by all process participants and also calculating
    biotic and abiotic stresses using UAVs and multispectral cameras Smart control
    of plant irrigation and fertilization using ANN, These It is considered one of
    the main questions of this research. However The main idea or focus of the current
    study program is to implement the Industry 4.0 strategy in farming through the
    integration of Internet of Things (IOT), ANN, fuzzy logic and artificial intelligence
    (AI) techniques into the industry''s infrastructure to make it possible to achieve
    the following goals and milestones: Using fuzzy logic, artificial intelligence,
    and the Internet of Things in agriculture has many advantages for helping and
    developing agriculture, and it will also facilitate farms in reducing manufacturing
    costs and thus increasing profitability and sustainability [3]. The research will
    make it possible to include human informal knowledge into the control strategy
    using fuzzy logic, creating human-like control over the greenhouses'' parameters.
    With the combined application of artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of
    things (IoT), it will be easier to reach a higher level of efficiency in the use
    of resources like water, fertiliser, pesticides, energy sources, etc. On the farm,
    (IoT applications will lead to environmental protection). Also, this study dealt
    with the use of fuzzy logic techniques, which will enable the integration of informal
    human knowledge into the control strategy, thus developing human-like control
    of the parameters of farm entities (greenhouses). Through the joint use of AI
    and IoT, they will facilitate an enhanced level of efficiency in the use of water,
    fertilizers, pesticides, energy sources, etc. on the farm (artificial intelligence
    (AI), and IoT applications will protect the environment). This study also focused
    on the importance of integrating technology. The research enables farms to adopt
    more effective environmental protection strategies. by combining fuzzy logic and
    AI technology. However, IoT is a key component of smart farming as well, as this
    study shows. This is considered one of the main problems in this sector, and this
    study seeks solutions to these problems to enable farmers to use modern agricultural
    industry technology on their farms as well as provide practical steps to agricultural
    companies. It also gives the farmers solutions and good ideas for the researchers
    about how to pay attention to this important sector. These are the main issues
    addressed in this study. Also, the paper presents a rationalization of the benefits
    and useful information about Industry 4.0 as well as the obstacles related to
    the implementation of the latest technological solutions in smart agriculture.
    The importance of this research lies in the fact that it provides important technological
    solutions for the significance of using Industry 4.0 in the agriculture sector,
    particularly using IOT, AI, and fuzzy logic in smart farming, as well as recommending
    researchers pay attention to this important sector. It will also enable farms
    to lead in adopting more effective environmental protection strategies through
    the combined use of fuzzy logic and AI techniques. This is one of the most important
    technical recommendations that must be worked on and developed. 2 Previous Research
    The widespread use of wireless communication will raise the bar for agricultural
    automation, and wireless communication will alter communication standards. Sensor
    networks are defined by a variety of IEEE standards, including IEEE 802.15.1 PAN/Bluetooth,
    IEEE 802.15.4 ZigBee, and many others. These standards must be understood when
    developing sensor network applications. The use of the IPV6 Internet Protocol
    for wireless communication and a significant amount of hardware to establish a
    WSN are currently under debate. Precision agriculture and the creation of optimal
    strategies are both made feasible by using WSN. However, the IoT concept has made
    it possible to build a network of intelligent sensors that can quickly and effectively
    cover large areas. The IOT gateway has been forked by the authors, Sridevi Navulur
    et al., into various nodes such as actuators, sensors, interfaces, and wireless
    links that enable communication between them [26]. To monitor agricultural land
    and alert farmers via email or SMS or if the system detects any anomalies, Kodali
    et al. presented the Losant platform [20, 21]. An automated irrigation system
    that uses the GPRS module as a communication tool was created by Gutiérrez-Rodrguez
    et al. [10]. The system has been programmed into a microprocessor-based gateway
    that regulates the flow of water and has the system encoded into it. It has been
    shown that the water savings are 90% greater than the irrigation technique used
    traditionally. Kim et al. used a distributed wireless network to remotely sense
    and control irrigation processes [27]. To decrease human intervention, time, and
    cost while improving efficiency, productivity, and the global market. Malavade
    et al. focused on the IoT''s impact in agriculture and how it results in smart
    framing [23]. Artificial neural networks (ANN) have recently been used by the
    agricultural industry due to their advantages over conventional control systems.
    Artificial neural networks can predict the behaviour of the system through the
    training process [11]. Gliever and Slaughter utilized ANN to recognize weeds in
    crops. The authors, Maier et al., utilized artificial neural networks (ANNs) to
    predict water resource variables [22]. To send data to the server so that domain
    operators can make appropriate decisions [30], Song & He et al. combined expert
    systems and artificial neural networks to estimate the nutritional value of crops,
    while Ravichandran & Koteshwari suggested using ANN algorithms for crop. They
    also suggested an expert farming system that uses IoT to send data to the server
    so that domain operators can make suitable decisions [30]. The effectiveness of
    the model depended on the number of hidden layers. To assess soil moisture in
    the Badi fields with significantly less meteorological data, two ANN models were
    created. By examining the observed and estimated soil moisture values, both models
    were proven to be accurate. It led to a more efficient use of less meteorological
    data, a lower consumption of labor and time, and an accurate and trustworthy estimation
    of soil moisture in rice fields [2]. Hinnell et al. [12], in their discussion
    of drip irrigation systems, mention that ANNs have been developed to predict the
    spatial distribution of groundwater [12]. The membership function of each system
    variable used in fuzzy logic is an effective technique for representing informal
    knowledge [13, 14]. Sannakki et al. created a novel technique for classifying
    leaf diseases that separates the healthy from the diseased portions of the leaf
    with the help of image segmentation and a set of k means [29]. To determine the
    ideal N fertiliser rates based on field and crop variables, Tremblay et al. developed
    the fuzzy inference system (FIS) [25]. Based on the weather data, the model predicted
    plant illnesses [16]. The technique was created to prevent diseases in plants
    because they only appear when the temperature and humidity in the atmosphere are
    within a specified range. Wall and King created an intelligent system that uses
    field temperature and humidity sensors to control sprinkler valves [14, 17]. A
    distributed irrigation system that measures soil moisture was developed by Miranda
    et al. [3, 15], and Greenhouse developed a multi-variable fuzzy controller for
    the Greenhouse system. The developed fuzzy inference engine integrates the correlation
    of input variables and incorporates informal knowledge from field experts [14].
    3 Definition of Industry 4.0 A paper was proposed in 2011 titled “Industry 4.0:
    Intelligent Manufacturing of the Future.” Industry 4.0 is defined as “the name
    of the current trend of automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies,
    including smart factory construction, the IoT, cloud computing, cognitive computing,
    and electronic physical systems” [12, 22, 27]. Industry 4.0 refers to the technological
    evolution from embedded systems to electronic physical systems [31]. Note that
    there are many definitions for “industry 4.0”, and not all the definitions are
    the same, but “industry 4.0” is also known as the Fourth Industrial Revolution
    [1]. Decentralized intelligence helps create intelligent networks and manage autonomous
    operations, with the interaction of the real and virtual worlds representing a
    new and important aspect of the manufacturing and production process. The first
    industrial revolution began in the late eighteenth century in Britain, enabling
    the mass production of water and steam power rather than human and animal power.
    A century after the first Industrial Revolution, Industrial 2.0 began, introducing
    assembly lines and the use of oil, gas, and electric power as important energy
    sources in the industry, along with more advanced communications by telephone
    and telegraph and a certain degree of automation of manufacturing processes [28].
    The third industrial revolution began in the mid-twentieth century, contributing
    to the manufacture of computers, advanced communications, and data analysis [31].
    In addition, the digitization of factories has started with the integration of
    control units (PLCs) into machines to automate certain processes and collect and
    exchange data. The world is currently experiencing the fourth industrial revolution,
    which is the latest transformation in the industrial sector. (Increasing automation
    and the use of smart machines and smart factories), this data helps produce more
    efficient and productive goods. Flexibility is improved so that manufacturers
    can meet customer demands with mass customization; in pursuit of efficiency, by
    collecting more data from the factory floor and combining it with other enterprise
    operational data, a smart factory can achieve information transparency and better
    decision-making. The Fifth Industrial Revolution (Industry 0.5) is expected to
    bring humans back to the centre of operations through a human-electronic-physical
    system of value creation [28]. Tables 1 and 2 show the development roadmap of
    industrial and agricultural revolutions from the 18th century up to date. Table
    3 shows the concepts of Industry 4.0 technology and Agriculture 4.0 technology.
    Table 1. The history of industry revolutions from steam to sensors [18, 28]. Full
    size table Table 2. The history of agriculture revolutions from 18th century up
    today [18, 28, 32]. Full size table The agricultural revolution brought an important
    shift in human history and helped in the development of agriculture and the domestication
    of plants and animals. It also enabled people to stay in their places and establish
    permanent and stable settlements, which helped civilization development (1960s
    to the early 2000s). Table 3. The concepts of industrial and agricultural revolution
    technologies [1]. Full size table 4 Agriculture 4.0 and Food Industry Despite
    the big evolution in the agricultural field, there are many issues and challenges
    that need to be addressed, such as environmental issues, a lack of digitalization,
    and the issue of food safety. Industry 4.0 was marked by the synthesis of all
    emerging technologies, bringing together the IoT (IoT), robotics, big data, and
    blockchain technology [7], Using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), Autonomous Robotic
    Systems (ARS), Cloud Computing (CC), Simulation and System Integration (SI), Cyber
    Physical Systems (CPS), Digital Twin (DT), and Additive Manufacturing (AM), industry
    can be digitalized and make agriculture smarter. The integration of Industry 4.0
    and agriculture provides the opportunity to transform industrial agriculture into
    Agriculture 4.0, or the “next generation”, also called “digital agriculture.”
    Agriculture 4.0 can be achieved by collecting precise variables in real-time as
    well as processing and analysing data related to the agricultural industry from
    food production, processing, and distribution to consumer use [1]. Such a smart
    agro system would greatly improve productivity, food supply chain efficiency,
    natural resource utilization and food safety [7, 19]. Sensors are used to detect
    crop stages, recommend timely inputs and treatments, and control the level of
    irrigation. The food industry needs more research on food security, transparency,
    and the required documentation. Smart sensors are used as a tracking system in
    addition to collecting human and product data. Agriculture 4.0 means a transformation
    of the production infrastructure: it contributes to the creation of connected
    farms, new production equipment, machinery, and connected tractors, enabling increased
    productivity, quality, and environmental protection [19]. Smart agriculture concept
    is shown below in Fig. 1. Fig. 1. Smart agriculture concept [1]. Full size image
    5 From Industry 4.0 Toward Agriculture 4.0 The methodology behind this study is
    to develop a smart farm prototype using digital technologies, implementing the
    industry 4.0 strategy in farming. The study also identifies challenges and evaluates
    unsolved problems, potential applications, and the uses of AI and architectures
    for the IoT in the agricultural industry. With the help of Internet of Things
    (IoT), fuzzy logic, and artificial neural networks (ANN) technologies, the study
    will develop an integrated digital tool that will allow the agricultural sector
    to collect, process, and transmit data as well as take independent decisions and
    actions based on incorporated informal knowledge obtained through the use of fuzzy
    logic without the need for human intervention [10]. The Internet of Things provides
    the communications infrastructure required to connect and link smart devices to
    user-mobile devices over the Internet, such as sensors, vehicles, and unmanned
    aerial vehicles to user-mobile devices [5]. This study also highlights many of
    the challenges exposed to contemporary agriculture, such as the continually increasing
    demand for quality food, shortages of labour and arable land, increased soil contamination,
    irrigation water reduction, and loss of yields due to plant diseases and pests
    [7]. Along with this, the agricultural sector is currently facing difficulties
    brought on by climate change, which have increased existing inefficiencies in
    the field. These are besides the challenges the agricultural industry currently
    faces due to global climate change, which has added to the inefficiencies of the
    agricultural industry. In such circumstances, to maintain efficiency, quality
    food, and healthy and sustainable production and cultivation of healthy food Environmentally,
    the agricultural industry needs to invest in new techniques and infrastructure
    to transform into a smart industry comprised of smart farms capable of responding
    to challenges through lean operations supported by industrial digital technologies
    (IDTs), irrigation water reduction, increased soil contamination, and yield loss
    due to plant diseases and pests [4, 10]. This research can be useful to farmers,
    researchers, and professionals working in agricultural businesses for intelligent
    farming. Newness/ originality of the study: Several prominent researchers have
    made efforts for smart agriculture using IoT concepts in agriculture. But a set
    of revealed challenges remains in the queue for effective resolution. This study
    makes some effort to discuss previous research and open challenges in IoT-based
    agriculture, artificial intelligence, artificial neural networks, and fuzzy logic
    to develop smart farming. However, using industry 4.0 techniques in farming will
    give farmers and agriculture companies many benefits: 1. By using the Internet
    of Things in farming, it can make it easier to manage and collect large amounts
    of data from sensors, as well as control and integrate them from anywhere and
    at any time, allowing communication among all participants in the process. 2.
    Using fuzzy logic, the research will allow the incorporation of human informal
    knowledge into the control strategy, resulting in human-like control of the farm
    entities (‘greenhouses’) parameters. 3. With the combined of AI and IoT, the farm
    will be able to achieve a higher level of efficiency in the use of water, energy
    sources, fertilisers, pesticides, etc. 4. Internet of Things applications will
    lead to environmental protection. 5. The research enables farmers to adopt more
    efficient environmental protection strategies by combining fuzzy logic and AI
    techniques. 6. Using Internet of Things (IOT) sensors and AI-enabled equipment
    such as drones and agriculture robots, farmers can increase food production by
    more than 70% by 2050. Figure 2 shows the system''s structure. The central unit
    receives and collects the data from autonomous measurement stations, local weather
    forecasts, professional knowledge from local agronomists, pre-processed images
    received from multispectral crop cameras utilising UAVs, and data obtained from
    mobile device applications. The central unit generates control actions for the
    actuators based on previously collected, processed, and stored data, The central
    unit generates control actions for the actuators. This system is suitable for
    both outdoor and protected agriculture (in greenhouses and indoors). Actions are
    taken in accordance with the type of plant under supervision. The system controls
    the internal temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide enrichment, irrigation,
    and fertilisation in the case of protected cultivation. In the case of outdoor
    cultivation, the system regulates watering and fertilisation and computes the
    severity index to allow for early pest detection. AI-based solutions will also
    be utilised to optimise resource utilisation [32]. 6 Technology-Driven Agriculture
    Industry 4.0 changed the industrial and agriculture sectors and offered several
    advantages across many industries, but especially in agriculture industry fields,
    farmers are now using Industry 4.0 technology in smart agriculture by utilising
    modern devices like agriculture robots, drones (UAVs), sensors, AI, the Internet
    of Things (IoT), etc. Fig. 2. The structure of the proposed system. Full size
    image 6.1 Internet of Things in Agriculture Majority of research publications
    discussed the influence of IoT devices on system automation, including how they
    can determine soil texture, automate irrigation systems, and detect environmental
    change. Such as temperature and humidity, detecting pests and weeds, and assessing
    damage to the soil. Smart agriculture contributed to the development of the agricultural
    sector. Farmers are now utilising modern technologies in agriculture to make it
    smarter and more productive, using IOTs and AI and linking agriculture with satellites,
    the internet, sensors, etc. To increase the benefits of the IoT [5]. The data
    connection varies from sensor to sensor. First, the sensors gather the information,
    share it with the IoT gateway, connect through Wi-Fi or Bluetooth to the database,
    and store the data in the cloud. Then the user finally gets the processed information
    (or data) and uses it to make smarter decisions. Wireless Sensor Network (WNS)
    helps make the right decisions in relevant situations, and thus WNS supports decision-making
    to find solutions to problems related to agriculture [1, 18]. Despite technological
    development, many challenges must be faced when using modern technologies in smart
    agriculture. Among those challenges, most people are ignorant of how to use technology
    in the agriculture sector due to a lack of knowledge about dealing with mobile
    devices and a lack of reading and comprehension knowledge. There are also other
    factors, such as a lack of energy supply, changes in weather or climatic conditions,
    and funding sources [1]. But the development of the agricultural field using modern
    technologies has helped to overcome obstacles and solve many problems in modern
    agriculture. In the Agriculture 4.0 sector, the Internet of Things (IoT) is commonly
    utilized in various ways, such as the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in
    agriculture, as well as the IOT for monitoring soil and water quality, optimizing
    crop irrigation, employing precision agriculture techniques like remote sensing,
    humidity, and temperature monitoring, and implementing autonomous greenhouses
    and these are the important and common uses of IOT in agriculture [8, 18]. 6.2
    Wireless Sensor Networks in Agriculture Wireless sensor network technology is
    used on the IoT. WSN is defined as a group of spatially dispersed sensors that
    monitor environmental conditions, store data obtained, and send information collected
    to a central point [1]. A wireless communication module connects several sensor
    nodes to form a WSN for smart agriculture. These nodes can self- self-configure,
    self-organize, and self-diagnose [24, 32]. These nodes have a variety of capabilities
    (such as processing, transmission, and acquisition). WSNs can be divided into
    various sorts based on the environment in which they are found. These comprise
    mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs), underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSN),
    underwater wireless sensor networks (WUSN), and terrestrial wireless sensor networks
    (TWSN) [1, 20]. For agricultural applications, TWSN and UWSN sensor networks are
    often used [1, 20, 32]. TWSN nodes are positioned above the surface of the earth
    and consist of sensors to collect surrounding data. A second alternative to WSNs
    is their underground counterpart, WUSNs. Nodes are inserted into the soil, where
    they easily perform low-frequency functions while exhibiting very weak higher-frequency
    capabilities. As a result, it takes a lot of knots to cover a big area. Several
    research publications that have been addressed in the literature have covered
    the use of WSNs for various farm applications, such as irrigation management,
    water quality evaluation, and environmental monitoring. Additionally, there are
    several WSN-related issues that require more focus and attention, including interoperability,
    robust and fault-tolerant architecture, and maintenance [1, 5]. 6.3 Artefactual
    Intelligence in Agriculture 4.0 The agriculture sector is experiencing the rapid
    customization of both artificial intelligence and machine learning in seasonal
    agricultural outcomes and field agriculture techniques. The development of computer
    systems that can carry out tasks that require human intelligence, such as decision-making
    and sensory perception, is known as artificial intelligence [24]. Combined with
    cloud computing, artificial intelligence, big data, and the Internet of Things,
    this is seen as one of the main drivers behind the digitization of the agriculture
    industry 4.0. Many smart farming systems that use machine learning [ML] and deep
    learning [DL] algorithms have been developed to determine various parameters such
    as crop and soil control, diagnosing plan. Diseases, detecting weeds, intelligent
    spraying, aerial surveys, and photography that are used to improve crop production.
    In addition to ongoing monitoring, harvesting, processing, and marketing [17].
    Learning and responding to special situations (based on learning) to increase
    efficiency [1]. Providing some of these options to farmers as a service, such
    as Chabot or different conversation principles, will assist them in properly supporting
    the pace of technological improvements, such as identifying similarities in everyday
    farming. Agricultural robotics organizations recognize the value of robots that
    depend on and manipulate themselves to handle key agricultural services such as
    assembly plants on a more prominent scale, at a faster pace, and with more proactivity
    than personal workers [19]. 6.4 Advance Robotic Agricultural robots have been
    developed to perform precision farming operations and to replace humans in certain
    tasks. Advanced robots have been used in recent years for purposes such as cultivation
    and harvesting, water supply, targeted spraying, and environmental control. Robots
    equipped with lasers and cameras are used to identify and remove weeds without
    the need for human intervention. These robots move autonomously through the rows
    of crops, resulting in higher yields when labour is reduced [9]. It can also be
    used in the fields to complete specific farming tasks. Recently, robots for plant
    growth and fruit picking have emerged to bring new levels of efficiency to traditional
    methods. Stationary robots are usually the most popular alternative in industrial
    applications [29]. However, in the context of agriculture, mobile robots may offer
    greater utility, as they can traverse different types of terrain that are not
    otherwise easily accessible, cover large fields, and automate agricultural tasks.
    In the agricultural sector, mobile robots are widely used to improve farm management,
    increase farm efficiency, and reduce labor needs, especially in harsh environments
    inaccessible to humans [19]. These robots perform a variety of agricultural activities,
    such as harvesting, field cultivation, mechanical weeding, precision spraying,
    irrigation management and soil sampling [9]. 6.5 Machine Learning in Agriculture
    Machine learning techniques are classified into three categories: (1) Supervised
    learning (regression trees, linear regression, nonlinear regression, Bayesian
    linear regression, polynomial logistic regression, and vector regression support).
    (2) unsupervised learning (K-group means, hierarchical clustering, anomaly detection,
    neural networks, principal component analysis, independent component analysis,
    prior algorithms, and singular value decomposition) and (3) re-informative learning
    (Markov decision processes and Q learning) [1, 24]. Technologies and algorithms
    implement machine learning in agriculture. Crop yield forecast by sector, diseases,
    weed detection, and weather forecast (precipitation), estimation of soil properties
    (such as moisture content, pH, temperature, etc.), water management, calculating
    lawn fertiliser application rates, and livestock production and care of animals.
    Management Rates are used for a wide range of agricultural applications. The analysis
    shows that “crop yield prediction” is a topic that has been extensively studied.
    The most popular ML technologies for smart agriculture are support vector machines
    (SVM), neural networks (NN), random forests (RF), and linear regression. There
    have been no reports of commercial applications yet for the listed use cases,
    which are currently in the research stage. Additionally, it has been discovered
    that indoor vertical farming systems, particularly hydroponic, aquaponic, and
    aeroponic systems, are hardly researched using AI and machine learning approaches
    [24]. Technology from ML is applied. Given the difficulties of digital transformation
    in terms of cybersecurity and data privacy, new approaches such as such as federated
    learning and privacy-preserving methods, are being developed to enable digital
    agriculture. And mitigate security issues [1]. 6.6 Drones (UAVs) Technology in
    Agriculture 4.0 Drones (UAVs), known as drones or aerial robots, are widely used
    by farmers to monitor crop growth, and combat hunger, and adverse environmental
    impacts. It is called “unmanned” because there is no human pilot on board [1].
    Unmanned aerial vehicles are used efficiently to take pictures, spray water and
    pesticides, consider rugged terrain, etc. It has proven its value in terms of
    spray speed as well as accuracy, when compared to conventional machines for the
    same purpose, UAV technology can be used for gathering information that helps
    farmers make decisions. With recent developments in drone technology, a group
    of UAVs equipped with 3D cameras and heterogeneous sensors can work together to
    provide farmers with comprehensive capabilities and tasks to manage their lands
    and farms [5]. By using these drones in agriculture, farmers can set their eyes
    on the sky. However, using drones in agriculture can carry out large and difficult
    tasks and reach remote and rugged places with the necessary speed and time, but
    there are still many challenges that need to be addressed to take advantage of
    this technology, especially the integration with other technologies and how to
    use it in bad weather conditions [21]. UAVs, and radio-controlled model aircraft
    can be flown at lower altitudes for increased spatial resolution, possibly at
    a lower cost [19]. The advantage of the image using drones for agriculture is
    their accuracy (very high pixels), compared to other traditional methods [6].
    Drone images are used in many things, including mapping grass types, measuring
    shrub biomass, mapping crop strength, monitoring crop water stress, recording
    crop biomass, and evaluating nitrogen treatments. On crops [21], in addition,
    the UAV is also used as a geo-fence to repel animal attacks by alerting the owner
    in a timely and safe manner [19] (see Fig. 3). Fig. 3. The types of drones used
    in agriculture (https://www.iberdrola.com/web/guest/innovacion/smart-farming-agricultura-precision).
    Full size image 7 The Benefits of Industry 4.0 in Agriculture Using modern technologies
    in the agriculture sector has many advantages related to the economic, social,
    and environmental fields. This paper will briefly cover all the fields mentioned
    above. First, the environmental field: These technologies contributed to reducing
    pollutants (such as agricultural chemicals and various fertilizers), which led
    to the sustainability [1, 3] or increase of soil quality, reduced water pollution,
    reduced carbon dioxide and nitrogen, and reduced air pollution. Secondly, economically,
    it has many advantages, including operational efficiency, maximising resources,
    and providing high-quality product results, such as increased yields, improved
    soil quality, and high selling prices of raw materials. Smart farming systems
    also enable accurate management of demand forecasts and timely delivery of goods
    to market to reduce waste. In addition to the various benefits in terms of efficiency,
    there are lower costs involved, less water consumption, less use of technical
    inputs, and lower overall costs. In terms of social benefits, it reduces time
    and effort (reducing physical labor) and increases quality, as well as reducing
    worker stress and improving their well-being and safety at work. Overall, Agriculture
    4.0 helps reduce costs and improve product quality, quantity, and sustainability
    [18]. 8 Challenges Facing Agriculture 4.0 To introduce the new technology (Industry
    4.0 to Agriculture 4.0) in a specific environment, there are many challenges and
    obstacles, such as technical and technological challenges related to the application
    of smart agriculture, technical problems related to modern equipment, weather
    problems, rugged lands in some areas, and a lack of knowledge for some farmers
    about how to use the modern techniques in agriculture [4, 8]. Agriculture 4.0
    requires great economic effort; financing sources consider it most important to
    farmers. However, funding sources are one of the most important challenges in
    some developing countries. Implementation challenges: Using Agri4.0 in the agriculture
    sector requires skills. Cultural and organisational challenges: Due to the introduction
    of digitalization in agriculture, Agriculture Revolution 4.0 will require skills
    related to introducing digital solutions in companies [18]. However, weather conditions,
    energy sources, and financing, the ruggedness of some areas, and the lack of sufficient
    knowledge to use modern technologies for some farmers is considered the most important
    challenge facing smart agriculture. Moreover, for a successful implementation
    of ANN, fuzzy logic control systems, other artificial intelligence engines, to
    train Artefactual Intelligence (AI) models in the agricultural sector, a huge
    amount of data is needed [4]. 9 Discussions Smart farming depends on advanced
    technology systems in management, analysis, processing, data collection, decision-making,
    etc. to reduce costs and make farming more productive, profitable, sustainable,
    and environmentally friendly. Smart agriculture can contribute significantly to
    meeting the food needs of the world''s population [1]. This study aims to highlight
    the importance of using new technologies in farming. Using Industry 4.0 in agriculture
    can make agriculture smart and available, as well as contribute to solving many
    agriculture problems. We have clarified part of these challenges and solutions
    in this paper, which shows the importance of resorting to researchers, farmers,
    and agricultural companies to contribute to the development of this important
    sector. And shows that it is not as required. And there are many issues and challenges,
    such as the issue of food safety, a lack of digitization, and environmental problems.
    Sources of financing and support, a lack of resources, and the lack of knowledge
    of many farmers on how to use new technologies on farms., which is considered
    one of the most important challenges facing smart agriculture in developing countries.
    (Industry 4.0) was distinguished by doing a lot of things and tasks with less
    effort and in a short amount of time. Industry 4.0 spawned all the emerging technologies,
    bringing together BDMM, IoT technologies, robotics, big data, and blockchain technology
    [7, 8, 18, 19], are making production and supply processes smarter and now more
    autonomous. The integration of smart Industry and Agriculture offers the opportunity
    to transform industrial agriculture into the next generation. Smart farming can
    be achieved by collecting precise variables in real time, in addition to processing
    and analysing data related to agricultural industries from food production, processing,
    and distribution to consumers, through artificial intelligence (AI), Big data,
    sensors, IOTs, (UAVs), agriculture robots), etc. Such a smart ecosystem in the
    agricultural field would contribute significantly to improving productivity, food
    supply chain efficiency, natural resource utilization and food safety. Industry
    4.0 towards Agriculture 4.0 means a shift in production infrastructure: it contributes
    to the creation of connected farms, new production equipment, tractors, and tying
    machines, enabling increased productivity, quality, and environmental protection
    [28], as well as giving recommendations to those who are interested in smart farming
    and to the researchers to combine the use of AI techniques and fuzzy logic, which
    will enable the farms to lead in adopting more effective environmental protection
    strategies. And this point is one of the most important recommendations that must
    be worked on and developed. 10 Conclusions This paper provides a future vision,
    an overview, and objective solutions for Industry 4.0 applications in agriculture.
    It highlights the significance of using modern technologies in agriculture to
    contribute to those interested in developing and knowing the places of imbalance
    in the agriculture sector, as well as identifying the challenges facing smart
    agriculture to find solutions and innovate new ways, contribute to opening research
    and innovation issues, and therefore be useful in identifying prospects and knowledge
    of the gaps in agriculture 4.0. The study''s goal is to respond effectively to
    global climatic changes, fluctuations in the global economy and environmental
    fields, a lack of resources, and an increase in the global population, all of
    which affect agricultural development and prevent us from achieving food self-sufficiency.
    However, the technologies provided by Industry 4.0 for agriculture field refer
    to many creative solutions that can be used to develop this important sector.
    In this paper, the challenges facing farmers are highlighted, and logical solutions
    are presented to meet future expectations and make agriculture more efficient
    and smarter. In this context, Internet of Things, drones, micro-communication
    technologies, agriculture robots, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence
    are discussed. The study introduces our current research in the field of applications
    of AI, IoT, ANN, fuzzy logic, and early detection of plant diseases. In addition
    to IOT for smart communication in data collection, processing, and analysis, it
    is considered one of the powerful tools that enable agricultural management, so
    farmers and researchers should pay close attention to move this sector to a qualitative
    new level. It will provide a new ecological approach to environmental protection,
    although there is still much research to be done. The design above demonstrates
    that the approach enables the integration of expert human knowledge into control
    strategies by using fuzzy logic to facilitate control in protected agriculture.
    Additionally, various expert-based strategies can also be simulated, compared,
    and analyzed [13]. In conclusion, this study also highlights that humans can use
    fuzzy logic to facilitate the integrated control of protected agriculture through
    their formal knowledge. Future work in this research is to combine the uses of
    IOT and AI to achieve the highest level of sustainability, quality, and efficiency
    in the use of water, energy sources, fertilizers, pesticides, soil type, soil
    temperature, etc., on the farm. With the knowledge that IoT applications in the
    agriculture sector will lead to environmental protection. And additionally, the
    study enables the farms to adopt more effective environmental protection tactics
    by advancing the combined use of fuzzy logic and AI technology. References Abbasi,

  description: In the midst of rising global population and environmental challenges,
    smart agriculture emerges as a vital solution by integrating advanced technologies
    to optimize agricultural practices. Through data-driven insights and automation,
    it tackles the necessity for sustainable resource management, enhancing productivity
    and resilience in the face of complex food security and ecological concerns. The
    prospects of utilizing the Internet of Things (IoT) for smart agriculture are
    tremendous, where many IoT devices can be deployed for local environment monitoring,
    precision farming, autonomous irrigation, and, soil management. In some use cases
    like smart monitoring and agrochemical applications, UAV-enabled mobile-edge computing
    (MEC) is proposed as an enabler to provide IoT nodes with additional resources
    by hosting their computation functions. From the implementation perspective, to
    flexibly manage the computation functions in UAVs and/or MEC server, the emerging
    network function virtualization (NFV) can be utilized. However, efficient orchestration
    of the virtualized functions would be a challenge. In this paper, we consider
    a decentralized UAV-aided MEC system for smart agricultural applications in which
    the processing nodes benefit from the NFV technology. We aim to propose a method
    for efficiently orchestrating the NFVs while some important metrics are minimized,
    i.e., the age of information (AoI) and total network energy consumption. Especially,
    we consider the case in which the network state is not fully observable to the
    orchestrator or the observations are exposed to uncertainties. Consequently, the
    problem is formulated as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision
    process (DEC-POMDP). As the formulated problem is NP-complete, we exploit some
    structural features of the proposed scheme to introduce the concept of symmetry
    and simplify the problem. Then, a novel decentralized federated learning-based
    solution is proposed to solve the problem. Simulation results show the effectiveness
    of the proposed approach in minimizing the total network energy consumption and
    achieving AoI values less than 200:msec to support demanding real-time applications.

    IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction Smart farming in the contemporary
    world has gained paramount importance while playing a pivotal role in revolutionizing
    agricultural practices [1]. Conversely, the increasing global population along
    with environmental challenges have made the adoption of smart farming techniques
    indispensable. By leveraging data-driven insights, automation, and precision agriculture,
    smart farming not only enhances productivity but also addresses the pressing need
    for sustainable resource management [2]. On the other hand, the Internet of Things
    (IoT) has been a promising technology to provide connection among a large volume
    of devices that are deployed to provide a specific service for smart agriculture.
    A wide range of different use cases such as smart greenhouse monitoring, pest
    control, and irrigation/soil management can be considered [1], [3]. These use
    cases are mostly computation intensive and delay-sensitive [1], [4], [5]. A large
    volume of connected devices implies a large volume of data that must be processed
    accurately in a timely manner [6]. Such data computation and analysis demands
    a significant amount of processing and storage resources which put a constraint
    on energy-limited IoT devices. Depending on the specific application, the aggregated
    data from monitoring sensors, and captured images/videos from installed cameras
    in the field need to be processed in real-time to turn raw data into usable information.
    Introducing IoT and its applications in modern agriculture provides this industry
    with suitable tools to support farmers for better productivity, quality, and profitability
    [1]. Therefore, the scope of IoT extends beyond just agricultural land, encompassing
    a broader spectrum that includes the supply chain as well [7], [8]. Battery-operated
    IoT devices lack the capability to perform energy-intensive computations independently.
    Additionally, they face challenges related to limited processing power and storage
    capacity [9]. Therefore, MEC is proposed as a promising technology to address
    these limitations by offering additional computation and storage resources for
    IoT systems. This is achieved by providing servers where IoT devices can offload
    their computation tasks [10], [11]. On the other hand, large-scale agricultural
    operations often involve the distribution of IoT devices across expansive areas.
    In such scenarios, challenges may emerge concerning communication, particularly
    with issues related to the limited reachability between IoT devices and MEC infrastructure.
    To address these challenges, a proposed solution involves the integration of a
    network comprising unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to enhance the capabilities
    of MEC [12], [13]. This approach aims to mitigate communication limitations stemming
    from the constrained transmission power of IoT devices and simultaneously improve
    network coverage. Due to the easy-to-deploy, cost-effective, and strong capabilities
    of the UAVs, UAV-aided MEC has attracted much attention and is widely utilized
    in smart agriculture to provide a high-quality line-of-sight (LoS) link to IoT
    devices [1], [3], [5], [14], [15], [16], [17]. The versatility and mobility exhibited
    by UAVs in response to changing weather conditions, alongside their straightforward
    deployment and economically viable maintenance costs, collectively establish UAVs
    as a proficient solution for supplying IoT devices with the necessary resources.
    Nevertheless, the UAVs themselves are quite often battery-powered which means
    their available energy is limited [6]. 1) Age of Information Besides energy, the
    freshness of information is another important aspect that needs to be considered
    in environmental monitoring and smart agriculture applications in which rapid
    protective and/or recovery actions are needed. Being more specific, within the
    realm of environmental monitoring applications and precision farming [18] in a
    UAV-aided MEC network, the IoT devices are strategically dispersed throughout
    specified regions to seamlessly gather real-time environmental data. Then the
    collected and pre-processed data by the UAVs finds its transmission route toward
    a localized MEC server; where a comprehensive analysis is conducted to facilitate
    the extraction of pertinent insights. These insights, in turn, play a pivotal
    role in fostering prompt agricultural decision-making and actions. The objectives
    can be the refinement of operations, the performance optimization, or the reduction
    of expenditure [1], [14], [19]. This expansion of smart agriculture’s scope ensures
    a secure and sustainable food supply chain, underpinned by contextual and situational
    awareness derived from real-time event processing [20]. Accordingly, such applications
    are characterized by their intensive computational demands and time-sensitive
    nature [1], [3], [5], [14], [18]. Concisely, the freshness of information becomes
    a critical factor that demands careful consideration. Packet delay and inter-delivery
    times, as two exemplary metrics that are commonly used to quantify the performance
    of real-time applications, are not adequate to represent the freshness of information
    received at the destination. Recently, age of information (AoI) has been proposed
    as a novel criterion to quantitatively evaluate the freshness of information [6],
    [17], [21]. For a flow of data packets, and with emphasis on the freshness of
    data at the destination, AoI is defined as the time elapsed from receiving the
    most recent packet belonging to that data-packet flow [22], [23]. 2) Network Function
    Virtualization (NFV) From the above discussion, in the context of UAV-enabled
    smart agriculture paradigm – which constitutes the focal point of this paper –
    UAVs are confronted with a substantial amount of data necessitating prompt processing.
    This scenario embodies a dynamic computational framework wherein a bunch of processing
    functions demands seamless implementation across both the UAVs and the local server
    [20], [24], [25]. NFV is a key technology for implementing and managing computing
    machines in a reliable, efficient, and robust manner [26]. The NFV virtualizes
    the network functions (NFs) and abstracts them from the physical hardware, which
    enables rapid service function chaining (SFC) and service provisioning in UAV-aided
    MEC applications [27]. Considering the data-intensive and computation-based application
    of smart agriculture, multiple computing functions in the form of virtual network
    functions (VNF) should be deployed sequentially and orderly to provide the processed
    data for the final decision-making at the local MEC-server. Utilizing NFV significantly
    enhances the agility in deploying and managing network components and improves
    the robustness and scalability of networks [27], [28]. Therefore, a critical challenge
    to address is the optimal and efficient placement of Virtual Network Functions
    (VNFs) and determining how to route information packets among VNF components over
    the available NFV infrastructure, i.e., UAVs and the MEC server. The decision
    to distribute and allocate VNFs between both UAVs and the server, rather than
    solely on one of them, aligns with the primary goal of the proposed scheme—to
    minimize the Age of Information (AoI) while maintaining energy efficiency. Network
    traffic and the workload on both UAVs and MEC servers fluctuate over time, while
    changing channel conditions between the parties necessitate adjustments in the
    required communication resources for packet forwarding. Furthermore, certain processing
    functions, such as compression, may alter the packet size, so the trade-off of
    performing these functions locally and sending the smaller packets with spending
    fewer communication resources versus doing the entire processing locally becomes
    pivotal. Consequently, the placement must dynamically adjust to new conditions
    to ensure the minimization of AoI and energy efficiency [28]. In light of this,
    a general condition has been considered where the VNFO can, depending on network
    conditions (processing node resources, service type, and channel conditions),
    decide on the optimal placement to minimize AoI and energy consumption. The work
    presented in [24] is a use-case of the practical implementation of smart agriculture
    in real-world contexts; where, the authors leverage a confluence of cloud computing,
    edge computing, and NFV technology to conceive a comprehensive framework tailored
    to the essential demands of soilless precision farming practiced within a fully-recirculating
    greenhouse [24]. 3) Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) The VNF placement and
    scheduling in our network settings can be expressed as integer programming with
    some constraints that reflect the service requirements and the network infrastructure’s
    restrictions. Nevertheless, this problem is NP-complete and there is no standard
    solver that can solve such problems in polynomial time [29], especially for large-scale
    networks where the required computation to find the optimal solution increases
    exponentially. Recently, machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligent
    (AI) based solutions appear as a viable way to solve such complex problems in
    polynomial time [17], [29], [30]. Since its inception in 2017 [31], Federated
    Learning (FL) has reshaped many emerging intelligent IoT systems toward advanced
    FL architecture. The distributed nature of FL, where some agents cooperatively
    train a global ML model without directly sharing the local data, makes FL an attractive
    alternative to traditional centralized ML schemes. To be more specific, FL by
    pushing intelligent ML functions to the network edge enhances the privacy and
    scalability of IoT applications and networks [30]. In this paper, our focus is
    on use cases in smart agriculture that require live streaming and analysis, such
    as surveillance and environmental monitoring. Specifically, we address the flexible
    dynamic orchestration of NFV-enabled SFCs within the context of delay-sensitive
    services. The approach involves distributing VNFs across processing nodes, utilizing
    UAVs and local MEC server in a UAV-aided MEC network. The objective is to perform
    SFC while ensuring the freshness of information by jointly minimizing AoI and
    total energy consumption throughout the network. Condensing the system model and
    the definition of the problem, we present the following key insights: In the realm
    of smart agriculture applications, real-time information is collected by IoT devices
    on a smart farm and transmitted through hovering UAVs to the local server. VNFs
    must be executed sequentially on the raw packets, as they represent split functionalities
    of a single processing job. Meanwhile, certain VNFs, such as compression, may
    potentially alter packet sizes. Various service types are assumed, each with its
    specific VNF chain. The challenge involves determining the optimal placement and
    scheduling of VNF chains on processing nodes (UAVs and the local server), accounting
    for processing time, transmission delay, and power consumption (both transmit
    and processing power) in a distributed manner. We will demonstrate analytically
    that the problem: Exhibits circular symmetry, wherein the optimal policies of
    the agents (UAVs) are identical. The local observations of the agents serve as
    sufficient statistics for determining the optimal policy, We will show how these
    two features will simplify the problem significantly. Subsequently, we present
    a novel solution for solving the modeled problem. The main contributions of our
    paper are summarized as follows: To the best of our knowledge this is the first
    time that the problem of dynamic orchestration of NFV-enabled SFCs in a multi-hop
    UAV-aided MEC network for smart agriculture is considered, while the problem is
    formulated as a joint AoI and Energy minimization. We formulate this joint optimization
    problem as a decentralized partially observable MDP (DEC-POMDP), where the parties
    are not aware of the true state and just make decisions based on their local observations.
    We adopted the structural feature of the problem and have analytically shown that
    under the satisfaction of certain symmetry conditions, the local observation of
    the parties (agents) would be a sufficient statistic for determining the optimal
    solution. As the formulated problem is NP-complete, we proposed a novel FL-based
    algorithm called Asynchronous FL Deep Q-Network (AFDQN) in which a set of distributed
    parties learn in parallel and aggregate their own experience through a coordinator.
    A Multi-hop network is considered, where the UAVs can offload their computing
    tasks to the other UAVs as well as the local MEC server. The rest of the paper
    is organized as follows: In Section II some state-of-the-art studies will be reviewed.
    Section III describes the system model and the main components of the system in
    detail. Section IV presents the problem definition and formulation. In Section
    V, the problem is expressed as a DEC-POMDP, and some analytical results are given
    that support our proposed FL-based solution presented in Section VI. The complexity
    analysis of the proposed algorithm is presented in Section VII. The effectiveness
    and performance of the proposed scheme is demonstrated in Section VIII. Finally,
    Section IX concludes the paper. SECTION II. Related Works In this section, we
    review some state-of-the-art studies on AoI and energy-aware UAV-aided MEC for
    smart agriculture. The prospects of using UAVs for smart agriculture are immense.
    Moreover, UAVs are easy to deploy and cost-effective which motivates their use
    in smart agriculture [1], [6], [32]. For a comprehensive survey on IoT-based smart
    agriculture and the emerging technologies mentioned in the previous section refer
    to [1]. In [13], Mozaffari et al. have considered the reliable design of IoT’s
    uplink communication in a scenario in which multiple UAVs are deployed to collect
    data from ground IoT devices. In particular, a framework for jointly optimizing
    the trajectory of the UAVs, IoT-to-UAV association, and IoT’s uplink power is
    proposed with the aim of minimizing the total energy consumption and mobility
    of the UAVs. However, in the formulated problem, the delay of the forwarded data
    across the UAV network is not considered. Nguyen et al. [5] have considered this
    issue as the problem of processing deadline-critical tasks which are fed to a
    network of hovering UAVs that support the IoT devices deployed in a smart farm.
    It is assumed that the smart farm is equipped with a multi-access MEC infrastructure.
    In such a circumstance, the energy-efficient monitoring problem is modeled as
    a multi-objective maximization problem which aims to maximize the number of tasks
    that are successfully processed before their deadline. Then, a Q-Learning-based
    solution is proposed to solve the problem. The same authors in [5] have extended
    their proposed scheme to a DQN-based solution [33] and to a multi-actor-based
    risk-sensitive RL approach [32]. Although, the goal of the aforementioned studies
    is to minimize the energy consumption in the network, however, the proposed solutions
    are basically centralized and the communication overhead of the centralized approaches
    is itself a source of energy waste. The AoI as a metric for determining the freshness
    of information has been used in some recent works On UAV-aided IoT networks [6],
    [17], [23], [34], [35]. Buyukates and Ulukus [34] examined a status update system
    where update packets require processing to extract embedded useful information.
    The source node sends information to a computation unit (CU) with a master node
    and worker nodes. The master node assigns tasks, aggregates results, and sends
    them back to the source node for updating. The analysis focuses on the age performance
    of various schemes in the presence of stragglers, considering i.i.d. exponential
    transmission delays and i.i.d. shifted exponential computation times. Then, the
    best scheme that minimizes the average age is presented. In [35], the authors
    analyzed the average age of information (AoI) and average peak AoI (PAoI) in a
    multiuser Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) system. The system considers three computing
    schemes: local computing, edge computing, and partial computing (where the computational
    tasks are partially performed at the edge and the remaining is performed by the
    local server). To address the complexity, upper and lower bounds on average AoI
    are provided, enabling an examination of optimal offloading decisions based on
    MEC system parameters. In [6], Han et al. modeled a UAV-aided IoT network using
    a Markov chain. The freshness of data packets is defined using AoI and they analyzed
    the IoT devices as first-come-first-served (FCFS) model and M/M/1 queue. Sun et
    al. [17], employed AoI to propose an AoI-energy-aware data collection scheme for
    IoT networks in which the UAVs are used to collect data. Here, AoI is used to
    quantify the temporal correlation among data packets. Then, an algorithm for determining
    the UAV’s flight speed, hovering locations, and allocated bandwidth to IoT devices
    is proposed that jointly minimizes energy consumption and the weighted sum of
    expected average AoI in the network. In [23], a UAV-aided wireless powered IoT
    scheme is proposed, where a UAV flies from a data center toward IoT sensory nodes
    to transfer energy and collect their information and then it returns back to the
    data center. The goal is to minimize the average AoI of the collected data from
    sensor modes. For such circumstances, an optimization problem is formulated, and
    then a suboptimal method is proposed that first decomposes the problem into two
    subproblems. The solution to the first subproblem is the input for the second
    subproblem. It is worth mentioning that the AoI is basically an end-to-end metric;
    Hence, even though the aforementioned works try to minimize the AoI, for the use
    cases in smart agriculture that the captured data needs some live processing before
    being turned into useful information, these approaches are not effective as they
    just consider the problem of finding the best data flow path. In the context of
    UAV-aided MEC for IoT networks, each service can be represented as a service function
    chain (SFC) consisting of ordered processing functions in the form of VNFs that
    can be geographically placed on to local MEC-server or the UAVs. However, in a
    network with numerous IoT devices and dynamic network load, the placement of VNF
    instances and routing among them in an optimal and efficient manner is a challenging
    problem [27], [28]. In the literature, this problem is referred to as the SFC
    dynamic orchestration problem (SFC-DOP) [27]. In [27], Liu et al. presented a
    DRL-based framework for dynamic SFC orchestration in IoT networks. Huang et al.
    in [36] dealt with the problem of scalability and flexibility of static orchestration
    of NFV-enabled SFCs. Then, a FL-based SFC orchestration is proposed which is scalable
    and benefits from low communication cost. Table 1 presents an overview of the
    previously mentioned studies, emphasizing the main topics they concentrated on.
    Although, in the literature, the UAV-aided MEC architecture is mainly proposed
    as a technique to compensate for the energy and computational limitations of IoT
    networks, however, existing solutions for NFV-enabled SFC require IoT nodes to
    exchange large volumes of local data with a centralized server or among the distributed
    agents. Considering the energy limitation of IoT devices and battery-powered UAVs,
    this significantly causes waste of the network energy. In this paper, we deal
    with this inconsistency and propose a novel FL-based solution for the dynamic
    orchestration of SFCs in a multi-hop and UAV-aided MEC network. To the best of
    our knowledge, this is the first time that the problem of dynamic orchestration
    of NFV-enabled SFCs in a multi-hop UAV-aided MEC network is considered. What makes
    our approach unique is the adoption of the inherent structural aspects of the
    problem, typical in most scenarios, to introduce a decentralized solution that
    is analytically demonstrated to be valid. The proposed method is asynchronous
    FL-based, enabling distributed parties to independently learn locally and subsequently
    contribute to the training of the global model asynchronously [38], [39]. In other
    words, the parties are allowed to directly share gradients with the coordinator
    (here, the MEC server) after every local update and asynchronous of the other
    parties. This further enhances the training speed and efficiency of our proposed
    approach [39]. The coordinator in turn can perform the aggregation and update
    the global model whenever an update from one of the distributed parties is received.
    This approach improves the whole system’s scalability and alleviates the straggler
    impact, i.e., users who may have slower performance [38]. TABLE 1 Summary of Related

    We consider a real-time IoT network for smart agriculture applications, where,
    the IoT network provides real-time monitoring and visibility to network operators
    by video/image streaming. For such circumstances, several use cases from remote
    monitoring to security can be considered. As it is depicted in Fig. 1, a set N
    of N IoT devices collect real-time information from a smart farm and send the
    packets to a local server. A UAV-aided MEC architecture is considered, where packets
    are forwarded through an Aerial Network consisting of U hovering UAVs toward the
    local server. We consider applications in which some processing functions, from
    primary processes (e.g., compression) to advanced ones (e.g., object recognition)
    must be sequentially performed on the raw packets. Each IoT device is associated
    with one of the UAVs in its range. U denote the set of all U UAVs in the network.
    The local server is indeed a MEC-server1 denoted by M . A set S={ S k } K k=1
    with |S|=K different service types is assumed. Each service type S k itself consists
    of a set F k ={ F k f } F k f=1 including F k different processing functions that
    should be performed on the packets of that service and F denotes a set of all
    processing functions of all services, F= ⋃ k∈S ( F k ) . The input and output
    packet sizes of the function f of service type k are ρ k f and ϱ k f , respectively.
    FIGURE 1. System model. Show All Let s k n ∈{0,1} denote the service type k∈S
    in IoT node n∈N is active, s k n =1 , or not, s k n =0 . In each IoT node one
    of the K different services is running, ∑ k∈S s k n =1,∀n∈N . To perform the processing
    functions, the MEC-server M and each UAV u is able to run F= ∑ k∈S F k different
    VNF types on their physical computing machine.2 The proposed architecture is based
    on ETSI-NFV standard [40] which is a globally accepted architecture for implementing
    the NFV. According to ETSI-NFV, in each physical machine (processing node) p∈U∪M
    (All U UAVs and the local server M), the VNF manager (VNFM) is responsible to
    manage its computing and storage resources among the VNFs it hosts. The total
    available resources at processing node p is indicated by C p , the computing capacity
    in Hz, and B p , the memory capacity in Byte. The VNF orchestrator (VNFO), hosted
    by the local server, places and schedules the chain of VNFs through Aerial Domain
    and Local (MEC) Server. For a summary of the key symbols and variables used in
    the system model and problem formulation, refer to Table 2. TABLE 2 Key Symbols
    and Variables B. VNF Placement and Scheduling We consider a discrete-time system
    with two hierarchical timing levels. First, the time is divided into equal time
    slots TS with duration T indexed by t=1,2,… . On top of that, we have the VNF-scheduling
    time slots t ~ with duration T ˜ that is multiples of T , and it is a single round
    of VNF placement and scheduling update. At the beginning of each time slot t ~
    , the VNFO updates the VNF placements. Each UAV u segregates data packets from
    IoT nodes sharing the same service type, say k , into a packet-flow Υ k u (t)
    , which it then transmits across the aerial network to the local server. The set
    F k ={ V fk } F k f=1 of F k different VNFs (processing functions) must be performed
    on data packets of the IoT nodes with service type k . At the beginning of each
    VNFO-level time slot t ~ , the VNFO determines the set of processing nodes Δ k
    u ( t ~ ) that participate in serving the k th service packet-flow Υ k u (t) of
    UAV u at t th TS. Each selected processing node p∈U∪M that belongs to Δ k u (
    t ~ ) performs a subset B k up ( t ~ ) of all functions F k that is supposed to
    be performed on the packet flow of service type k belongs to UAV u : B k up (
    t ~ )={ F k f  :  f ˙ k up ≤f≤ f ¨ k up }, B k up ( t ~ )⊆ F k , (1) View Source
    where f ˙ k up (S) and f ¨ k up (E) are the first and the last function (VNF)
    that p performs on the packet flow of service type k of UAV u . In summary, for
    each packet-flow Υ k u (t) , the VNFO selects and schedules the processing nodes
    that handle F k . These nodes can be each one of any other UAVs (intra-domain
    offloading) or local server (inter-domain offloading). Remark 1:Let P to−do p
    ( t ~ )={(u,k,f) : f∈ F k u is running on p} indicate a set of all assigned VNFs
    to the processing node p∈U∪M . We assume all assigned VNFs P to−do p ( t ~ ) to
    processing node p should be finished in a single round of VNF scheduling t ~ .
    Fig. 2 provides a comprehensive representation of crucial elements related to
    the proposed orchestration solution and the communication dynamics within the
    network. Operating at two distinct timing levels, the figure elucidates: 1) The
    VNFO timing (Tier 1), emphasizing interactions pivotal for establishing the proposed
    orchestration solution, and 2) the network-wide communication (Tier 2), encompassing
    all entities within the network. FIGURE 2. Network-wide timing model. Show All
    The upper segment of the figure illustrates how UAV 1 manages received packet
    flows from IoT nodes, accommodating two distinct service types. Following the
    assumed VNFO policy in a single round of VNF placement and scheduling, it is evident
    that for packets of service type 1, UAV1 processes them and subsequently forwards
    them to UAV3. UAV3, after performing the assigned VNFs, then forwards the packets
    to the local server, i.e., the final destination. Conversely, for packets of service
    type 2, UAV1 initiates some initial processing and then directly forwards them
    to the local server, where all remaining VNFs are executed. The lower section
    of the figure is dedicated to illustrating VNFO level operation, depicting control
    packets exchanged between the local server and agents for the training of the
    VNFO model. Further clarification on this VNFO communication is postponed to subsequent
    sections within the article. C. Communication (Access) Network There are three
    communication links among the network nodes: the wireless links between IoT nodes
    and an aerial network consisting of UAVs, the UAV-to-UAV wireless links, and the
    wireless link between the UAVs and the local terrestrial server. Let random process
    g nu (t)∈C denote the channel loss between IoT node n∈N and UAV u∈U , then the
    achievable bit rate of node n in up-link direction at time instant t will be R
    nu (t)= w n log 2 (1+ p nu | g nu (t)| σ 2 ),∀n∈N,u∈U , where w n and σ 2 denote
    the channel bandwidth of IoT device n and the noise variance, respectively, and
    p nu is the transmission power level. The channel between IoT nodes and UAVs and
    between UAVs and the local server can be modeled as an air-to-ground channel model
    [41]. According to this model, the path loss, g nu can be calculated as [37],
    g nu (t)= ( 4πf c ) 2 d 2 (t) η e , (2) View Source where f , c , and d are frequency
    of operation, speed of light, and distance between the transmitter and receiver,
    respectively; and η e is the average of excessive path loss in two cases of existing
    a LoS path, η LoS e , and non-LoS case, η nLoS e , η e = p LoS × η LoS e +(1−
    p LoS )× η nLoS e , (3) View Source where p LoS is the probability that a LoS
    path exists and can be closely approximated as [37], p LoS = 1 1+aexp−b(ψ−a) ,
    (4) View Source where, a and b are environment-related parameters. Similarly,
    in the downlink direction, the achievable bit rate of the link between UAV u∈U
    and MEC server M at time instant t will be R uM (t)= w uM log 2 (1+ p uM | g uM
    (t)| σ 2 ),∀u∈U , where w uM denotes the channel bandwidth, σ 2 is the noise variance,
    p uM is the transmission power level, and random process g uM (t)∈C denotes the
    channel Loss at time t . Finally, the UAV-to-UAV wireless channel also follows
    the same mathematical model, however, the only difference is that the probability
    of existing LoS is equal to 1, p LoS =1 . For each UAV u and service type k ,
    τ k u (t) is defined as the expectation value of IoT access network delay with
    respect to transmission rate R nu (t) , τ k u (t)= E R nu [ τ k nu (t)], τ k nu
    (t)= D nu /C+ Λ k nu / R nu (t), (5) View Source where, E R nu denotes the expectation
    with respect to R nu , D nu is distance between IoT node n∈N and UAV u∈U and Λ
    k nu is the packet length of service type S k ∈S . For the aerial radio links,
    Let random process g u u ´ (t)∈C denote the channel power gain between UAV u∈U
    and UAV (or local server M) u ´ ∈U∪M , then the achievable bit rate of the link
    at time instant t will be R u u ´ = w u u ´ log 2 (1+ p u u ´ | g u u ´ (t)| σ
    2 ),∀n∈N,u∈U∪M , where w u u ´ denote the channel bandwidth between UAV u , and
    UAV (or local server) u ´ , σ 2 is the noise variance, and p u u ´ is the transmission
    power level. In the following sections, we will focus on the VNFO’s functionality,
    and resource allocation of the radio access part is beyond the scope of this paper;
    hence, without loss of generality, we assume a fixed power and bandwidth allocated
    to all the participating nodes. SECTION IV. Problem Formulation Let χ fk pu (
    t ~ )∈{0,1} denote whether the processing node p at time slot t is selected to
    run VNF function f on the packet of the k th service type of UAV u : χ fk pu (
    t ~ )= { 1, 0, if p∈ Δ k u ( t ~ )andf∈ B k pu ( t ~ ) otherwise ∀k∈S,u∈U. (6)
    View Source For each service type k∈S of UAV u , only one of the processing nodes
    (UAVs or MEC-server) must be selected for serving each function f∈ F k : ∑ p∈U∪M
    χ fk pu ( t ~ )=1,∀f∈ F k , ∑ p∈U∪M χ fk pu ( t ~ )=0,∀f∄ F k . (7) View Source
    The relation (7), both left and right expressions together, implies that the packets
    belonging to the service packet-flows travel a loop-free route. Each packet belongs
    to packet-flow Υ k u (t) needs a specific computational capacity c fk in CPU cycle.
    Assuming that all the processing capacity of processing node p in a single time
    slot with duration T ˜ is C p T ˜ , to be assured that the computing capacity
    of the selected processing node is enough to serve the assigned VNFs and the scheduler
    does not exceed the processing node’s budget, the following condition at each
    VNF-scheduling time slot t ~ should be satisfied: ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S ∑ f∈ F k 1 P to−do
    p ( t ~ ) (u,k,f) c fk ≤ C p T ˜ ,∀p∈U∪M. (8) View Source The same condition also
    needs to be fulfilled regarding the storage capacity requirement b fk (in Bytes):
    ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S ∑ f∈ F k 1 P to−do p ( t ~ ) (u,k,f) b fk ≤ B p ,∀p∈U∪M (9) View Source
    where B p is the total amount of available storage capacity of the processing
    node p . A. Age of Information In order to quantify the freshness of the received
    packet at the destination, the AoI metric is adopted. As soon as an IoT node has
    a packet to send, it connects to its serving UAV and sends packets.3 For each
    packet flow of service type k that UAV u∈U receives directly from the IoT nodes
    that are connected to it and running this service type, the arrival time t k u
    is defined as the time elapsed from the beginning of the time slot t in which
    any packet has arrived in. Let Θ k u (t) denote the AoI of the packet-flow of
    service type k in UAV u , it can be calculated as, Θ k u (t)={ τ k u +T− t k u
    , Θ k u (t−1)+T, if  α k u (t)=1 if  α k u (t)=0 ∀k∈S,u∈U (10) View Source where
    binary variable α k u (t)∈{0,1} indicates whether any new packet of service flow
    k at TS t is received, α k u (t)=1 , or not, α k u (t)=0 . By definition, for
    every time slot t in which the UAV does not receive a new packet from a service
    packet flow, the AoI of that service packet flow increases by T . On each received
    packet from IoT node n with service type k , the set F n k of VNFs (processing
    functions) should be performed. As stated above, the VNFO determines the set of
    processing nodes p∈ Δ k u ( t ~ ) that participate in performing the VNFs on packet-flow
    Υ k u (t) by performing the set B k up ( t ~ ) of VNFs. B k up ( t ~ )=∅ means
    p hosts none of the required VNFs of Υ k u (t) . Let Δ k u ( t ~ )={ p 1 , p 2
    ,…, p L } denote the sequence of all UAVs that are already selected to sequentially
    do the chain of VNFs on the received packets of service type k . The processing
    time of every packet of this flow will be, Φ k u (t)= ∑ p v ∈ Δ k u ( t ~ ) ⎛
    ⎝ ⎜ ⌈ τ fk p v−i p v (t) T ⌉T+ ∑ ϑ∈ B k u p v ( t ~ ) (⌈ θ k ϑ T ⌉T ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ), ∀k∈S,u∈U
    τ fk p v−i p v (t)= D p v−i p v /C+ Λ p v−i p v ( F k f )/ R p v−i p v (t) F k
    f = f ¨ k u p v−i , (11) View Source where θ k ϑ is the run time of ϑ th VNF for
    service type k , Λ p v−i p v ( F k f ) is the packet length of service type S
    k ∈S after doing the last VNF f ¨ k u p v−1 of the chain in p v−1 , and, Assuming
    that the queueing delay is negligible, τ fk p v−1 p v is total transmission delay
    between p v−1 and p v consists of propagation delay and transmission delay. If
    the binary variable β k u ( t ~ )∈{0,1} indicates whether the VNF scheduling (at
    VNF-scheduling time slots t ~ ) for the flow of packets belong to service type
    k of UAV u was successful, then, the AoI at the Local server will be, Π k u (t)={
    Θ k u (t)+ Φ k u (t), Π k u (t−1)+ T ˜ , if  β k u ( t ~ )=1 if β k u ( t ~ )=0
    ∀k∈S,u∈U. (12) View Source Note that T ˜ is the duration of a single round of
    VNF placement and scheduling. B. Energy Consumption The energy consumption of
    the network in the uplink direction can be calculated as, P UL (t)= ∑ n∈N ∑ k∈S
    ∑ u∈U s k n p nu Λ k nu / R nu (t), (13) View Source where Λ k nu / R nu (t) is
    the transmission time between IoT node n , with service type k , and UAV u at
    TS t . The other energy-consuming part of the access network is transmission among
    the processing nodes. If we represent the energy consumption in the aerial domain
    (including UAV-to-UAV and UAV-to-MEC links) at TS t with P Aerial (t) , then it
    will be as, P Aerial (t)= τ fk p v−i p v (t)= F k f = ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S ∑ p v ∈ Δ k
    u p p v−i p v τ fk p v−i p v (t), D p v−i p v /C+ Λ p v−i p v ( F k f )/ R p v−i
    p v (t), f ¨ k u p v−i , (14) View Source where Λ p v−i p v ( F k f ) , f ¨ k
    u p v−1 and τ fk p v−1 p v are defined like (11). Finally, if Ψ k ϑ denotes the
    power each machine, that hosts the ϑ th VNF of service type k , consumes to run
    this VNF on each packet of this service type, then, the total network-wide required
    energy for performing the VNFs across a single packet of all service type can
    be calculated as follows: P NFV = ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S ∑ p v ∈ Δ k u ∑ ϑ∈ B k u p v Ψ k
    ϑ θ k ϑ . (15) View Source In a single term, P NFV represents the energy consumption
    resulting from VNFs processing. Using (13)–(15), the total energy consumption
    of the network to process a single packet across all the service types belonging
    to all UAVs would be, P Total (t)= P UL (t)+ P Aerial (t)+ P NFV . (16) View Source
    The UAVs use a battery, hence their available energy to do the processes and perform
    the required communications is limited. Therefore, we need an energy-efficient
    VNFO solution with minimum communication overhead. A centralized ML method will
    be optimal, but it requires a large communication transaction to share the local
    observation with the central controller. Another drawback of adopting centralized
    architecture is that the centralized coordinator is not scalable and from the
    processing and communication viewpoint is a single point of failure. Therefore,
    in this paper, we deal with proposing a solution for the following problem of
    distributed NFV orchestration through the UAVs as distributed VNFO agents. Problem
    1 (Distributed VNFO for Joint AoI and Energy Minimization):Considering the service
    requirements of IoT nodes, UAVs/MEC-server available resources, and the condition
    of access networks, what is the optimal strategy of VNF placement and scheduling
    in each UAV to jointly minimize the average AoI and total energy consumption at
    the Local Server: Minimize χ fk pu ( t ~ ) s.t. γ AoI [ 1 UK ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S Π k u
    (t)]+ γ E P total (t), ∑ p∈U∪M χ fk pu ( t ~ )=1,∀f∈ F k , ∑ p∈U∪M χ fk pu ( t

    ∀p∈U∪M, ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S ∑ f∈ F k 1 P to−do p ( t ~ ) (u,k,f) b fk ≤ B p , ∀p∈U∪M.
    (17) View Source In each VNFO-level time slot T ˜ the orchestrator sequentially
    decides on the chain of VNFs of the service flows belonging to UAVs. For a class
    of stochastic sequential decision-making problems, the Markov Decision Process
    (MDP) has been a powerful framework for the mathematical formulation and study
    of this type of problems. Another point that is worth mentioning is that our proposed
    method in Section VI is FL-based where the UAVs follow the same model trained
    cooperatively. Therefore, minimizing the average AoI over UAVs or minimizing the
    maximum value of AoI over UAVs are basically the same. Depending on the environment
    state, the MDP output will be the best action (or at least the best upon the history
    of the observations and actions) which maximizes a specific utility function [42].
    For the case that the state is not fully observable to the deciding agent or the
    agent’s observations are exposed to noise or some source (sort) of uncertainties,
    another extended class of decision-making processes called Partially Observable
    MDP (POMDP) is adopted [43]. Both MDP and POMDP in their original scope are defined
    centralized [42], [43]. Partially Observable Stochastic Game (POSG) is the extended
    version of POMDP in which a set of distributed agents are involved in the decision-making
    process [44], [45]. By definition, if every agent has the same individual reward
    function, the POSG model becomes the Decentralized POMDP (DEC-POMDP) [45]. In
    the following two sections, first, we show how the problem can be modeled as a
    DEC-POMDP and then we will present our proposed method to solve the developed
    DEC-POMDP. SECTION V. DEC-POMDP Formulation In a multi-agent MDP with state uncertainty,
    a DEC-POMDP is formally defined as a tuple with the following definition. Definition
    1 (DEC-POMDP Model):DEC-POMDP G with a set U of U agents is defined as a tuple
    G=⟨U,S, b 0 ,A,O,T,O,R⟩ , where S is the finite set of global environment states,
    b 0 is the probability of the environment initially being in state s∈S , A= ∏
    u∈U A u is the joint action of all agents, where A u is the set of actions available
    to agent u , O= ∏ u∈U O u is joint observation, where O u is the observations
    available to agent u , T is the transition function T :  ⋃ s∈S (s×A(s))×S→[0,1]
    , where T( s ´ |s,A(s)) is defined as the transition probability from state s
    to s ´ by doing joint action A(s) , O is the observation function O :  ⋃ s∈S (s×A(s))×O→[0,1]
    , where O(O|s,A(s)) is defined as the joint observation at state s by doing joint
    action A(s) , R={ r u } U−1 u=0 is a set of reward functions r u  :  ⋃ s∈S (s×A(s))→R
    , where r u (s,A(s)) is defined as the reward received by u when A(s) is executed
    at the global state s . In a DEC-POMDP, each agent u∈U based on its local observation
    o u ∈ O u and a local policy π u performs an independent action a u ∈ A u . In
    each partially observable state s , the joint action A(s)= ∏ u∈U a u (s) from
    the joint policy P= ∏ u∈U π u determines the next global state s ´ and joint observations
    O according to transition and observation probability of T( s ´ |s,A(s)) and O(O|s,A(s))
    , respectively. According to Problem 1, our purpose is to find the best choice
    for the sets Δ k u (t) of processing nodes p and B k up (t) of the VNF chains
    for serving packet-flow Υ k u (t) of any service type k∈S of UAVs u∈U in a distributed
    manner. Remark 2 (Source of Uncertainties):We have considered a multi-hop network
    architecture, as depicted in Fig. 3, in which, 1) each agent u is not aware of
    the other agents’ observation o −u  (−u refers to all the agents except u , o
    −u = ∏ u ´ ≠u o u ´ ) , nor the action a −u ,4 2) each agent observes the result
    of doing its own action and the actions of the other agents, while it is not aware
    of the global state nor the action of the other agents. Therefore, according to
    Definition 1, it can be inferred that Problem 1 in its decentralized form is a
    DEC-POMDP. FIGURE 3. System model as a DEC-POMDP. Show All In DEC-POMDP, each
    agent based on its actions and observations creates a local database that in time
    t can be represented as h u ( t ~ )={ a u ( t ~ −1), o u ( t ~ ) } t ~ t ~ =1
    ,∀u∈U , where a u ( t ~ −1) and o u ( t ~ ) are the action of u at time slot t
    ~ −1 and its corresponding observation at t ~ . All the information is available
    to all the U agents at time t ~ defines as the joint history H( t ~ )= ∏ u∈U h
    u ( t ~ )={A( t ~ −1),O( t ~ ) } t ~ t ~ =1 . The POMDP state is hidden from the
    agents. Hence, the agents would not be able to choose their actions based on knowing
    the true state. The standard approach for dealing with POMDPs is to find a solution
    to the fully observable equivalent belief-MDP [43]. Where, belief B(s, t ~ )=P(s(
    t ~ )=s|H( t ~ ),B(0)),∀s∈S defines as a probability distribution over the state
    space of the original POMDP knowing the joint history H( t ~ ) , i.e., all the
    available information from the sequence of interactions that the agents have had
    until now,where B(0) is the initial value the belief state function. Belief state
    function B(s, t ~ ) is known as sufficient statistic for the history H( t ~ )
    [45]. Upon performing a new interaction at t ~ +1 , the belief value is updated
    from the belief point at time t considering the new interaction {A( t ~ −1),O(
    t ~ )} . Despite the current hidden state, in DEC-POMDP the agents need to infer
    the action (the policy) of the other agents. This leads to the definition of multi-agent
    belief function [46] with the following definition, b u  :  ⋃ s∈S (s× π −u (s))→[0,1],∀u∈U
    b u, t ~ (s, π −u )=P(s( t ~ )=s, π −u | h u ( t ~ ), b u (0)), π −u = ∏ u ´ ∈U,
    u ´ ≠u π u ´ . (18) View Source As it is evident, the multi-agent belief function
    is defined in a space that is a combination of the hidden global state s and joint
    policy π −u of the other agents. From Bellman expectation equation [47], the action-value
    function Q π u, t ~ [(s, π −u ), a π u ] is the expected return starting from
    state hidden state s , taking action a π u according to policy π u , while the
    other agents follow the joint policy π −u , Q π u, t ~ [(s, π −u ), a π u, t ~
    ]= E{ R u [(s, π −u ), a π u, t ~ ] + γ u Q π u, t ~ +1 [( s ´ , π −u ), a π u,
    t ~ +1 ]}. (19) View Source where the action-value function decomposed into immediate
    reward plus discounted action-value of the successor state, and γ u is the discount
    factor of agent u . With some mathematical manipulation, (19) can be written as,
    Q π u, t ~ [(s, π −u ), a π u, t ~ ]= R u [(s, π −u ), a π u, t ~ ] + γ u ∑ (
    o u , o −u )∈O O[ o u , o −u |s,( a π u , a −π −u )] ∑ s ´ ∈S T[ s ´ |s,( a −π
    −u )] × ∑ ( a π u , a −π −u )∈A π u ( a π u | s ´ ) Q π u,t [( s ´ , π −u ( o
    −u )), a ´ π u, t ~ +1 ( o u )]. (20) View Source Using (18), for a given belief
    state function b u, t ~ (s, π −u ) , the action-value function Q π u, t ~ ( b
    u, t ~ , a π u, t ~ ) will be, Q π u, t ~ ( b u, t ~ , a π u, t ~ )= ∑ s∈S ∑ π
    −u b u, t ~ (s, π −u ) Q π u, t ~ [(s, π −u ), a π u, t ~ ]. (21) View Source
    For an enough large value of t ~  ( t ~ →∞) , the goal is to find the optimal
    policy π ∗ u among available policies π u which leads to the optimal Q-value (action-value)
    function, Q ∗ u, t ~ ( b u, t ~ , a u, t ~ )=arg max π Q π u, t ~ ( b u, t ~ ,
    a π u, t ~ ). (22) View Source There is no straightforward solution for the aforementioned
    DEC-POMDP problem. Among decentralized methods, multi-agent solutions also need
    a large volume of communication overhead between the agents to share their local
    observations to converge. FL does not have the communication overhead of the centralized
    techniques and also does not necessitate the agents to share all of the data and
    local observations to converge. Although this specification is for providing privacy,
    in our problem it provides us with the gain of energy efficiency that arises because
    the agents (UAVs) do not need to share all of their observations. A few efforts,
    [45], [48], [49], have been made in the literature to capture and exploit some
    structural specifications of the understudied system (application) to find or
    at least simplify the problem of finding optimal policy (22). One of these works
    is one presented by Yongacoglu et al. [48], in which the authors have developed
    a class of POSGs that is characterized by symmetry across players in terms of
    cost and state dynamics. In view of this research, within the APPENDIX, we introduce
    a class of Symmetric DEC-POMDP and prove that Problem 1belongs to this class and
    is Circularly Symmetric. This implies that the best agents’ policy, π ∗ are the
    same, { π u } U−1 u=0 = π ∗ . In essence, this necessitates a distributed solution
    to determine the best policy while ensuring uniformity across all agents. Furthermore,
    in accordance with the circular symmetry characteristic of the problem, in Corollary
    22 we prove that local observations serve as sufficient statistics for each agent
    to ascertain the best policy. Corollary 22 guarantees that the local observation
    h u ( t ~ ) serves as a sufficient statistic to determine the optimal policy π
    ∗ for the agents (UAVs). This implies that the information encapsulated in the
    local observations of the individual agents is comprehensive enough to determine
    the optimal policy π ∗ . While this corollary does not suggest a particular method
    for identifying the optimal policy, it is promising and justifies our proposed
    FL-based algorithm in which the agents collaboratively engage in training a globally
    shared model. This approach aligns with the notion that leveraging decentralized
    insights from each agent’s local observations can contribute to the derivation
    of an effective and globally optimal policy because their observations are sufficient
    statistics. Capitalizing on the promising findings in this section, the subsequent
    section introduces our proposed approach to address Problem 1. SECTION VI. Symmetry-aided
    Asynchronous Federated DQN Framework In this section, we introduce our proposed
    Asynchronous Federated Deep Q-Network (AFDQN) algorithm and the components we
    have used in the proposed model as depicted in Fig. 4. In traditional RL, the
    problem is modeled as an MDP consisting of a tuple {s( t ~ ),a( t ~ ),r( t ~ ),s(
    t ~ +1)} . At each decision-making time t ~ , the agent is at state s( t ~ ) and
    takes an action a( t ~ ) based on a policy π that causes a state transition from
    s( t ~ ) to s( t ~ +1) while an immediate reward r( t ~ ) incurred. For our POMDP
    case in which the true state of the network is hidden, the true state s( t ~ )
    is replaced with belief-state b( t ~ ) . Mainly, the RL aims to guide the agent
    to find the best policy π ∗ defined as the best mapping from observation o( t
    ~ ) to action a( t ~ ) that maximizes the expected cumulative discounted future
    rewards R( t ~ )= E π { ∑ ∞ l=t γ (l− t ~ ) r(l)} , where γ∈[0,1] is a discount
    factor indicating how much future rewards is important. For our DEC-POMDP problem,
    this relation maps to (19). FIGURE 4. Block diagram of the proposed Asynchronous
    Federated-DQN (AFDQN). Show All A. Deep Q-Network (DQN) Part To estimate Q-value
    functions (21), deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is deployed, where Q-values
    are predicted using deep neural networks (DNNs) as function approximators. The
    estimated Q -functions are represented by { Q u ( o u ( t ~ ), a u ( t ~ ); θ
    u ( t ~ )) } U−1 u=0 , where the parameter θ u ( t ~ ) represents the weights
    of the agent u ’s neural network (NN). The updated value of θ u ( t ~ ) is used
    to approximate the true values of Q u ( t ~ ) [21], [50]. Let’s define the loss
    function L( θ u ( t ~ )) as the expectation value of the mean squared error of
    the estimated Q-value Q u ( o u ( t ~ ), a u ( t ~ ); θ u ( t ~ )) from the target
    value y( t ~ ) [21], L( θ u ( t ~ ))=E[(y( t ~ )− Q u ( o u ( t ~ ), a u ( t ~
    ); θ u ( t ~ )) ) 2 ], (23) View Source where, y( t ~ )= r u ( t ~ )+γ max a u
    ( t ~ +1) Q u ( o u ( t ~ +1), a u ( t ~ +1); θ u ( t ~ )) and a u ( t ~ +1) indicates
    the agent’s action generated by the DNN at t ~ +1 , given the observation o u
    ( t ~ +1) . At each iteration, the deep Q -function approximator is trained to
    learn the best estimate of the Q-function by minimizing the loss function L( θ
    u ( t ~ )) . To improve the stability of the algorithm and cope with samples correlation,
    as depicted in Fig. 4, two novel techniques, namely Fixed Target Network [51]
    and Experience Replay Buffer [52] are deployed, respectively. Utilizing these
    two techniques, the loss function L( θ u ( t ~ )) can be written as L( θ u ( t
    ~ )) = E D [( r u ( t ~ )+γ max a u ( t ~ +1) Q u (b( t ~ +1), a u ( t ~ +1);
    θ ´ u ( t ~ )) − Q u ( o u ( t ~ ), a u ( t ~ ); θ u ( t ~ )) ) 2 ], (24) View
    Source where θ ´ u ( t ~ ) denotes the target network parameters, and the expectation
    E D is taken over the randomly selected mini-batches of samples from the replay
    buffer D . B. Federated Learning Part As it is illustrated in Fig. 4, we have
    two main entities, the set U={0,1,…,U−1} of UAVs that are our distributed agents
    or in FL terminology, the agents, and the coordinator that in our model is local
    server (MEC-server). FL allows the UAVs (agents) to train a shared global model
    parameterized by θ g that is an exact copy of the agents’ local model { θ u }
    u=U−1 u=0 using their own dataset { D u } u=U−1 u=0 , while the original data
    remains in UAVs. After local training, agents share their local model updates
    with the coordinator. The coordinator then aggregates the received updates to
    build the global model θ g . As a result, relying on the distributed data training
    at the agents, the local server is able to enhance the training performance without
    significant communication overhead as it just needs an update of the local model
    parameters, not the agents’ local data. The federated learning procedure of our
    proposed method includes the following key steps. 1) Distributed Local Training
    Primarily, the local server initializes the global model, θ g,0 , and transmit
    it to the agents. Upon receiving θ g,0 , during VNFO time slots t ~ the agents
    interact with environment and train their local model { θ u ( t ~ ) } u=U−1 u=0
    using their own data set { D u ( t ~ ) } u=U−1 u=0 by minimizing a loss function
    { L u ( θ u ( t ~ )) } u=U−1 u=0 , θ ∗ u =arg min π u L u ( θ u (( t ~ ))),∀u∈U.
    (25) View Source Then, the agents upload their local update on { θ u ( t ~ ) }
    u=U−1 u=0 to the coordinator for aggregation. 2) Model Aggregation After collecting
    the agents’ local model updates, the next step is aggregating them into a new
    version of the global model which is performed by the coordinator by solving the
    following optimization problem. Problem 2 (Model Aggregation):Given the local
    model updates { θ u ( t ~ ) } u=U−1 u=0 of all agents, and knowing the local loss
    functions { L u (⋅) } u=U−1 u=0 , what is the optimal strategy for aggregating
    the local model that minimizes the global loss, θ ∗ g , L ∗ g =arg min L g , θ
    g L g ( ∏ u∈U L u ( θ g (( t ~ )))). (26) View Source According to Problem 2,
    θ ∗ g is the optimal value for θ g with having the local updates in hand; and
    L ∗ g is the best function (the best method) for aggregating the local loss function.
    The loss-aggregation function L ∗ g indicates the relative contribution of each
    agent on the global model, however, there is not a fixed method for determining
    this function and it depends mostly on the structure and specific features of
    the problem. Corollary 1:According to Lemma 2, The best setting for loss functions
    is (24) and { L u (⋅) } u=U−1 u=0 =L(⋅) , The optimal way for aggregating the
    local updates is averaging among the agent’s contributions, thus (25) can be rewritten
    as, θ ∗ g = ∑ u∈U ω u θ u , where ω u represents the relative contribution of
    each agent on the global model. After the derivation of a new update of θ g the
    coordinator broadcasts it to all agents. Upon receiving the update from the coordinator,
    the agents upgrade their local model accordingly. Until achieving a predefined
    level of accuracy or convergence of the global loss function, this process is
    continued. C. Asynchronous Networking The communication among the network entities
    follows the time slots t , but slot scheduling in which the agents share their
    own local model with the coordinator is distributed and asynchronous. Upon receiving
    an update, the coordinator aggregates it with the global model and updates the
    agents with the newly updated global model. In this way, we do not impose a strict
    constraint on synchronous communication with the local server (the coordinator).
    This significantly decreases the networking overhead in comparison with synchronous
    federation among distributed agents. During the training phase, we consider episodes
    in which the agent presets to a random initialization setting and starts interaction
    with the environment, and learns from its experience. Each episode contains T
    ˆ VNF scheduling round t ~ . In the deployment phase, the stream of packets that
    belong to different services is assigned based on an optimally determined VNF
    placement/scheduling policy. To avoid service interruption any fine-tuning and
    policy adaption to environmental changes, including the time the algorithm spends
    on fine-tuning and finding the optimal solution by coordinating multiple agents
    to train the global model, can be done in parallel. Definition 2 (Global Update
    Period):global update period 1≤η≤ T ˆ is defined as the period of updating the
    coordinator by the agents. We have two special settings, AFDQN-SGD ( η=1 ): In
    this case, every VNF scheduling slot t ~ , the agent sends the locally calculated
    SGD, ∇ θ L u ( θ u ( t ~ )) to the coordinator. Then, the coordinator uses the
    received local data to perform one step of gradient descent: θ g ( t ~ +1)= θ
    g ( t ~ )− γ ˙ ∇ θ L u ( θ u ( t ~ )). (27) View Source AFDQN-Avg ( η= T ˆ ):
    In this case, only one time during each episode, the agent sends the whole parameter
    θ u ( t ~ ) to the coordinator. Then, the coordinator updates θ g ( t ~ ) accordingly,
    θ g ( t ~ +1)=(1− γ ¨ ) θ g ( t ~ )+ γ ¨ θ u ( t ~ ), (28) View Source where,
    γ ˙ and γ ¨ are AFDQN-SGD and AFDQN-Avg forgetting factors, respectively. Introducing
    the forgetting factors γ ˙ and γ ¨ allows for the adjustment of learning rates
    during model updates. Rather than updating the global model instantly upon receiving
    a local update, it is beneficial to employ a weighted average approach, considering
    both the most recent update and the previous value of the Agent’s NN weight θ
    g . This approach, known as Asynchronous Weight Averaging [53] in the literature,
    proves advantageous in alleviating the impact of outdated updates, commonly referred
    to as stale weights, and consequently, it enhances overall stability. The only
    point is that the forgetting factors should be chosen small enough. Another worth
    mentioning point is that the AFDQN-SGD and a centralized approach doing mini-batch
    SGD in the local server are essentially different as the former is asynchronous,
    distributed, and fully based on local data. The details of the proposed AFDQN
    algorithm are described in Algorithm 1. Algorithm 1: AFDQN- η Algorithm Show All
    Considering our optimization problem, for each agent u∈U at VNF scheduling round

    function R u as follows: Observation: We define the observation space as a vector
    of: 1) CPU and storage requested by the local service flows { Υ k u (t)|t= t ~
    } k as { c fk (t)|t= t ~ } f,k and { b fk (t)|t= t ~ } f,k , respectively, 2)
    available CPU { C p } p and storage { B p } p of the processing nodes, 3) service
    arrival time { t k u } k , and 4) the transmission rate { R u p ´ } U∖ u ´ ∪M
    of the links between agent u and the other processing nodes. Therefore, the observation
    o u ( t ~ ) can be written as O u ( t ~ )= {{ c fk (t) } f,k ,{ b fk (t) } f,k
    , { C p } p ,{ B p } p ,{ t k u } k ,{ R u p ´ } U∖u⋃M } t= t ~ . (29) View Source

    scheduling result, AoI, and the energy consumption, respectively; ζ k u ( t ~
    ) is defined as the reward assigned to the result of NFV placement for service
    flow Υ k u (t)|t= t ~ . SECTION VII. Complexity Analysis In this section, we determine
    the computational complexity of the proposed Algorithm 1. We analyze the algorithm’s
    complexity through two distinct phases: Model Training and Action Selection, which
    occur during the deployment of the trained model. During each iteration of the
    global update period η , the process involves the training of local models by
    the agents (UAVs) and subsequently, the asynchronous aggregation of these local
    models by the MEC server to form the global model. The complexity of the local
    model training conducted by the agents can be expressed as the sum of two components:
    the complexity of action selection and the complexity of the back-propagation
    algorithm for each sample within the replay buffer. This sum is then further multiplied
    by the mini-batch size and η . It is worth noting that the multiplication by the
    mini-batch size accounts for the fact that, in each training iteration, the local
    agent randomly selects a mini-batch of samples from its own local replay buffer.
    The computational complexity of action selection in a fully connected neural network
    with a fixed number of hidden layers and neurons in each hidden layer is directly
    proportional to the sum of the input size and the output size of the neural network
    being used [54], [55]. The input size of the neural network is equivalent to the
    size of the state space, which from (29) is given by 2KF+2(U+1)+K+(U−1)+1 ; and,
    the output size of the neural network is equal to the size of the action space.
    which from (30) is given by KF(U+1) . It’s worth recalling that F= ∑ k∈S F k represents
    the overall count of distinct VNFs required to be executed across all service
    types. Hence, the computational complexity associated with action selection is
    represented by O(KFU) . Conversely, as indicated in equation [54], [55], for a
    specific sample extracted from the replay buffer, the computational complexity
    of the back-propagation process is directly proportional to the product of the
    neural network’s input and output sizes. Consequently, in our specific scenario,
    derived from the preceding computations, the overall algorithmic complexity for
    each agent can be expressed as O(ηO K 2 F 2 U) , where, O denotes the batch size.
    From Algorithm 1, each agent repeats the whole process of local model training
    η times preceding sharing the results with the local server. The last step is
    the aggregation process. While our algorithm conducts asynchronous aggregation,
    it’s important to note that the processing load escalates proportionally with
    the number of UAVs, U . As a result, the overall computational complexity for
    the training phase across the entire network is given by O(ηO F 2 K 2 U 2 ) .
    Based on the prior discussion, the complexity associated with the action selection
    for all U agents during the deployment phase is denoted as O(KF U 2 ) . SECTION
    VIII. Performance Evaluation In this section, the performance of the proposed
    algorithm is evaluated. The performance results are compared for four different
    methods of AFDQN-SGD, AFDQN-Avg, AFDQN with parameter η≠{1, T ˆ } , and a centralized
    case. In the centralized DQN method, all the observations are forwarded to the
    local server and the local server performs the VNF scheduling. Hence, its performance
    can be considered as an upper bound for the proposed AFDQN method. A. Simulation
    Setup The simulation is implemented by Python using OpenAI gym [56], a widely
    used tool for developing RL algorithms, and conducted in a computer with Intel
    Core i7–10700 CPU 2.90 GHz and 64 GB RAM. Using simulation, the impact of parameter
    η , the number of IoT nodes, and the effect of the received load by the agents
    are evaluated. To this purpose, while T ˆ =60 , five different values for the
    parameter of η consisting of 1 (corresponds to AFDQN-SGD), 10, 20, 30, and 60
    (corresponds to AFDQN-Avg) are considered. The other model parameters and simulation
    settings are summarized in Table 3 and Table 4. The proposed system model entirely
    matches none of the existing related works. However, the simulation parameters
    have been chosen to be in line with the typical values commonly used in similar
    studies within this context [6], [32], [33], [36], [37]. TABLE 3 Model Parameters
    and Simulation Settings Part I TABLE 4 Model Parameters and Simulation Settings
    Part II B. Simulation Results In Fig. 5, the convergence behavior of the AFDQN
    method is compared with the centralized method as a baseline. The two extreme
    cases of AFDQN-SGD and AFDQN-Avg are considered. As is evident from this figure,
    for the AFDQN method we have some variations around the value where it converged.
    The absolute value of these variations in AFDQN-Avg is more than AFDQ-SGD, and
    in AFDQN-SGD’s case, they are around the value achieved by the centralized method.
    Also, the AFDQN-Avg converged to a smaller value for total return, we expect this
    result will also be reflected in the performance of AFDQN-Avg against AFDQN-SGD.
    This will be investigated in the following experiments. In Fig. 6(a) and Fig.
    6(b), the minimum achievable average AoI and total energy consumption are investigated.
    The AoI value is averaged over all the agents and the total energy consumption
    is defined as the total energy consumption for sending a single packet of each
    service flow through the network from IoT nodes toward the local server. As can
    be seen, the maximum energy consumption of the three methods is limited to a maximum
    value corresponding to the maximum value of resources that the processing nodes
    can allocate to the requests. As a result, the negative side effect of the methods’
    drop in performance is mostly reflected in the value of the averaged AoI. For
    the AFDQN-Avg, this point is evidenced in Fig. 6(a), where we can see that at
    several points the values of the averaged AoI are more than 1 second. However,
    this is the worst-case choice for selecting the global update period η . Form
    Fig. 6(a), for the proposed AFDQN, we could achieve an average AoI of less than
    200 msec, which is acceptable for most real-time applications. Therefore, performance
    close to the centralized case can be achieved by the proposed method in a distributed
    manner, relying solely on the local observations of the UAVs and the sharing of
    trained local models, thus eliminating the need for exchanging the local observations,
    which can be time and energy-consuming. FIGURE 5. Episodic reward of agent 1 for
    the proposed method compared with centralized architecture. All agents follow
    the same policy, which is a copy of the cooperatively-trained global model. Show
    All FIGURE 6. (a) Average episodic AoI. (b) Average episodic total energy consumption
    of the proposed method compared with centralized architecture. All agents follow
    the same policy, which is a copy of the cooperatively-trained global model. Show
    All In Fig. 7(a) and Fig. 7(b), the network energy efficiency versus service availability
    is drawn. The network-wide energy efficiency is defined as the total number of
    successfully-supported service flows divided by the total energy consumption throughout
    the network to send a single packet from each one of the services flows. Also,
    service availability is defined as the percentage of the service flows that are
    supported successfully. In Fig. 7(a), the average network energy efficiency and
    the sample values in our simulation, as well as the standard deviation of the
    value, for AFDQN- 20 (η=20) are shown. The averaged network efficiency with increasing
    the value of the service availability increases in a way that for the service
    availability of more than 80 percent, it converges to around 82 percent. This
    convergence for large value of service availability shows that we were eventually
    able to provide energy efficiency as one of our objective functions. In Fig. 7(b),
    where the proposed AFDQN method with different values of η∈{20,30,60} is compared
    with the centralized approach, it can be seen that the energy efficiency of the
    centralized approach degrades as the availability reaches 100%. This behavior
    is because the centralized method has a single NN for all UAVs. For the availability
    values near 100%, the centralized agent is not able to do the job as efficiently
    as the AFDQN method where each agent has its own NN. FIGURE 7. Network-wide energy
    efficiency vs. percentage of service availability. The shaded area represents
    the standard deviation (SD) from the average value: (a) For AFDQN with η=20 .
    Sample values are shown for more illustration. (b) For AFDQN with η=20 , η=30
    , AFDQN-Avg and centralized architecture. Show All As illustrated in Table 3,
    the load of services (in terms of requested CPU and storage resources) is modeled
    as a normalized uniform random variable. The standard deviation (SD) of the values
    for both CPU request values and storage is 1.3 percent. In Fig. 8, the impact
    of increasing this value, up to 6 times the primary value of 1.3, on the network’s
    performance is examined. The network is first trained with the primary input-load
    SD value of 1.3, and then, we incrementally raised the SD of the input load. This
    can be implicitly considered as a test under non-stationary load. It is evident
    that in this situation the AoI will increase, as illustrated in Fig. 8. To be
    more specific, we considered a threshold of one second for the acceptable AoI.
    Hence, we have also drawn a graph of AoI violation (in percentage) in conjunction
    with the bar chart of averaged AoI to better reflect the effect of the load SD.
    The results demonstrate that the AFDQN-Avg method has better performance in this
    situation, which appears to contradict our previous observations where we concluded
    that decreasing the global update period improves the performance. This observation
    can be explained using the non-stationary behavior of the input load. In this
    case, the AFDQN-Avg lets the agents learn the variations and input model better,
    in comparison with AFDQN-10, which was chosen as an example for a case between
    two extreme cases, AFDQN-SGD and AFDQN-Avg. FIGURE 8. Averaged-AoI and AoI-violation
    percentage for AFDQN-10 and AFDQN-Avg versus standard deviation (SD) of the load
    normalized by SD of the load in the training phase. Show All The effect of increasing
    the number of IoT nodes per agent (UAV) on AoI and Energy consumption is investigated
    in Fig. 9. For this experiment, two AFDQN-10 and AFDQN-Avg cases are considered.
    The results show that AFDQN-10 had better performance than AFDQ-Avg. Another important
    point that should be mentioned relates to the behavior of the network for a large
    number of IoT nodes, e.g., 120 or more. As the number of IoT nodes increases,
    the load of the agents increases directly, this means that there are more CPU
    and storage requests. Because the resources in the processing nodes are limited,
    there comes a point where an increase in the number of IoT nodes will lead to
    more request rejection responses. In this situation, the fresh packets will drop,
    and that causes an increase in the AoI value. However, the network energy consumption
    does not change because the volume of the active processes does not change and
    remains equal to the maximum capacity of the processing nodes. FIGURE 9. The effect
    of increasing the number of IoT nodes per agent (UAV) on AoI and energy consumption.
    Show All For further exploration, Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 compare the performance
    of the proposed algorithm against two baseline algorithms: Multi-agent DQN (MDQN)
    [57] and the adapted version of heuristic Minimum-Delay algorithm [58]. In MDQN
    the agents operate independently based on locally trained models without coordination.
    The agents are equipped with an identical neural network featuring the same specifications
    as AFDQN. Conversely, the Minimum Delay algorithm selects actions at each VNF
    scheduling round t ´ to minimize end-to-end delay (not AoI) between IoT nodes
    and the local server. FIGURE 10. Averaged-AoI and AoI-violation percentage for
    AFDQN-avg compared with MDQN and Minimum-Delay versus standard deviation (SD)
    of the load normalized by SD of the load in the training phase. Show All FIGURE
    11. The effect of increasing the number of IoT nodes per agent (UAV) on AoI and
    energy consumption for AFDQN-avg compared with MDQN and Minimum-Delay. Show All
    In Fig. 10, a comparison similar to Fig. 8 assesses the impact of increasing load
    standard deviation (SD) on network performance in terms of AoI and AoI violation.
    Generally, an increase in SD raises the average AoI and AoI violation percentage
    for all methods, as larger SD values force agents to find the best action across
    a larger state space. As it is evident, the proposed AFDQN method exhibits the
    smallest average AoI and AoI violation percentage compared to baseline methods.
    However, the Minimum Delay method performs the worst due to its localized short-term
    target. Finally in Fig. 11, the impact of increasing the number of IoT nodes per
    agent (UAV) on the proposed method’s performance in terms of AoI and energy consumption
    is explored and compared with MDQN and Minimum Delay algorithms. Results demonstrate
    the superior performance of the proposed AFDQN method compared to baselines. Additionally,
    as the number of IoT nodes reaches 120 and beyond, there is an increased demand
    for CPU and storage; limited resources in processing nodes eventually lead to
    increased rejection of requests, causing a rise in AoI. However, network energy
    consumption remains unchanged, as the volume of active processes remains equal
    to the maximum capacity of processing nodes. SECTION IX. Conclusion We considered
    the problem of dynamic orchestration of NFV-enabled SFCs in smart agriculture
    applications to jointly minimize the AoI and energy consumption throughout the
    network. Especially, the problem is formulated as a decentralized POMDP. Then,
    adopting the symmetric structure of the network, we analytically proved that the
    optimal policy among the agents is behaving similarly. Accordingly, a novel federated-based
    DQN method was proposed to solve the problem efficiently. The proposed method
    is distributed and energy efficient, as the local agents just need to share the
    parameters of their locally trained model with each other. Although the primary
    goal of this method is to provide privacy among the agents, in our problem, this
    significantly decreased the communication overhead, and additionally, the total
    energy consumption of the network. In terms of freshness of information, the AoI
    is minimized jointly, and the achieved value for the AoI, while the parameter
    setting is set to be close to real values, is appropriate for most real-time applications.
    Appendix In this section, we aim to simplify the problem of determining the optimal
    policy (22) by utilizing some structural specifications of the developed system
    and problem. Inspiring by the work presented by Yongacoglu et al. [48], we introduce
    a class of Symmetric DEC-POMDP based on the Definition and Lemma presented below.
    Definition 3 (Symmetric DEC-POMDP):A DEC-POMDP is called symmetric if the following
    conditions hold: A u = A u ´ and γ u = γ u ´ , ∀u, u ´ ∈U∀u∈U , ∀a∈A , and an
    arbitrary permutation function σ(.) : r u (s,σ(a))= r σ(u) (s,a) , and T(⋅|s,σ(a))=T(⋅|s,a)
    . Lemma 1:Let G be a symmetric DEC-POMDP, for any u, u ´ ∈U , if π u = π u ´ ,
    then, π u is ϵ -best-response to π −u if and only if π u ´ is ϵ -best-response
    to π − u ´ , where ϵ -best-response (for an arbitrary ϵ≥0) defines as a policy
    that achieves (reach) a reward (cost) within ϵ of the maximum (minimum) value.
    In our VNF scheduling problem, as it is depicted in Fig. 3, at each VNF scheduling
    round t ~ , each distributed agent u∈U , has K packet-flow { Υ k u (t)|t= t ~
    } K k=1 belong to different services each of which requires running F k different
    VNFs on their packets. The agents decide on how to place these VNFs into available
    processing nodes, i.e., other U−1 UAVs, the local server, or itself, in a way
    that jointly minimizes the average AoI and energy consumption according to (17).
    All the agents follow the same goal and the priorities among the agents are the
    same. Without loss of generality, we assume that the agents have chosen the same
    discount factor, { γ u } u∈U =γ . Thus, it can be found that the agents conceptually
    have the same model; an intuitive inference that can be figured out better using
    the following Index Mapping rule. Definition 4 (Index Mapping):For each function
    f∈ F k of packet-flow Υ k u (t)|t= t ~ , by definition we assume that the policy
    π u ( t ~ ) outputs I fk u ∈{0,1,…,U−1,M} is the i th candidate processing node,
    I i , as depicted in Fig. 12. The actual selected processing node among p∈{u∪{
    u ´ } u ´ ≠u ∪M} , will be, p u ( t ~ )={ [(u+i)modU] th UAV, M, if  I i ≠ I M
    if  I i = I M , ∀ I fk u = I i . (32) View Source Then, χ fk pu (|t= t ~ )=1 ,
    and X k u , B k pu will be updated accordingly. FIGURE 12. Index mapping mechanism.
    Show All Now, according to Definition 3and Definition 4, the following lemma can
    be driven. Lemma 2:Problem 1is a symmetric DEC-POMDP. Proof:According to Definition
    4, the agents have the same set of actions { A u } u∈U ={ I i } i∈U∪M , so the
    condition (i) of Definition 3 is met. Let define C ℓ as circular shift operand
    with arbitrary value of ℓ , C ℓ (⋅)=[⋅+ℓ]modU . Considering a circular shift of
    ℓ over joint action A , C ℓ (A) , we will have, a C ℓ (u) = a u , thus from (32),
    for each I fk C ℓ (u) = I fk u = I i the selected processing node p C ℓ (u) (t)
    will be, p C ℓ (u) ( t ~ )={ [( C ℓ (u)+i)modU] th UAV, M, if  I i ≠ I M if  I
    i = I M , ∀ I fk C ℓ (u) = I i . View Source Or, p C ℓ (u) ( t ~ )= C ℓ ( p u
    ( t ~ )). (33) View Source Equation (33) means Problem 1 is circularly symmetric.
    To be more specific, we do not have any special dependency on the identity of
    the agents and the state transitions depend only on the profile of joint actions
    performed by all agents. Accordingly, permuting the agents’ actions does not change
    the conditional transition probabilities, T(⋅|s, C ℓ (A))=T(⋅|s,A) , and this
    permutation will lead to a corresponding permutation of rewards, r C ℓ (u) (s,A)=
    r u (s, C ℓ (A)) . Hence, the second condition of Definition 3 is also satisfied
    and the proof is complete. According to Lemma 2, being circularly symmetric means
    that the best agents’ policy, π ∗ are the same, { π u } U−1 u=0 = π ∗ . For such
    a condition, Lemma 1implies that the problem of finding the best policy can be
    reduced to finding π ∗ u , the best response to ∏ u ´ ≠u π u ´ , while π u ´ =
    π u ,∀ u ´ ≠u . Although this result is promising, from an implementation viewpoint,
    proposing a distributed solution for finding the best policy while requiring the
    same policy for all the agents is challenging. Recalling (18), in addition to
    the current hidden state, in DEC-POMDP the agents need to infer the action (the
    policy) of the other agents. The subsequent Corollary establishes a connection
    between this inference and solely relying on the local observations of the agents,
    thereby rendering it feasible. Corollary 2:With the same initialization of the
    belief function, { b u (0) } U−1 u=0 =b(0) , for a circularly symmetric DEC-POMDP,
    the local observation h u ( t ~ ) is a sufficient statistic for determining the
    optimal policy π ∗ . Proof:Assume that using a mechanism, the agents peruse the
    same policy π u ( t ~ ) , while they are learning the optimal policy π ∗ . Then,
    the multi-agent belief state b u, t ~ (s, π −u ) would be, b u, t ~ (s, π −u )=
    = = b u, t ~ ⎛ ⎝ s, ∏ u ´ ≠u π u ⎞ ⎠ P(s( t ~ )=s| h u ( t ~ ), b u (0), π u )
    b π u u (s, t ~ ).∀u∈U (34) View Source So, for each agent u , the local observation
    h u ( t ~ ) and knowing its local policy π u is enough for determining the belief-state
    b π u u (s, t ~ ) . In a DEC-POMDP, the set { b π u u (s, t ~ ) } U−1 u=0 is sufficient
    statistic for the joint history H , and the proof is complete. Authors Figures

    population will increase by 33% in 2050, doubling the need for food [124]. Yet
    today, up to 70% of all water withdrawals are due to food production. This demands
    novel technologies to produce more crop for drop. USDA Agricultural Resource Management
    Survey (ARMS) is the primary source of information on the financial condition,
    production practices, and resource use of America’s farm businesses and the economic
    well-being of America’s farm households. ARMS data show that precision agriculture
    has recently become a widespread practice nationwide. In Fig. 1, adoption rates
    of major precision agriculture approaches (bars) along with the total precision
    agriculture adoption rate (line) are shown for maize for each year of USDA ARMS
    publication (USDA ARMS 2015 version was under development at the time of this
    writing). It can be observed that adoption rate of precision agriculture for maize
    increased from 17.29% in 1997 to 72.47% in 2010 with similar trends observed for
    other crops such as soybean and peanuts. Aside from presenting a growing trend
    in the usage of precision agriculture in maize production, it is evident that
    as new technologies emerge, they are widely adopted by farmers. Download : Download

    technology adoption in maize production (USDA ARMS Data). Among the various precision
    agriculture techniques, crop yield monitoring is the most widely adopted technique
    (61.4%). In addition, guidance and auto-steering system adoption jumped from 5.34%
    in 2001 to 45.16% in nine years. Use of equipment and crop location information
    enables precise control with auto-steering systems which reduce production and
    maintenance costs and reduces repetitive field work for farmers. Despite the drastic
    increase in adoption rates of other techniques, Variable Rate Technology (VRT)
    adoption has been relatively steady, where adoption rate increased from 8.04%
    in 1998 to only 11.54% in 2005. Adaptive application of resources like fertilizers,
    pesticide, and water promises significant gains in crop production but requires
    accurate and timely information from the field. It can be observed that only after
    the adoption of recent crop moisture sensing technology, VRT adoption doubled
    to 22.44% in 2010. During the same period, crop moisture sensing adoption increased
    from 36.21% in 2005 to 51.68% in 2010. It is clear that the success and adoption
    of VRT depends on advancing soil monitoring approaches. Despite being the most
    recent precision agriculture technology, crop moisture sensing has become one
    of the most adopted practices. Yet techniques are still limited to manual data
    collection or limited field coverage. 2. A new paradigm: IOUT Most recently, the
    need for real-time in-situ information from agricultural fields have given rise
    to a new type of IoT: Internet Of Underground Things (IOUT). IOUT represents autonomous
    devices that collect any relevant information about the Earth and are interconnected
    with communication and networking solutions that facilitate sending the information
    out of fields to the growers and decision mechanisms. IOUT is envisioned to not
    only provide in-situ monitoring capabilities (e.g., soil moisture, salinity, and
    temperature), but when interconnected with existing field machinery (irrigation
    systems, harvesters, and seeders) enable complete field autonomy and pave the
    way for more efficient food production solutions. In IOUT, Communications can
    be carried out through the soil and plants from underground devices, and information
    acquired from the field can be sent to the cloud for real-time decision making.
    IOUT applications have unique requirements; i.e., information from soil, operation
    in remote crop fields, wireless communication through plants and soil, and exposure
    to elements. Existing over-the-air (OTA) wireless communication solutions face
    significant challenges because they were not designed for these circumstances.
    As such, IOUT also gives rise to a new type of wireless communications: wireless
    underground (UG) communications [68], [152], where radios are buried in soil and
    wireless communication is conducted partly or completely through the soil. Integration
    of UG communications with IOUT will help conserve water resources and improve
    crop yields [143], [145]. Moreover, advances in IOUT will benefit other applications
    including landslide monitoring, pipeline assessment, underground mining, and border
    patrol [67], [69], [71], [84], [94], [102], [106], [115], [132], [138], [142],
    [146], [150], [152], [159]. This paper presents IOUT for the design of precision
    agriculture solutions. We first discuss functionalities, architecture, and components
    of IOUT. In Section 4 and 5, we present sensing and communication technologies
    of IOUT. In Section 6, we list IOUT testbeds and existing solutions. We conclude
    by discussing challenges of IOUT. 3. IOUT architecture IOUT will consist of interconnected
    heterogeneous devices tailored to the crop and field operations. Common desirable
    functionalities of IOUT are: • In-situ sensing: On board soil moisture, temperature,
    salinity sensors are required for accurate localized knowledge of the soil. These
    sensors can be either integrated on the chip along-with other components of the
    architecture, or they can be used as separate sensors that can be connected to
    the main components. • Wireless communication in challenging environments: Communication
    components of IOUT devices are either deployed on the field or within the soil.
    For OTA communication, solutions should be tailored to the changing environment
    due to irrigation and crop growth. Over the air communication is used to store
    the data on a more secure and accessible service/device. In addition, any system
    on the field is exposed to natural elements and should be designed to sustain
    challenging conditions. Underground communication solutions, while mostly shielded
    from the environment, require the ability to communicate through soil and adjust
    its parameters to adapt to dynamic changes in soil. • Inter-connection of field
    machinery, sensors, radios, and cloud: It is desirable that IOUT architecture
    links a diverse multitude of devices on a crop field to the cloud for seamless
    integration. Accordingly, IOUT architecture will not only provide collected information
    but will also automate operations on the field based on this information. • Real-time
    Decision Making: Information about soil and crop conditions should be available
    to the managers and decision support systems for real-time decision making at
    each level. • Mobility: IOUT will have seamless support for both fixed and mobile
    devices with backing of short-term and long-term communications. Based on these
    main required functionalities, a representative IOUT architecture is illustrated
    in Fig. 2, with the following components. • Underground things (UTs): An UT consist
    of an embedded system with communication and sensing components, where a part
    of or the entire system resides underground. UTs are protected by weatherproof
    enclosures and, in underground settings, watertight containers. Buried UTs are
    protected from the farm equipment, wild rodents, and extreme weather conditions.
    Sensors typically include soil temperature and moisture sensors, but a wide range
    of other soil- or weather-related phenomena can be monitored which will be discussed
    in detail on Section 4. Existing communication schemes include Bluetooth, ZigBee,
    NFC, Wi-Fi, Sigfox, LoRa, LoRaWAN, satellite, cellular, and underground. A UT
    using Bluetooth [105] or underground wireless [86] can communicate over 100 meters,
    commercial products at ISM-band can cover three times larger distances, whereas
    longer-distance connectivity is possible through cellular or satellite. Considering
    the relatively large field sizes, nodes can be configured to form networks capable
    of transferring all the sensed information to a collector sink and self-heal in
    the event that nodes become unreachable (e.g., Irromesh [24]). Nodes are generally
    powered by a combination of batteries and, if on field, solar panels. Cost of
    UTs is expected to be relatively inexpensive as they are deployed by the multitude
    [96]. • Base stations are used as gateways to transfer the collected data to the
    cloud. They are installed in permanent structures such as weather stations or
    buildings. Base stations are more expensive as they are better safe-guarded and
    have higher processing powers and communication capabilities [96]. • Mobile sinks
    are installed in equipment that move around the field periodically or as required,
    such as tractors and irrigation systems [86]. Since irrigation machinery advance
    at a slow pace, the soil data is received ahead of time allowing instant adjustment
    on the water application rate. On the other hand, when weather conditions are
    favorable, turning on the irrigation equipment only for data retrieval purpose
    is expensive. An alternative is to use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) such as
    quadrotors or ground robots to retrieve the measurements. • Cloud services are
    intended to use for permanent storage of the data collected, real-time processing
    of the field condition, crop related decision making, and integration with other
    databases (e.g., weather, soil). Download : Download high-res image (466KB) Download

    of such a diverse range of communication architectures makes it challenging to
    form a unified IOUT architecture with the ability to fulfill agricultural requirements
    seamlessly. This is further complicated due to the lack of standard protocols
    for sensing and communication tailored to the IOUT. In the following, we explain
    in detail the sensing (Section 4) and communication (Section 5) mechanisms with
    a focus on desired characteristics of IOUT for real-time sensing and effective
    communications. 4. Sensing The main functionality of IOUT is real-time sensing.
    Sensing has led to adoption of technology in the precision agriculture and it
    also enables improved efficiency of agricultural production and practices [127].
    An overview of sensing technologies is presented next. Soil moisture: Soil moisture
    (SM) sensors have been used for decades in crop fields to measure water content.
    Automated technologies have largely replaced the use of hand-held/manual soil
    moisture technologies because of difficulties associated with taking manual soil
    moisture readings in production fields in remote locations. In the last decade,
    wireless data harvesting technologies have been developed that provide managers
    and users real-time access to soil moisture data which has resulted in more effective
    water management decision-making. Important SM measurement methods are described
    below: • Gravimetric sampling is a direct and standard method of measuring SM.
    It is used to determine the volumetric water content of the soil. This method
    determines SM by a ratio of soil’s dry mass to the wet soil mass including the
    pore spaces. It requires manual sampling and oven drying of soil samples taken
    from the field [91]. • Resistive sensors [50] such as granular matrix sensors
    work on the principal of electrical conductivity of water and measuring resistance
    changes based on soil water content. This method requires calibration of sensors
    for accurate SM reading. • Capacitive sensors measure SM based on changes in capacitance
    of soil due to water content variations. Capacitive sensors, which are generally
    of higher accuracy than resistive sensors but cost more, are being used by commercial
    UTs. • Ground Penetrating Radars (GPR) [66], [98] are based on the absorption
    and reflection of electromagnetic waves. Impulse, frequency sweep, and frequency
    modulated technologies are used in SM sensing. This method is used to measure
    near-surface soil moisture (up to 10 cm). • Neutron scattering probes [87], [92]
    and gauges use radiation scattering techniques to measure SM by estimating changes
    in neutron flux density due to the water content of the soil are the most accurate
    soil moisture probes used in fields. They require specific licenses to be used.
    • Gamma ray attenuation [90], time-domain reflectometry (TDR) [128], and frequency-domain
    reflectometry (FDR) [139] are other popular SM measurement approaches. Common
    SM sensors used in fields are shown in Fig. 3. SM sensors are buried at depths
    of 5  cm to 75  cm in soil depending on the crop type and root depth. SM data
    obtained from these sensors is used to create soil moisture maps which help real-time
    decision making. SM sensors have been deployed in fields with increasing frequency.
    For example, the Nebraska Agricultural Water Management Network [99], [101], was
    established with only 20 growers in 2005 and currently serves over 1400 growers
    to enable the adoption of water and energy conservation practices using SM sensors.
    In addition to in-situ soil moisture sensors, other soil moisture data sources
    are Soil Climate Analysis Network [49], US Climate Reference Network [60], TAMU
    North American Soil Moisture Database [53], Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity [48],
    NASA North American Land Data Assimilation System [27], and NASA Soil Moisture
    Active Passive [46]. These databases contain soil moisture and temperature informations
    of vast geographical areas and augment the Web Soil Survey (WSS) [63], which collects
    and classifies the US soil information by region. Download : Download high-res

    Top row: Gravimetric [91], resistive (Watermark) [50], capacitance [17], Bottom
    Row: GPR [98], TDR [128], neutron probe [92]. Other soil physical properties:
    In addition to soil moisture sensing, other soil properties can be measured to
    populate the soil map such as the organic mater present in the soil, acidity (pH)
    [135], percentage of sand, clay and silt particles [137], and nutrients such as
    Mg, P, OM, Ca, base saturation Mg, base saturation K, base saturation Ca, CEC,
    K/Mg, and Ca/Mg ratios [104], [110], [113]. In-situ, real-time measurement of
    these properties still face challenges due to size, cost, and technology limitations.
    Yield monitoring: Yield monitoring provides spatial distribution of crop yield
    at the end of a growing season and is used make long-term decisions about agriculture
    operations [108], [118]. Yield monitors are usually installed on farm equipment
    and automatically collects yield data during harvesting. More specifically, mass
    flow sensors are installed on grain containers to record grain inflow along with
    location (e.g., Force Sensor by Ag Leader). The collected data is analyzed using
    geographic information system (GIS) tools such as ArchInfo, Mapinfo, and Environment
    System Research International tools. Electrical conductivity and topography surveys:
    The ability of soil to conduct current is measured through soil electrical conductivity
    (EC) [116]. Coupled with field topography (elevation and slope), EC data provides
    an insight into the crop yield. EC (through contact and no-contact methods) is
    used to determine the amount of nitrogen usage, water holding and cation-exchange
    capacity, drainage, and rooting depth. EC maps are used to classify the field
    into zones. Then, precision agriculture practices such as variable rate irrigation,
    variable rate seeding, nitrogen, yield, and drainage management are applied based
    on zoning. EC mapping can be done using apparent electrical conductivity (ECa)
    [88], visible-near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (VNIR) [75], and electromagnetic
    Induction (EMI) [141] approaches. An array of commercial tools are available,
    e.g., Veris 3100 [61], EC400 sensors combined with GPS systems [107] are used
    for EC mapping. Weather and environmental sensing: Weather and environmental sensors
    are used to sense soil and air temperature, direction and speed of winds, and
    other environmental effects such as rainfall, solar emissions and humidity. For
    example, John Deere has introduced sensors to assess these phenomena in their
    commercial Field Connect solution [25]. Availability of this information is useful
    for real-time and fully informed precision agriculture decisions. A mesoscale
    network (MesoNet), consists of nodes for weather and environment sensing, spanning
    over a large geographic area. MesoNet [34] is used to observe major changes in
    weather patterns, and when combined with IOUT sensing can be used to provide real-time
    weather information at the farm level. Soil macro-nutrients sensing: Macro-Nutrients
    such as nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorous are vital for the crop growth. The
    assessment of these nutrients helps to determine the fertilizer impact and future
    applications. Optical sensing is based on reflectance spectroscopy to measure
    the reflection and absorption by these macrosimulation [104], [110], [113]. To
    detect nitrate and sulfate concentration in natural water resources, a sensing
    method using planar electromagnetic sensors has been developed in [121]. This
    method is used to sense nitrate and sulfate levels by correlating the impedance
    of the sensor array with the concentration of these pollutants. It has been shown
    that sensor impedance decreases with increase in concentration of these chemicals
    [121]. Electrochemical, VIS-NIRS spectroscopy, and ATR spectroscopy are the major
    soil macro-nutrients sensing approaches. These soil macro-nutrients sensing approaches
    are limited to sense one desired ion because membrane used in these methods only
    responds to one ion [113]. To achieve concurrent multi-ion sensing, a major challenge
    is to form a detector array for soil macro-nutrients sensing [104]. Remote sensing:
    Remote sensing based approaches uses electromagnetic waves which interact with
    soil and plants in precision agriculture. These approaches work on the measurement
    of intensity of reflected components of the electromagnetic waves as these interact
    with soil and plants [120]. Spatial resolution of remote sensing techniques is
    a major issue; however, when combined with in-situ IOUT sensing approaches, they
    may result in fine resolution, which can be used to produce field maps for analysis
    and decision making in precision agriculture. Examples of these include soil moisture,
    yield [72], texture [140], pesticides applications [95], and nutrient field maps
    [2], [112], [120]. Remote sensing has also applications in satellite data fusion,
    crop structure and condition monitoring. Other precision agriculture technologies:
    A myriad of other technologies is playing vital role in the precision agriculture
    practices. Here we briefly mention these technologies as useful IOUT tools. These
    include precision planting, geolocation, GIS systems, soil sampling and field
    analysis map generation, drones, auto-steering and VRT. In precision planting
    [38], the seeding is done using a very fine predetermined inter plant distance,
    and robots with lasers are used for automatic weed zapping. Farm devices in the
    field are aligned automatically with robovator technology. With GPS, it has become
    possible to divide a farm into different zones based on the field conditions [160].
    Variable rate fertilizer application [2], [78], [95] is also important for crop
    yield improvement. Wireless communications with drones also constitutes a major
    component of the IOUT connectivity. GreenStar Lightbar [15] is a tool from Deere
    & Co that is used to determine the location and width in the row crops. TK-GPS
    [57] is another device used to perform real time soil mapping. The sensing technologies
    discussed in this section present many opportunities for advancing the state of
    precision agriculture through the IOUT. Availability of inexpensive sensors and
    their ability to communicate wireless enables their integrations to control systems
    in IOUT. Therefore, wireless communications, between heterogeneous equipment used
    in these sensor technology, has an important role in realization of the real-time
    decision making in IOUT. Moreover, adoption of sensor technology could be raised
    by a well-connected, reliable, and secure IOUT, and it will also help in development
    of improved sensing technologies in precision agriculture. Because, currently,
    the lack of availability of robust connectivity in the field is hindering rapid
    advancements in sensing technologies. Different approaches for wireless communications
    in IOUT are discussed in the next section. 5. Wireless connectivity Connectivity
    solutions for IOUT can be classified as in-field communications and cloud connectivity
    as discussed next. 5.1. In-field communications In-field communication solutions
    integrate UTs and other communication entities on the field. Most commercial solutions
    utilize OTA communications, whereas IOUT are expected to feature wireless underground
    communications. For short-range communication and networking, license-free standards
    such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, and DASH7 are used in ISM bands. More recently, regulatory
    restrictions are relaxed by the FCC through new rules that allow the use of TV
    white space frequencies in farms [14] (Order No. DA 16-307 Dated: Mar 24, 2016),
    where interference with other licensed devices is not expected. The major challenge
    for OTA communications is the lack of studies about the impacts of crops and farm
    environment on wireless propagation and associated tailored solutions to farms.
    In the following, we discuss in-field communications in detail. UG communications:
    UG communication solutions enable complete concealment of UTs, which decrease
    operation costs and impacts from external elements [86]. For a buried UT radio,
    two types of communication scenarios arise. Aboveground communications involve
    communication between UTs and aboveground devices. Underground communication is
    carried out between UTs. Furthermore, due to the soil-air interface, aboveground
    communication links are not symmetric and need to be analyzed in terms of underground-to-aboveground
    and aboveground-to-underground communication. In Fig. 4, the path loss of these
    links are shown as a result of field experiments [86]. It can be observed that
    practical underground link distances are still limited to 12  m to allow for practical
    multi-hop connectivity. Yet, communication ranges of up to 200  m is possible
    for aboveground communications. Download : Download high-res image (185KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Communication from soil. For UG communications,
    the communication medium is soil, which impacts communication success in six main
    ways: (1) Soil texture and bulk density: EM waves exhibit attenuation when incident
    in soil medium. These variations vary with texture and bulk density of soil. Soil
    is composed of pore spaces, clay, sand, and silt particles. Relative concentration
    of these particles result in 12 soil textural classes [91]. Water holding capacity
    of each soil type is different because of its pore size. For example, lower water
    holding capacity of sandy soil leads to lower attenuation and high root mean square
    delay spread, whereas higher water holding capacities of silt loam and silty clay
    loam soils result in low root mean square delay spread and higher attenuation
    [133], [134]. (2) Soil moisture: The effective permittivity of soil is a complex
    number. Thus, besides diffusion attenuation, EM waves also suffer absorption by
    soil water content and its variations. Soil dielectric spectra and its conductivity
    depends on the soil moisture. The relative dielectric constant range of dry soil
    is between 2 and 6 and its conductivity ranges from to   Si/m, where soils at
    near-saturation level have a relative dielectric constant in the range of 5–15
    and conductivity between to   Si/m [147]. Coherence bandwidth of the underground
    channel is limited to a few hundred KHz range [129], [130], [131], which limits
    data rates. Coherence bandwidth also varies with soil moisture, making design
    of advanced techniques challenging. (3) Distance and depth variations: Sensors
    in IOUT applications are usually buried in the top sub-meter layer. Thus, in addition
    to distance, channel quality depends on deployment depth because of the impacts
    of the soil-air interface, which causes refraction of EM waves. Nodes at higher
    burial depths experience higher attenuation [129]. (4) Antennas in soil: When
    an antenna is buried, its return loss characteristics change due to the high permittivity
    of soil [85], [151]. Moreover, with the variation in soil moisture and hence soil
    permittivity, the return loss of the antenna varies with time too. Changes in
    return loss results in variations in resonant frequency, which is shifted to the
    lower spectrum, and system bandwidth, creating additional challenges for UG communication.
    (5) Frequency variations: The pathloss caused by attenuation is frequency dependent
    because of dipole relaxation associated with water. Generally, lower frequency
    spectrum has lower attenuation, because at higher frequencies, water absorption
    plays a dominant role. In addition, when EM waves propagate in soil, their wavelength
    shortens due to higher permittivity of soil than the air. Therefore, channel capacity
    in soil is also a function of operation frequency [85]. (6) Lateral waves: For
    two UTs, wireless underground communication is conducted through three major paths:
    lateral, direct, and reflected (LDR) waves [86], [130], [133]. Direct and reflected
    waves reside completely in soil and therefore, suffer from the challenges above.
    On the other hand, lateral waves travel partly on the soil-air interface in air,
    experiencing the lowest attenuation. Lateral waves plays an important role in
    extending underground communication ranges. (7) Recent advances in wireless underground
    communications: Recent developments in wireless underground communications include
    the characterization of wireless UG channel and development of environment-aware,
    cross-layer communication solutions to achieve high data rate, long range communications
    with applications to precision agriculture. The impulse response of the wireless
    UG channel is captured and analyzed through extensive experiments [133]. With
    more than 1500 measurement in an underground greenhouse testbed, the effects of
    soil moisture and soil texture on wireless underground communication channel are
    analyzed. Through this analysis, the vital statistics of wireless UG channel impulse
    response (e.g., coherence bandwidth, root mean square delay spread, and power
    associated with multipath) are developed. The three main components of the UG
    channel, direct wave, reflected wave, and the lateral wave are validated. The
    coherence bandwidth of the UG channel has been shown to be less than 1.15  MHz
    which further decreases to 418  kHz for the distances greater than 12  m in soil
    [133]. Change in soil moisture also impacts the root mean square delay spread
    which requires moisture-based dynamic adaptation techniques in UG communications.
    The statistical model [134] is vital for tailored solutions for underground multi-carrier
    communication and soil moisture adaptive beamforming. Based on impulse response
    analysis, the multi-carrier modulation and wireless underground channel diversity
    reception schemes have been developed for the realization of high data rate communications
    [129]. The effects of soil type and moisture on the underground antenna, channel
    and system capacity are highlighted. Based on this analysis, multi-carrier modulation
    and wireless underground channel diversity reception schemes [131] have been developed.
    The optimum maximum ratio combining (MRC-LDR) achieves the maximum gain. In this
    approach, three times SNR enhancement is achieved as compared to the SNR of a
    single antenna matched filter UG receiver. However, the interference from the
    reflected components is still present. Adaptive combining (AC-LDR) uses adaptive
    switching and selection process to suppresses undesired interference. Based on
    the proximity of the LDR receiver, either the D-wave or L-Wave component is dominant
    at the receiver. AC-LDR exploits this by adaptively switching and selecting the
    strongest lateral, or the direct wave. The R-Wave is not considered because it
    is the weakest component and results in performance degradation. In [131], the
    performance analysis of different modulation schemes through simulations and experiments
    has been carried out. The BER under equalization and diversity reception has been
    reported. A 3 times increase in SNR and improvement in BER from to are shown in
    wireless underground communication channel. Since use of sensing technologies
    in precision agriculture depend on reliable UG communications, these is a demand
    for high date rate, ubiquitous, reliable communications. These low error rate
    communication techniques help to achieve that goal in precision agriculture. Moreover,
    based on UG antenna analysis, soil moisture adaptive beamforming (SMABF) using
    underground antenna arrays is also developed [130]. SMABF employs underground
    antenna arrays at the transmitter and omni-directional antenna at the receiver.
    The lateral wave is maximized if the energy from the UG antenna is radiated in
    an optimum angle. In SMABF, beam steering is done to exploit the lateral wave
    in the underground communication by sending the energy in the optimum angle which
    maximizes lateral wave and leads to higher directivity. SMABF has complex array
    structures and needs phase shifters. With these advancements in UG communications,
    it has become possible to make progress from data collection to real-time processing
    and decision making in precision agriculture. Magnetic induction (MI) and acoustic
    UG communications: Magnetic Induction (MI) based communications is another approach
    for UG communications. In magnetic induction [114], [143], the rate of decay of
    received signal strength (RSS) is the inverse cube factor. Therefore, long range,
    high data rates signaling can not be done using MI, which is vital for IOUT paradigm.
    Moreover, the perpendicularity of transmitter and receiver coils (antennas) is
    a prohibiting factor to establish communications in MI. Wavelengths in MI communications
    tend to be large. Therefore, IOUT architecture can not scale with MI based UG
    communications in IOUT. Hence, because of these limiting factors, and due to in-feasibility
    of MI communications to establish communications with aboveground devices, MI
    based communications is not a reliable option for IOUT. EM-based UG communications
    are more suitable. There are also some common characteristics in underwater communication
    [74] and UG communications. However, underwater communications can not utilize
    electromagnetic (EM) waves because of higher degradation of signals and water
    absorption. Therefore, other approaches (e.g., acoustic [74]) are used in underwater
    communications. Moreover, the acoustic approach is infeasible in IOUT UG communications
    because of vibration limitations. Underground to UAV communications: The unmanned
    aerial vehicle (UAVs, also called drones) have recently emerged in the precision
    agriculture practices for sensing and communications of the filed conditions [123],
    [148], agricultural surveillance using imaging [97], [83], and decision support
    [144]. Before the use of UAVs in precision agriculture, the satellite imagery
    was obtained for the purpose of monitoring. Through the use of UAV imaging, a
    detailed soil moisture map of the field can be produced in timely and inexpensive
    manner. Moreover, the crop growth can also be monitored by using UAVs and accordingly
    vegetation index is generated. The seed planting and pesticide applications are
    other important applications of UAVs in precision agriculture. The UAVs, when
    integrated with the IOUT in the field, will require reliable communications with
    sensors and radio equipment for real-time decision making. There are many challenges
    from UG to UAV communications (e.g., restrictions on UAV communications payloads
    and antennas, limited flight times, low communication range from the UG to UAV
    link, and specific operator skills and licenses required for UAV operation). Technology
    and regulatory advances in these areas will lead to enhanced integration of UAVs
    in precision agriculture IOUT. Low power wide area networks (LPWAN): Since IOUT
    is designed for prolonged operation in the agricultural field, energy conservation
    plays important role in long term functionality and connectivity. Low Power Wide
    Area Networks (LPWAN) are designed not only to achieve energy conservation objective
    but also to attain long-range connectivity [122]. Due to this, LPWAN is suitable
    for IOUT communications where high data rate operations are not required and low
    latency of data transfer can be accepted for some applications. According to LPWAN
    Technical Workgroup, it has capacity to work over the time span of many years
    and is specifically designed for applications which need to transmit small packets
    intermittently. A brief overview of LPWAN technologies is given in the following:
    (1) LoRa: Approaches designed to conserve energy like Long Range Wide Area Network
    (LoRaWAN) favor one-hop star topology where end-devices transmit small packets
    of information (0.290–50  kbps) over long distances (up to 45  km in rural areas)
    [80]. This is more suitable for battery powered devices. Reliable communication
    over long distance is possible because of techniques like adaptive data rate,
    LoRa’s chord spread spectrum radio modulation scheme, and gateways that decode
    data received on multiple channels modulated with different spreading factors
    [111]. However, since LoRa uses unlicensed frequency, the channel utilization
    is limited to 30 seconds per day by regulations. For application that requires
    a QoS level, the download channel increase the probability of collisions [81].
    In precision agriculture, LoRa technology provides low-cost low-power communication
    solution for prolonged monitoring operations [29]. (2) Sigfox: Sigfox [44] is
    the first LPWAN technology and highly efficient in spectrum usage. It uses ultra
    narrow band (UNB) modulation. The communication range of Sigfox is up to 45  km
    and 12  km in rural and urban areas respectively. Sigfox supports data rates of
    up to 250  kbps, and also uses unlicensed spectrum (868  MHz and 902  MHz) for
    communications. Consequently, the amount of data that can be transferred daily
    is also limited by regulations [161]. Sigfox provides many opportunities in precision
    agriculture IOUT to support connectivity among field equipment and UT sensors
    [45]. (3) On-Ramp/Ingenu: On-Ramp developed the IEEE 802.15.4k [20] technical
    standard for LWPAN. It only specifies the physical and MAC layer, and upper layers
    are complimented by other standards which operates at the upper layers. It uses
    higher bandwidth (1 MHz) as compared to other LWPAN technologies. IEEE 802.15.4k
    uses 902–928  MHz unlicensed spectrum. Its communication range is up to 15  km.
    Hence, it more suitable for communications agricultural forms spanning over large
    geographical areas [35]. (4) NB-IoT: NB-IoT [154] is a new physical layer standard
    by 3GPP LTE (Release 13). It can coexist with LTE and GSM. NB-IoT also uses narrowband
    signal and is meant for low data rate applications. It only uses 180  KHz of its
    200  KHz bandwidth. NB-IoT operates in licensed spectrum and uses same band as
    of LTE. It supports standalone operation, broadband operation, and in-band operation.
    NB-IoT is also being used in many commercial agricultural solutions in Europe
    [32]. It also facilitates low-cost, long range, and prolonged battery life solutions
    in precision agriculture. (5) Extended coverage GSM IoT: EC-GSM-IoT [12] is another
    low power long range LWPAN standard based on software update to cellular eGPRS.
    It can also co-exist with other mobile networks and designed to support battery
    life of up to 10 years. It operates in 800  MHz to 900  MHz and 1800 to 1900  MHz
    GSM bands. Many features of EC-GSM-IoT (e.g., inexpensive equipment, long range
    and coverage) makes it suitable for IOUT communication in precision agriculture.
    NWave [33], Platanus [36], Weightless [64], and Ingenu [20] are other major notable
    LPWAN technologies, which can be used for IOUT communications depending on the
    deployment, application, energy requirement, and equipment. These are also being
    used in precision agriculture connected vineyards [11]. Wireless PAN/LAN: Wireless
    PAN/LAN is also important for communications between farm machinery and equipment,
    field workers and central base stations in the field. Use of Wireless LAN/PAN
    enables high data rate, low latency communication in IOUT, which are not supported
    by LPWAN. Wireless PAN/LAN include many technologies such as Bluetooth, ZigBee,
    Thread, and Wi-Fi. In the following we present brief overview of these technologies:
    (1) Bluetooth: Bluetooth [5] is standardized by Special Interest Group (SIG).
    Communication can be done up to 100  m distances and it uses frequency hopping
    spread spectrum technique. Bluetooth Smart is the low energy version and can operate
    in broadcast and connected mode. Bluetooth uses 2.4  GHz ISM band and has bandwidth
    up to 25  MHz. It is also being used in development of a low energy moisture-
    and temperature sensor intended for use in an agricultural wireless sensor network
    system [76]. (2) ZigBee: ZigBee [65] operates on the top of 802.15.4 MAC/PHY and
    it consists of application and network layer protocols. It can operate in a star
    and mesh topology with bandwidth up to 1  MHz and communication range of up to
    10 to 30 meters. A smart agriculture system by using ZigBee technology has been
    developed in [117]. (3) Thread: Thread [56], self-healing mesh network protocol,
    functions on IEEE 802.15.4 MAC/PHY and is simple and secure battery friendly LAN
    protocol. It can supports up to 250 devices and provides security at network and
    application layers. (4) Wi-Fi: IEEE 802.11 [19] is high data rate communication
    standard with support for data rates higher than 1  Gbps. It has physical layer
    standards for different ISM bands (2.4  GHz, 5  GHz and 60  GHz) and used different
    channel bandwidth up to 160  MHz. A remote monitoring system using WiFi, where
    the wireless sensor nodes are based on WSN802G modules, has been developed in
    [119]. Cellular technology in IOUT: As more and more IOUT applications are being
    developed, the demand for cellular and broadband connectivity IOUT solutions is
    reaching at critical levels. Lack of broadband cellular communication in rural
    areas is a major challenge as it hinders instant access to big data being generated
    from the field. Currently, data has to be collected and transmitted manually from
    the deployed IOUT systems which is major bottleneck in adoption of precision agriculture
    practices in remote rural areas. One main factor for non-existent or slow cellular
    data communication speeds is the huge expenditure on commissioning of required
    infrastructure rural communities. There are also many system and cost related
    challenges in Machine-to-Machine (M2M) cellular communications [70] as main purpose
    of cellular design was human communications. However, a recent release of LTE
    cellular standard has the support for M2M communications and can be used for communication
    in production fields being served with LTE networks. However, IOUT devices are
    required to be compatible with the cellular standard and energy consumption challenges
    restricts their use in battery powered devices for prolonged duration. To overcome
    these challenges, low power devices can be connected through in-field communications
    and subsequently data can be collected and transmitted to the cloud by using externally
    powered gateways with cellular capabilities. Energy consumption in IOUT: In IOUT,
    energy consumption is a vital issue because of the low power requirement for sensors
    in order to operate for prolonged periods without battery replacement. Moreover,
    the channel quality in UG communications is impacted by physical parameters of
    the soil (e.g., soil moisture). In [84], a connectivity model of IOUT for different
    soil physical parameters has been developed by designing the cluster size distribution
    under sub-critical constraints. A novel aboveground communication coverage model
    for underground clusters has been developed. To maintain connectivity while reducing
    energy consumption the transmit power control and environment aware routing are
    proposed. It is shown that these approaches can maintain network connectivity
    under all soil moisture conditions while reducing energy consumption. Moreover,
    it has also been shown that use of relaying nodes based on soil wetness conditions
    can further decrease the energy consumption. 5.2. Cloud and big data in precision
    agriculture Due to limited processing power and energy considerations, data processing
    and decision making are not generally conducted locally. Depending on privacy
    considerations, field information can be stored in a private database, provided
    to the public databases, or shared with other users [157]. There are online marketplaces
    where big data sets and agricultural apps are used to analyze a region and make
    decisions to maximize crop yield [136]. Additionally, in-situ SM sensors can be
    linked to national soil moisture databases for complete, accurate, and comprehensive
    information of soil moisture [27], [46], [48], [49], [53], [60], [63]. With the
    support of cloud services, real-time visualization and decision support can be
    provided. Therefore, Cloud can be used as a hub of data storage and processing
    applications in precision agricultural. Moreover, Cloud allows the scalability
    of IOUT paradigm from the field level to bigger geographic areas by forming network
    of farms. On the other hand, in the absence of storage or processing constraints,
    base stations on the fields can pull meteorological data from a weather service
    or soil information from a national service, fuse this information with in-situ
    data from UTs, and control the farming equipment. To have a fully automated system,
    farming equipment should include a controller that can be accessed remotely. The
    integration of IOUT with creates new avenues to form robust stakeholders in precision
    agriculture such as growers, industry, and trading companies and would results
    in increased efficiency and sustainability of whole precision agriculture ecosystem.
    In addition to integration of farm equipment data to soil and weather databases,
    other examples include linking UAVs and robotics to precision agriculture paradigm.
    Irrespective of in-situ or cloud processing, the main challenge is the integration
    of heterogeneous systems. Moreover, reliable data transfer from field to cloud,
    and cloud to farm, will constitute an important functionality of the IOUT cloud
    architecture. This functionality will not only help connect fields over vast geographical
    areas to the cloud, but will also facilitate local farms to use this data for
    assessment and improvement of crop yield. Moreover, there is a need of development
    of standardized interfaces for seamless connectivity and collaboration between
    different components of the precision agriculture ecosystem. The IOUT paradigm
    enables sensing and communications of even minor changes in the field including
    change in physical properties of the soil and growth of plants. Major sources
    of big data in precision agriculture are ESA satellite images, NDVI from drones,
    user maps (yield, electrical conductivity, and others), and soil data. This process
    generates big data and it becomes very important to extract meaningful information
    from this huge amount of data. This is also crucial for real-time end user decision
    making and in evaluation of return on investment. Therefore, it is necessary to
    develop big data analytics in precision agriculture [156]. It is also essential
    to analyze the reduction in input cost in water resources, energy consumption
    and labor cost by adopting precision agriculture practices [73]. Other examples
    of the big data analytics in precision agriculture are factors affecting crop
    yield; and demarcation of field zones based on particular application such as
    productivity, soil moisture, nutrients, harvesting. Farmers, as the biggest stakeholder
    in the precision agriculture, need to use the technology to see the potential
    benefits with out being overloaded with the data. Therefore, the big data analytics
    to show increase in crop yield and improvement in overall production efficiencies,
    which can deliver tangible benefits, are vital for success of the whole precision
    agriculture ecosystem. 6. An overview of IOUT enabling technologies and testbeds
    In this section, we present an overview of enabling technologies which facilitate
    IOUT developments for system-wide and communication-specific challenges. 6.1.
    Academic IOUT systems IOUTs can be used to ascertain the amount of water and fertilizer
    to be applied using an irrigation control system. An IOUT testbed has been deployed
    on the South Central Agricultural Lab (SCAL) in Clay Center, Nebraska [86]. The
    testbed covers a 41 acres of research field where an advanced center pivot irrigation
    system was installed in 2005 to research long-term dynamics of variable rate irrigation
    and fertigation, crop water and nutrient uptake, water stress and yield relationships,
    develop crop production functions, and associated numerous topics under full and
    limited irrigation and rainfed settings [100]. In this testbed, a mobile sink
    is installed on one of the controller towers of the center pivot irrigation system
    [86]. The current configuration includes two antennas facing opposite directions
    allowing the reception of data from nodes at a distance of 150  m–200  m. A solar
    panel provides sustainable energy in the field. 10–16 buried UTs are deployed
    in the field. Each UT is capable of measuring soil temperature and soil moisture
    from four external sensors buried at depths of 1, 2, 3, and 4  ft. UTs are powered
    by lithium-ion batteries and protected by a watertight enclosure. The spatio-temporal
    real-time information from UT is fused at the mobile sink and sent to the cloud
    using 4G communications. The cloud communicates with the center pivot controller
    for automated irrigation control. This field testbed is fully functional system
    developed to investigate IOUT sensing and communications capabilities in an agriculture
    field using center pivot irrigation, sensors, aboveground and underground communication
    devices. An indoor testbed has been designed and developed inside the greenhouse
    which supports dynamic soil moisture control for wireless underground communication
    experiments [133]. The testbed is made of 100  in. long, 36  in. wide and 48  in.
    high wooden box with drainage system to hold 90 cubic feet of packed soil (Fig.
    5). Antennas are buried at different depths and distances for controlled wireless
    communication experiments. Download : Download high-res image (203KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 5. The indoor testbed [133]. Moreover, a testbed
    based on magnetic induction (MI) underground communications has been developed
    in [143]. This testbed includes coils buried in the underground in lab settings.
    MI wave guide effects and 3-D coils are investigated using this testbed in different
    soil configurations. SoilBED [89], is another underground testbed developed for
    cross-well radar experiments in soil. It is used for investigation of EM wave
    propagation and for detection of presence of contaminated materials in soil. SoilBED
    can also be used for underground channel and antenna characterization, and empirical
    validations of underground communication channel models. Thoreau [161] is an IOUT
    testbed on an university campus that collects and curates time and geo-tagged
    data on an open platform on the cloud. It is based on Sigfox design and operates
    in the 900  MHz unlicensed bands with frequency hopped and narrow-band operation.
    It has very low data rates and soil properties including soil temperature, soil
    moisture, electric conductivity, and water potential are measured. Another precision
    agriculture testbed has been developed for real-time sensing in the field [79].
    It is used to sense related soil properties for real-time decision making. BioSense
    [4] Institute is an R&D institute for IT in biosystems. To achieve their vision
    on the future of agriculture and food production, BioSense works on the areas
    of machinery auto-steering and automation, EC probe & XRF scanner, electrical
    conductivity map, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) map, yield map,
    remote sensing, nano and micro-electronic sensors, big data, and Internet of things
    aimed to food production. BioSense Institute, supported by University of Novi
    Sad, Serbia, focuses on the design development of advanced ICT solutions in agriculture,
    food, ecology, environmental protection, and forestry. Research results of BioSense
    Institute are helping European countries and regions to improve agricultural and
    environmental standards. It is also working in nano and microelectronics, communications
    and signal processing, remote sensing and GIS, robotics and mechatronics, knowledge
    discovery, and BIO-related research fields such as agriculture, ecology, environmental
    sciences, and forestry. It consists of many researchers from various fields labs
    from Europe. Their solution for Big Data is AgroSense [3], an agricultural platform
    which store and present information to farmers, agri-companies, government, banks,
    and insurance companies aimed toward improving crop yield while reducing costs.
    Internet of Food and Farm (IoF2020) [22] is an European project that has 19 use
    cases in 5 agri-food production sectors: arables, fruits, vegetables, dairy, and
    meat. An example in arable is the combination of data from sensor networks for
    smart wheat management with crop models and other data sources (e.g., disease,
    crop stage detection, cultivar characterization from phenotyping, and others)
    to generate high spatial-temporal resolution and to develop new models. In fruits,
    a fresh table grapes chain project uses information from weather station and wired
    sensor (soil moisture, soil temperature, electrical conductivity, and leaf wetness)
    for disease forecasting and to control irrigation using flow meters and solenoid
    valves. Solar powered data loggers transmit the data using GPRS network. A case
    study in vegetable is the tracking of greenhouse tomato-crops chain by setting
    the optimum ambient conditions to reduce the usage of resources (e.g., pesticide
    application could be avoided completely) and increase energy efficiency. In dairy,
    15 grazing cows are tracked on the pasture and inside the dairy barn using three
    beacons. A case in meat is the tracking of pigs using RFID tags, which reduces
    boar taint, health problems, and improve productivity. Sensor are also used for
    climate monitoring, register weight gain, feeding and drinking patterns, and food
    and water consumption. A ZigBee based IOUT has been developed in [158] with application
    in precision agriculture. Related soil properties such as humidity and pH are
    sensed using this architecture. An IOUT for soil moisture sensing at multiple
    depths has been developed in [125]. It consists of wireless communications nodes,
    sensors, data transfer gateways, and web modules for real time sensing, communication,
    and visualization in the field. An IOUT testbed for snow and soil moisture monitoring
    has been developed in Sierra Nevada, California [103] . With 300 sensors spanning
    over an area of multiple kilometers, this IOUT sensing testbed is used to record
    measurements of soil water content, snow depth, matric potential, and other related
    parameters; and a detailed sensing, and communication performance analysis data
    is also reported. A summary of the existing academic architectures is provided

    products, OTA wireless communication is utilized, where the UT includes a variety
    of high-end sensors that measure properties like soil moisture, temperature, and
    electrical conductivity. Consequently, measurements generally represent a single
    point in the field. UT’s can interconnect to create a communication mesh, but
    in most cases, they are connected directly to a tower in the field with cellular
    or satellite communication capabilities. If the UT is not buried underground,
    redeployment of the equipment is needed after planting and before harvesting in
    each growing season to avoid damages to the equipment by the farming machinery.
    A classification of the commercial IOUT solutions, companies, and their products
    are presented in Fig. 6. Modularity in the design of IOUT devices is highly desirable
    as the requirements can change over time and are tailored for a specific application.
    For example, the transmission range influence the selection of a protocol and
    the transceiver that can meet the communication demands. Solutions could be customized
    for a specific application and ordered as a complete solution, so they will work
    out-of-the box. There are companies that specialize in agricultural solutions.
    In other cases, the architecture is required to be more specific and fast prototyping
    using OEM components is more appropriate. Once data is collected, end-users need
    networks to transmit the data, servers for storage and processing, and cloud-based
    applications to display the information. A summary of the commercial solutions
    is provided in Table 2. Major classes of the commercial solutions are highlighted
    in the following. • Agricultural solutions.John Deere’s Field Connect uses 3G
    connections to transmit information from eight sensor probes located a mile away
    (three if satellite communication is used) that measure soil moisture at various
    depth, temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, rain, and leaf wetness.
    MimosaTEK provides irrigation and fertigation solutions scaled to small, medium,
    and large farms [31]. TempuTech [55] provide wireless solutions to monitor temperature
    and humidity in grain elevators. Microsoft is developing FarmBeats which is an
    AI & IoT based platform for Agriculture [13]. These commercial agricultural solutions
    provide full support in precision agriculture including sensing, communications,
    and the cloud. • Out-of-the-box packages.Smartrek Technologies develops wireless
    nodes for different types of sensors and gateways that can be set up easily into
    a network mesh [47]. Nodes are protected by weatherproof enclosures which is a
    requirement for farm outdoor setting. Accessible ports allows the installation
    of third-party soil moisture sensors and weather detection. Libelium has developed
    a Plug & Sense Smart Agriculture solution [37] for temperature and humidity sensing,
    rainfall, wind speed and direction, atmospheric pressure, soil water content,
    and leaf wetness. Libelium provides platforms and end-user devices that encompass
    communications standards such as LoRaWAN, LoRa, Sigfox, sub GHz, ZigBee, DigiMesh,
    WiFi, RFID, NFC, Bluetooth/BLE, 3G, 4G, and GPRS. Sensor boards can be connected
    to their Waspmote platform to attach 120 different sensors. Libelium also hosts
    an IoT marketplace and provides cloud services to manage IoT devices and online
    programming. Cropx’s [8] IOUT consists of hardware and software components used
    to measure soil moisture, temperature, and EC for real time irrigation decision
    making. PrecisionHawk has developed an IOUT platform [39] using drones, which
    is used for sensing and field map generation. It supports visual imaging, thermal
    and multi-spectral imaging for field map generation in precision agriculture.
    These out-of-the-box packages are important component of the precision agriculture
    to support different types of applications. • OEM components.OEM components are
    commonly used in the manufacturing of nodes at a large scale. However, the prototyping
    or small scale production of very specific UT will also required the selection
    of OEM devices. ST [51] develops internal components for IoT devices like accelerometers,
    gyroscope, and MEMS microphones. Semtech Corporation is a supplier of high-performance
    semiconductors and advanced algorithms [41]. U-blox specialized in communication
    and positioning components for IoT devices [59]. Telit is an M2M solutions company
    with focus in IoT development [54]. Telit provides tailored hardware and software
    solutions in small size modules. Products can transmit data using cellular, Bluetooth/BLE,
    LoRa, Low Power Wide Area (LPWA), Positioning, SigFox, Sub GHz, Wi-Fi, and M-Bus
    wireless technology. Herelab provides proof of concept deployment and rapid prototyping
    service of IoT custom platforms [16]. For instance, in agriculture, sensor interfaces
    can be rapidly attached to a template, and the corresponding instructions can
    be adapted from the code library. Herelab also organizes labs and workshop to
    introduce new tools and promote the usage of IoT devices. These components serve
    as useful building blocks of IOUT sensing and communications paradigm. • Cloud-based
    services.Cloud service allows worldwide access to the information collected by
    IOUT devices without any previous web programming knowledge. Farmers and other
    professionals do not need to spend time to hire another party in order to configure
    a server to make use of the data collected; and can take decision right away.
    LORIoT provides cloud services on a geographical distributed low latency network
    of servers where users connect their LoRaWan gateways. Among the web services
    they offer are the management of devices, cloud storage of data, safeguard of
    encryption keys, and LoRaWan to IP/IPv6 translation [30]. MyDevices offers IoT
    developers services to promote their solutions. One attractive feature of MyDevices
    is that it offers Cayenne, a drag-and-drop IoT project builder. End-users can
    create an account and use Cayenne web and mobile applications to register their
    IoT devices and instantly display sensed data on a fully customizable dashboard
    [6]. Senet operates two public cloud-based networks, Managed Network Services
    for IoT (MNSi) and Low Power Wide Area Virtual Network (LVN), that provide secure,
    efficient, and scalable connectivity to low-powered devices [42]. A proprietary
    network operating system handles end-devices messages and LoRaWAN gateways, generation
    of keys for encryption, decryption of messages, and hosting the portal for device
    management, among other activities. Device Lynk offers an online dashboard for
    data visualization of data captured using IoT industrial devices [9]. IntelliFarms
    provides diverse agricultural solutions such as reporting weather conditions,
    providing market crop pricing, and monitoring storage conditions in silos and
    bins. It also host the IntelliFarms platform where customer can get access to
    all their solutions in a centralized fashion [21]. 365FarmNet platform [1] is
    an agricultural data management service that is currently offering free field
    mapping for precision agriculture. Research challenges in IOUT are presented in

    challenges Challenges in design and implementation of a precision agriculture
    based IOUT are highlighted in this section. 1. Due to large area of deployment
    in agricultural fields, low cost and low complexity IOUT devices are desirable
    with ability to sustain rough terrains in all type of soil moisture regimes. 2.
    Improving UTs with more complex functionalities will lead to higher energy consumption
    and faster battery depletion. Thus, improvements in energy efficient operation,
    sustainable energy sources, and energy harvesting are major challenges. 3. Due
    to availability of different types of SM sensors, their integration with communication
    equipment is a major challenge. A standard protocol is required for seamless integration
    of different types of sensors to the communication devices in IOUT. 4. Low-cost
    and multi-modal soil sensors that can sense soil physical properties in addition
    to moisture are required. While moisture provides valuable information for irrigation
    decisions, soil chemicals need to be sensed in-situ for variable rate fertigation
    applications. 5. Advanced security mechanisms are required to protect information
    transfer in the fields. Moreover, field-based privacy solutions are required such
    that information from multiple fields can be fused for more accurate decisions
    while preserving the privacy of growers. 6. Seasonal changes and crop growth cycles
    need to be considered as they temporarily alter the conditions in which the equipment
    typically works. Freezing temperature affects power consumption, but equipment
    can be set to deep sleep as monitoring might not be necessary. The beginning of
    the growing season or a crop rotation can introduce heavier equipment on the field
    and UTs need to be buried deep enough to avoid damages. 7. Due to dynamic changes
    in the communication medium in soil, UTs should be able to autonomously adjust
    their operation parameters such as operation frequency, modulation schemes, error
    coding schemes for adaptive operation. Due to the close interactions with soil,
    these solutions should be tailored to UG communications instead of adopting existing
    OTA solutions [86], [129], [130], [131], [133]. Impacts of soil physical properties,
    soil moisture on UG communication should be modeled. A detailed insight into these
    effects will help to realize a reliable, scalable IOUT architecture. 8. Impacts
    of soil physical properties, soil moisture on UG communication should be modeled.
    A detailed insight into these effects will help to realize a reliable, scalable
    IOUT architecture. 9. Specialized link-layer and network layers protocols are
    needed for UG communications for scalable, reliable, and robust data transfer
    in IOUT. 8. Conclusions We introduced the Internet of Underground Things (IOUT)
    for real-time decision making in agricultural fields. A complete architectures
    for precision agriculture based IOUT has been presented. It has been shown that
    the sensing and communications are the main component of the IOUT. A detailed
    overview of sensing and communication technologies including academic and commercial
    solutions is presented. In-field communications (UG, LPWAN, LAN, cellular) and
    cloud are discussed in detail. Challenges to the realization of IOUT are highlighted,
    and testbed designs for IOUT realization are presented. Recent advances in the
    theory and applications of wireless UG communication are also reported. Acknowledgments

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Singapore SECTION I. Introduction World population
    will increase by 32 percent in 2050, doubling the need for food. Yet today, up
    to 70 percent of all water withdrawals are due to food production. This demands
    novel technologies to produce more crop for drop. USDA Agricultural Resource Management
    Survey (ARMS) is the primary source of information on the financial condition,
    production practices, and resource use of America''s farm businesses and the economic
    well-being of America''s farm households. ARMS data show that precision agriculture
    has become a widespread practice nationwide. In Fig. 1, adoption rates of major
    precision agriculture approaches (bars) along with the total precision agriculture
    adoption rate (line) are shown for corn for each year of USDA ARMS publication
    (USDA ARMS 2015 version was under development at the time of this writing). It
    can be observed that adoption rate of precision agriculture for corn increased
    from 17.29 percent in 1997 to 72.47 percent in 2010 with similar trends observed
    for other crops such as soybean and peanuts. Aside from presenting a growing trend
    in the usage of precision agriculture in corn production, it is evident that as
    new technologies emerge, they are widely adopted by farmers. Among the various
    precision agriculture techniques, crop yield monitoring is the most widely adopted
    technique (61.4 percent). In addition, guidance and auto-steering system adoption
    jumped from 5.34 percent in 2001 to 45.16 percent in nine years. Use of equipment
    and crop location information enables precise control with auto-steering systems
    which reduce production and maintenance costs and reduces repetitive field work
    for farmers. Despite the drastic increase in adoption rates of other techniques,
    variable rate technology (VRT) adoption has been relatively steady, where adoption
    rate increased from 8.04 percent in 1998 to only 11.54 percent in 2005. Adaptive
    application of resources like fertilizers, pesticide, and water promises significant
    gains in crop production but requires accurate and timely information from the
    field. It can be observed that only after the adoption of recent crop moisture
    sensing technology, VRT adoption doubled to 22.44 percent in 2010. During the
    same period, crop moisture sensing adoption increased from 36.21 percent in 2005
    to 51.68 percent in 2010. Fig. 1: Precision agriculture technology adoption in
    corn production (usda ARMS data). Show All It is clear that the success and adoption
    of variable rate technology depends on advancing soil monitoring approaches. Despite
    being the most recent precision agriculture technology, crop moisture sensing
    has become one of the most adopted practices. Yet techniques are still limited
    to manual data collection or limited field coverage. Most recently, the need for
    real-time in-situ information from agricultural fields have given rise to a new
    type of IoTs: Internet of underground Things (IOUT). IOUT represents autonomous
    devices that collect any relevant information about the Earth and are interconnected
    with communication and networking solutions that facilitate sending the information
    out of fields to the growers and decision mechanisms. Fig. 2: IOUT paradigm in
    precision agriculture. Show All IOUT is envisioned to not only provide in-situ
    monitoring capabilities (e.g., soil moisture, salinity, and temperature), but
    when interconnected with existing field machinery (irrigation systems, harvesters,
    and seeders) enable complete field autonomy and pave the way for better food production
    solutions. In IOUT, communications can be carried out through the soil and plants
    from underground devices, and information acquired from the field can be sent
    to cloud through the Internet for real-time decision making. Due to to the unique
    requirements of the IOUT applications; i.e., information from soil, operation
    in remote crop fields, wireless communication through plants and soil, and exposure
    to elements; existing over-the-air (OTA) wireless communication solutions face
    significant challenges because they were not designed for these circumstances.
    As such, IOUT also gives rise to a new type of wireless communications: wireless
    underground (UG) communications [1], [2], where radios are buried in soil and
    wireless communication is conducted partly through the soil. Integration of UG
    communications with IOUT will help conserve water resources and improve crop yields
    [3], [4]. Moreover, advances in IOUT will benefit other applications including
    landslide monitoring, pipeline assessment, underground mining, and border patrol
    [2], [5]–[10]. This paper presents Internet of Underground Things for the design
    of precision agriculture solutions. We first discuss functionalities, architecture,
    and components of IOUT. Then, we present sensing and communication technologies
    of IOUT along with existing solutions. We conclude by presenting IOUT testbeds
    and discussing challenges of IOUT. SECTION II. IOUT Architecture IOUT will consist
    of interconnected heterogeneous devices tailored to the crop and field operations.
    Common desirable functionalities of IOUT are: In-situ Sensing: On board soil moisture,
    temperature, salinity sensors are required for accurate localized knowledge of
    the soil. These sensors can be either integrated on the chip along-with other
    components of the architecture, or they can be used as separate sensors that can
    be connected to the main components through wires. Wireless Communication in Challenging
    Environments: Communication components of IOUT devices are either deployed on
    the field or within the soil. For OTA communication, solutions should be tailored
    to the changing environment due to irrigation and crop growth. In addition, any
    system on the field is exposed to natural elements and should be designed to sustain
    challenging conditions. Underground communication solutions, while mostly shielded
    from the environment, require the ability to communicate through soil and adjust
    its parameters to adapt to dynamic changes in soil. Inter-Connection of Field
    Machinery, Sensors, Radios, and Cloud: IOUT architecture should link a diverse
    multitude of devices on a crop field to the cloud for seamless integration. Accordingly,
    IOUT architecture will not only provide collected information but will also automate
    operations on the field based on this information. Based on these main required
    functionalities, a representative IOUT architecture is illustrated in Fig. 2,
    with the following components. Table I: Existing IOUT systems Underground Things
    (UTs): An UT consist of an embedded system with communication and sensing components,
    where a part of or the entire system resides underground. UTs are protected by
    weatherproof enclosures and, in underground settings, watertight containers. Buried
    UTs are protected from the farm equipment and extreme weather conditions. Sensors
    typically include soil temperature and moisture sensors, but a wide range of other
    soil-or weather-related phenomena can be monitored. Existing communication scheme
    include Bluetooth, Zig-Bee, satellite, cellular, and underground. A UT using Bluetooth
    [12] or underground wireless [6] can communicate over 100 meters, commercial products
    at ISM-band can cover three times larger distances, whereas longer-distance connectivity
    is possible through cellular or satellite. Considering the relatively large field
    sizes, nodes can be configured to form networks capable of transferring all the
    sensed information to a collector sink and selfheal in the event that nodes become
    unreachable (e.g., Irromesh). Nodes are generally powered by a combination of
    batteries and, if on field, solar panels. Cost of UTs is expected to be relatively
    inexpensive as they are deployed by the multitude [11]. Base stations are used
    as gateways to transfer the collected data to the cloud. They are installed in
    permanent structures such as weather stations or buildings. Base stations are
    more expensive as they are better safe-guarded and have higher processing powers
    and communication capabilities [11]. Mobile sinks are installed in equipment that
    move around the field periodically or as required, such as tractors and irrigation
    systems [6]. When weather conditions are favorable, turning on an irrigation systems
    only for data retrieval purpose is expensive. Alternatives unmanned vehicles such
    as quadrotors or ground robots. Cloud services are intended to use for permanent
    storage of the data collected, real-time processing of the field condition, crop
    related decision making, and integration with other databases (e.g., weather,
    soil). A summary of the existing academic and commercial architectures is provided
    in Table I. In most commercial products, OTA wireless communication is utilized,
    where the UT includes a high-end soil moisture and temperature sensor, connected
    to a tower in the field with cellular or satellite communication capabilities.
    Consequently, measurements generally represent a single point in the field and
    redeployment of the equipment is needed after planting and before harvest each
    season to avoid damages by the farming machinery. In addition, commercial products
    based on OTA wireless mesh networks and academic approaches featuring underground
    wireless communication have been emerging. Availability of such a diverse range
    of communication architectures makes it challenging to form a unified IOUT architecture
    with the ability to fulfill agricultural requirements seamlessly. This is further
    complicated due to the lack of standard protocols for sensing and communication
    tailored to the IOUT. In the following, we explain in detail the sensing (Sect.
    III) and communication (Sect. IV) mechanisms with a focus on desired characteristics
    of IOUT for real-time sensing and effective communications. SECTION III. Sensing
    The main functionality of OUT is real-time sensing. An overview of sensing technologies
    is presented next. 1) Soil Moisture Soil moisture (SM) sensors have been used
    for decades in crop fields to measure water content. Important SM measurement
    methods are described below: Gravimetric sampling is a direct and standard method
    of measuring SM. It is used to determine the volumetric water content of the soil.
    This method determines SM by a ratio of soil''s dry mass to the wet soil mass
    including the pore spaces. It requires manual sampling and oven drying of soil
    samples taken from the field. Resistive sensors such as granular matrix sensors
    work on the principal of electrical conductivity of water and measuring resistance
    changes based on soil water content. This method requires calibration of sensors.
    Capacitive sensors measure SM based on changes in capacitance of soil due to water
    content variations. Capacitive sensors, which are generally of higher accuracy
    than resistive sensors but cost more, are being used by commercial UTs. Ground
    Penetrating Radars (GPR) are based on the absorption and reflection of electromagnetic
    waves. Impulse, frequency sweep, and frequency modulated technologies are used
    in SM sensing. This method is used to to measure near-surface soil moisture (up
    to 10 ern), Neutron scattering probes and gauges use radiation scattering techniques
    to measure SM by estimating changes in neutron flux density due to the water content
    of the soil and are the most accurate soil moisture probes used in fields. They
    require specific licenses to be used. Gamma ray attenuation, time-domain reflectometry
    (TDR), and frequency-domain reflectometry (FDR) are other popular SM measurement
    approaches. Fig. 3: Soil moisture sensors: Top row: Gravimetric, resistive (watermark),
    capacitance, bottom row: GPR, TDR, neutron probe. Show All Common SM sensors used
    in fields are shown in Fig. 3. SM sensors are buried at depths of 5 cm to 75 cm
    in soil depending on the crop type and root depth. SM data obtained from these
    sensors is used to create soil moisture maps which help real-time decision making.
    SM sensors have been deployed in fields with increasing frequency. For example,
    the Nebraska Agricultural Water Management Network [14], [15], was established
    with only 20 growers in 2005 and currently serves over 1, 400 growers to enable
    the adoption of water and energy conservation practices using SM sensors. 2) Other
    Soil Physical Properties In addition to soil moisture sensing, other soil properties
    can be measured to populate the soil map such as the organic mater present in
    the soil, acidity (pH), percentage of sand, clay and and silt particles, and nutrients
    such as Mg, P, OM, Ca, base saturation Mg, base saturation K, base saturation
    Ca, CEC, K/Mg, and Ca/Mg ratios. In-situ, real-time measurement of these properties
    still face challenges due to size, cost, and technology limitations. 3) Electrical
    Conductivity and Topography Surveys The ability of soil to conduct current is
    described by soil electrical conductivity (EC). Coupled with field topography
    (elevation and slope), EC data gives better insight into the crop yield. EC (through
    contact and no-contact methods) is used to determine the amount of nitrogen usage,
    water holding and cation-exchange capacity, drainage, and rooting depth. EC maps
    are used to classify the field into zones. Then, precision agriculture practices
    such as variable rate irrigation, variable rate seeding, nitrogen, yield, and
    drainage management are applied based on zoning. SECTION IV. Wireless Connectivity
    Connectivity solutions for IOUT can be classified as in-field communications and
    cloud connectivity as discussed next. A. In-Field Communications In-field communication
    solutions integrate UTs and other communication entities on the field. Most commercial
    solutions utilize OTA communications, whereas lOUT are expected to feature wireless
    underground communications. OTA Communications Existing communication devices
    rely on LAN, cellular, and satellite technologies. For short-range communication
    and networking, license-free standards such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, and DASH7 are
    used in ISM bands. More recently, regulatory restrictions are relaxed by the FCC
    through new rules that allow the use of TV white space frequencies in farms (Order
    No. DA 16–307 Dated: Mar 24, 2016), where interference with other licensed devices
    is not expected. The major challenge for OTA communications is the lack of studies
    about the impacts of crops and farm environment on wireless propagation and associated
    tailored solutions to farms. Most devices used on farms were not designed to be
    used on agricultural fields and hence, suffer significantly. UG Communications
    UG communication solutions enable complete concealment of UTs, which decrease
    operation costs and impacts from external elements. For a buried UT radio, two
    types of communication scenarios arise. Aboveground communications involve communication
    between UTs and aboveground devices. Underground communication is carried out
    between UTs. Furthermore, due to the soil-air interface, aboveground communication
    links are not symmetric and need to be analyzed in terms of underground-to-aboveground
    and aboveground-to-underground communication. In Fig. 4, the path loss of these
    links are shown as a result of field experiments [6]. It can be observed that
    practical underground link distances are still limited to allow for practical
    multi-hop connectivity. Yet, communication ranges of up to 200 m is possible for
    aboveground communications. For UG communications, the communication medium is
    soil, which impact communication success in six main ways as discussed next. (1)
    Soil Texture and Bulk Density EM waves exhibit attenuation when incident in soil
    medium. These variations vary with texture and bulk density of soil. Soil is composed
    of pore spaces, clay, sand, and silt particles. Relative concentration of these
    particles result in 12 soil textural classes. Water holding capacity of each soil
    type is different because of its pore. For example, lower water holding capacity
    of sandy soil leads to lower attenuation and high RMS delay spread, whereas higher
    water holding capacities of silt loam and silty clay loam soils result in low
    RMS delay spread and higher attenuation [7]. (2) Soil Moisture The effective permittivity
    of soil is a complex number. Thus, besides diffusion attenuation, EM waves also
    suffer absorption by soil water content and its variations. Soil dielectric spectra
    and its conductivity depends on the soil moisture. The relative dielectric constant
    range of dry soil is between 2–6 and its conductivity ranges from 10−4 to 10−5
    Si/m, where soils at near-saturation level have a relative dielectric constant
    in the range of 5–15 and conductivity between 10−4 to 10−5 Si/m [16]. Coherence
    bandwidth of the underground channel is limited to a few hundred KHz range [8],
    which limits data rates. Coherence bandwidth also varies with soil moisture, making
    design of advanced techniques challenging. Fig. 4: Communication from soil. Show
    All (3) Distance and Depth Variations Sensors in IOUT applications are usually
    buried in the top sub-meter layer. Thus, in addition to distance, channel quality
    depends on deployment depth because of the impacts of the soil-air interface,
    which causes refraction of EM waves. Nodes at higher burial depths experience
    higher attenuation. (4) Antennas in Soil When an antenna is buried, its return
    loss characteristics change due to the high permittivity of soil [17]. Moreover,
    with the variation in soil moisture and hence soil permittivity, the return loss
    of the antenna varies with time too. Changes in return loss results in variations
    in resonant frequency, which is shifted to the lower spectrum, and system bandwidth,
    creating additional challenges for UG communication. (5) Frequency Variations
    The pathloss caused by attenuation is frequency dependent because of dipole relaxation
    associated with water. Generally, lower frequency spectrum has lower attenuation,
    because at higher frequencies, water absorption plays a dominant role. In addition,
    when EM waves propagate in soil, their wavelength shortens due to higher permittivity
    of soil than the air. Therefore, channel capacity in soil is also a function of
    operation frequency [17]. (6) Lateral Waves For two UTs, wireless underground
    communication is conducted through three major paths: direct, lateral, and reflected
    waves [7], [6]. Direct and reflected waves reside completely in soil and therefore,
    suffer from the challenges above. On the other hand, lateral waves travel partly
    on the soil-air interface in air, experiencing the lowest attenuation. Lateral
    waves plays an important role in extending underground communication ranges. B.
    IOUT and Cloud Due to limited processing power and energy considerations, data
    processing and decision making are not generally conducted locally. Depending
    on privacy considerations, field information can be stored in a private database,
    provided to the public databases, or shared with other users. There are online
    marketplaces where big data sets and agricultural apps are used to analyze a region
    and make decisions to maximize crop yield. Additionally, in-situ SM sensors can
    be linked to national soil moisture databases for complete, accurate, and comprehensive
    information of soil moisture. With the support of cloud services, real-time visualization
    and decision support can be provided. On the other hand, in the absence of storage
    or processing constraints, base stations on the fields can pull meteorological
    data from a weather service or soil information from a national service, fuse
    this information with in-situ data from UTs, and control the farming equipment.
    To have a fully automated system, farming equipment should include a controller
    that can be accessed remotely. Irrespective of in-situ or cloud processing, the
    main challenge is the integration of heterogeneous systems. Moreover, reliable
    data transfer from field to cloud, and cloud to farm will constitute an important
    functionality of the IOUT cloud architecture. This functionality will not only
    help link fields over vast geographical areas to the cloud, but will also facilitate
    local farms to use this data for assessment and improvement of crop yield. SECTION
    V. IOUT Testbeds In this section, we present an overview of testbeds which facilitate
    IOUT developments for system-wide and communication-specific challenges. A. An
    Agriculture Field Testbed IOUTs can be used to ascertain the amount of water and
    fertilizer to be applied using an irrigation control system. An IOUT testbed has
    been deployed on the South Central Agricultural Lab (SCAL) in Clay Center, Nebraska.
    The testbed covers a 41 acres of research field where an advanced center pivot
    irrigation system was installed in 2005 to research longterm dynamics of variable
    rate irrigation and fertigation, crop water and nutrient uptake, water stress
    and yield relationships, develop crop production functions, and associated numerous
    topics under full and limited irrigation and rainfed settings [18]. In this testbed,
    a mobile sink is installed on one of the controller towers. The current configuration
    includes two antennas facing opposite directions allowing the reception of data
    from nodes that are over 200 meters away. A solar panel provides sustainable energy
    in the field. 10–16 UTs are deployed in the field. Each UT is capable of measuring
    soil temperature and soil moisture from four external sensors buried at depths
    of 1, 2, 3, and 4 feet. UTs are powered by lithium-ion batteries and protected
    by a watertight enclosure. The spatio-temporal real-time information from UT is
    fused at the mobile sink and sent to the cloud using 4G communications. The cloud
    communicates with the center pivot controller for automated irrigation control.
    Fig. 5: The indoor testbed [7]. Show All B. Wireless Underground Communication
    Testbeds Agronomy and Horticulture Greenhouse in the University of Nebraska-Lincoln
    east campus houses two wireless underground communication testbeds. An outdoor
    testbed consist of a grid of 4 × 2 underground nodes with an above-ground node
    that can be moved to any location to study aboveground-to-underground, underground-to-aboveground,
    and underground-to-underground communications behavior. Underground nodes are
    connected through power-over-Ethernet (POE) to reprogram and power the nodes.
    This setup provides flexible underground experimentation by eliminating the need
    for replacing the power sources, exposure of the equipment, and the constant removal
    and burial of the node. An indoor testbed has been designed and developed inside
    the greenhouse which supports dynamic soil moisture control for wireless underground
    communication experiments [7]. The testbed is made of 100 inches long, 36 inches
    wide and 48 inches high wooden box with drainage system to hold 90 cubic feet
    of packed soil (Fig. 5). Antennas are buried at different depths and distances
    for controlled wireless communication experiments. Moreover, testbed based on
    magnetic induction (MI) underground communications has been developed in [3].
    This testbed includes coils buried in the underground in lab settings. MI wave
    guide effects and 3-D coils are investigated using this testbed in different soil
    configurations. SECTION VI. Research Challenges Challenges in design and implementation
    of a precision agriculture based IOUT are highlighted in this section. Due to
    dynamic changes in the communication medium in soil, UTs should be able to cognitively
    adjust their operation parameters such as operation frequency, modulation schemes,
    error coding schemes for adaptive operation. Due to the close interactions with
    soil, these solutions should be tailored to UG communications instead of adopting
    existing OTA solutions [7], [8], [6]. Impacts of soil physical properties, soil
    moisture on UG communication should be modeled. Improving UTs with more complex
    functionalities will lead to higher energy consumption and faster battery depletion.
    Thus, improvements in energy efficient operation, sustainable energy sources,
    and energy harvesting are major challenges. Low-cost and multi-modal soil sensors
    that can sense soil physical properties in addition to moisture are required.
    While moisture provides valuable information for irrigation decisions, soil chemicals
    need to be sensed in-situ for variable rate fertigation applications. SECTION
    VII. Conclusions We introduced Internet of Underground Things (IOUT) for real-time
    decision making in agricultural fields. We have presented complete architectures
    for precision agriculture based IOUT. We have also analyzed the sensing and communications
    as the main component of the Internet of Underground Things. Challenges to the
    realization of IOUT are highlighted, and testbed designs for IOUT realization
    are presented. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like

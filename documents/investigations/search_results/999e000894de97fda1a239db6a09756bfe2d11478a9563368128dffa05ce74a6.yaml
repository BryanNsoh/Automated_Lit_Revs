    support systemInternet of Things 1. Introduction Irrigation management of most
    field crops aims to avoid plant water stress and maximize yield by supplying water
    to fully meet crop evapotranspiration (ETc). However, in wine grape (Vitis vinifera
    L.), fruit quality attributes are prioritized over yield as a production goal,
    and development of the berry and vine canopy are related to vine water status
    throughout the growing season [1,2]. For example, mild vine water stress between
    veraison (berry softening) and harvest is desirable to prevent berry splitting
    or dilution of flavors or sugars and to slow canopy growth in preparation for
    winter dormancy. Inducing vine water stress through deficit irrigation has also
    been shown to increase vine water use efficiency [3], [4], [5]. Water resources
    in the western U.S. are experiencing unprecedented competitive demand from irrigated
    agriculture, growing urban populations, and environmental and ecosystem restoration.
    Groundwater levels in many areas have steadily decreased from historic levels
    and ground water use is approaching an unsustainable level. In addition, the western
    US is experiencing the worst megadrought since 800 CE [6] leading to historically
    low water levels in many of the regions water reservoirs. Warmer winter temperatures
    due to climate change are predicted to reduce future mountain snowpack, which
    is the source of early irrigation developments in much of the western U.S. The
    growing demand on surface and groundwater resources combined with climate change
    necessitates increased water resource stewardship and crop water productivity
    to meet food and fiber needs of a growing population. Wine grape production in
    semiarid regions of the pacific northwestern U.S. is well established but relies
    on irrigation during the growing season for vine growth, survival, and economically
    viable yield. Optimum management of irrigation requires routine direct or indirect
    monitoring of vine water status [7]. Indirect methods for accessing plant water
    status include soil water content or soil water potential measurement and atmospheric-based
    methods [7,8]. Soil water monitoring is a widely accepted tool for estimating
    crop water needs for field crops but in the case of vineyards there are several
    disadvantages. These include spatial variability in soil characteristics and 3-dimensional
    soil wetting patterns from drip irrigation leading to the need to install several
    sensors, which complicates information management and increases cost. Additionally,
    there is a lack of established thresholds for determining vine water status and
    severity [7]. Atmospheric based methods include Bowen ratio energy balance and
    eddy covariance to determine ETc and infer plant water status by comparing measured
    ETc to estimated non-water stressed ETc. These techniques require expensive sensors,
    skilled technical knowledge, and large uniform upwind fetch, especially for eddy
    covariance, which make them unsuited for small commercial vineyard water management
    purposes [7]. A more detailed discussion of indirect methods is provided by Rienth
    and Scholasch [8]. Direct (plant-based) methods for determining plant water status
    rely on measurements of physical plant variables. Unlike indirect methods, plant-based
    methods use the plant as a biosensor in a soil-plant-atmosphere continuum. Conventional
    direct methods include leaf or stem water potential, visual observation, stomatal
    conductance or photosynthesis, sap flow, trunk diameter and leaf turgor pressure
    [7,9]. Midday stem or leaf water potential (LWP) is the most commonly accepted
    direct measurement of vine water status [10] and critical upper and lower water
    stress thresholds have been established [7], making it an effective tool for deficit
    irrigation management. The primary disadvantages of LWP are the limited time of
    day for measurement, the need for repeated measurements due to plant variability,
    and a need for several equipped and trained personnel to cover a vineyard. Visual
    observation is based on the visual growth characteristics of the apical meristem
    or apex of vines, tendrils, and leaf orientation of numerous vines [1,8]. The
    drawbacks of this method include low sensitivity to moderate water stress, time
    lag between water stress and visual observation, and the cost of trained personnel
    to cover a vineyard. Stomatal conductance measures the ease of passage of CO2
    or water vapor through the stomata and is a good indicator of plant response to
    water stress because it changes with atmospheric demand and soil water status.
    It has been shown to indicate the degree of vine water stress but varies with
    timing of measurement and leaf canopy location [7]. The primary disadvantages
    are the cost of the equipment, constant need for calibration, technical skill
    to operate. Sap flow, trunk diameter and leaf turgor are direct measures that
    have been shown to be indictors of plant water stress. However, they have not
    been widely adopted in regional commercial vineyards but have the advantage of
    being automated, which facilitates integration into a deficit irrigation management
    program. Detailed descriptions of other direct methods and their respective advantages
    and disadvantages are provided by [7], [8], [9]. Plant canopy temperature increases
    when solar radiation is absorbed and cools when water is evaporated (transpiration)
    within the leaf structure. A water-stressed plant canopy will reduce transpiration
    and have a higher temperature than a non-stressed canopy [11,12]. This physical
    plant response to water stress makes canopy temperature measurement a viable direct
    method for assessing plant water status. Infrared radiometers have been used to
    measure plant canopy temperature under research field conditions to estimate evapotranspiration
    and drought stress in many crops [13], [14], [15], including grape [16], [17],
    [18], [19], [20], [21]. Infrared thermometry is nondestructive, can be measured
    continuously, can be stationary or mounted on mobile platforms for spatial and
    temporal monitoring [9,[20], [21], [22]], and can be less expensive [23] than
    soil water sensing. Canopy temperature is related to plant water status, but it
    also depends upon solar radiation (Rs), air temperature (Ta), humidity (RH), and
    wind speed (WS) among other things. A method of using canopy temperature to calculate
    a CWSI for irrigation scheduling was proposed over 40 years ago by Idso et al.
    [15] and Jackson et al. [14]. The CWSI normalizes measured canopy temperature
    relative to reference threshold canopy temperatures for a well-watered vine (TLL)
    and a water stressed, non-transpiring vine (TUL) under identical weather conditions,
    resulting in an empirical CWSI value between, 0 (no water stress) and 1 (maximum
    water stress). Unfortunately, the need for TLL and TUL reference temperatures
    under identical weather conditions has limited the use of a CWSI to research scale
    studies and precluded its adoption on a commercial scale [9]. Alternatives to
    actual measurement of crop reference temperatures have been investigated, such
    as artificial wet and dry surfaces [16,[24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29]] and
    physical and empirical models [14,26,[30], [31], [32], [33]] to predict reference
    temperatures. The required maintenance of an artificial surface has limited use
    on a commercial scale, leaving physical or empirical models as the most logical
    choice. King et al. [33] used measured temperatures of non-water stressed wine
    grape canopies to develop data driven models (neural network, regression) to estimate
    TLL. The models were used to calculate CWSI values for research plots of Malbec
    grapes vines that were differentially irrigated to induce differing severities
    of vine water stress [19] and validated by comparing, over a 5-year period, CWSI
    values with LWP and fASW. The CWSI calculated using model predicted reference
    temperatures was well correlated with LWP (R2 = 0.54) and fASW (R2 = 0.71). When
    CWSI values were used to trigger 28 mm irrigation events, CWSI values increased,
    LWP became more negative, seasonal water application decreased, and grape cluster
    weight decreased. These results demonstrated that a CWSI could be used as an effective
    irrigation scheduling tool for wine grape. Irrigation scheduling based on canopy
    temperature has not been adopted on a commercial scale by vineyard irrigation
    mangers in semiarid regions of northwestern U.S. as evident by the lack of commercial
    systems supporting the application. The objectives of this study were to: develop
    a CWSI based IoT DSS for precision irrigation of wine grape under semiarid conditions;
    field test the CWSI based IoT DSS in two, small acreage commercial estate vineyards
    over four growing seasons; validate the IoT derived CWSI values by statistical
    correlation with LWP and fASW at each vineyard site; and evaluate vineyard manager
    annual consistency in irrigation scheduling. Vineyard irrigation managers were
    allowed to freely decide if they wanted to use the CWSI based IoS DSS for irrigation
    scheduling. Consistency of plant water stress and irrigation application across
    multiple years was used to gage success of the CWSI based IoT DDS system for irrigation
    scheduling as implemented by the vineyard manager. 2. Methods and materials 2.1.
    Field study site characteristics This study was conducted on two small (< 7 ha)
    family owned and operated commercial vineyards in southwestern Idaho USA over
    a four-year period (2017–2020). Both operations were estate vineyards in that
    they have associated wineries that produce branded commercial wines. The vineyard
    sites were located within 30 km of each other but differed in their soil characteristics
    and soil water holding capacities. The soil at vineyard-A (V-A) was a Greenleaf-Owyhee
    silt loam (fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Xeric Calciargids) characterized
    as very deep well drained with moderately slow permeability and an available water
    capacity of 0.2 cm−1 (USDA Web Soil Survey). Vineyard-B (V-B) was located adjacent
    to an ancient volcanic vent that had been subjected to limited volcanic rock mining.
    The vineyard site was reclaimed using surrounding soil and original overburden
    to cover exposed rock resulting in a highly disturbed soil profile. The natural
    soils at the site were Turbyfill fine sandy loam (coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive,
    calcareous, mesic Xeric Torriorthents) and Jacquith loamy fine sand (Sandy, mixed,
    mesic Xereptic Haplodurids), both of which are moderately deep and well drained
    in their natural state with moderately rapid permeability. Available water capacity
    of the Turbyfill fine sandy loam and Jacquith loamy fine sand were 0.12 and 0.07
    cm−1, respectively (USDA Web Soil Survey). Vines in both vineyards were grown
    with double trunks on a vertically shoot positioned, two-wire trellis system with
    moveable catch wires. The vines were trained to bilateral cordons and spur-pruned
    annually to approximately 16 buds m−1 of cordon. Row by vine spacing was 2.7 m
    x 1.8 m at V-A and 2.7 m x 1.5 m at V-B. Irrigation at both sites was applied
    using drip irrigation tubing suspended about 30 cm above ground in the vine row.
    Drip emitter spacing was 76 cm with a flow rate of 3.8 L hr−1 at V-A and 61 cm
    with a flow rate of 1.9 L hr−1 at V-B. The wine grape cultivar evaluated at V-A
    was Chardonnay (2017–2020) and the cultivars at V-B were Malbec (2017–2019) and
    Cabernet Sauvignon (2020). 2.2. Field measurements and instrumentation hardware
    and software Canopy temperature was measured using wired infrared radiometers
    (SI-121, Apogee Instruments, Logan, Utah) with a 36° field of view. The radiometers
    were placed along a single vine row to prevent potential damage to sensor cables
    from vineyard equipment. In each vineyard, two (2017, 2018, 2019) or four (2020)
    radiometers were installed per cultivar. Radiometer cable lengths were 30 m allowing
    a maximum distance of 60 m between radiometers within a vine row. The radiometers
    were installed on vines with representative canopy size and positioned approximately
    15 to 30 cm above fully expanded leaves located at the top of the vine canopy.
    Radiometers were pointed northeasterly at approximately 45° from nadir, with the
    sensor view aimed at the center of solar noon sunlit leaves. The temperature sensing
    area of vine canopy was approximately 10 to 20 cm in diameter and received full
    sunlight exposure during midday. The possibility of background bare soil visibility
    was limited by multiple leaf layers within the canopy below the measured canopy
    location. The infrared radiometer sensor view was periodically adjusted as necessary
    to ensure that the field of view concentrated on sunlit leaves near the top of
    the canopy. The infrared radiometers were installed after fruit set, usually mid
    to late June. Solar radiation (Rs) (SP-110 pyranometer, Apogee Instruments, Logan,
    UT), air temperature (Ta), relative humidity (RH) (HMP50 temperature and humidity
    probe, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT), and wind speed (WS) (034B, Met One Instruments,
    Grants Pass, Ore.) were measured in each vineyard at a height of 2.5 m. Canopy
    temperature and weather parameters were measured every minute and recorded as
    15 min averages on a datalogger (CR6, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT). The weather
    sensors and data logger were installed in the same vine row and located midway
    between the infrared temperature sensors. The equipment was removed at harvest,
    usually mid to late September. A 1.2 m soil moisture sensor (Drill and Drop, SenTek
    Sensor Technologies, Stepney, SA) was installed in the vine row within 3 m of
    the data logger and within 20 cm of an irrigation drip line emitter. Soil moisture
    was recorded every 30 min measured at 10 cm depth increments to a depth of 1.2
    m. In 2017 and 2018, a tipping bucket rain gage (RainWise, Boothwyn, PA) was placed
    under an drip line irrigation emitter to record cumulative irrigation application
    amount. The rain gage was connected to the data logger and total emitter water
    application was recorded in 15 min and 24 hr increments. In 2019 and 2020 a flow
    meter (36MP.75RG.1, Netafim Irrigation, Inc., Fresno, CA) was installed in the
    irrigation drip line and connected to the data logger. Flow rate was recorded
    in 15 min increments. The field data logger was equipped with a machine-to-machine
    cellular modem (RavenXTA CDMA or RV50 Sierra wireless AirLink, Campbell Scientific
    Inc., Logan, UT) to provide real-time access to the sensor data using commercial
    software. Study personnel accessed sensor data using datalogger management software
    (LoggerNet 4.5, Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, UT). Vineyard managers were provided
    real-time sensor data access through a website. The website was hosted on the
    field data logger. Data logger webpage publishing software (RTCM Pro Development
    4.3.3.6, Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, UT) was used to design and publish the
    webpage on the data logger. The website was accessible using either a personal
    computer or a smart phone. The website provided graphical pages with running 12-day
    histories of daily CWSI, soil water content at each depth increment, fASW, daily
    irrigation depth, and latest 15-min averaged weather data, each on a separate
    webpage. The website was available between the hours of 6:00 to 22:00 MDT. The
    cell phone modem was powered down overnight to conserve battery power and to reset
    the modem in case of intruder hacking and malware. The data logger battery was
    charged using a 20 W solar panel. Midday LWP was measured at 7-to-10-day intervals
    in both vineyards in each year of the study to verify vine water status and to
    investigate its correlation with daily CWSI. LWP was measured between 13:00 and
    15:00 MDT on two fully expanded, sunlit leaves from vines adjacent to each installed
    infrared radiometer using a pressure chamber (model 610, PMS Instrument Co., Albany,
    OR) as described by Levin et al. [10,34]. 2.3. Calculated webpage values Information
    shown on webpages hosted by the field data logger was based on several calculations
    performed by datalogger software using measured sensor values. The calculated
    values included daily CWSI, fASW, and daily irrigation depth. Daily CWSI was calculated
    as the average 15-min CWSI between 13:00 and 15:00 MST, which corresponded to
    −1 to +1.5 hr of solar noon. The 15-min CWSI was calculated using the empirical
    equation developed by Idso et al. [15] as: (1) where Tc is measured canopy temperature
    of fully sunlit leaves ( °C). The TLL reference temperature ( °C) was estimated
    using cultivar specific neural network models [32]. Inputs to the neural network
    models were 15-minute averaged values of measured Rs, Ta, RH and WS. The TUL reference
    temperature ( °C) was estimated using the energy balance-based equation of [14]
    as: (2) where ra is aerodynamic resistance (s m−1), Rn is net radiation (W m−2),
    cp is heat capacity of air (J kg-1 °C-1), and ρ is density of air (kg m−3). Aerodynamic
    resistance was estimated using the approach of [30] as described by [33] using
    the same cultivar specific data sets for well-watered wine grapes in southwestern
    Idaho. Values used for ra were 16.8 s m−1 for Malbec and 21 s m−1 for Chardonnay
    and Cabernet Sauvignon. Net radiation was estimated as Rn = 0.9Rs – 60 [33]. The
    fASW for a given soil profile depth was calculated as: (3) where θi is measured
    volumetric soil water content for depth i, θpwpi is estimated volumetric soil
    water content at permanent wilting point for depth i, θfci is estimated volumetric
    soil water content at field capacity at depth i, and n is the number of 10 cm
    soil water content measurement depths considered. Field capacity for each soil
    depth was estimated as the maximum soil water content measured 24 h after an irrigation
    event or soil water content at the beginning of the season for depths below the
    irrigation wetting front. Permanent wilting point (PWP) for each soil depth was
    estimated as 50% of field capacity (FC) or minimum soil water content measured.
    Values for θfci and θpwpi were continually adjusted during the beginning of the
    season as soil water content measurements were collected. Three values of fASW
    were presented in the webpage: 0 to 60 cm, 0 to 90 cm, and 0 to 120 cm. Values
    shown in the webpages were expressed in English units as they were designed for
    use by vineyard managers located in the U.S. Daily irrigation depth was calculated
    as the volume of water applied between 0:00 and 24:00 MDT divided by the drip
    irrigation lateral length represented and vine row spacing. In the case of rain
    gauges, the volume of water measured by the rain gage was divided by the emitter
    spacing and vine row spacing. In the case of flow meters, the daily volume of
    water applied was calculated by summing the flow rate in each 15 min interval
    multiplied by the time interval. The volume of water was divided by lateral length
    downstream of the flow meter and vine row spacing. The calculated irrigation depth
    was presented in the English unit of inches. 2.4. Irrigation DSS vineyard manager
    accessible webpages The irrigation DSS was comprised of six separate webpages
    that displayed daily CWSI values (Fig. 1), soil moisture at depth of 0 to 60 cm
    (0 - 24 in) (Fig. 2), soil moisture at a depth of 70 to 120 cm (28 - 48 in) (Fig.
    3), fASW at three soil depths (Fig. 4), irrigation amount (Fig. 5), and weather
    (Fig. 6). The webpages showing CWSI, soil water content (%) and fASW displayed
    data as a running 12-day history. Each webpage had a top menu showing all available
    webpages. CWSI values were graphed independently for each infrared radiometer
    and as the average value of all radiometers. An example of the main webpage at
    site V-B for 13 August through 25 August 2020 is shown in Fig. 1. Soil volumetric
    water content (%) was graphed independently at depth increments of 10 cm (4 inches)
    (Figs. 2,3). fASW (Fig. 4) was graphed independently for soil depths 0 to 60 cm
    (0 - 24 in), 0 to 90 cm (1 – 36 in), and 0 - 120 cm (0 – 48 in). Daily irrigation
    amounts (Fig. 5) represent water applied between 0:00 and 24:00 MDT. Fig. 1, Fig.
    2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5 show data for V-B from 13 August through 23 August 2020.
    Weather conditions in each vineyard (Fig. 6) were displayed as the most current
    15-min average value for Ta, RH, WS, and wind direction. For ease of use, the
    values for Ta and RH were displayed graphically as well as numerically. Download

    tools. Graphical, linear, and multiple linear regression and variance analysis
    were used to quantify and evaluate relationships between variables. Regression
    line significance was evaluated using ANOVA (p < 0.05). Neural network model development
    was performed using the MATLAB Neural Network Toolbox (MathWorks, Natick, Mass.)
    [33]. Graphs were generated using Sigmaplot 14 (Systat Software, San Jose, CA).
    3. Results 3.1. Climatic conditions Climatic conditions during the four-year study
    relative to 20-yr (1996–2016) averages are summarized in Table 1. The climatic
    conditions during the four study years were generally within one standard deviation
    of the 20-yr mean with a few exceptions. Alfalfa-based reference evapotranspiration
    was greatest in 2018 and exceeded the 20-yr mean by more than one standard deviation.
    The combination of high mean air temperature and daily solar radiation, and low
    mean relative humidity and April through September precipitation resulted in the
    high reference evapotranspiration in 2018. October through March precipitation
    was greatest in 2017 and exceeded one standard deviation of the 20-yr mean. April
    through September precipitation in 2019 and 2020 exceeded one standard deviation
    of the 20-yr mean. Growing-degree days was greatest in 2018, coinciding with highest
    mean daily air temperature and high reference evapotranspiration. Table 1. Climatic

    water stress Linear relationships between plant water stress measures fASW, LWP,
    and CWSI at each vineyard for the four study years combined are summarized in
    Fig. 7. All the linear relationships between the water stress measures were statistically
    significant (p < 0.001). The linear relationships between fASW versus LWP and
    daily CWSI versus LWP had similar R2 values for both vineyards. The linear relationship
    between fASW and CWSI at V-B had a much greater R2 than for V-A (0.58vs 0.32).
    Variability in the fASW vs CWSI data was similar between the vineyards, but daily
    CWSI spanned a greater range at V-B resulting in a greater R2. The greatest data
    variability occurred between daily CWSI and LWP for both vineyards. The greater
    variability is likely due to CWSI and LWP responding differently to Ta, RS, RH
    and WS. Download : Download high-res image (968KB) Download : Download full-size

    Relationship between seasonal CWSI and seasonal irrigation amounts The seasonal
    average values for daily CWSI and the cumulative amount of irrigation applied
    between 1 July and 15 September in each study year at each vineyard are shown
    in Table 2. The seasonal average daily CWSI values for each vineyard were largely
    consistent over the four-year study. Seasonal daily CWSI values were higher for
    V-B as the vineyard manager preferred higher plant water stress than the manager
    of V-A. The higher daily CWSI value at V-B was also higher because it would rapidly
    increase a couple days after an irrigation event due to the low water holding
    capacity of the sandy soil. Table 2. Average daily crop water stress index (CWSI)

    DSS vineyard manager accessible webpages An example of the irrigation DSS running
    12-day history and weather webpage is presented for V-B for 13 to 23 August 2020
    (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6). An irrigation event, starting
    the evening of 18 August 2020, increased soil water content to a depth of 60 cm
    (24 inches) (Fig. 2) and decreased the daily CWSI to near zero (Fig. 1). An irrigation
    event starting on the evening of 23 August increased soil water content to a depth
    70 cm (28 inches) (Fig. 3) and decreased the daily CWSI to near zero (Fig. 1).
    The estimated fASW increased on 18 August and 23 August (Fig. 4) as soil water
    contents increased (Fig 2) due to irrigation events. Prior to irrigation on 18
    Aug, daily CWSI was greater than 0.6 (Fig. 1), while fASW for the 0 to 120 cm
    soil profile was about 0.3 and increased to greater than 0.8 following irrigation
    on 23 Aug. Midday on 25 August daily CWSI was near zero while fASW was about 0.78.
    An overnight irrigation event started on 18 August is depicted as two irrigations
    since it spanned two days (Fig. 5). The first irrigation event applied about 10
    mm (0.4 inch) and the second irrigation event applied about 21 mm (0.8 inch),
    which collectively decreased daily CWSI from 0.6 to near zero (Fig. 1) and increased
    fASW from 0.3 to 0.8 (Fig. 4). The observed variability among radiometers on the
    irrigation DSS webpage for daily CWSI values (Fig. 1), was likely attributed to
    high spatial variability in soil profile characteristics. Limiting historical
    data on the irrigation DSS webpage to a running 12-day period was to optimize
    time efficiency of the user web browsing experience. The infield data logger that
    hosted the irrigation DSS webpages had limited computing capacity, so limiting
    the historical data time frame to a running 12-days offered a reasonable compromise
    between data viewability on a cell phone and time to transfer the data to the
    user webpage interface device. A running 12-day historical record was sufficient
    to establish trends in CWSI or soil water availability useful in making irrigation
    management decisions. The vineyard managers in this study only wanted to know
    if they need to irrigation today and were largely uninterested in historical CWSI
    values. The 12-day historical length can be increased if deemed necessary by uploading
    the data to the cloud and using cloud based graphical software to display the
    same information for the full growing season. 4.2. Relationship between measures
    of vine water status and irrigation A seasonal graph of the irrigation DSS data
    for V-B in 2020 shows an interconnected response among the measured and estimated
    DSS parameters (Fig. 8). Values for daily CWSI and midday leaf water potential
    shown in Fig. 8 are averages of the measured values and fASW is for the 0 to 120
    soil profile. Prior to initiation of measurements on 13 June, there was above
    average precipitation in 2020 (Table 1). The prior precipitation is evident by
    the status of well-watered vines on 13 June (Fig. 8). Daily CWSI was low, fASW
    was > 0.55 and LWP was less negative. A rainfall event on 29 June was associated
    with a decrease in the daily CWSI, an increase in fASW and a less negative LWP.
    Prior to the irrigation event on 20 July, the daily CWSI steadily increased coincident
    with a more negative LWP. The small irrigation event on 8 July had minimal influence
    on daily CWSI or LWP potential as fASW remained below 0.55. Irrigation events
    prior to 17 August reduced CWSI and made LWP less negative for only a few days
    and fASW remained 〈 0.55 for most of the duration. The seasonally highest CWSI
    values and most negative LWP values occurred between 28 July and 24 August. The
    irrigation event on 23 August and precipitation events on 17 and 24 August decreased
    CWSI to near zero, increased fASW to 〉 0.55 and LWP became less negative, all
    of which indicated a short period of increase in vine water status. Between 24
    August and the next irrigation event on 1 September, the CWSI increased, fASW
    decreased, and LWP became more negative. The relatively large (> 25 mm) irrigation
    event on 3 September decreased daily CWSI to 〈 0.2, increased fASW to 〉 0.8, and
    LWP became less negative. The last irrigation on 11 September reduced daily CWSI
    to near zero, increased fASW to nearly 0.9 and increased LWP to > −0.9 MPa. Download

    Average daily CWSI, fraction of available soil water (fASW) in 0 to 120 cm soil
    profile, midday leaf water potential (LWP), precipitation, and irrigation during
    the 2020 growing season at V-B. The fASW is a common method used to express crop
    water stress for field crops. Wine grape is well-watered when fASW is greater
    than 0.55 [35]. The corresponding seasonal responses of fASW, midday LWP, and
    the daily CWSI to irrigation and precipitation events (Fig. 8) supports the usefulness
    and accuracy of daily CWSI for real-time irrigation management of wine grape irrespective
    of soil characteristics that may influence these values. 4.3. Comparison of vine
    water stress measures between vineyards The slopes of linear relationships between
    the fASW versus LWP or daily CWSI differed between vineyards (Fig. 7). This may
    be partially due to differences in soil textures and permeability between the
    vineyards. V-A had a silt loam soil with low to moderate permeability while V-B
    had a sandy soil with high permeability. Water applied by the drip irrigation
    emitter likely resulted in different wetting patterns between vineyards with a
    deeper wetting pattern and less lateral spreading at V-B. There was likely limited
    soil water availability outside the immediate area of the emitter wetting pattern
    at V-B due to the low water holding capacity of the sandy soil. The soil water
    sensor was installed within 20 cm of an emitter and may have provided a better
    measurement of total soil water at V-B than V-A. The greater water holding capacity
    of the silt loam soil at V-A likely resulted in much more stored soil water from
    non-growing season precipitation, limiting the range in fASW over the growing
    season. However, the range in LWP were similar between vineyards. The low permeability
    of the soil at V-A may have restricted movement of soil water to the roots. Lastly
    the soil at V-A exhibited silica cementation ranging from 45 to 60 cm deep during
    soil sensor installation that may have restricted root growth. Ample soil water
    was measured below 60 cm in the root zone (data not shown) but very little extraction
    occurred during the growing season supporting the suspicion of limited root presence
    below 60 cm. The presence of ample soil water below 60 cm limited the range in
    fASW over the growing season and if it was largely unavailable to the vines would
    result in high daily CWSI and low LWP values despite fASW > 0.55. Despite a significant
    linear relationship between daily CWSI and midday LWP for both vineyards (Fig.
    7), there is considerable variability in the relationships, which precludes use
    of CWSI as a direct surrogate for LWP. A quadratic relationship between CWSI and
    LWP averaged over four wine grape cultivars was reported by [21], which depicted
    a similar degree of variability. [36] reported LWP ranging from −0.51 to −1.15
    MPa for well-watered grapevines in California with LWP linearly related to vapor
    pressure deficit (VPD) and Ta. They also reported a linear relationship between
    LWP and VPD for water stressed vines, but with reduced dependence on VPD compared
    to well-watered vines. The results of this study are consistent with the findings
    of [36] as the relationship between CWSI and LWP (Fig. 7) could be represented
    by a piece-wise linear relationship with CWSI ≈ 0 for LWP > −1.15 MPa. Solar radiation
    also influences LWP and LWP measurements should be collected on cloudless days
    [36]. The LWP values reported in this study were made over a wide range of VPD
    and on days with variable clouds. Additionally, some LWP values reported in this
    study were not collected on the same vine used for canopy temperature measurement,
    another source of variability in the relationship between CWSI and LWP. Overall,
    the presence of water stress detected by LWP measurement was also indicted by
    daily CWSI as calculated in this study, demonstrating that CWSI can be effectively
    used as an irrigation management tool for wine grape. The vineyard managers in
    this study were successful in using daily CWSI to achieve similar levels of plant
    water stress over multiple years, despite yearly differences in evaporative demand
    and growing season precipitation. The primary advantage of using CWSI as an irrigation
    management tool is the ability to automate data collection for daily monitoring
    of water stress with minimal labor. The linear relationship between fASW and daily
    CWSI exhibited less variability than the linear relationship between fASW and
    midday LWP (Fig. 7), especially for V-B. Thus, CWSI was a more direct indicator
    of available soil water than LWP. For V-B, when fASW was > 0.55, indicating well-watered
    vines, CWSI was 〈 0.1 supporting the rational than CWSI should approach zero for
    well-watered vines and approach one for severely watered stressed vines as the
    linear relationship depicts. However, for V-A a fASW value of 0.55 corresponds
    to a CWSI value 〉 0.5, which clearly does not follow the rational of CWSI, indicating
    an error in estimating fASW. As forementioned, this discrepancy is likely due
    to the effective root zone of the vines less than the 120 cm depth used to compute
    fASW. The estimates of FC and PWP of the soil at V-A could also be in error, which
    could lead to overestimation of fASW. If estimates of the fASW at V-A were reduced
    by 25%, a fASW value of 0.55 would correspond to a CWSI value < 0.1, like V-B
    and a CWSI value of 0.6 would correspond to a fASW of 0.37. The unrealistic over
    estimation of fAWC at V-A based on measured midday LWP and calculated daily CWSI
    highlights the difficulty in accurately quantifying the fASW using a single soil
    moisture profile measurement with drip irrigated crops. Drip irrigation results
    in a 3-dimensional wetting pattern that makes reliable estimation of root zone
    available soil water difficult at best. As an example, [37] reported that nine
    neutron probe measurements in one quadrant of a vine root zone, to a depth of
    3 m, was necessary to quantify soil water content of drip-irrigated grape vines.
    The difficulty in quantifying fASW in drip irrigated vineyards highlights the
    advantage of using plant-based methods for assessing vine water status such as
    CWSI provided the reference temperatures TLL and TUL can be reliably estimated.
    4.4. Seasonal CWSI and seasonal irrigation amounts between vineyard managers Neither
    vineyard manager in this study used any type of quantitative plant or soil water
    monitoring techniques to aid in irrigation management decisions prior to the installation
    of the CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS. Prior to this study, the irrigation managers
    at both vineyards made irrigation decisions based upon intuition, previous experience,
    and crop appearance [1]; so, there was a reasonable expectation that the vineyard
    managers would actively use the CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS. At the beginning
    of the first study year, the vineyard managers were briefed on the concept of
    CWSI for monitoring plant water status and were given the guideline that a daily
    CWSI value of 0.3 corresponded to approximately a 70% ET rate relative to a well-watered,
    100% ET. Beyond that initial guidance on how to interpret the daily CWSI value,
    the vineyard managers independently accessed the irrigation DSS webpages and made
    irrigation management decisions without input from research project personnel.
    At the end of the first study year both vineyard managers reported that they routinely
    accessed the irrigation DSS webpages for daily CWSI and fASW and used the information
    to support irrigation management decisions. In each of the remaining three years
    of the study, both vineyard managers, at their discretion, continued to access
    the irrigation DSS webpages and use the daily CWSI to facilitate irrigation management
    decisions. Seasonal average daily CWSI values (Table 2) were higher for V-B as
    the vineyard manager preferred higher plant water stress than the manager of V-A.
    The higher daily CWSI value at V-B was also higher because it would rapidly increase
    a couple days after an irrigation event due to the low water holding capacity
    of the sandy soil. Cumulative irrigation water application was surprisingly similar
    across vineyards, particularly for years 2018 through 2020, despite differences
    in soil water holding capacity and vineyard managers. Cumulative irrigation was
    low in the first year of the study at V-A due to above average non-growing season
    precipitation and higher water holding capacity of the silt loam soil. The narrow
    range in seasonal average daily CWSI (0.23 to 0.31 for V-A, and 0.36 to 0.44 for
    V-B) and cumulative irrigation (1.14 to 134 mm) in 2018 through 2020 suggests
    that vineyard managers effectively used the CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS to develop
    and maintain a consistent deficit irrigation management program. 4.5. Irrigation
    decision support system limitations The data-driven models used in this study
    provided reliable estimates of TLL and TUL in real-time for the semiarid climatic
    conditions of the study site, which was representative of the irrigated wine producing
    locations in the pacific northwestern U.S. The climatic conditions under which
    these data-driven models were developed were representative of the conditions
    in this study. However, the models may not perform as well in other regions with
    weather conditions outside the database range for model development. For example,
    in areas where daily windspeeds exceed 5 m sec−1. Wind speeds higher than 5 m
    sec−1 were not included in the database used for model development and grapevines
    are known to reduce stomatal conductance under high winds [38,39]. A wind induced
    reduction in stomatal conductance would result in an increase in canopy temperature
    independent of plant water stress and, since the data-driven model estimate of
    TLL would be too low, the calculated CWSI value would be elevated. Canopy temperature
    data for well-watered vines under high wind conditions would need to be included
    in the data set used to calibrate the neural network model for estimating TLL
    in windy semiarid regions. There are climatic conditions that can result in a
    calculated CWSI value of less than zero or greater than one. Wet canopy conditions
    typically result in measured canopy temperature that is less than the TLL predicted
    by the data driven model. This results in a negative CWSI value regardless of
    soil water availability. The original development of the CWSI concept by [15]
    was limited to clear sunny conditions. However, the data driven model for predicting
    TLL that was used in this study uses a database of well-watered vine canopy temperatures
    that were measured under variable cloudy conditions. The data driven model can
    therefore predict TLL for variably cloudy conditions. While the data-driven model
    used for predicting TLL is valid for solar radiation < 100 W m−2, TUL predicted
    using Eq. (2) for low levels of solar radiation can be approximately equal to
    TLL resulting in CWSI values less than zero or greater than 1. In this study,
    solar radiation less than 200 W m−2 often resulted in CWSI values less than zero.
    [40] also found solar radiation greater than 200 W m−2 was necessary to reliably
    use canopy temperature measurement for irrigation scheduling. In this study, daily
    CWSI was limited to a maximum of one and a minimum of zero in software to avert
    illogical values. The effect of wet canopy and low solar radiation on calculation
    of daily CWSI is evident in Fig. 8 on 18 and 24 August when a value of zero was
    assigned to daily CWSI during rainfall events. Limiting daily CWSI value to zero
    due to low solar radiation or wet canopy has little practical impact on use of
    CWSI for irrigation management as vine water stress is low under these circumstances
    due to low evaporative demand. When calculated CWSI is greater than one due to
    low solar radiation, limiting the value of one is more problematic as this results
    in a very erroneous representation of vine water stress that could lead to an
    unnecessary irrigation event. The climatic conditions leading to errors in calculating
    CWSI (rainfall, low solar radiation) are limited to 1-to-3-days in duration in
    the semiarid regions of the pacific northwestern U.S. and do not prevent application
    of the CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS system in the region. Software used to compute
    CWSI can be modified to detect these events and indicate to the user that the
    daily CWSI is unavailable. The daily CWSI value for the day preceding the rainfall
    or low solar radiation event can be used to guide irrigation decisions as plant
    water stress will decrease with rainfall or increase minimally as ET will be small
    under low solar radiation conditions. The CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS system
    developed and implemented in this study focused on two small acreage, commercial
    estate vineyards in semiarid southwestern Idaho USA. The climatic conditions at
    the study sites were representative of vineyards in the semiarid irrigated regions
    of the Pacific Northwest U.S. Small acreage vineyards can be found throughout
    the region and most do not have staff with irrigation science training, nor can
    they afford to hire trained vineyard irrigation management professionals or services.
    They need affordable irrigation scheduling tools that are easy to maintain and
    indicate when to irrigate to maintain a desired level of vine water stress. The
    vineyard managers at the study sites were pleased the system reliably and timely
    indication of vine water stress without having to spend time collecting soil water
    content measurements needed to estimate fASW or measure leaf water potential.
    While this study focused on small commercial estate vineyards, the IoT irrigation
    DSS concept is applicable to larger commercial vineyards where it could be used
    to provide plant water stress information needed to ground truth remote sensing
    based estimates of the ratio of actual-to-reference ET such as those provided
    by GRAPEX [41] or OPENET (https://openetdata.org). These remote sensing-based
    estimates have a minimum spatial resolution of 30 m, which is larger than the
    minimum dimension of irrigation management blocks in many commercial estate vineyards,
    hence they are not necessarily applicable to small commercial estate vineyards
    in the region. The CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS system implemented in this study
    used expensive scientific grade equipment, which proved invaluable to investigate
    the validity and adoptability of the system for irrigation management in wine
    grapes. The infrared temperature sensors cost $700 each, the multifunctional precision
    data logger was $2000, and the cellular modem with accessories was $700 totaling
    over $6100 excluding web page publishing software and climatic sensors. The soil
    moisture sensor cost is not included as it is unnecessary for calculation of the
    CWSI. The cost of the equipment used in this study is prohibitive for small vineyards
    to monitor just a single location. Vineyard manager acceptance and adoption of
    the CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS system implemented in this study justifies continued
    development and enhancement of the system. Future work will focus on incorporating
    less expensive infrared temperature sensors coupled with low-power, low-cost radio
    communications to allow wireless transfer of data to a base station. The base
    station will be connected to the internet using a cell phone modem and used to
    upload canopy temperature measurements across a vineyard to a cloud computing
    platform. The cloud computing platform software will be used to host webpages
    like those used in this project to allow real-time monitoring of canopy temperature
    at sensor locations across a vineyard and display daily CWSI for each canopy temperature
    monitoring location. These system enhancements would increase size of the vineyard
    area represented by daily CWSI measurements, encompassing multiple cultivars and
    irrigation blocks or irrigation management zones in larger vineyards. 5. Conclusions
    A CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS was developed, and field tested at two small acreage
    commercial wine grape estate vineyards in southwestern Idaho. Irrigation DSS webpages,
    accessible to vineyard managers via cell phone or computer, provided a running
    12-day history of CWSI daily values, soil moisture and current weather conditions.
    Data-driven models were used to estimate reference temperatures needed to calculate
    the CWSI using real-time environmental inputs for Rs, Ta, RH, and WS. Edge computing
    on a solar powered, field-deployed data logger was used to calculate the CWSI
    and fASW, and the data logger was used to host webpages of the irrigation DSS.
    The data logger was connected to a cellular modem located in the vineyard. The
    vineyard managers routinely used the irrigation DSS webpage for the CWSI and soil
    moisture to make irrigation management decisions. The average daily CWSI and irrigation
    amounts between 1 July and 15 September were similar between years over the four-year
    study for each study vineyard suggesting that the CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS
    was effective in assisting irrigation management decisions. Linear relationships
    between daily CWSI, midday LWP, and fraction of available soil water were significant
    (p < 0.001) at both study sites. The coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.58)
    for the linear relationship between daily CWSI and fraction of available soil
    water for V-B was better than that for midday LWP (R2 = 0.38) indicating daily
    CWSI was the most reliable indicator (less variable) of vine water status. The
    data-driven models used to estimate TLL and TUL can result in CWSI values outside
    the theoretical range of 0 to 1 when the canopy is wet from precipitation or solar
    radiation is <200 W m−2. These climatic conditions are limited to 1-to-3-days
    in duration in the semiarid regions of the pacific northwestern U.S. and do not
    prevent application of the CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS system in the region.
    These climatic instances can be detected by IoT irrigation DSS system software
    and indicate to the user that the daily CWSI is unavailable. The daily CWSI value
    for the day preceding the rainfall or low solar radiation event can be used to
    indicate plant water stress since it will decrease with rainfall or increase minimally
    as ET will be small under low solar radiation conditions. The hardware and software
    used to implement the CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS in this study was very reliable
    but too expensive for practical commercial application. Future work will focus
    on incorporating less expensive infrared temperature sensors coupled with low-power,
    low-cost radio communications to allow wireless transfer of data to a base station.
    The base station will be connected to the internet using a cell phone modem and
    upload canopy temperature measurements across a vineyard to a cloud computing
    platform. The cloud computing platform software will be used to host webpages
    like those used in this project to allow real-time monitoring of canopy temperature
    at sensor locations across a vineyard and display daily CWSI for each canopy temperature
    monitoring location. Funding The work reported in this paper was partially funded

    I. Introduction The agricultural sector consumes more than 70% of freshwater [1].
    While irrigating the crops, underwatering and overwatering are one of the pressing
    issues [2]. Overwatering causes the reduction of overall freshwater and causes
    the damage of crop roots, soil runoff, mineral runoff, and algal bloom to nearby
    freshwater sources [3], [4]. Precise and accurate irrigation is the smart way
    to avoid all these problems. Although IoT-based smart sprinklers have been developed
    in irrigation [5], [6], [7]. When used over a large area of farmland, however,
    the significant setup costs, additional recalibrating time, and additional issues
    make this strategy inefficient [7]. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have become
    a popular and affordable technology in recent years for capturing high-resolution
    remote sensing images for various precision agriculture applications. Drones have
    been used in agriculture for decades to spray pesticides, seeding, plant health
    monitoring, crop management [8], [9], [10], [11], [12] and production cost management
    [13], [14]. Drone imaging is combined with artificial intelligence for better
    accuracy [15]. Contactless Thermal Infrared imagery is an effective way to characterize
    the temperature variations of agricultural fields. TIR imaging has been used to
    find the kangaroos in Australia [16] and spider monkeys in Mexico [17]. Using
    TIR images, nesting bird habitats have been identified [18]. TIR images are used
    to evaluate forest ecosystems [19], archaeological sites [20], [21], [22] and
    Photovoltaic installations [23]. UAV-based TIR imaging technology is also used
    to detect compost pile conditions [24], peat fire detection [25], find mesocarnivores
    animals in farmland [26], search and rescue missions [27] and so on. Overwatering
    and crop irrigation issues can be solved more effectively with the help of a drone
    equipped with a thermal infrared camera. We used UAV based imaging to generate
    the thermal map of an area within minutes which in turn was used to control smart
    water sprinklers. A machine learning model trained using the image processing
    of TIR images, flight data, primary agricultural data, and methodological parameters
    such as geological location, soil moisture absorption, wind, and weather data
    can be used to predict the moisture content of each spot and choose appropriate
    sprinkler parameters. The nearby sprinkles can irrigate that dry area based on
    the ML decision generated and transmitted by the terrestrial edge station. Shorter
    running times and less water consumption are the results of carefully managed
    irrigation systems [16]. Irrigating in a circular pattern can be enabled by sprinklers
    with revolving nozzles [28]. Several smart irrigation models have been developed
    based on thermal imaging [29]. The entire farm area can be divided into small
    sectors. We adopted the sector division techniques of cellular communication,
    which divide a large segment into smaller circular segments [30], [31]. The smart
    sprinklers are placed at the center of each sector, which can hydrate a radius
    of 10–20 m. However, circular sections can create considerable overlaps. Hence,
    we approximated each sector as a hexagon, which has an equivalent area of 82%
    of a circular area, resulting in less overlapping of the irrigated land. The TIR
    and RGB images taken by the drone are processed using an onboard edge intelligence.
    The images processed using the onboard drone edge AI are converted into georeferenced
    data, which is then sent to the terrestrial edge unit using LoRa WAN communication.
    The terrestrial edge station generates the irrigation pattern using a trained
    machine learning model. This decision and irrigation pattern are transmitted to
    the smart sprinklers through LoRa WAN communication. Wi-Fi, ZigBee, NRF24L01 RF
    communication-based smart sprinklers are commonly used in short to midrange IoT
    smart irrigation [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37]. These cost-effective communication
    methods work well with a mid-range distance, around 100 meters, without an external
    antenna [38], [39], [40]. These communication methods can be upgraded with a dedicated
    antenna to achieve a distance of a few hundred meters. The LoRa WAN communication
    is suited for a large area because of its broad coverage of a few kilometers without
    secondary repeaters, reducing communication complexity and an initial setup cost
    [40], [41], [42]. Smart sprinkles can be powered by a solar panel that completely
    avoids batteries. Solar pumping without batteries has shown success in good sunlight
    [43], [44] Even while cloud computing has a great degree of scalability and is
    inexpensive, it has a significant latency and puts a lot of strain on the network’s
    bandwidth. For making the proposed system to be efficient and reliable, latency
    should be as low as possible. Edge computation is integrated into the system [45],
    [46], [47]. Edge computing, as defined by the Edge Computing Consortium (ECC),
    is a distributed open platform that integrates network, storage, and application
    capabilities at the network edge, near the objects or data sources [48]. Data
    processing under this computing paradigm does not need to send information to
    the cloud or other distant centralized or distributed systems. Edge intelligence
    is the next evolution of edge computing and artificial intelligence (AI). It intends
    to empower the edge by utilizing AI technologies [49]. Typical edge computing
    systems feature graphics units and CPUs to efficiently handle the trained ML model
    inside the standalone computational device. The clustering of computing resources
    in the edge system enables parallel processing of the overall task, which reduces
    latency and enables handling of complex tasks like image processing, machine learning,
    and deep learning within the cluster itself [50]. A. Proposed Drone-Aided Edge
    Computing Architecture The drone-aided smart irrigation system, shown in Figure
    1, is designed to accurately irrigate a farm area and lessen excessive freshwater
    use. The entire system consists of two subunits: aerial and terrestrial. The aerial
    unit has an autonomous drone in which the aerial edge computing station captures
    and processes thermal images and transfers the decision to the terrestrial sector
    through LoRa WAN communication. Terrestrial edge station, smart sprinklers, hydration
    pumps, and drone takeoff pads are in the terrestrial unit. FIGURE 1. System representation
    based on each level management. Show All The terrestrial edge can generate an
    irrigation pattern based on the georeferenced data from the drone. The machine
    learning (ML) model at the terrestrial edge server can generate an irrigation
    pattern and set the sprinkler parameters such as flow rate and flow direction
    in order to irrigate localized dry spots. By relying on a low-cost, low-resolution
    Thermal Infrared (TIR) camera, the captured images are preprocessed and georeferenced
    before sending them to the terrestrial edge station for identifying the most effective
    irrigation pattern—allowing network, memory, and computing resources to be saved.
    We built a custom quadcopter drone for aerial remote sensing. The custom-made
    drone is equipped with a raspberry pi 4 for image capturing and processing. An
    RGB camera (pi camera) and a TIR camera (FLIR) are used to collect the RGB and
    TIR spectral images of the ground to identify the localized dry spots. We used
    the open-source software Mission planner from Ardupilot to define the flight path.
    The area of surveillance can be selected using the software (Figure 1). The image
    capturing and processing are done using python programming on the onboard aerial
    edge station. This data is further transmitted to the terrestrial edge station
    for predicting and calculating the irrigation pattern using a trained machine
    learning model. Once all the necessary inputs (GPS Coordinates, Altitude, Speed
    of Hovering) are programmed in the drone, it is ready for remote sensing. After
    taking off, the drone moves from waypoint to waypoint and captures the RGB and
    the TIR images. These combined images ( T ig ), and the flight data (GPS coordinates-
    C gps , altitude- A lt , the direction of the drone- D i ) are transmitted to
    the onboard raspberry pi through the UART communication interface. An image processing
    algorithm in python took these data and calculated each localized dry spot and
    its relative dryness. This data is further transmitted to the terrestrial edge
    station for generating the irrigation pattern through a trained machine learning
    model. After the mission is completed, the drones are returned to the land for
    recharging. The terrestrial unit consists of the terrestrial edge station and
    sprinkler control unit. The terrestrial edge unit receives the georeferenced output
    through the LoRa WAN communication. The terrestrial edge station uses a raspberry
    pi 4-8GB to calculate the sprinkler control parameters (SCP) and to generate an
    irrigation pattern which is transmitted to the smart sprinklers through the LoRa
    WAN communication. LoRa WAN technology’s long range will cover a large area of
    land without having to use a secondary signal repeater. The sprinklers will direct
    the water spray to the localized dry spots by adjusting the water pressure and
    the servo rotation head of the sprinkler head. We describe the capabilities of
    a fully-functioning, deployed system. SECTION II. Materials and Methods A. Unmanned
    Aerial Vehicle (Drone) Construction We built a custom-made quadcopter for this
    project (Figure 2a). The drone has an ultra-durable polyamide nylon based F450
    frame, Pixhawk 2.4.8 flight controller, and the raspberry pi 4 4GB as a flight
    computer. The F450 frame manufactured by Readytoskey (ShenZhen ReadytoSky Technology
    Co., Ltd) is made of ultra-durable polyamide nylon-parts that can withstand more
    crash-landing damages. This frame has a 450 mm motor center, ideal for using 9-
    or 10-inch propellers. This frame allows us to use BLDC motors with 16, 19, and
    25-mm mounting hole centers. The frame has a height of 450 mm with landing gears
    attached, weighing approximately 280 grams. 800 to 1100 kV motors are ideal for
    this frame. We used the 900 kV BLDC motors manufactured by Readytoskey with 10-inch
    propellers (1045 props). 30 A Electronic Speed Controller (ESC) manufactured by
    Simonk is used to control the throttle speed of the drone (Figure S1). FIGURE
    2. a) Custom-made quadcopter, b) Aerial Edge Computing System. Show All The Pixhawk
    2.4.8 flight controller controls all the motor speeds along with data sensing.
    Pixhawk 2.4.8 has a 32-bit ARM Cortex M4 core processor with FPU, which has a
    rate of 168 MHz, 256 KB RAM, and 2 MB flash memory. The Pixhawk flight controller
    comes with an inbuilt accelerometer and gyroscope (MPU6050), MEMS barometer, ST
    Micro 16-bit gyroscope, ST Micro 14-bit accelerometer, and compass (magnetometer).
    Pixhawk can communicate with the peripheral device through UART, I2C, SPI, CAN,
    and USB transmission protocols. Which also supports 3.3 V to 6.6 V ADC inputs.
    The ESCs are connected to the main output channels of the Pixhawk, and the RF
    receiver is connected to the SBUS input. We construct a quadcopter drone, so we
    only need four main output channels to connect the ESCs. Channels 1 to 4 are used
    here. An external switch is connected to the Pixhawk to arm and disarm the drone.
    We used a FLYSKY FS-i6X RF transmitter and an FS- X6B receiver for transmission
    and manual control. FS-i6X is a 2.4 GHz dual antenna 6-channel RF transmitter
    based on AFHDS2A protocol, which can be upgraded to 10 channels with some DIY
    tricks. FS-i6X is compatible with PWM, PPM, i- bus, and s- bus protocols. This
    transmitter ranges from 500 to 1500 m in the air with a transmission power of
    less than 20 dBm. The 2.4 GHz dual antenna FS- X6B receiver is compatible with
    the FS- i6X and easily connected using the onboard pairing switch. The FS- X6B
    receiver supports six channels PWM, PPM, i- bus, and s- bus communication protocols.
    The receiver ranges up to 1500 m in the open field with optimum power. The RF
    receiver is connected to the SBUS input of the Pixhawk flight controller. The
    915 MHz radio telemetric module pair communicates between the terrestrial edge
    unit and the drone. This 500 mW transceiver can connect to the telemetric port
    of the Pixhawk flight controller. The other transceiver pair can be connected
    to the USB interface to receive flight data and transmit control signals through
    AT commands. The default baud rate of the full-duplex transparent serial link
    is 5600 baud. This transceiver pair ranges from 300 to 500 meters in an open field.
    The NEO- M8N external flight controller GPS module is connected to the Pixhawk
    to find the exact coordinates. This has a tracking sensitivity of 161 dBm and
    capturing sensitivity of 148 dBm with up to 10 Hz concurrent GNSS. NEO- M8N flight
    controller GPS module also includes an internal compass (magnetometer) which can
    be used to calculate the direction. There is a default port in the Pixhawk flight
    controller to connect the external GPS module, and the external compass can be
    connected to the I2C port. A 3500 mAh 3S Lithium polymer battery is used to power
    the drone and all the electronic systems. This 12.6 V battery can fly the drone
    for about 30 minutes at an altitude of 10–15 meters. A raspberry pi 4 4GB captures
    and processes the thermal, RGB images, along with the flight data from the Pixhawk
    flight controller (Figure 2b). The Broadcom BCM2711, Quad-core Cortex-A72 (ARM
    v8) 64-bit SoC powers the raspberry pi 4 at a 1.5 GHz clock frequency. We used
    a 4GB RAM model for this project. That is enough to do all our necessary work.
    The camera can be connected to USB ports, and a 32 GB class 10 micro-SD card is
    used to boot the raspberry Pi with Raspbian OS. A python program captures and
    processes the images and data to generate the basic information of each dry spot
    to create the data set for the machine learning model. A 12 V to 5 V - 3.5 A external
    power converter is used to power the raspberry pi from the LiPo battery. The Pixhawk
    flight controller can communicate with raspberry pi through the UART transmission
    protocol, which is used to extract the current drone location and altitude from
    Pixhawk. Open-source Mission planner software developed by Ardupilot (https://ardupilot.org/planner/)
    is used for drone calibration and assigning flight paths. Mission planner is installed
    on a Windows computer and connects the Pixhawk utilizing a micro-USB cable. The
    quadcopter firmware with the required orientation is flashed on the Pixhawk. After
    connecting all the peripherals to the Pixhawk, the flight controller is ready
    for calibration. RF throttle, accelerometer and gyroscope, compass, and ESC must
    be calibrated using Mission planner. Flightpath, waypoints coordinates, altitude,
    and flight mode can be programmed into the drone using the graphical interface
    of Mission Planner. Once completed, the drone can communicate with Mission Planner
    through the 915 MHz telemetry module while in the air. The specifications of important
    individual components are given in the Table. S1 B. Edge Intelligence in UAV Our
    system consists of aerial and terrestrial edge intelligence units. The UAV’s edge
    intelligence acquires and processes the TIR images, primary data such as drone
    hovering altitude, GPS coordinates, hovering speed, and direction to generate
    the pixel data information, which is transmitted to the terrestrial edge for further
    machine learning approach. The drone will take TIR photos of each hexagonal sector
    after the hovering pattern, route, and heights have been put into it. Due to outside
    factors like wind and weather, the TIR camera pictures are unreliable. After being
    stabilized, the pictures are fed into the image processing phase. Prior to using
    adaptive thresholding to find the localized dry areas, the original rectangle
    TIR pictures are cropped to a regular hexagonal image and divided into R, G, and
    B components. The information from the pixel data is gathered once the localized
    dry spots are georeferenced. Pixel data are transmitted to the terrestrial edge
    station through LoRa WAN communications (Figure 3). Using a trained machine model,
    the terrestrial edge station utilizes these data to determine the irrigation pattern
    and generate the sprinkler control parameters (SCP). FIGURE 3. Acquisition, stabilization,
    and processing of TIR images in the UAV Edge intelligence to generate pixel data
    information. Show All C. UAV Imaging The custom-made drone is equipped with a
    Thermal Infrared (TIR) and a RGB camera for capturing thermal and color images
    while hovering. Thermal Infrared (TIR) Camera: A Forward-Looking Infrared Camera
    (FLIR), Lepton 3.5 FLIR was used to capture thermal images (8 - 14μm wavelength).
    The camera had a resolution of 160×120 or 80×60 active pixels and an aperture
    angle of 57° with a shutter (Figure 2a). The camera operates in the 2.8- 3.1 V
    range, with an average power consumption of 650 mW during shutter events. The
    STM32-based breakout board is used to mount the FLIR camera (Figure S2a). A micro-USB
    cable can be used to connect the FLIR camera to a computer; in our case, a raspberry
    pi (Figure 2b). RGB Camera: The raspberry pi camera captures RGB images (Figure
    S2b). The V2 camera has a Sony IMX219 CMOS 8-megapixel sensor which has a sensor
    size of 3.674×2.760 mm(1/ 4 ′′ format) with an active pixel count of 3280×2464
    (total pixels 3296×2512 ). This supports 1080p 30fps, 720p 60fps VGA90 video modes
    along with 3280×2464 pixel still images. The IMX219 has a built-in 650 nm IR filter,
    which means it is non-sensitive to IR light and draws a peak current of 300 mA
    while operating. A ribbon cable connects the camera module to the CSI port of
    raspberry pi (Figure 2b). D. Edge Intelligence at Terrestrial Edge Unit The terrestrial
    edge intelligence station receives the pixel data information of the localized
    dry spots through the LoRa WAN receptor (Figure 4). The pixel data is composed
    of each pixel’s x and y coordinate location and the distance between each pixel
    to the sprinkler ( l ). The pixel data is further introduced to a trained machine
    learning model to predict the targets such as irrigation pattern and the sprinkler
    control parameters (SCP), such as the sprinkler head rotation angle ( θ ) and
    the water flow control valve rotation angle ( ∅ ) (Figure 5). The dataset consisted
    of a training dataset making up 80% of it and a testing dataset making up 20%
    of the pixel data information. FIGURE 4. Raspberry pi 4 based portable terrestrial
    edge intelligence station. Show All FIGURE 5. Training and testing stage of the
    machine learning model to predict the irrigation pattern and sprinkler control
    parameters. Show All E. Construction of Smart Sprinkler The custom-made smart
    sprinkler consists of LoRa based IoT receiver, a servo mechanism for controlling
    the sprinkler nozzle direction, a water solenoid for controlling water quantity,
    and a ball valve rotator for controlling the pressure. An ATSAMD21 microcontroller
    controls the direction of irrigation, duration, and force of water through the
    sprinkler, as in Figure 6. The smart sprinkler is powered by a 12 V, 20 W solar
    panel (Figure 7a). The flat basement with mounting holes helps easily place smart
    sprinklers at required locations. A 0.5-inch pipe connector is used to supply
    water to the sprinkler from the pressure pump through the pipes. A 0.5-inch pipe
    connects the water solenoid output connector and the sprinkler head. This watertight
    rotating tube maintains the free rotation of the sprinkler head using the MG-90
    servomotor with gear mechanism without blockage or cracking. The sprinkler head
    can rotate from 0 to 359 degrees freely. This back-and-forth rotation of the sprinkler
    head helps irrigate in specific directions. The sprinkler head is attached to
    a water blocker controlled by an SG-90 micro servo, determining the irrigation
    distance by controlling the water pressure. A 12 V- 1 A water solenoid is used
    to turn on and off the sprinklers. The smart sprinkler detailed design and construction
    are given in the Figure S3, 4. FIGURE 6. Functional diagram of LoRa based smart
    sprinkler. Show All FIGURE 7. a) Design of LoRa WAN-based smart sprinkler for
    precision irrigation, b) LoRa enabled smart sprinkler circuit. Show All Additionally,
    the 12 V 72 PSI water solenoid helps control water flow through the sprinkler.
    A 12 V solar panel with an electronic charge controller is used to power the entire
    system. The microcontroller ATSAMD21 controls the smart sprinkler based on the
    terrestrial edge computing station commands received through the LoRa WAN module.
    These complete electronic modules are watertight and moisture-proof. The PV array
    height can be adjustable based on solar light, crop height, and shadow effect.
    The PCB design of LoRa enables smart sprinkler is given in the Figure 7b. Calculating
    the relation between the SG-90 servo angle ( ∅ ) and the irrigating distance is
    essential. We have attached a hall effect flow meter with the custom-made water
    flow control valve mechanism to develop an experimental setup (Figure 8a). This
    experimental product is connected with a pressure pump using a 0.5-inch PVC pipe.
    The hydration distance and water flow are controlled through the valve using an
    SG-90 micro servo motor and an Arduino development board (ATMEGA 328P microcontroller)
    (Figure 8b). The smart sprinkler receives the ∅ values from the terrestrial edge
    unit via LoRa WAN and the localized dry spots are irrigated selectively. We also
    developed a BLINK-based graphical interface to control the smart sprinkler parameters
    manually ( θ , ∅ , and solenoidal switching) for calibration purposes (Figure
    8c,d). CAD design of all the parts used in the smart sprinkler design is given
    in the Figure S5-20. FIGURE 8. a) Experimental setup to calculate the relation
    between ∅ and irrigation distance, b) Measuring hydration distance over each servo
    angle ( ∅ ), c) Custom-made smart sprinkler for selective irrigation, d) BLYNK
    based application to calibrate sprinkler control parameters. Show All F. RF Communications
    LoRa WAN is used as the transceiver for drones and smart sprinklers. It is essential
    to point out that, for a large region of farmland, the terrestrial edge station
    must be able to connect with most of the smart sprinklers without needing a secondary
    repeater. During system operation, less than 30 kB of data is transmitted from
    the drone to the terrestrial edge computing station and to the sprinkler. Therefore,
    using LoRa WAN technology for data transmission is feasible because bandwidth
    is not a key concern in the system. For a communication system, optimal range,
    power, and price/performance trade-offs are possible by using LoRa technology.
    The spread spectrum modulation method used by LoRa is unique and was developed
    from chirp spread spectrum (CSS) technology [51], [52]. The LoRa WAN (Long Range
    Wide Area Network) serves primarily as a network layer protocol for controlling
    communication across Low Power Wide Area Network (LP WAN) gateways and edge devices
    as a routing protocol [51]. According to the regulations, LPWAN technologies mainly
    operate in the ISM band from 902 MHz to 928 MHz in the USA and the band from 863
    MHz to 870 MHz in Europe [53], [54]. Using a LoRa gateway, the appropriate edge
    station can transmit information to the LoRa WAN with a bandwidth of 125 kHz.
    Multiple data rate options, ranging from 250 bps to 5470 bps, are supported by
    this technology. A transmission range of up to 10 km helps to make up for this
    extremely low data rate [51]. It’s vital to note that a high-gain antenna and
    an environment lack of physical obstructions are requirements for reaching such
    long distances. A 20% packet loss rate for a distance of around 2 km between nodes
    and the LoRa gateway has been demonstrated in studies employing an SX1278 LoRa
    chip and an ultra-low power STM32L151 microcontroller [55]. For our purpose, we
    chose a RYLR896 LoRa module (Integration of SX1276 LoRa communicator and STM 32
    microcontroller), which has a more extended range and better receiver sensitivity
    (down up to −148 dBm). The LoRa chip uses a peak power of 300 mW when in transmission
    mode and drops to 60 mW when in reception mode. These values decrease to a power
    level close to 0.25 mW in sleep mode. The peak power needed only lasts for a time
    frame of less than 10 ms when operating in the mode with the lowest transmission
    rate [51]. The FSK, GFSK, MSK, GMSK, LoRa, and OOK modulations are supported by
    the SX1276 LoRa modem, which has a configurable bit rate of up to 300 kbps. G.
    Terrestrial Edge Front End The user control GUI (Graphical User Interface) available
    at the terrestrial edge is the terrestrial edge console (Figure 9). Tkinter is
    used to create the unit. Tkinter, sometimes known as ”Tk interface,” is a python
    module that allows access to the Tk GUI toolkit. This toolkit was created in TCL
    (Tool Command Language), and it is multiplatform, supporting Linux, MAC OS, and
    Microsoft Windows. The only framework included in the python standard library
    is Tkinter. The terrestrial edge console collects data from the smart sprinklers
    (Figure S21a) and aerial edge through LoRa WAN communication and external REST
    APIs are utilized to get weather data (Figure S21b). These APIs employ GPS coordinates
    to acquire correct weather for terrestrial edge control station. The sprinklers
    can also be manually controlled by the user for calibration purpose by changing
    the θ and ∅ values of each sprinkler (Figure S21c). The terrestrial edge GUI is
    also used to visualize the irrigation pattern of each smart sprinklers. If there
    are unfavorable weather conditions, the weather data collected can show how well
    the sprinkler system performs. FIGURE 9. Terrestrial edge front end for data representation
    and real time visualization of irrigation pattern. Show All H. Methodology Surveying
    the farm area is the first step to collecting each boundary point coordinates,
    total farm area, and shape. Consider a square-shaped farmland; the four boundary
    coordinates are the primary data needed for further calculations. The total surveillance
    area is divided into hexagonal sectors where the smart sprinklers are placed at
    the center of each sector. A python program is developed in processing, which
    takes the areal map of farmland, boundary conditions (coordinates), diagonal of
    each hexagon, and hexagon separation x and y values to avoid overlapping as the
    input. The farm map is overlaid with a regular hexagon grid based on these data.
    The program also provides the coordinates of the center of each hexagon. Finding
    the exact locations for sprinklers are achieved through this method. The method
    used for implementing hexagonal griding is shown in the algorithm S1. We implemented
    the project on a 40 m x 40 m open grassland. The land is virtually divided into
    a few small segments. A hexagonal sector with a diagonal dimension of 10 m is
    used in this project. TIR images acquired by the drone are processed using the
    onboard edge intelligence module along with the flight data in order to estimate
    the location and dryness of every localized dry spot within each hexagonal sector.
    This data is transferred to the terrestrial edge station through LoRa WAN communication.
    The terrestrial edge station (raspberry pi 4-8GB) collects these data and generates
    a dataset containing the rotation angles ( θ,∅ ) of the water flow control valve
    and the nozzle head. To precisely calculate the irrigation pattern, the ML model
    incorporates environmental parameters such as field soil moisture absorption rate,
    crop type, dry spot area, and weather. 1) Image Stabilization The major problem
    we faced during the reconstruction of the thermal images was the stability of
    the recorded thermal videos. This is mainly affected by the steadiness of the
    drone subject to environmental conditions like wind and weather. Before determining
    the properties of the localized dry spots, it is essential to stabilize the thermal
    videos. A python code written for Open CV took the shaky video. It converted that
    to a stabilized video based on changing the frame transformation parameters from
    one frame to another using optical flow for all frames. The frame transformations
    are a rigid Euclidean transform consisting of three parameters distance ( dx,dy
    ) and angle ( dθ ). The algorithm in python compiles the transformations to obtain
    the ”trajectory” for x,y , and the angle at each frame. New transformation= transformation
    +(smoothed trajectory−trajectory) (1) View Source A sliding average window is
    used to smooth the trajectory. The radius of the window defines the number of
    frames used for smoothing. The new transformation is formatted using equation
    (1) and applied to the entire thermal video. The final output of the stabilized
    thermal video is created by cropping the unwanted edges of all frames. The algorithm
    for stabilizing the drone video is detailed in Section S2. 2) RGB Splitting of
    Thermal Video The color of the localized dry spots varies from dark blue to red
    hue when the dryness increases. The environmental conditions such as weather and
    atmospheric temperature can also affect the quality of captured TIR images [18],
    [56]. Removing unwanted information from the TIR images is an essential preprocessing
    step in the aerial edge unit. Separating a picture into its RGB component channels
    reveals that the R channel contains the bulk of the image’s informational value,
    making it simple for an image processing system to identify the video’s reference
    plane and pinpoint the location of any dry areas. A 40 x 40 cm2 aluminum sheet
    attached to a wooden frame was used as the temperature reference plane. The algorithm
    S3 is used to split the TIR images into R, G, B channels. 3) Localized Dry Spot
    Detection From TIR Images The area of a single dry spot ( A ) is calculated based
    on the TIR image covering a single hexagon. This is calculated according to the
    resolution of the TIR imaging camera and the drone’s altitude. For an altitude
    of 4 m, the dry spot area of 2.5 cm2 equals 1 pixel of the TIR images captured
    using a Lepton 3.5 FLIR camera. Since we are using the same TIR camera for the
    experiment (Lepton 3.5 FLIR), the resolution is constant. This calculation depends
    upon the drone’s altitude at which the image is captured. The OpenCV library transforms
    the thermal image input into a greyscale image. The image is represented as I(x,y)
    , with (x,y) denoting the pixel coordinates. The image height (h) and width (w)
    are calculated to represent the image as a (h x w) pixel metric. The pixel metrics
    is evaluated horizontally { y 0 x 1 , y 0 x 2 ,….., y 0 x (w−1) , y 0 x (w) }
    and the vertical value ranges as { y 0 , y 1 ,….., y (h−1) , y h } . Threshold
    value T is predefined, i.e., determined from trials exhibiting maximum dry spot
    detection DMAX and minimum error EMIN from multiple image evaluations. The pixel
    values I ( x,y ) exceeding the threshold are considered dry spots, hence highlighted
    in the image with greyscale value 0 representing C. The image area is also estimated
    in pixels; in the bulk image process, the image name and area are represented
    in an excel worksheet. The processed images are stored in an output directory
    for further processing. The algorithm S4 is used to find the localized dry spots
    area. The input image is a greyscale image with dry spots represented with RGB
    {0, 0, 0}. There are two predefined values, i.e., alpha and pixel ratio. α represents
    the error or deviation from the expected target dry spot of the water jet. The
    area covered by deviation or error is defined as A ′ . The total area covered
    is A MAX will be higher than the actual area ( A ) Total area covered  A MAX =A+a
    A ′ (2) View Source α value depends on the pressure deviation, nozzle size of
    the sprinkler, wind, and external factors. The sprinkler precision is considered
    as 100% when α=0 . The α value is empirically determined and used to correct the
    sprinkler rotation angles to avoid deviation from the actual area ( A ) that needs
    to be covered. The corrections can be manually set by the terrestrial edge front
    end. Variation of α corresponds to the pixel_ratio , which is a cluster of pixels
    around the dry spot, clubbed together as a single region to be irrigated, referred
    to as sprinkle_area if the pixel ratio value in the area is. sprinkle_area= (pixel_ratio)
    2 (3) View Source The sprinkle_area values can range from 1 to n2, depending on
    pixel_ratio . The value of the sprinkle ratio is significant concerning the sprinkler
    nozzle type or spread rate. The algorithm uses a decision tree classifier to obtain
    the rotation angles, flow rate, pressure, and distance for every dry spot coordinate
    value ( x,y ). Algorithm 1 details the irrigation of localized dry spots. Algorithm

    Hexagonal Sector To visualize the complete image processing process in the aerial
    edge computing system, the GPS coordinates of each localized dry spot location
    is calculated from the TIR image of a hexagonal sector. The algorithm uses the
    RGB split TIR images along with the GPS coordinates of the smart sprinkler as
    input and crops an image to a regular hexagon, placing the sprinkler at the center
    of the hexagon. The corresponding image is converted to.png format to adjust the
    transparency value ( α ). The slope of the hexagonal sides is computed, and all
    the pixels beyond the hexagonal boundaries are set to have a value of 0. The center
    point of each localized dry spot is determined, and the GPS coordinates are calculated
    according to the algorithm given in Section S 5. I. Irrigation Pattern Generation:
    Machine Learning Aided Model for Generating Irrigation Pattern of the Smart Sprinkler
    Target Prediction Based on Machine Learning The pattern of irrigation is generated
    as an array of [ θ n , Φ n ] values, θ and ∅ are sprinkler head rotation angle
    and the pressure valve control servo angles. Various machine learning models were
    used to predict the target variables [ θ n , Φ n ] using the data gathered from
    thermal images and sprinkler experiment data (Figure 10). The ML dataset includes
    the pixel data information, drone parameters, and environmental data. The aerial
    edge computing system generates the pixel data from the processed TIR images,
    including the position of each pixel ( x,y ) and the distance between each pixel
    and the sprinkler ( l ). A training dataset comprised 80% of the dataset, and
    a testing dataset comprised 20% of the dataset. By contrasting anticipated and
    actual values, the accuracy of the ML regression models was examined. By creating
    python scripts that accessed the Orange API, the Orange toolbox was used to execute
    ML studies. Python script widgets are used in Orange to execute python scripts
    to carry out extra functionalities like feature significance. The outputs of the
    python script widget are the updated variables from the python script. FIGURE

    SECTION III. Results A. Hexagonal Grid Mapping The aerial edge computing station
    distinguishes each localized dry spot from the TIR images. Our preliminary experiment
    was to map a survey area and calculate the exact number of sprinklers required
    for the land and its GPS location. We chose an open grassland of 40 m x 40 m dimension
    as our survey area. The four boundary coordinates were obtained from Google Maps.
    The drone waypoints were set to hover over the grassland at about 20 m altitude
    while capturing RGB and TIR images. The sector is divided into smaller hexagonal
    sectors with a 10 m radius and the location of each sprinkler is determined using
    the algorithm S1 (Figure S22,23). The drone hovering pattern is further generated
    from the sprinkler location of the farmland. The location of each smart sprinkler
    is given as a waypoint in the Ardupilot Mission planner software which calculates
    an appropriate drone hovering pattern. B. Video Stabilization Environmental factors
    such as weather and wind can arbitrarily change drone stability, which will also
    affect the stability of the thermal images and video captures. Although gimbal-based
    image stabilization methods are efficient, on the other hand, it is also expensive.
    To mitigate the negative impacts of camera, shake on recorded video and enhance
    the overall quality of the media, we developed a video stabilization program.
    The frame transformation parameters of the TIR video are adjusted relative to
    the Euclidian distance of frame transformation. Figure 11 a represents the fluctuation
    of d x and d y for a shaky video. There was no camera rotation during recording,
    therefore angle deviation ( d a ) is ignored. Figure 11b,c represents the change
    in pixel value for the x and y trajectory for an un-stabilized and stabilized
    video. The new transformation of each frame is calculated from the previous transformation
    by applying the smooth trajectory parameters d x and d x (Figure 11d). FIGURE

    of un-stabilized and stabilized video. c) y trajectory transformation of un-stabilized
    and stabilized video. d) Stabilized frame to frame transformation. Show All C.
    RGB Splitting of TIR Images We discovered that abrupt changes in the environmental
    conditions impact the effectiveness of dry spot recognition when isolating the
    localized dry patches from the TIR videos. This is calculated by comparing the
    TIR images to the contrast value of the reference plane (a 40 cm2 aluminum foil
    attached to a wooden piece used as reference in this case). The low-resolution
    Lepton 3.5 FLIR camera cannot effectively distinguish the reference plane from
    the surrounding wet areas. Splitting each color channel (R, G, B) of TIR images
    effectively determines the relation of the reference plane and dry patch color
    in the TIR images. The blue and green channels cannot distinguish the reference
    plane from the wet areas (Figure S24a,b). In contrast, a dry region is best defined
    in the red channel (Figure S24c). This feature can be utilized to precisely calculate
    the localized dry spots by comparing the temperature of the reference plane on
    the ground. D. Optimum Drone Hovering Altitude to Determine the Localized Dry
    Spots Effectively To find the optimum altitude for a drone hovering in the smart
    irrigation, we conducted experiments using synthetic turf placed inside a single
    hexagonal sector. An artificial turf of 5 m2 is placed at the center of one sector.
    TIR images of the turf is captured using a Lepton 3.5 FLIR camera at different
    altitudes from 4 to 20 m (Figure 12a) while hydrating the turf using a known quantity
    of water (0.5 to 2.5 L) as in Figure 12b. The area of each wet patch is mapped
    into pixels through the blob detection method. The TIR images are used to estimate
    the influence of image resolution of the Lepton 3.5 FLIR camera at various altitudes.
    The pixel representation of wet patches for each hydration level at different
    altitudes are calculated. The relation between the wet patch area and hydration
    level at different altitudes (Figure 13a), TIR image representation of the wet
    patch for each altitude at different hydration levels (Figure 13b). This data
    is used to map the relationship between the dry spot area, moisture level, and
    the TIR image capturing altitude for a Lepton 3.5 FLIR camera. FIGURE 12. a) TIR
    images captured using Lepton 3.5 FLIR camera at 12 m altitude for different hydration
    levels, b) TIR images captured using Lepton 3.5 FLIR camera for a hydration level
    of 2.5 L at different altitudes. Show All FIGURE 13. a) TIR image representation
    of wet patch area for different hydration levels corresponds to each altitude
    for a Lepton 3.5 FLIR camera, b) TIR image representation of wet patch area for
    each altitude at different hydration levels for a Lepton 3.5 FLIR camera. Show
    All We created two adjacent wet patches of 1 ft radius separated 1 ft apart by
    hydrating the turf with a known quantity of water. This is to determine the resolution
    of the corresponding FLIR camera and the optimum altitude to capture the TIR images.
    Each wet patch is hydrated with 1.5 L and 2.5 L of water, and the TIR images are
    captured at different altitudes (4 m- 20 m) as in Figure 14a. We find that the
    FLIR camera can clearly distinguish each wet patch up to an altitude of 12 m (Figure
    14b,c). A larger coverage area was achieved at higher altitudes of the drone hovering,
    giving a shorter period to cover the farmland. We further used image processing
    to accomplish pixel mapping of the corresponding wet patches (Figure 14d). At
    a height of 12 meters, the FLIR camera could capture approximately 40 x 30 m2
    in a single image. Therefore, the hexagonal diagonal dimension can be increased
    to 15 meters, thereby reducing the initial hovering time and cost. FIGURE 14.

    learning model is developed to determine the sprinkler flow rate corresponding
    to each pixel distance from the center of each segment. At the optimum altitude
    for drone hovering (12 m), the total area of a single pixel is about 7.5 cm2.
    Depending on the location of the dry zone pixels, the ML model generates an accurate
    servo angle for nozzle head rotation ( θ ) and flow rate control ( ∅ ) along with
    the working duration of water solenoid to precisely irrigate each pixel in the
    TIR image. E. LoRa Communication The SX1276 LoRa module is used to transmit data
    from the aerial edge to the terrestrial edge and from the terrestrial edge to
    the smart sprinklers. The SX1276 LoRa module is set as a transmitter or receiver
    based on the purpose. The spreading factor (SF) and the bandwidth (BW) determine
    LoRa communication’s efficiency and the maximum transmission distance, which is
    governed by the RSSI and SNR parameters. We studied the influence of these parameters
    on the SX1276 LoRa module by changing the spreading factor from 7- 12 for each
    bandwidth value of 125 kHz and 250 kHz. The experiment was conducted with three
    LoRa modules, one of which transmitted data to the other two. One of the LoRa
    modules is equipped with a 2.1 dBi helical antenna, and the other with an 8d Bi
    fiberglass antenna. The receivers are taken to different parts of our campus to
    measure the RSSI and SNR values. While experimenting, we achieved the highest
    transmission distance of 778 m for the LoRa module with the 8d Bi fiberglass antenna
    and 503 m for the LoRa with a 2.1 dBi helical antenna. RSSI and SNR values for
    every distance are recorded for 125 kHz and 250 kHz bandwidth (Figure S25-28)
    in order to figure out the optimum LoRa configuration. We see that larger SF values
    and smaller BW values result in a greater transmission distance. Figure 15a,b
    indicates the RSSI and SNR values for each transmission distance for the configuration
    of SF 12 with 125 kHz and 250 kHz bandwidth. The highest transmission distance
    is achieved with minimum package loss when the LoRa is configured with a SF of
    12 and a BW of 125 kHz which is used in this system. A LoRa configuration with
    a bandwidth of less than 125 kHz can increase transmission distance, but at the
    expense of an increase in transmission delay. FIGURE 15. a) RSSI values of LoRa
    module for each transmission distance using a 8.1 dBm fiberglass antenna, b) SNR
    values of LoRa module for each transmission distance using a 8.1 dBm fiberglass
    antenna. Show All F. Georeferencing of Localized Dry Spots The smart sprinkler
    is located at the center of the hexagonal sector, and its GPS coordinates can
    be read out from the Pixhawk using UART communication. The drone’s hovering altitude
    is fixed so that one side of the TIR image is the same as the diagonal of the
    hexagon’s adjacent sides. The TIR images are divided into hexagonal-shaped sectors
    and each localized dry spot is georeferenced based on the GPS coordinates and
    altitude of flight (Figure 16). A dataset is generated with the pixel data information
    of each dry spot. The ML model uses this dataset to calculate the irrigation pattern
    by generating the smart sprinkler control parameters ( θ,∅ ). FIGURE 16. Localized
    wet and dry spots area and location calculation through python programming from
    the red and blue channels respectively. Show All The machine learning model is
    trained with a dataset that relates water flow rate and the irrigating distance.
    The water flow rate is determined by rotating a ball valve using an SG-90 micro
    servo motor controlled by the ATSAMD21 microcontroller (Figure 17a, b). We experimentally
    determined the servo angle’s irrigation distance and flow rate. The ball valve
    and servo motor are attached so that the 0° angle closes the valve and 90° opens
    the valve completely. The flow rate vs irrigating distance of the smart pump in
    a 10° interval is shown in Figure 17a, b. FIGURE 17. a) Relationship between servo
    angle and a) irrigation distance and b) flow rate of the Smart sprinkler. Show
    All G. Deviation in Irrigation Pattern For Localized Dry Spots Even if the image
    processing algorithm calculates the localized dry spots exactly, the smart sprinkler
    may not irrigate the targeted region precisely based on the irrigation pattern
    generated by the machine learning model. This may be the result of a number of
    external or internal factors that influence the precision of the irrigation pattern.
    External factors such as wind or internal issues such as the inconsistency of
    the sprinkler nozzle can lead to this inaccuracy. From our studies, a single pixel
    of a TIR image captured by a Lepton 3.5 FLIR camera from an altitude of 4 m represents
    2.5 cm2 (Figure 18a). The smart sprinkler is designed to irrigate based on the
    temperature of each pixel, which means the irrigation pattern is directly related
    to each pixel mapping. For a smart sprinkler to precisely irrigate a dry spot
    of 2.5 cm2 the nozzle diameter of the sprinkler should be so small that it is
    challenging to construct because of the pressure generated inside the sprinkler
    when the water solenoid turns on. We have introduced a sprinkler error constant
    (α) to represent the deviation in the irrigated area from the irrigated pattern.
    The α value varies from 0 to 1. An increase in the α value increases the hydration
    area (Figure 18b-d), which reduces the system efficiency. The value of α should
    be zero for a perfect smart irrigation system. Figure 18e represents the relation
    between the α value and the area deviation. The figure shows that the relation
    between α and deviation area is linear for TIR images captured up to an altitude
    of 12 m using a Lepton 3.5 FLIR camera. This will help to improve the system efficiency
    by including the change in α value parameter in the ML dataset, which will not
    be applicable for images captured above 12 m altitude. However, the difference
    in area calculated using pictures taken at higher altitudes (>12m) showed erroneous
    results. This is due to the resolution limit of the TIR camera used. Hence, we
    maintained the image capturing altitude of 12 m for all our experiments in this
    study. FIGURE 18. a) TIR images of localized dry spots captured using a Lepton
    3.5 FLIR camera at 4 m altitude, b) Smart sprinkler irrigation model for error
    value ( α)=0 , c) Smart sprinkler irrigation model for α=0.5 , d) Smart sprinkler
    irrigation model for α=1 , e) Irrigation area deviation with varying α values
    at different capture heights. Show All H. Machine Learning Aided Model for Generating
    Irrigation Pattern of the Smart Sprinkler 1) Prediction Efficiency of the Decision-Making
    Model At the terrestrial edge, a machine learning model will generate the SCP
    based on the TIR image data and the input dataset (Figure S29). The performance
    of the ML models was evaluated using the four key parameters: Mean Square Error
    (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared
    (R2). The MAE evaluates the average size of errors over a set of predictions without
    considering their direction. It evaluates the accuracy of continuous variables.
    MSE’s penalty is proportional to the square of the error rather than the actual
    error. A smooth gradient for minor errors is created when the error is squared,
    which gives the outliers more weight. An effective model should have MSE values
    that are almost zero. The square root of MSE is used to calculate RMSE. The range
    of MAE, MSE, and RMSE is from 0 to ∞ . R-squared is also estimated to show how
    well a regression model fits the data. The best R-squared value is 1. The four
    machine learning models: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM),
    Random Forest (RF), and Neural Network, are tested for performance based on the
    MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R2. The RF model, which we evaluated, had the highest accuracy
    in predicting the θ and ∅ , with an MSE value of 0.063 (Figure S30). The KNN shows
    the second-highest accuracy with an MSE value of 0.149. SVM had the lowest accuracy
    with an MSE value of 86.581. The highest effective model (Random Forest) was introduced
    into the terrestrial edge unit for the prediction of SCP (Figure S31). 2) Estimating
    Feature Importance For Maximum Relevance and Minimal Redundancy A selection of
    predictors with a high prevalence is identified. Unnecessary predictors reduce
    model performance and raise computing costs. Some of the predictors among them
    have a considerable impact on how the model responds. The significance of each
    feature was examined by varying the predictors and calculating the accuracy drop.
    We wanted to identify the predictor combination relevant to the response, including
    predictors produced from TIR image processing and meteorological data output.
    The performance of a model is reduced by unnecessary features, which also raises
    the cost of computation. It’s crucial to identify a subgroup of features with
    a high prevalence. Some factors have a greater influence on the response model
    than others. Using the RReliefF algorithm and the k-nearest neighbor approach,
    we prioritized the significance of features or predictors. RReliefF is a continuous
    target function that rewards features that provide different values to neighbors
    with different response values while penalizing features that provide different
    values to neighbors with the same response values. To choose only the variables
    that maximize the information gain, we analyzed the RReliefF for each variable.
    Figure 19 displays the RReliefF-implemented features relevance rating. The features
    are marked as CL, L = [1], [2], [3], [4], where C1 is the distance between each
    pixel to the sprinkler, C2and C3 are pixel x,y coordinates values and C4 is the
    angle between pixels and the sprinkler reference axis. C1 was discovered to be
    the most crucial characteristic among the CL predictors with a weight of 0.595,
    where C2, C3, and C4 shows almost equal importance with RReliefF value of 0.388,
    0.390, and 0.373. While comparing features, the RReliefF score serves as a baseline;
    certain features can be eliminated depending on feature importance values. FIGURE
    19. Identifying a subset having high prevalence features with ranking the significance
    of the predictors using the RReliefF method. Show All SECTION IV. Conclusion We
    have developed a drone aided thermal mapping system to control the smart irrigation
    system to irrigate crops with an optimum quantity of water for precision agriculture.
    The aerial edge computing station captures the TIR images and determines the localized
    dry spot when the drone hovers over each hexagonal sector. The dry spot information
    is transferred to the terrestrial edge control station through LoRa WAN communication.
    The LoRa WAN-based smart sprinkler operates in accordance with the terrestrial
    edge computing station’s determination of the dry spot based on the ML-produced
    irrigation pattern. This smart irrigation system can precisely hydrate all the
    crops in the implemented region based on the reference hydration level, soil moisture
    absorption, and weather condition. This system applies to any crops in and geological
    location. And the system is scalable regardless of the size, geological background
    of the agricultural land, and variety of crops cultivated. Authors Figures References

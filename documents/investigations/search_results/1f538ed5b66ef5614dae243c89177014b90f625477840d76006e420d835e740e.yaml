    of Things (IoT) is a new fast communication technology designed to continuously
    make communication among different types of devices. The researchers have exerted
    huge efforts to employ IoT to facilitate daily life. These include IoT big issues
    like securing information exchange, smart agriculture systems, and general-purpose
    internet access. This paper shows research efforts to enable IoT-based smart agriculture.
    It starts with the underlying architecture, then discusses some of the recent
    IoT trials. It classifies the literature by deriving a taxonomy based on technologies,
    communication cofactors, network types, local area wireless criteria, targets,
    and characteristics. Moreover, it highlights the unprecedented chances brought
    about by IoT-based smart architectures and their impact on human life. So IoT
    will solve these problems by connecting soil moisture sensors, giving us a quick
    response to avoid crop losses through careful monitoring and remote control of
    the fields. Moreover, IoT facilitates and solves most agriculture-related problems,
    through the use of modern technologies in monitoring plant biomarkers and controlling
    watering processes to increase production and efficiency. This gives us a visualization
    of the state of the field and enables us to take the necessary measures before
    the problem occurs as a way of problem anticipation. Keywords internet of things

    Keywords SensorsSensor and Actuator NetworkAgricultureFramework 1. Introduction
    Agriculture has played a key role in the development of human civilization. Due
    to the increased demand of food, people are trying to put extra efforts and special
    techniques to multiply the food production. Use of different technologies towards
    agriculture is one of such efforts. Apart from use of scientific technologies
    in agriculture, information technology is now being heavily exercised in this
    area. Technologies like satellite navigation, sensor network, grid computing,
    ubiquitous computing and the context-aware computing are supporting the said domain
    for improved monitoring and decision making capabilities [1]. Use of sensors and
    their networks is supporting agriculture practices in a very positive direction
    [2], [3]. For sensor based agriculture, varieties of terminologies are now in
    use like Precision Agriculture (PA), Smart Agriculture, Variable Rate Technology
    (VRT), Precision Farming, Global Positioning System (GPS) Agriculture, Farming
    by Inch, Information-Intensive Agriculture, Site Specific Crop Management etc.
    [4] but the underlying concept in all of them is same. Advancements of technologies
    reduced the size of sensors to such extent that enabled them to be utilized in
    variety of the domains of human life. Due to the significance of sensor technology,
    several issues related to sensors and their networks are in research. Energy constraint,
    limited computing power, small memory and data security are some of the substantial
    issues of sensor networks for which researchers proposed several solutions [5],
    [6], [7]. The aim of this paper is to review the need of wireless sensors in different
    aspects of agriculture. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In
    next section, we will present the importance of sensors in agriculture. In Section
    3, sensor technology and their networks will be introduced. Wireless sensor and
    actuator networks application in agriculture will be discussed in Section 4. Section
    5 will discuss the available system framework proposed for agriculture domain
    followed by conclusions in the last section. 2. Why sensors in agriculture? Sensors
    are used for collecting information about physical and environmental attributes
    whereas actuators are employed to react on the feedback to have control over the
    situations. The sensors'' accumulated information that characterizes the object
    or environment and used to identify people, location, objects and their states
    is known as context [8], [9]. The context acquisition provides a valuable contribution
    in modeling situations of domains that have variety of time variant attributes.
    Agriculture is one such domain. Agriculture domain poses several requirements
    that are following: 1- Collection of weather, crop and soil information 2- Monitoring
    of distributed land 3- Multiple crops on single piece of land 4- Different fertilizer
    and water requirement to different pieces of uneven land 5- Diverse requirements
    of crops for different weather and soil conditions 6- Proactive solutions rather
    than reactive solutions. Above requirements entail parallel and distributed application
    and processing. In addition, wireless sensors and actuators are required to collect
    the requisite information and to react on different situations. Decision support
    imposes the requirement to have processed information rather than raw sensor data.
    To cope-up with such requirements, wireless sensors, actuators and their networks
    present themselves as a strong candidate for development of system for context
    acquisition, presenting acquired data to remote decision support systems and thus
    providing a controlled environment based on decision. Several sensors that are
    used for agricultural related attributes'' acquisition are presented in Table

    is becoming possible in almost every field of life due to the advancement of technology
    and size reduction. Sensor is a device that has capabilities to measure physical
    attributes and convert them into signals for the observer. Sensors are the part
    of nature and many of the sensing capabilities are available in living organism
    in the form of bio-sensors. Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) comprises over several
    components called ‘nodes’ (refer to Fig. 1). The nodes are smart devices that
    are used to collect the application oriented data requirements. A sensor network
    performs three basic functions: (i) Sensing (ii) Communication and (iii) Computation
    by using hardware, software and algorithm. The nodes perform several roles. The
    distributed nodes that collect the information are called source node while the
    node that gathers the information from all source node is called the sink node
    and sometime the gateway node. The sink node could have relatively high computing
    power. A source node also works as a routing node due to the requirement of multi
    hop routing. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Wireless Sensor Network
    (WSN). Wireless Sensor and Actuator Network (WSAN) is a variant of WSN that has
    one additional type of component that is an actuator. Inclusion of actuator increases
    the capability of WSN from monitoring to the control. 3.1. Communication technologies
    Wireless communication technologies like ZigBee, Bluetooth, Wibree and WiFi are
    part of several sensor network based research works. These technologies have different
    capabilities and properties on which they are complemented. A brief comparison
    is given in Table 2. Table 2. Comparison of communication technologies [10]. Empty

    128 bit ZigBee wireless communication technology (IEEE 802.15.4) is preferred
    over other technologies for the development of wireless sensor network due to
    its low cost and low power consumption property. It was introduced in May 2003
    and operates on Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) band i.e. 2.4 GHz globally.
    There are 16 ZigBee channels of 5 MHz bandwidth each in 2.4 GHz band. 3.2. Wireless
    sensor node architecture Wireless sensor node is a basic unit of wireless sensor
    network. It comprises of 4 basic modules including Sensor/Actuator module, Communication
    module, Processing/computation module and Power module (refer to Fig. 2). External
    memory is an optional module that could be needed in case of data storage requirement
    for local decision making. Its design requires many considerations like energy
    conservation, scalability, size, housing etc. Download : Download full-size image

    is carried out considering the major requirements of application domain, problem
    and distribution pattern. The processor/microcontroller, memory, working frequency
    band, available compatible sensors, transmission range and size are some of the
    major attributes of a sensor node that make it preferable over others. Table 3
    depicts that majority of sensor nodes comprise over ATmega128L microcontroller,
    ZigBee (CC2420) or RF (CC1000) transceivers working on ISM band and weather related
    embedded sensors. It is due to the microcontroller specialized attributes, licensing
    free ISM band and close relationship of weather attributes to majority of domain
    problems. Microcontroller plays a vital role as it provides computing power for
    local decision making and data aggregation, energy management through sleep/awake
    modes etc. ATmega128L is the most common microcontroller due to its low power
    requirement, several sleeping modes, flash memory, efficient byte oriented storage
    and compatibility with virtually all TinyOS code. Agriculture domain engenders
    some specialized requirements that are presented in the next section. Due to such
    special requirements, sensor nodes are also especially designed keeping the ruggedness,
    housing, alternative battery source support etc. e.g. Lofar node and SPWAS [11],
    [12], [13]. 3.3. Issues in wireless sensor networks Based on flexible and autonomous
    concept of wireless sensor networks, opportunities have been created for exciting
    application areas requiring remote sensing and actuation for optimized results.
    However, wireless sensor network technology poses many issues that need to be
    handled for long term viability of developed systems. Issues like energy consumption
    for autonomous operation of sensor nodes, dictate design and development issues
    including communication, protocols and deployment. Issues in wireless sensor networks
    have been outlined in existing literature [7], [14] and been addressed by others
    [15], [16] for different solutions to the issues. However, in the context of our
    survey we describe issues that are critical for application of WSN in agriculture
    domain. In many cases, farming is carried out on farms as large as several hundreds
    of acres and may involve different nature of land, resources and microclimates.
    The sensor nodes being placed in open, uncontrolled environment pose several design
    and implementation issues, some key of them as below: 3.3.1. Energy consumption
    Each sensor node placed in a wireless sensor networks has the responsibility of
    event detection, data processing and transmission. In case of multi-hop network,
    a node has the additional responsibility of data routing also. Each of the above
    actions requires energy to be consumed. A node is usually equipped with a limited
    and finite energy source e.g. alkaline batteries or lithium cells. Therefore,
    a sensor node life time greatly depends upon battery life time. By applying proper
    energy management strategy in hardware and software, battery life may be extended
    to several more months. Alternatively, the use of renewable energy sources such
    as solar power or kinetic energy could be adopted where a slight expensive solution
    could be traded off in favor of longer life of sensor nodes. Moreover, in case
    of agriculture lands, these sensors could be periodically repowered by battery
    change as their placement and access is usually well-defined. 3.3.2. Data acquisition,
    sampling and transmission With each data sampled, processed and transmitted, energy
    is spent. An efficient and optimized data collection and sample rate is needed
    to be programmed so as not only the relevant and useful data is captured but energy
    is also not wastefully spent. On the contrary, frequent data acquisition will
    cause huge amount of packets being transmitted and this exhausts the energy of
    the batteries quickly. In agriculture, the sampling rate for data acquisition
    is not usually high. However, it could be made adjustable based upon the environment,
    type of crop and resources. As mentioned in Section 3.1, various wireless transmission
    technologies are available for use. A data transmission strategy could also be
    strategized so that lesser transmissions are made, thus conserving the energy.
    This may include local storage of data at sensor nodes and intelligent transmission
    of data e.g. the aggregated values or only the changed ones etc. Moreover, the
    implementation of options like sleep mode may be exercised so as to wake up the
    transmitters only when needed. Also in order to have reliable communication links,
    sensor nodes must be placed close enough to each other to ensure reliable multi-hop
    communication. 3.3.3. Fault tolerance Sensor nodes being placed in open harsh
    environment are prone to physical damage, blockage and interference. In order
    to maintain the reliability of a WSN, the failure of a sensor node should not
    affect the overall task of the network. Redundant use of sensor nodes, reorganization
    of sensor network, and overlapped sensing regions etc. are few of the techniques
    employed to increase the fault tolerance or reliability of the network. 3.3.4.
    Sensor node size and housing The sensor node size must be small and suitable for
    deployment. The node should be encased in a protective housing making it resistant
    to harsh environmental factors like heat and rain, and physical mishandling by
    human or animals. 3.3.5. Sensor placement Senor Node Placement is an important
    issue regarding the design of the network, algorithms, topologies used, and the
    parameters being sensed. It needs to be carefully designed and smartly implemented
    so that a WSN could be established that may work reliably and autonomously. Placement
    of sensors should be such that the whole area under the concern is covered and
    sensors are placed in position and altitudes so as to measure the parameters without
    hindrance. For example, light sensors must be placed at heights so as to avoid
    blockage from plant leaves. Water level and moisture sensors, on the other hand,
    must be placed close enough to the ground necessary for accurate measurements.
    Strong winds and water currents may dislocate the sensors from desired positions,
    so proper fixtures need to be mounted to support the nodes. 4. WSN and WSAN applications
    in agriculture Utilization of sensors, actuators and their network in the field
    of agriculture is now in advanced stages. WSN and WSAN are in use with different
    technologies especially with context-aware computing and grid computing [17],
    [18]. Agricultural services like irrigation, fertilization, pesticide spraying,
    animal and pastures monitoring are reviewed in this section. Horticulture is also
    taken into consideration due to its importance. 4.1. Irrigation Irrigation is
    defined as the artificial application of water in agricultural land and it is
    considered as one of the most important constituents of agriculture. Scarcity
    of water in several areas instigates the need of proper use of water that is water
    should be provided to only those places where it is needed and in required quantity.
    Different methods of irrigation are in use like drip irrigation, sprinkler irrigation
    etc. to cope up with the water wastage problem in traditional methods like flood
    irrigation, furrow irrigation etc. Damas et al. [19] developed and tested a remote
    controlled, automatic irrigation system for irrigated area in Spain. The area
    was divided into seven sub-regions. Each sub-region was monitored and contended
    by a control sector. The seven control sectors were connected with each other
    and with the central controller via WLAN network. The results showed significant
    water conservation i.e. up to 30–60%. Evans and Bergman [20] worked on precision
    irrigation control of self-propelled, linear-move and center-pivot irrigation
    systems. Wireless sensors were used in the system to assist irrigation scheduling
    using remotely sensed data and weather data. Morais et al. [21] implemented wireless
    data acquisition network to collect climate data with soil moisture for smart
    irrigation in Portugal. In order to improve irrigation efficiency, several SPWAS
    (Solar Powered Wireless data-Acquisition Stations) have been deployed for the
    measurement of soil moisture. Various techniques have been used for soil moisture
    sensing. Keeping the importance of controlling irrigation water for better yield
    production, several sensor based projects have been developed. Tapankumar et al.
    [22] designed and developed a computer based drip irrigation control system having
    the facility of remote data acquisition. They also presented the benefits of storing
    sensor data for statistical analysis to find out the irrigation requirements of
    different crops. Yunseop Kim et al. [23] developed sensor based irrigation system.
    Soil moisture and temperature, weather information and sprinkler position were
    monitored remotely using the Bluetooth and GPS technologies. The concept behind
    the development of project was to maximize productivity while saving water. Kim
    and Evans [24] developed a real-time wireless in-field sensing and control software
    for site-specific sprinkler irrigation. They integrated a site-specific irrigation
    controller with infield data feedback and supported the decision making and real-time
    monitoring of irrigation operations via Bluetooth wireless radio communication.
    4.2. Fertilization Fertilizers are used to increase the soil fertility that directly
    affects plant growth and quality of food. Several ways of fertilization are used
    like broadcasting, manual spreading and spraying. The optimal supply of fertilizer
    to the required place is a difficult task and it requires sensing capabilities.
    Researchers have presented different solutions for appropriate fertilization.
    Cugati et al. [25] built an automated fertilizer applicator consisting on Input,
    decision support and output modules using GPS technology, real-time sensors and
    Bluetooth technology. The input module is used to provide GPS and sensor data
    values to Decision Support System (DSS) that calculates the optimal quantity and
    spread pattern of fertilizer based on real-time sensor data acquisition through
    Bluetooth communication modules. The DSS calculations were used to regulate fertilizer
    application rate. D. Ehlert et al. [26] used their own designed mechanical sensor
    (Pendulum meter) for site specific fertilization. Pendulum meter was mounted at
    the front of tractor that was used to measure the crop density. The sensor was
    utilized in combination with a fertilizer spreader, a modified CAN-bus onboard
    computer and job calculator to estimate the application of nitrogen within the
    field. J. He et al. [27] developed and integrated optimal fertilization decision
    support system using wireless sensors LAN using IEEE 802.11 protocol (WiFi) and
    GPS analysis server. Sensors were used to acquire real time data of soil moisture,
    conductivity, temperature, PH value, air temperature, humidity, CO2 concentration,
    illumination etc. The system was designed using B/S (browser/Server) structure
    mode to provide high interactivity. GIS analysis server was used to interpolate
    the data from small experiment plots for larger plots to exploit data reduction
    for energy conservation. They utilized “3414” test [28] in their fertilization
    decision making system that refers to the fertilization experiments including
    3 factors (i.e. nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium), 4 levels and 14 treatments
    of fertilizers. “3414” fertilizer efficiency test is predominately used in fertilization
    decision-making systems. It is a statistical model about fertilization and crop
    yield. Through this model crop''s optimal yields in theory and the corresponding
    fertilization amounts can be calculated [29]. The scheme is designed to absorb
    the advantages of optimal regression design of less treatments and high efficiency.
    3414 test utilizes four levels of fertilizer that are 0, 1, 2 and 3. Level 0 means
    level of no fertilizer while 2 is the best fertilizer level for the local approximation.
    Level 2 is known as standard level. Other levels are defined as follows: Different
    fertilization schemes (based on different NPK fertilization rate) on 14 treatment
    places of test field are applied which are then used to find optimal fertilization
    application rate and its relationship with the crop yield. 4.3. Pest control Agricultural
    pest management strategies and product quest have long been dominated for better
    ''pests’ control. Major emphasis remained on the development of new and effective
    product to replace toxic and non-effective old product rather on application strategies.
    Pest control could be more sustainable when the farming practices become more
    compatible with ecological systems. Sensor networks have also been used to overcome
    fungus and pest problems. Aline Baggio [11] developed a project to deal with the
    potato crop Phytophtora disease. Sensors were used to sense humidity and temperature.
    Monitoring of these two facts helped them to reduce the disease. Plant disease
    often occurs in patches of crop that requires variable rate fungicides rather
    uniform application over the whole field. K.H. Dammer [30] proposed the use of
    CROP-meter controlled variable rate field sprayer. Using CROP-meter (real-time
    sensor to measure crop biomass density) information about the spatial distribution
    of plant leaf area to be sprayed by pesticides could be obtained. The sensor information
    is used by their developed algorithm to control the dosage of fungicides to be
    sprayed by the field sprayer. 4.4. Animal and pastures monitoring Butler et al.
    [31] developed a moving virtual fence algorithm to control cow herd. A smart collar
    consisting of GPS receiver, PDA, WiFi flash card for WLAN and audio amplifier
    with speaker is used for each cow in the herd. Animal''s location is verified
    using GPS relative to the virtual fence. In case of approaching virtual fence,
    a sound stimuli is generated to take away animal from the fence perimeter. Cattle
    monitoring at large scale engender several requirements and challenges. M. Radenkovic
    and B. Wietrzyk [32] presented a peer to peer distributed architecture based on
    mobile ad-hoc wireless sensor network for nationwide cattle monitoring. The core
    of their research is to propose novel data storage and routing based on Distributed
    Hash Tables (DHT) that reduces the major problem of disconnections among nodes.
    Cattle''s farming is closely related to the agriculture domain. Green pastures
    are used by cattle for grazing. Tim Wark and his other team members [33] at CSIRO
    ICT center, Australia created a pervasive, self configurable sensor based solution
    to analyze the behavior of animals and their control as well as the pastures assessment.
    Grass growth was analyzed through photographic sensors so that animals can be
    moved towards green pastures. Their major focus of work was to design rugged hardware
    that could be used outdoor for modeling animal''s individual and herd behavior.
    They used specially designed sensor to monitor animal behavior like sleeping,
    grazing, ruminating etc. In their opinion such kind of behavior analysis in combination
    with their movement behavior could be used for Cow–Calf relationship as well as
    trends in herd behavior. Cattle monitoring is an important task but it poses several
    challenges like radio attenuation caused by animal body, mobility etc. Ivon Andonovic
    et al. [34] designed an improved low cost and low power collar having solar power
    relay router and two antennas placed at carefully selected location that optimizes
    the collar radio coverage. They also proposed Implicit Routing Protocol (IRP)
    to cope up with high number of packet loss due to animal mobility. 4.5. Horticulture
    Horticulture deals with the cultivation, production, distribution and use of flowers,
    fruits, greenhouse, ornamentals etc. It is also known as small scale or low intensity
    farming. Greenhouse and viticulture are discussed under this section due to major
    concern of research community towards those areas. Zhang et al. [35] utilized
    sensor network to monitor air temperature, humidity, ambient light, soil moisture
    and temperature that helped them in analyzing the current state of plant nursery.
    Such network may also help in finding the plant diseases. In [17], the authors
    presented system''s water conservation over traditional irrigation methods. They
    developed context-aware irrigation control system using TelosB sensor motes and
    Ech2o soil moisture sensors. The system was tested for University green area irrigation.
    Field testing showed the 30–50% water conservation. Development of reduced cost
    irrigation control system by developing sensor/actuator node and WSAN protocol
    indigenously is presented in [36]. University garden area irrigation was controlled
    using 5 sensor nodes having light, humidity and soil moisture sensors. The node
    was designed using Atmel ATMega64L AVR microcontroller due to its support of 6
    sleep modes (Idle, ADC Noise Reduction, Power-save, Power-down, Standby, and Extended
    Standby) and XBee/X-Bee-Pro OEM RF module for its low power consumption features.
    Preference was given to the power consumption and the low cost properties in design
    rather to the size of sensor mote. 4.5.1. Greenhouse The environment monitoring
    and control of greenhouses is crucial as it is not dependent on natural agents.
    Morais et al. [12] implemented a wireless data acquisition network using several
    Solar-Powered wireless data Acquisition Stations (SPWAS) to collect outdoor and
    indoor climate data for greenhouses in Portugal. Up to 32 SPWASs and a base station
    were used and connected using RF links. The climate data was collected successfully
    and without errors. Mizunuma et al. [37] deployed a Wireless LAN in farm field
    and greenhouse of Japan to monitor plant growth and implemented remote control
    for the production system to get improved productivity and reduce labor requirement.
    Gang [38] developed a hardware and software of greenhouse data acquisition system
    based on Bluetooth technology. The temperature and relative humidity were measured.
    Wang et al. [39] developed wireless sensor node to acquire temperature, relative
    humidity and light parameters of a greenhouse. Kolokotsa et al. [40] developed
    an intelligent environment and energy management system for greenhouses. The greenhouse''s
    indoor luminance, temperature, relative humidity, CO2 concentration and the outside
    temperature were monitored. Two fuzzy logic controllers were developed, consisting
    of fuzzy P (Proportional) and PD (Proportional–Derivative) control using desired
    indoor climatic set-points. Output actuations of heating units, motor-controlled
    windows, motor-controlled shading curtains, artificial lighting, CO2 enrichment
    bottles and water fogging valves were controlled. 4.5.2. Viticulture Burrell et
    al. [41] presented a study about the potential use of sensor networks to aid work
    in vineyards. They described a variety of sensor network configurations and applications
    that can address different priorities in the vineyard. Beckwith et al. [42] implemented
    a 65 nodes multi-hop WSN in a vineyard for 6 months. The collected information
    was used for addressing two important parameters in wine production: heat summation
    and potential frost damage. Morais et al. [13] have shown the feasibility of a
    ZigBee based remote sensing network named as MPWiNodeZ, intended for precision
    viticulture. The network nodes were powered by batteries that are recharged with
    energy harvested from the environment from up to 3 sources (solar power, wind
    power and hydro power). 5. System frameworks for agriculture Framework that could
    help in developing complete system from context acquisition to the modeling and
    from decision support system to the actuation is deficient in agriculture domain.
    Context-aware sensor grid framework is one of such frameworks [17], [43] that
    comprises over three layers namely sensor network layer, grid computing layer
    and context-aware application layer. Authors presented the need of several different
    building blocks for each layer that could help in better interactivity from sensor
    based data acquisition to the context-aware application for on time decisions.
    C. Goumopoulos et al. [18], [44] presented the concept of mixed societies of communicating
    plants and artifacts. Their PLANTS ontology comprises over two major concepts
    (ePlants and eGadgets). Utilizing PLANTS ontology, authors developed system architecture
    for precision agriculture application. In their opinion, local decision making
    at each node will make the system scalable and proactive. There is no standard
    body that is providing standard methodology for developing sensor based agricultural
    systems from data acquisition to the modeling and decision making. Several research
    groups are working independently and developing such systems using standard technologies
    under the Precision Agriculture terminology. The Food and Agriculture Organization
    of the United Nations (http://www.fao.org) is performing one of standardization
    efforts by working towards the development of multilingual Agriculture Vocabulary
    (AGROVOC) to support the development of context modeling through ontology. In
    this regard they have also presented the concept of Agricultural Ontology Service/Concept
    Server (AOS/CS) [45] to standardize agricultural vocabulary and providing rich
    and semantically sound terminology. 6. Conclusion Agriculture is a context rich
    domain in which the potential of using WSN and WSAN is very high. A review of
    several solutions and efforts has been presented in this paper towards agriculture
    domain. The major concerns that we feel are: • Solutions are too complex to implement
    and requires major technical support • Intense Cost is involved • Lack of generalized
    solution to different services and problems • Majority of the research works present
    solution in parts like only context modeling, data acquisition, data processing
    and storage techniques or network related problem solutions. The complex or sometimes
    unavailable interlinks among part solutions reduces the impact of several researches.
    Adaptation of WSAN based solutions on large scale requires the following: • Development
    of low cost and rugged sensor/actuator nodes • Generalized solutions to different
    problems • Complete frameworks to develop systems from acquisition to the modeling
    and the decision support. • Solutions in part should be supported with comprehensive
    details of other compatible procedures that could make the intended resolution
    complete. Acknowledgement This work is in part sponsored by Higher Education Commission

    \ 3 August 2017\nAbstract: Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can be used in agriculture\
    \ to provide farmers with a\nlarge amount of information. Precision agriculture\
    \ (PA) is a management strategy that employs\ninformation technology to improve\
    \ quality and production. Utilizing wireless sensor technologies\nand management\
    \ tools can lead to a highly effective, green agriculture. Based on PA management,\n\
    the same routine to a crop regardless of site environments can be avoided. From\
    \ several perspectives,\nﬁeld management can improve PA, including the provision\
    \ of adequate nutrients for crops and the\nwastage of pesticides for the effective\
    \ control of weeds, pests, and diseases. This review outlines the\nrecent applications\
    \ of WSNs in agriculture research as well as classiﬁes and compares various wireless\n\
    communication protocols, the taxonomy of energy-efﬁcient and energy harvesting\
    \ techniques for\nWSNs that can be used in agricultural monitoring systems, and\
    \ comparison between early research\nworks on agriculture-based WSNs. The challenges\
    \ and limitations of WSNs in the agricultural domain\nare explored, and several\
    \ power reduction and agricultural management techniques for long-term\nmonitoring\
    \ are highlighted. These approaches may also increase the number of opportunities\
    \ for\nprocessing Internet of Things (IoT) data.\nKeywords: energy-efﬁcient; energy\
    \ harvesting; precision agriculture; wireless communication\ntechnology; WSN\n\
    1. Introduction\nWireless sensor network (WSN) technologies have rapidly developed\
    \ over the years. Ecological\nphenomena in a vast area can be monitored using\
    \ pervasive devices called motes or sensor nodes.\nBattery-powered WSNs comprise\
    \ several sensors, processors, and radio frequency (RF) modules.\nThe sensor nodes\
    \ or motes can communicate wirelessly through a communication link and forward\n\
    their data to a base station or coordinator node by communicating with a gateway.\
    \ The communication\namong sensor nodes depends on the merging of diverse sensors\
    \ from simple (i.e., humidity, pressure,\nand temperature) to complex (i.e., localization,\
    \ tracking, micro-radars, and images), thereby allowing\nWSNs to monitor a wide\
    \ range of surroundings to obtain precise information from the ﬁeld [1].\nAccordingly,\
    \ the sensing, storage, processing, and communication capabilities of sensor nodes\
    \ have\ncontinuously increased [2].\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781; doi:10.3390/s17081781\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n2 of 45\nWSNs have been\
    \ used in different applications, such as military, agriculture, sports, medicine,\
    \ and\nindustry. Agriculture can be considered as one of the most favorable facilities\
    \ for WSNs to improve\nfood crop yields and minimize the burden of farmers [3].\
    \ Several projects have been introduced in\nthe precision agriculture (PA) literature.\
    \ PA aims to prevent the application of the same management\nroutine to a crop\
    \ regardless of site circumstances and to improve ﬁeld management from several\n\
    perspectives. For instance, PA can minimize the wastage of pesticides for the\
    \ effective control of weeds,\npests, and diseases as well as guarantee that crops\
    \ receive an adequate amount of nutrients, thereby\nleading to a highly effective,\
    \ green agriculture. Speciﬁcally, PA is a management strategy that employs\ninformation\
    \ technology to improve agricultural quality and production. PA differs for traditional\n\
    farming in the sense that this process accurately identiﬁes variations and relates\
    \ the spatial data to\nmanagement activities. PA involves ﬁve stages, namely,\
    \ (i) data collection, (ii) diagnosis, (iii) data\nanalysis, (iv) precision ﬁeld\
    \ operation, and (v) evaluation [4].\nWSNs are used as cost-effective processes\
    \ to increase agricultural yield. Accordingly, WSNs have\nbeen used in different\
    \ agricultural applications, such as for monitoring climate and using soil nutrient\n\
    data to forecast the health of crops and the quality of agricultural products.\
    \ Irrigation planning can\nbe predicted using WSNs by observing weather conditions\
    \ (such as temperature and humidity) and\nsoil moisture. Other sensor nodes can\
    \ be added to the existing WSN to improve the parameters of the\nagricultural\
    \ monitoring system and to make the network scalable. However, some challenges\
    \ have\nhindered the agricultural application of WSNs, such as determining optimum\
    \ deployment schemes,\nmeasurement periods, routing protocols, energy efﬁciency,\
    \ cost, communication range, scalability, and\nfault tolerance [5]. For example,\
    \ the scattered deployment of sensor nodes with a long data-gathering\nperiod\
    \ can help extend the network lifetime. However, some factors may challenge the\
    \ selection of the\ndistribution region. When the agricultural ﬁeld faces many\
    \ obstacles, the communication link may\nbe weakened or lost as a result of signal\
    \ attenuation. The sensor nodes in WSNs are supplied from\nthe battery, thereby\
    \ preventing connections to the main supply in the deployment location. Reducing\n\
    power depletion and prolonging battery life are imperative for WSNs considering\
    \ their limited battery\npower. Although the application of WSNs has increased\
    \ constantly over the years, the manufacturing\nof batteries has not developed\
    \ at the same rate [6]. Therefore, WSNs are mainly limited by their\nbatteries\
    \ [7]. Among the aforementioned challenges, this paper focuses on energy management\
    \ and\nhighlights energy-efﬁcient and energy harvesting techniques that can be\
    \ used in agriculture.\nTo fulﬁll PA requirements, such as addressing the problems\
    \ resulting from the long distance\nbetween farms and base stations, a mobile\
    \ data connection service can be established by connecting\nunmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ or drones with the base station [4]. Such connection allows the sensor nodes\n\
    to relay their data to the base station within the wide area of the farm ﬁeld.\
    \ However, this solution is\nlimited by the quality of service of WSNs.\nThe main\
    \ contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n(i)\nThe potential of\
    \ using wireless communications protocols or technologies in agriculture was\n\
    investigated, and the technology with the best power consumption and communication\
    \ distance\nwas identiﬁed.\n(ii)\nThe taxonomy of energy-efﬁcient and energy harvesting\
    \ techniques was examined to address the\npower consumption problems in agriculture\
    \ and to identify those methods that are most suitable\nfor solving these problems.\n\
    (iii)\nThe existing solutions, applicability, and limitations of applying WSNs\
    \ in agriculture were\nreviewed and compared.\n(iv)\nRecent studies using WSN\
    \ in PA applications based on Internet of Things (IoT) were surveyed\nand compared\
    \ in terms of type of sensors and actuators, IoT end devices, IoT platforms, and\
    \ IoT\napplication layer.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n3 of 45\n2. Wireless Communication\
    \ Technologies for Agriculture\nThis section presents the different wireless protocols\
    \ and standards that are used in agriculture.\nThese wireless technologies are\
    \ also compared to identify the most convenient technology in terms of\npower\
    \ consumption and communication range, where the two metrics are posed challenges\
    \ in current\nsolution of agriculture application [5,8]. IoT is a revolution for\
    \ the future realm where everything\nthat can utilize a connection will be connected.\
    \ Cellular technologies are grown and developed to\nplay a crucial role in the\
    \ IoT realm [9]. Narrowband-IoT (NB-IoT) is a new IoT system constructed\nfrom\
    \ current Long Term Evolution (LTE) functionalities. Subsequently, NB-IoT is possible\
    \ to share the\nspectrum of LTE without coexistence problems and to utilize the\
    \ same pieces of equipment, as well\nas it is possible to connect seamlessly into\
    \ the LTE main network. This permits all network facilities\nsuch as security,\
    \ tracking, policy, charging, and authentication to be totally supported [10].\
    \ The design\ngoals of NB-IoT cover high coverage area, extended battery life\
    \ (i.e., 10 years), high network size\n(52,000 devices/channel/cell), and low-cost\
    \ devices [10,11]. However, in the near future, NB-IoT\ntechnologies, such as\
    \ Long Range radio (LoRa) will take place in agricultural applications due to\
    \ low\npower consumption and preferably used when the agricultural information\
    \ are to be transmitted over\nlong distances.\n2.1. ZigBee Wireless Protocol\n\
    ZigBee wireless protocol is considered one of the best candidate technologies\
    \ for the agriculture\nand farming domains. Given its low duty cycle, ZigBee is\
    \ considered appropriate for PA applications,\nsuch as irrigation supervision\
    \ [12], water quality management, and fertilizer and pesticide control,\nall of\
    \ which require a cyclic information update. Based on this technology, the sensor\
    \ nodes in the\nagricultural ﬁeld can communicate with the router or coordinator\
    \ node over a long range (i.e., 100 m)\nwhen XBee Series 2 is used. ZigBee can\
    \ also reduce the communication distance by up to 30 m for\nindoor conditions\
    \ (i.e., greenhouses) [13]. The number of deployed sensor and router nodes will\
    \ be\nincreased to cover the entire ﬁeld area under surveillance. Some studies\
    \ have employed Zigbee for PA.\nFor instance, ZigBee was used to investigate the\
    \ effect of signal strength on node spacing, base station\nantenna height, and\
    \ leaf density [14]. In [14], three experiments were conducted in palm orchards\
    \ in\nto evaluate a signal propagation model based on the received signal strength\
    \ indicator (RSSI) of the\nZigBee wireless protocol. Through their experiments,\
    \ the authors concluded that the wireless channel\npropagation model must be determined\
    \ before deploying the sensor nodes in palm orchards to obtain\nrobust signal\
    \ strength characteristics. A path loss model in a mango greenhouse was investigated\n\
    based on the ZigBee wireless protocol [15].\nA cattle-localization-system-based\
    \ ZigBee WSN was also applied in a grazing ﬁeld [16]. Instead of\nrequiring additional\
    \ hardware, ZigBee relies on link quality indication (LQI) to measure distance.\
    \ The\nZigBee protocol achieves cattle localization at a low power consumption\
    \ and minimum cost. The key\nparameters of greenhouse climate (i.e., humidity,\
    \ temperature, CO2, and solar radiation) are considered\nin [17] to ensure the\
    \ comfortable growth of plants with 22% energy savings and 33% water usage.\n\
    ZigBee and Global System for Mobile communication/General Packet Radio Service\
    \ (GSM/GPRS)\ntechnologies were used to monitor and control the climate condition\
    \ of greenhouses [17]. The ZigBee\nwireless protocol has also been used to monitor\
    \ animal behavior (e.g., walking, grazing, lying down,\nand standing) [18]. ZigBee\
    \ was also adopted in [18] to overcome the high power consumption and\nunreliability\
    \ issues in mobile ad hoc WSNs.\nA WSN-based greenhouse that uses ZigBee star\
    \ topology is merged with artiﬁcial intelligence\n(i.e., fuzzy logic controller)\
    \ in [19]. The ZigBee wireless protocol is adopted to preserve energy by\nswitching\
    \ between active and sleep states. Thus, power consumption can be minimized, and\
    \ the\nbattery lifetime of sensor nodes can be extended. ZigBee is currently applied\
    \ in smart beehives [20],\norange orchards [21], dairy healthcare monitoring of\
    \ cows in pastures and barns [22], automation in\nirrigation [23], greenhouse\
    \ monitoring systems [24,25], and livestock monitoring [26]. As a universal\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 1781\n4 of 45\nstandard for WSNs, the ZigBee protocol was used\
    \ in several agricultural applications because of its\nlow power consumption,\
    \ low cost, self-forming characteristics, and suitable communication range.\n\
    2.2. Bluetooth (BT) Wireless Protocol\nThe BT standard has been utilized to establish\
    \ a communication link between movable and\nportable devices, such as laptops,\
    \ over a short distance of up to 10 m. Given its pervasive nature\nand availability\
    \ in most mobile devices, BT has been employed to satisfy multi-level agricultural\n\
    requirements [5].\nWeather information, soil moisture, sprinkler position, and\
    \ temperature are\nmonitored remotely using Global Positioning System (GPS) and\
    \ BT technologies. The proposed\nsystem in [27] was developed for irrigation application\
    \ to increase ﬁeld productivity and conserve\nwater. The irrigation application\
    \ proposed in [28] collects ﬁeld information in real time via the BT\nwireless\
    \ communication protocol. Several software and hardware were developed in [29]\
    \ to monitor\nthe relative humidity and temperature in greenhouses based on BT.\
    \ The BT module was employed in\nintegrated control method [30] to control the\
    \ irrigation system in greenhouses based on soil and weather\ninformation, and\
    \ this technology improved the leaf number, height, dry weight, and fresh weight\n\
    of red and romaine lettuce in greenhouses. Result of estimation for water usage\
    \ and electricity also\nimproved by 90% based on integrated control method using\
    \ BT technology relative to the traditional\nmethod (i.e., timer control strategy).\
    \ Given its low energy consumption, wide availability, and ease of\nuse for farmers,\
    \ smartphone-based BT has been employed in different agricultural applications\
    \ [31–35],\nsuch as controlling irrigation systems, monitoring soil and weather\
    \ conditions, and controlling the use\nof fertilizers and pesticides.\n2.3. WiFi\
    \ Wireless Protocol\nWiFi is currently the most extensively utilized wireless\
    \ technology available in portable devices,\nincluding tablets, smartphones, laptops,\
    \ and desktops. WiFi has a suitable communication distance of\nabout 20 m and\
    \ 100 m in indoor and outdoor environments, respectively. In PA applications,\
    \ WiFi\nextends diverse architectures by connecting several types of devices via\
    \ an ad hoc network. WiFi and\n3G wireless technologies were employed in [36]\
    \ to estimate the agricultural applications of mobile\nphones. Remote access and\
    \ short message services have also been used for controlling and monitoring\n\
    protected crops. In [37], agricultural data, such as soil temperature, soil moisture,\
    \ weather temperature\nand humidity, sunlight intensity, and CO2, were stored\
    \ in a gateway before they were transmitted\nto the server computer over a WiFi\
    \ network. A Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11g)-based smart WSN is proposed\nfor agricultural\
    \ monitoring in [38]. The proposed system consists of three nodes: sensor, router,\
    \ and\nserver. The climate conditions of the greenhouse or agricultural ﬁeld,\
    \ such as humidity, temperature,\nair pressure, light, water level, and soil moisture,\
    \ are monitored. The said work attempts to lower cost,\nminimize wiring connections,\
    \ and enhance the mobility and ﬂexibility of the sensing points in WSN.\nHowever,\
    \ the energy consumption of the proposed system is extremely high at 42.17 J/h.\n\
    Given that WiFi requires much power [5], long communication time, and huge data\
    \ payload [26].\nWiFi technology is not preferable for agricultural applications\
    \ in spite of the fact that a Wi-Fi server\nprevents data losses by adopting data\
    \ redundancy techniques. In addition, WiFi cannot be employed\nfor multi-hope\
    \ applications and inﬂuenced by number of users and the signal intensity; thereby,\n\
    it is inappropriate for agriculture WSNs. Moreover, the WiFi nodes listen all\
    \ the time, so power\nconsumption will increase [39].\n2.4. GPRS/3G/4G Technology\n\
    General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) is a packet data service for GSM-based cellular\
    \ phones.\nGPRS frequently experiences variable delays and throughputs, and such\
    \ technology depends on the\nvolume of consumers that share the same communication\
    \ channels and resources. Gutiérrez et al. [40]\nused the GPRS module and WSN\
    \ to develop an automatic crop irrigation system based on the\ninformation collected\
    \ by temperature and soil moisture sensors installed at the root zone of plants,\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 1781\n5 of 45\nand considered this system a cost-effective and\
    \ practical solution for improving water quality in\nPA. A drip irrigation process\
    \ was evaluated in [41] by measuring soil moisture. A prototype system\nwas also\
    \ developed based on a data management server and a WSN-GPRS gateway. WSN-GPRS\n\
    gateway acts as a bridge between WSN and GPRS where the data from the WSN are\
    \ transferred to a\ndata management center. Navarro-Hellín et al. [42] equipped\
    \ various wireless nodes with GPRS to\nmeasure and transmit soil, plant, and atmosphere\
    \ information. The wireless nodes have unlimited\nautonomy because of their independent\
    \ nature and use of solar energy. Different sensors may transmit\ninformation\
    \ to a remote location via a GPRS network for further analysis by using tablets,\
    \ mobile\nphones, or computers. All agriculture sensors are interfaced to the\
    \ sensor board to obtain agricultural\ninformation. Such information is transmitted\
    \ to the remote server for further analysis through the\nGPRS-board, which depends\
    \ on a GSM/GPRS mobile network.\n2.5. Long Range Radio (LoRa) Protocol\nLoRa is\
    \ introduced by the LoRa Alliance as a protocol stack for low power and wide area\
    \ Internet\nof Things (IoT) communication technologies that are associated with\
    \ indoor transmission [43]. The\nbasic network architecture of a LoRaWAN consists\
    \ of LoRa end devices, LoRa gateways, and a LoRa\nnetwork server. The LoRa end\
    \ device communicates with gateways that employ LoRa with LoRaWAN.\nLoRa gateways\
    \ pass raw LoRaWAN packets from the end devices to a LoRa network server with\n\
    a high throughput based on the backhaul interface, which is typically 3G or Ethernet.\
    \ Accordingly,\nLoRa gateways act as a bidirectional communication or protocol\
    \ adapter with the LoRa network\nserver. In this case, the LoRa network server\
    \ takes charge of decoding the data packets transmitted by\nthe LoRa devices and\
    \ creating the frames that would be directed back to the devices. LoRa offers\
    \ a\nbidirectional solution that matches machine-to-machine (M2M) WiFi or cellular\
    \ technologies. LoRa\npresents a cost-effective method for linking batteries or\
    \ mobile devices to the network or to end devices.\nThe LoRa wireless protocol\
    \ was used in [44] to monitor bee colonies in rural areas and to ensure a\ncommunication\
    \ between the bee node and the local server that is located in a remote location.\
    \ The\nsoil moisture and temperature, air temperature and humidity, and light\
    \ intensity inside greenhouses\nwere also monitored using different sensors, microcontrollers,\
    \ and the LoRa wireless protocol [8]. The\nLoRa gateway collects data from LoRa\
    \ nodes to construct the topology of a star network, and may\ncommunicate with\
    \ a cloud server over a long communication range and with high scalability.\n\
    LoRa was recently utilized in several agriculture research projects developed\
    \ by the Libelium\nCompany (Zaragoza, Spain) [45], such as improving kiwi production\
    \ based on a smart irrigation system\n(Italy), monitoring of green areas by using\
    \ a smart garden system (Spain), improving fertilization\nmethods of corn yields\
    \ (Italy), improving production of banana yields (Colombia), increasing\ntobacco\
    \ crops by controlling the climate condition (Italy), saving water through a smart\
    \ irrigation\nsystem (Barcelona), monitoring of vineyard crops (Spain), and monitoring\
    \ of diseases that affect\nvineyards (Switzerland).\n2.6. SigFox Protocol\nSigFox\
    \ is an ultra-narrowband wireless cellular network [43] with low data rate applications,\n\
    thereby making this technology appropriate for IoT and machine-type communications\
    \ systems.\nSigFox has been used in different applications, including telephone,\
    \ security, mobile, broadband, and\ntelevision. The SigFox network was used in\
    \ [46,47] to construct a geolocation system that localizes\nanimals in mountain\
    \ pastures throughout the summer. A system was proposed in [46] to help farmers\n\
    locate their cattle and enhance their production. The importance of power consumption\
    \ analyses was\nhighlighted in [47], especially when the cattle are located in\
    \ high mountainous areas.\n2.7. Performance Comparison of Wireless Communication\
    \ Protocols\nTable 1 compares the aforementioned wireless communication protocols\
    \ or technologies relative\nto different parameters, including power consumption,\
    \ communication range, data rate, cost, system\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n6 of 45\n\
    complexity, and other parameters. The challenges in agricultural applications\
    \ may be developed from\nthe selection of the deployment range. For instance,\
    \ the transmitted signal by the sensor node is\nattenuated when the agriculture\
    \ ﬁeld is separated by obstacles. Power consumption is considered as\nanother\
    \ limitation in the WSN design in agricultural applications [5]. The ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol was\ndesigned to run with a suitable communication range and low power\
    \ consumption. LoRa and SigFox\nare considered to work with low power consumption\
    \ and long radio range. Accordingly, the power\nconsumption and communication\
    \ distance of the above technologies have been assessed as follows.\nZigbee and\
    \ Bluetooth low energy (BLE) are designed for battery-powered devices.\nThese\n\
    technologies conserve power through low duty cycling and enter sleep mode to extend\
    \ the battery\nlifetime. Classic BT, WiFi, GPRS, LoRa, and SigFox have a higher\
    \ power consumption than ZigBee.\nAlthough ZigBee has a shorter communication\
    \ range than LoRa, SigFox, and GPRS, this range may be\nextended with a router\
    \ node to overcome the node deployment limitations in agricultural applications.\n\
    BLE outperforms ZigBee in terms of power consumption, but this wireless protocol\
    \ is limited in\nagricultural applications because of its short communication\
    \ distance of 10 m, as reported in [48].\nZigBee also has a higher network elasticity\
    \ than BT, thereby permitting various topologies. Given the\nlarge number of nodes\
    \ (more than 65,000) in the ZigBee network, the ZigBee technology can be used\n\
    to cover a wide agricultural. Accordingly, the ZigBee wireless protocol has been\
    \ adopted in many\nagriculture studies [5,49–53]. One of these studies [5] prefers\
    \ to utilize ZigBee in farming domains and\nagricultural applications owing to\
    \ its energy-efﬁcient, reliable, and low-cost wireless protocol.\nThe LoRa wireless\
    \ protocol covers a large communication area with low power consumption.\nTherefore,\
    \ it can be suitably deployed in vast agricultural ﬁelds. The network size of\
    \ the LoRa protocol\nis limited by its duty cycle, where a 1% duty cycle can lead\
    \ to a maximum communication time of 36 s\nper hour for each end device [54].\
    \ In addition, LoRa gateways have a limited message capacity of less\nthan 100\
    \ messages per minute because of the unplanned deployment of LoRa gateways in\
    \ urban areas,\nthereby interfering with low power wireless area networks, such\
    \ as SigFox. Therefore, increasing the\nnumber of gateways can challenge the infrastructure\
    \ of the LoRa network [54]. Moreover, the LoRa\ntechnology is complex and has\
    \ sizable hardware implementations [55].\nSigFox has an extremely low data rate\
    \ (100 bps) and slow transmission time (10 s for 10 bytes)\ncompared with ZigBee\
    \ and LoRa [56]. SigFox supports star topology supervised by a centralized sever\n\
    that manages connectivity between devices and the base stations, whereas the LoRa\
    \ supports wide\narea network based on star-to-star topology creating a bridge\
    \ of LoRa gateways. Given that data rate\nand transmission time are both critical\
    \ issue in any communication system, SigFox cannot be widely\nused for agricultural\
    \ applications. Moreover, this technology does not support the collision avoidance\n\
    scheme, thereby affecting the network because several M2M devices may be operated\
    \ in the same\narea. Moreover, SigFox has a limited reliability because of its\
    \ one-way communication (without an\nacknowledgment signal) and low received power.\
    \ However, both the LoRa and SigFox infrastructures\nare still in progress. Ali\
    \ et al. further discuss the limitations of these protocols [56].\nFrom the above\
    \ discussion and the comparison results presented in Table 1 and Figure 1\nand\
    \ as will be shown in Tables 2–8 the ZigBee and LoRa wireless protocols have been\
    \ identiﬁed\nas the most suitable wireless protocols for agricultural applications\
    \ because of their low power\nconsumption, communication range (acceptable for\
    \ ZigBee and long for LoRa), small size, easy\nnetwork implementation, simplicity,\
    \ low latency (for ZigBee), scalability, and network size.\nSensors 2017, 17,\
    \ 1781\n7 of 45\n \ninfrastructures are still in progress. Ali et al. further\
    \ discuss the limitations of these protocols [56].  \nFrom the above discussion\
    \ and the comparison results presented in Table 1 and Figure 1 and as \nwill be\
    \ shown in Tables 2–8 the ZigBee and LoRa wireless protocols have been identified\
    \ as the most \nsuitable wireless protocols for agricultural applications because\
    \ of their low power consumption, \ncommunication range (acceptable for ZigBee\
    \ and long for LoRa), small size, easy network \nimplementation, simplicity, low\
    \ latency (for ZigBee), scalability, and network size. \n \nFigure 1. Different\
    \ wireless technologies in terms of power consumption and communication \ndistance.\
    \ \nFigure 1. Different wireless technologies in terms of power consumption and\
    \ communication distance.\nPA using sensors, actuator, processor, wireless transceiver,\
    \ and other information technologies,\npotentially permits manufacturers to computerize\
    \ site-speciﬁc management for automated agriculture.\nIn terms of precision, the\
    \ considered wireless protocols for agricultural applications have improved\n\
    the agriculture domain. Precision irrigation is frequently regarded as optimizing\
    \ irrigation accuracy\ndue to its ability to control the optimum amount of water\
    \ and irrigation time. The water savings\nof 90% (based on ZigBee), 33% (based\
    \ on ZigBee), 50% (based on Bluetooth), and 90% (based on\nBluetooth) were achieved\
    \ for precision irrigation systems relative to traditional irrigation systems\
    \ in\nresearch [17,28,30,40], respectively. Animal behavior, such as laying down,\
    \ standing, grazing, walking,\nand other modes, was monitored in [18] using ZigBee\
    \ wireless protocol. The authors found that\nlaying down and grazing could be\
    \ improved by 83.5% compared with the ﬁndings from similar\nstudies. In another\
    \ study that has adopted a proposed algorithm that depended on the ZigBee wireless\n\
    protocol [20], an accuracy rate of 95.4% was expected for the proposed algorithm\
    \ to monitor the\nhoney bee and the agricultural and environmental aspects. In\
    \ [23], the automation of the irrigation\nsystem based on ZigBee saved the system\
    \ cost between 1.24% and 6.72% relative to the entire cost\nof the water user\
    \ associations, with energy savings of 2.05 to 8.21% and water savings of 0.71\
    \ to\n6.46%. The proposed model in [35] utilized a smartphone platform (based\
    \ on Bluetooth and GSM\ntechnologies) and permitted three types of irrigation\
    \ systems. The efﬁciency factors were improved\nby 90% for subsurface drip type\
    \ and 85% and 75% for high- and low-pressure overhead sprinkler\ntypes, respectively,\
    \ to compute for drift and evaporation before the water droplets approached the\n\
    soil. 3G technology was adopted by Libelium based on Waspmote wireless sensor\
    \ devices to monitor\nthe vineyards in Northwest Spain [57]. Phytosanitary treatments,\
    \ such as fungicides and fertilizers,\nwere minimized by 20% and growing yields\
    \ were enhanced by 15% based on PA. In [8], LoRa wireless\nprotocol was considered\
    \ to monitor the agriculture environments with 90% power efﬁciency. The cost\n\
    of pumping and water for precision irrigation system in green areas was reduced\
    \ by 30% based on\nSigFox wireless protocol [58].\nThe preceding survey for different\
    \ agricultural applications revealed that PA can be achieved\nin terms of water\
    \ savings, animal behavior, accuracy, power efﬁciency, and reducing system cost\n\
    for various wireless protocols. Consequently, agriculture can be improved based\
    \ on agricultural\nautomation systems compared with traditional agriculture systems.\n\

    \ may operate at different energy states. Therefore, the lifespan of a sensor\
    \ node is the\ntime consumed to exhaust its batteries under a sustainable operation\
    \ threshold.\nNumerous scholars have developed power reduction techniques to provide\
    \ sensor nodes an\ninﬁnite lifespan. This section reviews several power reduction\
    \ techniques of WSNs that can be used in\nagricultural applications. The purposes,\
    \ wireless protocols, ﬁndings, advantages, and limitations of\neach technique\
    \ are also discussed.\n3.1.1. Sleep/Wake Strategy\nWireless transceivers consume\
    \ a signiﬁcant amount of power relative to processors. The energy\nof the wireless\
    \ nodes is mostly dissipated during the reception and transmission processes.\
    \ The radio\nof sensor nodes can enter sleep mode via the sleep/wake strategy\
    \ to reduce the power consumption\nof the RF components of WSNs. No data communication\
    \ occurs during the sleep mode. The sensor\nnodes wake up to collect and transmit\
    \ data within a certain period and then return to sleep mode\nto conserve energy.\
    \ In agricultural applications, the sleep/wake strategy is implemented via (i)\
    \ duty\ncycling, (ii) medium-access control (MAC) protocols, and (iii) topology\
    \ control.\nDuty cycle is proposed in several studies to lower the power consumption\
    \ for different agricultural\napplications based on WSN. Zhang et al. [69] proposed\
    \ a WSN-based system to monitor soil moisture\nand analyzed the temporal and spatial\
    \ variability of soil moisture for variable irrigation. To reduce the\npower consumption\
    \ of the soil sensor nodes, the soil moisture sensors were always in sleep mode\
    \ and\nactivated only when data were to be collected. Million et al. [70] designed\
    \ a WSN for PA in Malawi\nand called it WiPAM. This system was intended to automate\
    \ irrigation and implement an irrigation\nmanagement system (IMS). The authors\
    \ investigated soil moisture variability. The sensor nodes\nwere homogeneous,\
    \ and each was composed of a ZigBee end device (ZED) and a ZigBee coordinator\n\
    (ZC). In the star topology, three sensors nodes were conﬁgured as ZED (in ﬁeld-nodes)\
    \ and one as a\ngateway node. Another node was conﬁgured as ZC for aggregating\
    \ data and actuating the irrigation\nvalves. The power source to sustain the operation\
    \ of the network was solar power. This approach\nwas complemented by an energy-efﬁcient\
    \ management approach. In other words, sensor nodes went\nto sleep when idle and\
    \ woke up to transmit data when required. The irrigation valves opened or\nclosed\
    \ depending on the values stored in the coordinator node. Ouadjaout et al. [71]\
    \ presented an\nenergy-efﬁcient WSN for soil moisture monitoring in an irrigation\
    \ system. The new platform, DZ50,\nconsists of an RFM12b transceiver and an ATmega328P\
    \ microcontroller. This platform consumes very\nlow power, and much energy can\
    \ be saved in sleep mode, in which the transceiver goes inactive (sleep\nmode)\
    \ for long periods. Comparison showed that the performance of DZ50 is better than\
    \ that of\nTelosB and MicaZ. Speciﬁcally, the battery lifetime of DZ50 is seven\
    \ times that of TelosB and MicaZ\nbased on a 10 s sampling period. Monitoring\
    \ of environmental conditions, such as wind direction,\nwind speed, humidity,\
    \ temperature, conductivity, rain level, pH, and water level, in crop ﬁelds was\n\
    presented in [72]. A solar cell was used to power several sensor nodes deployed\
    \ at a distance of 500 m\nto 5 km. WSNs based on IEEE 802.15.4 (C1120 transceiver)\
    \ and GPRS/3G were adopted to transmit the\nrural environments to the base station.\
    \ Energy was saved through low duty cycling (3.3%) for the RF\ntransceiver; the\
    \ saved energy is equivalent to 30 s of wake up time every 15 min. In addition,\
    \ a 2-watt\nsolar cell was used to supply power to the overall system, whose total\
    \ average power consumption\nwas 207 mW.\nMAC protocols were also proposed in\
    \ previous research on agriculture WSNs [39,73–76].\nSudha et al. [39] proposed\
    \ an energy-efﬁcient TDMA-based algorithm for wireless sensor\ncommunications\
    \ in an automatic irrigation system. Their experiment involved a header node that\n\
    collected data directly from all the nodes in the ﬁeld and passed these data to\
    \ the base station (BS).\nThis network arrangement was a star single-hop topology.\
    \ These techniques attain power savings\nof 10% with a high communication distance\
    \ of 1 km between the sensor node and the base station.\nHowever, when this distance\
    \ increases, the power consumption also increases. López et al. [75]\nproposed\
    \ a WSN for monitoring horticultural yields, which are disseminated among small\
    \ plots\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n11 of 45\nscattered at a communication distance\
    \ of 10 km. The air temperature and soil moisture are collected\nduring a 10-week\
    \ period. The authors adopted the MAC protocol and star topology to conserve the\n\
    power consumption of the sensor nodes that used the IEEE 802.15.4 standard based\
    \ on the CC2420\ntransceiver. The lifetimes of the soil moisture and air temperature\
    \ sensor nodes are 1024 days and\n222 days, respectively, utilizing a battery\
    \ that delivers 2700 mAh.\nThe topology protocol scheme can be used in agricultural\
    \ monitoring WSNs to modify the network\ntopology according to the application\
    \ requirements, thereby reducing the number of active nodes in\na network. Some\
    \ nodes in the network can enter sleep mode to prolong the network lifetime when\n\
    they are not sensing the same area of interest. Aneeth and Jayabarathi [77] implemented\
    \ Ad hoc\nOn-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) and Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocols\
    \ over a different\ntopology of ZigBee WSN (i.e., cluster topology, random topology,\
    \ star topology with gateway based\non two cases; inside and outside) in simulation\
    \ environments by using the OPNET software (Riverbed,\nSan Francisco, CA, USA).\
    \ Twenty soil moisture sensor nodes and one gateway node were distributed\nin\
    \ a farmland with a dimension of 100 × 100 m2. Each node sends information about\
    \ the soil moisture\nto the gateway node through the ZigBee wireless protocol.\
    \ The gateway node passes the information to\nthe controlling system to control\
    \ the irrigation valve system. Their study showed that the star topology\nusing\
    \ DSR protocol reduces the power consumption of the WSN because it has less routing\
    \ overhead\ncompared with AODV protocol. Table 2 shows the comparison of power\
    \ reduction technique based on\nsleep/wake schemes for previous research in agricultural\
    \ applications.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n12 of 45\nTable 2. Sleep/wake schemes\

    \ power is mostly dissipated in the RF components of WSNs than\nin data processing\
    \ units, such as microcontrollers and microprocessors [80]. A number of scholars\n\
    have applied various radio optimization schemes or techniques, including (i) transmission\
    \ power\ncontrol (TPC), (ii) modulation scheme, and (iii) cognitive radio, to\
    \ reduce the power consumption\nof the RF components of agriculture sensor nodes.\
    \ In the TPC scheme, the sensor nodes modify the\ntransmitted power to save energy,\
    \ stimulate avoiding interference, and establish a communication\nlink [81]. TPC\
    \ can be used in the agricultural ﬁeld [82,83], where the RF transmitted power\
    \ of the\nsensor nodes can be modiﬁed to reduce their power consumption based\
    \ on the measured distance\nbetween the sink node and the sensor nodes. Sahota\
    \ et al. [82] have investigated the application of\nTPC in reducing the power\
    \ consumption of the sensor nodes in precision agriculture-based WSNs.\nSeveral\
    \ power levels and different receiver sensitivity levels are considered to perform\
    \ the said process.\nThe network layers and MAC protocol in a WSN (based on CC1110)\
    \ for the agriculture domain are\nadopted to further lower the power consumption\
    \ of the sensor node. Results show that the power\nsaving that employs multiple\
    \ modes of transmitted power can be improved by approximately 10%\nrelative to\
    \ the traditional mode. By contrast, Kamarudin et al. [83] prolonged the lifetime\
    \ of the sensor\nnode by more than 8.5% by modifying the transmitted power of\
    \ the CC2420 communication device.\nA cognitive radio is an intelligent wireless\
    \ communication network [84] in which the wireless\ncommunication channel in the\
    \ spectrum band can be selected efﬁciently [85]. The transmission metrics\n(e.g.,\
    \ transmitted power, carrier frequency, and modulation scheme) can be adjusted\
    \ accordingly.\nA cognitive radio requires more energy than conventional devices\
    \ do because it includes sophisticated\nand complex functions [86]. Therefore,\
    \ an energy-efﬁcient cognitive radio network poses challenges,\nespecially with\
    \ regard to the use of battery energy. In wireless communication, the electromagnetic\n\
    spectrum is fully occupied, with several bands being partially used or unused.\
    \ This situation supports\nthe utilization of a cognitive radio, in which spectrum\
    \ holes can be utilized.\nSabri et al. [19] fused fuzzy logic control (FLC) with\
    \ a ZigBee wireless sensor actor network\n(WSAN), which can sense the surroundings\
    \ and respond in ideal performance without interference\nfrom agricultural crops.\
    \ FLC assists the specialists in managing complex systems more compared with\n\
    traditional control methods, which are ineffective in terms of ﬂexibility, energy,\
    \ productivity, and labor\ninterference. Two signiﬁcant greenhouse environment\
    \ parameters (i.e., humidity and temperature)\nare monitored during daytime and\
    \ nighttime. The results show that the intelligent technique-based\nFLC can signiﬁcantly\
    \ improve the WSAN lifespan. Therefore, the WSAN can work for 14 years with a\n\
    210 mAh battery power based on the FLC merged with WSAN.\nThe power consumption\
    \ of networks can be directly affected by the modulation scheme [87]. The\nmodulation\
    \ parameters can be adjusted to their optimal values to preserve the minimum power\n\
    consumption of radio modules. Anane et al. [88] investigated the Frequency-shift\
    \ keying (FSK) and\nMinimum-shift keying (MSK) modulation strategies to minimize\
    \ the total power consumption of\nthe sensor node required to transmit given data\
    \ packets. Through their extensive study, the authors\nconcluded that MSK outperforms\
    \ FSK in terms of power consumption. However, several modulation\nschemes cannot\
    \ be used in the ZigBee wireless protocol that operates at 2.4 GHz because this\
    \ protocol\nsupports a single modulation scheme. Speciﬁcally, the ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol works with offset\nquadrature phase-shift keying (OQPSK) [89]. Table\

    \ Data Mitigation\nData mitigation presents another power consumption solution\
    \ for agriculture WSNs to reduce the\namount of data transmitted from source nodes\
    \ to destination nodes. Data mitigation can be achieved\nvia (i) data gathering,\
    \ (ii) data comparison, (iii) data rate, and (iv) data-driven techniques.\nData\
    \ gathering can extend the lifetime of sensor nodes in WSNs by minimizing redundant\
    \ data\ntransmission. In different applications of agriculture WSNs including\
    \ environment observation, the\nsensed data of the neighboring nodes may spatially\
    \ be associated. In this case, data combination\npresents an important method\
    \ for reducing the amount of redundant data, reducing the number\nof transmissions,\
    \ and minimizing the power consumption of the nodes in the network [90]. Data\n\
    gathering also reduces latency by minimizing data trafﬁc and improving the delay\
    \ between the sink\nand sensor nodes; after reducing the number of communications,\
    \ this approach can improve the\nexploitation of bandwidth [91]. Data merging\
    \ can be accomplished along a route starting from sensor\nnodes to sink nodes.\
    \ The nodes in a route can rebroadcast only the maximum, minimum, or average\n\
    amount of received data. The design of an energy-efﬁcient WSN-based data-gathering\
    \ scheme poses a\nsigniﬁcant challenge because this scheme must ensure a trade-off\
    \ among power consumption, latency,\nsecurity, data accuracy, and fault tolerance.\n\
    Gathering data in agricultural applications, including humidity, weather, temperature,\
    \ and soil\nmoisture, can minimize the power consumption of environment sensor\
    \ nodes by spatially correlating\nthe ﬁeld and redundant data of the sensor nodes\
    \ when the temperature does not change signiﬁcantly [1],\nespecially during nighttime.\
    \ For example, if the microcontroller of the temperature sensor node\nmeasures\
    \ the same temperature value for extended hours, then the sensor node sends the\
    \ temperature\nvalue every four hours to reduce power consumption. Merging the\
    \ temperature and humidity\nsensors into a single sensor may also reduce the power\
    \ consumption, size, and system complexity.\nAzaza et al. [17] integrated climate\
    \ condition parameters (i.e., temperature, CO2, humidity, and\nilluminance sensors)\
    \ inside a greenhouse and observed a comfortable growth of plants while saving\n\
    water resources and energy. The greenhouse was equipped with environment control\
    \ devices, such as\nventilation system, fogging system for humidiﬁcation, and\
    \ electrical heaters. A smart system based on\nfuzzy logic control correlated\
    \ humidity and temperature measurements is implemented to improve\nthe fogging\
    \ system operation. In that way, the power consumption of the fogging system can\
    \ be\nsigniﬁcantly reduced. In addition, the system was improved by a wireless\
    \ data observing platform\n(STM 32/F4 microcontroller and Virtex V FPGA board)\
    \ for logging and data routing, which provides\ndata access in real time. The\
    \ suggested control system based on fuzzy logic control was experimentally\nimplemented\
    \ and validated. The results revealed that the total energy and water usage decreased\
    \ by\n22% and 33%, respectively.\nMusaazi et al. [92] introduced a data caching\
    \ algorithm (DCAL) that optimizes the sleep/wake up\nperiods of ZigBee WSNs to\
    \ achieve low energy consumption and latency in PA application. In WSNs,\ndata\
    \ are collected from the source nodes and routed to the sink node; from the sink\
    \ node, the data\nare sent to the Internet. Reducing the transmission of duplicated\
    \ sensed data reduces the power\nconsumption. Energy conservation is paramount\
    \ during the communication phase to prolong the\nlifetime of sensor nodes. The\
    \ main method utilized to conserve energy involves switching off the nodes’\n\
    transceiver when they are not transmitting nor receiving packets. Additionally,\
    \ the data-gathering\nmethod for agriculture WSNs has been investigated in [93].\
    \ The proposed system includes ZigBee\nwireless sensor nodes, customized farming\
    \ personal digital assistants (PDAs), and a host PC. Each\nsensor node contains\
    \ four sensors to identify ﬁve agricultural ﬁeld parameters: soil temperature,\
    \ soil\nmoisture, environmental humidity, soil electrical conductivity, and environmental\
    \ temperature. The\nPDA combines the ZigBee coordinator node, GPRS module, and\
    \ GPS module. The ZigBee WSN\ngathers farming data and obtains GPS information\
    \ for each sensor node. It then passes the data to the\nhost PC through GPRS.\
    \ The experimental results show that the battery power of the sensor nodes can\n\
    be saved based on the data-gathering scheme.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n16 of 45\n\
    Data compression is a useful method for deploying sensor nodes with restricted\
    \ energy resources.\nInformation encoding can be performed in sensor nodes, whereas\
    \ information decoding can be\nperformed in sink nodes. Using compression techniques\
    \ to reduce the size of information that the\nsink nodes transmit over wireless\
    \ channels may also reduce the power consumption and extend the\nbattery life\
    \ of the sensor nodes. One study has applied data compression approaches to reduce\
    \ the\npower consumption for auto-irrigation system which based on CC1000 RF module\
    \ [41]. Based on this\nmethod, the battery of the sensor node can be extended\
    \ to 359 days.\nThe data-driven power reduction technique aims to reduce the amount\
    \ of sampled data by\nconserving the sensing accuracy to an appropriate level\
    \ for a speciﬁed application [94]. Thereby,\nthe amount of data to be transmitted\
    \ to the sink nodes can be minimized. Therefore, this technique\ncan reduce the\
    \ power consumption of agriculture WSNs and extend their battery life. A data-driven\n\
    algorithm is considered by Lerdsuwan and Phunchongharn [95] to solve the energy\
    \ consumption\nproblem of the sensor node in PA with low complexity and maintain\
    \ the transmission rate. Their\nexperiment reveals that their proposed algorithm\
    \ has higher energy efﬁciency than the ESPIN and\nSPIN algorithms in [96,97] by\
    \ 36.84% and 81.53%, respectively.\nThe data rate of RF transceivers can be adjusted\
    \ in the physical layer of a wireless protocol to\nreduce the power consumption\
    \ of the sensor node. Davis et al. [98] investigated the low battery\ncondition\
    \ of a sensor node to attain prolonged battery life for separate wireless sensor\
    \ nodes that\ncan preserve sampling suitability and reliability in communicating\
    \ accurate data. Different sensors,\nsuch as those for soil moisture, sap ﬂow,\
    \ and soil water, were examined to study the effect of sensing\ndebility due to\
    \ low battery voltage. The comparison of the data sampling rate of these sensors\
    \ shows\nthat sap ﬂow measurement is the best option for agricultural WSN. This\
    \ ﬁnding is attributed to the\nlow error obtained when the sampling interval increased\
    \ to 15 min while maintaining measurement\naccuracy. Table 4 shows the comparison\
    \ of power reduction technique based on data mitigation schemes\nfor previous\

    \ power reduction scheme for agriculture WSNs to minimize\nthe path between sensor\
    \ nodes and sink node, thereby the power consumption of the WSN is reduced.\n\
    Routing protocol can be performed via (i) sink mobility, (ii) multi-path routing,\
    \ (iii) cluster architecture,\nand (iv) routing metric.\nSink mobility was adopted\
    \ in previous research [99,100]. Mathur et al. [99] proposed a novel\nmechanism\
    \ that adopts unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to gather data from forest regions\
    \ instead\nof classical sensing from nodes deployed in WSN. The proposed method\
    \ enables the UAV to collect\ndata from WSN in harsh terrain and transmit it to\
    \ the base station situated far from the sensing area.\nTherefore, the multi-hop\
    \ transmission between cluster heads can be completely avoided, and the\ncommunication\
    \ range can be extended.\nMulti-path routing has also been suggested by other\
    \ scholars for agriculture WSNs [67,68,101].\nRecently, Nikolidakis et al. [67]\
    \ proposed an agricultural ﬁeld weather monitoring system based on\nthe ZigBee\
    \ wireless protocol. An advance energy-efﬁcient routing protocol was implemented\
    \ for WSN\nto automate irrigation management. The transmitter could modify its\
    \ power based on the distance\nbetween the sensor node and base station to save\
    \ energy. The results revealed that network lifetime\nincreased to 1825 min. Hedley\
    \ et al. [101] developed a WSN soil moisture mapping and monitoring\nmethod to\
    \ provide information for irrigation scheduling. To conserve power, the sensor\
    \ nodes relayed\ndata to the BS every 15 min through the greatest energy-efﬁcient\
    \ route.\nCluster head method is considered by Ndzi et al. [102] to extend the\
    \ ZigBee WSN lifetime for\nagricultural application.\nIn addition, the quality\
    \ of the crop yields is improved and their cost\nis minimized. The research presented\
    \ WSN coverage measurements in a mixed crop farmland.\nAn adaptive energy consumption\
    \ model for each sensor node was proposed and used to compute the\nenergy consumption\
    \ in the network. A deployment model with a cluster head and two antennas was\n\
    also proposed and simulated to alleviate short network lifetime due to the vegetation\
    \ attenuation of\nsignals. This network deployment model extended the lifetime\
    \ of the network by a factor of more than\n20 compared with a deployment where\
    \ cluster heads are not used. Nikolidakis et al. [103] proposed\na new routing\
    \ protocol for WSN that can reduce the power consumption of sensor nodes through\n\
    balanced clustering. This protocol was called “equalized cluster head election\
    \ routing protocol”\n(ECHERP). ECHERP was implemented in Java language for 500\
    \ homogeneous nodes distributed in a\n100 × 100 m2 land. The simulation results\
    \ showed that the proposed protocol outperforms existing\nprotocols in terms of\
    \ power consumption. A potential application of this protocol is PA.\nAnother\
    \ type of routing protocol is called routing metric. Chen et al. [104] used two\
    \ routing\nmetrics, namely, remained energy and expected transmission count, to\
    \ compute the optimal routing\npath to the sink node that ensures low power consumption.\
    \ “A scalable context-aware objective\nfunction (SCAOF)” is proposed by combining\
    \ robustness-aware, energy-aware, resource-aware, and\nreliability-aware contexts\
    \ that render to the compound routing metrics scheme. The experiment is\nconducted\
    \ in a garden based on a testbed, which includes a uIPv6 protocol stack and contiki\
    \ OS. The\nobtained results prove that SCAOF can convey the desired advantages\
    \ on network lifespan prolonging,\nas well as high efﬁciency and reliability in\
    \ different hardware testbeds and simulation scenarios.\nTable 5 shows the comparison\

    \ the power saving or battery lifetime,\ncommunication distance, and limitations\
    \ of WSNs in different agricultural applications in the work of\nseveral scholars\
    \ (Tables 2–6). The tables show that most previous studies used ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol\nfor different agricultural applications. The use of ZigBee supports\
    \ our assumption that this wireless\nprotocol is suitable for agricultural monitoring\
    \ systems as discussed in Section 2. A combination of two\nor more power reduction\

    the power consumption of the WSN. Table 6 shows the comparison of power reduction\

    \ Techniques\nA major limitation of sensor nodes is their limited battery capacity.\
    \ Several energy-efﬁcient\nschemes have been introduced in previous research to\
    \ solve the power consumption problem of sensor\nnodes. An alternative method\
    \ that has been utilized to address the problem of limited node lifespan is\n\
    the use of energy-harvesting techniques. Numerous techniques have been developed\
    \ to allow sensor\nnodes to harvest different types of energy, such as solar,\
    \ wireless power transfer (WPT), mechanical\nvibration, kinetic, and wind energy,\
    \ from different environments [110] (Figure 2). Compared with\ntraditional sensor\
    \ nodes, rechargeable sensor nodes can work continuously for a long lifetime.\
    \ Ambient\nenergy can be converted to electrical energy and used directly to supply\
    \ the sensor nodes or can be\nstored and used later on. In agricultural applications,\
    \ energy harvesting can be used to prolong the\nlifetime of sensor nodes. Energy-harvesting\
    \ techniques for previous research works employed in\nprecision agriculture are\
    \ shown in Table 7. The said table lists the categories of energy-harvesting\n\
    techniques, types of wireless protocols, and output energy/power of energy-harvesting\
    \ techniques.\nIn addition, the form of agricultural applications, and limitations\
    \ of each article are also highlighted.\nEnergy-harvesting mechanisms can be implemented\
    \ with batteries for the sensor nodes. For\nexample, a sensor node using solar\
    \ energy to charge its batteries can work extensively during daytime\nwhen adequate\
    \ sunlight is available. Meanwhile, the sensor node can use its batteries through\
    \ power\nreduction techniques, such as sleep mode (i.e., duty cycle), at night\
    \ when sunlight is unavailable to save\nenergy. In addition, the sensor node can\
    \ enter restricted sleep periods (i.e., low duty cycle) and reduce\ntransmission\
    \ power when its batteries possess low residual energy [111]. Furthermore, adopting\
    \ a\nmaximum power point tracking system is a reliable battery charging technique\
    \ for long-term operation.\nThe charge–discharge cycle of the battery is minimized\
    \ [112].\n3.2.1. Solar Energy\nSolar energy based on photovoltaic system and methods\
    \ can be used in agricultural applications\nbased on WSNs [113]. Therefore, solar\
    \ cells provide a good solution [114] to ensure the survivability\nof the agriculture\
    \ monitoring system. Solar cell energy has been used by several studies to provide\n\
    long-term energy to sensor nodes in agriculture applications.\nGutiérrez et al.\
    \ [40] developed an irrigation system based on the ZigBee wireless protocol. The\n\
    system was developed to improve water usage for agricultural crops. Temperature\
    \ and soil moisture\nsensors in WSN were placed in the root of the plants to send\
    \ sensor information to a web application\nvia a gateway. The proposed algorithm\
    \ controls the water quantity based on threshold values of soil\nmoisture and\
    \ temperature that are programmed in a microcontroller-based gateway. The WSN\
    \ is\npowered by solar cell panels and rechargeable batteries. Water savings of\
    \ up to 90% were achieved\nrelative to the conventional irrigation method. Considering\
    \ that the system is cost effective and\nautonomous, it can be utilized in geographically\
    \ isolated regions where water sources are limited.\nZou et al. [68] improved\
    \ the battery lifetime of a WSN based on harvested energy (i.e., solar cell)\n\
    utilizing shadow detection. With this strategy, sensor nodes can accordingly modify\
    \ their scheduling\nto optimize their power production and remaining battery levels.\
    \ Furthermore, data transmission is\noptimized through routing and clustering\
    \ mechanisms. A Bayesian network was employed to provide\nwarning reports of bottlenecks\
    \ along the path. The system was deployed in real time based on the\nTexas Instruments\
    \ CC2530 platform that includes the ZigBee wireless protocol. The battery (lithium\n\
    type with a storage capacity of 2500 mAh) of the sensor node was charged from\
    \ the solar cell panel\nwhen the harvested power was adequate. The experimental\
    \ results showed that these techniques\nallow network activities to occur in a\
    \ continuous and effective manner.\nIn [115], a micro-irrigation system that relies\
    \ on a small solar-powered cell was developed. The\nenergy input, energy output,\
    \ greenhouse gas productions, and solar cell installation for rural areas\nwere\
    \ investigated with the proposed co-located system. The researchers compared their\
    \ system\nwith another commonly used method (i.e., aloe vera cultivation) in terms\
    \ of life cycle. The life cycle\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n23 of 45\nevaluation\
    \ showed that the proposed system is economical for several rural areas and may\
    \ provide\nopportunities for agriculture electriﬁcation and motivate economic\
    \ growth.\nRoblin [116] presented an irrigation system relying on a solar cell\
    \ for rural areas where sunlight is\noften available. The irrigation system includes\
    \ pumps working on a solar cell instead of an electricity\ngrid and/or a diesel\
    \ generator. The study showed that the irrigation system based on a solar cell\
    \ is\nbetter than systems that depend on other energy resources because the electricity\
    \ grid is unavailable at\nall times, and the operating cost of diesel pumps is\
    \ high and relies mainly on the diesel price. Although\nthe solar-powered system\
    \ was relatively expensive, it became a free source of energy after installation\n\
    in the rural area and proved to be a worthwhile investment in the long term. A\
    \ similar irrigation\nsystem was proposed in [117]. The system adopts photovoltaic\
    \ panels to power a water pump that\nconverts the continuous drift of water into\
    \ a drop drift to achieve increased water usage efﬁciency.\nKwon et al. [118]\
    \ suggested a novel prediction technique for energy harvesting with a solar\n\
    cell within three hours. Moreover, the packet transmissions of the sensor nodes\
    \ can be controlled\ndepending on the estimated energy. Packet transmissions and\
    \ energy harvesting are integrated to\nimprove the WSN performance. The integration\
    \ of these schemes enhances the prediction accuracy\nand improves the WSN throughput\
    \ and power consumption. The throughput of the sensor node can\nbe increased by\
    \ shortening the packet transmission period. By contrast, when the packet transmission\n\
    period increases, the power consumption of the sensor node decreases. The experimental\
    \ results show\nthat the proposed packet transmission scheme is superior to the\
    \ others in terms of data throughput\nand deadline miss rate. The proposed energy-harvesting\
    \ method is also predicted more precisely than\nothers by 6.92%.\nA study [119]\
    \ used a solar cell to provide energy to a WSN deployed in a greenhouse. The\n\
    humidity and temperature of the greenhouse were controlled through a management\
    \ and monitoring\nsystem, which was based on a low-power MSP430 (Texas Instruments,\
    \ Dallas, TX, USA) microcontroller\nand an ultra-low-power nRF24L01 transceiver\
    \ (Nordic Semiconductor, Oslo, Norway). The power\nconsumption of the WSN was\
    \ minimized as much as possible. In another study, a WSN-based ZigBee\n(CC2420\
    \ module) wireless transceiver and microcontroller (low-power ATmega128L) supplied\
    \ by\nthe solar cell as a battery charger were considered to monitor the humidity,\
    \ temperature, rain level,\nand leaf wetness of vineyards [120]. The WSN covered\
    \ 30 m between ZigBee units with a low power\nconsumption (35 and 38 mW in transmission\
    \ and reception modes, respectively).\n3.2.2. Wireless Power Transfer\nRecent\
    \ developments in wireless power transfer (WPT) are expected to increase the lifetime\n\
    of WSNs signiﬁcantly and make them continuously operational, given that WPT techniques\
    \ can\nbe utilized to transmit electromagnetic energy between transmitter and\
    \ receiver devices without\nany contact between the two. WPT is expected to overcome\
    \ the constraint of the supply of WSNs.\nConsequently, some researchers highlighted\
    \ the utilization of mobile node that can deliver power\nto deployed sensor nodes\
    \ such as [121,122].\nWPT technology poses a challenge to the energy\ncooperation\
    \ between neighboring nodes in WSNs. Therefore, in the future, sensor nodes could\n\
    harvest energy from the environment and transfer this energy to other nodes in\
    \ the network; in this\nmanner, a self-sustaining network can be achieved [123].\
    \ Accordingly, recent research has investigated\nmulti-hop energy transfer [124,125],\
    \ which paved the way for new energy cooperative schemes and\nWPT charging protocols.\n\
    WPT can be classiﬁed into three main subcategories:\n(i) electromagnetic (EM)\
    \ radiation,\n(ii) magnetic resonator coupling, and (iii) inductive coupling,\
    \ as shown in Figure 2. Wireless charging\nin WSNs can be performed via EM radiation\
    \ and magnetic resonant coupling. EM signals suffer from\nattenuation over distance,\
    \ and active radiation may pose a threat to the human body. Meanwhile,\nmagnetic\
    \ resonant coupling can address the power requirements of agriculture based on\
    \ WSNs because\nof its efﬁciency within a distance of several meters. Many studies\
    \ used WPT to charge sensor nodes\nfor different applications and ﬁelds. WPT-based\
    \ inductive coupling [121] has been used to charge\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n24\
    \ of 45\nthe battery of sensor nodes scattered in agriculture ﬁelds. The energy\
    \ is transferred from the source\ncoil (mounted on a UAV) to the receiver coil\
    \ (attached with sensor nodes). A 2.4 W transfer power\nis transferred to charge\
    \ a single sensor node. The results addressed a number of limitations and\nchallenges\
    \ related to the charging of sensor nodes via a UAV. In addition, the results\
    \ revealed that\nthe battery lifetime of the deployed sensors can be signiﬁcantly\
    \ extended through the UAV. A similar\napproach was adopted by Chen et al. [122]\
    \ to charge a WSN in an agricultural ﬁeld through the\nharvesting of electromagnetic\
    \ radiation.\n3.2.3. Air Flow Energy\nHarnessing wind energy is another energy-harvesting\
    \ technique that can be utilized to provide\npower to sensor nodes in agricultural\
    \ applications. An adaptive routing protocol, wind energy\nharvesting, and sleep\
    \ scheduling were considered in [126] to minimize the power consumption of the\n\
    ZigBee transceiver and extend the lifetime of the WSN.\n3.2.4. Vibration Energy\n\
    Vibration energy based on piezoelectric can be used to charge the battery of sensor\
    \ nodes to prolong\ntheir lifetime. Müller et al. [127] have been analyzed various\
    \ WSN protocols based on ZigBee (CC2420\nand CC2500) and CC1100 with respect to\
    \ their applicability in the agricultural setting. Furthermore,\na fully synchronous\
    \ protocol with a time-slot architecture for a WSN has been proposed for agricultural\n\
    machinery to achieve real-time capability, low latency, and deterministic behavior.\
    \ The objective of\ntheir application was to monitor the back door position and\
    \ ﬁlling level of a forage wagon using a\nZigBee (CC2420) RF transceiver. Clock\
    \ synchronization among all nodes is implemented to ensure\nstrict power on/sleep\
    \ times of each sensor node. Meanwhile, an energy-harvesting unit based on a\n\
    piezoelectric material has been designed; the unit provides an average power of\
    \ 200 µW to sensor\nnodes. In this case, the sensor node can transmit a data payload\
    \ of nine bytes in 40 ms.\n3.2.5. Water Flow Energy\nMulti-energy sources (water,\
    \ wind, and solar) platform is designed for precision agricultural\napplications\
    \ by Morais et al. [128]. The authors explored water ﬂow, wind speed and solar\
    \ radiation\nfeasible energy sources to encounter the requirements of ZigBee router\
    \ node in WSN. Thus, several\npowered solutions for WSN is presented. Design considerations\
    \ regarding water ﬂow energy, the water\nﬂow in the pipes of crops irrigation\
    \ system are employed to generate the energy for ZigBee router node.\nThis idea\
    \ can be applied in different agricultural applications such as greenhouses, aquaculture,\
    \ and\nhydroponic systems, where the water recirculation in pipes is continuous.\
    \ Like to bulky hydroelectric\ngeneration utilities, a water ﬂow in the pipes,\
    \ derived from the main water source, can be employed\nto run a turbine joined\
    \ to a small direct current (DC) generator. The experimental results revealed\n\
    that the three energy sources combined together can generate an energy of 58 mAh,\
    \ more than the\nrequirement of the ZigBee router node (39 mAh).\n3.2.6. Microbial\
    \ Fuel Cell Energy\nAnother type of energy harvesting technique is called microbial\
    \ fuel cell. This technique is extracted\nfrom energy neutral system. Sartori\
    \ and Brunelli [129] proposed microbial fuel cell to supply the\nunderground freshwater\
    \ system that used for monitoring the water level in the phreatic zone, artesian\n\
    wells, and tanks. The proposed system comprises a low-cost phreatimeter sensor,\
    \ a low-power\nmicrocontroller (i.e., MSP430FR5739), and a low-power LoRa wireless\
    \ protocol. However, the amount\nof microbial fuel cell energy extraction of 296\
    \ µW is not enough to supply LoRa wireless protocol and\nmicrocontroller directly\
    \ when they are in active mode. Therefore, a DC-to-DC boost is employed to\nraise\
    \ the small input voltages of 130 mV to 4.5 V.\nEvidently, most agricultural applications\
    \ prefer to use solar cells as battery chargers of WSNs\nbecause these cells are\
    \ easy to install, work efﬁciently when sunlight is available, and supply more\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 1781\n25 of 45\nenergy compared with other energy-harvesting\
    \ techniques as shown in Table 7. In addition, the table\nshows most of the previous\
    \ scholars adopted ZigBee wireless protocol. Clearly, employing ZigBee\nsupports\
    \ our study that this wireless protocol is more suitable for agricultural monitoring\
    \ systems.\nSolar panels can supply 100 mW/cm2, whereas radio frequency, thermal,\
    \ vibration, wind, microbial\nfuel cell, magnetic resonant coupling WPT, and water\
    \ ﬂow can supply 0.001, 0.06, 0.8, 1.0, 0.296, 14, and\n19 mWs, respectively [128–131].\
    \ For example, as shown in Figure 3 (Part A), if the power consumption\nof the\
    \ WSN components presented in [120] is 35 mW for ZigBee (Chipcon CC2420), 0.27\
    \ mW for\nthe temperature sensor, 3 mW for the humidity sensor, 0.27 mW for the\
    \ rain gauge sensor, 5 mW\nfor the leaf wetness sensor, and 24 mW for the ATmega128L\
    \ microcontroller [132], a single solar cell\n(2 × 2 cm2) panel can adequate supply\
    \ this WSN. However, when the power consumption of the WSN\nincreases, the dimension\
    \ of the solar cell panel also needs to be increased.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n\

    \ the visibility of a group of systems, technologies, platforms, and design \n\
    principles for joining things, depending on the physical surroundings, through\
    \ the use of the Internet. \nPA is an application that can employ the benefits\
    \ of IoT to increase production efficiency, improve \nthe quality of yields, reduce\
    \ the negative ecological impact, prevent the prevalence of plant-eating \npests\
    \ or plant diseases, alert farmers about farm fires [141], and increase the profitability\
    \ of several \nagricultural production schemes. Agriculture involves farming,\
    \ planting, and animal rearing, and it \nhas grown under the scope of IoT recently\
    \ [5]. Tracking of animals, monitoring of farms, and \nirrigation processes are\
    \ the main domains of IoT for cultivation [142]. Furthermore, feeding, rearing,\
    \ \nmedication, and vaccination are essential applications of IoT in the agricultural\
    \ domain [143]. \nConsequently, several IoT modular architectures have been proposed\
    \ and implemented by scholars \nfor PA monitoring (as presented in Table 8). Real-time\
    \ ecological information can be remotely \ngathered from the agricultural surroundings\
    \ based on different sensors, which transmit the \ninformation to be processed\
    \ to determine problems, take required actions using actuators, or store \ndata.\
    \ \nSensors in WSN can be employed to gather information about environmental and\
    \ physical \nfeatures, whereas actuators are used to respond to the feedback to\
    \ control or to perform an action \nover the conditions (Figure 3, Part B). The\
    \ use of sensors in agricultural applications poses a number \nof requirements,\
    \ including gathering of soil, weather, and crop information; surveillance of\
    \ \nagricultural areas, water and fertilizer requirements of diverse pieces of\
    \ rough land, several crops on \na single piece of acreage, different requirements\
    \ of crops for unlike soil and weather circumstances, \nand eliminating of interactive\
    \ solutions and relying on proactive solutions. All these requirements \nare applied\
    \ and processed in parallel. Therefore, different sensors and actuators must be\
    \ used to \nhandle this information and respond to different conditions. Processed\
    \ information can be utilized \nto make a decision instead of raw data of the\
    \ sensor [132]. This information can be transmuted to the \ncloud computing via\
    \ gateway for data processing and data storage, as shown in Figure 3 (Part C).\

    \ soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and \nwind direction and speed sensors\
    \ to monitor the agricultural environments. “Adafruit Pro Trinket” \nplatform\
    \ was selected for the data processing, and nRF wireless protocol was used as\
    \ a transceiver \nto transfer sensor data to the gateway (i.e., Intel Edison to\
    \ reduce the power consumption). The \ngateway was in charge of collected information\

    \ The gateway\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n29 of 45\nwas in charge of collected information\
    \ from different sensors and passed the information to the cloud\nserver. The\
    \ proposed system resulted in improved crop quality and minimized negative ecological\n\
    effect. In [145], the usage of water in smart irrigation systems was controlled\
    \ based on developed IoT\nplatforms. A cloud agriculture ﬁeld-monitoring scheme\
    \ was designed and implemented to enable\nthe farmer to monitor the soil condition.\
    \ Soil moisture and weather temperature were monitored to\nautomate the irrigation\
    \ system in farm while minimizing water consumption, which led to reduced\ncost\
    \ and maintained environmental beneﬁts. The proposed water irrigation system included\
    \ three\nmain parts: a WSN and actuator, a cloud platform, and user application.\
    \ The WSN and actuator part\nconsisted of sensor nodes for collecting the soil\
    \ moisture and weather temperature, an actuator node\nto control the irrigation\
    \ process, and a sink node that could pass all farm information to the cloud\n\
    platform. All sensor, sink, and actuator nodes adopted low-power ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol.\nWSN and 3G network-based agriculture IoT was considered in [146]\
    \ to monitor the air\ntemperature, air humidity, and soil moisture. The entire\
    \ system consisted of sensor nodes, actuators\nsink nodes, server, gateway, and\
    \ the mobile phone device of the farmer. The collected information by\nthe sensor\
    \ nodes was sent to the server via gateway and Internet network. The gateway connected\
    \ the\nWSN with the Internet to relay the command control among the sensor nodes,\
    \ the phone of the farmer,\nthe actuators, and the server. However, in this system,\
    \ the data transmission over the 3G network\nmust ensure real-time communications\
    \ to support the agricultural WSN.\nIoT-based agriculture applications changed\
    \ classical agricultural surveillance approaches by\nspeedily providing quantitative\
    \ data with signiﬁcant temporal and spatial resolution. Several IoT\nplatforms\
    \ have recently been available in the market. For instance, in agricultural applications,\n\
    SmartFarmNet [147] platforms can be used to provide more than 30 packages for\
    \ good commercial\nproducts, such as Libelium [45], and experimental, such as\
    \ Motes [148] and Arduino [149] sensor\nplatforms. Other examples of agricultural\
    \ applications based on IoT are provided in Table 8. The table\npresents a comparative\

    \ of PA domain such as sensors, microcontrollers, and wireless technologies\n\
    are highlighted and classiﬁed in Table 9. For better clariﬁcation, the sensors\
    \ are classiﬁed into three\nmain categories leaf wetness/plant, soil moisture,\
    \ and environment sensors [5,132]. These sensors can\nbe utilized in several potential\
    \ agriculture applications. In Table 9, the microcontroller/processor and\nwireless\
    \ protocols are also highlighted. Among the microcontrollers, the majority of\
    \ agriculture sensor\nnodes adopting ATmega128L because this microcontroller supports\
    \ data aggregation, decision making,\nstorage capability, ﬂash memory, low complexity,\
    \ and energy management through multi-levels of\npower down modes [132]. ZigBee\
    \ and LoRa wireless protocols/technologies are widely used in several\nagricultural\
    \ applications, as discussed previously in Section 2.\nIn precision agriculture,\
    \ to obtain high-quality products, the environmental parameters should be\ncontrolled\
    \ to provide optimal values. For example, the temperature rate that has a positive\
    \ effect on the\ngrowth of the pepper ﬁeld is between 20 and 25 ◦C. The temperature\
    \ in rainy, sunny, and nightly days\nshould be kept between 20 and 22 ◦C, between\
    \ 25 and 28 ◦C, and between 18 and 20 ◦C, respectively\nand the minimum value\
    \ should be not lower than 16–17 ◦C. Air humidity for pepper vegetables should\n\
    be kept between 60% and 70%. The high-temperature value combines with low humidity\
    \ value may\nbe caused a negative inﬂuence on the growth of the pepper. The maximum\
    \ humidity value in pepper\ngreenhouse should be not above 70%. Soil pH (i.e.,\
    \ soil acidity) is another factor that directly effects\non the pepper crops,\
    \ where it can measure the quantity of calcium in the soil. The soil for pepper\n\
    crops can be acid or alkaline depending on the weather conditions. It should be\
    \ acid for wet climate\nand alkaline for a dry climate. Soil with pH levels above\
    \ 7.0 is considered alkaline, while soil with\npH levels below 7.0 has acid nature.\
    \ Soil pH values must be controlled according to the type of the\nagricultural\
    \ yield. For pepper crop, the best values for pH gauge are between 6.5 and 5.5.\
    \ Therefore,\nthe humidity, temperature, and soil pH should be constantly supervised\
    \ in order to identify the right\ntime for draining and watering the agricultural\
    \ crops.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n33 of 45\nTable 9. Types of sensors, microcontrollers,\

    \ Limitations\nThe development of WSNs prompted new research trends in the agricultural\
    \ domain. Micro\nelectromechanical system (MEMS) technologies allow for the manufacture\
    \ of cheap and small sensors.\nThe pervasive nature of the process, together with\
    \ tiny, self-regulating sensor nodes, cost-effective\nequipment, and scalability,\
    \ indicate that WSNs can be used for agriculture automation [5]. However,\nregarding\
    \ the distribution of WSNs to observe different agricultural climates, a number\
    \ of open\nchallenges and limitations remain. Several of these challenges and\
    \ limitations in existing agricultural\napplications based on WSNs are listed\
    \ below together with suggestions on how to address them.\n(1)\nPower consumption\
    \ and battery life:\nA WSN consists of three main components:\nsensors,\nmicrocontrollers,\
    \ and RF transceivers. Given that the battery of a sensor node provides limited\n\
    energy, ensuring that the components of the sensor node consume minimum power\
    \ is crucial.\nIn particular, reducing the power consumption of the RF transceiver,\
    \ which consumes more power\nthan the other components in a sensor node, would\
    \ alleviate this problem [67,127]. Moreover,\nthis issue can be addressed in two\
    \ steps. The ﬁrst is to propose an intelligent energy-efﬁcient\nalgorithm. The\
    \ second step can be performed by utilizing available energy-harvesting techniques,\n\
    such as solar cells, vibration, and WPT.\n(2)\nCommunication range: WSNs suffer\
    \ from the effect of harsh ecological conditions because of the\nwide range of\
    \ open agricultural surroundings [5]. The WSN protocol contains mechanisms to\n\
    resist the effect of data transmission failures in the network, which increase\
    \ due to ecological\neffects. In agricultural applications, most wireless sensor\
    \ technologies support a relatively short\ncommunication range. Therefore, many\
    \ sensor and router nodes need to be diffused in a WSN.\nIn the point-to-point\
    \ Zigbee network, the communication distance can reach 100 m in outdoor\nenvironments.\
    \ The ZigBee communication range can be extended by adopting multi-tire, ad-hoc,\n\
    decentralized, and mesh network topologies. Drones or UAV also can be used as\
    \ a mobile router\nnode to extend the communication range within a farm ﬁeld.\
    \ A drone could pass the collected\ndata from the sensor nodes to the master node\
    \ through multi-hop. However, using drones entails\nother challenges and limitations.\n\
    (3)\nPropagation losses:\nIn agricultural applications, WSNs must be able to work\
    \ in diverse\nsurroundings, such as ground, bare land, orchards, greenhouses,\
    \ farms, and complex topography;\nthey must also be able to operate in all climate\
    \ conditions. All these conditions inﬂuence the\nperformance of radio propagation.\
    \ Whether the topography is simple or complicated, the\ncommunication possibility\
    \ between the points in a WSN still suffers from serious challenges.\nThe signal\
    \ transmitted from the sensor nodes in agricultural applications need to pass\
    \ through a\nheavy crop canopy to arrive to at the receiver nodes, which cannot\
    \ ensure a sufﬁcient clearance\narea and will cause signal propagation absorption,\
    \ reﬂection, attenuation, and scattering. In\nthis case, the link quality is degraded,\
    \ especially when the signal spreads through dense crops.\nTherefore, when deploying\
    \ WSNs, communication link quality and temporal and spatial variables\nmust be\
    \ guaranteed. The communication performance of WSNs is related to the working\n\
    surroundings. Therefore, due to the limited resources and power budget of WSNs,\
    \ an accurate\nwireless channel path loss model must be adopted to reﬂect the\
    \ propagation features. This model\nis expected to demonstrate correct optimization\
    \ and network evaluation performance throughout\nthe deployment design process\
    \ to develop the energy efﬁciency of the nodes [15], improve the\ntarget detection\
    \ and localization applications [16], decrease the number of retransmission, and\n\
    ensure Quality of Service (QoS) of the network [175].\n(4)\nRouting: Different\
    \ problems can emerge due to packet collision and limited bandwidth, which\nare\
    \ introduced by channel propagation, and so on. Therefore, when a WSN is deployed\
    \ in a wide\narea in farm ﬁelds, multi-hop is required. Kim et al. [3] developed\
    \ an independent mobile robot\nplatform based on a mobility task for surveillance\
    \ to overcome channel interference.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n35 of 45\n(5)\nLocalization\
    \ and tracking: Tracking and localization of a herd of cattle are considered smart\
    \ farm\napplications based on WSNs. For example, a WSN can be employed to track\
    \ and localize of dairy\ncows to enable herd management. ZigBee wireless protocol\
    \ is used to monitor animal locations\nand behaviors, such as walking and standing,\
    \ lying down, and grazing [16,18]. In this context,\nseveral considerations, such\
    \ as radio interference, animal situation, and mobility, changes in\nWSN topology,\
    \ penetration depth of the signal through the animal body, height of the collar,\
    \ and\naccess point antennas, need to be taken into account [176]. These considerations\
    \ pose challenges\nin the localization and tracking of the animals.\n(6)\nReliability:\
    \ Agricultural monitoring systems based on different environmental sensors can\
    \ also\nbe used to monitor pollution aside from climate conditions. Important\
    \ information on climate\nconditions is reported to related agencies and farmers\
    \ from a remote location for advance\ninvestigations. Dangerous information needs\
    \ to be dealt with immediately in an emergency,\nwhich means that data transmission\
    \ in WSNs should demonstrate high reliability [3].\n(7)\nScalability: In agricultural\
    \ applications, the construction of WSN-based fault-tolerant and\nrobust hierarchical\
    \ architectures requires large-scale deployment relative to single-level network\n\
    architectures.\nA hierarchical architecture can be scaled up for developing applications\
    \ by\nduplicating to several ﬁelds. In this context, to increase the number of\
    \ WSNs over a vast area,\nmultiple wireless router nodes are placed in an agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld to guarantee sustained operation.\n(8)\nCost: The total hardware and software\
    \ costs of sensor nodes are important. The design of sensor\nnodes for any agricultural\
    \ application level must involve a low cost while demonstrating a robust\nperformance;\
    \ moreover, the design needs to be available for use by poor country markets [5].\n\
    This challenge can be overcome by reducing software and hardware costs further.\n\
    (9)\nReal time: Most crops are vulnerable to climate conditions, such as humidity,\
    \ intensity of\nillumination, and temperature. This vulnerability is a burden\
    \ to farmers who monitor changes\nin climate conditions hourly and/or daily because\
    \ doing so is labor-intensive. Moreover, in\ngreenhouses, a ﬁre can occur and\
    \ lead to severe agricultural disasters. This evidence suggests\nthat the monitoring\
    \ of the ecological conditions of agricultural WSNs needs to be in real time.\n\
    Real-time monitoring will enhance yield production and plant growth and avoid\
    \ dangerous\ndisasters in farms [3].\n(10) Storage and recording of data: Large\
    \ amounts of data are recorded from agriculture observing\nsystems because several\
    \ WSNs in agricultural applications contain several sensors for crop\ngrowth analysis\
    \ and harvesting estimation. This condition requires the base station to monitor\n\
    changes in farm ﬁelds by analyzing patterns. The base station must thus be supported\
    \ by a high\nstorage capacity.\n(11) Security: Security and protection are important\
    \ issues in agricultural products. Protection\nfrom insects or attacks of rodents\
    \ in grain stores or ﬁelds is essential. Such a challenge must\nbe considered\
    \ to maintain the security level of agriculture. Protection and security can be\n\
    achieved based on real-time analysis and processing of agricultural information\
    \ without human\nintrusion [159].\n(12) Delay tolerance: Critical delay poses\
    \ a challenge to agricultural applications. Some agricultural\napplications can\
    \ be considered as time sensitive, such as those used in farm ﬁre detection,\n\
    detection of exposure of crops to pests, cow heat event detection during milking,\
    \ and exposure of\ncattle to heat for a certain period. Such information must\
    \ be transmitted as fast as possible if the\ncritical issue is to be handled.\
    \ In such a case, a tradeoff between energy consumption and data\ntimelines is\
    \ necessary. By contrast, some agricultural applications are delay tolerant (i.e.,\
    \ time\ninsensitive), such as protein content, milk fat [177], gathering data\
    \ from soil and grass monitoring.\nWith delay tolerant approach, the short range\
    \ low power wireless protocols can be used [178].\nWhere the information of the\
    \ agricultural ﬁeld can be collected and transferred to the master\nnode or to\
    \ a cloud computing node using “messengers” e.g., a mobile node (mobile robot\
    \ or\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n36 of 45\nUAV). Consequently, the cost [179] and\
    \ the complexity of the agriculture WSN will be reduced\nand the lifetime will\
    \ be increased.\n(13) Fault tolerance: Fault tolerance is a crucial feature of\
    \ WSNs for succeeding PA. Several faults may\noccur in PA based on the WSN system,\
    \ which are (i) communication failure, (ii) faulty sensor\nsetting, (iii) sensor\
    \ component faults producing incorrect value, and (iv) node failure because of\n\
    exhausted battery or any other cause. Gutiérrez et al. [40] introduced communication\
    \ failure and\nnode fault tolerance for an irrigation system. If any fault occurs,\
    \ the irrigation system tracks the\ndefault irrigation program. The node energy\
    \ depletion failure was minimized in [1,40,180] by\nadopting solar-cell-powered\
    \ nodes. Data aggregation and topology control schemes are probable\nto be fault\
    \ tolerant for deploying sensor nodes in a vast area.\n(14) Data management: The\
    \ data management in agriculture poses a challenge because the large\namount of\
    \ data that can be collected from several sensors spread in agricultural ﬁeld,\
    \ especially\nwhen the agricultural data are intended to be connected to the cloud.\
    \ Determination of the\n(i) data analysis method, (ii) data collection schemes,\
    \ (iii) sensor types, (iv) semantic sensor\nnetworking, (v) big data, and (vi)\
    \ complex event processing enables the designer to manage\nthese crucial aspects.\
    \ The integration of IoT and software-deﬁned network also introduces a\npromising\
    \ and new methodology in deployment, monitoring, and design of network services\n\
    and resources [181].\n(15) Heterogeneous sensors: Integration of wired and wireless\
    \ heterogeneous sensors into information\nplatforms to perform interoperability\
    \ pose challenges in PA. Chen et al. [152] proposed “web\nservice-enabled cyber-physical\
    \ infrastructure” to solve this issue. The proposed system was able\nto integrate,\
    \ process, acquire, and distribute surveillance data from different physical sensors\n\
    spread in the PA system over the Internet. The infrastructure was executed to\
    \ serve as an\narchitecture middleware between PA clients and heterogeneous sensors.\n\
    6. Conclusions\nA review of WSN-based agricultural applications was presented.\
    \ A comparison was conducted\namong different wireless technologies or protocols,\
    \ such as WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, GPRS/3G/4G,\nLoRa, and SigFox. The comparison\
    \ results revealed that the ZigBee and LoRa wireless protocols are\nmore convenient\
    \ for agricultural applications than the others because of its low power consumption\n\
    and suitable communication range for ZigBee and long for LoRa. A classiﬁcation\
    \ of energy-efﬁcient\ntechniques or algorithms and energy-harvesting techniques\
    \ was also provided. Based on the presented\ntaxonomy, we show that signiﬁcant\
    \ types of energy-efﬁcient and energy-harvesting techniques\ncan be used in the\
    \ agriculture domain. Previous research was also investigated and compared\nto\
    \ explore the current problems in agricultural applications based on WSNs and\
    \ obtain optimum\nsolutions for maintaining system performance. Challenges and\
    \ limitations were introduced for\ndesign considerations in the future. The state-of-the-art\
    \ approaches of IoT in agricultural applications\nwere reviewed and compared to\
    \ explore various sensors, actuators, devices, IoT platforms, and\napplication\
    \ layers.\nAcknowledgments: The authors would like to thank Al-Raﬁdain University\

    and content Abstract Availability of fresh water is one of the elementary conditions
    for life on Earth, however, water is a limited resource, which is now under an
    unprecedented pressure by global population growth, climate change and demand
    from several economic sectors such as tourism, industry, and agriculture. In particular,
    irrigated agriculture is one of the major water-consuming sectors. The aforementioned
    issues justify the need for a sustainable and rational use of water in irrigated
    crops, which motivates the implementation of new precise automatic irrigation
    technologies based on control theory. In this paper, we introduce the main concepts
    of control theory, how can it be applied to irrigation and a literature review
    of automatic irrigation control systems over the last decade. In addition, we
    present our latest developments in this field. In particular, we present some
    promising preliminary experimental results of four different control strategies
    applied to fruit trees in southern Spain to show the potential of the application
    of control techniques to irrigation. Highlights ► We introduce the main concepts
    of control theory. ► We show how can it be applied to irrigation. ► We show a

    management Water is a scarce resource (Clothier, 2008), and its rational use is
    compulsory. Problems derived from lack of water will likely increase if long-term
    predictions on global climate change are right. Meteorological records suggest
    significant increases in temperature and decreases in annual precipitation, which
    will entail a reduction of the available water resources of the XXI century (Turral
    et al., 2011). Industry and tourism, among other productive activities, compete
    for this resource increasing its profitability and productivity. Nowadays, the
    economic sector that most fresh water consumes is agriculture: ca. 70% of the
    total resources, against the 20% used by industry and the 10% for domestic use
    (UN, 2009). In addition, considering the expected increase in world population
    (UN, 2008), it is urgent to find solutions to ensure enough food supply. This
    can be only achieved by increasing the world agricultural yield and water productivity,
    mainly from the irrigated areas as suggested by the aforementioned data. Archaeological
    discoveries have identified evidence of irrigation since ancient times. A form
    of water management called basin irrigation began at about the same time in Egypt
    and Mesopotamia ca. 8000 years ago (Taylor and Ashcroft, 1972), using the water
    of the flooding Nile or Tigris/Euphrates rivers. A more rational approach for
    optimizing irrigation is the use of automatic irrigation controllers. Automatic
    control has been applied in almost all engineering fields with great success;
    see Bennett (1996) for a brief history of automatic control, although the impact
    in agriculture, and in particular in precision irrigation, is limited. The key
    idea behind automatic control is the use of feedback. Feedback is a mechanism,
    process or signal that is looped back to control a system within itself. In the
    field of automatic irrigation, measurements of soil, plant and atmosphere variables
    related to the plant water status can provide the information of the consequences
    of previous actions to calculate the next irrigation dose. 1.2. Control theory
    Control theory is an interdisciplinary subfield of science that deals with influencing
    the behavior of dynamical systems. In general, when one or more output variables
    of a system need to follow a certain reference over time, a controller acts on
    the inputs to the system to obtain the desired effect on the outputs. A primitive
    way to implement control is the so called open-loop control (Fig. 1A), in which
    no measurements of the system outputs are used to modify the inputs; that is,
    no feedback is used. In this class of controllers, the decisions are taken a priory
    based on heuristics, expert knowledge or a model of the system. A particular case
    of open-loop is the feed-forward strategy (Fig. 1B), in which the controllers
    use known or estimated values of future disturbances to compensate their effects
    in advance. The main drawback of open-loop controllers is that they are not able
    to react to changes in the actual disturbances or in the system. Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. The three types of control systems: (A) open loop, (B)
    feed-forward, and (C) feedback (closed loop). In closed-loop controllers (Fig.
    1C), feedback is used to avoid the problems of open-loop controllers; that is,
    controllers use the information of the consequences of previous actions to calculate
    the next action. In this case, appropriate sensors are needed to close the loop.
    Feedback control can be said to have originated with the float valve regulators
    of the Hellenic and Arab worlds (Mayr, 1975), however it does not appear to have
    spread to medieval Europe. It seems rather to have been reinvented during the
    industrial revolution, where level, temperature and finally Watt''s centrifugal
    governor where developed (Dickinson and Jenkins, 1927). The first control strategies
    were based on an on-off control, consisting on switching the controller output
    between maximum and minimum output according to the sign of the error (Fig. 2).
    This is for example, the operating principle of some clepsydra (Mayr, 1975). Most
    on–off systems operate with a relatively large cycle time and deviation. A long
    cycle time gives rise to large deviations in the controlled variable, whereas
    a short cycle time may cause excessive wear on the relays, actuators, etc. Thus
    there is a trade-off between cycle time and deviation. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Response of an on-off controller to a saw-tooth error (the control
    input u switches between two values based on the sign of the error e). Modern
    industry has been extensively relying on automated control systems. This realization
    has motivated extensive research, over the last fifty years, on the development
    of advanced model based operation and control strategies to achieve safe, environmentally
    friendly and economically optimal plant operation. Classical control systems,
    like proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control, utilize measurements of a
    single output variable (e.g., temperature, pressure, level, or product species
    concentration) to compute the control action needed to be implemented by a control
    actuator so that this output variable can be regulated at a desired set-point
    value. In a PID controller, the control signal is generated as a weighted sum
    of three terms: the error between the variable and the set-point, the integral
    of recent errors, and the rate by which the error has been changing. The effect
    of changing the weight of the three terms is summarized in Table 1. This class
    of controllers does not need a model of the system controlled; they are only based
    on the information gathered by the sensors. Control systems should be evaluated
    for their efficiency in pursuing the target but, in general, control laws can
    be potentially improved by including a good model of the system, the so-called
    model based strategies (Pannocchia et al., 2005). Table 1. Summary of PID control
    actions (Love, 2007). Action Change Effect P Increase controller gain (KC) Increases
    sensitivity Reduces offset Makes response more oscillatory System becomes less
    stable I Reduce reset time (TR) Eliminates offset faster Increases amplitude of
    oscillations Settling time becomes longer Response becomes more sluggish System
    becomes more unstable D Reduce rate time (TD) Stabilizes system Reduces settling
    time Speeds up response Amplifies noise It is important to remark that automatic
    control is a vast discipline and an exhaustive review is beyond the scope of this
    paper. An introduction to process automation can be found in Love (2007), which
    covers a wide range of topics from instrumentation and control systems to advanced
    control technologies such as fuzzy logic control, artificial neural networks,
    genetic algorithms, model predictive control and nonlinear control, which we briefly
    describe next. A fuzzy control system is a control system based on fuzzy logic,
    i.e. a mathematical system that analyzes analog input values in terms of logical
    variables that take on continuous values between 0 and 1, in contrast to classical
    or digital logic, which operates on discrete values of either 1 or 0 (true or
    false respectively). Fig. 3 shows an example of how fuzzy could interpret temperature
    ranges. The figure shows three different membership functions, which provide a
    value between 0 and 1 that measures the degree of belonging of a temperature (x
    axis) to a given set (cold, warm, hot). Note that these functions always sum 1,
    and that there are temperatures that have a nonzero membership value for more
    than one set. Fuzzy logic is widely used in machine control. The logic involved
    can deal with fuzzy concepts, which cannot be expressed as “true” or “false” but
    rather as “partially true”. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Fuzzy
    logic interpretation of temperature ranges. A neural network is a powerful data
    modeling tool that is able to capture and represent complex input/output relationships.
    Fig. 4 shows the elements of a multilayer neural network. Each node of the graph
    represents a function (usually a Gaussian function) of his inputs (the incoming
    arrows). The weighted output of each node may be the inputs of other nodes, often
    organized as layers, or the output of the neural network. Different weights provide
    different results. This structure allows for a very flexible representation of
    nonlinear functions. The weights are chosen based on a sequence of inputs and
    desired outputs (often denoted as training). The motivation for the development
    of neural network technology stemmed from the desire to develop an artificial
    system that could perform “intelligent” tasks similar to those performed by the
    human brain. The advantage of neural networks lies in their ability to represent
    both linear and non-linear relationships and in their ability to learn these relationships
    directly from the data being modeled. Traditional linear models are simply inadequate
    when it comes to modeling data that contains non-linear characteristics. Thus,
    neural networks are not really a class of controllers, but a modeling framework
    which can be used in advanced model based controllers. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 4. Multilayer neural network with two inputs and one output. Each node
    represents a function, and each arrow a signal. In this figure, the width of the
    arrows is proportional to his weight in the function. Genetic algorithms are a
    class of search techniques inspired from the biological process of evolution by
    means of natural selection. They can be used to construct numerical optimization
    techniques that perform robustly on problem characterized by ill-behaved search
    spaces. In a genetic algorithm, a population of strings (called chromosomes or
    the genotype of the genome), which encode candidate solutions (called individuals,
    creatures, or phenotypes) to an optimization problem, evolves toward better solutions.
    Fig. 5 shows a diagram of a general genetic algorithm. The solutions are denoted
    chromosomes. The algorithm relies on a function that provides the utility of a
    chromosome (determine the fitness) which allows one to discard at each iteration
    of the algorithm (generation) the solutions with a lower utility. With this set
    of solutions, a new set is obtained by mixing (crossover) and updating (mutation)
    the chromosomes. The algorithm stops after a given number of iterations or after
    a given condition is satisfied. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Diagram
    of a general genetic algorithm. Model predictive control (MPC) originated in the
    late seventies and has developed considerably since then. This class of control
    strategy is based on the use of a model to predict the mathematical evolution
    of the system, on the minimization of a cost function based on this prediction
    and on the use of a receding horizon strategy (Camacho and Bordons, 2004). When
    the controller must take a control decision, an open-loop optimal control problem
    is solved based on a model of the system. From the optimal trajectory, only the
    first decision is applied, repeating the procedure when new measurements are available,
    hence, introducing feedback in order to compensate for possible disturbances and
    model discrepancies (Fig. 6). The various MPC algorithms differ in the class of
    models used to represent the system and the cost function to be minimized. There
    are multiple industrial applications because of the ability of MPC designs to
    yield high performance control systems capable of operating without expert intervention
    for long periods of time (Morari, 1999). Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    6. Basic working principles of model predictive control: reference, predicted
    output and manipulated input trajectory (decision variable). In general, there
    is a wide set of results in control theory for systems that can be described using
    linear models (both continuous and discrete time). Although there are few pure
    linear systems, linear approximations can be used to operate in certain conditions,
    however, in certain cases, these approximations do not yield appropriate results
    and more precise non-linear models have to be used. Nonlinear control theory (Khalil,
    1992) deals with systems that are nonlinear, time-variant, or both. After this
    brief review of control theory, we present next (Section 1.3) some general ideas
    about how to apply it for automatic irrigation purposes. 1.3. Applicability of
    control theory to irrigation practices In general, automatic control has been
    seldom used in irrigation. The commercial solutions available on the market require
    the irrigation dose to be provided by the user. Only then, they are able to switch
    on/off the irrigation pump and to open or close the valves to apply the irrigation
    doses to every sector of the orchard. A popular irrigation technique to calculate
    the irrigation dose is based on a feed-forward strategy, which consists on applying
    irrigation to refill the water used by the plants the previous day, using crop
    potential evapotranspiration (ETc) or changes in the soil water content. This
    method is in fact an open-loop controller and, therefore, it presents some limitations
    that can be overcome by the use of feedback, mathematical models and additional
    information provided by plant measurements. There are several commercial automatic
    controllers (Acclima, Watermark, Rain bird, Water Watcher) that regulate soil
    water content (SWC) based on sensor measurements, and hence operating as closed-loop
    controllers. These controllers apply irrigation when sensors detect that the measurements
    are below a certain predefined threshold until another predefined threshold is
    overcome (on–off control). This reference is in general established as a constant
    value (i.e. 80% of field capacity, or a relative ratio of the readily available
    water). These commercial systems have been compared by Cardenas-Lailhacar et al.,
    2008, Cardenas-Lailhacar et al., 2010 concluding that, when adequate threshold
    are defined, all these systems have the potential to save water when compared
    to a traditional time-based irrigation treatment. The authors also showed that,
    even under dry weather conditions, the incorporation of rain sensors as a feed-forward
    can save substantial amounts of irrigation water. The application of a PID strategy,
    as that mentioned in Section 1.2, has not yet been extensively considered in commercial
    controllers and could be applied not only to follow a constant reference soil
    water content value as abovementioned, but also to follow an optimal soil water
    content trajectory related to the plant water needs. In general, it can be hard
    to find a SWC trajectory to maximize the standard objectives (yield, water use
    efficiency, farm profit). Including plant variables as feedback signals could
    improve the performance of these controllers since these measurements involve
    the response of the plant to changes in soil and atmosphere. Another advantage
    of these variables is that they are closer to the objectives previous mentioned.
    An adequate planning of any control strategy should distinguish between the choice
    of the control system, the choice of the targets (variables to be controlled),
    and the choice of the variables measured or estimated in the control system to
    achieve that the targets meet the objectives. In general, any measurement or estimation
    in the soil–plant–atmosphere system could be used as a target or as an intermediate
    variable in the control strategy. Main irrigation scheduling approaches are based
    on one or a combination of the followings: soil water measurements (soil water
    content or soil water potential), soil water balance calculations (using estimations
    of evaporation and rainfall) and plant-based measurements (tissue water status,
    stomatal conductance, sap flow sensors, dendrometry, etc.). A detailed comparison
    of all these variables is beyond the scope of this paper but an excellent review
    can be found in Jones (2004). The author concludes that an important advantage
    of plant-based measurements is their greater relevance to the plant functioning
    than soil-based measurements, but the practical difficulties of implementation
    have still limited their use by the farmers. An important effort should be tackle
    to reduce these difficulties. In general, a more complete solution to the irrigation
    control problem should come from using a combination of all the previous ideas:
    feed-forward, feedback and mathematical models, considering relevant variables
    in every part of the soil–plant–atmosphere system (Fig. 7). In addition, advanced
    control laws such as the ones described in Section 1.2 could be considered for
    irrigation control applications. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Variables
    that can be used for automatic irrigation control. For example, in agricultural
    applications, neural networks and fuzzy models have the potential to be used to
    model complex systems and predict future disturbances such as weather conditions
    or water demand. Fuzzy logic has the advantage that the solution to the problem
    can be cast in terms that human operators can understand, so that their experience
    can be used in the design of the controller. This makes it easier to mechanize
    tasks that are already successfully performed by humans, which is in fact the
    case of agricultural irrigation. In addition, genetic algorithms can be applied
    to solve decision problems based on high complexity models of the soil–plant–atmosphere
    continuum. With respect to MPC, there are few agricultural applications (mainly
    for regulating weather conditions in controlled environments such as greenhouses)
    because it is difficult to obtain precise models appropriate for control purposes;
    however, it is a promising methodology for the design of irrigation controllers.
    We will review some of these applications in the next section. To the best of
    our knowledge, advanced automatic irrigation controllers have not yet been commercialized.
    In particular, we have not found commercial automatic irrigation controllers using
    plant measurements as a feedback. Furthermore, the actual irrigation controllers
    have not still adopted more advanced control laws apart of the basic on/off threshold
    strategy. In the following section, we review the main scientific contributions
    to this field over the last decade. 2. Research on automatic irrigation control:
    state of the art Although the first papers reporting ingenious automatic irrigation
    devices, such as the one based on the air-lift principle hydraulic equilibrium
    (Chapman and Liebig, 1938) or on solenoid valves activated by custom sensors detecting
    soil water content deficits (Bouyoucos, 1952); date back to the middle of previous
    century, there has been an increasing interest of the scientific community in
    this problem over the last years. We present next a review of the contributions
    that deal not only on how to apply a particular irrigation dose efficiently, but
    on how to decide the dose in order to optimize the water usage and crop objectives.
    The application of process control techniques to variable-rate irrigation has
    been recently reviewed in McCarthy et al. (2011) and we strongly recommend its
    reading to get a complementary view of the subject of this paper. Most of the
    papers reporting automatic irrigation controllers in the last decade (Table 2)
    focus on regulating SWC or soil water tension (SWT) with on/off strategies based
    on feedback (Luthra et al., 1997, Miranda et al., 2005, Cáceres et al., 2007,
    Boutraa et al., 2011). These devices are relatively inexpensive and easy to use,
    but ground water measurements imply certain limitations: they require a large
    number of sensors and do not take into account the plant status and response.

    and Evett (2010) and Peters and Evett (2008), irrigation controllers aimed at
    regulating canopy temperature instead of SWC were proposed. Both SWC and canopy
    temperatures feedback strategies were compared in Abraham et al. (2000) and Evett
    et al. (2000). Xinjian (2011) and Zhu and Li (2011) have recently reported irrigation
    controllers which uses a combination of SWC and weather data to control drip irrigation.
    Xinjian''s fuzzy logic controller measured air temperature, light intensity and
    SWC and was tested in vineyard''s drip irrigation. The Zhu and Li''s controller
    used air temperature, humidity, evaporation, rain and SWC measurements. They applied
    state space analysis methods to implement the irrigation control based on a knowledge
    base and an expert system rule base. Protocols for automatic irrigation controllers
    have been reported based on trunk diameter variation (Goldhamer and Fereres, 2004,
    Garcia-Orellana et al., 2007) or sap flow measurements (Fernandez et al., 2001,
    Fernandez et al., 2008a). Both methods are considered having a great potential
    for irrigation control (Fereres et al., 2003, Jones, 2004). The advances in wireless
    technology have encouraged the application of wireless sensors and/or actuators
    in irrigation control or monitoring experiments. Depending on distance or power
    requirements consideration, a wide range of communication protocols can be applied
    like WHF (Zhu and Li, 2011), Zigbee (Zhou et al., 2009, Xinjian, 2011) and others.
    In particular Zigbee protocol is becoming a popular standard for agricultural
    environments since it is low power consumer and therefore the communication with
    standalone sensors can be powered with small solar panels or even only batteries.
    Recently, there has been an increasing interest on developing mathematical models
    representing both, the dynamics of water in the soil–plant–atmosphere (SPA) system
    and crop performance. Using these models is now possible to test automatic irrigation
    controllers in computer simulations prior to their use in field experiments. Among
    the most popular models are WAVE (Vanclooster et al., 1994), SPASMO (Green, 2001),
    SWAP (van Dam, 2000, van Dam et al., 2008), MACRO (Larsbo and Jarvis, 2003), CROPGRO
    (Boote et al., 1998), WOFOST (van Diepen et al., 1989) and DSSAT (Hoogenboom et
    al., 2004). Model based controllers such as model predictive control (MPC) can
    use this knowledge to optimize irrigation, also including estimation of future
    changes or disturbances on the systems (e.g., weather forecast). These controllers,
    although successfully and extensively used in other areas of science and industry,
    see for example Astrom and Hagglund (2006) and Camacho and Bordons (2004), have
    been seldom applied in agriculture. However, we might find promising examples,
    especially in the management of greenhouses environmental control (Rodriguez et
    al., 2008, Piñon et al., 2005, El Ghoumari et al., 2005). Park et al. (2009) applied
    a receding horizon control scheme in a center pivot system. It demonstrated to
    be a viable strategy for achieving water reuse and agricultural objectives while
    minimizing negative impacts on environmental quality. 3. Recent results Our group
    has been working over the last 4 years in developing and testing new irrigation
    control strategies applied to fruit orchards growing in the south-west of Spain.
    We present next some promising preliminary experimental results of four different
    control strategies to show the potential of the application of control techniques
    to irrigation. Further details of these experiments can be found in Romero (2011)
    and the specific references included in this section. One of the most innovative
    and promising approaches for the automation of irrigation is based on the measurement
    of sap flow in conductive organs of a plant. We have developed an automatic irrigation
    controller based on sap flow measurements (Fernandez et al., 2008a, Fernandez
    et al., 2008b, Fernandez et al., 2008c). The system was used to daily irrigate
    mature olive trees using an irrigation dose estimated from sap flow measurements
    in the trunk of representative trees. A proper application of this approach requires
    sensors that can reliably measure broad ranges of sap flow. Most of the commercially
    available sensors work well in rather restrictive ranges, i.e. they are not reliable
    in the case of very low or very high sap flows. We have developed and evaluated
    two new methods for measuring sap flow, capable of a measurement range wider than
    those of most current methods, and suitable for the measurement of reverse flows
    (Romero et al., 2012). This is of great interest for the study of phenomena related
    to hydraulic lift in the root system of fruit trees. In another line of research,
    our group have also implemented and tested a second irrigation controller, using
    a combination of feed-forward and feedback strategies based on weather and soil
    moisture measurements (Romero et al., 2009, Fernandez et al., 2010). This controller
    has been evaluated in an almond orchard, demonstrating to be useful in reducing
    water losses by drainage, evaporation and runoff. Following the approach suggested
    in Section 1.3, we tested a PID strategy (Romero, 2011) regulating SWC (Fig. 8)
    on the hardware and software platform described by Romero et al. (2009) and Fernandez
    et al. (2010). After only 1 day, the set point was achieved and remained in ±5%
    set point bounds. During these periods of time, the irrigation controller operated
    in a fully autonomous manner, compensating weather conditions without any external
    information or forecast. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 8. Temporal
    evolution of (A) the soil water content (SWC, A) and (B) the irrigation amounts
    (IA) and potential evapotranspiration (ETo) when a PID irrigation controller is
    applied. An alternative to the PID technique is to use the knowledge of the system''s
    dynamics to develop model-based controllers such as model predictive control (MPC).
    For this purpose we developed a simplified soil–plant–atmosphere-model suitable
    for this technique (Romero, 2011). The model was identified and validated with
    field experiments in the almond orchard described by Romero et al. (2009) and
    Fernandez et al. (2010). This model was used not only for MPC design but also
    to test the performance of the controller in computer simulations (Romero, 2011).
    Fig. 9A shows the trajectories of the SWC in the root zone (SWC1) and the references
    (set point) for the MPC and the PID simulations in the no-precipitation scenario.
    MPC reached the reference in the first day of simulation and remained closer to
    the reference for the rest of the test. From the analysis of the irrigation trajectories
    (Fig. 9B) is also clear that the MPC change more often and react to the errors
    introduced by the variable weather changes (ETo). Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 9. Comparing soil water content trajectories (A) and irrigation amounts
    (B) of the MPC and PID controllers assuming no precipitations. DOY = day of year.
    In Fig. 10, MPC and PID are compared in the presence of precipitation events which
    can be predicted. Fig. 10A shows the corresponding SWC trajectories along with
    the daily precipitation values. In this scenario, MPC advantages are even more
    evident and again MPC was able to improve the control respect to the PID. Set
    point was achieved faster with the MPC, and SWC remained closer to the reference.
    The differences were especially significant in the beginning of the simulation
    and after the precipitation events. This was because the controller was able to
    adapt the irrigation needs in advance with the precipitation predictions. Note
    from the irrigation trajectories graph (Fig. 10B) that the MPC reduced irrigation
    from DOY 31, four days before the high precipitations occur (DOY 35), taking into
    account that there would be an excess of water inflow in the incoming days. On
    the contrary, PID controller reacted later, reducing irrigation from DOY 36. MPC
    was also able to increase irrigation (from DOY 44) three days before the PID controller
    did, predicting the future water inflow deficit after the precipitations period.

    (A) and irrigation amounts (B) of the MPC and PID controllers assuming precipitation
    events. DOY = day of year. All these results suggest that advanced strategies
    could improve the localized irrigation of fruit orchards in our region. To take
    advantage of the SPA models that are been improved day by day, we particularly
    suggest more research and field test of MPC, adding weather forecast and deficit
    irrigation knowledge. 4. Conclusions Optimizing water usage in irrigated crops
    has received a lot of attention from the scientific community. The use of advanced
    control techniques is a promising possibility. The results reported in the literature
    show that the use of these tools may have a major impact on improving the irrigation
    systems and the efficient use of the water resources. Unfortunately, these results
    have not yet been adopted by manufactures and farmers. A greater effort must be
    done to demonstrate the advantages of these advances irrigation techniques (yield
    and water use efficiency, robustness, accuracy) in order to boost the commercialization
    of new products which will lead to a more sustainable and rational use of water.

    Get rights and content Highlights • Conceptual map for promoting the cyberisation
    of SPVWPS is presented. • Distributed-architecture based system for remote management
    of SPVWPS is developed. • The real-time system is resilient, responsive and able
    to recover from failure. Recently, several works have been focused on designing
    and optimising the use of Agricultural Cyber-Physical System (ACPS). Therefore,
    a variety of ACPSs has been developed for the management of different services
    in precision agriculture. In this context, we present a new approach to the cyberisation
    of solar photovoltaic water systems (SPVWS) for remote irrigation management.
    A typical ACPS architecture design is adopted and extended to support the solar
    irrigation facility. The distributed architecture is based on the client–server
    paradigm using Vert.x as a reactive platform, which guarantees a bi-directional
    communication between the operational level deployed in the greenhouse and the
    supervisory level hosted in the cloud. The operational level deploys embedded
    devices which host a set of event-driven components responsible for transmitting
    external resources data, handling notifications, and executing orders provided
    at the supervisory level. The cloud incorporates several reactive micro-services
    performing advanced analyses and data mining in order to support remote control
    tasks. Within this architecture, users with different roles can remotely monitor
    and manage the activities of the SPVWS. A successful case study of an experimental
    greenhouse demonstrated the feasibility of the approach in term of low-cost and
    good performance in task management. Previous article in issue Next article in

    architecture 1. Introduction Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are interconnected
    systems of physical, autonomous and intelligent components able to monitor and
    interact with physical entities by managing data flow and operations (Lee, 2010,
    Molina and Jacob, 2017). The CPSs have been applied in a wide range of domains
    including industrial control systems and factory automation, energy production
    and management, traffic control and transportation systems, public safety, healthcare
    and assisted living applications, food control and precision agriculture (Chen,
    2017, Suprem et al., 2013, Törngren et al., 2017). The CPSs demonstrate their
    capability to enhance the performance obtained by simple recent embedded systems
    and introduce a new class of collaborative systems. The collaborative aspect results
    from the introduction of the new concept of managing the interactions between
    the acquisition and control worlds. This challenge is deeply linked to the smooth
    integration of sensing technologies, internet of things and cloud computing supported
    by communication infrastructures (Hehenberger et al., 2016). Therefore, the implementation
    of CPSs introduces several improvements regarding control issues by increasing
    capability and efficiency, scalability and adaptability, autonomy and reliability,
    resilience, safety, and security. In addition, these systems are designed to meet
    the needs of end users by improving the reliability and robustness of communications
    while ensuring ease of use by adopting powerful and ingenious graphical interfaces.
    Agricultural cyber-physical systems (ACPSs) are the agricultural scenario applications
    of the CPSs. The applications are based on advanced electronic technologies and
    agricultural facilities to build integrated farm management systems that are able
    to interact with the physical environment in order to maintain ideal environmental
    values. They are expected to be able to gather the essential and appropriate information
    about climate, soil and crops, with high accuracy. The gathered data are used
    to manage the external resources such as watering, humidity, plant health etc.
    Several studies have been conducted on designing ACPS models based on the CPS
    design technology. For instance, the Cropinfra project is based on a multi-layered
    service framework consisting of sub-services such as data collection, machine
    control, data storing, and external services, which could be used as an internet-based
    assisting services in precision farming management (Pesonen et al., 2014). Nie,
    Sun, and Li (2014) presented an architecture that includes three layers and could
    be used for different agricultural services while Oliveira, Leitão, Nabais, Ascenso,
    and Galvão (2016) presented a new energy and environment model for greenhouse
    systems which could be used in order to enhance energy efficiency and environmental
    sustainability. Also, a typical architecture for ACPSs involves the optimisation
    of sensor deployment as presented by An et al. (2017). Different agricultural
    information systems have been developed for remote monitoring of environmental
    parameters both outdoors and indoors. For instance, open geospatial web services
    have been integrated within an infrastructure that serves as a middleware system
    between heterogeneous sensors and remote clients (Chen, Zhang, & Wang, 2015).
    Open source hardware and open systems have been used to develop an accurate tracking
    system, through a mobile application, of environmental and land policy, which
    could be profitable in poor rural areas (Mesas-Carrascosa, VerdúSantano, Meroño,
    Sánchez de la Orden, & García-Ferrer, 2015). A dedicated system for a smart monitoring
    of the potato crop status has been developed with the intention to support farmers
    to take more suitable actions during the production phase (Rad, Hancu, Takacs,
    & Olteanu, 2015). The internet of things (IoT) is a very promising technology
    that could be combined with other technologies to provide many beneficial agricultural
    solutions (Kumar and Mahesh, 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Besides remote monitoring
    features, other works have investigated the ACPS design to deal with remote controls
    in precision agriculture. For instance, Fernández, Sánchez, Álvarez, López, and
    Iborra (2017) investigated a Teleo-Reactive paradigm to design a multi-agent architecture,
    while Cimino et al. (2016) adopted the ad-hoc design with open source features
    to develop a low cost-solution which could be profitable for small size companies.
    In addition, Dong, Vuran, and Irmak (2013) combined a centre pivot (CP) irrigation
    system with wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs) in order to develop an
    autonomous precision irrigation solution called WUSA-CP. The WUSA-CP aims to provide
    autonomous irrigation management to control a CP using the real-time soil information
    gathered from WUSN. Finally, Gonzalez-de-Soto, Emmi, Perez-Ruiz, Aguera, and Gonzalez-de-Santos
    (2016) developed an autonomous system for precise spraying by exploiting various
    technologies including satellite and geographic information systems, vision systems,
    remote sensors and embedded devices. Beyond these works, the application of ACPSs
    in precision agriculture is seen as a promising and effective solution for advanced
    production efficiency and sustainable development. However, deploying real-life
    applications of such systems is not an easily accomplished task given the fact
    that it necessitates proper hardware and software. Moreover, ACPSs need to be
    engineered with particular attention to autonomy, robustness, and resilience in
    order to handle the unpredictability of environment and the uncertainty of the
    characteristics of agricultural facilities. Another critical issue in running
    ACPSs is the energy for powering systems and this factor becomes crucial in the
    context of isolated areas. Therefore, focussing new research on exploiting renewable
    energy sources, especially solar sources, to power such systems would be promising,
    interesting and beneficial for precision agriculture. The solar photovoltaic water
    system (SPVWS) has been recognised as an emerging technology with great challenges
    in the conversion of solar energy as power supply for water pumps. In order to
    expedite the integration of SPWSS in precise agriculture, some works focused on
    developing methods, tools, and hardware along with software components. For instance,
    Deveci, Onkol, Unver, and Ozturk (2015) used the system modelling language to
    design a simple solution, while Kabalci, Kabalci, Canbaz, and Calpbinici (2016)
    integrated a remote control infrastructure that uses GSM network to develop an
    advanced, complete system that supports remote monitoring. However, we believe
    that expanding SPVWS into the ACPS concept would help to improve profitable energy
    systems with an autonomous behaviour. It is a challenge of incorporating photovoltaic
    facility along with computing and remote services using existing sensing platforms.
    With this aim, this paper introduces a new approach of cyberisation of SPVWS.
    Through this cyberisation, significant design and optimisation considerations
    were adopted in order to integrate photovoltaic facilities into the ACPS architecture.
    The implementation of the system is based on a new client–server paradigm and
    uses low-cost components and open sources features. All figures were produced
    using the free yEd Graph editor (yWorks – The Diagramming Company, 2017). 2. System
    architecture design 2.1. ACPS architecture An et al. (2017) have introduced a
    typical architecture for ACPSs which includes four parts that are sensor and sink
    node, network, control centre and farming facility as shown in Fig. 1. Sensor
    nodes will be stationed in the agricultural system to gather physical or environmental
    information. Sink node manages the information traffic between sensor nodes and
    the remote control centre through the network. Download : Download high-res image

    agriculture cyber-physical system. The remote control centre hosts the processing
    unit that is able to store the collected data from local sites and perform further
    analyses in order to make appropriate decisions concerning the evaluation of the
    commands that will be directed to the equivalent farming facility. Modern farming
    facilities such as fertilising, irrigating, insecticide spraying etc are typically
    equipped with specific control systems that are ready to receive and execute remote
    supervisory command orders. Based on the architecture described above, we present
    the design and a real-life implementation of an ACPS-enabled for solar photovoltaic
    water systems. 2.2. System conception As introduced by Makonin, Bartram, and Popowich
    (2013) for smart home and Fernández et al. (2017) for precision farming, the first
    step in the cyberisation of SPVWS consists of presenting concept maps of relevant
    factors of the system as shown in Fig. 2. The conception involves operational
    components of SPVWPS, internal and external context and the interactions between
    them. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download full-size image

    Chandel, Nagaraju Naik, and Chandel (2015) and Sontake and Kalamkar (2016) summarised
    a variety of working technologies and classifications of SPVWS which includes
    different components related to different areas namely mechanical, electrical,
    electronic, computer, control and civil engineering. Autonomous SPVWS based on
    programmed automation will be able to control soil moisture through the scheduling
    of irrigation tasks. The scheduling involves managing the feedback provided by
    automatic decision-making and human intervention. Several technologies could be
    used to develop the autonomous behaviour of systems with the ability to support
    various kinds of management of irrigation tasks, including monitor and control
    (local, remote, and central). Effective implementations require the proper operation
    of several devices (sensors, pumps, and microcontroller) and integration of newly
    available services (internet of things and cloud computing). Additionally, irrigation
    task scheduling is deeply linked to the agricultural system context. Thus, the
    decision-making level of such automatic systems is based not only on the input
    values obtained inside the agricultural system (climate parameters and operational
    resources levels) but also on the actual weather and environment conditions. 2.3.
    Case study The agricultural system used as support for this study is an experimental
    greenhouse located at the laboratory of Electronic, Automatic and Biotechnology
    of the Faculty of Sciences, Moulay Ismaïl University, which is equipped with an
    SPVWS as shown in Fig. 3. The single wall polyethene greenhouse presented in Fig.
    3a has been the focus of several research studies (Ed-Dahhak et al., 2013, El
    Afou et al., 2014, Guerbaoui et al., 2013, Oubehar et al., 2016, Outanoute et
    al., 2016, Outanoute et al., 2015, Rahali et al., 2012). These contributions deal
    with the integration of intelligent artificial algorithms in the fields of climatic
    parameter control and irrigation management. The crops used during the experimentation
    are the umbrella variety of Schefflera, which are medium light houseplants and
    easy to maintain. The crops are arranged in pots along two rows oriented perpendicular
    to the vent direction (north–south). To water properly, it is recommended to wait
    for the soil in the pot to dry before thoroughly soaking the soil. The pots contain
    the Hamri soil type which is a light reddish siliceous soil with low moisture
    retention. This type of soil is found throughout the Saïs Plain which is a vast
    fertile plain located in the north of Morocco, between the mountains of the Rif
    and the Middle Atlas. The Saïs Plain includes two imperial and central cities
    of Morocco, namely Fez in the east and Meknes in the west. In particular, Meknes
    relies more on the agricultural sector as the main economic activity and produces
    good yields of olive, orange, cereals, grape and various vegetables. Download

    Experimental greenhouse: a) Single wall greenhouse, b) Battery coupled SPVWS.
    The irrigation station is a two-stage on-line drip irrigation system. The first
    stage includes an electric pump, a filtration system, a flow indicator, a bladder
    tank and an automatically-controlled valve regulator (Ed-Dahhak et al., 2013).
    This stage is used to pump water from a well into an experimental tank. The second
    stage consists of the SPVWS shown in Fig. 3b. It is a battery-coupled architecture
    without a tracking system and includes a solar pump. The PV generator is composed
    of two parallel sets of series and parallel PV arrays of MP190WP mono-crystalline
    solar panels from SN Solartechnics International AG (Hamburg, Germany), where
    each individual set is linked to a charge controller. Each charge controller is
    used to adjust the current and voltage of the solar panels in order to charge
    batteries arranged in a storage bank. The storage bank is composed of eight SBS
    100F lead-acid batteries of 100 Ah and 12 V from ENAS Industrial Batteries (Casablanca,
    Morocco) which is used in parallel and series to obtain a global capacity of 400
    Ah and 24 V. A single-phase 24 V/220 V inverter is used to generate an alternating
    voltage. As result, the photovoltaic system can provide constant voltage and sufficient
    current in order to power the system platform and replace the conventional power
    source. The pumping system also contains a UP7000 surface DC water pump from Puricom
    (Taichung, Taiwan) which is able to drive water from the experimental storage
    tank. The pump ensures adequate pressure for the distribution of water in the
    pipes. The drainpipes are pre-fitted on the outer side of the lateral which is
    laid on the ground surface along the row. The operating conditions of the pump
    are described in Table 1. The reservoir used to store the water is a cylindrical
    tank of 45 cm in height and 30 cm in diameter, and equipped with an HC-SR04 ultrasonic
    sensor from Cytron Technologies (Penang, Malaysia) to measure the unfilled depth
    of the reservoir, thus allowing the calculation of the available water in it at
    any given time. Table 1. Operating conditions of the solar water pump. Water pump

    working pressure 4.1 bar The platform is equipped with an embedded system for
    local irrigation management based on a cascaded fuzzy logic controller (on-going
    work). The next step is to provide a new design in order to expand the current
    system into ACPS architecture, thus a new powerful system able to perform all
    kind of remote management tasks of solar irrigation in real-time. 2.4. System
    design The proposed architecture includes three parts: an in-situ base station,
    a control centre, and remote monitoring and tuning unit, as shown in Fig. 4. The
    local base station is deployed in the greenhouse and composed of the main unit
    (MU) along with a measurement node (MN). The MN logs the values of several parameters
    of interest while the MU performs the minimal control of the water pump. Download

    Proposed system design of the cyberisation of SPVWPS. The control centre (CC)
    is a remote server that processes either external data received from local sites
    or requests solicited by users. The processed data are then analysed to make adequate
    irrigation decisions before directing notifications to the watering facility.
    Remote users can easily interact with the CC through the developed graphical interfaces.
    Each graphical interface is dedicated to a role, which ensures adequate remote
    access to data and remote tuning from mobile devices. However, implementations
    of such architecture automatically involve the development and integration of
    many interconnected hardware and software components. For instance, the internet
    connection is used as support to interconnect distributed system parts in order
    to maintain bidirectional data exchange in real-time between the components. 2.4.1.
    Base station The local base station comprises three main parts that are power
    supply system, measurement node, and the main unit. The power supply system uses
    the electrical current, provided from solar energy by PV array, to charge batteries
    during the daytime. The energy stored in battery bank is used for powering the
    local platform and a surface DC water pump when requested. The measurement node
    (MN) is composed of an Arduino duo board used as an interface device for reading
    sensors. The sensors were distributed over the greenhouse in order to monitor
    some internal environmental conditions. The temperature and relative humidity
    were measured with a DHT22 sensor from Aosong Electronics (Guangzhou, China),
    while the soil moisture was measured with VH400 rev.6.0 probes from Vegetronix
    (Riverton, USA). The climate data will then be forwarded to the main unit (MU)
    using serial communication in order to perform adequate processing. The MU is
    based on Raspberry Pi that serves at once as a sink node with actuating, sensing,
    and data transferring capabilities. The sensing and actuating capabilities are
    performed using general purpose input and output (GPIO) pins that accept input
    and output commands during communication with other electronic boards. Thus, one
    GPIO pin is accessed for controlling a relay to achieve the irrigation task for
    a requested duration. Another GPIO pin is used to read water level using the HC-SR04
    ultrasonic sensor. On the other side, the serial communication is used to read
    battery bank voltage using MX5060 voltmeter. This sensing of operational sources
    is necessary for the core logic of the controller to estimate how long the system
    can maintain the irrigation task. To do so, an embedded application is deployed
    in the Raspberry Pi and composed of two parallel tasks that are Data Logger and
    Pump Controller. The Data Logger task aggregates the collected values from sensors
    and measurement unit and relays it to central control for data integration, further
    analysis, and data mining, which make the main unit act as a sink node. In addition,
    the main unit includes MySQL relational database management system used as a backup
    engine to store non-transmitted data whenever the remote server is unreachable.
    The data stored remains eligible for transmission to the remote server until establishing
    a new connection with the remote database, which prevents the loss of data. The
    Pump Controller task is deployed as a dormant service which remains inactive until
    receiving notification from the control server to act. Then it can perform the
    irrigation task for the notified duration. Data exchange between this service
    and the remote decision-making were done in a well-defined manner and communication
    using REST clients. 2.4.2. Control centre The CC hosts the supervisory level which
    can perform advanced computation operations, further analysis and data mining
    on the information collected from the agricultural system. In addition, it is
    responsible for managing the information traffic between the users and the local
    base station. To accomplish these tasks, we developed and deployed a web server
    using the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) paradigm. A set of REST web services
    have been deployed in order to handle separately different cloud-computing operations.
    As a result, the new client–server architecture ensures bidirectional data flow
    between the remote CC and the clients (users and base station). The communication
    is event-driven where the initiative can come from the clients as well as the
    server. In practice, this involves two HTTP request/response scenarios. The first
    one is the ordinary client-to-server communication where the initiative always
    comes from the client. The client sends an HTTP request to the server and then
    waits to receive back an HTTP response. Whenever the response is fully sent/received,
    the server closes the connection. For instance, the base station can transmit
    available measurements along with water pump status, and the remote users can
    schedule and publish new irrigation tasks. The second one is the new server-to-client
    communication where the server takes the initiative of starting the communication.
    The server can push the available data asynchronously once the client establishes
    the connection. The Server-Sent Events (SSE) mechanism is chosen to satisfy real-time
    data exchange between the CC and the clients. The CC decides immediately to transmit
    a new “chunk” of data to the clients whenever it is available. Thus, the clients
    can take the initiative to establish a connection with the CC and be ready to
    receive the automatic update from the remote server through HTTP connection. For
    instance, the base station immediately receives the notification from the CC to
    start irrigation and the remote users can monitor in real-time the sensor readings
    along with water pump status. 2.4.3. Remote monitoring and tuning The remote monitoring
    and tuning unit is designed to introduce remote management operations via HTTP
    requests over the Internet. Remote operations include primarily real-time monitoring
    of the system key-parameters and online maintenance of the controller logic. Hence,
    the users can interact with the remote CC, according to their roles, from any
    terminal within the local area network or on the internet. The new design introduces
    three roles: farmer, maintainer and administrator. At the first level, the farmer
    role consists in performing three main tasks: scheduling irrigation tasks, checking
    the solar system for any anomaly, and real-time monitoring of sensor readings.
    The monitoring includes the real-time gathering and remote viewing of both the
    climatic parameter values and pumping resource levels. At the second level, the
    maintainer role extends that of the farmer. The maintainer is then responsible
    for executing periodical upkeep of the system and fixing the reported bugs and
    failures. At the last level, the administrator role has more advanced privileges.
    First, the system start-up requests a typical intervention of the administrator
    by editing the operational information of the solar components in order to fit
    with the specification of the base station facilities. Then, when the system is
    operational, the administrator will have full access to the collected data and
    controller activities. Such traceability allows deep analysis of the performance
    and effectiveness of the decision level. Furthermore, the online tuning features
    give the administrator the ability to adjust the values of the controller parameters.
    The tuning includes the edition of the fuzzification, defuzzification and rules
    base engines, which lead to the desired performances. 3. System implementation
    The CC hosts the web-server, which is based on the SOA paradigm. It consists of
    a set of deployed REST-web services remotely accessible and manageable independently.
    For this purpose, the Eclipse Vert.x framework is used in the implementation.
    This framework is a lightweight platform that helps to set up distributed applications
    based on reactive micro-services (Secure Enclaves for Reactive Cloud Applications
    Project, 2015, Eclipse Vert.x for building reactive applications on the JVM, 2016,
    Hilgert et al., 2016). Vert.x applications consist of weakly coupled components,
    called Verticles, running simultaneously. A Verticle is a piece of code that can
    be deployed flexibly by incorporating different programming languages, making
    the Vert.x a polyglot platform. However, in this study, the Vert.x is used as
    a toolkit running on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Thus, Vert.x instances can
    deploy and execute their own set of Verticles. Each Verticle takes part in the
    application logic with the ability to communicate with other Verticles. Event
    bus as an integrated and distributed service is used as the support for internal
    communication between Verticles, which make them event-driven components. The
    data exchange during this communication is basically performed using the usual
    messaging designs (publish/subscribe or point-to-point). So far, the Vert.x methodology
    has been used to build a highly concurrent application including the main parts
    of the proposed architecture. Such implementation aims to provide an event-driven
    system composed of several parts governed by the changes in environmental conditions
    and user specifications. Each part has specific contributions to the system logic
    and involves several logical dependencies on other parts. The measurement node
    (MN) remains inactive until the connection with the main unit (MU) has been established,
    and then it takes measurements and sends the collected data to the MU. After that,
    it will switch to the standby state and wait for a new connection. The initiative
    of new connections comes from the MU every 30 min to receive sensed data. The
    MU introduces the task scheduler with the purpose of managing the irrigation process
    including actuation times and durations. Scheduler entries are the tasks scheduled
    to execute orders sent by the CC via a permanent connection. After executing the
    last task in the queue, the MU will switch to the standby state and wait for new
    notification or timer. The CC waits for the connections between the users and
    the MU to communicate adequate data. These connections will remain alive in order
    to publish a new user request, notification or decision-making after analysing
    sensed data. 3.1. Control centre software An overview of the relevant components
    of the CC software is given in Fig. 5. Besides performing data processing of the
    collected data from the in-situ station, the CC provides an execution context
    of a web server. An exhaustive explanation of each component is provided in Table
    2. Download : Download high-res image (461KB) Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 5. Overview of the Control Centre (CC) architecture. Table 2. Description
    of the main components of the CC. Component Type Functionality Supervisor Verticle
    This verticle serves as a strategic level able to communicate and provide supervision
    to other components of the operational level. Measurements Service Measurements
    service is responsible for handling various data provided by the main unit after
    collection from the external sources. New data will be forwarded to the Sensor
    Data Verticle for advanced analysis and storage in the database. In addition,
    it can serve as a data provider for the remote user by giving data access to sensor
    readings both real-time notification and request of historical data. Sensor data
    Verticle Sensor Data verticle is responsible for handling CRUD(Create, Read, Update
    and Delete) operations concerning the measurements Table in the database. For
    instance, it can receive data from the Measurements service and store it in the
    database before forwarding to the irrigation controller to decide about the irrigation.
    Also, it can investigate this Table in order to meet user requests for sensor
    readings during a specific time frame. Actuations Service The actuation service
    is supposed to receive and share water pump status between the different actors
    of the distributed system. In fact, it can publish by notification the received
    decision-making of the new actuation command including the activity time and length.
    An observer is defined for tracking the status of the new task and communicating
    any real-time change in it. In addition, this service can be used to request the
    records of pump activities during the desired period. Irrigation controller Verticle
    Irrigation Controller verticle is a key component of the automation of the irrigation
    process. Actuation decision-making including estimated durations could be the
    result of user requests or system automatic behaviour according to environmental
    conditions. For the second scenario, the inference engine of the controller handles
    climate data provided by the Sensors Data verticle. The climate data includes
    indoor temperature and relative soil moisture. The value of soil moisture is analysed
    by calculating the relative error from the setpoint. The setpoint is defined by
    users to meet the growing conditions of the crop or to cope with external weather
    changes. Finally, the inference engine uses the temperature and relative error
    to select the appropriate rule in the rule base to evaluate the watering time.
    Then, the estimated duration is combined with the pumping capacity of the resources
    (energy and water) to maintain the watering, in order to calculate the effective
    watering time. In addition, the verticle is responsible for handling CRUD operations
    concerning the Commands Table. Configuration Service This service is responsible
    for loading and editing the system preferences upon request. Therefore, users
    could define the individual preferences according to their role and the delegated
    responsibility in the system. User preference Verticle The user preference verticle
    provides the in situ equipment operational settings, nominal climate conditions,
    and controller preferences, thereby allowing other components to consider these
    preferences and settings during calculation and data mining processes. The verticle
    is also responsible for handling CRUD operations concerning configuration tables
    and files. 3.1.1. Web server development The web server is created from inside
    a single Verticle and the implementation of RESTful services is easily done by
    handling requests as follows: public class HttpServerService extends AbstractVerticle
    { @Override public void start(Future<Void> startFuture) throws Exception {  1.
    HttpServer httpServer = vertx.createHttpServer();  2. httpServer.listen([server_port]);  3.
    Router= Router.router(vertx);  4. httpServer .requestHandler(router::accept);  5.
    router.route("/"+[relative_URL]).handler(this::method_name); } } The first two
    lines create and start an instance of HTTP server which will listen to requests
    sent to the choosing port (server_port). The next lines create an instance of
    a router that will handle an HTTP request and find the matching route (relative_URL)
    for that request, and pass the request to that route (method_name). In this way,
    the Vert.x makes it very easy to deploy an HTTP server. Thus, the applications
    will be able to receive HTTP requests and communicate with other services without
    any additional setup. Also, it is possible to create one or more HTTP servers
    depending on the application context need. Apache Tomcat could be used as a traditional
    web server to run REST-service and will act as the intermediary between the central
    unit and others clients (Cimino et al., 2016, López-Riquelme et al., 2017, Vujović
    and Maksimović, 2015). The servlet container is easily configurable and has an
    optimal manipulation of hardware. However, it is very greedy in terms of the consumption
    of resource and the CPU use. Moreover, the implementation of RESTful service comes
    with additional frameworks that run and execute on the server, thus additional
    server optimisations are needed. 3.1.2. Server-Sent Events (SSE) integration The
    Vert.x provides an easy way to incorporate SSE technology into the web-server
    and the implementation could be as follows: public void setServerSendEvent(RoutingContext
    ctx,Vertx vertx,String message){  1. ctx.response().setChunked(true);  2. ctx.response().headers().add("content-type",
    "text/event-stream;charset=UTF,8″);  3. ctx.response().headers().add("connection",
    "keep-alive");  4. vertx.eventBus().consumer(message, msg,> {  5. ctx.response().write(msg.body().toString()
    + "∖n"); }); } The main idea is that the server keeps alive the HTTP connection
    that was established after the initiative requested from the client. Beyond this
    connection, the client waits to receive the update that will be published automatically
    by the server whenever new data are available. During this communication, the
    JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) has been adopted with the intention to moderate
    the amount of transferred data used to its simplicity, processing speed, and low
    permeability. 3.2. Main unit software The base station is designed to perform
    two main tasks. Firstly, it is responsible for gathering the information periodically
    from the sensors and transmitting it to the remote station. Secondly, the base
    station is equipped with a local control system which is responsible for the execution
    of the irrigation tasks to satisfy the decision-making of the supervisory level.
    The implementation of these features consists of deploying scheduled tasks with
    different frequencies. Each task can consume web services that communicate with
    the REST protocol to perform a bidirectional data exchange including messaging,
    retrieving, and parsing data. Vert.x provides an easy way to time the execution
    of a portion of the code by introducing two timers. The first one is the period
    timer which is very convenient to perform sensor readings and data transmission
    operations since it keeps firing events periodically at a definite frequency.
    The second timer type is the one-time timer that is used to start the watering
    for a requested duration since it waits for the defined length of time to fire
    an event. 4. Decision-making level The autonomous irrigation behaviour involves
    mixed-nature variables, namely climate and irrigation resources information. The
    climate data, which are the inside temperature and soil moisture content, are
    used to satisfy crop need for water. The resources data, which are the batteries
    state of charge and stored water level, are used to determine the ability of the
    system to perform the irrigation for a specific duration. In addition, an intelligent
    decision system should be based on autonomous structures that can supervise the
    scheduling of irrigation time to satisfy fully automatic behaviour or respond
    to human interventions. Therefore, the decision-making stage is chosen to have
    two distributed levels deployed in the CC and the MU as shown in Fig. 6. The two
    levels are able to communicate with each other through the internet connection
    or a local network. A detailed description of each level is presented in the next
    sections. Download : Download high-res image (268KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 6. Irrigation decision-making levels: a) CC level, b) MU level. 4.1.
    Control centre level: irrigation control The CC software deploys the irrigation
    control service which can add a new irrigation task whenever the crop needs water
    as shown in Fig. 6a. The need for irrigation can be decided both by a direct intervention
    of the user or the autonomous behaviour of the system. The user can directly define
    the duration of watering by referring only to the accumulated experiences without
    any calculation or inference rules. Contrariwise, the smart system can estimate
    the irrigation duration based on its inference engine. The estimation combines
    the user preferences with the elaborated base rules based on human experience
    as described Ed-Dahhak et al. (2013). The base rules involve only the physical
    quantities coming from greenhouse climate, that is inside temperature (T_in) and
    soil moisture (M). At the end of the process, the watering time and the estimated
    duration (D_estimated) are forwarded to the main unit in order to add a new entry
    to its tasks scheduler. 4.2. Main unit level: irrigation scheduler The main unit
    in the base station hosts the irrigation scheduler service, which is responsible
    for planning the actuation of the water pump as shown in Fig. 6b. This service
    establishes a live connection with the CC thanks to the SSE mechanism and remains
    ready to receive the remote supervisory order to perform irrigation tasks. After
    receiving a new notification to activate the water pump, the Scheduler analyses
    the request to decide whether to add a new entry or to send a warning, depending
    on the availability of resources. The availability is estimated by the Resources
    Planning bloc, which computes the coverage error of the stored water and energy.
    Then, the fuzzy logic controller device conjugates the coverage error of each
    individual resource to evaluate the total coverage of the watering system. Actually,
    the total coverage indicates the effective watering time that could be guaranteed
    by the system. For further analysis and accurate tracking of the watering activities,
    the execution of scheduler tasks is reinforced with a set of five labels which
    are “scheduled”, “running”, “succeeded”, “failed” and “cancelled” as shown in
    Fig. 7. First, every new task has to be scheduled for processing. Then, when it
    is time to start, the execution may accidentally fail due to some unexpected conditions
    such as no availability of operational resources or internal errors. Elsewhere,
    the task is marked as running which means that the solar pump is currently activated
    and that it is not finished yet. Finally, if the task is not cancelled responding
    to the user request or due to operational condition issue, then the task is completed
    successfully. Download : Download high-res image (117KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 7. Proposed labels for tracking the watering task status. 5. Experimental
    setup The Arduino card is used to host the developed firmware for handling the
    sensor readings. The card is the duo model, which is the first board based on
    a 32-bit ARM core microcontroller with 96 KB of RAM and 512 KB of flash memory.
    The duo board is connected to Raspberry Pi card using a serial connection. The
    Raspberry Pi board is the B model that integrates a 900 MHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A7
    CPU with 1 GB RAM and has enough onboard storage and processing power. Pi4J 1.0
    library was used to manage the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins (Pi4J Project, 2016). The
    workstation hosts the deployed web-server using Vert.x 3.3.2 along with a MySQL5
    database engine. The system parts are interconnected through a local network and
    powered using the solar setup. Dedicated graphical user interfaces (GUI) were
    developed with the intention to delegate and distribute several responsibilities
    and specific tasks to different actors in the system. Thus, users can interact
    with the remote server using local network or internet connection. The next section
    presents the features allowed for the farmer''s role. 6. Results and discussions
    6.1. User application The farmer can easily interact remotely with the system
    using the dedicated graphical user interface. It is a rich internet application
    created using the JavaFX 8 software platform. Thus, it can run across a diversity
    of devices including any desktop, browser, and mobile phone that could run the
    corresponding Java edition. The delivered solution is expected to be a user-friendly
    GUI with basic management features. It provides an easy way to monitor the environmental
    data along with the SPVWS status as well as the ability to program new irrigation
    tasks. The included functionalities are: 1. Requesting the system sensor readings
    including the inside temperature, soil moisture, energy bank state of charge,
    and storage water level. 2. Visualising the historical data collection concerning
    system sensor readings and water pump actuation with the option to set the period
    shown, which guarantees an accurate daily behaviour analysis. 3. Tracking the
    status of the water pump. In fact, the executed tasks tab traces the daily actions
    of the solar pump with relevant details such as activity time, actuation mode
    (automatic and manual), and activity length, which guarantees an accurate evaluation
    of the consumption of operational resources. Also, the scheduled tasks tab gives
    an overview of the future requests for water pumping with the requested actuation
    duration. This is very relevant for resource planning when evaluating the operational
    resources balance by comparing the requested and the available amount. 4. Requesting
    immediate deactivations of the water pump. 5. Planning future actuation of the
    water pump, with related time and activity length information. 6. Updating the
    soil moisture, water level, and battery bank thresholds. 7. Displaying alarms
    and warnings concerning system failure including the connection to the remote
    server, measurement node issues, and operational resource insufficiency. 6.2.
    Benefits of the approach 6.2.1. Real-time constraints System validation ultimately
    involves evaluation of the system behaviour when faced with real-time operation.
    Real-time constraints are primarily related to real-time response, recovering
    from failures and network reliability. Indeed, the system demonstrated the ability
    to provide real-time responses to the external interactions from the local site
    or the remote users. The responsive behaviour comes from adopting a suitable architecture
    and using the JSON format during the data exchange. The architecture consists
    only of three nodes, which allows high processing speed and avoids congestion
    during data exchange. In addition, the application software is implemented using
    the Vert.x design, and thus it can efficiently exploit features of multicore CPU
    technology, namely the use of every core in it. The application is also composed
    of several Verticles as asynchronous and non-blocking components which are able
    to deal with concurrency workload by involving only a few threads. This results
    in decreasing the link utilisation and limiting the number of delays in message
    exchanges. In addition, the system offers great resilience to ensure continuous
    service at the right time even when certain system processes are failing. Failures
    can be due to hardware and software exceptions in the local station. Although
    the farmer is responsible for checking these anomalies and passing them on to
    the system administrator, the system plans some scenarios to deal with unfinished
    irrigation tasks and main unit disconnection: • Faced with an uncompleted irrigation
    task due to insufficient pumping water, the system was able to roll back the failed
    task to its previously saved state and run watering only for the remaining time.
    • Faced with a lack connection with the main unit (local station) due to sudden
    shutdown or connection issues, the CC isolated and suspended all services that
    deal with the local site data pending the establishment of a new connection. The
    other services would cancel any communication with the suspended services immediately
    after receiving a notification of the failure. • Once the link was re-established,
    the main unit was able to recover its lost contexts from the CC. For example,
    it loaded the irrigation schedule and the preferences of the users from the remote
    centre. In addition, it transmitted the backup of measurements and pumping activities
    that had been stored in the local database. 6.2.2. Update and maintenance To recover
    the system from failures or support new extensions, its maintenance should be
    managed remotely. Therefore, the hardware/software system updates will be extremely
    easy for the user: • The administrator has full remote access to the main unit
    via secure shell communication and can perform several maintenance tasks, including
    reviewing system logs, restarting the integrated application, setting the network
    configuration, restarting the unit, and installing new updates. • Java Web Start
    is an application deployment mechanism which offers to launch user applications
    directly from the internet via a web browser. The applications can be updated
    online without any interventions on the users'' devices. • The web server is deployed
    in the application rather than operating as a standalone service, which means
    that the maintenance and configuration of both the server and user applications
    can be performed simultaneously without any additional configuration. • The system
    is versatile enough to support other extensions and is ready to accommodate new
    features and modules. Indeed, new features could be easily introduced as independent
    components that can communicate and share data asynchronously and seamlessly with
    other system services. 7. Conclusions and future works Solar photovoltaic energy
    was introduced as a new renewable energy source to power ACPS. This involves expanding
    the system design and improving the decision-making. Actually, the new design
    supports photovoltaic irrigation installation while the inference engine takes
    into account the availability of operational resources. As a result, an event-driven
    system has been developed, based on low-cost devices and a micro-service architecture.
    The system uses photovoltaic energy as a power source and supports real-time remote
    management of various irrigation tasks. The next step will focus on enhancing
    the system so it can be deployed in large-scale areas. This challenge involves
    systematically the issues of deploying measurement nodes in large agricultural
    systems. In addition, the versatility of the system software design could help
    the extension of the system to support simultaneously all types of precision farming
    data, processes, and controls. Finally, we believe that the concept presented
    in this paper will represent a springboard for other researchers in the field
    of integrating renewable energy sources for powering ACPSs. Acknowledgements We

    \ Greenhouse cultivation has evolved from simple covered rows of open-fields crops\
    \ to highly sophisticated controlled \nenvironment agriculture (CEA) facilities\
    \ that projected the image of plant factories for urban agriculture.  The advances\
    \ and \nimprovements in CEA have promoted the scientific solutions for the efficient\
    \ production of plants in populated cities and \nmulti-story buildings.  Successful\
    \ deployment of CEA for urban agriculture requires many components and subsystems,\
    \ as \nwell as the understanding of the external influencing factors that should\
    \ be systematically considered and integrated.  This \nreview is an attempt to\
    \ highlight some of the most recent advances in greenhouse technology and CEA\
    \ in order to raise the \nawareness for technology transfer and adaptation, which\
    \ is necessary for a successful transition to urban agriculture.  This \nstudy\
    \ reviewed several aspects of a high-tech CEA system including improvements in\
    \ the frame and covering materials, \nenvironment perception and data sharing,\
    \ and advanced microclimate control and energy optimization models.  This research\
    \ \nhighlighted urban agriculture and its derivatives, including vertical farming,\
    \ rooftop greenhouses and plant factories which are \nthe extensions of CEA and\
    \ have emerged as a response to the growing population, environmental degradation,\
    \ and urbanization \nthat are threatening food security.  Finally, several opportunities\
    \ and challenges have been identified in implementing the \nintegrated CEA and\
    \ vertical farming for urban agriculture. \nKeywords: smart agriculture, greenhouse\

    \ \ntransition driven by the advances in precision technology, data \nprocessing\
    \ and smart farming.  Protected cultivations have \nchanged from simple covered\
    \ greenhouse structures to high-tech \nplant factories that optimize the productivity\
    \ of the plants and \nhuman labour.  A modern greenhouse operates as a system,\
    \ \ntherefore, it is also referred to as controlled environment agriculture \n\
    (CEA), controlled environment plant production system (CEPPS), \nor Phytomation\
    \ systems[1].  These structures use natural or \nartificial light within which\
    \ optimum growth conditions is intended \nto achieve for producing horticultural\
    \ crops, or for plant research \nprograms.  They also offer greater predictability,\
    \ reduce the cost \nof production and increase crop yields.  A comprehensive history\
    \ \nof greenhouses in the past three decades can be found in the works \nof [2-6].\
    \  Examples of earlier works in automation and computer \ncontrol of greenhouse\
    \ environment are showed in [7-9].  Previous \nstudies on greenhouse engineering\
    \ during the 1990s have been \nreviewed by Hanan[10] and Critten and Bailey[11].\
    \ \nThe United Nations has predicted that by 2050, more than \ntwo-thirds of the\
    \ nine billion world population will live in the cities.  \nSecuring the supply\
    \ chain of fresh fruits and vegetables in this new \nscenario will be an overwhelming\
    \ challenge.  If properly designed, \n2   January, 2018                      \

    \ and plant \nfactories can significantly contribute to this context for the \n\
    year-round production of fresh vegetables in urban areas.  For \nsuch a system\
    \ to operate successfully and achieve its production \nobjectives, attention needs\
    \ to be paid to the technical aspects of \nautomation (A), culture (C), environment\
    \ (E) and system (SYS).  \nTing et al.[1] defined ACESYS terms as follow: Automation\
    \ is the \nprocessing of information and execution of tasks for operation of \n\
    CEA through computerized instrumentations and various control \nalgorithms that\
    \ might include decision support programs and \nartificial intelligence.  The\
    \ cultural and environmental factors \ncomprise \ncultivation \ntechniques, \n\
    plants \ncharacteristics, \nmicroclimate requirements and growth responses.  It\
    \ also contains \nmorphological and physiological conditions such as “multiplication,\
    \ \nrooting, transplanting, pruning, water and nutrient delivery, \npesticide\
    \ application, harvesting, post-harvest processing, etc”.  \nTing et al.[1] stated\
    \ that “Systems analysis and integration is a \nmethodology that starts with the\
    \ definition of a system and its goals, \nand leads to the conclusion regarding\
    \ the system’s workability, \nproductivity, reliability, and other performance\
    \ indicators.” \nResearch trends in this field are toward innovative methods for\
    \ \nshifting from conventional greenhouses to smart controlled \nenvironments\
    \ that benefit from natural resources for eliminating \ndeleterious external conditions.\
    \  The ultimate objective in this \nregard would be achieving high yield and high-quality\
    \ fruits at \nminimum possible cost. \nInnovations in the low-cost and low-power\
    \ consumption \nsensors and instrumentations, communication devices, data \nprocessing\
    \ and mobile applications, along with the technological \nadvances in the design\
    \ structures, simulation models, and \nhorticultural engineering have provided\
    \ the state-of-the-art \nfacilities that are shifting the traditional CEA to plant\
    \ factories for \nurban farming.  This paper begins with a summary of several\
    \ \nreviewed literature in Section 2 on the advances in greenhouse \ncovering\
    \ materials, artificial light, and the efficiency of the \nmicroclimate controller\
    \ for a viable CEA system.  This part aimed \nto investigate the effects of the\
    \ existing and new covering materials \non the resulting microclimate (including\
    \ influencing factors and \ntheir interactions with cultural practices), plants\
    \ growth, and yield.  \nModeling of CEA, as well as object-oriented automation-culture-\
    \ \nenvironment system analysis that is presented in the works of Ting \net al.[1]\
    \ provide a systematic approach for a better understanding of \nthese influencing\
    \ factors.  These findings and their implications in \na modern CAE such as plant\
    \ factories and agri-cubes are further \ndiscussed in Section 5.  After that,\
    \ environmental monitoring and \nperception by means of wireless sensor networks\
    \ (WSN) and \ninternet of things-based (IoT-based) platforms have been \ndemonstrated\
    \ and reviewed as an essential part of an automation \nsystem.  In our opinion,\
    \ the three biggest challenges for the \ndevelopment of an efficient and viable\
    \ CEA system are the creation \nof automation levels for energy management, reduction\
    \ of \nenvironmental impact, and maximizing use of natural resources.  \nA comprehensive\
    \ review of the advances in environmental control \nmethods, energy optimization\
    \ models, prediction tools, and \ndecision support systems are provided in Section\
    \ 4.  Specifically, \nthe applications of different high-level algorithms for\
    \ the most \nefficient microclimate control solutions are highlighted in Section\
    \ \n4.1.  These control methods and automation phases have been \nreviewed to\
    \ illustrate how each part can facilitate achieving the \noverall objectives of\
    \ a CEA.  A summary of some of the research \nworks in the past decade on energy\
    \ analysis, artificial intelligence, \nand simulation models with applications\
    \ in different aspects of \ngreenhouse production are presented in Sections 4.2\
    \ and 4.3.  A \nsubstantial amount of research has been done on individual aspects\
    \ \nof automation, culture, and environment, as well as their \ncombination, however\
    \ improvements of CEA also require decision \nsupport systems (DSS) and assessment\
    \ tools for long-term risk \nmanagement by accurately determining the interactions\
    \ between \nclimate parameters and growth responses prior to the actual \ncultivation[12].\
    \  To identify technological pathways for energy \nefficient CEA, a survey was\
    \ performed in Section 4.4 to highlight \nsome of the improved solutions based\
    \ on decision support systems \nfor energy management strategies in the commercial\
    \ greenhouses.  \nIn Section 5, the research covered urban agriculture and the\
    \ \ndevelopment of plant factories and vertical farming which is \ngrowing rapidly\
    \ in the East and Southeast Asia, most noticeably in \nJapan, South Korea, Taiwan\
    \ Province of China, and Malaysia, and \nreviewed several conceptual designs such\
    \ as the rooftop \ngreenhouses to highlight how various research and educational\
    \ \ninstitutes, real estate developers, and construction companies are \ninvolved\
    \ in the emerged opportunities.   \n2  Considerations for viability \nSeveral\
    \ factors to be considered in designing of a viable \ngreenhouse system for producing\
    \ year-round crops and \nvegetables are the structure frame, landscape, topography,\
    \ soil, \nclimate conditions, microclimate control system, light condition, \n\
    intercepted solar radiation, windbreaks, the availability of \nelectricity, roadways,\
    \ and labor force.  Other conditions that \nshould also be taken into account\
    \ for an efficient large-scale \ncommercial greenhouse production[13,14] are the\
    \ environment, \neconomic and social factors.  For example, a modern greenhouse\
    \ \nstructure might be constructed within a commercial building or \nnear commercial\
    \ or residential lands.  Some of the most popular \ngreenhouse structures and\
    \ CEA are presented in Figure 1. There \nare numerous experimental and analytical\
    \ research works that \naddress how environmental parameters inside a greenhouse\
    \ is \naffected by the structural design and shape, volume size, \ndimensions,\
    \ plants density, covering films, structure material, \nwind speed, geographical\
    \ orientation, and most importantly the \nmicroclimate control system.  For example,\
    \ in regions where \nsolar radiation or ambient air temperatures are high, several\
    \ \ndesign factors for optimum air exchange such as the ratio of the \narea of\
    \ the vent openings to the ground area covered by the \ngreenhouse, the ratio\
    \ of the greenhouse volume to the floor area, \nand the vertical distance between\
    \ the air inlets and air outlets can \nsignificantly improve the ventilation performance.\
    \  Optimization \nof vent configuration by evaluating greenhouse and plant canopy\
    \ \nventilation rates under wind-induced ventilation has been studied \nby Kacira\
    \ et al.[15].  This section provides a summary of the \nresearch works that have\
    \ addressed improvements in covering \nmaterials, and microclimate control systems.\
    \  To avoid \noverlapping of the contexts and maintain a consistent flow of the\
    \ \ntopics, we have covered the advances in structure design (i.e., \nrooftop\
    \ greenhouses) as a separate subsection under urban \nagriculture. \nJanuary,\

    \ \n \n2.1  Covering materials \nConsiderations for greenhouses covering materials\
    \ involve \nsupporting foundation, shape and framing materials, geographical \n\
    direction for optimal light entrance, the load of equipment, factors \nfor static\
    \ and dynamic loads (i.e., hanging plants, structure weight, \nand wind speed),\
    \ dimension ratio, and volume.  Greenhouses \nstructures and covering can take\
    \ different forms which can be used \nto surround the whole or a section of the\
    \ cultivation area and space.  \nThe most dominant transparent materials in use\
    \ are 2-3 mm glass \npanels, net-screen film, and  0.1 mm and 0.2 mm Polyethylene\
    \ \n(PE) plastic films, and ultraviolet (UV) stabilized PE-films.  \nBaudoin et\
    \ al.[16] recommended that in order to obtain a reasonable \nheat rise of less\
    \ than 4°C in a glass-clad greenhouse, the airflow \nrate should be 0.04-0.05\
    \ m3/s of floor area (1 m2).  Selection of \ncovering material for a greenhouse\
    \ depends on its application, the \ntype of crop to be cultivated, and the climate\
    \ condition of the \nregion.  It can vary from simple covers such as one layer\
    \ plastic[17,18], \ndouble-wall plastic[19,20], and glass[21,22], to fiberglass[23,24],\
    \ \ndouble-wall plastic, acrylic sheet[25], polyethylene film[26-29], \npolyvinyl\
    \ \nchloride \n(PVC)[30], \ncopolymers[31], \nPolycarbonate \npanels[32], and\
    \ selective transmission medium[33,34] for different \nspectral frequencies. \
    \ Some of these materials are designed to trap \nenergy inside the greenhouse\
    \ and heats both plants zone and its \nsurroundings.  Detailed properties of these\
    \ covering, as well as the \nquality assessments of their mechanical properties,\
    \ have been \naddressed in detail by a study on the effects of cover diffusive\
    \ \nproperties on the components of greenhouse solar radiation[34]. \nCondensation,\
    \ radiation transmittance and diffusing properties \nof different types of transmitting\
    \ covering materials in greenhouses \nhave been discussed by Pollet et al.[35].\
    \  Glazing materials allow \nshorter-wavelength radiation (i.e. visible light)\
    \ to pass through, but \nlong wavelength radiation such as infrared (heat) is\
    \ trapped inside \nthe greenhouse.  A comparison between different greenhouse\
    \ \ncovering materials, including polyethylene film, photo-selective red \ncolor\
    \ film, and insect-proof net for tomato cultivation during \nsummer is available\
    \ in the works of Arcidiacono et al.[36] and \nHemming et al.[37] Jarquín-Enríquez\
    \ et al.[38] studied the effects of \ndouble layer plastic and flat glass cover\
    \ on the lycopene \naccumulation and color index during tomato fruit ripening.\
    \  They \nconcluded that lycopene biosynthesis in tomato fruits was increased\
    \ \nby the amount of light after the beginning of ripening growth stage.  \nStudying\
    \ the effect of greenhouse covering materials on the inside \nair temperature\
    \ under tropical climate condition showed that while \noutside temperature was\
    \ between 28°C-33°C, the temperature \ninside \na \npolyethylene \nfilm \ncovered\
    \ \ngreenhouse \nwithout \nenvironment control reached 68°C-70°C, leading to air\
    \ vapor \npressure deficit (VPD) of 4 kPa[39].  Al-Mahdouri et al.[40] \nevaluated\
    \ optical properties and thermal performances of different \ngreenhouse covering\
    \ materials.  The combinations of external \nclimate conditions and type of greenhouse\
    \ for the most appropriate \napplication have been studied by Kempkes et al.[41]\
    \ A computer \napplication to measure geometric characterization and dimensions\
    \ \nof insect-proof screens was designed by Álvarez et al.[42].  \nPolythene-clad\
    \ greenhouses do not become as hot because of the \ntransparency of the plastic\
    \ to long-wave radiation that is \ntransmitted back out of the greenhouse.  Therefore,\
    \ for a \npolythene-film covered greenhouse, the ventilation rate can be \nreduced\
    \ to 0.03-0.04 m3/s of floor area (1 m2)[43].  With \ngreenhouse shading, the\
    \ amount of solar radiation and light \nintensity reaching the plants is restricted,\
    \ creating a closed \ndifference between air temperature inside and outside the\
    \ \ngreenhouse.  Shading also decreases leaf surface temperature \nsignificantly.\
    \  According to Glenn et al.[44], while a 20% to 80% \nlight reduction can be\
    \ expected depending on the shading materials, \nthe sufficient light reduction\
    \ for most greenhouse applications is \nbetween 30% and 50%.  Hassanien and Li[45]\
    \ investigated the \nmicroclimate parameters and growth responses of lettuce plants\
    \ \ninside a greenhouse that was shaded with semi-transparent \nmono-crystalline\
    \ silicon double glazing photovoltaic panels \n(STPV).  The STPV panels of their\
    \ study accounted for 20% of \nthe greenhouse roof area, and showed that the combination\
    \ of \nSTPV and polyethylene cover decreased the solar radiation by 35% \nto 40%\
    \ compared to the use of polyethylene cover.  They also \nshowed that the STPV\
    \ shading decreased the air temperature by \n4   January, 2018               \

    \ effect on the relative \nhumidity, fresh weight, leaf area and the chlorophyll\
    \ contents under \nnatural ventilation. \nProtected cultivation of Solanaceous\
    \ crops such as tomatoes \nand peppers by means of Screen-houses operating on\
    \ natural \nventilation is now a commonly practiced in tropical lowlands for \n\
    reducing insect migration, the risk of damage by high rainfall, \nextreme solar\
    \ radiation, and high wind speeds.  In addition, by \nusing insect-proof net covered\
    \ greenhouse, the inside and outside \ntemperature may remain similar, while temperature\
    \ has been \nobserved to be rising with the photo-selective film during summer.\
    \  \nStudies showed that net-screen greenhouses have gained more \npopularity\
    \ in tropical regions due to the potential of climate \nparameters that have optimality\
    \ degrees close to the plants desired \nlevels.  Shamshiri[46] observed that under\
    \ an insect-proof \nnet-screen covered greenhouse operating on natural ventilation,\
    \ the \ninside and outside air temperature remained close to each other, \nwhile\
    \ the air temperature was found to increase inside two \nphoto-selective film\
    \ covered greenhouses (polycarbonate panel and \na polyethylene covered) operating\
    \ on evaporative cooling[39].  \nShading nets ease the natural ventilation process\
    \ and can protect \nplants from excessive sunlight, wind, and heavy rains.  Lorenzo\
    \ et \nal.[47] reported that movable shade under intense sunlight in Spain \n\
    caused 10% increase in the marketable yield of greenhouse tomato.  \nOther reports\
    \ indicated that external and internal shading nets \nreduced horizontal and vertical\
    \ gradients in air temperature \ncompared with those without shading nets[48].\
    \  Results of a study \non the effect of roof height of a large screen-house on\
    \ the \nventilation rate using one-dimensional computational model and \npreliminary\
    \ measurements showed that increasing roof height by 2 \nm increases both temperature\
    \ and humidity levels in the canopy \nlayer[49].  Microclimate, air velocity,\
    \ ventilation efficiency, and \nlight transmittance are mainly influenced by the\
    \ properties of the \nnet-screen mesh and the greenhouse shape.  While these structures\
    \ \nenhance natural ventilation in hot and humid climate conditions, \nthey still\
    \ require strong shelters for protecting plants from extreme \nsolar radiation,\
    \ rain, and strong winds.  The screen-house itself is \nan important pest protection\
    \ device, provided it is equipped with \nfine mesh screens in all openings, and\
    \ a double-door system. \n2.2  Light control and artificial lights \nThe main\
    \ approaches for controlling light level and the \nintercepted radiance in CEA\
    \ are through planted density, shading \nscreens, and artificial lights.  Light\
    \ condition and air temperature \nare the two most important environmental factors\
    \ for plants growth.  \nIn fact, discussions about optimal air temperature without\
    \ including \nlight condition and plant evapotranspiration does not generate any\
    \ \nuseful data for maximizing yield and producing high-quality \nvegetable. \
    \ Light and air temperature are intrinsically related and \nit is a well-known\
    \ fact that one cannot be optimized without \nconsidering the other.  For example,\
    \ tomato quality, including \nyield, productivity and lycopene value is not only\
    \ affected by the \nmicroclimate parameters and cultural experience, but with\
    \ the \nPhotosynthetic Photon Flux Density (PPFD).  In fact, it is the \noptimal\
    \ combination of air temperature, relative humidity, and light \nthat will result\
    \ in maximum yield (assuming that other factors such \nas CO2, soil pH, and nutrient\
    \ are not limiting).  A schematic \ndiagram is presented in Figure 2 to illustrate\
    \ the effects of light \nspectral, intensity and photoperiod on plant growth,\
    \ along with a \ncomparison between spectral power distribution of natural and\
    \ \nartificial light sources, and the plant’s response to irradiance level. \n\

    \ distribution of natural and artificial light sources and light response curve\
    \ of plants  \n \nThe most common artificial light sources that are used in \n\
    modern greenhouses and CEAs are incandescent/halogen lamps, \ndischarge lamps\
    \ (such as fluorescent light tubes, Metal Halide, \nand high-pressure sodium lamps),\
    \ and the Light-emitting diodes \n(LEDs).  Among these, LEDs have gained significant\
    \ popularity \nin the research and development communities due to their \nadvantages\
    \ such as cost efficiency, compact design, durability, \nlight quality, and low\
    \ thermal energy generation.  Research on \nLEDs as a substitute for plant growth\
    \ began in 1980s; however it \nwas only after mid-2000s that they became economically\
    \ feasible \nfor large scale commercial production.  These devices reduce \nthe\
    \ costs of electricity by using plant from effectual \nJanuary, 2018         \

    \ to directed light wavelengths.  \nMoreover, the compact design of LEDs that\
    \ located close to the \nplants, allows the structure of various layers of plant\
    \ production \nto stack vertically in CEA, while decreasing the costs of cooling\
    \ \ncompared with other artificial light sources.  Nowadays the \nfunctional costs\
    \ of LEDs are a high-priority study and advance \nsubject for upcoming greenhouse-based\
    \ plant factories.  In the \ncase of tomatoes, shading affects biosynthesis and\
    \ carotene level \nof lycopene.  According to the study of Cockshull et al.[50],\
    \ plant \nfactory yield will be reduced by 20% by utilizing a cover with \n23%\
    \ shade.  Yields also will be enriched with color shaded in \nplant factories\
    \ in hot weathers.  Yet, color shades can be \ndisadvantageous in areas with limited\
    \ sunlight hours in cloudy \nand cold climates.  In fact, choosing suitable planting\
    \ density \ncan increase crop water output and improve light capture.  On \nthe\
    \ other hand, the planting density has an effect on the harvest of \ntomato in\
    \ greenhouse growing system and evapotranspiration \n(ET)[51].  According to the\
    \ reports of several studies, factors \nsuch as numbers of flowering, fruits location\
    \ in per plant and \nsingle fruit weight were all lesser with more density of\
    \ planting, \ntherefore, resulting in lesser harvests[52-54].  In another study,\
    \ Ilić \net al.[55] showed that in the tomato factory, by using red shade \nnetting\
    \ techniques the lycopene content highly increased, \nhowever, these fruits had\
    \ minor carotene content.  Maximum \nproduction of tomato by percentages of covering\
    \ are described \nunder 40% by El-Aidy and El-Afry[56] and 35% by El-Gizawy et\
    \ \nal.[57] Moreover, El-Gizawy et al.[57] claimed that by increasing \ncovering\
    \ intensity, the production of tomato will increase up to \n51%.  The soil surface\
    \ will lose its moisture in plants faster by \nabsorbing the more radiant energy,\
    \ but, the high density of \ntomato plants caused less radiation at the soil surface[52].\
    \ \n2.3  Efficiency of microclimate controller \nAn efficient greenhouse requires\
    \ environment control for air \nquality, disease reduction, pest control, and\
    \ nutrient and water \nuptake.  The inputs and outs of a greenhouse system are\
    \ shown \nschematically in Figure 3.  The quality of air is governed by \nfactors\
    \ such as air and root-zone temperature, humidity, carbon \ndioxide, air movement,\
    \ dust, odors and disease agents.  Other \nvariables in the greenhouse environment\
    \ that affect plant’s life are \nlight condition, soil feeding solution pH and\
    \ electrical conductivity.  \nThese parameters and the problems associated with\
    \ each have been \nextensively discussed by several textbooks, see for example\
    \ \nHochmuth and Hochmuth[58], Cherie[59] and Jones[60].  Plant \ngrowth responses\
    \ to other influencing factors and climate changes \nsuch as carbon dioxide and\
    \ wind speed have been discussed in the \ntextbook of Morison and Morecroft[61].\
    \  In general, microclimate \nparameters in a CEA are manipulated by passive and\
    \ active \nventilation, \nevaporative \ncooling \ntechniques, \nshadings, \nand\
    \ \nrefrigeration dehumidification.  Several methods based on the \nFans Assessment\
    \ Numeration System (FANS) for evaluation of the \nventilation performance and\
    \ suggestions for the energy efficiency \nof greenhouse fans are presented in\
    \ [62].  It should be noted that \nthe high operating costs of air-conditioners\
    \ make them impractical \nfor commercial application. \n \nFigure 3  Inputs and\
    \ outputs of controlled environment agriculture \n \nThe efficiency of active\
    \ systems, i.e., fan and pad evaporative \ncooling, has been widely studied and\
    \ modeled for modular \ngreenhouses that use mechanical ventilation[63,64], but\
    \ research \nworks on their use alongside natural ventilation in greenhouses in\
    \ \nsemiarid climates are narrow[65].  Reports showed that when \nventilation\
    \ fan belts were adjusted to the proper tension, the fan \nspeed and airflow rate\
    \ were respectively 13.1% and 30.1% higher \nthan those of original belts[62].\
    \  The same study also reports that \nthe daily average energy consumption for\
    \ the ventilation fan with \nthe original loose belts was 20.4% higher than that\
    \ with the \nadjusted belts when the pad was not working, and 24.2% higher \n\
    with pad working.  There are theoretical and experimental studies \nwhich compare\
    \ the effects of fogging and fixed shading systems on \nthe Mediterranean greenhouse\
    \ climate[66]; however, the assessment \nof mobile shading is not well documented.\
    \  In order to determine \nthe size of fans and pads for evaporative cooling,\
    \ the volume of the \ngreenhouse needs to be calculated.  An air exchange (m3/min)\
    \ of 1 \nto 1.5 times of the greenhouse volume is recommended every \nminute[16].\
    \  The number of fans should be selected based on the air \nexchange and by taking\
    \ into account that their placement should \nnot be spaced more than 7.6 m apart.\
    \  According to Duan et al.[67], \na properly operated typical swamp cooler has\
    \ the potential to cool \nair within 3°C to 4°C of the wet-bulb temperature. \
    \ These units \ncost less than air-conditioner and consume 60% to 80% less \n\
    electricity; however, they are only practical for small greenhouses \nin hot dry\
    \ regions.  Another form of evaporative cooling is \nmisting which reduces plant\
    \ moisture loss and leaf transpiration by \nreducing its temperature due to evaporative\
    \ cooling.  Misting is \n6   January, 2018                         Int J Agric\

    \  Vol. 11 No.1 \ncategorized into low-pressure and high-pressure (also known\
    \ as \nfog-cooling).  In fog-cooling systems, high-pressure water is \npassed\
    \ through nozzles with orifice sizes usually less than 10 μm.  \nA fan then blows\
    \ the extremely small droplets of water into \ngreenhouse air and reduces temperature\
    \ through an evaporative \nprocess.  These systems are usually used in greenhouse\
    \ cooling \nfor seed germination and propagation.  A major drawback of this \n\
    method is that it creates high humidity climate inside canopies \nwhich facilitates\
    \ the development of bacterial diseases, such as \nalgae and botrytis.  Several\
    \ recommendations for obtaining \nbetter cooling results with misting are available\
    \ in the work of \nSchnelle and Dole[68].  Low and high-pressure fogging systems\
    \ \nin a naturally ventilated greenhouse have been studied and \ncompared by Li\
    \ and Willits[69], suggesting that compared to the \nlow-pressure fogging system,\
    \ the average evaporation efficiency \nfor the high-pressure system was at least\
    \ 64% greater.  \nMoreover, the cooling efficiency of the high-pressure system\
    \ was \nat least 28% greater than for the low-pressure system.  \nDetermination\
    \ of cooling efficiencies for misting and fogging \nsystems is available in the\
    \ work of Abdel-Ghany and Kozai[70].  \nThe efficiency of an evaporative cooling\
    \ system is calculated by \nout\ncool\nout\nwb\nT\nT\nη\nT\nT\n\n\n\n as given\
    \ in the ASABE standards[71].  Here, Tout \nis the outdoor air temperature, °C;\
    \ Tcool is the temperature of air \nexiting the cooling pad, °C, and Twb is the\
    \ wet-bulb temperature \nof the outside air, °C. \nMeasurement and data analysis\
    \ for greenhouse evaporative \ncooling are discussed in the work of Kittas et\
    \ al.[72] A decrease in \nair temperature by 4°C to 5°C inside a greenhouse with\
    \ \npad-and-fan evaporative cooling is reported by Jain and Tiwari[73].  \nPerformance\
    \ of a two-stage pad cooling system in broiler houses \nwas analyzed by Petek\
    \ et al.[74] showing that the resulting air \ntemperature and relative humidity\
    \ were significantly lower than \nthose of the traditional system.  A thermal\
    \ model for prediction of \nmicroclimate factors inside a greenhouse with mechanical\
    \ \nventilation and the evaporative cooling system was introduced by \nWillits[75].\
    \  Their results suggested that in the presence of \nevaporative cooling, increasing\
    \ canopy size is more influential in \nreducing air temperature.  They also concluded\
    \ that without \nevaporative cooling pads, the ratio of energy used for transpiration\
    \ \nto incoming solar energy (known as the evapotranspiration \ncoefficient) is\
    \ predicted to range from 1-75 for an outdoor air \ntemperature of 36.8°C and\
    \ a humidity ratios of 3.3 g/kg, to 0.8°C \nfor an outdoor humidity ratio of 29.9\
    \ g/kg at the same air \ntemperature.  In another study, Max et al.[76] investigated\
    \ the \neffects of greenhouse cooling methods, including mechanical \nventilation\
    \ and evaporative cooling, on yield and quality of tomato \nin tropical climates.\
    \  It was found that the proportion of \nmarketable yield was significantly higher\
    \ in a net-screen covered \ngreenhouse with mechanical ventilation, and the quantity\
    \ of \nundersized and blossom-end rot affected fruits was reduced in \npolyethylene\
    \ film covered greenhouse with the evaporative cooling \nmethod.  The researchers\
    \ then concluded that in regions with high \nrelative humidity, evaporative cooling\
    \ without customized \nadjustments for dehumidification will not improve closed-field\
    \ \nproduction of tomato. \nPassive cooling methods, including natural ventilation\
    \ and \nshading, are widely practiced in greenhouses, especially those in \ntropical\
    \ regions, by means of non-adjustable, manually adjustable, \nor automatically\
    \ controlled.  Natural ventilation is caused by the \nstack effect, wind ventilation,\
    \ or both.  Ventilation for air \ntemperature control is efficient only when outside\
    \ air temperature \nof the greenhouse is less than inside.  Some of the factors\
    \ to be \ntaken into account for designing of a proper naturally ventilated \n\
    greenhouse are the location of the structure, insulation, ceiling \nslope and\
    \ ventilation openings.  Various references have \nconcluded that using natural\
    \ ventilation, it is more difficult to \nuniformly distribute fresh air in wider\
    \ greenhouse structures[77,78].  \nA comprehensive review of ventilation systems\
    \ is available in the \nworks of Ganguly and Ghosh[79].  The air inlet and outlet\
    \ size for \nnatural ventilation are determined based on stack effect theory as\
    \ \nexpressed by the Equation (1).   The steady-state heat balance for \ndetermination\
    \ of maximum ventilation rate requires heat gains to \nbe equal to heat losses\
    \ and is given by Equation (2).  This \nequation is used to determine: (i) the\
    \ required ventilation rate to \nmaintain a given inside temperature for a given\
    \ heater capacity; (ii) \nthe minimum outside temperature (balance temperature)\
    \ to \nmaintain the desired inside temperature without using supplemental \nheat\
    \ (qh=0) at a given ventilation rate; and (iii) the size of heater \nrequired\
    \ to maintain the desired inside temperature for a given \nventilation rate and\

    \   7 \nmost popular greenhouse monitoring frameworks, the wireless \nsensor networks\
    \ (WSN), and the IoT based systems, which have \nredirected greenhouse measurement\
    \ concentration to a new level \nfor improving efficiency and viability. \n3.1\
    \  Wireless sensor networks \nResearch and development in greenhouses in the early\
    \ 2000s \nbegan to adopt wireless communication technology for monitoring, \n\
    sending early warning messages, and remote control using \nsimplified rules. \
    \ One of the earliest reports of WSN application in \ngreenhouse environment monitoring\
    \ can be found in the work of \nSerôdio \net \nal.[92] \n \nThe \ncompact \nsize,\
    \ \nreliability, \nand \ncost-effectiveness of WSN modules, as well as flexibility\
    \ for \ndeveloping custom applications besides easy installation, have \nmade\
    \ this technology gain attention and popularity for monitoring \nand control in\
    \ open-field[93,94] and in closed-field environment \nagriculture. \n \nSource:\
    \ www.AdaptiveAgroTech.com. \nFigure 4  General components and instrumentations\
    \ in a typical greenhouse environmental monitoring \n \nAn interesting application\
    \ of WSN in greenhouse includes CO2 \nmanagement[95] and multipoint measurements\
    \ of microclimate for \nmonitoring spatial gradients and three-dimensional changes\
    \ in \nparameters during the cultivation process[96].  For example, Ji et \nal.[97]\
    \ developed a WSN for precision control of CO2 fertilizer with \nan improved method\
    \ for prediction of tomato photosynthetic rate.  \nA computerized horticulture\
    \ data management system that is \naddressed in [92] was developed by implementing\
    \ WSN, controller \narea \nnetwork \n(CAN), \nand \nseveral \ninternet \nand \n\
    email \ncommunication tools, and was able to support distributed data \nmonitoring\
    \ and control inside the greenhouse environment.  \nMorais et al.[93] reported\
    \ the architecture of a WSN platform called \nMPWiNodeZ, a mesh-type array of\
    \ acquisition devices that was \ndesigned based on ZigBee multi-powered wireless\
    \ acquisition \ndevice for the purpose of remote sensing applications in precision\
    \ \nhorticulture.  A remarkable advantage of this platform is the \npower management\
    \ capability that allows the system to \ncontinuously operate in large coverage\
    \ areas where connection \nstability and power sources are a concern.  A simple\
    \ deterministic \nWSN based on IEEE 802.15.4 and XMesh protocol for online \n\
    monitoring and control of air temperature and relative humidity \nwith several\
    \ sensors nodes that were placed inside the greenhouse \nin a uniform gridded\
    \ topology is presented in the work of Pahuja et \nal.[98]  The authors used a\
    \ network health analyzer and found that \nwhile the data reliability was 100%,\
    \ their network mean packet \nreliability was between 75%-100% due to the packet\
    \ losses.  This \nfailure can be related to the canopy coverage and sensors occluded\
    \ \nby the dense plantation which reduces the signal strength of the \nnodes.\
    \  This network was integrated into a multiple inputs and \nmultiple outputs fuzzy\
    \ logic based controller and an RS-485 \nactuator network to manipulate the greenhouse\
    \ vapor pressure \ndeficit.  Prima et al.[91] developed and evaluated a simple\
    \ and \nflexible remote environmental monitoring and control based on a \ncloud\
    \ platform.  They implemented a local-global management \nstrategy supporting\
    \ synchronization of online and offline system \nconfiguration, actuation, and\
    \ offline management to respond to the \nunstable network connection in the rural\
    \ area.  They tested the \nfunctionality of their system during a 10-day data\
    \ collection period \nfor automated monitoring of soil moisture content and fertigation\
    \ \ncontrol in tomato cultivation.  Their results showed that under \nunstable\
    \ network, the system only had 0.78% error, and provided \n99.2% in-range soil\
    \ moisture content measurement, which shows \nthe potential for long-term microclimate\
    \ monitoring application in \ngreenhouses.   \nAn important consideration in designing\
    \ of an efficient WSN \nfor the greenhouse is the number of nodes, their location,\
    \ distances \nbetween nodes, antenna and the operating frequency based on the\
    \ \ngreenhouse microclimate condition.  Studies showed that radio \nwave propagation\
    \ is strongly affected by the high greenhouse \nenvironment[99].  Several other\
    \ connectivity issues with WSN in \nthe greenhouse have been addressed in [100]\
    \ using connection \nmatrix to estimate the network connectivity in the disconnected\
    \ \nspots.  For this purpose, Chen et al.[100] established a remote \nmonitoring\
    \ \nsystem \nin \nan \nexperimental \ngreenhouse using \nZigBee-based WSN which\
    \ could monitor air temperature, humidity \nand light intensity as well as the\
    \ wireless link quality.  Their \nresults showed that by adding long-distance\
    \ backup routing nodes, \nnetwork connectivity can be guaranteed in the spots\

    \ based on star and mesh network \narchitecture for monitoring air temperature,\
    \ relative humidity, and \nsoil moisture content inside the greenhouse is available\
    \ in the work \nof Zhou et al.[101] More recently, Azaza et al.[102] presented\
    \ a smart \ntype-2 fuzzy logic based control system to manage the greenhouse \n\
    microclimate with attention to the effectiveness, the energy use and \nthe production\
    \ costs.  They integrated an observer and smart \nautomation system into the control\
    \ process by using a wireless data \nmonitoring platform enabling a distance data\
    \ measurement.  Their \nmethod also provided a real-time data access and building\
    \ database \nthat can be used for future enhancement of the system accuracy and\
    \ \ndecisions making.  The efficiency of their proposed monitoring \nand control\
    \ system was validated through a comparative study by \nevaluating the energy\
    \ saving (22%), and the water use (33%). \n3.2  IoT-based monitoring \nThe traditional\
    \ data monitoring techniques in greenhouse \nfrequently suffer from lack of sharing\
    \ and availability, great \nlabor-intensity, low spatiotemporal resolution, a\
    \ lack of data \ncentralization, and organizational management in observing the\
    \ \nenvironmental aspects of a greenhouse.  The IoT offers an \nexcellent opportunity\
    \ not only in greenhouse environment \nmonitoring but as a method for non-destructive\
    \ quantification of \nphysiological factors of the cultivated plants to be shared\
    \ within a \nnetwork of other greenhouse producers.  The potential \ngreenhouse\
    \ applications of IoT cover a variety of scenarios.  \nGeneral components of a\

    \  General components of a greenhouse environmental monitoring based in wireless\
    \ sensor network and IoT concept \n \nThe main element in the IoT is the network,\
    \ which has made \npossible a breakthrough in data communication and sharing for\
    \ \ngreenhouse monitoring and control.  It contains several physical \nitems,\
    \ software, and sensors that are linked with wires or wirelessly \nthrough standard\
    \ communication protocols[103].  Both academic \nand industry sections have shown\
    \ interest in greenhouse \napplications of IoT[104].  In fact, IoT has been used\
    \ in many areas \nof researchers, such as: smart city[105], agriculture[106,107]\
    \ and \nhealthcare[108-110], and is changing the traditional farming \nobservation\
    \ approaches by quickly providing quantitative data with \neffective spatiotemporal\
    \ resolution.  For example, long-term past \ninformation collected by IoT applications\
    \ can be an offer to a local \ngreenhouse community to conduct combined pest and\
    \ disease \nmanagement agendas in order to stop spreading of the associated \n\
    damages.  These data can also improve cultural practices and \ndecision making\
    \ plans[107].  An application of this technology can \nbe found in the work of\
    \ Liao et al.[111] who developed an IoT \nmonitoring system to simultaneously\
    \ screen the growth condition \nof Phalaenopsis and the environmental features\
    \ of an orchid plant \nfactory.  For example, Peng et al.[112] showed that by\
    \ using a \nspectroscopic and spectrometer investigation can correctly provide\
    \ \nthe total of orchid chlorophyll.   \nMoreover, Lin and Hsu[113] applied a\
    \ chlorophyll fluorometer \nin their study.  The monitored the photosynthetic\
    \ status of \nPhalaenopsis under diverse lighting situations.  Although the \n\
    physiological analysis is often occupied manually, these \nexamination approaches\
    \ need tools with perfect accuracy to \nnondestructively \ndegree \nphysiological\
    \ \nfactors \nof \norchids.  \nFurthermore, because of the cost, farmers will\
    \ not use highly \nprecise tools to measure physiological factors of orchids.\
    \  With \nscalability and flexibility of IoT, growers can have an excellent \n\
    opportunity to meet such observing demands[109]. \n4  Environmental control and\
    \ energy optimization \nThis section reviews some of the recently published works\
    \ on \nthe advances in microclimate modeling and control, greenhouse \nenergy\

    \  The control of the microclimate in a greenhouse is a \nhigh-level task because\
    \ of the number of involved variables that are \ncoupled and interrelated, making\
    \ a complex non-linear system.   \nSome of the earlier attempts to apply advanced\
    \ control \nJanuary, 2018           Shamshiri R R, et al.  Advances in greenhouse\

    \   9 \ntechniques for greenhouse environment can be found in the works \nof Caponetto\
    \ et al.[114], Pan et al.[115], Lin[116], Castañeda-Miranda et \nal.[117] and\
    \ Xu et al.[118] Recent advances in computer simulation \nand artificial intelligence\
    \ have worked their way into greenhouse \nenvironment modeling and predictions.\
    \  Identifications and \nmodellings of different parameters in greenhouses have\
    \ been topics \nof numerous research works that aimed at improving production\
    \ \nefficiency (i.e., higher yield and quality, maximum return) by \nevaluating\
    \ and adjusting microclimate parameters and modeling of \nmicrometeorology[119,120].\
    \  The level of approaches vary from \nsimple models and timer-based feedback\
    \ controls[121,122] to more \nadvanced solutions, such as model-free control strategy[123],\
    \ \nnonlinear control methods[124], adaptive control and adaptive \nmanagement\
    \ framework[120,125], robust[126], optimal control[127-132], \nenergy balance\
    \ models[133], and model-based predictive control[134].  \nAn important drawback\
    \ in utilizing advanced control methods in a \nCEA is the difficulty in developing\
    \ the dynamic model to simulate \nthe behavior of the variables.  Ultimately,\
    \ the goal of any of these \ncontrol systems is to minimize the input cost per\
    \ unit of production \nand to increase the return by achieving high yield and\
    \ quality. \nThe success of greenhouse systems analysis relies on the \neffective\
    \ use of information.  To meet these requirements, various \ncontrol strategies\
    \ based on complex algorithms of artificial \nintelligence have been discussed\
    \ in the literature.  For example, \nfuzzy systems have achieved significant results\
    \ in the area of \nprecision irrigation[135] and microclimate control.  Several\
    \ \ntechniques and approaches have been presented, including \ninverting \nfuzzy\
    \ \nmodel[136], \nreconfigurable \nadaptive \nfuzzy \nfault-hiding \ncontrol[137],\
    \ \nTakagiSugeno \nfuzzy \nmodeling[138], \nconventional fuzzy logic control for\
    \ smart greenhouses[102], and \ndecentralized decoupling fuzzy logic controller[139].\
    \  These \nsolutions have shown a more effective set-point tracking compared \n\
    with \nthe \nconventional \nPID \ncontrollers. \n \nFor \nexample, \nEl-Madbouly\
    \ et al.[137] designed an active fault-tolerant control \nsystem to fix of the\
    \ device or sensor errors in weather system of a \ngreenhouse.  This control scheme\
    \ involves a self-tuned fuzzy \nproportional-integral \n(PI) \ncontrol \nscheme,\
    \ \na \nstrong \nfault-hiding-based reconfigurable controller that can fix the\
    \ faulty \neffects, and a reliable and sensitive observer-based fault detection\
    \ \nand diagnosis (FDD) system for diverse kinds of errors in the \npresence of\
    \ scheme disorderliness.  A set of practical actuators \nand sensors were applied\
    \ in this method to renovate the closed-loop \nconsistency and also to confirm\
    \ correct tracking of resource inputs.  \nAzaza et al.[102] introduced a smart\
    \ fuzzy logic based control \nscheme and upgraded by a special measure to the\
    \ humidity \nrelationship and temperature.  Also, the scheme control was \nimproved\
    \ with wireless information observing platform for \ninformation routing and logging\
    \ which prepares actual time of \ninformation entree. \n4.2  Energy analysis and\
    \ optimization models \nEnergy management strategies for optimizing greenhouse\
    \ \ncost[104] require a comprehensive research and knowledge and \nunderstanding\
    \ of climate condition, greenhouse systems, and \nplants’ requirements.  Some\
    \ of these research involves practicing \ninnovative concepts of energy conservation\
    \ and clean-energy using \nmathematical models[141,142], determining energy load\
    \ using \nbuilding energy simulation models[143], computational fluid \ndynamics\
    \ method[119,144,145], or providing optimal growth condition \nwith \nminimum\
    \ \nenvironmental \nimpacts[120,146,147]. \n \nOther \nresearchers have proposed\
    \ optimization methods for maximizing \nthe returns.  See for example the works[148]\
    \ in which a dynamic \nmodel of a greenhouse tomato and the optimal control problem\
    \ for \nthe seasonal benefit of the grower has been presented.  A \nformulation\
    \ of the optimal control problem for minimizing energy \ninput to the greenhouse\
    \ with a dynamic energy balance was \npresented by van Beveren et al.[149] and\
    \ later expanded in [150] to \ninclude humidity balance.  Incrocci et al.[151]\
    \ proposed that \noptimal CO2 concentration in the greenhouse can be based on\
    \ an \neconomic evaluation.  To maintain a given CO2 concentration \nwithin the\
    \ greenhouse, the supply must balance the assimilated CO2 \nflux to the outside\
    \ air due to ventilation.  Linker et al.[152] \noptimized greenhouse operation\
    \ and in particular CO2 control, \nusing a neural network.  Most of these approaches\
    \ have used crop \nmodels and prices of the harvested product.  van Beveren et\
    \ al.[153] \nexpanded this process further by including a dynamic CO2 balance.\
    \  \nThey reported a method to minimize the total energy that is \nrequired to\
    \ heat and cool a greenhouse.  Their research provides a \nmodel to define bounds\
    \ for temperature, humidity, CO2 \nconcentration, the maximum amount of CO2 available,\
    \ and the \neffect of different bounds on optimal energy input.  The addition\
    \ \nof the dynamic CO2 balance provides a truly integrated approach \nthat takes\
    \ all major aspects of greenhouse climate control into \naccount.  This is important,\
    \ given the trade-off between natural \nventilation and the injection of industrial\
    \ CO2, which occurs in a \ngreenhouse with active cooling.  Nadal et al.[154]\
    \ presented an \nenergy and environmental assessment for a roof-top greenhouse\
    \ \nand showed that their greenhouse achieved an annual saving in CO2 \nemissions\
    \ of 113.8 kg/m2 per year, relative to an equivalent \noil-heated greenhouse.\
    \  Vadiee and Martin[155] developed a \ntheoretical model using TRNSYS to carry\
    \ out greenhouse energy \nanalysis.  From the economic feasibility assessment,\
    \ their results \nshowed that the concept has the potential of becoming cost \n\
    effective.  A literature survey on greenhouse energy analysis[156] \nhas concluded\
    \ that evapotranspiration has a significant impact on \nthe micro-climate[156,157].\
    \  This is true since the amount of \nmoisture that is added to the greenhouse\
    \ environment due to \nevapotranspiration helps moderate the vapor pressure deficit.\
    \ \nCurrent advances in CEA systems tend towards sustainability \nand utilizing\
    \ renewable energy by studying wind power, solar \nthermal applications[142] and\
    \ solar energy conservation[141] to \nreduce fuel consumption[158].  For example,\
    \ in tropical and \nsubtropical conditions, the strategy in microclimate control\
    \ is to \nimprove resource efficiency by benefiting from the potentials of \n\
    natural ventilation and shading[120].  In fact, studies of different \ncontrol\
    \ strategies indicated that smart management of natural \nventilation for manipulating\
    \ the environment under specific \nexterior conditions is an effective approach\
    \ to improve productivity \nand increase benefits[124].  A smart tropical greenhouse\
    \ that \noperates on solar panels and benefits from an adaptive design and \n\
    covering materials (i.e., mesh screens) will maximize the use of \nnatural and\
    \ mechanical ventilation[144, 159-162] and will be less \ndependent \non \nhigher-cost\
    \ \ncooling \nmethods \nsuch \nas \nevaporative[67,163-167] and high pressure\
    \ fogging systems[168].  \nNevertheless, the use of anti-insect screens decreases\
    \ the natural \nventilation capacity and aggravates thermal conditions.  It is\
    \ \ntherefore unrealistic to completely eliminate other means of cooling, \n10\

    \  A comprehensive \nreview of advances in greenhouse microclimate control and\
    \ \nautomation system for tropical regions is available in [169]. \n4.3  Environment\
    \ prediction and yield estimation models \nGreenhouse growers use prediction tools\
    \ for the weather \nforecast, photosynthesis predictions for plant growth progress[170],\
    \ \npredicting disease[171], simulation of yield[172], and production \nplanning\
    \ and cost-benefit analysis.  Some of the earlier examples \nof climate models\
    \ to predict the temperature and humidity inside a \ngreenhouse can be found in\
    \ the works of [7, 173-176].  A thermal \nmodel for prediction of microclimate\
    \ factors inside a greenhouse \nwith mechanical ventilation and an evaporative\
    \ cooling system was \nintroduced by Willits[75].  More recent mathematical models\
    \ for \npredicting greenhouse microclimate from external data have been \naddressed\
    \ in [121, 177-180].  An innovative air temperature \nprediction model based on\
    \ least squares and support vector \nmachine with optimized parameters using an\
    \ improved particle \nswarm optimization (IPSO) technique is presented in [181].\
    \  The \nauthors compared and validated the performance of their model \nwith\
    \ conventional modeling techniques by predicting the air \ntemperature in a solar\
    \ greenhouse.  Another example is KASPRO, \nan advanced dynamic model for microclimate\
    \ prediction in \ngreenhouses[176,182].  This model consists of sub-functions\
    \ based \non mass and energy balance of the greenhouse environment.  A \ndetailed\
    \ description of this model is presented in the work of \nRigakis et al.[78] This\
    \ model was used by Graamans et al.[183] to \ndescribe crop transpiration and\
    \ energy balance in plant factories by \ndetermining vapor flux and the relation\
    \ between latent and sensible \nheat exchange for production of lettuce. \nSustainable\
    \ development of modern greenhouse production \nsystems also requires yield estimation\
    \ models and knowledge- \nbased information software for adaptive management of\
    \ resources.  \nSince it is impossible to actually plant and experiment with every\
    \ \nsingle greenhouse design and climate scenario, mathematical \nmodels for simulation\
    \ of yields and growth responses are \nessential for achieving high yield at low\
    \ cost.  These models can \nalso contribute to the optimization and management\
    \ of \ngreenhouse energy under adverse climate conditions.  An early \nexample\
    \ includes the work of Gary et al.[184] in which an \neducational software called\
    \ SIMULSERRE for simulating \ngreenhouse plant system was developed.  Some of\
    \ the \nwell-known simulation models for tomato plants include \nTOMSIM[185],\
    \ TOMPOUSSE[186,187] and TOMGRO[188,189].  A \ncommon weakness with these models\
    \ is that their parameters are \nspecific for the climate condition and greenhouse\
    \ design that they \nwere derived from.  In addition, because of the complexity\
    \ of \nthe interactions between the greenhouse elements and the crop \nitself,\
    \ it is often impossible to correctly predict microclimate \neffects on the final\
    \ yield with the same model parameters.  One \nof the most widely accepted yield\
    \ simulation models is the \nTOMGRO[189] in which the author claimed that “it\
    \ is possible to \nuse the same reduced model with parameters estimated at one\
    \ \nlocation to simulate leaf area and above-ground weight of tomato \ngrowing\
    \ in greenhouse conditions in other locations”.  The first \nversion of TOMGRO[188]\
    \ and the third version[190], respectively \nhad 69 and 574 state variables for\
    \ simulation of tomato growth on \nthe basis of three inputs that are measured\
    \ inside greenhouse \nenvironment: \nthe \nphotosynthetically \nactive \nradiation,\
    \ \nmmol/(m2·s), air temperature, °C and CO2 concentration, ppm.  \nA simplified\
    \ version of TOMGRO[189] was developed with the \nobjective of providing a practical\
    \ application and only has five \nsteady-state variables: (i) node number for\
    \ the main stem, (ii) leaf \narea index, (iii) total plant dry weight (WT), (iv)\
    \ total fruit dry \nweight (WF), and (v) mature fruit dry weight (WM).  Jones\
    \ et \nal.[189] provided simulation results for three tomato varieties \nincluding\
    \ DeRuiters, Beefsteak, and Bigboy respectively for three \nexperiment locations\
    \ at Gainesville (Florida), Avignon (France) \nand Lake City (Florida).  Some\
    \ of the studies related to \nevaluation and adaptation of TOMGRO model to specific\
    \ climate \nconditions and cultural practices can be found in the works of \n\
    [172, 191, 192].  It should be noted that the simplified \nTOMGRO model only takes\
    \ into account the effect of air \ntemperature and light condition, and other\
    \ important variables \nsuch as CO2 concentration were not included in this version.\
    \  In \naddition, Jones et al.[189] did not take the work any farther than \n\
    making the model calculations in an Excel spreadsheet, hence the \nmodel could\
    \ not be used directly with other models to control \ngreenhouse environments.\
    \  To fill this gap, Shamshiri et al.[193] \nevaluated and verified the performance\
    \ of the reduced state \nvariable version of TOMGRO model of Jones et al.[189]\
    \ using \nboundary data that were expected to result in zero yield output.  \n\
    The hypothesis was to test whether the model parameters are \nrobust enough to\
    \ translate an adverse greenhouse environment \n(with air temperature so high\
    \ to prevent any crop growth \ndevelopment) to realistic biomass and yield.  For\
    \ this purpose, \nShamshiri et al.[193] converted the model from spreadsheets\
    \ \nformat to Matlab Simulink (The MathWorks Inc, Natick, MA, \nUSA), provided\
    \ a user interface to access the TOMGRO inputs \nand outputs, and replaced the\
    \ lengthy calculation procedures of \nMicrosoft Excel with one-click step operation\
    \ in Matlab.  This \nSimulink model of Shamshiri et al.[193] provided a flexible\
    \ \nplatform for individuals unfamiliar with computer programming \nlanguages\
    \ and crop modeling to have an easy access to the \nTOMGRO model functionality.\
    \  It was shown that the designed \nSimulink model can be used reliably as a replacement\
    \ for the \nspreadsheet version of TOMGRO model.  Additional research \nworks\
    \ with experimental and simulated based studies for \ninvestigating the effects\
    \ of structure design, covering materials \nand \ncontrol \nsystems \non \ngreenhouse\
    \ \nmicroclimate, \ncrop \ntranspiration, and expected yields are available in\
    \ the works of \n[51, 55, 76, 120, 193, 194]. \n4.4  Decision support systems\
    \ \nThe management of production in a greenhouse requires \ndecision making on\
    \ several tasks and time scales.  These \ndecisions are mainly related to management\
    \ of the crop growth \nconditions[195], the culture period and practice such as\
    \ seedling \nproduction[196], event-based irrigation[197] and the control and\
    \ \nmanagement \nof \nenvironment \nbased \ngrowth \nmodels[198].  \nResearch\
    \ and development in decision support system (DSS) for \ngreenhouse application\
    \ began during the 1990s, primarily for \nrecommending microclimate reference\
    \ values and set-points, and \nfor pest and disease management.  Early studies\
    \ included the \nworks of Fisher et al.[199], Clarke et al.[195] and Sun et al.[200].\
    \  A \nDSS was built by Tchamitchian et al.[201] based on the \nJanuary, 2018\

    \ \nabout the climate control regime that can quantify the energy \ncosts based\
    \ on different control strategies.  More recent studies \ncan be found in the\
    \ works of Cañadas et al.[203] and Aiello et al.[204] \nAn interactive decision\
    \ support system (DSS) developed by \nShort et al.[205] based on the HYTODMOD\
    \ growth response \nmodel of El-Attal[206] is available to describe the optimality\
    \ \ndegrees of air temperature and relative humidity at five growth \nstages and\
    \ under three light conditions (night, sun and cloud).  \nThese functions were\
    \ tested and validated by four independent \nexpert growers and were results of\
    \ experiments with tomato \ncultivar “Carusso” in an A-Shade greenhouse located\
    \ at the Ohio \nAgriculture Research and Development Center with a floor area\
    \ \nof 7.3 m2.  In order to build a model for defining the optimality \ndegrees\
    \ of VPD at different light conditions and growth stages of \ntomato, Shamshiri\
    \ et al.[207] integrated the growth response model \nof El-Attal[206] and developed\
    \ the OptVPD model (Figure 6) with \na series of membership function that take\
    \ VPD (kPa) as input, and \ngenerate a real number between 0 and 1 as output.\
    \  The effects \nof air temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH) on the \noptimality\
    \ degree of VPD based on this model are shown in \nFigure 6.  The knowledge behind\
    \ these functions and the \noptimal and failure microclimate values were condensed\
    \ from \nextensive peer-reviewed \nscientific published \nresearch on \ngreenhouse\
    \ cultivation of tomato and physiology, with the goal of \nsimultaneously achieving\
    \ high yield and high-quality fruit.  \nShamshiri et al.[120] extended and implemented\
    \ TOMGRO model \nin SIMULINK and interfaced it with the HYTODMOD and \nOptVPD\
    \ for microclimate evaluation and yield estimation (Figure \n7).  The interfaced\
    \ HYTODMOD, OptVPD, and TOMGRO \nmodels can be used as a DSS tool for evaluation\
    \ purpose by \nexploring \noptimality \ndegrees \nof \nthe \nmicroclimate \nand\
    \ \nmacroclimate parameters as well as yield estimation depending \non the growth\
    \ stage of the plant and different light condition.  It \nallows growers to manually\
    \ change the values of the growing \nparameters as well as the growth stages and\
    \ receive a feedback by \nmeans of a number between 0 and 1 representing how close\
    \ that \nparameter is to high yield and high quality.  An application of \nthis\
    \ DSS has been presented for dynamic assessment[208], \nmeasuring optimality degrees[46],\
    \ and comparative evaluation of \nmicroclimate parameters[193] in greenhouses\
    \ with different \ncovering materials.  Microclimate evaluation with VPD \ninfluences\
    \ the energy costs involved in greenhouse cultivation \nand must be taken into\
    \ account in humidity and temperature \ncontrol algorithms.  A more in-depth analysis\
    \ and practical \nexamples of this DSS is presented by Shamshiri et al.[120] via\
    \ an \nadaptive management framework.  This framework provides a \nflexible platform\
    \ for altering each participating variables in the \ngreenhouse.  It simulates\
    \ growth and environment responses in \ndifferent light condition, growth stages,\
    \ growing season and \nlocation.  The result is a cost-benefit analysis that shows\
    \ at what \nlevel each combination of variables is close to the optimal \nrequirements.\

    \ (UA) \nThe fast growth of global population is changing the food \nproduction\
    \ systems to keep up with the growing demands.  \nAgricultural innovation and\
    \ research in the past three decades, \ncombined with the advances in information\
    \ technology have \nintroduced promising cultivation techniques that are valuable\
    \ for \nsustainability and economic viability of CEA.  Ellis[209] described \n\
    that throughout the history, agriculture has always been associated \nwith urban\
    \ centers, much more than it is imagined today.  While \ntraditional and modern\
    \ agriculture have been separated in the upper \nlayers, they are still attached\
    \ to each other in the roots.  Today, \nfood, as well as animal livestock, is\
    \ surrounding us everywhere, \nand the question about the origin of this supply\
    \ is not a concern \nanymore.  By the late 2000s, major cities reached the point\
    \ that \nmost people did not even need to associate food with natural \nresources[210].\
    \ \nThe concepts in UA and the associated facilities have \nreceived significant\
    \ attention and popularity in the last 8 years, \nand are growing to meet the\
    \ needs of the ever-developing urban \nlife.  A variety of systems may fall under\
    \ UA concept in \ndifferent scale and possession (Figure 8), ranging from a personal\
    \ \nor local community gardens for social and self-sufficiency \npurposes, to\
    \ complicated systems which involve indoor food \nproduction with the help of\
    \ artificial light or inside factories that \nare capable of controlling the climate\
    \ to produce sensitive plants.  \nSince UA is mostly practiced indoors, it is\
    \ also referred as \nvertical farming (VF)[211], integrated farming inside buildings[212],\
    \ \nand Z-farming (which stands for ZeroAcreageFarming)[213].  \nThis type of\
    \ food production is entering all cities in the world and \nhas attracted public\
    \ interest.  There are new consumers’ needs \nfor fresh food of good quality with\
    \ no damage to nature.  \nSeveral reports indicated that more projects are involved\
    \ in \nbringing farming products into cities[214,215].  “UA is an industry \n\
    that makes, processes and markets food and fuel, mostly in \nreaction to the daily\
    \ need for consumers in a town, city, or \nmetropolitan areas, on land and on\
    \ water spread in the urban and \nsemi-urban area, by employing many methods of\
    \ production, \nusing and recycling natural resources and city wastes to produce\
    \ a \nvariety of products and livestock”[216-219].  In fact, UA is a \nfarming\
    \ movement in the cities for circulation of food and \nnon-food plants and tree\
    \ products.  Some of the suggested \nsolutions for a closed-field production system\
    \ in UA are the plant \nfactories, vertical farming (VA), and rooftop greenhouses.\

    \ a city center \n \n5.1  Vertical farming and rooftop greenhouses \nThe concept\
    \ of VF is not new.  Kaplan[220] explained that VF \nhas been unknown for a long\
    \ time, and was then brought to \nattention in the recent years through the advances\
    \ in technology.  \nLife magazine has published one of the very first sketches\
    \ of a tall \nconstruction that promotes agricultural products for people daily\
    \ \nfood requests as early as 1909.  In 1915, the American geologist \nGilbert\
    \ Ellis Bailey used the concept of the tall multi-story \nbuildings for indoor\
    \ cultivation.  He created the term “Vertical \nFarming” in his book with the\
    \ same title as “Vertical Farming”[221].  \nDesigners and landscape architects\
    \ have frequently looked into the \nconcept, particularly at the end of the 20th\
    \ century.  During the \n1970s until the early 1980s, the Malaysian-born architect,\
    \ Ken \nYeang improved and advanced the ideas of Bailey into an \narchitectural\
    \ project[222,223].  It is called Bioclimatic Skyscraper \n(Menara Mesiniaga)\
    \ that was built in 1992.  In 1993, Nancy Jack \nTodd and John Todd envisioned\
    \ the idea of VF in their book \nentitled “From Eco-Cities to Living Machines”.\
    \  The most recent \nand greatest challenging form of this idea however appeared\
    \ in \n1999 by Dickson Despommier’s, an Emeritus Professor of \nMicrobiology at\
    \ the Columbia University, speculating that a \n30-floor farm on one city block\
    \ could provide food for 50 000 \npeople with vegetables, fruit, eggs and meat,\
    \ explaining that \nhydroponic crops could be grown on upper floors; and the lower\
    \ \nfloors would be suited for chickens and fish that eat plants waste.  \nIn\
    \ the concept of VF, heat and lighting would be provided by \ngeothermal, tidal,\
    \ solar, or other recyclable sources of energy.  \nNitrogen along with other nutrients\
    \ would be sieved from animal \nwaste and maybe from the urban sewage system.\
    \  It should be \nnoted that until 2010, there was no report of evidence for VF\
    \ \nconstruction before it began emerging in USA, Singapore, Japan, \nand Korea.\
    \  In theory, VF is the technique that includes \nlarge-scale food production\
    \ in skyscrapers that makes rapid growth \nand planned production possible through\
    \ managing nutrient \nsolution of crop and the growth context according to hydroponics\
    \ \nmethods.  With the help of cutting-edge greenhouse approaches, \nthese buildings\
    \ can be used as a precision farming system that \npaves the way for the acquisition\
    \ of a safe crop growth through \ncontrolling and supervising of the microenvironment\
    \ using sensors, \ninterfacing gadgets and instrumentation[210,213,224-227]. \n\
    In the recent years, the majority of scientific publications in \nUA have focused\
    \ on different aspects of the VF concept.  For \nexample, Sivamani et al.[228]\
    \ studied the viability of smart \ntechnology used in agriculture as an opportunity\
    \ to be used for \nVF[228,229].  Research findings have shown that VF is a promising\
    \ \ntechnique for providing food for cities in a sustainable way.  \nHowever,\
    \ it is also a function of the location and design[229].  It is \nmentioned that\
    \ VF is a way of feeding and at the same time a \nmovement in the society to reduce\
    \ greenhouse gas emission[219,230].  \nA common debate about VF is the compromising\
    \ between the \nbuilding structure and the returns.  Some estimates that an \n\
    abandoned building can be adapted to the needs of VA, while other \nbelieves that\
    \ only buildings with new design will satisfy that need.  \nA study by Kalantari\
    \ et al.[231] presented several effective VF \nprojects in different countries\
    \ by estimating their feasibility and \nviability in various geographical areas.\
    \  The data was shaped \nbased on the technology of different VF in different\
    \ climate areas.  \nIt was shown by Kalantari et al.[231] that every VF has its\
    \ own \ntechnologies and techniques according to the different geographical \n\
    locations.  Table 1 presents the details of some of effective VF \nprojects in\
    \ different countries and shows the different areas by their \ntype of building\
    \ and typologies.  An interesting example includes \nthe conceptual design of\
    \ the Urban Sky-farm for downtown of \nSeoul is shown in Figure 9 with different\

    \ of the 2013 \ngreen dot design competition.  The key concept of a vertical farm\
    \ \nis to yield as much crop as possible under optimal circumstances, \neven in\
    \ the center of cities.  Thus, the VF shown in Figure 9 \nincludes many floors\
    \ with a variety of crops on each.  Different \ncrops need different environmental\
    \ conditions.  Therefore, tracing \na crop and its location is of a great significance[228].\
    \ \nVertical farms can be diverse from city to city and their \nstructures also\
    \ vary around the world[210].  The other two \nconceptual designs for vertical\
    \ farms are shown in Figure 10. The \nfirst design (Figure 10a) was designed by\
    \ ODESIGN group for \nAustralia. The other type of VF called urban farming units\
    \ (UFU) \nis shown in Figure 10b, a farm within shipping containers that can \n\
    produce organic fish, fruits, and vegetables in the street. The entire \nprototypes\
    \ are rooted in circular agriculture techniques. The main \ngoals of UFU are to\
    \ find a way to grow food under polluted and \nlimited ground[232]. Figure 10b\
    \ shows a conceptual design of an \nAquaponics farm with fish tanks that can be\
    \ placed inside or close \nto the plant in different levels of the farm.  In this\
    \ system, the \nplants clean and purify the water for the fish, and in return,\
    \ fish \nfeed the plants with their waste as a source of nutrients.  The \nFreight\
    \ Farms in Table 1 is also an example of a vertical farm in a \nshipping container.\
    \ \nAnother solution for UA is the rooftop greenhouse (RTG) and \nbuilding integrated\
    \ rooftop greenhouse (i-RTG) concept.  It is \ndefined as a greenhouse constructed\
    \ on top of a building, usually \nmatched with soilless culture systems[233].\

    \ the greenhouse and building (i.e., energy saving), \nglobal advantages (as the\
    \ effect on climate change decrease), local \nadvantages (such as naturalization\
    \ of urban areas), integrations and \nadaptations with the building, as well as\
    \ production benefits \n(including the accessibility of high quality food).  These\
    \ structures \ncan optimize the energy, water, and CO2 flows only when the RTG\
    \ \nand the building are capable of exchanging air and can harvest the \nrainwater\
    \ or make use of the decently treated grey water for the \npurpose of irrigation.\
    \  Some experimental research indicated that \ni-RTG has failed to provide proper\
    \ light transmission[236], resulting \nin low radiation use efficiency (RUE),\
    \ however this issue is not \nconcerning RTG structure.  In comparison to traditional\
    \ greenhouses \nin the region, which are generally unheated, a primary advantage\
    \ of \ni-RTG is their better and more uniform temperature regime, owing \nto the\
    \ thermal links to the building.  This is an obvious benefit for \nenergy saving\
    \ over the conventional ground greenhouses.  Some \nof the examples of RTG farming\

    \ are usually used for commercial production of \nleafy greens, but their potential\
    \ remains uncertain.  A general \nstructure design of a plant factory and corresponding\
    \ components \nsections are shown in Figure 11.  In order to achieve economic\
    \ \nviability, the increased resource productivity and/or the value of \nadditional\
    \ services in these structures would have to outweigh the \ndisadvantage of the\
    \ absence of solar energy.  Plant factories have \nbeen primarily used in Asia\
    \ to refer to a commercial plant production \nfactory similar in operations to\
    \ an ordinary industrial firm.  Some \nof the technological instrumentations and\
    \ equipment supporting \nthese factories for deriving the plants to their maximum\
    \ potentials \nare precision sensors, nutrition solution, process controllers,\
    \ \nautomated instruments, computer systems, and environmental \nsupervision along\
    \ with implementation of DSS and task \nmanagement software.  Moreover, a number\
    \ of plant factories also \nbenefits from robotic systems for sorting, transferring,\
    \ and handling \nof the plants, as well as quality control, and post-harvesting.\
    \  Because \nof the relatively higher economic investment that is required for\
    \ \nplant factories, they are managed with resource efficiency and \nproduction\
    \ predictability to attain market-valuable crops. \nIn the Japanese context, there\
    \ existed 165 plant factories which \nare using artificially lighting combined\
    \ with natural solar lights[237].  \nAdditional sub-system might be required in\
    \ plant factories for air \nexchange to eliminate the temperature increase due\
    \ to the artificial \nlight.  Plant factories which have full artificial light\
    \ sources \nusually utilize opaque building materials.  This would offer a \n\
    chance to have the walls and roofs well resistant which makes \ncontrolling the\
    \ internal temperature easier and helps conserve the \nenergy.  Furthermore, often\
    \ the skin facade of the building is \ncovered by a self-cleaning and transparent\
    \ material such as \nEthylene Tetra Fluoro Ethylene (ETFE).  In addition, a material\
    \ \nwhich is highly clear and a high thermal rate are required to \nincrease the\
    \ intensity of sunlight that enters the building.  ETFE is \nlight enough as it\
    \ enjoys only 1% weight of an equal-sized piece of \nglass.  However, it lets\
    \ in 95% of light.  There exists a different \nintensity of pressure between the\
    \ ETFE layers.  Such a pressure \nhelps to close and open the screens so as to\
    \ change the passage of \nsunlight[209].  ETFE which is a standardized construction\
    \ material \nhas been used on an extensive surface of ethereal domes in the \n\
    Eden Project in the south of England[14,238]. \nStudies showed that quantitative\
    \ blue light was able to improve \nphotosynthetic performance or growth through\
    \ motivating \nmorphological as well as physiological responses.  Miyagi et \n\
    al.[239] showed that synergistic effects of monochromic LED \ntogether with high\
    \ CO2 and nutrients can enhance lettuce growth in \na plant factory.  Shimokawa\
    \ et al.[240] concluded that red and blue \nirradiation used at the same time\
    \ improve plant growth more than \nmonochromatic \nand \nfluorescent \nlight \n\
    irradiation. \n \nThese \nresearchers also observed that alternatively use of\
    \ red and blue light \naccelerated plant growth dramatically, with the fresh weight\
    \ of a \nrandomly measured plant that was found to be two times as much \nas the\
    \ usual LED production methods.  The bacterial biofertilizers \nused in plant\
    \ factories may positively affect plant growth in several \n16   January, 2018\

    \ \nFigure 11  General structure design of a plant factory \n \n5.3  Opportunities\
    \ and challenges \nVertical farming entails producing plants in a soil-less culture\
    \ \nwith nutrient solution and deals with problems concerning the use \nof soils,\
    \ including the need for herbicides, pesticides, and \nfertilizers and then it\
    \ supplies healthy organic food which is free \nfrom \nchemicals[213]. \n \nAnother\
    \ \nprivilege \nis \nto \nremove \ntransportation costs and CO2 production which\
    \ accompany the \ncarry-over of foods far away to somewhere near the consumer.\
    \  \nMoreover, products can be provided all-year-round corresponding \nto people’s\
    \ demand.  Furthermore, plant-production conditions \ncan be improved to increase\
    \ the yield by adjusting temperature, \nhumidity, and lighting conditions precisely.\
    \  Indoor agriculture \nin a controlled setting also needs much less water than\
    \ outdoor \nfarming as it involves recycling the graywater and lowering the \n\
    evaporation.  Together with the regulation of temperature and \nhumidity, it can\
    \ also decrease or omit the effects of seasonality.  \nFreshwater is increased\
    \ through the evaporation of black and \ngraywater in order to preserve water\
    \ resources.  Moreover, \nrecycled water obtained from rain can be innovatively\
    \ reused.  \nRecycling and dehumidifying strategies can be used for the city’s\
    \ \nwater supplies.  Similarly, aeroponic and hydroponic systems \ncan help raise\
    \ the efficiency of water consumption to 97% in \ncomparison to traditional agriculture[242].\
    \  Moreover, a constant \nflow of air is produced through air conditioning that\
    \ can be \nenhanced with carbon dioxide (CO2) so as to contribute to plant \n\
    growth even more.  Both environmental parameters and nutrient \nuptake may be\
    \ kept at certain levels that improve the speed of \nplant growth.  It was mentioned\
    \ that plants will have a better \nevapotranspiration and yield with the modification\
    \ of bandwidth \nof LED lighting.   \nUA, VF, RTG and plant factories provide\
    \ a unique opportunity \nfor reducing fossil fuels by utilizing solar panels,\
    \ roof-top wind \nturbines, or storage batteries[242,243] as shown schematically\
    \ in \nFigure 12.  The economic benefits of vertical farms include the \nreduction\
    \ of the cost of energy, lowering of food price, and an \neconomic opportunity\
    \ to secure land and return investments to the \ninvestor through protecting floods,\
    \ droughts, or damage caused by \nthe sun.  New job opportunities can be created\
    \ by VF in \nengineering, \nbiochemistry, \nbiotechnology, \nconstruction, \n\
    maintenance and research, with the chances to improve the \ntechnology.  Moreover,\
    \ the social benefits of VF are diverse and \ninvolve the psychological, and spiritual\
    \ health of the community, \nsuch as education, leisure, and more social communication\
    \ and \nhealthier food habits[213,242,244]. \n \nFigure 12  Conceptual design\
    \ for adaptation of renewable energy \nfor commercial development of sustainable\
    \ CEA and plant \nfactories \n \nSeveral researchers have claimed that, in a VF\
    \ system, the \nplants on the upper sections of the structure will only benefit\
    \ from \nsolar radiation, and that the energy supplied by the photovoltaics \n\
    solar panel may be restricted, or not justified cost wise[225].  \nHowever, solar\
    \ panels are now more efficient in generating energy, \nJanuary, 2018        \

    \ agriculture                Vol. 11 No.1   17 \nand the introduction of new affordable\
    \ and energy efficient LED \nlighting is an accepted substitute to compensate\
    \ the lack of natural \nlight.  We mentioned earlier that the LED sources are\
    \ capable of \nincreasing the yield in greenhouse context significantly because\
    \ of \nmatching spectral features with plant type and physiology[229,242].  \n\
    In addition, extra sun exposure is also possible through stacked \nlevels of plants\
    \ that can be rotated within one high-rise closed-space. \nThe extra cost of VF\
    \ start-ups can be resolved if the supporting \nstructures are not built on the\
    \ expensive central business districts, \nhowever there are still several challenges\
    \ with VF.  Indeed, the \nprimary costs of establishing, equipping and implementing\
    \ a VF \nare certainly high and are mostly accounted for energy \nconsumption.\
    \  The number and variety of crops grown is not as \nmany as in rural farming.\
    \  The quantity and loads of the crops are \nalso not as much as in the open-field\
    \ cultivation.  There are other \nchallenges too such as the need for disruption\
    \ management to the \nrural sector, to raise investment capital, and to train\
    \ workforce.  \nThese costs will be lowered through the time, particularly those\
    \ \nconcerning energy provision.  Abel[210] also mentioned that \nalthough establishing\
    \ VF is very costly at the beginning, but when \nit is well-established and fully\
    \ operated, the price of food will be \nlowered.  According to Despommier[14],\
    \ there are many \nappropriate locations for VF projects in every city and if\
    \ these \nlocations are used efficiently, they are able to return and circulate\
    \ \nlarge sums of money to the city[245].  It is concluded by Voss[246] \nthat\
    \ assessing all conditions on every level is essential, in order to \nthoroughly\
    \ consider all possibilities and then to decide on the \nestablishment of a VF.\
    \  Furthermore, VF as a concept is a \npromising move along the right path for\
    \ the fans of the \nrevolutionary resource-based economy movement.  Economic \n\
    analysis, along with the exploration of the impact of VF on \npost-industrial\
    \ cities can be topics of future studies. \n6  Conclusions \nUrbanization and\
    \ living in multi-story buildings request a \nredefinition of agricultural awareness\
    \ for securing food supply.  \nThe economic viability of traditional greenhouses\
    \ in this new \nscenario is likely to fade in the coming decades.  A trend in\
    \ the \npast 15 years of published literature showed that researchers and \ngreenhouse\
    \ growers have become more interested in shifting \ntowards smart controlled environment\
    \ agriculture.  The research \nconcentration has shifted from instrumentation\
    \ control and \nhardware-software interfacing to other scopes, such as simulating\
    \ \nthe interactions between microclimate parameters and plant growth.  \nResearchers\
    \ in this field are developing complex mathematical \nmodels to minimize energy\
    \ inputs, or are interested in finding \ninnovative solutions for replacing the\
    \ fossil energy consuming \ngreenhouses with energy neutral CEA systems that operate\
    \ on solar \nand wind power.  The main aspect that requires improvements in \n\
    this field is the task planning algorithms.  Path planning is well \nknown, but\
    \ to provide the CEA with an adaptive design and control \nstrategy that forms\
    \ the right shape and perform the right task at the \nright time, while increasing\
    \ profits and remaining competitive in \nthe market is still a challenge.  This\
    \ research presented an \noverview \nof \nmodern \ngreenhouses, \ncontrolled \n\
    environment \nagriculture and their derivatives, and highlighted some of the \n\
    advances in environmental monitoring, control, and optimization.  \nWhile biological\
    \ sensors, like those that measures plant stress are \nthe key to such high-level\
    \ of automation, this technology is either \nvery expensive for local growers\
    \ to afford, or even not available.  \nIn addition, it is not clearly well known\
    \ the cost of increased \nautomation relative to increase in profitability.  Therefore,\
    \ another \narea helping sustainability is knowledge based and decision making\
    \ \nsupport systems, i.e., model based computer applications that \naddress the\
    \ cost benefit for a proposed automation technology.  \nThis paper highlighted\
    \ some the most recent technological \nadvances for closed-field agriculture by\
    \ reviewing the applications \nof plant factories and rooftop greenhouses.  Some\
    \ of the \nconceptual designs in this context were introduces along with \nseveral\
    \ existing commercial examples to show the trends in \ndeveloping sustainable\
    \ farming system in the center of dense cities.  \nBased on the review literature,\
    \ this study concludes that a more \naccurate economic analysis and justifications\
    \ of the high startup \ncosts involved with vertical farming and plant factories\
    \ are required \nbefore large-scale commercial development.  The computer \nsimulation\
    \ models and adaptive analysis software are already \navailable for greenhouses\
    \ and CEA systems can be extended and \nmodified for this purpose.  The cost of\
    \ increased automation level \nrelative to increases in profitability is a key\
    \ consideration, and \nshould form part of future study to justify the implementation\
    \ of a \ngreater level of automation. \n \n[References] \n[1] \nTing K C, Lin\

    \ significance for arid and semiarid \narea. According to the special environment\
    \ of greenhouse, a fuzzy control \nalgorithm was proposed to make an optimal irrigation\
    \ strategy based on the \nactual measured soil humidity during the whole plant\
    \ growth process. The \nfuzzy control system had two inputs (soil humidity error\
    \ and its rate) and one \noutput (water level difference). In this paper, the\
    \ fuzzy control algorithm was \nintroduced in detail which included the setting\
    \ of input and output, the selection \nof membership function and the setting\
    \ of fuzzy rules. The fuzzy control system \nwas meaningful to the smart water-saving\
    \ irrigation in greenhouse. \nKeywords: soil humidity, fuzzy control algorithm,\
    \ irrigation, greenhouse.  \n1 \nIntroduction \nWater is one of our precious natural\
    \ resources. Water-saving irrigation is of great \nsignificance because there\
    \ are many arid and semiarid areas in the word. The key in \nwater-saving irrigation\
    \ is striking to get balance for optimal plant grown with optimal \nusage of water.\
    \ Many water-saving technologies were proposed  by the researchers [1], \nsuch\
    \ as drip irrigation [2] ,subsurface drip irrigation [3] and subsurface negative\
    \ \nirrigation[4]. There were many research works which focused on the affection\
    \ of \ndifferent irrigation methods to crop. In order to find better irrigation\
    \ scheduling with the \ncompromise between high yield and great quality of greenhouse-grown\
    \ tomato under \nlimit water supply, two experiments of different irrigation treatments\
    \ were conducted in \nthe arid region of northwest China during spring to summer\
    \ in 2008 (2008 season)and \nwinter in 2008 to summer in 2009 [4]. Because the\
    \ irrigation water use efficiency was \nvery importance, the technical efficiency\
    \ of unheated greenhouse farms in Tunisia was \nmeasured, and proposed a measure\
    \ for irrigation water use efficiency (WUE) using an \nalternative form of the\
    \ data envelopment analysis [5]. Application of the temporal and \nspatial deficit\
    \ irrigation in field-grown crops had greater potential in saving water, \nmaintaining\
    \ economic yield and improving WUE [6]. \nMany conventional methods for controlling\
    \ greenhouse irrigation were not \neffective since they were either based on on-off\
    \ control methods or proportional \n                                         \
    \                  \n* Corresponding author. \n \nDesign of Fuzzy Control Algorithm\
    \ for Precious Irrigation System in Greenhouse \n279 \ncontrol methods which resulted\
    \ in a loss of energy and productivity. A solution for an \nirrigation controller\
    \ based on the fuzzy-logic methodology was presented [7]. The \ndeveloped fuzzy\
    \ logic controller could effectively estimate the amount of water \nuptake of\
    \ plants in distinct depth using the reliable irrigation model, evaporation \n\
    functions, environmentally conditions of the greenhouse, soil type, plant type\
    \ and \nother factors affecting the irrigation of greenhouse. A fuzzy irrigation\
    \ decision-\nmaking system was established by using virtual instrumentation platform\
    \ [8]. The \nexperiment results showed that the system had friendly interface\
    \ and was easy to use; \nit could give comprehensive judgment and decision-making,\
    \ and provide scientific \nbasis for water saving irrigation. In our case, the\
    \ irrigation system was very different. \nThe optimal water volume for plants\
    \ was affected by many physical parameters \nsuch as air temperature, soil humidity,\
    \ wind and stage of plant grown. Soil humidity \nwas an important irrigation indicator\
    \ to ensure the crop growing well. Because \nenvironment was controllable in greenhouse,\
    \ some outside parameters were constant \nsuch as air temperature and wind. As\
    \ for the irrigation system which was applied in \ngreenhouse, the change of soil\
    \ humidity was the most importance and direct \nparameter for irrigation strategy\
    \ which included irrigation time and the irrigation \nvolume. The fuzzy control\
    \ algorithm was proposed for greenhouse precision irrigation \nsystem in this\
    \ paper. \n2 \nMaterials and Methods  \nThe soil water movement and distribution\
    \ in soil was seriously affected by the \nirrigation strategy. In this paper,\
    \ a precision irrigation system was used. The precision \nirrigation system consisted\
    \ of five parts: a plant container, a built-in reservoir, a level \ncontrol tank,\
    \ a reservoir and a height adjuster. The scheme of precision irrigation \nsystem\
    \ was shown in Fig. 1. \n \nFig. 1. The scheme of precision irrigation system\
    \  \n①the plant container; ②the built-in reservoir; ③ the level control tank;\
    \ ④ the reservoir; ⑤ \nthe height adjuster; ⑥ the fuzzy controller in computer.\
    \ \nThe soil humidity of plant container was affected by the water level difference\
    \ \nbetween built-in reservoir and the level control tank. The water level difference\
    \ was \nadjusted by the height adjuster which was controlled by the fuzzy controller\
    \ in PC. \nFuzzy controller had been widely applied as a powerful methodology\
    \ for complicated \nķ \nĹ \nĸ \nĺ \nĻ \nļ \n280 \nR. Ji, L. Qi, and Z. Huo \n\
    nonlinear delay systems which were difficult to set up accurate mathematic models.\
    \ \nThe control strategy in controller was selected as fuzzy control because soil\
    \ humidity \nwas large delay, great inertial, time-varying and non-linearity.\
    \ \nThe fuzzy controller was determined by the height of height adjuster based\
    \ on the \nsoil humidity error and its rate. The principle diagram of fuzzy control\
    \ in this system \nwas shown as in Fig.2. \n \nFig. 2. The principle diagram of\
    \ fuzzy controller \nE was the soil humidity error which was defined as desired\
    \ soil humidity minus actual \nsoil humidity. DE was the rate of soil humidity\
    \ error which was defined in equation (2). \nE ൌܪௗ െܪ௔                       \
    \              (1) \nDE ൌ\nு೏ିுೌ\nு೏                                         (2)\
    \ \nWhere ܪௗ was desired soil humidity, ܪ௔ was actual soil humidity. The best\
    \ range of \nsoil humidity in every crop growing stage was ascertained according\
    \ to the previously \nexperimental data. The medium value of the best range of\
    \ soil humidity was taken as \nthe desired soil humidity.  \nThe output of fuzzy\
    \ control system was ݄ which was used adjusting the water level \ndifference between\
    \ built-in reservoir and the level control tank and changing soil \nhumidity.\
    \  \nThe soil humidity was always lower than desired value. The range of E was\
    \ [-6%, \n0] and the range of DE [-1%, 0]. The input variables (E and DE) had\
    \ 4 fuzzy states \nwhich was {IL, IM, IS, IZ}. The output variable ݄ had 4 fuzzy\
    \ states which was \n{OL, OM, OS, OZ}. The ranges of input/output variables were\
    \ following: \nE ൌ ሼെ6, െ5, െ4, െ3, െ2, െ1,0ሽ \nDE ൌ ሼെ6, െ5, െ4, െ3, െ2, െ1,0ሽ\
    \ \n݄ ൌ ሼ0,1,2,3ሽ \nBecause the input variables of fuzzy controller (E and DE)\

    \ \nEvery fuzzy variable’s membership functions should be defined respectively.\
    \ There \nwere many kinds of membership functions to meet the requirement of various\
    \ \nvariables. The general rule to select membership function was following: the\
    \ higher \nsensitivity membership for little error and the fine stability membership\
    \ for larger \nerror. According to the changing regularity of soil humidity error\
    \ and the membership \nselection rule, the membership functions of variables (IL\
    \ and IM) were taken as \ntriangle function, the membership functions of variables\
    \ (IS and IZ) were taken as \nGaussian function and the membership functions of\

    \ \n \n \nATER is the main limiting factor of our life and any human activity.\
    \ In all our life activities \nincluding agriculture and industry, water has a\
    \ vital role in these previous sectors. This reflects the \nimportance of water\
    \ especially under many global challenges (mainly climate changes, global explosion\
    \ \nof population, soil degradation, desertification and hunger). The using of\
    \ water in irrigation is a very \ncommon practice in agriculture because no agriculture\
    \ without water. The management of irrigation water \nhas become one of the urgent\
    \ needs nowadays under the terrible progress of bioinformatic technology. \nThe\
    \ smart irrigation is considered one of the most common applications in smart\
    \ or precision agriculture. \nThe main components of smart irrigation system may\
    \ include soil, weather and plant sensors such as soil \nmoisture sensor controllers,\
    \ evapotranspiration controllers, and rain sensors. This work is an attempt to\
    \ \nanswer one question about smart irrigation whether it is an important strategy\
    \ to overcome the global \nwater crisis or not. This is also a call by Environment,\
    \ Biodiversity and Soil Security (EBSS) for \nreceiving articles on smart irrigation,\
    \ different applications of smart irrigation in smart agriculture, their \nchallenges,\
    \ their obstacles and the novel solutions in this concern. This topic has several\
    \ open questions \nneeds to be answered. The use of the Internet of Things is\
    \ one of the important solutions for smart \nmonitoring and control of the irrigation\
    \ process. \nKeywords: Smart farming, Precision agriculture, Soil moisture sensors,\
    \ Internet of things (IoT). \n \n1. Introduction \nThe global water crisis is\
    \ global problem facing \nseveral countries all over the world as a great \nchallenge\
    \ due to many global problems such as \nclimate changes, global warming and global\
    \ \npopulation’s growth (Salem et al. 2022). An increase \nin water shortage and\
    \ its stress facing several \ncountries worldwide is one of the main global \n\
    challenges confronting practical progress (Yuan and \nLo 2022). Water scarcity\
    \ is a big challenge and a \nW \nEnvironment, Biodiversity & Soil Security \n\

    \ \nmain limiting factor for several countries all over the \nworld, particularly\
    \ in arid and semi-arid regions \n(Tiyasha et al. 2021; Okasha et al. 2022). Using\
    \ the \nadvanced technology in agriculture is a crucial issue \nfor controlling\
    \ many agricultural practices and \nmaking the right decisions based on the continuous\
    \ \nmonitoring of fields using different sensors (Okasha \net al. 2021). Irrigation\
    \ practice is the largest \nconsumer of the available global water budget in \n\
    agriculture, which uses more than 75% of freshwater \nresources (Schulz et al.\
    \ 2020). Due to expected \nclimate changes and rapid population growth, it is\
    \ \nexpected that the increased demands for freshwater \nwill be getting worse\
    \ in the forthcoming decades \n(Okasha et al. 2021). \n \nIt is well known that\
    \ irrigation water management is \na crucial process that should be performed\
    \ to increase \nglobal food production depending on crop per drop \nstrategy (Ahmad\
    \ et al. 2022). Using the advanced \ntechnology and smart irrigation systems can\
    \ also \nincrease irrigation management. This technology \nmay include the automated\
    \ crop irrigation, which \nsupports the optimum supply of water amount \nwithout\
    \ referring to labor to control valves or to \nanalyze the plant growth status.\
    \ The developmental \nphases in Internet of Things (IoT) and Wireless \nSensor\
    \ Network (WSN) technologies and the recent \nadvances in sensors for the implementation\
    \ of \nirrigation systems for agriculture, have sped up the \nevolution of smart\
    \ irrigation systems (García et al. \n2020). Several wireless communication technologies\
    \ \nhave been used in agriculture sector, such as IoT, \nBluetooth, Wi-Fi, long-range\
    \ wide area network \n(LoRaWAN), mobile communication (e.g., 2G, 3G, \nand 4G),\
    \ and ZigBee (Kim et al. 2020). Under smart \ngreenhouse conditions, many sensors\
    \ could be used \nfor \ngreenhouse \nmonitoring \nsystems \nsuch \nas \nSupervisory\
    \ Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), \nand Programmable Logic Controller (PLC)\
    \ system \n(Karanisa et al. 2022).  \nTherefore, this is a call for submitting\
    \ articles by \nEBSS. This photographic call also is needed for the \napplications\
    \ related to smart agriculture and \nirrigation. The answer of the main question\
    \ in this \nwork is the smart irrigation the right strategy under \nthe global\
    \ water crisis? \n \n2. 2. What is the smart irrigation?  \n \nSmart irrigation\
    \ technology could be defined as a \nprecise in which data on both weather and\
    \ soil \nmoisture can be used to determine the irrigation need \nof certain cultivated\
    \ plants (Fig. 1 and Table 1). \nSustainable \nprecision \nirrigation \nis \n\
    a \ncrucial \nagricultural practice toward the attainment of food \nsecurity,\
    \ as well as achieving water-saving measures \nfor water scarcity as a result\
    \ of drought in many parts \nof the world (Abioye et al. 2022). Precision irrigation\
    \ \nscheduling is directed toward highly efficient water \nusing by each plant\
    \ with compensation water loss \nthrough \nerosion, \nevapotranspiration, \nor\
    \ \ndeep \npercolation, and preventing under- or over-irrigation \n(Devanand Kumar\
    \ et al. 2020; Gu et al. 2020). Many \nbenefits could be harvested from smart\
    \ irrigation or \nproper management are presented in Figs. (2 and 3). \nSmart\
    \ irrigation is an effective monitoring and \noptimal control of water can be\
    \ saved, as well as \nproviding a reduction in other indirect costs incurred \n\
    from energy use in the form of fossil fuel or \nelectricity \nfor \npumping, \n\
    for \noptimal \ncost-\neffectiveness (Abioye et al. 2022). Smart irrigation \n\
    can apply for optimum doses of pesticides and \nherbicides (Talaviya et al. 2020).\

    In recent years, the sensor cloud infrastructure dawns a huge advancement in many
    real time applications. The major drawback of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is
    its limited processing capability, bandwidth scarcity, insufficient memory, etc.
    In reality, the sensors (EEG, ECG, and so on) continuously sense the highly sensitive
    data, and send to the medical server leading to numerous challenges. The integration
    of cloud computing and WSNs with internet enables to cover and provide a service
    to the entire world, and also to overcome the deficiency of the WSNs. This chapter
    gives a prelude on the integration of cloud computing with WSNs and discusses
    the functional architectures, design issues, benefits and the applications of
    the sensor cloud infrastructure. In addition, we also developed a general architectural
    model for precision agriculture application and farmers awareness using sensor
    cloud. Access provided by University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Download chapter PDF
    12.1 Introduction to Wireless Sensor Networks The advent of Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSNs) brings a new paradigm to the real embedded system that consist of a large
    number low cost and low power sensors. The most important task of the sensor node
    in the remote area is to sense the events such as temperature, vibration, radiation,
    pressure, humidity, and so on. The WSNs have great significance in numerous real
    time applications like forest fire detection, earth observation, environmental
    monitoring, healthcare, wildlife animal tracking, landslide detection, industrial
    monitoring, water quality monitoring, precision agriculture, and so on. The main
    advantage of the sensor node is self configuration, i.e., the sensor nodes itself
    can connect with neighbor nodes and formulates the communication between them
    by using its sensing, computing, processing, and wireless communication capability.
    Thus, we can establish the network anywhere and anytime that is man accessible
    area like indoor application, health care, etc., and also in man unattended areas
    like hazardous environment, forest, and so on. In such places, we can deploy sensor
    node by using aircraft or a robot, and constructs the network. The replacement
    and recharging of the sensor battery is impossible, where the node is deployed
    in the hostile environment and also human monitoring system is highly dangerous
    [1, 2]. The sensor nodes collect the physical event from the targeted sensing
    area which in turn communicate to the sink by direct hop or multihop. In direct
    hop, the sensor nodes directly communicate with the Base Station (BS) that consume
    more power for transmitting the data, since the energy consumption of the sensor
    node is directly associated with the data packets size and the transmission distance,
    thereby lessening the network lifetime. In multihop mode, the sensor node utilizes
    the intermediate nodes to forward the data packets towards the sink. Thus, it
    conserves the significant amount of battery energy than direct hop. Due to the
    tiny nature of the sensor node, it many constraints including battery energy,
    communication, memory, and computational capability [3]. Among them, the battery
    energy is an important consideration of network design. There are several protocols
    evolved over the last decade, which aims at prolonging the lifespan and enhancing
    the energy efficiency of the WSNs. The data routing, channel assessment, and localization
    are crucial tasks in sensor network design which stipulate the efficacy of the
    WSNs protocols. There are several channel accessing techniques such as CSMA-CA,
    TDMA, CDMA, FDMA, SDMA, and so forth and various MAC protocols like BMAC, SMAC,
    UMAC, etc., try to avoid the contention in MAC level and improves the performance
    of the networks [4,5,6]. Currently, numerous routing protocols are presented that
    aim at enhancing energy efficiency of the network. According to the data flow
    structure, the routing protocols can be categorized into : (i) location based
    routing (ii) flat routing, and (iii) cluster based routing. The flat routing protocols
    like FLOODING, RUMOR ROUTING, GOSSIPS, etc., are discussed in [7,8,9], and these
    protocols consume more energy and produce the high control overhead. The well-known
    clustering protocols including Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH)
    [10], Mobility Based Clustering (MBC) [11], Hybrid Energy Efficient Distributed
    (HEED) [12], Velocity Energy efficient and Link aware Cluster Tree (VELCT) [13],
    etc., are introduced in order to improve the scalability and energy efficiency
    of the networks. In clustering, the sensing area is divided into number of clusters
    and each cluster is governed by a Cluster Head (CH). This CH is used to perform
    the co-ordination within the cluster including assigning a timeslot to the member
    nodes, collecting the data from its member, and transmitting the data packets
    to the destination. Besides these, the CH performs the data aggregation which
    eliminates the redundant packets and conserves the battery energy significantly.
    The location based routing protocols like Reliable and Energy Efficient Protocol
    (REEP) [14], Energy efficient Beaconless Geographic Routing (EBGR) [15], etc.,
    in which each sensor node forwards the data depending on the location itself and
    it is directed to the neighbors to reach the destination. This routing greatly
    reduces the control overhead and energy consumption. Pros: There is no fixed network
    infrastructure. The sensor node made the decision autonomously and establishes
    the communication. As a result, it is highly suitable for large scale networks,
    and also enhances the fault tolerance and scalability of the networks. Network
    establishment cost is low. Cons: Redundant sensing in the same place leads to
    overhead and reduces the network performance. Mobile sensor nodes often change
    their position that cause link failure and make unstable network topology. This
    will lead to lessen the packet delivery ratio, and increase the packet retransmission
    and overhead. The sensing event without location information is meaningless for
    such application like fire detection, radiation detection, animal tracking, etc.
    The existing mechanism uses a GPS to track the location of the sensor. However,
    the GPS equipped devices consume high power and reduce the network lifespan. Besides,
    deploying the GPS in indoor applications evinces the error location information.
    Achieving the time synchronization among the sensor nodes is very complex in distributed
    decision mechanism. It is highly vulnerable to security threats. The WSNs suffer
    from several attacks, including wormhole attack, sink hole attack, selective forwarding
    attack, Hello flood attack, Sybil attack, Byzantine attack, and a collision attack.
    Lacks central coordinating system causes high overhead. 12.2 Why Cloud Computing?
    In a traditional Wireless sensor network, the user wants to sense a event from
    the particular target area. They deploy the sensor node manually or spread to
    man unattended area by using aircraft or monitoring by using robot equipped with
    sensors. The WSNs applications are single user centric, i.e, the WSNs is developed
    and maintained by the single user for fetching the sensor data. The user is restricted
    to utilize their sensor information to single application and does not allow the
    accessing of the data to another party. The sensor networks put onto the cloud
    infrastructures, which transparently share the resource (sensor data) among the
    multiple users. It allows the user to utilize the same sensor resources to the
    multiple applications and lessens the redundant data in the sensing, thereby increasing
    data reusability and reduces the cost of WSNs. Cloud computing is an emerging
    paradigm that provides flexible, reliable and cost effective solution in many
    application services through internet. It also offers massive storage, computational
    resources in an on-demand manner (i.e., It aims at providing IT resources service
    in an on-demand manner, at any time, and at anywhere.). In addition to this, the
    cloud storage provides highly reliable and scalable data sharing. And also it
    can do the outsourcing of the sensor data to store and process, and it can meet
    out the computational demands of the consumer, by paying for the service according
    to the usage. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) [16] defined
    cloud computing as a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network
    access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources that can be rapidly
    provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.
    The essential characteristic of cloud computing are [16]: Automated elasticity:
    The cloud service provider continuously observes the client infrastructure and
    scales it automatically based on the users demand, i.e., ability to scale up and
    down computing capacity based on the demands. On-demand services: The user can
    directly request the service provider to access and manage their services through
    the web browser interface without any human interaction. Resource pooling: The
    computing resources are available to the users on the multi-tenant environment
    and virtual resources generated and deleted dynamically based on the demand of
    the consumer. Measured services: The monitoring servers in the Virtual Machine
    (VM) automatically monitor, control, and record the utilization of the cloud resources
    by the user, according to the meter capability. Wide range network access: The
    users can utilize the standard interface protocols for accessing the resources
    and services which are available over the internet. This will enhance the network
    accessibility between the cloud service provider and user devices like smart phone,
    tablet, laptop, and so on. 12.2.1 Service Model Table 12.1 shows the general service
    models and its applications. It is noted that SaaS is a software application.
    PaaS makes an execution runtimes without direct access to the Operating System
    (OS). IaaS is mainly for Virtual Machines, servers, storage systems, and other
    hardware/OS. 12.2.1.1 Software as a Service (SaaS) The cloud providers deliver
    the software or application product to the consumer over the World Wide Web (WWW),
    that are accessible by various client systems. The service provider is responsible
    for managing and controlling the computing infrastructure such as OS, storage,
    networks, server, etc. The service provider can upgrade the software or release
    the new features, in contrast to the customary software [16]. Table 12.1 Service
    model and its application Full size table Pros: the multiple users or consumers
    share the same cloud infrastructure. Cons: constrained in user specific-configuration.
    12.2.1.2 Platform as a Service (PaaS) The service supplier provides the users,
    the service stacks and computing platforms including development tool, programming
    language, libraries, services, Web 2.0 application run time, and middleware. Thus,
    the consumers easily attain the sensor cloud infrastructure and related application
    tools. The service providers control and manage the underlying network. Depending
    on the application, the user can manage the deployment model and settings of the
    configuration [16]. Pros: it allows the development of applications quickly and
    simply with reduced design complexity. Cons: high security risk due to the absence
    of control over the virtual machine and data processing. 12.2.1.3 Infrastructure
    as a Service (IaaS) IaaS typically delivers a virtualized platform infrastructure
    over the internet. In IaaS, the service provider aids the consumer in provisioning
    the network, data processing, server, processing, storage, application development,
    backups, location, and resource computing tools. Hence, the consumers design,
    build, deploy, and run the arbitrary application that is operated in a virtualized
    infrastructure. In addition to that the consumers have a complete control to the
    data processing and everything over their virtual machine and need not be responsible
    for controlling and managing the underlying cloud computing environment. But,
    the host firewall may have a limited control to choose the network components
    [16]. Pros: greatly manages the security risk. Cons: consumer has the full responsibility
    in all aspect of virtual machine management and backups. 12.2.2 Deployment Model
    Deployment model can be done in four ways: (i) private cloud, (ii) community cloud
    (iii) public cloud, and (iv) hybrid cloud. 12.2.2.1 Private Cloud This model is
    solely owned and governed by the individual organization or third party auditing
    or both. This model shares its resources internally to the multiple consumers
    [16]. Pros: It provides a high level of security. Service providers can easily
    customize the software and other resources. Cons: It has a limited storage, server,
    and services, owing to constrain in hardware and software of service providers.
    Examples: VMWare, vCloud Director, OpenStack. 12.2.2.2 Community Cloud This cloud
    is established by the group of organization and forms the community. It distributes
    the common interests such as mission, application, services, security policy,
    etc., within the specific community. This cloud may be owned and governed by the
    organization within the community, or third party auditing [16]. Pros: making
    a better utilization of the self organization advances from the autonomous computing.
    Cons: limited amount of data storage and bandwidth shared among the customers.
    Examples: Googles Gov Cloud. 12.2.2.3 Public Cloud The cloud resources are distributed
    to many customers for open use. The public pay the amount to the service provider,
    according to the usage of the services and cloud resources. This model is owned
    and governed by the organization (business, government, education, or some combinations)
    [16]. Pros: It is easy to deploy and run and can be made available to the customer
    through the internet, hence the IT resources and services immediately available
    to the users. It is a pay as you go model, hence, there is no need for long term
    commitment or agreement with the service provider. Cons: High security risk (data
    privacy, integrity), because the client has no control on data processing and
    infrastructure. The resource and application customization is very complex or
    not possible. Examples: Sun cloud, Amazon AppEngine, Microsoft Azure, Google AppEngine,
    IBMs Blue Cloud. 12.2.2.4 Hybrid Cloud Hybrid cloud combines two or more different
    clouds that stay in distinct entities with identical infrastructure and capability
    [16]. Pros: it provides strong advance in the overall organizational agility.
    Cons: it may affect the enterprises identity and organizations security. Examples:
    open source - Nebula cloud computing project. 12.3 Introduction to Sensor Cloud
    The integration of the sensor networks, cloud computing and internet provides
    the plenty of sensor instances, IT resources, services over the internet and also
    enable these resources whenever and wherever the user wants to access. According
    to MicroStrains [17], a sensor cloud is a unique sensor data storage, visualization
    and remote management platform that leverages powerful cloud computing technologies
    to provide excellent data scalability, rapid visualization, and user programmable
    analysis. 12.3.1 Benefits of the Sensor Cloud The benefits of the sensor cloud
    infrastructure are summarized using the research article [17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28].
    Data Management: Accessing and storing of the sensor data is efficiently handled
    in sensor cloud that overcomes the issue of data gathering from WSNs. IT infrastructure:
    Sensor cloud architecture allows the multiple users, who can access the same set
    of information for various applications, since it shares and allocates their resources
    to the users in on demand manner as per the request. Scalable resource utilization:
    Sensor cloud provides a scalable services i.e., rapidly scale up or scale down
    the consumption of resources as per the requirement of the applications. Thus,
    the sensor information can be utilized by multiple services and users without
    any intercession. Dynamic Provisioning of Services: Accessing and storing of the
    sensor information anywhere and any time, if it is linked to the internet, thus
    gives an enhanced flexibility and scalability. Quick Response Time: The sensor
    cloud immediately responds to the users, as it enables the users to search for
    the large number of sensor data stored in cloud infrastructure easily and also
    makes a decision very quickly on real time application by using effective computational
    methods. Unlimited storage space: Provisioning of the unlimited storage memory
    on rent basis to the users reduce the memory deficiency in WSNs. Runtime Resource
    management: Sensor cloud automatically gives an alternative in case of faulty
    resources over the run time. This feature further extends their fault tolerance
    capability. Collaboration: Sensor cloud is the collaboration of different Wireless
    sensor network providers, hence multiple application information shared from the
    various administrative domain which enhances the utilization of resources and
    energy efficiency. Location independent: The user can access and utilize the resource
    as well as do some task irrespective of being a particular location. Thus, it
    has a high flexibility and is well suited for high mobility. Rapid Elasticity:
    Cloud gives an elastic platform for gathering, processing, storing, and sharing
    of huge amount of the data from various application domains. Flexibility in resource
    utilization: It allows the user to effectively utilize the shared pool of cloud
    resource in an on-demand manner like processors, memory, services and so on.,
    thus reducing the constrains of the sensor networks. Real time support: The key
    feature of the sensor cloud is real time support that makes a real time decision
    in multiple users and various application situations. Virtualization: The Virtualized
    platform of sensor provides an effective sharing of real time information among
    the various users. It also enables dynamic resource management, which results
    in efficient utilization of cloud resource. Cost effectiveness and minimal maintenance
    requirement: This platform dynamically shared their resource including storage,
    services, operating system, real time sensor information, etc., to the multiple
    users. Thus, the service providing organization can extend their services to a
    large number of users with reasonable pricing and also lessen the maintenance
    cost. Network lifetime: The sensor cloud gives an optimal duty scheduling of the
    deployed sensor nodes. Owing to this, the sensor consumes a reduced battery power,
    which in turn extends the lifetime. Re-configurability: The sensor cloud affords
    multiple services to multiple users, thus it facilitates the users which can able
    to select to switch application, and reconfigure the sensors based on the requirement
    of their demand. 12.3.2 Applications of Sensor Cloud Smart city: The sensor cloud
    infrastructure plays a key role in developing a smart city. The various organizations
    have been concerned with different level of collaboration to provide a smart city
    services such as water monitoring, e-toll, car parking, video surveillance, smart
    transportation, street light monitoring, etc., [18]. Physical activity monitoring:
    This application platform is developed for monitoring the physical activity such
    as lying down, sitting, stand still, walking, running, jumping, etc., by using
    wearable sensors (accelerometer sensor), SPINE Android App, and cloud computing
    infrastructure. This can enable to monitor the aged people or patient fall detection,
    and also determine if a person gets up after falling down [19]. Fire emergency
    evacuation: The deployment of the WSNs in a large building is used to detect the
    occurrence of fire. The standard fire safety system consists of the smoke sensor,
    temperature sensor, fire alarm, and fire fighting equipment which is connected
    to the cloud infrastructure. This system gives the necessary information such
    as fire location, status of egress route, health information to the fire fighter.
    This can be used to evacuate the person from the building and also track the health
    of the fire fighter or person. Thus it enhances the fire fighter safety, and efficacy
    of the tracking [20]. Battlefield surveillance: The battlefield surveillance system
    is developed to monitor the enemys missiles, weapons and aircrafts, in which the
    Mobile WSNs, that links with cloud computing using wireless communication technology
    like Zigbee, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, 2G, 3G, 4G, and so forth. This Mobile WSN performs
    the parameter estimation for effectively pointing out the ememy targets [21].
    Epileptic seizure detection: An automatic epileptic seizure detection framework
    contains: (i) wearable EEG sensor placed on the different location of the brain.
    This is used to capture the electrical activity of the brain. (ii) the mobile
    with android app is used to send the gathered EEG signal to cloud infrastructure.
    The automated detection system in cloud finds any abnormality in the captured
    signal, immediately send the alert message to the user, and advised to take precautionary
    measures and defend itself [22, 23]. Precision agriculture: In irrigation management,
    the on field sensors such as moisture sensor, ambient temperature sensor, humidity
    sensor, and soil temperature sensor is deployed to monitor the crop field. The
    sensor owner provides this information to the cloud infrastructure on rental basis.
    The end user can access the irrigation management services and the meteorological
    weather report from the cloud by subscription. Thereby, the end user can monitor
    the crop field condition and manage the irrigation schedule. In addition, the
    UAV based crop disease monitoring information also shared in the cloud infrastructure
    which enhances the precision agriculture with low cost [24]. Smart transportation:
    The sensor cloud based transportation system provides a guideline to the drivers
    and publics by the way of GPS information, sharing the real time traffic and public
    transportation information. This information enables the drivers and publics to
    achieve an enhanced navigation such as to track status and current location of
    the vehicle, to avoid the collision, to provide the traffic free track to reach
    the destination and time of arrival, etc. The recent development of automated
    driving system (Dedicated short Range Communication) fully depends on the Wi-Fi,
    GPS, sensor networks, and cloud infrastructure which greatly enhance performance
    of the vehicular transportation [18]. Environmental monitoring: The environmental
    monitoring system uses different sensors such as sound, light, barometer, temperature,
    \(\text {CO}_{2}\), seismic, and so forth that provides a continuous monitoring
    of the causes of earthquake, tsunami, landslide, volcano explosion, etc. This
    information can be put onto the sensor cloud infrastructure and is used to predict
    before the occurrence of such a disaster and greatly saves the human being from
    the casualty and lives. Weather prediction: Weather forecasting station deploys
    the various types of sensor in order to collect the information such as relative
    humidity, barometric pressure, soil moisture, temperature, ambient light, wind
    speed and direction, solar radiation, etc., from a given location. Through the
    sensor cloud infrastructure, these sensor instances are concurrently used with
    other sensor instance, i.e., physical sensor data of the weather station are not
    only used to predict the weather changes, but also it is used by the farmers for
    scheduling the water irrigation. 12.3.3 General Architecture of Sensor Cloud The
    general architecture of the sensor cloud is shown in the following Fig. 12.1.
    12.3.3.1 Sensor Cloud Administrator or Service Provider Sensor cloud administrator
    or provider is responsible for preparing the resources of cloud computing services
    in order to develop a sensor cloud infrastructure. And also prepares the service
    catalog template that fulfills the requirement of the users. They also responsible
    for managing the IT resources, virtual sensor management, monitor, control, and
    settle the amount to the sensor owner, IT resource owner and billing and collecting
    the resource usage amount from the users [27, 28]. Fig. 12.1 General architecture
    of sensor cloud Full size image 12.3.3.2 Sensor Owner The sensor owner can freely
    register or unregister their Physical Sensor (PS) and its properties to the sensor
    cloud infrastructure. This can enable the sensor owner shares their type of sensor
    data and location to users. The sensor owner provides their sensor data to the
    service provider on rental basis. The sensor owner is only responsible for sensor
    network maintenance (sensor battery, hardware, purchase of sensor, etc.,) [29].
    12.3.3.3 End User The end user registers the sensor data for their services or
    applications through service catalog facility in the portal. The service provider
    prepares the new service template which meets the requirement of the users. Thus,
    the user can access and control the virtual sensor directly. The user paid the
    amount for the usage of the virtual sensor data. The sensor cloud providers stipulate
    their pricing of the services according the utilization of cloud storage (i.e.,
    amount of data stored, the amount of data in and out of the cloud storage, the
    number of http request used), Computational resources including virtual machine
    instance, CPU, RAM, I/O capacity and other IT resources [28, 29]. The followings
    are mostly used in pricing models [27]. On-demand - The service requester utilizes
    the sensor cloud services on the pay-as- you- go. The requester pays the amount
    based on the usage of the service instance. Prepaid - The service requester pays
    the fixed amount and reserves the services for a specific duration. Auctioned
    - The service provider allocates the computing capacity to the service requester
    by offering the prices at an action sale. The bid rate is regulated by supply
    and demand. This model offers a lower price than prepaid model. 12.3.4 Functional
    Architecture of Sensor Cloud As shown in Fig. 12.2, the each components of the
    functional block diagram of sensor cloud infrastructure are elaborately explained
    below. 12.3.4.1 Database and Repository The database storage contains the definition
    of the physical sensor, Virtual Sensor (VS), Virtual Sensor Group (VSG), and IT
    resources (Sensor Owner-ID, Location, Sensor-ID, type of the sensing data information
    like pressure, temperature, humidity, etc., VGS-ID, VS-ID, Virtual server-ID,
    User-ID, Resource server-ID, Virtual server-ID, host name, and specification,
    IP address). The repository storage contains the templates of the VS and the VSG.
    This template provides a library and its supporting file that defines the data
    mapping rules, as well as data source class name depending on the requirement
    of the user registration [29, 30]. 12.3.4.2 User Centric Layer The user centric
    layer is used to interconnect the users to the sensor cloud. The main components
    of the client centric layer are the user interface, session management, membership
    management, and user repository. The user interface allows user specify parameters
    including sensing event, area of interests, sensing duration, sensing duration,
    and so on. The session management is responsible for the creation, maintenance,
    and termination of the sessions between the user and middleware. The membership
    management gives a right to access the provisioned services only to the authorized
    user. The user repository has the detailed information of the users including
    the total duration of the service accessing, account ID and other details, payment
    history, billing information, data sent by WSNs, data usage, etc. [31]. Fig. 12.2
    Functional block diagram of sensor cloud Full size image 12.3.4.3 Sensor Centric
    Layer The sensor centric layer is responsible to act as an intermediate layer
    between the middleware layer and sensor layer. This layer enables the Sensor Networks
    (SN) to access the sensor cloud directly by using SN registration, SN maintenance
    and data component. The owner of the SN wants to provide their services (information)
    through sensor cloud, the owner need to register the details of their sensor networks.
    The sensor cloud verifies the registration information and makes the trust relationship
    with WSNs owner. Thus, it ensures the trust data communication between the SN
    owner and sensor cloud core. The SN maintenance layer ensures the quality services
    of the SN to the sensor cloud core. It provides an interoperability and coordination
    of the different sensor platforms. Also, it periodically checks their network
    performance and node activity, updates the current status of sensor nodes, and
    gives the time synchronization among the sensor nodes and networks. Thus, the
    sensor centric layer enhances reliable and trustful data communication between
    the WSNs and sensor cloud core. Since, it avoids the tampered and inaccurate sensor
    reading given to the cloud [31]. 12.3.4.4 Middleware Layer The middleware layer
    lies between the sensor centric and client centric layers, which is used to connect
    the client request with sensor data. It is a sensor cloud core which performs
    numerous functions including data flow management, configuration management, physical
    and virtual layer management, application performance management, provision management,
    resource management, life cycle management, and so on. 12.3.4.5 Workflow Management
    A work flow defines the sequence of steps to handle the various tasks, i.e., the
    task should be structured, executed, and tracked in a definite way. Hence, it
    reduces the run time, workload, delay, storage, etc. And also enhances the effective
    utilization of the resources [31]. 12.3.4.6 Data Analytics The cloud computing
    system uses a data mining process for analyzing the big data gathered from the
    physical sensor. This computing process is effectively done by using the mechanism
    such as computational intelligence, machine learning, statistical analysis, and
    database management. The data mining lets the anomaly detection, Association rule
    learning, correlation, clustering, classification, and Regression, which result
    in lessening the big data into the manageable data size, derive the data pattern.
    The key benefits of data analytics are speedy and better decision making in many
    real time application and cost reduction [32]. 12.3.4.7 Resource Management It
    provides the IT resource including networks, server, CPU, etc., and updates the
    definition of the VS and VSG service template in repository storage [33, 34].
    Fig. 12.3 Lifecycle management Full size image 12.3.4.8 Configuration Management
    The configuration management ensures the provision of flexibility, scalability,
    and other QoS of sensor cloud to the client. It lets the adding and removing of
    the client dynamically from the cloud services and also provides the flexible
    reconfiguration as the clients objectives change. It also affords the cloud services
    for scalable heterogeneous application and multi-tenants [35]. 12.3.4.9 Lifecycle
    Management The main duties of the lifecycle management and their work flow are
    demonstrated in Figs. 12.3 and 12.4. The service provider or cloud administrator
    prepares the service catalog that contains the current service specification including
    Operating System, available service application, sensor information details, hardware
    specification, network specification, location, and so on. This can let to create
    the service template and services instance, that meet the users requirement [30,
    36]. Fig. 12.4 The flow of lifecycle in sensor cloud Full size image The procedure
    for lifecycle flow is described below: (i) The end user enables the sensor cloud
    to log in to the portal on the web- browser. (ii) The end user selects the appropriate
    service template and IT resource from the catalog on the portal. The portal server
    directly displays these templates which are stored in the repository. (iii) Then,
    portal server sends the request to the provision server. (iv) After the registration
    of the user requirement, the provision sever reserve the IT resources, VS and
    VGS from the existing server or from the new virtual server by using a monitoring
    server. (v) The provision server collects the VS and VSG service template from
    the repository and generate the service instance. (vi) It also provisions the
    VSG on the chosen virtual server. (vii) Updates the new definition of the VSG.
    (viii) The service provider send the acknowledgement to the user for intimating
    the successful creation of services instance. (ix) Then, the user receives the
    sensor data from the VSG and also can control the VS and VSG directly. (x) The
    user unregisters from the services, once he completes. 12.3.4.10 Provision Management
    Provisional management is responsible for getting template of VS and VSG from
    the repository as the user request from the portal. This template is used to generate
    the VS (service instances) and its VSG and reserves the IT resources from the
    pool. The provision server updates the definition of the new VSG. This provisions
    the VSG in the virtual server. Once the service template is created successfully,
    then the service provider sends the acknowledgment to the user, then selecting
    the appropriate service instance to retrieve the data from the virtual sensor
    and control the VSG directly. And the user discharge from the services whenever
    useless. The monitoring server receives the information about the VS through an
    agent in the virtual server. The cloud administrator retrieves the monitoring
    information the web browser and can be used to inspect the performance of the
    server [29,30,31]. 12.3.4.11 Virtual Sensor Management A virtual sensor is an
    emulation of a physical sensor that gets its sensor data from the underlying physical
    sensors. The VS gives a customized view to the end users using distribution and
    location transparency. The VS encompasses a meta-data about the physical sensors
    and the end user. The virtual server creates the service instance, once it receives
    the request of the service instance from the provision server. After creating
    the instance, it groups the virtual sensor which is related to the concerned request
    of the service instance and updates the definition of the newly generated service
    instance [30, 31]. 12.3.4.12 Communication Layer The short range wireless technology
    is used to connect the sensor nodes to the BS. And also its specifications are
    summarized in Table 12.2. The recent advancement in the cellular network is 3G,
    4G, LTE, 5G, etc. which is relatively low cost and straightforward method to develop
    a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) based Sensor cloud applications. Nowadays,
    these wireless cellular networks offer a wide range service with high speed. These
    carrier networks provide the sensor information and cloud services to the world
    wide. Table 12.2 Comparison of short range communication in WSNs Full size table
    12.3.5 Design Issues and Challenges The design issues and research challenges
    of the sensor cloud infrastructure are summarized from the research articles [17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37].
    Issue in shared technology: The sensor cloud infrastructure uses a virtualization
    mechanism that shares the same cloud resources among the multiple users. This
    data sharing mechanism enables the malicious user to access the information about
    the other users. Thus, it affects the reliability, and trustfulness of the network
    and overall performance of the cloud infrastructure. Hence, a rigid authentication
    mechanism and suitable firewall is required to solve this issue. Data analytic
    issue: The biggest issue of the cloud computing is data analytic and become more
    critical when handling the multimedia data, and sensor events from the various
    sensor networks. It is very complex for tracking data pattern from the big data.
    To overcome this issue, it needs sound methodology for analysis the big data and
    convert into manageable data. It can also allow the user and service providers
    to use the IT resources effectively. Cloud security issue: The features of cloud
    include the shared resource pool, multi tenancy, and virtualization that allow
    the user can access the same sensor instance from the different places. But, lacking
    of isolation between the virtual machines emerge the security issue in cloud.
    There are possible security attacks on the cloud such as Denial of Service DoS,
    data deletion attack, replay attack, pollution attack, Tag forgery attack, replace
    attack, data leakage attack. This will lead to the degradation of the network
    performance. By using well data backups, cryptography, and user authentication
    mechanism avoid the theft or loss of data, technical loss of control, and continuously
    provides their services effectively. Heterogeneity issues: The cloud infrastructures
    have different types of IT resources and sensor instance with different hardware
    and software capabilities (storage, processing, computation, OS, application).
    Thus, the designed cloud infrastructure will effectively tackle the heterogeneity
    issues and provide the scalable and flexible services to the users. The community
    cloud effectively handles the hardware and software compatibility issues related
    with multiple organizations that share their resources including security, compliance,
    OS, hardware, and so forth. Energy efficiency issues: The energy management is
    a very big challenge in cloud based data center. The monitoring metadata is used
    to predict the demand of the user, allocating resources and scheduling the active
    time of the server depends on the predicted demand level. Thus, it lessened the
    active server, which leads to minimize overall energy consumption. To enhance
    the power management of cloud server by using metadata remains an attractive ongoing
    research area. Service Level Agreement: The agreement between the communication
    parties (service providers or service provider and users) regarding the information
    of all the services, minimum service capabilities such as bandwidth, CPU, RAM,
    etc., and also the terms and conditions. Perhaps the service provider doesnt meet
    the requirement of users demand as per the agreement, which result in violation
    of the agreement and pay the penalty to the other parties. This issue still remains
    a great challenge in the cloud computing researchers to provide the satisfactory
    services to the end user. Scalability issue: The important task of the cloud computing
    is a collection of the several monitoring metrics of each virtual machine. Allocating
    the high resources and extending the size of the cloud depend on the number of
    users and their demands. The collection of monitoring metric from the virtual
    server is very crucial when the number of the cloud users increases and also depends
    on the size of the monitoring metrics and sampling frequency (bandwidth) of the
    VM. The researcher tries to develop the agent less monitoring system of VM, thereby
    reducing the overhead and bandwidth limitation. Interoperability issue: It is
    an important issue when the cloud users access the sensor cloud services through
    web interface. The web interface is not compatible with smart phone OS and application.
    But, most of the sensor cloud users access the cloud by using mobile devices or
    phone. Thus, it needs standard protocol for interfacing and provides a seamless
    service between the users and service providers. Data portability and integrity
    issue: In hybrid cloud, the service provider finds difficulty in integrating the
    data of the public off premises cloud that is stored in the internal server. Since
    the data may distribute over the private and public clouds that may cause the
    integration problem including: Security related issues. Failure to maintain transaction
    across the network. Trouble in managing of huge volume of data. Data quality control
    issues. Issues determining the origins of data. Absence of mechanism to identify
    changes in data. Pricing issues: There is no standard model for fixing the cost
    of cloud services and varies from one service provider to another. The service
    provider set the pricing based on the usage of the resources such as storage,
    CPU, OS, domain name, IP address, load balancing and so forth. The monitoring
    agent in the VM updates the data utilized by the users that also gives charging
    of resource utilization for cloud service providers. 12.4 An Example Architectural
    Model for Precision Agriculture Precision farming is defined as information and
    technology based farm management technique targets at inferring more precise decision
    in detecting crop condition automatically. It uses a remote sensing and satellite
    technology to monitor the variability of environmental, soil, and crop condition.
    In this model, the various service providers including private or government organization
    collaboratively share their resources such as weather condition, satellite information,
    Unmanned Ariel Vehicle (UAV) monitoring information, various WSNs information
    to the sensor cloud freely or rental basis through the internet, as shown in Fig.
    12.5. This information is available anytime in the cloud storage. This can enable
    the user accessing the IT resources and sensor depends on the demands of the users
    application and paying charge to service provider as per the usage resources.
    Some private sector or government sector uses this resources and analysis, consolidate
    the requirement of the farmers including water irrigation scheduling, warning
    message of crop diseases and pesticide recommendation, soil fertility level and
    fertilizer recommendation for the usage and level, giving a flood, cyclone, landslide,
    tsunami, and rainfall alert to the farmer by sending the SMS or through the smart
    phone App. The farmer get this service on rental basis of freely by registering
    and giving the necessary information about crop land location, type of the crop
    planted, total crop field, farmers name, phone number, address, email-id and so
    on to the concerned service provider. According the farmers registration, the
    service provider gives appropriate suggestions and solution to the farmers. In
    addition to that, the service providers allow the user updating their registration
    and service requirement at any time and anywhere through internet. As a result,
    the farmer improves their crop productivity and efficiently manages the water
    scarcity at low cost. Fig. 12.5 General architecture of sensor cloud for precision
    agriculture Full size image Calibration: It is sustained using predicted and measured
    values of remote sensing and satellite image information. Soil moisture prediction:
    At regular intervals, the determination of water contained in the crop field is
    performed using automated learning system over the measured and predicted value.
    Soil nutrients prediction: Real time measurement of nutrients in the soil is achieved
    using automated learning over the measured and predicted data. Crop disease prediction:
    The UAV image is used to identify the crop diseases. It can be used to classify
    the type of disease that infects the crop. Measurement: The sensor nodes are programmed
    to provide a current crop field data at regular interval to zone management office.
    The sensed data, satellite image data, and meteorological weather report data
    are collectively used for predicting the current need of the crop field. Estimation
    of water requirements: The automated system determines the amount of water to
    be supplied to the farmland or crop. Assessment of Fertilizer: The automated system
    is used to find the amount of fertilizer that is required to resolve the deficiency
    in soil fertility. Pesticide assessment: The automated system generates the recommendation
    for pesticide needs and disease specific pesticide based on the UAV image information.
    Update to the farmer: The zonal management controller is programmed to send Short
    Message Service (SMS) automatically to the farmers with current status of registered
    crop field. The recent advancement in satellite technology is very handy in agriculture.
    The satellite images provide necessary information about monsoon changes, weather
    or climate changes, cyclone, storm formation, finding a ground water level, etc.
    12.4.1 Nutrition Level Identification In recent years, the researchers in precision
    forming are looking to optimize the crop yield while reducing the fertilizer consumption.
    The soil sensor can be used to monitor the soil data continuously such as soil
    PH, humidity, salinity, electrical activity, etc., This real time soil data can
    lead to design an automation system in the agricultural field to improve the crop
    quality and productivity. The determination of NPK (i.e.,nitrogen, phosphorus,
    and potassium) in the soil is very essential for detecting the amount of soil
    nutrients. This can be used for giving a recommendation to the farmers about the
    needs of nutrients and site specific fertilization. The automated system has the
    advantage of eliminating the unwanted utilization of fertilizer. Thus, it can
    reduce the deterioration of soil and yield good quality crop foods. 12.4.2 Threatening
    Disease Identification (UAV) The UAV based early detection of diseases in crop
    play a vital role in the agricultural field to avoid the qualitative and quantitative
    losses faced by the farmers. The recent automatic technique is used to detect
    the crop diseases at earliest which are beneficial as it aware the farmers to
    take a precautionary measure to restrict the spreading of crop diseases, reduces
    the large work of monitoring in large farms. 12.4.3 Other Applications The recent
    developments in wireless communication such as low power VLSI and embedded design
    are incorporated with Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) technology for designing
    a low power, low cost, tiny smart sensor. The smart sensor node consists of four
    basic components include sensing unit for sensing the data from the target area,
    a processing and storage unit for managing the local data and storage, power supply
    unit for giving a power to the sensor, and a radio communication unit for data
    transmission. The WSNs are usually comprised of numerous low power tiny sensor
    nodes that work together to carry out the sensing and monitoring the events from
    the chosen inaccessible area and forward the sensed data to sink through wireless
    media. In recent decades, the WSNs play a major role in providing most promising
    solution in many challenging real time applications such as atomic radiation level
    monitoring and Geiger count detection in nuclear plant, battlefield surveillance
    monitoring, target tracking, patient health monitoring, tsunami detection, disaster
    surveillance and crisis management, detect the risk of frost in agriculture, hazardous
    chemical factory venues, wildlife animal tracking and monitoring etc., [1, 2].
    Node attributes: ID: uniquely identifier Type: hardware type (sensor or gateway
    or base station) Address: Network address Physical location: geo-location Region:
    Logical location such as survey number of land position Attached sensor: List
    of attached sensor. 12.5 Related Work Many researchers have developed models based
    on sensor network for agricultural applications. Some of them are detailed here.
    The software and hardware requirements for different agricultural applications
    are found out from the related works and are given in the following Table 12.3.
    Touati et al. [38] proposed a fuzzy logic based water irrigation system which
    incorporates with wireless data logging. This model contains a feedback fuzzy
    logic controller, Zigbee, GPRS, Database platform, and specific soil sensor. The
    fuzzy logic controller infers time and duration of water irrigation depending
    on the field parameters like solar radiation, water contained in the soil, ambient
    temperature. The local station collects the sensed data and then sends these data
    to the remote station by using the GPRS link. Xiao et al. [39] designed a Wireless
    integrated Frequency Domain Soil Sensor (WFDSS) application for paddy field. The
    FDSS can be used to monitor the soil moisture of the paddy field and to transmit
    the collected events to the sink with the help of Zigbee technology. Goumopoulos
    et al. [40] proposed a precision irrigation using an autonomous WSAN based system,
    which consists of soil specific sensors that can be used to gather a soil and
    environment information. These collected data send to the base station by using
    IEEE 802.15 and IEEE 802.11 coexistence. This model also utilizes the volatile
    sensor array to find the amount of fertilizer and pesticide is to be needed, which
    can be identified through detection of plant emitted volatile organic compounds.
    In addition, they calculate the specific threshold value of plant based parameter
    from logged datasets by analyzing and applying new rules in machine learning algorithms.
    Table 12.3 Application specific software and hardware requirements Full size table
    Kim et al. [41] developed a wireless lysimeter enabled with web linked wireless
    sensor networks afford real time online monitoring the drainage water flux and
    field condition. The sensor node transmits the sensed data to base station which
    in turn connect to the web server through internet. Park et al. [42] proposed
    a green house management system with wireless sensor networks which aim at collecting
    environmental parameters like humidity, \(\text {CO}_{2}\), CO, temperature, and
    so on. It also monitors the crop diseases and crop productivity by measuring the
    leaf electrical conductivity, and humidity. This proposed system deliberately
    evinces the environmental impact on the crop growth and farmer productivity. Lloret
    et al. [43] deployed the sensor nodes that can be used to capture the images from
    the crop field. This is done using image processing technique and neural network
    in order to identify any scarce status (symptoms) in the leaves. In this way,
    the deficiency of water, nutrients, pest, disease, etc., are found. If any symptoms
    on the leaves are detected, the sensor node immediately transmits the data packets
    to the sink by using IEEE 802.11g and gives an awareness to the farmer to act
    accordingly. Srbinovska et al. [44] presented WSNs, where sensor node sends the
    sensory environmental information like temperature, humidity, and illumination
    to the base station through the Zigbee communication module. This information
    can be used to continuously monitor and control the crop field environment, thereby
    reducing crop diseases and enhancing the quality of crop productivity. Garcia-Sanchez
    et al. [45] integrated the WSNs, 802.15.4 and internet in order to identify the
    status of the crop using video surveillance. This system measures the soil salinity,
    PH, temperature, and moisture. Lopez Riquelme et al. [46] utilized the four types
    of sensor motes including soil moisture, environmental, water level, and gateway
    motes, where each sensor node is interconnected through the Zigbee module. The
    soil moisture sensor provides information of soil temperature, salinity and moisture
    content. The environmental sensor is used for collecting a relative humidity and
    temperature of the environment, the water level motes measure the electrical conductivity
    and water temperature. The sensor node periodically sends the sensed data to the
    base station by using gateway motes. The Graphical User Interface (GUI) enables
    the user to read the data which visualize them graphically and also evinces the
    nodes location with the help of Google map. Gutierrez et al. [47] proposed a web
    application based automated water irrigation system to remotely monitor the soil
    temperature and moisture. The WIU transmits the time and date to WSU, once it
    is powered through Xbee. Then, WSU sends the moisture content, and soil temperature
    to the WIU. The WIU transmits the collected data to web server through GPRS. It
    permits the end user to visualize the data graphically by using graphical user
    interface and also turns on the irrigation pumps for a preferred duration. Ramane
    et al. [48] proposed a fiber optic sensor based soil nutrients detector which
    is to measure the amount of NPK nutrients in the soil. Fiber optic sensor works
    on the principle of calorimetric, i.e., absorption of color by the solution. It
    will also provide the awareness and recommendation to farmers about nutrient needs
    with site specific fertilization. The main drawback is to carry out the farmland
    soil manually to a laboratory for soil pretreatment and chemical analysis. Carvajal-Arango
    et al. [49] proposed a virtual prototype automated system for water irrigation.
    It uses sensory information such as relative humidity, temperature, moisture,
    and light intensity as the input parameters of the fuzzy logic model for deriving
    the water irrigation schedule. The performance of the virtual prototype model
    is analyzed and compared with real time implementation that show a 0.128 percentage
    of error between the model responses. Katyara et al. [50] deploys the TDR-3A sensor
    to the different location in the targeted sensing area in order to sense the soil
    temperature and humidity. The remote terminal unit gathers the sensed data from
    TDR-3A and transmits to the SCADA server through the gateway. The SCADA server
    analyzes these soil moisture data with reference value and make the decision to
    control the relay of solenoid valve, i.e., ON and OFF. Santos et al. [51] introduced
    a pesticide drift controlling by using WSNs in order to lessen the environmental
    contamination. The sensor networks provide essential information (humidity, temperature,
    and wind speed) to the crop spraying support and control system for measuring
    the environmental condition. It can be used to find the moving path of the spraying
    vehicle, to analyze the crop spraying quality by quantifying the deposition of
    pesticide over the crop leaf and also monitor the environment after and before
    the spraying. 12.6 Conclusion The chapter presented here detailed the research
    carried out on the sensor cloud infrastructures. Also, we explored the various
    research issues and design challenges of the sensor cloud architectures. A detailed
    information of layered architecture and functions of the sensor cloud is given
    and also its benefits and the real time applications are analyzed. A sensor cloud
    architectural model for the precision agriculture is proposed and it is detailed
    in this chapter. We are sure that this awareness model using sensor cloud will
    definitely help the farmers in bringing up their yield and also makes the field
    maintenance easy. The sensor based analysis related with agricultural applications
    are done and the application specific software and hardware requirements are found

    \ exist and they all possess various degrees of benefits in \nenhancing food sufficiency.\
    \ In this study however, the enhancement of capillary irrigation \nsystem through\
    \ an integrated fuzzy logic controller with Decision Support System (DSS) to \n\
    ensure improvement in water saving for irrigation thereby improving crop yield\
    \ towards food \nsecurity was examined and achieved.  \nMethodology: An integrated\
    \ fuzzy logic controller with Decision Support System (DSS) for \ncapillary irrigation\
    \ system was adopted for the enhancement of water saving for irrigation. By \n\
    using this method, the challenges of irrigation management which is prevalent\
    \ with capillary \nirrigation system is minimised using the fuzzy logic controller.\
    \ An Internet of things (IoT) \nbased weather station for computation of potential\
    \ evapotranspiration (PET), for measuring \nrainfall and a VH400 moisture content\
    \ sensor for monitoring the volumetric water content of \nsoil, were some facilities\
    \ used to control the water level depth (WLD) autonomously through \na fuzzy controller\
    \ simulated in MATLAB and implemented on Arduino Mega. \nFindings: The soil moisture\
    \ content (SMC) depicts that fuzzy controlled water level depth \n(WLD) is able\
    \ to compensate reduction of water in crop medium that took place due to plant\
    \ \nwater uptake which changes daily. The result proves that dynamics of water\
    \ supply depth has \nsubstantial effects on the water absorption flow rate, wetting\
    \ pattern, soil water content and \ncumulative infiltration which are proportional\
    \ to the water supply depth decrement. \n \nUnique Contribution to Practice: An\
    \ integrated fuzzy logic controller with Decision \nSupport System (DSS) is a\
    \ new technique proposed for managing capillary irrigation system \nas it offers\
    \ enhanced water saving capacity (irrigation volume) based on crop demand. \n\

    \ \n \n15 \n1.0  \nINTRODUCTION \nIt is imperative to note that the demand for\
    \ freshwater is on the increase due to rapid growth \nin global population but\
    \ the effect of global warming and climate change poses devastating \nthreat on\
    \ water saving and food security (Action Aid, 2019). Consequently, various irrigation\
    \ \nsystems have been utilised by different kinds of farmers all over the world\
    \ with consequential \nchallenges of associated high amount of water consumption\
    \ from different sources, hence, the \nneed for increased focus on improvement\
    \ in the efficiency of water saving and plant yielding \nthrough proper integration\
    \ system using internet of things (IoT) and advance control theory \nconcept in\
    \ irrigation management. \nFurthermore, for plant growth and development, appropriate\
    \ water supply is essential towards \nensuring precision irrigation. However,\
    \ when rainfall is inadequate, extra water for irrigation \nmust be given to crops\
    \ (Brouwer, 1990). The quantity of water needed for irrigation on plants \ndepend\
    \ on the method of irrigation, water requirement of the plant to be cultivated\
    \ and soil \ntype. Different irrigation methods have effects on the nutrients\
    \ of the soil, infiltration rate of \nthe soil, evaporation, water absorption\
    \ pattern of the plant and deep percolation.  \nSurface irrigation which distributes\
    \ water to the surface of the soil using gravity allows the \nunrestricted flow\
    \ of water without any form of sensing and control action; however, the water\
    \ \nsaving capacity of surface irrigation is low due to massive evaporation and\
    \ the corresponding \nuncontrolled excess irrigation volume and huge labour cost\
    \ are some limitations that have \nmade surface irrigation unsuitable as precision\
    \ irrigation system (Ghodake and Mulani, 2016; \nYonts, 1994; Xiaoping et al.,\
    \ 2004; Gillies et al., 2017).  \nSub-surface irrigation (classified as capillary\
    \ and drip) and sprinkler irrigation are considered \nmodern irrigation system\
    \ because they can be precisely monitored, scheduled and controlled, \nand they\
    \ also offer higher water saving and yielding output (Nalliah and Sri Ranjan,\
    \ 2010; \nZainal et al., 2014; Li et al., 2018). Capillary irrigation as a sub-surface\
    \ irrigation works \nbased on the soil capillary action to gradually supply water\
    \ from the water source directly to \nthe root zone (Wesonga et al., 2014; Cai\
    \ et al., 2017; Semananda et al., 2018). In a recent \nstudy, horizontal and vertical\
    \ fibrous capillary interface for transfer of water from bottom of \nsupply tank\
    \ to the root zone of the plant was proposed (Rahman et al., 2019). It was further\
    \ \nreported that horizontal fibrous capillary offers high water saving potential\
    \ and better yield \non their test crop when compared to the vertical fibrous\
    \ capillary.  \nSimilar researches on capillary irrigation showing enhanced water\
    \ efficiency has also been \nreported (Masuda, 2008; Kinoshita et al., 2010; Ferrarezi\
    \ and Testezlaf, 2016; Kamal et al., \n2019). However, it has been observed that\
    \ the upward movement of water via capillary action \nirreversibly accumulates\
    \ salts in the soil media, and the salinity of water in the soil is not \nnegligible\
    \ unless water leaching occurs, hence proper monitoring and control of water supply\
    \ \nto the capillary interface is achieved (Fujimaki et al., 2018). Drip irrigation\
    \ is a highly \neconomical watering method for plants otherwise known as trickle.\
    \ It supplies water slowly \nthrough narrow tubes to provide dripping of water\
    \ to the soil near the root of plants through \nthe emitter (Brouwer, C., 1990).\
    \ This method of irrigation reduces water loss due to \nevaporation, which is\
    \ often caused by the effect of wind and surface runoff (Bhalage et al., \n2015;\
    \ Rekha et al., 2015; Pramanik et al., 2016).  \nAlso, research has shown efficient\
    \ fertigation, enabling precise supply of nutrient to the plant \nand thus reducing\
    \ nutrient leaching (Elasbah et al., 2019). The cost of accessories such as \n\
    piping, head trickle, emitters is high especially for large area of farm land\
    \ implementation \n(Bralts & Edwards, 1987). However, the persistent supply of\
    \ water at the soil surface \nAmerican Journal of Computing and Engineering  \n\

    \                                                 www.ajpojournals.org \n \n \n\
    16 \ncontributes towards water loss due to the evaporation process if not properly\
    \ controlled, \nhence a good knowledge of the distribution patterns of water in\
    \ the plant root zone is \nnecessary for proper installation of the drip system\
    \ of irrigation. Also, there is need for \nregular maintenance of the emitters\
    \ to avoid any blockage that might affect the water supply \nto the plant (Ravina\
    \ et al., 1992).  \nFurthermore, Sprinkler irrigation as a type of surface irrigation\
    \ is similar to the pattern of \nprecipitation on plant. The water sprinkling\
    \ is done using the spray head and long piping \nsystem so as to ensure large\
    \ coverage area for the sprinkled water. The advantage of their \nusage is that\
    \ they have the tendency to irrigate large area of land due to its large coverage.\
    \ \nHowever, these types of irrigation method require a high operating expense\
    \ due to the high \nequipment costs of sprinkler head and pipes during installation\
    \ as well as the energy needed \nfor pumping water such as engine oil and electricity.\
    \ In a windy environment, sprinkler \nirrigation is susceptible to high water\
    \ losses due to evaporation and wind drift (Zhu et al., \n2018; Zhao et al., 2009).\
    \ Moreso, regular maintenance is crucial for effective irrigation using \nsprinkler\
    \ because worn nozzles and leaking pipe connections decrease uniform water saving.\
    \ \nThis paper therefore focuses on the enhancement of capillary irrigation through\
    \ integration of \ndecision support system and fuzzy logic controller to ensure\
    \ improvement in water saving for \nirrigation thereby improving yield for enhanced\
    \ food security. \n2.0  \nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE  \nA weather station enabled\
    \ with internet and data logger was located within Fluid Mechanics \nlaboratory\
    \ in the Department of Mechanical Engineering Technology, Kogi State Polytechnic\
    \ \nLokoja, Nigeria. The weather station was used to collect all the weather variables\
    \ such as \nrainfall, air temperature and humidity, solar radiation, wind direction\
    \ and speed, and potential \nevapotranspiration. In application, potential evapotranspiration\
    \ (PET) measures loss of water \nfrom plant as well as soil surface into the environment\
    \ (Adnan et al., 2017). The computation \nof potential evapotranspiration (ETO)\
    \ was achieved through the FAO-56 Modified Penman-\nMontieth equation based on\
    \ weather data measured using the Davis vantage Pro 2 weather \nstation as present\
    \ in Eq. 1. \n \nwhere  \nPET = Potential evapotranspiration (mm/h)  \nΔ = Slope\

    \ the transportation of water using negative pressure from \nbottom to top of\

    The SMC is the amount of water that is stored in the soil and the availability\

    \ a capacitance type soil moisture \nsensor (VH400). The possible range of the\

    \ logic controlled capillary irrigation system \nIn this study, the IoT Decision\
    \ Support System (DSS) which denotes an application layer is \ncomprised of developed\
    \ user platform for data visualisation, analytics and remote control of \nembedded\
    \ controller. The design and development of an android mobile app and interactive\
    \ \nwebpage for data visualisation and analytics was achieved using android studio,\
    \ php scripting \nwith CSS scripting, respectively. PhpMyAdmin tool of MySQL was\
    \ deployed to develop the \ndatabase for data storage. The web IoT framework that\
    \ was developed contains php scripts \nthat enables the deployed fuzzy logic controller\
    \ on Arduino Mega board to send, store and \nretrieve data from the MySQL database\

    \ \nThe DSS is based on an application of IoT used in connecting devices, collecting\
    \ data and for \nremote monitoring and control over a long distance. In this study,\
    \ the IoT applications were \ndeployed for monitoring and collection of data.\
    \ The irrigation system controller has installed \nWi-Fi shield which transferred\
    \ data from the activity site into a server. Therefore, data from \nthe weather\
    \ station, soil moisture content, water level of the water supply tank (depth)\
    \ and \nwater resource tank were transferred at an interval of 10 minutes into\

    \ Logic Controller Design \nFuzzy control of the water supply depth management\
    \ was developed by using a fuzzy expert \nsystem shown in Fig. 2, and this was\
    \ further implemented on Arduino Mega Microcontroller. \nThe reference of evapotranspiration\
    \ (ETO) was calculated on an hourly basis for the weather \nstation and the crop\
    \ coefficient (Kc) measurement was based on water balance. The potential \nevapotranspiration\
    \ value was estimated using the measured weather variables while the soil \nmoisture\
    \ content was measured using VH400 soil moisture sensor. Three fuzzy input systems\
    \ \nwere used as the adaptive engine, and they include the soil moisture content\
    \ (SMC), potential \nevapotranspiration (PET) and rainfall (RAIN). In practice,\
    \ a fuzzy system was designed on \nthe basis of experience shared by farmers for\
    \ optimal irrigation management. \nFigure 2: Fuzzy irrigation system model \n\

    \ Fig. 6 shows \nthe membership function of outputs of the Water Level Depth (WLD)\
    \ while the fuzzy rules \nwere provided by human expert. The algorithm chosen\
    \ in this study is based on Mamdani \nsystem in which the membership function\
    \ has a triangular and trapezoidal shape. The \nmembership function values define\
    \ rules from the MATLAB simulation, and was applied for \nArduino fuzzy logic\

    \ water demand. The first \noperation controller obtained the data from the weather\
    \ station and soil water content; the \ndata obtained was analysed to show the\
    \ crop water uptake. The controller sampling time was \nset at every 2 hours to\
    \ store data at the cloud server and for visualisation on the DSS. After \nthe\
    \ two hour operation, the data sampling consisting of six data was used to calculate\
    \ the \naverage feed at the input fuzzy expert system. The actual evapotranspiration\
    \ and available \nwater content to process fuzzy expert system were used to estimate\
    \ WLD. Once the controller \nhad determined the WLD, the process of checking WLD\
    \ depth at the tank began. If the WLD \nrequirements were more than the current\
    \ water supply depth at the tank, the water pump will \nbe switched on until the\
    \ water level at WLD tank achieves the required level. The water level \nis always\
    \ maintained at a required level until a new level is required. If the WLD level\
    \ \nrequirements are less than the current WLD, the water level will be left without\
    \ taking any \naction to allow the level decrease naturally by plant water uptake.\
    \ All the data will be stored \nin the cloud server every 2 hours for evaluation\
    \ by the monitoring system and for measuring \nwater consumption. \n \nAmerican\

    \ 2022; Accepted: 02 March 2022\nAbstract: Smart irrigation system, also referred\
    \ as precision irrigation system,\nis an attractive solution to save the limited\
    \ water resources as well as to\nimprove crop productivity and quality. In this\
    \ work, by using Internet of\nthings (IoT), we aim to design a smart irrigation\
    \ system for olive groves. In\nsuch IoT system, a huge number of low-power and\
    \ low-complexity devices\n(sensors, actuators) are interconnected. Thus, a great\
    \ challenge is to satisfy the\nincreasing demands in terms of spectral efficiency.\
    \ Moreover, securing the IoT\nsystem is also a critical challenge, since several\
    \ types of cybersecurity threats\nmay pose. In this paper, we address these issues\
    \ through the application of\nthe massive multiple-input multiple-output (M-MIMO)\
    \ technology. Indeed,\nM-MIMO is a key technology of the fifth generation (5G)\
    \ networks and\nhas the potential to improve spectral efficiency as well as the\
    \ physical layer\nsecurity. Specifically, by exploiting the available M-MIMO channel\
    \ degrees\nof freedom, we propose a physical layer security scheme based on artificial\n\
    noise (AN) to prevent eavesdropping. Numerical results demonstrate that our\n\
    proposed scheme outperforms traditional ones in terms of spectral efficiency\n\
    and secrecy rate.\nKeywords: Smart farming; olive; IoT; massive MIMO; spectral\
    \ efficiency;\nsecurity\n1 Introduction\nAccording to the Guinness Book of Records,\
    \ the Jouf region, in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA),\nis the largest olive farm\
    \ in the world. Specifically, there are nearly 52,000 acres of olive groves and\n\
    more than 5 million olive trees in Jouf region. This large quantity of olive trees\
    \ requires the provision\nof a significant amount of water in order to obtain\
    \ the maximum productivity and better quality.\nHowever, most of the KSA regions\
    \ suffer from a desert climate, with very low precipitation and severe\ntemperature\
    \ fluctuations between day and night. Moreover, the use of traditional irrigation\
    \ systems\nnot only consumes a lot of farmers time and effort (farmers must remain\
    \ present during the irrigation\nprocess), but also can leads to over or under\
    \ irrigation problem. Consequently, it is necessary to design\na new irrigation\
    \ system for olive trees based on modern technology in order to improve the productivity\n\
    of olive while reducing water consumption.\n4664\nCMC, 2022, vol.72, no.3\nRecently,\
    \ smart irrigation system (also referred as precision irrigation system) is considered\
    \ as a\nkey solution to save the limited water resources as well as to improve\
    \ crop productivity and quality\n[1–11]. Indeed, the application of Internet of\
    \ things (IoT) allows prediction of olive tree’s needs\n(according to the sensed\
    \ environmental parameters from the soil or the climate), and provides optimal\n\
    decisions to the farmers about possible things to do, in real time [6]. Although\
    \ several IoT based\nirrigation systems have been introduced in literature [1–11],\
    \ there are several challenges that still need\nto be tackled [12–14].\nFirst,\
    \ since the use of wiring communication between various nodes is very expensive,\
    \ the existing\nworks adopted wireless solution, such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, IEEE\
    \ 802.15.4 standard, LoRaWAN\n(Low Rate Wide Area Networks), etc. However, these\
    \ technologies are not effective and do not\nsatisfy the increasing demands in\
    \ terms of spectral efficiency of the IoT based irrigation system.\nIndeed, in\
    \ such system, a huge number of low-power and low-complexity sensors and actuators\
    \ are\ninterconnected.\nSecond, another challenge identified with smart irrigation\
    \ systems using wireless technologies is\nthe topology of the olive orchards that\
    \ makes wireless signals susceptible to attenuation and results in\nnon line of\
    \ sight (NLoS) environment.\nThird, the deployment of smart communication technologies\
    \ and IoT raise the vulnerabilities\nand cybersecurity threats. Particularly,\
    \ in IoT irrigation system various threats may exist: privacy\nthreats, vulnerable\
    \ software, eavesdropping attacks, DoS (denial of service) attacks, MITM (man\
    \ in\nthe middle) attack, etc. [15,16]. Therefore, protecting the IoT systems\
    \ from cyber-attacks is a very\nimportant issue that was widely considered by\
    \ researchers in many existing works (see for example\n[12,15,16] and references\
    \ therein). In these studies, many security and privacy solutions were proposed,\n\
    such as privacy preserving [15], authentication, access control, data integrity\
    \ (using blockchain [16]),\ncryptography (as example elliptic curve cryptography\
    \ in [17]), key management, intrusion detection\nsystem (IDS) [18], etc. Nevertheless,\
    \ these proposed security schemes require high computational\ncomplexity, while\
    \ dealing with limited resources devices (in terms of energy, memory, storage,\
    \ and\ncomputing capability). As result, such solutions are not suitable for practical\
    \ implementation.\nIn this work, we aim to address the aforementioned challenges\
    \ and issues. To this end, we\npropose a smart and secure olive irrigation system\
    \ through the application of the massive multiple-\ninput multiple-output (M-MIMO)\
    \ technology [19,20]. Indeed, this technology represents a keystone\nof the fifth\
    \ generation (5G) and has the potential to improve spectral efficiency as well\
    \ as the\nphysical layer security [21,22]. Specifically, by exploiting the available\
    \ M-MIMO channel degrees of\nfreedom, we propose a physical layer security scheme\
    \ based on artificial noise (AN) [23–25] to prevent\neavesdropping.\nThe remaining\
    \ sections of the paper are organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide a survey\
    \ of\nrecent state of the art on smart irrigation systems. We describe our proposed\
    \ IoT-based irrigation\nsystem using the massive MIMO technology in Section 3.\
    \ In the fourth Section, we evaluate the\nperformance of our system using Monte\
    \ Carlo simulation. In the last Section, we conclude the paper.\n2 Recent State\
    \ of the Art\n2.1 IoT-Based Irrigation Systems\nIn literature, several IoT-based\
    \ irrigation systems have been introduced. This section summarizes\nexisting works.\
    \ In [6], authors considered a hedgerow olive orchard in Spain. They developed\
    \ an\nautomated irrigation system by using soil mapping and distant sensing techniques.\
    \ The proposed\nCMC, 2022, vol.72, no.3\n4665\nsystem in [6] is based on regulated\
    \ deficit irrigation strategies (RDI). However, in [6] all sensors were\nconnected\
    \ to a data logger via cable. Therefore, the distance between the various nodes\
    \ of the irrigation\nsystem is restricted by the maximum possible cable distance\
    \ in order to preserve a good quality of\nthe electrical signal. Note that there\
    \ are other several drawbacks when using wired sensors: lack of\nmobility, deployment\
    \ costs, cable damage and scalability.\nIn [4], a peach orchard is considered.\
    \ Brun-Laguna et al. deployed the Time-Slotted Channel\nHopping (TSCH) technology\
    \ in a wireless meshed sensor network. TSCH technology interconnects\nthe sensors\
    \ (or actuators) to the gateway (the edge node). Notice that other technologies\
    \ were also\nconsidered in other researches [1,2,5,7,10], such as Bluetooth, ZigBee,\
    \ IEEE 802.15.4 standard,\nLoRaWAN (Low Rate Wide Area Networks), etc. In LoRaWAN\
    \ technology less energy can be\nconsumed, whereas ZigBee and TSCH provide a more\
    \ reliable upstream/downstream. To ensure\ncommunication between the edge node\
    \ (gateway) and the public/private Cloud, cellular network\nlike GPRS (General\
    \ Packet Radio Service), GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications),\n3G (Third\
    \ Generation), 4G (Fourth Generation), 5G and WiFi (Wireless Fidelity) were deployed.\n\
    In [10], the deployment of an IoT based irrigation system, called AgriSens, was\
    \ presented. The\ndeployed irrigation system provided a real-time and dynamic\
    \ irrigation process since the diverse crop\ngrowth stages are considered. In\
    \ [10], GPRS and ZigBee ensure data transmission. In [2], wireless\nsensor network\
    \ (WSN) is adopted and authors proposed a precision irrigation system using GPRS\n\
    technology. Nevertheless, the irrigation threshold is a pre-set static for diverse\
    \ crop growth stages,\nwhich do not guarantee water saving. In [1], authors proposed\
    \ a distributed WSN based irrigation\nsystem for the arid as well as the semi\
    \ arid regions. Additionally, the communication protocol\nbetween the base station\
    \ and the sensor nodes is Bluetooth. Thus, the system of [1] do not support\n\
    high scalability and therefore it cannot be deployed in practice. In [7], Krishnan\
    \ et al. proposed a\nsmart irrigation system based on GSM technology. The farmer\
    \ can follow the task’s statuses (e.g.,\ntemperature, humidity and soil moisture)\
    \ via acknowledgement messages sent by the system. Authors\nproposed to use Fuzzy\
    \ logic controller in order to compute input parameters and to produce outputs\n\
    of motor status. Queté et al. [5] considered a smart IoT irrigation system wherein\
    \ the LoRaWAN media\naccess control (MAC) protocol is deployed. The performance\
    \ and scalability tradeoffs of LoRaWAN\ntechnology were studied in [5] for diverse\
    \ conditions (LoRaWAN spreading factor; distance between\nsensors and gateway;\
    \ number of sensors (sensor density). The results in [5] showed a significant\
    \ delay\nincrease with the sensor density as well as the spreading factor. The\
    \ paper of [8] described the designing\nof an IoT based irrigation system for\
    \ urban as well as rural farmers. Authors in [8] employ the MQTT\n(Message Queuing\
    \ Telemetry Transport) protocol. In [9] Bhoi et al. used machine learning (ML)\
    \ and\ninternet of things to deploy a smart irrigation system in Raipur, India.\
    \ In order to save water usage\nwith minimum human assistance, several ML-based\
    \ regression and classification models were used\nin [9]. Authors had integrated\
    \ the forecasted weather data in order to ensure the robustness of their\nsystem.\n\
    2.2 Addressing Security Issues in IoT Systems\nThe deployment of smart communication\
    \ technologies and IoT raise the vulnerabilities and\ncybersecurity threats. Therefore,\
    \ protecting the IoT systems from intruders is a very important issue\nthat was\
    \ widely considered by researchers in many existing works (see for example [12,16]\
    \ and\nreferences therein). In particular, Gupta et al. presented in [15] a study\
    \ on security and privacy of IoT\nsystems for precision agriculture. The work\
    \ of [15] outlined a multi-layered architecture suitable to the\nsmart farming\
    \ context and highlighted various cyber-attack scenarios. In [16], Yang et al.\
    \ presented a\nsurvey on smart farming and discussed the security challenges.\
    \ They considered the following security\n4666\nCMC, 2022, vol.72, no.3\nand privacy\
    \ solutions: privacy preserving [15], authentication, access control, data integrity\
    \ (using\nblockchain [16]), cryptography (as example elliptic curve cryptography\
    \ in [17]), key management,\nintrusion detection system [18], etc. Additionally,\
    \ other supplementary experiments based on solar\ninsecticidal lamps IoT were\
    \ done. In [12], García et al. presented a survey that summarizes the current\n\
    researches concerning smart irrigation systems. They discussed the challenges\
    \ and the best practices for\nthe deployment of sensor based irrigation systems.\
    \ In [17], the authors designed a security mechanism\nfor industrial IoT environment.\
    \ Ali et al. proposed a secure industrial IoT scheme based on HECC\n(hyper elliptic\
    \ curve cryptography). The purpose of work in [17] is to improve security of an\
    \ industrial\nIoT environment with reduced computational complexity. In [18],\
    \ Berguiga et al. considered an IoT\nbased healthcare system. Authors developed\
    \ a secure scheme using intrusion detection system. The\nproposed scheme protect\
    \ the healthcare system against DoS attacks caused by TCP SYN flooding\nattacker\
    \ nodes.\n3 Massive MIMO for IoT-Based Irrigation System\nIn this study, we propose\
    \ to adopt the massive MIMO technology to deploy a smart and secure\nirrigation\
    \ system for olive orchards. For this purpose, we design an IoT based architecture\
    \ that ensure\nthe interconnection of sensors and actuators to a base station\
    \ (acting as wireless gateway to the remote\nprocessing server). In the sequel,\
    \ we will elaborate our proposed system in detail.\n3.1 Network Model\nIn this\
    \ subsection, we describe the network model adopted in the present work. As illustrated\
    \ in\nFig. 1, we divide the olive orchards into L cells. Each cell operates separately\
    \ using one base station\n(BS). The l-th BS (1 ≤ l ≤ L) is equipped with Ml antennas\
    \ (Ml ≫ 1) and communicates with Kl\nsingle antenna sensor-actuator nodes (SANs).\
    \ The SANs are geographically distributed in the cell.\nPrecisely, we deploy beside\
    \ each olive tree a node responsible for sensing different environmental\nparameters\
    \ (provided by the soil or the climate) and acting accordingly. Each BS forwards\
    \ the sensed\ndata to a remote processing server. This server compares the gathered\
    \ information to the predefined\nthreshold values. For any deviation from the\
    \ threshold, the remote processing server will send, via\nthe corresponding base\
    \ station, a signal to the actuator for the purpose to activate the solenoid valve\n\
    that irrigates the olive tree (without the physical presence of the farmer). Additionally,\
    \ through the\nInternet, the farmers can visualize the information and running\
    \ activities of the olive orchard instantly\nin real time.\nIn uplink transmission\
    \ (from the SANs to the BS) for a given cell, the received signal at the BS,\n\
    yUL ∈ CMl, is modeled as:\nyUL =\nL\n\x02\nl=1\nKl\n\x02\nk=1\nhlkslk + n,\n(1)\n\
    where:\n• We omit the index of the cell for convenience.\n• hlk is the channel\
    \ between the SAN and the BS. We assume that the channel vector is independent\n\
    and identically distributed (i.i.d.) complex Gaussian samples of a random variable\
    \ with zero\nmean and unit variance.\n• slk ∼ N C (0, plk) denotes the signal\
    \ from the SAN to the BS, where plk = E\n\x03|slk|\n2\x04\nis the power\nof the\
    \ transmitted signal, where E {x} represents the expectation of a random variable\
    \ x.\nCMC, 2022, vol.72, no.3\n4667\nFigure 1: Proposed network model\n• n ∼ NC\n\
    \x05\n0, σ 2\nULI Ml\n\x06\nis the independent additive white noise with zero\
    \ mean and variance equal\nto σ 2\nUL.\nSimilarly, in downlink transmission (from\
    \ the BS to the k-th SAN, 1 ≤ k ≤ Kl and 1 ≤ l ≤ L),\nthe received signal at the\
    \ k-th SAN, yDL\nk\n∈ C, is modeled as:\nyDL\nk\n=\nL\n\x02\nl=1\nKl\n\x02\ni=1\n\
    (hlk)\nHwlixli + nk,\n(2)\nwhere:\n• hlk denotes the channel between the BS and\
    \ the k-th SAN. We assume that the channel vector is\nindependent and identically\
    \ distributed (i.i.d.) complex Gaussian samples of a random variable\nwith zero\
    \ mean and unit variance.\n• wlk\n∈ CMl represents the transmit precoding vector\
    \ (beamforming). This beam complies\nE\n\x03\n∥wlk∥2\x04\n= 1.\n• xlk ∼ NC (0,\
    \ ρlk) denotes the data signal intended for the k-th SAN in the l-th cell and\
    \ ρlk is the\nsignal power.\n• nk ∼ NC(0, σ 2\nDL) is independent additive white\
    \ noise with zero mean and variance σ 2\nDL.\nIn this paper, we assume that the\
    \ time division duplex (TDD) mode is used and perfect channel\nstate information\
    \ (CSI) of all channels is available at the BS. In this case, only uplink pilot\
    \ signals\n4668\nCMC, 2022, vol.72, no.3\nare required and no feedback is needed.\
    \ Indeed, the BS carry out the channel estimation by using the\nuplink pilot transmission\
    \ from each SAN.\n3.2 Spectral Efficiency of the IoT System\nSpectral efficiency\
    \ (SE) of an encoding (or decoding) scheme can be defined as the average number\n\
    of bits of information that it can reliably transmit over the channel under consideration\
    \ [21]. We will\nnow study the spectral efficiency that our proposed irrigation\
    \ system based on massive MIMO can\nachieve. To this end, we consider the multi-cell\
    \ minimum mean-squared error (M-MMSE) combining,\nas well as the maximum ratio\
    \ (MR) combining.\nThe uplink SE of the channel between the k-th SAN and the l-th\
    \ BS (1 ≤ k ≤ Kl and 1 ≤ l ≤ L),\ndenoted SE\nUL\nkl , can be expressed as:\n\
    SE\nUL\nkl = τ u\nτ c\nE\n\x03\nlog2\n\x05\n1 + SINR\nUL\nkl\n\x06\x04\n,\n(3)\n\
    where\n• τu represents the uplink data samples per coherence block.\n• τc = BcTc\
    \ denotes the number of samples per coherence block (Tc is the channel coherence\
    \ time\nand is the channel coherence bandwidth).\n• SINR\nUL\nkl denotes the uplink\
    \ signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) from the k-th SAN in\nthe l-th\
    \ cell.\nSimilarly, the downlink SE of the channel between the l-th BS and the\
    \ k-th SAN (where 1 ≤ l ≤ L\nand 1 ≤ k ≤ Kl), denoted SE\nDL\nlk , can be expressed\
    \ as:\nSE\nDL\nlk = τ d\nτ c\nE\n\x03\nlog2\n\x05\n1 + SINR\nDL\nlk\n\x06\x04\n\
    ,\n(4)\nwhere\n• τd represents the downlink data samples per coherence block.\
    \ We notice that τc = τu + τd + τp,\nwhere τ p denotes the number of samples allocated\
    \ for pilots per coherence block.\n• SINR\nDL\nlk denotes the dowlink signal to\
    \ interference plus noise ratio (SINR) of the k-th SAN in\nthe l-th cell.\n3.3\
    \ AN-Based Secure Olive Irrigation System\nIn IoT networks, particularly IoT irrigation\
    \ system, various threats may pose: privacy threats,\nvulnerable software, denial-of-service\
    \ (DoS) attacks, man-in-the-middle attack, eavesdropping attacks,\netc. [12].\
    \ In this section, we address the eavesdropping issue of the proposed olive irrigation\
    \ system.\nSpecifically, by exploiting the available massive MIMO channel degrees\
    \ of freedom, we propose a\nphysical layer security scheme based on artificial\
    \ noise (AN). We assume that one eavesdropper is\nlocated within the cell. The\
    \ key idea behind AN is that the BS transmits artificial noise in order to\ncontaminate\
    \ the received signal at the eavesdropper [23]. Consequently, the received signals\
    \ at the\neavesdropper can be expressed as follows:\nye =\nL\n\x02\nl=1\nKl\n\x02\
    \ni=1\n(he)\nHwlixli + (he)\nHxAN + ne,\n(5)\nwhere\nCMC, 2022, vol.72, no.3\n\
    4669\n• he represents channel between the BS and the eavesdropper. We assume that\
    \ the channel vector is\nindependent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) complex\
    \ Gaussian samples of a random variable\nwith zero mean and unit variance.\n•\
    \ xAN is the artificial noise vector.\n• ne ∼ NC\n\x05\n0, σ 2\ne\n\x06\nis independent\
    \ additive white noise with zero mean and variance σ 2\ne .\nThe achievable secrecy\
    \ sum rate for the k-th node is given by:\nR\nsecrecy\nk\n= (Rk − Re) ,\n(6)\n\
    where Rk (respectively Re) denotes the ergodic rate of the k-th SAN (of the eavesdropper).\n\
    The next section provides the simulation results of the proposed smart irrigation\
    \ systems.\n4 Performance Validation\nIn this section, we propose to validate\
    \ the performance of our proposed system using Monte Carlo\nSimulation in MATLAB.\
    \ We assume equal transmit power per SAN in both uplink and downlink.\nWithout\
    \ loss of generality, we assume also that the number of BS antennas (respectively\
    \ the number\nof SANs) is the same in all cells (i.e., Ml = M and Kl = K, for\
    \ 1 ≤ l ≤ L). We consider two propagation\nmodels: the line of sight (LoS) propagation\
    \ and the non line of sight (NLoS) propagation. We give the\nsimulation parameters\
    \ in Tab. 1.\nTable 1: Simulation parameters\nParameters\nValue\nNumber of cells\
    \ (L)\n15\nSNR\n0 dB\nUplink data samples per coherence block\n90\nNumber of samples\
    \ per coherence block\n200\nDownlink data samples per coherence block\n90\nFig.\
    \ 2 shows the average uplink sum spectral efficiency (SE) of the studied system\
    \ as function of\nthe number of antennas at the BS, M. The number of SANs per\
    \ cell is chosen K = 25. In this figure,\nwe consider the MR and the M-MMSE combining\
    \ for the LoS (Red curves) and NLoS (Blue curves)\nchannel models. As expected,\
    \ the sum spectral efficiency increases linearly with M for all considered\ncases\
    \ since the spatial diversity increases.\nFig. 2 illustrates the average uplink\
    \ sum spectral efficiency (SE) of the IoT system vs. the number\nof SANs per cell,\
    \ K. The number antennas at the BS is fixed to M = 100. As in Fig. 2, we consider\n\
    also the MR and the M-MMSE combining for different channel models (LoS and NLoS).\
    \ In Fig. 3,\nit can be seen that the sum spectral efficiency of the system increases\
    \ linearly with K for all considered\ncases since the multi users diversity increases.\n\
    4670\nCMC, 2022, vol.72, no.3\nFigure 2: Uplink sum spectral efficiency in term\
    \ of the number of base station (BS) antennas, M, for\ntwo channel models, maximum\
    \ ratio (MR) combiner, multi cell minimum mean-squared error (M-\nMMSE) combiner\
    \ and number of sensor-actuator nodes (SANs) per cell, K = 25\nFigure 3: Uplink\
    \ sum spectral efficiency in term of K (the number of SANs per cell), for two\
    \ channel\nmodels, MR combiner, multi cell MMSE combiner and number of BS antennas\
    \ M = 100\nMoreover, from both Figs. 2 and 3, one can see that the M-MMSE combining\
    \ outperforms the\nMR combining. This can be explained by the fact that the multi-cell\
    \ MMSE combiner prevents\ninterferences better than the MR one. In addition, if\
    \ we consider the maximum ration combiner,\nwe notice that the spectral efficiency\
    \ of our IoT system is significantly higher for the situation\nof line of sight\
    \ propagation. However, if we consider the multi-cell MMSE combiner, we get the\n\
    contrary performances. We can explain the obtained result as follow: in the NLoS\
    \ situation, each\nSAN is influenced by interference caused by several SANs, however,\
    \ in the LoS situation only a small\nnumber of SANs having close angles and causing\
    \ intense interference. Since the resulted interference is\nsuppressed, as with\
    \ multi cell MMSE combiner, the spectral efficiency is higher in the NLoS situation.\n\
    We plot in Fig. 4, the average uplink sum spectral efficiency (SE) of the proposed\
    \ irrigation system\nin term of the BS antennas to SANs ratio, M/K. In this figure,\
    \ we consider the M-MMSE combining\nscheme for both channel models (LoS and NLoS).\
    \ We can notice that the sum spectral efficiency\ngrows linearly with the BS antennas\
    \ to SANs ratio M/K. Indeed, when the number of BS antennas\nM increases proportionally\
    \ to K (M/K ≫ 1), the inter-user interference (that increases with K) is\nCMC,\
    \ 2022, vol.72, no.3\n4671\nsuppressed. Notice that the case when M/K = 1 represents\
    \ the traditional scheme adopted in the\nliterature. We can clearly deduce that\
    \ our proposed scheme (M/K ≫ 1) outperforms the traditional\none (M/K = 1). In\
    \ fact, for the LoS case when M/K = 4 we obtain a 300% gain in spectral efficiency\n\
    as compared to the traditional scheme. Moreover, as previously mentioned, the\
    \ SE of the irrigation\nsystem is considerably low in the line of sight situation\
    \ when using the M-MMSE combiner.\nFigure 4: Average uplink sum spectral efficiency\
    \ in term of the BS antennas to SANs ratio, M/K, for\nthe M-MMSE combining scheme\
    \ and different channel models\nWe notice that, for simplicity, we provide (in\
    \ Figs. 2–4) only the results of uplink spectral efficiency\nsince the downlink\
    \ spectral efficiency in our case study is very similar to the uplink spectral\
    \ efficiency\n(especially when M ≫ 1).\nIn Fig. 5, we plot the secrecy sum rate\
    \ for the k-th SAN in term of the signal to noise ratio (SNR).\nThe figure shows\
    \ that the secrecy performance of the irrigation system is enhanced the use of\
    \ artificial\nnoise, especially when the SNR is greater than 10 dB.\nFigure 5:\
    \ Achievable secrecy sum rate for the k-th SAN in term of the signal to noise\
    \ ratio (SNR)\n4672\nCMC, 2022, vol.72, no.3\n5 Conclusions\nIn this work, we\
    \ considered the problems of spectral efficiency and security in IoT-based irrigation\n\
    systems for Olive Orchards in the Jouf region, KSA. We proposed the application\
    \ of the massive\nMIMO technology. Indeed, this technology represents a keystone\
    \ of the fifth generation (5G) and\nhas the potential to improve spectral efficiency\
    \ as well as the physical layer security. Specifically,\nwe proposed to deploy\
    \ under each olive tree a node responsible for sensing different environmental\n\
    parameters (provided by the soil or the climate) and acting accordingly. The sensed\
    \ data are forwarded\nto a remote processing server. This server compares the\
    \ gathered information to the predefined\nthreshold values. For any deviation\
    \ from the threshold, the remote processing server will send, via the\ncorresponding\
    \ base station, a signal to the actuator for the purpose to activate the solenoid\
    \ valve that\nirrigates the olive tree. Additionally, by exploiting the available\
    \ M-MIMO channel degrees of freedom,\nwe deployed a physical layer security scheme\
    \ based on artificial noise (AN) to prevent eavesdropping.\nNumerical results\
    \ demonstrated that our proposed scheme outperforms traditional ones in terms\
    \ of\nspectral efficiency and secrecy rate.\nIn future work, we aim to address\
    \ the problem of power allocation in order to optimize the\nproposed IoT-based\
    \ irrigation system.\nAcknowledgement: The authors extend their appreciation to\

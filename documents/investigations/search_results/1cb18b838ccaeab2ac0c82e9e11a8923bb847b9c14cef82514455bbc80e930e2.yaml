  description: 'In this contribution, we sketch an application of Earth System Sciences
    and Cloud-/Big-Data-based IT, which shall soon leverage European supercomputing
    facilities: smart viticulture, as put into practice by Terraview. TerraviewOS
    is a smart vineyard “operating system”, allowing wine cultivators to optimise
    irrigation, harvesting dates and measures against plant diseases. The system relies
    on satellite and drone imagery as well as in-situ sensors where available. Clearly,
    processing behind the UI is heavily based on Cloud Computing, with some Edge Computing
    close to the user or High-Performance/GPU Computing components. The substantial
    need for computing power in TerraviewOS, in particular for training AI-based models
    to generate derived data products, makes the further development of some of its
    modules a prime use case for the EU-funded Extreme Data processing project “EXA4MIND”
    (Horizon Europe GA No. 101092944). Two of the strongest academic supercomputing
    centres in Europe take part in EXA4MIND. The collaboration to evolve the “Smart
    Moisture Mapper” subsystem of TerraviewOS in this context is briefly sketched.
    Connecting database systems, High-Performance-/Cloud-Computing systems and European
    Data Spaces with appropriate data access and transfer mechanisms, EXA4MIND shall
    demonstrate competitive advantage in scientific and enterprise data analysis needed
    in complex applications such as TerraviewOS.'

  description: Soil moisture plays an important role in crop yield estimation, irrigation
    management, etc. Remote sensing technology has potential for large-scale and high
    spatial soil moisture mapping. However, offline remote sensing data processing
    is time-consuming and resource-intensive, and significantly hampers the efficiency
    and timeliness of soil moisture mapping. Due to the high-speed computing capabilities
    of remote sensing cloud platforms, a High Spatial Resolution Soil Moisture Estimation
    Framework (HSRSMEF) based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform was developed
    in this study. The functions of the HSRSMEF include research area and input datasets
    customization, radar speckle noise filtering, optical-radar image spatio-temporal
    matching, soil moisture retrieving, soil moisture visualization and exporting.
    This paper tested the performance of HSRSMEF by combining Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2
    images and in-situ soil moisture data in the central farmland area of Jilin Province,
    China. Reconstructed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) based on the
    Savitzky-Golay algorithm conforms to the crop growth cycle, and its correlation
    with the original NDVI is about 0.99 (P < 0.001). The soil moisture accuracy of
    the random forest model (R 2 = 0.942, RMSE = 0.013 m3/m3) is better than that
    of the water cloud model (R 2 = 0.334, RMSE = 0.091 m3/m3). HSRSMEF transfers
    time -consuming offline operations to cloud computing platforms, achieving rapid
    and simplified high spatial resolution soil moisture mapping.

    Soil moisture plays an important role in crop yield estimation, irrigation management,
    etc. Remote sensing technology has potential for large-scale and high spatial

    and resource-intensive, and significantly hampers the efficiency and timeliness
    of soil moisture mapping. Due to the high-speed computing capabilities of remote
    sensing cloud platforms, a High Spatial Resolution Soil Moisture Estimation Framework
    (HSRSMEF) based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform was developed in this
    study. The functions of the HSRSMEF include research area and input datasets customization,
    radar speckle noise filtering, optical-radar image spatio-temporal matching, soil
    moisture retrieving, soil moisture visualization and exporting. This paper tested
    the performance of HSRSMEF by combining Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 images and in-situ
    soil moisture data in the central farmland area of Jilin Province, China. Reconstructed

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Greater Noida, India SECTION I. Introduction
    Using cutting-edge latest technology like IoT devices, big data, the platform
    as a service, and mobile computing, many applications have been developed in recent
    years. At this time, the world is heading toward concepts like smartphones, intelligent
    buildings, and smart homes. Agriculture plays a significant role in India''s economy.
    For the vast majority of Indian communities, it is still a way of life [1]. Ineffective
    crop maintenance results in a huge loss for just one farmer, which is why the
    concept of \"smart agriculture\" had been initiated. Precision agriculture increases
    crop production by utilizing cutting-edge technologies. It aids in system monitoring
    and provides data about various environmental aspects. Monitoring the environmental
    factors is neither an adequate nor comprehensive method of boosting crop yield.
    Productivity is also greatly influenced by many other factors. One of these factors
    is insect and pest attacks by applying the appropriate pesticides and insecticides
    to the crop, which can be controlled. As soon as the crops are prepared for harvest,
    birds and certain other wild animals start stealing them. As a result, farmers
    encounter numerous difficulties during the planting and harvesting processes.
    All issues can be resolved by taking into account every aspect and building an
    integrated system with the aid of the technologies listed below. A. IoT (Internet
    - of -Things) In the modern world, the Internet is crucial for all industries.
    The suggested approach is used in the arable domains to use the concept of the
    Internet of Things to screen the agricultural areas. Using sensor network wireless
    technology, sensors are used in the agricultural sector to analyze various parameters.
    The proposed method is used to gather the characteristics of the soil, which are
    then saved in a cloud server [2]. The amount and variety of agricultural data
    have grown alarmingly as a result of IOT''s emergence in the agricultural sector.
    Agriculture''s storage and analysis issues can be resolved using big data technologies
    as well as cloud computing. IoT has made it possible to apply agricultural production
    to big data in ever-deeper ways, and big data analysis as well provides technical
    support for agricultural computer technology. This allows farmers to continue
    to perceive as well as monitor the optimal time for planting crops. Big data is
    regarded as a breakthrough in the field of modern information technology, notably
    in the Iot and cloud, as it is the slashing technique for smart applications as
    well as mining. Big data background information and its internet connections of
    things were provided by ZF Sun et al (IoT), highlighted key technologies, examined
    the requirements for big data across the major application domains, and presented
    some recommendations and concepts for further growth in big data as well as precision
    farming. Big data-based solutions could increase supply chain efficiency and agricultural
    productivity. Resource sharing is offered by cloud computing at a price. The services
    are provided by providers of cloud computing at a reasonable price. It has served
    as a storage location for agricultural data. Along with IoT, it is utilized in
    the agricultural sector [3]. Big data is a sizable method of collecting data that
    has been amassed over time from many sources, such as sensor data, network security
    data, but also business data. Gathering, storing, analyzing, as well as searching
    the data is the main challenge. It is employed in business intelligence, data
    processing, and big data analytics to look for patterns in the data that are not
    yet known to science. Big data is utilized in the agricultural industry to monitor
    the entire chain of supply of goods and cut costs. Big data analytics is a method
    for fusing traditional and commercial analytics [4]. Techniques are applied to
    data analysis and prediction. The methods include association rule mining, clustering
    algorithms, and classification algorithms. A few good examples of algorithms include
    decision trees, k-nearest neighbor algorithms, C4.5, RepTree, J48, SVM, computer
    vision, naive Bayes K-means techniques for classification priority algorithms,
    as well as Fpgrowth algorithms. It has been used to categorize different types
    of soil by looking at their characteristics. It provides flexibility and is useful
    for both monitoring field data and controlling field operations. Big data technologies
    include Hdfs, Hadoop, Stream Processing, Pig, Apache Hadoop, Typhoons, Wild Mustang,
    and others. There is a vast and diverse amount of data available in the agricultural
    industry [5]. It has been suggested to use a mobile computing system to send farmers
    daily, seasonal messages with product and weather knowledge [6]. It was properly
    determined with an importance placed on information. The main focus is on the
    agricultural industry and employs a novel methodology to learn about design, conceptual
    framework, development, and evaluation. SECTION II. Literature Survey In the field
    of agriculture, system models have a significant impact on the emergence of agroecological
    and socioeconomic conditions. We can determine appropriate and effective management
    strategies and provide information by making use of the field as well as farm
    experiments. It can assist with determining the monitoring to land users all through
    space and time as long as the required soil, strategic planning, climatic factors,
    and socioeconomic status information is available. Data are created using decision-support
    systems (DSSs) for the farm as well as pest management. Modern techniques are
    not being used in these processes to process the data. Therefore, use intelligent
    technique concepts to decide how to solve the issue. It is crucial to the understanding
    of modern agricultural results, and more farmers are using them as decision-support
    tools. A brand-new method for categorizing and forecasting the weather has been
    developed by Sanjay D.Sawaitul and colleagues. The technique keeps track of weather
    variables like airspeed, wind direction, rainfall, temp, and climatic forecasting.
    The backpropagation algorithm for artificial neural networks is used to forecast
    the weather. For weather prediction, the author tested three models. The first
    framework is used to compile the weather forecasting techniques. Utilizing the
    third template, the Rear Algorithm is applied to various forecasting parameters,
    and also the new model is then used to start introducing the WSN toolbox for the
    collection of data. [7]. Authors in [8] proposed a method for crop yield prediction
    using fuzzified set theory and probabilistic reasoning. The climate conditions
    are used to predict crop yields based on the farmer''s experience. The research
    project on data mining techniques for crop yield analysis in agriculture has been
    proposed by Ramesh D. et al. From 1965 to 2009, they gathered data in India''s
    Andhra Pradesh region''s East Godavari district. The information includes the
    year, rainfall, sowing area, and production. The crop yield is predicted based
    on rainfall using multiple regression (MLR) as well as K-Means techniques. This
    prototype is used to forecast yield production with high generality and high accuracy
    [9]. Using a decision tree algorithm, the author [10] projected her research findings
    in the agricultural sector. This methodology is used to boost the soybean crop''s
    productivity. They gathered information on the climatic factors during the rabi
    and kharif seasons in the Bhopal District of Madhya Pradesh State. Predicated
    here on the Navie Bayesian classification method, they predict the paddy crop
    yield using the temperature and rainfall variables. Based here on climate conditions,
    the economic output of wheat production is determined. Wen-Yaw Chung and colleagues
    have introduced their work in the area of agriculture that combines wireless sensor
    technology and the cloud. Temperature, humidity, pH level, and other information
    are monitored and collected in the agricultural environment using sensors. The
    sensors are employed to collect data much more quickly. The system consists of
    hardware as well as smart devices with adequate storage capacities that can be
    used to remotely access and monitor land information [11]. Duncan Waga and colleagues
    describe their work. Analytics in cloud computing is crucial to agriculture. The
    capability to access the relevant data is also very advantageous to the framers.
    They store and retrieve data using a private cloud. For effective data collection
    and aggregation, distributed, flexible services are used, such as HDFS. Performance,
    capacity, and scaling challenges are met when using the cloud as well as big data.
    In this work, parameters like winds, temperature, and rainfall are used. Hadoop
    packages must be implemented in the innovative IT platform [12]. The Internet
    of Things and cloud computing, according to Rao et al., collaborate to address
    the Big Data issue. They consider cloud-based sensing services, which have a few
    particular uses, like farming and environmental monitoring. To provide the sensed
    data as a cloud service, they propose a brand-new prototype model. Applications
    and services are increasingly able to interact with the real world thanks to wireless
    sensor networks. The sensing network and such services might be on different sides
    of the Internet. With the aid of big data technologies and cloud services, the
    data can be used for storing and analysis. It has the potential to increase cloud
    services'' scalability and usability [13]. Rajesh et al., present their work in
    the area of agriculture. Cloud computing and sensor data were combined. Here sensor
    node is integrated and managed using the service-oriented architecture. The technology
    of cloud computing allows for the use of storing and making data accessible to
    users. Both the new app and the new database are available from them. The cloud
    computing model and the internet incorporate sensor networks. The sensor network
    is used to record industrial processes. The information gathered is crucial for
    the sector and provides the data quickly [14]. SECTION III. Proposed Methodology
    A. IoT system for agriculture The agricultural industry is one of the areas of
    IOT development that is most urgent and significant. The production, processing,
    as well as distribution of agricultural products, are all impacted by the IOT
    application system for agriculture. Agriculture has gradually transitioned from
    a human-centered production model that relied on isolated machinery to information-
    as well as a software-centered production model that uses a lot of automated,
    smart, wireless router production equipment thanks to IOT technology [15]. To
    achieve the maximum earnings of agricultural output, operators, growers, along
    with managers, the agricultural IOT system''s data can be used to change the planting
    plans of farmers. IOT for agricultural output is integrated into a hierarchy organization
    at the business level. There are a total of 5 layers, from lowest to highest.
    Fig. 1. Block diagram for Internet of Things Based Agricultural System Show All
    Sensor layers: It can gather fundamental data about the surroundings for growth,
    logistics, but also storage, including observing, trading, storage, but instead
    weather information. Transport layers: Here communication''s cabled and wireless
    components are combined at the transport layer. To ensure the consistency of data
    transmissions, the consistency of data, as well as the speed and simplicity of
    transmission and exchange, the backbone network mainly uses make a great contribution.
    The business layer is used in quality certification bodies to track environmental
    variables, growth variables, and different kinds of data. Application layers:
    Depending on the roles, it is split into various application portals., such as
    senior managers, producers, suppliers, broadcast providers, consumers, etc. User
    layer: Using security systems and techniques to ensure secure access to that information
    as well as guard against malware attacks and data tampering. Figure 1 illustrates
    the fundamental structure. B. Mining data Data mining is frequently used in business,
    manufacturing, research, and development, as research of sets of data, application
    value, as well as technical value in other industries [16]. Fig. 2. Process flow
    of Data mining Show All 1) Establish the goals for the project Setting goals will
    help you formulate your strategic goal more effectively and must consist of the
    project''s final cost. 2) Gathering of data Data gathering involves gathering
    as well as analyzing relevant decisions making in a given situation [17]. Data
    collection methods include business surveys, network crawling, and data extraction
    from existing data systems. 3) Processing data in advance The collected data are
    \"formatted\" during this procedure in preparation for model training but instead
    statistics. The gathered Data that have not undergone data preprocessing and other
    steps may yield inaccurate results during the mining process. Fig. 3. Flow of
    Preprocessing Show All Data preprocessing should be responsible for more than
    80% of the students who are working during the entire data mining process. 4)
    Analyzing data The method of converting useless data into knowledge is known as
    data mining. Knowledge discovery is the process of identifying patterns in a sizable
    amount of information and using an analysis technique or an algorithm. Finally,
    through analysis as well as result comparison, we should select the most suitable
    mining algorithm. 5) Model evaluation Model evaluation is an approach for the
    in-depth examination of data mining results. This project''s main objective is
    to assess the data mining findings. Analyzing the root of the error is necessary
    if the data mining outcome significantly differs from the user''s intended outcome
    [18]. The most popular and efficient technology in use today for processing agricultural
    information data is data mining. Increasing crop yield requires the use of data
    mining techniques to mine agro-based information data and improve crop productivity
    to give users timely agricultural planting information. 6) Data mining software
    The primary goal of clustering analysis, which is a crucial part of data mining,
    is to organize various similar items into clusters or clusters by the attribute
    of the objects they describe, allowing for the placement of highly similar objects
    in the same clusters and the best possible differentiation between objects from
    different clusters. Data aggregation analysis is a common method for data reduction
    in statistical analysis. C. K-means algorithm The K-means algorithm is a popular
    clustering algorithm because it is both effective and straightforward. Using a
    random number generator, determine the Euclidean distance between each sample
    point and the clustering center, and then use the nearest criterion to assign
    each sample point to the classes that share the most similarities with the clustering
    center [19]. The average values of all sample points within every category are
    computed while the segmentation core is refreshed until the impartial criterion
    function converges. This is the precise procedure: The database containing N objects
    and the K clusters'' total number is the input data. K clusters in the output
    data, attempting to make the MSE stack this same smallest. D. Recommend Exercise
    The chosen data are produced following the growers'' data requirements in this
    article. The following are the primary requirements. By obtaining a large amount
    of scientific information, which includes soil temperature, ambient temperature,
    air humidity, and soil moisture, one can determine the growth environmental curve
    of young plants in each fixed cycle. The sensors measure the soil, air, heating
    rate, and some other relevant data in just a few minutes, producing a significant
    amount of data in just one hour. In this article, data mining is done using the
    k-means method of analysis based on the most significant distance. This is the
    precise procedure: Select a point at random to act as the through one center Constantly
    update the shortest route between clustering centers and all other points that
    aren''t cluster centers. If the amount of grouping anchor nodes is lower than
    k, move on to the following step; otherwise, the selection is complete. Continue
    with the previous step after updating the least distance between the set of anchor
    nodes and all parallel nodes in the network, determining the greatest benefit
    inside the shortest path array, and designating the data points that correspond
    to the true worth as the centroids. Compared to the K-means algorithm, a more
    careful selection of the nearest centroid is made, resulting in less iteration.
    The study''s findings and analysis. In this article, MATLAB is used to compare
    the effectiveness of the K-means algorithm as well as the optimum range K-means
    algorithm. After the information is clustered that uses the K-means algorithm,
    quantities are selected to establish the clustering infrastructure for iteration.
    Then, K-means automated system is based on the best distance used to cluster data.
    SECTION IV. Result and Discussion The F assessments of the interactions determine
    algorithms are compared in Figures 4 as well as in Figure 5. Comparing the improved
    K-means graph-based method to the existing K-means cluster analysis technology;
    the F measure is increased by 7.67%. While decreasing overall time consumption
    by an average of 0.23 seconds. Fig. 4. Clustering algorithm F-value comparison
    Show All The aforementioned experimental results demonstrate that the improved
    algorithm has the best clustering effect as well as time performance. Fig. 5.
    Comparison in terms of time consumption Show All Data management and data mineral
    extraction modules served as the foundation for the data analysis and data quarrying
    modules used in the simulation experiments for this study. It was found that the
    initial cluster center was chosen at random, which accounts for the quick initialization
    speed of the K-means algorithm. However, because the K-means clustering algorithm
    selects cluster centers at random, two data that should only form one cluster
    can easily be mistakenly counted as two clusters, trying to increase the clustering
    algorithm''s overall repetition count. As a result, clustering takes longer overall,
    and it is simple to reach a local optimum. The improved algorithm chooses a highly
    distinct initial cluster center. On the one hand, it minimizes the number of variations
    and prevents reaching a local optimum; on the other, it enhances the cluster''s
    Fvalue and exhibits strong stability. SECTION V. Conclusion and Future Scope This
    article uses IOT technology and data information extraction from big data to crop
    results, putting the focus on the corporation''s priorities of modern agricultural
    development, to create a smart farming landscape which thus replicates the good
    control and management of agricultural greenhouses. In light of the thorough analysis
    and appreciation of sustainable farming utilizing the Internet of Things and big
    data technology, the K-means edge detection using the legal maximum method for
    selecting the initial cluster is proposed. Additionally, the experimental simulation
    is used to study and improve the data memory, processing, as well as mineral extraction
    in the agro-based big data generated by IOT technology. Based on a thorough analysis
    as well as consideration of agricultural production based on IOT as well Using
    big data, this same maximum allowable K-means onset procedure is proposed to select
    the ideal parameters. Through experimental simulation, the data manufacturing,
    storage, and mining in the IoT device’s big data for agricultural production are
    also analyzed and optimized. In the future, neural networks can be used to analyze.

    Preview Introduction Water management and irrigation systems have been an integral
    part of human civilization for thousands of years. From the ancient civilizations
    of Mesopotamia to the modern-day societies, water management has played a crucial
    role in sustaining human life and fostering economic development. The history
    of water management can be traced back to the early agricultural societies, where
    farmers used simple techniques, such as diverting water from rivers and streams
    to irrigate their crops. In many parts of the world, water was considered a scarce
    resource, and the ability to manage it effectively was critical for survival.
    As societies became more complex, so did their water management systems. Xiao
    Yun Zheng (2021) explains the water management in ancient Egypt, for example,
    the construction of canals and reservoirs allowed farmers to harness the power
    of the Nile River to irrigate their crops. The Maya civilization of Central America
    also developed sophisticated water management systems that allowed them to grow
    crops in areas with limited rainfall. The importance of water management and irrigation
    systems continued to grow as societies became more urbanized and industrialized.
    In the 19th century, the Industrial Revolution led to the development of large-scale
    irrigation systems that allowed for the cultivation of crops on a massive scale.
    The construction of dams and reservoirs also became increasingly common, providing
    a reliable source of water for both agriculture and industry. Today, water management
    and irrigation systems are more important than ever. As the world''s population
    continues to grow and climate change brings more unpredictable weather patterns,
    the need for effective water management has become critical. Governments and organizations
    around the world are investing in advanced water management technologies and infrastructure
    to ensure that future generations have access to clean water and food security.
    In short, the history of water management and irrigation systems is a testament
    to humanity''s ability to adapt and innovate in the face of challenges. As we
    look towards the future, it is clear that effective water management will play
    a critical role in ensuring the health and prosperity of our planet and its people.
    We all know about the scenario of water scarcity. It affects not only rural areas
    but also urban areas. This scarcity is further exacerbated by the uneven distribution
    of rainfall between locations and at different times of the year. As per information
    given by AQUASTAT, the global information system of the Food and Agricultural
    Organization of the United Nations (FOA), the agricultural industry uses 69% of
    the fresh water available on Earth. Water''s significance and requirement may
    be seen in the agricultural production industry and for ensuring food security.
    Almost 40% of the world''s food is produced by irrigated agriculture. But farmers
    still irrigate their crops using conventional irrigation systems. These systems
    are time- and labor-intensive and ineffective, especially when several fields
    are dispersed over various geographical areas. For instance, in developing nations,
    farmers are required to constantly visit their fields and remain there when irrigation
    is taking place in order to manage and plan irrigation in the area in question.
    Moreover, conventional irrigation frequently results in the issue of overwatering,
    which uses a lot of water. Moreover, it may result in concerns with inadequate
    irrigation, which impacts crop quality. Farmers that only use rainwater for irrigation
    are concerned about this. As a result, it becomes extremely important to monitor
    and manage each crop''s water requirements. Regardless of weather, soil type,
    or crop variety, this irrigation method must carefully match the water needs of
    the entire field. Due to evaporation and a lack of suitable resources, a large
    amount of irrigation water is squandered. Irrigation system management of water
    resources becomes crucial in agriculture to aid farmers in improving their produce.
    A smart irrigation system strategy has emerged to solve this issue. The system
    will be more practical and able to monitor a variety of characteristics, including
    temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, utilizing a variety of sensors thanks
    to the use of IoT. Continue Reading References Follow Reference Agarwal, S., &

    Location: Greater Noida, India SECTION I. Introduction It is suggested to develop
    a new model of agricultural growth that would consider institutional and technological
    change to be endogenous components of the economic system. The role played by
    the public sector in the advancement of agricultural technology is also highlighted.
    According to common knowledge, an environmentally sound and financially competitive
    agricultural technology that requires constant resource adaptation as well as
    favourable cultural, economic, and political variables is the basis of successful
    agricultural development. The \"induced development model\" tries to emphasise
    every step of the change-inducing process, including adjustments to the supply
    and demand for materials and products as well as adjustments made by farmers,
    agribusinesses, and administrators. Simply defined, a technical advancement that
    produces new and more effective inputs may be primarily driven by either (a) lower
    labour costs or (b) lower land costs. The fact that the nonagricultural sector
    contributes the technological inputs [1] that can substitute labour and land in
    agriculture production shows how important this process is to it. Farmers in the
    agriculture industry and IoT devices are increasingly bridging the digital divide.
    Future food production that is more environmentally friendly will increase output,
    and the environment will be safeguarded by using water wisely and maximising inputs
    and treatments. Remote monitoring, decision-support tools, automatic irrigation
    systems, frost prevention, fertilising, and other methods are all part of smart
    agriculture. IoT technology [2], which consists of hardware, intelligent software,
    integration platforms, monitoring techniques, operating systems, and cloud computing,
    enables these procedures. Intelligent greenhouses, which can include hydroponic
    and micro aquaponic systems, are another use for the Internet of Things. Intelligent
    greenhouses are becoming more prevalent in metropolitan areas because they enable
    the monitoring of a variety of fertiliser solution parameters and enhance plant
    growth, productivity, and quality. These innovations make a sizable contribution
    to the development of smart cities with infrastructures that support automation,
    enhancement [3,] and advancement of precision agriculture and urban agriculture.
    Vertical agriculture, which enables controlling soil moisture and water content
    using computers or mobile devices like tablets and smartphones, is another business
    that leverages IoT technology. After examining the numerous publications, we discovered
    soil analyses and analyses of the NPK values of the soil, but we did not have
    the idea of modifying the NPK values of the soil to make them acceptable for a
    given crop. In light of this, we now have a method for resolving the agricultural
    issue by quickly determining the soil''s NPK values and analysing the crops using
    factors such as temperature, humidity, and moisture content. Outline: There are
    five further major sections in the research article. The related research in the
    area of smart agriculture using sensor technology and the Internet of Things (IoT),
    some of it utilising various learning methods, is covered in Section II. Information
    on the parameters and algorithms utilised in the suggested study is detailed in
    Section III. The conclusions of the investigation of the experimental data are
    analysed and discussed in Section IV. The study''s evaluation of the model and
    findings are presented in Section V. The paper''s conclusion, Section VI, offers
    potential directions for the suggested study. SECTION II. Related Study An IoT-based
    smart agriculture monitoring system that employs a Raspberry Pi to track soil
    moisture, temperature, humidity, and light was proposed by V. Mohanraj and M.
    Rajkumar [4]. When any of the readings fall outside the specified range, the system
    sends alerts to the farmer''s phone. According to the authors, this technique
    can increase agricultural productivity while using less water. An Internet of
    Things (IoT)-based monitoring system that uses several sensors to keep track of
    soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and light was proposed by S. S. Panchal
    and P. B. Mane [5]. Additionally, the system has a control mechanism that enables
    remote adjustments of irrigation and other settings. The authors contend that
    their approach can boost crop productivity while decreasing water waste. An Internet
    of Things (IoT)-based smart irrigation system that employs soil moisture sensors
    to predict when to water crops was proposed by A. V. Farghaly and A. M. T. Moussa
    [6]. In order to alter the irrigation schedule, the system also has a weather
    station that records temperature and rainfall. According to the authors, their
    technique can cut water use by up to 50%. An IoT-based smart farming system with
    several sensors to track soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and light is proposed
    by A. Hussain and S. H. Shah [7]. In order to alter the irrigation schedule, the
    system also has a weather station that records temperature and rainfall. The authors
    assert that their technique can increase crop productivity while consuming less
    water. Precision farming, smart irrigation, and crop monitoring are just a few
    of the IoT-based smart agriculture applications covered by S. S. Panchal and P.
    B. Mane [8]. Additionally, the authors discuss some of the difficulties that IoT-based
    smart agriculture faces, such as data security, power management, and scalability.
    SECTION III. Parameters and Algorithms A. Soil Analysis The results of soil testing
    are essential to applying fertiliser, lime, and other soil amendments successfully.
    The soil test results and information on the nutrients that are available to the
    various crops can be combined to create a strong foundation for planning the fertility
    programme. A relevant test may be selected based on local soil and crop conditions,
    as well as personal preference. A standard test frequently includes variables
    such as the cation exchange capacity (CEC), pH, accessible Nitrogen (N), phosphorus
    (P), exchangeable potassium (K), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg), as well as
    their saturation percentages. The presence of organic matter (OM), salinity, nitrate,
    sulphate, certain micronutrients, and heavy metals may also be tested for in some
    laboratories. The environment for crop growth is further influenced by the soil''s
    texture (amount of sand, silt, and clay), degree of compaction, moisture content,
    and other mechanical and physical soil characteristics. Accurate assessments of
    soil macronutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK)) are necessary
    for efficient agricultural output, including sitespecific crop management (SSCM),
    where fertiliser nutrient treatment rates are altered spatially depending on local
    requirements. Quick, non-destructive evaluation of soil properties [8], [including
    nutrient levels] has become possible with optical diffuse reflectance sensing.
    Another technique, electrochemical sensing based on ion-selective electrodes or
    ion-selective field effect transistors, has been acknowledged as useful in real-time
    analysis due to its portability, simplicity, quick response, and ability to directly
    measure the analyte with a wide range of sensitivity. Soil, since a particular
    crop requires a specific pH level in the soil. This pH sensor measures the soil''s
    pH and sends the data to a server, where users may access the information and
    add chemicals to maintain the pH at the right level for crops. The soil moisture
    sensor works in a manner similar to the soil pH sensor. The server receives the
    data after it has been collected, and depending on the information it receives,
    may take the appropriate action, such as moisturising the soil with spray pumps
    if necessary [9] or regulating the playhouse''s temperature to maintain a proper
    moisture content. B. Algorithm for Soil Analysis For the agricultural sector,
    a managed water supply is crucial. As a result, we include the autonomous water
    supply system in our model. It functions according to the moisture level of the
    soil. As a result, the water pump is initially in the \"OFF\" position, but as
    soon as the soil moisture content drops below 40%, the associated value generates
    \"Low moisture content\" and the water pump switches to \"ON.\" Similarly, if
    the soil moisture content is between 40% and 60%, the associated value generates
    \"Good moisture content,\" and the water pump switches to \"OFF\" (if it was \"ON\"),
    and if it is above 60%, the associated value generates \"High moisture content,\"
    and the water pump C. Algorithm For pH value The pH of the soil, which also affects
    crop productivity, is another important factor to consider. We develop an algorithm
    to analyse the pH, with the outputs being the \"normal pH value\" for pH values
    between 6 and 7.5, \"basic soil\" for pH values over 7.5, and \"acidic soil\"
    for pH values below 6. D. Water Analysis Water is an essential component of the
    agricultural system. The output of crops is also influenced by the amount of water
    in a certain location because water is a rich source of nutrients. The impact
    that an agricultural field''s mixture of soil and water has is more precisely
    measured for more precise farming. We should also check the water content. You
    should apply a high-quality, water-soluble fertiliser each time you replenish
    the water in the container, which is typically every four to six weeks or sooner
    if half of the water has gone. Use a weak solution that''s only one-fourth as
    powerful as what the fertiliser bottle recommends. We should analyse our water
    before creating the conditions for hydroponic plants. Water frequently has high
    levels of calcium, magnesium, sodium, and chloride, and it also occasionally contains
    high levels of boron and manganese. E. NPK values NPK fertiliser is a mixture
    of minerals that primarily contains the three components needed for healthy plant
    growth. The three nutrients nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, or NPK, are essential
    for all plant development. The majority of the NPK fertiliser, a mixture of mineral
    elements, contains the three primary nutrients required for healthy plant development.
    The three nutrients known as NPK—nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium—are essential
    for plant growth. The growth and development of roots and flowers are encouraged
    by phosphorus [10]. Potassium (Potash) is essential for a plant''s overall health.
    Be aware that while using high nitrogen fertilisers may cause plants to develop
    quickly, they may also become weaker and more susceptible to disease and pest
    infestation. Your plants'' rapid and dramatic development isn''t always desired.
    SECTION IV. Experimental Setup And Data Collection A. Crop Analysis of Samples
    In order to determine the NPK values of the crops, we took a small number of samples.
    Based on the results, we tried to modify the soil to be suitable for the crop
    [11] we chose by testing the values of the soil we received and comparing them
    to the necessary standard values for the particular crops. Here, we''ve looked
    at the NPK specifications for cucumber, tomato, rose, radish, and sweet pepper.
    Next, we extracted two soil samples to measure their NPK levels. The outcomes
    are as follows: TABLE I Soil Analysis TABLE II Ratios of fertilizers that are
    advised based on the historical philosophy (the percentages are based on nitrogen)
    B. Agriculture Sensor Layer This layer consists of IoT-enabled devices with GPS,
    such as sensor nodes, cellphones, etc., for making various sorts of maps. IoTs
    for smart agriculture, such as IoTs for outdoor farming, IoTs for greenhouses
    [12], IoTs for photovoltaic farms, IoTs for solar insecticidal lamps, and others.
    In order to achieve these two objectives, IoT devices are being integrated and
    modified at various levels of agriculture. The primary objective is to guarantee
    the nutrition solution''s distribution and manufacturing reliability. The second
    objective is to improve consumption control [13], which keeps costs down and minimises
    solution losses. Along with the economic effects, the environmental effects will
    be greatly diminished. The farmer in green IoT-based agriculture uses a digital
    control system (e.g., Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA)) for process
    control to meet agriculture control requirements. In order to comply with the
    demands of agricultural control, the farmer in green IoT-based agriculture needs
    a digital control system (such as Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA)).
    We suggest the sensor and metre nodes for each piece of equipment in a greenhouse
    to integrate IoTs as follows: IoT devices for the water pumping system take into
    account the dripper flow rates, the projected pressures, and the areas that will
    be watered. Water metres that provide real-time updates for water storage. IoT
    devices are customised for each filtering device (such as a sand filter) that
    takes drippers and the physical characteristics of water into account [14]. Injectors
    of fertilisers (such NPK fertilisers) and fertiliser metres for storage that can
    give real-time updates. Small solar panels with IoT sensors for controlling temperature
    and moisture levels. IoT devices for controlling pH and electrical conductivity
    to achieve the appropriate value for nutrition solution. SECTION V. Results and
    Discussion The DHT 11 sensor is in charge of measuring soil temperature in order
    to control the ideal soil temperature for compatible crops. To control the amount
    of water in the soil and that which is necessary for the crops, the soil moisture
    sensor is used to measure the moisture content of the soil. Crops require the
    largest quantities of the nutrients nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. As a
    result, they are frequently regarded as the most important nutrients. Therefore,
    we utilise the NPK sensor for N, P, and K analysis, and in accordance with that,
    we can estimate the crops that are acceptable for the soil by computing the data
    of NPK value necessary for certain crops. This would also simplify the agricultural
    process because we can adjust NPK according to the crops that are needed. We employ
    an organic light-emitting diodes (OLED) screen to display the content analysis
    of the soil since all of these analyses must be shown on a screen in order to
    provide the outcome to the user. We control Wi-Fi connectivity for network connectivity
    using the ESP module [15]. It will be used to control data transfer across the
    server. A. Advantages of the proposed system Vs other systems TABLE III Advantages

    circuit along with the sensors. Show All C. Experimental Circuit for the Proposed
    Study Fig. 2. Experimental circuit on the emulator to represent the working of
    the proposed system Show All SECTION VI. Conclusion and Future Scope This strategy
    is suitable for crop production since it will provide the soil with the proper
    crop based on a number of factors, including soil moisture content, KMP value,
    optimal irrigation, and in-field crop monitoring in real-time. The development
    of a system to automate irrigation and monitor the agricultural area using sensors
    (light, humidity, temperature, soil moisture, etc.) is known as IoT-based smart
    farming. Farmers have the ability to remotely check on their farms. Smart farming
    powered by IoT is significantly more productive than traditional farming. In addition
    to conventional and large farming operations, IoT-based smart farming applications
    may provide novel approaches to other emerging or established agricultural trends,
    such as organic farming, family farming (complex or intimate settings, specific
    cattle and/or cultures, preservation of specific or high-quality varieties, etc.),
    and the improvement of highly transparent farming. Authors Figures References

    The global food system is currently under pressure due to rising population, economic
    growth, land degradation, and increased demand for animal-based products (Keating
    et al., 2014; Lal, 2013). For example, global food production needs to be increased
    by about 70% to ensure food security for an estimated world population of more
    than 9.7 billion people in 2050 (Cole et al., 2018; FAO, 2017). Further, climate
    change is projected to affect global food production and efforts to increase food
    productivity. Notably, crop production across the globe has already experienced
    negative effects from warming temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns,
    and increased extreme weather events (IPCC, 2022; Paudel et al., 2014). This will
    likely be exacerbated by climate change in the future (Hasegawa et al., 2021;
    Lobell et al., 2008; Rosenzweig & Parry, 1994). As such, researchers, scientists,
    policymakers, and organizations like the Food and Agriculture Organization of
    the United Nations (FAO) call for a radical transformation in global agricultural
    and food systems. Therefore, improved technologies that aim at enhancing production
    and supply-chain efficiencies under a resource-constrained environment are crucial
    to ensuring food security in the face of climate change (FAO, 2017). One such
    technology is the Internet of Things (IoT), which has recently shown the potential
    to provide solutions to several challenges associated with increased agricultural
    productivity under climatic changes and variability (Figure 1). FIGURE 1 Open
    in figure viewer Uses of the Internet of Things (IoT) in agriculture (Source:
    Salam, 2022, used with permission). Although there is no single definition of
    IoT, it could be broadly described as a system of devices, software programs,
    sensors, and other technologies that are either connected or are able to become
    connected via the Internet to exchange information and data (Borgia, 2014). The
    first application of IoT is believed to be an information-sharing network used
    by US defense sectors in 1969, then called the Advanced Research Projects Agency
    Network. The chronological timeline detailing the evolution process of various
    technologies within IoT since 1969 is summarized in Table 1 (Balas et al., 2019).
    In recent years, there has been an exponential increase in the number of common
    devices that might be considered to be a part of the IoT framework, including
    cell phones, televisions, thermostats, vehicles, refrigerators, home lighting
    systems, and smart watches among many others. Such IoT infrastructure is projected
    to substantially impact the global economy, with more than 100 billion connections
    (Huawei Technologies Co., 2015) and a financial impact of more than $11 trillion
    by 2025 (Manyika et al., 2015). Their impact is largely apparent in the agricultural
    sector, which currently contributes up to 60% of the national gross domestic product
    in many countries (The World Bank, 2019). TABLE 1. Chronological evolution of
    the technologies in Internet of Things (IoT) domain. Year Evolution Reference

    and controlling distant objects such as water levels in tanks in crop fields Rajalakshmi
    and Mahalakshmi (2016) The use of IoT in agriculture emerged due to advancements
    in data science, remote sensing, and computer technologies, and the need for optimizing
    decisions regarding agricultural management practices (King, 2017). Specifically,
    IoT use in precision and smart agriculture is notable with applications in data-informed,
    site-specific, and real-time management and decision-making. International Society
    of Precision Agriculture defines precision agriculture as “a management strategy
    that gathers, processes and analyzes temporal, spatial and individual data and
    combines it with other information to support management decisions according to
    estimated variability for improved resource use efficiency, productivity, quality,
    profitability and sustainability of agricultural production.” Smart agriculture
    refers to farming using softwares, sensors, automation, and data technologies.
    Digital agriculture seeks to utilize data from precision farming and the power
    of Artificial Intelligence. Digital agricultural technologies and the use of IoT
    are illustrated in Figure 1. Development of pilot research farms is already underway
    in several countries to determine the feasibility of IoT-informed decision-making
    for improving the efficiency and sustainability of agricultural production. Some
    examples include the Accelerating Precision Agriculture to Decision Agriculture
    (P2D) project in Australia (Zhang et al., 2017) and SmartAgriHubs (Chatzikostas
    et al., 2019) and SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos et al., 2012) in Europe. Yet, the adaptation
    of IoT technology in the agricultural sector is still in its infancy (Villa-Henriksen
    et al., 2020). IoT enables us to gather information from enclosed proximity to
    the physical location using fog computing, edge computing, communication protocols,
    and sensor technologies. They show potential in improving decision-making and
    productivity in various stages of agricultural production. Examples include the
    use of wireless in-field sensors in improving the measurement of soil moisture
    and permittivity (Salam, 2020; Bogena et al., 2010), autonomous precision irrigation
    systems (Dong et al., 2013), and identification and tracking of livestock animals
    (Trotter et al., 2010). Satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and new remote
    sensing approaches (e.g., PlanetLab) are increasingly used in IoT. For example,
    UAVs have been used for plant height estimation (Anthony et al., 2014; Herwitz
    et al., 2004), biomass estimation (Sinha et al., 2015), crop yield prediction
    (Ashapure et al., 2020; Panday et al., 2020), detection of weeds (De Castro et
    al., 2017), soil nitrogen management (Ballester et al., 2017), crop disease detection
    (Sugiura et al., 2016), and estimation of the leaf area index (LAI) (Hunt et al.,
    2008). Despite the growing interest of the agricultural research community in
    integrating IoT-enabled devices into production, to date, such technologies are
    not widely adopted by producers due to concerns associated with cost and return
    on investment (Narwane et al., 2022; Pillai & Sivathanu, 2020). More specifically,
    there is a need to understand the benefits and utilities of IoT from different
    perspectives (users, developers, and researchers) to fully utilize its potential
    to improve crop production under limited resources and climate change. Therefore,
    in this paper, we review existing literature and discuss the concepts, applications,
    potential challenges, and opportunities associated with IoT with a specific focus
    on its application in digital agriculture. First, we provide the concepts and
    technical details of different components of IoT, followed by its applications
    in digital agriculture, and associated challenges and opportunities. Overall,
    this review is expected to provide useful insights into how IoT could be integrated
    into the smart agriculture framework for improving crop productivity and food
    security in the face of climatic change and variability. Core Ideas Different
    platforms, sensors, and structures of IoT in digital agriculture were reviewed.
    The application of IoT in data management, interoperability, and precision farming
    was reviewed. Potential of IoT to improve agricultural quality and productivity
    was highlighted. Challenges and opportunities of IoT in digital agriculture were
    discussed. 2 COMPONENTS OF THE IOT The key components of the IoT include IoT platforms,
    wireless sensor networks (WSNs), and the IoT structure. An IoT platform can be
    defined as an on-premises software suite or a cloud service (IoT platform as a
    service [PaaS]) that monitors and may manage and control different kinds of endpoints,
    generally through apps installed on the platform. Similarly, WSN refers to an
    infrastructure-less wireless network that is installed ad hoc in a large number
    of wireless sensors to monitor system, physical, or environmental factors. The
    structure of IoT largely consists of devices, network structure, and cloud technology
    that allow IoT devices to communicate with each other. These components are discussed
    separately below. 2.1 IoT platforms IoT platforms provide proprietary or open-source
    suite for controlling devices and data in IoT system. Various IoT platforms, both
    proprietary and open source, are currently available to handle data from diverse
    sources using different devices. They serve functions like ingestion, filtering,
    aggregation, storing, and computation of data (Jayaraman et al., 2016). These
    platforms support specific microcontrollers, transceivers, data and extension
    memory, and programming. Some select platforms in agriculture are available from
    Tzounis et al. (2017) and are discussed in detail as follows. 2.1.1 FarmBot FarmBot
    is an open-source precision agricultural project platform that consists of a farming
    machine, software, and a repository for farming data. The three main components
    of FarmBot include mechanisms for seed planting, a nutrient delivery system, and
    a universal tool mounting system. FarmBot is generally used in urban farming for
    monitoring plant growth parameters and predicting a suitable harvest date at a
    future point in time (Nugraha et al., 2020). FarmBot can plant seeds with a regular
    watering schedule and can be remotely accessed with ease from Internet-connected
    devices (Murdyantoro et al., 2019). It takes the location of each plant into account
    to facilitate essential nutrients and water application for optimal plant growth
    based on feedback from the online database of records from various agricultural
    fields. The main purpose of FarmBot technology is to optimize the quality and
    quantity of agricultural produce and to enhance resource efficiency. Arduino,
    an open-source hardware and software company, which manufactures microcontrollers,
    is used to control the FarmBot and is connected to the Internet using a Raspberry
    Pi 3 board. A decision support system (DSS) has been implemented to help in data-driven
    design, access to the open repository, and real-time control of the parameters.
    An Android application can be designed to monitor the stepper motor location to
    carry out different farm operations, plant seeds using the vacuum pump in the
    field, and capture images. 2.1.2 Raspberry Pi Raspberry Pi is a small, low-cost
    computer chip capable of being used with a computer monitor, mouse, and keyboard.
    The basic structure of a Raspberry Pi includes random access memory (RAM), a processor,
    USB ports, general purpose input/output pins, an Ethernet port, a full HDMI port,
    a camera interface, a display interface, and a micro SD card slot (Balamurugan
    et al., 2017). The Raspberry Pi has been used in a wide variety of applications
    in agricultural systems. The growing availability of Raspberry Pi with high processing
    capacity has enabled many remote sensing tasks in agriculture, including crop
    imaging, determination of soil fertility, crop yield estimation, and spraying
    of fertilizers (Mathe et al., 2022). Flores et al. (2016) utilized a Raspberry
    Pi as a local server to display the relative humidity, air temperature, soil moisture,
    soil electrical conductivity, and soil pH through the use of a graphical user
    interface. Kamath et al. (2019) used a Raspberry Pi to monitor weeds in paddy
    crops and Bluetooth 4.0 to send data to remote base station using visual sensor
    nodes. These sensor readings were then processed using machine learning models
    (e.g., support vector machines and random forests) to distinguish weeds from paddy
    crops using shape features. 2.1.3 IRIS Mote An IRIS Mote (Crossbow) is a computing
    system consisting of a microcomputer plus one or more sensors that are connected
    wirelessly via a radio link. The IRIS Mote has one of the highest communication
    ranges (close to 500 m) using a 2.4 GHz IEEE 802.15.4 wireless module. It also
    includes an Intel XScale processor, 8 KB of RAM, 512 KB of flash memory, and a
    transmission rate of 250 kbps. The expansion connector has eight channel analog
    inputs. The IRIS Mote handles task scheduling and input/output processing (Liu
    et al., 2015) using an open-source TinyOS operating system based on an ATMega1281
    low-power microcontroller (Sivagami et al., 2010). The transmission current of
    IRIS Mote is 10–17 mA, whereas the receiver current is 16 mA. The indoor communication
    range of the device is greater than 300 m, and the outdoor communication range
    is greater than 50 m (Narayanan et al., 2016). The underground communication range
    is reduced to less than 30 m due to interference in radio frequency communication.
    The IRIS Mote is used in small agricultural fields to monitor climatic and hydrologic
    parameters like rain, sunlight, humidity, and temperature of a system. 2.1.4 Zolertia
    The Zolertia Z1 Mote (Zolertia S.L., Barcelona, Spain) is a platform designed
    for WSNs. It is compatible with TinyOS, OpenWSN, and RIOT OS. It supports analog
    and digital sensors and includes an MSP432 microcontroller, 8 KB of RAM, and 92
    KB of flash memory. It can operate in the temperature range of −25 to −85°C. It
    is designed to work in the range of 0.3–3.6 V, powered by two 1.5 V AA standard
    batteries (Zolertia, 2010). Agricultural use of Zolertia has previously been reported
    in greenhouse-based tomato farming, where the attenuation of radio waves in the
    2.4 GHz freeband was measured using a received signal strength indicator (Cama-Pinto
    et al., 2021). Zolertia Z1 Mote has also been used in determining agro-climatic
    variables like temperature and soil moisture in cassava (Manihot spp.) production
    (Caicedo-Ortiz et al., 2018). 2.1.5 Node MicroController Unit Node MicroController
    Unit (NodeMCU) is an open-source IoT platform with an ESP8266 microcontroller
    and Wi-Fi system on chip (SoC) from Expressif Systems, and hardware, which runs
    on an ESP-12 module. This firmware runs on Lua scripting language (Vanaja et al.,
    2018). It functions the same way as a Raspberry Pi in the case of agricultural
    applications and may be connected to various sensors for real-time monitoring
    of soil moisture, relative humidity, and air temperature. In one study, NodeMCU
    was used to monitor the environmental conditions of indoor greenhouses (Wan et
    al., 2019). A cloud-based platform has been used to store the environmental sensor
    readings and has been used for automatic irrigation systems for controlling agriculture
    pumps and remote monitoring systems resulting in increased economic benefits (Bentabet,
    2020). 2.1.6 Intel Galileo/Edison The Intel Galileo (Intel) board is based on
    Intel architecture (Intel Quark SoC X1000, 400 MHz processor) and is designed
    to have powerful functionalities with minimum power consumption. This allows users
    to apply shields compatible with Intel Galileo and extend the functionality of
    the board. It comprises two levels—legacy controlled blocks and microbuses. The
    legacy-controlled blocks are used for specific functions using dedicated channels.
    It has a dedicated point-to-point connection to connect to standard modules like
    Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and SIM card modules for cell phones. The issues of these boards
    within agriculture are similar to that of the Raspberry Pi (Silpa et al., 2018).
    These boards are used in a house environment monitoring system, which helps in
    producing high-quality crops with minimal labor costs (Ajith et al., 2020). Some
    other applications are observed in the monitoring of soil pH and nutrients of
    cultivated crops (Sakthisudhan et al., 2019). 2.2 Wireless sensor network WSN
    is an important component of IoT, and its use in the agricultural sector has been
    widely discussed (Mahbub, 2020; Sanjeevi et al., 2020). A WSN is a wireless network
    consisting of spatially distributed sensors and sensor nodes to monitor physical
    or environmental conditions and transfer data to a base station. These systems
    are often inexpensive, scalable, and consist of mobile nodes (Kiani & Seyyedabbasi,
    2018). Briefly, the WSN system consists of two major components, sensor nodes
    and sink nodes (base station) (Kocakulak & Butun, 2017). The sensor node consists
    of a power unit, a sensing unit, and a computing unit. These nodes may be placed
    inside or outside an agricultural field to continuously feed data to the base
    station. Depending on the ad hoc system configuration or network type, the sensor
    node could behave as a data originator or router. Sensor nodes can collect real-time
    physical or environmental conditions such as temperature, vibration, or motion
    time and produce sensory data (Pottie, 1998; Senouci & Mellouk, 2016). At the
    same time, the sink node collects sensor data and communicates with the end user
    via a direct connection. This connection between the sensor and sink nodes is
    established via the Internet, satellite, or any wireless link, and the data is
    accessed through an app or end-user interface. 2.3 IoT structure IoT structure
    is a system that helps in connecting objects to the Internet through information-sensing
    equipment to establish data exchange and communication and to monitor and manage
    digital systems (Ye et al., 2014). To achieve such functions, IoT uses the perception,
    network, and application layers, as well as the security strategy for each layer,
    as a part of its framework (Gou et al., 2013). The IoT structural hierarchy is
    shown in Figure 2 (Zhong et al., 2015), but more generalized structural components
    are discussed in sub-sections below. Different layers within the hierarchy are
    crucial to address issues like computational loss, poor access control, data leaks,
    malware risks, and cyberattacks (apriorit.com/dev-blog). FIGURE 2 Open in figure
    viewer Hierarchy of the Internet of Things (IoT) structure. 2.3.1 The perception
    layer The perception layer is the foundation of IoT and is the interface between
    the physical world and the digital world. This layer functions as “nerve endings”
    collecting measured signals and transporting those signals to the rest of the
    system (Yang et al., 2012). It uses radio frequency identification technology,
    barcode technology, sensor, and positioning technology to complete information
    collection and helps in controlling the perception by the actuators. The main
    security issues in a perception layer are related to information collection and
    transmission as most sensors have a simple structure and processor and do not
    have complex security protection capabilities (Zhao & Ge, 2013). 2.3.2 The network
    layer The network layer is generally composed of two layers—the network access
    layer and the network transmission layer. The access layer consists of a base
    station node and a gateway. Current methods of network access are Wi-Fi, Ad Hoc,
    Mesh, and Zigbee. The network transmission layer is responsible for the transmission
    and exchange of information, including satellite, mobile, and optical fiber communication
    networks. It is analogous to a person''s nervous system and brain, which are used
    to transmit and cope with the information from the perception layer. The most
    common security issues in a network layer occur when a number of malicious nodes
    send data at the same time, which may lead to a denial of service attack (Bello
    et al., 2017). 2.3.3 The application layer The application layer is generally
    composed of two layers—the application support layer and the application presentation
    layer. The support layer is responsible for data storage, information processing,
    and the exchange of information. The presentation layer is used for processing
    data from the application support layer. It uses technology with multimedia, virtual
    reality, and human–computer interfaces to connect the IoT and the user. The main
    security issues concerning the application layer may include data access permission,
    identity authentication, data protection and recovery, big data handling, and
    software vulnerabilities, among others (Karagiannis et al., 2015). 3 APPLICATIONS
    OF IOT IN DIGITAL AGRICULTURE Digital agriculture is directly linked with IoT.
    Indeed, IoT offers multiple applications in the production, circulation, and modernization
    of farming businesses (Chen & Jin, 2012; Ozdogan et al., 2017). The term “digital
    agriculture” refers to the on-farm and off-farm uses and applications of data
    based on location, weather, energy use, or other factor using sensors, machines,
    or satellites to monitor animals, plants, or soil (Klerkx et al., 2019). It integrates
    concepts from precision and smart farming. The basic framework (Tang et al., 2002)
    of digital agriculture includes: Agricultural databases that include information
    about farmlands, climatic conditions, and socioeconomic background that relates
    agricultural activities to the human society. Real-time monitoring and updating
    of information in the database about meteorology, vegetation, and soil information
    on and under the ground using in situ and satellite-based sensors. A network transmission
    and processing system to analyze collected information, make decisions, and transfer
    signals in controlling the functions of agricultural machinery. The actuation
    framework that includes digitized sowing and harvesting devices enabled with Geographic
    Information System and Global Position Satellite systems. Different crop, soil,
    and weather sensors are increasingly used in monitoring plant growth, diseases,
    pests, yield, weather variables (temperature, humidity, rain, air, etc.), and
    soil physical–chemical and hydraulic properties (Acharya et al., 2017; Sehgal
    et al., 2005). Sensors are used in real-time monitoring and reporting of agricultural
    parameters in the value chain, cloud computing, and integration of these processes
    with advanced technologies like UAVs and satellites to enable highly efficient,
    qualitative, profitable, and environmentally sound agricultural decision-making.
    Sensor-based data is also utilized in formulating predictive models to forecast
    crop yield (Supit et al., 2012). Some applications of IoT systems in digital agriculture
    are discussed as follows. 3.1 UAVs in digital agriculture Traditionally, satellites
    have been used to detect spectral responses from plants and soil (Dematte et al.,
    2018). However, satellite data is often of coarse resolution that is not applicable
    for canopy and plot scale applications and is not available regularly due to cloud
    cover and sensor property. UAVs provide a noninvasive and cost-effective approach
    to collect data at a much finer scale at the desired time scale. UAVs are defined
    as “a set of configurable elements consisting of a remotely piloted aircraft,
    its associated remote pilot station(s), the required command and control links,
    and any other system elements as may be required, at any point during flight operation”
    (International Civil Aviation Organization, ICAO). UAV-derived images can be processed
    to monitor and predict plant growth parameters, disease and pest incidence, yield,
    and different soil physical and hydraulic properties. Nowadays, smart technologies
    have been built into UAVs by integrating open-source technology, autonomous programs,
    smart sensors, and payloads (Puri et al., 2017). Different hyperspectral, multispectral,
    and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors can be mounted to the UAVs for
    near real-time monitoring of vegetation conditions, extraction of soil and vegetation
    indices (Ni et al., 2018), and predicting LAI. For example, multispectral sensors
    are increasingly used to calculate the normalized difference vegetation index,
    normalized difference red-edge index, leaf water content index, soil-adjusted
    vegetation index, enhanced vegetation index, tile drainage, and plant water status
    by capturing the reflectance including those in visible, near-infrared, and shortwave
    regions of the electromagnetic radiation (Tables 2 and 3). TABLE 2. Different
    sensors used in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and their advantages and disadvantages
    (Modified from Acharya et al., 2021). Sensors Advantages Disadvantages Red/green/blue
    (RGB) Portable, common, relatively inexpensive, provide high-quality RGB images
    for ortho-imagery and digital surface model, easy to integrate with different
    platforms Wider bandwidth and lower spectral resolution lack geometric and radiometric
    calibration Multispectral Multiple wavelengths allow geometric reconstruction
    and radiometric calibration Relatively costly, image processing relatively complex
    compared to RGB, radiometric, and atmospheric corrections may be required, limited
    compatibility to UAVs Hyperspectral High spectral resolution data across various
    wavelengths of the visible and near infrared spectrum Higher cost than multispectral,
    low signal-to-noise ratio, limited compatibility with standard UAVs and flight
    control software packages, radiometric and atmospheric corrections may be required
    Microwave High spatial resolution, useful under low visibility weather conditions
    (e.g., cloud cover) Sensitive to surface roughness Thermal Sense a wide range
    of temperatures, relatively cheaper Thermally sensitive, vignetting effects, low
    spatial resolution, radiometric corrections required, sensitive to change in surface
    roughness LiDAR Generates dense cloud points, high-quality data, direct geometric
    measurements Higher cost, limited compatibility with UAVs, requires ground filtering
    corrections TABLE 3. Selected vegetative indices and their application in agriculture

    near-infrared; R, red. There are several types of UAV systems used for agricultural
    applications (Table 4; Acharya et al., 2021). Two widely used UAVs include fixed-wing
    and rotary-wing UAVs (Dileep et al., 2020). Fixed-wing UAVs use airplane-like
    wings to generate lift and to move forward. Some of their properties include lower
    cost, higher endurance, and greater flight speed as compared to rotary-wing UAVs.
    Contrastingly, rotary-wing UAVs use rotor blades and are characterized by vertical
    takeoff and landing capacity, lower flight altitude, and lower flight speed. UAVs
    may be used for mid-season crop health monitoring of vegetative indices using
    near-infrared and other regions of the electromagnetic spectrum that cannot be
    sensed by the human eye (Table 3; Cancela et al., 2019; Ren et al., 2020; Veroustraete,
    2015). Pathak et al. (2020) reported the use of UAVs in spraying herbicides on
    up to 20–40 ha per day and to further eradicate farmers’ direct contact with poisonous
    chemicals and hazardous operational conditions. UAVs can be used to generate variable-rate
    application maps from the images to determine the strength of nutrient uptake
    in a single field. This has the potential to further minimize fertilizer costs
    and optimize crop yield (Kulbacki et al., 2018). UAV-based LiDAR systems and software
    have shown potential in stitching together thousands of high-quality aerial photographs
    to develop 3D maps for monitoring soil erosion and developing conservation strategies
    (Acharya et al., 2021). More recently, new types of aerial imagery and satellite
    (e.g., PlanetLab) have shown tremendous potential in monitoring crops, making
    informed decisions, and increasing yield (Cai et al., 2019). TABLE 4. Applications

    from Puri et al., 2017). Agricultural UAVs Usage Honeycomb AgDrone system, Wilsonville,

    aerial imaging and field and crop monitoring 3.2 Cloud-based information communication
    technology (ICT) systems The main purpose of cloud-based information communication
    technology (ICT) systems is to provide tools to software developers to develop
    a variety of cloud-based services to monitor plant growth parameters and predict
    crop yield (Kaloxylos et al., 2012). This infrastructure consists of data collection,
    statistical analysis, and the creation of commands to control farming equipment.
    In a practical setup, data is generally transferred from a local farm management
    system to the cloud repository associated with the monitoring service in order
    to keep track of the farm activities. The data is subsequently analyzed by an
    expert online system such as an e-agriculturist, and outputs are made directly
    available to the farmers. An ICT system has three major components (Patil et al.,
    2012). The first is an information collection layer, which consists of a sensor-based
    climatic and agricultural dataset. Data may include but is not limited to air
    temperature, relative humidity, air pressure, atmospheric gas concentrations;
    names, models, and prices of agricultural products; operating status of agricultural
    equipment, and locations of agricultural products. The second layer is the transport
    or network layer, which is responsible for transmitting and processing data received
    from the sensor layer above. Finally, the application layer analyzes and processes
    information to cultivate digital awareness. One of the leading examples of a cloud-based
    ICT system is GeoFarmer (Eitzinger et al., 2019). GeoFarmer consists of a modular
    design, which is interoperable through an application programming interface. It
    follows open access standards regarding existing tools and technologies and the
    system is designed and developed in accordance with user needs. Further, the entire
    process and lessons learned in the development process are documented. Similar
    software architecture has been defined in FIWARE, an open-source platform for
    a smart digital future, which focuses on agricultural sensors with reprogrammable
    firmware and a set of interfaces already embedded in the General Packet Radio
    Service board. Cloud-based systems have been applied to monitor pesticide use
    and safety in vegetable crops (Qian et al., 2018). Interfaces of such systems
    consist of guidelines for pesticide purchasing and application, optimal harvest
    time estimation, and a feedback system formulation to monitor the health of vegetables.
    A mobile-based cloud architecture was implemented through AgroMobile (Prasad et
    al., 2013), which enhances smart agricultural practices with the help of image
    processing techniques, image visualization, and cloud-based data processing. A
    similar precision agriculture technique using cloud computing has been proposed
    in enhancing the capacity for special education leadership for aggregate farming
    in the cloud (Castillejo et al., 2020) to increase efficiency and productivity
    and reduce labor costs. Other applications include quality control in greenhouse
    production, and monitoring soil moisture levels, humidity, and temperature in
    agricultural plots. 3.3 Big data in agriculture Big data refers to datasets that
    are too large to be analyzed by traditional data processing software and applications.
    The integration of big data technologies and best farming practices has the potential
    to facilitate improved crop production, plant protection, postharvest analysis,
    and environmental conservation. The major applications of big data in different
    topologies of digital agriculture are available from Sarker et al. (2019) and
    are briefly discussed here. The first application of big data is in precision
    agriculture. Thus, data collected using sensor-enabled hardware and software tools
    is used for assessing, controlling, and improving crop management, crop performance,
    and environmental quality. The second application is prescription agriculture,
    where big data is used to prescribe agronomic practices for optimizing yield.
    The third application is in enterprise agriculture, which includes the agribusiness
    platform and links field data to inventory, logistics, machinery, and profit.
    Finally, the fourth application is in automated agriculture, where farm data and
    environmental data are used to automate agriculture through robotic technologies.
    The data lifecycle in agriculture consists of data generation, warehousing, cleaning,
    annotation, and processing to optimize or improve agricultural production while
    maintaining the quality of the environment (Chaterji et al., 2020). In the following
    section, we briefly describe each of these steps. Data generation may involve
    the use of site-specific or public data. Site-specific datasets, such as soil
    nutrient composition and fertilizer usage, are generally privately held. Examples
    of public data may include topographic or soil textural information of a location.
    Data warehousing allows the data to be integrated from multiple sources and then
    restructured for improved performance. Data annotation is a data labeling technique
    that translates an encoded value to raw data. Because classical WSNs have limitations
    in interpreting and understanding the context of raw sensor data, annotation is
    highly recommended for end-user applications (Khan et al., 2015). On the other
    hand, getting rid of the corrupt or inaccurate values from the tables is a very
    important step in processing and helps to eradicate outliers from the dataset.
    Finally, processing imagery data results in more useful formats, which is largely
    accomplished by using a variety of analysis techniques such as Artificial Intelligence.
    Despite the considerable importance of big data in modernizing agriculture, a
    dearth of publicly available, high-quality datasets remains a formidable challenge
    to farming using alternate techniques. A combination of machine learning and IoT
    may be crucial in filling those gaps and in designing interactive wireless sensor–actuator
    networks for the commercial application of alternative farming systems (e.g.,
    Aquaponics) (Dhal et al., 2022a, 2022b; Dhal, Jungbluth, et al., 2022). 3.4 Digital
    twins in agriculture Digital twins generally refer to a digital replica of real-world
    entities mirroring their behavior and states over the entire lifetime in a virtual
    world. It is generally a standardization of real-world variables and can be used
    irrespective of place, time, and human observation (Botín-Sanabria et al., 2022).
    A digital twin in agriculture has been described as a multi-physical, multi-scale,
    and probabilistic simulation model of complex production. It uses a combination
    of in situ sensors and physical models to mirror physical life. Information from
    sensors and satellite data is taken as input to design digital twins (Verdouw
    et al., 2021) and is utilized in reproducing historical statistics and predicting
    future values. The process involves data integration, Artificial Intelligence,
    and machine learning. Digital twins show potential for aiding in planning and
    managing soil operations, irrigation, robotics, and farm machineries (Nasirahmadi
    & Hensel, 2022). WSNs in farmlands and cloud servers that run machine learning
    algorithms can detect plant diseases, weed clusters, and nutrient deficiencies
    (Angin et al., 2020). Indeed, significant progress has been made in using digital
    twins in the field of arable farming, dairy farming, greenhouse horticulture,
    and livestock rearing (Howard et al., 2020; Verdouw et al., 2017). For example,
    digital twins have been designed to monitor the health of cows (Bos taurus) and
    pigs (Sus domesticus), model firmness and loss of vitamin content in mango (Mangifera
    indica), identify diseases and pests in olives (Olea europaea) and other crops,
    assist in fleet management and tracking machinery, and identify pesticide exposure
    in bees (Apis mellifera) (Pylianidis et al., 2021). These applications of the
    digital twins within the agricultural sector have been observed in seven major
    fields: real-time monitoring of data, energy consumption analysis, system failure
    analysis and prediction, optimization of resources, behavioral analysis, technological
    integration, and virtual maintenance (Angin et al., 2020). More recently, the
    concept of digital twins has been applied in postharvest management by categorizing
    simulations into three stages: input, throughput, and output (Dyck et al., 2022).
    This enables monitoring of moisture and temperature of grain to ensure safe storage
    and movement within the elevator. Further, a sensor network could be used in storage
    to ensure the optimal quality of grains. 4 ADVANTAGES OF USING IOT IN AGRICULTURE
    The demand for agricultural products will increase as the global population grows
    and as climate change occurs (Bradshaw & Brook, 2014). IoT shows the potential
    to lower the impact of these challenges while meeting this demand for agricultural
    products. Indeed, IoT offers a potential solution to increase agricultural efficiency
    and productivity while saving time, labor, and money. Because of the cost and
    time effectiveness of IoT systems, the use and installation of IoT devices in
    the agricultural industry are increasing by nearly 20% annually and are expected
    to reach 225 million devices by 2024 (Elijah et al., 2018). In addition, the expansion
    of cellular service and 5G connectivity introduced by satellite and cellular network
    companies in rural areas have boosted the use of IoT in recent years (Di et al.,
    2019; Chen et al., 2022). The advancement of IoT connectivity to personal and
    portable electronic items, such as cell phones, iPads, and tablets, along with
    the introduction of advanced WSNs and machine learning facilitates real-time data
    retrieval, processing, and decision-making. The advantages of IoT in agriculture
    include interoperability, wide advantages of WSN, and data management using cloud
    and fog computing. In the following section, we discuss these advantages in detail.
    4.1 Interoperability The data collected through WSNs and sensor nodes is made
    available using apps, equipment, and products to communicate and process them
    in a way that does not require any involvement from end users, which is called
    interoperability (Tzounis et al., 2017). In other words, interoperability is the
    data communication approach that allows using different information systems to
    transfer and comprehend information. The interoperability process consists of
    two methods. The first method makes the data available through a local area network
    or a wide area network. The second method shares the data via software or hardware
    between different systems and machines. In the utilization of IoT, interoperability
    plays a vital role in facilitating and exchanging effectively organized data between
    information systems. Interoperability provides multiple benefits, such as system
    adaptability, better productivity, data unity, improved data protection, fewer
    errors, and lower data acquisition costs. The interoperability functionality includes
    three approaches, which include syntactical, structural, and semantical approaches
    (Aydin & Aydin, 2020). Syntactic interoperability allows the use of two or more
    systems simultaneously to communicate and share data even if the interface or
    language is not the same. Structural interoperability defines the standard data
    exchange format from one system to another to understand the information clearly.
    Moreover, semantic interoperability allows connecting two or more systems and
    sharing data between them in a meaningful way. 4.2 Smart irrigation and decision
    support The use of sensors and communication technologies, microcontrollers, and
    actuators has the potential to improve water use efficiency, reduce the cost of
    irrigation, and increase crop productivity (Abbasi et al., 2019). For example,
    UAVs are increasingly used in monitoring plant water use efficiency, which provides
    a base to select plant varieties for breeding and crop improvement, particularly
    in water-limited systems. Soil moisture sensors using capacitance or frequency
    domain technology are able to continuously monitor soil moisture in determining
    irrigation rate and time. Farmers may use mobile phones or wireless personal digital
    assistants to remotely control data loggers and monitor and analyze moisture for
    irrigation scheduling and automation. The applications of different machine learning
    algorithms in developing irrigation support systems are shown in Table 5. The
    irrigation DSS allows a weekly schedule to meet the irrigation water needs of
    a plantation based on inputs to a data-driven model. Some automated and smart
    irrigation systems using WSN, the Internet, cloud computing, and optimization
    tools are discussed in Krishnan et al. (2020) and Ramachandran et al. (2018),
    among others. TABLE 5. Application of machine learning techniques as decision

    Output variable: Irrigation schedules Machine learning model: Linear regression,
    random forest regression and support vector regression Torres-Sanchez et al. (2020)
    4.3 Smart greenhouse One application of WSNs includes the conversion of a traditional
    greenhouse into a “smart greenhouse” (Kodali et al., 2016). The sensors automatically
    adjust the greenhouse climatic conditions, such as air pressure, relative humidity,
    air temperature, and light conditions, according to a particular set of instructions.
    The real-time greenhouse environment may be monitored via email and SMS alerts
    on mobile phones. For example, the installation of soil moisture sensors in the
    greenhouse activates an irrigation system only when the soil is dry. Recently,
    the use of solar-powered IoT sensors (Hou & Gao, 2010) has made building smart
    greenhouses an inexpensive and popular choice. 4.4 Data management With an increase
    in the application of IoT in multiple sectors and high-performance computing trends,
    the conventional database system has failed to meet the need and demand for massive
    sensor-derived data storage. In this regard, cloud base and fogging data storage
    in IoT platforms play a vital role in managing, transferring, and analyzing data
    into meaningful information using analytical tools. Cloud and fog computing have
    their characteristics to process data burdens and preferences, but they supplement
    each other. Using predictive analytics, a farmer could better predict weather
    conditions, maintain crop quality, and enhance soil fertility to formulate better
    plans and decisions related to crop harvesting and enhance crop quality and productivity.
    4.4.1 Cloud computing Cloud-based data management provides an option for computing
    resources on a pay-per-use basis. It is an extension of cluster and grid computing
    that collects resources at one central place and utilizes them for high-performance
    computing employing wireless connections (Qian et al., 2009; Armburst et al.,
    2020; Dillon et al., 2010). Such a computing system could be divided into two
    parts: front end and backend. The front end consists of client devices, such as
    computers, cell phones, tablets, and iPads, whereas the backend consists of data
    storage and processing located far away from the client. Cloud computing architecture
    provides three types of services, such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS),
    PaaS, and Software as a Service (SaaS) (Dempsey & Kelliher, 2018; Jagli et al.,
    2018; Laghari et al., 2016). IaaS platform is a remote data center that provides
    the right to change or configure storage capacity, processing power, and networking
    to their needs. PaaS provides a development platform for an application developer
    to create, test, and launch an application. SaaS deals with ready-made software
    tailored to various business needs and customer services. Cloud technology is
    also used to deliver mobile applications and is called mobile cloud computing
    (MCC). This method handles the information and relocates the storage from mobile
    devices to intense and centralized computing platforms situated in the cloud (Huang,
    2011). MCC takes the pressure off mobile devices by harnessing the power of cloud
    infrastructure. Many cloud service providers are compatible with Windows or Linux
    operating systems, such as Amazon Web Service, Server Space (ITGLOBAL), Microsoft
    Azure (Microsoft Corporation), Google Cloud Platform (Google LLC), IBM Cloud Services
    (International Business Machines Corporation), Adobe Creative Cloud (Adobe Inc),
    and Dropbox (Dropbox Inc). 4.4.2 Fog computing The motivation behind fog computing
    is the need for real-time computing. It is an extension of cloud computing that
    consists of multiple edge nodes directly connected to the physical device. As
    the nodes are physically much closer to the device, it seems more advanced and
    provides better performance than cloud computing for handling user requests and
    emerging standards (Atlam et al., 2018; Khan et al., 2017). Fog computing can
    include cloudlets, a small-scale and robust data center located at the edge of
    the network system to perform computation without sending it to a distant server.
    Thus, fog computing acts as an intermediary between computing hardware and a remote
    server, controls the information being sent to the server, and processes it locally.
    It supports heterogeneous devices to provide greater interoperability than cloud
    computing. However, the security and privacy concerns in Fog computing are big
    issues due to the prevalence of wireless networks from a business point of view
    compared to cloud computing and deserve further research (Khan et al., 2017).
    Because of attacks, such as jamming attacks, and sniffer attacks, numerous organizations
    are focusing on considerable research on the security issue of Fog computing,
    including Cisco, Microsoft Corporation, ARM Holding Plc, and Dell Inc. Farmers
    benefit from cloud and fog data management by registering into the system application.
    The application is often designed to store farmers’ details, agronomic marketing
    details, agronomic vendors, and agricultural service providers, such as fertilizer,
    pesticides, seed, and equipment, and information on the government''s scheme.
    Indeed, cloud and fog data management systems have both advantages and disadvantages
    (Table 6), which largely determine the choice of using one over another. TABLE
    6. Pros and cons of cloud and fog computing in Internet of Things (IoT). Cloud
    for IoT Fog for IoT Pros Cons Pros Cons Improved performance between IoT sensors
    and data processing system High latency because of the distance between client
    devices and data processing centers Low latency because users are geographically
    closer to Fog to get an instant response A more complicated system in data processing
    and storage/decentralized computing Storage capacity can be scalable to store
    and share enormous amounts of data Downtime due to interruption in network and
    multiple connected channels No issues with bandwidth and connection because multiple
    interconnected channels are involved in sending the data Additional expense requires
    routers, hubs, and gateways Virtual processing capabilities on demand via remote
    data center Security and privacy could be limited because thousands of gigabytes
    of data are being transferred simultaneously High security because numerous nodes
    are involved in the complex distribution system Potential for cyberattacks, such
    as jamming and sniffer due to the extension of network''s edge Reduced cost because
    of lower licensing fees than the cost of equipment and maintenance Rescheduling
    of failure management is slow Power efficiency and improved user experiences because
    each node runs efficiently and provides instant response to the users Limited
    scalability—because it cannot be scalable as the cloud 5 CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES
    OF USING IOT IN AGRICULTURE Data-driven agricultural practices are largely focused
    on precision, predictive, smarter, and efficient farming practices with minimal
    use of resources and enhanced agricultural automation (Ayaz et al., 2019; Patil
    et al., 2012). Therefore, the usage of IoT in agriculture is inevitable with the
    increasing demand for food, land, and changes in climatic conditions. However,
    IoT in agriculture presents several challenges. These challenges and opportunities
    are observed at different levels of data handling and analysis: Collection, data
    transmission, processing and storage, and the application of the data inferred
    (i.e., inference drawn from available data without much expense of resources;
    Tzounis et al., 2017) and are discussed in detail as follows. 5.1 Data collection
    Different IoT sensors are typically designed for a particular agriculture practice
    (Dholu & Ghodinde, 2018). The use of such sensors in different locations and climates
    is often challenging and may require either modification in design or further
    calibration. An ideal sensor should be user-friendly, efficient, robust, and able
    to withstand variable weather conditions. Although experts in the field can set
    up, install, and connect equipment, the application of data by farmers on day-to-day
    basis demands skills and training. The collection of real-time data is increasingly
    important in precision farming and requires an active Internet connection, which
    further presents a major challenge in IoT applications in underdeveloped countries
    and rural areas in the United States (Federal Communications Commission, 2020).
    Although IoT has been widely used in the field of precision agriculture, only
    proprietary solutions are currently being implemented, which creates difficulties
    with device compatibility and connectivity. There is a pressing need to discover
    other approaches that employ interoperable hardware built on open standards and
    platforms. Lower priced alternatives to expensive proprietary solutions can be
    found in the form of many already available products that are built on open hardware,
    at least in part (Stočes et al., 2016). Scaling up the use of integrated IoT technologies
    beyond early adopters is important, especially by making existing solutions easier
    to use and more affordable, thereby improving their selection and use by farmers
    and food companies. Therefore, business models that work for small companies and
    systematic analysis of associated costs and benefits may be necessary. More effort
    is necessary in improving the utilization of IoT technologies in a wide range
    of climates, crops, and soils. Efforts could be centered on the development of
    IoT devices for harsh environments (open air, dirt, dust, moisture, animal manure,
    cold storage, hot cleaning treatments, etc.) and for natural objects (plants,
    animals, square meters of soil, perishable food products), which have limited
    ways to embed IoT devices in the objects themselves. This is especially true for
    devices that use new technologies because there has already been a lot of progress
    in adapting more mature technologies (Verdouw et al., 2017). Indeed, IoT includes
    a large variety of heterogeneous devices; therefore, it is challenging to achieve
    high levels of compatibility among devices if they employ dissimilar standards
    and protocols. In order to overcome such obstacles, standard IoT protocols ought
    to be designed (Abbasi et al., 2019). There are several challenges associated
    with UAV deployments in the agricultural sector, including limited flight durations
    (<1 h), small coverage area, high costs, large amounts of imagery data resulting
    from flights, and geometric and radiometric correction issues. Further, UAVs could
    interfere with civilian aircraft and generate safety issues. There are often stringent
    national laws issued by aviation authorities in each country regarding flying
    UAVs. Typically, the only permission granted is for educational or experimental
    purposes. In the United States, the maximum flight altitude is 120 m above ground
    level, and UAVs are not permitted to fly at night. Finally, processing large volumes
    of imagery data requires special skills, time, and software, often demanding the
    use of machine learning, communication technologies, and data repositories. 5.2
    Data transmission, storage, and processing IoT systems must communicate, store,
    and process the data they have acquired. Data transmission is made feasible with
    adequate connectivity. Many parts of the world, including the United States, have
    poor or no broadband and Internet connection. A significant obstacle to IoT applications
    is the access to internet. Presence of agricultural fields in distinct locations
    limits Internet use and other connectivity (Antony et al., 2020). The data collected
    from one agricultural landscape is often not applicable in other areas. Although
    proper storage and security of the collected data are important, the cost of storage
    and further analysis and processing of stored data to develop an inference for
    its application in the fields remains challenging. New technologies, such as Starlink
    (https://www.starlink.com), free TV band/channels, and other communication channels,
    could be exploited to substitute Internet at remote locations. Further, it is
    important to consider human factors when sharing and communicating information
    between farms, regions, and enterprises. 5.3 Data security Security of routing
    protocols is a major challenge in WSNs. Privacy issues in WSNs are either data-oriented
    or context-oriented. The former is largely associated with handling, preserving,
    and integrity of datasets. The latter deals with contextual information like location
    and time (Abbasi et al., 2019). Indeed, data security, anonymity, and privacy
    present both formidable challenges and opportunities to coordinate data transfer,
    availability, and usability securely for both small and large stakeholders. Agricultural
    data can be difficult to mine because of its volume, noise, gaps, and heterogeneity.
    This, however, provides opportunities for data imputation, standardization of
    IoT, integration of multiple domains, and collaborative research in sensor and
    communication technologies (Abbasi et al., 2019; Verdouw et al., 2017). There
    are opportunities for developing high-throughput phenotypic platforms through
    new sensors or improvements in existing sensors, robotics, remotely sensing vehicles,
    communication technologies, and deep learning methods. 5.4 Application of the
    inferred data IoT provides a foundation for smart logistics, intelligent transportation,
    and affordable agricultural application to address climatic challenges, improve
    resource utilization and efficiency, and increased productivity (Chen & Jin, 2012).
    However, challenges remain in efficient data transmission systems and adaptation
    of outputs by farmers. Indeed, farmers must be technology savvy to understand
    and utilize information. Certain changes may be necessary at farmers’ fields,
    which may incur additional expenses for data collection or processing. Rural farmers
    are often hesitant to adopt new technology. The use of IoT in agriculture is challenging
    due to the complexity of agricultural fields and farming operations. Research
    in IoT is often constrained by short-term funding; thus, limiting data collection
    processes. Antony et al. (2020) reported that 2 to 3 years of funding in the agriculture
    sector is relatively ineffective as plants’ cropping cycle may vary with weather
    conditions. However, the need to feed the growing population has bestowed opportunities
    in utilizing recent advances in IoT (Mahanta et al., 2022) in greenhouse farming,
    vertical farming, hydroponic, and plant phenotyping. Nevertheless, we see a plethora
    of opportunities to utilize WSNs, digital twins, machine learning, and cloud computing
    in soil and crop monitoring, irrigation scheduling, water quality analysis, plant
    breeding, weed control, disease, and pest identification, pesticide spray, reuse
    and recycling of wastes, and livestock management. 6 CONCLUSION This paper reviewed
    the application of different IoT platforms, WSNs, and technologies like UAVs,
    cloud computing, and big data analytics in agricultural production systems and
    value chains, such as crop monitoring, irrigation support, weed and pest control,
    fertilizer application, and soil health assessment. The literature, in general,
    indicates the use of sensors, actuators, microcontrollers, and machine learning
    in automated and smart irrigation systems and agricultural decision support. Different
    red, green, and blue, hyperspectral, multispectral, and LiDAR sensors could be
    mounted on UAVs for improved agricultural monitoring and forecasting to enable
    highly efficient, qualitative, and profitable farm products. Big data, data mining,
    and real-time analysis show promise to support and improve precision, prescription,
    enterprise, and automated agriculture. Cloud and fog data storage in IoT platforms,
    however, appear to be crucial in managing, transferring, and analyzing big agricultural
    data. This review also reveals opportunities in improving data security, anonymity,
    and usability, and developing high-throughput phenotypic platforms through new
    sensors or improvements in existing sensors, robotics, remote vehicles, communication
    technologies, and deep learning methods. Overall, IoT can improve production levels,
    cost-effectiveness, product quality, safety, and traceability through innovation,
    automation, and control while advancing the much-needed digital transformation
    of the agricultural sector in the face of climate change. AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS

    and Saudi Arabia are already classified as water-scarce countries, with only Oman
    above the extreme scarcity threshold of 500 cubic meters per capita per year [1].
    The growth of agricultural production is greatly affected by climate change, urban
    population concentration, crop diseases, and greenhouse emissions, all of which
    highlight the need to meet the growing demand for food and energy. With water
    resources already scarce, the Middle East and North Africa regions will be particularly
    vulnerable to climate change [2]. Saudi Arabia is one of the largest arid countries
    without permanent rivers or lakes in the Arabian Peninsula [3,4]. In some parts
    of the region, temperatures can reach more than 50° Celsius (C) (122° Fahrenheit
    (F)), resulting in extremely hot and dry conditions. The country has one of the
    poorest natural renewable water resources [5]. Renewable natural resources can
    be affected by a range of variables, including water demand in different sectors
    and the effects of global warming. There is a recurring theme in research papers
    on water resources and agriculture related to climate change. Because of global
    warming, water adaptation measures have been considered to ensure food production
    and people’s access to water, and the preservation of ecosystems. Further, the
    worsening drought conditions in the peninsular countries have created a need for
    increasing the water supply from alternative sources and the implementation of
    water conservation. Moreover, humans and the environment should be assured of
    their safety as a result of water scarcity or water quality and supply in the
    face of intensifying climate-related impacts. There are various risks associated
    with climate change, including water shortages, water quality reductions, soil
    salinity increases, biodiversity loss, irrigation requirements, and the cost of
    emergency and remedial action to make sure that farmers plant a crop with a guarantee
    of success and generating income. Agriculture is the biggest consumer of water
    in Saudi Arabia, amounting to up the 70% of the total water use, creating a demand
    for optimization strategies. The number of studies focusing on reducing irrigation
    water consumption has increased because of the introduction of smart water management.
    In addition to social, economic, and climate change policies, technological innovations
    can improve water management, according to some studies [6]. Because of the ever-increasing
    demand for food necessities and the diminishing supply of those necessities, there
    is always room for improvement in the production of agricultural produce through
    the adoption of an agro-tech-based system. Only through cultivation can such things
    be provided. There is no doubt that this is an imperative factor in human societies
    when it comes to increasing and maintaining the demand for food production. However,
    the scarcity of land and water has resulted in a decreasing volume of water available
    on farms. Therefore, farmers are using irrigation to supplement their water supply
    system through using high-tech-based systems. It is possible to define irrigation
    as the science of artificially applying water to land or soil. The methods unfolding
    in the agriculture sector are related to what is termed precision agriculture
    capable of estimating the chemistry of the soil to determine the water needs to
    raise a given crop for productive yield. This means that plants are to be provided
    with water according to the type of soil to be irrigated. The virgin fertility
    of the soil is also being investigated using sensor technology. This is in conjunction
    with the collection and study of the characteristics of the soil moisture dynamics
    profile. The purpose is to use this data as feedback to improve farming efficiency
    [7]. The use of renewable energy-powered technology in Seawater Reverse Osmosis
    (SWRO) desalination plants has had an impact on the preparation for embracing
    Industry 4.0 in every sector with promising results benefitting humans and agriculture
    [8,9]. An IoT-enabled framework for automated farming is essentially a network
    consisting of sensory electronics installed and distributed on the farm at specific
    locations and connected through a bi-directional communication channel with the
    management center equipped with related hardware devices harnessed through purposefully
    developed programming modules. This kind of agriculture is growing in quality,
    sustainability, transparency, and cost-effectiveness to maximize crop production
    with lower labor costs. Herein, we propose a system that uses WSN to retrieve
    environmental data in real time in order to optimize irrigation timing implementation.
    The rest of the paper consists of a discussion of related work in Section 2, and
    an outline of the intelligent communication system in Section 3, the monitoring
    flowchart in Section 4, Data collection in Section 5, with design dashboard in
    Section 6, while implementation of test scenarios for real-time implementation
    are described in Section 7, the results and discussion in Section 8, and conclusions
    and further work are given in Section 9. 2. Related Work The Kingdom of Saudi
    Arabia, with a total area of 2.25 million km2, is a large country, bordered by
    Jordon and Iraq and Kuwait in the north, on the east by the Gulf, Bahrain and
    the United Arab Emirates, on the south by the Sultanate of Oman and Yemen, and
    in the west by the Red Sea, giving it a coastline of 1750 km. Saudi Arabia is
    on its way to achieving self-sufficiency in poultry and dairy products [10,11].
    Automatic farming systems are based on the collection of data related to soil
    moisture content, the temperature profile of an indoor covered agriculture farm
    shed, rainfall data, and intra-field wind speed profiles [12,13]. The related
    data archives are stored in a computer server that is capable of providing climate
    prediction, soil condition analysis, and disturbance analysis [14,15]. A fuzzy
    controller was used by Jamroen et al. to adjust irrigation taking into account
    the moisture index and water stress [16] by continuously monitoring the soil moisture
    content and crop water variability. Lloret et al. have used flooding methods to
    carry out irrigation automatically by observing remotely crop variables and climatic
    conditions using an application [17] that allows the farmer to remotely control
    water gates in the water canals. Based on the difference in environmental leaf
    temperatures and light intensity in hydroponic crops under temperature control
    between 28 and 32 degrees Celsius, Puengsungwan et al. propose a method for determining
    root stress in soilless cultivation. According to their proposal, the obtained
    patterns are divided into regions representing natural roots, stress roots, and
    rotten roots. Using IoT technologies, they were able to reduce the system’s response
    time from 5 min to less than 60 s. In addition, they increased detection efficiency
    from 85% to 95% compared to a method that uses the Easy Leaf Area application
    to determine the drop in leaf area [18]. A variety of irrigation systems have
    been used in soil and soilless crops. Different approaches exist to estimate irrigation
    requirements in soil cultivation, highlighting the importance of monitoring and
    controlling the temperature, soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and water stress
    index used for operating micro-sprinklers, drip irrigation, and ventilation fans.
    Several authors, including González-Amarillo [19] and Fernández-Ahumada [20],
    use humidity or temperature measurements to properly maintain conditions within
    an agricultural shed by turning on all related irrigation, ventilation, and heating
    systems. By measuring daily evapotranspiration, Mohamed [21] and Poyen [22] estimate
    irrigation requirements. Mohamed employs the Penman–Monteith method, whereas Poyen
    includes the capability of automatically selecting between Hargreaves and Samni,
    Kharufa, and Penman–Monteith methods according to the type of climate and geographical
    factors by employing modern technologies and intelligent systems for improving
    water productivity and conservation. These are some examples (among many others)
    of how the word \"smart\" is used in works and prototypes that show different
    capabilities and features. In an effort to solve the problem of one-size-fits-all
    qualification, the research community has proposed different taxonomies that classify
    smart artifacts based on their features [23]. Bin Ahmadon et. al. consists of
    two major phases in their paper. Phase one is design, and phase two is implementation.
    Here are the scenarios for two major phases in which a service must be implemented
    in a different [24]. Agro-IoT was an agricultural IoT project that ran from 2015
    to 2020 and featured an architecture that consists of six layers, including sensors,
    actuators, wireless nodes, etc. In addition, there is a network layer that includes
    communication protocols, an intermediate layer for software, an application layer
    for data analysis and prediction, and a user layer where results are communicated
    to farmers, experts in the field, and the supply chain. Among the goals of the
    project were real-time monitoring of low-scale greenhouses, early disease detection,
    identification of crop varieties, optimizing irrigation facilities, and pesticide
    use and fertilizers efficiency. Similarly, solar precision agriculture is seen
    as a four-layer IoT architecture, consisting of the sensory layer, the network
    layer that takes into account IoT nodes and base stations, the decision layer
    that involves server services, workstations, business and knowledge bases, and
    the application availability layer that provides information for researchers,
    experts, and farmers [25,26]. The implemented irrigation solution developed in
    this research is not restricted to the control of irrigation systems. It also
    analyzes every component of the system, from water pipes to sprinklers, to detect
    leaks and malfunctions, while improving efficiency and reducing costs. The proposed
    solution uses Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) to collect real-time information
    data directly in the field to verify the existing conditions. By combining this
    information with weather forecasts, evapotranspiration from soil and other surfaces
    and plants, and farm specifications, artificial intelligence algorithms are able
    to determine how much water is needed for a particular section of the farm by
    adjusting the irrigation controller accordingly. 3. Intelligent Communication
    Systems As shown in Figure 1, the IoT-based irrigation system consists of six
    main elements: Data Acquisition, Data Monitoring, Communication, Data Processing,
    Storage, and Visualization. Figure 1. Block diagram of the IoT-based irrigation
    system. 3.1. Data Acquisition An array of sensors must be used to obtain data
    from soil moisture sensors, rainfall sensors, ambient humidity sensors, and temperature
    sensors, among other devices. The various sensors used to monitor crops are configured
    with a variety of threshold values. This corresponds to the type of crop being
    monitored and depends on the type of sensor. Since the sensors sense and acquire
    data at intervals, the measurements will be sent through Wi-Fi modules to be processed
    according to the parameters of each of the measurements. 3.2. Data Monitoring
    A supervisory system is required to manage and monitor the information gathered
    by the sensors (temperature, rainfall, and moisture), as well as on crops and
    their cycles. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) is used to display the information
    that is stored in the database. A statistical analysis of the amount of water
    consumed by crops with respect to their dates and sections has been carried out
    as a result of monitoring. Finally, all data are requested through the use of
    web services, which are made available on the Internet for access by authorized
    personnel. 3.3. Communication Networking The sensors are connected to Arduino
    microcontroller development boards that use ESP8266 Wi-Fi modules to communicate
    with the database, and everything is done via the cloud since the entire solution
    relies on the cloud for connectivity. The database is not directly connected to
    the sensor because it is not secure. Data is entered into the database using a
    Web Service (WS). The Wi-Fi module transmits two fields: (1) the identification
    number (ID), and (2) the value of the sensor. Each type of sensor is assigned
    a unique ID based on its IP address and a unique number. As an identifier, it
    serves the purpose of identifying the source of information. The data is processed
    to determine if irrigation is required. The watering schedule is updated when
    it is determined that watering is necessary based on the interpretation of the
    information. An electronic valve is incorporated into the irrigation system and
    is controlled by the Arduino via the Wi-Fi module. Since the Wi-Fi Module does
    not have a public IP address, it cannot be identified from the cloud, and therefore
    requests cannot be sent from the cloud to the module. In the same manner, the
    Wi-Fi module continuously queries the web service for information. The valve is
    activated in response to an update in the WS with the time the system was powered
    on. The Wi-Fi module is assigned a static IP address whenever it is connected
    to an Internet gateway, making it easier to access from the Internet. In order
    to monitor data in a timely manner, data visualization along with database information
    is required. A web application for data visualization has been used in this case
    study, but other methods may also be employed. Previous projects used the data
    collected in order to increase the productivity of the garden or farm, as well
    as to reduce the amount of water used. Although these ideas are useful in theory,
    they may not be able to be implemented in a practical scenario. In our system,
    the algorithm enables the system to understand how much water should be applied
    to the field based on the moisture in the field; however, the field is watered
    only when moisture levels are low. Using this approach, we were able to save approximately
    25% of our budget. Despite this, our previous systems lack a certain level of
    reliability, which can be attributed mainly to the selected sensors. In addition,
    they need to be tested in a larger scenario. In order to improve results and to
    make sure that the solution works in multiple environments, the wireless network
    will play a crucial role in ensuring its effectiveness. 3.4. Data Processing Soil
    moisture, temperature, and rainfall are received as sensor data in the form of
    three integer values. Decisions regarding the crop can be made based on the information
    provided by this data. It is necessary to note that the valve will only open if
    the soil moisture is below the level required for the crop. In the case of sprinkler
    irrigation, the water temperature will determine whether irrigation is required.
    The system will not permit the watering of the plants in the event of rain. The
    valve can either be opened or no action taken depending on the values collected
    by the sensors. 3.5. Storage Databases are necessary to store information about
    crop types, sensors, moisture, and statistical data. The database used in the
    application is schematically as shown in Figure 2. The purpose of this structure
    is to store information about crops, their cycles, and the order in which each
    irrigation should be performed. Furthermore, information about the monitored sections
    is saved, as well as that of the sensors associated with each section. The system
    uses the IoT to determine the amount of water needed for every crop in every cycle
    using a “smart irrigation” system. Instead of creating another smart irrigation
    controller, in this work, we have created a smart sustainable irrigation solution.
    This solution also analyzes every component of the system, from the pipes that
    supply the water to the sprinklers. This is because it analyzes their interaction.
    During this analysis, the aim is to detect potential leaks or malfunctions, improve
    efficiency and reduce costs in a sustainable way in line with the requirements
    of a circular economy. Figure 2. Flowchart of the IoT-based irrigation system.
    3.6. Visualization The administrator will be able to control the variables (sensor
    data), as well as irrigate the crop in order to ensure that the resulting data
    are presented in an appropriate manner. There are different irrigation configurations
    for each type of crop when it comes to visualization and interaction with users.
    When this is not possible, the possibility of adjusting the configuration of crops
    is available based on a predetermined composition. 4. Flowchart Initially, the
    user interacts with the irrigation system using a mobile application or any other
    connected interface to extract data regarding the current soil conditions and
    moisture in order to change the state of the irrigation system. The sensor node/mote
    measures the soil moisture, temperature, and humidity of the surrounding environment
    of—in this case of this study—each date palm tree. The information can be received
    using an automated system as shown in Figure 2. Users can make a decision with
    respect to watering based on the data available/provided on the application or
    system. The method will lead to accurate agricultural techniques to closely monitor
    the conditions of the field and use real-time data to realize the most efficient
    irrigation. 5. Data Collection and Connection All sensor nodes have been installed
    and are connected to the network master node. The node will send information packets
    to every sensor hub bearing the sensor hub ID if communication is present in the
    node. After acquiring the data packets from the sensors, the measured values of
    soil parameters are analyzed—for example: Soil moisture assessment (30%). A pH
    value is used to determine whether the soil is acidic or alkaline. The sensors
    assess the quality of the equipment, and these quality values are stored in the
    memory of the Arduino microcontroller unit (MCU). In response to these stored
    values, the MCU responds by performing specific actions according to the listed
    conditions. When data packets are received from the sensor node, the MCU transmits
    them wirelessly to the master node, thereby participating in the Internet of Things
    (IoT) environment activities. 6. Designed Monitoring Dashboard The dashboard can
    be thought of as a server that can be designed using a mobile device, as shown
    in Figure 3. Using the dashboard, the user will be able to monitor the amount
    of water flow, and parameters such as temperature and humidity. In addition, users
    are also able to turn on/off the water pump just by operating the monitoring dashboard.
    There is a control button (On/Off) shown in Figure 4 that shows the installed
    applications with the dashboard. Figure 3. Dashboard display of the mobile device
    application. Figure 4. Implementation of IOT-based systems at medium and large
    scales. The sensor and electronics are powered by DC power derived from solar
    panels, and the amount of power generated is determined by the rating of the solar
    panels. As shown in Figure 3, the solar system produces DC power for charging
    the battery via the charging kit. This power can be directed to the inverter by
    the inverter circuit. The inverter is needed to convert the DC power to AC because
    older water pumps run on AC power. In order to implement this system, we have
    used a number of hardware components, such as: (a) Solar panels, (b) Charging
    kits, (c) Batteries, and (d) Inverters. It has become possible to implement the
    software on a mobile phone. However, the oversized bloated network model is not
    conducive to the deployment of the device’s software. 7. Real-Time Implementation
    A schematic diagram of the automated irrigation system is shown in Figure 1. The
    system is designed with devices capable of controlling water delivery, a management
    unit, a soil moisture sensing unit, and an on-spot processing unit, as shown in
    Figure 4. The remote database is an installation to store the contiguous farming
    data structure. Climatic parameters, including soil moisture level, are obtained
    from the sector of each sensory mote. Through the personal interface of the internet
    utility, the user can control the water valve by converting the positioning monitor
    to real-time climate situations within the field. There are many factors that
    affect actual water usage, including the type of plants, the evapotranspiration
    rate, the amount of field area, the type of valves and the pipes, the distance
    between the valves, and the number of waterings per day. Taking all these parameters
    into consideration, and using Equation (1), we can calculate the actual amount
    of water that needs to be applied to the field. Time= Area×( K c + ET r )×60 F×N
    ×100 /Period (1) where Time is the irrigation time in minutes, Kc is the crop
    coefficient (here, the coefficient ranges between approximately 7.04 mm/day and
    11.7 mm/day), F is the water flow per valve in m3/h, N is the number of valves,
    and Area is the field area in m2. Based on Equation (1) and how much data can
    be input to achieve accurate results, three analyses have been done and compared
    to the performance of a normal irrigation system: Calculation of irrigation times
    using Equation (1) and forecast data; The irrigation system is controlled by Equation
    (1) and sensor data; Controlled irrigation system using Equation (1) and sensor
    data to estimate irrigation times. There is no doubt that the concept and applications
    of the IoT (Internet of Things) are becoming more and more relevant in our world.
    This can be attributed to the fact that there is the possibility of interconnecting
    any object or device through the network. This can be done by using various types
    of communication technologies and protocols. This interconnection can be achieved
    by using a variety of different types of networks, some of the best-known and
    widely disseminated ones being WiFi (Wireless Fidelity), LTE (Long-Term Evolution),
    Bluetooth, and so on. Based on the proposed system, we intend to validate the
    implementation of a WSN environment in medium-scale crops for a specific crop
    variation and an area specific to the crop. The main objective of this study was
    to minimize the cost of the sensor devices whilst optimizing the technical characteristics
    that the deployed devices should have. As a result of this information, it will
    be possible in the future to produce on a large scale monitored and sustainable
    crops, as shown in Figure 5. Figure 5. An overview of the output in a graphical
    format—soil moisture. 8. Results and Discussion IoT applications have developed
    a variety of specialized communication protocols that have the potential to become
    long-term standards with global acceptance and that are associated with significant
    benefits at the time of their implementation as well. It is still critical to
    know the specifications and technical capabilities of each protocol in order to
    choose the one that is appropriate for your application and environment. Therefore,
    the macro project that led to the publication of this article proposed the creation
    of a model that could be used to analyze and simulate the behavior of the key
    performance indicators of the system. The information provided in this paper is
    structured in such a way that it becomes a very comprehensive decision-making
    tool that contributes to the research and development of relevant knowledge in
    this field as well as the implementation of it in environments. As a result of
    providing the sensors with data in the form of voltage, this data is presented
    to the microcontroller. The microcontroller, after calibrating these values, gives
    us the moisture content of the soil in percentage values. The data is sent continuously
    from the IoT device to the online site through the wireless network to be displayed
    on the computer screen being used. The dashboard display is also refreshed every
    three seconds to make sure the real-time data availability, and just in case of
    possible Internet disruption, reloading page will let us know about it. This model
    is designed to manage water for irrigating date palm trees. The development and
    improvement of date palms require a lot of water in order to grow and improve
    the quality of the dates at harvest time. However, it should be noted that consistent
    dry weather leads to insufficient water as a result of dispersal, waste, and penetration.
    Precise irrigation will help in achieving remarkable yields from the date palm.
    However, at the same time, the quality of the dates will still depend on the decision
    of when to harvest. Figure 5 shows the output of the proposed model in graphical
    form. There is no better way to display data than to use a graphical representation
    in the form of a diagram. Also, visual representations are much more memorable.
    As we not only display the moisture content (data) as text but also in visual
    form, this helps the user to quickly and easily notice the sudden changes in the
    data or information that has been displayed. Data were collected from each sensor
    node of the WSN containing real-time information about the environmental conditions
    of the farm. The set of data collected that represents the year as a whole is
    shown in Figure 6. The winter season in the study area starts at the end of October
    and lasts until the beginning of February. November and December are the months
    when the weather is at its most pleasant. As a result, less water is needed for
    irrigation, which is in contrast with summertime, when it is mostly dry and needs
    a lot more water. Figure 6. Data collected during the whole year in Saudi Arabia.
    The first thing to note is that, in the testing period, there are no rain periods
    in Saudi Arabia. This means that watering is mainly done when soil moisture is
    less than 30%. It is also possible to note that humidity levels in Saudi Arabia
    are high at that time of year, which helps the soil moisture to decline more slowly.
    Therefore, the water used for irrigation can be less. The measurement of humidity
    parameters in the soil and the subsequent processing of this information constitutes
    a fundamental element for decision-making in the technical environments of smart
    agriculture. This leads, for example, to establishing the appropriate sowing and
    harvesting periods to improve the productivity of dates in Saudi Arabia. Smart
    farms are an especially significant aspect that must be addressed by systems engineering,
    electronic engineering, and data science. The analysis of large volumes of information
    using time series, big data, data mining, and other analysis methodologies allows
    the finding of patterns that allow intelligent decision-making. This allows us
    to improve and optimize different plants in the Agro sector. Thanks to the integration
    of the IoT and different sensors in cloud platforms, it is possible to improve
    many aspects related to plant growth. This includes saving on inputs and pest
    control. The novelty of this work lies in the implementation of the idea through
    the use of components and devices available in the market as shown in Figure 6.
    However, it is through the development of the user interface shown in Figure 4
    that the authors realized their search for real-time data acquisition. The quantifiable
    characterization of the soil through the use of spectral characteristics for each
    pixel in an image of a scene is another attractive area to be pursued for cloud-based
    non-intrusive irrigation systems, soil data, or underground water quality collection
    [27]. 9. Conclusions This proposed irrigation system can measure soil moisture
    and temperature as well as the atmospheric temperature of the field and can transmit
    the data in real-time to the user using Wi-Fi and an IoT server. The IoT-based
    irrigation system is superior to other irrigation systems recently proposed and
    developed. This is because, in the past, the process of implementing automatic
    irrigation was done in a traditional, luxurious, and inefficient manner, which
    results in a small profit margin and misfortunes in production. This paper proposes
    the utilization of IoT communication to develop an automated irrigation system
    for agricultural monitoring. This analysis has allowed the authors to confirm
    that the implementation model has the capability of being more effective, accurate,
    and responsive in a very short period of time. Additionally, the proposed model
    is better than existing models based on the Internet of Things due to the advantages
    it offers compared to those models: by creating a dashboard based on the HTTP
    protocol, users will be able to change parameters such as moisture and water flow
    rates through IoT devices, as well as turn on/off water pumps. Future work may
    include the integration of sensor grids in order to be able to determine important
    parameters such as pH, CEC, SAR, organic constituents of the soil, and other crucial
    parameters. The paper is produced with a critical review of contemporary literature
    and the use of an algorithm to support the title. It makes a useful contribution
    to the body of engineering knowledge through the use of simple electronics and
    simple program code for application development. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

    India SECTION I. Introduction The agricultural production and the associated fields
    need technological developers to work to grow their efficacy, effectiveness and
    creativity in order to enhance the productivity, including environmental sensors,
    synthetic biology on agricultural crops and equipment. Thus, it is anticipated
    that there would be a decrease in operating expenses as well as adverse effects
    mostly on natural atmosphere, which would also eventually generate huge risks.
    Agriculture is critical for humanity’s basic necessities, as food availability
    has a significant effect on society at large resilience and the agricultural production
    work has been flat throughout the last few decades. With respect to the survey
    of the World-Bank, the quantity and ratio of agriculture field based workers has
    been reducing from the year of 2005-to-2020. The following figure, Fig-1 illustrates
    that in clear manner by using the graphical representation. Workers are those
    who engage for a formal or informal firm, but are compensated in the terms of
    wages, salaries, incentive, gratuity or other forms of compensation. Women and
    men workers have a relatively equal proportion and the field of agriculture employs
    around 27% females and 30% males, accounting for more than 29% of total workers.
    A possible way to overcoming this manpower deficit is through the application
    of technological advances in the agricultural industry. For example, mostly during
    agricultural revolution, the development of agricultural machinery including agricultural
    vehicles like tractors and planters mitigated some of the potentially serious
    consequences associated with man-power reductions. Merely few more enterprises
    or agricultural processes in different countries such as Indonesia make use through
    machine learning and artificial intelligence initiatives, which range beyond autonomous
    vehicles to pruning drones and harvesting equipment [1][2]. Fig. 1 Agricultural
    Field Worker’s Ratio over Past Few Decades Show All Numerous agricultural fields
    monitoring robot designs have also been developed and marketed, including facilities
    for watering systems with an irrigation mechanism which can be regulated via temperature
    and relative humidity readings through an Android Smartphone. Additionally, the
    Autonomous Farming Robotics method enables information through the internet, making
    the process globally accessible as well as adaptable. The independent machine
    is equipped with an irrigation system and t o ensure that crops receive adequate
    important nutrients, caution should be exercised in the manner of adequate water
    [3][4] Irrigating farmland seems to be the most critical and also time-consuming
    operation in agriculture field, particularly during the summer months. Human irrigation
    adds another level of effort as well as takes a lot of time. As a result, an efficient
    technology is required to address these issues and anself watering solutions will
    be used effectively to crop irrigation as demanded, allowing for greater control
    over how and when watering is required. This technique is efficient in a variety
    of settings, including private spaces to big crop fields, and thereby conserves
    water. For efficient watering, the above prototype can be executed, in which it
    utilizing pumps or dripping emitters and in some cases solar panels can also be
    used to conserve resources on a vast scale of agricultural field monitoring system
    [5] [6]. In literatures, there is several machine learning and Internet of Things
    (IoT) enabled schemes available to identify the crop growth and do the agriculture
    in systematic manner. However, all these innovations are strucked in certain level
    of existence due to the practical disabilities such as cost expensiveness, circuit
    complexity is more, not in a scalable form and performance lacking and technical
    requirement is expected to be high to operate such device and so on [7]. These
    complexities make the farmers to neglect such kind of devices and technologies
    to work with. Additional challenge that an agriculture robotics design is it must
    overcome the functioning in constrained places, which can also be extremely difficult
    attributable to foliage, stones and other objects that obstruct traditional automation
    solutions. Agricultural harvesting is a labor-intensive and huge time consumption
    procedure that scientists have really been studying for more than six years [8][9].
    This paper is intended to design a new agricultural field monitoring robot called
    eAgriBot, in which it consists of multiple latest technology association such
    as machine learning, digital camera for crop surveillance and smart sensors such
    as soil moisture level monitoring sensor and temperature identification sensor.
    Based on these latest technology associations, the proposed eAgriBot operates
    in an intelligent manner and provides an excellent man free agricultural monitoring
    and controlling system in an efficient manner. The eAgriBot is considered to be
    the moving robot, in which it moves over the crop fields with auto adjusting wheels
    and basements. The location identification and border marking facilities inform
    the robot to move only the specific location with correct boundaries. eAgriBot
    Design The agricultural field monitoring robot called eAgriBot design is planned
    to construct with aluminum metal and the sensor units are safe enough to place
    inside the robot in fine manner. The sensors such as temperature and the soil
    moisture level identifier are associated with the eAgriBot to monitor the respective
    details instantly. For measuring the soil temperature, a sensor named DS18B20
    is used to identify the temperature level of the farm land and the specialized
    soil irrigation sensor is attached with the eAgriBot to monitor the agricultural
    field in live manner. The following figure, Fig-2 (a) illustrates the perception
    of Soil Moisture Sensor and the figure, Fig-2 (b) portrays the temperature monitoring
    sensor in graphical manner. Fig. 2 (a) Soil Moisture and (b) Temperature Sensor
    Show All A digital camera with 1024X720 pixel ratios is placed in front of the
    robot to monitor the crop fields and identify the leaf diseases based on the affection/severity
    levels on leaves in fine manner by using the proposed machine learning concept
    called Smart Learning Assisted Data Manipulation. For moving the robot from one
    end to the other end, a standard wheel-base is designed with four self-adjustable
    wheels, in which it operates according to the principles of location specified
    into the controller. The location specifications are clearly marked to the respective
    eAgriBot and place that into the corresponding agricultural fields for monitoring
    the crops. The controller used over eAgriBot is ESP8266 based WiFi module with
    predefined controller, in which it provides dual options such as control the eAgriBot
    based on the commands inserted into it as well as it provides the Wireless Communication
    facilities to transfer the agricultural field data and the associated crop images
    to the server monitoring end for manipulations. The following figure, Fig-3illustrates
    the perception of proposed eAgriBottransmitter section block diagram in clear
    manner. The following figure, Fig-4 shows the clear view of proposed eAgriBot
    receiver section block diagram with respective receiver end and relay unit. The
    relay unit is used to systematic trigger of the water pump connected with the
    power source, in which it will be triggered automatically when the soil moisture
    sensor from the transmitter end of eAgriBot gives LOW signal and the water pump
    will automatically triggered off, when the eAgriBot gives HIGH signal to the receiver
    unit. Fig-3 eAgriBot Transmitter Unit Block Diagram Show All Fig-4 eAgriBot Transmitter
    Unit Block Diagram Show All Location and Alert Management The main complexity
    of managing the agricultural field with the help of robots is to specify the location
    and position where the robot needs to monitor. This complexity makes many agricultural
    field monitoring robots to go down and leads to poor performance. In this paper,
    intelligent boundary definitions are fixed to the robot to monitor exactly the
    places surround with defined boundaries. The following equation is used to define
    the boundary ratio of the agricultural fields based on the location specified
    with latitude and longitude determinations. f(x)= B 0 + ∑ n i=1 (T S n x L(0)
    i +y L(1) i ) (1) View Source Where f(X) defines the function for identifying
    the agriculture field boundaries in four sides, B0indicates the boundary of the
    field, TS indicates the total surface area of the field, X and Y are the respective
    marking points to move the robot accordingly and L is an array variable to manage
    the latitude and longitude specifications, in which the variable with indexing
    of L(0) indicates the Latitude and the variable with indexing of L(1) specifies
    the longitude of the region. The location specifications are successfully handled
    by using the mentioned equation and the latitude and longitude specifications
    are monitored by using the Global Positioning System module called GPS mentioned
    in the block diagram over the figure, Fig-3. Based on these specifications of
    location and boundaries the proposed robot eAgriBot navigates into the crop field
    and monitor accordingly. The eAgriBot can navigate in four directions in bidirectional
    manner such as forward, backward, left and right. This robot has a mobile control
    provisions as well, but in certain cases only it is required and most of the time
    automatic automations are held on for monitoring the agricultural field in an
    intelligent manner. The alert mechanisms are handled by using the Global System
    for Mobile communications (GSM) module, in which it is also specified in the block
    diagram over the figure, Fig-3. By using this GSM module, the respective farmer’s
    mobile number is accumulated from the remote server by using the controller and
    sends the associated alert messages regarding the emergency situations instantly
    without any delay. This system provides a separate web portal and Android application
    to register the identity of the farmers with respect to the eAgriBot index. The
    sensors connected with the robot identify the trigger, in which those values will
    be sending to the remote server by sing the interconnected controller. The trigger
    values are cross-validated with the proposed machine learning algorithm and the
    resultant value is analyzed further. The outcome of this analysis results with
    true, the alert notification will be immediately sent to the respective farmer
    based on the collected mobile number from the server and the values are normally
    maintained into the server end for further validation. The following equation
    is used to cross-validate the trigger values with the proposed trained model.
    T r (T,S ) i=1−n = ∑ n i=1 ( T S )Ω( Tx Sx )⋅ i x (2) View Source Where Tr indicates
    the trigger variable. T and S are the temperature and Soil moisture levels, Tx
    and Sx indicates the trained model temperature and soil moisture levels, in which
    these trained samples from 1 to n are acquired for cross-validation. SECTION II.
    Related Study Jan-Peters et al., 2020 [10] proposed a paper related to the logic
    of utilizing stochastic mobility algorithms, scooping movements in tea farming
    robot. In this paper [10], the authors illustrated such as: this system proposes
    a tea leaf picking robot and to extract enhanced quality tea, the robotic machine
    must pick the leaves from the plant’s stem before harming it with cutters. To
    harvest the tea leaves, a complicated psychological hands movement of dragging
    simultaneously spinning must be replicated. Additionally, the rotations and tugging
    of the arm, as well as the energy consumed, varies significantly based on several
    factors such as leaf age, petiole breadth and borough diameter. As a result, the
    quantity of longitudinal and transverse action, as well as the duration of the
    oscillation, must be determined for each case. The intricate motion is duplicated
    in this study by understanding from demonstrations and the quality is determined
    on the basis of the limb flexibility, that is characterized like the strength
    absorbed per unit thickness as from arms so when clutched leaves are moderately
    got up. By randomly integrating the acquired movements at a proportion dictated
    by the limb rigidity, the proper mobility is obtained, even when no momentum is
    provided. The movements created by the suggested method [10] are compared to those
    provided by people to demonstrate the suggested approach’s usefulness. Experiments
    have demonstrated that the proposed approach is capable of harvesting enhanced
    tea quality. Pratap-Tokekar et al., 2020 [11] proposed a paper related to the
    concept of Understanding a Geometric Environment in the Shortest Time Frame With
    a Robotics Team. In this paper [11], the authors illustrated such as: an informational
    optimization problems is examined in this research [8] with the objective of eliminating
    the timeframe needed to undertake a continuously changing item. For analyzing
    the fundamental region, a Gaussian process regression is used. The main objective
    [11] is to keep the Gaussian process posterior deviation under a set point, which
    is just the confusion matrix in between acquired and genuine disciplines. There
    are three alternative solutions to the issues and t he purpose of the placement
    iteration is to cut down on the number of survey places while preserving a downstream
    deviation less than a predefined level and aim to minimize the overall amount
    of time needed to attend and acquire observations from measuring places that used
    a solitary robot system in the autonomous vehicle variant. Additionally, a multi-robot
    model is investigated in which the goal is to reduce the time needed for the final
    machine to come to a common reference place, in which it is mentioned as depot.
    A continuous factor concerned with methods are described that take advantage of
    the features of Gaussian process regression and along with the simulated result,
    the experimental effectiveness of the proposed strategy [11] is compared to that
    of other review of existing using a statistical methodology. Jinhui-Li ers et
    al., 2020 [12] proposed a paper related to the recognition and positioning of
    fruit cultivating plants for vision based reaping robots. In this paper [12],
    the authors illustrated such as litchi bunches appear spontaneously as well as
    unevenly in fruit orchards, it is hard to comprehend and find many litchi bunches''
    fruit bearing limbs at the same period. This is really a tough challenge for visual
    based gathering robots because it requires uninterrupted supply throughout the
    environment and the purpose of this work was to build a good estimate for precisely
    as well as dynamically detecting and locating fruit bearing limbs of several litchi
    groups in wide areas using RGB depth cameras throughout the environment. The pictures
    were segmented into three groups using a semi - supervised approach called Deeplabv-3.
    A pre processing system is presented to align divided RGB pictures and to eliminate
    fruitless stems. Following that, the twig binary map picture was handled using
    framework separation and trimming processes, leaving just the mainline denominations
    of branches remained. Filtering the images in the 3D region of the limb structure
    map using a non-parametric concentration geospatial classification method including
    uncertainty is being used to find the fruit bearing limbs corresponding to almost
    the same litchi groups. Furthermore, using singular value decomposition, a 3D
    straight line was matched to every other group, with the continuous signal corresponding
    to the position of fruit-bearing branches. To evaluate the suggested technique,
    452-pairs of RGB Depth photos got gathered across various light conditions and
    the findings indicate that the correctness of detecting a litchi berries limb
    is around 83%, the spatial resolution is 17.29° || 24.57° and the computation
    time for determining an unique litchi berries limb is 0.464 seconds. Investigations
    in the environment demonstrate that this strategy is successful for guiding the
    robot through constant plucking activities. Kondaka et al., 2020 [13], [14] proposed
    a paper related to a dynamic replication and analysis of rectangular robot design
    based on narrow territories. In this paper [13], the authors illustrated such
    as: in general, rectangular robots consist of a porous layer as well as an underlying
    actuator mechanism. These machines are used for a range of tasks, spanning rescue
    operations to farming. Because one of the significant benefits of rectangular
    robots is the capacity to function on uneven terrain, similar machines'' performance
    evaluation and route planning have already been investigated exclusively on flat
    terrains. This paper develops a unique method for evaluating the equilibrium models,
    emissions and isolation assessment of this robot moving across difficult territories.
    The route optimization techniques are constructed to discover the optimizing the
    parameters using the proposed innovation diffusion theory, dissociation evaluation
    and conceptual design. One of the benefits of such a study is that those same
    methods may be utilized either with quantitative or observational environment
    knowledge. SECTION III. System Methodologies In this paper, a new machine learning
    strategy is introduced called Smart Learning Assisted Data Manipulation (SLADM),
    in which it is derived from the conventional machine learning approach, called
    Random Forest (RF) Classifier. The conventional RF classification technique is
    a well-known, scalable, robust and user-friendly learning procedure, in which
    it utilizes the property of hyper parameter tuning option but in certain cases
    the algorithm can operate efficiently even without adopting this hyper parameters
    tuning logic. This algorithm is mostly used in the real-time evaluations for classification
    strategies due to its robustness, simplicity and it attains best possible optimum
    solutions in outcome. This paper is intended to design a new robotic machine called
    eAgriBot with the adaptation of multiple latest technologies such as machine learning,
    digital image processing and prediction logic. So, that a new machine learning
    logic is designed with respect to the conventional principles. In this proposed
    system, a novel learning approach is designed called as SLADM based on the hyper
    tuning of conventional RF classification methodology with modified input parameters
    such as Temperature level of the agricultural field, Soil Moisture Level and the
    crop images acquired from the digital camera connected over the eAgriBot. Based
    on these input parameters the entire robotic operations are handled with proper
    manner and the collected real-time details from the agricultural land is transmitted
    to the processing server end through the logic of ESP8266 WiFi controller placed
    into the robot. The proposed Smart Learning Assisted Data Manipulation logic is
    designed with respect to the operations of both data and image processing, in
    which it received the data from the eAgriBot and segregate it based on the textual
    and image oriented features. The extracted data is assembled into the respective
    storage unit, in which the storage environment is allocated as two separate portions.
    One is assigning for accommodating the textual data and the other portion is allocated
    for the image oriented data processing, in this highly volatile memory is assigned
    for textual feature processing and scalable memory is assigned for image oriented
    processing. Because usually the processing of images requires more memory as compared
    to the textual data oriented processing. So, that the volatile memory is assigned
    to textual data processing, in which it assigns the unwanted memory storage to
    the scalable memory unit for processing the image oriented features if necessary.
    The movement of eAgriBot is controlled by using border definitions, in which it
    specify the exact location details of the robot to move around accordingly. The
    robot follow the commands specified into the controller and operate the motors
    connected into it accordingly with respect to GPS based location extraction norms.
    The moving robot captures the image from the agricultural field and store it into
    the server end sing WiFi connections, in which the proposed classification logic
    called SLADM accumulates the image features based on the pre-processing logic
    as well the feature extraction principles. The pre-processing logic modulates
    the size and structure of the input crop image in fine manner using the following
    formulation. I(x)← ∑ n i=1 S.i( O P −256 − − − − − − − − √ ) (3) View Source Where
    I(x) indicates the image pre-processing function variable, S indicate the overall
    size of the input crop image, OP indicates the original pixel values of the input
    and that will be reduced with respect to the maximum pixel range of 256. The image
    is further processing for extracting the features of the resized pixels, in which
    the following equation is used to extract the features of the image in clear manner.
    F P (x)←Ma x P +( ∑ n i=1 P(x)+I(x){R(i)⋅G(i)⋅B(i)}) (4) View Source Where FP
    indicates the feature extraction function variable, MaxP indicates the maximum
    pixel range of the selected input image for feature extraction, P(x) indicates
    the minimum pixel level of the input image and it will be incremented upto the
    last pixel of the image with respect to the color coordinates R, G and B. SECTION
    IV. Results and Discussions This section describes the experimental analysis of
    the proposed machine learning approach called SLADM with respect to the data and
    image processing logics. The resulting emulations are done by using the OpenSource
    code development tool called Python with embedded logics are completed by using
    C language. The resulting nature of the proposed approach is properly attained
    with expected outcome ratio and the following figure, Fig-5 illustrates the step-by-step
    process of manipulating the images and identifies the affections in crops using
    leaf images. Fig. 5 Process Flow Diagram for Crop Image Estimation to Detect the
    Presence of Diseases in Leaves Show All The following figure, Fig-6 illustrates
    the view of number of times the soil moisture level identification sensor detect
    the trigger level and the respective triggers sent to water pump area by using
    the WiFi controller unit. In this diagramitic representation, the perception of
    nmber of triggers detected by using the soil moisture sensor and number of triggers
    detected by using the soil moisture sensor is clearly shown in graphical manner.
    This estimation is defined based on the placement of such soil moisture sensor
    into the agricultural land for 10 continous days and attin the results accordingly.
    Fig. 6 Soil Moisture Sensor Trigger Estimation Show All The following figure,
    Fig-7 illustrates the view of proposed approach data maniplation accuracy with
    respect to the temperature prediction levels, in which the proposed temperature
    estimation sensor DS18B20 accumulates the temperature ratio of the respective
    agricultural land and send that to the processing server unit. In server end it
    verifies the temperature level and return the proper predictions based on the
    model trained with respect to the proposed machine learning procedure SLADM. The
    resultant figure, Fig-7 portrays the prediction accuracy of the temperature sensor
    and the proposed SLADM logic in clear manner with graphical representation. Fig.
    7 Temperature Sensor Accuracy Level Estimation Show All The following figure,
    Fig-8 illustrates the view of input leaf image acquired from the eAgriBot, in
    which the digital camera placed infront of the robot captures the image from the
    agricultural field and sent to the server end for processing. This figure, Fig-8
    acquires that image for further process such as pre-processing, feature extraction
    and classification. Fig. 8 Input Image Captured by using eAgriBot Show All The
    following figure, Fig-9 illustrates the view of Pre-processed image nature and
    the extracted features are smmarized into the array unit for classification, in
    which it is important to identify the disease presented into the leaf image. Fig.
    9 Cluster View with Glaucoma Image Objects Show All The following figure, Fig-10
    (a) illustrates the view of classification portion of the image processing logic,
    in which it is useful to predict the leaf image acquired from eAgriBot contains
    the disease or not. This classification strategy is acquired from the machine
    learning principles, so that the accuracy levels of classification is fine enough
    to identify the healthiness of the leaf. And the figure, Fig-10 (b) illustrates
    the graphical representation of the accuracy parameters, in which the proposed
    machine learning approach produces the accuracy ratio of 99.2%. This accuracy
    measurement is illustrated via the graphical representation over the mentioned
    figure in clear manner. Fig. 10 (a) Classification Perception and (b) Accuracy
    Ratio Show All SECTION V. Conclusion and Future Scope This proposed Machine Learning
    based Robot called eAgriBot is suitable for small and large scale agricultural
    fields to monitor the land in an efficient manner. The experimental proofs show
    the efficiency in terms of accuracy measurements and graphical representations.
    The proposed machine learning approach Smart Learning Assisted Data Manipulation
    provides a dual support for processing textual data as well as the image data
    in fine manner with best accuracy ratio of 99.2%. This kind of robotic model eliminates
    the stuggles of farmers and provides a huge support to them to improve their productivity
    as well as improve their levels in society. The latest technologies are so helpful
    in this application to operate the robot in intellectual manner. The resulting
    section shows the proper proof for all the mentioned things in proper manner such
    as the resulting figure, Fig-6 portrays the view of soil irrigation sensor working
    efficiency with respect to the surveillance of continuous ten days over the agricultural
    land. The resulting section figure, Fig-7 shows the efficiency of temperature
    sensor and the following figures on that sections are clearly demonstrating the
    intelligence of the proposed logic SLADM. For all the proposed approach is fair
    enough to monitor the agricultural field in an efficient manner. In future, the
    work can further be enhanced by means of adding some more sensors such as humidity
    measurement sensor; light intensity identification sensor and so on to provide
    more efficiency to the robot as well as it improves the intelligence of the robot.

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Chengdu, China SECTION I. Introduction With
    the improvement of people’s living standards and living conditions, more and more
    families use balconies and courtyards to plant flowers, vegetables, melons and
    fruits, so as to beautify the home environment, harvest green food and enjoy a
    healthy life, which makes home planting become a fashion and a part of urban agriculture
    and forestry production [1–2]. However, due to the host’s business trip, travel,
    busy work and other reasons, the plants are not taken good care of from time to
    time, on the other hand, according to the relevant investigation, the phenomenon
    of low survival rate of plants due to lack of planting experience is also common.
    In order to solve these problems, it is necessary to develop a home smart planting
    system. The emergence of the Internet of Things(IoT), known as the third information
    technology revolution, has been widely used in smart home, precision agriculture,
    intelligent transportation, telemedicine and other aspects [3–4]. To introduce
    IoT technology into home planting can monitor the planting environment and plant
    growth status in real time, and control the irrigation devices automatically and
    remotely, so as to realize smart planting and scientific management. Based on
    IoT, the home smart planting system realizes the connection of things among the
    users, planting sites, plants, control devices and other objects by the interoperable
    information and communication technology. It can realize the comprehensive sensing,
    reliable transmission, remote storage, real-time display, information sharing
    and intelligent computing of the environmental parameters for plant growth, such
    as light, temperature and humidity. When users leave home, they can view the real-time
    monitoring data at any time through smartphone to provide help about decision-making
    for environmental parameter adjustment. It can automatically or remotely control

    years, while the COVID-19 pandemic affects food supply chains around the world,
    the agriculture sector also has faced many global problems, such as global warming,
    environmental pollution, climate change, and weather disasters. It has known that
    technological opportunities are available for human beings to get out of these

    Conference Location: Coimbatore, India SECTION I. Introduction Mobile devices
    are powerful tools that computes, senses, and provides other connectivity with
    proper resources and Apps are made to run for multiple purposes. The device characteristics
    commonly possess a low-power consumption with high performance processor at, running
    frequencies. This frequency is over 1 GHz, and is of high memory, also contains
    a spacious memory. It contains graphic related touchscreens with highest resolutions.
    These mobile devices does multitasking in the operating system that runs first
    and third-party Apps and it has diverse connectivity. This results in a attractive
    platform developed for different domains with specific applications, these devices
    provide sensing applications with additional external sensors. SECTION II. EMBEDDED
    SYSTEM A. LAYERED DESCRIPTION An embedded system is a printed circuit board that
    includes busses and semiconductors in the lower layer. The upper layer is called
    as the application layer. Between these two layers, another two essential layers
    called the device drivers and communication protocols. The embedded systems are
    relatively static due to these features. However, requirement for low cost, negligible
    electrical/electronic radiation and energy consumption. B. GENERAL DESCRIPTION
    It is an compact component to perform desired function with the hardware and software
    combinations that also includes additional mechanical or technical elements. SECTION
    III. ARDUINO These systems have from 8 bits to 32 bits since a long time. ARDUINO
    is a open-source electronics platform. It is a miniature sized computers that
    can be handled easily in place of computers. This is very useful in projects and
    for many things where desktop PC is used. This is very needful in case where physically
    made to work in extreme temperatures and to resist shocks and vibrations to external
    interferences of electrical and electronic devices. The state of art in cheap,
    consumer single board computers in the beginning. Invariably embedded systems
    are having limited resources of memory in case of CPU, screen size and a limited
    set of key inputs. These features plays a major part in the development of product
    and its design. This is mainly due to the limitations in the resources. Fig. 1.
    Arduino Uno Microcontroller Show All SECTION IV. WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY Wireless
    connectivity reduces power by implementing it on SOC. The IoT refers to the network
    featuring an IP of physical objects that resolves connectivity issues, and does
    provide the communication between the objects without enabling internet and other
    internet-enabled objects. SECTION V. INTERNET OF THINGS There has been a much
    hype about the \"Internet of Things\". This an general idea of a globally interconnected
    continuum of objects and devices that has emerged with the RFID technology. This
    envisages a excess of objects interacting with the environment. There are a large
    number of different means are used to enable communication between devices. They
    are somewhat external that represent vertical silos that do not support on all
    basis of operational ability. Obviously this leads to the slowing down of devices.
    They just provide a scalability requirement that are envisioned as foundations
    for fostering the emerging Internet of Things. Overall it is a design and architectural
    principle for prototyping and exploring the technical consequences of the desired
    project. SECTION VI. LITERATURE SURVEY A. RANGING AND IMAGINING Agricultural vision
    is to produce the maximum yield of goods by 2050. This vision is more concentrated
    to meet the expectations of fast growing population and their major demands for
    food. Thus by proper usage of resources Precision agriculture becomes the key
    to productivity and efficiency improvisation. Thus helping to face the diverse
    agricultural challenges. To face these challenges, they mainly focus on to climate
    changes, land degradation, availability of farmable land, labor force shortage
    and increasing costs. This presents a statistical report of the optical visible
    and near-visible spectrum sensors. These techniques are made to estimate phenol-typing
    intensity and spectral with cubic volumetric measurements. The sensing methodologies:
    (i) Plant structures and its characters (ii) Detection of Plants and Fruits (iii)Assessment
    of Plant Physiology. This provides data processing methods and thus faces the
    current challenges that are oprn in agriculture in which there is a creative development
    of sensing methodologies of pruning, harvesting and automated monitoring. B. FIELD
    MONITORING AND AUTOMATION It is an Agricultural Frameworks that makes decisions
    that are Profitable through the framing cycle.. This includes real time information
    that is gathered from various places such as level of production with the available
    crop knowledge. It gets automated replacement of manual procedures, since it is
    efficient in managing energy and hence minimal man power is engrossed. This proposes
    advancement in ICT in Indian Agricultural sector, to replace some of the convectional
    methods. It overcomes the limitations of traditional agricultural methods by low
    power consumption and efficient use of water resources. C. IOT BASED SMART IRRIGATION
    SYSTEM The farm activities with the desired automation has become the major transformation
    of agricultural domain from being manual and static to intelligent and dynamic.
    This is a way to reduce human supervision. It is an automated irrigation system
    which keeps a continuous monitoring over the entire field. This in-turn maintains
    the soil moisture level via automatic pumping of water. The devices enables the
    system with the appropriate quantity of water. This is designed using the ARDUINO
    UNO platform with a help of few sensors to avoid over or under irrigation. The
    information of the sensors is kept updated to the farmers with help of IoT. D.
    SMART IRRIGATION SYSTEM This project is from the idea of farmers who solely depend
    on the nature for earn food for their livelihood. This idea is based on the rains
    and bore wells for irrigation of the cultivated land areas. The farmers have been
    using the irrigation techniques through the manual control in which to irrigate
    the land at regular intervals. This is done by turning the motor ON/OFF when required.
    For indicating the power they have been provided with a glowing blub. If a phase
    deduction occurs in any other phases, the farmer will not be able to know the
    low supply of power. So obviously, this can cause a sudden diffuse in the motor
    circuit. They have to travel a longer distance for the SWITCHING of the motor.
    SECTION VII. SENSING FOR DETECTION To improvise the agriculture by precision agriculture
    aiming to provide precise measuring and monitoring. To overcome the issues concerned
    with agriculture to provide sustainable agriculture to increase the productivity
    of the crops. To provide ease of access through updated automation techniques
    by saving time and meeting the demands immediately. To get an overall information
    of the entire field by combining various modalities using cloud computing with
    IoT. Ease of billing systems saving human labor and considerable amount of time
    and provides remote access to the field. An efficient water management system
    results in increased profitability and reduced environmental impacts. SECTION
    VIII. FEATURES The proposed idea has various features in it which are meant to
    monitor the agricultural field and aims at the following Precision agriculture
    for accurate measuring and monitoring. Monitoring the Crop Growth and proper selection
    of the Crop. Water–Capital Measurements and Making profitable decisions . Optimization
    and maximization of yield with usage of water and fertilizers. Analyzing the weather
    conditions. IOT enables PA with cloud computing to collect the relevant data is
    posted on the cloud. IR Fencing for the animal and unauthorized human intervention
    with the appropriate knowledge. It is monitored using a web application. Ease
    of access to the field. Farmer friendly product. SECTION IX. BLOCK DIAGRAM Fig.
    2. Block Diagram Show All SECTION X. SOIL MOISTURE SENSOR The volumetric content
    of water is measured by the soil based moisture level sensor. It measures the
    water by using properties such as resistance to electrical interface, constant
    of dielectric, or by the neutron interaction. The difference between the measured
    data and the standard data is calibrated. There are variations that depends on
    the factors of the environment. Water potentiometers and even tensiometers based
    on the soil are used. The soil moisture sensors consists of anode and cathode
    that senses the proxy of water content in the soil and it in-turn is set up with
    a threshold value and it is connected to an A/D sensor to post the digital values
    to the controller. This is connected with a motor for letting in the water into
    the field. This usually connected to a relay which is given a separate power supply
    of 12V. Fig. 3. Soil Moisture Sensor for Moisture Detection Show All SECTION XI.
    PUMP MOTOR The pump motor is based on the simple electromagnetism. A current-carrying
    conductor generates a magnetic field and this in turn will experience a force
    proportional to the current. This force turns the blades of the motor. Here it
    is actually attached with the soil moisture sensor and once the moisture level
    in the soil is low then the motor is initiated with the power supply by a Relay,
    which actually acts as a switch providing the power to the motor. This action
    turns on the motor and after the desired level of the moisture as designed is
    reached it is turned off automatically. Fig. 4. Pump Motor for Water inlet into
    the Field Show All SECTION XII. TEMPERATURE SENSOR There are a series of temperature
    sensor, here the proposed project uses a LM35. The LM35 is a analog temperature
    sensor. This is built with a series of integrated circuits that senses the surrounding
    temperature of the field in degree Celsius. This is given to the analog pin of
    the controller for continuous monitoring. Fig. 5. Temperature Sensor LM35 Show
    All SECTION XIII. ESP8266 The ESP8266 is the Wi-Fi module is a self-contained
    solution that provides networking. It has a external flash memory for boot up
    process. It acts either as a host or offloads the other host applications. Here
    the ESP8266 is used to store the relevant information such as the temperature,
    moisture detection and IR detection onto the memory and serves to post this on
    the cloud server for the ease of access. It has 16 GPIO pins, and its memory is
    about 32KiB RAM. Fig. 6. Wi-Fi Module for establishing Server Connection Show
    All SECTION XIV. IR SENSOR The IR is Infra-Red Sensor that is usually positioned
    with a arrangement of two sensors. One acts as the receiver and the other acts
    as a transmitter and there will continuous signal radiation passing between these
    sensors. Once the signal between them is disconnected or intervened by an obstacle
    such as human or animal then it gives a alert message to the user of the field.
    Fig. 7. IR Sensor for Animal and Human Intervention Show All SECTION XV. CONCLUSION
    The controller is interfaced with the soil moisture sensor and a pump motor, the
    sensor is programmed in such away to detect the soil moisture content. The threshold
    is set for the moisture level sensor. A Pump motor with a tube inlet has been
    interfaced with the controller. Here the soil moisture sensor detects the moisture
    level and automatically turns the motor ON/OFF. The temperature displays the accurate
    temperature in degree/Celsius and the IR sensor is mainly used for the security
    purposes. To give a alert or warning message to those who have enter the field

    Cloud computing 1 Introduction The advances in science and technology and the
    high qualification of human capital have allowed a sustainable growth of the world
    economy [1,2,3]. This fact has resulted in the emergence of the smart farming
    approach which allows farmers to remotely monitor the crop field by means of sensors
    as well as to have automatic irrigation systems [4]. There are computer applications
    based on sensors that allow obtaining more accurate information about the crop,
    soil, and climate than those obtained by means of traditional methods. This feature
    helps to improve the quality of the products, processes and raw materials used
    in this process. Because of these facts, IoT-based smart agriculture is more efficient
    than traditional approaches [5]. Furthermore, the IoT-based smart agriculture
    applications could boost organic agricultural agriculture and family farming [6].
    The digital breach between agricultural producers and IoT technologies [7] has
    reduced. In the future, these technologies will allow improving productivity through
    the sustainable cultivation of food, as well as to take care of the environment
    thanks to the efficient use of water and the optimization of inputs and treatments
    [8]. Smart agriculture includes activities such as remote monitoring, decision
    support tools, automated irrigation systems, frost protection, fertilization,
    among others. These activities are supported by IoT technologies such as hardware
    [9, 10], intelligent software [11], integration platforms [12], monitoring processes
    [13, 14], operating systems, and cloud computing [15]. The Cloud of Things [16],
    which is the integration of IoT and cloud computing, can help achieve the objectives
    of the IoT and the Internet [17]. Furthermore, the IoT must help society to have
    information transparency [18, 19]. This work presents a systematic literature
    review of IoT-based tools and applications for agriculture. The objective of this
    paper is to offer an overview of these areas through topics such as IoT-based
    software applications for agriculture available in the market, IoT-based devices
    used in the agriculture, as well as the benefits provided by these technologies.
    2 IoT Applications in Agriculture This section describes the literature review
    process followed in this work which is composed of three steps: question formulation,
    search strategy, and studies selection. This review analyzes research efforts
    and projects related to the application of IoT technologies to the field of agriculture
    aiming to provide guidelines for the use of these technologies in urban agriculture,
    precision agriculture and industrial agriculture. 2.1 Research Questions The research
    questions that guided this work, as well as their motivation, are presented in
    Table 1. Table 1. Research questions Full size table 2.2 Search Strategy We identified
    the digital libraries wherein the search for primary studies was performed: IEEE
    CS, Elsevier, ACM Digital Library, and ScienceDirect. Then, we identified a set
    of keywords related to our research topic: environment, apps, devices, IoT, Internet
    of Things, Intelligent agriculture, cloud in the agriculture, and analytics data
    in the agriculture. Finally, the search string was built by combining the aforementioned
    keywords with the connectors “AND” and “OR”. Thus, the search chain that we use
    is presented in Table 2. Table 2. Keywords and data sources used in this literature
    review Full size table 2.3 Studies Selection The studies selection process consisted
    of executing the search for studies in the digital libraries considering the search
    string as well as some inclusion and exclusion criteria. Specifically, this process
    consisted of four phases which are described below. Also, Table 2 presents a summary
    of the studies selection phases performed in this work. 1. This phase consisted
    of executing the search for studies by using the search string presented in Table
    2. Furthermore, we apply the following exclusion criteria: (1) papers written
    in English, and (2) papers published in the period of 2011–2018. The result of
    this phase was a set of 2514 studies. 2. Secondly, we discarded those papers whose
    title was not directly related to the IoT technology and the agricultural sector.
    The result of this phase was a set of 2148 studies. 3. Thirdly, the set of papers
    obtained in the previous phase was reduced by discarding those papers whose abstract
    was not directly related to the IoT technology and the agricultural sector. The
    result of this phase was a set of 509 studies. 4. Finally, in cases where we were
    uncertain about the relevance of the paper, the full-paper was downloaded and
    sections such as introduction and conclusions were analyzed. The objective of
    this phase was to determine which piece of literature provide important contributions
    to the agricultural sector. The result of this phase was a set of 60 studies.
    3 Information Extraction This section provides a general perspective of all studies
    selected aiming to answer the research questions established at the beginning
    of this work. 3.1 IoT Applications in Agriculture The main applications of IoT
    technologies in agriculture are found in precision agriculture [20, 21] whose
    architecture includes IoT techniques for urban agriculture and precision agronomy
    in smart cities. Commonly, smart cities are based on networks defined by software
    (SDN) and cyber-physical systems [22]. Other applications of the IoT are the agricultural
    drones [23] which are relatively cheap drones with advanced sensors that give
    farmers new ways to increase yields and reduce crop damage, among other things.
    Another area of IoT application is the intelligent greenhouses [24, 25] which
    includes hydroponic and small-scale aquaponic systems [26,27,28]. Intelligent
    greenhouses are increasingly common in urban areas because they allow monitoring
    several parameters of nutrient solutions [29], as well as to improve the growth,
    yield, and quality of plants. These improvements contribute significantly to the
    achievement of smart cities with infrastructures that allow automating, optimizing
    and improving urban agriculture and precision agronomy. Another area in which
    IoT technologies are applied is the vertical agriculture [30], which allows controlling
    soil moisture and water content by means of computers or mobile devices such as
    tablets and smartphones. Finally, there are applications that combine IoT technologies
    with Artificial Intelligence such as Malthouse [31], which is an Artificial Intelligence
    system that allows prescribing configurations and schedules in precision farming
    and food manufacturing areas. 3.2 IoT-Based Devices Used in Agriculture IoT-based
    devices have been adopted by many industries and markets around the world. One
    of these industries is agriculture, which benefits from IoT technologies in a
    myriad of ways. For example, LoRa is a widely used network radio in Indiana because
    of its advantages such as long range, low power consumption, and its low-cost
    investment [32, 33]. Another example of the use of IoT-based devices is the use
    of cameras [34, 35] to verify the quality of food [36]. On the other hand, there
    are approaches that combine cloud computing with wireless sensor networks to offer
    a service (AaaS, Agriculture-as-a-Service) that allows managing agricultural information
    through Big Data technologies [37]. For example, the Phytec company offers the
    PlanIoT platform that is capable of automatically detecting plant status changes,
    analyzing information, and generating recommendations. 3.3 IoT-Based Software
    Applications Used in Agriculture IoT-based technologies have been successfully
    adopted in different contexts. Due to this fact, several companies are investing
    in IoT-based software development for agriculture. Nowadays, there are several
    software products available in the market focused on supporting different agricultural
    processes. For instance, AG-IoT [23] is an unmanned aerial vehicle that locates
    and assists IoT-based devices available on the ground to form groups for the transmission
    of data. On the other hand, Agro 4.0 [38] implements high-performance computational
    methods, a sensors network, connectivity between mobile devices, cloud computing,
    and analytical methods to process large volumes of data and provide decision support
    systems. Agro-Tech [39] records, stores, and updates the data obtained from various
    sensors available in a specific area of the crop. Also, this software allows farmers
    to access this information aiming to monitor their crop. Malthouse [31] is an
    Artificial Intelligence system that allows prescribing configurations and schedules
    in precision farming and food manufacturing areas. There are agricultural monitoring
    systems that transmit live video to carry out such process remotely through IoT-based
    devices that integrate cameras and Raspberry Pi cards [35, 40]. On the other hand,
    Cropx is an adaptive irrigation software tool that allows farmers to increase
    crop yields at the lowest cost possible, as well as saving water and energy. Farmlogs
    is a farm management software that allows registering activities related to the
    conservation of crop through images. Finally, MbeguChoice is an application that
    allows farmers to select the best drought tolerant seed suppliers. 3.4 Benefits
    of IoT in Agriculture The main benefits of IoT in agriculture identified in this
    literature review are briefly described below. Community agriculture in urban
    and rural areas taking advantage of hardware and software resources and large
    amounts of data. Logistic and qualitative traceability of food production that
    allows reducing costs and the waste of inputs through the use of real-time data
    for decision making. Generation of business models [31] in the agricultural context
    that allow establishing a direct relationship with the consumer. Crop monitoring
    that allows reducing costs as well as the theft of machinery. Automatic irrigation
    systems [41] that work according to temperature, humidity, and soil moisture values
    that are obtained through sensors. Automatic collection of environmental parameters
    through sensor networks for further processing and analysis. Decision support
    systems that analyze large amounts of data to improve operational efficiency and
    productivity [42, 43]. 4 Discussion Table 3 shows a summary of the studies selected
    in this work. As can be seen, 21 articles address the application of IoT technologies
    in agriculture. 12 of the selected studies address the use of IoT-based devices
    in agriculture [44]. Some of the most common devices used in this context are
    optical sensors to measure soil properties, photodiodes and photodetectors to
    determine the soil, organic matter, and soil moisture, moisture sensors to measure
    the amount of water in the soil, and geo-positioning devices to determine latitude,
    length, and altitude. It is worth mentioning that geo-positioning devices are
    an important element in precision agriculture [45]. Other IoT-based devices widely
    used in the agricultural context are cameras and wireless networks [32], which
    are used for the development of platforms for obtaining and analyzing information.
    On the other hand, some of the most outstanding software tools identified in this
    work are a support system for renewable energy projects, systems focused on resources
    and ecological techniques, decision support systems for precision agriculture
    [46, 47], systems based on wireless sensor networks [39], and intelligent systems
    for vertical agriculture [12] (Table 4). Table 3. Studies selection Full size
    table Table 4. Summary of selected studies Full size table 5 Conclusions IoT technologies
    allow, among other things, to obtain information on climate, humidity, temperature,
    soil fertility in order to efficiently carry out remote monitoring of crops. Thanks
    to these technologies, farmers can know the status of their crop at any time and
    from any place. On the other hand, wireless sensor networks allow controlling
    the conditions of the farm, as well as automate different processes. For example,
    some of the studies analyzed in this work use wireless cameras to know the status
    of the crop in real time. Other studies have employed drones to support the tasks
    of precision agriculture, as well as smartphones to keep farmers informed about
    the current conditions of their cultivation. Some of the most outstanding technologies
    that are combined with IoT to develop agricultural solutions are wireless sensor
    networks, cloud computing, middleware systems, and mobile applications [48, 49].
    IoT technologies are already an essential part of solving different problems in
    the agricultural context. For this reason, in this work, we performed a literature
    review aiming to identify the main IoT applications in agriculture, IoT-based
    software and devices used in agriculture, as well as the benefits provided by
    this kind of technologies. Although the topics addressed in this work are very
    important for all people involved in agriculture, it is important to mention the
    need for analyzing more research works carried out around the resolution of environmental
    problems aiming to achieve a sustainable cultivation of food. References Gómez-Chabla,

    Conference Location: Sangamner, India SECTION I. Introduction The utilization
    of natural wealth is nowadays an important challenge for considering the expected
    increase of the population. Over the past decades, the impulsive misuse of natural
    capital has induced global consequences on the world ecosystem like the greenhouse
    reactions and the consequent global warming occurrences, which have raised serious
    trouble about the utility of resources for the next generations. The increasing
    population is an additional emergent threat to the global ecosystem, which is
    considered to reach 8.5 billion by 2030 (United Nations, 2015), with a related
    increasing demand on natural resources. To respond to this the concept of green
    saving has been introduced to earn a good balance linking the feasibility and
    the productivity of crops by expanding the ability of farming performance. There
    are various types of techniques presented which give the solution for productive
    use of greenhouse automation. The most appropriate state for the vegetation of
    crops and to prevent from the obstruction of pest development achieved properly
    through analyzing conditions of greenhouse. On such conditions, several inventive
    control methods for greenhouse automation have been lately proposed. The majority
    of the procedures are developed on optimization methods like genetic algorithms,
    adaptive control, predictive control, zigbee [3] nonlinear feedback control, robust
    and fuzzy control, moreover using IOT [1], wireless sensor network, various protocols
    like routing protocol [6], binary algorithm [5] and automated scheduling [4].
    On employing these techniques it will increase sustainability of the system. Such
    as high efficiency and intelligence, possible to implement widely, easy usage
    and cheap solution, requires cautious and complete organization, low power usage
    and multifunctioning sensor nodes [3], Can work without individual intervention
    [4], Flexible, energy efficient, efficient networking and scalability, energy-efficient
    routing protocol overall optimization work is built on the residual energy and
    transmission power [6]. In unfavorable conditions the efficiency will reduce significantly
    due to complexity in designing and overall realization of system, needs human
    intervention [1], By implementing a suitable cost models the potential economic
    benefit could be properly quantified [2], For efficient transmissions of data,
    the nodes should be placed properly [3], Need to enlarge a multi-hop network inside
    the greenhouse, Energy reduction is most severe issues, A trade-off Between time
    delay and energy harvesting. A more Sufficient algorithm required [6]. Hence in
    majority of the system the most common problem is related to the database collection
    and limited space for storage due to its centralized hardware system. Hence to
    safeguard these natural resources and make their utility possible for the upcoming
    generations certain effective measures needs to be initiated. In order to respond
    to these criticalities the implementation of decision support system could be
    a fruitful solution. The decision-making is an electronic climate-control systems
    rather than simplifying and supervising data enrolled in précised agriculture
    and this DSS system can easily generate large data with composite relations. To
    organize all the factors and their interactions, suitable data handling procedures
    and decision tools must be implemented. As there is a need for further improvements
    in existing system and this improvement can be achieved by one of the most promising
    techniques i.e. Decision Support System (DSS). SECTION II. Literature Review The
    equivalent work of greenhouse automation is explained in this section. There are
    various types of techniques which gives the solution for productive use of greenhouse
    automation. The most appropriate state for the vegetation of crops and to prevent
    from the obstruction of pest development can be achieved properly through analysis
    the conditions surrounding the system in greenhouse. On such conditions, several
    inventive control methods for greenhouse automation have been lately proposed.
    The majority of the procedures are developed. Zhaochan Li1, et.al [1] proposed
    System designing for Agricultural Greenhouses which is developed on the Internet
    of Things. The concept of the Agricultural IOT used in the paper which makes productive
    use of networking technology in agricultural production, the hardware part consist
    of temperature, light sensors and processors with a large data processing capability.
    Limitation is the hard designing and overall realization of system requires human
    intervention. Prof. Giuseppe Aiello, et.al [2] proposed A Decision System built
    on multi sensor information fusion for greenhouse management. The paper involve
    expert''s knowledge and complex mathematical calculations on environmental data,
    hence helping managers in taking correct decisions, simple use and inexpensive
    requires protective and exact organization. Retrieving information may result
    troublesome for the target users. G. Sahitya, et.al [3] approached developing
    a Wireless Network for Agriculture Using Zigbee. The system which is emerged is
    used for precision agriculture. Precision agriculture constitutes of applying
    right inputs at the accurate time to obtain more cultivation with less power and
    work. Damages or malfunctioning of a sole node doesn''t affect the whole network.
    Ahmad Ashraf Abdul Halim, et.al [4] Greenhouse Managing System using Automated
    Scheduling depending on Plant Growth. This research contains the application of
    optimizing scheduler for constant monitoring and management on each step of crop
    cycle. It can operate without any individual intervention. Need to generate a
    multi-hop network linking the nodes inside the greenhouse. Migdat Hodzic, et.al
    [5] approached Wireless Networks using Binary Algorithm for Energy saving. The
    paper focuses to minimize number of sensors participating in object tracking to
    enlarge the network lifespan. Layered architecture is needed. Energy saving is
    the key issue. Yifeng Cao, et.al [6] proposed Energy Harvest using Routing Protocol
    for Sensor Networks. It aims on developing a protocol, called as energy harvesting
    routing (EHR). This protocol takes energy harvesting as prime factor for enhancing
    the energy efficiency. A more sufficient algorithm required. Sonam Maurya, et.al
    [7] proposed Threshold Sensitive hybrid Region-Based Routing Protocol. This protocol
    utilizes region-based static clustering approach to provide efficient coverage
    of agricultural area. For transmitting sensed data to base station the fuzzy routing
    approach is used which reduce the energy consumption of nodes. The results show
    that proposed protocol has a remarkable increase in network lifetime. Marwa Mekki2,
    et.al [8] proposed Wireless Network for Greenhouse supervising and commanding.
    An actuator is responsible for controlling the parameters. Change is detected
    the alarm inside green house is raised. This asset allows the farmer to upgrade
    the cultivation in a way the plants need. Vo Que Son, et.al [9] Context-aware
    system using Fuzzy Logic for Sensor Networks. The proposed system presents a context-aware
    supervising which is flexible and it is established on fuzzy logic. Considering
    the environment changes fuzzy logic can examine and permits the required actions
    for logistics. It is more advanced and can be able to maximize the lifespan of
    networks. Collaboration between nodes can be complicate. Table I: Comparative
    analysis of techniques Table II: Parametric comparison SECTION III. Decision Support
    System A. DSS Structure The majority of the techniques used have certain limitations
    as Sahitya; et.al [3] proposed precision agriculture by implementing Zigbee. In
    this method for efficient transmissions of data, the nodes should be placed properly.
    Vo Que Son, et.al [9] proposed Context-aware Monitoring Model using Fuzzy Logic
    for Wireless Sensor Networks in Logistics in this the collaboration between nodes
    can be complicated. Zhaochan Li1, et.al [1] proposed Design of an Intelligent
    Management System for Agricultural Greenhouses based on The Internet of Things
    has hard designing and whole system, needs human intervention. As a result this
    DSS approach aims to propose a low budget and inclusive mechanized irrigation
    set-up constructed on wireless sensors for system controlling and remote monitoring.
    The systems constitute the understanding about the application domain and implement
    techniques that direct the user to take the most favorable decisions. Among the
    various techniques to represent the knowledge, two standards proceed towards “case
    based” and “rules based”. A manageable rule based system is utilized, to recommend
    the solution of the problem on the procedure of assembling of data from the sensor
    network. Eventually this technique known as multi sensor data fusion enables taking
    a general conclusion on the complete system. This segment constitutes an inventive
    offering to the present state of the art. A rule-based system could be a successful
    solution to conquer difficulties, because they involve expert''s knowledge and
    precise detailing on contextual data, hence helping managers in taking more precise
    decisions in the complete greenhouse production, and observational validation
    build on real data. This sensor unit used in the greenhouse estimates humidity,
    light, temperature, soil, moisture etc. with their relative standards. By comparing
    the differences between positional points of sensors, profound segments in greenhouse
    are being conditioned. At present the key issues are cost-saving technology, labor-saving.
    To establish a DSS in the determined manner to get intensive production a methodological
    strategy built on real data will be an effective solution. According to such configuration,
    by surveying the atmosphere in the greenhouse and creating proper alert thresholds,
    it is feasible to trigger control actions. The producers make suitable technical
    choices, with corrective actions when values exceed certain critical thresholds
    which are highly precise, accurate and demands less power by proposing Decisions
    Support System Figure 1 displays structural diagram of Proposed DSS system. It
    uses the nodes N1, N2, N3 for gathering the greenhouse related parameters at separate
    locations inside greenhouse. Sensing node units calculate parameters with several
    sensor segments including light, soil moisture, humidity, and temperature. The
    nodes are self-reliant embedded system units. Fig. 1: DSS structure Show All The
    method applied to the content gathered by sensor networks is rule-based which
    is established on mathematical models. This is a good procedure to avoid that
    unreliable data emerging from faulty sensors which could lead to invalid decisions.
    To make a more valid opinion of the environment towards sensor based decision
    making which marks the issue of how to fuse data from various sensors. Hence the
    outlook could be adapting multi sensor data fusion. The monitoring system installed
    is constituted by PIC micro controller for temperature/humidity sensors communicating
    with the fundamental station through RF Trans receiver. To obtain more reliable
    judgment the proposed system includes a data fusion algorithm to process the information
    from the complete sensor network. For such motive, each node section carries its
    own information to a decision fusion center, which makes the final choice. The
    same information could be further communicated through internet using cloud computing.
    B. Flowchart As shown in figure. 2 it contains the work flow of DSS. First initialize
    IO pins of the controller, initialize ADC for selecting the channels. Connect
    the raspberry pi controller to the Wi-Fi router. After connecting start the android
    application and connect it to Wi-Fi router. Then press start button of android
    application to start communication. The controller reads the ADC and digital data.
    After reading those values it displays the values on android application. Then
    the DSS decides one threshold point comparing all the data obtained by reading
    the values. Accordingly the respective output device is turned on or the required
    decision is taken and displayed on our android application. In case if any of
    the parameter fails to achieve the decided threshold then current step gets in
    a loop and it continuously keeps reading and analyzing the data unless it match
    the threshold. Finally the stop button is pressed to stop the analysis or reading
    of data. Fig 2: DSS flowchart Show All SECTION III. Result and Discusion As discussed
    in above section it contains some demerits occurred while doing communication
    through IoT without human interventions. Thus the recommended system will be reliable
    in all situations i.e. to supervise and command the greenhouse parameters through
    cloud technology from any place in the world. This system approaches an execution
    of the decision binding algorithm which allows taking the decisions regarding
    the possible risk of pest disease established on the data gathered through all
    the sensors of the network. In particular, every node provides a prior alert to
    the decision center by a threshold built decision rule. Lastly, the overall decision
    is estimated by combining the inputs from all sensors by considering a majority
    rule. Further, through mobile android app which gives a pleasant experience to
    user, a path for the greenhouse supervision and ruling across the globe. The user
    perform the proper operation on actual time environment & and gets the results
    as per user requirements. Thus, need to overcome the old technologies through
    the mobile android app and also using a cloud technology in real world is the
    scope of future work. SECTION IV. Conclusion As per the literature survey done,
    it is analyzed that there is necessity for upgrading the greenhouse automation
    in all regards. As the traditional techniques have limitations like collaboration
    between nodes can be complicated besides false alarming, lack in making decision
    and are not a proper solution for the greenhouse supervising and controlling.
    Thus there is a demand to work on a system which may be used to expand the hours
    of time to market, produce good quality of product and increase the productivity.
    Proposed method shows the integrating relays to Raspberry Pi unit for controlling
    greenhouse from a remote location in a physical scenario. To develop the IoT framework
    and use cloud computing infrastructure for connecting and also store sensor data.
    Using IoT it allows cellular devices and computers to smoothly direct all the
    functions and features of greenhouse from anywhere via internet connection. Authors

    Coimbatore, India SECTION I. Introduction(Heading 1) India''s major source of
    income is from agriculture sector and 70% of farmers and general people depend
    on the agriculture [16]. Indian irrigation system the famers are chosen most of
    the methods manually such as drip, terraced, ditch irrigation system of them [1]–[5].
    In order to improve to the crop productivity there is an urgent need to change
    manual method to automation[6]. Also consider the water availability throughout
    India it is one of the valuable resources to protect and save for future needs.
    Embedded based automatic irrigation system is suitable for farmers available at
    low cost easily install[7]. This system should help to the farmer that provides
    the water to crop at stringent time and quantity. Automation irrigation system
    observes the moisture sensors and temperature variations of around the crop area
    that''s gives a precise time of operation the motor turn ON and OFF. So Automatic
    human avoid the human errors and check soil moisture level[8], [9]. Internet of
    things (IOT) is allowing controls the systems from remote area over an internet.
    It can controls the sensors which are used at various areas at blinding roads
    railways grids and water control systems. So it can avoid the human errors and
    errors appear during system operated[11]. IOT is the emerging area that penetrates
    other area and made them so efficient. It develop now a days by inclusion of new
    sensors, sensor network, RF based communications[17], [18]. It can exhibits smart
    intelligence, precise sensing along with good identification. Once added cloud
    computing with IOT a changes has occurred in computer network base technologies
    and mobile based technology. Now days other networks are 3G, LTE, GSM, WLAN, WPAN,
    WiMax, RFID, Zigbee, NFC, Bluetooth that develops Iso smart system and operate
    system at remote places[12], [13]. The principle of cloud computing for IOT is
    shown in below fig:l. Figure1 The principle of cloud computing for Iot Show All
    SECTION II. Background S. Muthunpandian et.al [1] has given an automated system
    has been designed and implemented on for crop field monitoring continuously. The
    system maintains the water levels in the crop field at power consumption in the

    et.al [2] showed automated irrigation system that reduces the water resources
    more effective by considering the timing of water scarcity. They shown water utilization
    is minimized and incorporated a solar power system to reduce power consumption.
    This was developed by smart phone operating by considering the sensors data via

    The system contains ATMEL microcontroller based GSM operated sensors are used

    SECTION III. Hardware Description Raspberry Pi 3-Model The Raspberry Pi 3 Model
    B is an upgraded ARMv7 multi core processor and Gigabytes of RAM, this seems to
    be a pocket computer and able to moved from being a ‘toy computer’ to a real desktop
    PC requirements. The figure:2 shows the circuit board diagram of raspberry Pi.
    The big upgrade is a move from the BCM2836 (single core ARMv6) to BCM2837 (quad
    core ARMv7). The Processor speed increases 2 times that is equal to multi core
    processors. By efficiently using architecture the speed may increases from 4 to
    7.5 times. This processor improves the quantity performance web browsing and game
    playing. The Pi 3 will run the all other daughter boards at 99 % efficiency[4].
    Figure 2 Raspberry pi 3 model b Show All Pi 3 works on ‘sudo apt-upgrade’. Pi
    3 is a quad core 64-bit CPU and on-board WiFi and Bluetooth. The RAM remains 1GB
    and there is no change to the USB or Ethernet ports. However, the upgraded power
    management should mean the Pi 3 can make use of more power hungry USB devices
    [11], [12]. Software Used Python is widely used programming languages for Raspberry
    pi computer. The main advantage is programmer can write low number of codes that
    might be considered other types programming languages. Examples C++ or JAVA at
    large scale programming modules. Python is not a web programming language but
    works also like a PHP code cold FUSION and comfortable for server programming
    languages. Python uses a customer frustrating issues[4]. Power Supply All digital
    circuits require regulated power supply. In this article we are going to learn
    how to get a regulated positive supply from the mains supply. Figure3 Power supply

    system the historical data regarding the quantity of irrigation used in previous
    period are considered to adjust the quantity of water that is needed for irrigation.

    the data will be collected from that sensors these data in the form of analog
    values, so that analog value is given to the IC3208 that converts analog values
    in to 12 bit digital values, the digital values are given input to the Raspberry-pi
    that data sends to the database by using wifi, the sensors calibrated so that
    the minimum wet condition in the field 2.4v is taken, The threshold voltage is
    varied according with different crop field in different seasons. In that 2.4v,
    according that threshold voltage the Raspberry-pi operated the relay, relay is
    also placed on that, when the data comes from the controller is that value is
    compare with 2.4v, when the value is less than 2.4volts so the field is dry conditions
    then signal send to the motor on, when the value is greater than 2.4 volts when
    the field is wet conditions. The temperature variation is calculated through another
    temperature sensor, by considering the calibrating value and these sensors data
    are correlated at every instant time then accurate level of soil dry is measured.
    So that the signal send to the motor off automatically a buzzer is indicates change
    the condition when motor is “off state to on state” and “on state to off state”.

    by farmer through his mobile/ PC. The system accurate values which actually occur
    from the system are observed by farmer; with his intervention at his crop fields
    the irrigation ran automatically. Micro controller processed and correlated huge
    data obtained from the sensors checks at every time to the threshold values. Here
    calibration of the sensors system is so important. The system displays temperature
    value and condition of soil moisture, based on the two sensors the condition of
    motor. The status of the system can able to check at remote place and complexity
    of the system is less so we can do trouble shooting easily in firmware. Fig. 13

    All SECTION VI Conclusions A PA agriculture irrigation system is developed with
    low complex circuitry. A two sensors are used efficiently those are temperature
    and moisture of soil in the circuit to get the calibrated information to the system.
    Two sensors and Raspberry pi microcontrollers of all three Nodes are successfully
    interfaced various Nodes. All observations and experimental tests proves that
    proposed is a complete solution to field activities, irrigation problems, Implementation
    of such a system in the field can definitely help to improve the field of the
    crops and overall production. With the help of this approach the irrigation system
    completely automated also provides real-time information about the lands and crops
    that will help farmers make right decisions. Cloud computing is “a new style of
    computing in which dynamically scalable and often virtualized resources are provided
    as a service over the Internet”. Here two sensors are used to control the irrigation
    system so the troubleshooting easily done whenever it necessary. Here proposed
    correlated data based algorithm reduce the hardware complexity compare to the
    other proposed systems [13]. The threshold voltages are chosen for calibration
    of the sensors by considering past months of temperature and soil moisture values.
    Threshold values may be varying depends on the crop and plantation. In future
    by introduce the machine learning algorithm to be used to process the data and
    reduce the complexity of the hardware. Hardware resources in agricultural information
    network are integrated into resource pool by using vitalization technology, achieving
    dynamic distribution of resource and balance of load, significantly improve efficiency.

    Location: Marrakech, Morocco SECTION I. Introduction The demand of food production
    and fiber increase with de world population. The irrigation management is important
    particularly in context where the fresh water resources are limited. The aim of
    the irrigation is to give to plants the adequate amount of water to ensure their
    water requirements. The use of Water Production Function (WPF) allows to estimate
    the production in terms of dry matter or marketable yield, evapotranspiration
    ore the amount of applied water during irrigation (IW). According to the different
    production functions of IW may also include different components in addition to
    Crop Water Requirement (CWR), such as pre-planting irrigation to prepare the seeding,
    leaching requirement to decrease the salinity, rise of water table by capillarity
    and rainfall. The estimation of water requirement is a stone corner which you
    can calculate the correct irrigation doses. Indeed, the water available for the
    crop is an indicator of the texture of soil, precipitations, previous irrigations,
    state of development of crop and the amount of water already present in the soil.
    Center-Pivot of irrigation are usually reserved to irrigate large areas from 3.5
    to 65 ha because of the costs; but, the nutrients, fertilizer, herbicide, insecticide
    and pesticide can be directly applied on the canopy of crop [1]. Center-Pivot
    irrigation systems require up to 40% less water application than traditional and
    conventional gravity (furrow) or surface irrigation methods, where a part of water
    is lost by percolation or runoff. But Center-pivot irrigation stays less effective
    than the drip systems that are the most economical in term of water. The main
    challenge is related to the exact estimation of both the evapotranspiration of
    the crop and how to bring the water (frequency and quantity). Traditional hand-feel
    soil measurement methods do not provide quantitative soil water and real-time
    data. The use of sensors in precision agriculture is becoming widespread, especially
    in irrigation and open the field of irrigation management in order to establish
    an optimal timing and amount of irrigation water for greatest effectiveness. Indeed,
    an optimal irrigation management avoid water deficiency and use too much water
    that reduces the potential for profitability of the crop. The supply of an optimal
    amount of water allows also to maximize the yield response to other management
    practices, optimize yield per unit of water applied, reduce the potential runoff,
    reduce soil erosion and pesticide movement into the surface and ground water [1].
    To optimize the yield and soil water in the crop, plants should not pass the wilting
    point. This means the minimum soil moisture required by a plant not to wilt. At
    this point, any decrease in soil moisture will result in wilting. When a plant
    wilts, its leaves dry out, droop, and wither. The coupling of the irrigation system
    with a soil moisture monitoring and an accurate evapotranspiration calculation
    has a significant advantage in term of water consumption. Precision agriculture
    (PA) uses the Internet of Things and allows real-time control measure and automation
    of pivot-center irrigation systems. Furthermore, Wireless Sensors Network (WSN)
    is affordable and the wide availability of Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) protocol
    such as LoRa, SigFox and Ingenu coupling with cloud IoT platforms pave the way
    of high precision and realtime irrigation management systems. In this paper, we
    combine agronomic and computer science expertise to propose a cloud IoT architecture
    and a network of sensors using LPWA to control, monitor and optimize the crop
    production at quasi real-time. The low-cost sensor network measure on one hand
    the weather data required to calculate potential evapotranspiration of the crop,
    and on other hand the soil moisture at different depths. The proposed architecture
    calculates water requirements of plants and actuate solenoids to open and close
    water individually each sprinkler. SECTION II. Literature Review The main challenges
    in the elaboration of an automated irrigation system for irrigation pivot-center
    are vital; on one hand to choose an adapted evaluation method of water requirements,
    and on other hand to identify a correct cloud IoT platform essential for data
    storage and treatment. The following paragraph focuses on these aspects and on
    reviewing existing works. A. Related Works Classical Water Production Functions
    (WPF) are useful tools for irrigation management and economic analysis of yield
    reduction due to deficit irrigation which is usually based on linear regression
    and don''t give a representation of nonlinear behaviors of complex ecological
    systems. To fix this issue recent research are investigated. We list the use of
    more robust and nonlinear techniques such as machine learning, Artificial Neural
    Network (ANN) and data-mining tools (e.g. Fortin et al in 2010 [2], Dai et al.
    in 2011 [3], Haghverdi et al. in 2014 [4] and Elnesr et al., in 2016 [5]). In
    this study we follow two different controls. The first model consists to control
    the speed of travelling of the central-pivot for a constant flow rate. The second
    uses an electronic control to adapt flow rate in the nozzles. The speed of travelling
    of the central-pivot is maintained constant. The variable rate irrigation (VRI)
    allows to save 9-19% of irrigation water and to address field-level spatio-temporal
    heterogeneity in terms of soil water holding capacity and depth of soil [6]. According
    to Pan et al in 2013 [7] VRI allows also to enhance water-use efficiency, improve
    productivity, reduce fuel consummation and reduce nutrient leaching. The choice
    of sprinkler package, the pressure of working, meteorological conditions and tower
    dynamics affect the irrigation water distribution pattern [8]. Moreover, variations
    in micro-meteorological and technical conditions can modify the water application
    depth and irrigation uniformity at different lateral positions with flow control
    nozzles or pressure regulators at each head [8]. Wind speed and direction don''t
    significantly modify the uniformity of water applicatIon but impact the absolute
    application depth of zones under VRI management [9]. To adapt flow of irrigation
    soils moisture measure must be done. Traditional soil moisture sensors need to
    be installed early in the growing season and must be removed before the harvesting.
    Dong et al in 2013 [1] has proposed a cyber-physical system based on underground
    sensors to monitor soil moisture but this approach do not monitor soil on only
    one depth [1]. The interest of the coupling of Geographic Information System (GIS)
    and Remote Sensing (RS) with Internet of Things (IoT) has been demonstrated by
    different authors such as Li et al. in 2012 [10] Ye et al. in 2013 [11] Wang et
    al., 2013 [12]. B. Estimations of Water Requirements The estimation of water requirements
    of crop (ETc) can be estimated from a simple soil water balance (SSWB) model.
    A general form of the soil water balance is done by the following equation: ETc=I+P+F+R+ΔS
    (1) View Source Where I is the irrigation dose [mm], P is the precipitation [mm],
    F is the net subsurface flow into the control volume [mm], R is net runoff or
    runon to the control volume surface [mm] and ΔS is the net change in soil water
    stored in the control volume [mm]. The potential evapotranspiration (PET) can
    be calculated by using different methods. A common one requires several weather
    data that are not all the time available. Among these methods, we mention Penman-Monteith
    [13] FAO56 PM) which ranked as the best method for estimating daily and monthly
    ET for all climates. Penman [14] (FAO24), Penman [15] (FAO-ppp-17), Kimberly-Penman
    [16], Hamon [17], Hargreaves [18], Haude [19], Penman [20], Penman-Monteith [21],
    Priestley-Taylor [22], Makkink [23], McCl [24], De Bruin-Keijman [25] (DK), Jensen-Haise
    [16], Blaney-Criddle [26] (BC), Blaney-Criddle [14] (FAO 24 BC), FAO 24 Radiation
    [14], Turc [27], Wendling [28], Valiantzas [29]. Nevertheless, modern technologies
    such as the use of Wireless Infrared Thermometers (IRT) appear to measure surface
    temperature and determine the ETc [30]. A comparison of 16 among the models mentioned
    above has been carried out by Liu et al. in 2017 [31] and have shown that FAO-ppp-17,
    Pen-63 and FAO-24 BC are the better results in semi-arid climate. Therefore, we
    notice that a poor calibration between all the aforementioned researchers lead
    to inconsistent results of existing studies on weighting lysimeter. Indeed, Jensen
    et al. report that FA024BC is better [32]. While Yoder et al. in 2005 [33] and
    Lépez-Urrea et al. in 2006 [34] find that FA056 PM is the better formula. Otherwise
    some authors such as Berengena et al. in 2005 [35], Howell et al. in 1998 [36]
    have proven that the adjustment of the Penman formula coefficients at local scale
    shows significantly performing results. To conclude, we assume that FA056 PM or
    FA024 BC can be tested as a first approach in the evaluation of the evapotranspiration
    and a precise evaluation can be obtained locally by adjusting the parameters of
    the original Penman equation. The local adjustment of coefficient of the Penman
    formula need the use of lysimeters and a long experimentation which is not always
    achievable out of research centres. The Maximal Evapotranspiration (MET) of a
    crop can be calculated at different vegetative stage when amount of water is sufficiently
    available and agronomic condition are optimal. The MET can be calculated by model
    but in real conditions, and the Real Evapotranspiration (RE) is inferior in amount
    calculated by model. By consequence, it''s important to measure accurately real
    evapotranspiration by mean of sensors to provide the necessary quantities of water
    and to avoid percolation losses related to excessive intake linked in particular
    to an overestimation of the actual evapotranspiration. C. Choice of Sensors Both
    approaches can be followed. The first one uses commercial sensing solutions which
    natively provide a wide range of features directly and allows researchers to focus
    on the developments of algorithms and meta-processing, etc. The second one uses
    open hardware solutions which are programmable and flexible allowing to developers
    to have the full control of the behaviors of the nodes [37] The first approach
    is particularly interesting to develop proof of concept but makes researchers
    dependent of one provider and the availability of sensors used for development.
    Moreover, the rapid turnover of product of high technology renders this science
    stream especially risked for long term developments. The second way although requiring
    further development is more sustainable and is generally supported by a large
    community of developers. The choice of sensors is crucial because nodes can move
    over time that causes considerable interferences in the communication between
    nodes. Moreover, the influence of temperature, humidity, rainfall, sandstorm and
    high solar radiation greatly affect the links and communication quality among
    the nodes, particularly in harsh environmental conditions. The high temperature
    encountered in semiarid environments affects significantly the received signal
    strength (RSS). The humidity linked to the irrigation system and the heavy rainfall
    intensely affects the propagation of radio waves. The choice of the wireless transceiver
    and the transmission protocol must take into account the number of nodes, the
    distances between them, the height of antenna and the operating frequency based
    on the desired size of payload [37]. D. Cloud IoT Platform The correct choice
    of the IoT Platform to build a solution can affect the overall success of the
    project [37]. Both explorable approaches acquire and manage the underlying hardware
    and software layers or use a commercial offering which provides all needed services
    to propose an integrative solution. A review proposed by Ray PP in 2016 compare
    the 26 most popular IoT cloud platforms based on the following parameters: deployment
    service, device management, system management, heterogeneity management, data
    management, tools for analysis, deployment, monitoring, visualization and research.
    According to Ray in 2016 [38], they should have at least 49 IoT cloud platforms
    present in the actual global market. Nowadays, any commercial or open source cloud
    platform allows to deploy, and hosts applications or models elaborated on different
    framework on the same cloud architecture. SECTION III. Calculation of Water Requirements
    The soil characterization has been achieved on basis of samples taken in situ
    by BNEDER (National Technical Studies Office for Rural Development) located at
    Alger (Algeria). 96 samples were taken following a systematic grid of 30 × 30
    m over the area covered by the pivot (one by layer of soil). The parameters evaluated
    were bulk density, texture and the soil water holding capacity. Then, parameters
    measured on each of the 32 sampling points for three layers of soil has been interpolated
    to obtain a high-resolution map. The software ArcMap 10.5.1 was used to interpolate
    data measured in order to generate a grid by layer of 5m × 5m (25m2 area per cell)
    for each kind of measure. Moreover, each layer of soil has also been interpolate
    using 3D spline method to obtain a 3D model of soil layer. This 3D model and the
    spatial interpolation of soil water holding capacity allows to calculate the plant
    available in function of the depth of rooting. As shown on Fig. 1. The first layer
    is a mix of one or more existing layers which have been homogenized from a textural
    point of view and the salt content by successive plowing on a height of 25 to
    30 cm. The water available for plant is also function of roots development which
    offers the possibility to explore a more and more large part of soil. The available
    water is obtained by a weighted mean of the depth of all layers explored by the
    root system at each stage of development. A day by day amount of water irrigation
    can be calculated from (1). Fig. 1 Different stages of crop development Show All
    The FAO Penman-Monteith method (2) is used to estimate the potential evapotranspiration
    (PET) and the evapo-transpiration of the crop (ETc), also named MET which takes
    into account the stage of vegetative growth of the crop by weighting the potential
    evapotranspiration by the coefficient Kc [13]. The Kc coefficient allows to modulate
    the PET in function of the crop envisaged and the stage of its stage of development.

    [mm.day−1] and Kc is a ponderation coefficient variating between 0.3 to 1.2 depending
    of the crop stage of development [8], see Fig 1. SECTION IV. Material The application
    is tested on a pivot-center irrigation and a crop of soft wheat implanted in Ain
    Salah located in the heart of the Sahara Desert region in the center of Algeria.
    This region is characterized by a hot desert climate where the temperature in
    the summer reach 47 to 50°C. The irrigation pivot-center is composed of 6 spans
    with a total length of 308m. The revolution time of the pivot is 24h, it means
    that every hour an angle of 15° is traveled. As shown in the Fig. 2, the cover
    area is increasing from the center to the outside. The sensors must stay functional
    with important temperature variation from 20 to 65 degrees and remained functional
    also in presence of rate of humidity close to 80%. Fig. 3 The proposed system
    and architecture Show All SECTION V. Proposed System and Archttecture We have
    chosen to follow the open hardware way as part of our developments. The proposed
    system is composed locally of a weather station. Several multi-depth moisture
    sensors distributed on the irrigate area at the middle on each span measure the
    amount of water at different depths and solenoid placed on sprinkler. Data are
    transmitted by LoRa modulation to a gateway which relay data to The Things Network
    using a 4G connection. A cloud architecture collects, treats and stores data received
    from the weather station and soil moisture sensor, and calculates in real-time
    needs in irrigation water. A. Weather Station The weather data are acquired by
    a micro weather station which uses a LoRa transmission system. This low-cost protocol
    has been chosen for its easiness of deployment, its ability to resist interference
    with the spread spectrum technology and the area that can be covered by a single
    gateway. The micro weather station is based on a Weather Sensor (Argent Data Systems)
    which contains an anemometer, a vane direction and a pluviometer. The weather
    station contains a temperature / humidity sensor AM2315 (Aosong) with an error
    of 0.1°C for the temperature and 2% for the relative humidity. The net solar radiation
    is measured by a digital net radiometer SN-500, Apogee Instruments. All sensors
    are connected on a LoPy which collect data and send them on LoRa / 4G gateway
    (see Fig. 3). B. Sensors and Actuators Soil moisture nodes based on LoPy using
    soil moisture underground sensors measure the rate of humidity at different soil
    depths. The humidity is measured at different depth (20, 30 and 50 cm) with Watermark
    Soil Moisture Irrometer sensor model 200SS. The measure of humidity at different
    depth allow to control if amount of water calculate are correct or if they must
    be adjusted. As show on Fig. 2, the 24 sensors are implanted in the middle of
    each ring, the water requirements are controlled 8 times per day (one just before
    the irrigation and one hour just after the irrigation) on each of the four control
    lines of sensors. Solenoid valves are implanted on the sprinkler feed pipes and
    allows them to be operated individually and thus finely control the water supply.
    The fine control of the sprinklers allows to have a same amount of water per unit
    area at each of the 6 zones traveled at the level of each of the different segments
    each hour. C. Cloud Architecture We use our own architecture based on a Cloud
    IoT platform and a share/hosting application platform. This architecture has already
    been tested with cattle behavior [39], digital phenotyping [40] and monitoring
    of bee health [41]. Time-related Data are transmitted to the Cloud IoT platform
    by LPWA network while images, videos and sound are transmitted by Wi-Fi network,
    see Fig. 3. 1) The Cloud IoT Platform The platform is composed of two parts. The
    first one is based on one hand on Apache Kafka, Apache Samza, Druid, to treat
    stream and time-related data. The second one uses an Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark
    are associate to store and treat images, sound and video. a) Time Related-Data
    Data are received by Apache Kafka which transfer them to Apache Samza to be processed
    before the ingesting by Druid. Druid is a distributed column -oriented fault-tolerant
    data store presenting real-time analytical capabilities. The data processing allows
    to increase the speed of ingestion 10 times by elimination of bad formed package,
    inconsistent and incomplete data. Redis Caching accelerate the speed of recurrent
    queries. The data are stored in units of few millions of lines named ‘segments’
    composed of 5 to 10 million of times-stamped events compressed by LZ4. Old segments
    are locally stored on HDFS. Both external dependencies are used: PostgreSQL and
    ZooKeeper to respectively store meta data and monitor the four kinds of nodes
    present in the cluster. These four types of nodes coordinate, broke, store in
    real-time or archive data in the distributed data store. b) Sound, Images and
    Video These kinds of data are independently treated and stored by a second structure
    based on Hadoop and Apache Spark. These kinds of data are also locally stored
    on HDFS. This structure offers better performance than an Hadoop, MapReduce, HiPi.
    Camera placed on the pivot center can make 3D-pictures of same plant every day
    in order to model their development and compare the impact of agricultural practices
    and weather conditions on the growth of the crop. The analysis of sound allows
    to detect any dysfunction may occur of critical parts of pivot-center and program
    a preventive maintenance (PM) to avoid the immobilization of the pivot over a
    long period. But both features are not yet implemented. 2) The Application Sharing
    and Hosting Platform Druid powers high performances application with low query
    latencies. To better exploit this performance and don''t be dependent of one SDK,
    we propose a cloud architecture able to host application developed on principal
    framework. This cloud platform authorizes elaboration of the model by researchers
    and also host endpoint applications of third party adapted to different kinds
    of material allowing to monitor and automate the pivot-center irrigation while
    optimizing crop yields. SECTION VI. Results We compare water requirements calculated
    by the cloud architecture with the one calculated by CropWat [42] decision support
    tool. This tool is developed by the Land and Water Development Division for the
    calculation of crop water requirements and irrigation requirements based on soil,
    climate and crop data. The calculation procedure is described in [8], the response
    of different yield is explained in [43] and the coupling between CropWat and climatic
    data of ClimWat is explicated step by step in [44]. Remarkably values calculated
    by CropWat assume that only water can change and other factors such as agricultural
    practices, fertilization, etc. are at optimal level. Table 1 gives results obtained
    with CropWat 8.0 for a wheat with a planting date of 25 November at In Salah,
    Algeria and total development in 180 days. Water requirements are calculated on
    basis of real daily weather data. Table I. Water requirements calculated with
    cropwat The Fig. 4 shows the comparison between measured and calculated with CropWat
    Potential Evapotranspiration (ETP). Both approach gives similar results. SECTION
    VII. Conclusion and Future Works We have outlined an architecture based on soil
    characteristics interpolate by mean of GIS, soil moisture measured, and weather
    data transmitted by LoRaWan to calculate in quasi real-time the water requirements
    of the crop. The LoRaWan is particularly adapted to transmit data in harsh conditions.
    In the end, the comparison of first approach performed with CropWat has allowed
    to calculate maximal evapotranspiration and verify that these are never exceeded.
    Fig. 4 Comparison between CropWat and measured average daily ETP Show All In order
    to validate the water requirements calculated using the CropWat model, we compared
    them with a precise model called AquaCrop [45]. This model considers more parameters
    affecting the vegetative and reproductive growth of crop. The implementation of
    3D Camera in specific areas places on the pivot, will open a new research path
    in the field of digital phenotyping. In addition to this, the continuous analysis
    of sound from microphones implemented in chosen places will quickly detect signs
    of failure and prevent downtime that can be expensive in term of crop profitability.
    As future work, we plan to exploit GPU Tegra Mobile Processors 1 that offers high
    computation power thanks to the exploitation of GPU processors in parallel [46]
    [47]. In addition to the high performance, these cards provide the possibility
    to exploit artificial intelligence algorithms for a better training and prediction
    of collected data. ACKNOWLEDGMENT We would like to thank our colleagues from Biosystems

    Introduction Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) has facilitated the sharing and
    exchanging of geospatial data holding by different stakeholders. It has been initiated
    to create an environment that enables a wide variety of users to access, retrieve
    and disseminate geospatial as well as non-spatial data in a secure way (Georis-Creuseveau
    et al., 2016; Smith et al., 2004). The technological growing need to organise
    the data across various disciplines and organisations and also the need to create
    multi-participant, decision-supported environments have resulted in the concept
    of SDI. It enables users to save resources, time and effort when trying to acquire
    new datasets by avoiding duplication of expenses associated with generation and
    maintenance of geospatial data (Giuliani et al., 2016; Coleman et al., 2016).
    SDI can be used for decision making, storage of various kinds of geostial data,
    bringing data and maps to a common scale as per the user needs, superimposing,
    querying and analyzing the data and designing/ presenting final maps/ reports
    to the administrators and planners (Yue et al., 2016; Senaratne et al., 2017;
    Koswatte et al., 2015). The utility of SDI for decision making and planning of
    land resources has become widely popular and is being used for a wide range of
    applications (Pun-Cheng et al., 2016; Mwange et al., 2016). There are five important
    components of SDI model which have been encapsulated. The component of SDI Model
    has been shown in Figure 1. In the dynamic nature of SDI Model, technologies,
    polices and accessing network are the core dynamic components in which people
    and data are the static components (Georis-Creuseveau et al., 2016). Figure 1.
    Component of SDI Model (Laura et al., 2017) SDI Model can play an important role
    in various applications such as environmental monitoring, natural resource management,
    healthcare, land use planning and urban planning. SDI integrates common database
    operations such as query formation, statistical computations and overlay analysis
    with unique visualization and geographical functionalities. These characteristics
    distinguish SDI from other information systems and make it valuable to a wide
    range of public and private enterprises for explaining events, predicting outcomes
    and designing strategies (Barik & Samaddar, 2014a; Barik & Samaddar, 2014b). SDI
    has also played an important role in mineral resources, water resources and coastal
    management in which it has potential to share and analyse all the hydrologiacal
    data, coastal data and mineral data related to geospatial data in a common platform.
    SDI models provide the possiblity to improve the spatial dimension of coastal
    zone aswell as water resources management. SDI models can allow accessing interoperability
    of data from river, coastal, marine, and terrestrial environments (Strain et al.,
    2004; Hamylton & Prosper, 2012; Idrees, 2015). For seamless development of any
    SDI model, it has been integrated with cloud computing which has been merged to
    perform added value services that give rise to geospatial cloud computing. The
    geospatial data have rich information about temporal as well as spatial distributions.
    In traditional setup, we send the data to the cloud where these are going for
    further processing and analysis (Yang et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2011). Continue

    The growing scarcity of fresh water and the increase of energy costs are two of
    the main challenges for the sustainability of production systems nowadays. This
    fact is prominent in agriculture, where most water consumption occurs (Smith and
    Urpelainen, 2016, Wong and Pecora, 2015, Spinoni et al., 2015), and especially
    in some areas such as in the Mediterranean basin (Chalghaf et al., 2015, Roca
    et al., 2016). In recent decades, great improvements in water and energy management
    have been achieved by applying information and communication technologies (ICT)
    to agronomic engineering, particularly in the field of irrigation systems. One
    of these emerging applied technologies is photogrammetry, which can be defined
    as the science of making measurements from photographs. It has been shown that,
    with suitable photogrammetric systems, it is possible to optimize the use of water
    in irrigation management in agriculture (Lou et al., 2016, Escarabajal-Henarejos
    et al., 2015a). Moreover, computer vision techniques can be helpful in many other
    tasks, such as crop monitoring (Brillante et al., 2016, Lin et al., 2013), controlling
    the quality of vegetables and fruits (Donis-Gonzalez et al., 2016, Kodagali and
    Balaji, 2012), weed control (Arroyo et al., 2016, Slaughter et al., 2008), and
    reading QR codes in the field (Qian et al., 2015), among others. Many advances
    have been developed by means of remote sensing, where satellite imagery is used
    to cover large areas all over the world (Ramírez-Cuesta et al., 2017, Odi-Lara
    et al., 2016, Sicre et al., 2014, Xu et al., 2010). However, they are very costly
    techniques, so some research works have proposed alternatives such as smartphones,
    lightweight drones, kites and other kinds of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) (Haghighattalab
    et al., 2016, Anderson et al., 2016, Chianucci et al., 2016, Torres et al., 2016).
    In the case of intensive agriculture for small holdings, which works with smaller
    plots and a greater variety of crops, these technologies could fail to provide
    useful visual monitoring. In those situations, the installation of cameras on
    the ground is a feasible option to achieve precise visual crop monitoring (Schima
    et al., 2016, Escarabajal-Henarejos et al., 2015a, Fernández-Pacheco et al., 2014).
    The cameras could be included as an additional component of other existing devices,
    such as lysimeters or agroclimatic stations, or they could be installed independently.
    For this to be feasible and profitable, two basic requirements should be met:
    the cost of each camera sensor should be kept as low as possible; and the system
    should be based on an open standard architecture. These features enable reduced
    installation and maintenance cost, ease of integration with other system components,
    and the possibility of future extension. In both kinds of applications, the percentage
    of green cover (PGC) of a crop can be obtained from photography, and can be calibrated
    with respect to the exact amount of irrigation water that a crop needs for growing.
    Therefore, the estimation of PGC – named by some author as the leaf area index
    (LAI), fraction of vegetation cover (Fc), or plant canopy coverage (PCC) – has
    received much attention in the literature recently (Viña et al., 2011). This fact
    has resulted in some free and public tools for PGC estimation, such as EasyPCC
    (Guo et al., 2017), Canopeo (Patrignani and Ochsner, 2015), and Easy Leaf Area
    (Easlon and Bloom, 2014). The techniques applied are usually based on pixel by
    pixel color classification, using vegetation color indices and different color
    spaces. For example, Guo et al. (2017) extract the 9 channels of spaces RGB, HSV
    and CIELab, and apply decision trees for color classification. The method of (Patrignani
    and Ochsner, 2015) is based on color ratios, such as red to green (R/G), blue
    to green (B/G) and excess green (2G–R–B) which are then thresholded by the user.
    Although these tools are very effective and freely available, they are offered
    in the form of interactive PC programs or portable apps, so they cannot be directly
    integrated into a web server. The objective of the research reported in this paper
    is the development of a new system for visual monitoring of crops in intensive
    horticultural applications. The proposed system consists of different hardware
    and software components, whose final goal is to provide farm managers with accurate,
    useful and frequently updated information about the state and water balance of
    the crop and its irrigation requirements. 2. Materials and methods The design
    principle follows the concept of a wireless sensor network (WSN), which is currently
    one of the most promising technologies in agriculture (Jiang et al., 2016, Guo
    et al., 2015, Ojha et al., 2015). The system is composed of a set low cost camera
    modules located in the field, which communicate by using the Internet with a cloud
    computing server. The camera modules are based on Arduino boards, that meet the
    requirements of low cost and open standards. They contain the minimal components
    necessary for capturing and transmitting the images obtained, by using extension
    shields. The required image resolution for a suitable processing should be at
    least QVGA (320 × 240 pixels) or higher, with a typical capture frequency not
    higher than 1 image per hour (normally one image a day), since plant changes occur
    very slowly. The cameras are to be placed in a stationary position near the zenith
    of the monitored area. Since Arduino boards have a reduced computing capacity,
    photogrammetric analysis is performed on the cloud computing server. This server
    is also responsible for performing water balance calculations, storing all the
    information in a secure database, configuring the capture modules, and interacting
    with the user through a web application. The computer vision algorithms implemented
    in the server allow automatic rectification of the perspective distortion of the
    images, and robust estimation of the green coverage of soil, which are then used
    to obtain irrigation requirements. The ultimate purpose of the system is to reduce
    the use of water while optimizing crop quality and productivity. The development
    of the proposed solution for visual crop monitoring and water balance estimation
    involves the integration of hardware, software and communication components. This
    section describes all these components, which have been chosen to meet the requirements
    of the desired system. First, the hardware for the camera sensor and the microcontroller
    board are presented, with a justification of their suitability and an exposition
    of their main features. Then, the methodological aspects of the software development
    process, which is based on an agile programming method, are discussed. Finally,
    the underlying computer vision algorithms for image analysis are introduced. These
    algorithms deal with the problems of perspective correction, markers detection,
    plant/soil segmentation and crop coefficient estimation. 2.1. Description of the
    hardware components As stated before, the principles that have guided the hardware
    design for the visual monitoring system are low cost and open architecture. The
    first of these principles enables installation of multiple modules in order to
    improve crop sampling and robustness to individual failures, while the second
    allows for easy extension of the system and reproducibility by other researchers.
    Each capture module consists of two main elements: a low cost camera, and a single-board
    microcontroller that controls the camera and communicates with the server code.
    The camera selected for the prototype system is an OV7670 (OmniVision Technologies,
    Santa Clara, CA, USA). The main reasons for this choice are its low cost, high
    availability in the market, ease of integration using open standards, and a good
    quality-price ratio. OV7670 has an image sensor of VGA resolution (640 × 480 pixels)
    integrated in a single chip of reduced size. It uses CMOS (Complementary metal-oxidesemiconductor)
    technology, and has a simple optics that can be focused manually by screwing or
    unscrewing. Fig. 1 shows an image of this sensor and other components. Download

    A view of some components of the proposed system. (a) OV7670 image sensor with
    AL422B chip. (b) Arduino Ethernet shield R3 and Proto shield PCB. (c) Sample screen
    of the Arduino programming environment. The camera chip has a predefined set of
    8 bit registers to control different capture parameters. They can be read or written
    using the Serial Camera Control Bus (SCCB), which is compatible with the I2C (Inter-Integrated
    Circuit) interface with a maximum clock frequency of 400 KHz. Some registers are
    related to the analog steps of capture, while others are used to control the digital
    processes. The most important parameters for analog image functions are: • Automatic
    Exposure Control (AEC). This allows adjusting automatically the exposure setting
    according to the luminosity level of the scene. This is performed in the timing
    generation controller of the OV7670. • Automatic Gain Control (AGC). This parameter
    sets the control of gain to automatic/manual mode, enabling to obtain images with
    enough contrast level. • Automatic White Balancing (AWG). White balance is related
    with the relative weighting of the three channels, RGB, captured by the sensor.
    The techniques for automatic white balance are usually based on assumptions such
    as the gray world, which considers that the average of all colors in an image
    tends to gray. • Automatic Black Level Calibration (ABLC). This register controls
    the calibration of the minimum level of the sensor corresponding to black color.
    A correct white balance is essential in the proposed system, since crop images
    are analyzed using color processing techniques. An inadequate balance could lead
    to an alteration of observed colors, giving rise to poor segmentation results.
    For example, if the scene contains large green areas, the process tries to compensate
    excess green. Therefore, in order to maintain color constancy for different days,
    locations, kinds of crop and lighting conditions, the best option is to unset
    AWB. This way, white balance is always fixed and does not change with respect
    to the observed scene. On the other hand, AEC, AGC and ABLC are intended to obtain
    gray-levels that are uniformly distributed. In order to measure luminance, control
    zones are defined in the pixels matrix, modifying the gain to achieve a stable
    wave. Then, a histogram method is applied so that exposure and gain are adjusted
    until the luminance histogram reaches a desired distribution. In the proposed
    system, these values are set to automatic mode, thus adapting the luminosity of
    the images to the changing lighting conditions of the crop scene. After analog
    processing, there is a block for analog-to-digital conversion, which produces
    a Bayer pattern image at 10 bits per pixel in raw mode. This image is introduced
    into a digital signal processor (DSP) which performs further image improvements
    such as edge enhancement, color space conversion (raw data can be converted to
    RGB, YUV or YCrCb spaces), hue and saturation control, white/black pixel correction,
    de-noise, gamma control, lens shading correction and, finally, pixel depth conversion
    from 10 to 8 bits. The resulting images in VGA resolution can be scaled to CIF
    (352 × 288 pixels) or lower resolutions, and the output can be arranged in different
    formats: raw RGB, RGB565/555/444, GRB 4:2:2, YUV/YCrCb 4:2:2. The desired resolution,
    format and the rest of the processes are controlled by different registers, which
    can also be modified using the SCCB interface. In addition to the 8 data lines,
    the following handshaking signals exist: VSYNC (Vertical sync output), HREF (Horizontal
    reference), and PCLK (Pixel clock output). The OV7670 is clocked from a 24 MHz
    oscillator. Therefore, this provides a PCLK output of 24 MHz. There are two possibilities
    regarding the integration of OV7670 sensor in the control module: with direct
    access to the image array, or with a frame buffer memory. In the second case,
    images are stored in an Averlogic AL422B chip, which provides 3 Mbits of video
    frame buffer memory configured as 393,216 bytes of FIFO (First In First Out).
    The internal memory of the AL422B is DRAM and requires continuous refreshing.
    The fastest clock applied to either the write clock (WCK) or the read clock (RCK)
    is used as the DRAM refresh timing clock. The datasheet recommends that the WCK
    and RCK are kept free running at least 1 MHz at all times. On the other hand,
    the control and configuration of the image sensor is performed by an open architecture
    microcontroller, an Arduino Due board (Arduino LLC, Ivrea, Italy). This is a widespread
    low cost microcontroller board based on the Atmel SAM3X8E ARM Cortex-M3 CPU. In
    the family of Arduino, it is the first board based on a 32-bit ARM core microcontroller.
    It has 54 digital input/output pins (12 of which can be used as PWM outputs),
    12 analog inputs, 4 UARTs (hardware serial ports), a 84 MHz clock, an USB OTG
    capable connection, 2 DAC (digital-to-analog converter), 2 TWI buses, a power
    jack, a JTAG header, an SPI header, a reset button and an erase button. Some interesting
    features make it the most suitable choice for the studied application. Firstly,
    it has low power consumption, with an input voltage of 3.3 V. Since the module
    is designed to be placed in different remote plots of the crop, access to the
    electrical power grid may not be available. Therefore, each module is powered
    by a rechargeable battery and a solar panel. Secondly, the input/output pins of
    the Arduino are compatible with the SCCB bus of the camera. Moreover, the open
    architecture of Arduino enables the integration of other components in the module,
    such as an Ethernet or WiFi shield. In particular, the Arduino Ethernet shield
    R3 has been used in the prototype system, as shown in Fig.1b. This shield adds
    to the module the essential functionality of communication with the Internet.
    It has an Ethernet Controller W5100, with an internal buffer of 16 Kbytes, and
    a bandwidth speed of 10/100 Mbits. The shield is connected with Arduino on a SPI
    port and also has an onboard micro-SD card slot, which is very useful to store
    files such as configuration data and captured images. Finally, the Ethernet shield
    is connected to a WiFi router with an RJ45 cable. If the configuration of the
    agricultural crop does not allow the connection of the module to a router by cable
    (e.g. if the sampled plots are widely scattered on the ground), the Ethernet shield
    can be replaced by an Arduino WiFi shield, or even by an Arduino Wireless XBee
    shield, which also include SD memory slots. The information sent by the capture
    module in HTML/POST format is received in a cloud computing server, which can
    be hosted at any location. Specifically, the server is an average PC with an AMD
    Quad Core Processor at 2 Ghz, 8 Gbytes of RAM memory, and a WAMP configuration
    (Agrawal and Gupta, 2014), which consists of: Windows operating system; Apache
    web server; MySQL database; and PHP interpreter (Achour et al., 2015). The server
    is responsible for configuring capture parameters of all the modules in the field,
    storing information in the MySQL database, interacting with the user interfaces
    using web pages, executing computer vision algorithms for image analysis, and
    performing the required computations for water balance estimation. 2.2. Software
    development methodology A web application has been developed by using the PHP
    language in order to support mainly: (1) system configuration (both cameras and
    crop parameters); (2) image capture and processing; and (3) results visualization
    and searching. Due to the dynamic nature of a web project, a flexible software
    process is appropriate (Sommerville, 2016). So, an agile methodology has been
    chosen, in particular Scrum (Schwaber and Sutherland, 2013), which is possibly
    the most popular nowadays. Scrum follows an iterative and incremental process
    model. The development process is divided into time boxed iterations called sprints,
    no more than four weeks long. As opposite to the traditional waterfall model,
    the result of each iteration is a potentially deliverable product (called increment)
    that can be reviewed by the user. Consequently, rapid feedback is obtained and
    deviations from user needs are detected very soon. The desired functionality of
    the application is collected in the so called Product Backlog in the form of user
    stories (Cohn, 2004). These user stories are prioritized so that at the beginning
    of a new sprint the functional tasks derived from the most important user histories
    are defined to be developed in, at the most, one month. It should be pointed out
    that the Product Backlog is not a static list, that has to be completed from the
    beginning, but a dynamic collection that could be updated at any moment. A user
    story has a template of the form: As [role] I want to [functionality] so that
    [benefit]. For example, two samples of user stories in the developed application
    could be: • As technical agronomist I want to configure the cameras so that capture
    is done with the highest quality. • As farm manager I want to query water balance
    so that irrigation is optimized. These stories define two sample functionalities
    that must be fulfilled in the final development. 2.3. Correction of the perspective
    distortion Regarding the software components of the WAMP server, the main functionalities
    reside in the computer vision algorithms for image analysis. The ideal location
    for the cameras would be a stationary zenith position, in order to obtain top
    views of the crop. However, in practice such location may not be available for
    the camera installation. In that case, the camera is placed in a tripod that allows
    taking photographs with a fixed viewing angle, producing a certain perspective
    distortion effect, as depicted in Fig. 2. Consequently, a geometric transformation
    has to be applied in the server to undo this effect. Download : Download high-res
    image (128KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Schematic view of the
    camera installation and the plot monitored. The camera defines a co-ordinate system
    (Xc, Yc, Zc), while another system is associated with the reference frame (X,
    Y, Z). This reference frame is a rectangle of corners (p1, p2, p3, p4), placed
    on the ground. As is well known, the perspective effect produced in a planar image
    seen from an arbitrary 3D angle can be modeled as: (1) where I is the image captured
    by the camera, and P is the rectified image with a resolution of W × H pixels.
    The values of (x′, y′, z′) are computed using a 3D rotation matrix M: (2) This
    matrix M describes an arbitrary perspective transform. It can also be expressed
    in terms of the three Euler angles (ω, ϕ, κ), indicating the relative rotations
    of the camera around the X, Y and Z axes, respectively. Nevertheless, the explicit
    calculation of these angles is not required to compute the undistorted image.
    There are different procedures to estimate the values of matrix M to undo the
    observed distortion. The most simple, fast and robust method consists of placing
    an artificial rectangular marker in the ground. This frame has a known size and
    a lighter color than the floor. The information of size allows making a correspondence
    between pixels and real world units. On the other hand, the contrast in color
    simplifies an automatic detection of the marker. This process provides the four
    corners of the observed rectangle, (p1, p2, p3, p4), as shown in Fig. 3. Download

    (b) Reference of the destination image, of size W × H pixels, and corresponding
    corners. (c) Obtained rectified image, P, by perspective projection. Matrix M
    can be computed by mapping these points, (p1, p2, p3, p4), to the four corners
    of image P, (c1, c2, c3, c4), whose resolution is defined to have the same aspect
    ratio as the size of the marker. For example, if the rectangle has a size of 1
    m × 1 m, image P could have a resolution of 500 × 500 pixels. This would give
    a real world correspondence of 2 mm × 2 mm per pixel. Each point correspondence,
    (pi ↔ ci), yields 2 equalities applying Eqs. (1), (2): (3) (4) for all i in {1,
    2, 3, 4}. Therefore, there are 8 equalities which allow solution of the 8 unknowns
    {m11, m12 … m32}. The system is compatible and determined – and, hence, can be
    easily solved by the method of Cramer, if and only if points (p1, p2, p3, p4)
    represent a non-concave quadrangle. After calculating matrix M, Eqs. (1), (2)
    are applied to all pixels to obtain the undistorted image P from I. A function
    of the graphics library is used for fast computation of this perspective transform.
    A sample result can be seen in Fig.3c), where bi-cubic interpolation has been
    applied in the geometric transformation. 2.4. Algorithm for detecting the reference
    points The previous algorithm for undoing the perspective effect relies on precise
    detection of the four corners of the reference frame. This process has to be done
    automatically, in order to be integrated into the system. The method applied for
    this purpose was proposed by Hernández-Hernández et al. (2017). The algorithm
    is based on the use of integral projections (García-Mateos et al., 2007), which
    are a fast and robust image analysis technique. An integral projection, or simply
    a projection, is a marginalization of the gray levels of an image along a certain
    direction. In brief, the process for rectangular marker detection consists of
    the following steps: • Given an input image, I, containing the reference frame,
    convert it to grayscale, G. • Binarize image G to black and white, T, using an
    adaptive threshold. • Compute vertical and horizontal integral projections of
    T, along different angles of projection, α. • The four angles and positions with
    greatest values of the projections are expected to correspond to the four edges
    of the rectangle (since it is brighter than the background). • Given the four
    edges of the rectangle, compute their four intersections, which correspond to
    the reference points. A sample of this process can be seen in Fig. 4. By using
    projections, the approach is very robust to shadows, partial occlusions and image
    noise. The accuracy was reported to be below 7 mm, taking less than 1 s on an
    average PC. On the other hand, in some cases, the method can fail in detecting
    the correct edges since the marker is a 3D object. Most commonly, the camera will
    be installed in a stationary location that is not modified along the cropping
    cycle. Therefore, the algorithm only needs to be executed in the first image of
    the sequence. Then, it can be used to verify that the camera position has not
    changed. Download : Download high-res image (602KB) Download : Download full-size

    image, T. (d) Some horizontal projections of T, at different angles between −30°
    and 30°. (e) Detected rectangle. (f) Resulting rectified image, P. The approach
    proposed to rectify the input images is able to provide top-view images, even
    if the camera is not located exactly in a zenith location. The results obtained
    are valid if the height of the plants is small (15–20 cm approximately), or if
    the camera is near a top position (1.5–2 m over the ground surface). Obviously,
    if the camera is far from a zenith position, the rectification process will be
    imprecise as the height of the observed plants is bigger. This effect can be observed
    in Fig. 5. Hence, the camera is recommended to be installed near the top position
    of the plot, ensuring also that the reference rectangle is completely seen on
    the images. Download : Download high-res image (606KB) Download : Download full-size

    and the corresponding rectified images after applying perspective transformation
    (bottom). 2.5. Automatic plant and soil segmentation Another computer vision problem
    that has to be solved is the automatic segmentation of plant and soil areas in
    the rectified images. This problem is used to perform an estimation of the percentage
    of green cover (PGC), which is defined as the number of plant pixels in a zenithal
    view of the crop, with respect to the total number of pixels (Fernández-Pacheco
    et al., 2014). After an adequate binary segmentation of the image in plant/soil
    areas, the PGC can be easily computed simply by counting pixels. Different approaches
    have been described in the literature to deal with the problem of plant/soil segmentation
    (Lin et al., 2013, McCarthy et al., 2010). The proposed method consists in applying
    two different algorithms which complement each other. The first algorithm is a
    probabilistic classifier using color models (García-Mateos et al., 2015). These
    models describe the probability density functions of plant color and soil color,
    by means of histograms. An iterative training algorithm is responsible for selecting
    the optimum color space and channels for each classification scenario (Hernández-Hernández
    et al., 2016); a total of 9 different color spaces are tested, with 7 possible
    channel combinations for each space. Then, probabilities of plant and soil are
    computed for each pixel using the Bayes rule. Although this method is automatic,
    it requires an adequate color model. Otherwise, a generic green model could be
    used. The second algorithm is a heuristic method using color reduction, by clustering
    in the RGB space. Firstly, it makes an analysis of the predominant colors in the
    image, by finding maximum variations in the histograms. The pixels that do not
    fall in these maximum intervals are classified using the fuzzy c-means algorithm
    (Bezdek, 1973); this is an unsupervised clustering method that produces a reduced
    number of representative colors. The classes with higher proportions of the G
    channel in RGB are considered as plant, and the rest as soil. Finally, the images
    are cleaned up using morphology operators. This method is completely automatic,
    so it can be used even if a color model is not available. After applying both
    segmentation algorithms, the system computes the corresponding PGC values. Then,
    the average PGC is used as an estimation to the actual values. This approach has
    proved to be very accurate and efficient. According to previous research, the
    accuracy in PGC values is about 99.5%. The combination of them improves robustness
    against errors in one or the other, while the total time of the process is typically
    below 2 s. Some samples of the segmentation and PGC computation are shown in Fig.
    6. Download : Download high-res image (768KB) Download : Download full-size image

    algorithm. Bottom row: segmentation with the color models method. For each image,
    the PGC obtained with each method (PGC1, PGC2), the average value (AVG), and the
    ground truth (GT, obtained with a supervised classification) are indicated. (For
    interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is
    referred to the web version of this article.) 2.6. Water balance estimation from
    the PGC Once the PGC has been estimated, the following step is to compute the
    water requirements of the crops, by using the methodology presented in González-Esquiva
    et al. (2017). Irrigation needs are estimated from the water balance in the root
    zone, given by equation: (5) where Θt−1 and Θt are the initial and final water
    content of the root zone (%) in the time period t considered, respectively; z
    is the root depth (mm); P is the input of water by rainfall (mm), obtained with
    an agroclimatic station; R is the irrigation (mm), obtained with direct measurement;
    L are losses due to the floor drain (mm), given by a lysimeter; and ETc means
    the crop evapotranspiration demand (mm). According to the FAO-56 methodology (Allen
    et al., 1998), ETc is calculated as: ETc = Kc·ETo, where Kc is the crop coefficient,
    and ETo is the evapotranspiration of a reference crop, usually provided by a climatic
    station. Therefore, to complete the calculation of water balance, z and Kc are
    estimated from PGC. The approach described in González-Esquiva et al. (2017) obtains
    first the average effective diameter of the plants, given by: (6) where S is the
    correspondence of the image to physical surface units, and N is the number of
    plants in the image, both provided by the user. Finally, z and Kc are given by
    regression using quadratic equations. In particular, the calibrated equations
    for a crop of lettuce of variety ‘Little Gem’ are: (7) (8) 3. Hardware and software
    development 3.1. Description of the hardware The OV7670 camera was mounted on
    an FCB support with position control by two servomotors 9 g, which allow an arbitrary
    orientation of 360° in horizontal and 180° in vertical to be achieved, inside
    an IP67 plastic warp. The camera is connected with a flexible cable of 18 pairs
    to a communication shield for Arduino, by means of a prototype shield which has
    been designed for the present system. Apart from the camera, the hardware components
    included in each capture module are: • An Arduino Due microcontroller board. It
    is responsible for controlling the other elements of the module by means of a
    program created for such purpose. • A prototype shield for Arduino Due/Mega. The
    pins are interconnected either by the prototype and welding. • An Arduino Ethernet,
    WiFi or XBee shield, depending on the ground configuration. This component contains
    a socket for SD memory cards, used for storing images and captured data. • A photovoltaic
    solar panel with rechargeable 6 V batteries. The different components are interconnected
    by direct insertion, as can be seen in Fig. 7. The Ethernet shield is inserted
    into the Arduino Due, and the prototype shield is inserted in it with a flexible
    female plug. The full module is powered by the photovoltaic panel, thus being
    independent of the electricity grid. For communicating the system with the outside,
    a centralized router is required to connect different network adapters of the
    existing modules with the Internet. In wireless networks, coverage range and attenuation
    speed are two essential aspects to be considered before deployment (Guo et al.,
    2015). However, as the system has been designed for horticultural applications,
    the effect of plants in the propagation model of the radio signals is negligible.

    designed to work outdoors, it is important to protect them against rain, humidity,
    dust and other adverse weather conditions. Waterproof protective bags, or similar
    solutions, can be used to avoid degradation of electronic components. 3.2. Description
    of the software Regarding the software components, the first functionality is
    the configuration of the system, including basic camera parameters. This is carried
    out using a web interface, as shown in Fig. 8, where the user can select the format,
    size, frequency and other settings for image capture. A web application in PHP
    in the WAMP server receives this information, and transmits it to the corresponding
    Arduino modules. Download : Download high-res image (149KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 8. Two sample views of the web application developed. (a)
    Camera configuration and image processing. (b) Water balance visualization and
    irrigation management. The internal programming of the Arduino Due board is done
    in C language, and uses an OV7670 library which consists of two files: a header
    file (OV7670.h) describing the existing public functions; and an implementation
    file (OV7670.c) which contains the necessary classes for access to the camera
    registers, as well as instructions for the execution of the image capture processes.
    Each Arduino module executes a program called “setup.ino”, using this library.
    As defined in the standard of Arduino, the program consists of two main functions:
    setup and loop. In the first one, the program configures the hardware setup parameters,
    as the interconnection of connector pins, enumeration of ports, and communication
    speed. In the second function, Arduino processor executes a continuous looping
    performing the following actions: • Communication with the WAMP server using HTML
    protocol. The module sends the data registered by the sensor, which is stored
    by the server into the MySQL database. Then the server sends back the system configuration
    parameters, as indicated by the user. • After successfully reading the server
    data, each Arduino board transfers these parameters to the OV7670 camera, updating
    the corresponding registers of the sensor, and determining the frequency of image
    capture. • Arduino sends a capture command to the OV7670 camera with the previously
    configured frequency. When the camera receives the command, it generates an image
    array containing the pixel information of red, green and blue brightness values,
    arranged in a Bayer raw format at a VGA (640 × 480 pixels) resolution, after application
    of analog and digital corrections. • The Arduino module receives this image. It
    is able to process information in the two possible forms described in the previous
    section: with a dump to the FIFO memory of the AL422B; or with direct image matrix
    access using the vertical sync, in the case of not having internal memory storage.
    In both cases, memory is accessed by means of the I2C interface to the Video Port
    memory. For this purpose, Arduino generates a signal with a frequency of 8 MHz,
    with positive logic for dumping existing data on the camera. • For the creation
    of the image file, Arduino sets up a new file record, transcribing bit by bit
    the information received in the I2C port to the file created. This file is closed
    with a successful flag if the size sent matches the file size received. • Next,
    Arduino stores the generated image in an SD file, for later delivery by HTML/POST
    protocol to the WAMP server. Recall that the SD card is inserted in the Arduino
    Ethernet/WiFi/XBee shield. • In addition to the image, an XML file is also created
    with captured information. The stored data includes time and date of capture,
    image resolution and the current configuration parameters of the camera. All these
    data are saved in a file on the SD card. Then, Arduino generates the parameters
    for a HTML/POST communication according to the W3C standard. The variables of
    the POST form are assigned according to those registered in the XML file, also
    including a binary transcription of the corresponding image file. • Finally, Arduino
    program waits for an acknowledgment (ACK) answer from the server. If the ACK is
    not received in a predefined time, between 30 and 90 s, Arduino sets a delivery
    error flag. In this case, the XML file is stored in a folder named “pending”,
    and the “history.xml” file is modified to add a pending flag in the corresponding
    file. The following processes are performed by the WAMP server, which contains
    the cloud computing functionality for photogrammetry management. The software
    of the server includes the algorithms previously described, executed in the following
    steps: • After receiving the XML file in HTML/POST format from the Arduino, the
    algorithm for rectangular marker detection is applied on the original image. In
    case of failure (e.g. due to an excess of vegetation covering the marker), the
    corners on the previously captured image are used. With the four corners of the
    rectangle, the code for perspective correction is executed, thus obtaining a rectified
    image. • Then, the algorithms for color segmentation are applied to the rectified
    images in order to detect plant and soil areas. Two algorithms are run: by using
    histogram color models, and with the fuzzy c-means clustering. These algorithms
    are able to deal with shadows, noise and hue variations in plant and soil colors,
    providing an estimated PGC (percentage of green cover) value. Both values are
    averaged to obtain a very robust and precise approximation to the actual PGC value.
    Each image of VGA resolution requires a computational time of usually less than
    2 s. • When all the images of a plot have been processed, the methodology proposed
    by González-Esquiva et al. (2017) is used to obtain precise estimations of the
    water balance of the crop. As described in Section 2.6, first this technique computes
    the effective diameter of the plants. Then, root depth and crop coefficient Kc
    are calculated using allometric relations, calibrated for a horticultural crop
    of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. cv ‘Little Gem’). Finally, using the FAO-56 methodology
    (Allen et al., 1998) and agroclimatic data, ETc and water balance are obtained
    applying Eq. (5). Irrigation is scheduled to maintain the water content of the
    soil near the field capacity (Escarabajal-Henarejos et al., 2015a). An HTML file
    is generated by the PHP code, with irrigation configuration information, such
    as activation/disconnection of the irrigation head, and activation control of
    the precise actuators. Other kinds of crops would require specific calibrations.
    All the data generated in the process, such as input images, capture data, segmented
    images, estimated PGCs, analytical results, and water scheduling results, are
    stored into a secure MySQL database of the server. The last functionality of the
    web application is the access and visualization of the information in the database,
    allowing the user to monitor the state of the crop and the irrigation scheduling.
    This part is programmed in PHP code, and is accessible remotely from any device
    with Internet connection and a web browser. An example view of this application
    can be observed in Fig. 8. 4. Results and discussion This section describes the
    experiments carried out to validate the practical feasibility of the proposed
    system, and the discussion of its advantages and weaknesses. First, the methods
    used for PGC and crop coefficient estimation are validated, as compared to other
    existing techniques. Then, some aspects about the technical implementation of
    the hardware are software components are discussed. 4.1. Experimental results
    The experiments were conducted on lettuce crops (Lactuca sativa L. cv. Little
    Gem), located in San Javier, in the province of Murcia (latitude 37°47′04″N, longitude
    0°49′34″W and altitude 15 m), Spain. The cropping cycle took place during the
    months of October to December of the year 2014. Lettuce seedlings, obtained in
    seedbeds apart, were transplanted in October, having a planting density of 16.5
    plants/m2. The total duration of the cycle was 60 days. Four subparcels with a
    size of 1.8 m × 1.0 m were monitored, being delimited by a white frame in each
    plot, as Fig. 3 shows. These plots are representative of the crop and are distributed
    randomly, away from the edges of the plot to avoid the edge effect (Escarabajal-Henarejos
    et al., 2015b). The images of the four plots were obtained simultaneously with
    two different methods: (1) a compact Sony digital camera model DSC-HX400 at a
    resolution of 3600 × 2000 pixels; and (2) using the proposed system with VGA resolution,
    640 × 480 pixels. This was done at intervals between 3 and 6 days. The first set
    was trimmed out by a human expert, while the second was done with the algorithm
    described in Section 2. The experimental validation consists of two tests intended
    to measure the accuracy in the computation of PGC, and the estimation of the crop
    coefficient, Kc. In the first case, four different methods were applied and compared:
    • ACPS PGC estimation using the portable app for plant/soil segmentation presented
    in (Hernández-Hernández et al., 2017), which uses probabilistic classification
    with color histogram models. • MEAN the technique proposed in this paper, which
    calculates the mean value of probabilistic classification and fuzzy c-means segmentation.
    • CANOPEO the free and public app for crop canopy estimation developed by Patrignani
    and Ochsner (2015). It was applied using the default threshold. • ENVI manual
    plant/soil segmentation of the images using the commercial software ENVI (Environment
    for Visualizing Images) version 4.0. This measure is the closest to the actual
    value, since it is the only method that is not completely automatic, but supervised
    by a human expert. All the methods use the high resolution images, except the
    proposed MEAN method, that uses VGA images, as they are obtained from the capture
    modules. The obtained PGC estimations are shown in Fig.9a). For each day, the
    average of the 4 plots is taken. The error measures with respect to the PGCs obtained
    with ENVI (taken as the ground truth) are presented in Table 1. Both absolute
    and relative errors are indicated, which are calculated as: (9) (10) where N is
    the total number of images, and PGCMETHOD(i) is the obtained values for each method
    and for each image i of the test set. Download : Download high-res image (295KB)

    all the methods have an excellent accuracy, which in relative terms are always
    below 6%. The lowest relative error is achieved by the proposed method, with only
    a 4.5% error. This is because, although it uses images of lower resolution, it
    combines the results of two different algorithms. ACPS has a low absolute error,
    but a slightly higher relative one, caused by the error committed in the early
    stages of plant development. CANOPEO also has a very good accuracy, but it fails
    to classify some over- and under-saturated images, which would require changing
    the thresholds. The computational cost of all methods are comparable, with times
    ranging between 1 and 2 seconds per image in a typical configuration. On the other
    hand, the computation of the crop coefficient, Kc, from the PGC has also been
    analyzed. In this case, the factors to study are the effect of the error in PGC,
    and the accuracy of the different regression methods. Therefore, the techniques
    compared are: • ENVI Kc estimation using the PGC obtained with ENVI and the equations
    proposed by Escarabajal-Henarejos et al. (2015a), applying logistic regression.
    • ACPS the same regression method as before, but using the PGC provided by ACPS
    tool. • MEAN methodology proposed in this paper, using the effective diameter
    as presented in González-Esquiva et al. (2017) and the combined PGC estimation.
    • CANOPEO the same regression method as before, but using the PGC values resulting
    from CANOPEO app. • BOWEN Kc estimation calculated with the Bowen-Ratio Energy
    Balance (BREB) (Bowen, 1926), using a Bowen station. This method provides the
    most accurate measures, so it is considered as the ground truth. The resulting
    predictions of Kc for the crop cycle under study are depicted in Fig.9b). The
    error measures with respect to the ground truth are presented in Table 2, again
    in absolute and relative terms with respect to BOWEN method. Table 2. Experimental
    results of the methods for crop coefficient, Kc, estimation. Error measures are
    taken with respect to the Kc obtained with BOWEN. RMSE: root mean square error
    for the four automatic methods. MRE: mean relative errors. Empty Cell ENVI ACPS
    MEAN CANOPEO RMSE 0.0206 0.0275 0.0065 0.0068 MRE 0.0182 0.0250 0.0055 0.0059
    Although all methods exhibit an excellent accuracy, with relative errors below
    2.5%, it is evident that the techniques based on the effective diameter (MEAN
    and CANOPEO) are significantly superior. In these cases, the error is below 1%
    of the BOWEN estimation. The proposed approach is marginally better than CANOPEO,
    since the PGC measure is more accurate using MEAN than CANOPEO. In any case, it
    can be observed that the error in PGC translates into a small difference in Kc
    error, e.g. ENVI and ACPS produce similar errors. That is, the effect of the regression
    methodology is more important than the effect of PGC calculation. 4.2. Discussion
    of the system development The development of the prototype system described in
    this paper has shown the practical feasibility of the proposed approach. Each
    capture module can be manufactured at low cost, which is around $35 per unit at
    current market prices.1 Since it is designed as a client-server architecture,
    the server can support the heaviest processing actions without the need of being
    located in the field. Consequently, the requisites of the in-field equipment are
    decreased, allowing the use of low cost Arduino boards. The installation of multiple
    low cost modules in a crop would be beneficial for improving the accuracy and
    robustness against individual failures of modules. Besides, although each camera
    is placed to take a zenith view of a specific monitored plot, the servomotors
    can be used to take broader views of the rest of the crop. These images could
    be very useful for the visual inspection by the farm manager, and for future purposes
    and extensions of the system. Regarding the weak points that were found in the
    implementation of the proposed architecture, some aspects are interesting to mention
    for future improvements. In this way, although the total cost of the modules is
    very small with Arduino Ethernet shields, it suffers a significant increase when
    Arduino WiFi or Xbee shields are used, around $55. In that case, the cost is similar
    to that of an IP67 WiFi camera. This could be an alternative to the described
    capture modules, provided that power source is available for the cameras. Another
    possible approach could be using low cost smartphones, which already include interesting
    features for the studied application: high resolution cameras, Internet connection,
    and processing and storage capabilities. However, the cost of this solution would
    be higher, being currently the simplest smartphones around $60; besides, a solution
    should be provided for power supply and outdoor operation. In any case, a detailed
    comparative study would be necessary for each application scenario in order to
    determine the most adequate solution depending on the system requisites. In the
    programming of the Ethernet shield, a compatibility problem has been found in
    the access to the Ethernet and the SD card. Since both elements share the SPI
    port, they cannot be used simultaneously, only one can be activated at a given
    time. This fact impedes a direct transfer from the SD files to the Ethernet; it
    has to be done through the Arduino memory. This memory is much reduced, thus hindering
    system configuration. A 400 KB buffer would be required for this purpose, with
    a response time of less than 2 s in the server. Another possibility would be to
    perform a direct transfer from the OV7670 camera memory to the Ethernet, without
    storing the file in the SD card. It has been observed that this method is only
    possible if the AL422B frame buffer FIFO is present in the camera. Otherwise the
    system is unreliable and blockages occur. Another drawback of the Ethernet shield
    is that it works at 5 V, while Arduino Due requires 3.3 V. For that reason, a
    DC/DC converter has been integrated in the prototype shield. Another alternative
    appears in the architecture of the modules. Instead of having several independent
    modules, they could be connected with a serial cable (via SDI or I2C) or with
    a RS485 adapter. This way, the images would be centralized in a single Arduino
    board working as a master, while the other Arduinos would act as slaves. The slaves
    would be simpler, requiring neither SD storage nor Ethernet connection. The master
    board would only be responsible for net communication. Moreover, in this case,
    the power supply could also be centralized and distributed for all the modules.
    This solution achieves an important reduction of the cost of implementation, but
    it is limited by the distance between the capture modules. 5. Conclusions In general
    terms, the proposed system provides a feasible solution to visual monitoring of
    horticultural crops, for the final purpose of water balance estimation and precise
    irrigation scheduling. A set of inexpensive capture modules can be located in
    sparse locations of a crop, each of them powered by photovoltaic panels and connected
    to one, or several, routers which provide communication with the Internet. A cloud
    computing server controls these modules and collects all the information, performing
    the necessary computer vision algorithms to estimate the state of the crop and
    its water balance. The system is available for the farm manager and any authorized
    user, from any location and device with a web browser. The process can be understood
    as a kind of virtual sensor, where models are utilized to estimate features from
    low-cost measurements. The experimental results have shown that the proposed methodology
    provides an excellent accuracy in PGC and Kc estimation and, therefore, in water
    balance computation. The error in PGC is below 5% in the studied crop of lettuce,
    and the Kc achieves a 0.6% error using correctly calibrated equations. Some other
    advantages of this approach are its scalability, integration and adaptability
    to different use cases. Currently, the system is designed as a tool for providing
    information to farm managers, who can perform a frequent and precise monitoring
    of the crops. However, the final irrigation decision rests with the human expert,
    according to the available information and his/her knowledge and experience. As
    a future research line, the automation of the irrigation scheduling should be
    studied. This calculation would have the requisite to minimize water consumption,
    while maximizing crop productivity, depending of each plant species and incorporating
    agroclimatic data. It could work as a completely automated system or as a decision
    support system for the manager. Acknowledgments The authors wish to acknowledge,

  description: Using evapotranspiration (ET) data for scheduling irrigations on vegetable
    farms is challenging due to imprecise crop coefficients, time consuming computations,
    and the need to simultaneously manage many fields. Meanwhile, the adoption of
    soil moisture monitoring in vegetables has historically been limited by sensor
    accuracy and cost, as well as labor required for installation, removal, and collection
    of readings. With recent improvements in sensor technology, public weather-station
    networks, satellite and aerial imaging, wireless communications, and cloud computing,
    many of the difficulties in using ET data and soil moisture sensors for irrigation
    scheduling of vegetables can now be addressed. Web and smartphone applications
    have been developed that automate many of the calculations involved in ET-based
    irrigation scheduling. Soil moisture sensor data can be collected through wireless
    networks and accessed using web browser or smartphone apps. Energy balance methods
    of crop ET estimation, such as eddy covariance and Bowen ratio, provide research
    options for further developing and evaluating crop coefficient guidelines of vegetables,
    while recent advancements in surface renewal instrumentation have led to a relatively
    low-cost tool for monitoring crop water requirement in commercial farms. Remote
    sensing of crops using satellite, manned aircraft, and UAV platforms may also
    provide useful tools for vegetable growers to evaluate crop development, plant
    stress, water consumption, and irrigation system performance.

    Figures Versions Notes Abstract Using evapotranspiration (ET) data for scheduling
    irrigations on vegetable farms is challenging due to imprecise crop coefficients,
    time consuming computations, and the need to simultaneously manage many fields.
    Meanwhile, the adoption of soil moisture monitoring in vegetables has historically
    been limited by sensor accuracy and cost, as well as labor required for installation,
    removal, and collection of readings. With recent improvements in sensor technology,
    public weather-station networks, satellite and aerial imaging, wireless communications,
    and cloud computing, many of the difficulties in using ET data and soil moisture
    sensors for irrigation scheduling of vegetables can now be addressed. Web and
    smartphone applications have been developed that automate many of the calculations
    involved in ET-based irrigation scheduling. Soil moisture sensor data can be collected
    through wireless networks and accessed using web browser or smartphone apps. Energy
    balance methods of crop ET estimation, such as eddy covariance and Bowen ratio,
    provide research options for further developing and evaluating crop coefficient
    guidelines of vegetables, while recent advancements in surface renewal instrumentation
    have led to a relatively low-cost tool for monitoring crop water requirement in
    commercial farms. Remote sensing of crops using satellite, manned aircraft, and
    UAV platforms may also provide useful tools for vegetable growers to evaluate
    crop development, plant stress, water consumption, and irrigation system performance.

    Water Scarcity and Commercial Vegetable Production Most economically important
    vegetable production regions of the world have Mediterranean, semi-arid, or desert
    climates in which supplemental irrigation is required to maximize yield and quality.
    Efficient irrigation management has become a major concern for vegetable farmers
    in these areas as water supplies have become more restricted and environmental
    impairments to ground and surface water from agricultural run-off and drainage
    has received more attention from regulatory agencies. Agricultural water resources
    have become increasingly stressed in the vegetable producing regions of Australia,
    Southern Europe, Chile, the Middle East, North Africa, China, and the western
    United States. California has been under severe drought conditions for four years
    since 2012 [1,2], and ground water supplies have been depleted to historically
    low levels on the central coast, where most of the salad vegetables are grown
    for the US and export markets. Lowering of the ground water table below sea-level
    through agricultural pumping has caused salt water to intrude into coastal aquifers
    and threatened the sustainability of thousands of hectares of prime farmland used
    for vegetable production [3]. Australia also experienced a severe decade-long
    drought during the early 2000’s that impacted vegetable farmers in the Murray-Darling
    Basin in New South Wales and Queensland [4]. The vegetable production regions
    of Chile [5] and Spain [6] have also experienced recurring multiyear droughts.
    Since many vegetables require high rates of nitrogen fertilizer and have shallow
    root systems, leaching of nitrate during the irrigation season and during periods
    of heavy precipitation has resulted in nitrate contamination of aquifers in many
    key vegetable production regions [7,8,9]. Irrigation run-off from vegetable fields
    also contaminates surface water bodies such as rivers, creeks, estuaries, and
    lakes with nutrients and pesticides [10,11,12]. Growers in California and Europe
    must report on the amount of fertilizer nitrogen that they apply to their crops
    to comply with environmental regulations [13,14]. They are also required to implement
    best practices to minimize nitrate losses, which will require improving irrigation
    management. 1.2. Challenges for Irrigation Scheduling in Modern Vegetable Operations
    Vegetable production poses several unique challenges in managing irrigation water
    efficiently. One of the major challenges for growers is the number of fields that
    must be concurrently managed in a medium to large size vegetable operation. Fields
    sizes for vegetable crops tend to be small (<5 ha) relative to agronomic crops,
    especially fields planted with leafy green, crucifer, and other salad vegetables.
    Large vegetable growing operations in the Salinas valley of California manage
    1–2 thousand ha of vegetables, with an average field size of just 4 ha. Small
    fields permit intensive management, allowing plantings to be staggered so that
    a steady supply of vegetables can be delivered to buyers and shippers. However,
    smaller field sizes means that farming decisions must be coordinated for many
    fields that may vary with respect to maturity, soil texture, cultural practices,
    microclimate, or other site-specific conditions. In addition to field size, the
    diversity of vegetables and number of crop rotations per season increases management
    complexity. Most diversified operations will produce more than 30 types of vegetables,
    each with unique nutrient and water requirements. Many vegetables are grown over
    short cropping cycles. Leafy green salad mixes like leaf and crisphead lettuce,
    for instance, reach maturity over just 30–65 day intervals during the summer.
    As a result, farmers in Mediterranean climates often grow two to three rotations
    of vegetable crops per year. Fields often are intensively tilled between crops
    to remove compacted zones caused by traffic from harvest machinery and to prepare
    raised beds for seeding or transplanting the next crop. These activities require
    that crews retrieve drip tape or sprinkler pipe after each crop is harvested.
    Another irrigation scheduling challenge is the number of field operations that
    must be coordinated during a crop cycle. Fields are typically sprayed to protect
    against insect and disease pests several times per crop cycle, and must be periodically
    cultivated to control weeds. Fertilizer applications are made several times during
    the growth cycle to satisfy the nutrient requirements of vegetables. Irrigations
    must be timed to accommodate access for tractor and hoeing crews so that activities
    can be completed on schedule. There may be several extended periods when a vegetable
    crop cannot be irrigated to permit the soil to dry sufficiently to allow tractor
    access. Irrigation equipment, such as sprinkler and mainline pipes, may need to
    be moved before each pass of a tractor through a field. Irrigation scheduling
    is also complicated by the numerous methods that vegetable growers use to supply
    water to their crops. Depending on the crop type, plant density, development stage,
    water source, and field and soil characteristics, growers may choose to irrigate
    using overhead sprinklers, drip, furrow, or a combination of methods. In California,
    leafy green vegetables harvested for salad mixes are seeded at high densities
    (8.5 million plants per hectare) [15] on 2 m wide raised beds and are irrigated
    almost exclusively with sprinklers. Small seeded vegetables such as crisphead
    and romaine lettuce are typically germinated with sprinklers, and after several
    weeks, irrigated with surface drip until harvest. Celery transplants may be established
    using overhead sprinklers, then drip irrigated, and occasionally flood irrigated
    to rewet the shoulders of raised beds. Since vegetable production is frequently
    characterized by short crop cycles, intensive crop rotations, and numerous small
    fields at different stages of maturity, farm managers are challenged to schedule
    and coordinate all the field activities while taking time to carefully schedule
    irrigations to optimize water use. Consequently, many farm managers may follow
    predetermined irrigation schedules to simplify water management and make small
    adjustments during the cropping season depending on their observations of the
    crop, soil, and weather conditions. Usually the amount of water applied to high
    value vegetables exceeds crop evapotranspiration (ET) to avoid water stress. In
    the Salinas Valley of California, for example, applied water amounts on broccoli,
    cauliflower, and cabbage averaged >200% of the estimated crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc) requirement [16]. While these applications rates may avoid water stress
    so that yield and quality are maximized, over-irrigating may strain water supplies
    and result in the leaching of nitrate and/or generate run-off that degrades the
    quality of receiving surface water bodies. Considering the numerous challenges
    and limitations of managing vegetables, growers, farm managers, and irrigators
    need convenient methods to schedule irrigations so that they can better determine
    how much water to apply to match the requirements of their crops. During the past
    few decades, significant improvements and lower costs for wireless communications,
    computing power, sensor technology, and aerial and satellite imagery have increased
    the potential to develop accurate and intuitive approaches for scheduling irrigations
    in vegetables. 2. Advances in Soil Moisture Sensor Technology 2.1. Recent Developments
    in Soil Moisture Sensing The monitoring of soil moisture has long been a standard
    way to determine when crops need to be irrigated. Growers and farm managers typically
    evaluate soil moisture by probing with a shovel or auger or monitoring with sensors.
    Sensors for volumetric moisture content and soil water tension have been commercially
    available for more than 40 years but were originally used more in research than
    for commercial crop production. Volumetric soil moisture sensors provide readings
    in units of m3·m−3, and tension-based sensors readings are typically in units
    of kPa, where a greater absolute value corresponds to drier soil conditions [17].
    In the past, the primary barriers to more widespread use of soil moisture sensors
    in irrigation management have included both cost as well as labor required for
    the installation, removal, and collection of readings [18]. In recent years, there
    has been a proliferation of commercially available soil moisture monitoring systems
    for agriculture. Many sensors interface with dataloggers and wireless communication
    systems to provide near real-time status of soil moisture from several depths
    and locations within a field. Data are automatically uploaded by radio or cell
    phone communications to cloud-based computer servers and are accessible through
    apps on smartphones and tablet computers. These communication advancements greatly
    improve the convenience of accessing data and can be configured to provide timely
    alerts when crops require irrigation. Many of these wireless communication systems
    for soil moisture sensors also support on-farm weather stations, digital flow
    meters, and control valves, which facilitates the monitoring of irrigation system
    operations. Soil moisture sensors have also evolved during the last few decades
    in terms of size, cost, and accuracy. Electromagnetic (EM) soil moisture sensors,
    used to determine volumetric soil moisture content, include time domain reflectometry
    (TDR) and capacitance sensors. These were once bulky and expensive instruments.
    With improvements in electronic manufacturing and better designs, current EM sensors
    (Figure 1A,B) are generally much smaller, cheaper, and more accurate than earlier
    models. Some versions are integrated with soil temperature and salinity sensors
    (e.g., Model 5TE, Decagon Devices Inc., Pullman, WA, USA). Others are integrated
    with dataloggers and radio communications (e.g., Model gStake, gThrive Inc., Santa
    Clara, CA, USA) to facilitate field installation and removal. Figure 1. Examples
    of various soil moisture sensors: (A,B) capacitance sensors; (C) tensiometer with
    an electronic gauge; (D) tensiometers with electronic gauges installed in a lettuce
    field and interfaced with a datalogger and radio communications; (E) tensiometer
    integrated with pressure transducer, datalogger, and radio communications; (F)
    granular matrix sensor and reader. Tension-based soil moisture sensors have been
    considered the best method to determine if a crop needs water since most vegetables
    experience reductions in yield and quality under prolonged periods of high soil
    water tensions. Tension thresholds that optimize production have been determined
    for many vegetable species [17,19], including broccoli [20], cabbage [21], cauliflower
    [22], lettuce [23,24], potato [25], and tomato [26]. An advantage of tension thresholds
    is that they are less influenced by soil texture than volumetric moisture thresholds.
    Tensiometers can accurately measure soil water tension in a range of 0–85 kPa
    using a mechanical vacuum gauge attached to a water filled tube with a porous
    ceramic cup [17] (Figure 1C). Tensiometers must be installed without air gaps
    between the ceramic cup and soil to function properly. To reduce labor for collecting
    readings, several recent models have sensitive electronic pressure transducers
    that measure vacuum pressure and can be interfaced to dataloggers and wireless
    communication services (Figure 1D,E) so that data may be monitored remotely (Figure
    2) (e.g., Hortau Inc., Lévis, QC, Canada). Though tensiometers do not need calibration,
    they usually require periodic maintenance to assure that they are functioning
    properly. Entrapped air that develops at high tensions must be replaced with de-aired
    water. Adding a weak solution of algaecide or bleach can prevent biological growth
    inside the tensiometer tube, which may potentially clog the ceramic cup [26].
    Figure 2. Fifteen minute readings (kPa) from tensiometers installed in a lettuce
    field at 8 (20 cm) and 18 inch (46 cm) depths are displayed in an online irrigation
    scheduling application. Granular matrix sensors (GMS) (Figure 1F) indirectly measure
    soil water tension using electrical resistance and are often used as an alternative
    to tensiometers (e.g., Model watermark 200SS, Irrometer Company Inc., Riverside,
    CA, USA). Most GMS can be interfaced to dataloggers and wireless communications
    [26]. An advantage of GMS compared to tensiometers is that they do not require
    regular servicing. These sensors retain sensitivity at higher soil moisture tensions
    (up to 200 kPa) but are less accurate at low soil moisture tensions (0–15 kPa)
    than tensiometers [17,26]. GMS readings are also affected by fluctuations in soil
    temperature [17]. Another limitation of GMS is that the response time to wetting
    and drying cycles is slower compared to tensiometers [26,27]. A number of studies
    have evaluated automated irrigation scheduling based on soil moisture readings
    for improving the water use efficiency of vegetables irrigated with drip tape.
    Automatic controllers used in these studies irrigated crops for short durations
    several times per day when soils dried below a predetermined threshold [28,29].
    Some control systems have relied on tension based sensors [26,28], while others
    have used volumetric soil moisture sensors [28,30,31,32,33,34] to determine when
    to irrigate. The use of TDR soil moisture sensors for triggering irrigations in
    sub-surface drip irrigated sweet corn resulted in an 11% savings in water use
    with similar yields compared to a standard sprinkler irrigated treatment [30].
    Small plot trials have demonstrated water savings, reduced nitrate leaching, and
    improvements in yield in drip irrigated fresh market tomatoes, bell peppers, and
    zucchini squash using capacitance soil moisture sensors to trigger irrigations
    [31,32,33,34,35]. Using tensiometers, Mũnoz-Carpena et al. [26] were able to reduce
    water use in fresh market tomato by 67% compared to the grower standard practice
    without significant reductions in marketable yield. Most of the water savings
    were during the early crop stages when evapotranspiration rates were low. Capacitance
    soil moisture sensors were generally found to be more reliable for automated irrigation
    scheduling than tensiometers and GMS. As discussed earlier, tensiometers require
    regular maintenance, and the GMS response to changes in soil moisture was too
    slow to use these sensors for triggering irrigations. While these studies have
    demonstrated the potential for water savings in small plots, automated irrigation
    scheduling may have several limitations in commercial vegetable fields. The optimal
    volumetric soil moisture threshold for triggering an irrigation would need to
    be empirically determined for different soil types. Pressurized water would need
    to be continuously available to accommodate frequent short irrigations. In large
    fields, short irrigation cycles could lead to significant drainage at the lower
    end of a field when drip lines depressurize. 2.2. Limitations of Soil Moisture
    Sensors for Irrigation Scheduling in Vegetables While much progress has been made
    in improving the accuracy and utility of soil moisture sensors, several factors
    still limit their use for irrigation scheduling of vegetables. Though costs for
    individual sensors may be less than in the past, the addition of dataloggers,
    cell phone modems, and radio communications, which facilitate real-time monitoring,
    has added to the total costs. Labor for installation and removal of sensors remains
    a significant cost, especially in vegetable crops with short production cycles.
    Considering labor and capital costs, many growers elect to use soil moisture monitoring
    equipment in a small percentage of their vegetable fields. Though soil moisture
    sensors are useful for determining when to irrigate vegetables, they are less
    useful for estimating how much water to apply. Soil moisture tension readings
    must be converted to volumetric moisture to estimate soil water depletion since
    a previous irrigation or rain event. Volumetric soil moisture sensors may also
    need calibration. Most capacitance sensors use the manufacturer’s calibration
    equations to convert readings to volumetric water content. Clay content, organic
    matter, salinity, bulk density, and temperature can affect the accuracy of capacitance
    sensors [36,37,38,39,40]. The effect of these factors on water content readings
    can vary in different soil types. For example, Kargas and Soulis [38] evaluated
    the accuracy of the 10HS capacitance sensor, and found that temperature had a
    larger effect on soil water content readings in clay than course textured soils.
    They concluded that calibration for specific soil types was needed to achieve
    accurate readings. Even with accurate sensors, spatial variability can limit the
    reliability of soil moisture estimates if readings are collected from only a few
    locations, especially if soil hydraulic properties vary within a field or the
    irrigation system applies water unevenly. Soil maps can be useful for guiding
    the placement of soil moisture sensors in locations that represent the dominant
    soil properties of fields. In drip-irrigated fields, determining the optimal location
    to accurately monitor soil moisture depletion can be particularly challenging.
    Soil moisture is typically higher under drip tape than adjacent to the plants,
    where root activity is concentrated. Placing sensors too close to a drip line
    may lead to under-irrigating a crop, and placing sensors too far away may result
    in over-irrigating [41]. Through computer modeling experiments, Soulis et al.
    [42] concluded that the optimal positioning of soil moisture sensors in drip-irrigated
    crops was influenced by soil hydraulic properties, crop evapotranspiration rate,
    and the configuration of the irrigation system. An additional consideration is
    the ideal depth at which to place sensors relative to the crop root zone. Broccoli
    roots can reach depths greater than 1.2 m at maturity [16], while roots of many
    leafy greens such as spinach may reach less than 0.5 m by harvest [43]. 3. ET-Based
    Approaches to Scheduling Irrigations in Vegetables Water requirements of vegetable
    crops can also be determined from estimates of crop evapotranspiration (ETc).
    Using Penman-Monteith [44,45], or similar equations [46], evapotranspiration (ET0)
    of a well-watered reference crop, such as grass, or alfalfa, is commonly estimated
    from measurements of air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and solar
    radiation [47]. The evapotranspiration of a well-watered vegetable crop can be
    estimated relative to a reference crop by multiplying ET0 by a crop coefficient
    (Kc). Crop coefficients for most major vegetable crops were summarized by Allen
    et al. [48], Guerra et al. [49], and Grattan et al. [50]. Networks of public weather
    stations to monitor reference ET have been established in many vegetable production
    regions of the world where irrigation is commonly used. The California Irrigation
    and Information System (CIMIS) is operated by the Department of Water Resources
    in California and consists of more than 145 weather stations sited on reference
    crops throughout the state. ET0 and other meteorological data, including precipitation,
    air and soil temperature, wind speed, solar radiation, and relative humidity,
    are available for users to download from the state operated website. Similar networks
    have been developed for other states including Arizona (AZMET), Colorado (CoAgMet),
    Florida (FAWN), Nevada (NICENET), Oklahoma (MesoNet), Oregon (AgriMet), and Washington
    (AgWeatherNet). Most European countries also have weather station networks that
    provide daily ET0 data through public websites (e.g., Spain [51], Italy [52]).
    In addition, CIMIS offers a satellite based product that estimates ET0 at a 2
    km resolution based on data from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite
    [53]. Many commercial companies also offer affordable weather stations (e.g.,
    ET107, Campbell Sci. Inc., Logan, UT, USA; WatchDog 2900ET Weather Station, Spectrum
    Technologies, Aurora, IL, USA; HOBO U30-NRC Weather Station, Onset Computer Corp.
    Bourne, MA, USA) that can be used to estimate ET0 on a farm. These systems offer
    a way to monitor ET0 in regions not covered by a public network, or for farms
    that are not located reasonably near an established station. However, in practice,
    few growers site or maintain stations in accordance with World Meteorological
    Organization standards for reference evapotranspiration measurements. Many growers
    site weather stations near trees, buildings, or parking lots, which limits the
    fetch and can influence the micro-climate, and potentially bias estimates of ET0.
    Stations are infrequently sited on a suitable well-watered reference crop. Most
    farmers do not allocate time to regularly maintain and calibrate meteorological
    instrumentation on their stations. Commercially available atmometers (ETgage Co.,
    Loveland, CO, USA) can be used to monitor ET0 but must also be sited over a reference
    crop. Although ET0 data have been useful for water agencies to estimate the seasonal
    water use of crops at a regional scale, growers have generally considered this
    approach to be impractical for scheduling irrigations in vegetable systems. A
    major difficulty is that the Kc value can change daily as vegetables grow and
    leaf area increases. During the establishment phase, when crop foliage covers
    a small percentage of the soil surface, ET is mostly from soil evaporation rather
    than from crop transpiration. For many vegetable crops, such as leafy greens and
    brassicas, the canopy cover is less than 10% until halfway through the crop cycle.
    The Kc during this early stage will depend on factors influencing evaporative
    losses from the soil, such as method and frequency of irrigations, and soil physical
    properties [48]. Later, in the rapid growth phase, Kc values increase daily as
    the canopy cover develops and covers the soil. Solutions for calculating a daily
    Kc for lettuce were proposed by Gallardo et al. [54] in which soil evaporation
    from unshaded soil (E) is estimated separately from the water lost by transpiration
    and soil evaporation under the crop canopy (T). Using this approach, Kc is proportional
    to the fractional cover (Fc) of the leaf canopy shading the soil, and E is related
    to the hydraulic properties of the soil and the time since the crop was irrigated.
    The general approach is consistent with Allen et al. [48,55], who also proposed
    separating the Kc of crops that have a significant period of minimal canopy cover
    into dual components consisting of a basal crop coefficient (Kcb) that represents
    water loss by transpiration and an evaporation coefficient (Ke), representing
    loss from soil evaporation. Direct relationships between Fc and Kcb have been
    reported for several crops such as broccoli [56], wheat [57], cotton [58], sugar
    beets [58], and grapes [59]. Both Gallardo et al. [54] and Allen et al. [48] describe
    calculations for estimating soil evaporation, which divide Ke into stage 1 and
    stage 2 periods. Stage 1 occurs immediately following an irrigation or rain event
    that saturates the soil to field capacity. During stage 1, water loss is limited
    by the energy available for evaporation. Stage 2 occurs after the soil is visibly
    dry and water loss is limited by soil hydraulic properties. The Stage 2 rate of
    evaporation diminishes with time as the soil water content declines. 4. Software
    for ET Based Scheduling of Vegetables 4.1. Overview of Sofware Tools Even with
    publicly available ET0 data and accurate Kc models, the implementation of ET-based
    irrigation scheduling at the scale of a commercial vegetable farm may be difficult
    for growers. Daily ET0 values need to be retrieved from a location representative
    of the field of interest. An estimate of canopy cover is needed to determine the
    average Kc for each irrigation event. Soil evaporation calculations require knowledge
    of the soil properties of the field, irrigation method, and interval between irrigations
    or rainfall events. To convert crop ET into an irrigation recommendation, the
    application rate and distribution uniformity of the irrigation system, and in
    some cases the leaching fraction, also needs to be integrated into the calculations.
    Recognizing that most growers have limited time to dedicate to making decisions
    on water management, several universities and public institutions have developed
    computer programs to facilitate ET based scheduling. Spreadsheet and Windows-based
    irrigation scheduling programs, such as CROPWAT [60], KanSched 2.0, Basic Irrigation
    Scheduling (BIS) [61], and consumptive use program (CUP) [62] automate the irrigation
    scheduling calculations but require users to retrieve and enter daily ET0 values.
    Since separate spreadsheet files maybe needed for each crop, these programs may
    be difficult to implement in large growing operations that manage many fields.
    Washington Irrigation Scheduling Expert (WISE) [63,64] is a downloadable JavaScript
    application that runs on personal computers. More recently developed web-based
    applications such as Irrigation Scheduler mobile (Washington State University)
    [65], Irrigation Management Online (Oregon State University) [66], Wateright (Fresno
    State University) [67,68], and CropManage (University of California, Division
    of Agriculture and Natural Resources) [69,70] were developed to automatically
    retrieve ET0 data from weather station networks such as AgWeatherNet and CIMIS
    and support irrigation scheduling of multiple fields. These applications are accessed
    through web browsers, some of which automatically resize the user interface to
    smartphone screens. Colorado State University WISE Irrigation Scheduler [71] and
    SmartIrrigation (University of Florida, University of Georgia) [72,73,74] have
    similar capabilities but can operate exclusively on smartphones through downloadable
    applications. Outside of the United States, several public agencies have developed
    online irrigation scheduling services including IRRINET in Italy [75], ISS-ITAP
    in Spain [76], IRRISA in France [77], and IrriSatSMS [78] in Australia. In addition,
    a growing number of ET-based software tools are commercially available. Two examples
    are Probe Schedule (IRRinet LLC, Dalles, OR, USA) and Irrigation Advisor (PowWow
    Energy Inc., San Mateo, CA, USA). Further details of these commercial products
    are not provided here since they are proprietary and usually not documented in
    the scientific literature. Most online irrigation scheduling tools have cloud-based
    databases that retain information associated with each planting, such as soil
    type, planting and harvest dates, weather station name, and irrigation system
    application rate, so that the user does not need to reenter critical information
    for each irrigation event. After entering the information required to initiate
    a new planting, users can quickly look up how long to irrigate their crops. Some
    scheduling software provides weekly or daily summaries of how much water to apply
    (e.g., IrrigationScheduler, Wateright, SmartIrrigation, etc.), while others such
    as CropManage enable the user to input specific dates for each irrigation [70].
    The online format facilitates automated retrieval of current and forecasted weather
    data in advance of planned irrigation events, so that growers can be alerted when
    a field will need water. In addition to linking with weather station networks,
    decision support tools can also incorporate other online services such as UC Davis
    SoilWeb for identifying the soil physical properties of a field using the United
    States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) database
    [79] or Google Maps, which can be customized for determining the longitude and
    latitude of a field or viewing locations of nearby weather stations. CropManage
    can also be customized to automatically retrieve flowmeter and soil moisture data
    from internet-accessible dataloggers. While many of these irrigation-scheduling
    programs will provide recommendations for multiple commodities, few have been
    developed or tested specifically for vegetables. Most irrigation scheduling applications
    use single Kc values for the four crop growth stages described by Doorenbos and
    Pruitt [80] to simplify calculations of ETc. CropManage was initially developed
    for vegetable irrigation and employs a dual crop coefficient approach for estimating
    crop ET similar to Gallardo et al. (1996), as described in Johnson et al. [81]
    and Smith et al. [16]. The vegetable crops currently supported include broccoli,
    cabbage, cauliflower, lettuce, and spinach. Since the user enters the date of
    each irrigation event, CropManage adjusts watering recommendations for the frequency
    and method of irrigation. Empirical models of fractional cover are included for
    each supported vegetable crop so that the user can customize the Kcb curves for
    a specific season, bed width, and planting configuration. Replicated field trials
    demonstrated that the CropManage irrigation recommendations using the ET based
    algorithm with a dual crop coefficient optimized water use and yield in crisp
    head lettuce and broccoli [81]. 4.2. Achieving Widescale Adoption of Irrigation
    Software Despite significant progress in developing ET-based irrigation scheduling
    software for commercial vegetable farms, many challenges exist that will need
    to be addressed to achieve large-scale adoption by growers. Although public ET
    weather station networks have been established in many vegetable producing regions
    of the US and Europe, they are less common in other regions such as India, China,
    and Latin America. In areas where ET0 data are available, the density or siting
    of weather stations may not provide sufficient resolution to fully capture regional
    variation in microclimates. In these instances, growers may choose to install
    and operate their own weather stations, as described above. Another challenge
    is to deliver accurate irrigation recommendations without requiring users to provide
    excessive details about their crop, irrigation system, and field conditions. Morrison
    [82] found that time constraints and concerns about data entry errors were factors
    that deterred grower adoption of the irrigation scheduling software. Irrigation
    scheduling apps also need to be intuitive for irrigators and farm managers to
    use in the field. The user-interface displayed on smartphones and tablet computers
    must be easy to read and to understand, while providing sufficient detail for
    the user to verify that the values for ET0, Kc, and other variables used in the
    scheduling calculations are accurate. Also, since the principal language of many
    irrigators in the western US is Spanish, irrigation scheduling applications need
    to support multiple languages. The cost of computer programming services is also
    a major barrier to developing and maintaining irrigation scheduling software.
    As software has become more sophisticated, and needs to be compatible with personal
    and tablet computers and smartphones, the complexity and consequently costs of
    development have increased. Software products will incur annual costs associated
    with updating to new technology, introducing new features, and troubleshooting
    identified errors. Most publicly available irrigation scheduling applications
    were initially developed under research grants, and need either continued grant
    funding or income generated from user subscriptions to support updating and maintenance
    costs. Several online irrigation scheduling services that were initially funded
    by the European Union became inactive after grants ended [83]. It may be cost-effective
    for institutions to collaborate on the development of software products that are
    sufficiently flexible to be customized for different growing regions and commodities.
    SmartIrrigation is an example of such collaboration between the University of
    Florida and University of Georgia. There also may be opportunities for public
    agencies, commodity boards, and commercial companies to partner on the development
    of commercial irrigation scheduling software. For instance, SureHarvest Inc. (Santa
    Cruz, CA, USA) recently developed an online irrigation-scheduling tool for almonds
    in collaboration with the University of California and the Almond Board of California.
    5. Field Measurements of Crop ET Field measurements of crop ET are needed to develop
    and verify crop coefficients as well as to investigate the interaction of water
    stress on crop yield and quality. Several reviews detail the advantages and disadvantages
    of various methods of measuring crop ET [84,85]. Weighing lysimeters have often
    been used to measure crop water use [85,86]. While considered the most accurate
    ET measurement method, the expense of these instruments limits their use to research
    stations and constrains the range of sites, crops, and management practices that
    can reasonably be evaluated. Energy balance methods such as Bowen ratio [85],
    eddy covariance [85], and surface renewal [87] are more affordable alternatives
    to lysimetry for evaluating crop ET and can be deployed in commercial fields for
    evaluating crop water use under a wide range of growing conditions. Instrumentation
    costs for these methods can exceed $10,000 USD per station, which has limited
    their use primarily to research studies. Energy balance methods involve monitoring
    of net radiation, soil heat flux, and sensible heat flux to estimate the latent
    heat flux (Wm−2), which can be converted to water flux or evapotranspiration rate
    through the latent heat of vaporization. Generally, the sensors used for energy
    balance measurements have become more reliable, cheaper, and more accurate in
    recent years. The capabilities of dataloggers used for operating the instrumentation
    have also improved, with more memory and faster computation speeds, while post-processing
    software modules have become more accessible. Energy balance methods have been
    used for evaluating the water use of vegetable crops in commercial fields, including
    artichokes, broccoli, beans, lettuce, onions, and processing tomatoes [50,88,89,90,91,92].
    These methods have been useful for reevaluating existing crop coefficients, as
    production practices and varieties have improved during recent years [93]. However,
    considering the diversity of vegetables and production methods, relatively few
    ET studies have been published using these techniques during the last decade.
    Surface renewal, which uses thermocouples to measure rapid changes in air temperature,
    has greatly reduced the costs of estimating sensible heat flux and may be well
    suited to vegetable fields due to a smaller fetch requirement compared to eddy
    covariance. Advances in surface renewal methodology [94] have culminated in a
    commercial service that provides growers with ET estimates and irrigation recommendations
    via a web application (Tule Technology Inc., Oakland, CA, USA). However, this
    tool has primarily been used in perennial crops such as trees, grapes, and strawberries.
    6. Satellite-Based Crop ET Determination 6.1. Energy Balance Researchers have
    developed satellite-based energy balance models to estimate ET at various spatial
    and temporal scales (e.g., reviews of Courault et al. [95]; Kalma et al. [96];
    Gonzalez-Dugo et al. [97]). The Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL)
    and the Mapping EvapoTranspiration at high Resolution with Internalized Calibration
    (METRIC) are two widely used approaches [98,99]. Optical and thermal band data
    from Landsat or other satellites is used to help parameterize the energy balance
    equation [100]. At the moment of satellite overpass, latent heat flux (LE) is
    retrieved through the calculation of surface energy balance that is based on radiative,
    aerodynamic, and energy balance physics. LE is converted to ET for the corresponding
    hour and subsequently to reference ET fraction (ETrF) by comparison with the measured
    reference ET for the hour. Finally, daily (2) ET is derived as the product of
    ETrF and reference ET for the day, under the assumption that ETrF approximates
    the average daylight evaporative fraction. The energy balance approach accounts
    for the effects of ET reduction in water-stressed crops, due to stomatal regulation
    and increased ET due to bare-soil evaporation. Linear or spline interpolation
    can be used to estimate ETrF (hence daily ET) between satellite overpasses, which
    occur every eight days in the case of Landsat, assuming clear-sky conditions.
    Manual intervention is used to calibrate the sensible heat flux computation by
    identifying portions of the image (hot and cold ‘anchor’ pixels) that represent
    extreme ET conditions, where ET can be estimated and assigned a priori. In a typical
    agricultural situation, cold pixels are associated with well-irrigated agricultural
    fields with high Fc and hot pixels with bare dry fields. Overall the ET retrieval
    error for the satellite-based energy balance is typically 5–15%, when estimates
    are produced by an experienced operator, and rises to 30–40% when operated by
    non-specialists or novices to the fields of hydrologic science, environmental
    physics, remote sensing, or agricultural systems [85]. An automated calibration
    method has been recently developed to facilitate and improve operation by non-specialists
    [101]. 6.2. Vegetation Index Hybrid approaches estimate fractional cover (Fc)
    from remote sensing and use ground-based ET0 data. Fc is a good indicator of light
    interception, which is a strong driver of ETc [48]. Weighing lysimeter observations
    by Bryla et al. [102] revealed a strong relationship between Fc and ETc for vegetable
    crops in California’s San Joaquin Valley, and the potential for using satellite-based
    Fc to estimate ETc in vegetable crops was demonstrated by Johnson and Trout [103].
    Fc can be estimated from various spectral visible-region bands, where chlorophyll
    absorption dominates, combined with near-infrared (NIR), where vegetation is highly
    reflective. A common formulation is the normalized difference vegetation index,
    or NDVI, which is derived as (NIR − red)/(NIR + red) [104]. Trout et al. [105]
    and Johnson and Trout [103] found a strong relationship between NDVI and Fc for
    vegetables and other crop types in California’s San Joaquin Valley. NDVI began
    to lose sensitivity above 80 percent cover, a point generally regarded as effective
    full cover for water management applications [106]. As above, interpolation can
    be applied to estimate NDVI, and hence ETc, for days between satellite overpasses
    as needed. 7. Satellite Based Irrigation Management Services 7.1. Prototype Systems
    By furnishing field scale estimates of Fc, a key factor for estimating Kcb and
    basal ETc (ETcb), optical remote sensing may potentially improve the accuracy
    of ET estimates in vegetables. Several satellite-based models have been developed
    for irrigation management. An early proof-of-capability satellite demonstration
    on wheat and corn was undertaken by the DEMETER project in Europe, which involved
    timely delivery of Landsat-based crop coefficients to agricultural end-users,
    with available online visualization and analysis capabilities [107]. More recently,
    the fully-automated Satellite Irrigation Management Support (SIMS) [108] uses
    atmospherically corrected Landsat data to map NDVI, Fc, and Kcb for multiple crop
    types, including vegetables across about eight million acres of California irrigated
    farmland [109]. These variables are updated every eight days at 30 m spatial resolution
    (cloud cover and data availability permitting) from 2010 to the present. The SIMS
    uses daily 2 km ET0 statewide grids produced by the California Irrigation Management
    Information System [53] to generate basal crop ET. Web data services allow users
    to display annual time-series graphs and download data for any given location
    (Figure 3). An application programming interface (API) enables on-demand transfer
    of SIMS data products to support external irrigation advisory services such as
    CropManage and also allows the user and other software tools to specify the crop
    type via the API and retrieve crop-specific Kcb data from SIMS. Where information
    is available on applied water, an FAO56 based soil water balance model can be
    used to adjust for soil evaporation and crop stress and to retrospectively derive
    agricultural water use fractions at the field scale for the evaluation of irrigation
    management and system performance [110]. Figure 3. SIMS map of fractional cover
    of vegetable crops near Salinas, California as of mid-July 2016. IrriSAT [111]
    is a weather based irrigation management and benchmarking technology that uses
    satellite remote sensing to generate crop water management information in Australia,
    primarily for grape and cotton growers at present [112,113]. As with SIMS, Landsat
    is used to estimate Kc at a 30 m resolution. Unlike SIMS, Kc is derived directly
    from a single linear relationship with satellite NDVI. Daily crop water use is
    determined as the product of Kc and ET0 observations from nearby weather stations,
    and a seven-day ET0 forecast is also produced. The delivery platform, which is
    built on the Google App Engine helps irrigators track soil moisture and better
    manage irrigation schedules. In addition, IrriSAT facilitates the calculation
    of seasonal agronomic performance metrics, including the irrigation water use
    index and gross production water use index. Additional satellite-based services
    have been implemented Europe and Australia [114]. These include IRRISAT-Italy
    (as distinct from IrriSAT-Australia described above), EO4Water (Austria), and
    IrriEye (southern Australia). These services generally involve the use of optical
    DEIMOS 20 m satellite imagery to generate and deliver leaf area index with derived
    Kc and related map overlays within a browsing and querying toolbox [115]. Personalized
    irrigation guidance regarding crop water requirement is dispensed through a secure
    website, SMS, and email. End-users are able to provide evaluative feedback. A
    variety of crops are being tested, including vegetables, sugar beet, corn, alfalfa,
    and orchards. Earth Engine Evapotranspiration Flux (EEFlux) [116] is a METRIC
    implementation on the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform [117]. Landsat
    scenes from 1984 to the present are combined with gridded weather data to allow
    the analysis of most land areas worldwide. The products include maps of ET, associated
    energy balance flux components, and land cover. A time-series can be constructed
    by processing several scenes and interpolating between image dates. Automated
    image calibration for anchor pixels is offered in a Level 1 version to accommodate
    operation by non-experts, with some sacrifice in accuracy. A Level 2 version,
    which allows custom calibration by the operator, requires an annual license fee.
    EEFlux is a general tool that operates on both agricultural and non-agricultural
    land cover types. 7.2. Satellite Remote Sensing Considerations for Irrigation
    Scheduling Satellite observation is recognized as a useful tool that will continue
    to support crop coefficient development and ET monitoring for new types and varieties
    of crops, as facilitated by the wider availability of gridded weather data and
    continued advancement in convenient and user-friendly mapping technologies [118].
    The use of public domain satellites with open-data policies, i.e., the data source
    is available at no charge, is an advantage of this approach, as is the capability
    to collect data for many fields simultaneously. Vegetable crops, however, do present
    some unique challenges for satellite-based evaluation. The frequency of satellite
    overpasses, presence of cloud cover, and added time needed to perform custom atmospheric
    correction (e.g., Vermote and Saleous [119]) may limit the use of remote sensing
    for real time irrigation scheduling of fast-growing vegetable crops. As more satellite
    platforms become available, such as the European Space Agency Sentinel-2 system,
    the observation interval between images may soon decrease to four to five days
    for NDVI-based ET models. Also, upon further testing, it may be shown that use
    of a simplified atmospheric correction approach (e.g., Tasumi et al. [120]) may
    be adequate for application in some or most regions. Where real-time irrigation
    scheduling operations are unsupported, remote sensing may still prove useful for
    the retrospective evaluation of irrigation system performance or compilation of
    water use metrics. Another challenge is the typically small field size for vegetables
    as noted above (4–5 ha), which is near the minimum land area recommended for evaluation
    by Landsat or other public Earth observation satellites. An additional challenge
    is posed by leaf color, especially for crops such as red lettuce that depart widely
    from the green-leaf norm. A recent study has also shown that while NDVI was strongly
    related to Fc in both leafy greens (r2 = 0.88) and cole crops (r2 = 0.93), the
    relationships were different [121]. Thus, the development of customized relationships
    between NDVI and Fc by crop category is recommended to increase the accuracy of
    Fc estimates. 8. Remote Sensing Using Manned Aircraft and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
    (UAV) The use of manned aircraft and UAVs for monitoring vegetables has become
    a viable alternative or complement to satellite observation. Image resolution
    is generally much finer than that of Landsat or other open-data satellites, and
    passes over fields can be scheduled on a more frequent and flexible basis. However,
    data calibration to assure image consistency in support of time-series observations
    may be lacking. Several commercial companies offer NDVI and thermal spectrum images
    at <1 m resolution taken at weekly intervals using small planes in California
    and elsewhere (e.g., CERESimaging Inc., Oakland, CA, USA; TerrAvion Inc., San
    Leandro, CA, USA). Images can be accessed from the web generally within 24 h of
    collection. The high resolution of these scenes can provide enhanced information
    about within-field spatial variability in crop growth and water stress and for
    determining Fc used to parameterize ET equations. Patterns can show when a crop
    is under-irrigated such as in Figure 4, where the NDVI values for a romaine lettuce
    crop are lowest midway between sprinkler lines, presumably caused by poor irrigation
    distribution uniformity. Figure 4. NDVI image of a romaine lettuce field irrigated
    with sprinklers on lateral pipes (A) spaced 12.2 m apart; Plants were frequently
    smaller in areas midway between pipes (B) where the NDVI values were low. Photo
    credit: CERESimaging Inc., Oakland, CA, USA. The acquisition costs of UAVs and
    the training needed for mission planning, flight operation, and image processing
    have diminished significantly during recent years. A number of studies describe
    the use of UAVs for monitoring water stress [122,123] and vegetative cover [124,125]
    of crops, though few have specifically focused on vegetables. Due to the ease
    of operation, arranging flights at specific times and locations with UAVs may
    be simpler than with manned aircraft, which usually need to image a minimal number
    of fields to justify flight costs. This flexibility may be useful in vegetables
    when timely field scouting is needed to make decisions or diagnose a problem with
    a fast-growing crop. UAVs can fly at very low altitudes and carry sensor packages
    that can provide high-resolution imagery in the order of a few centimeters. A
    disadvantage of UAV operation, in the case of an owned system, would be a higher
    up-front cost than the engagement of a manned aircraft provider and additional
    time required for data retrieval and image processing. 9. Conclusions Water scarcity
    will most likely continue to be a significant problem in many of the important
    vegetable production regions of the world [126]. Improving water use efficiency
    through more accurate scheduling of irrigation can conserve water and address
    water quality impacts associated with commercial vegetable operations. However,
    irrigation scheduling in vegetables presents some unique challenges due to the
    diversity of crop types, intensive rotations, and number of fields that must be
    managed, as well as competing cultural operations that are involved in growing
    marketable crops. Advances in soil moisture sensors, wireless communications,
    ET measurements, remote sensing, computer technology, and cloud computing offer
    many potential opportunities to develop robust irrigation advisory tools to help
    farmers accurately determine and meet crop water needs. While much progress has
    already been made in soil moisture sensing and ET-based irrigation scheduling,
    achieving wide-scale adoption in the vegetable industry will require continued
    innovation. Continued collaboration between public research institutions, universities,
    commodity boards, and commercial firms will likely be needed to develop simple-to-use
    tools that will be broadly accepted by vegetable growers. Acknowledgments The

  description: 'Water resources are under growing pressures globally. Sustainable
    water management requires good understanding of water resources, e.g. where water
    is stored and used, and how future developments may impact on water availability.
    Developing this understanding requires investment in data, models, and experts,
    often over multi-year timeframes. In the context of developing countries, in particular
    those with institutional gaps in the water sector, these challenges are difficult
    to overcome. In this paper we discuss Basin Futures, a response to four issues
    faced by institutions and water policy makers in developing countries: data availability,
    capability, capacity and costs. In Basin Futures, we aim to accelerate the progression
    toward detailed basin planning by offering access to data sets and models that
    facilitate the initial stages of basin planning. Basin Futures is a web based
    modelling platform that brings together global and local datasets to support water
    planning in developing countries. The system is designed to leverage investment
    in existing data (global and local), and then use this to empower decision-makers
    to understand the opportunities and constraints in managing their water resources.
    Basin Futures provides an enabling environment for planning, cooperation and participation
    in water management. It allows defensible decisions to be made at a level that
    is supported by available data. With the increasing availability and range of
    global data, e.g. from satellites, and technologies such as cloud computing, there
    is an opportunity to perform faster water assessments as an early stage of a large
    water assessment cycle. We have a developed a cloud-based approach that aims to
    give users a quicker route to an initial understanding of water resources in basins.
    Basin Futures integrates a range of global datasets, include HydroSHEDS, global
    precipitation, and river discharge observations, with models built for use in
    a cloud environment. Together with a web-based application, this allows users
    to make an initial estimate of current water resources. Core to the value of Basin
    Futures is that it provides user-customisable scenarios that allow dynamic exploration
    of future scenarios, for example, construction of new storages, changes to irrigation
    practices, population growth, and climate change scenarios. Users are then able
    to visualise impacts on water-related security indices. The model engine is a
    reach-based model - rather than a node-link model - where the demands are only
    associated with local (reach) storages and there is no support for upstream ordering
    of water or for exploring ground and surface water interactions. This is a deliberate
    choice to create a system that runs fast enough in web time and provides the user
    with an initial understanding of the water resources in unregulated systems. This
    streamlined approach to water resource assessments gives users a powerful starting
    point for positioning future investments in new knowledge and planning activities.
    The outputs will also guide where more definitive answers, and data, will be required
    by the appropriate use of more powerful software. This paper details the driving
    requirements for the Basin Futures, the underling model, and the implementation
    using modern web technologies.'

    small-scale soil moisture and crop water stress monitoring technology, medium-scale
    crop evapotranspiration quantification and estimation, and large-scale remote
    sensing including estimation of soil moisture, inversion and prediction for evapotranspiration
    were analyzed in detail. For the small-scale, different soil moisture detection
    methods were compared, including oven-dried method, neutron method, near-infrared
    reflectance method, tensiometer method and dielectric method. Typical equipments
    and sensors produced for the methods by different companies were also listed.
    In terms of crop water stress monitoring technology, 2 categories method such

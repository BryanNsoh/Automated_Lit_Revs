    sensors for real-time monitoring of field water level would greatly facilitate
    the application of alternate wetting and drying (AWD), an irrigation water management
    technique proven to result to significant water savings and reduced methane emissions
    in lowland rice production systems. However, most of the commercially available
    wireless sensors are generally costly. This study developed a low-cost wireless
    sensor that can perform real-time monitoring of water depth and surface temperature
    in lowland rice fields under an AWD irrigation regime. The sensor is composed
    mainly of an ultrasonic depth sensor, a waterproof temperature sensor, a humidity
    sensor, and a Wi-Fi-enabled microcontroller enclosed in a PVC cap that can be
    mounted in AWD pipes. The sensor was tested under laboratory, pseudo-field conditions
    and actual field conditions. Results showed a relatively high degree of agreement
    between sensor and manual measurements of water depth under all testing conditions,
    with the error ranging from only 5.2% to 6.6% and RMSE of 5.0 mm to 13.5 mm. The
    performance of the low-cost sensor also proved to be comparable with that of the
    high-end sensor, exhibiting practically similar measurement accuracy and higher
    precision. The wireless sensor developed in this study can provide a low-cost

    systems during water-scarce conditions induced by climate change and climate variability.
    Keywords: low-cost wireless sensor; alternate wetting and drying; irrigation water
    management 1. Introduction Lowland rice irrigation systems are known to consume
    a considerable amount of freshwater resources, comprising a 34–43% share of the
    world’s total irrigation water and 24–30% of the world’s developed freshwater
    resources [1]. Rice cultivation is also identified as a significant source of
    methane emissions (CH4) due to anaerobic process brought about by its flooding
    nature, accounting for about 10% of the global non-CO2 emissions in agriculture
    [2]. In the face of climate uncertainties and hydrological extremes, it is therefore
    imperative that we adopt efficient water management practices in countering water
    scarcity issues to carry on with the production of food staple of about half of
    the global population [3]. Among the many alternative water saving techniques
    developed is the alternate wetting and drying (AWD) technology, a form of irrigation
    management where the field water level is being brought to a water level threshold
    in the soil subsurface, with 15 cm being the safe maximum, before triggering another
    irrigation event [4]. The AWD has been proven to be effective in reducing irrigation
    water consumption without significant yield compensations [5,6,7]. It was also
    reported to reduce CH4 emissions [8,9,10,11,12,13,14], and is therefore considered
    as a promising option in mitigating global warming potential from rice cultivation.
    Aside from the increased water productivity and environmental benefits, the application
    of the AWD irrigation has also been known to reduce labor requirements with less
    frequent irrigation [15], although the tradeoff brings about the challenge in
    constantly monitoring the field water level, often done manually, to ensure that
    the level will never get below the safe threshold. The advent of sensor technology
    and its application in irrigation has greatly alleviated this challenge by enabling
    remote monitoring. Recent developments in real-time monitoring of field water
    level have aided farmers and researchers alike in coming up with sound and efficient
    irrigation water management plans and decisions. Wireless sensors applicable for
    irrigation water management in rice fields have evolved in recent years. Most
    of the previously developed sensors are capable of monitoring field water level
    [16,17,18,19], together with soil moisture [20,21] and other climatic variables
    [22,23]. The developed technologies greatly vary in the usage of sensor types,
    communication protocols, and system architecture. While a number of wireless sensors
    have been developed, most of them are costly, especially those that make use of
    high-end hardware and cutting-edge technologies. Other sensor development studies
    of the low-end type, on the other hand, did not include rigorous sensor testing
    or published sensor performance results, thus failing to unravel potential problems
    associated with field implementation. Some other sensors are not user-friendly
    such that widespread adoption may become a challenge. With the availability of
    open-source software, different sensor types and wireless communication protocols,
    the opportunities remain vast in coming up with a variety of options for affordable,
    user-friendly, and effective monitoring systems for real-time water information.
    This study aimed to develop an alternative to existing costly sensors for real-time
    monitoring of water level in lowland crop production systems employing AWD. This
    paper presents the details of the sensor development and rigorous testing under
    laboratory, pseudo-field, and actual field conditions. Ultimately, the sensors
    developed in this study are intended to facilitate the wider application of AWD
    in lowland crop production systems in order to address issues of water scarcity
    and inequitable water distribution induced by climate change and climate variability.
    2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Sensor Development 2.1.1. Hardware The sensor unit
    was enclosed in a 4″-diameter PVC cap that was mounted on top of a 4″-diameter
    AWD pipe. The low-cost sensor is composed mainly of four sensor modules: HC-SR04
    ultrasonic distance sensor, DS18B20 waterproof temperature sensor, DHT11 temperature/humidity
    sensor, and the microSD card adapter module. Data from the sensor modules are
    integrated by the ESP8266 microcontroller which sends data to the online database
    through Wi-Fi. The sensor unit was also equipped with two Li ion batteries, a
    solar charger, and two mini solar panels. Figure 1 shows the connection of the
    sensor circuitry. Figure 1. Wiring diagram of the low-cost wireless sensor modules
    with labeled electronic components. For the microcontroller of the circuit, the
    Wemos D1 mini Pro was used. It is Arduino-compatible and has 11 digital input/output
    (I/O) pins. It has a built-in ESP8266 Wi-Fi module that enables the microcontroller
    to connect to the Wi-Fi network. With this, the sensor data can be accessed via
    the cloud. A microSD card adapter module was also integrated into the circuit
    to contain data in a text file for manual retrieval. The DS18B20 waterproof temperature
    sensor was used to monitor the soil surface temperature that could handle the
    field’s day-to-night temperature fluctuations very well. The sensor has a 4.7
    kΩ resistor connected in parallel between the power cable and data cable for the
    sensor to work properly. For the measurement of the field water level, the HC-SR04
    ultrasonic distance sensor was used. Since the microcontroller has an operating
    voltage of 3.3 V while the distance sensor works on 5 V, voltage dividers were
    placed in the form of 1.2 KΩ and 2.2 KΩ resistors. This is to ensure that the
    output voltage coming out from the echo pin is in the voltage level that the microcontroller
    can safely handle. Additionally, since the Wemos D1 mini Pro board has a very
    limited number of I/O pins, the distance sensor was configured to perform under
    a single pin operation with the use of the NewPing library function. Accuracy
    of distance readings was improved through iterations. For the power source, one
    TP4056 battery charger was used to charge two 3.7 V–2100 mAh 18650 Li-ion batteries
    connected in parallel, while two IN5819 diodes were used to prevent backflow current
    from the batteries to the solar panels. A 180 KΩ resistor was installed between
    the analogue pin (A0) and 5 V pin to serve as a battery gauge. The voltage readings
    of the sensor measured from the analogue pin were successfully validated by the
    multimeter readings. A printed circuit board was designed to interweave the sensor
    components altogether using less wires. It has also made the entire sensor unit
    to be compacted, conveniently space-wise for circuit packaging and field deployment.
    Figure 2 shows the fabricated prototype of the sensor and its intended installation
    with the AWD pipe. In total, 10 sensors were exclusively tested under different
    conditions: laboratory, pseudo-field, and actual field. The methodology of the
    testing process is elaborated in a separate subsection (Sensor Testing). Figure
    2. Low-cost sensor’s deployment setup and circuit assembly with labeled electronic
    components. 2.1.2. Sensor Programming Sensor programming was made using the Arduino
    Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Since the Wemos and Arduino boards have
    different pinout architecture, adjustments on pin designations were employed to
    make the Wemos codes work in the Arduino IDE. Necessary libraries were used for
    programming the different sensor modules. Scripts were made for offline and online
    data logging. For every sensor reading, the data are automatically sent to the
    cloud database and encoded into the text file created into the SD card at the
    same time. This serves as a backup in case of internet connection failure. With
    the microSD card adapter, most of the digital pins were used up to establish communication
    between the microcontroller and the SD card module. This has greatly limited the
    number of digital sensors that can be integrated in the circuit. Thus, the RX
    pin, which originally serves for the purpose of serial communication, was converted
    to function as a digital pin to accommodate DHT11. To save power, the sensors
    were programmed to be in deep-sleep mode and only read data in one-hour intervals.
    This was made possible by placing 220 Ω resistor between the D0 and RST microcontroller
    pins. Figure 3 shows the logic of the sensor operation. Figure 3. Algorithm of
    the low-cost wireless sensor operation. 2.1.3. Online Database and Alert Messaging
    Systems A web app, whose algorithm is shown in Figure 4, was developed using the
    Google App Script to receive data from the microcontroller. For every sensor reading,
    the microcontroller automatically sends the sensor data into the cloud. The data
    are directed into the designated Google Sheet of the end user for remote and real-time
    monitoring of temperature and water level in the farm. Real-time graphs of field
    water depth, temperature and humidity were created using the Google Sheet charts,
    which come along with other important information, such as date and time of data
    transmission, battery voltage, and total number of data entries in the database.
    A sample of the dataset is shown in Table A1, while the sample dashboard is shown
    in Figure 5. Currently, the database can accommodate real-time data from five
    sensors simultaneously, with each sensor having its own designated logging sheets.
    It can further be configured according to the number of sensors desired for use.
    Figure 4. Algorithm of the online data logging and alert messaging scheme of the
    web app developed using Google App Script. Figure 5. Dashboard of the online database
    showing real-time data of water level, surface temperature, and humidity, as well
    as the battery voltage of the low-cost sensor. Aside from the online data management
    system, an alert messaging scheme was also incorporated in the script to notify
    the users during emergencies. The alert system is triggered by the following conditions:
    when the water level is about to reach the safe AWD threshold, thus warning the
    farmer that the irrigation operation is needed soon; when the battery power is
    about to run out, thus urging the farmer to replace the batteries; and when the
    sensor did not send data past its expected reading time, advising the farmer to
    inspect the sensor on site. When one of the said conditions arises, an email is
    sent to the end user indicating the type of emergency that happened and the specific
    actions to be performed. The message also indicates the identification of the
    sensor that is currently needing attention. The AWD threshold level exemplified
    in the code, i.e., 15 cm, is the safe threshold usually adopted in most studies.
    Since the ultrasonic sensor measures the distance between itself and the target
    surface, the reference elevation follows the relative height of the sensor from
    the soil surface where it is being mounted. Thus, necessary adjustments have to
    be made to properly reflect the safe AWD depth threshold in sensor readings with
    respect to the soil surface. A 1 cm allowance was also given before the safe AWD
    threshold to set a grace time period between the time of warning and the supposed
    irrigation schedule. As for the battery, the voltage threshold was set to 3.2
    V. An even lower voltage level may already compromise the sensor performance since
    the Wemos D1 mini Pro requires a 3.3 V operating voltage. And lastly, the alert
    system informs the user if a specific sensor has failed to send data beyond its
    expected reading time. Once a new sensor data has entered the database, the script
    will log the latest datetime of entry and update the next reading time of the
    sensor by adding 1 h from the current date and time. After such, the script will
    evaluate if the current date and time has exceeded the expected reading time of
    the other sensors in the database. If a sensor has failed to send data for several
    consecutive hours, manual inspection on the field site is therefore recommended.
    2.2. Sensor Testing 2.2.1. Laboratory Test The setup for the initial sensor testing
    was designed in such a way that the water level sensor can capture the receding
    water level through time. The setup was made from readily available and low-cost
    materials. The 8 cm deep soil was placed in a 6 L plastic container with perforations
    at the bottom, equipped with graduations on the side, while the sensor was positioned
    on top using a leveled platform. The container was placed above a catchment basin
    that was designed to accommodate the water percolation losses. See Figure 6a for
    reference. Figure 6. Experimental setup of the sensor testing under (a) laboratory
    condition, (b) pseudo-field condition, and (c) actual field condition. The container
    was periodically ponded with water of about 6 cm deep whenever the surface water
    recedes to the soil surface. Two low-cost sensors were tested consecutively, with
    each test taking place for at least a week. Manual measurements were also taken
    hourly, at the same time the sensor data is transmitted to the cloud. Adequate
    manually observed data were collected during the test run to achieve decent comparisons.
    The test run was performed in an open space where the sensor can sufficiently
    access a reliable internet connection and experience no physical obstruction from
    sunlight. Sensor data and manual observations were then compared and plotted through
    time. 2.2.2. Pseudo-Field Test A 2 m × 1.5 m × 0.9 m micropaddy plot, as shown
    in Figure 6b, was established to serve as a test site for the low-cost sensor.
    The plot is situated inside the campus of the University of the Philippines Los
    Baños, with sufficient exposure to sunlight, managed with suitable pest control
    management, and has adequate access to the water distribution system. The borders
    of the micropaddy were completely sealed and made up of reinforced concrete. The
    plot soil structure was designed to resemble actual paddy field settings. The
    soil profile was composed of several layers: a 15 cm-thick loose clay soil at
    the top, followed by a 30 cm deep compacted clay layer, and a 5 cm-thick gravel
    at the very bottom. A drainage pipe was also equipped at the bottom corner of
    the micropaddy box to enable soil-water percolation, so as to simulate the water
    level fluctuations in the actual paddy field conditions. The drainage pipe also
    facilitated the release of excess water during excessive rainfall occurrences.
    Two AWD pipes were installed in the plot. One was used for manual observation
    while the other one was for automated measurement. Prior observations suggested
    that the ultrasonic sensor no longer performs reliably when mounted on pipes with
    lengths beyond 30 cm. This could most likely be due to the tendency of sound waves
    to bounce off on the sides of the pipe. When the ultrasonic transmitter is activated,
    the sound signal is being thrown at a certain beam angle whose edges can get in
    contact with the pipe perimeter. When this happens, the distance measured is the
    traversed distance made by the sound wave between the sensor and the point of
    contact, which completely misrepresents the field water level. Manual water level
    measurements were taken relative to the top of the pipe, similar to how the low-cost
    sensor measures the water level depths. During the implementation of the AWD irrigation,
    two sets of test runs were completed using two different units of low-cost sensors.
    One was performed during the early wet season (June to July) while the other test
    was executed during the early dry season (November to December). Each test run
    comprised about 15 days’ worth of observation data. Since the sensor is not flood-proof,
    it was elevated at 15 cm above the soil surface as a precautionary measure. Despite
    the occurrences of frequent rainfall and the application of manual irrigation,
    sufficient drying cycles were achieved nonetheless to enable testing of the sensor
    performance under the AWD irrigation regime in this setup. 2.3. Actual Field Deployment
    The actual field deployment was performed in one of the paddy fields in a rice
    production area located in Brgy. San Roque, Victoria, Laguna, Philippines, situated
    700 m from Laguna Lake. The area is characterized by predominantly clayey soils,
    and has an intensive production of rice that is regularly cultivated during the
    wet and dry cropping seasons. The rice field is irrigated using a shallow tube
    well (STW). The application of AWD is more compelling in this system as the farmers
    can greatly reduce fuel costs in STW pumping through less frequent irrigation
    during the dry cropping season. The field setup was composed of a 14 × 44 m2 basin
    plot. Five AWD pipes equipped with low-cost sensors were evenly spaced along the
    plot’s middle horizontal transect in line with the irrigation inlet. The manually
    observed pipe was installed in a highly accessible location within the plot, about
    a meter away from the bund to avoid measurement bias. A rain gauge was also installed
    in the field to monitor water inputs in the basin aside from irrigation water.
    The sensors were set to read water level data for every hour using Wi-Fi, while
    manual observations were made twice a day, i.e., at 8:00 am and 2:00 pm. A Wi-Fi
    modem and a 5 km-range Wi-Fi extender powered up by batteries were installed in
    the pump house located 30 m away from the plot. The sensor deployment was continuous
    within two weeks, except during the three consecutive days of a storm that transpired
    within the experimental period. Figure 6c shows a photo of the sensor testing
    done under actual field conditions. 2.4. Performance Comparison between the Low-Cost
    Sensor and the High-End Sensor After several test runs, the performance of the
    low-cost sensor was compared with a commercially available high-end sensor (Submersible
    Water Level Transducer). This test was done under pseudo-field conditions during
    the dry cropping season. The high-end sensor considered was a submersible probe
    that estimates water level based on the hydrostatic pressure. It was initially
    calibrated in a 1 L graduated cylinder by subjecting the sensor under different
    water level heads, both in descending and ascending manner, until a representative
    calibration equation was obtained. The low-cost sensor and a high-end sensor were
    deployed simultaneously in separate AWD pipes in the same micropaddy plot. A separate
    AWD pipe was also allotted for manual measurements. Observation time lasted for
    approximately 10 days. Several drying cycles were achieved in the micropaddy plot
    over the observation period to generate sufficient number of data points for comparison
    purposes under both wetting and drying conditions in the micropaddy plot. 2.5.
    Statistical Analysis The performance of the low-cost sensor was evaluated using
    various statistical indices such as percentage error, coefficient of determination
    R2, and root mean square error (RMSE). The distribution of errors was also analyzed.
    Preliminary analysis using the Shapiro–Wilk test showed that the error distribution
    between sensor and manual readings were nonuniform in most cases. Thus, the Gaussian
    kernel density function (KDF) was used in generating the probability curve of
    error distribution. Gaussian KDF estimates the probability density function of
    random variables in a nonparametric way. The mode was used as a more appropriate
    representation of central tendency, which was estimated by determining the maxima
    of the KDF curve. Other statistical parameters used were the standard deviation
    (σ) in assessing the data dispersion and sensor precision, and the arithmetic
    mean error (𝜇) in determining the measurement bias. Additional analysis was also
    made in an attempt to estimate the optimum number of low-cost sensors within the
    rice basin during the actual field test. The equation used was 𝑁= ( 𝐶𝑉 𝜀 ) 2 (1)
    where N is the optimum sensor density, CV is the coefficient of variation of sensor
    values, and ε is the maximum allowable percentage of error. This simple optimization
    equation is similarly used in optimizing the number of rain gauges in a catchment
    basin. The estimation of field water level in a paddy field basin and precipitation
    in catchments were taken in a similar context since both parameters are hydrologic
    in nature, have perimetrical boundaries, and require at least a millimeter range
    of accuracy. 3. Results and Discussion The following sections present the test
    results under different conditions in which the sensors were subjected in laboratory,
    pseudo-field, and actual field. To enhance clarity, the low-cost sensors were
    labeled with a number to identify the sensor unit being referred to in the discussion.
    3.1. Laboratory Test Condition Results from the laboratory tests are presented
    in Figure 7 and Figure 8. Sensor 1 exhibited error of 3.28% and RMSE of 0.46 cm,
    while sensor 2 had error of 6.62% and RMSE of 0.42 cm. Correlation between manual
    measurements and sensor measurements proved to be excellent for both sensors (R2
    = 0.92 for Sensor 1 and R2 = 0.98 for Sensor 2). They also displayed the same
    degree of dispersion (σ = 0.35 cm), signifying that both demonstrate similar precision.
    However, the two sensors exhibited different tendencies when estimating the water
    level. Sensor 1 mostly overestimated the actual values with mode Mo = −0.28 cm
    and mean bias error 𝜇 = −0.29 cm, while Sensor 2 mostly underestimated the actual
    values with mode Mo = 0.29 cm and mean bias error 𝜇 = 0.24 cm. Even though the
    statistical parameters of both sensors were nearly identical in magnitude, both
    of their central tendencies were on the opposite side of the error distribution.
    A closer examination of the observed and sensor depth values from both test runs
    (Figure 7 and Figure 8) indicates that Sensor 2 measured relatively shallow depths,
    between 3 cm up to 10 cm, compared to Sensor 1 with water level ranges between
    7 cm to 16 cm. It is important to note that the HC-SR04 ultrasonic water level
    sensor used in fabricating the low-cost sensor measures distances relative to
    where the sensor is located. Since the sensor is mounted at the top of the container,
    the reference elevation is the top of the container itself. Shorter sensor distance
    values mean deeper water levels in reference to the soil surface, while larger
    sensor distance values imply the opposite. Figure 7. Laboratory-based performance

    time, (b) comparison of observed and sensor values, and (c) error (observed-sensor)
    distribution with Gaussian KDF fit. Figure 8. Laboratory-based performance test
    of Sensor 2 showing (a) observed and sensor’s water level measurements through
    time, (b) comparison of observed and sensor values, and (c) error (observed-sensor)
    distribution with Gaussian KDF fit. To further investigate the relationship of
    the errors with respect to water level depths, a simple linear regression was
    made (Figure 9). The R2 = −0.45 suggests that there exists a negative relationship
    between sensor accuracy and water level depths, albeit being moderate. But this
    moderate correlation influenced sensor readings in the millimeter range of accuracy.
    One investigator claimed these instabilities to be due to the lack of monotonicity,
    an occurrence of miscommunication between the components of the internal circuitry
    when reading peak signals [24]. Shorter ranges are more prone to these instabilities
    since the sensor processor tends to miss out faint peak signals from the comparator,
    resulting in longer duration before the echo pin signal goes low. This anomaly
    consequently results in longer travel time of sound, which further results to
    overestimation of measurements. However, the range of critical values was never
    established in the investigation. Having sufficient time for the sound waves to
    travel between the sensor and the target surface is highly advised in minimizing
    the occurrence of this anomaly. In this study, most of the overestimates were
    observed in ranges above 9 cm, while underestimates mostly occurred in even shorter
    ranges (less than 9 cm). Nevertheless, the sensor performance still remains to
    be acceptable from the economic viewpoint. The performance values of the low-cost
    sensor are also comparable to the water level sensor developed by Xiao et al.
    [21] and IRRI and PhilRice [19], which they claimed to be also suitable in paddy
    field conditions. Figure 9. Comparison of errors of Sensors 1 and 2 with water
    level depth under laboratory conditions. 3.2. Pseudo-Field Test Condition Results
    of the pseudo-field test runs are presented in Figure 10 and Figure 11. The performance
    of both Sensor 3 (5.48% Error and RMSE = 1.35 cm) and Sensor 4 (3.79% error and
    RMSE = 0.79 cm) proved to be reasonably acceptable with respect to manual measurements.
    Both sensors incurred a very high R2 above 0.97, suggesting an excellent correlation
    between sensor and manual measurements. The modes of both sensors in the error
    distribution (−0.16 cm and −0.03 cm for Sensor 3 and Sensor 4 respectively) imply
    that the sensors mostly estimate the water level at a high level of accuracy.
    Comparatively, the statistical performance indicators for Sensor 4 were better
    than for Sensor 3. The RMSE of Sensor 4 may be deemed acceptable from the practical
    standpoint. However, the performance of Sensor 3 greatly deviated from the initial
    sensor test under laboratory conditions (RMSE = 0.46 cm, σ = 0.35 cm and RMSE
    = 1.35 cm). This may largely be due to a relatively greater number of data points
    collected during low water levels, which comprised a fine portion of the dataset
    used to compare with the sensor values. Figure 10 shows an apparent pattern of
    consecutive underestimation of water level values at deeper levels, which is a
    complete disagreement from the observations in laboratory tests. While the internal
    circuit anomaly affects the sensor accuracy, the presence of successive underestimated
    values is indicative of an involved systematic factor. Albeit having Mo = −0.16
    cm, the series of underestimated depths resulted in the dispersion of error on
    the positive side of the error distribution plot, consequently yielding a positive
    mean bias error of 0.41 cm. This occurrence may imply a possible problem posed
    by sediment accumulation at the bottom of the pipe in the actual field deployment,
    as had been observed during the implementation of the experiment in the micropaddy.
    The sediments may not affect the ultrasonic sensor readings at higher water levels
    [23], but the effect can manifest itself during low water level conditions. Unlike
    the automated pipe with a sensor on top, the free exposure of the manually observed
    pipe to the atmospheric conditions provide a faster rate of surface evaporation
    with direct sunlight and free air circulation, thereby reducing the residence
    time of shallow waters suspended with sediments at the bottom of the pipe. This
    occurrence was not highly emphasized under the laboratory conditions, since both
    the manual and automated measurements were observed on the same transparent container.
    The effect of sedimentation was only made evident by separating the manually observed
    and sensor-equipped pipes. Figure 10. Pseudo-field-based performance test of Sensor
    3 showing (a) observed and sensor’s water level measurements, (b) comparison of
    observed and sensor values, and (c) error (observed-sensor) distribution with
    Gaussian KDF fit. Figure 11. Pseudo-field-based performance test of Sensor 4 showing
    (a) observed and sensor’s water level measurements, (b) comparison of observed
    and sensor values, and (c) error (observed-sensor) distribution with Gaussian
    KDF fit. Other than sedimentation, pipe settling was also observed during the
    test run of Sensor 3. Depending on the degree of the soil cultivation done, the
    AWD pipe can also recede in the soil subsurface concurrently with the soil settlement
    as caused by the subsequent irrigation and drying cycles. The additional weight
    imposed by the sensor on top of the pipe may have also influenced the pipe recession,
    resulting to sensor measurement offsets from the manual observations. 3.3. Actual
    Field Deployment The results of the performance of the low-cost sensors installed
    under actual field conditions are presented in Figure 12. Sensor measurements
    exhibited a good correlation with manual measurements (R2 = 0.75) and showed an
    acceptable RMSE (0.90 cm). The average error (5.22%) also did not differ largely
    from the determined percentage errors in laboratory and pseudo-field conditions.
    The mode from the error distribution (Mo = 0.38) signifies that the sensors finely
    underestimated the actual depth in most cases, but the occasional overestimates
    were relatively large enough to draw the mean bias error (−0.27) into the negative
    side of the error distribution. The error dispersion (σ = 1.15 cm), however, may
    be the combined effect of many elements, including the tendency of the sensor
    itself to overestimate water levels at deeper depths, and the environmental factors
    in the actual field conditions. It may also be the reflection of slight water
    level variation in the field, considering the relative distances and placements
    of the sensors from one another. Moreover, a relatively low CV of 4.46% suggests
    that the data variation is highly acceptable. Using the same value of CV and assuming
    a 10% maximum allowable error, the optimum number of sensors N for the plot size
    considered becomes 0.20, which if rounded up to a practical value of N = 1 suggests
    that a single sensor is sufficient to monitor the field water level in the 14
    × 44 m2 plot to generate at least 90% accuracy. It should be noted, however, that
    the optimum N may also vary with microtopographic variations and bund integrity
    among other factors, along with the desired accuracy of measurement. Further investigations
    are therefore recommended to establish the relationships between N and the aforementioned
    factors. Figure 12. Performance of the low-cost sensors in actual paddy field
    conditions showing (a) observed and sensors’ field water level measurements, (b)
    comparison of observed and sensors’ values, and (c) error (observed-sensor) distribution
    with Gaussian KDF fit. Aside from accurately representing the actual water level,
    the low-cost sensors were also able to provide a more defined pattern of water
    level fluctuations due to higher temporal resolution. This added information in
    between manual observation gaps can greatly facilitate the analysis of water balance
    dynamics in rice fields on an hourly basis, which is challenging to perform if
    the measurements are to be done manually. It can properly reflect water level
    fluctuations due to rainfall or irrigation, and water surface-subsurface recession
    due to water losses. Thus, the data generated by the low-cost sensor developed
    in this study can be used in the analysis of water fluxes and water balance in
    the field. 3.4. Performance Comparison between the Low-Cost Sensor and High-End
    Sensor The performance comparison between the low-cost sensor developed in this
    study and a selected commercially available high-end sensor was performed in the
    micropaddy plot to facilitate measurements. Results are shown in Figure 13. Both
    sensors exhibited excellent correlation with the observed values (R2 = 0.96 for
    high-end and R2 = 0.98 for low-cost sensor) and relatively low RMSE (1.31 cm for
    high-end and 0.80 cm for low-cost sensor). Results further revealed that both
    the low-cost sensor and the high-end sensor mostly tend to reflect the actual
    water level, with Mo of 0.03 cm and 0.06 cm, respectively. Based on the previous
    sensor tests done, these modes are exceptionally accurate. However, the two sensors
    exhibited different error dispersion, with the high-end sensor (σ = 1.11 cm) showing
    wider spread than the low-cost (σ = 0.65 cm). The error dispersion of the high-end
    sensor resulted in less superior performance (%Error = 6.86; RMSE = 1.31 cm) than
    the low-cost (%Error = 5.16; RMSE = 0.80 cm). The high-end sensor’s data dispersion
    may be due to the extreme sensitivity of the sensor to pressure changes, particularly
    in higher water levels. The water turbidity may also have a direct influence on
    this sensitivity, although further investigations are necessary. On the other
    hand, there is still a tendency for the low-cost sensor to underestimate water
    level on shallow depths, with a local maximum of 1.10 cm. Nevertheless, Mo = 0.06
    cm remains more dominant, suggesting a higher tendency for accurate readings.
    While further tests under actual field conditions may be necessary, the results
    from this test under pseudo-field conditions further prove that the performance
    of the low-cost wireless sensor developed in this study is practically at par
    with that of the high-end sensor. Figure 13. Performance comparison of Sensor
    10 (low-cost) and high-end sensor showing (a) observed and sensors’ water level
    measurements, (b) comparison of observed and sensors’ values, and (c) error (observed-sensor)
    distribution with Gaussian KDF fit. 3.5. Strengths and Limitations of the Developed
    Low-Cost Wireless Sensor The use of noncontact-type sensors, such as the ultrasonic
    sensor of the low-cost, in measuring field water depths has the advantage in the
    paddy field setting. In contrast to the probe type sensors, the low-cost sensor
    is not prone to corrosion and hardware malfunction due to sedimentation problems.
    This was further supported by Chiu and Reba [15] in their findings. The low-cost
    sensor also makes use of less wires exposed outside of the sensor case, thus it
    is less likely to be damaged by field pests such as rodents. The sensor is also
    easy to use and maintain. The database system and alert messaging services can
    also be accessed free for as long as the Wi-Fi connection is available. Affordability
    is also one of the low-cost sensor’s most distinctive advantages over high-end
    sensors. While the low-cost wireless sensor exhibits several advantages in terms
    of performance and costs, it still has a number of limitations. Firstly, the low-cost
    sensor does not have a real-time clock due to limited I/O pins; hence, the data
    encoded in the text file have no date and time stamps. However, manual data sorting
    can still be done by holding on to the logic of hourly sensor reading and comparing
    the data log entries in the text file with the online database entries. Secondly,
    the low-cost sensor is Wi-Fi-based, which makes the sensor range limited. Its
    application in rice field areas situated in off-grid communities would therefore
    pose a challenge. Obviously, the low-cost sensor, such as the high-end sensors,
    can only be effective in agricultural areas with a power source and Wi-Fi or at
    least signal extenders. Thirdly, the quality of Wi-Fi connection in the field
    may be affected by the rice canopy if the low-cost sensor is not placed strategically
    in the field. Fourthly, the low-cost sensor is not flood-proof, which makes it
    more viable to use during the dry cropping season. These identified limitations
    could serve as a basis for further research and development. 4. Conclusions The
    low-cost wireless sensor developed and tested in this study can provide reliable
    information of paddy field water level in real-time to facilitate the application
    of AWD in rice production systems. Laboratory tests and analysis showed that the
    sensors developed can generate accurate readings. The pseudo-field test additionally
    revealed the influence of sedimentation and pipe settlement in sensor readings,
    causing measurement offsets from manual observations. When applied under actual
    field conditions, the low-cost sensor performed reasonably well from the practical
    standpoint, in spite of several environmental factors affecting the sensor accuracy.
    The performance of the low-cost sensor also proved to be comparable with that
    of the high-end sensor, exhibiting practically similar measurement accuracy and
    higher precision. Considering the low-cost sensor’s tested performance and economic
    edge, it can prove useful in the efficient irrigation water management in lowland
    rice crop production systems in developing countries, particularly during the
    dry season and under water-scarce conditions as a result of climate change and
    climate variability. Ultimately, the low-cost sensor can serve as a tool for climate
    change adaptation and mitigation strategies in lowland rice crop production systems
    through the AWD technology. Author Contributions K.M.S.D.C.: Conceptualization,

    based on lowland rice field scenarios. Irrigation advance times were observed

    simulation 1. Introduction Basin irrigation of lowland rice consumes huge quantities
    of water due to its continuous flooding nature. In view of the threats of water
    scarcity to sustainability, food production, and ecosystems services of rice fields,
    alternative water management practices have been developed (Bouman et al., 2007).
    These practices include alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation, which is
    a form of irrigation management wherein the field water level is allowed to decline
    down to a safe water level threshold below the ground surface before triggering
    another irrigation event. This results to less water use and a longer irrigation
    interval as compared to usual irrigation practices. Past studies have demonstrated
    the benefits of AWD. Among the most notable and highly cited studies include that
    of Lampayan et al. (2015) which provided empirical evidence that AWD could lead
    to huge water savings without significantly affecting grain yield. An alternative
    to direct measurements and monitoring of water level fluctuations in AWD-irrigated
    rice fields is through the use of water balance models. In simulating the soil-water
    dynamics of basin irrigation system, one can opt to use traditional surface irrigation
    simulation programs or soil-water hydrologic modeling platforms, depending upon
    the goal of the study. In the traditional surface irrigation models, the surface
    water flow is described based on mathematical equations of continuity and momentum.
    It gives more emphasis on the details of the horizontal water movement above the
    soil surface, and also models the vertical soil-water movement in an overly simplified
    manner by considering the infiltration values as mere representation of the subsurface
    flow. On the contrary, the existing soil-water hydrologic modeling platforms simulate
    the soil-water movement in an explicit detail but lacks the capability in covering
    the surface water flow in basin irrigation setting. Between the two methods of
    simulation, the use of soil-water hydrologic modeling platforms is the most widely
    used for basin irrigation under AWD as suggested in various literature (e.g. Tan
    et al., 2013; Li et al., 2017; Darzi-Naftchali et al., 2017, among others). Most
    investigators of AWD irrigation look more upon the crop water use efficiency and
    the effect of drying cycles on the rice crop welfare, and that evaluating the
    basin irrigation performance under AWD in the context of surface irrigation modeling
    is somewhat rare. Nevertheless, the use of mathematical models in surface flow
    hydraulics play an important role in system irrigation design, management, and
    evaluation. However, there are certain limitations on the application of traditional
    surface flow models in AWD-irrigated basin. Traditional surface irrigation models
    operate on the assumption that the entire amount of irrigation volume that goes
    inside the field is the same volume that infiltrates and percolates into the soil
    profile, thus eliminating the effect of crop factors and climatic variables in
    influencing the changes in field water level, or the soil moisture in general.
    This assumption is not applicable in basin irrigation system especially when considering
    the presence of plow pan layer that causes the surface water to stagnate for a
    long time, thus giving the crop evapotranspiration to comprise its fine share
    of influence in field water recession. Another limitation of traditional surface
    irrigation models is its use of empirical infiltration functions such as Lewis-Kostiakov
    and its variants like Mecenzev model (Zerihun et al., 2005). The parameters of
    the said infiltration functions are event-specific and cannot account for the
    initial soil moisture content, more so cover the soil moisture redistribution
    through time. Another limitation is its assumption on the homogeneity of the soil
    structure along its depth, thus completely neglecting the importance of plow pan
    in paddy rice fields and its effect on soil-water dynamics. These limitations
    of the surface flow models can be addressed by physically-based soil-water flow
    models. However, they lack the capability in simulating the surface flow dynamics
    that fit the basin irrigation setting which can be key figures in irrigation duration
    decisions and irrigation performance evaluations. Many researchers have recognized
    the shortcoming of using the traditional surface irrigation models alone and tried
    to address the problem by combining surface flow irrigation model with soil-water
    flow model (Schmitz et al., 1985, Tabuada et al., 1995, Wohling et al., 2004,
    Zerihun et al., 2005, Bautista et al., 2010, Banti et al., 2011, among others).
    Some even tried to couple a crop model to a previously coupled surface-subsurface
    flow model (Wohling and Mailhol, 2007, Wohling and Schmitz, 2007). Apparently,
    most of these studies are only applicable in furrow irrigation systems. Zerihun
    et al. (2005) also developed a coupled surface-subsurface flow model for the basin
    irrigation in lemon tree orchard while the coupled model of Bautista et al. (2010)
    was prototyped in borders and basins. Although applied in basin irrigation, the
    boundary conditions used in their models cannot meet the requirements of the paddy
    rice field setting. To date, no studies have yet applied a coupled surface-subsurface
    flow model in basin irrigation with rice-based cropping systems, let alone the
    ones under AWD irrigation regime where prediction of the field water recession
    up to the safe AWD threshold is crucial. This study aimed to develop a coupled
    model consisting of a surface flow model for the estimation of the irrigation
    advance, and a vertical soil-water flow model for the estimation of irrigation
    recession along with the other water balance components in AWD-irrigated basin
    which could serve as basis for developing efficient irrigation water management
    schemes. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Site description This study was performed
    at the lowland pilot-test site of the PCARI-WISEIr project located in Brgy. San
    Roque, Victoria, Laguna with coordinates of 14°13''13.51\"N and 121°19''11.94\"E.
    The study area has a highly intensive production of rice, regularly cultivated
    during the wet and dry cropping season, respectively. A tropical climate system
    prevails in the area with significant rainfall during most of the months, usually
    between May to December, and with a relatively short dry period, usually between
    January to April. On the average, the site receives an annual precipitation of
    2084 mm and experiences an ambient temperature of 27.1 °C. Maximum precipitation
    occurs during the month of July (279 mm) while the driest month occurs in February
    with a rainfall depth averaging to 29 mm (Climate-Data.org, 2018). Almost all
    of the rice fields in the vicinity of the site are not serviced by the National
    Irrigation Administration (NIA) because it is situated at the downstream end of
    existing irrigation systems. Hence, a shallow tube well (STW) is used to irrigate
    the crop production area, owing to the presence of a highly productive shallow
    aquifer. Reducing fuel cost in pumping groundwater for irrigation provides a compelling
    incentive for the farmers in the area to employ alternate wetting and drying (AWD)
    irrigation technique during the dry cropping season. 2.2. Model development 2.2.1.
    Surface flow model The surface flow model is based on the analytical solution
    of the zero-inertia (ZI) equations of Schmitz and Seus (1990). The model assumes
    a moving momentum representative cross-section in the water body and accounts
    for the time-varying character of infiltration. The model also offers no restriction
    on the use of different infiltration formula, which makes it flexible in coupling
    with a subsurface flow model. Since the influence of the infiltration process
    on the momentum is accounted for, the governing equations for the ZI model are
    read as (Schmitz and Seus, 1990) (1) (2) where x is the horizontal distance, t
    is the elapsed time, (x, t) is surface flow depth, is the surface flow velocity,
    is the flow cross-sectional area, is the infiltration rate, is the hydraulic radius,
    g is the gravitational constant, and in which n is the Manning roughness coefficient.
    Multiplying both sides of the momentum equation with , and assuming that the momentum
    can be continuously represented by the momentum at the center of the water body
    ̅ , thus substituting for , , , and : ̅ ̅ ̅ , ̅ ̅ , ̅ ̅ , ̅ ̅ , leads to the equation
    (3) The analytical solution of Schmitz and Seus (1990) yields the following set
    of equations for and : (4) (5) ̅ ̅ ̅ ̅ ̅ where and are geometric coefficients
    of the flow cross-section, is the location of the advancing water front, and is
    equal to . It is worth noting that ̅ and ̅ are implicitly dependent on . The derivation
    of its implicit iteration relation form is shown in the paper of Schmitz and Seus
    (1990). Subsequently, by employing to the continuity equation leads to the equation
    for the flow velocity read as (6) ̅ For the determination of the center of gravity
    ̅ and , the following equations are used: (7) ̅ (8) where is the volume of water
    supplied in the field and is the volume of water infiltrated in the field calculated
    as (9) The value of is computed by the subsurface model (cf. the section entitled
    “Subsurface Flow Model”). Schmitz and Seus (1990) have provided the table of equations
    sequentially arranged for the iterative computation of the advance phase. The
    sets of equations were derived for rectangular borders and basins with , basin
    width , and . 2.2.1.1. Surface flow upstream boundary conditions For simplification,
    it was assumed in the model that inflow fluctuations at the start of an irrigation
    event is negligible and that a constant discharge is achieved right away. This
    leads to the simplification of to be equal to . For the initial condition, the
    following are assumed: (10) (11) (12) (13) 2.2.1.2. Surface flow downstream boundary
    conditions At the end of the advance phase, the boundary condition at the downstream
    end would be an impermeable dike. Thus, no surface runoff will be incurred outside
    the basin. The solution of Schmitz and Seus (1990) is only applicable during the
    advance phase. Thus, a simple volume balance calculation was employed when the
    advancing front had reached downstream dike. This assumption leads to the surface
    flow cross-section to be dependent on the inflow volume and infiltrated volume.
    It is mathematically expressed as (14) where is the basin length. The computation
    of the irrigation cutoff time was based on target irrigation depth expressed in
    the equation form (15) where is the cutoff time, is the irrigation advance time
    at the end of the field, and is the required intake opportunity time and can be
    determined by querying the program about the time when the last node in the simulation
    field is fully saturated with water. When the irrigation is cutoff, discharge
    at the inlet will have zero flow. The final surface water depth right after cutoff
    was computed based on and the field water recession at any point along the field
    was predicted based on the subsurface flow model. 2.2.2. Subsurface flow model
    2.2.2.1. Ponded phase Since the soil surface in the rice field is relatively flat
    and that paddy bunds are sealed with plastic lining, one-dimensional vertical
    water movement was assumed in this study. In this regard, lateral subsurface flow
    such as seepage was neglected, which leaves soil water fluxes along the soil column
    be described using the Richards’ equation combined with a sink term shown below
    (16) where is the volumetric soil water content, is the hydraulic head, is the
    time, is the elevation, is the saturated hydraulic conductivity, and is the sink
    term for root water uptake. The hydraulic head for porous media is commonly defined
    as: (17) where is the total dynamic head, is the elevation or the gravitational
    potential, is the matric potential as a function of soil moisture, is the hydrostatic
    pressure, and is the osmotic potential. But in the model, it was assumed that
    water flow due to thermal gradients and osmotic pressure are negligible, and that
    water is driven into the soil mainly by gravity, , and gradients. 2.2.2.2. Dry
    phase To account for the unsaturated conditions of the field under AWD irrigation,
    the soil water retention, , and hydraulic conductivity function, , proposed by
    van Genuchten – Mualem was used. The function is given by (18) (19) (20) (21)
    where is the residual water content, is the saturated water content, is the saturated
    hydraulic conductivity, is effective saturation, and , and l are pore connectivity
    parameters. 2.2.2.3. Evapotranspiration (Sink) The crop evapotranspiration was
    treated as a ‘sink’ just like in the approach of HYDRUS (Simunek et al., 2013),
    which is defined as the volume of water removed from a unit volume of soil per
    unit time due to plant water uptake. The Catchment Modeling Framework (CMF) has
    a way of determining the potential evapotranspiration from the precalculated series
    (Kraft, 2018). It uses the equation (22) (23) where is the potential root water
    uptake, is the potential root water uptake, is the surface area, and is the root
    mass in a soil layer per total root mass in a soil column. To properly account
    for the water losses due to evapotranspiration in different soil layers, the bulk
    evapotranspiration was partitioned on the soil layers based on its root content.
    This was done by determining the depth of rootzone directly from field measurements.
    Since the root architecture is hardly distributed uniformly all throughout the
    depth of rootzone, CMF applies the fraction-at-root-depth function that assumes
    an exponential decline of the root mass within the root depth. It can be any value
    between 0 and 1, with 1 having a uniformly distributed root content all throughout
    the root depth. In calculating the actual evapotranspiration , CMF utilizes a
    Feddes-like approach. This approach limits the water uptake of roots from soil
    layers based on the layers’ water content. The flux is assumed zero when the matric
    potential is below wilting point i.e. soil moisture tension of 15 bars or −152.96 mH2O.
    If the matric potential is below − 2 mH2O with an equivalent soil moisture tension
    of 0.2 bars, linear function of root water uptake is implemented towards the wilting
    point. This critical matric potential was based on the safe AWD threshold, which
    has an equivalent 15 cm water level depth from the soil surface (Carrijo et al.,
    2018). There is no water limitation if the matric potential is above − 2 mH2O.
    The mathematical structure of the conditions mentioned is shown below. (24) 2.2.3.
    Subsurface flow boundary conditions 2.2.3.1. Upper boundary The upper boundary
    of the soil control volume considered in the model is the soil surface exposed
    to the atmospheric conditions. The upper boundary condition in the field is given
    by the equation (26) where is the surface water depth and is the gravitational
    potential. Due to the boundary’s exposure in free surface, the boundary is affected
    by several atmospheric conditions brought by climatic variables and human influences.
    In lowland paddy fields, there is always the existence of ponding depth mainly
    caused by irrigation and rainfall. Accounting for the presence of surface water,
    the volume height function was used to relate the water level with its driving
    force potential. At the same time, the soil control volume is vulnerable to the
    evapotranspiration process. The term in the equation is thus dependent on rainfall,
    irrigation, evaporation, infiltration and subsurface processes like root water
    uptake and deep percolation. Positive water flux is experienced when having soil
    water entry like rainfall and irrigation, while there is negative water flux when
    having soil water exit from soil control volume, just like in the case of evapotranspiration.
    Large fluctuations in moisture storage and pressure head at the soil surface through
    time is to be expected in paddy fields under AWD irrigation. The maximum soil
    water entry into the soil surface will be numerically described using the soil
    matrix infiltration based on the Darcy’s equation defined as follows (27) (28)
    where is the maximum matrix infiltration, is the potential at the soil surface,
    is the potential at the middle of the first soil layer, is the conductivity of
    the wetted surface, is the conductivity of the first layer’s center, and is the
    elevation difference between the soil surface the center of the first soil layer.
    The actual soil water infiltration was considered to be the minimum between potential
    infiltration or current inflow to the surface which can be due to irrigation and
    rainfall. Mathematically, it is expressed as (29) 2.2.3.2. Lower boundary The
    water table was treated as an outlet boundary in the model. Prior investigations
    on the site’s static water table depth revealed a value of around 1.4 m which
    can recede by half meter during steady state pumping. This shallow water table
    is influential in driving the subsurface flow in the root zone depth. Darcy’s
    Law was used in estimating the flux at the root zone depth with the equation (30)
    (31) where is the bottom flux, is the difference of total water potentials of
    the two soil layers, L is the distance between two soil layers, is the geometric
    mean conductivity, is the cross sectional area of the flux, is the matric potential,
    and is the elevation or gravitational potential. Flux towards the groundwater
    table was regarded as negative since it is an outflow from the soil control volume.
    2.2.4. Coupling strategy The integration of one-dimensional surface flow with
    the vertical soil-water balance model was done using Python. The one-dimensional
    surface flow was based on the zero-inertia model while the vertical soil – water
    balance model was constructed using the Python package CMF. The flow chart of
    the model is shown in Fig. 1. Download : Download high-res image (438KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Flow chart of the coupled model. In the model
    testing of Schmitz and Seus (1990), the distance of the advancing tip was determined
    by discretizing time. However, this was proven by Wohling et al. (2006) to be
    prone to convergence problems due to the discontinuity of the infiltration process.
    The said authors then suggested to discretize space instead to determine the time
    of advance in every predefined distance. Hence, the distance was discretized in
    this study, and so as to match with the discretized computational nodes for the
    subsurface flow model. These nodes are individually capable of performing subsurface
    flow equations based on the soil physical properties and hydrologic conditions.
    Initially, the infiltration process was neglected, and an advance time was taken
    from an initial guess. This initial guess time , the time required for the advancing
    tip to reach the space node , will yield for an initial value of . The calculated
    was then used in computing for and ̅ , which are both inputs for the estimation
    of the revised using the implicit iteration relation form. The surface flow depth
    was computed by simply dividing with the flow width. Convergence is achieved if
    the absolute difference between the initial and revised value of is less than
    a precision criterion. For convenience, it was assumed in this study that the
    total inflow volume is uniformly distributed in the basin width, thus enabling
    the model to consider surface flow per meter width. Mathematically, the convergence
    criterion is expressed as (32) where is the tolerance value. In the program, a
    tolerance value of 0.001 was used. The final value of time and from the convergence
    was used as the upper boundary condition for the subsurface flow model. The infiltration
    volume estimated by the subsurface flow model from the given was then fed back
    to the surface flow model to estimate and , the values to be used for the next
    calculation step. The calculation procedure continues until the end of the basin
    length is reached. 2.2.5. Field data collection for model development 2.2.5.1.
    Water level and irrigation advance times Field experiment was performed in June
    to July 2020, the onset of the wet season. Two 14 m x 44 m conjunctive plots,
    labeled as Plots 1 and 2 in Fig. 2, under AWD irrigation were used for the experimental
    setup. The drying cycles were applied 14 days after transplanting. The 10 – cm
    high bunds covered with plastic lining to eliminate seepage losses. In each plot,
    five 4″ – diameter and 30 cm – long AWD pipes were installed 15 cm deep and were
    spaced evenly by 8 m along the transect of the field length. Soils were removed
    inside, down to the pipe bottom to let the soil-water enter the pipe perforations.
    Each of the AWD pipes was equipped with a sensor unit that can monitor water level
    with measurement accuracy of 6% error determined from laboratory tests, and surface
    temperature in real time. Specifically, the sensor is composed of modules of temperature
    sensor, ultrasonic distance sensor, and data logger modules all integrated into
    an ESP8266-based microcontroller powered by solar cells and batteries. The wireless
    sensors connect to the Wi-Fi installed in the pump house and the connectivity
    was amplified by a 5 km-range Wi-Fi extender. Since the site is situated in an
    off-grid community, both the Wi-fi and the extender were powered up by 12-V batteries
    that were alternately replenished from time to time. The water level sensor measures
    the distance between the surface water and the sensor itself. Since the sensor
    is being mounted on top of the pipe, every sensor reading has to be adjusted with
    respect to the elevation of the sensor from the soil surface to properly reflect
    the field water depth. The water level data was monitored hourly along with the
    data of temperature, humidity, and battery voltage. Online data were managed through
    Google Sheets, whose database was incorporated with an alert messaging system
    that can inform users about the irrigation schedule, battery state, and sensor
    malfunction. Shown in Fig. 3 is the schematic of the sensor setup and telemetry
    of the automated system. Another AWD pipe, which has similar dimensions with the
    automated pipes, was placed on the side portion of both plots for manual validation
    of sensor data. Manual observations of the water level were made for twice a day
    i.e. during 8 am and 2 pm. The sensor measurements were continuous within the
    two weeks’ time of the experiment, except during the three consecutive days of
    storm event that transpired within the experimental period. Download : Download

    The irrigation advance times along the field transect were observed manually,
    with the sensor equipped AWD pipes serving as the distance stations where the
    data are recorded. Irrigation in each plot was managed through an inlet whose
    discharge was measured using a current meter. Two batches of irrigation events
    were observed during the experiment. It is also important to note that since the
    experiment was performed during wet season, the occasional rainfall events hindered
    the water level from receding further into the subsurface. That is why the irrigation
    was already triggered even without reaching the safe AWD threshold. Nonetheless,
    the surface-subsurface water level fluctuations observed in the experiment still
    technically exhibited alternate wetting and drying schemes. The first batch was
    composed of an observation from Plot 1, while the data from Plot 2 was invalidated
    by a rainfall event in the middle of the observation. It should be noted that
    rainfall is not included in the assumption during the irrigation advance phase
    of the model. The water level was 5 cm below the soil surface prior the irrigation
    event. The second batch was composed of irrigation events observed in both plots.
    Irrigation advance times on one plot were taken after the other. The water level
    depth was observed at 10 cm below the soil surface. 2.2.5.2. Tensions, fluxes
    and crop data Tensiometers of 12″ and 24″ lengths were installed in both plots
    for the measurement of soil moisture at 10 cm and 20 cm depths, respectively.
    These tensiometers were strategically placed in the field to measure moisture
    at a depth of the plow layer and hardpan, and were designed to estimate tensions
    at 0–15 cm and 15–30 cm deep, respectively. Climatological data such as rainfall
    and evapotranspiration were also collected during the experiment. An 8″-standard
    rain gauge was setup to measure rainfall, while the water balance tanks were used
    to determine the fluxes of evaporation, percolation, and crop evapotranspiration.
    Small changes of water level in the tanks were measured using the micrometer hook
    gauge. Daily observations were made every 8 am and 2 pm of the day, the same time
    observation with the water level. This schedule is also in accordance with the
    standard set by the World Meteorological Organization at 8 + 00 Greenwich Mean
    Time (GMT). The rainfall input into the subsurface flow model comes in the form
    of fluxes, specifically in mm/day. However, rainfall depths observed in the rain
    gauge are the lump sums in between times which the reading was taken. With the
    hourly reading of the wireless sensor, the water level data from the wireless
    sensors were reflective of the soil surfaces fluxes. With this detailed information,
    one can simply determine the time of occurrence and duration of a rainfall event.
    Thus, the rainfall depth observations from the rain gauge were analyzed in conjunction
    with the water level data from the sensors in coming up with the rainfall fluxes.
    The water balance tanks were also used to measure soil-water fluxes. The setup
    was mainly composed of three 50-cm cylindrical tanks, made from galvanized iron
    sheet covered with epoxy paint. One tank serves for the measurement of the evaporation,
    the other one for percolation, while the last one is for the evapotranspiration.
    A similar setup was used by Sivapalan (2015), while Luyun et al. (2020) has termed
    the setup as the modified lysimeter. The evaporation tank is characterized by
    a 30-cm tall tank with a bottom cover. This tank similarly functions as a basin
    that is partially submerged in the paddy soil to approximate the surface evaporation.
    The percolation tank is a 50-cm tall and bottomless tank designed to protrude
    through the hardpan layer. This was made to ensure that the water level changes
    measured in this tank are representative of the downward movement of the soil-water
    onto the hardpan profile. The evapotranspiration tank has similar dimensions with
    the percolation tank, except for the fact that a rice crop is planted inside the
    tank. The water balance parameters were calculated as follows: (34) (35) where
    A is the flux reading from the evaporation tank, B is the flux reading from the
    percolation tank, and C is the flux reading from the evapotranspiration tank.
    Evapotranspiration readings from the tanks were fed into the subsurface flow model
    in time series. Pot experiments were also installed in both plots to monitor the
    progression of root depths through time. Root depth estimates were done prior
    to irrigation event. 2.2.5.3. Soil hydraulic properties The percolation data from
    the water balance tank were used to approximate the hydraulic conductivity of
    the hardpan layer. Aimrun et al. (2010) have termed percolation loss and vertical
    saturated hydraulic conductivity as the same parameters. The percolation tank
    was designed to protrude through the hardpan, thus making the assumption that
    the average percolation observed in the tank represents the of the hardpan layer.
    The soil water retention properties were determined in the laboratory using pressure
    plate apparatus. The soil samples were collected using the soil auger that is
    capable of undisturbed sampling. The collected soil samples were then transferred
    into the 5-cm diameter sampling rings compatible with the pressure plate dimensions.
    The soil samples were subjected to the following tensions: 0.1 bar, 0.3 bar, 1 bar,
    3 bars, 5 bars, 10 bars and 15 bars. Results from the pressure plate analysis
    were fed into the SWRC Fit, a web-based program by Seki (2007) that can generate
    soil-water retention curves out of pressure plate data. The program returned a
    van Genuchten curve fit with the pertinent values of saturated volumetric content
    ɸ, and pore connectivity parameters α and ɳ, 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Model
    calibration The coupled model was calibrated using the data gathered from the
    first four days of the entire experimental run. The subsurface flow model was
    calibrated first using the water level data from the sensors, followed by the
    calibration of the surface flow model using the first irrigation advance dataset
    observed in Plot 1. In the subsurface flow model, two soil layers were generated.
    The top soil layer was set as the plow layer, while the bottom layer was set as
    the hardpan layer. The depth of the plow layer was estimated using a steel ruler,
    while the hardpan thickness was approximated using the drilling rig test, which
    was a separate activity conducted at the experimental site. The pertinent parameters
    in the subsurface flow model, which are the soil saturated water content Φ, and
    pore connectivity factors and were determined using pressure plate experiment
    and were adjusted within reasonable ranges through manual fine tuning, with Coefficient
    of Determination (R2), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Absolute Error (AE), Standard
    Deviation of errors (SD) and Nash – Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) as the main objective
    functions. The tuning process involved adjustments of values through trial and
    error while keeping tab on the reasonable ranges of the parameters based on the
    values for clay soils provided by multiple investigators (Yang and You, 2013,
    Leij et al., 1996, Ghanbarian-Alavijeh et al., 2010, Zhang et al., 2018). Another
    important input into the subsurface flow model is the saturated hydraulic conductivity
    , which was approximated in the hardpan layer using the water balance tank readings,
    while the of the plow layer was initially taken from the values provided by Rezaei
    et al. (2012) which was also adjusted by trial and error. The fraction of root
    depth was set to 1, considering a commonly distributed root density along depth
    due to shallow hardpan layer (Kameoka et al., 2016). On another note, the only
    relevant parameter for the surface flow model is the Manning''s roughness coefficient,
    whose value was initially set at 0.05 taken from the simulation study of (Jung
    et al., 2011), and was also optimized by manual fine tuning. Performance indicators
    used were R2, RMSE, and NSE. The water level which was manually observed from
    the AWD pipe was used in initializing the conditions of the surface - subsurface
    flow model. The hourly data from the wireless sensors was able to provide a more
    well-defined pattern of the field water level fluctuations due to a finer temporal
    resolution. These added information in between manual observation gaps have greatly
    facilitated the model calibration process. The final optimum parameter values
    used in the model calibration are shown in Table 1, Table 2, respectively, while
    the model-predicted and observed surface irrigation advance times are shown in

    Fig. 4, Fig. 5 present the visual comparison between the coupled model-predicted
    values and sensor values for Plots 1 and 2, respectively. Subsurface flow model
    calibration results revealed a good match between the model-predicted and the
    sensor’s water level data in Plot 1, as attested by the several statistical parameters
    where the calibrated subsurface flow model had garnered 0.91, 0.79, 7.17 mm, 5.75 mm,
    and 4.23 mm for R2, NSE, RMSE, AE, and SD, respectively. On the other hand, the
    model had yielded less superior calibration fit with sensor values in Plot 2 with
    R2, NSE, RMSE, AE, and SD values of 0.74, 0.60, 8.78 mm, 7.51 mm, and 5.51 mm,
    respectively. The less superior calibration fit of the model under the Plot 2
    data is mainly due to the spatial water level variations measured by the sensors.
    A wider spread exhibited by the data from plot 2 may be attributed to the uneven
    hardpan depths as observed from the actual field works. The impact of this microtopographic
    variation was manifested in inferior model calibration performance values in Plot
    2 as compared to Plot 1. The effect of the non-uniform hardpan depths on the soil-water
    dynamics is further investigated on the validation part of this paper. Interestingly,
    the microtopographic variation may not be the only factor that affects the model
    performance; the error in sensor readings may partly have an influence as well.
    The water level sensor in the experiment makes use of ultrasonic pulses in determining
    the depth of the water surface from the top of the AWD pipe, highly correlating
    the sound’s time of travel with the traversed distance. Environmental factors
    such as air temperature and humidity greatly affect the speed of soundwaves. When
    the sensor is initialized, the sensor is triggered to release sound signal from
    its transmitter. The signal then traverses in an open space until it hits the
    water surface, and then eventually bounces back into the sensor’s receiver. Higher
    temperatures induce faster sound speed, consequently rendering shorter round trip
    time travel in between the sensor and the water surface. This occurrence results
    in an underestimated depth than the actual. On the other hand, the tendency of
    the ultrasonic sensor to overestimate depths was also demonstrated by Pilling
    (2015), pertaining to the instabilities to be due to the lack of monotonicity,
    an occurrence of miscommunication between the components of the internal circuitry
    when reading peak signals. The reported anomaly consequently results in longer
    travel time of sound than the actual, which further corresponds to overestimated
    values. After calibrating the subsurface flow model, the surface flow model was
    followed. Results exhibited a very good match with the observed data as reflected
    by a high R2 and NSE of 0.99 and 0.97, respectively and a relatively low RMSE
    of 3.14 min as shown in Fig. 6. The RMSE of the calibrated model indicates that
    on the average, the predicted advance time value is just 3.14 min off from the
    actual value, which is reasonably acceptable from the practical viewpoint. It
    is also worth noting that a single set of calibration parameters was used for
    both plots 1 and 2 due to the challenge imposed by the data acquisition itself,
    as what has been reported by Wohling et. al. (2004). Having the same set of calibration
    data is only within reason as both plots originally came from a single plot which
    was only subdivided into two commensurate plots for the purpose of replication.
    This also applies with the input parameters of the subsurface flow model. 3.2.
    Model validation The remaining portion of the entire sensor dataset was used for
    model validation. Specifically, the sensor water depth data observed in Plots
    1 and 2 starting from the fifth day up to the end of the experiment run were used
    for the validation of the subsurface flow model, while the second batch of the
    observation data of irrigation advance times in both Plots 1 and 2 were used for
    the surface flow model validation. Evaluation of the goodness of fit between simulated
    and observed values was carried out using the same performance indicators used
    in the calibration of both model domains. Fig. 7, Fig. 8 show the visual comparison
    of model-computed values with sensor values during model validation. Download

    Model-computed and observed water depth in Plot 2 during model validation. The
    validation of the subsurface flow model using the sensor data resulted to acceptable
    performance on Plot 1 dataset (Fig. 7) with R2 = 0.76, RMSE = 10.87 mm, NSE = 0.60,
    AE = 7.46 mm, and SD = 7.91 mm. Unlike model calibration, the values suggest a
    lower level of model performance. However, the statistical parameters are still
    within acceptable limits. The peak of deviation between the observed and predicted
    values can be found at the portion where the model falls short in emulating the
    water level rise due to the rainfall influx. The model demonstrated a prominent
    spike in water level, whereas the sensor values reflected the water level increase
    with a more subtle rise. We consider this circumstance to be mainly due to the
    two following reasons. Firstly, the rain gauge setup in the field is incapable
    of determining rainfall intensity and its exact time and duration of occurrence.
    As mentioned previously, the subsurface flow model requires rainfall intensity
    as input. The hourly time step simulation of the subsurface flow model comes with
    the price of providing in return a definitive influx details. In the absence of
    Automatic Rain Gauges (ARGs) that are capable of acoustic measurement, the rainfall
    data from conventional rain gauge were analyzed together with the sensor data
    to approximate the rainfall time duration. The magnitude of rainfall taken in
    every observation time was distributed over the time-duration at which the water
    level rise was observed. This analysis was applied in between reading schedules.
    However, this crude estimation of rainfall intensity tends to miss out the occurrence
    of consecutive rainfall events of different intensity and duration that transpired
    in between those reading schedules. This somehow limits the model from accurately
    depicting those types of instantaneous scenario. Secondly, we have observed the
    difference in rate at which the plow layer in between the two plots has achieved
    stability from cultivation. The plow layer in Plot 2 was able to stabilize faster
    than Plot 1. This achieved stability is characterized by increased bulk density
    due to settlement and subsequent irrigation. The change in soil property may have
    influenced how the plow layer reacts to surface fluxes, although more investigations
    are needed to further examine this phenomenon. The model-predicted values are
    more reflective of the water level spike exhibited by the sensor data in Plot
    2, albeit the time offset difference which may have been due to the rough rainfall
    time-duration estimate. However, the model displayed a relatively poor performance
    on Plot 2 sensor dataset (Fig. 9) with R2 = 0.81, RMSE= 11.08 mm, NSE= 0.32, AE= 10.00 mm,
    and SD= 7.15 mm. This unveils the limitation of purely relying on R2 alone as
    the sole indicator of model performance, as it only reflects the relationship
    between the movement of the model and datapoints but completely miss out the detail
    that they are moving on different levels. The unsatisfactory indicator values
    were the manifestation of Sensors 8 and 9 having significantly different water
    depth data at the same time, which may have been caused by the uneven hardpan
    depths observed in Plot 2. We look into this phenomena as a consequence of uneven
    hardpan depths observed in Plot 2. To investigate further, an attempt was made
    to improve the model performance by using the actual depth of hardpan where the
    sensor was located instead of the average value for the whole plot. Download :

    and observed water depth in Plot 2 during model recalibration. The recalibrated
    results, shown in Fig. 9, revealed a slight drop in performance values, except
    for the NSE that went from 0.60 to 0.63. The model at two different hardpan depths
    also showed no significant difference. However, a different observation is seen
    in the revalidation of the model. Fig. 10 demonstrates that the correlation remains
    fairly good, but the rest of the performance indices have improved, especially
    the NSE with a final value of 0.71 that is more than twice the initial value (NSE=0.32).
    This may imply that the effect of hardpan characteristics on field water recession
    is hardly detected during shallow water depths, but becomes evident when the water
    level goes deeper in the subsurface. The effect of the hardpan layer on root water
    uptake and how it can become the primary factor for vertical root growth restriction
    in rice ecosystems have been discussed on several studies (Clark et al., 2002,
    Samson et al., 2002). The soil layers in which the root can extract soil-water
    is limited to the extent at which the root can propagate. Naturally, deeper rooting
    system can extract more soil-water at deeper soil layers. The experiment of Yu
    et al. (2007) on maize have shown that the plants with a restricted rooting depth
    of up to 20 cm had a much lower rate of water uptake as compared to the plants
    with deeper rooting depth. This only shows the effect of impeded root growth pattern
    on the water intake capability of the plant. However, further investigation may
    still be needed from a plant physiological standpoint in giving light to the dynamics
    of soil-water recession as affected by the root growth dynamics. After all, evapotranspiration
    shares a large chunk of the soil-water balance output in the lowland rice field
    environment. Even with this current knowledge gap, one cannot simply deny the
    importance of the plow pan characteristics on soil-water movement in paddy fields.

    Fig. 10. Model-computed and observed water depth in Plot 2 during model revalidation.
    After validating the subsurface flow model, validation of the surface flow model
    was then performed. Fig. 11 shows the irrigation advance trajectories of the observed
    values from Plots 1 and 2 and the simulated values of the model as accompanied
    by the performance indices RMSE, R2, and NSE. Results of the validation revealed
    that the model fits agreeably with the actual data. All the predicted values suggest
    a very high correlation with the observed data as supported by high R2 greater
    than 0.976 and NSE greater than 0.88. The RMSE also suggests that the predicted
    advance time cannot be more than 6.12 min away from the actual value. Compared
    with the calibration, the performance of the model during validation slightly
    declined. The validated model generally predicted a slightly faster irrigation
    advance time as compared to the field values, with a particularly higher tendency
    to overestimate the time on greater horizontal distances. This observation is
    somehow similar with the finding of Schmitz and Seus (1990) in testing their coupled
    model despite using a different infiltration model. Another important factor that
    may have influenced a faster simulated irrigation advance time is the preferential
    flows caused by mudholes. It is important to consider that the irrigation events
    used for model validation occurred on a later date. Mudholes in both plots were
    inevitably made through time because of the frequent manual checking of the sensors
    along the transect of the field. This may have caused preferential flows in the
    soil during the irrigation advance, which is not considered in the model. Soil
    cracking may also be another factor to look at during the dry cropping season
    as the solar radiation is more intensive during those times. The shrinking of
    clay soils due to the rapid depletion of soil moisture in the surface creates
    spaces in the soil where water can easily pass through. The effect of preferential
    flows brought by soil cracking was also observed by Wohling et al. (2004) when
    conducting furrow experiments for their coupled model, increasing the soil infiltration
    rate which resulted to longer irrigation advance times. Nevertheless, the coupled
    model developed in this study still performs satisfactorily provided that the
    appropriate soil physical and surface hydraulic parameters are used. Download

    Model simulation for the wet and dry cropping seasons Different rainfall scenarios
    were formulated to simulate and project field water level for the rest of the
    wet cropping season (Fig. 12) and the dry cropping season (Fig. 13) using the
    calibrated and validated coupled model. The first scenario is when there is no
    increase in rainfall amount (normal), and the others are when there are reductions
    in rainfall amount by 25%, 50%, and 75%, respectively. For the dry cropping season,
    the same scenarios were made, with the additional + 25% and + 50% in the normal
    rainfall values. The historical records of daily total rainfall and potential
    evapotranspiration computed using FAO-Penman Monteith equation were distributed
    in the 24-hour period, while the depth of rice rootzone was set to 0.5 m all throughout
    the season as suggested by FAO (1998) for the minimum value of the maximum rooting
    depth for rice. Crop coefficients of rice in its different growth stages were
    adopted from the study of David (1983) to come up with the actual evapotranspiration
    values. Irrigation event was triggered in the model to obtain a ponded depth of
    3 cm above the ground surface before the water level threshold is about to be
    reached, and when the field needs to be constantly flooded for the rice flowering
    stage which can take place around 10–13 weeks after sowing. This is in accordance
    with the recommendations of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) that
    the field be flooded continuously a week before and after the rice reproductive
    phase (Bouman et. al, 2007). Download : Download high-res image (201KB) Download

    Fig. 13. Projected water level for the rest of the dry cropping season using the
    subsurface flow model under various rainfall scenarios. As can be seen in Fig.
    12, drying cycles are evident at −50% and −75% rainfall scenarios. The rainfall
    above −25% can keep the water level above the soil surface that draining the excess
    water is essential. This only highlights the fact that AWD practice is not really
    suitable during the wet cropping season in the experimental site even with the
    25% reduction in normal rainfall. The simulation further showed that the water
    level at 50% reduced rainfall can experience occasional drying cycles, but can
    still be maintained above the AWD threshold. However, further decrease in rainfall
    amount by 75% shows the need for irrigation water, although only once. The field
    under the − 50% and − 75% rainfall scenarios must be irrigated during the peak
    time of the rice reproductive stage. Simulated irrigation schedules revealed the
    need of one irrigation event for the −25% rainfall scenario, while 2 irrigation
    events for the − 75% rainfall scenario with an interval of 9 days. For the water
    level simulation in the dry cropping season shown in Fig. 13, the scarcity of
    rainfall events allows the alternate wetting and drying irrigation to take place
    every after 5–7 days following the disappearance of surface water. On the average,
    the irrigation interval during the dry cropping season is estimated to range between
    10 and 12 days for the AWD irrigation schedule, while approximately 4–5 days can
    be observed for the constant flooding schedule. In all of the scenarios considered,
    only the + 50% rainfall scenario made a deviation in schedule from the rest with
    a longer irrigation interval by one day. The rest of the scenarios produced almost
    identical results due to the excessively low rainfall amounts, that even a 25%
    change cannot make a significant difference. Results of the simulation revealed
    that the modeled interval values are within expectations based on the commonly
    reported interval of 1 to more than 10 days according to the past investigators
    (Bouman et. Al, 2007). However, it is important to keep in mind that the model
    only considers the vertical movement of soil-water flow, ignoring the effect of
    seepage losses which can further shorten the simulated irrigation interval. Aside
    from using daily totals of evapotranspiration, a better projection can be achieved
    by providing separate evapotranspiration rates between day and night, a feature
    which can be considered by the model. In this way, a more realistic curve of water
    level recession can be captured, with drastic slopes during the day and gradual
    changes during the night, as compared to the uniform decrease in water level when
    using the average evapotranspiration values. Furthermore, the rainfall intensity
    and its exact duration time can also be specified in the model since the subsurface
    flow model also considers the physics of the soil-water movement on top of the
    volume balance approach. With this, the model can capture instantaneous fluxes
    and sudden water level spikes due to high intensity rainfall events. Since the
    model can simulate water levels in an hourly basis, irrigation schedule can be
    forecasted in a specific time of the day, together with the irrigation inflow
    rate and duration, just like what have been done in the simulations. 4. Conclusion
    The coupled surface-subsurface flow model developed in this study can be used
    to simulate the irrigation advance and recession in AWD-irrigated rice fields
    which cannot be addressed by the traditional irrigation models. Results from the
    surface-subsurface flow simulation have revealed acceptable performance indices
    and portrayed a good match with the observed water level and irrigation advance
    time datasets. The simulation has further uncovered the importance of hardpan
    characteristics, and how it can affect water recession in the subsurface by influencing
    soil properties and root growth restriction. Furthermore, the model has shown
    its capability to project field water level under different rainfall scenarios
    for both the wet and dry cropping seasons. Climatological parameters and soil
    properties inherent to lowland rice cropping systems are important considerations
    when predicting soil-water recession in AWD threshold. This study has provided
    results that may lead to a better perspective on soil-water dynamics in lowland
    rice field, and has generated a useful tool for simulating water level fluctuations
    in AWD-irrigated rice fields for different anticipated rainfall scenarios. Ultimately,
    while further improvement can still be done, the model developed in this study
    could serve as basis for developing efficient irrigation water management schemes
    for lowland crop production systems. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors

  description: This study assessed the potential for adoption of wireless sensor technology
    (WSN) technology for irrigation water management of high value crops in the Philippines
    through market survey with farm owners and farm managers as respondents. Surveys
    were conducted in various regions in the country using non-random sampling methods.
    The survey basically includes questions about farm information, problems related
    to water management, familiarity with WSN, and willingness to adopt, among others.
    Based on the results, 83% of the respondents expressed willingness to adopt the
    WSN technology if properly demonstrated and if it will give a high return on investment.
    On the other hand, 76% of the respondents are willing to adopt WSN regardless
    of the costs provided there is a high return on investment. However, only a little
    more than half of the respondents are willing to adopt the WSN technology for
    the sake of modernization. Results also showed a strong potential for adoption
    of WSN technology using locally-developed sensors with 81% of the respondents
    providing affirmative answers. Chi-square test results indicated that sex, gross
    annual household income, membership to farmer's association, land tenure status,
    and familiarity with WSN technology are the primary determinants of the potential
    for adoption regardless of the conditions imposed. However, educational attainment
    also played a role in the adoption of WSN technology if the purpose is agricultural
    modernization and if there is a higher return on investment despite some budgetary
    allocation for the initial costs. Results of this study could serve as a basis
    for developing commercialization schemes, strategies for upscaling and for agricultural
    policy formulation.

  description: The evolution of smart phones has necessitated the development of mobile
    applications designed to perform a wide variety of functions. In the field of
    agriculture, mobile applications are currently used to monitor environmental parameters
    such as ambient temperature, humidity, soil moisture, water level, among others.
    A mobile application intended to monitor irrigation-related parameters and to
    control solenoid valves for irrigation automation was developed in this study.
    The mobile application was written using Flutter software development kit, and
    the Dart programming language. The mobile application communicates with the cloud
    server using a REST API written in JavaScript. The data acquired from the cloud
    server are presented as the current sensor reading and graphs. On the other hand,
    the mobile application controls the solenoid valves by sending designated bytes
    of data to the cloud server. The mobile application developed in this study was
    designed to be integrated with both low-cost sensors and the Smartmesh IP sensors
    to enable real-time monitoring and data visualization, and facilitate irrigation
    scheduling and manual irrigation control. The mobile application developed in
    this study may be used for efficient irrigation water management of upland crop
    production systems and for agricultural modernization in the Philippines and other
    developing countries.

    An agricultural water management system is defined as the supply of the appropriate
    quantity of irrigation water at the appropriate time to maximize crop yield, and
    efficient operation and maintenance are required to make the system effective.
    It is desirable to deliver the required quantity of water to enhance crop cultivation
    using irrigation facilities and canals in the irrigated area (Meijer et al., 2006,
    Ghumman et al., 2009, Aly et al., 2013, Ticlavilca et al., 2013). Approximately
    70,000 irrigation facilities, including reservoirs, pumping and draining stations,
    weirs, and tube wells have been installed in Korea to enable the efficient management
    of agricultural water (Nam and Choi, 2014, Nam et al., 2015). One major problem
    faced by irrigation facilities management is that these facilities are spread
    over an irrigated area at a low density and are difficult to access (Nam et al.,
    2011, Hong et al., 2016a). In addition, the operation and management of irrigation
    facilities suffers from low water use efficiency and the inequitable distribution
    of water (Phengphaengsy and Okudaira, 2008, Parsinejad et al., 2013, Yang and
    Chen, 2013). The total length of irrigation and drainage canals, important components
    of agricultural water supply planning, is 184,000 km. Irrigation facilities and
    irrigation canals face problems during operation, such as collapses and leaks.
    These problems require regular maintenance by the facilities manager during periods
    of irrigation. Because of the reduction and aging of the agricultural population
    and lack of facilities managers, irrigation facilities are often managed nonprofessionally
    by local residents. To overcome this lack of management resources, efficient agricultural
    water management requires the development of improved management methods. The
    above concerns have resulted in the development of various monitoring and management
    methods that use Information Technology (IT) to guide the rational allocation
    of water resources and water conservation (Verdoodt and Ranst, 2006, Quinn, 2011,
    Zia et al., 2013). The strength of IT is that user can be obtaining useful predictions
    outcomes for decision making, and this result data can be presented to managers
    in real time (Thysen, 2000, Vougioukas et al., 2013, Gandomi and Haider, 2015,
    Lopez et al., 2015). In recent years, the agricultural sector has become increasingly
    information-dependent, requiring a wide range of scientific and technical information
    to enable effective decision-making (Cash, 2001, Nam et al., 2012, Nam et al.,
    2016, Navarro-Hellin et al., 2015). Some researchers have developed reservoir
    monitoring and management systems that automatically measure water levels and
    flow rates based on code division multiple access (CDMA) and Zigbee technologies
    (Nolz et al., 2013, Aqeel-ur-Rehman et al., 2014). An automatic operation and
    control system for agricultural water management based on tele-monitoring and
    tele-control (TM/TC) was installed in some irrigation facilities in South Korea,
    such as reservoirs and pumping stations (MIFAFF, 2004, Hong et al., 2016b, Kim
    et al., 2016, Nam et al., 2016). However, agricultural water management based
    on automated control systems has been applied to a limited number of irrigation
    facilities and not yet to irrigation canals. These systems are not connected to
    any online monitoring system that provides central information management; therefore,
    facilities managers cannot obtain real-time data in the field. Irrigation facilities
    managers operate under considerable uncertainty due to lack of real-time current
    information, as most irrigation water management processes still rely on hand-written
    reports. An effective operation and management system should accumulate reliable
    data that reflects the current data and can be used to determine the operating
    status of facilities in the field. Irrigation water losses commonly occur in the
    water supply and distribution process through irrigation canals from reservoirs
    to irrigated districts because of facilities aging, construction defects, management
    neglect, and natural decay or damage. The effectiveness of the water management
    system depends on appropriate maintenance, including the early identification
    of warning signs in irrigation canals. Traditional manual irrigation facilities
    management has faced critical limitations, such as delays and losses in data handling
    and facilities misidentification. Additional limitations include the identification
    of the exact location of irrigation facilities with canal leaks in the event of
    an emergency, lack of knowledge regarding the operating history, and an inability
    to transmit real-time management instructions. Agricultural water use information
    and the operating status of irrigation facilities must also enable real-time information
    to be rapidly obtained in the field. Therefore, it could be more efficient to
    manage irrigation facilities using an integrated information system consisting
    of a wireless sensor network (WSN) and information and communication technologies
    (ICTs) to obtain the information required for the on-site operation of irrigation
    facilities. The application of radio frequency identification (RFID) and quick
    response (QR) codes to irrigation facilities management has vast potential for
    improving the ability of these systems to solve problems. In the present study,
    we examine the impact of improved availability of information technology on agricultural
    water management and irrigation facilities management. An efficient agricultural
    monitoring system can be used to monitor the real-time status of irrigation facilities
    on a regional scale. The primary purpose of this study is to develop an information
    system platform using ICTs and WSN technology based on RFID and QR codes that
    improves the operation and management of irrigation facilities. We propose appropriate
    methods for agricultural facilities management based on RFID and QR codes that
    can obtain real-time information about the status of irrigation facilities in
    the field. In addition, our newly designed integrated management code identifies
    facilities in agricultural plains by supplementing the current facilities standard
    code. The installation employs a methodology for guiding the development and deployment
    of RFID and QR code applications in agricultural water and irrigation facilities
    management. It thereby enables real-time communication between data collection
    and data management using the ICTs and WSN. The system was installed in the I-dong
    irrigation districts in Gyeonggi Province, South Korea. The results demonstrate
    the applicability of the WSN for agricultural water and irrigation facilities
    management can be used by experts to make decisions, such as those concerning
    irrigation policy. 2. Review of agricultural utilization of ICTs and WSNs ICTs
    and WSNs play an important role in improving the precision of agricultural technologies,
    such as real-time monitoring of crop, weather, and soil moisture (Blonquist et
    al., 2006, Pierce and Elliott, 2008, Diaz et al., 2011, Kim et al., 2011, Kim
    et al., 2014, Fernandes et al., 2013, Watras et al., 2014, Nikolidakis et al.,
    2015, Ojha et al., 2015). Meanwhile, over the past few decades, many researchers
    have dealt with the problem of the allocation of a limited water supply for irrigation,
    including studies of wireless sensor network to optimize irrigation water management
    (Kim and Evans, 2009, Ali and Kumar, 2011, Dong et al., 2013, Lea-Cox et al.,
    2013, van Iersel et al., 2013, Sesma et al., 2015). Therefore, ICTs and WSNs technology
    have been widely adopted in water management, providing numerous opportunities
    for applying wireless communications in agricultural systems (Kim et al., 2008,
    Vellidis et al., 2008, Chappell et al., 2013) and supporting the effectiveness
    and efficiency of irrigation facilities management. Irrigation facilities management
    typically involves manual identification methodologies. As manual identification
    is costly, time consuming, and error prone, researchers have attempted to address
    these drawbacks in recent years. The most promising technology seems to be tag-based
    identification methods, such as RFID tags and QR codes, because they require less
    manual intervention and offer a wide range of novel possibilities due to the ease
    with which they can interface with additional devices (Ilie-Zudor et al., 2011).
    Several tag-based identification technologies exist, including barcodes, visual
    tags, and RFID tags (Cunha et al., 2010, Badia-Melis et al., 2014). In our efforts
    to build WSN systems for irrigation facilities management, we focus on the capabilities
    of RFID and QR codes to enable identification while facilitating information sharing.
    RFID technology is a wireless sensor technology which is based on the detection
    of electromagnetic signals and the form of automatic identification (Domdouzis
    et al., 2007). RFID have been widely applied to traceability control and various
    monitoring, tracking management processes because of its ability to identify many
    types of objects, categorize, manage the flow of goods including manufactured
    goods, animals, people, and total product life cycle management (Ruiz-Garcia et
    al., 2009, Gebbers and Adamchuk, 2010, Voulodimos et al., 2010, Ruiz-Garcia and
    Lunadei, 2011, Zhu et al., 2012, Badia-Melis et al., 2015). It uses magnetic fields
    at radio frequencies for identification, location, and automatic data acquisition
    and transmission, including those in real-time for enhancing management (Morais
    et al., 2008, Sabbaghi and Vaidyanathan, 2008). The potential benefits of RFID
    are as follows: (1) it eliminates or improves the performance of routine manual
    tasks at reduced costs, and (2) it provides real-time information for better planning
    and execution (Kim et al., 2010). As shown in Fig. 1, the basic structure of the
    RFID system consists of four major parts: the RFID tag contains the wirelessly
    connected sensor nodes, which are located on the object to be identified; the
    RFID reader performs the identification; the middleware utilizes the information;
    and the server performs data collection and management. RFID tags are attached
    to the tracked item and have data (an identification number) stored in their memory,
    and can be used to gather data at any point in time about their immediate surroundings
    and the object to which they are attached (Finkenzaeller, 2003, van der Togt et
    al., 2011). Readers are the devices that read data from tags and they depend on
    the antenna, transceiver, and decoder (Jedermann et al., 2009, Mejjaouli and Babiceanu,
    2015). In general, RFID systems include specifications on the communication between
    tags and readers. The system is supported by middleware and networking services.

    Fig. 1. RFID system architecture (Voulodimos et al., 2010, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei,
    2011). The QR code open-source solution provides a simple and inexpensive method
    of encoding text information that is easily read using electronic readers. Because
    of the speed of data reading, accuracy, and functional characteristics, QR code
    technology and processing provide a fast and accurate tool for data entry; they
    can store a large amount of data in a small area to support information detection
    (Cunha et al., 2010, Querini et al., 2011). This study reports the construction
    of WSN systems for irrigation facilities management using the information stored
    by RFID and QR code technologies. 3. Materials and methods 3.1. Integrated identification
    code for irrigation facilities management Irrigation facilities management requires
    quantitative standards for the accurate identification of the status of facilities,
    including categories, location and operating time. Unique identification codes
    are required to effectively manage irrigation facilities. In South Korea, agricultural
    irrigation facilities, such as reservoirs and pumping and drainage stations, are
    managed by the Korea Rural Community Corporation using the Rural Infrastructure
    Management System (RIMS) (Nam et al., 2011). The RIMS agricultural irrigation
    facilities management system is defined with standard identification codes, such
    as ten-digit codes that include location codes, facilities codes, and serial numbers.
    However, irrigation facilities on plains, such as irrigation canals, bridges,
    and regulation gates, are difficult to manage because they are not encoded for
    integrated management. In this study, before codes are provided for irrigation
    canal facilities, a standard code must be developed to uniquely identify facilities.
    Integrated identification codes have been developed for irrigation facilities
    for WSN applications based on RFID and QR codes. The integrated identification
    codes of agricultural facilities management were designed as the combination of
    the existing standard code and extended codes to create a systematic management
    database that can be utilized in the search for the integration and utilization
    of existing systems. For this study, integrated identification codes for embedded
    RFID tags and QR codes were designed, an application of ICT technology was developed
    to enable the collection of field data. 3.2. Design of identification functions
    The identification process to identify objects can be automatically performed
    by electronic devices to facilitate identification. Fig. 2 depicts an overview
    of the proposed identification functions between the tags and readers. In this
    study, two types of devices are used to perform code identification: an RFID reader
    on a personal digital assistant (PDA) and a QR code reader on a mobile device.
    The identification methodologies are designed with three approaches to the detecting
    of irrigation facility information, such as RFID tags using RFID technology, image
    recognition using QR codes, and location coordinates using GPS. The first method,
    which uses widely available RFID technology, relies on automatic nonvisual reading
    that recognizes the facilities code. The second method, which uses the QR code
    based on the scanned image processing, reads the identification codes attached
    to facilities using the camera of the mobile device. The third method, which uses
    GPS for a location-based search, involves obtaining the position of the current
    location coordinates and then selecting an appropriate irrigation facility after
    searching for the surrounding facilities. Download : Download high-res image (281KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Functional overview of the mobile
    technology application process. The process of identification by mobile technology
    involves obtaining an identification code attached to objects using RFID tag and
    QR code decoding, or using location coordinates from GPS. The RFID tag provides
    a unique identification code. The QR code optically scanned an identification
    code. After the code is decoded or the GPS coordinates are received, the identification
    system verifies the existence of the scanned facility from the management server.
    If the identification code does not exist, for example, in the case of new facilities,
    a specific code is generated to access the management server to register the facility.
    After searching and selecting among nearby irrigation facilities, the information
    on the selected facilities is available on the mobile device and the current status
    can be checked. The information management technology is designed to enable a
    facilities search function; a display function to present information, such as
    the location, a photograph of it, the real-time/historical water level, and a
    recording function to perform a condition survey using mobile technologies, as
    shown in Fig. 3(a). The information search function obtains the basic information
    using identification functions, such as RFID, QR code, and GPS technology. The
    facility information stored in the management server can be displayed on mobile
    devices through map-type, photo-type, and graph-type information, such as the
    real-time water levels of irrigation canals, as shown in Fig. 3(b)–(d). Download

    Design of information system for irrigation facilities management In this study,
    the WSN system is intended to collect and communicate a variety of status and
    state information relevant to the management of plains irrigation facilities without
    the constraints of time and place using ICT technology to enable real-time data
    exchange. The wireless communication protocol was selected with consideration
    of distance, data rate, compatibility, and cost. Long-range communication with
    CDMA technology, medium-range communication with Zigbee technology used by adopting
    a water level monitoring network, and local wireless sensor networks used by combining
    RFID and QR codes were constructed to form an integrated management system, as
    shown in Fig. 4. The typical sensor network for automatic water gauging of irrigation
    canals and reservoirs consists of automatic sensors, a data logger, and a local
    server. Using CDMA and Zigbee technology, the data integration, collection, and
    management were performed, as shown in Fig. 4(a). For this study, a WSN based
    on RFID and QR codes was developed, as previously discussed. In addition, a database
    management system was developed for agricultural water management of operational
    conditions and maintenance requirements (Nam et al., 2011), as shown in Fig. 4(b).
    The sensor network was designed to wirelessly collect sensor data, and transfer
    it to the connected local server, and then to send requests generated by the decision
    support system. As shown in Fig. 4(c), the integrated management server is a configured
    database and management system; each database is used through the interconnection
    among devices from the local server. The management server must communicate with
    the sensor networks to update and collect data by obtaining the history information,
    facility real-time status, and operation information. Download : Download high-res

    site using ICTs and WSNs This research presents the design of an integrated WSN
    system for the real-time information management of irrigation facilities using
    ICT technology. The WSN system is comprised of RFID technology and QR codes and
    includes one CDMA module and three Zigbee modules. The system was installed in
    the I-dong irrigation districts in Gyeonggi, South Korea, for the purpose of implementing
    a decision support system for irrigation facilities management (Nam et al., 2011).
    Mobile technologies are used for irrigation facility identification and on-site
    verification for 32 major irrigation facilities. These technologies include the
    installation of RFID and QR codes at irrigation canals approximately 3.2 km from
    the start of the I-dong reservoir to the Won-am pumping station, as shown in Fig.
    5. The distance between each irrigation facility is approximately 50 m, and an
    integrated identification code was assigned to each irrigation facility. The CDMA
    module was installed in the reservoir to communicate with the management server,
    and the Zigbee modules were installed in the water gauge sensor to collect the
    real-time water level. Download : Download high-res image (544KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 5. Pilot site for wireless sensor network testing (map image
    from Google). The RFID and QR codes were installed in 21 facilities, for example,
    the water gauge, gauging staff, irrigation canals, regulation gate, closed conduit,
    and diversion structure to identify functions, as shown in Fig. 6 and Table 1.
    Plains irrigation facilities, such as irrigation canals, water gauges, and gauging
    staffs, are difficult to intuitively recognize on-site because of their relatively
    small size compared to facility structures, such as reservoirs and pumping stations.
    The installed types are either panel-attached or directly attached, depending
    on the type of irrigation facilities. The irrigation canal and regulating gate
    tags were installed as panel attachments to withstand any damage, as shown in
    Fig. 6(a) and (d); others, such as the water gauge and gauging staff, were installed
    as direct attachments, as shown in Fig. 6(b) and (c). The installed height and
    distance for recognizing the tags was approximately 0.2–2 m. The signs were placed
    to enable their observation by walking around the facility without disturbing
    it, and care was taken to avoid damaging the iron near the waterways. Download

    Measuring mobile technology operability requires processes and a performance measure
    for each method. The identification methods, which use RFID tags and QR code readers,
    are possible to implement by walking or driving, depending on the distance. Using
    the RFID identification method characterized by non-directional communication
    enables the facility manager to access the identification regardless of the direction
    of facilities. However, it is difficult to physically distinguish the given facility
    when a number of facilities are concentrated. While the QR code, which uses a
    camera to obtain the facilities identification codes, does not involve this redundancy
    selection, it is limited by the possibility of damage to the bar code and by the
    difficulty of night-time identification. The GPS module includes use of intuitive
    identification features because of its search for nearby facilities around the
    current location of the inspector; however, it identifies a large diversity of
    facilities depending on the wide range of relative errors. Finally, the identification
    method that uses a name search function can exactly identify the facility location
    if its name is known; however, it is not easy to input text in devices and remember
    many facilities names. The previously described methods require comparisons of
    their identification of recognized distance, inspection speed, and recognition
    rate. To this end, the facilities identification codes were used to build a database,
    and field tests were performed for evaluating the applicability and operability
    of each method. Table 2 summarizes the characteristics and the comparison results
    of each specific identification method. In the case of short-range wireless communication
    using RFID technology, the recognition distance of approximately 1.5 m was investigated
    to identify the facilities. The inspection speed of turning on the reader within
    approximately 1 s was recognized regardless of the facility installation height
    and directional detection. QR codes were verified by an installation of 10 × 10 cm,
    and the recognition distance was approximately 20 cm. The camera module-focused
    QR codes were recognized within less than 1 s of turning on the reader. QR codes
    have a rapid recognition speed; however, they have the disadvantage of using directional
    detection for recoding and a short inspection distance. The GPS location-based
    identification modules provided in mobile devices search around the facilities
    based on current location information from the modules. Based on the evaluation
    of a resulting verification error, the error for detecting facilities in a flat
    region occurred at 30 m, while an error appeared at approximately 100 m in mountainous
    areas. Although the GPS error occurred, the total count of detected facilities
    was 5.5 items per one trial, which seems more aligned with the degree of identification
    depending on the wide distribution of agricultural facilities. Searching the name
    of the facility through mobile devices is a function that searches facilities
    information regardless of the distance in the field. The process of entering the
    facilities name in mobile devices is time-intensive and an inconvenient method;
    moreover, it is not easy to distinguish the irrigation facility based on the name.
    This method does not have in-field limitations; therefore, it can be used when
    the other three types of identification methods cannot locate the facilities.

    technology The information system using ICTs for irrigation facilities management
    enables users to monitor current facilities information collected from the WSN
    sensors via mobile devices anywhere in real time. The motivation for inspection
    guidelines is to show the workflow for the development of a WSN and mobile technology
    built over this approach. In this exploration of this application of RFID and
    QR codes using ICTs, we consider the operation processes involved in the irrigation
    facilities management process. Fig. 7 depicts the communication protocol of the
    identification process using ICTs. The inspection guidelines are primarily comprised
    of tag, reader, middleware, and server. RFID is used with the concept of storing
    facilities identification information on chips, placing these chips on tags, and
    then placing these tags on objects to enable their unique identification. The
    RFID reader and mobile devices that use decoding or tag sensing processes detect
    or otherwise obtain the information of irrigation facilities from the tags, such
    as RFID tags and QR codes. In terms of the detailed operation process, the reader
    collects current situation information and sends the collecting data to the middleware;
    the middleware then analyzes the received collecting data to transfer in the server
    database. In addition, when a manager requests historical data, such as record
    or repair information, the middleware is used to support the query from the database
    using ICTs. After the association request is successfully performed, the manager
    can receive notifications of current and past facilities conditions in real time.
    The WSN technology for management of irrigation facilities enables access to a
    variety of accumulated information in the field by the middleware and server via
    the integrated identification code and mobile devices using ICTs. Moreover, the
    target of facilities management can be more quickly and accurately recognized
    in real-time and thereby decrease more errors than past handwritten management
    methods. Download : Download high-res image (158KB) Download : Download full-size

    paper, we described the installation, application, and evaluation of an information
    system of irrigation facilities management using WSN that utilizes RFID and QR
    code technology. The introduction of ICTs added a new dimension to the delivery
    of advanced information to the irrigation facilities manager. The operational
    results demonstrated the applicability of the ICTs for agricultural water management,
    good portability, proper recognition, and appropriate information gathering in
    the field. In conclusion, the enhancement of the platform with identification
    technologies for irrigation facilities management and access to information system
    using RFID and QR code provide extended capability for agricultural water management
    and effective decision-making. The various real-time information obtained from
    the RFID tags and QR codes deployed in the irrigation canals and facilities can
    be used by decision maker for irrigation policy. In addition, this system can
    be connected to online monitoring system that provides central information management;
    therefore, facilities managers can obtain/access real-time data in the field using
    ICTs and WSNs. Acknowledgments This research was supported by Korea Institute

  description: Field experiments were combined with a numerical model to optimize
    drip irrigation management based on soil matric potential (SMP) measurements.
    An experimental crop of eggplant was grown in Burkina Faso from December 2014
    to March 2015 and plant response to water stress was investigated by applying
    four different irrigation treatments. Treatments consisted in using two different
    irrigation depths (low or high), combined with a water provision of 150%, 100%
    or 66% (150/100/66) of the maximum crop evapotranspiration (T150low, T66low, T100high,
    T66high). Soil matric potential measurements at 5, 10 and 15 cm depth were taken
    using a wireless sensor network and were compared with measurements of plant and
    root biomass and crop yields. Field data were used to calibrate a numerical model
    to simulate triggered drip irrigation. Different simulations were built using
    the software HYDRUS 2D/3D to analyze the impact of the irrigation depth and frequency,
    the irrigation threshold and the soil texture on plant transpiration and water
    losses. Numerical results highlighted the great impact of the root distribution
    on the soil water dynamics and the importance of the sensor location to define
    thresholds. A fixed optimal sensor depth of 10 cm was found to manage irrigation
    from the vegetative state to the end of fruit development. Thresholds were defined
    to minimize water losses while allowing a sufficient soil water availability for
    optimal crop production. A threshold at 10 cm depth of −15 kPa is recommended
    for the early growth stage and −40 kPa during the fruit formation and maturation
    phase. Simulations showed that those thresholds resulted in optimal transpiration
    regardless of the soil texture so that this management system can constitute the
    basis of an irrigation schedule for eggplant crops and possibly other vegetable
    crops in semi-arid regions.

    • We run four water stress experiments on a drip irrigation system in Burkina
    Faso. • Eggplant water stress was related to soil matric potential (SMP), biomass
    and yields. • Numerical simulations unravel SMP thresholds dependence on root
    and sensor depth. • Optimality for water and yield is obtained with evolving thresholds
    during growth. • SMP sensor location at 10 cm depth reveals optimal independently
    of soil texture. Abstract Field experiments were combined with a numerical model
    to optimize drip irrigation management based on soil matric potential (SMP) measurements.

    managementSoil water modelingSemi-arid regions 1. Introduction Semi-arid regions
    in sub-Saharan Africa rely on irrigation for agricultural activities during the
    dry season, characterized by extreme temperature and dry wind conditions, and
    an almost total absence of precipitation. Agriculture traditionally takes place
    during the rainy season, but the impacts of climate change, the shift of rainfalls
    to the South, the great variability of interannual rainfall and the severity of
    drought pockets have made dry season agriculture crucial for food security (FAO,
    2014). Water is a scarce resource in semi-arid regions, and high yields are difficult
    to obtain. FAO (2014) estimates that, in 2014, 80% of the food was produced by
    family farmers in a sample of 30 countries and further states that they must innovate
    to tackle a triple challenge: yield growth to meet the world''s needs for food
    security and better nutrition; environmental sustainability to protect soil and
    water resources in relation to their own productive capacity; productivity growth
    and livelihood diversification to lift themselves out of poverty and hunger. While
    technologies such as drip irrigation kits reduce the time spent to irrigate the
    crop and improve water allocation by only irrigating near the root zone, estimating
    adequate water needs and timing to maximize yields remains a challenge. Irrigation
    is usually done on a visual assessment of the soil and plant state, and producers
    mostly rely on their own experience, often resulting in over-irrigation and water
    losses. In this context, the recent development of autonomous wireless sensor
    networks offers new perspectives for precise triggered irrigation (Barrenetxea
    et al., 2008, Ranquet Bouleau et al., 2015). An appropriate irrigation schedule
    aims at avoiding plant water stress by optimizing the soil water availability
    in the root zone. Water stress first modifies the plant''s turgor pressure and
    affects cell growth and wall synthesis (Laio et al., 2001) which is particularly
    problematic during the plant''s vegetative and development stages. During the
    plant''s mid-season and yield formation, water stress can be identified by stomatal
    closure leading to reduced transpiration followed by pollination failure (Steduto
    et al., 2012). In FAO''s models (Raes et al., 2012), a parameter p, which characterizes
    the fraction of soil water depletion in the whole root zone, is used to determine
    the degree of water stress and its impact on yield. This parameter is difficult
    to assess on-site, and other methods to manage irrigation have therefore been
    investigated. Other parameters to track water stress are based either on direct
    monitoring of the plant response (tissue water potential, Thompson et al., 2007,
    or sap flow, Patakas et al., 2005), on plant remote sensing (infrared thermometry,
    Taghvaeian et al., 2012) or indirectly by measuring the soil water availability
    (soil water content or soil matric potential). Managing irrigation using soil
    matric potential (SMP) thresholds has shown a promising potential for saving water
    and improving yields with the use of simple sensors. In contrast to soil water
    content monitoring, SMP thresholds are less dependent on the soil texture since
    the SMP is directly linked to the plant''s root ability to uptake water. An important
    challenge of SMP based irrigation is that measurements are done at specific locations
    which may not be representative of the SMP in the whole root zone, as root water
    uptake depends on root density. Table 1 lists selected recent scientific articles
    proposing thresholds to trigger irrigation given the crop type. It can be observed
    that no clear consensus seems to emerge from those studies as experiment-specific
    conditions lead to great differences in optimal thresholds, even with a relatively
    similar soil texture or crop type. Comparisons are especially difficult as the
    sensor is placed at different depths in a soil profile where water availability
    is not homogeneous. Most studies also propose thresholds only for the mid-season
    when transpiration is maximal, but do not consider previous growth stages where
    water losses due to evaporation are greater and important water savings may be
    achieved. Table 1. Literature review of proposed SMP irrigation thresholds for

    context, the research project Info4Dourou2.0 based at the Ecole Polytechnique
    Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) has developed an innovative autonomous wireless sensor
    network based on continuous SMP measurements that is adapted to extreme climates
    (Ranquet Bouleau et al., 2015). Relying on this wireless sensor network, the main
    objective of this study was to set the basis for an optimized irrigation management
    system using SMP measurements that can be more easily reproduced, compared and
    that can provide simple and practical recommendations for local producers or engineers.
    The system is primarily designed for family farmers in semi-arid regions, and
    the goal was to use a single SMP sensor at a certain depth to make it more affordable.
    We first focused on the plant response to water stress during the whole plant
    growth and the impact of the irrigation schedule on aerial biomass and root development.
    In a second phase, a numerical model was built using the software HYDRUS 2D/3D
    in order to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the spatial soil water
    distribution and to optimize the sensor placement and irrigation thresholds. Dabach
    et al. (2013) showed the potential of the software to simulate the evolution of
    the SMP and to optimize the irrigation threshold, but only tested high threshold
    values (−3 to −20 kPa). In this paper, simulations were created to assess the
    impact of different irrigation depths and frequencies and thresholds on the water
    fluxes (evaporation, transpiration, leakages). The final outcomes of the paper
    were: (i) to select an optimized sensor location; (ii) to define appropriate irrigation
    thresholds for each eggplant growth stages; (iii) to assess the influence of the
    soil texture on the proposed management system. 2. Materials and methods 2.1.
    Experimental site The experiments were conducted in a rural area 8 km away from
    Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso (12°20′24″ N, 1° 27′8″ O). The experiments took place
    from December 5, 2014 to March 25, 2015 on a drip irrigation system of 200 m2
    cultivated with eggplants. The species of eggplant selected was Kalenda. Before
    transplanting, the soil was ploughed manually to a depth of 10 cm. 1 kg/m2 of
    a NPK soil amendment and 0.25 kg/50 m2 of urea were also applied homogeneously
    over the crop before transplantation. The drip irrigation kits were provided by
    the non-profit social enterprise “International Development Enterprises” (iDE).
    The 200 m2 drip irrigation system consisted of 24 sublines, 8 m long, separated
    by 1 m between rows. Each subline was equipped with 15 drippers with a spacing
    of 0.5 m. Drippers consisted of small microtubes with a discharge rate of about
    2.5 l/h. The irrigation water was pumped from a dam 250 m away and stored in a
    1 m3 reservoir. One eggplant was transplanted at about 2 cm from each microtube.
    The soil texture corresponded to a compact sandy clay loam soil, with very poor
    organic matter. A hard layer of ferralitic rock, made of partially crumbly rock
    mixed with some sandy earth, was located at a depth of 25–30 cm. 2.2. Irrigation
    treatments The parcel was divided into four subplots consisting of 6 sublines
    each. 90 eggplants were planted on each subplot, they had a total canopy cover
    of 17.7 m2 at full growth. The irrigation depth was calculated by dividing the
    total water volume applied to the subplot in liters by the total wetted area of
    the drippers in square meters. The wetted radius of each dripper was estimated
    to 0.25 m which corresponded to the radius of the canopy at full growth. The four
    irrigation treatments were coded as T150low, T66low, T100high and T66high. The
    code number (150/100/66) corresponds to the percentage of water needs that were
    provided for each treatment. Water needs in mm/day were established based on standard
    crop evapotranspiration (ETc) given the crop growth stage. The code “low” or “high”,
    identifies the type of schedule. For “low” treatments, a fixed water amount of
    5.6 mm (l/m2) was applied to each irrigation event, and the irrigation frequency
    was defined to meet the corresponding percentage of ETc. 5.6 mm corresponded to
    the standard depth applied by the local producers and was considered low as it
    represented only 35% of the readily available water (RAW) (Allen et al., 1998).
    “High” treatments received a higher irrigation depth corresponding to 150% of
    the RAW, which was adapted for each growth stage because of root growth. This
    led to a lower irrigation frequency to meet the corresponding water needs. A fixed
    irrigation schedule was defined for each treatment and for each growth stage,
    summarized in Table 2. Table 2. Irrigation schedules used for the four treatments
    on the eggplant crop. The different growth stages used by the FAO (Allen et al.,
    1998) and their corresponding length defined as days after transplanting (DAT)
    are also shown. Growth stage DAT T150low T66low T100high T66high [–] [days] Frequency

    1/4 22.6 1/5 22.6 T150low is the control experiment and follows the practice of
    local producers. The “low” irrigation depth corresponded to 5.6 mm and irrigation
    was triggered twice a day as done by producers. This practice corresponded to
    providing 150% of the estimated ETc during the mid-season. For T66low, the same
    “low” irrigation amount was applied but only 66% of the ETc was restored by using
    a lower irrigation frequency than T150low, so that water stress was induced. T100high
    received a “high” irrigation depth and a lower irrigation frequency to meet 100%
    of ETc. Finally, T66high received the same “high” irrigation amount but only 66%
    of ETc was provided. The different treatments began 20 days after transplanting
    (DAT), when the plants were well established. Those four treatments allowed us
    to assess both the impact of the irrigation schedule (irrigation depth and frequency)
    and the effect of water stress (percentage of ETc provided). 2.3. Crop evapotranspiration
    and readily available water The reference evapotranspiration (ET0) was calculated
    according to the directive from the FAO, using the original Penman–Monteith equation
    (Allen et al., 1998). Air temperature, relative humidity and solar radiation were
    obtained using a Decagon VP-3 sensor for temperature and humidity and a Davis
    Solar Radiation sensor, which were connected to an automatic meteorological station
    located in the center of Ouagadougou, 8.4 km away from the experimental site.
    Wind measurements and precipitation amounts were taken on site for more precision
    with a Davis Anemometer and a Davis Rain Collector. The time resolution of the
    data was 1 min and data were accessible in real time on a web interface. ET0 calculations
    were validated by comparison with historical data from the FAO and the National
    Meteorological Institute of Burkina Faso. Crop maximal evaporation (ETe) and transpiration
    (ETcb) were distinguished from the crop evapotranspiration (ETc) by using the
    dual crop coefficients (ke and kcb) (Allen et al., 1998). The dual crop coefficients
    suggested by the FAO were used and were adapted to the wind speed and relative
    humidity as suggested in Allen et al. (1998). The readily available water (RAW)
    was calculated by estimating the soil moisture at field capacity (θfc) and permanent
    wilting point (θpwp), using the average fraction of total available soil water
    that can be depleted from the root zone (p) suggested by the FAO in Allen et al.
    (1998) and using direct measurements of the maximum rooting depth. Table 3 summarizes
    climatic and plant data for the different growth stages. Table 3. Estimated climatic
    parameters. Kc is the single crop coefficient; ET0 is the reference evapotranspiration;
    zr is the root depth; p is the total available soil water that can be depleted
    from the root zone and RAW is the readily available water. Based on Allen et al.

    2.4. Soil measurements The SMP was monitored every minute using Watermark sensors
    from Irrometer which were connected to an autonomous wireless sensor network and
    data were accessible in real-time on a web interface. For each treatment, the
    SMP was measured on 2 plants, at 5, 10 and 15 cm depth. In one case, the sensors
    were placed at a horizontal distance of 5 cm from the dripper, while on the second
    plant, the distance was 12 cm. Additionally, two soil moisture sensors, a 5TE
    and a 5TM from Decagon, were placed close to a Watermark sensor at 10 cm depth
    to compare both measurements and to draw the relationship between soil moisture
    and SMP. 2.5. Plant measurements Plant growth was monitored weekly during the
    whole growth, starting 20 days after transplanting. Measurements included (i)
    the diameter of the stem, 2 cm above ground; (ii) the mean diameter of the canopy
    cover of each eggplant; (iii) the plant height; (iv) the total number of leaves;
    (v) the number of flowers and (vi) the weight of harvested fruits. For each treatment,
    measurements were collected on a sample of 10 eggplants selected randomly among
    a total amount of 90. The root structure was analyzed by directly extracting the
    root system from the soil. The ground around the plant was excavated and a large
    volume of soil containing the majority of roots was extracted. The earth and rocks
    were then washed away. Samplings were done on two plants for each treatment at
    30, 55 and 75 days after transplanting. The one dimensional root distribution
    was assessed by image processing. A picture of the root distribution was taken,
    processed into a black and white image and the density with depth was measured
    by summing up the number of black pixels for each layer as also done by Pasquale
    et al. (2012). Statistical validation of root distribution differences between
    treatments was not possible as only one to two root extractions occurred for each
    treatment. 2.6. Numerical model HYDRUS 2D/3D (Šimůnek et al., 2012) is a dedicated
    software that simulates water, heat and solute movements in two dimensional unsaturated
    soils. It allows you to simulate soil evaporation, transpiration and root water
    uptake, as well as water stress. The 2.04 2D-lite version of the numerical model
    was used to test different irrigation schedules and irrigation thresholds, and
    to assess the degree of water stress and the irrigation amounts. The simulation
    domain consisted of a simple 2D vertical rectangular domain. The discretization
    of the domain had a grid spacing of 10 mm for the z-coordinate and 25 mm for the
    x-coordinate. The boundary conditions were “Atmospheric Boundary conditions” for
    the top soil evaporation rate, “Variable Flux 1” for the dripper fluxes and “Free
    Drainage” at the bottom. The parameters for the soil hydraulic properties were
    based on the van Genuchten–Mualem equations (Genuchten, 1980). A soil water retention
    curve (SWRC) was drawn with the field data which allowed the calibration of the
    unknown parameters by minimizing the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between the
    modeled and measured SWRC. The calibration matched the characteristics of a Sandy
    Clay Loam texture proposed in HYDRUS 2D/3D and a similar parameterization was
    done by Mermoud et al. (2005) in an experimental field 17 km away from our site.
    The parameters used for the model are summarized in Table 4. For calibration only,
    a reduced saturated hydraulic conductivity of 5 cm/day was used at a depth of
    300 mm to simulate the rocky soil layer. Table 4. Soil model parameters. θr is
    the residual water content; θpwp is the water content at permanent wilting point;

    0.102 0.1054 0.1858 0.315 0.0558 1.6328 15 The root water uptake stress function
    responsible for transpiration reduction was based on the model proposed by Genuchten
    (1987). The following values were calibrated with field measurements: h50 =−50
    kPa and p = 3 which allows an early decrease in transpiration (50% uptake reduction
    at −50 kPa (h50); 18% at −30 kPa; 6% at −20 kPa). The same calibration was also
    used by Dabach et al. (2015) for an eggplant crop. HYDRUS 2D/3D also implements
    a dimensionless water stress index ωc (Šimůnek and Hopmans, 2009), which allows
    you to compensate for the root water uptake reduction in a certain zone by increasing
    the water uptake in other parts of the root zone. Compensation therefore allows
    the sustainment of maximal transpiration even when a small part of the root zone
    is stressed. ωc has a value between 0 (full compensation) and 1 (no compensation).
    Deb et al. (2011) showed that compensation (ωc<0.5) significantly improves the
    simulation of the water uptake from deep layers and Yadav et al. (2009) confirmed
    that it plays an important role in maintaining the transpiration rate when water
    stress occurs in the top soil layers. After calibration, a ωc value of 0.7 was
    selected for our simulations. The spatial distribution of the root water uptake
    was defined in 2D, based on direct measurements of the extracted root systems.
    2.7. Triggered irrigation scenarios Scenarios were built to assess the effect
    of different irrigation depths and thresholds on water stress and water consumption.
    We used, for all scenarios, similar soil calibration, similar water stress function
    and the same simulation duration, as well as the same evaporation and transpiration
    rates. In HYDRUS 2D/3D, irrigation can be triggered by specifying an observation
    node which corresponds to the sensor location. When the SMP falls below a defined
    value at that node, an irrigation event is triggered with a specific irrigation
    time and rate. HYDRUS 2D/3D does not implement a time lapse between irrigation
    events that is different from the irrigation time. Consequently, if the wetted
    front of an irrigation event does not reach the desired sensor depth within the
    irrigation time, a second irrigation event is triggered, doubling the irrigation
    depth. This precluded modeling triggered irrigation at lower sensor depths than
    5 cm for scenarios with low irrigation depth up to 5.6 mm. Two different growth
    periods were analyzed. The first period corresponded to the initial growth stage,
    between days 10 and 30 after transplanting. The second period corresponded to
    the mid-season, during yield formation, between 80 and 100 days after transplanting.
    For the first period, the thresholds tested were: −5, −10, −15, −20, −25, −30,
    −35, −40, −50 and −100 kPa. These scenarios were also tested with different irrigation
    depths corresponding to 1.4 mm (38% RAW), 2.8 mm (75% RAW) and 5.6 mm (150% RAW).
    For the mid-season period, the thresholds were: −5, −10, −20, −30, −40, −50, −70,
    −100, −150 and −200 kPa. The different irrigation depths corresponded to 5.6 mm
    (38% RAW), 11.3 mm (75% RAW) and 22.6 mm (150% RAW). For scenarios with an irrigation
    lower than or equal to 5.6 mm, the threshold was located at a depth of 5 cm and
    5 cm away from the dripper horizontally. For higher irrigation depths, a threshold
    at 10 cm depth was also considered. 3. Results 3.1. Soil matric potential and
    plant growth Continuous measurements of the SMP and plant growth were collected
    from days 20–100 after transplanting for the sensors at 5 and 15 cm depth, 12
    cm away from the microtubes (Fig. 1). Download : Download high-res image (802KB)

    for T150low, T66low, T100high, T66high (top to bottom) for sensors at 5 and 15
    cm depth, 12 cm away from a microtube. In Fig. 1, due to the day-to-day variability
    of the weather conditions, water needs and the fixed irrigation schedule, the
    SMP does not show a completely cyclic behavior, so that irrigation does not occur
    for the same value of SMP. The sensors at two different depths illustrate that
    the SMP in the root zone is not constant with depth. Treatment T150low keeps SMP
    values close to 0 kPa because of the frequent irrigation events and the provision
    of 150% of the water needs. For treatment T66low, the sensor at 15 cm depth becomes
    disconnected from the wetted bulb due to the small irrigation amounts and its
    value drops rapidly below −200 kPa. T100high and T66high show lower SMP values
    due to the lower irrigation frequency, but the soil is recharged more in depth
    than T66low due to the higher irrigation depth. On 45 DAT, a very short rainy
    event (0.5 mm) occurred, leading to lower root water uptake and an increase in
    SMP during the next irrigation event. The evolution of plant growth is illustrated
    in Fig. 2. Only the total number of leaves is shown as an example, since there
    was a high correlation between the different measurements (r > 0.8) and statistical
    analyses were similar. Download : Download high-res image (182KB) Download : Download

    Lines show the mean values while ribbons represent 1 standard deviation. The Student''s
    t-test was used to determine if samples of plant growth for each treatment were
    significantly different in Fig. 2. The normality of the samples was confirmed
    using a ShapiroWilk test, and samples were considered different when the p-value
    of the t-test was lower than 0.05 (p < 0.05). The results indicate that plants
    from T100high and T66high became significantly different from T150low and T66low
    starting 52 days after transplanting (p-value between 0.003 and 0.037). T66high
    remains different until the end of the experiment, while T100high was no longer
    significantly different after 80 DAT. A “non-identified” vascular disease, which
    attacked the roots and led to ripening of the plant, infected the crop at the
    beginning of the flowering period, 60 DAT, and was particularly severe in T150low
    and T100high. The sensors were only placed on healthy plants, so that the disease
    did not affect the measurements of the SMP. At the end of the experiment the following
    percentages of plants were left: 18.6% for T150low, 84.9% for T66low, 41.8% for
    T100high and 83.7% for T66high. In order to analyze the effect of water stress
    on plant growth, only the area of healthy plants, which growth was mainly influenced
    by the SMP, was considered. This procedure was acceptable since it was observed
    that the disease was not directly linked to high soil moisture. Indeed, from Fig.
    1, the SMP of T100high reaches values below −50 kPa every 2–3 days, while T66low
    presented much higher SMP values at 5 cm but suffered from the least plant losses.
    From this observation and the spatial diffusion of the disease, it seems that
    the disease was randomly spread in all experiments at first. T150low and T100high
    favored the diffusion of the disease to neighboring plants, as those treatments
    allowed a wider soil moisture recharge between two plants after an irrigation
    event. As a result, the disease was instead linked to the spatial distance between
    plants and the connection of wetted bulbs. Table 5 shows the total harvest of
    each treatments. The relative yields were calculated by dividing the harvest weight
    by the crop area of healthy plants. The irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE)
    was calculated by dividing the relative yield by the total amount of irrigation
    water applied and multiplied by the total crop area. Reported mean yields for
    eggplants in Burkina Faso and Ivory Coast are around 20 T/ha (2 kg/m2) (Fondio
    et al., 2009, Anon, 2003). Table 5. Marketable harvests for the eggplant experiment.

    0.690 3.2. Root development Fig. 3 shows the root density measured both horizontally
    away from a dripper and vertically with depth, at 30 and 55 DAT. No significant
    root density changes occurred between 55 and 75 DAT. At each growth stage, the
    general pattern of root length density for all extractions was similar, regardless
    of treatment. Density increases sharply from the ground to a depth of between
    5 and 12.5 cm, with a mean at 7 cm depth and then decreases relatively linearly
    to the maximal root depth. For the horizontal distance, a relatively linear decrease
    in root water uptake until the maximal length was observed. Such a profile was
    similar to other studies Coelho and Or (1998) and well reflects the water availability
    in the field. Differences between treatments due to water stress are not clear
    as the analysis relied only on one sample. Maximal root depth was relatively similar
    for all treatments and the majority of the roots was systematically contained
    in the upper 15–20 cm (from 82.8 to 98.7% of the total root biomass given the
    treatment). In Fig. 3(b), T66low seems to induce a higher root concentration in
    the upper 10 cm (77.3% of root biomass contained in the 0–10 cm layer, 21.3% in
    the 10–20 cm layer), while T66high possesses a more constant root density until
    a depth of 20 cm (40.8% from 0 to 10 cm; 42.0% from 10 to 20 cm). This behavior
    suggests an adaptation of the root development to the irrigation schedule when
    the plant is subject to water stress. Root adaptation to the zone of high soil

    After calculation of the soil and meteorological parameters, calibration of the
    root water uptake reduction function was critical, as it directly influences water
    stress. Calibration of the parameters of that function (h50 and p) was done using
    the data from experiment T66high from 80 to 95 DAT. Using the same climatic input
    and field data and the root zone distribution measured in the field, different
    values were tested. The RMSE between observed and modeled SMP at 5, 10 and 15
    cm was then calculated over the whole simulation period and was compared with
    other statistical parameters such as the Coefficient of determination (R2), the
    slope from the linear model, the Modeling efficiency (EF) and the Coefficient
    of Residual Mass (CRM). The three best sets of parameters were h50 =−40 kPa, p
    = 3; h50 =−50 kPa, p = 3 and h50 =−50 kPa, p = 4. The second set of parameters
    was selected as it best simulated the decrease in SMP just before an irrigation
    event (Fig. 4), which was essential to correctly calibrate the root water uptake
    reduction function. The calibration with the selected parameters was then tested
    with different values of the water stress index ωc which is used for water uptake
    compensation. A value between 0.6 and 0.8 led to the lowest RMSE. A value of 0.7
    was selected for further simulations to allow an early transpiration reduction
    and a high sensitivity to water stress. Download : Download high-res image (330KB)

    SMP for T66low at 5, 10 and 15 cm depth from 80 to 94 DAT for the best set of
    parameters. Due to irregularities in the water distribution of the drip system
    and inhomogeneities in the soil texture, a perfect fit between the modeled and
    measured SMP was not possible. Moreover, the root distribution used in the model
    was time independent which does not allow any growth or modification during the
    simulation. The parameters of the selected root water uptake reduction function
    were validated by comparing simulated and observed SMP from the other experiments.
    In particular, it was verified that the minimum SMP values before the irrigation
    events were similar. For instance, for T100high, for the same simulation period,
    using the best set of parameters, the RMSE over time were 25.7 kPa and 23.4 kPa
    at 5 and 15 cm respectively and the RMSE before the irrigation events were 17.9
    kPa and 11.8 kPa at 5 and 15 cm respectively. Interestingly, for all treatments,
    it was found that the simulated water front after an irrigation event only reached
    a depth of 20–25 cm. This could also be observed from the SMP measurements, where
    the sensors at 15 cm depth partially reacted to the irrigation events (Fig. 1).
    From the root density analysis, the root structure did not seem to have been greatly
    affected by the rocky layer, as only few finer roots reached this depth and were
    not packed just above it. It seems that the roots developed primarily in the upper
    25 cm where water was most available. The depth of the root zone and wetted front
    was therefore mainly linked to the different irrigation schedules. For this reason,
    for the hypothetical scenarios, the maximal root depth and the maximal horizontal
    length of the roots were defined to match the dimension of the wetted bulb simulated
    by the model. Finally, the calculated ratio of actual over maximal transpiration
    (Ta/Tmax) for the four treatments from 80 to 95 DAT were the following: T150low:
    99.9%; T66low: 76.4%; T100high: 84.1% and T66high: 65.3%. These ratios seem to
    accurately reflect the magnitude of water stress when compared to the measured
    crop yield in Table 5. It was concluded that transpiration reduction from HYDRUS
    2D/3D can be used as a good indicator of water stress for further simulations.
    3.4. Impact of the irrigation threshold and irrigation depth Different simulations
    were built for the early growth stage and the mid-season stage by varying the
    irrigation thresholds and the irrigation depth. Fig. 5 shows the calculated ratio
    of transpiration reduction (Ta/Tmax) and the ratio of irrigation water applied
    to the crop (Irr) to the crop maximal evapotranspiration (ETcmax) for all scenarios.
    ETcmax was calculated based on Kcmax in the dual crop coefficient as described
    in Allen et al. (1998) and assumes maximal soil evaporation (Kr = 1). Colored
    ribbons were drawn to show the optimal threshold region given the irrigation depth.
    Two parameters were used: First, the higher value of the ribbon was selected to
    avoid unnecessary water losses from evaporation and leakages. It was located just
    after the sharp drop of the irrigation/ETc ratio and the start of a flatter zone
    in Fig. 5(b) and (d). Secondly, the lower ribbon value corresponded to the onset
    of transpiration reduction (lower than 99% of maximal transpiration) to avoid
    water stress in Fig. 5(a) and (c). Download : Download high-res image (572KB)

    depth (higher value avoids water losses, lower value limits transpiration reduction).
    (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader
    is referred to the web version of the article.) 3.4.1. Early growth stage Fig.
    5(a) and (b) shows the results for the early growth stage. The irrigation threshold
    decreases with increasing irrigation depths at 5 cm, due to a more complete recharge
    of the root zone soil moisture, and the optimal threshold values correspond to
    −15 kPa, −25 kPa and −35 kPa for an irrigation depth of 1.4, 2.8 and 5.6 mm respectively.
    The irrigation water needs corresponding to those thresholds are the same, around
    42% of ETcmax. With higher thresholds, too frequent irrigations lead to a higher
    soil evaporation, while beyond these thresholds, the irrigation amounts decrease
    more slowly, as most of the water losses are minimized, so that only transpiration
    reduction reduces the irrigation water needs. Due to the low irrigation depths,
    the threshold could only have been placed at 5 cm depth. Based on the simulations
    with a threshold at 5 cm depth, the corresponding minimum SMP value at other depths
    can be numerically monitored. Fig. 6 shows the evolution of the SMP for the three
    selected scenarios. With an irrigation depth of 1.4 and 2.8 mm, the corresponding
    SMP at 10 cm depth decreases up to −20 kPa. However, due to the low irrigation
    depth, the SMP is not always completely recharged and falls below −20 kPa. For
    the irrigation depth of 5.6 mm, the SMP at 10 cm decreases up to −15 kPa. Below
    10 cm depth, the SMP hardly fluctuates with time due to low root water uptake.

    Fig. 6. Evolution of the SMP at different sensor depths with time for the three
    optimal scenarios of the early growth stage with a threshold at 5 cm depth. For
    the early growth stage, a sensor depth of 5 cm is adequate but the optimal threshold
    depends on the irrigation depth. At 5 cm depth, a threshold of −15 to −20 kPa
    is recommended in order to avoid water stress even for low irrigation depths (Fig.
    5(a)), while keeping water losses relatively low even with higher irrigation depths
    (Fig. 5(b)). A maximal sensor depth of 10 cm can also be recommended since even
    low irrigation depths can be monitored, but not below. At 10 cm depth, the threshold
    has a smaller optimal range between −15 and −20 kPa to avoid water stress, though
    this could not be validated by direct simulations. 3.4.2. Mid-season stage Fig.
    5(c) and (d) shows the results for the mid-season. It appears that the beginning
    of transpiration reduction occurs at relatively similar thresholds, around −40
    kPa for 11.3 mm and −50 kPa for 22.6 mm. Additionally, it seems that a threshold
    of −30 kPa would be sufficient to avoid most water losses regardless of the irrigation
    depth. It is therefore recommended to use a threshold value between −30 and −40
    kPa to trigger irrigation at 10 cm depth, which avoids most water losses while
    maintaining maximal transpiration. 3.5. Impact of the soil texture For the mid-season
    stage, the influence of different soil textures on the optimality of the selected
    thresholds was also evaluated. Indeed, texture influences the SMP and root distribution,
    so that it may impact on the threshold, given the sensor depth. Similarly to Fig.
    5, scenarios were built by varying the irrigation threshold and testing different
    soil types with a single irrigation depth of 11.3 mm. Textures from coarse soils
    (sandy loam) to fine textures (silt, clay loam) were used based on the parametrization
    of Carsel and Parrish (1988). Fig. 7 shows the results. The threshold emerges
    clearly for all soils at −40 kPa, as there is hardly any transpiration reduction.
    Using a threshold at −30 kPa seems less adequate, since irrigation amounts are
    still relatively high for the finer soil textures. It appears that by placing
    the sensor near the depth where maximal root water uptake takes place, it is possible
    to define a stable threshold independently of the soil texture. Download : Download

    used in this study to acquire a complete understanding of the complex relationship
    between soil water dynamics and plant response. The numerical model enabled us
    to consider the SMP at multiple locations given the depth and the horizontal distance
    from the dripper, and not only at a single point measurement, as it is the case
    with a sensor. This allows a better analysis of the spatial evolution of the SMP
    and the corresponding root water uptake response. In parallel, the field measurements
    were used to calibrate and validate the model and the water stress function. 4.1.
    Crop response to water stress Field experiments show that T150low, the control
    treatment, led to optimal fruit yield and was the only experiment which did not
    suffer from water stress. The SMP was kept mostly between 0 and −15 kPa but the
    soil was not completely saturated so that no significant soil aeration problems
    seem to have occurred. The constantly wetter soil surface led however to higher
    water losses which led to a lower IWUE for T150low (Table 5). During the crop
    development stage (20-60 DAT), the high irrigation depth with a low frequency
    (every 2 days) applied for T100high led to water stress and suboptimal aerial
    biomass development. In contrast, restoring only 66% of ETc with a lower irrigation
    depth and a higher frequency did not influence the plant growth of T66low. Referring
    to the SMP evolution (Fig. 1), it seems preferable to irrigate regularly and to
    maintain the SMP above −50 kPa in the top 10 cm (T66low) rather than to apply
    a lower irrigation frequency, letting the SMP drop below −50 kPa at both 5 and
    15 cm depth (T100high). During the mid-season (60–100 DAT), when root depth becomes
    maximum, the high depth and low frequency of T100high was better tolerated as
    the plants’ biomass catches up with the level of T150low and T66low and the final
    yields of T66low and T100high were similar. It is likely that yield was limited
    mainly because of reduced biomass development for T100high during the development
    stage, while fruit development was limited during the mid-season for T66low due
    to the partial provision of the water needs. It therefore seems that a SMP threshold
    higher than −50 kPa at 5 cm depth only results in optimal yields when a higher
    irrigation depth recharges the soil at least in the top 15 cm. Below −100 kPa
    at both 5 and 15 cm depth, fruit development was considerably reduced (T66high).
    As a general conclusion, eggplants seem to tolerate a decrease in SMP of up to
    −50 kPa if the whole root zone is recharged by the irrigation events. 4.2. Threshold
    sensitivity The threshold selected from the different models is clearly dependent
    on the transpiration reduction function, and the water stress index (ωc) which
    allow water uptake compensation. In order to assess the sensitivity of the threshold,
    additional simulations were performed with a more sensitive transpiration reduction
    function with h50 =−30 kPa. Results show that transpiration reduction occurs earlier,
    with a decrease of 3.5% with a threshold of −30 kPa and of 8.8% with a threshold
    of −40 kPa. It appears therefore that, even with a very sensitive reduction function
    that is exaggerated for eggplants, transpiration is kept relatively high, so that
    the threshold of −40 kPa appears quite robust. The effect of the water stress
    index (ωc) on the transpiration reduction was also evaluated by running our best
    selected scenario (threshold of −40 kPa at 10 cm depth, with an irrigation depth
    of 11.3 mm) with different values of ωc. Table 6 shows the ratio of actual over
    potential transpiration given different values of ωc. Table 6. Ratio of actual
    over potential transpiration (Ta / Tp) given different values of ωc for a threshold
    of −40 kPa at 10 cm depth and an irrigation depth of 11.3 mm. ωc 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8
    0.9 1 Ta/Tp 1 0.998 0.991 0.973 0.921 0.906 Compensation clearly influences transpiration
    reduction. A value of ωc of 1 or even 0.9 however does not seem realistic with
    our model. Indeed, in the model, the root water uptake is directly linked to the
    spatial root distribution without compensation (Šimůnek and Hopmans, 2009), so
    that it cannot evolve spatially in time and does not adapt to the water availability
    in the soil. The compensation could therefore be seen as a dynamic adaptation
    of the root zone to the soil moisture. Such rapid root water uptake adaptation
    was discussed by Coelho and Or (1998) as resulting from rapid growth of fine roots
    or changes in root conductivity. A ωc value of 0.7 represents a low adaptivity
    of the root water uptake, and is likely underestimated. The threshold of −40 kPa
    is consequently sensitive to water stress. 4.3. SMP distribution and impact on
    the sensor location The numerical simulations showed that the root zone SMP cannot
    be considered to be homogeneous. Fig. 8 shows the SMP distribution with depth
    just before an irrigation event for an irrigation threshold of −40 kPa at 10 cm
    depth and different soil textures. It appears that the SMP distribution is dependent
    on the soil texture. Indeed, the coarser textures show greater SMP variations
    in depth than for finer soils (clay loam, silty loam, silt). Download : Download
    high-res image (222KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 8. SMP distribution
    with depth just before an irrigation event for a threshold of −40 kPa at 10 cm
    depth. For instance, if the sensor were placed at 20 cm depth, the threshold would
    be −35 kPa for a silty loam texture and only −25 kPa for a sandy soil. This is
    mainly due to the relationship between soil moisture and SMP. In the case of sandy
    loam, most of the soil moisture has been depleted below −20 kPa, so that further
    water uptake leads to a rapid decrease in SMP. Additionally, coarse soils have
    lower unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. For sandy loam, a SMP drop started occurring
    just a few hours before the irrigation event, where root density was maximal at
    a depth of 70 mm. This illustrates that water stress occurs differently given
    the soil texture. In coarse soils, stress occurs more rapidly and severely in
    a specific zone of the root system, while in finer soils, a milder but longer
    stress occurs in the whole root system. In coarse soils, the sensor location is
    therefore essential: it should be placed in the zone of maximal root density in
    order to monitor the onset of water stress. If the sensor is placed below this
    zone, the threshold must be set higher in order to avoid possible stress in the
    upper part of the root zone. In finer soil textures, the SMP appears more homogeneous
    so that the sensor location is less important in monitoring the onset of water
    stress. Placing the sensor near the zone of maximal water uptake is recommended
    in order to measure a representative value of water stress. 4.4. Recommended sensor
    position From the field experiments and numerical simulations, it is recommended
    to place the sensor at a depth of 10 cm and at a horizontal distance of 5 cm from
    the dripper. It is assumed here that the dripper is located near the plant stem.
    There are different reasons for this optimal location. From the results at the
    early growth stage, the best sensor depth is located between 5 and 10 cm depth.
    Below 10 cm depth, almost no variations in SMP occur so that a lower depth is
    inadequate to control irrigation (Fig. 6). This is validated by the field measurements,
    where each sensor at 15 cm depth hardly responded to the irrigation events at
    20 to 40 DAT (Fig. 1). During the mid-season, 10 cm depth appeared to be an adequate
    sensor depth as it matched the depth of maximal root density and water uptake.
    Using a shallow sensor depth such as 5 cm may however not be optimal. Indeed,
    if the irrigation depth is low, only the top soil will be wetted and water stress
    at lower root depth will not be monitored. This was observed from the field experiment
    T66low in Fig. 1 where the SMP remained mostly above −40 kPa at 5 cm depth while
    the SMP decreased below −200 kPa at 15 cm and led to limited crop yield. Based
    on the goal to manage irrigation during the whole crop growth with a single sensor
    at a fixed depth, we conclude that using a sensor depth of 10 cm will provide
    the most efficient irrigation system. Indeed, this depth seems to be the best
    trade-off between early and mid-season stages. During the very early stage, this
    recommendation should be used carefully, as 10 cm was not directly verified by
    numerical simulations and root length may depend on the seedling age. 10 cm depth
    is therefore recommended for plants with shallow root systems. Considering semi-arid
    regions, this placement is deemed adequate as most soils are compact and usually
    shallow (Dembele and Some, 1991). Regarding the horizontal placement of the sensor,
    a maximal distance of 5 cm away from the plant stem was adequate. At greater distance,
    little fluctuations in SMP were observed during the early growth stage. During
    the mid-season, this distance showed clear fluctuations in SMP and better response
    to the irrigation events so that it was considered adequate. Finally, Dabach et
    al. (2015) also showed that placing the sensor closer than 10 cm from the dripper
    leads to more stable measurements given variations in the spatial soil structure,
    and they recommend placing the sensor near the dripper. Finally, in this study,
    we only propose an optimal sensor location and threshold to optimize irrigation,
    but we do not consider variations in the soil structure over the crop or differences
    in root water uptake or transpiration rates between plants. The number of sensors
    needed to acquire a representative measurement of the whole crop state is not
    discussed and goes beyond the scope of this study. 4.5. Recommended thresholds
    Table 7 summarizes the recommended thresholds for the whole growing period at
    10 cm depth. The period of establishment between sowing and transplanting is not
    taken into account. Table 7. Summary of the procedure to determine the irrigation
    threshold given the plant growth stage. The different growth stages are based
    on the classification used by the FAO in Allen et al. (1998). Crop stage Threshold
    (10 cm depth) 10 DAT to end of the initial growth −15 kPa Crop development Linear
    decrease from −15 kPa to −40 kPa Mid-season −40 kPa The first ten days after transplantation
    are critical, since roots may still be shallow. It is recommended to irrigate
    every day during ten days and then to start using thresholds. At the early growth
    stage, results converged towards a threshold of −15 kPa at 10 cm depth, though
    5 cm sensor depth was also adequate. During the crop development stage, root development
    and deepening mainly increase the zone of root water uptake. Assuming the same
    sensitivity to water stress (same transpiration reduction function), we propose
    lowering the threshold from −15 kPa to −40 kPa linearly with time, reflecting
    the growth of the root system. Marouelli and Silva (2007) reported that the crop
    development period is less sensitive to water stress for tomatoes, which is in
    the same family as eggplants, so that even lower thresholds may be found adequate.
    In the mid-season, a threshold of −40 kPa at 10 cm depth allowed the most water
    savings while keeping maximal transpiration and was adequate for different soil
    textures. Thresholds were found adequate for a wide range of the irrigation depth
    at 10 cm. However, using a very low irrigation depth will result in a smaller
    wetted area and root zone, which may lead to a lower capacity to uptake essential
    nutrients. Nutrients uptake was not part of our simulations but should be considered
    in further studies. On the contrary, if more than 150% of the RAW is used, leakages
    will occur which will not be monitored by our single sensor system. A moderate
    irrigation depth of around 75% of the RAW can be recommended. Simulations showed
    that most water savings can be achieved at the early growth stage in comparison
    with the maximal crop evapotranspiration (ETcmax). This is due to the much higher
    soil evaporation rate during that stage. On the other hand, during the mid-season,
    the optimal irrigation needs are located at around 90% of ETcmax. This is in agreement
    with the FAO directives and the results of Lovelli et al. (2007) who showed that
    providing 100% of ETc for eggplant growth was indeed the most profitable irrigation
    schedule. The crop root distribution may also influence the adequacy of the threshold
    at 10 cm depth, since a different root density pattern will modify the soil water
    dynamics. However, literature has shown that most vegetable crops (tomato, cucumber,
    watermelon, squash, onion, etc.) have the majority of their roots in the upper
    30 cm (Weaver and Bruner, 1927, Zotarelli et al., 2009). Moreover, our experiments,
    as well as Coelho and Or (1998), showed that the root structure adapts its density
    to the location where water availability is optimized, which will be around the
    sensor depth in the case of drip irrigation. In the context of semi-arid regions,
    it seems that the recommended system may perform well in different semi-arid regions.
    Indeed, climatic conditions are characterized by a high evaporative rate and most
    soils are sandy and dense. Concerning different crops, field experiments should
    be run to assess their specific tolerance to water stress. However, it seems possible
    that the thresholds proposed in this study may be applied to other vegetable crops,
    as the selected transpiration reduction function was relatively sensitive to water
    stress, and as the root distribution of most vegetable crops is likely to be concentrated
    in the top 30 cm. 5. Conclusion The combination of field experiments and numerical
    models allowed for a better understanding of the complex interactions between
    water stress, root water uptake, soil water dynamics and thresholds definition.
    While the field experiments allowed us to assess biomass and yield production
    in comparison with some local SMP measurements, the model allowed a more generalized
    appreciation of the root zone soil water dynamics as a whole. Numerical simulations
    using HYDRUS 2D/3D appeared to be a powerful tool to generalize site-specific
    experiments. The study therefore emphasized the importance of taking into account
    the soil water dynamics when relating a single SMP measurement to water stress
    in order to propose reproducible irrigation thresholds. In particular, numerical
    results showed the great impact of the root distribution on the soil water dynamics
    and the importance of the sensor location to define thresholds. For a better understanding
    of the onset and the dynamics of water stress, more research is needed to link
    the spatial distribution of soil water availability with root architecture and
    to characterize the linked effects on root water uptake, compensation and reallocation.
    Results also emphasized the great potential of water savings before the mid-season,
    a period during which few thresholds have been recommended. Remarkably, it was
    shown that irrigating using a single SMP sensor at 10 cm depth with evolving thresholds
    during crop growth was appropriate to provide an eggplant, and possibly other
    vegetable plants, with an optimal input of water to optimize yields while limiting
    most water losses independently of the soil texture. In contrast to most site-specific
    researches, those reference thresholds were designed for practical use by local
    producers in semi-arid regions. Acknowledgments This study is part of the project

  description: Water is an essential resource for the development of agriculture.
    In several locations like the south-east of Spain water is scarce and its cost
    is high, so optimal management of this important resource is essential. Therefore,
    the application of irrigation strategies to improve the watering process, affects
    the profitability of crops quite significantly. It is necessary to carry out the
    instrumentation of the variables that affect the growing process of the crop (soil,
    water and plant) and use the techniques associated with this instrumentation to
    take actions to optimize the production. The system proposed in this paper uses
    information and communication technologies, allowing the user to consult and analyze
    the information obtained by different sensors from any device (computer, mobile
    phone or tablet) in an easy and comfortable way. The proposed architecture is
    based on different wireless nodes equipped with GPRS connectivity. Each wireless
    node is completely autonomous and makes use of solar energy, giving it virtually
    unlimited autonomy. Different commercial sensors for measuring the wide range
    of parameters of the soil, plant and atmosphere can be connected to the nodes.
    The data is sent and processed on a remote server, which stores the information

    optimizationIrrigation management 1. Introduction Irrigated agriculture is the
    biggest consumer of freshwater in arid and semi-arid zones, with a share of around
    70–80% of the total volume of used water. However, increased demand for water
    by other sectors and weather-associated limitations (increasing aridity as a result
    of climate change), suggests that the water resources available for agriculture
    in forthcoming decades will be lower in both quantity and quality. At the same
    time, new growers with lower production costs than the traditional ones in these
    areas are forcing them to reduce costs by lowering their main inputs. It is in
    this area of costs reduction where the efficient use of the water is becoming
    an increasingly important consideration, sometimes at the expense of crop quality.
    However such issues must be addressed if such crops are to remain competitive.
    It is a proven reality that in semiarid zones the limited availability of water
    has contributed to creating increasing interest in water conservation, particularly
    among practitioners of irrigated agriculture. For these and other reasons, the
    scientific- and technical-based irrigation scheduling of water to maintain and
    even improve yield and quality has been and will remain a major challenge for
    irrigated agriculture (Puerto et al., 2013). In recent years, the incorporation
    of sensors in the context of agricultural production for water management and
    conservation has received an increasing interest for establishing irrigation management
    strategies, such as regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) or partial root drying
    (PRD). Both strategies allow very significant increases in irrigation water productivity
    (yield produced per unit of irrigation water applied), especially in woody crops
    (Egea et al., 2009, Jones, 2004, Puerto et al., 2013). However, these strategies
    need several sensors to estimate the plat water status. Most common sensors to
    estimate plant water status are soil sensors, since they provide important information
    that is familiar to the user. These sensors provide data of the matric potential
    (Ψm, soil water status) or volumetric soil water content (θv, soil moisture).
    Over the years, these sensors have evolved significantly since the first manual
    gauges that measured the pressure of the soil water to become ever more effective
    and precise in measuring the soil''s water status and moisture content, integrating
    communication with dataloggers (Fereres and Goldhamer, 1990, Hanson and Edwards,
    2000). In addition to these sensors, measures to control the volume or concentration
    of soluble salts in the irrigation water have often been used in irrigated agriculture,
    especially in arid and semi-arid areas. Water electrical conductivity (EC) is
    important, and irrigation water can be classified as running from excellent (EC
    ≤250 μS cm−1) to unsuitable (EC ≥ 3000 μS cm−1) (James et al., 1982). Moreover,
    it has been demonstrated that the crop production decreases as the EC of the irrigation
    water increases (Maas and Hoffman, 1977). The overall EC (or quality) of the used
    water can be adjusted by using water from different sources, which explains the
    use of sensors that provide measurements of the volume and quality of water held
    in reservoirs. This type of sensor provides useful data for regulating the conditions
    required by each of these irrigation strategies. These sensors have been used
    in conjunction with instrumentation systems to control the irrigation process,
    traditionally with wired dataloggers. In recent years, the quick development of
    wireless sensor networks (WSNs) has led to the use of sensor equipment with very
    little wiring, and great improvements in their installation and maintenance (Hussain,
    2012, Khan et al., 2014, Nolz et al., 2013, Ruiz-Garcia et al., 2009, Yu et al.,
    2013). Wireless sensor networks are composed of different measuring points, called
    nodes, able to communicate wirelessly. The data obtained from each one of them,
    is stored in a sink node and processed for managing irrigation. The ultimate aim
    is to use the data from field sensors towards a fully automatic irrigation system.
    Although a fully automatic system has not yet been achieved, remote irrigation
    management is possible by means of routers and Internet connections that access
    the data collected by dataloggers (wired) or by the sink nodes (WSNs) (Puerto
    et al., 2013). The common point of these systems is that they have a centralized
    communication structure, that is, they depend on a device (gateway) to communicate
    with the user, which can lead to connection problems for the whole system if such
    a device has limited connectivity. Advances in mobile networks and cheaper Internet
    communications (GSM/GPRS, 3G) has led in recent years to the incorporation of
    modules that provide WSNs with access to mobile networks by using machine-to-machine
    (M2M) modules. This feature provides more flexibility in the installation, as
    it is not limited by the connectivity of the sink node or datalogger. Each node
    contains a mobile communication module (GSM/GPRS, 3G) changing the topology of
    the network from centralized to distributed. One of the important advantage of
    this approach is that a connection failure at a node does not affect the normal
    operation of the network. However, the higher energy requirements of the mobile
    communications network represent a complex challenge for the design and dimensioning
    of the instrumentation of the nodes (Sinduja and Sowmya, 2013). This article describes
    the design and dimensioning of a wireless node to fulfill the specified requirements
    of autonomy and reliability, allowing an easy installation and the ability to
    use the wide range of electrical interfaces in agronomic sensors. The results
    obtained in different agricultural scenarios are then used to verify the operation
    of the equipment and the goodness of the agronomic data. 2. Materials and methods
    2.1. Hardware description One of the most important aspects to consider when designing
    a device for monitoring any kind of variable is the ability to cover a wide range
    of significant parameters for the monitored activity that will provide the device
    with the versatility necessary for use in a broad variety of real situations.
    Such measurements are provided by specific sensors that are connected to the device
    by means of a wide range of possible connection interfaces. In the present article,
    a completely autonomous device for estimating the plant water status in several
    scenarios is presented. The device, which must be compatible with a wide variety
    of sensors that provide plant-related data, is based on a modular structure that
    consists of several electronic interconnected boards: 1. An electronic board,
    the Main-Board, which has already been used in other applications, including oceanographic
    monitoring by means of a ZigBee network (Albaladejo et al., 2012). This board
    is responsible for sensors’ data. It is also in charge of communication with the
    rest of the boards and ensures that the whole system is working properly. 2. The
    Sensor-Board provides the interface with the connected sensors. The design of
    the board is optimized for agricultural monitoring, allowing the simultaneous
    connection of a common precision agriculture sensors. 3. The GPRS-Board is in
    charge of establishing the communication with the mobile network by means of a
    GSM/GPRS protocol, sending the data to the remote storage server for further consultation.
    2.2. Control, management and data collection subsystem Fig. 1 shows the flow diagram
    of the Main-board. When it is powered up, the microcontroller obtains the configuration
    information from the SD-Card. This card contains information about the sensors
    connected to the Sensor-Board, the sample period and transmission rate, the GPRS
    and remote server configurations, etc. By simply modifying a few files, the user
    is able to completely change the behaviour of the system, providing great flexibility.
    As soon as the configuration is initialized, the system enters in a sleep mode
    in which the power consumption kept below 600 μA. When the sample rate time has
    expired, the microcontroller is “woken up” by an interrupt signal and the process
    of retrieving the information from the sensors starts. This process is carried
    out by the interface board. Then, the microcontroller obtains the time from the
    RTC and stores all the information in the SD-Card. Next, the system enters the
    sleep mode again and waits for another interrupt. When the sending rate time has
    expired, the Main-Board establishes communication with the GPRS-Board to send
    the information obtained from the sensors to the remote server. This board also
    performs a charging algorithm to optimize battery life, activating and deactivating
    a circuit in the Sensor-Board with the purpose of connecting the solar panel only
    when the battery is outside a specified voltage range. Download : Download full-size

    The Sensor-Board is one of the most important parts of the whole system since
    it provides the interfaces that will determine compatibility with external sensors.
    Given that the SDI-12 interface is one of the most important and standardized
    interfaces in the field of precision agriculture (López et al., 2009), it provides
    great flexibility because a wide range of commercial sensors used in agriculture
    are compatible with it. According to the technical characteristics of the SDI-12
    protocol (SDI-12, 2005). The sensors that use SDI-12 are powered at 12 V. As the
    battery operates in the range of 3.7–4.2 V, a 12 V DC/DC converter was included
    to power every sensor connected to the Sensor-Board, while a 5 V DC/DC was used
    to power the tri-state buffer needed for the SDI-12 interface. This power source
    could also be used to power up sensors. The rest of the sensor interfaces included
    in this board were: • One 4–20 mA interface. • Three voltage interface. • One
    digital pulse interface. Fig. 2 presents the flow diagram of the Sensor-Board.
    In the initial state, the power supplies of the sensors are inactive. As soon
    as the Main-Board enters the reading state, the Sensor-Board warms the sensors
    for 2 s, then starts reading all the SDI-12 sensors, after which it begins reading
    the analogue sensors. Finally the Main-Board stores the data in the SD-Card and
    the Sensor-Board enters the Initial State again. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Flow diagram of the Sensor-Board. 2.4. Communication subsystem The
    communication module is based on the SIM900 GSM/GPRS chip from Simcom Ltd. The
    SIM900 module communicates with the Main-Board by mean of AT-Commands through
    a serial interface. The decision to use GSM/GPRS technology rather than the more
    modern 3G or even 4G is based on two important points: 1. GSM/GPRS is more established
    than any other mobile technology, so its coverage is greater than that of its
    counterparts. Also, the vast majority of the areas that need to be monitored for
    precision agriculture will be located in the countryside, where 3G/4G is not always
    available. 2. Although GPRS/GSM technology is much slower than 3G/4G, the amount
    of data collected at each sampling is so small that speed is not an issue. Moreover
    the power consumption of devices compatible with 3G/4G is much greater than in
    the case of GPRS/GSM – an aspect that is much more important than speed in scenarios
    where the autonomy of the device is of key importance. This module is one of the
    most important parts of the device and allows a change in the topology commonly
    used in WSN, from centralized to distributed. A sink or a gateway node is not
    needed as every device in the network has its own capacity to transmit data by
    Internet. Fig. 3 shows the flow diagram of the communication subsystem. As the
    Main-Board enters the Sending state, the GPRS module is powered up and tries to
    establish connection with the remote server through the mobile network. If the
    communication with the remote server is established successfully, the GPRS-Board
    enters the Sending state, in which the data is processed and sent to the server
    separately in bursts of 1 kB. If any problem occurs during this process, the GPRS
    will enter the inactive mode to save the battery. In this case, the GPRS-Board
    will try to transmit all the data at the next sending time. Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 3. Flow diagram of the communication subsystem. Fig. 4a shows
    the completely assembled device. In order to guarantee the stability of the network,
    an installation protocol must be followed. Firstly, an analysis of the signal
    power at the point of installation is performed for each mobile operator by means
    of an Anritsu MS2713E spectrum analyzer. The operator with the strongest signal
    will be the most suitable. Using the most suitable GPRS antenna is very important,
    since the sensitivity of the Sim900 module is around −109 dBm (SIM 900 Hardware
    Design Guide, 2010). If the threshold cannot be reached with an internal antenna
    of 2 dB, a 5 dB external antenna should be used instead. This protocol ensures
    high quality GSM/GPRS communications under normal working conditions. Download

    The electronics are located inside an IP-67, a box of reduced dimensions (120
    mm × 122 mm × 75 mm), whose cover is transparent so that the solar panel inside
    is protected from exposure to the weather (Fig. 4b). 2.5. Experimental sites Four
    experimental tests were carried out to analyze the behaviour of the device in
    real scenarios. The data was collected from January 2014 onwards in four commercial
    plantations located in the south-east of Spain. In order to manage the irrigation,
    soil moisture sensors rather than plant based sensors were used because soil moisture
    information is generally more familiar to the farmers. The control variables were
    matric potential (Ψm) and volumetric soil water content (θv) which are common
    in the irrigation management. The criteria for scheduling irrigation used in the
    scenarios 1, 2 and 3 (see below) were decided by the farmer. In scenarios 1 and
    2 the aim was maintain soil moisture conditions equivalent or close to field capacity
    to satisfy the maximum crop water requirements. In the third scenario soil moisture
    conditions depended on the crop phenological stage. In general, Ψm was used to
    decide the irrigation frequency and θv to adjust the gross irrigation doses. In
    scenario 3 it was decided to use a GS3 sensor instead of the 10HS because of its
    robustness, accuracy and easier installation for it to be in close contact with
    the substrate. Table 1 summarizes the main characteristics of the sensors used.
    The different scenarios are described below. Table 1. Summary of the sensors used

    Scenario 1 (woody crop). Fino lemon trees (Citrus limon L. Burm. fil cv. 49.)
    on C. macrophylla Wester, growing in a soil with a low water retention capacity,
    were irrigated in order to optimize the use of the irrigation water based on the
    information provided by the sensors. The soil had a sandy clay loam texture and
    the irrigation water had an electrical conductivity (EC) of 2200 μS cm−1. The
    orchard consisted of 10 year old lemon trees. Tree spacing was 7.0 m × 5.5 m,
    with an average ground coverage of about 47%. Two drip irrigation lines (0.8 m
    apart) were used for each tree row. There were 4 emitters (4 L h−1) on both sides
    of each tree. Two sensor nodes were installed in the 5.5 ha orchard, each one
    with a soil matric potential sensor (MPS-2, Decagon devices, Inc., Pullman, WA
    99163, USA) at a depth of 30 cm and three soil moisture sensors at a depth of
    20, 40 and 80 cm (10-HS, Decagon devices, Inc., Pullman, WA 99163, USA) located
    25 cm from a representative dripper and 2.25 m from the trunk. The device automatically
    took readings of the soil matric potential and volumetric water content every
    15 min. Scenario 2 (vegetable crop). Endive plants were planted in beds with 1.0
    m centres. There were two rows per bed, and plants were spaced 35 cm apart within
    the row (triangular planting). A single lateral tube with 0.2 m between emitters
    and a discharge rate of 5 L h−1 was used to meet their water requirements. The
    irrigation water had an electrical conductivity (EC) of 800 μS cm−1. One sensor
    node was installed in the 2.5 ha plot with two soil matric potential sensors (MPS-2,
    Decagon devices, Inc., Pullman, WA 99163, USA) at depths of 17 and 35 cm, and
    one FDR sensor at a depth of 20 cm (Hydra Probe II, Stevens Water Monitoring Systems,
    Inc., Portland, OR, USA) located 20 cm from a representative dripper and 20 cm
    from the plant. Scenario 3 (greenhouse soilless culture). The test was carried
    out in a plastic greenhouse (800 gauge) using hydrangeas growing in 12 L plastic
    pots containing a substrate mixture (2 parts peat, 1 part coconut fibre and 1
    part perlite by volume). The pots were spaced 50 cm apart within the row and with
    60 cm between two contiguous rows. The irrigation was supplied using a single
    lateral line that had two compensating drippers (2 L h−1) per pot. The irrigation
    water had an EC of 800 μS cm−1. One sensor node with three GS3 sensors (Decagon
    devices, Inc., Pullman, WA 99163, USA) was installed in the greenhouse with one
    GS3 sensor located mid-height in each pot. Scenario 4 (water reservoir). The water
    reservoir monitored, with a 500 m perimeter and a total capacity of 52,000 m3,
    is used to irrigate different fields located nearby. The reservoir receives water
    from a desalination plant and several wells. To keep track of the water level
    and conductivity, a pressure sensor (LMK 807, Sensotec Incorporated, Columbus,
    OH) and a conductivity sensor (ES-2, Decagon devices, Inc., Pullman, WA 99163,
    USA) were used. The pressure sensor was located at the bottom of the reservoir
    and the conductivity sensor 1 m below the water surface. Table 2 summarizes the
    number and type of sensors connected to each node. Table 2. Summary of the sensors
    used on each node. Node type Sensors Empty Cell 10HS HP-2 MPS-2 GS3 LMK807 ES-2

    The information from the sensors connected to the device is periodically sent
    to a data server, where it is processed and stored in a relational database. The
    software architecture of the data server is based around three main components:
    (1) an application developed in Java, which is in charge of communication with
    the nodes, (2) a relational database that stores the data, and (3) a Web application
    to check the information of the sensors. Fig. 5 shows the architecture of the
    system from a functional point of view. The node, after sampling the connected
    sensors, establishes a TCP communication through the GSM/GPRS module with the
    Java application that is being executed in the server. Once the socket of the
    communication is established, the node sends the data in a specific format. The
    Java application manages each connection and even in cases of simultaneity, it
    receives and sends the information of each sensor to a MySQL database. The Web
    application is used to query the database to show selected data to the user. Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Architecture of the system. The flow of the
    Java application is as follows: first, the header of the message, which contains
    information about the identification of the node, its sample rate, the location,
    the sensors connected, etc., is analyzed. Then, the sensor data is checked and
    processed and, if the information is below or above the threshold established
    by the user, an email is sent to warn of a possible incident. The data and the
    exact timestamp sent by the node are stored in the database, while the information
    gathered by the sensors is made available on the Internet through a website. This
    Web application is developed in HTML5, Javascript and PHP, as shown in Fig. 6.
    The top of the figure shows the geographic location of the devices and the connected
    sensors. The bottom of the figure shows, in graphic form, the information obtained
    from the sensors connected to the device. This allows the desired data to be visualized

    3. Results and discussion 3.1. Agronomic results Fig. 7a–c presents the data concerning
    the soil water content and water status of the crops recorded in the three commercial
    plantations and a water reservoir respectively. The first three figures clearly
    represent the evolution of θv and Ψm, while Fig. 7d plots the evolution of the
    water conductivity and volume of the irrigation reservoir. Download : Download

    and electrical conductivity of irrigation water during the indicated period (76–102
    DOY). Scenery (c) water reservoir. Fig. 7a shows how, as the season progresses,
    the moisture in the root zone of the lemon tree (top 50 cm) increases, while at
    80 cm it decreases slightly. The moisture content from 20 to 40 cm depth reflects
    the high availability of water for the crops, based on Ψm values at 30 cm (Domingo
    et al., 1996). The irrigation strategy is based on maintaining a high level of
    available water in the zone of highest root activity during the critical periods
    of flowering and fruit-setting, while optimizing the use of the irrigation water
    by minimizing deep percolation losses. The high frequency of strong winds (>5
    m s−1) in the area were taken into consideration during the flowering periods.
    To ensure the availability of water in the top 50 cm of soil, two daily irrigations
    (instead of one) were applied after day 95 (Fig. 7a). The total amount of water
    applied in a growing season was 5775 m3 ha−1 in contrast to the 6000 m3 ha−1 applied
    by Domingo et al. (1996). These authors managed the irrigation according to the
    FAO methodology using a Class A evaporation pan. The climatic conditions, irrigation
    system and total yields were similar (≈50 t ha−1). The difference represents a
    water saving of 225 m3 ha−1 with the irrigation controlled by sensors. However,
    the irrigation water quality and annual rainfall presented in the scenario 1 were
    lower than the ones presented by the previous authors (2200 μS cm−1 vs 1250 μS
    cm−1 and 100 mm vs 315 mm for the EC and rainfall, respectively). Considering
    that citrus fruits are salt sensitive (Storey and Walker, 1998) and bearing in
    mind the contribution from rain water, the savings could have been higher. Nevertheless,
    in order to choose one irrigation methods or the other, it would be necessary
    to keep registering the information during at least two more seasons. Endive plant
    requires consistent levels of water (near reference demand levels) throughout
    its rapid growth and final development periods. Reductions in the available water
    during these growth periods can result in reduced leaf development (Maynard et
    al., 1999), so that it is important to maintain the moisture content of the soil
    near field capacity at depths where the root system is located practically throughout
    the growth cycle. Fig. 7b plots the last days of the crop cycle (DOY 76–103),
    illustrating the high Ψm values and the evolution dynamics of the θv. Soil moisture
    (Hydra Probe II) and soil matric potential sensors (MPS-2) show the high irrigation
    frequency and the little variation in the minimum humidity values reached, with
    a slight increasing trend close to harvesting. The information provided by these
    sensors was of great help for maintaining the moisture content of the soil at
    field capacity values at the depths explored by the root system of the crops.
    Fig. 7c shows the evolution of the volumetric water content of the substrate measured
    in three different pots using a GS3 sensor inserted at mid-depth. As can be seen,
    there is no clearly defined pattern as the water content changes constantly. In
    the period 76–103 DOY, θv gradually fell over 8 consecutive days before sharply
    increasing. This was followed by another reduction and then a permanent recovery.
    Regardless of the grower''s irrigation procedure, Fig. 7c shows: (i) similar patterns
    in the water content evolution in the three pots located in different rows, (ii)
    rapid drainage during the final period and (iii) noise-free representation in
    a substrate where others sensors might have contact problems. It must be taken
    into account that good soil drainage in this kind of cultivation practice is essential
    to avoid root rotting. Fig. 7d plots the water conductivity and volume of the
    irrigation reservoir used to irrigate several nearby fields. The ES-2 sensor used
    to measure the conductivity of the water is of key importance to maintain the
    water quality in the desired range. As shown in Fig. 7d, the value of the conductivity
    during the measurement period was below 2200 μS cm−1. The LMK 807 measured the
    volume during the same period. The variation in the EC was evident when taking
    water for irrigation or adding water from the wells and the desalination plant.
    The information shown in Fig. 7d is of great help for mixing the water from the
    different sources to attain the conductivity required levels. 3.2. Power and energy
    consumption results In order to analyze the power consumption of the device, an
    exhaustive energetic analysis of each scenario was carried out to determine the
    most suitable battery and solar panel needed to make the device energetically
    autonomous. A detailed explanation about the power consumption of the woody crop
    node in the worst-case scenario, that is, a sample rate of 10 min and a sending
    rate of 1 h, is given below. The node has eight functional states, numbered as
    follows: (1) initialization and configuration, (2) standby, (3) interface warm-up,
    (4) digital sensor data acquisition, (5) analogue sensor data acquisition, (6)
    SD-Card data storage, (7) GPRS standby and (8) GPRS module transmission. The measurements
    of the current reported in this paper were taken with a YOKOGAWA WT210 digital
    wattmeter and WTVIEWER software. Fig. 8 shows an example sequence of the power
    consumption of the node when the system is functioning. After initialization and
    configuration, the data are collected from the sensors, first from the digital
    sensors and finally from the analogue sensors. After that, the data is stored
    in the SD-Card. The sequence of states (3), (4), (5) and (6), is repeated every
    10 min (sample rate). After 1 h (sending rate), all the sensor data collected
    before and available in the card are sent to the server. After that, the system
    returns to standby mode, until the next scheduled reading process. Download :
    Download full-size image Fig. 8. Woody crop node power consumption. The ultimate
    aim of this study was to determine how much current the device consumes on average,
    so as to relate the resulting figure directly with the capacity of the batteries
    and hence determine the device''s autonomy. The average current consumption of
    the GPRS node may be determined thus: (1) Each of the current components is explained
    in Table 3. To calculate the autonomy of the node, worst-case scenarios were assumed
    for each measurement. Thus, expression (2) shows sensor system consumption in
    standby mode. Eq. (3) expresses the estimated average current consumed by the
    device in the process of initialization. Expressions (4), (5), (6), (7) are calculated
    in the same way. The interval between samplings considered in this study was 10
    min, which is the worst-case scenario regarding energy consumption, although the
    average sampling period in real deployments is 15 min. Expressions (8), (9) are
    calculated in the same way. Table 3. Current components and their description.
    Type of current Description Current consumed in standby mode Current consumed
    in the process of initialization the GPRS node Current consumed with the current
    converters in active mode Current consumed by digital sensors. One MSP-2 for woody
    crop Current consumed by analogue sensors. Three HS10 for woody crop Current consumed
    in the process of storing data in the flash memory Current consumed in the process
    of establishing the connection with the phone cell Current consumed in sending
    of data to the server Considering an average current consumption of 5.93 mA (1),
    the next step is to choose a battery and a solar panel that enables the node to
    be completely autonomous. In order to achieve this, several tests were carried
    out with a wide spectrum of commercial batteries before the decision was made
    to use a LI103450A battery, a 1900 mAh Li-ion rechargeable battery with a nominal
    voltage of 3.7 V, equipped with a protection circuit that prevents overcharging
    as well as deep discharging. With this battery and considering the scenario presented,
    expression (10) estimates autonomy of the woody crop node without solar panels,
    which is around 13.35 days. The Sensor-Board has a circuit that manages the load
    based on the switching of an external solar panel. Using this battery in conjunction
    with a solar panel of 0.8 W (with a rated voltage of 5 V and a rated current of
    160 mA) will allow the node to be completely autonomous even under prolonged poor
    light condition. (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) To test the selected battery
    and solar panel, a validation test was conducted over a period of four months
    (from January to April 2014). A woody crop node was set up in Miranda (Cartagena)
    in a 4 ha mandarin orchard. Fig. 9 shows in detail the voltage recorded over a
    period of 28 days in which the battery voltage was kept between the desired values
    thanks to the solar panel and the charging algorithm. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 9. Woody crop node battery voltage. The consumption of all the nodes
    was also analyzed in Table 4. This Table 4 shows the mean power consumption of
    the device for the different scenarios, considering sampling rate values of between
    10 and 60 min and sending rates from 1 to 12 h. Logically, the higher the sampling
    rate, the more power the device needs to operate and so the power consumption
    is increased. Increasing the sample rate provides more information in less time.
    If the sending rate is reduced, the information will be available sooner but the
    device will be less efficient energetically as very few samples will be sent during
    each GSM/GPRS connection. After analyzing the table, it was concluded that the
    sending rate has a greater effect in scenarios where the power consumption of
    the sensors is low (Irrigation reservoir node, vegetable node); however, in scenarios
    where the sensors have a higher power consumption (woody crop node), the sending
    rate is of little importance for the overall power consumption of the device.

    4, the device sent multiple samples during each connection in order to optimize
    the battery in scenarios where real time is not necessary. Fig. 10 shows the current
    consumption of all the nodes for a sampling rate of 15 min and above, and in case
    that real time information is needed; that is, as soon as the sensor information
    is read, the data is sent to the server, so the information for the user is available
    in real time. In these scenarios, the power consumption increased in every case

    paper describes the design, optimization and development of a practical application
    to optimize water resources in irrigated agriculture by monitoring soil water
    status and the irrigation water. The article shows the technical challenges addressed
    in terms of WSNs and GSM/GPRS network communications, the sensors used and their
    configuration and energy optimization in a system based on a distributed architecture.
    To highlight the effectiveness and accuracy of the developed system, several case
    studies have been presented with the aim of analyzing the behaviour of the device
    in real scenarios. It is concluded that the sensor nodes are of great help to
    reach the desired moisture conditions at the different depths and to maintain
    water electrical conductivity level of the irrigation reservoir at the desired
    value, thus contributing to the ability to adapt the irrigation strategy according
    to each situation. The development of a small, compact and autonomous unit is
    of key importance for convenient use in agricultural facilities, so as not to
    interfere with field operations, avoid the theft of material and allow installation.
    To make the system compatible with commercial sensors, it has been necessary to
    adapt the device to the different interfaces adopted by sensors’ vendors. The
    sampling rate of the sensors and sending rate using a GPRS connection is important
    considerations when estimating the power consumption of the device. In the performed
    tests, the sampling rate was adjusted to 15 min and the sending rate to 30 min.
    These rates are considered a good choice for correct agronomic decisions and for
    maintaining the complete autonomy of the device with an adequate battery and solar
    panel power. Acknowledgments The development of this work was supported by the

  description: Many agricultural studies rely on infrared sensors for remote measurement
    of surface temperatures for crop status monitoring and estimating sensible and

    employed the use of hand-held or stationary industrial infrared thermometers (IRTs)
    wired to data loggers. Wireless sensors in agricultural applications are a practical
    alternative, but the availability of low cost wireless IRTs is limited. In this
    study, we designed prototype narrow (10°) field of view wireless infrared sensor
    modules and evaluated the performance of the IRT sensor by comparing temperature
    readings of an object (Tobj) against a blackbody calibrator in a controlled temperature
    room at ambient temperatures of 15°C, 25°C, 35°C, and 45°C. Additional comparative
    readings were taken over plant and soil samples alongside a hand-held IRT and
    over an isothermal target in the outdoors next to a wired IRT. The average root
    mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) between the collected IRT
    object temperature readings and the blackbody target ranged between 0.10 and 0.79°C.
    The wireless IRT readings also compared well with the hand-held IRT and wired
    industrial IRT. Additional tests performed to investigate the influence of direct
    radiation on IRT measurements indicated that housing the sensor in white polyvinyl
    chloride provided ample shielding for the self-compensating circuitry of the IR
    detector. The relatively low cost of the wireless IRT modules and repeatable measurements
    against a blackbody calibrator and commercial IR thermometers demonstrated that
    these wireless prototypes have the potential to provide accurate surface radiometric
    temperature readings in outdoor applications. Further studies are needed to thoroughly
    test radio frequency communication and power consumption characteristics in an

    agricultureRemote sensingWireless sensors 1. Introduction Infrared thermometers
    (IRTs) have been widely used in agricultural research to remotely measure surface
    temperatures and develop vegetation stress indexes (Jackson et al., 1981, Colaizzi
    et al., 2003), monitor crop canopy temperatures and schedule irrigations based
    on plant feedback (Jones, 2004, Peters and Evett, 2007), predict crop yields (Pinter
    et al., 1983, Irmak et al., 2000, Ajayi and Olufayo, 2004), or estimate sensible
    and latent heat fluxes (e.g. Kustas and Norman, 1997, Kalma and Jupp, 1990). Historically,
    these applications employed the use of stationary industrial IRTs wired to data
    loggers. These sensors can be expensive, cumbersome, and impractical for commercial
    on-farm applications. Wireless IRTs in agricultural applications are a more practical
    alternative, but their availability is limited. Economical radiation thermometry
    detectors with both analog and digital outputs are readily available on the market
    and have been used in the automobile and medical industry, but there are few studies
    concerning these sensors in agricultural settings. A specific example of a wireless
    IRT module that has been evaluated in agricultural applications includes the low-cost
    wireless IRT work by Mahan and Yeater (2008) and Mahan et al. (2010). Although
    this IRT had a wide (1:1) field of view (FOV) and required the targets of interest
    be located near the IRT (approximately within 10 cm), it was reported to be similar
    in accuracy to an industrial-quality sensor over a 13–35 °C range of target temperatures
    in an outdoor environment. These IRTs are now available on the market and compared
    well with measurements from a commercial wired IRT when placed in a cotton field
    in Australia and monitored over a four-month period (Mahan et al., 2010). In separate
    work, O''Shaughnessy and Evett (2010) constructed a wireless IRT sensor by interfacing
    a commercial narrow field of view IRT (IRT/c.5-T-80F/27C, Exergen,1 Inc., Watertown,
    Mass.) with an off-the-shelf radio frequency (RF) module using the open ZigBee
    (IEEE Std. 802.15.4, 2007) communication protocol (O''Shaughnessy and Evett, 2007).
    The Zigbee protocol is characterized by a slow data transfer rate (250 kbp @ 2.4
    GHz), power management to ensure low power consumption, and is optimized for short-duty
    cycle applications which are critical for power conservation. An overview of sensor
    technologies and standards for wireless communications in agriculture are summarized
    by Wang et al. (2006) and will not be discussed in this manuscript. A network
    of these wireless IRTs was created by mounting the IRTs onto a center pivot lateral
    for monitoring crop canopy temperatures using methods described by O''Shaughnessy
    and Evett (2010). Temperature data were transmitted to an embedded computer at
    the pivot point and used in an algorithm for automatic irrigation scheduling.
    The development of reliable wireless network systems that transmit data to a base
    station computer or nearby data logging device increases the convenience and flexibility
    of sensor use (ease of mobility and reduced maintenance of wiring) for researchers
    and producers. The use of an open communication protocol will allow incorporation
    of sensors developed by various manufacturers into sensor network systems without
    the added expense of specialized receivers and additional interface software at
    the base station level. Undoubtedly, dependable wireless networks of infrared
    thermometers that are capable of being integrated into agricultural systems for
    crop monitoring and machine control will also aid in the commercialization of
    precision agricultural applications. As with any scientific measurement, there
    is an inevitable amount of uncertainty when assessing measurements made by sensors;
    these uncertainties must be addressed to minimize error (Taylor, 1997). Infrared
    thermometers measure thermal radiation emitted by an object. All objects at temperatures
    greater than absolute zero radiate energy in the infrared range (Kaplan, 2007).
    Thermal radiation emitted from an object is proportional to the fourth power of
    the absolute temperature of an object''s surface: (1) where q is the emitted radiation,
    σ is Stefan Boltzmann''s constant (5.67 × 10−8 W m−2 K−4), ɛ is emissivity, and
    T is absolute surface temperature of the object (K). Radiation emitted from a
    target is a function of emissivity and surface temperature. However, the output
    of a conventional IRT depends on the temperature difference between the detector
    and target and the sensor and is a weighted average of the radiating components
    within its FOV (Wanjura and Upchurch, 2001). An IRT senses not only the emitted
    radiation but also the reflected thermal radiation from the target surface and
    the radiation from the internal surface of the IRT (Baker et al., 2001). The degree
    to which an IRT is sensitive to reflected and internal radiation is affected by
    the FOV (Brewster, 1992). Uncertainties associated with infrared thermometer signals
    are a combination of the effects of ambient temperature, the alignment of the
    thermometer, detector noise and non-linearity (Shimizu and Ishii, 2008), calibration
    shifts, the inability to eliminate or properly account for the influence of detector
    temperature on the measurement (Baker et al., 2001), true target emissivity values,
    and background radiation. Our interest in a narrow FOV wireless IRT is to provide
    the ability to accurately monitor row crops using sensor networks located on moving
    irrigation systems (Sadler et al., 2002, Peters and Evett, 2004). A sensor with
    a narrow FOV can be mounted on a pivot lateral and maintained at a stationary
    height. This is in contrast to a wider FOV sensor located on a mast in a field
    which requires periodically adjusting its height above the crop canopy as it grows.
    An IRT with a 10° FOV, mounted on a pivot lateral (∼5.1 m above the ground), looking
    slightly forward of the drop hoses at an oblique angle to the vertical mast and
    at a 45° (in the horizontal plane) from the edge of a treatment plot, will have
    a resolve of approximately 0.7 m2 of crop surface. The surface can be approximated
    as an elliptical foot print with the vertical axis estimated as: (2.1) where h
    is the height of the pivot lateral above the ground, α is the IRT''s FOV, and
    Li is the path length from the IRT to the canopy. The horizontal axis, a, can
    be approximated as: (2.2) and the area of the ellipse: (2.3) Positioning of an
    IRT in this manner will help reduce the amount of soil viewed by the sensor (Peters
    and Evett, 2004) when canopy is less than full and help to reduce sun angle effects
    by averaging the temperature readings of shaded and unshaded sides of the canopy
    (Fig. 1). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Graphic showing location
    of wireless infrared thermometer on pivot lateral and projected field of view
    (elliptical footprint with axis a and b). A fundamental difficulty with IR thermometry
    is that all objects emit thermal radiation, including the internal surface of
    an IR detector. Each type of detector, whether it is thermal, photon, or pyroelectric
    is strongly affected by ambient temperature changes which result in temperature
    drift. Temperature drift can be corrected using temperature compensation circuitry,
    temperature regulation, auto null circuitry, chopping, and isothermal protection
    (Omega Engineering, 2000). Although a narrow FOV IRT has the advantage of sensing
    temperature from a homogeneous target when aimed from the appropriate distance,
    there is the disadvantage that a greater percentage of the total incident radiation
    received by the detector will be from its own temperature due to internally reflected
    radiation. This makes narrow FOV sensors more sensitive to changes in their own
    body temperature (Bugbee et al., 1999). Currently, there are a limited number
    of low cost wireless IRT sensors available for retail. An IRT with a narrow FOV
    has the advantage of viewing a homogeneous sample at a height fixed above the
    crop canopy under partial canopy coverage, but the inherent problem of temperature
    output drift due to changes in ambient air temperature have to be overcome. Our
    objectives for this study were to: (1) develop a low cost, wireless, narrow FOV
    IRT sensor; and (2) evaluate the accuracy of the output readings under changing
    ambient temperatures and direct radiation. A brief evaluation of RF signal strength
    of the sensor module was performed to indicate the range of communication using
    whip antennas. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Sensor specification The specifications
    of the infrared thermometer sensor, MLX90614-BCF (Melexis, Ypres, Belgium) are
    summarized in Table 1. This sensor was chosen because of its relatively low cost,
    narrow FOV (collimated to 10° by the manufacturer), and capability for non-contact
    radiometric surface temperature measurements. The sensor package is comprised
    of a long-wave filter that passes radiation from 5.5 to 14 μm, a thermopile detector
    chip and a second unique proprietary signal conditioning chip. The two voltages
    (Vs and Vo) corresponding respectively to: (1) the sensor body temperature (Tsb,
    K); and (2) the object or target temperature (Tobj, K) which is internally compensated
    by Tsb. Voltage outputs were converted to temperature readings using the equation,
    Ti = Vj × 0.02 in K and later converted to °C, where Ti represents either Tobj
    or Tsb and Vj is either Vo or Vs. As with any radiometric sensor, the accuracy
    of this thermometer can be influenced by thermal gradients induced across the
    sensor package (Melexis Data Sheet, 2009). Table 1. Wireless sensor module characteristics.

    We designed electronic circuitry involving a microprocessor to interface the digital
    output of the Melexis IRT and analog output of the battery pack with a wireless
    Zigbee RF module (XBee platform, Series 2, Digi International, Minnetonka, Minn.).
    Sensor data (i.e. Tobj, Tsb), battery voltage, and IRT address (configured with
    dip switches), were collected and stored at the microprocessor level until sent
    to the base station lap top computer using RF telemetry. Temperature data were
    collected every 12 s, averaged and stored every minute. Battery voltage was measured
    and stored every minute. Transmission frequency, data averaging, and the cyclic
    period for the “sleep” state of the RF module were programmed through the microprocessor.
    The circuit was designed with two voltage regulators, one controlling power exclusively
    to the Melexis sensor. The average current draw after testing 5 sensor modules
    was 0.5 mA when the voltage regulator to the Melexis sensor was powered “off.”
    The average current draw was 10 mA when the sensor was powered “on.” During data
    transmission, the sensor modules drew an average of 33 mA, which is governed by
    the design of the XBee series II module. Application code for the sensor module
    processor was created using CodeVision AVR (V2.04.6, Progressive Resources, LLC,
    Indianapolis, Ind.), which is a commercial C compiler for Atmel AVR microcontrollers.
    Data were arranged into the application programming interface (API) format to
    extend the level of interaction between the sensor nodes and the host application
    (Fig. 2). Use of the API format allows detection of a complete data string by
    recognizing the start of the data packet, “7E” (a static value), size of the array
    to parse (based on the number of bytes in the data string), confirmation that
    the string was received from a sensor (based on the packet type and address of
    the sending node), and a means for error checking the data sent by validating
    the received checksum value. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Initial
    line is sample data packet sent by wireless IRT sensor node and received by the
    XBee modem. Pertinent packs are labeled below data line; data is transmitted in
    hexadecimal. Each sensor module was powered with 4 AA nickel metal hydride (NiMH)
    batteries. The batteries were housed in an external white, weather proofed poly
    vinyl chloride (PVC) housing and recharged with a 3 W solar panel (model SC3,
    Sunwize SolCharger, Hudson, Mass.). The combination of off-the-shelf components
    and circuit design will hereinafter be referred to as a wireless IRT (Fig. 3).
    Wireless data for the temperature comparisons discussed in this manuscript were
    collected by an XBee modem connected to a laptop computer using a program running
    under Visual Studio 2008 Ver. 9.2. (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, Wash.). Download

    2.2. Temperature comparisons To evaluate the accuracy of the wireless IRTs and
    reduce uncertainties in error measurement, three methods were used: (1) calibration
    against a variable blackbody; (2) spot temperature comparisons of soil and vegetation
    samples against a commercial hand-held infrared thermometer; and (3) continuous
    temperature comparisons over a highly uniform target against an industrial wired
    IRT in the outdoors. 2.2.1. Sensor vs. blackbody calibrator Temperature output
    instability of the wireless IRTs caused by changes in ambient air temperature
    was measured by comparing the IRT readings to the known set point temperature
    of the blackbody in a number of different ambient temperatures. The variable temperature
    blackbody calibrator (CES100, Electro Optical Industries, Inc., Santa Barbara,
    Calif.) and the wireless IRTs were placed inside of a 3 m × 3 m × 3 m temperature
    control chamber (Environmental Growth Chambers, Inc., Chagrin Falls, Ohio). The
    chamber and sensor body temperatures were brought to equilibrium, after which
    batch readings from the sensors were collected. A data logger (Campbell Scientific,
    model CR 3000, Logan, Utah) was used to automatically control the set point of
    the blackbody and its chiller unit. A special character was broadcast by the data
    logger through an XBee modem to the wireless IRT sensor modules when the blackbody
    had reached a programmed set point. Temperatures, Tobj and Tsb, and battery voltage
    measurements were sent via RF telemetry, only after receiving a special character,
    to a laptop computer located just outside the chamber. The blackbody temperature
    was automatically stepped from 15 to 55 °C (the expected range of canopy or soil
    temperatures during the growing season) in 5-degree increments using an RS-232
    communication link between the data logger and blackbody controller. Twenty data
    samples were collected from each sensor at each blackbody set point for a total
    of 180 data points per sensor per ambient air temperature. Wireless sensor IRT
    readings were taken in four different ambient temperatures (15 °C, 25 °C, 35 °C,
    and 45 °C). These represented ambient temperature ranges that were expected during
    a typical summer growing season at Bushland, TX (CPRL Climate Data files, 2010).
    Although our technique was automated, it was similar to methods performed by Kalma
    et al. (1988) and Bugbee et al. (1999). 2.2.2. Wireless IRT vs. AgriTherm hand-held
    thermometer The wireless IRT was evaluated against the AgriTherm II, a portable
    hand-held infrared thermometer (Everest Interscience Inc., Tucson, Ariz.). The
    sensor module and AgriTherm II were clamped onto separate masts and placed alongside
    one another with a nadir view angle over soil and vegetation samples. The soil
    was 0.25 m (depth) of dry Pullman Clay Loam spread evenly over a 0.46 m × 0.31
    m pan. Vegetation temperature readings were taken over grain sorghum (Sorghum
    bicolor (L.) Moench). The AgriTherm II had a zoom lens and pulsating laser; its
    field of view was adjusted to meet that of the wireless IRT and it emissivity
    was dialed to 0.98. 2.2.3. Wireless IRT vs. wired IRT and thermal imager A third
    comparison involved the use of a wireless IRT and one wired IRT (Exergen model
    IRT/c.5-T-80F/27C) mounted on masts and positioned above a black rectangular aluminum
    block target located outdoors. The wired IRT contained a Type-T thermocouple (copper-constantan)
    detector with specifications similar to the thermopile detector in the wireless
    IRT. The two sensors had the same FOV, were filtered to select spectral responses
    in the 8 to 14 μm range, and measured at comparable levels of accuracy near room
    temperature. The aluminum block target over which both type of sensors were positioned
    had dimensions of 81.3 cm × 38.1 cm × 7.6 cm (tall), and a measured emissivity
    value of 0.99. The method to measure emissivity is described in (Kaplan, 2007).
    Temperature measurements between the wired and wireless IRTs were made over a
    24-h period. Data from the wireless IRTs were collected by a lap top computer
    located in a remote building and time stamped by the acquisition program. The
    wired IRT did not require excitation, rather the voltage differences generated
    between the dissimilar wire types were amplified, collected, and time stamped
    by a data logger (model 21X, Campbell Scientific, Logan, Utah). The clocks for
    the computer and data logger were synchronized prior to data collection for paired
    analysis. The temperature of the aluminum block was extracted from digital images
    taken periodically with a FLIR thermal imager (model SC2000 and ThermaCAM Researcher
    Pro 2.8 software, FLIR Systems, Billerica, Mass.) at a nadir view angle on DOYs
    89, 90 and 91, 2010. 2.2.4. Response to temperature transients with and without
    a heat sink Thermal mass requirements for sensor body temperature stabilization
    were investigated with the detector exposed to heating caused by direct radiation
    while: (1) embedded in an aluminum socket and the detector and circuit interface
    board enclosed inside of a white polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastic sleeve; and
    (2) with the detector and circuit interface board enclosed only in the plastic
    sleeve. Transient incident radiation trials were used to simulate rapid changes
    in radiation on the sensor, which would affect sensor body temperature. Such changes
    may occur, for example, when the sun is intermittently blocked by cloud cover.
    All trials were performed in the controlled temperature room. During each trial,
    the sensor module was aimed at the blackbody target with a constant target temperature,
    TBB (°C). Incident radiation was increased and decreased by turning on and off
    a halogen lamp aimed at the sensor module. A shield isolated the blackbody from
    the radiation. The blackbody target was varied in 5-degree increments as described
    previously, and the testing was repeated in ambient temperatures of 20 °C, 25
    °C, 30 °C, and 40 °C. Temperature readings of wireless IRTs were compared with
    those from the blackbody, wired IRT, hand-held IRT and thermal imager using linear
    regression analysis. Statistics including root mean square error (RMSE): (3) where
    Oi is the ith measurement, Pi is the ith predicted value, n is the total number
    of data pairs. Root mean square error is the standard deviation of measurements
    and characterizes the reliability of measurements (Taylor, 1997). The mean absolute
    error (MAE): (4) is a statistic that indicates the average magnitude of error
    between the observed and predicted (forecasted) measurement. Its use is preferred
    for small or limited data sets. Finally the mean biased error (MBE) described
    by Mandel (1964): (5) reports the inaccuracy or difference in the sample mean
    or expected value (μ) and the reference value (Ri) for each measurement. This
    equation was used to identify systematic or non-random errors. Standard deviation
    from the mean or the non-negative square root of the variance was used to detect
    variability about the mean for measurements made by a single instrument. Finally,
    since it is not possible to measure the true temperature of an object especially
    in the outdoors, the standard error of the predicted y-value for each x in the
    regression was used to measure the amount of error in the prediction of readings
    from an industrial wired IRT (the predicted values) for an individual reading
    from a wireless IRT (the x value). The equation for the standard error is: (6)
    where y and , x and are the samples and mean for the wired IRT and wireless IRTs,
    respectively, and n is the number of paired samples. The standard error is a measure
    of the amount of error in the prediction of y for an individual x, but for our
    purposes, it was used to evaluate how well measurements from the two instruments
    agreed. 2.3. RF communications RF communications were tested by measuring the
    received signal strength indicator (RSSI, measured in dB) for a sensor node at
    each of five separation distances (7.5 m, 15 m, 30 m, 60 m, and 120 m). Signal
    strength is best measured by sending a number of packets and calculating the percent
    of packets received (Andrade-Sanchez et al., 2007, Hebel et al., 2007, O''Shaughnessy
    and Evett, 2010). At each distance, 25 packets of data were broadcast to the sensor
    node and the percent of successful receptions was recorded. Both the sensor node
    and the modem were enclosed inside of a PVC housing with an XBee series 2 (S2)
    module and whip antenna, Fig. 3. The signal strength of the antenna was equal
    to 1.5 dBi (gain of the antenna referenced to an isotropic source), and positioned
    at 1.5 m above the ground during testing. This is the height at which we typically
    place our IRTs relative to crop canopy height. 3. Results and discussion 3.1.
    IRT vs. blackbody calibrator The RMSE values calculated between the wireless IRT
    sensor readings and blackbody target temperatures ranged from 0.10 to 0.79 °C
    for measurements made in all ambient temperatures (Table 2). Compared to the standard
    accuracy of the Melexis, reported to be ±0.5 °C, only two of the tested sensors
    (#15 and #16) had a RMSE above 0.5 °C. The significance of a low RMSE value indicates
    a high level of accuracy; 92% of the tested sensors provided accurate temperature
    measurements against the variable blackbody calibrator in changing ambient temperatures.
    The MAE ranged from 0.12 to 1.52 °C for all sensors compared against the blackbody
    calibrator. Again the highest error values were contributed by sensors #15 and
    #16. This error statistic indicates that these two sensors can output an error
    in temperature reading that is 2–3 times greater in magnitude than the other sensors.
    The MBE for twenty sensors ranged from −0.5 to 0.5 °C. These values being relatively
    close to 0.0 °C and within the specifications provided by the manufacturer, imply
    limited bias. On the other hand, the relatively high MBE levels for sensors #15
    (−1.12 °C) and #16 (1.52 °C) suggest systematic errors. Review of the data for
    sensor #15 showed that the IRT readings were consistently higher than the blackbody
    calibrator, while data for sensor #16 indicated that its readings were consistently
    lower than the target. Fig. 4a provides a graphic of both the accuracy [range
    of residual errors, i.e. differences in temperature between the target (TBB) and
    the IRT reading (Tobj)] shown along the ‘y-axis’ for sensor #20. The error residuals
    generally ranged from −0.6 to 0.6 °C regardless of the temperature difference
    between TBB and Tsb shown along the ‘x-axis’; this indicated that the sensor output
    remained relatively accurate when sensor body temperature changed. In contrast,
    the errors in readings from sensor #15 were consistently greater than 0.5 °C whenever
    the Tsb was equal to or greater than TBB; and the majority of the errors were
    negative, Fig. 4b. The negative bias and sources of error may stem from any number
    of issues including imprecision of the temperature compensating chip or problems
    associated with the interface board. Probable examples include electronic noise
    caused by imperfections in the interface circuit that we constructed, heat build-up
    during the operation of the sensor or from the heat given off by the blackbody
    calibrator, or misalignment against the blackbody calibrator target when the sensors
    were tested in batches. Table 2. IRT readings compared against blackbody calibrator.

    temperature readings across a range of TBB and sensor body (Tsb) temperature differences
    from −40 °C to +40 °C for: (a) sensor #20 having a RMSE = 0.16 °C and MBE = −0.08
    °C; and (b) sensor #15 having a RMSE = 0.59 °C and MBE = −1.12 °C. The simple
    linear regression equation was used to calibrate each sensor and did not include
    sensor body temperature as a variable to adjust the sensor output reading: (7)
    where Y was the measured value of the blackbody target, and mi and bi are the
    customized slope and intercept from the regression. This calibration equation
    reduced the RMSE value in most cases, Table 2. The use of simple linear equations
    is different from those used by Bugbee et al. (1999) where in their studies, the
    slope and intercept were parameterized as a function of Tsb using higher order
    polynomials. Applying the correction techniques of Bugbee et al. (1999) to the
    wireless IRT sensors only slightly increased the RMSE values (data not shown)
    for our sensors. 3.2. Response to temperature transients with and without a heat
    sink When direct radiation was applied to the detector embedded inside of an aluminum
    socket and white PVC sleeve while the blackbody temperature was varied (in different
    ambient temperatures), the detector responded by decreasing voltage output (Vo)
    for the Tobj readings when Tsb was greater than TBB, and increasing Vo when Tsb
    was less than TBB (Fig. 5). In other words, the detector under compensated when
    the sensor body temperature was greater than the blackbody temperature (TBB) and
    overcompensated when the TBB was more than 10 °C greater than Tsb. With the detector
    embedded in the heat sink, the maximum error ranged from −0.8 to 1.5 °C which
    was greater than the manufacturer''s specifications of 0.5 °C under isothermal
    conditions. The MBE was not significantly different when the detector was embedded
    in the aluminum housing (0.08 °C) compared to 0.09 °C when the detector was located
    only in the PVC sleeve. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Error (difference

    Comparisons were made in ambient temperatures of 20 °C, 25 °C, 30 °C, and 40 °C.
    Further stability testing was performed by investigating the effects of direct
    radiation over a short period of time and under a constant ambient temperature
    near 20 °C with the detector embedded inside of a heat sink and the detector and
    interface circuit board inside of the PVC housing. There was no significant difference
    in Tobj readings (Fig. 6a). While embedded inside of the heat sink, the sensor
    body temperature rose by 4 °C after approximately 30 min (time frame corresponding
    to sampling between 27 and 107 on the horizontal scale) of direct heating. This
    test was repeated four times and the average RMSE between Tobj and the blackbody
    target temperature was 0.04 °C, while the MAE was 0.33 °C. Download : Download

    to transitory heat: (a) IRT housed in aluminum block and PVC sleeve, RMSE = 0.04
    °C; and (b) bare IRT sensor exposed directly to heat, RMSE = 0.05 °C. With the
    detector removed from the heat sink but enclosed inside the PVC housing with the
    interfacing circuit board, direct heat was again applied, Tsb rapidly increased
    over a short period of time, however, Tobj readings remained very near to TBB
    (Fig. 6b). The RMSE between Tobj and TBB was 0.05 °C and the MAE was 0.50 °C.
    The stability of the object temperature reading under the influence of direct
    radiation and no heat sink demonstrated that the compensation feature of the sensor
    functioned well to maintain accurate temperature readings relative to TBB and
    that the heat sink did not provide additional benefits. It should be noted that
    in both cases, the Tobj was greater than TBB however the change in Tobj was not
    significant over time and can be corrected using an offset. Realizing that it
    is not possible to measure the true temperature of an object, the next two experiments
    were completed to determine the differences between IRT measurements and those
    from accepted instruments, i.e. readings from a commercial hand-held IRT and an
    industrial IRT. The differences in measurements were not to be considered errors,
    but rather were used to characterize the magnitude of variation among and between
    IRT instruments. 3.3. Hand-held and wireless comparisons Multiple readings taken
    over vegetation and soil at different times of the day allowed us to evaluate
    the precision of the wireless and hand-held IRT. The standard deviation of measurements
    shown for each instrument over each sample type and time period ranged from 0.00
    to 0.08 °C for the Agritherm II and from 0.07 to 0.15 °C for the wireless IRT.
    This indicates that the variability of temperature readings for each instrument
    was small and that the Agritherm II instrument displayed less variability. The
    MAE represents the magnitude of difference between the instruments over the different
    samples and time periods. A difference of less than 1 °C indicates that the measurements
    were in good agreement, Table 3. Table 3. Average and mean difference of temperatures
    of 10 samples from a wireless sensor module and handheld IRT taken at different
    times of the day. SD represents one standard deviation from the mean temperature.

    Wired and wireless comparisons This study resulted in paired temperature measurements
    between a wireless and industrial wired IRT over a two-day period in ambient temperatures
    ranging from 10 to 45 °C. The standard error of the predicted reading (the wired
    IRT), for each reading from the wireless IRT was 0.32 °C (07:55–15:42 h) and 0.26
    °C (16:32–02:30 h) on DOY 89–90, and 0.43 °C (07:55–15:42 h) and 0.40 °C (16:32–02:30
    h) when viewing the aluminum block target on DOY 90–91. The relatively low standard
    error values demonstrate that the wireless IRT readings compared well with those
    from the commercial wired IRT, Fig. 7. Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    7. Surface temperatures from the wireless IRT and commercial wired IRT. Measurements
    were made on DOY 89, 90, and 91 of 2010 while both sensors were viewing an aluminum
    block. Three thermal images were taken consecutively at 1-min intervals at each
    of four different start times throughout the day. Measurements from both IRTs
    evaluated against the extracted temperatures from the FLIR images were in good
    agreement. Evaluating the accuracy of both IRTs against data from the FLIR camera
    (the predicted value) using the RMSE statistic indicated that the wireless IRT
    (RMSE = 0.55 °C) was closer in value to readings from the thermal images than
    the wired instrument (RMSE = 1.10 °C), Table 4. As the ambient air temperature
    increased, the output of the wired IRT was consistently higher than that of the
    wireless IRT and data extracted from the FLIR image. The temperature drift of
    the wired IRT was indicative of this instrument''s sensitivity to changes in ambient
    air temperature and inability to compensate output readings quickly. In general,
    it is difficult to make concise paired measurements from multiple IRTs even after
    aligning the sensors side-by-side in an outdoor environment due to the numbers
    of variables impacting thermal measurements. The aluminum block was used to minimize
    target variations and improve comparisons between the wired and wireless IRT against
    a large isothermal target of relatively uniform emissivity (in the outdoors).

    38.1 3.5. Radio frequency communication Radio communications for three wireless
    sensors at five different distances from an XBee coordinator, indicated an average
    peak RSSI of 90% (of packets received), at an interval distance of 15 m, Fig.
    8. The RSSI declined as the distance between the sensors and coordinator increased.
    There was a consistent dip in signal strength at the 30 m interval for each sensor
    tested. The reduced communication range at 30 m could not be accounted for with
    the testing that we performed, since the calculated radius of the widest point
    of the Fresnel zone at a distance of 30 m between antennas was 0.94 m, the height
    of the sensors was 1.5 m, and there was no object obstructing the line of the
    sight between the sensor node and coordinator during the testing. However, the
    significant decrease in range at the 120 m interval was expected due the power
    limitations of the RF module. It should also be noted that enclosure of the RF
    antenna inside the PVC housing attenuates the signal strength has reported by
    Darr and Zhao (2008) and O''Shaughnessy and Evett (2010). Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 8. RF signal strength between sensor node and modem measured
    at a height of 1.5 m above the ground at separation distances of 7.5, 15, 30,
    60, and 120 m. Each data point represents 5 samples, and the vertical bars represent
    1 standard deviation. 4. Discussion Assessing uncertainties in the output readings
    of these prototype wireless IRTs was important because accurate measurements using
    these instruments are required in research applications. Although it was impossible
    to obtain “true” object temperature readings, a number of comparisons were used
    against instruments with very narrow specifications, and with instruments that
    have accepted temperature readings such as the commercial hand-held IRT and the
    industrial wired IRT. Output readings from the wireless IRTs may have been affected
    by imperfections in the interface board. Flaws may be detected by measuring the
    resistance of each component without power to the board and then measuring voltages
    at specific points and comparing the readings to expected values when the board
    is powered. If excessive heat build-up occurs during the transmission of data
    (period of highest current draw) and if it impacts the temperature of the IR detector,
    then it may be possible to limit the heat build-up by troubleshooting for imperfections
    that are the cause of high impedance, increasing the size of the power traces
    on the interface board, reviewing the dissipation and efficiency factors of various
    board components and replacing them with better performing parts, and limiting
    the length of transmission periods. Overall, the low RMSE values calculated for
    the majority of sensors indicated that the detector''s temperature compensation
    algorithm worked well. If built-in temperature compensation is not adequate, then
    the methods of calibration provided by Kalma et al. (1988) may need to be applied.
    It should be noted that the communication evaluation of the wireless sensors was
    very limited in scope, but the communication range of these IRTs can be improved
    by substituting a RF module with an external dipole antenna (greater gain) or
    by increasing the size of the antenna at the coordinator when established within
    a wireless sensor network. Additionally when working with mesh-type wireless sensor
    networks, the number of sensors in a network and the placement of repeaters can
    also impact the reliability and range of data communication. 5. Conclusions This
    study evaluated the performance of prototype narrow FOV wireless IRTs against
    a blackbody calibrator and measurements from hand-held and wired infrared thermometers.
    An increase in the availability of narrow FOV wireless IRTs could alleviate challenges
    for agricultural researchers who are utilizing infrared thermometry to effectively
    quantify crop water stress and provide instrumentation useful to precision agricultural
    applications. Surface temperature readings from the wireless IRTs compared well
    in indoor and outdoor environments, and over soil and vegetation samples. Low
    RMSE and MAE values indicate that the manufacturer''s applied signal conditioning
    method mitigated the issue of temperature drift under the tested conditions. There
    was no apparent advantage to using the aluminum socket for purposes of sensor
    body temperature stabilization which is important in designing suitable and economical
    housing. Although accuracy is not easy to obtain in outdoor conditions, the comparisons
    reported by this manuscript indicated that the readings from these prototypes
    will provide adequate monitoring of crop canopy temperature when positioned on
    a pivot lateral. However, because PVC housing does not completely isolate the
    IRT element from changes in ambient air temperature or heating that may be produced
    by the electronic components on the circuit board, additional testing of the wireless
    sensor modules in an outdoor setting is necessary to investigate the consistency
    and accuracy of long term object temperature readings, especially when the difference
    between sensor body and object temperature is greater than 10 °C. Acknowledgements

  description: The development of site-specific sprinkler irrigation water management
    systems will be a major factor in future efforts to improve the various efficiencies
    of water-use and to support a sustainable irrigated environment. The challenge
    is to develop fully integrated management systems with supporting elements that
    accurately and inexpensively sense within-field variability and then optimally
    control variable-rate water application systems in ways that account for the spatial
    variability affecting water use. Recent advances in sensor and wireless radio
    frequency (RF) technologies have enabled the development of distributed in-field
    sensor-based irrigation systems to support site-specific irrigation management.
    Thus, integration of a decision making process with a distributed wireless sensor
    network (WSN) and providing real time input to site-specific controls is a viable
    option. This presentation reviews research on the implementation of an in-field
    micrometeorological information that was fed from the distributed WSN and displayed
    on a geo-referenced field map in a computer base station. Low-cost Bluetooth wireless
    RF communications from both a distributed WSN and the machine controls monitoring
    of sprinkler status and GPS location were interfaced with a computer base station
    for processing by a decision support program, which updated the instructions to
    the variable rate irrigation controller for real-time site-specific control. The
    decision support was optimized to adapt changes of crop design, irrigation pattern,
    and field location for instructions for individual sprinkler heads on how much
    water to apply and where. A graphical user interface (GUI) with a simple click-and-play
    menu was used, which also allowed growers to remotely access field conditions
    and irrigation status at the home or office via the wireless RF communications.

  description: 'This paper aims to highlight the benefits from the integration of
    wireless sensor network / meteorological data and remote sensing for monitoring
    and determine irrigation demand in Cyprus. Estimating evapotranspiration in Cyprus
    will help, in taking measures for an effective irrigation water management in
    the future in the island. For this purpose both multi-spectral satellite images
    (Landsat 7 ETM+ and ASTER) and hydro-meteorological data from wireless sensors
    and automatic meteorological stations have been used. The wireless sensor network,
    which consist approximately twenty wireless nodes, was placed in our case study.
    The wireless sensor network acts as a wide area distributed data collection system
    deployed to collect and reliably transmit soil and air environmental data to a
    remote base-station hosted at Cyprus University of Technology. Furthermore auxiliary

    ARTICLE MENU     Abstract This paper aims to highlight the benefits from the integration
    of wireless sensor network / meteorological data and remote sensing for monitoring
    and determine irrigation demand in Cyprus. Estimating evapotranspiration in Cyprus
    will help, in taking measures for an effective irrigation water management in
    the future in the island. For this purpose both multi-spectral satellite images
    (Landsat 7 ETM+ and ASTER) and hydro-meteorological data from wireless sensors
    and automatic meteorological stations have been used. The wireless sensor network,
    which consist approximately twenty wireless nodes, was placed in our case study.
    The wireless sensor network acts as a wide area distributed data collection system
    deployed to collect and reliably transmit soil and air environmental data to a
    remote base-station hosted at Cyprus University of Technology. Furthermore auxiliary
    meteorological field data, from an automatic meteorological station, nearby our
    case study, where used such as solar radiation, air temperature, air humidity
    and wind speed. These data were used in conjunction with remote sensing results.
    Satellite images where used in ERDAS Imagine Software after the necessary processing:
    geometric rectification, radiometric calibration and atmospheric corrections.
    The satellite images were atmospheric corrected and calibrated using spectro-radiometers
    and sun-photometers measurements taken in situ, in an agricultural area, south-west
    of the island of Cyprus. Evapotranspiration is difficult to determine since it
    combines various meteorological and field parameters while in literature quite
    many different models for estimating ET are indicated. For estimating evapotranspiration
    from satellite images and the hydro-meteorological data different methods have
    been evaluated such as FAO Penman-Monteith, Carlson-Buffum and Granger methods.
    These results have been compared with E-pan methods. Finally a water management
    irrigation schedule has been applied. The final results are presented and compared
